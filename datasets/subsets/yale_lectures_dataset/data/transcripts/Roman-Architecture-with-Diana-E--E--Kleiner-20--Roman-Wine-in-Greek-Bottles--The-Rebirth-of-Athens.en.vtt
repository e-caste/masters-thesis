00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.950
Prof: Good morning
everybody.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.079
We have talked in the course of
this semester many times about

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:10.990
the Hellenization of Roman
architecture,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.955
about the impact that Greek
architecture had on Roman

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:16.100
architecture.
 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.645
And we've talked in particular
about the two philhellenic

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:23.365
emperors,
Augustus and also Hadrian,

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:27.528
and the kinds of monuments they
commissioned during their reign

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:31.490
that were so clearly based on
those in ancient Athens --

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.070
Athens, especially of the
Classical period,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.867
the cradle of civilization,
and where scholars often speak

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:43.020
of as the birth of democracy.
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.425
I want to turn full circle,
go full circle here and return

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:52.216
to the whole question of Athens,
by looking at Athens itself,

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:55.420
because Athens also became a
Roman colony.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.554
And you won't be surprised to
hear that it was built up under

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:03.893
primarily two Roman emperors,
namely Augustus and Hadrian,

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:09.138
just as one would expect,
the two major philhellenic

00:01:09.138 --> 00:01:11.099
Roman emperors.
 

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:16.720
I show you a spectacular view
of Athens as it looks today.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.680
And you can see here that the
city of Athens--

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.510
and some of its antiquities
extremely well preserved--

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.281
is a city that is located --
it's actually a city that's

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:33.530
located in plains ,
surrounded by mountains.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.551
And it also has three major
hills, as I think you can see

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:39.849
from this extraordinary image.
 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.836
One of those hills,
of course, is the famous

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:43.670
Acropolis.
 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.536
And I think,
by the way, if one were to

00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:48.197
make--
I don't how many of you have

00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:50.924
been to Athens,
but if one were to make a list

00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:54.050
of the ten places that one
really must see,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.730
at some point during their
lives, and experience,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.909
Athens is certainly one of
them, mainly for the Acropolis,

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.359
which you see in the center of
this image here.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.328
That's one of the major hills.
 

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:09.117
The other two are Mount
Lycabettus, which you see in the

00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:11.758
uppermost part;
that's actually the highest

00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:12.628
hill of Athens.
 

00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:15.258
And then there's another one
called the Mouseion Hill,

00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:16.979
which we're going to actually
talk about today,

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.729
because there's an important
monument there --

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.120
the Mouseion Hill or the Hill
of the Muses.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.938
It's located off this image,
right where I'm standing here.

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:27.744
And those three hills,
as you can see,

00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:30.169
rise up in the city of Athens.
 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.983
And it's not surprising--and
the rest of it surrounded

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:38.084
essentially by a city that was
constructed primarily after

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:41.401
World War II,
mainly residential houses of

00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.324
six, five,
six stories,

00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:47.190
residences that are mostly
white in color,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.160
as I think you can see here.
 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.229
But the Acropolis rising up in
the center in an amazing way.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:03:02.128
The city of Athens we know was
founded in the Neolithic period;

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:04.340
it was founded in the Neolithic
period.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.750
So it goes way back,
in the same way that Rome does.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.787
And it's not surprising to see
them founding the city of Athens

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:12.349
on one of those hills.
 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.000
And which hill do they pick?
 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.986
They pick the hill that's the
flattest, which makes it easiest

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:21.908
to build on, and that is the
rock of the Acropolis itself.

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:25.699
So they put their religious
structures on the Acropolis,

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.488
and then over time the city
begins to grow up around the

00:03:29.488 --> 00:03:31.280
rock of the Acropolis.
 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.167
Now this is very interesting
because if you think back to

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:37.389
Rome and its beginnings,
you'll recall that Rome too was

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.182
founded on a hill,
because hills can be most

00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:41.410
readily fortified.
 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.818
So Rome was founded,
you'll recall,

00:03:43.818 --> 00:03:46.889
essentially on two hills,
on the Palatine Hill,

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.949
by Romulus, where he
established residences,

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.525
but also on the Capitoline Hill
where they built the Temple of

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.870
Jupiter Optimus Maximus
Capitolinus --

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.530
so that being the religious
center of the city.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.807
We see the same sort of thing
happening here:

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.878
the city growing up on the
Acropolis,

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:06.282
and then we'll see that the
meeting and marketplace is down

00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:07.658
below,
in a valley,

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:11.200
below the Acropolis,
in the same way that the Roman

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.813
Forum,
or what became the Roman Forum,

00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:16.639
was in the valley beneath the
Palatine Hill,

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.959
and also the Capitoline Hill in
Rome.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.439
So very similar beginnings for
Greece, as also for Rome.

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.759
As you all know,
Athens thrived particularly,

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.040
Greece in general thrived
particularly in the fifth

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.226
century B.C.,
under Pericles,

00:04:33.226 --> 00:04:37.240
and continued to thrive into
the Hellenistic period.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.235
But it was in 86 B.C.
 

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:43.987
that Sulla, the Roman general
Sulla, sacked Athens,

00:04:43.987 --> 00:04:47.882
sacked Athens,
made Athens a Roman colony,

00:04:47.882 --> 00:04:53.490
and in fact destroyed the walls
of the city of Athens.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.199
So that obviously a very major
point in the history of Athens.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.995
When scholars talk about
architecture that was put up by

00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:07.485
the Romans in Athens,
during Roman times,

00:05:07.485 --> 00:05:11.750
they talk about it as being
primarily uninspired and rather

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.778
derivative.
 

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:14.639
And you'll find this in your
textbook.

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.391
Ward-Perkins talks about how
derivative Roman architecture in

00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.401
Greece is, of its earlier
counterparts,

00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:26.439
that is, from Classical and
Hellenistic Athens.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.913
And I think he has a point,
and it's something that we

00:05:28.913 --> 00:05:30.639
should all think about as a
group,

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.367
whether we think that the
buildings that we look at today

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:34.771
are,
for the most part,

00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:37.839
derivative from the Classical
and Hellenistic past.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:41.740
But I think to say only that is
to miss the point in part,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.889
because what we are also going
to see,

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.170
as we look at these buildings
today,

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.175
is that the extraordinary
marbles that come from this part

00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:52.928
of the world,
Greek marbles--and we'll talk

00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:56.612
about a number of them today--
the quality of those is so high

00:05:56.612 --> 00:06:00.310
that it's hard to imagine any
building made out of these,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.009
not spectacular,
just for the materials alone.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.180
And also because the artists
and the architects,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.601
and the artisans who are
responsible for carving this

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:12.728
marble,
had been carving it for

00:06:12.728 --> 00:06:16.560
centuries, and consequently they
were particularly skilled at

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.709
carving marble.
 

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:20.812
And so what they produced has
great beauty,

00:06:20.812 --> 00:06:23.028
as I think you'll see today.
 

00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:25.778
So those two,
again a very important point,

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:29.250
I believe, about the quality of
these works of art.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.300
And we're also going to see
works of architecture.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.949
We're also going to see that at
least two of them,

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:37.632
in my opinion,
are really distinctive

00:06:37.632 --> 00:06:40.288
structures;
different than anything we've

00:06:40.288 --> 00:06:40.980
seen before.
 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.519
And I think that you'll find
they're quite innovative in

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:45.550
their own way.
 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.040
And we will look at,
as I said, both of those today.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.976
The city of Athens began to be
excavated by archaeologists in

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:57.732
the 1930s ,
and those excavations,

00:06:57.732 --> 00:07:00.865
which were scientific,
very careful scientific

00:07:00.865 --> 00:07:03.168
excavations,
those excavations,

00:07:03.168 --> 00:07:07.867
combined with information that
we have from a writer of the

00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:12.809
Greco-Roman past,
a man by the name of Pausanias,

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:17.461
P-a-u-s-a-n-i-a-s,
Pausanias, who was a Greek of

00:07:17.461 --> 00:07:21.800
the second century A.D.,
who traveled around Greece and

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.180
described everything that he
saw,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.785
and he created,
in essence, a guidebook to the

00:07:26.785 --> 00:07:28.870
great Greek and Roman
antiquities.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.670
The combination of his
descriptions,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.978
from the second century,
firsthand descriptions of the

00:07:34.978 --> 00:07:37.850
monuments that stood in the
second century,

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.773
along with the scientific
excavations of the 1930s and

00:07:42.773 --> 00:07:46.410
since,
allow us to get an excellent

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.831
sense of what,
not only what,

00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:50.829
as we look at the remains
today,

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:53.629
not only of what was there,
is there now,

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:56.627
and was there once upon a time,
but what these buildings

00:07:56.627 --> 00:08:00.052
actually were;
their identities and what their

00:08:00.052 --> 00:08:04.168
function was in Athens,
either in Greek or in Roman

00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:04.910
times.
 

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.507
And we will use the information
provided by both of those today

00:08:09.507 --> 00:08:13.437
to allow us to reconstruct the
city, the Roman city in

00:08:13.437 --> 00:08:14.550
particular.
 

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.211
Now the building-- as you can
see from the view of the

00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:20.694
Acropolis,
there are a number of Greek

00:08:20.694 --> 00:08:23.100
structures on the top of the
Acropolis,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.379
and I'll show them to you later.
 

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:28.014
These include the great Greek
entryway of the fifth century

00:08:28.014 --> 00:08:32.129
B.C., the so-called Propylaia;
the famous Parthenon of course;

00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:35.530
the small Temple of Athena Nike;
and also the Erechtheion,

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.527
which is the only building
we've really discussed in any

00:08:38.527 --> 00:08:40.759
detail in the course of this
semester.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:41.879
A fifth century B.C.
 

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:44.850
building--you see it here in an
extraordinary view,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.570
now on the screen--the
Erechtheion,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.785
which we believe was built
sometime between about 421 and

00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:54.139
406 B.C.,
And the reason that it's

00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:57.644
important is not only because
it's an incredible example of

00:08:57.644 --> 00:08:59.879
fifth-century Greek
architecture,

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:04.067
but also because of the
buildings up on the Acropolis it

00:09:04.067 --> 00:09:08.332
is the one that seems to have
captured the imagination of

00:09:08.332 --> 00:09:10.275
Augustus,
and also Hadrian,

00:09:10.275 --> 00:09:12.700
when both of them visited the
city of Athens,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.470
but also of the Romans as a
whole.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.466
And you'll remember the reason
for that is essentially the

00:09:18.466 --> 00:09:21.690
Porch of the Maidens,
which you can see so well in

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.929
this view --
the Porch of the Maidens that

00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:29.269
exerted a very strong impact on
Augustus and Hadrian.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:32.429
Before I talk a little bit more
about the Porch of the Maidens

00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:35.538
though, just something about the
rest of the construction.

00:09:35.538 --> 00:09:38.590
You can see as you look at the
columns that they are of the

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.427
Ionic order,
a particularly attractive and

00:09:41.427 --> 00:09:44.038
elegant version of the Ionic
order,

00:09:44.038 --> 00:09:46.931
with the Ionic capitals,
with their very attractive

00:09:46.931 --> 00:09:47.509
volutes.
 

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:50.668
You can also see the materials
that are used here.

00:09:50.668 --> 00:09:52.620
What you can't see is what's
used for the foundations.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.529
That material is called poros,
p-o-r-o-s,

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:59.991
poros, used for the foundations
of the Erechtheion and also many

00:09:59.991 --> 00:10:02.740
other of the buildings that
we'll look at today.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:08.149
And then most importantly,
most of the building,

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:12.515
the walls and the columns,
are made out of pentelic

00:10:12.515 --> 00:10:14.724
marble,
p-e-n-t-e-l-i-c,

00:10:14.724 --> 00:10:18.558
pentelic marble,
which is from Mount Pentelikon

00:10:18.558 --> 00:10:23.894
in Greece and is the marble that
is used most often for buildings

00:10:23.894 --> 00:10:27.365
in Athens,
both in Greek times and also in

00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:29.610
Roman times,
as we shall see today.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.474
And it's characterized by being
gleaming white,

00:10:33.474 --> 00:10:38.010
really blindingly white,
as one looks at it in the very

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.538
bright Greek sun against the
blue sky.

00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:44.279
With regard to the caryatid
porch,

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:47.062
the Porch of the Maidens,
the very famous Porch of the

00:10:47.062 --> 00:10:49.399
Maidens,
you'll recall that both

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.230
Augustus and Hadrian visited
Athens.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.110
They both saw this monument.
 

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.044
The Erechtheion had fallen into
disrepair by the age of

00:10:58.044 --> 00:11:01.179
Augustus,
and Augustus was so admiring of

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:04.899
this porch that he made the
decision to have his own

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:09.418
architects and artisans come to
Athens to repair the porch.

00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:12.804
And they not only repaired the
maidens, themselves,

00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:14.428
but also replaced one.
 

00:11:14.428 --> 00:11:18.048
One was in such bad shape--I
think it was the one in the back

00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:21.546
right--it was in such bad shape
that they restored that one

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:22.330
entirely.
 

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.259
When they were there,
looking at those maidens,

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:28.715
restoring them,
they were so taken by them that

00:11:28.715 --> 00:11:31.418
they made plaster casts of
those,

00:11:31.418 --> 00:11:33.129
and they brought them back to
Rome.

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:37.952
And you'll recall that they
were used in Rome as the models

00:11:37.952 --> 00:11:40.529
for maidens that were put up.
 

00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:42.894
Here's a view,
of course, of those on the

00:11:42.894 --> 00:11:44.548
Acropolis, from the front.
 

00:11:44.548 --> 00:11:48.581
They made reduced scale copies
for the Forum of Augustus in

00:11:48.581 --> 00:11:51.850
Rome, the second story of the
Forum of Augustus,

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.308
as you'll recall.
 

00:11:53.308 --> 00:11:57.120
And then down here you'll be
reminded of the caryatids,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.822
also based on those of the
Erechtheion: in this case to

00:12:00.822 --> 00:12:04.051
scale,
same scale as those in Athens,

00:12:04.051 --> 00:12:08.840
used to line the Canopus of
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.730
So both emperors,
again Augustus and Hadrian,

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.250
very admiring of these works of
art,

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.139
and wanted copies of them for,
in Augustus' case a public

00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:21.514
structure in Rome,
in Hadrian's case a private

00:12:21.514 --> 00:12:22.720
villa at Tivoli.
 

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.226
And we even believe that
Herodes Atticus,

00:12:25.226 --> 00:12:28.360
in the tomb that he made for
Annia Regilla in Rome,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.806
that brick tomb,
the second century A.D.

00:12:30.806 --> 00:12:33.688
on the Via Appia,
there were two female figures

00:12:33.688 --> 00:12:36.897
that were found near,
excavated near that tomb,

00:12:36.897 --> 00:12:39.924
and it has been suggested that
they too may belong to that

00:12:39.924 --> 00:12:40.350
tomb.
 

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.710
And while they are variations
rather than copies,

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:48.120
you can see that they too owe
their origins to the caryatids.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.008
So this building,
the Erechtheion,

00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:56.259
cast a spell on Augustus and
Hadrian, and was widely imitated

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:57.308
in Rome.
 

00:12:57.308 --> 00:13:00.292
What we're going to see today
is that this building continued

00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:03.274
to have a very strong impact
also on the buildings that these

00:13:03.274 --> 00:13:06.967
same emperors,
Augustus and Hadrian,

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:10.240
put up in Athens itself.
 

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.177
Before we look at Athens,
I want to take a very short

00:13:16.177 --> 00:13:20.668
trip to another city,
the city of Eleusis,

00:13:20.668 --> 00:13:24.283
E-l-e-u-s-i-s,
the city of Eleusis in Greece,

00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:28.711
because I want to make one more
point about the caryatids and

00:13:28.711 --> 00:13:32.845
about the important exchange
that we believe was going on

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:37.072
between Rome and Athens,
already in the late Caesarian

00:13:37.072 --> 00:13:39.639
period and into the age of
Augustus.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.629
Augustus is sending his
architects,

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:44.830
but we think they are going
back and forth,

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.389
and that there is an important
exchange of building techniques,

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:52.413
as well as architectural ideas,
that is happening between Rome

00:13:52.413 --> 00:13:54.788
and Greece in the age of
Augustus.

00:13:54.788 --> 00:14:00.118
Eleusis--and you see what it
looks like today--is a hilly

00:14:00.118 --> 00:14:04.590
town that is located not too far
from Athens.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:11.019
And it was particularly popular
in the Greek period because--

00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:13.389
or particularly important in
the Geek period--

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:17.490
because it had a sanctuary of
the goddess Demeter,

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.950
the goddess Demeter.
 

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.576
And the goddess Demeter,
surrounding her was this very

00:14:22.576 --> 00:14:26.590
important mystery religion,
the so-called Eleusinian

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.383
Mysteries,
after Eleusis,

00:14:28.383 --> 00:14:31.220
Eleusinian Mysteries,
that took place here.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.962
And people came from far and
wide to partake of those

00:14:34.962 --> 00:14:38.706
Eleusinian Mysteries,
and so the city was built up in

00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:41.730
Classical and Hellenistic Greek
times.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.952
It also remained important in
the time of Caesar and into the

00:14:45.952 --> 00:14:50.881
time of Augustus,
and actually into the first and

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:55.614
second centuries A.D.,
and over time decisions were

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:58.620
made to add to the Sanctuary of
Demeter,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.408
by the Roman emperors and
generals,

00:15:01.408 --> 00:15:05.684
and also--and using,
of course the service of their

00:15:05.684 --> 00:15:10.062
own architects from Rome,
but working in concert with

00:15:10.062 --> 00:15:11.308
those in Greece.
 

00:15:11.308 --> 00:15:15.221
And one of the decisions that
they made was to provide the

00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:18.586
Sanctuary of Demeter with two
additional gateways:

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:21.470
an inner gateway and an outer
gateway.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.427
The outer gateway,
which is the larger of the two,

00:15:24.427 --> 00:15:26.599
was put up in the second
century A.D.

00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:28.350
by the Antonine emperors.
 

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.601
But the earlier one,
the inner or smaller gateway,

00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:37.807
was put up already in 50 B.C.,
so the late Republican period,

00:15:37.807 --> 00:15:39.629
put up in 50 B.C.
 

00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:43.260
And there are some remains of
it, enough that we can come up

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.769
with quite good reconstructions
of what it looked like.

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:49.610
And I want to show you those
fairly quickly in passing,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.764
just because they underscore
this important connection that

00:15:53.764 --> 00:15:56.559
is going on between Rome and
Greece,

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.019
in this period.
 

00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:02.581
We see one side--this gateway
actually has two sides--and we

00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:06.293
see one side of it here,
with columns and a quite

00:16:06.293 --> 00:16:08.690
traditional pediment above.
 

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.375
The triglyphs and metopes that
you see here have

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:14.462
representations of sheaves of
wheat and what are called

00:16:14.462 --> 00:16:16.442
cistae,
c-i-s-t-a-e,

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:19.942
which are baskets,
both of which have to do with

00:16:19.942 --> 00:16:24.038
the Eleusinian Mysteries and the
worship of Demeter.

00:16:24.038 --> 00:16:26.210
But what's most interesting for
us--

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.014
and it may be a little hard for
you to make this out in this

00:16:29.014 --> 00:16:31.326
reconstruction--
but what's interesting for us

00:16:31.326 --> 00:16:33.774
are the capitals,
because the capitals are

00:16:33.774 --> 00:16:37.201
examples of the so-called
zoomorphic capitals that we've

00:16:37.201 --> 00:16:40.623
seen before --
capitals in which the upper

00:16:40.623 --> 00:16:45.785
parts of the bodies of animals
take the place of the spirals

00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:49.200
and grow out of the acanthus
leaves.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.154
And I can show you one
preserved example from Eleusis

00:16:53.154 --> 00:16:56.654
over here, on the left-hand side
of the screen,

00:16:56.654 --> 00:16:59.090
made out of pentelic marble.
 

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.155
We see it here,
and you can see the acanthus

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:05.173
leaves,
and you can see a part of the

00:17:05.173 --> 00:17:08.828
upper part of a bull that is
growing out of--

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:12.118
a bull protome that is growing
out of the acanthus leaves.

00:17:12.118 --> 00:17:15.207
That should remind you of
something we saw much earlier in

00:17:15.207 --> 00:17:16.019
the semester.
 

00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:18.869
Does anyone remember where this
capital comes from?

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.140
I know you all know.
 

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.259
Student:  Forum
Transitorium.

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:30.494
Prof: Not the Forum
Transitorium,

00:17:30.494 --> 00:17:30.910
no.
 

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.743
The Forum of Augustus;
the Forum of Augustus had these

00:17:34.743 --> 00:17:38.905
capitals, some of these
capitals, that included pegasi

00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:41.890
growing out of the acanthus
leaves.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.550
So this suggests to us,
this whole idea of having

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.880
animals growing out of acanthus
leaves,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.737
roughly--not exactly at the
same time but roughly in the

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.941
same period,
Caesarian period into the

00:17:52.941 --> 00:17:55.792
Augustan period--
suggests that ideas were

00:17:55.792 --> 00:18:00.009
floating back and forth between
Athens and Rome,

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:03.950
in the time of Caesar and in
the time of Augustus.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.368
Now if we look at the other
side of the gate,

00:18:06.368 --> 00:18:09.890
we see something that would
seem to confirm that even more,

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.713
and that is on the other side
caryatids replace the columns

00:18:13.713 --> 00:18:15.890
with their zoomorphic capitals.
 

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.637
These are not;
as you can clearly see--you see

00:18:18.637 --> 00:18:21.634
how they have their hands
up--they are not based exactly

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:23.650
on those of the Erechtheion
porch.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.875
They are variations of that,
but they are caryatids

00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:30.618
nonetheless, holding the
capitals on top of their heads.

00:18:30.618 --> 00:18:35.444
So we are seeing here,
even as Greece becomes Roman in

00:18:35.444 --> 00:18:39.770
the Caesarian period,
and into the age of Augustus,

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.039
even as Greece becomes Roman--
well it already does,

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.890
as I mentioned to you before
when Sulla sacks it in 86 B.C.;

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.660
so in 50 it's already a Roman
colony--

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.390
and so we can see these ideas
that are going back and forth,

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.940
between Rome and Greece,
during this important period.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.273
And we see the power of the
caryatids, even in Greece

00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:03.160
itself, as they are imitated
there as well.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.142
From this point on,
for the rest of the lecture,

00:19:06.142 --> 00:19:08.490
I do want to concentrate on
Athens.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.769
And I want to begin again with
the Acropolis.

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:14.721
This is actually a very
interesting Google Earth image

00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:16.838
of the Acropolis where you can
see--

00:19:16.838 --> 00:19:20.269
as it looks today--but where
you can see superimposed on the

00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:23.465
current--
on the present remains,

00:19:23.465 --> 00:19:27.690
3D versions of the ancient
buildings.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.538
And we can see the ones that
I've already mentioned.

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:33.496
As you enter,
over here, you see the Greek

00:19:33.496 --> 00:19:37.680
Propylaia, of the fifth century
B.C., the entrance gate.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.130
You see the Parthenon,
which is the largest building,

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.048
a Doric building,
on top of the Acropolis.

00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:46.940
And then to its left you see
the Erechtheion.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:52.048
And in the back the remains of
a museum;

00:19:52.048 --> 00:19:54.897
I mean, not the remains,
a museum, that is in part

00:19:54.897 --> 00:19:57.361
underground,
which is why it looks so flat,

00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:00.119
that houses the original
caryatids and a lot of other

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:00.808
sculpture.
 

00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:04.578
The ones that you see on the
porch today are copies of those

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.880
originals that are in the
museum,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.480
as well as other sculpture that
was found on the Acropolis.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.220
And you can also see here the
Odeion of Herodes Atticus,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.150
which I have mentioned to you,
where the Yanni concert took

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.145
place,
on the slope of the Acropolis

00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:21.640
here.
 

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.900
And then you can also see a
theater--

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.519
you see the theater in this
corner right here--

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:29.772
which is interesting because we
believe it dates to the Neronian

00:20:29.772 --> 00:20:31.848
period,
which is interesting because

00:20:31.848 --> 00:20:34.855
you'll remember that Nero
competed in the Olympic Games

00:20:34.855 --> 00:20:38.308
and that he came to Greece to
compete in the Olympic Games.

00:20:38.308 --> 00:20:40.394
So it's not surprising,
even though we don't think of

00:20:40.394 --> 00:20:42.358
him as one of the great
philhellenic emperors,

00:20:42.358 --> 00:20:46.157
it's not surprising to see that
there was some construction in

00:20:46.157 --> 00:20:48.400
Greece during the Neronian
period.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.757
I want to turn to what's
interesting actually about what

00:20:51.757 --> 00:20:54.200
the Romans do in the age of
Augustus,

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.400
when Augustus goes up here
himself,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.769
sends his architects to repair
the porch,

00:20:58.769 --> 00:21:03.702
is a decision is made to build
a little shrine to Augustus and

00:21:03.702 --> 00:21:07.019
to Rome: a Temple to Augustus
and Roma.

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:12.321
And they decide to put it in
the back left corner of the

00:21:12.321 --> 00:21:13.480
Parthenon.
 

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.492
And you can barely see it
there, but it's a small round

00:21:16.492 --> 00:21:19.338
building at the uppermost part
of the Parthenon,

00:21:19.338 --> 00:21:22.000
between that and the
museum--and I'm going to show it

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.527
to you in detail in a moment--
and they build that from

00:21:24.527 --> 00:21:24.858
scratch.
 

00:21:24.858 --> 00:21:28.621
But they also take a pillar
that is located right at the

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.969
beginning,
or right in front of the

00:21:30.969 --> 00:21:33.950
Propylaia that was put up in
Hellenistic times,

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.250
and they transform that into a
Roman monument.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.651
And it's those two,
to those two that I want to

00:21:39.651 --> 00:21:40.329
turn first.
 

00:21:40.329 --> 00:21:41.298
This is Google Earth again.
 

00:21:41.298 --> 00:21:43.361
You can see the Parthenon,
the Erechtheion,

00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:44.490
in these 3D versions.
 

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.984
Can you see just that little,
that round circle,

00:21:47.984 --> 00:21:51.108
right next to the edge of the
Parthenon?

00:21:51.108 --> 00:21:53.710
That is the Temple of Augustus
and Roma.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.851
And the fact that it is so
small I think is strikingly

00:21:56.851 --> 00:21:59.506
interesting,
because it shows that although

00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:03.038
Augustus was willing to have a
building put up to himself,

00:22:03.038 --> 00:22:05.730
and to Roma,
on the Greek Acropolis,

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.098
and so he wanted to make his
presence known,

00:22:08.098 --> 00:22:12.019
he did it in a very modest and
very respectful way,

00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:12.778
it seems to me.
 

00:22:12.778 --> 00:22:14.480
He could've built much larger
than he did,

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.275
and he opted not to do that,
which tells us something about

00:22:18.275 --> 00:22:21.808
Augustus and perhaps his
reverence for things Greek.

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:25.615
We are looking at two views of
what survives of this small

00:22:25.615 --> 00:22:28.220
round shrine -- actually quite a
bit.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.230
I mean, it's not standing any
longer,

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.970
but you can see parts of
columns and parts of the curved

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.145
entablature,
curved architrave,

00:22:36.145 --> 00:22:40.000
and some of the other building
elements very clearly here,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.849
including one of the capitals.
 

00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:43.630
Again it was a round structure.
 

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.700
It had nine Ionic columns.
 

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:51.019
It was made entirely out of
stone, and it had a sloping

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:52.298
stone roof.
 

00:22:52.298 --> 00:22:55.950
And this restored view shows us
exactly what it looked like,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.650
as well as how small it was in
relationship to the Parthenon,

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.838
which absolutely dwarfs it in
scale,

00:23:01.838 --> 00:23:03.640
as you can see in this restored
view.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.308
Here, the small Temple of
Augustus and Roma.

00:23:07.308 --> 00:23:12.713
It was built sometime after 27
B.C., and you see it here:

00:23:12.713 --> 00:23:17.250
Ionic capitals and then a
sloping stone roof.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.910
And if I show you the remains
again,

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.773
where you can see one of those
Ionic capitals still preserved

00:23:23.773 --> 00:23:26.557
here,
and we compare that Ionic

00:23:26.557 --> 00:23:32.088
capital to the Ionic capitals of
the Erechtheion in Athens,

00:23:32.088 --> 00:23:35.411
on the Acropolis,
we see the close resemblance

00:23:35.411 --> 00:23:36.740
between the two.
 

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.660
And the reason for this almost
certainly that because Augustus'

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.568
architects were working on the
Erechtheion,

00:23:43.568 --> 00:23:45.348
were restoring it,
were repairing it,

00:23:45.348 --> 00:23:48.318
they were captivated,
not just by the caryatids,

00:23:48.318 --> 00:23:52.928
but also by the rest of the
structure: by the quality of the

00:23:52.928 --> 00:23:56.891
marble,
by the attractiveness of the

00:23:56.891 --> 00:24:01.039
Ionic columns,
with their spiral volutes at

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:01.788
the top.
 

00:24:01.788 --> 00:24:06.057
And they not surprisingly used
those as the model for the

00:24:06.057 --> 00:24:10.554
capitals that they carved for
the small shrine of the Temple

00:24:10.554 --> 00:24:12.460
of Augustus and Roma.
 

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:17.016
But I think it also shows their
reverence for things Greek,

00:24:17.016 --> 00:24:21.493
and their desire to establish a
dialogue between the fifth

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:22.435
century B.C.
 

00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:26.364
structure and the Roman
structure built right after

00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:28.798
Augustus became emperor.
 

00:24:28.798 --> 00:24:32.098
I wanted to mention one other
material that is used in the

00:24:32.098 --> 00:24:32.910
Erechtheion.
 

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.261
We talked about the poros for
the foundations,

00:24:35.261 --> 00:24:37.980
the pentelic marble for the
walls and the columns.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.460
But if you look here you'll see
the slight blue cast to the

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.680
marble that is used for the
frieze.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.848
That is so-called Eleusinian
marble,

00:24:46.848 --> 00:24:49.068
from that part,
from the Eleusis area of

00:24:49.068 --> 00:24:52.368
Greece: Eleusinian marble with
this slightly blue cast,

00:24:52.368 --> 00:24:56.930
and that is used in the
Erechtheion as well.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:02.569
I mentioned that the Temple of
Roma and Augustus was put up,

00:25:02.569 --> 00:25:06.643
was built from scratch;
there was nothing there before

00:25:06.643 --> 00:25:09.450
and it was built anew during the
Augustan period.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:14.192
But I also noted that there was
another monument that we could

00:25:14.192 --> 00:25:18.781
call a Roman intervention to the
Acropolis that was actually

00:25:18.781 --> 00:25:21.714
already there,
but was transformed in Roman

00:25:21.714 --> 00:25:22.079
times.
 

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:23.240
And I show it to you now.
 

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.377
Here we are making our way,
with all of these other

00:25:26.377 --> 00:25:29.828
tourists, up to the top of the
rock of the Acropolis.

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:32.315
We've climbed up the stairway,
which is not at all--it's not

00:25:32.315 --> 00:25:33.200
particularly steep.
 

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.690
We've made our way up.
 

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.253
We're about to enter into the
Greek Propylaia of the fifth

00:25:38.253 --> 00:25:39.130
century B.C.
 

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.103
Note the Doric columns,
the triglyphs and metopes,

00:25:42.103 --> 00:25:44.410
of fifth-century Greek
architecture.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.720
And we see next to it this
pillar.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.859
It's a very interesting pillar.
 

00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:49.838
It's very prominent.
 

00:25:49.838 --> 00:25:53.009
It's the first thing you see
when you enter the Acropolis.

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:56.690
So whoever built this initially
wanted to be noticed;

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.690
that's for sure.
 

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.890
And we know it was a
Hellenistic king;

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.578
a Hellenistic king by the name
of Eumenes,

00:26:03.578 --> 00:26:08.230
E-u-m-e-n-e-s,
Eumenes II, who was king of the

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:12.470
Hellenistic Greek kingdom of
Pergamon,

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:16.311
P-e-r-g-a-m-u-m,
or -o-n --whether you use the

00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:22.880
Greek or the Latin spelling--
Pergamon, and he commissioned

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.260
this monument in 178 B.C.
 

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.828
to honor himself.
 

00:26:28.828 --> 00:26:32.364
And you can see that the
purpose of the monument was to

00:26:32.364 --> 00:26:36.160
create this pillar upon which a
statue of him would've been

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.880
placed.
 

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.720
And I show you the pillar once
again here.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.200
And you can see its shape.
 

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.960
It has a stepped base and it
tapers at the top.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.740
And you have to imagine a
statue of Eumenes II of Pergamon

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:52.519
on the top of this monument,
in the second century B.C.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:56.028
And it was altered in the first
century B.C.

00:26:56.028 --> 00:27:00.190
when Marcus Agrippa,
the close childhood friend,

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:03.558
confidant, right-hand man of
Augustus,

00:27:03.558 --> 00:27:06.865
his son-in-law,
in fact, decided to replace the

00:27:06.865 --> 00:27:09.740
statue of Eumenes with one of
himself.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.439
So he transforms this Greek
Hellenistic monument into an

00:27:13.439 --> 00:27:16.330
Augustan monument:
an Augustan monument that

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.608
honors Agrippa.
 

00:27:17.608 --> 00:27:19.442
And Agrippa,
it's not surprising to see

00:27:19.442 --> 00:27:20.890
Agrippa honored in the East.
 

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.720
He was involved in eastern
military campaigns.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:29.673
And we'll also see that he not
only--and I mentioned this

00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:35.732
earlier in the semester--he not
only instituted a building

00:27:35.732 --> 00:27:39.366
program in Rome;
he was responsible for the

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:42.150
so-called Baths of Agrippa that
bear his name--

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.710
not much is preserved so I
didn't show those to you--

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.078
and also a Pantheon,
the first Pantheon that I did

00:27:49.078 --> 00:27:51.364
mention,
the Pantheon that Agrippa

00:27:51.364 --> 00:27:54.653
built, that's referred to in the
inscription that Hadrian placed

00:27:54.653 --> 00:27:57.054
on the Pantheon:
"Marcus Agrippa made this

00:27:57.054 --> 00:27:59.088
building,"
as you'll recall,

00:27:59.088 --> 00:28:02.680
the Pantheon that we know had a
caryatid porch.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.817
So Agrippa in Rome is also
carrying the caryatid imagery

00:28:07.817 --> 00:28:11.180
into Rome in his building
program.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.751
But he also instituted a
building program in Athens,

00:28:13.751 --> 00:28:14.660
as we shall see.
 

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:19.299
So it was not surprising to see
him honored along with Augustus

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:22.817
on the Acropolis,
and actually in a way that was

00:28:22.817 --> 00:28:24.690
much more noticeable.
 

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:28.026
To be hit by that statue of
Agrippa as you climbed the

00:28:28.026 --> 00:28:31.550
Acropolis and went into the
Propylaia must have been very

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.808
striking indeed.
 

00:28:32.808 --> 00:28:36.602
This particular structure is
made of a different kind of

00:28:36.602 --> 00:28:39.358
Greek marble called hymettian
marble,

00:28:39.358 --> 00:28:42.940
h-y-m-e-t-t-i-a-n,
from Mount Hymettus:

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.730
hymettian marble.
 

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.111
You can see a little bit of
pentelic here,

00:28:47.111 --> 00:28:49.259
but much of it is hymettian
marble.

00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:53.231
So the Romans using--the Greeks
and the Romans using a variety

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:56.942
of marbles, but a variety of
marbles that come from Greece

00:28:56.942 --> 00:28:59.068
itself;
we're not talking about

00:28:59.068 --> 00:29:02.380
imported marbles from elsewhere
in the ancient world.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.180
I mentioned already that below
the Acropolis was the Greek

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.778
Agora, or the meeting or
marketplace.

00:29:08.778 --> 00:29:13.138
I show to you here a view from
Google Earth of the Greek Agora,

00:29:13.138 --> 00:29:15.460
as it looks from the air today.
 

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.440
You can see it is essentially
an open rectangular space.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.680
It has colonnades on some of
its sides;

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.098
one set was re-erected.
 

00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:28.980
This is a structure,
a covered colonnade,

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.924
that comes from the Hellenistic
period that was re-erected by

00:29:32.924 --> 00:29:37.001
American archaeologists who were
responsible for excavating the

00:29:37.001 --> 00:29:37.660
agora.
 

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.431
They re-erected it,
in part, to use as a place to

00:29:40.431 --> 00:29:43.259
display works of art and for
offices and so on.

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:49.529
But there was more than one in
Greek times.

00:29:49.529 --> 00:29:53.410
And this stoa is the
counterpart to a Roman portico;

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.654
a covered colonnade,
but they called them

00:29:55.654 --> 00:29:59.132
stoas. So we look at the
stoa here, from the Hellenistic

00:29:59.132 --> 00:29:59.750
period.
 

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.865
There's a Classical Greek
temple, the Hephaisteion over

00:30:02.865 --> 00:30:03.269
here.
 

00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:08.750
And in the center there is a
building called the--

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.162
a music hall,
that was built by Marcus

00:30:11.162 --> 00:30:13.316
Agrippa,
the so-called Odeion of

00:30:13.316 --> 00:30:17.000
Agrippa, that we know quite a
bit about and that we're going

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.250
to look at today.
 

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.068
But again what's particularly
interesting,

00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:23.507
I think, is the fact that we
see the Greeks building their

00:30:23.507 --> 00:30:25.980
religious structures on the
Acropolis,

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.009
and then down below the meeting
and marketplace.

00:30:29.009 --> 00:30:32.480
And you can see the impact that
this sort of thinking must have

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.673
had on the Romans when they made
their own decisions about

00:30:35.673 --> 00:30:37.130
building Roman forums.
 

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.060
But there are distinct
differences--and we've talked

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.164
about them already this
semester--between a Greek agora

00:30:43.164 --> 00:30:44.430
and a Roman forum.
 

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.667
What Greek agoras do not have
is that central,

00:30:47.667 --> 00:30:51.050
that focus of having a single
temple on one end,

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.930
dominating the space in front
of it.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.672
And they're more square,
whereas Roman forums,

00:30:56.672 --> 00:30:59.659
as we've discussed,
are more rectangular in shape,

00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:02.278
with again the temple at the
short end.

00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:06.303
Any of you who've been to
Athens know that the Agora is

00:31:06.303 --> 00:31:09.880
surrounded by an area of Athens
called Plaka,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.200
P-l-a-k-a, Plaka,
a great place--a fun place to

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.670
go.
 

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:18.836
It has been very gentrified in
recent years and now has these

00:31:18.836 --> 00:31:22.308
wonderful pastel colored
restaurants and shops,

00:31:22.308 --> 00:31:25.078
with the ubiquitous white
umbrellas,

00:31:25.078 --> 00:31:28.288
just as you see them in other
Mediterranean countries like

00:31:28.288 --> 00:31:28.740
Italy.
 

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.747
I lived in Athens for two years
in the 1970s,

00:31:32.747 --> 00:31:36.390
and Plaka did not look like
that then.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.794
But it was an incredible place
to go then, as it still is now,

00:31:39.794 --> 00:31:43.086
if you want to really get into
the Greek spirit and dance on

00:31:43.086 --> 00:31:44.650
tables and break plates.
 

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.750
You could definitely do that in
the '70s;

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:50.911
a little less ubiquitous today,
but there are still places that

00:31:50.911 --> 00:31:54.670
one can find to sort of play
Zorba the Greek in Plaka.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.410
Here is another view,
a panoramic view,

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:01.670
showing once again the Agora,
the Greek Agora of Athens,

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.637
as it would have looked as it
grew up from the Classical

00:32:05.637 --> 00:32:08.019
through the Hellenistic period.
 

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:11.353
But the building in question
for us is the one that is smack

00:32:11.353 --> 00:32:14.460
in the middle of the Greek
temple and of the Hellenistic

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.352
stoa over here,
and that is this music hall,

00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:21.813
or Odeion of Agrippa,
which was put up we believe in

00:32:21.813 --> 00:32:23.318
around 15 B.C.
 

00:32:23.318 --> 00:32:26.368
And it's to that structure that
I want to turn now.

00:32:26.368 --> 00:32:27.909
And this building,
this odeion,

00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:29.858
which Agrippa commissioned
himself,

00:32:29.858 --> 00:32:33.144
is very important to us in
large part because it

00:32:33.144 --> 00:32:37.269
demonstrates that ideas were not
only flowing from Greece to

00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:39.931
Rome,
as we've already both discussed

00:32:39.931 --> 00:32:43.259
today and in the past,
but from Italy to Greece.

00:32:43.259 --> 00:32:45.578
And this is a prime example of
that.

00:32:45.578 --> 00:32:49.394
Because if we look at this
axonometric view of the Odeion

00:32:49.394 --> 00:32:52.327
of Agrippa,
as designed for Agrippa,

00:32:52.327 --> 00:32:55.232
in 15 B.C.--
and this in Ward-Perkins--if we

00:32:55.232 --> 00:32:58.233
look at that,
we will see that the plan of

00:32:58.233 --> 00:33:02.765
the Odeion of Agrippa is based
very closely on an odeion that

00:33:02.765 --> 00:33:05.559
we've already seen this
semester,

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:07.368
the Odeion of Pompeii.
 

00:33:07.368 --> 00:33:10.630
You see it here from the air,
next to the Theater of Pompeii.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:14.490
You'll remember that the Odeion
of Pompeii dated to 80 to 70

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:17.828
B.C. It was quite early,
built just after the Romans

00:33:17.828 --> 00:33:19.990
made Pompeii into a colony.
 

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.769
And it is that exact plan that
is used here.

00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:25.920
So clearly again an important
exchange going on,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.259
of ideas, of architects,
between Greece and Rome,

00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:34.991
in the Augustan period,
and in this case using an

00:33:34.991 --> 00:33:37.869
Italian plan,
a plan from Italy,

00:33:37.869 --> 00:33:40.759
as the basis for a structure in
Greece.

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:44.162
We see that it follows in the
main--it follows all the

00:33:44.162 --> 00:33:47.500
features of the Pompeian
structure: the semi-circular

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.246
orchestra;
the cavea,

00:33:49.246 --> 00:33:52.348
divided into cunei;
a stage front here;

00:33:52.348 --> 00:33:57.910
pilasters, tall pilasters,
on some of the walls;

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.900
an open stoa on this wall over
here.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.039
You can see two sets of
columns, an inner row and an

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:04.778
outer row.
 

00:34:04.778 --> 00:34:08.264
We know that the spectators
entered the structure through

00:34:08.264 --> 00:34:11.750
this porch when they were coming
to a musical recital.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:16.813
And over here there was another
entranceway that was used by the

00:34:16.813 --> 00:34:20.429
musicians and also by visiting
dignitaries.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:24.755
This was a smaller entranceway
that was made up of a small

00:34:24.755 --> 00:34:27.639
temple front,
with a pediment and Doric

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:28.929
columns here.
 

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:33.731
And we can also see tall
pilasters on the outside of this

00:34:33.731 --> 00:34:34.760
structure.
 

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.202
And, of course,
this building,

00:34:37.202 --> 00:34:40.318
as all odeia,
was roofed in antiquity,

00:34:40.318 --> 00:34:44.106
for the acoustics,
and the one in Pompeii was,

00:34:44.106 --> 00:34:46.550
of course, also roofed.
 

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:50.284
Another view,
a cross-section of the Odeion

00:34:50.284 --> 00:34:52.905
of Agrippa--
you can see it here--which

00:34:52.905 --> 00:34:55.976
shows you the same sort of
thing: the tall pilasters on the

00:34:55.976 --> 00:35:00.503
outside of the structure;
the entranceway through this

00:35:00.503 --> 00:35:05.213
stoa for the spectators;
the other entranceway over

00:35:05.213 --> 00:35:09.894
here, the smaller entranceway
into that part of the structure,

00:35:09.894 --> 00:35:11.659
all very well shown.
 

00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:15.092
And maybe, and this may even be
better, this model of the Odeion

00:35:15.092 --> 00:35:18.144
of Agrippa, where we can see
what it looked like from the

00:35:18.144 --> 00:35:18.800
outside.
 

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.639
We're looking at the northern
end, which is the end where we

00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:25.827
have that small entranceway,
with the--very simple

00:35:25.827 --> 00:35:27.780
temple-like in appearance.
 

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.199
We can see a series of columns
engaged into the wall down here;

00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:36.190
then the very tall pilasters,
with windows between them.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.650
A quite conventional building,
but one again clearly basing--

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.777
this is the most important
point that one can make about

00:35:41.777 --> 00:35:44.496
it--
clearly based on an earlier

00:35:44.496 --> 00:35:45.969
model in Italy.
 

00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:48.010
The capitals are interesting.
 

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:52.356
You remember the stoas,
the two open colonnades that I

00:35:52.356 --> 00:35:55.556
showed you as one wall--
one side of the building,

00:35:55.556 --> 00:35:57.010
the inner one and the outer
one,

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:00.070
the--I'm going to forget which
way--

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.510
the outer one,
I believe--no,

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:06.380
the outer one I think is the--
there are two different orders.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.920
One of them is Corinthian,
as you can see here.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.130
I think that's the outer,
but I may have that backwards.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.789
One of them had Corinthian
capitals,

00:36:13.789 --> 00:36:17.900
and you see those here,
with the narrow--

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.239
the elegant volutes growing out
of--

00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:23.289
the elegant spirals growing out
of the acanthus leaves.

00:36:23.289 --> 00:36:26.849
And the other is of this type;
a type that we have seen

00:36:26.849 --> 00:36:30.338
before, but not frequently,
where we have lotus leaves

00:36:30.338 --> 00:36:32.840
growing out of the acanthus
leaves.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.800
And that, of course,
is a kind of capital that we

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.639
mentioned is inspired by
capitals in Egypt,

00:36:38.639 --> 00:36:42.469
and was used also much later,
in much later times,

00:36:42.469 --> 00:36:47.483
at the Forum at Leptis Magna,
the Severan Forum at Leptis

00:36:47.483 --> 00:36:48.199
Magna.
 

00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:53.541
So a type of capital that is
characteristic of Egypt,

00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:55.699
that turns up here.
 

00:36:55.699 --> 00:36:59.913
So it's another example of the
way in which these architects

00:36:59.913 --> 00:37:04.268
and patrons are looking at
models from all over the world--

00:37:04.268 --> 00:37:08.730
not only the odeion in Pompeii,
but also structures from

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.576
Egypt--
and combining those motifs in a

00:37:12.576 --> 00:37:14.242
very--
in a new way,

00:37:14.242 --> 00:37:18.539
in a very fertile mix,
as you can see.

00:37:18.539 --> 00:37:21.768
With regard to the later
history of the Odeion of

00:37:21.768 --> 00:37:23.913
Agrippa,
over the years students

00:37:23.913 --> 00:37:26.623
sometimes have asked me--
I haven't heard--gotten this

00:37:26.623 --> 00:37:29.291
question this semester yet--
but students have asked me,

00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:31.849
or have said to me:
"Professor Kleiner,

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:33.840
you show us,
in the course of this semester,

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.266
all of these great works of
Roman engineering and

00:37:37.266 --> 00:37:40.396
architecture--
the Pantheon and the Colosseum

00:37:40.396 --> 00:37:42.980
and aqueducts and so on and so
forth--

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.170
and everything--you do tell us
about fires,

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.650
that fires sometimes destroy
these works of art,

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:51.061
or works of architecture are
destroyed because other natural

00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:53.300
events,
like events of nature like

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.768
earthquakes and so on.
 

00:37:54.768 --> 00:37:58.070
But you never tell us about the
buildings that failed.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.257
Were the Roman architects
always successful,

00:38:00.257 --> 00:38:03.360
or did they build buildings
sometimes that fell down?"

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.210
And so I always use this as an
example.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.960
Because yes,
they sometimes did make

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.559
mistakes and some of their
buildings did collapse.

00:38:10.559 --> 00:38:13.260
And this is one of them,
the Odeion of Agrippa.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.144
After it was viewed and
described by Pausanias,

00:38:17.144 --> 00:38:20.300
the roof collapsed;
collapsed entirely.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:25.152
Now it had lasted quite awhile,
from the time of Augustus to

00:38:25.152 --> 00:38:27.293
the time--
to the second century of

00:38:27.293 --> 00:38:29.166
Pausanias,
but nonetheless the roof

00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:31.934
collapsed entirely,
and the roof had to be

00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:33.420
completely rebuilt.
 

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.945
And at the same time the
architects decided to modernize

00:38:37.945 --> 00:38:41.976
the northern end of the
structure and to add a new

00:38:41.976 --> 00:38:44.280
portico to the building.
 

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.699
They also changed its use,
by the way, from an odeion to a

00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:50.280
general lecture hall,
during that period.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.529
So in 150 A.D.
 

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:56.079
we see that the northern end is
completely redone.

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.480
And it's interesting to see
what they decided to do.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.460
They replaced that very small,
conservative,

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.599
Doric entryway with something
with a lot more pizzazz,

00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:08.050
as you can see:
a series of male figures--

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.480
these are male tritons,
t-r-i-t-o-n-s,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.460
tritons, which are essentially
male mermaids,

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.422
male tritons;
tritons that are essentially

00:39:17.422 --> 00:39:20.427
male mermaids--on these tall
decorated bases,

00:39:20.427 --> 00:39:22.000
as you can see here.
 

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.590
And their gestures are mirror
images of one another,

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.668
or reversed images of one
another, which creates a certain

00:39:29.668 --> 00:39:32.619
liveliness to the façade,
to the northern façade,

00:39:32.619 --> 00:39:35.550
that this building did not have
before.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.429
And that happened again in the
mid-second century A.D.

00:39:38.429 --> 00:39:42.668
And interestingly enough,
much of what survives today are

00:39:42.668 --> 00:39:43.880
those tritons.
 

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.952
You can still see them on their
bases here, on their tall bases,

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:49.440
or part of them here.
 

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.543
And you can see the
relationship of the Odeion of

00:39:52.543 --> 00:39:55.907
Agrippa, in this very good
image, to the Acropolis in

00:39:55.907 --> 00:39:56.619
Athens.
 

00:39:56.619 --> 00:40:00.090
You can see the Erechtheion
peeping up over there.

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:04.291
You can see the great pedestal
that Agrippa would've had his

00:40:04.291 --> 00:40:06.000
statue on, right here.
 

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.250
So I'm very tempted to say--in
fact I will say--

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:11.050
that I don't think that was
lost on the designers,

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:15.690
that when they chose this spot
for the Odeion of Agrippa they

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:19.789
had very much in mind that it
would be in one of these

00:40:19.789 --> 00:40:24.199
interesting architectural
dialogues with the pedestal that

00:40:24.199 --> 00:40:29.460
had the statue of Agrippa at the
entranceway to the Acropolis.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.710
I think that was certainly very
carefully orchestrated,

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:37.030
in the same way you'll remember
Julius Caesar and his architects

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.733
orchestrated a relationship
between the Temple of Venus

00:40:40.733 --> 00:40:44.505
Genetrix and the Temple of
Jupiter OMC on the Capitoline

00:40:44.505 --> 00:40:45.809
Hill in Rome.
 

00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:49.300
Despite the fact that you see,
when you visit the Agora,

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.300
the Greek Agora today,
and look at these statues,

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.880
despite the fact that they are
all that stands,

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.072
there's a lot,
you will see that there're lots

00:40:56.072 --> 00:40:59.456
of other remains on the ground,
and with those remains and the

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:02.853
excavations that were done by
the American archaeologists in

00:41:02.853 --> 00:41:05.746
the 1930s,
the reconstruction that we

00:41:05.746 --> 00:41:07.755
looked at,
from Ward-Perkins,

00:41:07.755 --> 00:41:10.952
we believe is a very accurate
reconstruction of what the

00:41:10.952 --> 00:41:12.869
Odeion of Agrippa looked like.
 

00:41:12.869 --> 00:41:16.815
I want to look at the Roman
Agora, because the Romans

00:41:16.815 --> 00:41:19.699
themselves added an agora to
Athens.

00:41:19.699 --> 00:41:21.594
If they were going to have a
Greek Agora, they were going to

00:41:21.594 --> 00:41:22.268
have a Roman Agora.
 

00:41:22.268 --> 00:41:24.190
We don't know if there was a
practical need for it,

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:29.672
but I guess Caesar and Augustus
wanted to emblazon their name on

00:41:29.672 --> 00:41:32.980
an agora or a marketplace in
Athens.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:36.391
It was put up again in
Caesarian and--started in the

00:41:36.391 --> 00:41:39.469
Caesarian period,
and completed by Augustus.

00:41:39.469 --> 00:41:41.670
It is right near the Greek
Agora.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.798
We see a view of it here:
a large open,

00:41:43.798 --> 00:41:46.489
rectangular space,
with a colonnade around it;

00:41:46.489 --> 00:41:50.070
in this case stoas--we would
call these stoas in the Greek

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:54.030
context--with tabernae or
shops at the uppermost part.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:58.115
An entranceway,
an elaborate entranceway on the

00:41:58.115 --> 00:42:03.269
western end, and another
entranceway on the eastern end.

00:42:03.269 --> 00:42:04.929
But as you can see it differs.
 

00:42:04.929 --> 00:42:07.800
It is done in the mode of a
Greek marketplace,

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.235
because it is more--well it's
sort of in between a square and

00:42:11.235 --> 00:42:14.882
a rectangle here,
but it's not as long as a Roman

00:42:14.882 --> 00:42:18.016
forum,
and it does not have a temple

00:42:18.016 --> 00:42:19.559
on one short end.
 

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:23.460
So it follows in the mode of
Greek agoras,

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.840
rather than Roman fora.
 

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.206
You can see,
if you look at Google Earth,

00:42:29.206 --> 00:42:34.005
one can see the forum today,
the Roman--here's the Stoa of

00:42:34.005 --> 00:42:36.699
Attalos, in the Greek Agora.
 

00:42:36.699 --> 00:42:40.422
So you can see its proximity to
this new Roman Agora that was

00:42:40.422 --> 00:42:40.920
added.
 

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.170
We're looking at that open
space here, with the colonnades.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:48.364
We're looking at the western
entranceway, as well as the

00:42:48.364 --> 00:42:52.789
eastern entranceway up above,
in this very helpful view.

00:42:52.789 --> 00:42:55.710
And this is a view I took from
the Acropolis,

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:02.168
looking down on the Roman Agora
and showing the back of the

00:43:02.168 --> 00:43:06.213
western entranceway,
which I'll show you from the

00:43:06.213 --> 00:43:07.219
front in a moment.
 

00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:10.719
And there you can see Plaka
actually pre-gentrification.

00:43:10.719 --> 00:43:13.778
It gives you a sense of what--I
mean, it was really crumbling,

00:43:13.778 --> 00:43:16.036
as you can see,
some of the buildings that are

00:43:16.036 --> 00:43:16.989
surrounding it.
 

00:43:16.989 --> 00:43:19.780
But nonetheless it was fun.
 

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.269
So here we go.
 

00:43:21.269 --> 00:43:26.860
This is a view of the gate;
it's called the Gate of Athena

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.476
Archegetis, as you can see on
your Monument List,

00:43:30.476 --> 00:43:34.170
that is the western gate into
the Roman Agora.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.570
We see it here in two views.
 

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.739
And you can see,
when you look at this building,

00:43:37.739 --> 00:43:43.376
you can see what Ward-Perkins
and others mean when they say

00:43:43.376 --> 00:43:47.369
that architecture in Athens,
under the Romans,

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:49.099
is derivative and uninspired.
 

00:43:49.099 --> 00:43:52.289
It's this kind of thing that I
believe he's talking about.

00:43:52.289 --> 00:43:55.860
Because you can see how
beholden it is to traditional

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.869
Classical Greek architecture,
in the way in which we see

00:43:59.869 --> 00:44:03.568
these great Doric columns,
looking very similar to those

00:44:03.568 --> 00:44:05.679
of the Propylaia or the
Parthenon.

00:44:05.679 --> 00:44:07.099
You see them here.
 

00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:09.139
You see the triglyphs and
metopes.

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:12.090
You see a triangular pediment.
 

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.688
We never see,
we never see the Greeks--at

00:44:14.688 --> 00:44:18.000
least the Greeks in the Roman
period--breaking their

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.909
pediments.
 

00:44:18.909 --> 00:44:22.293
They always have complete
pediments, and in that sense,

00:44:22.293 --> 00:44:26.117
of course, a very conservative
approach to architecture during

00:44:26.117 --> 00:44:27.119
this period.
 

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:30.012
We know that this,
the gate, was begun by Caesar,

00:44:30.012 --> 00:44:31.460
completed by Augustus.
 

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.329
And there's an inscription that
tells us that.

00:44:34.329 --> 00:44:37.329
And we believe--although this
is somewhat speculative--

00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:41.572
that there may have been a
statue or portrait of the

00:44:41.572 --> 00:44:44.641
grandson of Augustus,
son of Agrippa,

00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:47.070
Lucius Caesar,
in the pediment --

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:51.630
Lucius Caesar having died in
the year 2.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.617
Here's a view where we see the
Roman Agora as it looks today:

00:44:56.617 --> 00:44:59.599
the open space;
the columns around it.

00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:02.724
And you can also see this very
curious building,

00:45:02.724 --> 00:45:06.715
that looks very well preserved,
rising up on the eastern end,

00:45:06.715 --> 00:45:09.510
a building in the shape of an
octagon.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.648
And here's another view of the
eastern end, showing that

00:45:12.648 --> 00:45:14.590
octagonal building more clearly.
 

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:17.844
This is the so-called
Horologion of Andronikos,

00:45:17.844 --> 00:45:21.239
or as it is nicknamed,
the Tower of the Winds;

00:45:21.239 --> 00:45:23.882
the Tower of the Winds,
which is easier to remember,

00:45:23.882 --> 00:45:25.179
the Tower of the Winds.
 

00:45:25.179 --> 00:45:28.429
It's very controversial in date.
 

00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:32.443
I date it here to the second
half of the first century B.C.,

00:45:32.443 --> 00:45:35.369
which is when I do believe that
it dates.

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:37.849
But there are others who think
otherwise, and I'll tell you

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:38.920
about that in a moment.
 

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.739
Here's a view that I took from
the Acropolis,

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:45.139
showing the Tower of the Winds
as it looks from up there,

00:45:45.139 --> 00:45:48.860
as well as a closer view of
this amazing structure.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.829
Again, you can see how well
preserved it is.

00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:53.349
You can see that it is indeed
eight-sided.

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:55.809
You can see one of the porches.
 

00:45:55.809 --> 00:46:00.039
There are two porches that had
temple fronts with triangular

00:46:00.039 --> 00:46:03.409
pediments, columns below,
on those two sides.

00:46:03.409 --> 00:46:06.900
There was also a staircase that
surrounded the structure.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:11.766
What this was we believe is
some kind of a clock tower,

00:46:11.766 --> 00:46:14.559
a very inventive clock tower.
 

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:19.434
And although again I think it
was probably built in the

00:46:19.434 --> 00:46:22.655
Caesarian period,
late Republic,

00:46:22.655 --> 00:46:27.510
John Camp, who's an expert on
things Athenian,

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.849
who wrote a book on the
archaeology of Athens,

00:46:29.849 --> 00:46:34.050
who has been excavating the
Greek Agora since the 1970s and

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:38.539
is a true expert of architecture
in this part of the world,

00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:40.659
he thinks the date is earlier
than that.

00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:44.864
He dates it to 150 to 125 B.C.,
and he brings it into

00:46:44.864 --> 00:46:48.260
connection with the Ptolemies of
Egypt,

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:52.807
the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt,
because of their great interest

00:46:52.807 --> 00:46:56.760
in the telling of time and the
fact that they did have

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.010
important connections with
Athens during this period.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:03.239
I think he has a point;
he could be right.

00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:07.300
But I would add that
connections with Egypt were very

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:10.268
strong in the late Republic as
well;

00:47:10.268 --> 00:47:15.012
I mean, keep in mind the affair
between Julius Caesar and

00:47:15.012 --> 00:47:16.030
Cleopatra.
 

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.934
Keep in mind that we know that
statues of Cleopatra and Mark

00:47:19.934 --> 00:47:22.250
Antony were put on the
Acropolis.

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.018
We know that there was a lot of
interaction.

00:47:24.018 --> 00:47:27.409
Cleopatra herself came to
Athens.

00:47:27.409 --> 00:47:30.815
So I don't think it's
inconceivable that if one wants

00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:34.550
to connect this to things
Egyptian, that one couldn't date

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.909
it also to the Caesarian period.
 

00:47:36.909 --> 00:47:39.771
But whatever its date,
it's fascinating in its own

00:47:39.771 --> 00:47:41.989
right, again because it's
octagonal.

00:47:41.989 --> 00:47:45.369
We've talked about the fact
that we don't have octagons in

00:47:45.369 --> 00:47:47.150
Rome until the time of Nero.
 

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:48.800
But we do see them.
 

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.570
You saw another example,
also in Leptis Magna,

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.219
the market there,
of the Augustan period.

00:47:54.219 --> 00:47:57.090
It's interesting to see this
form emerging--

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.329
possibly under Ptolemaic
influence,

00:47:59.329 --> 00:48:02.429
we're not sure--emerging in the
provinces,

00:48:02.429 --> 00:48:06.030
before it seems to emerge in
Rome itself,

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:07.949
and this being another example.
 

00:48:07.949 --> 00:48:10.460
Here's a view of the monument
again,

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:14.606
but also compared to an
engraving done by Stuart and

00:48:14.606 --> 00:48:17.405
Revett,
S-t-u-a-r-t and R-e-v-e-t-t,

00:48:17.405 --> 00:48:21.451
Stuart and Revett who made
drawings of monuments that were

00:48:21.451 --> 00:48:24.820
in better shape in Athens,
in the eighteenth century.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.699
And what this tells us,
besides showing us what the

00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:30.523
porch looked like--
and you can see it well

00:48:30.523 --> 00:48:34.525
here--it also shows us that
there was a weathervane on the

00:48:34.525 --> 00:48:38.597
top that would have gone in the
direction of the prevailing

00:48:38.597 --> 00:48:39.369
winds.
 

00:48:39.369 --> 00:48:42.105
And the reason that we call
this the Tower of the Winds is

00:48:42.105 --> 00:48:44.552
not only because of that
weathervane that once stood

00:48:44.552 --> 00:48:46.641
there,
but also because of the

00:48:46.641 --> 00:48:50.034
depictions of male
personifications of the winds on

00:48:50.034 --> 00:48:52.480
all eight sides of the
structure.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.458
And those are extremely well
preserved, as you can see here:

00:48:56.458 --> 00:48:58.550
a frieze of these male winds.
 

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:02.204
And if you look carefully at
the Stuart and Revett drawing,

00:49:02.204 --> 00:49:05.858
you also see that there was a
sundial on all eight sides of

00:49:05.858 --> 00:49:08.054
the monument;
so its purpose,

00:49:08.054 --> 00:49:10.380
needless to say,
to tell time.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:15.188
The capitals from those porches
are these lotus leaves growing

00:49:15.188 --> 00:49:17.159
out of acanthus leaves.
 

00:49:17.159 --> 00:49:21.597
So another Egyptian touch here,
this looking back to

00:49:21.597 --> 00:49:25.871
Egyptian-type capitals,
using them here -- the same

00:49:25.871 --> 00:49:30.340
kind of capitals that we know
had turned up much later at the

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.800
Severan Forum in Leptis Magna.
 

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:37.001
A detail of those winds;
and here a better detail of at

00:49:37.001 --> 00:49:39.701
least one of them,
to show you what they looked

00:49:39.701 --> 00:49:40.699
like close up.
 

00:49:40.699 --> 00:49:42.820
And each one of them has a
different attribute,

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.766
which has led scholars
obviously to speculate about

00:49:46.766 --> 00:49:50.400
which particular wind,
which of the cardinal points of

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.887
the compass,
which wind they were in

00:49:52.887 --> 00:49:55.032
actuality;
we won't get into those

00:49:55.032 --> 00:49:57.599
arguments here,
but there's been a lot of time

00:49:57.599 --> 00:50:00.340
spent by scholars on trying to
sort that out.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.128
What is also interesting is the
interior of the building,

00:50:03.128 --> 00:50:05.170
which is also extremely well
preserved.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.469
And you can see here,
all in stone,

00:50:07.469 --> 00:50:10.579
the way in which the octagon
becomes a dome.

00:50:10.579 --> 00:50:14.969
And it is done extremely well,
and one--

00:50:14.969 --> 00:50:18.869
I mean, this goes way beyond
any kind of stone dome that we

00:50:18.869 --> 00:50:21.693
see,
either in Etruscan or Roman

00:50:21.693 --> 00:50:23.699
architecture in Italy.
 

00:50:23.699 --> 00:50:26.710
And it shows us--once again,
it underscores,

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:29.739
more than anything else I could
show you,

00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:34.081
the talent of these particular
architects who had been carving

00:50:34.081 --> 00:50:38.987
this Greek stone for centuries;
the way in which they are able

00:50:38.987 --> 00:50:44.018
to make this transition from
octagonal shape to regular dome

00:50:44.018 --> 00:50:46.150
here is extraordinary.
 

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:51.043
They did not need concrete to
create a great dome in this

00:50:51.043 --> 00:50:55.326
wonderful structure,
the Horologion of Andronikos,

00:50:55.326 --> 00:50:58.909
or the Tower of the Winds,
in Athens.

00:50:58.909 --> 00:51:01.809
The other great philhellenic
emperor was of course Hadrian.

00:51:01.809 --> 00:51:04.871
We know Hadrian came to Athens
on three occasions,

00:51:04.871 --> 00:51:07.619
and we know the exact dates of
his visits.

00:51:07.619 --> 00:51:12.157
The first visit,
124 to 125, Hadrian was in

00:51:12.157 --> 00:51:13.130
Athens.
 

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:18.786
He came another time in 128,
and he came a third time in 131

00:51:18.786 --> 00:51:19.650
to 132.
 

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:23.039
And all the buildings that I'm
now going to show you date to,

00:51:23.039 --> 00:51:25.639
roughly, to the times of those
three visits.

00:51:25.639 --> 00:51:28.579
The first one you see in an
engraving here.

00:51:28.579 --> 00:51:30.630
This was an aqueduct.
 

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:34.673
When Hadrian came to Athens for
the first time in 124 to 125,

00:51:34.673 --> 00:51:38.313
he said, "We need to
supply water to the people of

00:51:38.313 --> 00:51:39.460
Athens."
 

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:44.581
And so he set his architects at
work to build an aqueduct for

00:51:44.581 --> 00:51:45.349
Athens.
 

00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:49.137
They created a reservoir on
Mount Lycabettus,

00:51:49.137 --> 00:51:53.099
the highest mountain in Athens;
a reservoir.

00:51:53.099 --> 00:51:55.094
And then on the side,
one of the sides of the

00:51:55.094 --> 00:51:57.148
mountain,
facing the city,

00:51:57.148 --> 00:52:01.389
they had--they built a kind of
a structure,

00:52:01.389 --> 00:52:09.036
a kind of a bridge that in part
carried that water into the

00:52:09.036 --> 00:52:09.960
city.
 

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.190
It no longer survives--there
are a couple of bases from it;

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.860
that's it.
 

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.150
But we do fortunately have
engravings that were made when

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:20.152
it was in better shape,
when part of it still stood,

00:52:20.152 --> 00:52:22.309
and we see one of those
engravings here.

00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:25.956
And what we can see right off,
Ionic capitals:

00:52:25.956 --> 00:52:30.739
Ionic capitals clearly based on
those of the Erechtheion.

00:52:30.739 --> 00:52:33.625
So the Erechtheion still a
beacon for architects,

00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:35.670
still a monument to be
emulated;

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:38.659
emulated in the time of
Hadrian, as it was under

00:52:38.659 --> 00:52:39.360
Augustus.
 

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.193
We see an inscription,
and then we see something quite

00:52:42.193 --> 00:52:43.050
extraordinary.
 

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:47.322
If we look very closely above
the right-hand Ionic capital,

00:52:47.322 --> 00:52:50.639
we see the beginning of an
arcuated lintel;

00:52:50.639 --> 00:52:53.550
straight lintel,
the beginning of an arcuation.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:54.780
So what does that tell us?
 

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.244
That tells us clearly--and
here's a Stuart and Revett

00:52:58.244 --> 00:53:01.643
drawing of that element,
when it was in better shape

00:53:01.643 --> 00:53:03.483
again;
a straight lintel,

00:53:03.483 --> 00:53:06.681
an arcuated lintel,
with an inscription mentioning

00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:07.400
Hadrian.
 

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.804
That is the same kind of
arcuated lintel that we saw at

00:53:11.804 --> 00:53:13.936
Tivoli,
at the Canopus,

00:53:13.936 --> 00:53:18.329
that we saw in Ephesus at the
Temple of Hadrian,

00:53:18.329 --> 00:53:21.340
in Ephesus, showing that this
particular motif,

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.954
this arcuated lintel,
very much associated with

00:53:23.954 --> 00:53:26.500
Hadrian,
says this is a Hadrianic

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.425
building essentially,
and used not just in Italy but

00:53:30.425 --> 00:53:32.510
elsewhere in the Roman world.
 

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:36.228
So again these exchanges of
ideas and motifs and artists and

00:53:36.228 --> 00:53:40.010
architects during the Hadrianic
period, as was the case under

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.829
Augustus.
 

00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:45.039
Over here we're looking again
from Google Earth at the Roman

00:53:45.039 --> 00:53:45.610
Agora.
 

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:49.117
Next to it a Library of
Hadrian, a library that bears

00:53:49.117 --> 00:53:52.221
Hadrian's name,
that was also put up in Athens,

00:53:52.221 --> 00:53:56.623
during the Hadrianic period;
specifically in 132 A.D.,

00:53:56.623 --> 00:54:01.739
connected to the last visit
that Hadrian made to Athens.

00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:04.996
We can see that it is a
great--a large open rectangular

00:54:04.996 --> 00:54:08.034
space,
with the library itself at the

00:54:08.034 --> 00:54:11.554
uppermost part,
and then a façade that

00:54:11.554 --> 00:54:14.708
has projecting columns,
and I'll show that to you

00:54:14.708 --> 00:54:15.780
better in a moment.
 

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:20.353
Here's a view I took again from
the Acropolis showing that open

00:54:20.353 --> 00:54:23.230
rectangular space,
as it looks today.

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:25.449
There's some later buildings
built into it.

00:54:25.449 --> 00:54:28.909
And here we're looking at the
back wall of the façade,

00:54:28.909 --> 00:54:31.619
which we'll see has projecting
columns on it.

00:54:31.619 --> 00:54:36.007
Here's a plan of the Library of
Hadrian of 132 here on the

00:54:36.007 --> 00:54:38.469
right-hand side of the screen.
 

00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:42.362
And you should be struck
immediately as you look at this

00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:45.849
plan,
with its open rectangular

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:50.518
space, with a pool here in the
center,

00:54:50.518 --> 00:54:52.679
with the columns going all the
way around,

00:54:52.679 --> 00:54:56.378
with an entranceway in the
front, with projecting columns

00:54:56.378 --> 00:55:00.416
on that façade,
with a series of niches that

00:55:00.416 --> 00:55:03.900
are alternating,
segmental and rectangular,

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.181
with again the library located
in that uppermost part with

00:55:08.181 --> 00:55:12.159
other rooms forming a kind of
wing on either side.

00:55:12.159 --> 00:55:14.873
This should remind you,
without any question,

00:55:14.873 --> 00:55:15.489
of this.
 

00:55:15.489 --> 00:55:20.300
And what is this?
 

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.929
Student:  The Forum of
Peace.

00:55:22.929 --> 00:55:25.733
Prof: The Forum Pacis,
the Forum of Peace,

00:55:25.733 --> 00:55:27.719
or the Templum Pacis,
of Vespasian,

00:55:27.719 --> 00:55:28.420
in Rome.
 

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.889
So once again--and it is a
near-clear duplicate.

00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:34.663
Even though this is a library
and this is a temple or a

00:55:34.663 --> 00:55:37.487
forum--although we talked about
the fact that we weren't

00:55:37.487 --> 00:55:39.440
absolutely sure how this was
used;

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.416
it may have been used as a kind
of museum in Rome for the spoils

00:55:43.416 --> 00:55:46.760
and other works of art that
Vespasian and the Flavians

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.150
wanted to display.
 

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:51.784
But once again we are
looking--the influence does not

00:55:51.784 --> 00:55:55.840
flow only from Greece to Rome,
but from Italy to Greece.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.346
And in this case they are also
using, as a model for the

00:55:59.346 --> 00:56:02.405
Library of Hadrian,
an important building type in

00:56:02.405 --> 00:56:02.980
Rome.
 

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:05.239
They're using it,
you know, perhaps in a

00:56:05.239 --> 00:56:07.791
different way,
but nonetheless they are using

00:56:07.791 --> 00:56:11.268
almost that exact plan for this
second-century building.

00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:14.766
And I show you here a model of
the Library of Hadrian in Athens

00:56:14.766 --> 00:56:17.530
where we see that it was planted
with greenery.

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:19.400
The library was located in the
back.

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.545
There was a fairly conventional
entranceway, looking like a

00:56:23.545 --> 00:56:25.190
typical Greek temple.
 

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.900
But then these columns that
project in front of the wall;

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.862
the statuary on top,
looking very much like the

00:56:31.862 --> 00:56:35.148
Forum Transitorium,
which you'll remember bordered

00:56:35.148 --> 00:56:38.168
the Forum Pacis in Rome,
and that probably was also

00:56:38.168 --> 00:56:40.159
something that they were looking
at.

00:56:40.159 --> 00:56:44.009
And here creating--this is as
far as the Greeks go to creating

00:56:44.009 --> 00:56:47.858
one of these undulating walls
with the projecting and receding

00:56:47.858 --> 00:56:48.679
elements.
 

00:56:48.679 --> 00:56:51.815
It's still fairly conservative,
but nonetheless they've

00:56:51.815 --> 00:56:54.779
injected a little motion here,
using the traditional

00:56:54.779 --> 00:56:56.579
vocabulary of architecture.
 

00:56:56.579 --> 00:57:00.530
And here we see a view of the
wall, of that façade;

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.880
what survives of it today.
 

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.889
The wall is made out of white
pentelic marble,

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:09.510
and the columns are made of a
slightly--

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:11.170
I don't know if you can see it
from where you sit--

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:13.750
but a slightly greenish tinged
marble,

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.820
that comes from a place in
Greece called Karystos,

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:19.400
K-a-r-y-s-t-o-s.
 

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.619
So again this interest in
varied marbles;

00:57:21.619 --> 00:57:25.972
varied marbles that come only
from the very rich quarries that

00:57:25.972 --> 00:57:26.900
Greece has.
 

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:31.063
They did not have to go
anywhere else to get high

00:57:31.063 --> 00:57:36.530
quality marble and to get marble
of a wide variety of colors.

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:39.869
I want to turn now to a
structure that has one of the

00:57:39.869 --> 00:57:43.404
most complicated building
histories of any building I've

00:57:43.404 --> 00:57:46.360
shown you in the course of this
semester,

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.219
and I'll run through that
relatively quickly.

00:57:49.219 --> 00:57:51.789
This is the Temple of Olympian
Zeus,

00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:54.869
the so-called Olympieion,
that was put up,

00:57:54.869 --> 00:57:59.478
or that was dedicated,
by Hadrian, in the year 131 to

00:57:59.478 --> 00:58:02.556
132,
on the occasion of his third

00:58:02.556 --> 00:58:04.050
visit to Athens.
 

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:07.550
But it had again a very long
building history.

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.742
It goes back to the Archaic
Greek period,

00:58:09.742 --> 00:58:10.840
when it was begun.
 

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.963
It was begun by the so-called
Peisistratids--I've put these

00:58:13.963 --> 00:58:16.873
words on your Monument List for
you--the Peisistratids,

00:58:16.873 --> 00:58:18.489
who were Athenian tyrants.
 

00:58:18.489 --> 00:58:22.458
They began to build it in the
Archaic period as a Doric

00:58:22.458 --> 00:58:23.119
temple.
 

00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:27.309
The construction was stopped,
however, at the end of the

00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:29.518
sixth century B.C.,
in 510.

00:58:29.518 --> 00:58:32.610
It was resumed in the
Hellenistic period,

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:38.130
in 174 B.C.,
when Antiochos Epiphanes--

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:40.150
and his name is also on the
Monument List--

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.349
Antiochos Epiphanes,
a king of Syria,

00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:46.766
decided to employ a Roman
architect by the name of

00:58:46.766 --> 00:58:49.715
Cossutius--
also on your Monument List--to

00:58:49.715 --> 00:58:52.329
finish the building;
a Roman architect.

00:58:52.329 --> 00:58:55.384
That's interesting that we see
a Greek Hellenistic ruler hiring

00:58:55.384 --> 00:58:58.295
a Roman architect;
speaks to that exchange again

00:58:58.295 --> 00:58:59.489
that is going on.
 

00:58:59.489 --> 00:59:04.295
He, Cossutius,
decides to use the Corinthian

00:59:04.295 --> 00:59:06.360
order;
the Corinthian order.

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:10.519
And he finishes it up to the
architrave, the building up to

00:59:10.519 --> 00:59:11.739
the architrave.
 

00:59:11.739 --> 00:59:20.639
And when Antiochos dies in
164--that's where he's up to;

00:59:20.639 --> 00:59:23.682
that's where -- 164 they built
the building up through the

00:59:23.682 --> 00:59:25.820
architrave using the Corinthian
order.

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.809
Sulla sacks Athens in 86 B.C.
 

00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:31.630
And you'll remember what Sulla
does.

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:35.041
This is that very temple,
with the 55-foot tall columns,

00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:38.329
that Sulla eyes and says,
"I want those."

00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:42.726
And he brings several of those
back to Rome,

00:59:42.726 --> 00:59:48.860
to be used in his renovation of
the Temple of Jupiter OMC;

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:50.059
those very columns.
 

00:59:50.059 --> 00:59:53.994
It was the introduction of
those Corinthian columns and

00:59:53.994 --> 00:59:58.585
capitals to Rome that made that
the most popular capital in Rome

00:59:58.585 --> 01:00:01.639
and in the Roman Empire,
as we've seen.

01:00:01.639 --> 01:00:03.909
Augustus wanted to complete the
structure.

01:00:03.909 --> 01:00:07.092
He did not do so,
and it was left to Hadrian to

01:00:07.092 --> 01:00:11.454
finish it, and Hadrian finished
it according to Cossutius' plan,

01:00:11.454 --> 01:00:12.699
in 131 to 132.
 

01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:18.565
And what Hadrian did was put in
this structure statues of

01:00:18.565 --> 01:00:23.382
himself and Zeus--Zeus,
the Greek equivalent to

01:00:23.382 --> 01:00:27.063
Jupiter;
statues of Hadrian in one part

01:00:27.063 --> 01:00:30.070
of the structure,
to Zeus in the other part of

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:31.864
the structure,
and tons and tons,

01:00:31.864 --> 01:00:35.900
lots and lots of statues,
additional statues of Hadrian

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.219
outside the temple in the
courtyard.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:43.920
And you see this temple here,
as finished by Hadrian,

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.260
as it would've looked in the
Hadrianic period.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.757
You can see that like a typical
Greek temple,

01:00:50.757 --> 01:00:53.425
as opposed to a Roman temple,
it does not have a

01:00:53.425 --> 01:00:55.130
façade orientation.
 

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:59.230
It has two entranceways,
one with a statue of Hadrian,

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:02.789
one with a statue of Zeus,
and that it has columns that

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:06.657
encircle the entire monument--
a peripertal colonnade--as well

01:01:06.657 --> 01:01:09.210
as a staircase that goes all the
way around.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:12.300
So a typical Greek temple;
131 to 132.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.380
It's the same time that we see
the Temple of Venus and Roma

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.639
going up in Rome;
what I described as a Greek

01:01:17.639 --> 01:01:18.010
import.
 

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.940
Hadrian is responsible for both.
 

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.311
And so we see again this
important interchange between

01:01:24.311 --> 01:01:27.199
the two, at this particular
time.

01:01:27.199 --> 01:01:30.554
A view of what survives of the
Olympieion, its columns,

01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:34.346
its Corinthian columns--you can
see the small people wandering

01:01:34.346 --> 01:01:36.500
around;
so this is a very large

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.250
structure--that I took from the
Acropolis.

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:43.161
Once again here's a wonderful
Google Earth version of the

01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:45.724
Olympieon,
this combination of what it

01:01:45.724 --> 01:01:48.465
looks like today,
with sort of this 3D imaging

01:01:48.465 --> 01:01:51.449
that makes it look also like it
looked in antiquity.

01:01:51.449 --> 01:01:54.277
Here you see some of the
columns of the Olympieon,

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:56.010
the ones that still survive.
 

01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:59.250
They are incredibly large and
incredibly handsome.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:01.041
And I think,
when you look at the high

01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:03.443
quality of the carving,
you are struck,

01:02:03.443 --> 01:02:07.865
as I am, at why the Romans
decided the Corinthian order was

01:02:07.865 --> 01:02:11.559
the order for them,
when they saw these exact

01:02:11.559 --> 01:02:16.369
columns on the Temple of Jupiter
Optimus Maximus Capitolinus in

01:02:16.369 --> 01:02:16.989
Rome.
 

01:02:16.989 --> 01:02:19.829
When Hadrian made his visit to
Athens,

01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:22.989
the last visit to Athens,
in the 130s,

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:27.110
the city busily--benefactors
busily got together to put up an

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:30.889
arch that would be ready for
Hadrian when he arrived.

01:02:30.889 --> 01:02:33.065
And that he could parade
through, and that is the

01:02:33.065 --> 01:02:35.277
so-called Arch of Hadrian,
which you see here,

01:02:35.277 --> 01:02:37.170
in a view of what it looks like
today,

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.876
and in a Stuart and Revett
drawing on the right-hand side

01:02:39.876 --> 01:02:40.650
of the screen.
 

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.916
Again, a quite conservative
arch: a very simple,

01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:49.210
single arcuation in the center;
pilasters done with Corinthian

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:51.789
order;
columns would have been added

01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:53.980
here;
a second story, with a pediment.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.250
No split pediment here.
 

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:59.650
We see a straight,
conservative pediment here.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:03.594
And the Stuart and Revett
drawing tells us that in

01:03:03.594 --> 01:03:08.101
antiquity there was a marble
slab that was located in the

01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:12.460
center of that aedicula,
in the second story.

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:16.083
And we know there were statues,
the inscriptions tell us that

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:18.679
there were statues on both sides
of this.

01:03:18.679 --> 01:03:20.070
And the statues are very
interesting,

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:23.527
because on the side that faces
the ancient Greek city there was

01:03:23.527 --> 01:03:26.786
a statue of Theseus,
and an inscription that said

01:03:26.786 --> 01:03:29.639
This is Athens,
the City of Theseus;

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:33.699
and on the other side,
of course, they put up--

01:03:33.699 --> 01:03:37.480
in order to pay obeisance,
to honor Hadrian,

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.360
and to try to extract favors
from him undoubtedly,

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.949
they put up a statue to Hadrian
on the other side,

01:03:43.949 --> 01:03:48.730
and that inscription says
This is the City of Hadrian,

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:53.460
not the City of Theseus.
 

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:57.235
The last monument that I want
to show you is a monument that

01:03:57.235 --> 01:03:59.539
is near and dear to my own
heart,

01:03:59.539 --> 01:04:01.670
because in the two years that I
lived in Athens,

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.630
in the 1970s,
I was working on a book on this

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:06.110
particular monument.
 

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:09.092
The monument doesn't date to
the Augustan period and it

01:04:09.092 --> 01:04:12.349
doesn't date to the Hadrianic
period, which makes it all the

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.510
more interesting.
 

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:15.980
It dates to the time of Trajan.
 

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.159
And it has nothing to do with
either of those two emperors,

01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:21.630
but with a man whose name is
mouthful,

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:26.550
and that is Gaius Julius
Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos.

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:28.219
You don't have to remember all
of that.

01:04:28.219 --> 01:04:30.329
I like to call him Uncle Phil.
 

01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:33.994
You can call him Uncle Phil;
that's the easier way to refer

01:04:33.994 --> 01:04:37.369
to Gaius Julius Antiochus
Epiphanes Philopappos.

01:04:37.369 --> 01:04:40.181
Nonetheless,
he was a very interesting man,

01:04:40.181 --> 01:04:42.460
and we know a lot about his
bio.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:46.322
We know, for example,
that he was the son of a king

01:04:46.322 --> 01:04:49.161
of Commagene,
a Hellenistic kingdom in the

01:04:49.161 --> 01:04:52.570
eastern part of the Empire,
in ancient Anatolia,

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:54.320
what is now Turkey.
 

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.654
He was a son of that king of
Commagene, C-o-m-m-a-g-e-n-e,

01:04:59.654 --> 01:05:04.239
and his relatives had been
kings for some time.

01:05:04.239 --> 01:05:07.503
But he was unfortunate;
although he was slated to

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:10.106
become king himself,
he was unfortunate that

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:12.559
Vespasian, the Roman emperor
Vespasian,

01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:15.309
conquered Commagene,
made it a Roman colony,

01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:19.590
deposed the kings and became
ruler himself,

01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:20.268
in a sense.
 

01:05:20.268 --> 01:05:22.846
And so Philopappos,
because of the Romans,

01:05:22.846 --> 01:05:24.920
never became king of Commagene.
 

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.010
He seems to have made the best
of it by making his way to Rome,

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:33.000
using his influence and his
high station,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.061
as a deposed king,
to finagle for himself a

01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:40.639
position as suffect consul in
Rome.

01:05:40.639 --> 01:05:42.070
What was a suffect consul?
 

01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:44.670
A suffect consul was kind of a
consul in waiting;

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:47.922
by that I mean that if one of
the regular consuls couldn't do

01:05:47.922 --> 01:05:50.686
his job, the suffect consul
could be brought in as a

01:05:50.686 --> 01:05:51.500
substitute.
 

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.668
So Philopappos could sort of
stand and wait and hope that

01:05:54.668 --> 01:05:56.989
someone got sick and he could
come in--

01:05:56.989 --> 01:05:59.271
or got, you know,
was in war or involved in a

01:05:59.271 --> 01:06:02.264
military campaign,
and then he would be called in

01:06:02.264 --> 01:06:03.469
to take his place.
 

01:06:03.469 --> 01:06:06.835
So he hangs around Rome for
awhile, and then he eventually

01:06:06.835 --> 01:06:08.489
goes back, goes to Athens.
 

01:06:08.489 --> 01:06:11.628
He moves to Athens,
he's honored with all kinds of

01:06:11.628 --> 01:06:14.320
titles in Athens,
and he eventually ends up

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.780
being--dying in Athens and being
buried in Athens.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:23.000
And a tomb gets put up in his
honor between 114 and 116.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.557
And we know the precise date
because of an inscription on the

01:06:26.557 --> 01:06:28.858
monument,
the still surviving monument,

01:06:28.858 --> 01:06:31.599
that makes reference to some of
Trajan's titles,

01:06:31.599 --> 01:06:35.349
titles that Trajan held between
114 and 116,

01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:38.429
but does not include titles
that he got after that.

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:42.768
So we know that it was put up
between 114 and 116.

01:06:42.768 --> 01:06:46.253
And we're going to see that it
features a frieze depicting

01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:50.043
Philopappos at the high point of
his life: his processus

01:06:50.043 --> 01:06:53.246
consularis,
his consular procession,

01:06:53.246 --> 01:06:55.869
when he was made a consul in
Rome.

01:06:55.869 --> 01:06:58.891
I show you a view from the air
where you see once again the

01:06:58.891 --> 01:07:01.369
Acropolis,
and the relationship of the

01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:05.260
Acropolis to the Mouseion Hill,
the Hill of the Muses.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.722
Now what's most extraordinary
is that there's only one ancient

01:07:08.722 --> 01:07:11.958
monument on the Mouseion Hill,
and that is the Monument of

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:12.809
Uncle Phil.
 

01:07:12.809 --> 01:07:15.230
We are standing on the
Acropolis.

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:17.639
I love this picture.
 

01:07:17.639 --> 01:07:19.911
I took this picture myself,
and I'm very proud of it

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:22.954
because it just happens to work,
especially because these two

01:07:22.954 --> 01:07:25.925
guys happened to be standing
there taking pictures of the

01:07:25.925 --> 01:07:27.730
Odeion of Herodes Atticus here.
 

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:30.487
But we're standing here,
we're looking back toward the

01:07:30.487 --> 01:07:31.320
Mouseion Hill.
 

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.217
And you can see not quite at
the apex but almost near the

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:38.557
apex, the monument,
the sole monument that stands

01:07:38.557 --> 01:07:41.690
on this hill,
the Monument of Uncle Phil.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:45.715
How did he rate to be able to
get this sole monument on one of

01:07:45.715 --> 01:07:47.300
the three major hills?
 

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.242
You can see it--it's
marble--you can see it popping

01:07:50.242 --> 01:07:53.833
up--pentelic marble--you can see
it popping up almost near the

01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:55.070
apex of the hill.
 

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:59.525
If we look at this site plan,
you will see that it is sited

01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:01.097
exactly--
you see it here,

01:08:01.097 --> 01:08:02.829
on the top of the Hill of the
Muses--

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:06.440
sited exactly in relationship
to the Acropolis,

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.869
lined up with what building?
 

01:08:07.869 --> 01:08:11.340
The Erechtheion;
the Erechtheion,

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.739
this building that was so
revered by the Romans.

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:17.780
It's lined up exactly with it,
at midpoint,

01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:21.690
between the Propylaia and the
Parthenon, exactly on the

01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:22.850
Erechtheion.
 

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.639
And this is the view--here we
are standing right in front of

01:08:25.639 --> 01:08:28.238
Uncle Phil's monument,
looking back at the Acropolis.

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:31.301
Even if you don't want to go
see Uncle Phil--which I hope you

01:08:31.301 --> 01:08:32.929
will;
if you're in Athens visit him

01:08:32.929 --> 01:08:33.279
for me.
 

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.904
I hope that you will,
at the very least you want to

01:08:35.904 --> 01:08:39.055
stand there with your back to
Phil's monument and look at the

01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:39.788
Acropolis.
 

01:08:39.788 --> 01:08:42.735
You get one of the best views
of the Acropolis from the

01:08:42.735 --> 01:08:43.609
Mouseion Hill.
 

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:46.735
You see it here,
and your view is lined up

01:08:46.735 --> 01:08:49.100
exactly with the Erechtheion.
 

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.090
Now why is Uncle Phil buried on
this hill?

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:54.088
This is interesting,
because if you think back to

01:08:54.088 --> 01:08:56.546
tomb architecture that we've
looked at in the course of this

01:08:56.546 --> 01:08:58.547
semester,
we didn't see people buried on

01:08:58.547 --> 01:08:58.880
hills.
 

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.029
The Romans don't bury people on
hills.

01:09:01.029 --> 01:09:04.056
They bury people on flat
ground, outside the walls of the

01:09:04.056 --> 01:09:05.680
city, in their necropolises.
 

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.100
Every tomb we've seen was on
flat, essentially on flat land.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:14.520
Why is Uncle Phil buried in a
tomb near the apex of a hill?

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.721
Well as I was writing this book
I looked back to his own

01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:19.944
ancestors,
to people in this part of the

01:09:19.944 --> 01:09:22.865
world,
to a group of dynasts in a

01:09:22.865 --> 01:09:26.729
place called Nemrud Dagh,
also in Anatolia.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.890
And I show you one of their
well-preserved tombs here,

01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:35.948
and you can see that the tomb
is built not quite at the--

01:09:35.948 --> 01:09:38.618
not at the apex of the hill,
but on the slope of the hill;

01:09:38.618 --> 01:09:42.881
in this case not as close as
Uncle Phil's is to the apex,

01:09:42.881 --> 01:09:47.600
but moving on that--moving up
on that slope toward the apex.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.448
And if you look very carefully
at this monument,

01:09:49.448 --> 01:09:54.106
you will see among the remains
some seated statues of the

01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:59.037
dynasts of Nemrud Dagh,
of this area that Philopappos

01:09:59.037 --> 01:10:00.658
also comes from.
 

01:10:00.658 --> 01:10:03.737
This is the Philopappos
Monument on the left-hand side

01:10:03.737 --> 01:10:05.770
of the screen,
as it looks today;

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:08.640
made out of pentelic marble,
beautifully carved.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.060
It is a kind of a tower tomb
with a plain base,

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.560
a curved second story that has
the scene of Philopappos in a

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.060
chariot,
at the time of his consular

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:19.800
procession.
 

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.635
And then some statues in
niches, seated statues,

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:25.408
looking very much like those of
Nemrud Dagh.

01:10:25.408 --> 01:10:27.867
Up above we think it's
Philopappos himself,

01:10:27.867 --> 01:10:30.500
with a bare chest,
headless, in the center.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.568
A figure in a toga over here,
and certainly another figure

01:10:33.568 --> 01:10:35.829
flanking him,
another male seated figure on

01:10:35.829 --> 01:10:37.930
the right-hand side of the
screen .

01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:41.189
Why do I show you the Arch of
Titus in connection to this?

01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:44.922
Because we know that
Philopappos' father and uncle

01:10:44.922 --> 01:10:48.974
participated in the Jewish Wars,
on the side of the Flavian

01:10:48.974 --> 01:10:51.055
emperors,
in order to gain--even though

01:10:51.055 --> 01:10:53.363
they'd been deposed,
they wanted to gain favor with

01:10:53.363 --> 01:10:53.600
them.
 

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.997
And when Philopappos went to
Rome, this is the monument that

01:10:56.997 --> 01:11:00.069
he would've seen,
this monument that Domitian put

01:11:00.069 --> 01:11:03.539
up to those Jewish Wars that his
father and his uncle had

01:11:03.539 --> 01:11:05.711
participated in,
on the Velia,

01:11:05.711 --> 01:11:09.149
with that representation of
Titus in a chariot.

01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:11.903
And I think there's no
question--and I present this in

01:11:11.903 --> 01:11:15.341
the book as a theory--
that the processus

01:11:15.341 --> 01:11:21.501
consularis of Philopappos
closely based on the triumphal

01:11:21.501 --> 01:11:23.380
scene of Titus.
 

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:26.235
And perhaps it's no
coincidence--we don't have too

01:11:26.235 --> 01:11:29.675
many pentelic marble buildings
in Rome--the Arch of Titus is

01:11:29.675 --> 01:11:31.890
made out of Greek pentelic
marble.

01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:32.789
Is that a coincidence?
 

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.100
I don't think so.
 

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.021
Here's a restored view of the
Monument of Philopappos as it

01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:39.238
would have looked in antiquity:
the base,

01:11:39.238 --> 01:11:42.538
the consular procession,
the statue of Uncle Phil in the

01:11:42.538 --> 01:11:45.032
center,
the inscription to the left,

01:11:45.032 --> 01:11:47.600
which is the pilaster that
survives,

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.000
with the inscription making
reference to Trajan's titles,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.260
that allow us to date it.
 

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:56.335
And then probably a missing
attic with an inscription at the

01:11:56.335 --> 01:11:57.510
uppermost part.
 

01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:01.198
This view over here shows you
some graffiti that have

01:12:01.198 --> 01:12:03.470
fortunately since been erased.
 

01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:05.856
I show you the interior of,
or what survives of,

01:12:05.856 --> 01:12:08.600
the back wall that would've
been the burial chamber.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.488
Here's a restored view showing
that burial chamber,

01:12:11.488 --> 01:12:15.313
the sarcophagus of Philopappos
where his remains would've been

01:12:15.313 --> 01:12:17.586
placed,
a statue of him on a console

01:12:17.586 --> 01:12:21.277
that still survives,
and then columns and a straight

01:12:21.277 --> 01:12:24.680
lintel that formed what we call
a naiskos,

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.743
n-a-i-s-k-o-s,
which served as a kind of

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:30.920
shrine to honor him,
on the inside of the monument.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.930
And if we look at this
cross-section of the tomb,

01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:38.560
which are in my book,
we see the sarcophagus,

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.635
we see the statue of Phil,
and we see the way in which it

01:12:41.635 --> 01:12:44.381
is lined up with the
representations of Philopappos

01:12:44.381 --> 01:12:47.492
on the outside,
in his--it's kind of midway

01:12:47.492 --> 01:12:51.890
between the scene of him in his
chariot and the scene of him

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:55.078
with the bare chest,
in heroic nudity.

01:12:55.078 --> 01:12:58.380
So during his lifetime in the
consular procession,

01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.930
after death up above.
 

01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:03.779
So honored three times in three
statues on this monument.

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:06.880
Here's a view of some of the
figures that accompany him.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.939
They're wearing Roman togas,
because the scene is taking

01:13:09.939 --> 01:13:12.036
place in Rome;
that's where the consular

01:13:12.036 --> 01:13:12.760
procession is.
 

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.317
They're carrying fasces
like the bodyguards do for an

01:13:17.317 --> 01:13:19.507
emperor;
and that too shows the

01:13:19.507 --> 01:13:22.279
relationship of this to the Arch
of Titus.

01:13:22.279 --> 01:13:24.780
Here we see the scene of the
Arch of Titus,

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.698
triumph, and the scene of
Philopappos' triumph;

01:13:27.698 --> 01:13:32.439
clearly the one on the right,
in my mind, based on the one on

01:13:32.439 --> 01:13:33.310
the left.
 

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:36.770
If you look at details of the
chariot, you see a naiskos,

01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:40.417
again decorating the chariot,
a naiskos that has a figure of

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.210
none other than Hercules.
 

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:44.618
We can see him wearing--holding
a club.

01:13:44.618 --> 01:13:47.421
So once again,
just like Caracalla,

01:13:47.421 --> 01:13:52.365
we see, in this case earlier,
Philopappos associating himself

01:13:52.365 --> 01:13:53.850
with Hercules.
 

01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:57.233
If we look at a detail of his
head, which is unfortunately not

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:59.783
that well preserved,
we see that he is bearded,

01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:01.670
we see he wears a rayed crown.
 

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:04.810
So although he is represented
in this consular procession,

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:07.622
his kingly, what he--that he
might have been a king,

01:14:07.622 --> 01:14:08.670
is referred to.
 

01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.920
But also his triumph over death.
 

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.618
And if we look at sculpture
from Nemrud Dagh,

01:14:13.618 --> 01:14:16.779
we see once again this
interesting relief--

01:14:16.779 --> 01:14:20.255
so there's more than one of
these--of dynasts of Nemrud Dagh

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:23.789
shaking hands with Hercules with
his club and wearing a rayed

01:14:23.789 --> 01:14:24.380
crown.
 

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.886
So this is another one of these
wonderful examples of this

01:14:27.886 --> 01:14:31.698
fertile mix that one gets so
often in provincial Roman art,

01:14:31.698 --> 01:14:35.202
where you see a monument
clearly based in part on Roman

01:14:35.202 --> 01:14:38.323
precedents,
but also based on the bio of

01:14:38.323 --> 01:14:42.198
this particular man and more on
local precedent.

01:14:42.198 --> 01:14:48.060
A scene of Philopappos in the
uppermost area,

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:52.189
showing him in heroic nudity.
 

01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:56.282
And the last image that I want
to show you is just to make the

01:14:56.282 --> 01:15:00.171
point that interestingly enough
this monument was put up by

01:15:00.171 --> 01:15:03.595
Philopappos' sister,
a woman by the name of

01:15:03.595 --> 01:15:05.738
Balbilla, B-a-l-b-i-l-l-a.
 

01:15:05.738 --> 01:15:09.469
And Balbilla--I wanted to make
this point because we have seen

01:15:09.469 --> 01:15:12.530
so few examples;
it's not that there were none

01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:15.845
but they were small in
comparison to those of men,

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:19.632
that there are--fewer women
seem to have put up monuments

01:15:19.632 --> 01:15:20.578
than men.
 

01:15:20.578 --> 01:15:23.578
But the examples that we have
are very interesting indeed.

01:15:23.578 --> 01:15:27.673
And in this case we know that
the tomb was put up by Balbilla,

01:15:27.673 --> 01:15:30.627
a woman who became very
friendly with Sabina,

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:31.970
wife of Hadrian.
 

01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:35.649
In fact, the three of them
traveled together to Egypt,

01:15:35.649 --> 01:15:39.744
to Thebes, to see the Colossi
of Memnon, which I show you up

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:40.439
there.
 

01:15:40.439 --> 01:15:43.436
And Balbilla leaves an
inscription when she goes that

01:15:43.436 --> 01:15:45.880
she was there;
so she tells us that.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.479
So a very--just to close
today--a very interesting

01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:53.815
example of an extraordinary tomb
in Athens, but one that was

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.359
built by a woman.
 

01:15:55.359 --> 01:15:58.658
And I think that's a great way
to end on this beautiful

01:15:58.658 --> 01:15:59.329
Thursday.
 

01:15:59.329 --> 01:16:01.350
Thank you all.

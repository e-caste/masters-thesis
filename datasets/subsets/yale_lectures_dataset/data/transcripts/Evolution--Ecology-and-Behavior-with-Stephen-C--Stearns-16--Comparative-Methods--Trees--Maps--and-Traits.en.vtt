00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.015
Prof: Today we're going
to talk about these phylogenetic

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:10.550
trees that we've been discussing
for the last couple of sessions;

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.625
and this completes the three
introductory lectures on methods

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:21.182
that are used,
or basic concepts that are used

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:23.410
in macroevolution.
 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.111
So we began that with
speciation, so that you can

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:29.600
understand where the branches on
the Tree of Life came from.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.270
And then we had a quick
overview of how to construct a

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.637
phylogenetic tree,
so that you could see how the

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:36.250
whole tree was put together.
 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.298
And now we're going to see what
happens when you either lay

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:43.648
these trees onto maps,
or you put traits onto the

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:46.650
trees, or you do both at the
same time.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.230
This is basically comparative
biology, in its modern sense.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.860
The outline is first a bit
about looking into time;

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.349
using phylogenetic trees and
looking into geographic history.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:12.573
Then we'll look at how we can
map traits onto trees and draw

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.739
some surprising conclusions.
 

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:19.775
And then we will put trees
together with traits and put

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:23.738
them on maps and see what that
tells us actually about

00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:28.000
evolutionary ecology of lizards
on Caribbean islands.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.846
And then we'll end with a
take-home message from

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:33.769
comparative biology,
which is that species are not

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:36.330
independent samples,
and that because they're not

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.274
independent samples,
we need special methods for

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:43.303
trying to assess how frequently
things evolve in the Tree of

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:43.849
Life.
 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:49.307
And that will lead us into both
looking at how seeds do in sun

00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:51.410
and shade,
in related species,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.330
and the issue of whether you
should be more faithful to your

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.349
mate if you're going to be
married to her for a long time.

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.420
Okay, well let's start with
some of Godfrey Hewitt's work.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.915
And this has to do with what
happened in Europe after the

00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:12.038
glaciers melted.
 

00:02:12.038 --> 00:02:16.673
Now just to remind you about
what Europe looked like at the

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:18.830
peak of the last Ice Age.
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.919
The glacier came down out of
Scandinavia and got down about

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.990
into Northern Germany and
Poland.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.105
The English Channel was dry
because there was so much water

00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:33.383
that had been locked up in the
continental ice sheath that the

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:36.500
level of the earth's oceans
dropped about 100 meters,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.834
and at that point there was a
sub-glacial tundra that

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:47.169
stretched essentially from
Ireland all the way across

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:52.068
France and through Russia,
out into Siberia.

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:56.919
So there was pretty much--it
was called the Mammoth Step.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:01.294
And at that point many of the
animals that you now find in

00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:05.900
Northern Europe had retreated
south, into glacial refugia.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.170
There was one in Spain,
there was one in Italy,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.508
there was one in Greece and the
Balkans, and in Asia Minor.

00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:17.830
And you can now take the
mitochondrial DNA out of these

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.270
various organisms that are
plotted here,

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.068
and you can reconstruct where
they spent the last Ice Age,

00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:29.960
and how they got back into
Northern Europe.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.650
So, for example,
most of the grasshoppers of

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.340
Northern Europe came out of the
Balkans,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.105
and the ones that spent that
time in Spain never got over the

00:03:40.105 --> 00:03:40.979
Pyrenees.
 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.824
The hedgehogs managed to get
over the Pyrenees and spread

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:48.190
through France and Belgium and
the Netherlands.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.016
However, about at that point
they met the hedgehogs that were

00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:54.197
moving north from Italy,
and there were a bunch of other

00:03:54.197 --> 00:03:57.150
hedgehogs that were coming up
from the Balkans.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.109
The bears, interestingly,
managed to do just fine,

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.612
getting out over the Pyrenees,
and they moved right up into

00:04:03.612 --> 00:04:04.580
Scandinavia.
 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.133
And up in Northern Sweden they
have met some bears probably

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:11.931
that had been in the Ukraine and
had come out from north of the

00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:14.520
Black Sea;
and so forth.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.040
So it's possible,
using mitochondrial DNA,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.939
molecular phylogenies,
to reconstruct the recent

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:28.339
history of movements of animals
across the planet,

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:32.543
and trees, across the planet,
and to understand why it is

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:36.899
that there are certain places
where we see hybrid zones.

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:39.384
And in fact here are some
hybrid zones,

00:04:39.384 --> 00:04:40.170
in Europe.
 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.769
These are places where you will
frequently run into hybrids,

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:48.387
and they are there because
populations are coming back

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:51.302
together that had been isolated
in the Ice Ages and breeding

00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:52.290
with each other.
 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.555
So, for example,
this is one I know pretty well,

00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:56.579
because I went there for
thirteen years.

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:59.456
There's a spot in the Swiss
Alps, in the eastern part of the

00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:01.524
Swiss Alps,
just north of the Italian

00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:04.129
border, or just south of the
Austrian border,

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.216
right about here,
where almost every flowering

00:05:07.216 --> 00:05:09.480
plant that you see is a hybrid.
 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.939
And the guidebooks are just
lousy, they just are horrible.

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.839
It's extremely difficult to
identify what you're looking at.

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:20.220
But when you see the big
picture, you can understand it.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.259
So if you're interested in this
kind of thing,

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.810
this is a good paper to read,
by Godfrey Hewitt,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.949
and the papers that have cited,
that have cited that one;

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.129
those are good sources.
 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.160
Now what about humans?
 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.089
Well I'm going to show you
first what's happened in about

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.661
the last 10,000 years,
and we're going to see that in

00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:45.404
Europe the agriculturists spread
out from the Middle East and

00:05:45.404 --> 00:05:47.279
squeezed the Celts into the
northwest.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.098
In Africa we're going to see
the Bantu migration out of

00:05:50.098 --> 00:05:53.439
Cameroon, and how the Hottentots
were squeezed into the southwest

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.170
of Africa.
 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.439
And in Asia we'll see that
agriculturists spread from both

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.995
the Middle East and from China,
and squeezed Siberians into the

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:01.569
north.
 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.079
So these things are laid out in
a beautiful book by Cavalli

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:09.266
Sforza, Paolo Menozzi,
and another author,

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:11.600
Alberto Piazza,
I believe.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.196
And basically what they did was
they tried to come up with a

00:06:17.196 --> 00:06:22.601
method of compressing a huge
amount of genetic information

00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:26.062
onto a map,
and they did it by taking gene

00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:28.504
frequencies,
at hundreds of genes,

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:32.495
and then compressing them,
using statistical analysis,

00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:36.648
into a few factors,
and then plotting those factors

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:37.839
onto the map.
 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:41.971
So what you can see here is
basically the population

00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:46.387
differentiation of humans,
in Europe, and you can see that

00:06:46.387 --> 00:06:49.857
there is kind of a wave that
comes out of the Fertile

00:06:49.857 --> 00:06:53.459
Crescent and moves up to the
north and to the west.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:56.130
And this tracks the
agricultural expansion,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.312
which started about five or six
thousand years ago,

00:06:59.312 --> 00:07:01.028
out of the Middle East.
 

00:07:01.028 --> 00:07:05.610
And you can see that the Celtic
genes did get squeezed up into

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.762
Ireland and England,
and out into Brittany,

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.040
and so forth.
 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.100
So there are lots of neat
details in this book.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.500
If you focus in on particular
areas,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.329
you can see that there's a
hotspot,

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:22.516
right in Palermo,
of Viking genes from the Viking

00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:25.480
occupation of Sicily,
etcetera.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.040
Interesting stuff.
 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.639
If you look at Africa,
what you can see is that there

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:40.639
has been an invasion of Africa
by Caucasoid Northern Africans,

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.209
and by sort of an Arab Nilotic
expansion,

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:46.500
coming down this way.
 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.577
The Bantu expansion out of
Cameroon is what is coloring

00:07:51.577 --> 00:07:54.870
part of the continent pretty
red.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.209
And, by the way,
this migration got through here

00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:00.269
about a thousand years ago.
 

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:04.716
So the Bantu migration down
into East Africa is something

00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:06.939
that is relatively recent.
 

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:11.050
And if you've been reading
about the war in the Congo,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.838
and the conflicts between the
Hutus and the Tutsis,

00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:19.620
the Hutus are Bantu,
and the Tutsis are Nilotic,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.872
and you can see where the
Nilotic and the Bantu mix comes

00:08:23.872 --> 00:08:28.430
together here in the Great Lakes
region of Central Africa.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.788
So this kind of map gives you
some feel for the way things

00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:35.009
have moved.
 

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:40.423
By the way, there was a kingdom
in Mali, centered around

00:08:40.423 --> 00:08:46.918
Timbuktu--or an empire--and this
orange spot is a relic of that.

00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:50.450
So the history of human
movement on the face of the

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.544
globe is written in the genes
and can, to a certain extent,

00:08:54.544 --> 00:08:56.168
still be recovered.
 

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:59.490
This kind of study will no
longer be possible after another

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.470
few hundred years of jet travel
and crossbreeding.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.643
My son, for example,
is in a relationship with a

00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:12.230
woman from here.
 

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.321
Another few generations of that
and this map will not be

00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.658
reconstructable.
 

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:23.504
If we look at Asia,
what we see is that there were

00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:30.422
nomads and agriculturists coming
out of the area around the

00:09:30.422 --> 00:09:33.691
Middle East,
and around the Black Sea and

00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:36.245
the Caspian Sea,
that have pushed into Central

00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:38.868
Asia,
and the Chinese

00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:46.048
agriculturalists have spread
into Southern Asia.

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:52.366
But there's a very interesting
hotspot of human biodiversity in

00:09:52.366 --> 00:09:57.259
southeastern Asia,
going from India over about to

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:59.956
Taiwan;
and actually this is where the

00:09:59.956 --> 00:10:01.269
Polynesians came out of.
 

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:04.605
The Polynesians left from
Taiwan we think about 5000 years

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:08.118
ago, and that's confirmed both
in the language reconstruction

00:10:08.118 --> 00:10:10.048
and in the mitochondrial DNA.
 

00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:14.519
That just came out a few weeks
ago.

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:19.573
So you can see that one of the
themes of recent human history

00:10:19.573 --> 00:10:24.292
has basically been of the
expansion of some groups at the

00:10:24.292 --> 00:10:27.626
expense of others,
and that that was often a

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:32.360
technology-driven thing,
and often involved agriculture.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.011
Now, I've shown you this
before, and I just want to bring

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.807
this back in again,
at this point,

00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:43.539
to indicate what you can do
with phylogenetic trees,

00:10:43.539 --> 00:10:45.288
and just to remind you.
 

00:10:45.288 --> 00:10:48.732
It is now possible to get
information on single nucleotide

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.875
polymorphisms at 650,000
different sites in the human

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:54.663
genome,
and this is a paper that did

00:10:54.663 --> 00:10:58.788
that for 928 unrelated
individuals from 51 populations.

00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:02.200
So these are the 928
individuals out here.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.857
These names down here are the
51 populations,

00:11:04.857 --> 00:11:08.120
and the 650,000 different
positions in the human genome

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.960
are on the Y axis,
all compressed together;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.210
so it's very hard to see any
differentiation there.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:21.750
And you can see that there is
certainly a genetic signature

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.591
across this;
certain kinds of genomes in

00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:27.690
certain geographical areas.
 

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.379
And if you then do the
molecular phylogenetics on it,

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:33.519
and construct the phylogenetic
tree,

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:37.796
you see that the oldest part of
the modern human tree is

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:39.428
centered in Africa.
 

00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:41.460
This, by the way,
is the Classical view.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.599
This was a picture that could
be drawn in 1995--and this is

00:11:46.599 --> 00:11:48.913
2008;
so this thirteen years

00:11:48.913 --> 00:11:52.918
later--and this tree largely
confirms this picture.

00:11:52.918 --> 00:11:53.267
Okay?
 

00:11:53.267 --> 00:11:57.160
So you could lay this tree onto
this map and come up with

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.360
something that looks pretty much
like this.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.581
What you see here basically is
we came out of Africa,

00:12:04.581 --> 00:12:07.100
we paused in the Middle East.
 

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.379
Then various groups moved out
of the Middle East.

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:13.298
One group went into Europe,
thought to be about 40,000

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.200
years ago;
that's these guys.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.490
Other groups set out into Asia
and spread out through Asia.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:27.403
And then out of the group that
had settled basically in Eastern

00:12:27.403 --> 00:12:33.759
China and Japan and Korea,
one group up here split off.

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:37.690
Part of them--actually an early
part of this branch--

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.139
went down here,
through Papua,

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:41.063
New Guinea,
into Australia,

00:12:41.063 --> 00:12:44.820
and another part went out into
the New World.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.495
So phylogenetic methods can now
be used to give us quite a bit

00:12:49.495 --> 00:12:54.841
of insight into our own history,
as well as into the history of

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:57.149
other plants and animals.
 

00:12:57.149 --> 00:13:04.038
Now the Hawaiian Islands are an
interesting test case.

00:13:04.038 --> 00:13:08.326
When we look at something like
the human expansion across the

00:13:08.326 --> 00:13:11.144
globe,
it's actually difficult to get

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:15.274
precise markers for the times
when they arrived in certain

00:13:15.274 --> 00:13:16.000
places.
 

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.298
Archeology gives us some;
sometimes we can recover fossil

00:13:24.298 --> 00:13:25.460
DNA from bones.
 

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.381
But in the case of the Hawaiian
Islands, at least on the scale

00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:33.176
of the last 5,000,000 years,
we have very precise geological

00:13:33.176 --> 00:13:33.820
dates.
 

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.620
For example,
we know that Kohala Mountain,

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.600
the oldest rock on Kohala
Mountain is 430,000 years old,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.340
and that the oldest rock on
Kauai is 5.1 million years old;

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.053
and that's because the islands
are made over a hotspot here,

00:13:49.053 --> 00:13:51.950
and carried on a plate up in
that direction.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.380
And you can actually lay down,
on this plate,

00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.138
how long ago it was that that
island was actually sitting down

00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:00.840
here.
 

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.527
And that's nice,
because when we then do

00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:07.455
phylogenetics and we start
putting phylogenetic trees onto

00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:10.985
this map,
it gives us some feel for when

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:15.690
in time those different branch
points might have been.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.889
And that has been done for a
number of groups.

00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:22.450
I'm sure there's now more
information.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.620
This is about five years old
here.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.914
And these are three different
ways that spiders and some other

00:14:29.914 --> 00:14:34.254
arthropods and some insects
speciated over the last

00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:36.860
5,000,000 years in Hawaii.
 

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.017
Interestingly,
you can see that they all moved

00:14:39.017 --> 00:14:41.080
down from Kauai onto the younger
islands.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.879
So they were going from older
islands onto younger islands,

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:45.279
and they just kept hopping.
 

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.248
And, by the way,
if you just continue this

00:14:47.248 --> 00:14:49.649
island chain up to where it
dives into Siberia,

00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:53.053
there were islands there
350,000,000 years ago that are

00:14:53.053 --> 00:14:55.639
now getting subducted under
Kamchatka,

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:59.280
and there are things that are
one or two-thousand miles up to

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.678
the northwest that were once
high islands above water.

00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:06.575
So this hopping movement could
have been going on for quite

00:15:06.575 --> 00:15:07.178
awhile.
 

00:15:07.178 --> 00:15:09.845
And, in fact,
we think that some of the

00:15:09.845 --> 00:15:14.332
things that we now see in Hawaii
got there about 20 or 30,000,000

00:15:14.332 --> 00:15:17.490
years ago, before Kauai came
above water.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.778
So it's an old process.
 

00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:21.850
At any rate,
in some cases things simply

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.982
moved from one island to the
other, and then every time they

00:15:24.982 --> 00:15:27.158
got onto a new island they
speciated.

00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:31.047
In other cases there were four
or five species from Kauai that

00:15:31.047 --> 00:15:34.581
moved down to Oahu,
and then several of them sorted

00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:37.058
out on Oahu and speciated on
Oahu,

00:15:37.058 --> 00:15:39.408
and four or five of them moved
down to Maui Nui,

00:15:39.408 --> 00:15:41.303
and so forth,
and then a lot of them

00:15:41.303 --> 00:15:44.389
speciated on Maui Nui and moved
over to the Big Island;

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:47.129
and that process went on.
 

00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:53.167
Another process is one where
you have a lot of species on

00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:54.029
Kauai.
 

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:55.558
One of them moves to Oahu.
 

00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:58.014
You get a lot on Oahu,
but only one then is the

00:15:58.014 --> 00:15:59.990
ancestor that goes on to Maui
Nui,

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.629
and you get a lot there,
and then one goes onto the Big

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.471
Island,
and then you get a species

00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:07.490
complex on each of the five
volcanoes on the Big Island,

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.668
that are coming from that one
ancestor.

00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:16.017
So all of these processes can
actually be seen written in the

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.570
genes,
and this is all resulting

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:24.697
basically from sequencing,
either nuclear or mitochondrial

00:16:24.697 --> 00:16:25.370
DNA.
 

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.440
There are other kinds of
questions that you can answer.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.660
And this is one that was
answered by Anne Yoder,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.080
who was on the faculty here.
 

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.538
She now is the head of the Duke
Primate Center.

00:16:35.538 --> 00:16:40.980
And Anne has specialized in the
mammals that live on Madagascar.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:46.193
And on Madagascar you find a
local radiation of things that

00:16:46.193 --> 00:16:50.149
look kind of like civet cats or
mongooses.

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:54.288
And the question was,
did they come over from Africa

00:16:54.288 --> 00:16:58.590
separately, or did they all
speciate on Madagascar?

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.880
And Anne was able to
reconstruct the phylogeny of

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.585
this group of animals well
enough so she could lay this

00:17:05.585 --> 00:17:09.631
tree onto this map and determine
that in fact these guys are

00:17:09.631 --> 00:17:12.578
actually all relatives of
mongooses,

00:17:12.578 --> 00:17:15.960
and mongooses are close
relatives of hyenas,

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.000
and those things have a sister
group of civets,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.809
and those things have a sister
group of cats.

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:25.160
And they got across right here.
 

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.730
Now Madagascar split off from
Africa about 65,000,000 years

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:29.098
ago.
 

00:17:29.098 --> 00:17:31.719
It's part of the Tectonic
breakup that led to India

00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:33.814
splitting off,
skitting across the Indian

00:17:33.814 --> 00:17:36.798
Ocean, crashing into Asia,
and raising the Himalayas.

00:17:36.798 --> 00:17:39.468
And so you might wonder,
well how the heck does

00:17:39.468 --> 00:17:42.717
something like this cross a
strait which is now more than

00:17:42.717 --> 00:17:43.818
200 miles wide?
 

00:17:43.818 --> 00:17:48.323
Well have any of you read
Rudyard Kipling's story,

00:17:48.323 --> 00:17:52.000
How the Elephant Got His
Trunk?

00:17:55.259 --> 00:17:58.113
"Down by the grey-green,
greasy Limpopo River,

00:17:58.113 --> 00:18:00.568
all set about with fever
trees"--

00:18:00.568 --> 00:18:03.019
the elephant child looked into
the water,

00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:05.890
and a crocodile grabbed his
nose and pulled it out,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.930
and that was how the elephant
got his trunk.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:12.137
Well the grey-green,
greasy Limpopo River is right

00:18:12.137 --> 00:18:12.740
here.
 

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.365
And in flood stage,
if you go out on the Limpopo

00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:17.756
River,
there are large rafts of trees

00:18:17.756 --> 00:18:20.210
and vegetation being carried
down it,

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.058
and in a good storm you can put
a mongoose on a raft of

00:18:24.058 --> 00:18:27.410
vegetation and get it out across
that strait;

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.050
so it rafted across,
and it probably came out of the

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.549
grey-green, greasy Limpopo
River.

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:36.480
Okay? So that's right here.
 

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.195
Now what about issues--I'm
running through a series of

00:18:41.195 --> 00:18:46.092
issues that can be resolved
using comparative methods in

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:48.048
phylogentic trees.
 

00:18:48.048 --> 00:18:53.970
And this represents one of the
phylogenetic surprises.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.471
There are parasitoid wasps
which can be either

00:18:57.471 --> 00:19:00.038
ectoparasites or endoparasites.
 

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:03.093
The ectoparasites lay their
eggs on the outsides of

00:19:03.093 --> 00:19:05.385
caterpillars,
and the eggs hatch and make

00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:07.970
little baby wasps that crawl
around the outside of the

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.003
caterpillar,
and they eat it from the

00:19:11.003 --> 00:19:11.848
outside.
 

00:19:11.848 --> 00:19:15.420
And they have relatives who are
endoparasites.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.500
The Ichneumonids are like that.
 

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.029
Here's a nice Ichneumonid-like
wasp.

00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:22.098
You can see her long ovipositor.
 

00:19:22.098 --> 00:19:27.755
And here she is on an insect
larva, and she is injecting an

00:19:27.755 --> 00:19:29.118
egg into it.
 

00:19:29.118 --> 00:19:38.450
And the ancestors turn out to
have been wasps that did this.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.509
It had been thought that if you
just look at it mechanically,

00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:44.179
it would be easier to start the
evolutionary process off with

00:19:44.179 --> 00:19:46.359
the wasp just flying around and
laying its egg.

00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:48.588
Right?
 

00:19:48.588 --> 00:19:52.114
But in this particular
radiation--that may have been

00:19:52.114 --> 00:19:56.035
the case far in the past;
somewhere off the slide out

00:19:56.035 --> 00:20:00.375
here there may have been an
ectoparasitic wasp that was an

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:01.288
ancestor.
 

00:20:01.288 --> 00:20:06.618
But it turns out that all of
these things are endoparasites,

00:20:06.618 --> 00:20:10.588
and the ectoparasites evolved
within that,

00:20:10.588 --> 00:20:14.541
and then within the
ectoparasites you had a reversal

00:20:14.541 --> 00:20:18.028
again and got some endoparasites
out of it.

00:20:18.028 --> 00:20:22.224
So if you lay the traits onto
the tree, and you are confident

00:20:22.224 --> 00:20:25.301
of your tree,
you can reconstruct the history

00:20:25.301 --> 00:20:29.597
of an important trait like this;
and that's a nice kind of

00:20:29.597 --> 00:20:31.588
insight to be able to have.
 

00:20:31.588 --> 00:20:36.769
Okay, now I would like to
discuss the Anolis lizards.

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:41.900
And this is something that a
large group of scientists,

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.693
currently centered at Harvard
but with branches in Seattle and

00:20:47.693 --> 00:20:48.265
in St.
 

00:20:48.265 --> 00:20:53.298
Louis and other places,
have been working on for about

00:20:53.298 --> 00:20:55.960
the last fifty years.
 

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:03.324
And they study Anolis lizards
because these are prominent,

00:21:03.324 --> 00:21:07.002
easily observed;
you can get a pretty good

00:21:07.002 --> 00:21:08.519
sample size fairly quickly.
 

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:10.338
And they've done fascinating
things.

00:21:10.338 --> 00:21:15.333
So the Anolis lizards have had
a big radiation on islands in

00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:18.801
the Caribbean,
and they have made what are

00:21:18.801 --> 00:21:20.578
called ecomorphs.
 

00:21:20.578 --> 00:21:25.098
Now these ecomorphs can be
grouped by appearance.

00:21:25.098 --> 00:21:31.612
So if you look at them and you
see where they're living and

00:21:31.612 --> 00:21:36.890
what kinds of grasping
appendages they have,

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.548
basically what the phenotype
looks like and how they behave,

00:21:41.548 --> 00:21:44.556
you can come up with things
that live on the crowns of

00:21:44.556 --> 00:21:46.650
trees;
out on twigs;

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.660
down in the ground in grass and
in bushes;

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.400
between the trunk and the crown;
only on the trunk;

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.118
or down on the ground and going
up on the trunk.

00:21:56.118 --> 00:21:56.515
Okay?
 

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:58.730
So there are six ecomorphs.
 

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.078
And you find them again and
again.

00:22:00.078 --> 00:22:02.920
You find them on many islands
in the Caribbean.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.838
And it's really tragic that in
the middle of winter,

00:22:04.838 --> 00:22:07.115
up here in New England,
you have to be continually

00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:09.950
flying down to the Caribbean to
increase your sample size,

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.368
okay?
 

00:22:10.368 --> 00:22:13.808
And doing that for twenty or
thirty years,

00:22:13.808 --> 00:22:17.920
through many generations of
graduate students.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.577
Well, after DNA sequencing came
along, you could do their

00:22:23.577 --> 00:22:24.788
phylogeny.
 

00:22:24.788 --> 00:22:27.961
And look just--it's hard to see
because the reproduction isn't

00:22:27.961 --> 00:22:30.976
very good on the slides--but
just look at the difference in

00:22:30.976 --> 00:22:32.118
the color pattern.
 

00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:32.506
Okay?
 

00:22:32.506 --> 00:22:35.673
So, for example,
this is the trunk crown's

00:22:35.673 --> 00:22:36.368
space.
 

00:22:36.368 --> 00:22:42.106
Well, it turns out to pop up
here, and here,

00:22:42.106 --> 00:22:46.777
and here, and here:
one, two, three,

00:22:46.777 --> 00:22:50.779
four times, independently.
 

00:22:50.779 --> 00:22:56.509
Or you could take something
like the twig form.

00:22:56.509 --> 00:22:59.622
Here's a twig form,
here's a twig form,

00:22:59.622 --> 00:23:02.490
and here's a bunch of twig
forms.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.114
Now what's going on here
basically is you're having the

00:23:06.114 --> 00:23:10.208
independent evolution and the
convergence on different islands

00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:13.930
of these different ecomorphs,
among these lizards.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.928
And if you take that down and
you break it down by island,

00:23:18.928 --> 00:23:23.048
what you can see is that on
Cuba the trunk form,

00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:26.470
the crown trunk form was
ancestral.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:31.380
On Hispaniola,
the twig crown form--or no,

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.890
this is trunk crown and this is
crown giant;

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.460
this is a crown giant form,
was the ancestral form.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.151
So these are inferences about
what first got onto that island

00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:45.920
and what first got out to the
other island.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.328
And then these other things all
evolved from that.

00:23:49.328 --> 00:23:52.236
And what you see from that
basically is that it doesn't

00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:55.519
matter which form of lizard you
first throw onto an island;

00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:58.240
all of the other ones are going
to evolve from it.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.328
And these are all different
species.

00:24:00.328 --> 00:24:04.865
And we're talking about things
that range in size from about

00:24:04.865 --> 00:24:09.555
that big, up to about that big,
and that are differentiated at

00:24:09.555 --> 00:24:11.400
the level of genera.
 

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.328
So this is really major
evolution,

00:24:13.328 --> 00:24:15.368
which is being repeated again
and again,

00:24:15.368 --> 00:24:19.630
across the Caribbean,
and generating essentially--

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.992
what's going on here is that
essentially the same ecological

00:24:22.992 --> 00:24:25.730
community is being generated
again and again,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:31.250
independent of which kind of
species founded that group.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.512
Okay?
 

00:24:31.512 --> 00:24:34.923
That was highly unexpected;
people didn't think this would

00:24:34.923 --> 00:24:35.440
happen.
 

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.172
So this means that you're
getting the same ecomorphs from

00:24:38.172 --> 00:24:40.709
different ancestral states,
and that means you've got

00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:41.490
convergence.
 

00:24:44.788 --> 00:24:50.529
Okay, now for an insight from a
guy named Joe Felsenstein.

00:24:50.529 --> 00:24:54.308
And if you want to go back to
the original paper,

00:24:54.308 --> 00:24:55.490
it's in 1985.
 

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.670
So this is one of Joe's many
contributions to phylogenetics.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:04.040
If you just look at this
picture that I showed you the

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.577
other day, you can see that the
red trait evolved in the

00:25:08.577 --> 00:25:10.970
ancestor of both B and C.
 

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:11.413
Okay?
 

00:25:11.413 --> 00:25:15.140
So that means that B and C
share a trait.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.670
However, in evolutionary terms,
it only evolved once.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.159
Now at this point,
the reason that red increased

00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:27.019
in frequency might have been
that it was adaptive.

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:30.598
Things that had the red state
had a fitness advantage.

00:25:30.598 --> 00:25:33.400
So microevolution was driving
it at that point.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.807
But then everybody inherited
it, and it is not an adaptation

00:25:37.807 --> 00:25:41.844
to the difference between
whatever environments B and C

00:25:41.844 --> 00:25:43.038
now live in.
 

00:25:43.038 --> 00:25:48.328
So if you were to look at B and
C now,

00:25:48.328 --> 00:25:51.118
and you saw that they shared
some trait,

00:25:51.118 --> 00:25:55.500
you wouldn't really know why
that was there,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.400
until you could get a much,
much larger sample size;

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.896
because you just have a sample
size of one, when you're looking

00:26:01.896 --> 00:26:02.799
at that trait.
 

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:04.818
Okay?
 

00:26:04.818 --> 00:26:07.838
So how do you deal with that
problem?

00:26:07.838 --> 00:26:11.897
Well Joe came up with what he
called the method of independent

00:26:11.897 --> 00:26:12.630
contrast.
 

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:17.207
And in this context a contrast
is the difference of the value,

00:26:17.207 --> 00:26:21.409
the mean value of a trait in
one species and its value in

00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:22.910
another species.
 

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:27.064
And if you look up just at the
tips of this phylogenetic tree

00:26:27.064 --> 00:26:30.803
and you take the differences
across the closest related

00:26:30.803 --> 00:26:33.601
sister pairs,
at the tops of the tree,

00:26:33.601 --> 00:26:35.539
you generate these contrasts.
 

00:26:35.539 --> 00:26:39.529
You get X2 minus X1;
X4 minus X3;

00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:41.068
and so forth.
 

00:26:41.068 --> 00:26:44.798
Well the important thing about
the contrasts is this.

00:26:44.798 --> 00:26:49.916
The difference that evolved,
after this point on the tree,

00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:54.405
is independent of the
difference that evolved after

00:26:54.405 --> 00:26:56.828
this point on the tree.
 

00:26:56.828 --> 00:27:00.657
You've taken out whatever was
there because of the common

00:27:00.657 --> 00:27:01.410
ancestor.
 

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.945
So whatever was going on over
in this part of the tree is

00:27:05.945 --> 00:27:10.886
biologically separated and now
statistically separated by this

00:27:10.886 --> 00:27:13.741
method,
from whatever was going on in

00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:15.558
any other part of the tree.
 

00:27:15.558 --> 00:27:19.119
So this actually is a method of
getting the correct sample size,

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:20.588
off a phylogenetic tree.
 

00:27:20.588 --> 00:27:24.181
And that's very important in
statistics, because if you have

00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:27.407
the wrong sample size,
all your statistical tests will

00:27:27.407 --> 00:27:28.200
be wrong.
 

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:34.102
So this was important for the
mental health of people who were

00:27:34.102 --> 00:27:38.068
doing statistics on phylogenetic
trees.

00:27:38.068 --> 00:27:44.866
So let's take a look at some
approaches that are kind of like

00:27:44.866 --> 00:27:45.660
that.
 

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.180
So this is from a guy named
Peter Grubb.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.619
Peter was the president of the
Ecological Society in the UK.

00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:54.588
He's a botanist at Cambridge.
 

00:27:54.588 --> 00:27:59.599
And what he's done here is plot
the log of seed mass of

00:27:59.599 --> 00:28:04.517
light-demanding seeds,
against the log of seed mass of

00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:06.930
shade- tolerant seeds.
 

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.580
And his question was this:
Do plants living in shade

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.088
produce larger seeds than plants
living in sun?

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:17.087
And he wanted to do a
phylogenetically controlled

00:28:17.087 --> 00:28:17.900
comparison.
 

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:23.516
So what he's doing here is he's
taking essentially the value

00:28:23.516 --> 00:28:27.019
within a genus,
or within a family--the mean

00:28:27.019 --> 00:28:30.730
value of species within a genus
or the mean value of genera

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.675
within families--
for related trees,

00:28:33.675 --> 00:28:39.048
some of which live in open
areas and demand light for their

00:28:39.048 --> 00:28:42.540
germination,
and others of which have seeds

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.558
that can germinate and survive
in the shade.

00:28:45.558 --> 00:28:48.823
So the open circles are
comparing genera within

00:28:48.823 --> 00:28:53.078
families, and the closed circles
are comparing species within

00:28:53.078 --> 00:28:53.858
genera.
 

00:28:53.858 --> 00:28:59.578
And what you see here basically
is this.

00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:03.259
Plants living in shade do
produce larger seeds than plants

00:29:03.259 --> 00:29:05.583
living in sun,
but you only see it in

00:29:05.583 --> 00:29:08.230
comparison of genera within
families;

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:13.568
you don't see it in comparison
of species within genera.

00:29:13.568 --> 00:29:13.888
Okay?
 

00:29:13.888 --> 00:29:17.719
So the ones that need light and
the ones that need shade have

00:29:17.719 --> 00:29:21.486
just about exactly the same seed
size, if you are looking at

00:29:21.486 --> 00:29:23.210
species within genera.
 

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.630
But if you then give them
longer to evolve,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.868
you go further out on the
phylogenetic tree,

00:29:28.868 --> 00:29:32.470
you compare things between
families,

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.903
where that contrast is
possible, then you start to see

00:29:35.903 --> 00:29:38.430
them moving off the one-to-one
line,

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.851
and the ones that are
shade-tolerant have seeds which

00:29:41.851 --> 00:29:44.220
are falling quite a bit-- not
all;

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.960
this is an exception--but quite
a bit above the line.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.429
So this is a way not only to
answer that kind of question,

00:29:51.429 --> 00:29:56.055
using the comparative method,
but also to get an estimate on

00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:57.779
how long it takes.
 

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:01.246
It takes a long time to
generate that difference,

00:30:01.246 --> 00:30:05.288
because you only see it at a
higher level on the tree.

00:30:05.288 --> 00:30:10.190
Now what about the albatrosses
and their relatives?

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.484
These are the
Procellariiformes,

00:30:12.484 --> 00:30:13.670
the Tubenoses.
 

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.843
You can see the Tubenose right
here--and that's a Wandering

00:30:16.843 --> 00:30:19.419
Albatross;
and you can see the Tubenose

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:21.269
right here on this Petrel.
 

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:23.759
And these things have totally
different life histories.

00:30:23.759 --> 00:30:25.680
Okay?
 

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.516
The Wandering Albatross,
which has a wingspread of

00:30:30.516 --> 00:30:34.068
between twelve and thirteen
feet,

00:30:34.068 --> 00:30:37.180
and is probably the heaviest
flying bird,

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.368
it lives on islands in the
Southern Ocean.

00:30:41.368 --> 00:30:46.631
And it mates,
usually starting at about the

00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:53.182
age of twelve or fifteen or so,
and it usually will produce an

00:30:53.182 --> 00:30:55.859
offspring every other year or
so,

00:30:55.859 --> 00:30:58.980
for about thirty or forty years.
 

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.990
They mate for life;
they're monogamous.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:07.328
And they have very precise
homing behavior to their chicks.

00:31:07.328 --> 00:31:11.476
They lay their eggs on places
like South Georgia,

00:31:11.476 --> 00:31:15.710
Macquarie Island,
places in the Southern Ocean.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:20.103
And some French biologists put
a radio collar on one of these

00:31:20.103 --> 00:31:24.130
Wandering Albatrosses and
tracked the mother as she took

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.618
off to go get lunch,
for baby.

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:29.480
And she flew north,
from South Georgia,

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.323
and she peeled off towards
Australia and flew up the West

00:31:32.323 --> 00:31:34.862
Coast of Australia,
and came back across the Indian

00:31:34.862 --> 00:31:36.788
Ocean and down the East Coast of
Africa,

00:31:36.788 --> 00:31:40.328
and back down to South Georgia
a month later;

00:31:40.328 --> 00:31:42.491
at which point baby,
by that point,

00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:45.798
was extremely hungry,
got a lunch of rotten squid.

00:31:45.798 --> 00:31:50.728
And this wide foraging means
that they're only going to be

00:31:50.728 --> 00:31:54.358
raising one child every two
years or so;

00:31:54.358 --> 00:31:57.586
and there are all kinds of
adaptations in the infant's

00:31:57.586 --> 00:32:00.569
physiology to deal with this
irregular feeding.

00:32:00.569 --> 00:32:03.789
A Storm-Petrel is a lot smaller.
 

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.960
It forages much closer to shore.
 

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.029
It is not so faithful to its
mate.

00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:10.538
These things are related.
 

00:32:10.538 --> 00:32:10.932
Okay?
 

00:32:10.932 --> 00:32:15.502
So if you look within this
family, can you ask the question

00:32:15.502 --> 00:32:20.073
about whether or not a long life
really is a situation that

00:32:20.073 --> 00:32:22.278
promotes mate fidelity?
 

00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:28.549
The argument there is basically
that if you're going to have a

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:31.508
short life,
there isn't going to be enough

00:32:31.508 --> 00:32:34.596
time to pick up the advantages
that you would get from knowing

00:32:34.596 --> 00:32:37.653
a particular mate,
and adapting behavior to that

00:32:37.653 --> 00:32:40.213
particular mate,
and learning exactly how to be

00:32:40.213 --> 00:32:42.109
a good parent with that
particular mate,

00:32:42.109 --> 00:32:44.298
rather than with some other.
 

00:32:44.298 --> 00:32:48.380
And if you look across the
Procellariiformes;

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:55.009
so this would be the Wandering
Albatross up here,

00:32:55.009 --> 00:32:57.068
and this would be a Petrel down
here,

00:32:57.068 --> 00:32:58.828
and you've got some other
things in the middle--

00:32:58.828 --> 00:33:00.799
these are all separate species
now;

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:03.140
the dots here are all species.
 

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.172
And we have here a study in
which--you are looking at

00:33:07.172 --> 00:33:10.893
independent contrasts now,
and we're plotting the

00:33:10.893 --> 00:33:12.910
independent contrasts.
 

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:17.964
So this is the deviation in
adult life expectancy from an

00:33:17.964 --> 00:33:20.637
overall mean,
for the whole group,

00:33:20.637 --> 00:33:24.137
and this is the deviation in
mate fidelity from an overall

00:33:24.137 --> 00:33:24.630
mean.
 

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.502
So the ones that tend to live a
long time are more faithful to

00:33:27.502 --> 00:33:29.868
their mates,
and the ones that tend to live,

00:33:29.868 --> 00:33:32.738
have a short life,
are much less faithful to their

00:33:32.738 --> 00:33:34.130
mates and switch mates.
 

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.424
And that's interesting because
in fact these guys,

00:33:36.424 --> 00:33:38.720
the ones that reproduce many
times, have much more

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.470
opportunity.
 

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.400
They have thirty or forty years
of reproduction.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.721
They could go out and they
could get divorced and pair

00:33:44.721 --> 00:33:46.098
again several times.
 

00:33:46.098 --> 00:33:48.868
But they don't,
they stick together.

00:33:48.868 --> 00:33:52.835
And the functional reasons for
that are things that are not

00:33:52.835 --> 00:33:55.160
really terribly well understood.
 

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.970
Student:  What's
negative mate fidelity?

00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.808
Prof: What?
 

00:33:59.808 --> 00:34:00.740
Student:  Negative mate
fidelity.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.821
Prof: Negative mate
fidelity is just a statistical

00:34:02.821 --> 00:34:03.118
thing.
 

00:34:03.118 --> 00:34:06.032
They are taking the
overall--they've measured mate

00:34:06.032 --> 00:34:08.998
fidelity on some scale,
they've taken an average for

00:34:08.998 --> 00:34:11.286
the whole group,
and then they are asking,

00:34:11.286 --> 00:34:14.150
how far does this species
deviate from the average?

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.018
So if it's below average,
it gets a negative number,

00:34:16.018 --> 00:34:18.000
and if it's above average it
gets a positive number.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.969
Okay?
 

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:28.579
Okay, so now I want to ask you
a question that comes right out

00:34:28.579 --> 00:34:33.619
of molecular phylogenetics,
and I want to see whether or

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:37.072
not you can actually put
together some information that

00:34:37.072 --> 00:34:39.949
you've now gotten from different
lectures.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:46.579
So this is going to require you
to piece together phylogenetics

00:34:46.579 --> 00:34:48.719
and genetic drift.
 

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:55.523
So this is the figure from the
Becky Cann/Allan Wilson paper

00:34:55.523 --> 00:34:59.789
that came out now twenty years
ago.

00:34:59.789 --> 00:35:03.969
It's basically on human
mitochondrial evolution.

00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:08.998
And what it showed was that all
human mitochondria appear to be

00:35:08.998 --> 00:35:14.143
derived from an ancestor,
all of whose closest relatives

00:35:14.143 --> 00:35:16.697
now--
the close relatives now are all

00:35:16.697 --> 00:35:19.969
out at the tip of the tree--
lived in Africa.

00:35:19.969 --> 00:35:23.130
You don't start picking up
non-African members of this tree

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.844
until you get out to this point,
and then you can see that by

00:35:26.844 --> 00:35:29.360
the time you get way out on the
tree,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.219
that most of these now are
non-Africans.

00:35:33.219 --> 00:35:36.251
So assertion number one out of
this is, hey,

00:35:36.251 --> 00:35:39.989
human mitochondria show that we
came out of Africa.

00:35:39.989 --> 00:35:41.829
Well we now know from that
paper I showed you more

00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:44.072
recently,
from SNP polymorphisms,

00:35:44.072 --> 00:35:47.889
that this is an extremely well
supported thing,

00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:51.030
and that we see it in the
nuclear genes as well.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.150
But the claim here was an
interesting one.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:36:00.380
It said there was one woman,
living in Africa,

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.891
about 220,000 years ago,
from whom all other

00:36:03.891 --> 00:36:08.630
mitochondria in all humans on
the planet are descended,

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.900
and so they gave her the name
Mitochondrial Eve;

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.320
that's observation number one.
 

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:21.418
Observation number two--and
this now comes from an

00:36:21.418 --> 00:36:29.117
immunobiology group in Germany--
and basically it has to do with

00:36:29.117 --> 00:36:34.489
how old are the polymorphisms in
our MHC genes?

00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:37.469
And these are things that have
been selected,

00:36:37.469 --> 00:36:40.585
probably through frequency
dependent selection,

00:36:40.585 --> 00:36:42.889
in co-evolution with diseases.
 

00:36:42.889 --> 00:36:44.949
And the observation is this.
 

00:36:44.949 --> 00:36:50.244
Say we have two MHC genes that
have resulted from a gene

00:36:50.244 --> 00:36:53.184
duplication--
and that would be this one here

00:36:53.184 --> 00:36:56.614
and this one here--
and at each of those genes

00:36:56.614 --> 00:37:00.692
there is a polymorphism,
so that we have different

00:37:00.692 --> 00:37:04.139
alleles at that locus,
for each of those two genes.

00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:09.849
Who are those alleles most
closely related to?

00:37:09.849 --> 00:37:14.065
Well it turns out that Allele 1
in humans is most closely

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:19.210
related to Allele 1 in chimps,
and Allele 2 in humans is most

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:22.670
closely related to Allele 2 in
chimps.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.898
In other words,
the closest relatives of the

00:37:24.898 --> 00:37:28.289
alleles are not in this species;
they're in another species.

00:37:28.289 --> 00:37:34.367
The only possible way that that
could have occurred is if the

00:37:34.367 --> 00:37:39.940
polymorphism originated before
the speciation event--

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.420
okay?--so that you had
ancestral species here,

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:48.777
and this polymorphism
originated, and you got this one

00:37:48.777 --> 00:37:54.539
coming down from the ancestral
species into the chimp,

00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:58.226
and into the human;
and this one coming down from

00:37:58.226 --> 00:38:01.539
the ancestral species into the
chimp and into the human.

00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:06.438
Now, on the one hand we have
the claim all the mitochondria

00:38:06.438 --> 00:38:08.550
came out of one person.
 

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.150
On the other hand we have
evidence that there are

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.829
trans-specific polymorphisms.
 

00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:16.288
And if you take this point in
time and you put it on this

00:38:16.288 --> 00:38:17.769
tree, it's about here.
 

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:24.789
I now want you to talk to each
other for a minute,

00:38:24.789 --> 00:38:27.460
and then we'll see if you can
come up with the explanation for

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.090
how those two observations are
consistent with each other.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.219
So just turn to your partner
and figure it out.

00:38:38.219 --> 00:40:47.179
&lt;&lt;Students confer with
one another&gt;&gt;

00:40:47.179 --> 00:40:50.159
Prof: Silence descends.
 

00:40:50.159 --> 00:40:52.480
Enlightenment has been reached.
 

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.166
Okay, can anybody tell me why
they are not surprised that all

00:40:56.166 --> 00:40:58.809
of the mitochondria came from
one female?

00:41:03.889 --> 00:41:05.650
Why are you not surprised?
 

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.355
Student:  Because
they're going to come down

00:41:07.355 --> 00:41:07.969
through meiosis.
 

00:41:07.969 --> 00:41:12.007
It comes down…
Prof: It's asexually

00:41:12.007 --> 00:41:12.768
inherited.
 

00:41:12.768 --> 00:41:16.467
How many females do you think
there were in the African

00:41:16.467 --> 00:41:18.590
population 220,000 years ago?
 

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:27.184
Do you think the second
observation tells us anything

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:30.719
about that, the trans-specific
polymorphism?

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:39.420
What happens when a population
is really small?

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.860
You get genetic drift.
 

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.175
If a population were as small
as one female,

00:41:57.175 --> 00:42:01.648
it would've been impossible to
maintain this trans-specific

00:42:01.648 --> 00:42:02.960
polymorphism.
 

00:42:09.239 --> 00:42:13.577
People have done simulations to
find out what is the average

00:42:13.577 --> 00:42:18.079
size of a population that would,
over a period of 5,000,000

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:22.606
years, maintain the amount of
trans-specific polymorphism that

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:25.443
we see in our MHC complex;
in other words,

00:42:25.443 --> 00:42:27.860
the amount of genes that we
share with chimpanzees,

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.920
where our alleles are more
closely related to the chimp's

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.710
alleles than they are to the
other human alleles?

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:37.780
And the answer is the minimum
size is about 10,000.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.351
In other words,
we have good genetic

00:42:40.351 --> 00:42:44.173
information that tells us that
the smallest the human

00:42:44.173 --> 00:42:47.360
population ever has been,
over the last several

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.409
hundred-thousand years,
actually over the last

00:42:49.409 --> 00:42:51.599
5,000,000 years,
since we shared ancestors with

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:55.079
chimps,
is about 10,000.

00:42:55.079 --> 00:42:58.210
Okay?
 

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:02.896
Given that, now tell me,
are you surprised that we can

00:43:02.896 --> 00:43:06.965
trace all the mitochondria,
in all the females on the

00:43:06.965 --> 00:43:11.166
planet, back to one woman,
living in East Africa about

00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:13.010
220,000 years ago?
 

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:16.639
And if you're not surprised,
I want to know why.

00:43:16.639 --> 00:43:18.030
Yes?
 

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.385
Student:  Well you were
talking before about how

00:43:20.385 --> 00:43:22.610
recessive genes spread out in a
small population.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:28.105
So if she had enough children
over enough generations,

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:31.422
you'd have enough of a
population

00:43:31.422 --> 00:43:34.429
&gt;
 

00:43:34.429 --> 00:43:36.539
Prof: Okay,
it's possible that in fact she

00:43:36.539 --> 00:43:39.210
had a particularly advantageous
mitochondrion,

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.610
and that it then got selected
and it fixed,

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.590
and then everything would go
back to her.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.380
That's correct.
 

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.500
And that could've been done in
a larger population.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.619
However, it could also have
been done with drift,

00:43:51.619 --> 00:43:54.346
and it happened so long ago
that we can't really tell

00:43:54.346 --> 00:43:57.335
whether it was selection or
drift that gave that one woman

00:43:57.335 --> 00:43:58.280
the advantage.
 

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.090
By the way, the same thing has
been done for the Y chromosome.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:05.070
Okay, the Y chromosome is also
asexually inherited,

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.606
and the estimate on the Y
chromosome is roughly also about

00:44:09.606 --> 00:44:13.030
200,000 years ago,
also in East Africa.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.271
And the fact that the
mitochondrion and the Y

00:44:15.271 --> 00:44:17.820
chromosome both converged to a
common ancestor,

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:22.112
at about the same age,
might suggest that drift is

00:44:22.112 --> 00:44:25.880
more likely than selection to
explain it.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.389
But basically what's going on,
if you think about it,

00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:32.382
is that in any process like
that, if you go back far enough

00:44:32.382 --> 00:44:34.922
in time,
it will always converge on a

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:36.449
single common ancestor.
 

00:44:36.449 --> 00:44:38.380
Okay?
 

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:42.684
Now the next thing I'd like to
tell you is that there was a

00:44:42.684 --> 00:44:45.579
controversy about when that
happened;

00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:51.163
and the controversy on dating
that point of convergence is all

00:44:51.163 --> 00:44:56.289
about how long has it been since
we split with chimps?

00:44:56.289 --> 00:45:01.715
Because that turns out to be
the baseline that gives us an

00:45:01.715 --> 00:45:06.380
estimate of how rapidly
evolution is going on,

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.889
molecular evolution is going
on, in the human clade.

00:45:09.889 --> 00:45:12.885
Well when you apply that
criterion to what the confidence

00:45:12.885 --> 00:45:15.822
limits on the estimate are,
hey, it was anywhere from last

00:45:15.822 --> 00:45:17.380
year to about a million years
ago.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.929
&gt;
 

00:45:18.929 --> 00:45:21.460
So the confidence limits are
lousy.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.007
The observation,
however, that that person was

00:45:25.007 --> 00:45:31.445
in Africa is pretty solid and,
as I say, is now confirmed by

00:45:31.445 --> 00:45:35.706
the nuclear genes,
the SNPs that I showed you

00:45:35.706 --> 00:45:37.199
earlier in the lecture.
 

00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:41.213
So the point of this exercise
is that when you see results

00:45:41.213 --> 00:45:43.835
like this,
when you see some claim of

00:45:43.835 --> 00:45:47.610
Mitochondrial Eve,
or Y Chromosome Adam--which are

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.309
both out there in the
literature;

00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:52.545
just go on Web of Science,
type Mitochondrial Eve,

00:45:52.545 --> 00:45:54.780
you'll pick up a lot of
controversy about this.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.222
I want you to realize that (a)
we should never be surprised if

00:45:59.222 --> 00:46:03.373
particular mitochondria or
particular chromosomes converge

00:46:03.373 --> 00:46:07.688
at some point in time--
it looks like they were just in

00:46:07.688 --> 00:46:08.900
one individual.
 

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.579
That's just because of the way
that branching processes work,

00:46:12.579 --> 00:46:16.322
and that will be going on all
the time, and it's happened over

00:46:16.322 --> 00:46:18.039
and over and over again.
 

00:46:18.039 --> 00:46:21.369
So it's no surprise that it
goes back to one person.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:28.550
The other point that I would
like to bring out is that if you

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.559
contrast different kinds of
historical evidence,

00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:34.309
you can often gain
enlightenment by seeing that

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:36.940
there is a puzzle that needs to
be solved.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.820
And in this case the puzzle
basically is that this tells us

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:44.900
something about population size,
and this tells us very little

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.639
about population size.
 

00:46:46.639 --> 00:46:49.197
This process,
convergence back to a single

00:46:49.197 --> 00:46:52.764
ancestor from the mitochondria,
it's not entirely independent

00:46:52.764 --> 00:46:55.039
of population size--
it'll take longer in a big

00:46:55.039 --> 00:46:57.360
population than it would in a
small population--

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.773
but it doesn't give us an
estimate of how big the

00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:00.929
population had to be.
 

00:47:00.929 --> 00:47:04.199
Whereas the trans-specific
polymorphism could only have

00:47:04.199 --> 00:47:07.525
been maintained,
even with strong selection,

00:47:07.525 --> 00:47:12.599
in a population that was larger
than about 10,000 individuals;

00:47:12.599 --> 00:47:15.889
and that can be done with
computer simulations.

00:47:15.889 --> 00:47:21.755
So these are different forms of
enlightenment into the history

00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:26.728
of genes in a particular clade;
a history that happens to

00:47:26.728 --> 00:47:28.599
matter to us quite a bit.
 

00:47:28.599 --> 00:47:34.369
And we can gain that by looking
carefully at phylogenetic trees.

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:36.349
These are actually both
phylogenetic trees.

00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:39.766
This tree here is just laid on
its side, and you'll find that

00:47:39.766 --> 00:47:42.730
this is commoner and commoner
practice these days.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.500
If you look at the cover of
Nature,

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.101
or Science,
or the--actually the one I

00:47:49.101 --> 00:47:52.590
remember is in the New York
Times Science Section for

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:55.940
Darwin's birthday,
on February 12^(th).

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.733
That week the Science Section
had a phylogenetic tree covering

00:48:00.733 --> 00:48:04.088
Darwin's face,
and it had thousands of species

00:48:04.088 --> 00:48:05.909
on it,
and they're laid out this way,

00:48:05.909 --> 00:48:08.510
just so that you can fit the
species onto a piece of paper.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:14.840
So time kind of wraps around,
in the way it's presented.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:20.371
Okay, so to summarize this part
of our exploration of

00:48:20.371 --> 00:48:22.179
macroevolution.
 

00:48:22.179 --> 00:48:25.666
These molecular methods allow
us to reconstruct geographic

00:48:25.666 --> 00:48:27.869
movements, as well as
phylogenies.

00:48:27.869 --> 00:48:30.976
And we saw that in the
hedgehogs going north from Spain

00:48:30.976 --> 00:48:33.327
and the Balkans,
and we saw it in the humans

00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:37.969
moving out of Africa,
and we saw it in lots of things.

00:48:37.969 --> 00:48:41.519
We see that our own migrations
have left genetic traces on all

00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:42.510
the continents.
 

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:46.322
And there's an imprecise map
that's suggestive between the

00:48:46.322 --> 00:48:49.599
genetic geography and the
linguistic geography.

00:48:49.599 --> 00:48:52.608
Greek genes go with Greek
family names,

00:48:52.608 --> 00:48:55.775
from the boot of Italy,
up to about Rome,

00:48:55.775 --> 00:48:58.619
and then stop;
that kind of thing.

00:48:58.619 --> 00:49:02.248
So even in the last two or
three-thousand years,

00:49:02.248 --> 00:49:06.956
you can see that family names
and genes have been inherited in

00:49:06.956 --> 00:49:08.268
similar ways.
 

00:49:08.268 --> 00:49:10.954
We can use these methods to
determine which trait states

00:49:10.954 --> 00:49:12.860
were ancestral and which are
derived.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.217
And that was particularly
interesting in the case of the

00:49:15.217 --> 00:49:17.425
parasitic wasp,
whether it was an ectoparasite

00:49:17.425 --> 00:49:20.793
or an endoparasite,
because it changed received

00:49:20.793 --> 00:49:23.860
opinion about fundamental
biology.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.672
And this method that Joe
Felsenstein worked out for

00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:29.708
independent contrast is
something that will control for

00:49:29.708 --> 00:49:32.224
common ancestry,
and it can reveal the

00:49:32.224 --> 00:49:35.721
correlated changes in two or
more traits that have taken

00:49:35.721 --> 00:49:38.010
place since branches in the
tree.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:43.958
So it can be used as a fairly
powerful method to explore

00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:49.800
hypotheses in behavioral
ecology, evolutionary ecology,

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.639
and ethology.
 

00:49:51.639 --> 00:49:54.344
So next time we're going to
start talking about key events

00:49:54.344 --> 00:49:57.250
in the history of life;
it's the first of three ways to

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.860
look at the history of life.

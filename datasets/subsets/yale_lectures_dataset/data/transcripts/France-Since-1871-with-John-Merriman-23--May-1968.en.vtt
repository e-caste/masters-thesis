00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.240
Professor John Merriman:
All right,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.055
I want to today talk about
1968, which I can even remember,

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:07.900
though I wasn't in France in
1968.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:17.078
First of all 1968 has to be put
in the context of mobilization

00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:23.580
across Western Europe,
and indeed in some places in

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.433
the United States,
that had more to do with than

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:34.067
simply reform in universities,
but had a lot to do with the

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.330
world, as people like me saw it
in 1968.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:45.073
It was a time when the
Americans were at war in Vietnam

00:00:45.073 --> 00:00:51.240
and student protests had begun
to expand.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.584
The first teach-in against the
War in Vietnam was in the

00:00:56.584 --> 00:01:00.180
University of Michigan,
in Haven Hall,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.969
in about 1966,
or maybe '65 or '66.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.224
And the movement spread in the
United States,

00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:16.269
and of course you've read about
1970 at Yale when people,

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:20.306
the exams never happened,
and it was the time of the

00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:23.439
Bobby Seale trial.
And, so, this sort of

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.761
generation, this sort of baby
boom generation,

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:29.975
whether it was in Rome,
or in Athens,

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:32.566
or in Berlin,
or Bruxelles,

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:37.250
or in even Munich,
though less so in Munich,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.477
or in Madison,
Wisconsin or in Berkeley,

00:01:40.477 --> 00:01:45.030
California, where the Free
Speech Movement had started a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.161
couple of years before that--it
was all sort of linked together

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:55.376
as people thought about what the
downsides of the new prosperity

00:01:55.376 --> 00:01:59.680
that had come in France and
other countries,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.793
and the expansion of the
university system to include

00:02:04.793 --> 00:02:10.154
more people.
And, so, the sort of waves of

00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:14.408
protest were linked.
And in the case of France,

00:02:14.408 --> 00:02:17.304
which is what we're talking
about, there were really two

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:20.373
aspects of it.
There were the strikes-- more

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:24.420
about that in a minute--and then
there were the student

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.641
demonstrations,
the riots, the aggressive

00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:31.909
reaction by the so-called
"forces of order," which is what

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.569
they liked to call themselves,
and leading eventually to the

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.310
resignation of Charles de
Gaulle.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.821
So, it was at a time,
rather like 1936,

00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:50.088
when everything seemed possible
and it was a time of great

00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:53.207
optimism.
And there are all sorts of

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:57.190
books published of the graffiti
of 1968, as students,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.562
most of whom smoked in those
days, went into the Odéon

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:02.530
theater and unfortunately
burned,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.253
with their cigarettes,
the beautiful chairs of the

00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:08.031
Odéon theater,
and when speeches went on and

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:12.363
on in the Sorbonne.
The war of words was written on

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:17.779
the walls of the subways,
as I guess Simon and Garfunkle

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.357
once sang,
but of the métro

00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:25.110
in Paris and on the walls of the
Quartier Latin.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.173
"Long live communication,
down with telecommunication,"

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:33.839
reflected the great uncertainty
that technology and push-button

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:38.280
remote controls and all of this
was not enough in life.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.379
"The more I make love the more
I make the revolution;

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.060
the more I make the revolution
the more I make love."

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.419
"Every view of things which is
not strange is false."

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.214
"Amnesty, an act through which
sovereigns forgive the

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:58.716
injustices they have
committed"--that's not a bad

00:03:58.716 --> 00:04:01.229
one.
"Mankind will not live free

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:05.444
until the last capitalist has
been hanged in the entrails of

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:08.659
the last bureaucrat"--not a very
nice one,

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.203
that, nor very original because
that came from the French

00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:15.810
Revolution, the radical phase of
the French Revolution,

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.474
that "we all be safe only when
the last priest has been hung in

00:04:20.474 --> 00:04:25.290
the entrails--or strangled in
the entrails of the last noble."

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.710
So, there was--as they
quarreled, and they debated,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.423
and they battled,
everybody didn't agree on

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:36.371
everything,
and it was like the Paris

00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.070
Commune, and there were a lot of
childish aspects to it.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.077
It was a youthful resonance;
people my age,

00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:49.791
though most of them were older
than me, that in those days,

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:52.879
"Professors,
you are old," was one.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.619
And one I can remember,
and I believed it at the time,

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:59.160
"Never trust anybody over
thirty."

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.420
Thirty seems awfully young to
me now.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.165
It was in the wake of the
consumer revolution,

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:12.576
it was in the wake of the
thirty glorious years of the

00:05:12.576 --> 00:05:16.617
French economy expanding;
and the same thing happened,

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.060
the West German economic
miracle as well.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.074
It was a reaction to the kind
of technocratic society that

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.762
seemed unfulfilling,
that seemed to have turned

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:30.592
capitalism and the State,
that dynamic duo,

00:05:30.592 --> 00:05:35.706
loose on ordinary people.
And here it was tied to the war

00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:41.431
in Vietnam and a verbally,
rhetorically violent reaction

00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:47.780
against an American way of sort
of splitting up the world with

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.784
the Soviet Union;
and it has to be seen in all of

00:05:52.784 --> 00:05:55.370
that.
And it generated resistance.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.877
At the end--we'll come into
this in while--but there was a

00:05:59.877 --> 00:06:03.120
huge march down the
Champs-Elysées,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.380
and of the prosperous people.
And you could see them from the

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.573
16th arrondissement and
there were ladies in their fur

00:06:10.573 --> 00:06:12.490
coats and they're flashing
rings,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.022
and they were there to express
their solidarity with the

00:06:16.022 --> 00:06:19.939
General, to whom all of this
seemed something just strange,

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:22.314
from another planet,
that he couldn't comprehend,

00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:27.021
didn't want to deal with,
just wished it was all going to

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:31.774
go away.
In terms of--also you have to

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:36.820
put it--it is linked to America.
Because you have to

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.480
remember--and you weren't even
born then;

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.711
one of you was in this room,
besides me--Martin Luther King

00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:46.139
had just been murdered in
Memphis, Tennessee.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:52.551
And that was an enormous,
enormous event for people of my

00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:56.343
generation.
And it seemed that if you--the

00:06:56.343 --> 00:07:00.567
harder you worked for social
justice--people believed in

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:04.330
social justice and we believed
in associations and

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.464
organizations,
and then when people went out,

00:07:07.464 --> 00:07:10.087
down to Mississippi,
to work on the civil rights

00:07:10.087 --> 00:07:11.800
march,
and then they got murdered.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.973
And I remember going with a
couple of friends of mine from

00:07:14.973 --> 00:07:17.757
Jesuit High School and we
joined--went out to North

00:07:17.757 --> 00:07:22.480
Portland and joined the NAACP,
and we were sixteen-years-old,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.592
we'd just learned how to drive.
And if you believed in social

00:07:27.592 --> 00:07:31.562
justice-- and we weren't big
militants, though certainly

00:07:31.562 --> 00:07:34.087
during the war we were,
we all were,

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:37.863
or many of us were.
But then every time you took a

00:07:37.863 --> 00:07:40.860
big step forward,
then it just seemed like we

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.083
were confronted with the Lyndon
Johnsons and the Richard Nixons

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:49.638
of the world;
and with the murder of Martin

00:07:49.638 --> 00:07:52.668
Luther King.
And, so, these things did

00:07:52.668 --> 00:07:55.930
reflect a globalization,
just as the Algerian War--one

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.259
of the arguments that I made,
which is Matt Connolly's

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:02.716
argument, is that the Algerian
War reflected the globalization

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:06.253
of technology and newspapers,
and the rebels getting the

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:09.370
newspapers on their side about
French torture.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.877
Well, the globalization of news
with "Got Live from Vietnam" and

00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:18.199
all this business meant that
issues,

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:22.310
the murder of Martin Luther
King and the Americans plunging

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.350
more and more money and more and
more bodies into wars,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.132
in other places,
had ramifications from

00:08:29.132 --> 00:08:33.231
Nanterre--which I'll talk about
in a minute--which is the

00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:35.130
university,
one of them,

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.598
to the west of Paris,
and the Sorbonne which had been

00:08:38.598 --> 00:08:42.000
there for centuries and
centuries and centuries,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.470
since the Medieval Period,
in the Latin Quarter.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.388
So, the problems seemed,
did generate simplistic answers

00:08:48.388 --> 00:08:52.663
that if you thought hard and you
went out and worked that you

00:08:52.663 --> 00:08:55.870
could abolish the excesses of
capitalism,

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.840
you could abolish the excesses
of the State.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.727
And it would be a more
reasonable world,

00:09:00.727 --> 00:09:02.033
wouldn't it,
that the Lyndon

00:09:02.033 --> 00:09:04.798
Johnsonsâ€¦?
I remember, March 31st,

00:09:04.798 --> 00:09:08.220
1968, announced he would not
run for office.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.635
And the Richard Nixons,
that "people power"--that was a

00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:15.240
phrase that was used in France
and in the United States in

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.648
Berkley,
at Columbia,

00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:18.700
in Ann Arbor and all sorts of
places.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.332
But specifically in France it
had to do with a crisis of

00:09:23.332 --> 00:09:26.279
education, a crisis in
education,

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:30.778
that education in a society
that was still class-based,

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:34.110
and to an extent is still
class-based,

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.386
had remained the privilege of
the upper classes,

00:09:38.386 --> 00:09:43.482
even as the numbers of people
in the university system in

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:46.940
France had increased
dramatically,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.159
as all across Europe this had
happened.

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:55.350
In 1938 there were 79,000
university students in France.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:02.220
In 1958/59 there were 192,000,
in the same buildings.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:09.875
In 1967/'68,
there were 478,000--that is a

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:14.102
huge number.
And in 1968,

00:10:14.102 --> 00:10:19.878
just since 1967,
the number had increased by

00:10:19.878 --> 00:10:25.279
50,000 more, in one year.
Now, this is the baby boom.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.380
If you go back eighteen,
twenty years,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.651
before that,
you have the la fin de la

00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:32.490
guerre, you have the end of
World War Two.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.125
So, you've got all these little
babies who had grown up,

00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:40.159
like me, and were in
universities.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:45.318
But the university structure
could not possibly welcome all

00:10:45.318 --> 00:10:48.541
of these folks.
I have these really good

00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.822
friends in Lyon,
they actually now they live in

00:10:51.822 --> 00:10:54.889
Paris and they--I met a Greek
professor,

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:58.363
a long time ago,
and she was teaching in one of

00:10:58.363 --> 00:11:02.742
these huge Greek universities in
Athens where she had 1,000

00:11:02.742 --> 00:11:06.139
students in her class,
1,000, and no TAs.

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:11.283
You better come up with a
question that you can grade

00:11:11.283 --> 00:11:15.832
1,000 answers to--name three
people, name three

00:11:15.832 --> 00:11:20.149
nineteenth-century Greeks.
You better come up with...

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:24.509
It was an impossible situation
for students and for faculty.

00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:27.659
And as now, as in the issues
now, there wasn't light at the

00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:30.699
end of the tunnel because
compounding the fact that there

00:11:30.699 --> 00:11:33.576
weren't jobs--unless you were in
one of the grandes

00:11:33.576 --> 00:11:37.100
écoles,
that is the big, fancy schools;

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.697
unless you were an
anarque,

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:41.361
one of these people in the
administration school who was

00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:43.539
going to just slide into some
party post,

00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:47.519
in a Gaullist government,
what was there at the end?

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:50.727
And you also had this
extraordinary ambiguity,

00:11:50.727 --> 00:11:53.649
in thinking about this,
or ambivalence,

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:56.712
because if you were basically
against the sort of

00:11:56.712 --> 00:11:59.455
technological,
super-powered society of fast

00:11:59.455 --> 00:12:02.229
cars,
and the Americanization of

00:12:02.229 --> 00:12:05.696
European culture,
if you believed strongly

00:12:05.696 --> 00:12:08.115
against that,
what kind of job is there going

00:12:08.115 --> 00:12:09.490
to be at the end of the tunnel
for you?

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.900
You can't be a professional
militant your entire life.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.115
What are you going to do?
And the people,

00:12:14.115 --> 00:12:16.787
by the way, who were,
who invested their careers,

00:12:16.787 --> 00:12:20.696
or lost their careers,
in this mobilization were toast

00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:24.350
because they refused to sit for
their exams,

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.542
and they committed professional
suicide, right on stage,

00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:30.225
because they did it.
And it all starts with the

00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:33.090
latter, when Daniel Cohn-Bendit,
who was a militant,

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.605
when he was expelled from the
University of Nanterre,

00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:42.227
because of his militancy.
So, there was a lack of jobs,

00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:46.861
particularly for those people
studying the life of the mind,

00:12:46.861 --> 00:12:49.139
studying arts,
the literature,

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:51.832
history.
And the structure had changed

00:12:51.832 --> 00:12:55.177
very little since Napoleon
bragged that when he created the

00:12:55.177 --> 00:12:58.753
académie that he
knew what everybody was studying

00:12:58.753 --> 00:13:01.654
at any given time;
it had not changed and to some

00:13:01.654 --> 00:13:04.855
extent it still hasn't changed
now--more about that maybe in a

00:13:04.855 --> 00:13:06.835
minute.
The structures of the

00:13:06.835 --> 00:13:09.259
universities were extremely
rigid.

00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:16.593
In 1964 two percent of the
university students were sons or

00:13:16.593 --> 00:13:23.799
daughters of workers and
peasants, two percent in 1964.

00:13:23.799 --> 00:13:28.409
This is what's called a class
society, and it had not changed

00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:32.481
very much by 1968--and people
blamed the state for the

00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:34.550
rigidity.
I have a friend,

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.697
in fact a Gaullist with whom I
waited in line to get into Notre

00:13:38.697 --> 00:13:41.440
Dame for the Charles de Gaulle
affair,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.558
who was supposed to take--he's
a lawyer and he was taking an

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:47.231
advanced degree,
and he lived in the suburbs and

00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:50.508
he stayed in--the prosperous
suburbs, fairly prosperous--but

00:13:50.508 --> 00:13:53.730
he stayed in Paris one night
because the metros closed,

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.502
the buses closed,
and if you didn't make the

00:13:56.502 --> 00:14:00.012
12:32 then you had a long walk;
and I've walked back to that

00:14:00.012 --> 00:14:03.023
suburb and hitchhiked back and
all of that--some funny stories

00:14:03.023 --> 00:14:04.899
about that but now is not the
time.

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:09.737
And he got back on Saturday to
find a pneumatique--which

00:14:09.737 --> 00:14:13.194
was a way of communicating,
these little things that shot

00:14:13.194 --> 00:14:15.705
around and then were delivered
to your--in tubes and they were

00:14:15.705 --> 00:14:18.258
delivered to your house--saying
that he was supposed to show up

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:20.183
for the exam;
and it had arrived on Friday,

00:14:20.183 --> 00:14:22.143
when he was at work,
and was supposed to take his

00:14:22.143 --> 00:14:24.275
exam on Saturday.
And of course he got it on

00:14:24.275 --> 00:14:26.299
Saturday at about noon,
when he got home,

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:29.480
after his long night in Paris;
and that was the end of that.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.733
Then you'd just simply say,
"well, I guess I'll take it

00:14:31.733 --> 00:14:33.570
next time around,
if I happen to be here."

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:39.366
It was a rigid system that was
unforgiving and seemed to be

00:14:39.366 --> 00:14:44.763
perpetuating the kind of elitism
and the kind of unfair

00:14:44.763 --> 00:14:50.360
sociopolitical world against
which people struggled.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.898
And 1967, in the worst economic
year of the '60s,

00:14:53.898 --> 00:14:56.995
as I've just said,
de Gaulle's response was

00:14:56.995 --> 00:14:59.074
typical.
He said, "well we need to have

00:14:59.074 --> 00:15:00.883
more participation."
Qu'est-ce que a veut

00:15:00.883 --> 00:15:03.254
dire, what does this mean to
have more participation,

00:15:03.254 --> 00:15:05.960
what do you mean by that?
Well he meant nothing by that.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.906
In October 1966 his workers
were getting increasingly

00:15:10.906 --> 00:15:14.139
militant and he said,
"you know,

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:18.527
the changes that we must bring
to the working-class condition

00:15:18.527 --> 00:15:22.841
is the active association of
work and the active association

00:15:22.841 --> 00:15:26.570
of the economy which we all want
to accomplish,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.480
all of us."
What does this mean?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.009
It means nothing,
it means nothing.

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:35.269
And, so, phrases like that,
sentences like that are

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:39.700
reassuring for the upper classes
in Paris or Lyon,

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.583
in the sixth
arrondissement of Lyon,

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:43.018
or wherever,
who don't want to be

00:15:43.018 --> 00:15:46.799
bousculer,
they don't want to be bothered

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:51.059
by the militancy of students and
of workers.

00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:53.585
They want the metros to run,
they want the buses to run,

00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:56.340
they don't want the students
building barricades and all this

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.032
stuff.
So it's reassuring to them but

00:15:58.032 --> 00:16:00.719
it didn't mean anything.
De Gaulle was so completely out

00:16:00.719 --> 00:16:02.806
of it, he said,
"je suis coupé

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:06.134
des Francais;"
"I'm adrift from the French,

00:16:06.134 --> 00:16:09.754
I'm cut off from the French,"
because he had no

00:16:09.754 --> 00:16:14.005
understanding--that the
nationalism of French should be

00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:16.113
enough,
that the mystical body of

00:16:16.113 --> 00:16:17.790
himself should certainly be
enough.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.665
But of course it wasn't.
And the demonstrations,

00:16:20.665 --> 00:16:23.250
many of them organized by the
National Union of Students,

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:28.318
which had begun--which was
militant, had begun in the

00:16:28.318 --> 00:16:34.141
1950s, or maybe the '40s,
I don't remember--its militancy

00:16:34.141 --> 00:16:40.010
had declined after the Algerian
War, but then you have the

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.961
students leaders,
whose names you don't remember,

00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:46.830
but they were young,
often young sociologists,

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.131
or one was in physics,
Alain Jeanmaire,

00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:52.522
names don't matter--well they
did to them and they did to

00:16:52.522 --> 00:16:56.276
people of my generation but they
don't necessarily to you--they

00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:59.909
were in sociology or mostly in
literature and history,

00:16:59.909 --> 00:17:05.880
and they all committed together
professional suicide.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.420
And, so, it begins with
demonstrations in Nanterre.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.247
Now, the French university
system began with the Sorbonne,

00:17:14.247 --> 00:17:18.029
and the Latin Quarter is so
called,

00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:19.497
as you know,
because that's what people

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:22.107
spoke in the Middle Ages.
Students conversed in Latin,

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:25.796
Latin was a living language.
And the second medical school

00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:28.950
in Europe is Montpellier;
the first was Bologne.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.908
And there was already a very
strong university in Lyon,

00:17:32.908 --> 00:17:36.720
and there was X and there were
other universities.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.914
But the big expansion of even
the Paris system and of

00:17:40.914 --> 00:17:45.190
provincial universities has come
in response, in part,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.740
to these big events,
in this heady time.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.325
But they haven't necessarily
brought many changes,

00:17:53.325 --> 00:17:58.493
as we'll see later.
And, so, there's also lack of a

00:17:58.493 --> 00:18:01.114
campus.
I've taught at Lyon,

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:04.883
at Lyon II, and I teach in
Rouen sometimes,

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:08.089
and there's,
with the exception of Grenoble,

00:18:08.089 --> 00:18:11.930
which has a fairly nice campus,
maybe Montpellier a little bit,

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.572
most of the places,
students don't,

00:18:14.572 --> 00:18:17.759
most of them don't live in
dormitories,

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:20.445
and so they're just places
where they go--they're

00:18:20.445 --> 00:18:22.460
essentially all-commuter
colleges.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.768
If you go to Lyon,
University of Lyon,

00:18:24.768 --> 00:18:28.510
I, II or II--they're also named
in such a not terribly poetic

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.842
way.
University of Paris has

00:18:30.842 --> 00:18:33.630
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,
9,10,11,12,13,14.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.700
So, you say,
"where are you a student?"

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.144
"Moi je suis à
Paris VII" "Moi je suis

00:18:38.144 --> 00:18:40.859
à Paris XIV"--good
luck if you're at Paris XIV,

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:45.041
that's Villetaneuse,
and oh my god it's just

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.670
unbelievable.
These are buildings that were

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.970
built, already falling apart and
they're just out there,

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.606
and they're soulless and it's
aâ€¦ You're privileged,

00:18:53.606 --> 00:18:56.350
you've worked very hard to be
privileged.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:00.262
In Michigan we were privileged.
But you can't--there's no sense

00:19:00.262 --> 00:19:02.470
of solidarity.
There's nothing to do.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.109
There are no sports really
basically;

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.359
there's the equivalent of club
sports.

00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:08.140
They would just sit around and
smoke cigarettes.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.941
And there's just not much to
do, there's no sense of

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.687
esprit de corps,
there's no sense of being a

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:17.106
former student of that place.
It's part of your existence for

00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:19.542
three years--unless you're one
of the grandes

00:19:19.542 --> 00:19:22.289
écoles or the fancy
folks and all that.

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:26.696
So, even trying to get people
to mobilize against the

00:19:26.696 --> 00:19:30.265
structure isn't very easy.
But the conditions,

00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:33.599
they start out with these
demonstrations against these

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:36.608
conditions.
This is also tied--and this is

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:40.438
a point I stupidly forgot to
mention early--the women's

00:19:40.438 --> 00:19:44.613
movement,
although not terribly dominant

00:19:44.613 --> 00:19:50.817
in France, still essentially
limited--this is probably an

00:19:50.817 --> 00:19:54.201
exaggeration,
but to the middle class

00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:58.055
feminists, influenced by Simone
de Beauvoir, the women's

00:19:58.055 --> 00:20:02.609
movement also meant that lots of
women put forth their claims;

00:20:02.609 --> 00:20:05.038
and again, as I said,
that the vast majority of the

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:08.303
students are bourgeois students,
they're upper class students

00:20:08.303 --> 00:20:10.549
and so--but that still was part
of it.

00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:14.080
And the way society is
structured in the United States

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.210
then where sexism was even more
endemic then than it is now,

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.210
that for militant females this
was part of the problem too.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.725
There was so much that seemed
to have to be changed that it

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:31.309
was very frustrating.
And, so, there are occupations.

00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:34.076
People in the United States
occupied administrative

00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:36.443
buildings.
Unfortunately they often

00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:39.516
destroyed books.
It happened at Columbia and

00:20:39.516 --> 00:20:42.471
places like that.
But there was lots of student

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:45.541
occupations--at Yale there were
too, I wasn't around,

00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:48.045
but there were too.
And the National Guard,

00:20:48.045 --> 00:20:51.347
if you can imagine the National
Guard tanks coming up--John Blum

00:20:51.347 --> 00:20:53.476
has told me about that,
my colleague,

00:20:53.476 --> 00:20:55.599
former colleague,
now long retired.

00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:58.937
But Branford College was le
college rouge,

00:20:58.937 --> 00:21:03.179
and I guess they had a red flag
up or something and tanks were

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:07.630
coming down--if you can imagine
tanks coming up York Street,

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.289
between J.E.
and Pearson or between

00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:14.502
Davenport and Branford,
and they were setting up little

00:21:14.502 --> 00:21:18.012
welcome centers and possible
places to treat people that are

00:21:18.012 --> 00:21:21.523
injured by the National Guard
who wanted nothing of militant

00:21:21.523 --> 00:21:24.779
privileged students,
and then May 4th^(,) 1970,

00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:28.080
gunned them down at Kent State
with great pleasure.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.338
These were different times.
But, anyway,

00:21:31.338 --> 00:21:34.592
so in France they start
occupying buildings,

00:21:34.592 --> 00:21:38.680
and on May--the Sorbonne is
closed down on May 2nd.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.559
And on May 3rd the police move
in.

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:46.650
Now, the police,
the CRS were hated,

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.818
were hated.
The CRS, many of them were

00:21:49.818 --> 00:21:53.750
southerners, and the rumors--and
I can remember these rumors,

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:58.233
that they were kept in their
barracks and not fed enough and

00:21:58.233 --> 00:22:02.640
given special sections on why
militant workers and militant

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.276
students represented the end of
civilization as they had known

00:22:07.276 --> 00:22:09.644
it.
And they had their big--you can

00:22:09.644 --> 00:22:12.795
still see this now because many
of them feel they have free

00:22:12.795 --> 00:22:15.240
reign now with Sarkozy--their
big shields,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.791
and their big helmets,
and what you call in French

00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:19.509
paniers à
salade,

00:22:19.509 --> 00:22:23.033
these big trucks that have
grills on them,

00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:27.581
like if you're shaking lettuce.
And they would suddenly come

00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:29.826
tearing along the place;
and it wasn't just

00:22:29.826 --> 00:22:31.100
circulez,
like move along,

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.170
move along, they'd just beat
the hell out of you.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.844
And we're still not sure how
many people died in all of this,

00:22:35.844 --> 00:22:37.940
how many people were battered
by these folks.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.342
But you can tell--I grew up
just hating these people,

00:22:40.342 --> 00:22:42.289
just hating them.
You'd walk along,

00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:45.244
in the '70s even,
they'd be down in their trucks

00:22:45.244 --> 00:22:48.954
on Boulevard Saint-Germain or
they'd be clustered around the

00:22:48.954 --> 00:22:52.272
Hôtel de Ville.
It's just a very contentious

00:22:52.272 --> 00:22:55.276
age, and you just grew up--if
you're my generation,

00:22:55.276 --> 00:22:58.400
I guess my politics,
you just hated these people.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.661
And nobody hated them,
had reason more to hate

00:23:00.661 --> 00:23:03.326
them--and this may be unfair but
it's not unfair--than

00:23:03.326 --> 00:23:05.936
minorities,
because those are the ones that

00:23:05.936 --> 00:23:08.991
these white, many of them
Corsican but it's not just

00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:11.858
Corsicans,
but white people from the south

00:23:11.858 --> 00:23:15.698
who were moved into northern
posts and they didn't want to

00:23:15.698 --> 00:23:18.014
see North Africans,
or West Africans,

00:23:18.014 --> 00:23:20.096
or folks like that around.
But, anyway,

00:23:20.096 --> 00:23:22.808
they move in,
they evacuate the Sorbonne and

00:23:22.808 --> 00:23:26.388
things spin out of control.
And May 10th to May 11th is the

00:23:26.388 --> 00:23:29.794
night of the barricades.
And the barricades go up in

00:23:29.794 --> 00:23:33.808
streets that had not had
Haussmann's boulevards plowed

00:23:33.808 --> 00:23:36.338
through them.
It was harder-- they do make

00:23:36.338 --> 00:23:38.835
some attempts and they do,
I guess if I remember right

00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:41.520
across the--see that was the
only year I wasn't there;

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.155
that's sort of odd isn't it?
But I first started going to

00:23:44.155 --> 00:23:46.867
France when I was a kid in 1967,
and I've been there at least

00:23:46.867 --> 00:23:49.579
every four months since then,
and I wasn't there in 1968.

00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:54.703
But there were barricades built
between Rue Saint-Jacques and

00:23:54.703 --> 00:23:58.831
the Boulevard Saint-Michel,
in that sort of now touristy,

00:23:58.831 --> 00:24:02.019
overrun with McDonald's quarter
there, tourist quarter;

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:05.555
and all around Rue Monsieur le
Prince and all around the

00:24:05.555 --> 00:24:08.500
Odéon.
And the barricades were built,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.529
unfortunately many of them with
trees that were ripped down on

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:15.750
the Boulevard Saint-Michel,
and they did a lot of damage

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.390
there and they ripped up
cobblestones,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.650
where streets still had
cobblestones and they...

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.225
Deux-Chevaux were these little,
very unsafe,

00:24:23.225 --> 00:24:27.488
flimsy cars that you could-- I,
with this friend of mined,

00:24:27.488 --> 00:24:30.117
picked up the front of a
Deux-Chevaux to move,

00:24:30.117 --> 00:24:31.620
to park;
you could just sort of

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.890
literally--this guy and I--you
could pick it up and kind of

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.470
move the front along.
And these things were easily

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.894
transformed into barricades.
And this was the night of the

00:24:39.894 --> 00:24:42.510
barricades and there was a lot
of violence.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.858
These were real barricades.
And this was rather one-sided

00:24:46.858 --> 00:24:51.529
violence, but still.
So, there are 367 wounded;

00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:54.100
several killed,
we still don't know how many;

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:59.279
and about 460 arrests.
Before that even,

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:04.711
on May 6th during the fighting,
there were 1,422 arrests,

00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:08.844
et cetera, et cetera.
And the middle-class was

00:25:08.844 --> 00:25:13.281
shocked by the brutality of the
fighting, but they were more

00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:18.094
shocked by the fact that you had
workers and students who had not

00:25:18.094 --> 00:25:22.829
yet really coalesced,
that were defying the State.

00:25:22.829 --> 00:25:28.321
And one of the obvious,
C-R-S S-S, CRS SS,

00:25:28.321 --> 00:25:33.410
as the SS, as in Hitler's
organization,

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:40.900
and this is what was chanted.
And it was all the way up to

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.383
the Jardin de Luxembourg,
from which they could get

00:25:46.383 --> 00:25:50.660
materials also for these
barricades.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:56.066
How did the government react?
The prime minister was Georges

00:25:56.066 --> 00:26:01.425
Pompidou, a pure kind of
Gaullist whose only resistance

00:26:01.425 --> 00:26:04.639
in World War Two,
incidentally--this is a bit

00:26:04.639 --> 00:26:07.189
mean to say--but he once refused
to sit next to a Gestapo

00:26:07.189 --> 00:26:08.558
officer,
in the opera,

00:26:08.558 --> 00:26:12.432
in a loge at the opera.
But Pompidou had been in

00:26:12.432 --> 00:26:16.487
Afghanistan and he came back on
May 11th and orders the

00:26:16.487 --> 00:26:20.924
university reopening,
without the police,

00:26:20.924 --> 00:26:26.888
and then he went off to
Rumania, as planned,

00:26:26.888 --> 00:26:35.069
and then he came back and found
that strikes had spread.

00:26:35.069 --> 00:26:40.658
Now, the strikes themselves
were both a separate but related

00:26:40.658 --> 00:26:43.186
movement.
And the strikes came in the

00:26:43.186 --> 00:26:45.608
large industries,
and there were no plants in

00:26:45.608 --> 00:26:50.243
Boulogne-Billancourt.
These same kinds of occupations

00:26:50.243 --> 00:26:55.481
that had happened in 1936,
in a way rather festive

00:26:55.481 --> 00:26:59.650
occupations--as Lenin had once
said,

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.968
with considerable reason,
about the Commune,

00:27:01.968 --> 00:27:05.258
he called it a "festival of the
oppressed"--and there was good

00:27:05.258 --> 00:27:08.029
humor in these occupations,
again the same kind of

00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:09.779
guerrilla theater and all of
this;

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:14.147
great attention not to destroy
the machinery that the workers,

00:27:14.147 --> 00:27:17.369
when this all had settled,
would come back.

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:24.480
But on May 14th^( )there an
aircraft plant near Nantes was

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.968
occupied and then the sit-down
strike spread,

00:27:29.968 --> 00:27:34.420
as in 1936.
On May 16th workers occupied

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.029
the giant Renault Billancourt,
Renault plant there,

00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:42.440
and then it spread to other
areas.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.690
It was the largest mobilization
of workers in French history,

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.539
without any question,
even more than 1936.

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:54.962
And rather like 1936 it left
the Communist Party confused and

00:27:54.962 --> 00:27:58.499
uncertain, because once again it
seemed to be that the tail was

00:27:58.499 --> 00:28:01.172
wagging the dog.
Workers are striking on their

00:28:01.172 --> 00:28:04.238
own, and they had slogans that
weren't really big communist

00:28:04.238 --> 00:28:05.220
slogans.
One was

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.650
"autogestión,"
that is workers self-management,

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.279
that workers would run their
own factories.

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:14.531
Now, in the Soviet Union,
after the Russian Revolution,

00:28:14.531 --> 00:28:17.240
the Bolshevik,
the Communist Party had crushed

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.190
like grapes workers who
attempted to run their own

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.019
factories and who wanted to have
strikes;

00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:27.014
and working the power of the
proletariat in the Soviet Union,

00:28:27.014 --> 00:28:30.210
to an extent of Lenin but above
all of Stalin,

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.609
became the dictatorship of the
Communist Party.

00:28:32.609 --> 00:28:36.860
Workers self-management simply
didn't exist,

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:43.049
it was run by the party.
In theory it existed.

00:28:43.049 --> 00:28:45.436
The Communist Party was
supposed to represent the

00:28:45.436 --> 00:28:48.369
Russian, the Soviet working
class, but in fact the Communist

00:28:48.369 --> 00:28:51.315
Party had existence of its own.
And, so, suddenly they're

00:28:51.315 --> 00:28:53.341
confused because here's the
workers saying,

00:28:53.341 --> 00:28:55.849
"we want to run--we want to go
out on strike now.

00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:56.995
And they said,
"well, wait,

00:28:56.995 --> 00:28:59.419
wait"--it was the same thing as
1936--"everything is not

00:28:59.419 --> 00:29:01.269
possible, everything is not
possible."

00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:04.684
But for workers occupying their
plants it seemed to be--this

00:29:04.684 --> 00:29:06.710
seemed to be the moment to do
it;

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.069
and there was a strong link
between big strike movements and

00:29:10.069 --> 00:29:12.119
political opportunity,
as in 1936.

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:15.645
So, it's a very,
very good comparison to

00:29:15.645 --> 00:29:19.079
make--trent-six,
'36 and '68.

00:29:19.079 --> 00:29:21.864
And the workers wanted
participation in industrial

00:29:21.864 --> 00:29:24.364
decision-making,
they wanted control over the

00:29:24.364 --> 00:29:26.464
pace of work.
Again they were against

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:29.374
Taylorism, that they're being
measured, their performance is

00:29:29.374 --> 00:29:32.630
being measured by the number of
units of whatever--car handles,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.140
whatever they're making,
that they do.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.732
They want to have the right,
which they eventually won,

00:29:38.732 --> 00:29:42.790
to have a union office in the
factory and to collect fees from

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.049
workers for the union and
make--get collects,

00:29:46.049 --> 00:29:51.400
to pass the hat on behalf of
the union and on behalf of

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:59.150
workers in the union,
during work.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.913
And, so, the political goals
can't really be separated from

00:30:02.913 --> 00:30:06.157
the worker's movement,
it was all part of this huge

00:30:06.157 --> 00:30:08.864
mobilization.
And workers and students had

00:30:08.864 --> 00:30:12.187
really had a lot more in common
than they did in the United

00:30:12.187 --> 00:30:14.397
States,
because people of my generation

00:30:14.397 --> 00:30:17.356
can remember students at the
University of Michigan going

00:30:17.356 --> 00:30:19.470
down to the Ford plants in
Ypsilanti,

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.220
and in other places,
and up in Flint.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.933
And the workers there they
didn't want to hear anything

00:30:25.933 --> 00:30:29.784
about these privileged white
students opposing the war in

00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:32.144
Vietnam,
they wanted to have a boat and

00:30:32.144 --> 00:30:34.140
go out on Lake Michigan or Lake
Huron.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.947
And they were,
"if the United States

00:30:35.947 --> 00:30:38.994
government is fighting a war in
Vietnam then it must be--the

00:30:38.994 --> 00:30:41.680
United States government knows
what it's doing";

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.609
and they didn't want any part
of it.

00:30:43.609 --> 00:30:49.568
And, so, it was a total--talk
about a failure to comprehend,

00:30:49.568 --> 00:30:53.173
it just didn't work,
and to an extent--this is

00:30:53.173 --> 00:30:56.436
probably not a fair comparison--
but it would rather be like

00:30:56.436 --> 00:30:59.413
militants at Columbia,
and Yale, and Harvard,

00:30:59.413 --> 00:31:01.949
and Michigan,
and Madison activists,

00:31:01.949 --> 00:31:05.681
some white and some black,
going down to Alabama and

00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:09.140
Mississippi and trying to talk
to people down there,

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.009
because it just, it didn't work.
But in France because the state

00:31:13.009 --> 00:31:16.159
structure seemed to be,
in a very centralized

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:18.951
structure,
not a federalized structure,

00:31:18.951 --> 00:31:22.740
so you could find common cause,
because you're the factory

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.200
worker who is occupying a
factory.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.597
His enemy is the CRS,
and the students who are afraid

00:31:29.597 --> 00:31:34.672
they're going to get gunned down
by the CRS, they have things

00:31:34.672 --> 00:31:38.663
that they had in common.
And they're both fighting

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:42.170
against the brutalization,
as they would have put it,

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.035
of human relations,
is that capitalism seemed to be

00:31:45.035 --> 00:31:48.474
simply perpetuating this favored
society in which the rich do

00:31:48.474 --> 00:31:50.192
very,
very well, thank you very much,

00:31:50.192 --> 00:31:52.015
and the grandes
écoles are full of

00:31:52.015 --> 00:31:53.490
only people who are well
connected;

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.669
basically that was always the
case, the big,

00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:58.248
fancy schools.
And the brutalization of human

00:31:58.248 --> 00:32:01.253
relations on the shop floor,
with the bosses sort of

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:05.491
dictating the rhythm of work.
So, it seemed to be--there

00:32:05.491 --> 00:32:10.916
seemed to be this sort of moment
where some progress could be

00:32:10.916 --> 00:32:14.027
made;
and in a sense you're powerless

00:32:14.027 --> 00:32:16.746
within the system.
In the French educational

00:32:16.746 --> 00:32:18.906
system you were,
and to an extent still are,

00:32:18.906 --> 00:32:21.307
powerless.
And in the factory you were

00:32:21.307 --> 00:32:23.960
powerless.
And you're probably arguably

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.256
more powerless now because the
role of the unions has declined,

00:32:28.256 --> 00:32:30.890
in France, as in the United
States.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.703
And in the end the government
had to pass laws giving legal

00:32:35.703 --> 00:32:39.054
status within each factory,
to the union,

00:32:39.054 --> 00:32:43.269
that they could collect funds,
as I said--I guess I already

00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:46.539
said that--and could have an
office there.

00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:51.609
But the education reforms
basically scratch the surface.

00:32:51.609 --> 00:33:00.809
They're beginning--creating new
universities all over the place.

00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:03.551
Now there's only a couple of
départements in

00:33:03.551 --> 00:33:06.390
France that don't have at least
branches of universities.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.986
The most recently created were
La Rochelle, which is going very

00:33:09.986 --> 00:33:12.480
nicely, and the Pays-de-Calais,
in Arras.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.773
But even these lead to problems
because, for example,

00:33:15.773 --> 00:33:18.750
when they create a university
in La Rochelle,

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.444
then you are hurting an old
established university,

00:33:22.444 --> 00:33:26.359
Poitiers, which becomes this
sort of instant rival,

00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:28.543
La Rochelle does,
for students from the area

00:33:28.543 --> 00:33:31.565
around La Rochelle.
And the Pas-de-Calais,

00:33:31.565 --> 00:33:35.299
that is up in Arras,
what does that hurt?

00:33:35.299 --> 00:33:39.069
Well that is resisted by Lille,
obviously;

00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:40.750
in Lille there are three
universities in Lille;

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.502
Lille is a big student center.
So, even in places that are

00:33:44.502 --> 00:33:47.946
major university towns.
And Toulouse is a good example,

00:33:47.946 --> 00:33:50.959
they create more universities,
they can expand the University

00:33:50.959 --> 00:33:53.470
of Toulouse, more branches and
stuff like that.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.474
But does this solve the problem?
It really doesn't because

00:33:57.474 --> 00:34:00.823
French universities remain
woefully under-funded,

00:34:00.823 --> 00:34:05.150
and that's why this issue of
this law that's been proposed,

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.085
or it'd be passed,
I guess, the loi,

00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:11.090
the Pécresse Law,
p-e-c-r-e-s-s-e,

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.221
which is to make these budgets
autonomous of universities,

00:34:15.221 --> 00:34:18.990
represents a kind of an
Americanization of the French

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:23.630
system where--that the favored
will do even better--Paris I,

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.380
Paris IV, which are very
different.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.521
Paris I is associated more,
a leftwing university,

00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:32.255
more progressive;
Paris IV, quatre,

00:34:32.255 --> 00:34:37.413
is a more rightwing university.
Lyon II, places like Lyon II,

00:34:37.413 --> 00:34:40.771
as opposed to Lyon I and Lyon
III, is going to do very,

00:34:40.771 --> 00:34:42.737
very well;
Toulouse is going to do very

00:34:42.737 --> 00:34:45.574
well under this system.
Montpellier will do very well,

00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:48.650
maybe they'll be able to raise
money from alumni.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.855
There's not even--it doesn't
even exist, an alumni

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:53.240
association for these places,
they don't even exit.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.219
It's just totally different.
Even a public university in the

00:34:58.219 --> 00:35:00.476
United States,
like Michigan,

00:35:00.476 --> 00:35:03.014
even in hard times,
just does so very,

00:35:03.014 --> 00:35:05.096
very well because the
University of Michigan is so

00:35:05.096 --> 00:35:07.602
identified with--I'm a little
proud but--identified with the

00:35:07.602 --> 00:35:10.909
State of Michigan;
or Wisconsin or Berkley;

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:13.841
Berkley might have hard times
but the California system,

00:35:13.841 --> 00:35:16.079
it's so part of the State of
California.

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:19.320
But it doesn't do much good to
argue that the Besançon

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.559
University is associated with
the Department of the Doubs,

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:24.306
which is the Département
of Besançon,

00:35:24.306 --> 00:35:26.436
because unless the state gives
them money there ain't going to

00:35:26.436 --> 00:35:29.931
be any money coming in.
And, so, you have more and more

00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:33.484
people.
Has anybody here been to a

00:35:33.484 --> 00:35:37.670
French university?
Yes, where were you?

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.880
Barkley, you were in Paris,
weren't you?

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.701
Student: In Paris
[inaudible]

00:35:39.701 --> 00:35:40.710
Professor John Merriman:
At Paris IV,

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.790
and you went to the lectures
and all that.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.204
Student: Yes.
Professor John Merriman:

00:35:43.204 --> 00:35:43.890
Were there enormous numbers of
people?

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:50.520
Student: Lectures, so-so.
I guess 100 to 200.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.247
But then we had TD as well.
Professor John Merriman:

00:35:52.247 --> 00:35:53.227
Travaux
dirigés are sections

00:35:53.227 --> 00:35:55.551
and things like that.
But the way that these are done

00:35:55.551 --> 00:35:58.659
is you have these huge lectures.
You know what?

00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:00.762
I taught in--I should get back
to de Gaulle,

00:36:00.762 --> 00:36:03.646
but in a minute--but when I
taught at Lyon II I was supposed

00:36:03.646 --> 00:36:06.396
to--I didn't pick my courses;
here, I'm lucky enough at Yale

00:36:06.396 --> 00:36:08.564
to be able to pick my courses.
They said, "well,

00:36:08.564 --> 00:36:11.840
you can do history of urban
France," because I've written

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.882
books on urban France,
"and then you can do the 1920s

00:36:14.882 --> 00:36:16.214
and '30s."
And I thought,

00:36:16.214 --> 00:36:17.349
"oh man, I don't want to do
that."

00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:20.064
"And then you can do"--because
we live part-time in North

00:36:20.064 --> 00:36:22.440
America--"you can do history of
North America."

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.519
And I don't know anything about
that.

00:36:24.519 --> 00:36:26.815
And, so, I'm calling my
friends, like David Davis and

00:36:26.815 --> 00:36:29.508
I'm calling my editors at OUP
and Norton saying please send me

00:36:29.508 --> 00:36:31.230
all your books on American
history.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.289
And, so, I'm sitting around,
the night before--I did

00:36:34.289 --> 00:36:37.224
ridiculous lectures on Quebec.
I don't know anything about

00:36:37.224 --> 00:36:38.417
that.
I must have repeated three

00:36:38.417 --> 00:36:40.539
times about Louis XIV sending a
boatload of prostitutes,

00:36:40.539 --> 00:36:42.617
because that's about all that I
could remember,

00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:44.650
when I got up there in front of
250 people,

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.216
speaking about the history of
North America--I don't know a

00:36:47.216 --> 00:36:49.420
damn thing about it;
I know a little bit about it

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.900
but not to teach it effectively.
But that's just it.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.227
And then also because of the
politics, the person--the dean

00:36:55.227 --> 00:36:58.555
was at war with my friends
there, so they gave me the worst

00:36:58.555 --> 00:37:01.257
conceivable schedule.
I had to go all the way up on

00:37:01.257 --> 00:37:03.749
Friday for an afternoon class
and my other classes were on

00:37:03.749 --> 00:37:05.409
Monday and Wednesday,
and all this.

00:37:05.409 --> 00:37:06.980
But you're teaching these
people.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.282
And there were three courses on
the 1920s and '30s,

00:37:09.282 --> 00:37:11.631
three lecture courses,
and we would get together and

00:37:11.631 --> 00:37:14.344
say, "What are you going to do?"
And we were smart enough to

00:37:14.344 --> 00:37:16.609
say, "Well I'll tell you what,
you do the economy stuff and

00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:19.038
I'll do the political stuff,
and we'll kind of help each

00:37:19.038 --> 00:37:21.232
other out."
And you put down a reading list

00:37:21.232 --> 00:37:23.949
of books that you might hope
that they would read,

00:37:23.949 --> 00:37:25.718
and maybe ten,
eight books maybe,

00:37:25.718 --> 00:37:28.260
or something like that,
a reasonable amount.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.627
But there are bookstores but
there are no such thing as

00:37:31.627 --> 00:37:34.449
course readings.
And what they used to do at the

00:37:34.449 --> 00:37:36.916
Sorbonne is they
would--professors would print

00:37:36.916 --> 00:37:39.110
out their lectures and you could
buy,

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:42.469
at one of these bookstores,
their lectures.

00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:43.617
So, they used to say,
"well, the hell with it,

00:37:43.617 --> 00:37:45.045
I'm not going to go to the
lecture if they're going to do

00:37:45.045 --> 00:37:46.672
that."
But we took it more seriously

00:37:46.672 --> 00:37:49.291
and so we put out these books.
And now--because students,

00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:51.860
French students don't have any
money, they have no money,

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.461
I mean no money,
most of them--unless they're at

00:37:54.461 --> 00:37:56.510
fancy grandes
écoles,

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.764
that their checkbooks are like
Kleenex boxes--that they have no

00:37:59.764 --> 00:38:02.389
money and so they can't afford
to buy the books.

00:38:02.389 --> 00:38:07.892
Now, in our three classes on
the 1920s and '30s there were

00:38:07.892 --> 00:38:11.088
400 students.
And you know how many copies of

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.950
the books there were,
available?

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:18.408
One, in the library.
And there was another one in

00:38:18.408 --> 00:38:21.776
the municipal library in Lyon.
So, how are you going to read

00:38:21.776 --> 00:38:24.132
the books?
You're not going to read the

00:38:24.132 --> 00:38:26.204
books.
How are you going to do on the

00:38:26.204 --> 00:38:27.307
test?
Not very well,

00:38:27.307 --> 00:38:30.308
because you hadn't read the
books, and the whole course

00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:33.389
can't be built on lecture.
But it's good,

00:38:33.389 --> 00:38:38.324
but I mean it's bad,
because you had--Lyon II is

00:38:38.324 --> 00:38:40.960
very good.
So, I had students who were

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.596
comparable to you nice people.
But then some of them were just

00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:45.228
totally clueless,
and they used to do things

00:38:45.228 --> 00:38:47.429
like--there was one who would
bring--a couple of them would

00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:49.630
bring these little stars that
you have that you used to put

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.300
on--you have in Catholic first
grade,

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.958
little stars you'd put on the
big points you want to have,

00:38:53.958 --> 00:38:55.730
and they'd bring these little
stars,

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:58.269
and they thought they were
still in high school,

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:00.593
and they'd say,
"can I borrow the glue of my

00:39:00.593 --> 00:39:02.965
neighbor?"
or "can I borrow the eraser of

00:39:02.965 --> 00:39:04.868
my neighbor?"
And then everything in France

00:39:04.868 --> 00:39:06.215
has to be three,
so you'd have one,

00:39:06.215 --> 00:39:07.880
you'd give them a question and
say one,

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.465
two three, and some of them
would have three points,

00:39:09.465 --> 00:39:10.739
and none of them made any sense
at all,

00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:12.300
but there were always three
points.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.067
But then some were just
brilliant and some were

00:39:14.067 --> 00:39:15.562
terrible.
But the thing that was so sad

00:39:15.562 --> 00:39:17.670
about this whole system,
and this is what really got me,

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.789
is that I had to do the
travaux dirigés,

00:39:19.789 --> 00:39:22.095
also, of one of the courses.
And so somebody wouldn't be

00:39:22.095 --> 00:39:24.059
there and you'd say
"Madame"--you couldn't

00:39:24.059 --> 00:39:26.574
tutoie them,
though I finally ended up doing

00:39:26.574 --> 00:39:29.542
it, the hell with it--and you'd
say, "whatever happened to

00:39:29.542 --> 00:39:33.140
Mademoiselle X,
here's Mademoiselle X?"

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:36.450
"Je ne sais pas."
"Well, she's not here anymore."

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.829
"No, I guess not."
And you never know.

00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:41.669
There would be a nurse
available for twenty minutes a

00:39:41.669 --> 00:39:44.673
week, and so if somebody was
having serious problems you

00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:47.275
would never know;
no one ever followed it up and

00:39:47.275 --> 00:39:50.039
they just would disappear into
the night, and there was no

00:39:50.039 --> 00:39:52.711
structure.
Here, if you get the sniffles

00:39:52.711 --> 00:39:56.090
we know about it and you're
taken very care of.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.539
And even at places that aren't
fancy like this that's the way

00:39:59.539 --> 00:40:01.304
it is.
And so the system has never

00:40:01.304 --> 00:40:03.165
been reformed.
Even for the simple task--oh

00:40:03.165 --> 00:40:05.070
here, I go, boy,
this I'm getting--what happened

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.530
to my lecture?--the hell with
it.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:10.525
But waiting in line to Xerox
something, have you ever waited

00:40:10.525 --> 00:40:14.959
in line behind ten geographers,
all Xeroxing the fourteen

00:40:14.959 --> 00:40:18.830
biggest volcanoes in the
Puy-de-Dôme?

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:22.713
It's just mind-boggling.
And then you're looking at your

00:40:22.713 --> 00:40:25.145
bell, and then you sort of
struggle through this cigarette

00:40:25.145 --> 00:40:27.546
smoke.
Hopefully you'll see your

00:40:27.546 --> 00:40:31.256
amphitheater B will be somewhere
through there,

00:40:31.256 --> 00:40:35.369
and you sort of stagger along
through the smoke.

00:40:35.369 --> 00:40:37.490
And then people talk too,
the other thing,

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.869
people talk,
and they used to drive me nuts.

00:40:39.869 --> 00:40:41.836
And they all-and they
drague too,

00:40:41.836 --> 00:40:43.904
they're all,
these guys are always hitting

00:40:43.904 --> 00:40:46.223
on these women,
and in your class this stuff is

00:40:46.223 --> 00:40:48.268
going on.
And I once got so mad,

00:40:48.268 --> 00:40:51.547
I got to kind of control
myself, this was in amphitheater

00:40:51.547 --> 00:40:53.442
B,
as it's called so poetically,

00:40:53.442 --> 00:40:56.315
I was talking about some damn
thing about nouvelle

00:40:56.315 --> 00:40:59.300
France--I didn't know what I
was talking about,

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.908
zero, zero.
And I was going on anyway,

00:41:02.908 --> 00:41:06.161
that doesn't stop me,
and I walked up the stairs and

00:41:06.161 --> 00:41:09.349
these people are talking,
they're just talking.

00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:10.996
And I stood right in front of
them, and then they said,

00:41:10.996 --> 00:41:12.771
"oh, excusez-moi."
And then I left and went back

00:41:12.771 --> 00:41:13.920
down and they start talking
again.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.599
Or sometimes they'd be talking
and you say, "Est-ce que vous

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.457
voulez la parole,
vous?" "Do you want to

00:41:18.457 --> 00:41:19.399
talk?"
And they say,

00:41:19.399 --> 00:41:21.710
"oh no, no, excuse me," and
then they go back to their email

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:24.060
or they go back to hitting on
their neighbor or whatever.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.621
It was just mind-blowing.
But the very good students--but

00:41:27.621 --> 00:41:31.352
the way that you teach--and
Da-ihn knows all about this

00:41:31.352 --> 00:41:33.781
system too,
you should ask her,

00:41:33.781 --> 00:41:37.860
but she was in very good
schools and all that there.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.119
But it just is,
it's an incredible thing.

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:43.800
So, it didn't really change
very much after de Gaulle.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.201
So, what happened to old
Charles de Gaulle,

00:41:46.201 --> 00:41:48.260
back to 1968,
what happens to him?

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.286
Well he takes a mysterious trip.
He first, he goes to

00:41:51.286 --> 00:41:53.853
Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises,
probably to finish those

00:41:53.853 --> 00:41:56.663
feuilles tendres,
those serials on TV,

00:41:56.663 --> 00:42:00.220
that he was watching,
and then he disappears and he

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.523
goes to Baden-Baden in Germany.
Why did he go to Baden-Baden in

00:42:04.523 --> 00:42:06.809
Germany?
Well, nobody really knows.

00:42:06.809 --> 00:42:10.540
Probably the best explanation
is he wanted to make sure that

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.070
he had the support of the French
Army.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.409
Why is the French Army in
Baden-Baden?

00:42:15.409 --> 00:42:18.987
Well, the French Army is in
Baden-Baden because that's part

00:42:18.987 --> 00:42:22.256
of French territory in the
après guerre,

00:42:22.256 --> 00:42:26.313
and they're still occupying.
And, so, he announces that

00:42:26.313 --> 00:42:29.118
they're going to have
participation,

00:42:29.118 --> 00:42:33.365
and this necessity of
participation in overcoming this

00:42:33.365 --> 00:42:37.270
crisis--that's the word he uses,
participation.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.594
He comes back.
And so in the meantime there's

00:42:39.594 --> 00:42:41.972
this huge march down the
Champs-Elysées to support

00:42:41.972 --> 00:42:44.322
him.
The upper classes are clear

00:42:44.322 --> 00:42:47.666
that they will support the
Gaullist response,

00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:50.505
no matter what it is;
that if it's the Army just

00:42:50.505 --> 00:42:52.613
shooting down students,
which they aren't ever going to

00:42:52.613 --> 00:42:54.839
do, but the brutality of the
repression, they will support

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:57.867
that.
They were quite happy to see

00:42:57.867 --> 00:43:02.672
people like Cohn-Bendit and the
others who committed

00:43:02.672 --> 00:43:08.230
professional suicide go,
and basically things calm down.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:11.586
But the point is that the
reforms were never

00:43:11.586 --> 00:43:15.645
really--meaningful reforms,
I think it's safe to say,

00:43:15.645 --> 00:43:19.860
really don't come to the French
university system.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.751
Now the French university
system is more open to people

00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:28.291
who are not just following their
parents along in the university

00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:31.978
structure.
There are more workers' sons

00:43:31.978 --> 00:43:37.528
and daughters-- and daughters,
above all now--daughters and

00:43:37.528 --> 00:43:43.161
sons of very ordinary people.
We know a good number of people

00:43:43.161 --> 00:43:48.056
your age or a little older who
are at university now who are

00:43:48.056 --> 00:43:53.033
the first people in the whole
history of their families to go

00:43:53.033 --> 00:43:56.200
to university;
and happily still at Yale and

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.711
other places one can give thanks
to various changes that Yale and

00:43:59.711 --> 00:44:02.179
these other places,
one can find that now.

00:44:02.179 --> 00:44:06.613
This has changed,
but the problem is that as long

00:44:06.613 --> 00:44:12.340
as the economy is not able to
absorb all these young people,

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.960
when they get done,
there is no sense that they're

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.989
going to be able to go anywhere
anyway,

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.650
particularly if they want to
stay in the region where we

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.360
live, in which there's not a lot
of economic activity.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.521
Thus we have one friend who got
her Master's at Grenoble,

00:44:28.521 --> 00:44:33.128
and the only job that she could
find for the next two years was

00:44:33.128 --> 00:44:35.858
working at McDonald's,
in Grenoble,

00:44:35.858 --> 00:44:38.918
or near Grenoble,
and now she's working for her

00:44:38.918 --> 00:44:41.654
parents.
So, to make universities more

00:44:41.654 --> 00:44:45.593
open to all kinds of people does
not necessarily solve the

00:44:45.593 --> 00:44:49.809
problem of what's going to
happen to them in the long run.

00:44:49.809 --> 00:44:52.689
Now, one of the things that has
done that is of course the

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:56.504
bac itself.
And you know that in France you

00:44:56.504 --> 00:45:01.480
take the baccalaureate exam,
you take what they call the

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.862
bac blanc,
after the equivalent of your

00:45:04.862 --> 00:45:07.783
junior year in high school,
which includes the French

00:45:07.783 --> 00:45:10.145
bac,
and then you take the real

00:45:10.145 --> 00:45:13.031
bac at the end.
Now, back--I can't tell you

00:45:13.031 --> 00:45:16.236
what the percentage of the
people who passed the bac

00:45:16.236 --> 00:45:20.352
in 1968 is, I don't know that.
It's probably--was probably

00:45:20.352 --> 00:45:25.491
about half, or maybe even less.
Of course it's steamed upwards

00:45:25.491 --> 00:45:30.012
over the last fifteen years,
and it now approaches eighty

00:45:30.012 --> 00:45:32.526
percent.
That is still big pressure,

00:45:32.526 --> 00:45:35.840
because it's your one exam and
it's you bet your life,

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.868
because you can't go to
university if you don't pass the

00:45:38.868 --> 00:45:41.699
bac, and there's big,
big pressure.

00:45:41.699 --> 00:45:45.485
And if you get pretty close,
by a couple of points,

00:45:45.485 --> 00:45:48.953
then you can do it again,
that there's a possibility of

00:45:48.953 --> 00:45:51.310
doing it again within the next
couple of weeks,

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.028
if you're very, very close.
We had a friend whose mother

00:45:54.028 --> 00:45:57.200
died and she was obviously very
upset, and she just barely

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.760
missed it, and so they let her
do it again.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.061
So, this puts a lot of pressure.
But also, as I've said before,

00:46:03.061 --> 00:46:06.235
because of streaming there are
lots of people--kids who are

00:46:06.235 --> 00:46:09.355
taken out of the line toward
university and toward passing

00:46:09.355 --> 00:46:11.304
the bac,
quite early on,

00:46:11.304 --> 00:46:14.436
because their teachers will
convoke the parents and say,

00:46:14.436 --> 00:46:17.909
"your daughter and son has no
business being in a school."

00:46:17.909 --> 00:46:20.579
Just like that,
cruelty of it all.

00:46:20.579 --> 00:46:23.489
And then they go off into a
different line.

00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:25.858
And there are no--and I've said
this before but there are no

00:46:25.858 --> 00:46:27.063
second chances,
in this system,

00:46:27.063 --> 00:46:28.789
which can be a very,
very cruel system.

00:46:28.789 --> 00:46:30.690
And not everybody passes the
bac.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:37.096
My son has a buddy who managed
to get a 1 on the bac,

00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:43.466
which is very difficult,
because it's graded from 0 to

00:46:43.466 --> 00:46:50.559
20, and he managed to get a 0,25
in one thing earlier on,

00:46:50.559 --> 00:46:53.110
in his brevet,
which is an earlier exam.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.570
And so university life isn't
cut out for everybody.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:59.162
But I couldn't in all honesty,
as much as I love teaching in

00:46:59.162 --> 00:47:01.898
France, and I do,
and it's not just because of

00:47:01.898 --> 00:47:04.659
the--I love the ambiance in
French universities,

00:47:04.659 --> 00:47:06.926
I really do,
and I feel useful,

00:47:06.926 --> 00:47:11.232
and it just--it's a lot of fun
but it's not--and we've had

00:47:11.232 --> 00:47:14.494
chances to be there forever,
teaching there,

00:47:14.494 --> 00:47:16.915
but it's just the conditions,
they're tough,

00:47:16.915 --> 00:47:20.712
they're challenging conditions.
And basically it wasn't enough

00:47:20.712 --> 00:47:24.163
for de Gaulle to say "we want
more participation" and to

00:47:24.163 --> 00:47:28.047
announce an election,
a referendum on regional

00:47:28.047 --> 00:47:31.469
decentralization;
and that's how he walks off the

00:47:31.469 --> 00:47:33.768
stage.
In 1969 he just goes back

00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:37.007
to--stomps of to
Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises,

00:47:37.007 --> 00:47:40.941
because it's a referendum on
his leadership and that

00:47:40.941 --> 00:47:45.107
participation isn't enough,
that his--this big gap between

00:47:45.107 --> 00:47:48.164
talking a good game about
grandeur and all that are not

00:47:48.164 --> 00:47:51.390
following through with any kind
of meaningful reforms,

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:55.518
help generate this crisis.
And one cannot--it's pointless,

00:47:55.518 --> 00:47:59.118
it's silly to look back and say
this was the revolution

00:47:59.118 --> 00:48:02.530
manquée,
this was the missed revolution.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.159
It's like in 1936 Léon
Blum had said,

00:48:05.159 --> 00:48:07.971
"workers of the world take over
your factories,

00:48:07.971 --> 00:48:11.156
all of them;
peasants occupy the fields that

00:48:11.156 --> 00:48:13.292
you work."
But ultimately this wasn't

00:48:13.292 --> 00:48:15.374
going to happen,
and who knows if nothing

00:48:15.374 --> 00:48:18.079
probably good would have come
out of that anyway.

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:22.221
But 1968 was not a revolution
that was going to be a

00:48:22.221 --> 00:48:26.173
meaningful revolution.
In the end that generation was

00:48:26.173 --> 00:48:29.179
right, I would like to say,
in opposing U.S.

00:48:29.179 --> 00:48:33.762
policies, in trying to create
or insist on a more human world,

00:48:33.762 --> 00:48:36.992
humane world,
in industrial relations and in

00:48:36.992 --> 00:48:40.779
the university.
Professors and administrators

00:48:40.779 --> 00:48:43.789
learned something after all of
that.

00:48:43.789 --> 00:48:46.537
But in a very centralized state
where more and more people,

00:48:46.537 --> 00:48:48.289
because they passed the
bac,

00:48:48.289 --> 00:48:52.725
have access to universities,
that isn't necessarily going to

00:48:52.725 --> 00:48:56.912
resolve the problem,
which fundamentally comes down

00:48:56.912 --> 00:49:01.724
to the fact that there are not
enough--that there's a real

00:49:01.724 --> 00:49:05.298
crisis of young people,
for young people now,

00:49:05.298 --> 00:49:08.579
in France, but no light at the
end of the tunnel.

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:12.620
And as I'll argue on Wednesday,
that's part of what's going on

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:16.180
in the French suburbs as well.
So, if you go to Paris and you

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.813
walk up the Boulevard
Saint-Michel,

00:49:17.813 --> 00:49:20.551
which is my least favorite
boulevard in Paris because it's

00:49:20.551 --> 00:49:23.385
been destroyed by bad zoning and
has McDonald's all over the

00:49:23.385 --> 00:49:26.094
place,
and just tourist hoards,

00:49:26.094 --> 00:49:30.610
that if you go up there,
think about these battles,

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:35.482
pitched battles were fought in
1968 in that merry month of May

00:49:35.482 --> 00:49:38.944
and of barricades.
And part of--revolution is part

00:49:38.944 --> 00:49:41.650
of French culture,
the memory of revolution.

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:44.464
But this revolution
really--days of running down to

00:49:44.464 --> 00:49:47.673
the prefecture and declaring a
new regime were pretty much

00:49:47.673 --> 00:49:50.443
over,
and this revolution,

00:49:50.443 --> 00:49:53.952
well intentioned,
full of color,

00:49:53.952 --> 00:49:58.480
full of integrity,
full of character,

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.537
full of wit--it was a witty
revolution, full of irony and

00:50:02.537 --> 00:50:05.289
appreciation of the human
condition.

00:50:05.289 --> 00:50:09.457
In the end, for better or for
worse, and I think probably for

00:50:09.457 --> 00:50:14.123
worse, it didn't get very far.
And to an extent one can look

00:50:14.123 --> 00:50:17.578
longingly back,
as you can probably tell I

00:50:17.578 --> 00:50:21.000
still do.
See you on Wednesday.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.749
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, today I want to do two

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:04.614
things.
I'm going to talk about the

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:08.063
centralization of the French
State and the question of why

00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:11.634
Paris--and that's kind of fun to
talk about--and the role of

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:15.318
Paris in centralization,
and the particular role of

00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:19.396
Paris in French economic,
political, social and cultural

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:22.037
life.
And, then, in the last twenty

00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:25.850
minutes I'll talk about why this
sort of strange man,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.880
the former "miracle baby," as
he was called after his birth,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.576
the Comte de Chambord,
did not become King of France,

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:39.160
Henri V, and why France ended
up a republic,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.196
and how;
and, that has something to do

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:42.960
with the centralization of the
French State.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.300
Now, anyone who's ever spent
any time in France at all,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.640
who's ever waited in line in a
prefecture in Privas,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.496
or Agens, or Paris,
God forbid, we wait for hours,

00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:57.746
will realize that the role of
Paris and the role of the

00:00:57.746 --> 00:01:02.390
centralization of the French
state is unique in--at least in

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.619
Western European history,
over the long run,

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.335
and it still is.
Despite all of

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.557
the--Mitterrand's plans for
decentralization,

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:15.560
and the creation of regional
councils,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.541
basically France remains the
most centralized state in

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:22.997
Western Europe,
and the role of Paris in French

00:01:22.997 --> 00:01:27.880
life does not have an equivalent
in other European countries.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.058
Now, let me think about that;
let's think out loud about that

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:33.330
other statement.
Think of other countries.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.454
In Spain, obviously Madrid,
Madrid is the capital but

00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:42.045
Barcelona is terribly,
terribly important,

00:01:42.045 --> 00:01:45.787
and was always a much more
economically important city than

00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:48.819
the kind of command economy that
was Madrid.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.501
Or, if you think of Berlin,
you think of Germany,

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:54.686
a unified Germany or in the
Federal Republic before German

00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:58.650
unification,
Berlin was terribly important.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.390
It is now again the capital but
Berlin is balanced off by Munich

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.549
and by Frankfurt in some
important ways.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.082
So, if you take a little
country like Scotland,

00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:11.560
Edinburgh and Glasgow are two
major cities.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.276
Or, if you take England,
for example,

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:18.199
people came to care in very
major ways what people in

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.424
Manchester thought because
Manchester becomes the capital

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:27.629
essentially of the north and the
economic center of production.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.994
Or, if you take Russia,
Moscow was always the religious

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:35.326
core.
Nicholas II just hated Moscow,

00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:40.858
it represented all those values
that he thought were Russian,

00:02:40.858 --> 00:02:42.518
but St.
Petersburg,

00:02:42.518 --> 00:02:48.143
Petrograd--Leningrad became a
major, major city and because of

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:53.030
the residence of the czar that's
where it was.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.847
Or, if you take almost anywhere
else--the Austro-Hungarian

00:02:56.847 --> 00:03:01.322
Empire, before it broke up,
Vienna was now this over-sized

00:03:01.322 --> 00:03:05.120
capital that--in a very,
very small country,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.680
but it was balanced off by
Budapest.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.047
In Italy, obviously,
Milan and Turin were terribly

00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:13.039
important cities,
and Rome,

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:17.023
which is just sort of a sleepy,
ecclesiastical capital full of

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:20.370
tourists and clergy.
But France is unique.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.994
The role of Paris in French
life is unique and that has been

00:03:25.994 --> 00:03:30.660
accentuated over the centuries,
particularly the last century

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.388
and a half, by some of the
things that I want to talk

00:03:33.388 --> 00:03:35.183
about.
In 1947, about,

00:03:35.183 --> 00:03:39.240
there was a book called
Paris and the French

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.180
Desert that looked at this
sort of unusual thing,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.123
that where else but in France
would, then, ninety-seven

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:52.504
percent of the population be
considered provincials in a very

00:03:52.504 --> 00:03:55.834
derogatory,
a very pejorative sense,

00:03:55.834 --> 00:04:01.139
and Paris would be the place
that all of the Rastignacs of

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.518
France would try to go,
because of the economic,

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:10.250
political, social and cultural
domination of the capital.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.939
A Rastignac was--it was before
this course, but was the central

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.221
figure, or one of them,
in Balzac's novel Old

00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:21.583
Goriot, Père
Goriot, and he's a sort of a

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:24.945
somewhat poor noble from the
Charente in the west of France

00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:29.217
who's going to hit the big time,
and wants to sleep with all the

00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:33.060
right ladies and become wealthy
without doing any work,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.514
and he became sort of a symbol
for this aggressive,

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:45.278
provincial, in this case a sort
of poor noble who has to get to

00:04:45.278 --> 00:04:53.098
Paris to make the big time,
because the big time could only

00:04:53.098 --> 00:04:55.827
be there.
Now, I mean in almost any

00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:58.888
domain you can think of--one
exception, this is not the time

00:04:58.888 --> 00:05:02.480
for me to talk about it,
though I would love to do that,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.165
is gastronomy,
because although Lyon is

00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:08.910
considered--Lyon is not the
capital of any region,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.004
it was the second most
important city in France,

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.698
and still is,
even though it's slightly

00:05:12.698 --> 00:05:16.029
smaller now than Marseille,
if you just count the city.

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.300
Lyon became the capital of
French gastronomy and not Paris;

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.889
but, that's almost the
exception.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.067
And, one of the reasons why the
role of the dominance of Paris

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:30.175
is so great is precisely because
of the centralization of the

00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:32.877
French state.
In my memory,

00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:39.972
as a young guy hanging out and
drinking a cheap wine in Paris

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:46.369
when I was doing my thesis,
you could only hear on the news

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:51.240
people with Parisian accents,
giving the news--only.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.612
And then, before the news they
had this little thing they

00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:55.730
called Actualité
Régionale,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.566
where if you lived in Auvergne
there would be--you would have a

00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:03.403
fifteen minute program talking
about local events and you might

00:06:03.403 --> 00:06:06.250
have somebody who had an
Auvergnat accent;

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.542
or, if you lived in Marseille
or in Nice you might have

00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:13.078
somebody with a southern accent
giving the news about local

00:06:13.078 --> 00:06:15.424
schools,
and having pictures of young

00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:18.480
women presenting flowers to some
corrupt politician,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.785
and it would be like that.
But, basically,

00:06:21.785 --> 00:06:25.017
the news was always given by
people with a northern accent,

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.673
either a Loire Valley accent,
and they're very proud,

00:06:27.673 --> 00:06:30.029
they think they speak the best
French, but a Parisian accent.

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.701
But, that's all changed,
but the reality of the

00:06:33.701 --> 00:06:38.411
situation, that Paris is overly
dominant, has not changed at

00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:41.481
all.
And Balzac, to go back to

00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:46.732
Balzac, he put it the way
Parisians view the provinces,

00:06:46.732 --> 00:06:51.361
and this is still the case.
He described provincials as

00:06:51.361 --> 00:06:55.290
being dominated by routine and
monotony in their small towns,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.913
that they're all the same,
he wrote, which is obviously

00:06:58.913 --> 00:07:01.643
not the case.
He says, "provincials are like

00:07:01.643 --> 00:07:05.263
mold, burrowing in their little
plots, or frogs at the bottom of

00:07:05.263 --> 00:07:07.331
their puddles,
engaged in sordid,

00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:09.998
trivial rivalries,
moved by petty jealousies,

00:07:09.998 --> 00:07:14.168
avarice and material interests.
Since they do not think about

00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:17.950
the things that are serious,
they get excited by tiny

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.251
things."
Now, you used to have--there

00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:23.253
was a very famous cover of
The New Yorker in which

00:07:23.253 --> 00:07:26.470
you had a map of the United
States as seen from New York,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.477
and where you had New York,
and then you had this sort of

00:07:29.477 --> 00:07:33.480
large ditch that finally--then,
Los Angeles was half a football

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.510
throw away, and everything in
the middle was just sort of

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.440
desert,
basically.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.643
And, certainly,
the way that provincial

00:07:41.643 --> 00:07:44.832
people--including myself,
and we're legally residents of

00:07:44.832 --> 00:07:47.073
France,
and we live in Ardeche and I'm

00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:50.174
proud of it--view Parisians is
often with that same kind of

00:07:50.174 --> 00:07:52.420
contempt that the Parisians look
at us.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.837
And, I mean,
for example in France--and if

00:07:54.837 --> 00:07:58.139
this ever disappears I'm going
to be one unhappy guy--the

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:00.562
license plates,
the last numbers of the license

00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:02.199
plate tells you where people are
from.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.506
So, if you have a sixty-one
you're from the Ain,

00:08:04.506 --> 00:08:07.449
and if you have a sixty-two
you're from the Pas-de-Calais,

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:08.712
or if you have a sixty-three
you're from the

00:08:08.712 --> 00:08:11.123
Puy-de-Dôme.
And you can amuse yourself as

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:13.324
you're driving along,
saying, "well,

00:08:13.324 --> 00:08:17.096
that guy from Châteauroux
is off to visit his cousin in

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:20.657
Besançon."
That's the way I get by driving

00:08:20.657 --> 00:08:23.100
long rides;
but, during the vacation

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.769
seasons in July and August,
when all of us down here are

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:29.747
inundated with tourists,
when people see those

00:08:29.747 --> 00:08:32.215
seventy-fives,
which is the license plate for

00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:34.740
Paris or--and this is not on the
test--or,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.410
if they see seventy-seven,
seventy-eights,

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.950
ninety-one, ninety-two,
ninety-three,

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.036
ninety-four,
ninety-five,

00:08:41.036 --> 00:08:42.893
they know it's Paris,
in the Paris region,

00:08:42.893 --> 00:08:45.429
and they know that there'll be
certain expectations,

00:08:45.429 --> 00:08:47.516
often condescending
expectations,

00:08:47.516 --> 00:08:51.232
that will be in the way that
Parisians and people from the

00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:54.166
la region parisienne
present themselves

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:57.687
vis-à-vis we poor
struggling frogs in our little

00:08:57.687 --> 00:09:03.110
ponds.
Now, that has changed, for sure;

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.878
but, the centralization of the
French government and the

00:09:07.878 --> 00:09:12.559
domination of Paris over the
life of the nation is very

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:16.620
difficult to change,
over a long period of time.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.666
Now, and I guess one of the key
kind of indicators of what's

00:09:20.666 --> 00:09:25.082
going on in terms of economics,
the dominance of the Paris

00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:28.725
region in terms of the economy,
is that Lyon,

00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:32.120
which was always France's
second city,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.603
first in gastronomy,
as I said earlier,

00:09:34.603 --> 00:09:37.348
that the Bank of Lyon,
the Crédit

00:09:37.348 --> 00:09:40.370
Lyonnais,
that is, the Lyon Bank,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.855
in the 1860s moves its
headquarters to Paris and not in

00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:47.100
Lyon,
as if it's sort of given up.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.401
And, people,
for example,

00:09:48.401 --> 00:09:50.734
who follow the Lyon opera
always say, "well,

00:09:50.734 --> 00:09:52.850
our opera is fine but it's
nothing,

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.971
of course, like Paris,
where all the resources are

00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:59.500
poured into Paris."
How did it get this way?

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.268
Just thinking over the long
run, how did France end up so

00:10:04.268 --> 00:10:07.374
centralized?
All states centralized,

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:11.786
became larger and centralized
their ability to extract

00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:16.572
resources from their population.
If you take Europe in 1500,

00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:19.000
the year 1500,
there were about 1500

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.259
territorial states and they
ranged from big,

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:28.722
consolidated monarchies like
Spain and England and France to

00:10:28.722 --> 00:10:33.554
bishoprics such as Trier,
in Germany, that were hardly

00:10:33.554 --> 00:10:37.370
bigger than the gardens of the
archbishops who ran them.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.041
But, over a long period of
time, state-making is one of the

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:43.700
essential processes in European
history,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.925
the creational of more powerful
monarchical states and

00:10:47.925 --> 00:10:52.390
eventually of national states
with a variety of political

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.500
outcomes--the unification of
Italy,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.353
to the extent Italy's ever been
unified, the unification of

00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:05.240
Germany in 1871,
and Italy in the 1850s and '60s.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.415
But, in the case of France,
if you go to the sixteenth

00:11:08.415 --> 00:11:11.769
century, if you go to these
chateaux around the Loire,

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:15.612
and you see all of the
beautiful furniture that's been

00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:19.459
made by skilled artisans,
one you always see is you see

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:23.368
this big case with handles on
it, and they were--that's where

00:11:23.368 --> 00:11:26.429
the king's documents and the
Minister--well,

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:29.971
le Garde des Sceaux,
the Chief Financial Officer and

00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:32.618
Justice Officer,
where all their papers were,

00:11:32.618 --> 00:11:35.440
because the monarchy really
didn't have a capital.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.730
The monarchy was wherever the
king was.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.300
And it's in the sixteenth
century that Paris becomes the

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.486
capital.
Paris is not in the middle of

00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:46.718
France, as you can clearly see,
but you're not going to have a

00:11:46.718 --> 00:11:49.580
capital in Montluçon or
something like that.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.559
And, so, you have the kings
there;

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:56.429
and the whole process of
absolutism, which you don't have

00:11:56.429 --> 00:11:59.477
to know about.
But, it's in the seventeenth

00:11:59.477 --> 00:12:03.135
century that European rulers
expand their power

00:12:03.135 --> 00:12:07.413
vis-à-vis their enemies,
land-grabbing-- that's how

00:12:07.413 --> 00:12:10.500
France ends up with Alsace--and,
as I said before,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.767
increasing their ability to
extract resources,

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:19.509
that is to take money from very
ordinary people.

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:25.092
And, so, Louis XIV,
who liked to call himself the

00:12:25.092 --> 00:12:31.336
Sun God, a modest megalomaniac,
he sends out officials into the

00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:35.682
provinces to enforce his will,
and these dudes are called

00:12:35.682 --> 00:12:38.710
intendents--but that doesn't
matter,

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.522
you don't have to remember that.
But, they are out there and

00:12:41.522 --> 00:12:45.350
they go through a process of
negotiation with local elites,

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.659
with nobles and with law
courts;

00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:50.495
but, in the end,
the only thing that matters is

00:12:50.495 --> 00:12:53.269
that this increases the power of
the state,

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:56.373
that it's during the period of
absolute monarchy that armies

00:12:56.373 --> 00:12:58.746
become enormous.
And, if you travel around

00:12:58.746 --> 00:13:01.769
France, you'll see all the
fortifications of Vauban,

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:06.050
who was a military genius,
Vauban, and fortresses,

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.942
Papillion, and along the
Pyrénées there and

00:13:10.942 --> 00:13:13.977
up in Lille;
and up along here you'll see

00:13:13.977 --> 00:13:17.254
these fabulous fortresses,
and these fortresses had to be

00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:20.529
maintained by people who were
going to test the guns,

00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:23.404
the canons, to make sure they
worked, and to be there all the

00:13:23.404 --> 00:13:24.939
time;
and, thus you have this

00:13:24.939 --> 00:13:26.919
enormous increase in standing
armies.

00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:29.258
Now, and then here comes the
French Revolution,

00:13:29.258 --> 00:13:31.750
and what does the French
Revolution want to do?

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.203
Well, it wants to rationalize
the administration of France--it

00:13:35.203 --> 00:13:37.977
wants to do other things,
too, but that's not this

00:13:37.977 --> 00:13:40.300
course.
And, so, instead of having

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.223
where before you had something
like one-hundred tolls you had

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:47.839
to pay on the Loire River,
if you're transporting some

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:51.405
goods, they eliminate all those
tolls, they try to create

00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:54.844
uniformed weights and measures,
and that'll take one-hundred

00:13:54.844 --> 00:13:58.136
years before that really works.
But, what they do is they

00:13:58.136 --> 00:14:02.029
increase the power of the
center, of the government.

00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:05.095
And, in order--because their
arch-enemies are the nobles,

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.340
who are high-tailing it toward
Germany,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.998
and toward England and
everywhere else,

00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:11.311
and trying to launch wars
against the revolution--what

00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:14.259
they say is,
"we will undercut the authority

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:18.685
of the church and the nobles in
the provinces by creating what

00:14:18.685 --> 00:14:23.049
they call departments,
départements."

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:26.297
And, so, they create the
departments that become part of

00:14:26.297 --> 00:14:29.426
this administrative system,
so that every department--and

00:14:29.426 --> 00:14:32.064
this sounds boring but it's
actually interesting--every

00:14:32.064 --> 00:14:33.970
département in
France,

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.381
most of them are named after
rivers, and some after mountains

00:14:37.381 --> 00:14:40.973
or proximity to the sea,
will have the same officials,

00:14:40.973 --> 00:14:45.127
and that these strings that
reach out into now ninety-five

00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:49.314
departments in France,
including Corsica,

00:14:49.314 --> 00:14:53.568
all lead to Paris.
And, that where someone once

00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:57.525
said that Gaul was divided into
three parts, now what happens is

00:14:57.525 --> 00:15:00.100
people living in any region in
France,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.349
the three parts that they see
are the Ministry of Justice,

00:15:04.349 --> 00:15:07.816
the Ministry of War,
and the Ministry of the

00:15:07.816 --> 00:15:09.610
Interior.
So, you have these

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.776
départements,
and these are created in 1790,

00:15:12.776 --> 00:15:15.779
and they still exist.
The only big change came in

00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:18.808
1960 when they consolidated the
ones around Paris,

00:15:18.808 --> 00:15:21.342
because of the growth of the
Paris region,

00:15:21.342 --> 00:15:24.447
as you can see there.
So, if you take number one--but

00:15:24.447 --> 00:15:27.105
we don't have to go through them
all and I assure you we

00:15:27.105 --> 00:15:29.764
won't--if you take number one,
the Ain, a-i-n,

00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:33.159
it's named after a river;
or if you take number two,

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:36.019
the Aisne, a-i-s-n-e,
it's named after a river;

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.239
and how many hundreds of
thousands of people died along

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:42.092
there in World War One;
or, you take number three,

00:15:42.092 --> 00:15:43.350
the same thing,
Allier.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.877
They're named after rivers and
they don't all--they're not all

00:15:45.877 --> 00:15:47.953
the same size.
The biggest physically is

00:15:47.953 --> 00:15:51.174
Dordogne, which has probably
grown because so many British

00:15:51.174 --> 00:15:54.340
live there, something like 8,000
full-time residents.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.524
I'm pointing toward the
Charonne, that doesn't do any

00:15:56.524 --> 00:15:58.792
good, but anyway--because,
when I get close sometimes I

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.725
can't see.
And, then, the smallest is the

00:16:00.725 --> 00:16:02.340
Pyrén&amp;eac
ute;es-Orientales;

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.500
Roussillon, which is French
Catalonia.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.655
That doesn't matter.
The point is that the

00:16:07.655 --> 00:16:11.362
revolution, in order to defeat
its enemies, further centralizes

00:16:11.362 --> 00:16:14.461
the state,
and then along comes the little

00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:18.580
corporal, the little general,
the little megalomaniac,

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.688
Napoleon, N One.
And, he of course pushes

00:16:22.688 --> 00:16:26.138
centralization even further,
where he liked to brag--it's

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:29.279
one of these famous lines you
find in textbooks,

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.999
but--that he could look at his
watch and see what all the kids

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:34.139
in the lycées that
he'd created,

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:35.940
the high schools,
were studying at any one time.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.685
And he makes state
centralization even more

00:16:38.685 --> 00:16:42.014
important.
And, then, in the Second

00:16:42.014 --> 00:16:46.998
Empire, 1852/1870,
his nephew, who some wag once

00:16:46.998 --> 00:16:51.741
called the hat without the head,
Napoleon III,

00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:56.028
what he does is he uses
centralization as a tool of the

00:16:56.028 --> 00:17:00.870
state to consolidate his own
power and that of the Empire,

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:05.739
and that is to undercut the
residual influence of the

00:17:05.739 --> 00:17:08.268
nobility.
If you wanted something,

00:17:08.268 --> 00:17:10.640
and this is still true in
France today,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.950
it doesn't do any good to go to
the local notable,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.164
like you did in the eighteenth
century and say,

00:17:17.164 --> 00:17:19.960
"hey, monsieur,
the little guy,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.329
it would be great if we had a
school."

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:25.230
It doesn't do any good at all,
and he realizes that.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.584
And, so, the patronage of the
Empire is that he can provide

00:17:28.584 --> 00:17:31.996
railroads, he can provide money
for things, and that further

00:17:31.996 --> 00:17:35.125
centralizes the state.
And, so, you've got these

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:38.962
processes in the nineteenth
century, economic processes that

00:17:38.962 --> 00:17:42.669
you find all over Europe that
consolidate the power of the

00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:45.940
French State,
centralized in Paris.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.106
Railroads is a good
example--and sometimes I'll

00:17:48.106 --> 00:17:50.226
throw out examples,
you're not responsible for

00:17:50.226 --> 00:17:51.618
them,
it's just kind of hopefully

00:17:51.618 --> 00:17:52.910
interesting for you to think
about.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:57.455
If you think of two towns down
here, Brive, b-r-i-v-e,

00:17:57.455 --> 00:18:01.057
famous for its rugby,
and Tulle, t-u-l-l-e,

00:18:01.057 --> 00:18:04.105
which is a capital.
I mentioned it the first day

00:18:04.105 --> 00:18:05.910
because that's where lots of
people were hung.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.251
They were the same size in the
1850s, but Brive gets the

00:18:09.251 --> 00:18:12.289
railroad and not Tulle,
the railroad from Paris.

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:15.602
And, so, that centralization
is--also there are mountains

00:18:15.602 --> 00:18:17.910
there, it's easier to build in
Brive.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.388
But, the state can make or
break regions with their

00:18:21.388 --> 00:18:25.013
economic patronage.
And one of the reasons why

00:18:25.013 --> 00:18:29.339
France ends up with a republic,
and not a monarchy,

00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:32.727
is because these prefects who
represent the Republic can go

00:18:32.727 --> 00:18:34.829
into conservative regions and
say,

00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:37.759
"hey, we didn't really like the
way the elections came out last

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:39.722
time;
your municipal council,

00:18:39.722 --> 00:18:42.420
uh-uh-uh, a lot of monarchists
there.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.109
You would like a bridge across
your river, wouldn't you?"

00:18:46.109 --> 00:18:48.174
And that was the case in our
village because there wasn't a

00:18:48.174 --> 00:18:49.945
bridge across the river,
and there was a little boat

00:18:49.945 --> 00:18:51.480
would take people across this
awesome, swirling,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.558
dangerous river.
And, you want your bridge,

00:18:54.558 --> 00:18:57.640
well, let's see how the
elections go next time.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.000
The State can provide these
services.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.403
And the evolution of banking in
the nineteenth century further

00:19:04.403 --> 00:19:07.588
consolidates power.
There was sort of an economic

00:19:07.588 --> 00:19:11.099
takeoff in the 1850s and '60s in
Paris because the State banks

00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:13.364
are in Paris,
the State financial

00:19:13.364 --> 00:19:17.044
institutions are in Paris,
and they can make or break

00:19:17.044 --> 00:19:20.819
investment in all these places.
Now, the railroad,

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:23.940
even in our day,
maybe not in your day but

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.680
in--well, yes,
still in your day.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.563
I was on the TGV the third day
it opened which was--it opened

00:19:30.563 --> 00:19:33.863
on September twenty-eighth,
1981, and I was there on

00:19:33.863 --> 00:19:37.099
September^( )thirtieth,
taking a trip to Lyon,

00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:42.329
though it only went fast when
it really got to a certain point

00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:44.109
here.
Now, but the railroads,

00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:46.621
if you look at the map of the
railroads in France,

00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:48.569
at any time you want including
now,

00:19:48.569 --> 00:19:53.099
all roads lead--all tracks lead
to Paris.

00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:56.809
So, for example,
now if you want to go from--say

00:19:56.809 --> 00:20:00.361
you're in Lyon and you want to
go to Bordeaux,

00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:04.171
you're going to be broke.
The reason--unless you can take

00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:06.624
about eight hours to do
it--because, the way you're

00:20:06.624 --> 00:20:09.519
going to do it is you're going
to take a train that goes one

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:11.630
hour and fifty-eight minutes to
Paris,

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.759
and then you're going to take
another train that zips down

00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:16.900
here in about four hours to
Bordeaux,

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.843
but you're paying by kilometer.
So, it's going to be terribly

00:20:19.843 --> 00:20:22.084
expensive.
When I was commuting between

00:20:22.084 --> 00:20:24.935
Limoges and Paris,
that was still a long trip

00:20:24.935 --> 00:20:28.329
then, there was no TGV;
it was about four hours.

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:32.382
And, when I once took the train
over to Poitiers,

00:20:32.382 --> 00:20:36.433
it took three hours,
because if you go across the

00:20:36.433 --> 00:20:39.420
lines it's not good.
Now, how do trains--?

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.190
An obvious reason how trains
reinforce the predominance of

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.381
Paris.
Take my business,

00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:51.304
the teaching profession,
is that the domination of Paris

00:20:51.304 --> 00:20:55.869
is such that you have this
phenomenon in France,

00:20:55.869 --> 00:20:58.660
which they still call it
that--they call it

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.677
turbo-prof;
and a turbo train was a

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:04.882
fast train before the TGV,
the first ones went to Normandy

00:21:04.882 --> 00:21:07.920
to carry the wealthy Parisians
to Dorvillier [ph?].

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.484
And a turbo-prof is
somebody who lives in Paris,

00:21:11.484 --> 00:21:15.710
and whose dream is to teach at
Paris, particularly at Paris I.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.625
French universities are named
very poetically,

00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:20.375
Paris I, II,
III, IV, V, VI,

00:21:20.375 --> 00:21:23.207
all the way through XIV,
which is a real hole,

00:21:23.207 --> 00:21:26.638
or XIII is probably the worst.
But, the turbo-prof will

00:21:26.638 --> 00:21:30.369
be somebody who is assigned to
Reims, and who takes the train

00:21:30.369 --> 00:21:32.359
there every day,
or to Tours;

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:34.889
but to Lyon also since this is
only two hours,

00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:36.799
this is four-hundred
kilometers.

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:40.244
Two hours, you can be on a damn
train to New York City and

00:21:40.244 --> 00:21:43.386
you'll be lucky if you get
eighty miles in two hours,

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:47.081
or an hour and fifty minutes.
So, you've got people who live

00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:50.629
in Lyon who teach in Paris;
or, friends of mine that teach

00:21:50.629 --> 00:21:53.699
in Lille and live in Paris--or,
I teach in Rouen

00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:57.029
frequently--who live in Paris in
teach in Rouen.

00:21:57.029 --> 00:22:02.004
Now, this is bad because what
it does is sort of sucks local

00:22:02.004 --> 00:22:05.062
university life out,
and it means that this

00:22:05.062 --> 00:22:07.412
phenomenon of the
turbo-prof has been

00:22:07.412 --> 00:22:10.089
accentuated by the fast
train--the fast train,

00:22:10.089 --> 00:22:13.414
by the way I keep referring to
it, is called the TGV,

00:22:13.414 --> 00:22:16.099
the Train à
Grand Vitesse,

00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:18.990
because ça roule,
it goes fast.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.417
So, the nineteenth century
accentuates all of this,

00:22:22.417 --> 00:22:26.461
and the result is that still by
1947 when Gravier wrote this

00:22:26.461 --> 00:22:30.436
book called Paris and the
French Desert--if you look

00:22:30.436 --> 00:22:34.611
at an encyclopedia,
the definition of provincial,

00:22:34.611 --> 00:22:38.769
somebody who's provincial,
was still provincial,

00:22:38.769 --> 00:22:40.969
someone who is gauche,
and that's not politics,

00:22:40.969 --> 00:22:43.359
who's kind of a bumpkin,
kind of a pluke,

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:46.058
kind of a day late and a dollar
short, who lacks the

00:22:46.058 --> 00:22:48.916
distinction--I'm reading this
right out of the Larousse

00:22:48.916 --> 00:22:50.479
dictionary.
For example,

00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:54.390
to have--to give the impression
of being provincial with--like

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.595
you just arrived at the train
from Brittany in Gare

00:22:57.595 --> 00:22:59.757
Montparnasse,
and you're just so totally out

00:22:59.757 --> 00:23:01.067
of it you can hardly find a
place to buy

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:03.637
crêpes,
and then that's all you want to

00:23:03.637 --> 00:23:07.154
do, and you're sort of clueless.
And, so, the departments,

00:23:07.154 --> 00:23:10.940
along with the railroads and
along with better roads also,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:17.265
and the banking network,
increases the centralization of

00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:20.532
the French State.
And, I can remember,

00:23:20.532 --> 00:23:23.130
this is about twenty years ago,
but there was big

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.215
demonstrations from people in
Brittany because of--there's

00:23:26.215 --> 00:23:28.380
always these boats crashing
ashore,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.460
and oil slicks all over the
Breton coast;

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.738
or, people that produce
artichokes, the price of

00:23:32.738 --> 00:23:35.259
artichokes, because of the
méventes,

00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:38.358
the prices are so low there
that they're always rushing down

00:23:38.358 --> 00:23:41.562
to the prefecture and dumping
artichokes in the prefecture and

00:23:41.562 --> 00:23:43.991
protesting.
And, I remember there's one

00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:47.820
amazing photo from the Place de
la Concord, which is a big place

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.212
in Paris,
a big square,

00:23:49.212 --> 00:23:52.119
where you've got these Breton
mayors who are wearing their

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:54.099
sashes,
their tricolor sashes,

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:57.372
red, white and blue,
and the police are using--the

00:23:57.372 --> 00:23:59.130
CRS,
which are the military police;

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.518
they're a little less vicious
than they used to be,

00:24:01.518 --> 00:24:04.289
but I was in a demonstration
against Sarkozy in mid-May,

00:24:04.289 --> 00:24:07.218
and the police were,
the CRS, which is sort of carte

00:24:07.218 --> 00:24:09.400
blanche now, were fairly
aggressive.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.972
But, anyway,
these police were wrestling to

00:24:11.972 --> 00:24:14.789
the ground these mayors who were
protesting,

00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:19.292
using their tri-color sashes,
threatening to strangle them

00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:22.690
with their own sashes of their
authority.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.269
Only in France would this be
possible.

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:27.123
And, so, every government that
comes to power,

00:24:27.123 --> 00:24:29.430
they say, well we're going to
do something about this.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.863
De Gaulle said let--no he
didn't really say that,

00:24:31.863 --> 00:24:34.194
it was Mao--but,
"let the hundreds of thousands

00:24:34.194 --> 00:24:36.034
of flowers bloom."
But De Gaulle,

00:24:36.034 --> 00:24:38.206
who we'll talk about later,
De Gaulle said,

00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:40.947
how in the hell can you run a
state in which there are

00:24:40.947 --> 00:24:43.740
four-hundred and forty different
kinds of cheese?

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.887
There are a lot more than that.
And he believed that it was

00:24:46.887 --> 00:24:50.430
insidious, in order to have
these sort of regional cultures.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:54.273
I'll give you an example.
It was illegal--it's still

00:24:54.273 --> 00:24:58.974
illegal in France to name a baby
a name that is not officially

00:24:58.974 --> 00:25:02.519
approved, absolutely--or even to
adopt one.

00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:04.945
There was a famous case in the
1970s or '80s,

00:25:04.945 --> 00:25:06.930
there was a family called
Trognon,

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.827
and a trognon is a
cigarette butt,

00:25:08.827 --> 00:25:10.630
and when they tried to adopt a
baby,

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.868
it would be called,
let's say Jean-Philippe

00:25:12.868 --> 00:25:15.321
Trognon, they said,
"oh, no, that baby would be

00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:17.400
damaged by having such a last
name;

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.480
you don't have the right to
adopt this baby."

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.402
And there were cases where
Bretons tried to name their

00:25:22.402 --> 00:25:25.160
children Breton names and the
French State said,

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.221
uh-uh, pas possible,
because it wasn't officially

00:25:30.221 --> 00:25:32.463
French.
Well, De Gaulle has been dead

00:25:32.463 --> 00:25:34.950
for a very long time,
and there has been progress,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:40.228
but what has not changed is
still the power in Paris,

00:25:40.228 --> 00:25:45.710
in these ministries,
to dictate the life of schools,

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.526
of almost everything else.
And a lot of the strikes that

00:25:48.526 --> 00:25:51.500
you see in high schools and
in--I better get to my lecture,

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.025
but--you see in high schools
and even in middle schools,

00:25:55.025 --> 00:25:57.445
have to do with the State,
somebody saying,

00:25:57.445 --> 00:25:59.672
well we're going to take away
two-hundred teachers in your

00:25:59.672 --> 00:26:01.723
department,
or we're going to maintain a

00:26:01.723 --> 00:26:04.299
curriculum that doesn't seem to
make any sense.

00:26:04.299 --> 00:26:06.785
My son, when he was in
Seconde,

00:26:06.785 --> 00:26:10.009
which is the first year of
French high school,

00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:13.431
they were out blocking traffic
until some angry driver rolled

00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:17.023
over the foot of a protestor and
then everybody kind of went off

00:26:17.023 --> 00:26:19.970
and ate pizza.
But, these were reactions

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.119
against what the State was
trying to do.

00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:25.854
Or, in the 1980s,
when there were huge

00:26:25.854 --> 00:26:29.920
demonstrations by people
favoring the Catholic Church as

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.319
an institution vis-à-vis
education,

00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:36.526
it was the same thing,
with reacting against the kind

00:26:36.526 --> 00:26:39.980
of dictates or dictates
coming down from Paris.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.086
And when Gambetta,
whom you can read about,

00:26:42.086 --> 00:26:44.293
whom I mentioned the other day,
when he said,

00:26:44.293 --> 00:26:46.150
"clericalism,
there's the enemy";

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.625
and, then you had this sort of
campaign against the church,

00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:52.741
particularly the teaching
aspect of the church that's

00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:56.380
fascinating,
which I'll talk about later.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.471
So, France ends up like that.
Many people saw themselves as

00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:05.061
administrés,
that is, people who were

00:27:05.061 --> 00:27:07.385
administered,
who are governed,

00:27:07.385 --> 00:27:11.257
but in the sense of having
people passing papers back and

00:27:11.257 --> 00:27:13.554
forth,
and having to sign every damn

00:27:13.554 --> 00:27:15.747
thing you could ever
imagine--it's just

00:27:15.747 --> 00:27:19.211
unbelievable--before they ever
thought of themselves as being

00:27:19.211 --> 00:27:21.573
citizens.
And, certainly there is no

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:24.679
other country in the
post-communist world in which so

00:27:24.679 --> 00:27:28.130
many people work for the state.
Now, having said that,

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.035
let me just say as an
addendum--and this is my

00:27:31.035 --> 00:27:34.910
opinion, you could ignore
it--that things work in France.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.714
And, it used to be that twenty
or thirty years ago you'd say

00:27:36.714 --> 00:27:38.624
nothing in France works,
and everything works in the

00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:41.059
U.S, and now it's just the
opposite, totally the opposite.

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.454
And, if you're going to be
sick, and unless you're wealthy,

00:27:43.454 --> 00:27:45.890
you're better off being sick in
France than you are here,

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.455
because the system really works
and there are abuses,

00:27:48.455 --> 00:27:51.513
but the Social Security System
which encompasses more than just

00:27:51.513 --> 00:27:54.498
what we mean by Social Security,
the secu,

00:27:54.498 --> 00:27:58.501
which involves healthcare,
is one of those things that

00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:00.895
really works,
as annoying as the whole

00:28:00.895 --> 00:28:02.970
structure, and the taxes and all
of that.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.937
And, of course,
the challenge--so this is the

00:28:04.937 --> 00:28:07.619
latter part of the course--is
what do you do with this

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:10.633
and Europe?
Europe, which is going to erase

00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:15.092
these license plates and are
going to take away part of what

00:28:15.092 --> 00:28:18.742
it means to live in France.
And that's why I would've voted

00:28:18.742 --> 00:28:21.061
against the Constitution,
I encouraged people to vote

00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:23.888
against the Constitution,
and I know almost nobody,

00:28:23.888 --> 00:28:27.171
except professors in Paris and
Lyon, who are for that

00:28:27.171 --> 00:28:30.075
Constitution that was defeated a
year ago May^(

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.970
)twenty-ninth--so,
there.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.986
Anyway, now,
how did this all happen that

00:28:35.986 --> 00:28:41.408
given the fact in February of
1870 you had a Monarchist

00:28:41.408 --> 00:28:46.829
dominated Assembly elected in
which rural regions,

00:28:46.829 --> 00:28:49.731
particularly,
but not necessarily just

00:28:49.731 --> 00:28:53.809
Brittany and Normandy and
Auvergne--these are big,

00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:56.057
still Catholic regions,
as we'll see later,

00:28:56.057 --> 00:28:58.680
that they wanted the
restoration of a monarchy.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.390
Why does that not happen?
How does this country end up

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.116
being a Republic,
the Third Republic,

00:29:06.116 --> 00:29:10.659
which has been castigated or
been denounced because it seemed

00:29:10.659 --> 00:29:13.634
to fumble along?
But, it was the longest

00:29:13.634 --> 00:29:16.885
republic and it lasts from,
depending on when you start

00:29:16.885 --> 00:29:20.196
it--and you can read about
that--whether you start it in

00:29:20.196 --> 00:29:23.538
1875 or 1877,
or when there really was a

00:29:23.538 --> 00:29:27.360
Republic, the early '80s--it
lasts until May,

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.809
June 1940.
So, how did all that happen?

00:29:30.809 --> 00:29:35.341
Now, here we move into a
history that is the kind of old

00:29:35.341 --> 00:29:39.070
style history.
It's the story of decisions

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:43.839
taken by individual people.
There was a pretender to the

00:29:43.839 --> 00:29:48.620
throne, and this man was--his
life got off to an interesting

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.402
start.
He was dubbed the "miracle

00:29:51.402 --> 00:29:54.559
baby," for reasons that I will
explain.

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:59.707
The Comte de Chambord was a
Bourbon, he was part of the

00:29:59.707 --> 00:30:03.329
Royal Family of--that was Louis
XIV,

00:30:03.329 --> 00:30:09.478
and Louis XVI,
and in 1820 his father was

00:30:09.478 --> 00:30:17.009
assassinated by a Liberal,
a man called Louvel,

00:30:17.009 --> 00:30:19.515
and he's at the opera,
he gets kind of bored and he

00:30:19.515 --> 00:30:22.623
walks out, they leave the opera,
and this guy Louvel comes up

00:30:22.623 --> 00:30:24.930
and he stabs,
puts a knife right through him.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:29.619
And, it was not just a random
act, he wanted to extinguish

00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:33.016
this royal line.
And the Bourbons had been

00:30:33.016 --> 00:30:36.235
restored in 1815 to 1830.
Again, this your old style

00:30:36.235 --> 00:30:38.241
history.
So, France goes into great

00:30:38.241 --> 00:30:41.681
mourning.
The church bells ring very,

00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:44.932
very slowly,
all over the place,

00:30:44.932 --> 00:30:51.119
because there is--the heir to
the French throne is dead.

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:54.007
And there's a huge campaign
against the Liberals,

00:30:54.007 --> 00:30:57.022
because of that.
And then, lo and behold it

00:30:57.022 --> 00:31:00.961
turns out that his widow,
to whom he confessed various

00:31:00.961 --> 00:31:04.380
infidelities before expiring,
was pregnant;

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.893
indeed, he was the father.
They didn't run DNA tests or

00:31:07.893 --> 00:31:11.974
anything, but he was the father.
And as France held its breath,

00:31:11.974 --> 00:31:15.885
because they wanted a boy,
this miracle baby was born,

00:31:15.885 --> 00:31:20.046
l'enfant du miracle.
And the unfortunate thing is

00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:23.869
that he was sort of a sad sack,
un pauvre type.

00:31:23.869 --> 00:31:27.581
It's tough being the pretender
to the throne,

00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:31.714
the would-be Henri V,
and your name recognition is

00:31:31.714 --> 00:31:36.269
such that in Royalist towns in
the West of France,

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:38.170
like Nantes,
that somebody in the middle of

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:39.799
the night would scribble
graffiti,

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:42.658
Long Live Henri V,
and that people would get

00:31:42.658 --> 00:31:45.849
together in church on January^(
)twenty-first,

00:31:45.849 --> 00:31:49.764
the date that Louis XVI was
executed, and they would pray

00:31:49.764 --> 00:31:52.839
for the restoration of the
Bourbon throne.

00:31:52.839 --> 00:31:56.366
But, there's also another
family of pretenders,

00:31:56.366 --> 00:32:00.890
and that is the Orleanists,
the Orléanists,

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.619
but Orleanists--I just wrote it
there in English.

00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:08.024
And these people--this is kind
of boring-- but these people

00:32:08.024 --> 00:32:11.289
were in government between 1830
and 1848,

00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:14.529
and King Louis-Philippe,
who was chased from the throne

00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:17.300
in February of 1848,
was seen as progressive,

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.685
he was seen as the bourgeois
monarch but he was perfectly

00:32:20.685 --> 00:32:22.916
noble.
He'd gone to Kentucky and drunk

00:32:22.916 --> 00:32:25.420
lots of Bourbon once,
he carried an umbrella,

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.443
that sort of middle class
symbol of protection,

00:32:30.443 --> 00:32:35.140
and he is chased from the
throne in 1848.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.643
But, he'd helped modernize the
economy, and he did not restore

00:32:40.643 --> 00:32:44.909
the church to its old power.
And the Orleanists were

00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:48.029
extremely clever,
where Chambord was thick as a

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:50.112
brick,
and spent most of his time

00:32:50.112 --> 00:32:53.510
telling anti-Semitic jokes and
playing cards with his cronies

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.234
in the Austrian capital,
or mountains near Vienna--or

00:32:57.234 --> 00:33:01.779
maybe it was near Salzburg,
I guess it was near Salzburg,

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:05.664
the Orleanists had a bunch of
sons of Louis-Philippe who were

00:33:05.664 --> 00:33:07.315
pretty clever.
One of them,

00:33:07.315 --> 00:33:10.238
by the way, just about ten
years ago, the Orleanist family

00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:13.109
suffered kind of an embarrassing
reversal when one of the

00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:15.606
Orleanists,
sort of the third in line if

00:33:15.606 --> 00:33:18.900
there was ever an Orleanist
restoration of the throne,

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.307
was arrested for burglary,
as being an accessory for

00:33:21.307 --> 00:33:23.809
burglary in the Pyrén&amp;eac
ute;es-Orientales.

00:33:23.809 --> 00:33:26.793
But, anyway,
so when France collapsed after

00:33:26.793 --> 00:33:29.920
the war, and when the Commune
comes along,

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.046
it seems to Royalists,
that is, the people who wanted

00:33:33.046 --> 00:33:37.380
a restoration of the monarchy,
that their ship had come in.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.999
So what's going to happen?
Now, it's easy to make fun of

00:33:40.999 --> 00:33:44.946
Chambord, who was a pauvre
type, a sad sack,

00:33:44.946 --> 00:33:48.611
in many ways.
But, the history of Royalism is

00:33:48.611 --> 00:33:52.950
not--it goes beyond that,
and there was a strong Royalist

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.234
movement,
as I've already suggested,

00:33:55.234 --> 00:33:57.579
and it wasn't just people
looking backwards.

00:33:57.579 --> 00:34:01.319
Indeed, he said in his various
pronouncements written for him

00:34:01.319 --> 00:34:04.934
by someone else that he didn't
want to be a king of the old

00:34:04.934 --> 00:34:07.726
regime,
he did not want to turn the

00:34:07.726 --> 00:34:11.393
clock back to 1788,
and that you could combine a

00:34:11.393 --> 00:34:15.838
modernity with monarchy.
But, there was never any doubt

00:34:15.838 --> 00:34:20.360
that if he was restored to the
throne that he would rule.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.234
And you have to imagine him
after the commune,

00:34:23.234 --> 00:34:26.940
after the slaughter and the
buildings are still burning,

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.349
or at least smoldering,
that he comes to Paris.

00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:32.657
And he'd never,
rather like Louis-Napoleon,

00:34:32.657 --> 00:34:34.800
had hardly ever been in Paris
before;

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.064
he really hadn't,
I don't think,

00:34:36.064 --> 00:34:37.287
ever.
So, he gets a carriage,

00:34:37.287 --> 00:34:39.041
he rents a carriage,
and he goes around as a

00:34:39.041 --> 00:34:41.234
tourist,
and he goes to Notre Dame,

00:34:41.234 --> 00:34:45.194
and he goes to Sainte-Chapelle,
and he goes to pay homage at

00:34:45.194 --> 00:34:48.483
what they thought were the
remains of his departed

00:34:48.483 --> 00:34:51.364
ancestors.
And he had bone fragments of

00:34:51.364 --> 00:34:54.443
what they thought--or,
at least, ashes of Marie

00:34:54.443 --> 00:34:58.460
Antoinette that he had with him
in his room all the time.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.761
And, so, but it's not--he has
his entourage,

00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:04.909
he has his posse,
he has his entourage.

00:35:04.909 --> 00:35:08.439
But, there also are these
strong traditions of popular

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:12.568
Royalism, of ordinary people and
peasants who believe fervently

00:35:12.568 --> 00:35:15.681
in the monarchy.
You found them in very odd

00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:17.895
places.
There's a strong tradition in

00:35:17.895 --> 00:35:21.340
Nîme, one of my favorite
places, of popular Royalism,

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.126
and also of course in
Brittany--I keep giving Breton

00:35:24.126 --> 00:35:28.171
examples, I'll pick other ones.
So, and also because of the

00:35:28.171 --> 00:35:32.654
close association of the
monarchy, and particularly the

00:35:32.654 --> 00:35:35.850
Legitimists,
they're called Legitimists,

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:39.246
the Bourbons with the
church--you've got fertile

00:35:39.246 --> 00:35:43.219
ground in areas that were still
practicing religion,

00:35:43.219 --> 00:35:46.039
and we'll talk more about that
another time.

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:51.394
He makes clear that he is going
to restore the church to its,

00:35:51.394 --> 00:35:56.659
what he considered rightful
place of privilege in France;

00:35:56.659 --> 00:36:00.645
and, possibly,
he could benefit from the wave

00:36:00.645 --> 00:36:05.900
of religious revival that occurs
in France in the 1870s.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.401
Now, every time there's a big
time political disaster,

00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:11.139
from the point of view of the
Catholic Church in France,

00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:14.809
it's followed by a period of
religious revival.

00:36:14.809 --> 00:36:18.442
After the French Revolution and
Napoleon, and Napoleon makes

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:21.357
peace with the church,
there is, all of a sudden,

00:36:21.357 --> 00:36:24.510
a revival with people forming
religious confraternities,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.104
of people paying to rebuild
churches that have been

00:36:27.104 --> 00:36:28.920
vandalized during the
Revolution,

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.952
where they're melting down
church bells to use as cannon

00:36:31.952 --> 00:36:35.464
and things like that.
The famous beautiful,

00:36:35.464 --> 00:36:41.236
fabulous, fabulous Monastery
Church of Cluny is up near

00:36:41.236 --> 00:36:44.562
Mâcon,
right here, had been destroyed

00:36:44.562 --> 00:36:47.835
and they tried to--they restored
a couple of the remaining

00:36:47.835 --> 00:36:49.916
towers.
And, as Chateaubriand said,

00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:53.097
the writer, "I don't know what
we must believe but we must

00:36:53.097 --> 00:36:56.166
believe in something," and he
gets down on his knees and

00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:58.709
prays.
The same thing happens in the

00:36:58.709 --> 00:37:02.170
1870s, there's a revival of that
old time religion,

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.644
and it's helped by various
miracles and that kind of thing,

00:37:05.644 --> 00:37:08.940
but which I'll talk about in
the lecture on religion,

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.420
which is kind of fun--it's fun
to do.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.578
And, for example,
when you go to any town or any

00:37:15.578 --> 00:37:19.880
village in France you will see
what they call Mission Crosses.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.389
You'll see these crosses that
are stone crosses.

00:37:22.389 --> 00:37:25.403
The first ones were put up
during the counter-reformation,

00:37:25.403 --> 00:37:28.677
or the Catholic reformation,
in the^( )seventeenth century,

00:37:28.677 --> 00:37:31.660
to try to win back areas that
had become Protestant,

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.978
that is, around Lyon.
You find some that are put up,

00:37:34.978 --> 00:37:38.077
not surprisingly,
after 1815, and the others are

00:37:38.077 --> 00:37:41.440
in the 1860s or the 1870s,
and then never again.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.760
And these are big crosses that
are put out, usually outside the

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.231
villages.
And, sometimes the crosses were

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:50.204
destroyed during the
revolutions--there was a huge

00:37:50.204 --> 00:37:53.360
one in Reims destroyed in the
Revolution of 1830;

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.360
but, most of these crosses,
you can read them.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.209
This is an iconography of
belief, and you can see the

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.840
dates because they'll put the
date, like 1868.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.309
There's about ten of them in
our village.

00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:04.487
Some of them there are just
little stumps left,

00:38:04.487 --> 00:38:07.090
but it's kind of fun to walk
around and look at them;

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:10.278
but, here these proliferate
wildly, and so there'll be

00:38:10.278 --> 00:38:12.364
missions.
And, I remember when I went to

00:38:12.364 --> 00:38:15.119
Jesuit high school in Portland,
Oregon we had to have these

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:17.928
retreats or revivals,
and the priest would--these

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:21.388
missionaries would come in,
and for three days thunder at

00:38:21.388 --> 00:38:24.909
you and then people would go off
and go to Confession;

00:38:24.909 --> 00:38:28.210
and I didn't have much to
confess, I often wish I had had.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.918
But, in those days in high
school-- but anyway,

00:38:30.918 --> 00:38:33.510
there we go--you'd go and do
these things,

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:37.032
and it would be a big sort of
public spectacle,

00:38:37.032 --> 00:38:40.674
a spectacle.
And, so, Henri V could

00:38:40.674 --> 00:38:46.407
capitalize on that because there
were lots of people that would

00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:52.139
be very happy to see him come
back because of their belief.

00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:56.350
But, it's hard,
if you're fourty-seven years,

00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:01.710
your job is a pretender to the
throne, it's difficult.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.199
He had a hard time getting
around.

00:39:03.199 --> 00:39:07.967
He'd had a very royal accident,
he'd broken his leg falling off

00:39:07.967 --> 00:39:10.889
a horse, and he had a terrible
limp.

00:39:10.889 --> 00:39:13.322
And, also, because he just sat
around and played cards all the

00:39:13.322 --> 00:39:16.244
time and ate and drank,
he became quite a large man,

00:39:16.244 --> 00:39:20.438
and occasionally he would get
up and go and look at the relics

00:39:20.438 --> 00:39:23.802
of Marie Antoinette,
and then he'd go back and play

00:39:23.802 --> 00:39:26.510
cards for big stakes;
he was a big-time gambler.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:30.877
Because he wasn't a very good
card player his posse took him

00:39:30.877 --> 00:39:33.690
for fairly sizable amounts of
money.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.815
But, he viewed "hereditary
monarchy" as the unique port of

00:39:38.815 --> 00:39:43.850
salvation--that's a very
religious image--that could save

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:46.817
France.
And he talked about strong

00:39:46.817 --> 00:39:51.000
authority underplaying judicious
liberty, for example.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.172
And the key to his strength,
besides the church,

00:39:54.172 --> 00:39:57.618
are the nobles.
Now, having a noble title

00:39:57.618 --> 00:40:02.122
didn't do a hell of a lot of
good after the French

00:40:02.122 --> 00:40:05.273
Revolution,
and it's easy to give this sort

00:40:05.273 --> 00:40:08.939
of stereotype of nobles as being
just letting their nails grow

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:12.365
very long and drinking nice
wines and chasing each other's

00:40:12.365 --> 00:40:15.070
mistresses and wives around the
gardens,

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:20.322
in Versailles or anywhere else.
In fact, many nobles became

00:40:20.322 --> 00:40:23.782
chairmen of the boards of
various companies,

00:40:23.782 --> 00:40:26.760
and they still had these
atavisms,

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.739
these throwbacks to the old
regime where it was said near

00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:32.718
Toulouse that if the noble
announced after mass that it'd

00:40:32.718 --> 00:40:34.739
be good to have a little
firewood,

00:40:34.739 --> 00:40:38.763
that he could look out from the
ponderosa and see peasants,

00:40:38.763 --> 00:40:42.648
obedient peasants carrying
large stacks of wood up to the

00:40:42.648 --> 00:40:45.415
big house;
and, maybe they'd get a little

00:40:45.415 --> 00:40:47.690
something on Easter from the big
guy.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.975
But, basically the State was
winning the battle against the

00:40:51.975 --> 00:40:56.039
nobles, and you could still be
the Count of anywhere,

00:40:56.039 --> 00:40:59.899
or the Duke of anywhere,
and you can't mobilize goodies

00:40:59.899 --> 00:41:03.830
to give to local people except
on a very local scale.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.987
And the state is winning out.
Now, Gambetta,

00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:11.979
who was a smart guy who dies
very young, he said that France

00:41:11.979 --> 00:41:16.106
became a republic because most
of the people wanted a republic

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:20.250
and they didn't want a monarchy,
and that's all there was to it.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:28.524
And the elections in the early
1880s would certainly make this

00:41:28.524 --> 00:41:31.063
clear.
Now, there was even a group of

00:41:31.063 --> 00:41:33.389
nobles who believed that they
could be elected,

00:41:33.389 --> 00:41:36.934
that if you had an election
people would actually vote to

00:41:36.934 --> 00:41:40.017
restore the monarchy.
These were kind of the popular

00:41:40.017 --> 00:41:42.079
royalists of places like
Nîmes.

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:43.461
By the way, I should write
these things down,

00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:43.870
Nîme.

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:50.131
See, in the old regime there
would've been an "s" there,

00:41:50.131 --> 00:41:52.610
and that's why you've got this
little chapeau up there.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.223
Anyway, but that wasn't going
to happen because most people in

00:41:56.223 --> 00:41:58.830
France ultimately did not want a
monarchy.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:06.891
But, what about old Chambord?
When disaster came he was not

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:10.252
ready.
He issued poorly constructed

00:42:10.252 --> 00:42:14.714
manifestos in order to espouse,
quote, "the freedom of the

00:42:14.714 --> 00:42:19.725
church as the prime condition of
the peace of spirit and order in

00:42:19.725 --> 00:42:23.039
the world,
and to protect the Pope with

00:42:23.039 --> 00:42:27.776
the honor of our country in the
most incontestable cause of its

00:42:27.776 --> 00:42:32.280
glory among nations,"
et cetera, et cetera.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:36.176
But, there was a big problem,
that for all of his failings,

00:42:36.176 --> 00:42:39.199
human failings,
and there were indeed many,

00:42:39.199 --> 00:42:44.561
and his intellectual
limitations which were daunting,

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:50.130
he was a man of faith and
loyalty to his principles,

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.889
for better or for worse,
in this context.

00:42:52.889 --> 00:42:57.641
And, in 1789 when the
Revolution came and then

00:42:57.641 --> 00:43:03.659
executed old Louis XVI,
the white flag of the Bourbons,

00:43:03.659 --> 00:43:06.460
plain white flag of the
Bourbons, sometimes with a

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.460
fleur-de-lys on it,
and all that,

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.680
was replaced by the red,
white and blue flag,

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.119
the three colored flag,
the tricolore,

00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:19.443
which was a combination of
adding the color white for the

00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:24.897
Bourbons in 1789,
to the red and blue that were

00:43:24.897 --> 00:43:30.809
the colors of Paris,
of the city of Paris.

00:43:30.809 --> 00:43:35.000
And, in the end he refused to
compromise when his advisors

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.631
say, look, we can pull this off
if you agree to accept the three

00:43:39.631 --> 00:43:43.849
colored flag of revolution,
of the French Revolution,

00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:46.720
which had killed his family
members;

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.715
and, he refused to do that.
And they tried to make a deal

00:43:49.715 --> 00:43:52.074
with the Orleanists,
and the Orleanists produced

00:43:52.074 --> 00:43:56.699
children, one after another.
But Chambord had no children.

00:43:56.699 --> 00:44:00.466
And, so, upon his death who is
going to follow him,

00:44:00.466 --> 00:44:04.450
if he's going to be king?
And, so, they proposed a deal,

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:08.547
why don't you be king until you
croak-- they didn't put it quite

00:44:08.547 --> 00:44:11.994
like that--and then the
Orleanists will take over with

00:44:11.994 --> 00:44:14.590
the red,
white and blue flag?

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:16.555
And he said,
to his credit,

00:44:16.555 --> 00:44:20.865
"no, without my principles I am
just"--as he put it rather

00:44:20.865 --> 00:44:25.402
indelicately and cruelly about
himself--"a fat man with a big

00:44:25.402 --> 00:44:28.320
limp."
And he went back to his castle,

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.239
anti-Semitic jokes and
card-playing buddies.

00:44:31.239 --> 00:44:37.048
And, so, France lurched into a
period called The Moral Order,

00:44:37.048 --> 00:44:40.340
the Republic of the Moral
Order.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.868
You can read the details of
this, which are not fascinating,

00:44:42.868 --> 00:44:45.268
but we'll get through this and
move onto more interesting

00:44:45.268 --> 00:44:48.205
things.
In 1875 there's an amendment to

00:44:48.205 --> 00:44:52.500
the Constitution that
essentially--voted by one vote,

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.640
or approved by one vote,
by the Assembly--that

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.989
essentially transforms France
into a Republic.

00:44:58.989 --> 00:45:03.862
In 1877 a general called
Mac-Mahon, who had fought in the

00:45:03.862 --> 00:45:09.429
1870/71 war--you may think that
that's not a very French name;

00:45:09.429 --> 00:45:13.280
there's a strong Irish
influence around Bordeaux.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.961
In fact, one of the great
Bordeaux wines is called Lynge

00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:18.789
Barge, lynge as in lynch,
which is an Irish name.

00:45:18.789 --> 00:45:24.252
But, Mac-Mahon was French,
and that he is a general and

00:45:24.252 --> 00:45:29.348
becomes president of the State,
and he tries in 1877,

00:45:29.348 --> 00:45:34.119
on the sixteenth of^( )May,
to overthrow the government,

00:45:34.119 --> 00:45:37.427
and basically a question of
responsibility to whom--it's not

00:45:37.427 --> 00:45:39.389
interesting--he fails to do
that,

00:45:39.389 --> 00:45:45.780
and France in the early 1880s,
you have this sort of rooting

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.352
of the Republic,
and a rooting of the Republic

00:45:50.352 --> 00:45:54.150
because most people in France
wanted one.

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.949
It seemed to be the regime that
divided France least,

00:45:56.949 --> 00:45:59.750
what Gambetta called the
nouvelles couches,

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.728
or the new social strata,
the new social strata,

00:46:02.728 --> 00:46:05.389
the middle classes,
the petty bourgeois.

00:46:05.389 --> 00:46:08.349
Workers obviously didn't want a
monarchy;

00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:13.352
but, in many areas of France,
particularly in the south,

00:46:13.352 --> 00:46:18.537
lots of peasants did want a
republic, and France becomes a

00:46:18.537 --> 00:46:22.461
republic.
And, this republic is strongly

00:46:22.461 --> 00:46:27.212
identified with Paris,
and if, because of the fear of

00:46:27.212 --> 00:46:30.146
Caesarism,
the fear of another Napoleon,

00:46:30.146 --> 00:46:33.820
or another Robespierre before
that, or another Napoleon III,

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.789
they create executive authority
that's extremely weak.

00:46:37.789 --> 00:46:42.790
Power is in the Chamber of
Deputies, in the Assembly,

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.059
and the President is a
convener;

00:46:46.059 --> 00:46:48.236
he tries to get people to do
the right things,

00:46:48.236 --> 00:46:50.917
and it's a political club.
They all tutoyer each

00:46:50.917 --> 00:46:53.097
other, even if they hate each
other's politics,

00:46:53.097 --> 00:46:55.420
and they call each other by the
informal name.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.773
And, even though it's
decentralized,

00:46:57.773 --> 00:47:01.000
it does not mean that the State
is not strong,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.085
and that the State will not be
making decisions that will

00:47:04.085 --> 00:47:06.179
affect the lives of ordinary
people.

00:47:06.179 --> 00:47:09.761
And the most controversial of
those decisions will ultimately

00:47:09.761 --> 00:47:13.342
be in 1905--if you exclude going
to war and getting all these

00:47:13.342 --> 00:47:16.803
millions of people killed--was
the separation of church and

00:47:16.803 --> 00:47:19.956
state.
And, that is the work of a

00:47:19.956 --> 00:47:24.829
strongly centralized government,
centered in Paris,

00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:28.177
as I've said over and over
again, but imposing its will,

00:47:28.177 --> 00:47:31.309
for better or for worse,
on the provinces;

00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:34.426
and, in doing so,
following train tracks,

00:47:34.426 --> 00:47:38.087
following the roads,
following these centralized

00:47:38.087 --> 00:47:42.069
sort of vines,
going out from Paris into the

00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:47.140
provinces, as a way of exerting
its will, its influence,

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.768
and its patronage.
And, in conclusion,

00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:55.479
the state becomes the new ways
that patronage,

00:47:55.479 --> 00:47:59.665
economic, financial,
cultural, political,

00:47:59.665 --> 00:48:03.905
is dispensed.
It replaces the nobility,

00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:07.675
the local nobles,
it replaces the church,

00:48:07.675 --> 00:48:13.140
and it replaces the monarchy
that most people in France did

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.510
not want.
Next time let's talk about

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.928
identity, and let's talk about
one of my favorite topics,

00:48:20.928 --> 00:48:25.030
the role of the schools in
towns and in villages.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.030
See ya.

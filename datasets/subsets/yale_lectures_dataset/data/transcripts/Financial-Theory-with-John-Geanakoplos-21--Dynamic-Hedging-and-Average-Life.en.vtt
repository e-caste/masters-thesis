00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.760
Prof: So time to start.
 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.280
So let me begin by reviewing a
little bit of the dynamic

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.672
hedging which I could have
described a little bit more

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:12.080
clearly last time.
 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.151
It's a very important idea and
I made a little bit of a mess of

00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:17.560
it.
 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.555
I didn't make that big a mess
of it, but a little bit of a

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:20.010
mess of it.
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.301
So let's be a little bit
careful now about who knows what

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.140
and what you're doing.
 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.765
So we said imagine somebody who
knows that the probability the

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:35.240
Yankees are going to win the
World Series is 60 percent,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.600
and therefore each game of the
World Series is 60 percent,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.024
and knows that the probability
the Phillies win the game is 40

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:44.750
percent.
 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.403
So suppose that he finds
somebody who is willing to bet

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:51.730
with him on the Phillies.
 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.210
So he can win 100 dollars if
the Yankees win.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.410
He has to pay 100 dollars if
the Yankees lose.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.368
Now, his expected payoff is 20.
 

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:04.183
He should take the bet because
if the person's willing to bet

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:06.620
at even odds,
the Phillies fan's willing to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.120
bet at even odds and he knows
the odds are 60/40,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.519
on expectation he's going to
make 20.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:14.578
So it's clear what he should
do, but the problem is he's

00:01:14.578 --> 00:01:15.578
subject to risk.
 

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:19.849
Although he's right about the
odds he could still,

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:22.129
even though he's done the smart
thing,

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:25.563
he could still end up losing
100 dollars which could be a

00:01:25.563 --> 00:01:26.730
disaster for him.
 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.629
So what he would like to do is
to hedge his bets.

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:32.470
Now, what does it mean hedge
his bet?

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.900
Well, suppose there was another
bookie who was willing to bet at

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.840
60/40 odds in either direction
then what should he do?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.144
Well, if he can find another
bookie who was willing to bet at

00:01:46.144 --> 00:01:51.093
60/40 odds he should try and
lock in 20 dollars no matter

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:51.890
what.
 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.500
So he should do this bet.
 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.858
He should bet with the other
bookie 80 dollars.

00:02:02.858 --> 00:02:06.700
He'd be willing to give up 80
dollars if the Yankees won in

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.878
order to win 120 dollars if the
Phillies win,

00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:13.397
and that's a fair bet according
to the other bookie because it's

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:15.492
60/40 odds,
60 percent of this and 40

00:02:15.492 --> 00:02:18.990
percent of that,
this is 3 to 2 odds so it's a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.870
fair bet.
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.752
So in other words,
he makes money by taking

00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:26.116
advantage of the Philly fan to
bet on the Yankees,

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:28.449
but that subjects him to risk.
 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.150
So in order to minimize the
risk he hedges his bet.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.830
That's where the expression
came from.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.628
He hedges that bet by betting
in the opposite direction,

00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:40.550
on--betting on the Phillies
with his bookie,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.454
in the opposite direction,
but standing to lose less than

00:02:45.454 --> 00:02:48.024
he,
you know, he's betting in this

00:02:48.024 --> 00:02:50.520
proportion,
in this amount so that he gets

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.538
20 no matter what.
 

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.990
So he's locked in his 20-dollar
profit.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.949
So that was where we began.
 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.187
Now, let's just think about it
a little bit more carefully than

00:02:58.187 --> 00:02:58.729
I did before.
 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:02.068
Somebody, in fact,
basically asked this question.

00:03:02.068 --> 00:03:05.492
Is he really making money
because he understands better

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:08.218
the odds of the Yankees winning
the game?

00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:11.800
Is he making money because he
knows the odds are 60/40 and the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.090
poor Philly fan thinks they're
50/50?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.370
The answer is no.
 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.750
That's not why he's making
money.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.169
It doesn't matter what the odds
are of the Yankees winning.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.955
He's winning because he's
managed to arbitrage two

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:27.247
different betters,
namely the Philly fan and the

00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:29.566
other bookie,
and the fact that they differ

00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:32.532
in their beliefs,
the fact that he can trade with

00:03:32.532 --> 00:03:35.780
the bookie at 3 to 2 odds
whatever bet he wants,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.030
and the Philly fan is trading
at different odds with him.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.440
That's what enables him to make
his profit.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.301
So how did he make the
arbitrage--so what is an

00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:47.310
arbitrage?
 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.466
An arbitrage is,
you find two bets which are

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:54.650
more or less the same thing,
which in fact are exactly the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.099
same thing, but trade at a
different price.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.080
So what are the two bets?
 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:12.693
Well, there's the Philly bet,
the Philly fan bet,

00:04:12.693 --> 00:04:24.709
and then there's the bookie bet
plus borrowing 20 dollars.

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:27.540
So he's going to make 20 for
sure.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.732
So he could make the 20 at the
beginning just by borrowing

00:04:30.732 --> 00:04:32.019
against his winnings.
 

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:37.829
Then he'd have 20 at the very
beginning and his payoffs from

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:43.639
the Philly fan bet would be
exactly--he'd owe the 20 so he'd

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.509
have minus 100.
 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:52.091
So this bet is he'd be able to
get 20 at the beginning,

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:57.089
but he'd have to pay minus 100
and 100.

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:05.947
He'd pay 100 dollars if the
Yankees won, and get 100 dollars

00:05:05.947 --> 00:05:09.250
if the Phillies won.
 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.144
And so that way he'd cancel his
bet at the end and end up with

00:05:14.144 --> 00:05:15.910
20 dollars for sure.
 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.608
So just to say it again,
he's made money apparently

00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:21.360
because he knows more than the
Philly fan knows,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.949
but actually in order to
guarantee that he doesn't run a

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.430
risk he has to find another
trader,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.990
and it's the presence of the
other trader who's really giving

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.629
him his profit opportunity,
not his superior knowledge.

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.093
And the fact that he has two
different traders--and so why

00:05:37.093 --> 00:05:38.649
does that give him an
opportunity?

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:43.418
Because he can arrange a bet
with the Philly fan and a bet

00:05:43.418 --> 00:05:48.591
with the other bookie,
but combined with borrowing the

00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:54.459
money so that in the end he's
going to just get 0 payoffs.

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.790
Putting together the Philly fan
bet,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.564
and the bookie fan bet,
and borrowing 20 dollars he

00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:01.838
gets 20 dollars at the very
beginning,

00:06:01.838 --> 00:06:05.100
and on net he has nothing at
the end,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.430
so whatever losses he got from
the Phillies he made up from the

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.129
bookie bet.
 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.100
Whatever losses he had from the
bookie bet he made up for it

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.410
with the Philly fan bet.
 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.569
So arbitrage relies on
replication.

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:24.439
Somehow through some other
bet--he was able to hedge his

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.939
other bet.
 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.843
He was able to hedge his
Phillies bet by replicating the

00:06:29.843 --> 00:06:33.819
bet with somebody else combined
with borrowing to produce

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.730
exactly the same payoffs in the
end,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.079
or the negative of the payoffs
in the end,

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:41.860
and yet for a different price
at the beginning.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.934
The Philly fan didn't demand
any money upfront to make this

00:06:44.934 --> 00:06:46.629
(100, minus 100) bet with him.
 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:51.584
And with the bookie he's able
to get 20 dollars upfront and

00:06:51.584 --> 00:06:56.199
make this the opposite bet,
the (minus 100,100) bet.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.711
So by getting more money
upfront and doing the opposite

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:03.418
bet with the bookie he can end
up completely canceling the

00:07:03.418 --> 00:07:05.274
Philly bet,
Philly fan bet,

00:07:05.274 --> 00:07:07.230
and that's how he makes his
profit.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.069
So that was the first idea.
 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:11.439
So what have I clarified?
 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:14.410
What I've clarified is that it
wasn't his superior knowledge,

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.113
it was the presence of two
different traders that enabled

00:07:17.113 --> 00:07:20.115
him to make his profit,
and I've clarified the method

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:21.620
that he made the profit.
 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.488
The profit wasn't just kind of
mixing in another bet,

00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:29.283
it was really cleverly
arranging to undo totally the

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:30.550
original bet.
 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.627
So he got actually 0 in the end
and ended up with 20 dollars at

00:07:34.627 --> 00:07:35.680
the beginning.
 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.290
So let's just see now what you
would do in a dynamic situation.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.990
Yes?
 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.600
Student: I apologize.
 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.410
I understand how this locks him
into that $20 dollars,

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.245
and how it makes sure he
doesn't incur the losses that he

00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:49.180
might have occurred,
but why would he do this if he

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.579
has 20 dollars at the beginning
and all this does is make sure

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:53.940
no matter what he ends up with
the 20 dollars at the end?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.319
Prof: Why would he do
what at all?

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.920
Student: This arbitrage
at all, any of the bets.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.322
It seems like no matter what
whether the Yankees or lose he

00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:00.399
ends up with 20 dollars.
 

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:02.550
Why didn't he just keep his 20
dollars and not bet?

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.230
Prof: He didn't have 20
dollars to begin with.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.560
He had no dollars.
 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.915
So he went and found the Philly
fan and he made a bet against

00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:10.649
the Philly fan with no money.
 

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:14.524
The Philly fan was willing to
bet him 100 dollars on the

00:08:14.524 --> 00:08:15.300
Phillies.
 

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.740
So he gets 100 if the Yankees
win.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.040
He pays the fan 100 if the
Phillies win.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.740
It didn't cost any money to do
that.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.120
Then he goes out and makes
another bet with the bookie.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.680
Again, it doesn't cost him any
money.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.110
He gives up 80 dollars if the
Yankees win, but he gets $120 if

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.180
the Phillies win.
 

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.398
So he's spent no money at all
and his total profit is 20

00:08:33.398 --> 00:08:34.509
dollars for sure.
 

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:36.816
So what could he do since he
knows he's going to make 20

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.200
dollars for sure in the future?
 

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.596
He could just borrow it at the
beginning if the interest rate's

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:42.215
0,
have 20 dollars at the

00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:45.908
beginning, end up with 0 no
matter what the uncertainty is

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:48.500
and put the 20 dollars in his
pocket.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.979
So that's another way of saying
the same thing which is that he

00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:54.721
could,
by combining the bets,

00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:57.746
put money in his pocket in at
the beginning and no matter what

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.774
happens in the future he doesn't
have to give anybody any more

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:01.320
money.
 

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.090
So that's what he's done.
 

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.230
That's what an arbitrage is.
 

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.961
You put money in your pocket in
the present and in the future

00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.139
you never have to face a
problem.

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:13.681
You've always got money that's
going out in one hand you're

00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:16.028
getting from the other hand.
 

00:09:16.028 --> 00:09:19.840
Now, in a dynamic situation you
can do the same thing.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.259
So I'm just reinterpreting what
we did before a little bit.

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:25.019
So in the dynamic situation
what are you doing?

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:29.586
The Philly fan now is betting
on the whole World Series even

00:09:29.586 --> 00:09:32.450
though you know the odds are
60/40.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.046
So now that's an even worse bet
by the Philly fan if you're

00:09:35.046 --> 00:09:37.912
right about the odds because the
chances are even higher that the

00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:40.330
Yankees are going to win the
series than one game.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.830
The odds, we know,
are 71 percent.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.803
So by backward induction we did
this calculation to say your

00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:48.960
expected payoff is 42 dollars.
 

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.263
So let's suppose now--but now
the key is that you're making

00:09:52.263 --> 00:09:55.678
money not just because you know
better what the odds are,

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:59.559
you're making money because
there's another bookie standing

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:03.908
there always ready to trade with
you at 60/40 odds in any game.

00:10:03.908 --> 00:10:07.761
So the presence of the second
bookie, even if you knew

00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:11.541
nothing, would enable you to
make money in this case,

00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:14.740
lock in a profit for sure of 42
dollars.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.369
Now, how do you know that you
can lock in a profit for sure of

00:10:17.369 --> 00:10:17.928
42 dollars?
 

00:10:17.928 --> 00:10:22.450
Well, it's now done by dynamic
hedging.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.990
You have to lay off part of
your bet,

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.916
a little part each day,
each game and the amount that

00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:32.730
you lay off is going to depend
on what happens,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.799
so that's why it's dynamic.
 

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.558
It's a complicated calculation.
 

00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:38.679
So it seems almost hopeless to
figure out what to do.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.700
I'm betting on the whole series.
 

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.178
Many different things can
happen.

00:10:43.178 --> 00:10:45.009
The Phillies could win the
first game.

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:46.200
The Yankees could win the first
game.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.840
Lots of things could happen.
 

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.559
By the end I want to make sure
I've locked in my profit for

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:52.009
sure.
 

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:53.538
How can I do that?
 

00:10:53.538 --> 00:11:00.450
Well, the key is to think about
marking to market.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.120
Just as we said,
if you're assessing your

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.686
position correctly,
even though the World Series

00:11:07.686 --> 00:11:11.101
takes 7 games,
if you were reporting to your

00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:13.129
investors,
your hedge fund,

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:16.440
you're reporting to your
investors how you're doing,

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.928
you should be telling them
after the first game,

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.528
you know, at the beginning
you're telling them,

00:11:20.528 --> 00:11:22.028
"Look, I'm going to make
42 dollars.

00:11:22.028 --> 00:11:23.490
I expect to make 42
dollars."

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.360
After the Yankees win the first
game it looks like you're going

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.116
to make 60,
you know, now things are

00:11:28.116 --> 00:11:30.470
better, you expect to make 64
dollars on average,

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.895
but if the Yankees lost the
first game you'd only expect to

00:11:33.895 --> 00:11:35.548
make 9 dollars on average.
 

00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:39.168
So after the first game you go
from thinking you're going to

00:11:39.168 --> 00:11:41.928
make 42 to being even more
optimistic now,

00:11:41.928 --> 00:11:45.808
you're going to make 64 or
you're going to make 9.

00:11:45.808 --> 00:11:51.230
So 60 percent times 64 40
percent of 9 is 42.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:55.155
So if you were telling your
investors properly how you stood

00:11:55.155 --> 00:11:59.081
after the very first game you
might have to tell them you've

00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.009
lost 33 of the 42 dollars that
you told them before you were

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:04.340
going to make.
 

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.230
So you'd already be running a
risk.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.076
You really only care,
maybe, about getting money for

00:12:11.076 --> 00:12:13.770
sure by the end,
but if you're doing proper

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.878
accounting you should be worried
all the way along whether you're

00:12:16.878 --> 00:12:18.139
making or losing money.
 

00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:23.028
And that's the key to how to
have no risk by the end.

00:12:23.028 --> 00:12:25.658
You just run no risk at all the
in between stages.

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:29.592
So all you have to do is make a
bet with the bookie who's

00:12:29.592 --> 00:12:33.666
standing by to make 33 dollars
in case the Phillies win the

00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:34.720
first game.
 

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.453
You're making a one game bet in
exchange for losing 22 dollars

00:12:38.453 --> 00:12:39.740
if the Yankees win.
 

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.719
This is still 3 to 2 odds,
so the bookie's willing to do

00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:42.990
it.
 

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.929
So the night before the first
game you've bet with the Philly

00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:50.855
fan on the entire series,
which is giving you a huge

00:12:50.855 --> 00:12:53.557
advantage,
but you're willing to bet with

00:12:53.557 --> 00:12:54.600
the other bookie.
 

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.347
The other bookie,
we're assuming,

00:12:56.347 --> 00:12:58.259
is only standing by game by
game.

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:01.038
You're betting 33 to 22 on the
Phillies.

00:13:01.038 --> 00:13:03.028
You're betting on the team you
expect to lose.

00:13:03.028 --> 00:13:05.504
You're betting on that team
with the other bookie,

00:13:05.504 --> 00:13:06.918
but in a smaller quantity.
 

00:13:06.918 --> 00:13:11.995
So this is going to mean that
your profit after the first

00:13:11.995 --> 00:13:17.070
game, no matter what happens,
is still going to be 42.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.519
So you can lock in 42 after
every game.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:25.674
And so as I said last time the
crucial thing is--so then one

00:13:25.674 --> 00:13:27.509
thing I didn't say.
 

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:29.875
So one thing which I forgot to
observe last time,

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.734
which I think is interesting,
is so is that what you should

00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:33.080
do?
 

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.368
Should you do that after every
game, always bet 33 to 22

00:13:37.368 --> 00:13:40.799
against the Yankees with the
other bookie?

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:42.908
Well, the answer is no.
 

00:13:42.908 --> 00:13:46.538
What should you do if the
Yankees win the first game?

00:13:46.538 --> 00:13:50.980
By winning the first game your
expectation goes up to 64.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.057
Now it could be either 82--and
the night after the first game

00:13:56.057 --> 00:13:59.950
you're much better off than you
were before.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.418
Of course you laid off part of
the bet with the other bookie,

00:14:02.418 --> 00:14:06.240
so you've had to pay off 22 so
you're still only 42 ahead,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.908
but the Yankees have now won
the first game.

00:14:08.908 --> 00:14:12.133
So it's now the night after the
first game, before the second

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:12.509
game.
 

00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:14.610
You're subject to more risk.
 

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.428
What should you do now?
 

00:14:17.428 --> 00:14:20.649
You should go back to the
bookie and make another bet on

00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:23.344
the second game,
but should the other bet be 22

00:14:23.344 --> 00:14:23.928
to 33?
 

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:30.493
Absolutely not,
because 64 up here goes to

00:14:30.493 --> 00:14:38.017
whatever that number is,
which I forgot already,

00:14:38.017 --> 00:14:43.620
82 and 1 half to 36 and 1 half.
 

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.620
So what should you do?
 

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:55.590
 
 

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.720
What should you do now?
 

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.948
So I've done some rounding here
which is going to screw

00:14:58.948 --> 00:15:01.138
everything up a little bit,
but now what should you do

00:15:01.138 --> 00:15:01.509
here?
 

00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:03.389
After the first game you're
here.

00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:08.408
Here you are after the first
game.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:12.480
You've made your bet with the
bookie.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.250
The first game you bet 33
against 22.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.830
Now what should you do the
second game?

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:24.259
What should your bet be with
that bookie?

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:27.634
He's still willing to give you
3 to 2 odds on the Yankees

00:15:27.634 --> 00:15:28.779
either direction.
 

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:34.788
What should you do?
 

00:15:34.788 --> 00:15:37.029
You're not going to bet (33,22)
again.

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:38.998
You're going to make a
different bet,

00:15:38.998 --> 00:15:40.309
and what should it be?
 

00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:41.190
Yes?
 

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.529
Student:
&gt;

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:44.700
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:51.767
You should give up 18 if
Yankees win and get 27 rounding

00:15:51.767 --> 00:15:52.408
up.
 

00:15:52.408 --> 00:15:55.634
She conveniently rounded a
little bit because I had rounded

00:15:55.634 --> 00:15:56.470
a little bit.
 

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.808
So you should do 18 and 27.
 

00:15:58.808 --> 00:16:01.288
Now notice that's still 3 to 2
odds.

00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:06.027
So the bookie's still willing
to do that for you and you're

00:16:06.027 --> 00:16:10.193
locking in the 64 because it's
going to be 64 again,

00:16:10.193 --> 00:16:13.379
and adding this is 64 again,
right?

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:15.590
So you've locked in whatever
this number is.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.899
So in the first step you made a
bet to lock this number in.

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:22.178
In the second step you made a
bet to lock this number in.

00:16:22.178 --> 00:16:26.220
You're always locking in where
you were before.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.210
So that bet is changing each
time,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.038
but you're always locking in
what you were before,

00:16:30.038 --> 00:16:34.351
because after the Yankees have
won a game now the next game is

00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:36.120
not quite as important.
 

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.958
Time is running out on the
Phillies so it's not as

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:44.269
revealing the next game about
what's going to happen.

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:52.750
So you make a smaller bet up
here than you did before.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.759
So why is that locking
everything in?

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:58.515
Because this average is now 64,
what it was here,

00:16:58.515 --> 00:17:02.250
but don't forget you'd already
made the initial bet to lose 22.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.135
So you've locked in 44 now here
and also 44 here because you

00:17:06.135 --> 00:17:08.640
still owe the 22 from the first
bet.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.352
So you just keep proceeding
down the tree locking in where

00:17:12.352 --> 00:17:16.130
you were before and so by
induction you've locked in 42.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.015
So that's what you're doing,
and the bet is changing every

00:17:19.015 --> 00:17:19.368
time.
 

00:17:19.368 --> 00:17:21.730
So what do you think the bet is
here, by the way?

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:32.180
The bet here you could go from
9 to 36 or minus 32.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:41.720
So what should you do here?
 

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.348
What should you do here?
 

00:17:45.348 --> 00:17:49.048
What's the bet that you're
going to make with the bookie

00:17:49.048 --> 00:17:51.740
after the Phillies win the first
game?

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:57.787
So it's going to be minus 27
and plus 41, and that's 3 to 2

00:17:57.787 --> 00:18:03.522
odds with some rounding,
right, 13 and 1 half times 3 is

00:18:03.522 --> 00:18:05.400
40 and 1 half.
 

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.001
So it's still fair odds,
so the bookie's willing to do

00:18:10.001 --> 00:18:10.609
that.
 

00:18:10.609 --> 00:18:11.660
You've locked in 9.
 

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.096
So by induction you've always
locked in where you were before

00:18:15.096 --> 00:18:18.190
and therefore you've locked in
42 all the way along.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.440
It sounds like we're locking in
9,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.102
but we're not locking in 9
because remember the first day

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.905
you won 33 dollars from the
bookie when the Phillies won the

00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:26.618
first game.
 

00:18:26.618 --> 00:18:29.455
So you've locked in the 9,
but don't forget the 33 from

00:18:29.455 --> 00:18:31.819
before, so it's really you've
locked in 42.

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:34.119
So 42's locked in the whole way.
 

00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:36.630
So that's dynamic hedging.
 

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:41.823
You have a complicated bet that
depends on a lot of things along

00:18:41.823 --> 00:18:45.049
the way,
but you bet each time along the

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:46.906
way,
maybe changing your bet each

00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:49.068
time depending on what's
happened so far,

00:18:49.068 --> 00:18:52.400
and that way you can lock in
whatever profit you had.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.906
So that's the thing that sports
bookies have known for a long

00:18:57.906 --> 00:18:58.548
time.
 

00:18:58.548 --> 00:19:01.826
The expression "hedging
your bets"

00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:06.320
comes from that and so that
same logic can be applied to the

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.160
market.
 

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.025
But remember,
the step that I didn't

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:14.772
emphasize very much is that
although you seem to be locking

00:19:14.772 --> 00:19:18.548
in where you were before,
there's a slightly more

00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:22.732
abstract way of saying that,
that at the end you're going to

00:19:22.732 --> 00:19:24.720
get 42 dollars for sure.
 

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.144
So of course you could borrow
all the way back from the

00:19:28.144 --> 00:19:31.824
beginning and get 42 dollars
immediately and then never owe

00:19:31.824 --> 00:19:35.400
anything in the future,
because whatever bet you were

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.815
winning or losing with the
Philly fan you were making up

00:19:38.815 --> 00:19:41.608
for with your myriad bets with
the bookie.

00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:45.786
So it's a replication argument
that by betting sequentially

00:19:45.786 --> 00:19:48.450
with the bookie different
amounts,

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:55.690
you're undoing the single long
bet you had with the Philly fan.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:01.864
So now let's move from sports,
as we did last time,

00:20:01.864 --> 00:20:03.838
to the market.
 

00:20:03.838 --> 00:20:06.588
So here we had the prepayment
spreadsheet.

00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:12.170
And so we had,
remember, this was a bond,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.558
a mortgage, a 30-year mortgage,
8 percent mortgage,

00:20:15.558 --> 00:20:21.585
and the interest rate started
off at 6 percent and it had a 20

00:20:21.585 --> 00:20:23.660
percent volatility.
 

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.039
So the interest rates could
follow this process.

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:27.028
There you see it.
 

00:20:27.028 --> 00:20:30.061
They start at 6 percent,
but they can go up or down by

00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:32.180
20 percent, basically every
period.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.998
So you assume that everybody
knows this and knows that the

00:20:35.998 --> 00:20:37.740
probabilities are 50/50.
 

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.220
That's like saying you know in
advance there's a bookie out

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.819
there,
that is the market,

00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:46.089
that's willing to give you,
no matter what day it is,

00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:50.250
50/50 odds of the interest rate
going up or down from then on.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.828
That's just like the bookie
standing by.

00:20:53.828 --> 00:20:59.484
You now are going to take
advantage of the fact that you

00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:05.553
can anticipate that the market
will stand there ready to bet

00:21:05.553 --> 00:21:06.890
with you.
 

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.843
Now, if the whole market
freezes or something you can be

00:21:09.843 --> 00:21:10.808
totally screwed.
 

00:21:10.808 --> 00:21:15.769
You're doing your complicated
dynamic betting with the market,

00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:18.182
one day you wake up and you
can't bet anymore because

00:21:18.182 --> 00:21:20.500
nobody's willing to trade,
something horrible has

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.618
happened, 9/11 happened or
something like that.

00:21:22.618 --> 00:21:25.906
You can be caught in a really
bad situation and end up running

00:21:25.906 --> 00:21:26.769
a lot of risk.
 

00:21:26.769 --> 00:21:31.340
So you're relying on the
market, so it's not surprising

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:36.250
that when the market freezes up
lots of people suddenly are

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.230
exposed to more risk than they
were before.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.086
So now in the market you're not
going to be able to find these

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:43.930
pure arbitrages.
 

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.828
In the sports example it was a
pure arbitrage.

00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:50.315
There was a Philly fan who is
betting at even odds and a

00:21:50.315 --> 00:21:52.848
bookie who was betting at 3 to 2
odds.

00:21:52.848 --> 00:21:55.230
Now, you shouldn't expect that
to happen.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.165
I mean, by what miracle did
this fan come to you instead of

00:21:59.165 --> 00:22:00.660
to the other bookie?
 

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.618
Why do you deserve to meet this
fan and take advantage of him?

00:22:04.618 --> 00:22:07.240
What have you got that no other
bookie has?

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.601
It's a miracle he came to you
and not to one of the other

00:22:09.601 --> 00:22:10.358
hundred bookies.
 

00:22:10.358 --> 00:22:13.835
Well, it's probably because you
actually know something that the

00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:16.759
other bookies don't that you can
take advantage of.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:21.433
So in the background here
there's another thing that you

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:22.028
knew.
 

00:22:22.028 --> 00:22:25.019
You knew the fan was going to
pay off if he lost.

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:28.087
Maybe the other bookies weren't
willing to bet with him because

00:22:28.087 --> 00:22:30.808
they didn't think he was going
to pay off if he lost.

00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:33.915
So that's the extra thing that
you knew, you knew that he was

00:22:33.915 --> 00:22:34.900
going to pay off.
 

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.769
Now it makes sense that he came
to you and not to the other

00:22:37.769 --> 00:22:40.838
bookies because you actually
knew something that they don't.

00:22:40.838 --> 00:22:44.759
And so that's how it really
works in the market.

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:47.765
You're relying on some piece of
information you have that they

00:22:47.765 --> 00:22:48.160
don't.
 

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.163
Of course you could be wrong
about that information and then

00:22:50.163 --> 00:22:51.250
you get into a lot of trouble.
 

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.944
So here in this mortgage what's
the thing that you're relying

00:22:53.944 --> 00:22:54.170
on?
 

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:59.500
I'm assuming that the rest of
the market is standing by ready,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.412
as I said, to trade,
to make interest rate bets with

00:23:03.412 --> 00:23:05.114
you,
with everybody,

00:23:05.114 --> 00:23:09.306
at even odds whether the
interest rate's going to go up

00:23:09.306 --> 00:23:10.160
or down.
 

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.682
So no matter where you find
yourself in the future,

00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:15.558
like here, someone is willing
to bet at 50/50 odds that it

00:23:15.558 --> 00:23:16.720
will go up or down.
 

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.982
Now, this is a year-long bet so
you're going to have to take

00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:20.250
into account the interest rate.
 

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.680
It's not just going to be 50/50.
 

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.866
You have to discount all the
cash flows by the interest rate,

00:23:25.866 --> 00:23:29.319
but it's basically a 50/50 bet
discounted by the interest rate.

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:33.640
So now what's new here?
 

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.038
Well, you don't know what the
cash flows are.

00:23:36.038 --> 00:23:39.308
So here's the extra piece of
information you're adding.

00:23:39.308 --> 00:23:43.968
You know that the mortgage
homeowner is rational and is

00:23:43.968 --> 00:23:46.470
going to prepay rationally.
 

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.548
So you know what these cash
flows are.

00:23:48.548 --> 00:23:51.132
Some of the time the mortgage
homeowner is going to pay the 8

00:23:51.132 --> 00:23:53.112
dollars he owes,
some of the time he's just

00:23:53.112 --> 00:23:55.832
going to pay 8 dollars,
in fact, here is what you know

00:23:55.832 --> 00:23:56.900
is going to happen.
 

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.298
Down here where the 1s are he's
going to pay his coupon of 8,

00:24:00.298 --> 00:24:03.640
pay off the remaining principal
and that's the end of it.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.423
So in fact the very first day
if interest rates went down the

00:24:07.423 --> 00:24:11.019
rational thing to do is to pay
off the entire mortgage.

00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:13.038
So you know that's going to
happen.

00:24:13.038 --> 00:24:15.509
Now, that's the extra
information you have.

00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:18.038
You know what the cash flows
are.

00:24:18.038 --> 00:24:21.505
If other people knew those cash
flows they would figure out the

00:24:21.505 --> 00:24:23.069
price of the mortgage too.
 

00:24:23.069 --> 00:24:24.298
It's just they don't know those.
 

00:24:24.298 --> 00:24:29.101
You know the cash flows and you
can now figure out that the

00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:30.838
price better be 98.
 

00:24:30.838 --> 00:24:35.048
Why--if there's someone else
willing to trade with you to buy

00:24:35.048 --> 00:24:39.328
that mortgage for more than 98,
like why might that happen?

00:24:39.328 --> 00:24:42.759
Because someone else might have
the erroneous opinion that the

00:24:42.759 --> 00:24:45.118
homeowner will never call the
mortgage,

00:24:45.118 --> 00:24:47.810
will never prepay because he's
just going to be asleep all the

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.118
time.
 

00:24:48.118 --> 00:24:52.298
So let's say the homeowner's a
she.

00:24:52.298 --> 00:24:54.680
Let's say the homeowners are
all shes.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.078
This other trader thinks
they're all asleep and will

00:24:58.078 --> 00:24:59.078
never prepay.
 

00:24:59.078 --> 00:25:02.671
You know that these homeowners
are all incredibly alert and on

00:25:02.671 --> 00:25:05.320
top of things,
and so they're going to prepay,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.970
and the value's only 98.
 

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.836
So because of that extra
information you know the actual

00:25:10.836 --> 00:25:11.750
cash flows.
 

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.240
Sorry, we're here.
 

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.420
You know the cash flows.
 

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.390
You know how to value the bond,
and you know it's worth 98.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.011
So, and let's say the other
guy's willing to pay you 120 for

00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:22.319
it.
 

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:23.920
So you can sell it short.
 

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.538
You can sell it to the guy
short for 120.

00:25:27.538 --> 00:25:30.578
That means you owe whatever
cash flows the mortgage pays,

00:25:30.578 --> 00:25:33.240
and you know what it's going to
pay down there.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.650
So how can you lock in your
profit?

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.769
Well, because with 98 dollars
at the very beginning you can

00:25:40.769 --> 00:25:42.828
replicate those cash flows.
 

00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:46.119
You can go out into the market
and buy those cash flows,

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:49.769
the very cash flows you know
the mortgage is going to make.

00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:50.880
How can you do that?
 

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.630
Well, because at the first
step--remember what this says.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.130
The first step the price is 98.
 

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.920
The interest rate could go up
or down.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.980
If the interest rate goes up
the payment is 8.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.288
That's the coupon plus 92
something;

00:26:07.288 --> 00:26:14.210
92.6, and if it goes down the
payment is 8.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.309
So what is this?
 

00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:16.848
The payment is actually 8.
 

00:26:16.848 --> 00:26:18.630
That's the cash flow that has
to be made.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.948
The mortgage wasn't called here
at the beginning so no matter

00:26:21.948 --> 00:26:23.496
what she does,
the homeowner,

00:26:23.496 --> 00:26:24.990
she's got to pay the 8.
 

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.680
So you know you're going to owe
the guy 8 the first period.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.250
Now, down here she's actually
going to prepay.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.798
So she's actually going to pay
the guy the whole 99.1.

00:26:34.798 --> 00:26:37.259
Up here she's not going to
prepay.

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:38.920
She's going to hang onto the
mortgage.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.170
So what is this 92.6?
 

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.458
This is the present value,
assuming those cash flows,

00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:46.038
of her future payments.
 

00:26:46.038 --> 00:26:51.190
So if you get 98 dollars you
know that 1 half times this--

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:55.074
this by the way,
is 102.6, so 1 half times this

00:26:55.074 --> 00:27:01.286
divided by 1.06 plus this thing,
remember is 107.11 divided by

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:03.420
1.06 times 1 half.
 

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.440
That's how we got the number
98,98.8 whatever it was.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.548
That's how you calculated 98.8
by backward induction.

00:27:11.548 --> 00:27:15.733
You took this value times 1
half discounted plus this value

00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:17.609
times 1 half discounted.
 

00:27:17.609 --> 00:27:19.650
That's how you got 98.8.
 

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.125
So therefore,
if people are willing to trade

00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:24.830
at these prices,
in other words what's the price

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.348
here?
 

00:27:25.348 --> 00:27:31.170
It's 1 half times 1 over 1.06
and this is 1 half times 1 over

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:31.848
1.06.
 

00:27:31.848 --> 00:27:36.420
You can buy 1 dollar here at a
cost of 1 half times 1.06.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:41.420
You can buy 1 dollar here at a
cost of 1 half divided by 1.06.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.788
Paying this amount at the
beginning will buy you 1 dollar

00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:45.210
here.
 

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.921
Paying this amount at the
beginning will buy you 1 dollar

00:27:47.921 --> 00:27:48.259
here.
 

00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:55.301
So by paying this amount you
can get this payoff,

00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:59.410
102.6,100.6,
sorry, 100.6.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:04.457
You can get this 100.6 and you
can get 107.11 because precisely

00:28:04.457 --> 00:28:09.750
this is the cost that you have
to pay for each dollar up here,

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.788
and this is the cost that you
have to pay here for each dollar

00:28:14.788 --> 00:28:15.779
down here.
 

00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:16.519
Why is that?
 

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:19.829
Because we said the market is
standing by recognizing that

00:28:19.829 --> 00:28:22.558
these are 50/50 odds that it has
to discount.

00:28:22.558 --> 00:28:26.078
So that means the whole market
is willing to trade you,

00:28:26.078 --> 00:28:29.923
will be willing to promise you
1 dollar here in exchange for

00:28:29.923 --> 00:28:32.009
this amount of dollars here.
 

00:28:32.009 --> 00:28:35.063
It'll be willing to promise you
1 dollar here in exchange for

00:28:35.063 --> 00:28:36.588
this amount of dollars here.
 

00:28:36.588 --> 00:28:41.353
So with this amount of dollars
you can buy 8 dollars and have

00:28:41.353 --> 00:28:46.037
92.6 leftover and you can also
buy 8 dollars here with 99.11

00:28:46.037 --> 00:28:47.068
leftover.
 

00:28:47.068 --> 00:28:50.038
So all this together is enough
to make the prepayment because

00:28:50.038 --> 00:28:51.920
you know she's going to prepay
here.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.798
That's what we found out.
 

00:28:52.798 --> 00:29:01.259
She's going to prepay at the
first step down.

00:29:01.259 --> 00:29:05.839
Oh, what the hell does this say?
 

00:29:05.839 --> 00:29:07.930
She's prepaying just as we said.
 

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.200
At the very first step she's
prepaying.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.420
The first interest rate down
she's going to prepay.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.258
So we know you're going to have
to come up with all this money,

00:29:15.258 --> 00:29:16.769
but you've bought it over here.
 

00:29:16.769 --> 00:29:17.789
It cost you this amount.
 

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:19.058
You bought all that.
 

00:29:19.058 --> 00:29:22.048
If things went up you'd have to
pay 8,

00:29:22.048 --> 00:29:24.726
which you've also bought,
but you've got 92.6 left over

00:29:24.726 --> 00:29:27.848
and that's going to be enough to
buy everything that comes after

00:29:27.848 --> 00:29:31.318
that because the next day you're
going to have to buy more stuff,

00:29:31.318 --> 00:29:33.470
and so you just keep buying
going forward.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.637
So with 98.8 dollars you can
buy all the future cash flows

00:29:36.637 --> 00:29:40.140
and you've sold the thing so you
can make all your payments that

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.474
you're obliged to by selling it
short and you received 120 to

00:29:43.474 --> 00:29:44.420
begin with.
 

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.160
So you locked in 21.2 dollars.
 

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.690
So that's the gist of the whole
thing.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.380
So I said it last time not very
well.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:58.105
I said it a little bit better
this time, still not

00:29:58.105 --> 00:30:02.430
brilliantly, but do you now get
it?

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:07.410
Someone ask me a question
perhaps?

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.170
Is it okay?
 

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.750
So I'll say the punch line
again.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:17.009
The punch line is that if you
can find a favorable--so here

00:30:17.009 --> 00:30:21.198
what was different about the
World Series and the mortgage

00:30:21.198 --> 00:30:22.078
example?
 

00:30:22.078 --> 00:30:26.034
In the World Series you took
advantage of the fact that there

00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:30.054
was a bookie and a Philly fan
willing to bet at different odds

00:30:30.054 --> 00:30:34.180
on the same thing,
and so even though the Philly

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.690
fan had a very complicated 7 day
bet,

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:43.058
and the other bookies were only
willing to make day by day bets,

00:30:43.058 --> 00:30:46.646
you could take advantage of
that disparity to lock in a

00:30:46.646 --> 00:30:50.018
profit for sure,
and that's what you should try

00:30:50.018 --> 00:30:50.509
to do.
 

00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:54.808
In the market you're probably
relying on something else.

00:30:54.808 --> 00:30:59.152
You're relying on the fact that
you know more about the cash

00:30:59.152 --> 00:31:02.170
flows than the rest of the
traders do,

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.769
the rest of the market does,
maybe because you understand

00:31:04.769 --> 00:31:06.348
prepayments better than they do.
 

00:31:06.348 --> 00:31:10.445
And so that's why I said it was
so important to model

00:31:10.445 --> 00:31:11.548
prepayments.
 

00:31:11.548 --> 00:31:14.190
So let's say you understand
prepayments better than they do

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.058
so you know what the cash flows
are going to be much better than

00:31:17.058 --> 00:31:17.970
the market does.
 

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:23.490
You can take advantage of that.
 

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.538
You need now this advantage.
 

00:31:25.538 --> 00:31:27.854
Just like in the World Series
you might have needed the

00:31:27.854 --> 00:31:30.554
advantage of knowing the Philly
fan would actually pay off if he

00:31:30.554 --> 00:31:30.940
lost.
 

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.118
So there's that advantage that
you have,

00:31:33.118 --> 00:31:36.453
and now you have to rely on the
fact that the market or the

00:31:36.453 --> 00:31:39.313
bookie from then on day by day,
year by year,

00:31:39.313 --> 00:31:42.717
is willing to make bets at
these odds that you can

00:31:42.717 --> 00:31:43.690
anticipate.
 

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.589
And so using that you can trade
over and over again with the

00:31:47.589 --> 00:31:51.027
rest of the market and
dynamically replicate what the

00:31:51.027 --> 00:31:54.730
payments you have to make by
selling the bond short.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.258
So therefore you've locked in
your profit because you can

00:31:57.258 --> 00:31:59.626
anticipate--
assuming the market stays there

00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:03.046
willing to trade at even odds
you'll always be able to produce

00:32:03.046 --> 00:32:06.017
the cash flows with the 98
dollars you started with to

00:32:06.017 --> 00:32:09.324
exactly meet all your payment
obligations you've incurred by

00:32:09.324 --> 00:32:11.230
selling the mortgage short.
 

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.913
And since you sold it at the
beginning for $120 you've made

00:32:13.913 --> 00:32:16.970
21 dollars at the beginning and
you'll never need those dollars.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.390
You just put them in your
pocket.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:25.354
So that's how to dynamically
hedge a winning position to

00:32:25.354 --> 00:32:29.278
eliminate the chance of loss.
 

00:32:29.278 --> 00:32:31.630
Of course you still bear a
chance of loss.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.144
If you're wrong about the
prepayments you're going to lose

00:32:35.144 --> 00:32:37.098
money,
and if the rest of the market

00:32:37.098 --> 00:32:39.994
suddenly stops being there to
make these year by year bets on

00:32:39.994 --> 00:32:42.602
which way interest rates are
going to go you'll also be

00:32:42.602 --> 00:32:44.048
subject to a lot of risk.
 

00:32:44.048 --> 00:32:45.598
So you're relying on those two
things,

00:32:45.598 --> 00:32:48.472
the whole market not collapsing
and your being right about

00:32:48.472 --> 00:32:50.931
prepayments,
but conditional on those two

00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:53.118
facts you've locked in your
profit.

00:32:53.118 --> 00:32:56.686
So you got rid of a bunch of
risk, the blind luck of (100,

00:32:56.686 --> 00:33:00.130
minus 100) from the roll of the
dice of the Phillies.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.442
You got rid of that luck,
but you still had to count on

00:33:03.442 --> 00:33:06.509
the bookie being there day after
day after day,

00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:10.039
and in the mortgage case on the
fact that you knew how to

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:11.680
predict the prepayments.
 

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.868
Yes?
 

00:33:12.868 --> 00:33:14.460
Student: So in the first
example,

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.930
what's the point of betting the
second time since the maximum

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.068
amount of money we can make is
42,

00:33:20.068 --> 00:33:22.180
and we already made it in first
bet,

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.778
so why should I come to you
betting?

00:33:24.778 --> 00:33:27.720
Prof: I never made 42 on
the first bet.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.380
Here at the beginning nothing's
happened yet.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.259
The series hasn't been played
yet.

00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:35.163
So I say to myself I've made
this 100-dollar bet with the

00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:38.068
Philly fan for the whole series
on who's going to win the

00:33:38.068 --> 00:33:38.640
series.
 

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.578
That's going to happen 7 days
later.

00:33:41.578 --> 00:33:45.078
So right now I can anticipate,
on average I'll make 42

00:33:45.078 --> 00:33:45.740
dollars.
 

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.210
Some of the time I'll lose 100.
 

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.323
Some of the time I'll win 100,
but on average I'll come out 42

00:33:50.323 --> 00:33:51.140
dollars ahead.
 

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.382
So I've done a smart thing
betting with the naive Philly

00:33:54.382 --> 00:33:56.799
fan, but I'm still potentially
screwed.

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:58.759
I could still lose 100 dollars.
 

00:33:58.759 --> 00:34:01.288
I'll still have to face my
investors and tell them I've

00:34:01.288 --> 00:34:02.318
lost all your money.
 

00:34:02.318 --> 00:34:06.964
They're going to close me down,
and so I don't want to run that

00:34:06.964 --> 00:34:07.490
risk.
 

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.637
They don't want me to run that
risk and I don't want to run the

00:34:09.637 --> 00:34:09.880
risk.
 

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.190
I still want to take advantage
of the Philly fans.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:16.844
So what I do is every game I
make another bet against my

00:34:16.844 --> 00:34:18.030
inclination.
 

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:20.539
I bet not on the Phillies,
I bet, I mean,

00:34:20.539 --> 00:34:22.230
not on the Yankees who I think
they're going to win,

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.286
I'm betting on the Phillies
because I'm undoing part of the

00:34:25.286 --> 00:34:27.079
gamble that I did with this guy.
 

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:30.550
I'm hedging that gamble,
but by doing that in a clever

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.110
way,
changing how much money I bet

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.742
each game--
so the night before the first

00:34:35.742 --> 00:34:39.449
game I bet 33 dollars to 22
dollars on the Phillies winning.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:43.443
After the Yankees win the first
game I bet 27 dollars to 18

00:34:43.443 --> 00:34:46.199
dollars again on the Phillies
winning.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:50.480
So I decrease my bet going up,
I increase it going down.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.487
So by doing these clever game
by game bets I lock in 42

00:34:55.487 --> 00:34:57.250
dollars for sure.
 

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.039
Yes?
 

00:34:58.039 --> 00:35:01.161
Student: Do you actually
lock in for sure because say at

00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:03.579
the end of the last round you
don't actually--

00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:05.690
like that node is going to be
the end, right?

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.563
You don't actually have two
branches coming out of it,

00:35:08.563 --> 00:35:09.918
&gt;
 

00:35:09.918 --> 00:35:12.630
favorable outcome and
&gt;

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:15.170
Prof: So you have locked
it in.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:16.440
So how could that be?
 

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.641
So it's a good question,
but you've overlooked

00:35:18.641 --> 00:35:19.230
something.
 

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:23.510
So her question is the game's
going to end after 7 days.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:26.090
What if I ended with the minus
100?

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.309
The Phillies won all four games.
 

00:35:28.309 --> 00:35:30.969
Doesn't it look like I've lost?
 

00:35:30.969 --> 00:35:36.389
So why didn't I lose?
 

00:35:36.389 --> 00:35:38.699
I bet 100 dollars with the
original Phillies fan.

00:35:38.699 --> 00:35:40.110
I bet 100 dollars on the
Yankees.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:43.940
If the Phillies win all first
four games I've got to give the

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.090
guy 100 dollars.
 

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.956
Of course I made these side
bets with all these bookies on

00:35:47.956 --> 00:35:48.460
the way.
 

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.268
So what were the side bets?
 

00:35:51.268 --> 00:35:52.514
Student: Sorry.
 

00:35:52.514 --> 00:35:55.119
My question is the only nodes
that are secured,

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:57.724
that are locked in,
are nodes with two branches

00:35:57.724 --> 00:35:58.969
coming out of it.
 

00:35:58.969 --> 00:36:01.568
There's going to be an end
where there's no more branches

00:36:01.568 --> 00:36:04.030
coming out of the node and so
what's the situation?

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.976
Prof: The situation is
you're up 42 dollars,

00:36:05.976 --> 00:36:07.730
but we're trying to understand
why that is.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.809
That's your question, right?
 

00:36:09.809 --> 00:36:13.931
So you're going to be able to
answer the question although you

00:36:13.931 --> 00:36:15.349
don't think so yet.
 

00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:16.789
So what happened the first time?
 

00:36:16.789 --> 00:36:20.889
The first time the Phillies
won, that bet with the original

00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:23.010
Philly fan is looking worse.
 

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:26.639
I had 42 dollars I expected to
win.

00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:31.257
Now I only expect to win 9
dollars because the series is

00:36:31.257 --> 00:36:34.952
turning against me,
but the bookie paid me 33

00:36:34.952 --> 00:36:35.960
dollars.
 

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.539
So I'm--33 dollars already in
my pocket.

00:36:38.539 --> 00:36:39.510
This is 9.
 

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:44.654
Now let's say I got to the end
to the last game where this was

00:36:44.654 --> 00:36:45.159
a 0.
 

00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:48.219
Let's say this was the last
game where I've lost.

00:36:48.219 --> 00:36:49.860
Well, this is minus 32.
 

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.059
Let's say this is the last game.
 

00:36:52.059 --> 00:36:54.119
I lose 32 dollars here.
 

00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:58.567
Let's say it was only a two
game series and I give up 32

00:36:58.567 --> 00:37:02.771
dollars in case the Phillies win
the first two games,

00:37:02.771 --> 00:37:03.579
right?
 

00:37:03.579 --> 00:37:05.949
So you're saying,
"I'm down 32 dollars.

00:37:05.949 --> 00:37:07.579
That's the last node.
 

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:09.989
How can I possibly be up
42?"

00:37:09.989 --> 00:37:11.920
Well, so what's the answer?
 

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.670
Student: Because I
hedged it with the bookies.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.260
Prof: What?
 

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.590
Student: Because I
hedged it with the bookies.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.284
Prof: Right,
because I bet on the first game

00:37:18.284 --> 00:37:20.550
and the first bookie gave me 33
dollars.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:24.945
Then the second game I'm going
to bet with the bookies and I'm

00:37:24.945 --> 00:37:27.179
going to bet minus 27 and 41.
 

00:37:27.179 --> 00:37:31.485
So although I now owe the
Philly fan 33 dollars here,

00:37:31.485 --> 00:37:35.956
I made 41 dollars with the
second bookie and 33 dollars

00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:38.110
with the first bookie.
 

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:43.739
That's 74 dollars and I pay 32
to the original Philly fan so

00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:46.219
I'm still up 42 dollars.
 

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:49.110
So it sounds like you have to
do a lot of arithmetic.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.539
You don't have to do any
arithmetic.

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:53.239
I knew I was going to end up 42
dollars up.

00:37:53.239 --> 00:37:53.980
How is that?
 

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.985
Because every bet I said let's
look at the number here wherever

00:37:57.985 --> 00:37:59.989
we are on the tree like here.
 

00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:03.865
At this node after all the
stuff that's happened before the

00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:08.010
bet I'm going to make with the
bookie that one game is going to

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.420
be enough to turn this random
thing into 64/64.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.688
So I always take what happens
further down the tree and turn

00:38:14.688 --> 00:38:17.789
it into what's happened at the
beginning of the tree,

00:38:17.789 --> 00:38:21.750
but then I work it all the way
back and it's 42.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.190
So that means,
see this thing was 64 and 9,

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:30.349
but I made a bet 22/33 with the
bookie to turn it into 42/42.

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:32.119
This thing was 64.
 

00:38:32.119 --> 00:38:37.226
I made a bet to turn this into
64/64, but with the 22 here

00:38:37.226 --> 00:38:38.750
that's also 42.
 

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:43.501
So no matter how far I go on
the tree I'm still exactly 42

00:38:43.501 --> 00:38:44.170
ahead.
 

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:45.239
Any other questions?
 

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.260
Yes?
 

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.335
Student: In the example
that we just did for the

00:38:50.335 --> 00:38:54.789
mortgage, could you explain why
we are gaining 8 dollars?

00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:58.108
I thought we'd be losing 8
dollars every branch.

00:38:58.108 --> 00:38:59.449
It's below the...
 

00:38:59.449 --> 00:39:02.420
Prof: Sorry,
what am I doing?

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:06.440
Student: In each branch
we've said that we're gaining 8

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.429
dollars 92.6.
 

00:39:07.429 --> 00:39:11.889
Aren't we doing negative 8 92.6?
 

00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:15.152
Prof: So her question is
in this case the mortgage--so

00:39:15.152 --> 00:39:18.360
now we're moving from the World
Series to more real life.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:22.456
In this case I know the cash
flows from this mortgage are

00:39:22.456 --> 00:39:24.666
worth 98.8,
but somebody else not

00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:27.719
understanding the homeowner and
how rational she is,

00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:31.190
someone else is willing to pay
me 120 for that mortgage.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:36.664
So I sell the mortgage for 120
and I take 21 dollars and put it

00:39:36.664 --> 00:39:37.989
in my pocket.
 

00:39:37.989 --> 00:39:41.110
Now I've got 98.8 dollars left.
 

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.949
So that's money now I have to
do something active with.

00:39:43.949 --> 00:39:45.510
What do I have to do?
 

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.820
I owe this guy a lot of
payments.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.097
Every time she,
let's say it's you,

00:39:50.097 --> 00:39:52.172
makes your payment,
her payment,

00:39:52.172 --> 00:39:55.119
in the market I've sold the
thing short.

00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:57.936
That means I owe--I've promised
to deliver whatever that

00:39:57.936 --> 00:39:58.960
mortgage delivers.
 

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.469
That's what it means to sell it
short.

00:40:00.469 --> 00:40:03.110
So I've got to deliver the 8
here, say.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:07.090
I've got to deliver the 8 here,
and here she's prepaying.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.800
I have to deliver the whole
107, right?

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.358
So with 98.8 dollars I can
afford to buy 100.6 dollars in

00:40:16.358 --> 00:40:20.130
this state and 107.11 in this
state.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.577
How do I know that,
because that's where the 98.8

00:40:22.577 --> 00:40:23.190
came from.
 

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:27.280
It said this total amount 100.6
times the price,

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.929
which is the odds of it
happening discounted,

00:40:29.929 --> 00:40:34.719
that's the price plus the
107.11 times its price,

00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:38.789
the odds it happens discounted,
is exactly 98.8.

00:40:38.789 --> 00:40:40.599
That's where I got 98.8.
 

00:40:40.599 --> 00:40:43.456
So therefore with 98.8 dollars,
remember the bookie's willing

00:40:43.456 --> 00:40:46.373
to go either way,
with 98.8 dollars I can buy all

00:40:46.373 --> 00:40:49.099
these cash flows and all these
cash flows.

00:40:49.099 --> 00:40:50.250
So what do I do?
 

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:56.291
With the 107.1 down here I pay
the 8, her coupon,

00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:59.690
and her 99.11 prepayment.
 

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:02.831
I pay it all to that guy I sold
the bond short to and I've kept

00:41:02.831 --> 00:41:03.489
my promise.
 

00:41:03.489 --> 00:41:04.969
That's the end of the mortgage.
 

00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:10.409
Up here the mortgage only
delivered 8 so I only owe him 8,

00:41:10.409 --> 00:41:13.559
but I've got another 92.6 left.
 

00:41:13.559 --> 00:41:15.550
Why is that exactly what I need?
 

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:18.967
Because from here on I have to
use that money to buy the future

00:41:18.967 --> 00:41:22.164
cash flows because she's going
to continue to pay her 8 and

00:41:22.164 --> 00:41:24.150
maybe eventually it will prepay.
 

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.099
But by induction,
by repeating this step over and

00:41:27.099 --> 00:41:30.788
over again I can always make the
payment and have the present

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:34.476
value left over to afford to buy
the future payments plus the

00:41:34.476 --> 00:41:36.320
present value left over.
 

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.170
So by induction I'm always
making the coupon.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:42.818
Like in this first step I make
the coupon payment plus I've got

00:41:42.818 --> 00:41:45.880
enough money left over to match
the present value.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.969
So that means as I go forward,
and forward,

00:41:47.969 --> 00:41:51.005
and forward I keep making the
payment and matching the present

00:41:51.005 --> 00:41:52.349
value that's left over.
 

00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:55.775
By the time I get to the 30th
year I've made the coupon

00:41:55.775 --> 00:41:56.409
payment.
 

00:41:56.409 --> 00:41:58.829
The present value left over is
0 because there isn't going to

00:41:58.829 --> 00:42:00.000
be any payments after that.
 

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.880
So I've made all the payments.
 

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.400
Student: Could you do
this one year ahead as well?

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.449
Prof: Yes, I could.
 

00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:12.664
So I was hoping you wouldn't
ask me that because it's--so

00:42:12.664 --> 00:42:15.829
what happens in the next period.
 

00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:19.719
So here we know that she didn't
pay.

00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:20.719
She didn't prepay.
 

00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:25.554
The present value is 92.6,
so we're here,

00:42:25.554 --> 00:42:26.400
92.6.
 

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.969
Now, she didn't pay.
 

00:42:27.969 --> 00:42:32.530
Let's look at what she's doing,
whether she's prepaying or not.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.829
So this is why I did the second
graph.

00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:39.434
So if the interest rates go up
the first time and then back

00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:42.530
down she's still not going to
prepay.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:52.389
So we can now go up and
see--oops.

00:42:52.389 --> 00:42:53.489
Here we are.
 

00:42:53.489 --> 00:42:56.500
So we can go up now and see
what's happening here.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.889
It's 92.65.
 

00:42:57.889 --> 00:43:14.099
You go up to 83.95 or down to
97.2.

00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:15.309
97.17.
 

00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:16.929
So what does that mean?
 

00:43:16.929 --> 00:43:22.431
So with 98.8 dollars I bought,
I'm the guy selling the thing

00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:28.400
short, you're the smart rational
pre-payer, so you paid 8 dollars

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.239
here.
 

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:32.077
That means because I've sold
the mortgage short and you've

00:43:32.077 --> 00:43:35.065
made that 8-dollar payment I owe
the guy the 8-dollar payment

00:43:35.065 --> 00:43:36.809
just as if he had the mortgage.
 

00:43:36.809 --> 00:43:38.809
So I've got to come up with the
8 dollars.

00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:41.197
Down here if things had moved
here you would have paid 8

00:43:41.197 --> 00:43:43.367
dollars plus the whole
prepayment so you would have

00:43:43.367 --> 00:43:44.280
paid 107 dollars.
 

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:50.719
But with 98.8 I can buy 8 92.6
up here and 8 99.11 down here.

00:43:50.719 --> 00:43:53.969
So I've bought all the cash
flows I need to down here.

00:43:53.969 --> 00:43:55.699
I hand them over to the guy and
I say,

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.769
"You see,
I kept my promise to deliver

00:43:57.769 --> 00:44:00.882
whatever that mortgage did,
and I knew that she was going

00:44:00.882 --> 00:44:03.186
to prepay,
I knew how smart she was and so

00:44:03.186 --> 00:44:04.340
I've kept my promise.
 

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.559
You didn't think she'd prepay.
 

00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:06.329
I knew it.
 

00:44:06.329 --> 00:44:08.050
I've kept my promise."
 

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:12.123
And then up here I've got the 8
dollars so I can make the

00:44:12.123 --> 00:44:13.579
payment, match it.
 

00:44:13.579 --> 00:44:16.715
I've got 92.6 left,
now I don't give it to the guy

00:44:16.715 --> 00:44:19.018
because the payment's only been
8.

00:44:19.018 --> 00:44:25.490
I take the 92.6 and with the
92.6 that happens to equal this

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:29.768
plus 8 times 1 half divided by
1.06,

00:44:29.768 --> 00:44:33.744
and it equals,
also, this plus 8 times 1 half

00:44:33.744 --> 00:44:35.369
divided by 1.06.
 

00:44:35.369 --> 00:44:38.942
Not by 1.06,
by the interest rate here which

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:43.512
happens to be--you have to
figure out what that interest

00:44:43.512 --> 00:44:45.340
rate was up there.
 

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:50.614
So the interest rate went up
to--it started at 6 percent and

00:44:50.614 --> 00:44:52.940
went up to 0732 percent.
 

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.869
So this is .0732.
 

00:44:57.869 --> 00:45:00.820
How did this number 92.6 get
calculated?

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.210
It was exactly take the payment
of 8,

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.250
take the present value of
what's left,

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:10.150
multiply by 1 half and discount
it at the interest rate here

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:15.050
plus 1 half times this payment
of 8 plus the value of what's

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:18.539
left discounted by that interest
rate.

00:45:18.539 --> 00:45:22.880
So this number 92.6 allows me
to buy this and to buy that.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.697
So therefore,
if things went up again I could

00:45:25.697 --> 00:45:29.606
make your 8-dollar payment that
you make to the bank I have to

00:45:29.606 --> 00:45:33.449
make to the other guy because I
sold the mortgage short.

00:45:33.449 --> 00:45:34.880
I've got the money to pay him.
 

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.730
I've also got the money to pay
him if things had gone down

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:38.630
again 8 dollars.
 

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:42.237
And I've got more cash in my
pocket, this and this in the two

00:45:42.237 --> 00:45:42.719
cases.
 

00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:46.422
With this money I can continue
to buy the future payments that

00:45:46.422 --> 00:45:47.820
you're going to make.
 

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:53.398
So I always have enough money
to make whatever payments it is

00:45:53.398 --> 00:45:56.840
that I have to,
to keep my promise.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.880
Yep?
 

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.202
Student: Is it sort of
preferable from your point of

00:46:02.202 --> 00:46:06.523
view that the interest rate go
up because your theory about

00:46:06.523 --> 00:46:10.250
prepayments isn't going to be
put to the test?

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.927
Prof: Well,
don't forget,

00:46:11.927 --> 00:46:14.469
I'm locking in my 21 dollar
profit for sure,

00:46:14.469 --> 00:46:17.923
so no matter what happens I'm
going to just be able to make

00:46:17.923 --> 00:46:19.949
all the payments no matter what.
 

00:46:19.949 --> 00:46:22.338
Student: But now it
seems that your theory about

00:46:22.338 --> 00:46:23.179
prepayments is...
 

00:46:23.179 --> 00:46:24.699
Prof: Correct, yes.
 

00:46:24.699 --> 00:46:28.500
Student: So it's like
ambiguity, right?

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:33.050
Not just the rest is like
ambiguity, so it's sort of

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.389
preferable...
 

00:46:34.389 --> 00:46:35.210
Prof: So good.
 

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.541
So let me repeat his question,
if he'll forgive me,

00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:38.940
in slightly different words.
 

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.945
He's saying that I was able to
take--this is what my hedge fund

00:46:42.945 --> 00:46:44.110
does, literally.
 

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.914
We think we know better what
the prepayments are going to be

00:46:46.914 --> 00:46:50.039
than the rest of the market,
so we're willing to take on a

00:46:50.039 --> 00:46:52.780
commitment--
someone will pay us 120 dollars.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:58.833
We think 98 dollars are enough
to buy all the promises that

00:46:58.833 --> 00:47:03.530
we've made by selling the thing
short, say.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:04.460
We could be wrong.
 

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.210
We have been wrong.
 

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.710
The last two years we made a
lot of mistakes.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.559
So you're saying,
the question is,

00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:15.876
the reason why the guy is
willing to pay so much is

00:47:15.876 --> 00:47:21.489
because down here he thinks he's
going to get a lot of money.

00:47:21.489 --> 00:47:24.454
The interest rates are going
down so, discounting at a lower

00:47:24.454 --> 00:47:27.119
rate, the mortgage is going to
be worth a lot more.

00:47:27.119 --> 00:47:29.672
We don't think it's going to be
more because we're expecting

00:47:29.672 --> 00:47:30.280
prepayments.
 

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.554
Up here it's sort of obvious
that there aren't going to be

00:47:33.554 --> 00:47:34.590
any prepayments.
 

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.838
So if the world really goes,
interest rates going up,

00:47:37.838 --> 00:47:41.585
then our theory of prepayments
never gets put to the test and

00:47:41.585 --> 00:47:43.210
so we just make money.
 

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.340
So our theory never gets put to
the test.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:50.047
If interest rates go down then
our theory's been really put to

00:47:50.047 --> 00:47:53.268
the test and we have to see
whether she's really smart

00:47:53.268 --> 00:47:54.969
enough to prepay or not.
 

00:47:54.969 --> 00:47:55.670
So you're right.
 

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:56.768
That's absolutely true, yep.
 

00:47:56.768 --> 00:48:00.061
But in any case we're going to
assume our theory is correct and

00:48:00.061 --> 00:48:03.090
hedge in such a way so that if
our theory is correct about

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:06.010
prepayments we will exactly be
in a position to keep our

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.719
promises without ever running a
risk of loss.

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:09.699
Yes?
 

00:48:09.699 --> 00:48:12.369
Student: So with the
World Series example.

00:48:12.369 --> 00:48:16.322
So let's say there are two
situations where the Phillies

00:48:16.322 --> 00:48:19.989
win in 4 games or they win the
series in 5 games.

00:48:19.989 --> 00:48:26.760
Either way you lose 100 dollars
and you win 4 single game bets,

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:31.117
but in one of the situations
you've lost one single game bet

00:48:31.117 --> 00:48:34.960
because the Phillies won in 5
games rather than 4.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.250
How do the values reconcile?
 

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:41.438
Prof: Because it
couldn't have happened that

00:48:41.438 --> 00:48:44.500
there were four straight wins
and then a loss.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.239
The series would have been
over, right?

00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:53.619
So his question is I've
asserted that no matter what way

00:48:53.619 --> 00:49:01.159
things go I'm going to end up 42
dollars ahead no matter what,

00:49:01.159 --> 00:49:04.496
and he's saying that's great,
but he's a little skeptical it

00:49:04.496 --> 00:49:07.777
could be true because I'm always
betting against this other

00:49:07.777 --> 00:49:08.400
bookie.
 

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.153
I'm always betting on the
Phillies with the other bookie,

00:49:13.153 --> 00:49:17.230
and so in one case the Yankees
win 4 in a row.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:21.358
I lose 4 bets with the other
bookie, with the bookie I'm

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:25.262
betting on the Phillies,
so I've had to take 4 losing

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.590
bets with the other bookie.
 

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:30.942
In the case where the Yankees
win three lose one and then win

00:49:30.942 --> 00:49:34.239
in the end I've again lost 4
bets with the other bookie,

00:49:34.239 --> 00:49:36.219
but I've actually won a bet
with the other bookie.

00:49:36.219 --> 00:49:39.539
So it seems like somehow things
are better for me,

00:49:39.539 --> 00:49:43.739
so it seems unbelievable that
I'm still at 42 in both cases.

00:49:43.739 --> 00:49:44.900
That's your question, right?
 

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:54.230
So the reason is that my bets
are changing.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.929
I don't make the same last bet.
 

00:49:57.929 --> 00:50:00.969
So the first three bets there's
a Yankee win,

00:50:00.969 --> 00:50:03.699
Yankee win, Yankee win,
each of those nights I'm making

00:50:03.699 --> 00:50:05.570
the same bet in the same
scenario,

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:10.746
but when the Phillies lose and
then win again I've changed my

00:50:10.746 --> 00:50:15.177
bet,
so I'm still going to end

00:50:15.177 --> 00:50:22.699
up--so the Yankees lost the,
your scenario was the Yankees

00:50:22.699 --> 00:50:26.655
lost the 4th game,
so that outcome is different

00:50:26.655 --> 00:50:30.871
from what it would have been in
the first scenario because the

00:50:30.871 --> 00:50:33.289
Yankees lost instead of winning.
 

00:50:33.289 --> 00:50:37.079
So the bookie bet went the
other way.

00:50:37.079 --> 00:50:41.563
But now the last bet I made is
not the same bet as I would have

00:50:41.563 --> 00:50:43.300
made the night before.
 

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.692
It's a different bet so that it
just ends up with a different

00:50:46.692 --> 00:50:50.141
direction than the 4th bet plus
this different 5th bet it adds

00:50:50.141 --> 00:50:53.422
back up to what would have
happened had the Yankees won the

00:50:53.422 --> 00:50:54.440
fourth time.
 

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.329
I don't know if that helps,
but that's what happens.

00:50:56.329 --> 00:51:00.719
And the proof that it happens
is just by induction.

00:51:00.719 --> 00:51:06.322
I gave a proof and you're
saying the proof is amazingly

00:51:06.322 --> 00:51:07.050
good.
 

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.659
Remember, the proof is very
simple.

00:51:08.659 --> 00:51:11.731
You always make a bet so that
no matter what happens your

00:51:11.731 --> 00:51:14.750
expectation is back to where it
was the night before.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.766
And if you do that you have to
end up--that's the proof that

00:51:17.766 --> 00:51:20.219
you've always locked in 42 from
the beginning.

00:51:20.219 --> 00:51:22.842
And so you can ask a thousand
questions like that and it's

00:51:22.842 --> 00:51:24.820
always going to be a complicated
answer,

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:29.387
but there has to be an answer
because we've proved that there

00:51:29.387 --> 00:51:30.150
was one.
 

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:31.989
Any other questions about this?
 

00:51:31.989 --> 00:51:32.909
Yes?
 

00:51:32.909 --> 00:51:34.534
Student:
So with the mortgage example

00:51:34.534 --> 00:51:36.500
you're hedging against the
interest rate going up.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.916
Prof: So with the
mortgage example you're hedging

00:51:40.916 --> 00:51:43.969
against the interest rate
going--no.

00:51:43.969 --> 00:51:47.929
When the interest rate goes up
you actually pay less.

00:51:47.929 --> 00:51:49.570
You've made a promise.
 

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:55.965
Remember, the price as the
interest rate goes up--where's

00:51:55.965 --> 00:51:58.480
the mortgage,
sorry.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.579
The value of the non-call,
the value of the call,

00:52:01.579 --> 00:52:05.262
so as the interest rate goes up
you owe less money because

00:52:05.262 --> 00:52:08.039
you're promising to deliver this
stuff.

00:52:08.039 --> 00:52:10.648
So the interest rate's up,
the mortgage you've sold short

00:52:10.648 --> 00:52:14.018
is less and less valuable,
so that's the good scenario for

00:52:14.018 --> 00:52:15.981
you,
but if the interest rate goes

00:52:15.981 --> 00:52:19.179
down that's the scenario where
you could get into trouble.

00:52:19.179 --> 00:52:23.449
So you're trying to protect
against the interest rate going

00:52:23.449 --> 00:52:26.826
down,
and in order to do that you

00:52:26.826 --> 00:52:32.710
have to give money up in case
the interest rate goes up.

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:36.809
So now I want to--any other
questions about this?

00:52:36.809 --> 00:52:42.710
It's quite an ingenious thing,
I think.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.159
So we're going to have one more
step of this,

00:52:44.159 --> 00:52:47.289
but this is the high watermark
of the standard,

00:52:47.289 --> 00:52:51.380
you know, the finance guys who
made finance such an important

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.594
subject,
and the rational expectations

00:52:54.594 --> 00:52:56.210
school of finance.
 

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.460
This is kind of the most clever
thing that they did.

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.876
So this kind of reasoning,
bookies maybe knew it for a

00:53:02.876 --> 00:53:05.652
long time,
but Black-Scholes in 1973

00:53:05.652 --> 00:53:09.512
started this kind of thinking
and then lots of hedge funds

00:53:09.512 --> 00:53:12.289
started imitating it including
my own.

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:16.239
So I certainly didn't invent
this idea of dynamic hedging.

00:53:16.239 --> 00:53:20.469
Now, let's take a step back.
 

00:53:20.469 --> 00:53:23.510
The crucial idea is marking to
market.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.407
The crucial idea is that you
want to hedge something through

00:53:26.407 --> 00:53:29.550
millions of scenarios and really
the outcome you won't know until

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:30.139
the end.
 

00:53:30.139 --> 00:53:35.393
What you should do is hedge at
each step of the way your mark

00:53:35.393 --> 00:53:36.969
to market value.
 

00:53:36.969 --> 00:53:39.489
So you only have to do things a
step at a time.

00:53:39.489 --> 00:53:42.318
There's an exponentially
growing number of paths,

00:53:42.318 --> 00:53:45.382
but there are only two
possibilities from today until

00:53:45.382 --> 00:53:46.150
tomorrow.
 

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:48.268
So it's very simple to hedge
two things.

00:53:48.268 --> 00:53:52.195
It seems incredibly complicated
to hedge 2 to the 100 things,

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:55.599
2 to the 10th is a very big
number, 2 is a very small

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:56.320
number.
 

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.518
You can hedge two things.
 

00:53:57.518 --> 00:54:00.657
It may be very complicated to
hedge 2 to the 10 things,

00:54:00.657 --> 00:54:03.619
but you only have to hedge 2
things on every day.

00:54:03.619 --> 00:54:05.963
So once you've realized that,
hedging is actually quite a

00:54:05.963 --> 00:54:06.760
simple operation.
 

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.201
You don't have to do it by
trading in the interest rate

00:54:10.201 --> 00:54:11.539
derivatives market.
 

00:54:11.539 --> 00:54:13.619
You could trade in a simpler
market.

00:54:13.619 --> 00:54:18.405
Suppose, for example,
that you knew that there were

00:54:18.405 --> 00:54:22.809
bonds being traded,
let's say 30-year bonds.

00:54:22.809 --> 00:54:29.869
So let's just take a look at a
30-year bond here,

00:54:29.869 --> 00:54:35.898
callable bond,
so this is exactly the same

00:54:35.898 --> 00:54:37.369
thing.
 

00:54:37.369 --> 00:54:39.969
This is the 30-year bond under
the same circumstance.

00:54:39.969 --> 00:54:43.699
This is a 9 percent bond,
coupon bond,

00:54:43.699 --> 00:54:49.347
and it's starting with the same
6 percent interest rates,

00:54:49.347 --> 00:54:53.280
exactly the same process as
before.

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.050
So the interest rates,
those are the same interest

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:57.070
rates as before.
 

00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:58.250
So here's the bond.
 

00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:04.481
Now, the bond starts at 140
dollars, can go to 121 dollars

00:55:04.481 --> 00:55:06.670
or to 159 dollars.
 

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:16.206
Remember this thing that you're
trying to hedge goes from 98.8

00:55:16.206 --> 00:55:19.960
to 100.6 or to 107.11.
 

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.701
So what you need to do now
is--you've promised to make

00:55:24.701 --> 00:55:28.458
deliveries in the future,
very complicated,

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:33.199
but you know you can summarize
that whole future.

00:55:33.199 --> 00:55:36.876
As long as you've got 100.6
dollars in the up state and

00:55:36.876 --> 00:55:41.027
107.11 dollars in the down state
after the very first step you

00:55:41.027 --> 00:55:44.159
will have hedged your mortgage
obligation.

00:55:44.159 --> 00:55:47.632
But you could just buy the
right percentage of bonds and be

00:55:47.632 --> 00:55:49.789
able to accomplish the same
thing.

00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:51.030
So why is that?
 

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:52.639
Well, there's a gap here and
here.

00:55:52.639 --> 00:55:56.599
You owe less money here than
you do down there.

00:55:56.599 --> 00:56:00.050
So the bond is worth less up
here than down here.

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:04.760
In fact this bond is worth 38
dollars more here than here.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.179
So the gap in the bond is 38.
 

00:56:07.179 --> 00:56:17.650
The gap in here is something
like 6.5.

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:21.039
So this is like 1 sixth.
 

00:56:21.039 --> 00:56:27.039
So as long as you held 1 sixth
of the bond and something that

00:56:27.039 --> 00:56:33.039
paid the right constant amount
in each case you would get the

00:56:33.039 --> 00:56:36.239
same payments here and here.
 

00:56:36.239 --> 00:56:37.880
So what is the right constant
amount?

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:42.782
1 sixth of the bond,
by the way, would cost you

00:56:42.782 --> 00:56:48.219
22,24, 23, about 23 dollars,
1 sixth of the bond.

00:56:48.219 --> 00:56:51.519
So if you took the other 98.8
dollars and put it to the 1 year

00:56:51.519 --> 00:56:54.197
Treasury,
I claim it's obvious--so take 1

00:56:54.197 --> 00:57:00.994
sixth of the--
so 1 sixth of 30 year 9 percent

00:57:00.994 --> 00:57:02.119
bond.
 

00:57:02.119 --> 00:57:08.929
That's 1 sixth of this thing,
which costs you what?

00:57:08.929 --> 00:57:12.139
It cost 23 dollars.
 

00:57:12.139 --> 00:57:13.610
The price of that is 23 dollars.
 

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:24.922
Now, combine that with 75.8
dollars of 1 year Treasury,

00:57:24.922 --> 00:57:30.789
1 year 6 percent Treasury.
 

00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:32.570
So hold those two things.
 

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:37.389
I claim that'll pay you 100.6
here and 107.11 here.

00:57:37.389 --> 00:57:40.405
How do I know that without
having to even calculate

00:57:40.405 --> 00:57:41.309
anything out?
 

00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:44.248
Well, the Treasury's going to
pay the same amount here and

00:57:44.248 --> 00:57:44.610
here.
 

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:45.960
It's going to be a constant.
 

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.985
This thing, since its gap is 38
dollars and I only hold 1 sixth

00:57:49.985 --> 00:57:52.349
of it,
it's going to pay me exactly 6

00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:55.789
and 1 half more down here than
it pays here because the gap

00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:58.280
instead of 38 will be 1 sixth of
that,

00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.730
which will be 6 and 1 half.
 

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:01.829
So the gap will exactly match
that.

00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:05.083
So added that to the Treasury's
constant payments I'm going to

00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:08.126
get something over here and 6
and 1 half dollars more than

00:58:08.126 --> 00:58:09.139
that down here.
 

00:58:09.139 --> 00:58:11.190
But since I've paid the same
amount,

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:15.889
98.8, it's going to have to be
that that constant was exactly

00:58:15.889 --> 00:58:19.179
right to make this be 100.6 and
107.11,

00:58:19.179 --> 00:58:22.201
because both the 1 year
Treasury and the 30 year bond

00:58:22.201 --> 00:58:25.570
were calculated by discounting
whatever their payments were

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.780
here and here by the same
prices,

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.429
this and this.
 

00:58:29.429 --> 00:58:31.309
So there's a second way.
 

00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:36.639
Instead of trading in the
derivatives market I could just

00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:42.726
hold a combination of two bonds,
the 1 year Treasury and the 30

00:58:42.726 --> 00:58:46.317
year 9 percent bond,
and I'd still be perfectly

00:58:46.317 --> 00:58:46.800
hedged.
 

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.530
But then when I got to here I'd
want to change my mix.

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:52.358
I'd want to hold a different
1-year bond at a different

00:58:52.358 --> 00:58:55.286
interest rate,
so I have to buy a new 1-year

00:58:55.286 --> 00:58:59.710
bond and a different amount of
the 30-year non-callable bond,

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.965
9 percent bond,
but I could always reproduce

00:59:01.965 --> 00:59:03.329
these same two payments.
 

00:59:03.329 --> 00:59:06.664
So I don't have to hedge by
holding derivatives,

00:59:06.664 --> 00:59:10.710
interest rate derivatives,
I can hedge by holding standard

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:11.420
bonds.
 

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:15.940
And I can tell at a glance how
much of the longer term bond to

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:20.016
hold because I just have to
match this gap in the prices

00:59:20.016 --> 00:59:24.538
since the 1 year bond is always
going to pay the same thing up

00:59:24.538 --> 00:59:25.650
and down.
 

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:32.579
Did that go too fast?
 

00:59:32.579 --> 00:59:33.559
Yeah?
 

00:59:33.559 --> 00:59:34.844
Student: I know it's
just

00:59:34.844 --> 00:59:36.045
like&gt;
 

00:59:36.045 --> 00:59:38.739
but how did you figure out how
much of the 1-year bond to buy?

00:59:38.739 --> 00:59:44.360
Prof: So I want to hold
1 sixth of the 30 year bond,

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:49.306
which cost me 140,
so 1 sixth of that is going to

00:59:49.306 --> 00:59:51.469
cost me 23 dollars.
 

00:59:51.469 --> 00:59:57.036
All right, now I want to also
hold a 1 year Treasury so that

00:59:57.036 --> 01:00:02.793
the payment 1 sixth of 121 at
the top plus whatever the 1 year

01:00:02.793 --> 01:00:07.983
Treasury pays me is equal to
100.6 and such that 1 sixth

01:00:07.983 --> 01:00:12.639
times this value at the bottom,
oh, sorry.

01:00:12.639 --> 01:00:15.250
It's 1 sixth this coupon is
paying.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:17.269
Actually it wasn't 121.6.
 

01:00:17.269 --> 01:00:19.219
It's a 9 percent bond.
 

01:00:19.219 --> 01:00:21.590
I forgot its coupon,
very bad of me.

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.320
It won't change the numbers,
but.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.650
So it's paying--I didn't write
it down.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.570
So this thing is not paying 121.
 

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:29.750
It's also paying the coupon.
 

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:31.420
This is the present value of
what's left.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.590
So it's paying 9 plus that.
 

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.440
So it's 130 and here it's 168.
 

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.289
The gap is still 38.
 

01:00:37.289 --> 01:00:43.780
So I want 1 sixth of 130.
 

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:52.360
So 1 sixth of 130 costs--it's
still the same number.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.469
It's 22.
 

01:00:53.469 --> 01:00:56.018
I did bad arithmetic to begin
with so it's still 22.

01:00:56.018 --> 01:00:59.927
No, sorry, it's 1 sixth of this
thing which is 140,

01:00:59.927 --> 01:01:01.489
so it's 23, right.
 

01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:01.980
Sorry.
 

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.539
That didn't change.
 

01:01:02.539 --> 01:01:07.050
So the payment here is 130 and
the payment here is 168.

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:12.012
So 1 sixth of 130,
that's the up payment,

01:01:12.012 --> 01:01:15.610
and this is 1 sixth of 168.
 

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:21.088
Now, I want that plus whatever
the 1 year Treasury gives me to

01:01:21.088 --> 01:01:24.949
equal 100.6 up here and 107.11
down here.

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:27.706
That way I would have
replicated things and hedged

01:01:27.706 --> 01:01:29.170
myself perfectly,
right?

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:31.639
But I don't have to figure out
what that 1 year Treasury is.

01:01:31.639 --> 01:01:32.739
I think it's obvious.
 

01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:38.010
All I have to do is say
subtract 23 from 98.8,

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:42.050
so I just have to buy 75.8
dollars worth of the 1 year

01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:46.320
Treasury and that'll give me
exactly the right payoff.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.719
Why is that?
 

01:01:47.719 --> 01:01:57.460
Because this number 140.93
divided by 6 is exactly this

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:06.164
evaluated at this price,
1 half over 1.06 times this,

01:02:06.164 --> 01:02:12.190
this is the price 1 half times
1 over 1.06.

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:17.449
All right, so that bond which
cost 140.53 how did I get 140.53

01:02:17.449 --> 01:02:18.139
there?
 

01:02:18.139 --> 01:02:20.880
I took the price of 1 dollar in
the up state,

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.349
which is it's 50 percent likely
discounted,

01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:27.195
multiplying by its payoff 130,
plus 1 half discounted

01:02:27.195 --> 01:02:29.710
multiplied by the payoff of 168.
 

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:32.550
This is 168 because it's a 9
percent bond.

01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:37.268
So it's 1 sixth times 1
sixth--so if I get a sixth of

01:02:37.268 --> 01:02:42.440
the bond it'll cost me 140.43
divided by 6 which is 23.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.849
So what about the 1 year
Treasury?

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:49.882
That's going to give me some
payment, an additional payment

01:02:49.882 --> 01:02:52.804
here and here,
namely 1.06 times whatever I

01:02:52.804 --> 01:02:53.570
put in.
 

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:59.626
So you notice that the gap
between here and here since I've

01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:06.309
multiplied by 1 sixth is exactly
this 6 and 1 half dollar gap.

01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:14.139
So the total I have to spend is
98.8 over here,

01:03:14.139 --> 01:03:17.525
so if I spend 23 dollars on the
Treasury and the remaining

01:03:17.525 --> 01:03:20.177
amount--
23 dollars on the 30 year 9

01:03:20.177 --> 01:03:23.268
percent bond,
the remaining amount of money

01:03:23.268 --> 01:03:27.032
which is 75.8 on the Treasury I
will have spent this 98.8

01:03:27.032 --> 01:03:29.606
dollars,
but then I have to get the same

01:03:29.606 --> 01:03:30.119
payoffs.
 

01:03:30.119 --> 01:03:30.949
Why is that?
 

01:03:30.949 --> 01:03:33.382
Because they're all being
priced at the same prices,

01:03:33.382 --> 01:03:35.768
so it's just the distributive
law of arithmetic.

01:03:35.768 --> 01:03:40.849
If these payoffs times 1 sixth
plus the Treasury payoffs equal

01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:45.764
100.6 and 107.11 then it must be
that the sum of the money I

01:03:45.764 --> 01:03:49.179
spent on the 30 year 9 percent
bond,

01:03:49.179 --> 01:03:52.632
plus the sum of the money I
spent on the Treasury has to

01:03:52.632 --> 01:03:53.449
equal 98.8.
 

01:03:53.449 --> 01:03:59.637
Therefore, I know that the
amount of money of the 98.8 I

01:03:59.637 --> 01:04:06.836
spent on the 1 year Treasury was
98.8 minus the 23 I spent on the

01:04:06.836 --> 01:04:08.750
30-year bond.
 

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:13.202
So that's how you can--so to
say it again just in a big

01:04:13.202 --> 01:04:14.440
picture look.
 

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.119
There are two things that can
happen.

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:19.052
If you hold two bonds,
a 1-year Treasury and a 30-year

01:04:19.052 --> 01:04:21.007
thing,
you're obviously going to be

01:04:21.007 --> 01:04:24.186
able to match these two things
by holding the right proportion

01:04:24.186 --> 01:04:24.760
of them.
 

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.750
That is just obvious.
 

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:30.246
And then less obvious is how
quickly I'm figuring out how

01:04:30.246 --> 01:04:32.369
much of those two bonds to hold.
 

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:35.632
And the way I'm figuring it out
so quickly is because the 1-year

01:04:35.632 --> 01:04:38.170
Treasury is paying the same
thing up and down,

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:40.682
so I have to get all the
variation out of the 30-year

01:04:40.682 --> 01:04:43.166
bond,
so I have to hold the right

01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:47.670
proportion of the 30-year bond
to get the same variation.

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:51.938
So in the very big picture if
you're trying to hedge some

01:04:51.938 --> 01:04:55.900
instrument with another
instrument and a portfolio of

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.429
stuff,
much of which is certain,

01:04:58.429 --> 01:05:00.730
and only one thing that's
risky,

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.657
the amount of the risky thing
you have to hold has to produce

01:05:03.657 --> 01:05:06.389
as much variation as the thing
you're trying to hedge.

01:05:06.389 --> 01:05:09.643
So the key is being able to
tell at a glance how much

01:05:09.643 --> 01:05:13.396
variation each thing has then
you can tell in what proportion

01:05:13.396 --> 01:05:14.460
to hold them.
 

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.039
And so the very last thing I
want to tell you today,

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:20.070
which is unfortunately going to
take me a few minutes,

01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:24.543
is how traders look at
variation and can guess it

01:05:24.543 --> 01:05:26.500
incredibly quickly.
 

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.784
So a trader could look at this
and guess without doing almost

01:05:29.784 --> 01:05:32.139
any calculations what the right
hedge is.

01:05:32.139 --> 01:05:40.766
So just like we did the
doubling rule I want to do the

01:05:40.766 --> 01:05:45.000
variation rule of thumb.
 

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:54.059
And this is called duration and
convexity, or average life.

01:05:54.059 --> 01:05:58.684
So I asked myself,
suppose I have this 30-year

01:05:58.684 --> 01:06:03.617
bond, 30-year non-callable bond,
that's this one,

01:06:03.617 --> 01:06:05.570
9 percent bond.
 

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:08.648
How could I guess,
kind of, what the variation in

01:06:08.648 --> 01:06:11.150
price would be without having to
do,

01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:14.271
you know, I've had to do this
very complicated backward

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:15.659
induction calculation.
 

01:06:15.659 --> 01:06:19.644
Now, remember once the interest
rates go up here it's a random

01:06:19.644 --> 01:06:22.389
walk so on average they're
pretty much,

01:06:22.389 --> 01:06:24.985
not pretty much,
they're exactly what they were

01:06:24.985 --> 01:06:25.380
here.
 

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.480
They start here.
 

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.940
They go up and down,
but on average they're still

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.300
here.
 

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.385
And over here they've gone down
so the average is lower going

01:06:32.385 --> 01:06:32.900
forward.
 

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.268
In fact, it's exactly equal to
that.

01:06:35.268 --> 01:06:39.672
So if you're a trader and there
was no uncertainty you would

01:06:39.672 --> 01:06:44.224
know that the present value with
no uncertainty is going to be

01:06:44.224 --> 01:06:48.550
the coupon divided by (1 the
interest rate) the coupon over

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:52.878
(1 the interest rate) squared
(in the last year) the coupon

01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:57.132
over (1 the interest rate) to
the T 100 times [correction:

01:06:57.132 --> 01:07:00.639
over]
(1 the interest rate) to the T.

01:07:00.639 --> 01:07:02.829
That's the value of the bond.
 

01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:07.210
Now, you sort of want to know
how much is that price going to

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:10.130
change when the interest rate
changes.

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:13.438
Well, at a glance,
I mean, you just take the

01:07:13.438 --> 01:07:14.440
derivative.
 

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:19.559
What is dPV/dr?
 

01:07:19.559 --> 01:07:30.110
It's going to be minus C over
(1 r) squared - 2 C over (1 r)

01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:41.199
cubed - T times C over (1 r) to
the (T 1) - T times 100 divided

01:07:41.199 --> 01:07:45.849
by (1 r) to the (T 1).
 

01:07:45.849 --> 01:07:48.489
That's the derivative.
 

01:07:48.489 --> 01:07:51.230
It looks like I'm making things
even more complicated,

01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:57.755
you would think,
but this turns out to be not so

01:07:57.755 --> 01:08:02.027
complicated,
because this is a number--so

01:08:02.027 --> 01:08:04.920
let's put the minus on the
outside,

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:10.039
so I'll get rid of this.
 

01:08:10.039 --> 01:08:13.630
This is a number which you can
sort of get in your head,

01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:15.329
so let's try writing it.
 

01:08:15.329 --> 01:08:17.738
Let's pull out one of the (1
r)s.

01:08:17.738 --> 01:08:27.546
So it's minus 1 over (1 r)
times (C over (1 r) 2 C over (1

01:08:27.546 --> 01:08:30.300
r) squared ...
 

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:38.529
T times (C 100) (that's the
last payment) over (1 r) to the

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:39.239
T).
 

01:08:39.239 --> 01:08:42.670
Now, what is that?
 

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:44.300
Can you interpret that?
 

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:47.454
And the answer is yes you can
interpret that because what is

01:08:47.454 --> 01:08:47.828
that?
 

01:08:47.828 --> 01:08:51.586
That's saying these are all the
payments you're getting over the

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:52.720
life of the bond.
 

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.229
It's C, C and the last one's C
100.

01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:57.829
This number that keeps coming
in front of them,

01:08:57.829 --> 01:09:01.109
though, is the year in which
you're getting the payment.

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:02.319
This is in the first year.
 

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.250
I could put a 1 there.
 

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:04.840
This is the payment in the
second year.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.729
There's a 2 here.
 

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:07.520
This is the payment in the Tth
year.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.029
There's a T here.
 

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:12.479
You got that T from taking the
derivative of the denominator

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:12.890
here.
 

01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:19.283
So it's like weighting the year
in which the payments come by

01:09:19.283 --> 01:09:22.479
the value of those payments.
 

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:24.368
So in the first year the value
is C.

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:26.198
The present value is C over (1
r).

01:09:26.198 --> 01:09:28.640
In the second year the payment
is C,

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.658
but discounted,
C over (1 r) squared,

01:09:31.658 --> 01:09:34.750
and the last year the total
payment is C 100,

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:37.279
but you had to discount it by
(1 r) to the Tth.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:42.020
So this is just like taking the
average year in which the

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.069
present value flows actually
come.

01:09:45.069 --> 01:09:50.340
If I divided this now by the
present value of--

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:55.270
the present value,
these numbers down here,

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:59.970
C over this C over this squared
C 100 over this to the Tth,

01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:02.640
those are all weights
multiplying the year in which

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.710
the payments come.
 

01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:05.340
They add up to the present
value.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:09.122
So basically I've just got a
weighted average of what year

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:10.649
the payments come in.
 

01:10:10.649 --> 01:10:18.680
This is called the average life.
 

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.730
This thing in here is the
average life because I've

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:25.391
multiplied the year in which the
payments come by the present

01:10:25.391 --> 01:10:28.626
value of the cash flows there
and then I've made those

01:10:28.626 --> 01:10:31.800
multipliers add up to 1 by
dividing by the PV.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.189
See, this in parenthesis,
all these terms are the things

01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:39.939
multiplying the year in which
the thing came.

01:10:39.939 --> 01:10:42.708
So if I add up all these
coefficients here I'm just

01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:44.260
getting the present value.
 

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.828
So now the coefficients add up
to 1.

01:10:45.828 --> 01:10:48.774
So I'm just taking an average
of the year in which the thing

01:10:48.774 --> 01:10:50.970
came and that's what the average
life is,

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:55.563
but that's equal to the
derivative of the present value

01:10:55.563 --> 01:10:58.198
divided by the present value.
 

01:10:58.198 --> 01:11:00.756
So it's--the percentage change
in the present value is the

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.640
average year in which the
payments come.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.970
So let's just think about it.
 

01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:05.908
Suppose you have a 10-year bond?
 

01:11:05.908 --> 01:11:09.158
It pays C, C,
C, C, C, and then 100 at the

01:11:09.158 --> 01:11:10.029
very end.
 

01:11:10.029 --> 01:11:12.479
What do you think the average
life is?

01:11:12.479 --> 01:11:15.186
Well, if there were no
discounting the average life

01:11:15.186 --> 01:11:18.600
wouldn't be 5 because there's
such a huge payment in the end.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:23.168
The average life would be 8 or
9, but there is discounting so

01:11:23.168 --> 01:11:26.520
this thing at the end won't
count as much.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.408
So the average life is probably
7.

01:11:28.408 --> 01:11:30.773
If it's a 30 year bond,
the average life,

01:11:30.773 --> 01:11:33.787
you're going to get C,
C, C, C, and then all the way

01:11:33.787 --> 01:11:36.210
at the end you're going to get C
100.

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:39.345
Well, if the payments were all
equal and no discounting it

01:11:39.345 --> 01:11:41.744
would be 15,
but there's a huge amount of

01:11:41.744 --> 01:11:45.288
discounting so that last payment
is really pretty irrelevant,

01:11:45.288 --> 01:11:47.840
so probably--so it's not clear
which way it goes,

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:52.270
probably the average life will
be less than 15.

01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:56.550
So you can see just by looking
at the bond,

01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:00.266
and I'm ending with this
thought, by looking at the bond

01:12:00.266 --> 01:12:03.850
itself you can figure out what
the average life is.

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:06.028
So a trader,
just by a little experience and

01:12:06.028 --> 01:12:08.003
common sense,
can figure out the average

01:12:08.003 --> 01:12:08.460
life.
 

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.710
I mean, here are all the
payments the way they're coming.

01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:13.546
They're coming evenly across
the whole history of the bond

01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:16.356
with something at the end,
so the average life is probably

01:12:16.356 --> 01:12:19.015
a little bit over the average,
but if you go way off,

01:12:19.015 --> 01:12:22.070
you push the final payment too
far to the end then it's

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:24.519
becoming negligible,
it's almost irrelevant,

01:12:24.519 --> 01:12:27.077
and so the average life by
discounting will probably be

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:28.118
before the average.
 

01:12:28.118 --> 01:12:31.228
So a 10-year bond probably has
an average life of 7,

01:12:31.228 --> 01:12:34.578
a 30-year bond maybe has an
average life of 12 or 13.

01:12:34.578 --> 01:12:38.641
Once you know the average life,
you just have to hold bonds in

01:12:38.641 --> 01:12:41.038
proportion to their average
lives.

01:12:41.038 --> 01:12:44.217
The dollar amount you put in
each bond to hedge it is just

01:12:44.217 --> 01:12:46.170
proportional to its average
life.

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:48.765
So that's how a trader,
without having to do any

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:51.505
arithmetic,
can kind of guess how much of

01:12:51.505 --> 01:12:55.300
the 30 year bond will it take to
hedge a 10 year bond,

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.939
and how much of a--so which has
a higher average life?

01:12:59.939 --> 01:13:02.738
The longer the bond the higher
the average life,

01:13:02.738 --> 01:13:06.556
the more sensitive it is to
interest rate changes so the

01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:09.750
less of it you need to hedge
your position,

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:12.391
so if you hold the 30 year bond
you don't have to hold that much

01:13:12.391 --> 01:13:13.471
of it,
1 sixth of it,

01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:15.130
in order to hedge this
mortgage.

01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:17.942
The mortgage has a very short
average life because it's

01:13:17.942 --> 01:13:19.140
prepaying so quickly.
 

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:20.770
So it's not going to last very
long.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:23.667
So this is an amazing
connection between average life

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:25.618
and sensitivity to interest
rate.

01:13:25.618 --> 01:13:27.550
And average life is something
you can guess.

01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:30.212
Sensitivity to interest rate is
something you have to do huge

01:13:30.212 --> 01:13:32.119
calculations for,
but the two are almost the

01:13:32.119 --> 01:13:32.520
same.
 

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.520
So in the problem set we'll see
if you can do it.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:40.801
I asked you a couple problems
to do with average life,

01:13:40.801 --> 01:13:41.300
so.
 

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:46.000

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.600
Professor Christine
Hayes: You don't need me to

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.240
tell you that human civilization
is very, very old.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.985
Nevertheless,
our knowledge of the earliest

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.514
stages of human civilization was
quite limited for many

00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:14.686
centuries.
That is, until the great

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:17.669
archaeological discoveries of
the nineteenth and twentieth

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.842
centuries,
which unearthed for us the

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:22.368
great civilizations of the
Ancient Near East,

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:25.526
of which I have drawn a
remarkably life-like map here on

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.880
the board: [laughter]
Mediterranean,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.345
I always start with the
Mediterranean Ocean,

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:33.040
the Nile River,
the Tigris and the Euphrates.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.490
So: the great civilizations of
ancient Egypt,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.275
Mesopotamia and the area we
refer to as the Fertile

00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:41.085
Crescent,
of which a little part here

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:44.330
about the size of Rhode Island
is Canaan.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.260
And archaeologists in the
nineteenth and twentieth

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.728
centuries were stunned to find
the ruins and the records of

00:00:50.728 --> 00:00:53.420
remarkable peoples and
cultures--massive,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.539
complex empires in some cases
but some of which had completely

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.700
disappeared from human memory.
 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.359
Their newly uncovered languages
had been long forgotten;

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:07.840
their rich literary and legal
texts were now indecipherable.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.310
That soon changed.
 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.219
But because of those
discoveries, we are now in a

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.735
position to appreciate the
monumental achievements of these

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.444
early civilizations,
these earliest

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.753
civilizations.
And so many scholars,

00:01:20.753 --> 00:01:23.782
and many people,
have remarked that it's not a

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:27.754
small irony that the Ancient
Near Eastern people with one of

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.231
the,
or perhaps the most

00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:33.542
lasting legacy,
was not a people that built and

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:37.644
inhabited one of the great
centers of Ancient Near Eastern

00:01:37.644 --> 00:01:40.667
civilization.
It can be argued that the

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:44.814
Ancient Near Eastern people with
the most lasting legacy is a

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:46.680
people that had an idea.
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.740
It was a new idea that broke
with the ideas of its neighbors,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.379
and those people were the
Israelites.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.775
And scholars have come to the
realization that despite the

00:01:56.775 --> 00:01:59.040
Bible's pretensions to the
contrary,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.382
the Israelites were a small,
and I've actually

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:03.985
overrepresented it here,
I'm sure it should be much

00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:06.111
smaller,
a small and relatively

00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.319
insignificant group for much of
their history.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.485
They did manage to establish a
kingdom in the land that was

00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:17.220
known in antiquity as Canaan
around the year 1000.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.898
They probably succeeded in
subduing some of their

00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:22.242
neighbors, collecting
tribute--there's some

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:25.590
controversy about that--but in
about 922 this kingdom divided

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.269
into two smaller and lesser
kingdoms that fell in

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.946
importance.
The northern kingdom,

00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:35.025
which consisted of ten of the
twelve Israelite tribes,

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:39.257
and known confusingly as
Israel, was destroyed in 722 by

00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:41.915
the Assyrians.
The southern kingdom,

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:45.047
which consisted of two of the
twelve tribes and known as

00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:47.482
Judah,
managed to survive until the

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:51.533
year 586 when the Babylonians
came in and conquered and sent

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.250
the people into exile.
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.460
The capital, Jerusalem, fell.
 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.107
Conquest and exile were events
that normally would spell the

00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:03.336
end of a particular ethnic
national group,

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:05.699
particularly in antiquity.
 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.074
Conquered peoples would trade
their defeated god for the

00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:12.386
victorious god of their
conquerors and eventually there

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:15.208
would be a cultural and
religious assimilation,

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:16.620
intermarriage.
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.120
That people would disappear
as a distinctive entity,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.029
and in effect,
that is what happened to the

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.620
ten tribes of the northern
kingdom to a large degree.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.090
They were lost to history.
 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.311
This did not happen to those
members of the nation of Israel

00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:30.659
who lived in the southern
kingdom, Judah.

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.202
Despite the demise of their
national political base in 586,

00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:40.102
the Israelites alone,
really, among the many peoples

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:43.789
who have figured in Ancient Near
Eastern history--the Sumerians,

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.238
the Akkadians,
the Babylonians,

00:03:45.238 --> 00:03:46.639
the Hittites,
the Phoenicians,

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.555
the Hurrians,
the Canaanites--they emerged

00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:53.895
after the death of their state,
producing a community and a

00:03:53.895 --> 00:03:58.236
culture that can be traced
through various twists and turns

00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:02.202
and vicissitudes of history
right down into the modern

00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:05.520
period.
That's a pretty unique claim.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.753
And they carried with them the
idea and the traditions that

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:11.930
laid the foundation for the
major religions of the western

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.900
world: Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.189
So what is this radical new
idea that shaped a culture and

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:24.856
enabled its survival into later
antiquity and really right into

00:04:24.856 --> 00:04:27.339
the present day in some form?
 

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:30.490
Well, the conception of the
universe that was widespread

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.754
among ancient peoples is one
that you're probably familiar

00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:36.274
with.
People regarded the various

00:04:36.274 --> 00:04:39.392
natural forces as imbued with
divine power,

00:04:39.392 --> 00:04:42.509
as in some sense divinities
themselves.

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.044
The earth was a divinity,
the sky was a divinity,

00:04:45.044 --> 00:04:47.420
the water was a divinity,
had divine power.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.083
In other words,
the gods were identical with or

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:52.110
imminent in the forces of
nature.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.511
There were many gods.
 

00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:56.579
No one single god was therefore
all powerful.

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:59.589
There is very,
very good evidence to suggest

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:03.930
that ancient Israelites by and
large shared this world view.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.339
They participated at the very
earliest stages in the wider

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.689
religious and cultic culture of
the Ancient Near East.

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.723
However, over the course of
time, some ancient Israelites,

00:05:15.723 --> 00:05:19.079
not all at once and not
unanimously,

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:22.558
broke with this view and
articulated a different view,

00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:25.379
that there was one divine
power, one god.

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.574
But much more important than
number was the fact that this

00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:32.370
god was outside of and above
nature.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.079
This god was not identified
with nature.

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:38.590
He transcended nature,
and he wasn't known through

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.740
nature or natural phenomena.
 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.868
He was known through history,
events and a particular

00:05:44.868 --> 00:05:47.250
relationship with humankind.
 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.756
And that idea,
which seems simple at first and

00:05:49.756 --> 00:05:52.040
not so very revolutionary--we
will see,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.682
that's an idea that affected
every aspect of Israelite

00:05:55.682 --> 00:05:59.806
culture and in ways that will
become clear as we move through

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:03.999
the course and learn more about
biblical religion and biblical

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.676
views of history,
it was an idea that ensured the

00:06:07.676 --> 00:06:10.990
survival of the ancient
Israelites as an entity,

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.519
as an ethnic religious entity.
 

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:17.238
In various complicated ways,
the view of an utterly

00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:21.552
transcendent god with absolute
control over history made it

00:06:21.552 --> 00:06:26.088
possible for some Israelites to
interpret even the most tragic

00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:29.724
and catastrophic events,
such as the destruction of

00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:32.750
their capital and the exile of
their remaining peoples,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.774
not as a defeat of Israel's god
or even God's rejection of them,

00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:41.106
but as necessary,
a necessary part of God's

00:06:41.106 --> 00:06:43.649
larger purpose or plan for
Israel.

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:47.690
These Israelites left for us
the record of their religious

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.943
and cultural revolution in the
writings that are known as the

00:06:51.943 --> 00:06:55.210
Hebrew Bible collectively,
and this course is an

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.196
introduction to the Hebrew Bible
as an expression of the

00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:01.020
religious life and thought of
ancient Israel and as a

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.790
foundational document of western
civilization.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.480
The course has several goals.
 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.091
First and foremost,
we want to familiarize you with

00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:09.920
the contents of the Hebrew
Bible.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.329
We're not going to read every
bit of it word for word.

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:15.285
We will read certain chunks of
it quite carefully and from

00:07:15.285 --> 00:07:17.100
others we will choose
selections,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.335
but you will get a very good
sense and a good sampling of the

00:07:20.335 --> 00:07:21.629
contents of the Bible.
 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:26.488
A second goal is to introduce
you to a number of approaches to

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:30.121
the study of the Bible,
different methodological

00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:33.952
approaches that have been
advanced by modern scholars but

00:07:33.952 --> 00:07:36.620
some of which are in fact quite
old.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.279
At times, we will play the
historian, at times we will be

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.860
literary critics.
 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.850
"How does this work as
literature?"

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.420
At times we will be religious
and cultural critics.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.863
"What is it the Israelites were
saying in their day and in their

00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:53.940
time and against whom and for
what?"

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.791
A third goal of the course is
to provide some insight into the

00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:59.560
history of interpretation.
 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.730
This is a really fun part of
the course.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.566
The Bible's radically new
conception of the divine,

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:09.862
its revolutionary depiction of
the human being as a moral

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:12.835
agent,
its riveting saga of the nation

00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:16.178
of Israel, their story,
has drawn generations of

00:08:16.178 --> 00:08:19.379
readers to ponder its meaning
and message.

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:22.537
And as a result,
the Bible has become the base

00:08:22.537 --> 00:08:26.327
of an enormous edifice of
interpretation and commentary

00:08:26.327 --> 00:08:29.266
and debate,
both in traditional settings

00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:32.769
but also in academic,
university, secular settings.

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:35.133
And from time to time,
particularly in section

00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:38.127
discussion, you will have
occasion to consider the ways in

00:08:38.127 --> 00:08:41.436
which certain biblical passages
have been interpreted--sometimes

00:08:41.436 --> 00:08:44.220
in very contradictory ways--over
the centuries.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.740
That can be a really fun and
exciting part of the course.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.239
A fourth goal of the course is
to familiarize you with the

00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:56.976
culture of ancient Israel as
represented in the Bible against

00:08:56.976 --> 00:09:01.159
the backdrop of its Ancient Near
Eastern setting,

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:04.060
its historical and cultural
setting, because the

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.886
archaeological discoveries that
were referred to in the Ancient

00:09:07.886 --> 00:09:10.866
Near East,
reveal to us the spiritual and

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:15.030
cultural heritage of all of the
inhabitants of the region,

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.840
including the Israelites.
 

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.943
And one of the major
consequences of these finds is

00:09:19.943 --> 00:09:23.915
the light that they have shed on
the background and the origin of

00:09:23.915 --> 00:09:25.840
the materials in the Bible.
 

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.326
So we now see that the
traditions in the Bible did not

00:09:29.326 --> 00:09:30.840
come out of a vacuum.
 

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.935
The early chapters of Genesis,
Genesis 1 through 11--they're

00:09:33.935 --> 00:09:37.165
known as the "Primeval History,"
which is a very unfortunate

00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:40.109
name, because these chapters
really are not best read or

00:09:40.109 --> 00:09:43.320
understood as history in the
conventional sense--but these 11

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.799
chapters owe a great deal to
Ancient Near Eastern mythology.

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:51.360
The creation story in Genesis 1
draws upon the Babylonian epic

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.080
known as Enuma Elish.
 

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.460
We'll be talking about that
text in some depth.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.466
The story of the first human
pair in the Garden of Eden,

00:09:58.466 --> 00:10:01.800
which is in Genesis 2 and 3 has
clear affinities with the Epic

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.176
of Gilgamesh,
that's a Babylonian and

00:10:04.176 --> 00:10:07.634
Assyrian epic in which a hero
embarks on this exhausting

00:10:07.634 --> 00:10:09.269
search for immortality.
 

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.791
The story of Noah and the
flood, which occurs in Genesis 6

00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:16.684
through 9 is simply an Israelite
version of an older flood story

00:10:16.684 --> 00:10:20.391
that we have found copies of:
a Mesopotamian story called the

00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:24.160
Epic of Atrahasis a flood story
that we also have incorporated

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.200
in the Epic of Gilgamesh.
 

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.636
Biblical traditions have roots
that stretch deep into earlier

00:10:30.636 --> 00:10:34.629
times and out into surrounding
lands and traditions,

00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:38.374
and the parallels between the
biblical stories and Ancient

00:10:38.374 --> 00:10:42.447
Near Eastern stories that they
parallel has been the subject of

00:10:42.447 --> 00:10:45.404
intense study.
However, it isn't just the

00:10:45.404 --> 00:10:49.566
similarity between the biblical
materials and the Ancient Near

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.500
Eastern sources that is
important to us.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.235
In fact, in some ways it's the
dissimilarity that is remarkably

00:10:57.235 --> 00:11:00.772
important to us,
the biblical transformation of

00:11:00.772 --> 00:11:05.025
a common Near Eastern heritage
in light of its radically new

00:11:05.025 --> 00:11:08.629
conceptions of God and the world
and humankind.

00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:11.210
We'll be dealing with this in
some depth, but I'll give you

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.100
one quick example.
 

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.387
We have a Sumerian story about
the third millennium BCE,

00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:21.809
going back 3000--third
millennium, 3000 BCE.

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:25.511
It's the story of Ziusudra,
and it's very similar to the

00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:27.529
Genesis flood story of Noah.
 

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:31.009
In both of these stories,
the Sumerian and the Israelite

00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:34.614
story, you have a flood that is
the result of a deliberate

00:11:34.614 --> 00:11:37.426
divine decision;
one individual is chosen to be

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:39.495
rescued;
that individual is given very

00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:41.820
specific instructions on
building a boat;

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.409
he is given instructions about
who to bring on board;

00:11:44.409 --> 00:11:47.460
the flood comes and
exterminates all living things;

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.029
the boat comes to rest on a
mountaintop;

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:52.179
the hero sends out birds to
reconnoiter the land;

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:55.120
when he comes out of the ark he
offers a sacrifice to the

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.269
god--the same narrative elements
are in these two stories.

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:01.629
It's just wonderful when you
read them side by side.

00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:05.498
So what is of great
significance though is not

00:12:05.498 --> 00:12:10.313
simply that the biblical writer
is retelling a story that

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:15.299
clearly went around everywhere
in ancient Mesopotamia;

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:19.629
they were transforming
the story so that it became a

00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:24.033
vehicle for the expression of
their own values and their own

00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:26.791
views.
In the Mesopotamian stories,

00:12:26.791 --> 00:12:29.521
for example,
the gods act capriciously,

00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:31.389
the gods act on a whim.
 

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:32.725
In fact, in one of the stories,
the gods say,

00:12:32.725 --> 00:12:33.604
"Oh, people,
they're so noisy,

00:12:33.604 --> 00:12:34.940
I can't sleep,
let's wipe them all out."

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.930
That's the rationale.
 

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.070
There's no moral scruple.
 

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.087
They destroy these helpless but
stoic humans who are chafing

00:12:41.087 --> 00:12:43.850
under their tyrannical and
unjust and uncaring rule.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.442
In the biblical story,
when the Israelites told the

00:12:46.442 --> 00:12:47.789
story, they modified it.
 

00:12:47.789 --> 00:12:51.139
It's God's uncompromising
ethical standards that lead him

00:12:51.139 --> 00:12:54.070
to bring the flood in an act of
divine justice.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.632
He's punishing the evil
corruption of human beings that

00:12:56.632 --> 00:12:59.528
he has so lovingly created and
whose degradation he can't bear

00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:01.289
to witness.
So it's saying something

00:13:01.289 --> 00:13:03.320
different.
It's providing a very different

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.459
message.
So when we compare the Bible

00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:08.114
with the literature of the
Ancient Near East,

00:13:08.114 --> 00:13:11.373
we'll see not only the
incredible cultural and literary

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:14.269
heritage that was obviously
common to them,

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:17.447
but we'll see the ideological
gulf that separated them and

00:13:17.447 --> 00:13:20.625
we'll see how biblical writers
so beautifully and cleverly

00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:22.799
manipulated and used these
stories,

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:26.417
as I said, as a vehicle for the
expression of a radically new

00:13:26.417 --> 00:13:28.560
idea.
They drew upon these sources

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.879
but they blended and shaped them
in a particular way.

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:35.863
And that brings us to a
critical problem facing anyone

00:13:35.863 --> 00:13:40.673
who seeks to reconstruct ancient
Israelite religion or culture on

00:13:40.673 --> 00:13:43.679
the basis of the biblical
materials.

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:48.355
That problem is the conflicting
perspective between the final

00:13:48.355 --> 00:13:52.796
editors of the text and some of
the older sources that are

00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:57.007
incorporated into the Bible,
some of the older sources that

00:13:57.007 --> 00:13:58.840
they were obviously drawing on.
 

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.616
Those who were responsible for
the final editing,

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:05.411
the final forms of the texts,
had a decidedly monotheistic

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:08.769
perspective, ethical
monotheistic perspective,

00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:11.939
and they attempted to impose
that perspective on their older

00:14:11.939 --> 00:14:14.661
source materials;
and for the most part they were

00:14:14.661 --> 00:14:17.019
successful.
But at times the result of

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:20.417
their effort is a deeply
conflicted, deeply ambiguous

00:14:20.417 --> 00:14:22.292
text.
And again, that's going to be

00:14:22.292 --> 00:14:25.090
one of the most fun things for
you as readers of this text,

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.233
if you're alert to it,
if you're ready to listen to

00:14:28.233 --> 00:14:31.440
the cacophony of voices that are
within the text.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.418
In many respects,
the Bible represents or

00:14:34.418 --> 00:14:38.810
expresses a basic discontent
with the larger cultural milieu

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.419
in which it was produced,
and that's interesting for us,

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:45.366
because a lot of modern people
have a tendency to think of the

00:14:45.366 --> 00:14:47.008
Bible as an emblem of
conservatism.

00:14:47.008 --> 00:14:49.152
Right?
We tend to think of this as an

00:14:49.152 --> 00:14:51.247
old fuddy-duddy document,
it's outdated,

00:14:51.247 --> 00:14:54.394
has outdated ideas,
and I think the challenge of

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:58.673
this course is that you read the
Bible with fresh eyes so that

00:14:58.673 --> 00:15:01.549
you can appreciate it for what
it was,

00:15:01.549 --> 00:15:05.782
in many ways what it continues
to be: a revolutionary,

00:15:05.782 --> 00:15:07.379
cultural critique.
 

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:10.880
We can read the Bible with
fresh and appreciative eyes only

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.777
if we first acknowledge and set
aside some of our

00:15:13.777 --> 00:15:15.950
presuppositions about the Bible.
 

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.496
It's really impossible,
in fact, that you not have some

00:15:18.496 --> 00:15:21.043
opinions about this work,
because it's an intimate part

00:15:21.043 --> 00:15:23.423
of our culture.
So even if you've never opened

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.093
it or read it yourself,
I bet you can cite me a line or

00:15:26.093 --> 00:15:28.812
two--"an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth," and I bet

00:15:28.812 --> 00:15:30.840
you don't really know what it
means.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.972
"The poor will always be with
you": I'm sure you don't really

00:15:32.972 --> 00:15:33.789
know what that means.
 

00:15:33.789 --> 00:15:36.649
These are things and phrases
that we hear and they create

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:39.765
within us a certain impression
of the biblical text and how it

00:15:39.765 --> 00:15:41.593
functions.
Verses are quoted,

00:15:41.593 --> 00:15:44.500
they're alluded to,
whether to be championed and

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.840
valorized or whether to be
lampooned and pilloried.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.013
But we can feel that we have a
rough idea of the Bible and a

00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:54.294
rough idea of its outlook when
in fact what we really have are

00:15:54.294 --> 00:15:57.682
popular misconceptions that come
from the way in which the Bible

00:15:57.682 --> 00:15:59.350
has been used or misused.
 

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.589
Most of our cherished
presuppositions about the Bible

00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:06.451
are based on astonishing claims
that others have made on behalf

00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:09.223
of the Bible,
claims that the Bible has not

00:16:09.223 --> 00:16:10.759
made on behalf of itself.
 

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:13.939
So before we proceed,
I need to ask you to set aside

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:17.743
for the purposes of this course,
some of the more common myths

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:21.727
about the Bible.
I have a little list here for

00:16:21.727 --> 00:16:24.241
you.
The first is the idea that the

00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:27.020
Bible's a book.
It's not a book.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.080
We'll get rid of that one.
 

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.093
The Bible is not a book with
all that that implies,

00:16:32.093 --> 00:16:35.950
that it has a uniform style and
a message and a single author,

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.443
the sorts of things we think of
when we think in a conventional

00:16:38.443 --> 00:16:39.530
sense of the word "book."
 

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.841
It's a library.
It's an anthology of writings

00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:47.756
or books written and edited over
an extensive period of time by

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:51.103
people in very different
situations responding to very

00:16:51.103 --> 00:16:54.166
different issues and stimuli,
some political,

00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:56.306
some historical,
some philosophical,

00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:58.139
some religious,
some moral.

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:02.539
There are many types or genres
of material in the Bible.

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:05.140
There's narrative,
wonderful narrative stories.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.529
There's all kinds of law.
 

00:17:06.529 --> 00:17:09.247
There are cultic and ritual
texts that prescribe how some

00:17:09.247 --> 00:17:11.140
ceremony is supposed to be
performed.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.220
There are records of the
messages of prophets.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.484
There's lyric poetry,
there's love poetry,

00:17:16.484 --> 00:17:19.510
there are proverbs,
there are psalms of

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.740
thanksgiving and lament.
 

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.236
So, there's a tremendous
variety of material in this

00:17:25.236 --> 00:17:29.624
library, and it follows from the
fact that it's not a book but an

00:17:29.624 --> 00:17:33.813
anthology of diverse works,
that it's not an ideological

00:17:33.813 --> 00:17:35.727
monolith.
And this is something a lot of

00:17:35.727 --> 00:17:36.670
students struggle with.
 

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.297
Each book, or strand of
tradition within a book,

00:17:40.297 --> 00:17:45.006
within the biblical collection
sounds its own distinctive note

00:17:45.006 --> 00:17:49.019
in the symphony of reflection
that is the Bible.

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:52.687
Genesis is concerned to account
for the origin of things and

00:17:52.687 --> 00:17:55.049
wrestles with the existence of
evil,

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:58.647
the existence of idolatry and
suffering in a world that's

00:17:58.647 --> 00:18:00.190
created by a good god.
 

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.566
The priestly texts in Leviticus
and Numbers emphasize the

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:07.003
sanctity of all life and the
ideal of holiness and ethical

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.329
and ritual purity.
 

00:18:08.329 --> 00:18:12.176
There are odes to human reason
and learning and endeavor in the

00:18:12.176 --> 00:18:13.789
wisdom book of Proverbs.
 

00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:17.794
Ecclesiastes reads like an
existentialist writing from the

00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:19.200
twentieth century.
 

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.674
It scoffs at the vanity of all
things, including wisdom,

00:18:22.674 --> 00:18:25.769
and espouses a kind of positive
existentialism.

00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:28.732
The Psalms are very individual
writings that focus on

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:31.410
individual piety and love and
worship of God.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.024
Job, possibly the greatest book
of the Bible,

00:18:34.024 --> 00:18:36.460
I won't give away my
preferences there,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.655
challenges conventional
religious piety and arrives at

00:18:39.655 --> 00:18:43.153
the bittersweet conclusion that
there is no justice in this

00:18:43.153 --> 00:18:46.507
world or any other,
but that nonetheless we're not

00:18:46.507 --> 00:18:50.443
excused from the thankless and
perhaps ultimately meaningless

00:18:50.443 --> 00:18:52.279
task of righteous living.
 

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:55.880
One of the most wonderful and
fortuitous facts of history is

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.481
that later Jewish communities
chose to put all this stuff in

00:18:59.481 --> 00:19:01.799
this collection we call the
Bible.

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:04.579
They chose to include all of
these dissonant voices together.

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:08.866
They didn't strive to reconcile
the conflicts,

00:19:08.866 --> 00:19:11.880
nor should we.
They didn't, we shouldn't.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.180
Each book, each writer,
each voice reflects another

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.480
thread in the rich tapestry of
human experience,

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.415
human response to life and its
puzzles, human reflection on the

00:19:22.415 --> 00:19:24.130
sublime and the depraved.
 

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:28.757
And that leads me to my second
point, which is that biblical

00:19:28.757 --> 00:19:32.600
narratives are not pious
parables about saints.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.900
Okay?
Not pious tales.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.180
They're psychologically real
literature about very real or

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.109
realistic people and life
situations.

00:19:43.109 --> 00:19:46.475
They're not stories about pious
people whose actions are always

00:19:46.475 --> 00:19:49.569
exemplary and whose lives should
be models for our own,

00:19:49.569 --> 00:19:53.881
despite what Sunday School
curricula will often turn them

00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:56.119
into.
And despite what they would

00:19:56.119 --> 00:19:58.415
have us believe.
There is a genre of

00:19:58.415 --> 00:20:00.442
literature that details the
lives of saints,

00:20:00.442 --> 00:20:02.755
Hagiography,
but that came later and is

00:20:02.755 --> 00:20:05.720
largely something we find in the
Christian era.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.029
It's not found in the Bible.
 

00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:11.159
The Bible abounds with human
not superhuman beings,

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:14.380
and their behavior can be
scandalous.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.546
It can be violent,
it can be rebellious,

00:20:17.546 --> 00:20:19.819
outrageous, lewd,
vicious.

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:23.905
But at the same time like real
people, they can turn around and

00:20:23.905 --> 00:20:27.859
act in a way that is loyal and
true above and beyond the call

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:30.319
of duty.
They can change, they can grow.

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:33.223
But it's interesting to me that
there are many people who,

00:20:33.223 --> 00:20:35.413
when they open the Bible for
the first time,

00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:37.400
they close it in shock and
disgust.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.176
Jacob is a deceiver;
Joseph is an arrogant,

00:20:41.176 --> 00:20:43.155
spoiled brat;
Judah reneges on his

00:20:43.155 --> 00:20:45.119
obligations to his
daughter-in-law and goes off and

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.220
sleeps with a prostitute.
 

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.420
Who are these people?
 

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.119
Why are they in the Bible?
 

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:51.826
And the shock comes from the
expectation that the heroes of

00:20:51.826 --> 00:20:54.440
the Bible are somehow being held
up as perfect people.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.450
That's just not a claim that's
made by the Bible itself.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.993
So biblical characters are real
people with real,

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:03.750
compelling moral conflicts and
ambitions and desires,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.400
and they can act shortsightedly
and selfishly.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.116
But they can also,
like real people,

00:21:08.116 --> 00:21:11.281
learn and grow and change;
and if we work too hard and too

00:21:11.281 --> 00:21:14.748
quickly to vindicate biblical
characters just because they're

00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:16.944
in the Bible,
then we miss all the good

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:19.008
stuff.
We miss all of the moral

00:21:19.008 --> 00:21:21.747
sophistication,
the deep psychological insights

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:25.200
that have made these stories of
such timeless interest.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.207
So read it like you would read
any good book with a really good

00:21:28.207 --> 00:21:30.682
author who knows how to make
some really interesting

00:21:30.682 --> 00:21:34.445
characters.
Thirdly, the Bible's not for

00:21:34.445 --> 00:21:36.187
children.
I have a 12-year-old and an

00:21:36.187 --> 00:21:38.760
8-year-old.
I won't let them read it.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.430
I won't let them read it.
 

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.579
Those "Bible Stories for
Children" books,

00:21:42.579 --> 00:21:45.260
they scare me.
They really scare me.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.640
It's not suitable for children.
 

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.339
The subject matter in the Bible
is very adult,

00:21:49.339 --> 00:21:51.619
particularly in the narrative
texts.

00:21:51.619 --> 00:21:55.000
There are episodes of treachery
and incest and murder and rape.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.360
And the Bible is not for naive
optimists.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.619
It's hard-hitting stuff.
 

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:03.476
And it speaks to those who are
courageous enough to acknowledge

00:22:03.476 --> 00:22:07.208
that life is rife with pain and
conflict, just as it's filled

00:22:07.208 --> 00:22:08.950
with compassion and joy.
 

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.710
It's not for children in
another sense.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.006
Like any literary masterpiece,
the Bible is characterized by a

00:22:15.006 --> 00:22:19.302
sophistication of structure and
style and an artistry of theme

00:22:19.302 --> 00:22:21.518
and metaphor,
and believe me,

00:22:21.518 --> 00:22:24.370
that's lost on adult readers
quite often.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.829
It makes its readers work.
 

00:22:25.829 --> 00:22:29.480
The Bible doesn't moralize,
or rarely, rarely moralizes.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.008
It explores moral issues and
situations, puts people in moral

00:22:33.008 --> 00:22:34.420
issues and situations.
 

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.079
The conclusions have to be
drawn by the reader.

00:22:37.079 --> 00:22:39.736
There are also all kinds of
paradoxes and subtle puns and

00:22:39.736 --> 00:22:42.488
ironies, and in section where
you'll be doing a lot of your

00:22:42.488 --> 00:22:44.712
close reading work,
those are some of the things

00:22:44.712 --> 00:22:46.250
that will be drawn to your
attention.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.809
You'll really begin to
appreciate them in time.

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:54.211
The fourth myth we want to get
rid of: the Bible is not a book

00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:57.458
of theology, it's not a
catechism or a book of

00:22:57.458 --> 00:22:59.190
systematic theology.
 

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.272
It's not a manual of religion,
despite the fact that at a much

00:23:03.272 --> 00:23:07.555
later time, very complex systems
of theology are going to be spun

00:23:07.555 --> 00:23:11.369
from particular interpretations
of biblical passages.

00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:13.946
You know, there's nothing in
the Bible that really

00:23:13.946 --> 00:23:17.259
corresponds to prevailing modern
western notions of religion,

00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:20.210
what we call religion,
and indeed there's no word for

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.819
religion in the language of
biblical Hebrew.

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:25.220
There just isn't a word
"religion."

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.521
With the rise of Christianity,
western religion came to be

00:23:29.521 --> 00:23:33.220
defined to a large degree by the
confession of,

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.892
or the intellectual assent to,
certain doctrinal points of

00:23:37.892 --> 00:23:40.086
belief.
Religion became defined

00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:43.569
primarily as a set of beliefs,
a catechism of beliefs or

00:23:43.569 --> 00:23:45.849
truths that required your
assent,

00:23:45.849 --> 00:23:48.316
what I think of as the
catechism kind of notion of

00:23:48.316 --> 00:23:51.162
religion.
That's entirely alien to the

00:23:51.162 --> 00:23:52.799
world of the Bible.
 

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:56.659
It's clear that in biblical
times and in the Ancient Near

00:23:56.659 --> 00:23:59.347
East generally,
religion wasn't a set of

00:23:59.347 --> 00:24:01.759
doctrines that you ascribed to.
 

00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:04.892
To become an Israelite,
later on a Jew--the word "Jew"

00:24:04.892 --> 00:24:08.262
isn't something we can really
historically use until about

00:24:08.262 --> 00:24:10.311
this time,
so most of our period we're

00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:13.071
going to be talking about the
ancient Israelites--to become an

00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:15.244
Israelite,
you simply joined the Israelite

00:24:15.244 --> 00:24:17.185
community, you lived an
Israelite life,

00:24:17.185 --> 00:24:18.769
you died an Israelite death.
 

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:22.304
You obeyed Israelite law and
custom, you revered Israelite

00:24:22.304 --> 00:24:25.776
lore, you entered into the
historical community of Israel

00:24:25.776 --> 00:24:29.619
by accepting that their fate and
yours should be the same.

00:24:29.619 --> 00:24:31.660
It was sort of a process of
naturalization,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.750
what we think of today as
naturalization.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:37.289
So the Hebrew Bible just isn't
a theological textbook.

00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:40.494
It contains a lot of narratives
and its narrative materials are

00:24:40.494 --> 00:24:42.768
an account of the odyssey of a
people,

00:24:42.768 --> 00:24:44.059
the nation of Israel.
 

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:48.082
They're not an account of the
divine, which is what theology

00:24:48.082 --> 00:24:50.400
means, an account of the divine.
 

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.783
However, having said this,
I should add that although the

00:24:53.783 --> 00:24:57.288
Bible doesn't contain formal
statements of religious belief

00:24:57.288 --> 00:25:00.096
or systematic theology,
it treats issues,

00:25:00.096 --> 00:25:03.766
many moral issues and some
existential issues that are

00:25:03.766 --> 00:25:07.019
central to the later discipline
of theology,

00:25:07.019 --> 00:25:09.279
but it treats them very
differently.

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:12.220
Its treatment of these issues
is indirect, it's implicit.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.268
It uses the language of story
and song and poetry and paradox

00:25:16.268 --> 00:25:19.587
and metaphor.
It uses a language and a style

00:25:19.587 --> 00:25:23.510
that's very far from the
language and style of later

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.279
philosophy and abstract
theology.

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:31.203
Finally, on our myth count,
I would point out--well I don't

00:25:31.203 --> 00:25:36.569
really need to cross this out,
this is something to discuss--I

00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:41.868
would point out that the Bible
was formulated and assembled and

00:25:41.868 --> 00:25:47.337
edited and modified and censored
and transmitted first orally and

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:50.500
then in writing by human beings.
 

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.049
The Bible itself doesn't claim
to have been written by God.

00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:57.359
That belief is a religious
doctrine of a much later age.

00:25:57.359 --> 00:26:00.142
And even then one wonders how
literally it was meant--it's

00:26:00.142 --> 00:26:03.119
interesting to go back and look
at some of the earliest claims

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:05.170
about the origin of the biblical
text.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.091
Similarly, the so-called five
books of Moses--Genesis,

00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:09.690
Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers,

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.993
Deuteronomy,
the first five books we call

00:26:11.993 --> 00:26:15.507
the Pentateuch of Moses--nowhere
claim to have been written in

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:17.119
their entirety by Moses.
 

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:19.329
That's not something they say
themselves.

00:26:19.329 --> 00:26:21.638
Some laws in Exodus,
you know, the Book of the

00:26:21.638 --> 00:26:24.819
Covenant, a few things--yes,
it says Moses wrote those down,

00:26:24.819 --> 00:26:28.461
but not the whole five books
that tradition later will

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:31.509
ascribe to him.
The Bible clearly had many

00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:35.197
contributors over many
centuries, and the individual

00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:38.089
styles and concerns of those
writers,

00:26:38.089 --> 00:26:42.211
their political and religious
motivations, betray themselves

00:26:42.211 --> 00:26:45.044
frequently.
I leave aside here the question

00:26:45.044 --> 00:26:48.334
of divine inspiration,
which is an article of faith in

00:26:48.334 --> 00:26:50.009
many biblical religions.
 

00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:54.356
It's no doubt an article of
faith for people in this very

00:26:54.356 --> 00:26:56.201
room.
But there is no basic

00:26:56.201 --> 00:26:59.610
incompatibility between
believing on faith in the divine

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.019
inspiration of the Bible and
acknowledging the role that

00:27:03.019 --> 00:27:06.800
human beings have played in the
actual formulation and editing

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.519
and transmission and
preservation of that same Bible.

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:13.805
And since this is a university
course and not perhaps a

00:27:13.805 --> 00:27:17.029
theological course or within a
theological setting,

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:21.440
it's really only the latter,
the demonstrably human

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.440
component, that will concern us.
 

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.787
It's very easy for me to assert
that our interest in the Hebrew

00:27:28.787 --> 00:27:32.994
Bible will be centered on the
culture and the history and the

00:27:32.994 --> 00:27:37.201
literature and the religious
thought of ancient Israel in all

00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:41.900
of its diversity rather than
questions of faith and theology.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.046
But the fact remains that the
document is the basis for the

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:48.464
religious faith of many millions
of people, and some of them are

00:27:48.464 --> 00:27:51.208
here now.
It is inevitable that you will

00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:55.149
bring what you learn in this
course into dialogue with your

00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:58.746
own personal religious beliefs,
and for some of you,

00:27:58.746 --> 00:28:01.577
I hope all of you,
that will be enriching and

00:28:01.577 --> 00:28:03.620
exciting.
For some of you it may be

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.946
difficult.
I know that,

00:28:04.946 --> 00:28:08.521
and I want you to rest assured
that no one in this course

00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:12.225
wishes to undermine or malign
religious faith any more than

00:28:12.225 --> 00:28:16.119
they wish to promote or
proselytize for religious faith.

00:28:16.119 --> 00:28:20.119
Religious faith simply isn't
the topic of this course.

00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:24.305
The rich history and literature
and religious thought of ancient

00:28:24.305 --> 00:28:28.358
Israel as preserved for us over
millennia in the pages of this

00:28:28.358 --> 00:28:30.914
remarkable volume,
that is our topic,

00:28:30.914 --> 00:28:34.380
and so our approach is going to
be necessarily academic;

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.752
and especially given the
diversity of people in this

00:28:36.752 --> 00:28:38.660
room, that's really all that it
can be,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.207
so that we have a common ground
and common goals for our

00:28:42.207 --> 00:28:45.363
discussions.
But it has been my experience

00:28:45.363 --> 00:28:50.103
that from time to time students
will raise a question or ask a

00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:53.599
question that is prompted by a
commitment,

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:56.130
a prior commitment to an
article of faith.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.430
Sometimes they're not even
aware that that's what they're

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.258
doing, and I want you to
understand that on those

00:29:02.258 --> 00:29:05.323
occasions I'll most likely
respond by inviting you to

00:29:05.323 --> 00:29:08.799
consider the article of faith
that lies behind that question

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:12.099
and is creating that particular
problem for you.

00:29:12.099 --> 00:29:15.549
I'm not going to be drawn into
a philosophical or theological

00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:17.849
debate over the merits of that
belief,

00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:21.070
but I'll simply point out how
or why that belief might be

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.579
making it difficult for you to
read or accept what the text is

00:29:24.579 --> 00:29:28.049
actually and not ideally saying,
and leave you to think about

00:29:28.049 --> 00:29:29.703
that.
And I see those as wonderful

00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:31.539
learning opportunities for the
class.

00:29:31.539 --> 00:29:34.150
Those are in no way a problem
for me.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.495
All right, so let's give a few
sort of necessary facts and

00:29:37.495 --> 00:29:41.193
figures now about the Bible and
then I need to talk a little bit

00:29:41.193 --> 00:29:43.599
about the organization of the
course.

00:29:43.599 --> 00:29:46.069
So those are the last two
things we really need to do.

00:29:46.069 --> 00:29:47.859
An overview of the structure of
the Bible.

00:29:47.859 --> 00:29:51.085
So you have a couple of
handouts that should help you

00:29:51.085 --> 00:29:52.987
here.
So, the Bible is this

00:29:52.987 --> 00:29:57.320
assemblage of books and writings
dating from approximately 1000

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.443
BCE--we're going to hear very
diverse opinions about how far

00:30:01.443 --> 00:30:04.868
back this stuff dates--down to
the second century:

00:30:04.868 --> 00:30:09.061
the last book within the Hebrew
Bible was written in the 160s

00:30:09.061 --> 00:30:11.655
BCE.
Some of these books which we

00:30:11.655 --> 00:30:14.966
think are roughly from a certain
date, they will contain

00:30:14.966 --> 00:30:18.277
narrative snippets or legal
materials or oral traditions

00:30:18.277 --> 00:30:21.950
that may even date back or
stretch back further in time,

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.349
and they were perhaps
transmitted orally and then

00:30:24.349 --> 00:30:26.049
ended up in these written forms.
 

00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:30.214
The Bible is written largely in
Hebrew, hence the name Hebrew

00:30:30.214 --> 00:30:32.464
Bible.
There are a few passages in

00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:34.475
Aramaic.
So you have a handout that

00:30:34.475 --> 00:30:36.700
breaks down the three major
components.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.450
It's the one that's written two
columns per page.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:40.480
Okay?
 

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.430
 
 

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.220
We're going to talk in a minute
about those three sections,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.240
so you want to have that handy.
 

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.369
 
 

00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:54.910
These writings have had a
profound and lasting impact on

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.936
three world religions:
Judaism, Christianity and

00:30:57.936 --> 00:31:00.296
Islam.
For the Jewish communities who

00:31:00.296 --> 00:31:03.500
first compiled these writings in
the pre-Christian era,

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.328
the Bible was perhaps first and
foremost a record of God's

00:31:07.328 --> 00:31:10.150
eternal covenant with the Jewish
people.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.260
So Jews refer to the Bible as
the Tanakh.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.430
It's the term you see up here.
 

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.370
It should be also on that
sheet, Tanakh,

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.287
which is really the letter "t",
"n" and "kh",

00:31:21.287 --> 00:31:24.702
and they've put little "a's" in
there to make it easy to

00:31:24.702 --> 00:31:26.550
pronounce,
because kh is hard to

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.640
pronounce, so Tanach.
 

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.740
Okay?
And this is an acronym.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.392
The T stands for Torah,
which is a word that means

00:31:35.392 --> 00:31:37.330
instruction or teaching.
 

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.539
It's often translated "law";
I think that's a very poor

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:41.409
translation.
It means instruction,

00:31:41.409 --> 00:31:43.788
way, teaching,
and that refers to the first

00:31:43.788 --> 00:31:46.677
five books that you see listed
here, Genesis through

00:31:46.677 --> 00:31:49.212
Deuteronomy.
The second division of the

00:31:49.212 --> 00:31:51.509
Bible is referred to as
Nevi'im,

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:54.109
which is the Hebrew word for
"prophets."

00:31:54.109 --> 00:31:57.032
The section of the Prophets is
divided really into two parts,

00:31:57.032 --> 00:32:00.052
because there are two types of
writing in the prophetic section

00:32:00.052 --> 00:32:02.400
of the Bible.
The first or former Prophets

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.766
continues the kind of narrative
prose account of the history of

00:32:05.766 --> 00:32:08.970
Israel, focusing on the
activities of Israel's prophets.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.306
All right?
So, the Former Prophets are

00:32:12.306 --> 00:32:16.196
narrative texts.
The Latter Prophets are poetic

00:32:16.196 --> 00:32:20.818
and oracular writings that bear
the name of the prophet to whom

00:32:20.818 --> 00:32:22.980
the writings are ascribed.
 

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.251
You have the three major
prophets, Isaiah,

00:32:25.251 --> 00:32:27.799
Jeremiah and Ezekiel,
and then the twelve minor

00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:30.272
prophets,
which in the Hebrew Bible get

00:32:30.272 --> 00:32:33.776
counted together as one book,
because those twelve are very

00:32:33.776 --> 00:32:35.742
small.
The final section of the Bible

00:32:35.742 --> 00:32:38.635
is referred to as Ketuvim
in Hebrew, which simply means

00:32:38.635 --> 00:32:40.339
"Writings,"
and that's probably about 50%

00:32:40.339 --> 00:32:42.310
of the Hebrew you're going to
get in the whole course,

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.569
so please don't be scared.
 

00:32:43.569 --> 00:32:45.823
You know, I've got two or three
other terms that'll be useful

00:32:45.823 --> 00:32:47.438
along the way,
but there's really no need to

00:32:47.438 --> 00:32:49.702
know Hebrew.
I just want you to understand

00:32:49.702 --> 00:32:52.913
why Tanakh is the word
that's used to refer to the

00:32:52.913 --> 00:32:54.306
Bible.
So the Ketuvim,

00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:55.980
or the Writings,
are really a miscellany.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.651
They contain works of various
types, and the three parts

00:32:59.651 --> 00:33:03.389
correspond very roughly to the
process of canonization or

00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:06.059
authoritativeness for the
community.

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:09.987
The Torah probably reached a
fixed and authoritative status

00:33:09.987 --> 00:33:13.509
first, then the books of the
Prophets and finally the

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:16.211
Writings.
And probably by the end of the

00:33:16.211 --> 00:33:18.761
first century,
all of this was organized in

00:33:18.761 --> 00:33:20.769
some way.
If you look at the other

00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:23.486
handout, you'll see,
however, that any course on the

00:33:23.486 --> 00:33:26.258
Bible is going to run
immediately into the problem of

00:33:26.258 --> 00:33:29.819
defining the object of study,
because different Bibles served

00:33:29.819 --> 00:33:32.190
different communities over the
centuries.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:35.683
One of the earliest
translations of the Hebrew Bible

00:33:35.683 --> 00:33:39.450
was a translation into Greek
known as the Septuagint.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.780
It was written for the
benefit--it was translated for

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.604
the benefit of Jews who lived in
Alexandria--Greek-speaking Jews

00:33:44.604 --> 00:33:48.749
who lived in Alexandria,
Egypt in the Hellenistic period

00:33:48.749 --> 00:33:53.410
somewhere around the third or
second century BCE.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:57.363
The translation has some
divergences with the traditional

00:33:57.363 --> 00:34:00.539
Hebrew text of the Bible as we
now have it,

00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:03.077
including the order of the
books, and some of these things

00:34:03.077 --> 00:34:05.569
are charted for you on the chart
that I've handed out.

00:34:05.569 --> 00:34:10.340
The Septuagint's rationale for
ordering the books is temporal.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.771
They've clustered books Genesis
through Esther,

00:34:13.771 --> 00:34:17.550
which tell of things past;
the books of Job through the

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.870
Song of Songs or the Song of
Solomon contain wisdom that

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.728
applies to the present;
and then the prophetic books,

00:34:24.728 --> 00:34:28.120
Isaiah to Malachi,
contain or tell of things

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.638
future.
Some copies of the Septuagint

00:34:30.638 --> 00:34:34.392
contain some books not included
in the Hebrew canon but accepted

00:34:34.392 --> 00:34:36.300
in the early Christian canon.
 

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.802
The Septuagint,
the Greek translation,

00:34:38.802 --> 00:34:42.050
became by and large the Bible
of Christianity,

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:45.544
or more precisely it became the
"Old Testament" of the Hebrew

00:34:45.544 --> 00:34:48.120
Bible.
The church adopted the Hebrew

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.269
Bible as a precursor to its
largely Hellenistic gospels.

00:34:52.269 --> 00:34:55.730
It was an important association
for it, with an old and

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.139
respected tradition.
 

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:01.295
Our primary concern is the
Bible of the ancient Israelite

00:35:01.295 --> 00:35:05.599
and Jewish community--the 24
books grouped in the Torah,

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:09.463
Prophets and Writings on that
other sheet--which is common to

00:35:09.463 --> 00:35:11.671
all Bibles.
Whether Jewish or Christian,

00:35:11.671 --> 00:35:13.630
those 24 are the baseline
common books.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.210
So those are the 24 that we're
going to focus on.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:19.187
Because the term "Old
Testament" is a theologically

00:35:19.187 --> 00:35:22.581
loaded term, it sort of suggests
the doctrine that the New

00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:26.213
Testament has somehow fulfilled
or surpassed or antiquated the

00:35:26.213 --> 00:35:29.265
Bible of ancient Israel,
you're going to hear me refer

00:35:29.265 --> 00:35:31.360
to the object of our study as
the Hebrew Bible.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.467
You may certainly use any other
term, and you may certainly use

00:35:34.467 --> 00:35:36.979
the term Old Testament,
as long as it's clear we're

00:35:36.979 --> 00:35:39.731
talking about this set of 24
books and not some of the other

00:35:39.731 --> 00:35:42.250
things that are in the Old
Testament that aren't in the

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.650
traditional Hebrew Bible.
 

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.070
It means you're studying less,
so that might be a good thing.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.873
So, it's fine with me if you
want to use that but I will

00:35:49.873 --> 00:35:52.269
prefer the more accurate term
"Hebrew Bible."

00:35:52.269 --> 00:35:55.781
Also while we're on
terminology, you'll notice that

00:35:55.781 --> 00:36:00.205
I use BCE to refer to the period
before 0 and CE to refer to the

00:36:00.205 --> 00:36:02.989
period after 0;
the Common Era and Before the

00:36:02.989 --> 00:36:06.139
Common Era, and in a lot of your
secondary readings and writings

00:36:06.139 --> 00:36:07.889
they'll be using the same thing.
 

00:36:07.889 --> 00:36:11.102
It corresponds to what you know
as BC, Before Christ,

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:13.820
and Anno Domini,
AD, the year of our Lord.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.915
It's just a
non-Christian-centric way of

00:36:15.915 --> 00:36:18.923
dating and in a lot of your
secondary readings you'll see

00:36:18.923 --> 00:36:21.162
it,
so you should get used to it:

00:36:21.162 --> 00:36:24.630
BCE and CE, Before the Common
Era and the Common Era.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.062
From earliest times,
Christians made use of the

00:36:27.062 --> 00:36:29.760
Bible but almost always in its
Greek translation,

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.576
and the Christian Old Testament
contains some material not in

00:36:32.576 --> 00:36:34.360
the Hebrew Bible,
as I've mentioned.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.005
And some of these works are
referred to as the Apocrypha--so

00:36:37.005 --> 00:36:38.440
you will have heard that term.
 

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.325
These are writings that were
composed somewhere around here,

00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:44.170
sort of 200 BCE to 100 CE.
 

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.199
They were widely used by Jews
of the period.

00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:49.817
They simply weren't considered
to be of the same status as the

00:36:49.817 --> 00:36:52.307
24 books.
I'm glad they pick up the

00:36:52.307 --> 00:36:55.909
garbage at 11:10 [laughs]
on Wednesday mornings.

00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:59.245
But they did become part of the
canon of Catholic Christianity

00:36:59.245 --> 00:37:02.453
and in the sixteenth century,
their canonical status was

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.489
confirmed for the Catholic
Church.

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.383
With the Renaissance and the
Reformation, some Christians

00:37:07.383 --> 00:37:10.070
became interested in Hebrew
versions of the Bible.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:13.176
They wanted to look at the
Hebrew and not the Greek

00:37:13.176 --> 00:37:15.039
translation from the Hebrew.
 

00:37:15.039 --> 00:37:17.223
Protestants,
the Protestant church,

00:37:17.223 --> 00:37:20.820
denied canonical status to the
books of the Apocrypha.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.712
They said they were important
for pious instruction but

00:37:23.712 --> 00:37:25.480
excluded them from their canon.
 

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.094
There are also some works you
may know of, referred to as the

00:37:28.094 --> 00:37:30.883
Pseudepigrapha--we'll talk about
some of these things in a little

00:37:30.883 --> 00:37:33.150
more detail later--from roughly
the same period;

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.918
tend to be a little more
apocalyptic in nature,

00:37:35.918 --> 00:37:39.710
and they were never part of the
Jewish or the Catholic canon,

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.541
but there are some eastern
Christian groups that have

00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:44.230
accepted them in their canon.
 

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:48.142
The point I'm trying to make is
that there are very many sacred

00:37:48.142 --> 00:37:51.740
canons out there that are
cherished by very many religious

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.288
communities,
and they're all designated

00:37:54.288 --> 00:37:56.593
"Bibles."
So again, we're focusing on

00:37:56.593 --> 00:38:00.021
that core set of 24 books that
are common to all Bibles

00:38:00.021 --> 00:38:02.608
everywhere,
the 24 books of what would in

00:38:02.608 --> 00:38:04.599
fact be the Jewish
Tanakh.

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:08.066
Not only has there been variety
regarding the scope of the

00:38:08.066 --> 00:38:10.619
biblical canon in different
communities,

00:38:10.619 --> 00:38:14.420
but there's been some fluidity
in the actual text itself.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.775
We don't, of course,
have any original copies of

00:38:17.775 --> 00:38:22.130
these materials as they came off
the pen of whoever it was who

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:25.416
was writing them,
and in fact before the middle

00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:28.558
of the twentieth century,
our oldest manuscripts and

00:38:28.558 --> 00:38:32.440
fragments of manuscripts of the
Bible dated to the year 900.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:38.042
That's an awful long distance
from the events they're talking

00:38:38.042 --> 00:38:39.711
about.
And we've got to think about

00:38:39.711 --> 00:38:41.159
that, right?
You've got to think about that

00:38:41.159 --> 00:38:43.199
and what it means and how were
they transmitted and preserved

00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:46.480
without the means of technology,
obviously, that we have today;

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.884
and what was so exciting in the
middle of the twentieth century

00:38:49.884 --> 00:38:52.300
was the discovery of the Dead
Sea Scrolls.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.349
I'm sure that you've heard of
them.

00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:58.782
They brought about a dramatic
change in the state of our

00:38:58.782 --> 00:39:02.489
knowledge of our Hebrew
manuscript evidence.

00:39:02.489 --> 00:39:06.940
The Dead Sea Scrolls were found
in caves in the Judean desert.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.036
We used to think they were a
library of a sectarian

00:39:09.036 --> 00:39:11.257
community;
now I think they think it was a

00:39:11.257 --> 00:39:12.920
pottery factory or something.
 

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.781
So maybe they were just shoved
there by people fleeing the

00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:18.340
Roman conquest in 70.
 

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.400
So that's up for grabs.
 

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.059
But we have this really great
collection of scrolls,

00:39:24.059 --> 00:39:29.540
and among them we have found an
almost complete copy of every

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.550
book of the Bible.
 

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.882
Sorry--almost complete copy of
the Book of Isaiah and then

00:39:34.882 --> 00:39:38.156
partial copies or fragments of
all of the biblical books,

00:39:38.156 --> 00:39:39.560
except maybe Esther.
 

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.380
Am I wrong about that?
 

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.995
I don't think there's an Esther
from Qumran, I think that's the

00:39:42.995 --> 00:39:45.435
only one.
And some of them date back to

00:39:45.435 --> 00:39:47.480
the fourth and third century.
 

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.150
So do you understand now why
everybody was so excited?

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.297
Suddenly, we have evidence,
thirteen or fourteen hundred

00:39:53.297 --> 00:39:55.758
years earlier,
that people were reading this

00:39:55.758 --> 00:39:57.399
stuff and,
by and large,

00:39:57.399 --> 00:40:00.110
it's a pretty constant textual
tradition.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.489
Sure there are differences,
sure there are differences.

00:40:02.489 --> 00:40:05.177
We see that our manuscripts are
not exactly like those

00:40:05.177 --> 00:40:07.510
fragments, but there is a
remarkable degree,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:11.254
a high degree of correspondence
so that we really can speak of a

00:40:11.254 --> 00:40:14.167
relatively stable textual
tradition but still some

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:15.947
fluidity.
And that's going to be

00:40:15.947 --> 00:40:17.550
interesting for us to think
about.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:21.405
There are many translations of
the Bible, but I would like you

00:40:21.405 --> 00:40:25.260
to purchase for this course the
Jewish Study Bible .

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.206
So let me turn now to just some
of the administrative,

00:40:28.206 --> 00:40:31.485
organizational details of the
course, the secondary readings

00:40:31.485 --> 00:40:32.820
that we'll be using.
 

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.880
 
 

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.249
I'm asking you to pick up the
Jewish Study Bible not

00:40:38.249 --> 00:40:40.210
only for the translation of the
Tanakh,

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:43.348
which is a very good
translation, but because it

00:40:43.348 --> 00:40:46.820
contains wonderful scholarly
articles in the back.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.139
It used to be we had a course
packet for this course that was

00:40:50.139 --> 00:40:52.849
two volumes, and now with the
purchase of this,

00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:56.980
I've been able to really
consolidate the readings.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.647
They're really wonderful;
great introductions to the

00:40:59.647 --> 00:41:03.238
individual books of the Bible
and so I think you will find

00:41:03.238 --> 00:41:06.640
that this will become like a
Bible to you [laughs].

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.630
So you need to pick that up.
 

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.000
It's at the Yale bookstore.
 

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.203
I also would like you to pick
up this paperback,

00:41:11.203 --> 00:41:12.610
it's not terribly expensive.
 

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.399
We're going to be using it in
the first few weeks especially:

00:41:15.399 --> 00:41:16.840
The Ancient Near East.
 

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:20.468
Other readings,
the secondary readings for the

00:41:20.468 --> 00:41:23.130
course, are all already online.
 

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.987
I will be also making them
available at Allegra for people

00:41:25.987 --> 00:41:29.096
who would like to just purchase
them already printed out so you

00:41:29.096 --> 00:41:31.898
don't do it yourself,
but I know some people really

00:41:31.898 --> 00:41:34.942
prefer to work online--and
certainly for the first week of

00:41:34.942 --> 00:41:37.022
reading,
you can get started because it

00:41:37.022 --> 00:41:39.155
is online.
I don't think things will be

00:41:39.155 --> 00:41:42.440
available at Allegra's until
probably tomorrow afternoon.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.276
The syllabus.
As you can see,

00:41:45.276 --> 00:41:47.723
it's a pretty thick syllabus,
but it's divided into a

00:41:47.723 --> 00:41:50.360
schedule of lectures and then a
schedule of readings.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.701
All right?
So, understand that there are

00:41:51.701 --> 00:41:52.699
two distinct things there.
 

00:41:52.699 --> 00:41:54.559
It's not just all the scheduled
lectures.

00:41:54.559 --> 00:41:57.920
The last few pages are a
schedule of the actual readings,

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.400
and the assignment that you'll
have for the weekend and for

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.579
next week's lectures are the
readings by Kaufman.

00:42:04.579 --> 00:42:07.386
I really, really need you to
read that before the next class,

00:42:07.386 --> 00:42:09.210
and I want you to read it
critically.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:12.579
Kaufman's ideas are important,
but they are also overstated,

00:42:12.579 --> 00:42:15.320
and so they're going to be
interesting for us.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.821
We're going to wrestle with his
claims quite a bit during the

00:42:18.821 --> 00:42:20.280
course of the semester.
 

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.820
The secondary readings are
heavier at the beginning of the

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.920
course when we are reading very
small segments of biblical text.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.550
That will shift. Right?
 

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:32.222
Towards the end of the course
you're going to be reading,

00:42:32.222 --> 00:42:35.085
you know, a couple of books in
the Bible and maybe a ten-page

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:37.226
article of secondary reading;
so, you know,

00:42:37.226 --> 00:42:39.099
it's front loaded with
secondary readings.

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:41.284
So you'll want to get started
on the Kaufman,

00:42:41.284 --> 00:42:44.263
because for the first few weeks
it's quite a bit of secondary

00:42:44.263 --> 00:42:47.192
reading but we're covering just
a few chapters of Bible each

00:42:47.192 --> 00:42:48.880
time in the first few weeks.
 

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.062
Sections: We're going to be
doing this online registration

00:42:52.062 --> 00:42:55.190
thing that I've never done
before, so I hope it works.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.090
We do have three teaching
fellows for this course.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.469
I hope that will be sufficient.
 

00:43:01.469 --> 00:43:04.093
Actually, if the teaching
fellows could stand up so people

00:43:04.093 --> 00:43:06.670
could at least recognize you,
that would be wonderful.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.889
Anyone wants to volunteer,
we could have a fourth.

00:43:08.889 --> 00:43:12.010
Okay, so we have two in the
back there, we have Tudor Sala

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.199
raising his hand and Tzvi Novick
here.

00:43:14.199 --> 00:43:18.019
They will be running regular
discussion sections and then

00:43:18.019 --> 00:43:21.701
Kristine Garroway will be
running a writing requirement

00:43:21.701 --> 00:43:23.872
section.
I don't think that was listed

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:25.971
in the Blue Book,
but it should've been listed

00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:28.584
online that it is possible to
fulfill your writing skills

00:43:28.584 --> 00:43:30.309
requirement through this course.
 

00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:32.139
So Kristine will be running
that.

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:35.179
We will bring on Monday--so
please have your schedules as

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:38.288
well-formed as they are,
on Monday--we will put up times

00:43:38.288 --> 00:43:41.795
and we will take a straw poll to
figure out if we can accommodate

00:43:41.795 --> 00:43:43.440
everybody within the times.
 

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.908
One more extremely important
announcement,

00:43:45.908 --> 00:43:49.099
it's on your syllabus,
but I want to underline it even

00:43:49.099 --> 00:43:52.289
more than it is already
underlined and boldfaced.

00:43:52.289 --> 00:43:55.724
I want to underline the
importance of the section

00:43:55.724 --> 00:43:57.800
discussions in this course.
 

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.800
In fact, it's really wrong to
call them section discussions.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.393
It sounds like you're
discussing the lectures and the

00:44:02.393 --> 00:44:04.039
readings and you're really not.
 

00:44:04.039 --> 00:44:08.429
The section discussions are a
complement to the lectures.

00:44:08.429 --> 00:44:11.309
What I mean is:
this is an awfully big thing to

00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:13.500
spend just one semester
studying,

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.988
and I can't do it all,
and in my lectures I'll be

00:44:15.988 --> 00:44:18.995
trying to set broad themes and
patterns and describe what's

00:44:18.995 --> 00:44:20.910
going on,
but I want you to have the

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.771
experience of actually sitting
and reading chunks of text and

00:44:23.771 --> 00:44:26.251
struggling with that and
understanding the history of

00:44:26.251 --> 00:44:29.018
interpretation of passages and
how so many important things

00:44:29.018 --> 00:44:31.689
have happened historically
because of people's efforts to

00:44:31.689 --> 00:44:33.119
understand this text.
 

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:36.381
So in sections,
a large part of the focus in

00:44:36.381 --> 00:44:39.340
section will be on specific
passages,

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.257
reading and struggling with the
text, the kind of thing I can't

00:44:42.257 --> 00:44:44.964
do in lecture.
This is important because your

00:44:44.964 --> 00:44:48.481
final paper assignment will be
an exercise in exegesis,

00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:49.849
an interpretation.
 

00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:52.534
The skills that you will need
for that paper I am fairly

00:44:52.534 --> 00:44:55.609
certain are not things that you
would've acquired in high school

00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:56.682
and,
if we have some

00:44:56.682 --> 00:44:59.002
upperclassmen--I don't know,
but maybe not even some

00:44:59.002 --> 00:45:01.050
upperclassmen will have acquired
here yet.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.935
Exegesis is a very particular
kind of skill and the teaching

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:08.690
fellows will be introducing you
to methods of exegesis.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.221
So it's really a training
ground for the final paper,

00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:14.094
and we have found that people
don't succeed in the course in

00:45:14.094 --> 00:45:16.772
the final paper without the
training they get in section

00:45:16.772 --> 00:45:19.037
discussion,
which is why section

00:45:19.037 --> 00:45:22.630
participation is worth ten
percent of your grade.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:25.106
However, if there are repeated,
unexcused absences,

00:45:25.106 --> 00:45:27.829
there will be an adjustment in
the grade calculation,

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:30.679
and it will be worth twenty to
twenty-five percent of your

00:45:30.679 --> 00:45:32.980
grade, and it will be a negative
grade also.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.200
And believe me,
this is a favor to you.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.590
It is definitely a favor to you.
 

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:39.250
These sections are critically
important in this course.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:41.456
Okay?
So, if you have any questions,

00:45:41.456 --> 00:45:44.101
I can hang around for a few
minutes, but thank you for

00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:46.000
coming.
We'll see you Monday.

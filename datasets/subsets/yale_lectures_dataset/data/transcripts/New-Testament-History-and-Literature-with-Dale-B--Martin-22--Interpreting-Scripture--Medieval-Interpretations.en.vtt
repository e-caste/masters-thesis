00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.749
Prof: Last time I talked
about the Letter to the Hebrews

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.203
and I used it mainly as an
example of early Christian

00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:11.330
interpretation of scripture.
 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.476
If you recall I was talking
about Hebrews 7 where there's

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:19.771
the story, the interpretation of
the Melchizedek story from

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:20.660
Genesis.
 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.650
To review briefly,
Abraham comes back from a raid,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.483
he has a lot of booty,
he has his relatives from

00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:31.241
defeating some kings,
he comes to Melchizedek who's

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:34.430
not of course a descendant of
Abraham,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.149
therefore he's not a Jew,
he's not part of the people of

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.560
Israel but he is a priest,
a high priest of Yahweh,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.950
according to the text.
 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.754
Melchizedek gives him a tenth
of the spoils and then this

00:00:46.754 --> 00:00:50.220
writer interprets that as being
that since Levi,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.955
the head of the progenitor of
the priestly tribe among the

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.690
Jews,
is within the body of Abraham.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.630
That means that Levi himself is
giving tithes to Melchizedek.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.165
The entire priesthood of
Israel, of the Jews,

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.700
recognizes the superiority,
according to this

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.513
interpretation,
of the priesthood of

00:01:12.513 --> 00:01:13.959
Melchizedek.
 

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:17.275
And then the writer takes
Melchizedek to be a type,

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:19.730
a sign of Jesus and his
priesthood.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.709
This makes perfect sense of
course because,

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.197
as the text says,
Melchizedek had no father or

00:01:24.197 --> 00:01:26.564
mother,
or it doesn't give a father or

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:28.200
mother,
and no genealogy,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.983
no lineage, came out of nowhere
so the same way happens with

00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:33.780
Christ as the priesthood.
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.203
Jesus of course was not of the
tribe of Levi according--Jesus

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:43.994
couldn't be a priest in the
normal sense of the Jewish

00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:45.349
priesthood.
 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.882
The writer takes Jesus to be a
priest not of the line of Levi

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:54.849
or Aaron, but of the line of
Melchizedek.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.010
Now this obviously is not the
way any of us in the modern

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.060
world would read Genesis,
in its historical setting.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.239
That's precisely the other way
this reader does it,

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.489
and it's all part of a
synkrisis,

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.680
a comparison of the
leitourgia,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.538
the liturgy of Christ with the
inferior leitourgia or

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:15.348
liturgy of the Jews.
 

00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:19.401
It's done sort of to convince
this congregation that you don't

00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:23.188
need to go back to that,
you've got something superior.

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:29.550
Hebrews ends with this kind of
admonition in 13:8,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.173
"Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday, and today,

00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:39.030
and forever."
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.532
Now remember,
this writer believes that Jesus

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:43.750
Christ has existed all the way
back,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.330
so that's why he can read the
Psalms,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.038
which a historian would read as
addressed to a Davidic King,

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:51.690
as being addressed actually to
Jesus.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.008
So Jesus Christ is back in
history too."

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.240
Do not be carried away by all
kinds of strange teachings,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.840
for it is well for the heart to
be strengthened by grace,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.568
not by regulations about food
[You don't need to keep kosher],

00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:07.370
which have not benefitted those
who observe them.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.400
We have an altar from which
those who officiate in the tent

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.180
[that's referring to that
tabernacle,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.860
the tent of the tabernacle in
Exodus,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.305
which he's been comparing all
the way through]

00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:22.455
We have an altar from which
those who officiate in the tent

00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:25.008
[that is the Levites]
have no right to eat.

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:28.492
For the bodies of those animals
whose blood is brought into the

00:03:28.492 --> 00:03:31.919
sanctuary by the high priest as
a sacrifice for sin are burned

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.098
outside the camp.
 

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:36.931
When you sacrifice an animal,
according to the Exodus'

00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:40.111
instructions,
you don't burn the materials of

00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:42.569
the sacrifice inside the camp.
 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.860
You do it outside the camp.
 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.720
So he's going to do something
like that too.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.700
"Therefore,
Jesus also suffered,"

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.460
where?
 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.310
Outside the gates of Jerusalem.
 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.525
So now Jerusalem has become
like the Israelite camp talked

00:03:56.525 --> 00:04:01.008
about in Exodus,
and Jesus is the sacrifice who

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:07.169
was sacrificed on the cross
outside the walls of Jerusalem.

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.436
"Jesus suffered outside
the city gate in order to

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:12.840
sanctify the people by his own
blood.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.411
Let us thenâ€¦"
now this is a really big period

00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.290
on this whole speech.
 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.829
"Let us then go to him
outside the camp."

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:28.985
Basically he's symbolically
saying, let us follow Jesus out

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:32.096
of Jerusalem,
out of the camp of the

00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:33.430
Israelites.
 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:41.101
Now this is much more radically
supercessionist then we've seen

00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:42.339
in Paul.
 

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:46.250
I've taught that Paul never saw
himself as a Christian;

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.940
he never saw himself as
starting something new.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.468
In fact, he saw himself as
bringing the Gentiles into

00:04:52.468 --> 00:04:53.079
Israel.
 

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:56.560
And so he never--although they
didn't have to keep the law,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.033
they didn't have to keep Torah,
they didn't have to be

00:04:58.033 --> 00:04:59.454
circumcised,
in fact they weren't supposed

00:04:59.454 --> 00:05:02.598
to at all be circumcised,
Paul never thought--he never

00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:07.014
talks in this way about the
supercession of a new kind of

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:10.088
liturgy from an old kind of
liturgy.

00:05:10.088 --> 00:05:13.470
When you talk about Christian
supercessionist kind of

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.564
language--
and the term just means the

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:18.634
traditional Christian teachings
which you've seen throughout two

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:21.845
thousand years of Christianity,
that Christianity is superior

00:05:21.845 --> 00:05:24.000
to Judaism--
when you see that kind of

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.319
supercessionist kind of language
in the New Testament,

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.629
it's not in Paul so much.
 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.379
It is here in Hebrews because
that's the way it works.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.440
What's interesting from our
point of view is that he

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.259
actually uses Jewish scripture
to teach this.

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.360
Now in order to use Jewish
scripture to teach the

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.041
supercession of Judaism by
Christianity you know that he's

00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:47.788
going to have interpreted it in
what we would consider very

00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:49.079
creative ways.
 

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:53.279
We can use that to contrast the
way I've been teaching you to

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:56.079
interpret these texts in this
course,

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:58.670
which is through historical
critical exegesis,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.059
from the way that Christians
have interpreted this text for

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.329
all the way through history.
 

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:07.000
This is not just Christians.
 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.418
Jewish interpretation of
scripture is just as creative as

00:06:11.418 --> 00:06:15.680
Christian interpretation of
scripture before the modern

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.550
period.
 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.639
What, then, is historical
criticism?

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.333
And I'm going to review some
things that you've been learning

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:22.350
all the way through the
semester,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.783
but I'm going to line up some
things so they get them really

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:25.649
clear in your mind.
 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:27.560
What is it you've been learning
in this class,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.937
the method you've been
learning, and then we're going

00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:32.452
to go back to the pre-modern
stuff today and look at the

00:06:32.452 --> 00:06:35.377
examples that you read about and
the reading from The Pedagogy

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:36.430
of the Bible.
 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.312
The meaning of a text,
according to historical

00:06:40.312 --> 00:06:45.233
criticism, is what the ancient
human author intended it to

00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:46.009
mean.
 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.480
For example,
in Jeremiah 3:6 it says,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.360
"The Lord said to me in
the days of King Josiah."

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.170
Now, if I wanted to be creative
in my interpretation I might say

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.581
that the Lord said to me,
Dale Basil Martin,

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:07.084
in the days of King Josiah,
but that would of course not be

00:07:07.084 --> 00:07:08.870
a historical critical
interpretation.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.180
It has to be "me"
meaning Jeremiah,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.810
so the Lord says to Jeremiah.
 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.750
That's who the author clearly
must be referring to,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.309
and we have to take "the
King Josiah"

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:21.425
to be the king who actually sat
on the throne of David in

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:24.017
Jerusalem,
the ancient King Josiah,

00:07:24.017 --> 00:07:26.896
not Josiah Bumbershoot,
who happens to own a liquor

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:28.100
store down the street from me.
 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.790
The text is not referring to
that Josiah;

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.490
he's referring to the ancient
Josiah;

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.399
that's the basis of historical
criticism.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:37.209
The expansion of this,
that it's the author's

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:39.571
intention,
comes to be in a lot of studies

00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:42.684
even within historical criticism
that another way to think about

00:07:42.684 --> 00:07:45.747
the meaning of the text is that
the meaning of the text is what

00:07:45.747 --> 00:07:48.860
the original readers probably
would have thought it meant.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.839
Because of course we can't get
to the intentions of the author;

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:53.509
that's lost to us completely.
 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:56.279
We have no idea what's going on
inside the minds of these

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.170
ancient authors.
 

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.634
But by practicing
historiographical research we

00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:02.850
can guess at what probably an
ancient reader would have taken

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.858
the text to mean,
and so that's been added on as

00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:09.088
another meaning that historical
criticism looks for.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:13.235
The third point about
historical criticism I want to

00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:17.706
make here is that it assumes a
sort of modern historical

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.170
consciousness.
 

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.918
By this we mean modern people
just have the notion that really

00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:25.129
pre-modern people didn't so
much,

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:27.689
that the world was radically
different in the ancient world.

00:08:27.689 --> 00:08:29.449
The ancient world is just not
like our world.

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:32.528
They thought about the world as
being in levels like stories.

00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:36.313
Well, we think about the cosmos
as being a bunch of different

00:08:36.313 --> 00:08:38.269
spheres in an infinite space.
 

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:41.475
We read ancient texts and we
see not only were they different

00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:43.530
kinds of people--
they had different ethics--but

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.894
their whole cosmos,
their whole universe that they

00:08:45.894 --> 00:08:47.750
inhabited was different for
them.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.110
What that means with historical
criticism in the twentieth

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.586
century: you have theological
students being taught a little

00:08:54.586 --> 00:08:57.830
bit about ancient near-eastern
society and culture.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.264
In fact, you have entire
departments of ancient

00:09:00.264 --> 00:09:03.070
near-eastern studies arise in
modern universities,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.614
and they don't arise just
because people are automatically

00:09:05.614 --> 00:09:07.308
interested in near-eastern
cultures.

00:09:07.308 --> 00:09:10.340
They arise as a support for
biblical studies.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.590
That's where they come from.
 

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.035
The idea that if you want to
read the Old Testament or the

00:09:15.035 --> 00:09:17.481
Hebrew Bible responsibly in the
modern world you must know

00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.186
something about ancient Assyria
and ancient Egypt because that's

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:21.259
where it came from.
 

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:23.700
Also, then you learn something
about the Greek world,

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.836
why I gave an entire lecture at
the beginning of the semester on

00:09:26.836 --> 00:09:28.779
the Greek world and the Roman
world,

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:31.028
and second temple Judaism.
 

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:35.279
We have the idea that Judaism
before the rabbis,

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:37.360
which is the time of Judaism
we're talking about,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.620
was a different kind of Judaism
than Rabbinic Judaism that you

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.720
might see now in the modern
world or in the Middle Ages.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.029
This reflects the idea that if
you want to get back into these

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:50.340
texts in their ancient period
you have to develop knowledge of

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.990
that period.
 

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.480
Why?
 

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.100
Because we've developed a
historical consciousness.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.711
We see ourselves in a place,
in a timeline of history,

00:09:56.711 --> 00:09:59.470
and the history is different in
those different times.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.908
This also means that we teach
people: you need to read these

00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:05.590
texts if possible in the
original languages.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.890
How many times in this class
have I told you what the

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.320
original Greek word of some
particular word the English

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.590
translation was?
 

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.533
This is not a Greek class,
most of you haven't studied

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.980
Greek, but I'll often scribble
on the board some Greek term.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.298
Why am I doing that?
 

00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:24.394
The text that Christians read
all over the world today is not

00:10:24.394 --> 00:10:25.840
in Greek; it's in English.
 

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.009
So why is it important for us?
 

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:29.330
Why do you accept that it's
important?

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.666
Why does it seem natural to you
that I write the Greek text up

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:35.893
here and explain what its Greek
meaning means in the ancient

00:10:35.893 --> 00:10:36.440
world?
 

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.279
Because you have this
historical consciousness too,

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:42.402
you have the assumption that
this ancient meaning of the

00:10:42.402 --> 00:10:45.808
original language is important
for the interpretation of this

00:10:45.808 --> 00:10:46.320
text.
 

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.390
Fourth, historical criticism
teaches you we don't interpret

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.490
the Bible canonically.
 

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.288
That means a couple of
different things.

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:59.471
We don't take the whole Canon
of the Bible and interpret it

00:10:59.471 --> 00:11:02.048
all by reference to other parts
of the Canon.

00:11:02.048 --> 00:11:04.019
Remember, how many times have
we said,

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:07.182
well that thing you're talking
about may be in the Gospel of

00:11:07.182 --> 00:11:09.649
John but it's not in the Gospel
of Matthew,

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:11.450
and right now we're talking
about the Gospel of Matthew.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.394
You can't use the Gospel of
John to interpret the Gospel of

00:11:13.394 --> 00:11:13.730
Matthew.
 

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.139
Well, why not?
 

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:18.168
Christians have been doing it
for two thousand years.

00:11:18.168 --> 00:11:21.190
Historical criticism,
though, takes the Canon apart

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.514
and says each individual
document must be studied in its

00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:26.808
own right and for its own
content.

00:11:26.808 --> 00:11:30.721
So one thing that means is that
we don't study the whole Bible

00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:31.620
as one book.
 

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.668
We study the Bible as a series,
as a library of books,

00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:36.509
each one individually studied.
 

00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:39.532
The other aspect of this is
that we in the modern period

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.279
don't limit ourselves to the
study of the Canon.

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:43.990
What did we talk about last
week?

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.059
The Acts of Paul and
Thecla.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:47.700
That's not in the Bible.
 

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.788
Why did I, as a crazy mixed up
professor that I am,

00:11:51.788 --> 00:11:55.133
think that it was worthwhile
for you to read a non-canonical

00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:58.533
second century document in a
class called Introduction to New

00:11:58.533 --> 00:12:00.629
Testament History and
Literature?

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:02.950
I'll tell you why.
 

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.268
I've been brainwashed by the
modern historical critical

00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:10.015
method to believe that putting
the Pastoral Epistles and those

00:12:10.015 --> 00:12:13.702
other canonical texts into a
historical context that included

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:17.144
non-canonical materials is a
good way to teach you how to

00:12:17.144 --> 00:12:19.908
think about this New Testament
thing.

00:12:19.908 --> 00:12:22.408
That's part of the historical
critical method also.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:26.403
Fifth, in spite of the fact
that we don't study the Bible

00:12:26.403 --> 00:12:30.827
canonically in modern historical
criticism, we actually do look

00:12:30.827 --> 00:12:32.538
for source analysis.
 

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:35.240
For example,
we take the idea that these

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.220
ancient authors actually did use
sources.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.995
For example,
we've taught you that Matthew

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:44.649
and Luke probably used Mark as
one of their sources.

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:49.168
That's actually doing an
intra-canonical comparison;

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:52.251
we compare the shape of this
parable in Mark to the shape of

00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:54.288
the same parable in Matthew and
Luke.

00:12:54.288 --> 00:12:57.428
Isn't that kind of an
intra-canonical comparison?

00:12:57.428 --> 00:13:00.317
Yes it is, but the reason we're
doing it is we're trying to get

00:13:00.317 --> 00:13:02.879
behind the text of the Canon
into the pre-history of the

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:03.298
text.
 

00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:07.570
The form these texts assumed in
a pre-canonical shape.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.928
Famously, historical criticism
in the nineteenth century,

00:13:11.928 --> 00:13:15.125
when it was really invented,
came up with the idea that the

00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:17.769
five books of Moses are not
written by Moses,

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:19.340
they're written by different
people,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.879
and they were an edition of
originally four separate strains

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:25.460
of tradition and four separate
documents.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.500
This was called the JEPD Theory.
 

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.639
The J stands for Jahwist and
it's those parts of the Hebrew

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:34.995
Bible that use the name of God
as Yahweh because this came from

00:13:34.995 --> 00:13:37.206
Germany,
right, so they pronounce a J

00:13:37.206 --> 00:13:39.889
like "ya",
so Jahwist.

00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:43.552
The Elohist is a strain that
uses the term Elohim for

00:13:43.552 --> 00:13:47.649
God, so scholars said these are
originally two different things.

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:51.263
The P stands for the priestly
documents written by some kind

00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:53.899
of priestly class,
and the D stands for

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:57.340
Deuteronomy, so Deuteronomy and
some other things.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.671
The idea was the Deuteronomist
was an editor who wrote some of

00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:03.129
this stuff and then edited the
five books--

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:05.259
or at least a good bit of the
Pentateuch--

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:07.330
so that it resembled a certain
shape,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.245
so scholars called--they set
out these four different

00:14:10.245 --> 00:14:12.269
traditions--
and if you took a course in

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:14.076
Hebrew Bible,
an introduction to Hebrew

00:14:14.076 --> 00:14:16.798
Bible, or even in a seminary
introduction to Old Testament,

00:14:16.798 --> 00:14:19.926
you're going to get this theory
crammed down your throat because

00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:22.952
this is one of the most dominant
theories of modern historical

00:14:22.952 --> 00:14:24.639
criticism of the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:26.956
It's source analysis,
that's part of what we're

00:14:26.956 --> 00:14:27.360
doing.
 

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.278
I taught also that 2 Peter,
the letter 2 Peter,

00:14:30.278 --> 00:14:32.690
used Jude as one of his
sources, again,

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.178
that kind of source analysis is
part of the method.

00:14:36.178 --> 00:14:39.500
The next one,
I think I'm up to six,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.075
in spite of the fact of talking
about authorship of all these

00:14:43.075 --> 00:14:45.344
documents,
part of modern historical

00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:48.511
criticism questions the
authenticity of authorship all

00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:49.230
the time.
 

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.841
How many times in this course
have I said, well the Gospels

00:14:51.841 --> 00:14:54.183
say they're written by Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John,

00:14:54.183 --> 00:14:55.399
but we doubt they were.
 

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.149
They're anonymous.
 

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:58.551
So I've taught you what it
means to call a document

00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:00.952
"anonymous":
we don't know who the author

00:15:00.952 --> 00:15:01.288
is.
 

00:15:01.288 --> 00:15:03.610
I've taught you what it means
to call a document a

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.167
"pseudepigrapha"
or "pseudonymous,"

00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:09.340
which means it gives the false
name of somebody for what it is.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.019
These are basic aspects of
modern historical criticism.

00:15:12.019 --> 00:15:16.201
Now if you went to a very
conservative seminary you might

00:15:16.201 --> 00:15:18.889
not get as much emphasis on
this,

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:21.658
but even there they'll probably
tell you something like,

00:15:21.658 --> 00:15:27.149
well those liberals at Yale or
Princeton Theological Seminary,

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:30.668
they'll tell you that Paul
didn't write I and II Timothy

00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:33.042
and Titus,
but they're wrong and here's

00:15:33.042 --> 00:15:34.090
why they're wrong.
 

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.197
You can tell you're in the
modern period because they feel

00:15:37.197 --> 00:15:39.759
the need to explain the theory
to you anyway.

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:42.705
Even if they don't buy it,
they'll teach it to you because

00:15:42.705 --> 00:15:45.600
it's part of this modern way of
approaching the Bible.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.580
Next, the avoidance of
anachronism.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.775
This is the big,
bad thing in modern historical

00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:53.610
criticism.
 

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.462
Don't be anachronistic;
don't think back into the

00:15:57.462 --> 00:16:00.750
ancient text something that
actually arose later.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.413
For example,
most historical critics of the

00:16:03.413 --> 00:16:06.205
Bible would say,
it's certainly wrong to read

00:16:06.205 --> 00:16:09.058
the doctrine of the Trinity into
Genesis.

00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:12.267
Now you already read in the
chapter I gave you that that's

00:16:12.267 --> 00:16:14.350
exactly what Augustine does,
right?

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.660
Augustine reads the first
chapter of Genesis and when the

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.255
text says,
"In the beginning,"

00:16:20.255 --> 00:16:23.465
he says that refers to Jesus,
the Son, the wisdom through

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:24.720
whom all things were made.
 

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.206
The spirit that hovers over the
chaos in Genesis 1,

00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:28.850
that refers to the Holy Spirit.
 

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.653
So you've got the Trinity,
the God, Father,

00:16:30.653 --> 00:16:32.330
Son and Holy Spirit right in
Genesis.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.529
Modern historical criticism
rejects that and says that's

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:35.450
wildly anachronistic.
 

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.371
The doctrine of the Trinity was
only developed centuries after

00:16:38.371 --> 00:16:40.982
the writing of Genesis;
you can't read it back in

00:16:40.982 --> 00:16:42.340
there, its anachronism.
 

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.465
The last big,
big boogey man of historical

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:50.590
criticism is eisegesis.
 

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:55.447
If you go to any kind of
seminary, they'll warn you

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:57.389
against eisegesis.
 

00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.692
Why?
 

00:16:57.692 --> 00:17:02.225
Because this is reading into
the text something that's not in

00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:05.397
the text, and they're playing
off the word,

00:17:05.397 --> 00:17:08.950
of course I've used this
before, exegesis.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.348
Exegesis means simply,
as you've already learned in

00:17:11.348 --> 00:17:13.028
this course, interpreting a
text.

00:17:13.028 --> 00:17:15.338
Some people think it only
refers to historical critical

00:17:15.338 --> 00:17:17.307
interpretation,
and that's often what it's come

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:19.404
to mean in schools,
but originally it just means

00:17:19.404 --> 00:17:20.368
interpreting a text.
 

00:17:20.368 --> 00:17:22.920
Any kind of interpretation of a
text is exegesis.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.263
It's come to mean historical
critical interpretation of the

00:17:26.263 --> 00:17:29.088
text because this is what's
really in the text.

00:17:29.088 --> 00:17:32.930
What is eisegesis is just some
modern pious person picking up

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.450
the Bible and seeing anything
they want to see in it.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.682
It's "reading into"
because this means "out

00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:40.798
of" and this Greek word
means "into."

00:17:40.798 --> 00:17:43.769
So eisegesis,
you're taught to avoid that.

00:17:43.769 --> 00:17:45.883
Then finally,
one of the last major

00:17:45.883 --> 00:17:49.673
presuppositions that relates to
the historical consciousness I

00:17:49.673 --> 00:17:52.160
talked about:
the idea that there's a gap

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.328
between the world of the Bible
and our world.

00:17:55.328 --> 00:17:59.009
If you go into most churches in
the United States--

00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:00.400
there are very,
very few that might do this--

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.705
but if you go into most
churches--I don't care how

00:18:02.705 --> 00:18:04.588
liberal or how conservative they
are,

00:18:04.588 --> 00:18:06.767
I don't care if they're a
radical leftist or

00:18:06.767 --> 00:18:10.358
fundamentalists--
most of the women will not be

00:18:10.358 --> 00:18:11.720
wearing veils.
 

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.248
If they're really conservative
they might have a hat on,

00:18:15.248 --> 00:18:16.660
but not a full veil.
 

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.967
We say, well,
you want to be true to the

00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:21.630
Bible and right there in I
Corinthians 11,

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.108
you've read it,
you know it's there,

00:18:23.108 --> 00:18:25.505
Paul's telling women,
you have to wear veils in

00:18:25.505 --> 00:18:27.380
church when you pray and
prophesy.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.500
Why aren't your women veiled?
 

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.160
It doesn't matter whether these
Christians are liberal or

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.101
conservative,
they'll have some way of saying

00:18:33.101 --> 00:18:35.965
something like,
well that was their culture and

00:18:35.965 --> 00:18:37.538
it's not our culture.
 

00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:40.962
It was important in the ancient
world for women to wear veils

00:18:40.962 --> 00:18:44.019
because it expressed humility;
it expressed control.

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:46.314
If they didn't wear veils they
might be thought of as a loose

00:18:46.314 --> 00:18:46.618
woman.
 

00:18:46.618 --> 00:18:51.540
Well, veils don't mean that in
our culture, so we don't have to

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.240
obey that text like it's a rule.
 

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.230
They will talk about--and they
might not use the term

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.818
"gap"
but that's what I call it--

00:18:59.818 --> 00:19:02.836
what they're doing is saying,
there is a gap between their

00:19:02.836 --> 00:19:04.690
culture and their world and
ours.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:09.371
That consciousness of that gap
is a major aspect of modern

00:19:09.371 --> 00:19:11.259
historical criticism.
 

00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:14.556
So those are several
principles, you're not going to

00:19:14.556 --> 00:19:18.432
probably find those listed in a
textbook, Introduction to the

00:19:18.432 --> 00:19:19.078
Bible.
 

00:19:19.078 --> 00:19:22.528
I actually do list them in my
Pedagogy of the Bible in

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:23.680
the first chapter.
 

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.836
But those are list of things
that I just said these are basic

00:19:26.836 --> 00:19:29.784
principles of historical
criticism that set it apart from

00:19:29.784 --> 00:19:32.994
the centuries of interpretation
of the Bible that have existed

00:19:32.994 --> 00:19:33.890
beforehand.
 

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.483
I'm going to stop for a minute
and just say,

00:19:35.483 --> 00:19:37.078
is that clear,
do you have any questions?

00:19:37.078 --> 00:19:39.673
This is all familiar to you
because you've been practicing

00:19:39.673 --> 00:19:42.358
this now all year but it should
have struck some of you,

00:19:42.358 --> 00:19:45.358
at least, a little odd in the
beginning of why we were asking

00:19:45.358 --> 00:19:48.275
this text what we were doing,
why we were pushing you to do

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:50.588
the exegesis papers in a certain
way we're doing,

00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:53.375
why is it wrong to read these
texts and just write a sermon on

00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:55.338
them and turn it in as an
exegesis paper?

00:19:55.338 --> 00:19:57.568
No, a sermon is different from
an exegesis paper.

00:19:57.568 --> 00:20:00.325
We were teaching you this
method with all these principles

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.259
and presuppositions all semester
long.

00:20:02.259 --> 00:20:03.710
Is there any question about
that?

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.950
Okay good.
 

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.042
This historical criticism
didn't just spring out of the

00:20:14.042 --> 00:20:15.180
Bible itself.
 

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.900
Where did it come from?
 

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.808
Why do we have it and where did
it come from?

00:20:18.808 --> 00:20:21.670
Well, as you know,
before the Reformation,

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.844
basically the Bible--scripture
was supposed to mean what the

00:20:24.844 --> 00:20:27.702
Catholic Church said it meant,
what the Pope said it--what the

00:20:27.702 --> 00:20:28.470
bishop said it meant.
 

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.964
The authority structure of the
church was taken to be the way

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:34.470
that you controlled wild
interpretations.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.880
People in the ancient knew,
you can interpret a text any

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.670
way you want to.
 

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:42.523
So what keeps heretics from
interpreting this text in false

00:20:42.523 --> 00:20:43.109
ways?
 

00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:45.048
The institution of the church.
 

00:20:45.048 --> 00:20:48.477
So we'll see later Ignatius,
when we're reading his letters,

00:20:48.477 --> 00:20:51.673
he says, you can't just
interpret scripture any you want

00:20:51.673 --> 00:20:53.211
to;
you must be in agreement with

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:53.720
your bishop.
 

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.467
The rule of the bishop and the
rule of the church was the way

00:20:57.467 --> 00:21:00.838
to keep control over the
interpretation of the text.

00:21:00.838 --> 00:21:03.818
Of course in the
pre-Reformation time,

00:21:03.818 --> 00:21:06.160
you did have the rise of
humanism and the Renaissance,

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.430
which started questioning that
a bit,

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.220
and they started going back and
looking at the original Hebrew,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.278
the original Greek,
insisting that you should read

00:21:13.278 --> 00:21:15.970
these texts in their original
languages and not just in Latin.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.778
That was before the Reformation.
 

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:21.134
You already had this move
toward history and reading the

00:21:21.134 --> 00:21:24.673
text in historical context in
the humanist movement and the

00:21:24.673 --> 00:21:25.650
Renaissance.
 

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.085
With the Reformation,
though, of course you really

00:21:28.085 --> 00:21:30.769
get it in the sixteenth century
with Martin Luther,

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:32.675
John Calvin,
Melanchthon,

00:21:32.675 --> 00:21:36.583
different writers saying,
well, we're going to throw out

00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:38.660
this Catholic authority on the
text.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.380
We're going to get back to the
text itself.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:47.160
The only authority for the
radical reformers was scripture.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:53.469
You know this as,
sola scriptura,

00:21:53.469 --> 00:21:57.528
scripture only;
scripture only will be the

00:21:57.528 --> 00:21:59.390
guide for authority for
Protestants.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.190
Of course then they start
realizing that different people

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.769
can interpret scripture
differently.

00:22:05.769 --> 00:22:07.919
They're very familiar with
medieval Christian ways of

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:10.398
interpreting scripture to have
several different meanings and

00:22:10.398 --> 00:22:11.348
layers of meanings.
 

00:22:11.348 --> 00:22:13.990
And so they say,
well the predominant guide of

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.630
scripture isn't going to be just
scripture;

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.058
it's going to be one particular
meaning of scripture.

00:22:19.058 --> 00:22:22.130
And that's sensus
literalis.

00:22:26.338 --> 00:22:30.542
The literal sense of scripture
is what will be now the guide

00:22:30.542 --> 00:22:32.894
for the Reformation,
not the Pope,

00:22:32.894 --> 00:22:34.318
not the bishops.
 

00:22:34.318 --> 00:22:39.048
Even the bishop must submit to
the literal sense of scripture.

00:22:39.048 --> 00:22:42.385
Now it's rather debatable what
they meant by "the literal

00:22:42.385 --> 00:22:45.449
sense" because some of
these reformers said that the

00:22:45.449 --> 00:22:48.950
literal sense of scripture could
even be a prophetic sense,

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.469
so they still said that the
literal sense of scripture could

00:22:51.469 --> 00:22:53.049
be in a Psalm when the Psalm
says,

00:22:53.049 --> 00:22:56.699
"The Lord said to my Lord,
'Sit at my right hand.'"

00:22:56.699 --> 00:23:01.124
Well they knew that the text if
you're interested in an ancient

00:23:01.124 --> 00:23:04.548
text would be referring to the
Davidic King,

00:23:04.548 --> 00:23:08.390
but they also said that Psalm
also could refer to Jesus,

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.308
even in its literal sense.
 

00:23:10.308 --> 00:23:12.806
The literal sense that they
were talking about in the

00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:15.348
Reformation was not necessarily
what we would call the

00:23:15.348 --> 00:23:16.788
historical critical sense.
 

00:23:16.788 --> 00:23:20.405
It was what they took it to be
the most fundamental plain sense

00:23:20.405 --> 00:23:21.690
meaning of the text.
 

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.130
So that was the literal sense.
 

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.480
Then again they realized the
more they did this that

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.200
Protestant churches started
splitting all over the place.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.490
Presbyterians and Calvinists
split off from the Lutherans,

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.318
the Anabaptists split off from
the Reformation.

00:23:34.318 --> 00:23:37.692
And then you have a rise of so
many Protestant movements that

00:23:37.692 --> 00:23:40.952
the idea that scripture alone
could settle debates and give

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:43.818
you a foundation started
becoming questionable.

00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:46.101
In the nineteenth century,
beginning somewhat in the

00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:48.740
eighteenth century but mainly in
the nineteenth century,

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.920
and mainly in Germany,
German speaking lands,

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.460
scholars started pushing the
historical reading of the text.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.440
They said, we've got to get
down to what the author meant.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.430
What did the historical Paul
mean?

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.548
How did we discover that?
 

00:24:01.548 --> 00:24:04.170
That's when you have the rise,
in the nineteenth century,

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.695
of the dominance of the
historical critical method with

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.098
all these presuppositions.
 

00:24:08.098 --> 00:24:11.598
It was elaborated and invented
in the nineteenth century,

00:24:11.598 --> 00:24:14.565
and in some places it was
precisely invented in order to

00:24:14.565 --> 00:24:17.854
try to make the text of the New
Testament and the Bible a firm

00:24:17.854 --> 00:24:20.980
foundation for doctrine and
ethics within Protestantism and

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.623
within the wide of varieties of
different kinds of

00:24:23.623 --> 00:24:24.808
Protestantism.
 

00:24:24.808 --> 00:24:28.246
Then the last part of this,
and this is a big sweep of

00:24:28.246 --> 00:24:30.970
history I'm giving you in five
seconds,

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.269
what happens in the last part
of the twentieth century,

00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:36.250
just in the last,
say, thirty years,

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:40.640
is that people like me come
along and say,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.259
you know it hasn't worked.
 

00:24:42.259 --> 00:24:46.057
This attempt to use historical
criticism, to settle disputes

00:24:46.057 --> 00:24:49.019
about the meaning of the text,
doesn't work.

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:51.962
Because even the historical
critical method can render

00:24:51.962 --> 00:24:54.630
wildly varying interpretations
of these texts.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.261
So you've got some people
reading Romans 1 as a

00:24:57.261 --> 00:25:00.008
condemnation of modern
homosexuality and thinking

00:25:00.008 --> 00:25:03.269
they're doing a good historical
reading of this text.

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:05.863
You've got other people who
read the same text,

00:25:05.863 --> 00:25:08.457
using the same methods of
historical criticism,

00:25:08.457 --> 00:25:09.980
and say, are you crazy?
 

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.921
He's not talking about
homosexuality,

00:25:11.921 --> 00:25:13.269
that's not his concern.
 

00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:15.190
It's talking about idolatry or
something else.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:19.098
Even scholars using the same
method of historical criticism,

00:25:19.098 --> 00:25:22.340
trained in the same schools,
getting degrees from the same

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.170
places,
come up with different

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.320
interpretations of these texts
even using the historical

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.410
critical method.
 

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:33.273
And that's why you have right
now a lot of questioning of this

00:25:33.273 --> 00:25:38.057
method as not supplying the firm
foundations that Protestants

00:25:38.057 --> 00:25:40.608
originally thought it might.
 

00:25:40.608 --> 00:25:43.767
You have new methods now being
brought back into seminary

00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:45.702
education,
like feminist analysis,

00:25:45.702 --> 00:25:48.545
or literary criticism,
or liberation theology,

00:25:48.545 --> 00:25:52.338
or African American approaches,
or Latino approaches.

00:25:52.338 --> 00:25:54.933
Or queer readings,
gay and lesbian readings and

00:25:54.933 --> 00:25:57.479
queer readings,
you have all these different

00:25:57.479 --> 00:26:00.919
kinds of ways of approaching the
text being brought back as ways

00:26:00.919 --> 00:26:03.977
to if not displace then at least
to supplement historical

00:26:03.977 --> 00:26:07.200
criticism that was dominant for
the twentieth century.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.470
Now the question is,
why do all this stuff anyway?

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.095
Why have I first been teaching
you the historical critical

00:26:14.095 --> 00:26:14.509
method?
 

00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:16.997
Well I can answer that,
it's because that's the

00:26:16.997 --> 00:26:19.970
dominant way that the Bible is
taught in modern American

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:20.890
universities.
 

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.660
It's sort of like,
how do you learn Shakespeare?

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.058
How do you learn these kinds of
things?

00:26:26.058 --> 00:26:27.923
There are methods,
and it's not necessarily the

00:26:27.923 --> 00:26:30.028
historical method in English
departments anymore,

00:26:30.028 --> 00:26:33.838
but there are different
dominant methods that academics

00:26:33.838 --> 00:26:36.450
use to construct their
disciplines.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.989
The main way still that
biblical studies is constructed

00:26:39.989 --> 00:26:43.736
as an academic discipline,
as opposed to a discipline of

00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:46.422
faith in a church,
is through at least learning

00:26:46.422 --> 00:26:48.338
about the historical critical
method.

00:26:48.338 --> 00:26:51.513
So I make that the basic part
of this, when I'm introducing

00:26:51.513 --> 00:26:53.867
you to this discipline,
because I'm not just

00:26:53.867 --> 00:26:58.118
introducing you to the text;
I'm introducing you to a modern

00:26:58.118 --> 00:27:02.150
scholarly discipline,
practices, and assumptions.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.278
But I also believe that we
should study other ways of

00:27:05.278 --> 00:27:08.407
studying the Bible also,
at least to be introduced to

00:27:08.407 --> 00:27:08.950
them.
 

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.611
That's why later this week
you're supposed to go to the Art

00:27:12.611 --> 00:27:13.180
Museum.
 

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.950
None of us are art critics who
work in this class.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:20.328
None of us are historians of
art.

00:27:20.328 --> 00:27:22.338
I know nothing about art
history.

00:27:22.338 --> 00:27:25.598
The teaching fellows know very
little about art history also.

00:27:25.598 --> 00:27:29.506
Some of you in this class will
be much better at going through

00:27:29.506 --> 00:27:32.770
the Yale Art Gallery and
analyzing the artwork there

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.548
because you will have taken art
history classes like I never

00:27:36.548 --> 00:27:37.190
did.
 

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.136
The purpose of this visit is
not to do a typical art

00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:41.640
historical kind of move.
 

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.953
It's so that you can contrast
the stuff you've been learning

00:27:45.953 --> 00:27:50.195
in this course with especially
early Christian and medieval

00:27:50.195 --> 00:27:52.608
representations of the Bible.
 

00:27:52.608 --> 00:27:55.633
Why did they portray in
painting and in artwork these

00:27:55.633 --> 00:27:57.608
stories the way they portray it?
 

00:27:57.608 --> 00:27:59.598
What does it tell us about
their mentality?

00:27:59.598 --> 00:28:01.108
What does it tell us about
their world?

00:28:01.108 --> 00:28:05.086
To get you to see this is what
interpretations of the Bible

00:28:05.086 --> 00:28:09.130
look like without historical
criticism, before the dominance

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.048
of historical criticism.
 

00:28:11.048 --> 00:28:14.078
It's to show you there are
other quite legitimate ways to

00:28:14.078 --> 00:28:15.269
interpret this text.
 

00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:19.016
We could have done the sort of
literary interpretation where we

00:28:19.016 --> 00:28:22.398
take these texts and we talk
about things like character,

00:28:22.398 --> 00:28:23.848
development of plot.
 

00:28:23.848 --> 00:28:26.383
We could read the Gospel of
Mark--a lot of people read the

00:28:26.383 --> 00:28:28.740
Gospel of Mark as almost like a
modern short story.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.627
It's full of puzzles;
it's full of ways that it leads

00:28:32.627 --> 00:28:33.808
the reader astray.
 

00:28:33.808 --> 00:28:35.608
Remember how the Gospel of Mark
ends?

00:28:35.608 --> 00:28:37.598
You don't even see the
resurrected Jesus.

00:28:37.598 --> 00:28:39.863
The women are told to go
announce he's been raised to the

00:28:39.863 --> 00:28:41.440
disciples, and they don't even
do it.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.000
They run off,
and that's the end.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.670
That doesn't end like a normal
ancient text would end,

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.994
but it does end like kind of
modernist sort of literature

00:28:49.994 --> 00:28:53.616
which poses many questions to
the reader often as it does give

00:28:53.616 --> 00:28:54.328
answers.
 

00:28:54.328 --> 00:28:57.623
We could have read the Gospel
of Mark like we would read a

00:28:57.623 --> 00:29:00.048
modern short story by Flannery
O'Connor.

00:29:00.048 --> 00:29:02.599
You can do that and there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:06.410
Why is all that important?
 

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.457
I think it's important to
realize that because the vast

00:29:09.457 --> 00:29:12.336
majority of Christians
throughout human history have

00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:15.440
not read the Bible the way
you're learning to read it in

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.400
this class.
 

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.140
The vast majority of
Christians, even now throughout

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.759
the world, don't read the Bible
as you're learning to read it in

00:29:24.759 --> 00:29:25.858
this class.
 

00:29:25.858 --> 00:29:28.180
In spite of the fact that I'm
teaching you this method,

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.960
I still want to drum it into
your heads,

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.777
at least this week,
that this is just one way of

00:29:32.777 --> 00:29:36.315
doing it and you need to be
aware of the other ways of doing

00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:40.152
it because in some ways they are
culturally more important as far

00:29:40.152 --> 00:29:43.568
as the impact of the Bible on
western civilization.

00:29:43.568 --> 00:29:46.785
What I'm saying is that
historical criticism is

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:51.118
important to learn because it's
part of our environment too.

00:29:51.118 --> 00:29:55.298
But I would say that even as an
important way to approach the

00:29:55.298 --> 00:29:59.200
Bible it's not a sufficient way
to approach the Bible.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.296
It's certainly not sufficient
when it comes to the importance

00:30:02.296 --> 00:30:05.029
of scripture in the Bible for
western civilization and

00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.650
culture.
 

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:09.710
It would be much better to keep
in mind how Milton read the

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.019
Bible for Paradise Lost.
 

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:16.415
How Dante read the Bible,
how Flannery O'Connor uses the

00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:20.731
Bible in our literature,
and how artists use the Bible,

00:30:20.731 --> 00:30:23.210
that's also very important.
 

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:24.259
It certainly,
historical criticism,

00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:27.078
is not sufficient for the
Christian theological reading of

00:30:27.078 --> 00:30:29.848
the Bible because the historical
meaning of the text,

00:30:29.848 --> 00:30:31.570
I think, as people are
beginning to realize in

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.931
churches,
cannot provide you with enough

00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:39.380
to use this text theologically
and ethically.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.496
You've got to do something else
with the text besides just

00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:47.180
history if you still want to use
it as scripture.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.472
That's why today I'm mixing
these things up and trying to

00:30:50.472 --> 00:30:52.588
get you to see things
differently.

00:30:52.588 --> 00:30:55.486
Now let's look at what you were
reading for today,

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:57.731
the different medieval
interpretations,

00:30:57.731 --> 00:31:01.220
ancient Christian and medieval
interpretations of text.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.682
First you should know that
before the modern period there

00:31:04.682 --> 00:31:08.576
were these different meanings of
the text and in fact they would

00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:11.358
even talk about them as
different levels.

00:31:11.358 --> 00:31:15.250
The two most important were the
ones that I've already talked

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.143
about basically as the literal
sense and the other one is the

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:20.569
allegorical sense.
 

00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:24.900
You've seen this sort of thing.
 

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.674
Eventually textbooks would be
written that say medieval

00:31:28.674 --> 00:31:32.589
interpretation of the Bible have
four different levels of

00:31:32.589 --> 00:31:33.430
meaning.
 

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.400
But the most important,
throughout history,

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.298
has been basically a two part
division.

00:31:39.298 --> 00:31:41.626
This literal sense,
which sometimes can be called

00:31:41.626 --> 00:31:43.821
the body sense,
the bodily sense,

00:31:43.821 --> 00:31:47.673
or the physical sense,
and then the spiritual sense or

00:31:47.673 --> 00:31:50.623
the allegorical sense,
or the higher meaning,

00:31:50.623 --> 00:31:52.230
or the elevated meaning.
 

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:56.298
Over and over again those two
levels of interpretation will be

00:31:56.298 --> 00:31:59.900
stressed in pre-modern
interpretations of the Bible.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.416
Then you will often see other
names and other terms attached

00:32:03.416 --> 00:32:04.490
to other things.
 

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.365
For example,
sometimes you'll come across

00:32:06.365 --> 00:32:08.848
the term "anagogical
sense" of the text,

00:32:08.848 --> 00:32:12.362
and anagogical is not exactly
the literal but it's also not

00:32:12.362 --> 00:32:15.269
exactly the allegorical because
the anagogic--

00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:17.092
"anagogic"
means "leading up"

00:32:17.092 --> 00:32:17.509
in Greek.
 

00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:19.794
The idea was that this is a
reading of the text that will

00:32:19.794 --> 00:32:22.478
help you be a better Christian;
it'll help you be a more

00:32:22.478 --> 00:32:23.368
ethical person.
 

00:32:23.368 --> 00:32:26.868
So an anagogical reading would
lead you to something else and

00:32:26.868 --> 00:32:30.019
the varieties of different ways
of reading the text.

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:32.269
Medieval theologians will talk
about this: they'll use the term

00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:33.690
literal,
they'll use the term

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.088
allegorical, they'll use the
term anagogical,

00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:38.348
and they'll mean by that three
different meanings.

00:32:38.348 --> 00:32:40.969
Notice they don't necessarily
just mean these are three

00:32:40.969 --> 00:32:42.910
different ways to interpret the
text,

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.041
although that's the way I've
been talking about them because

00:32:45.041 --> 00:32:46.088
that's the way I hear that.
 

00:32:46.088 --> 00:32:48.961
They actually believe that
these are three different

00:32:48.961 --> 00:32:52.227
meanings that are in the
text itself: the anagogical

00:32:52.227 --> 00:32:54.105
meaning,
the allegorical meaning,

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:55.108
the literal meaning.
 

00:32:55.108 --> 00:32:57.548
Sometimes you'll hear them
talking about maybe the ethical

00:32:57.548 --> 00:32:59.028
meaning,
which sometimes looks a lot

00:32:59.028 --> 00:33:01.422
like the anagogical meaning,
and then sometimes you'll even

00:33:01.422 --> 00:33:03.328
hear them talk about the
historical meaning.

00:33:03.328 --> 00:33:05.699
What's funny here is that when
they use that word

00:33:05.699 --> 00:33:07.920
historia for the meaning
of a text--

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.890
and they sometimes bring--it's
a Greek word originally,

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.500
but they'll bring it into Latin
also--

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.798
don't get confused when you see
that,

00:33:13.798 --> 00:33:15.961
especially if you're reading
something on medieval

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:18.912
interpretation of the Bible,
because it doesn't mean the

00:33:18.912 --> 00:33:22.019
historical meaning of the text
in our understanding.

00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:25.528
By historia in this
sense, they usually mean the

00:33:25.528 --> 00:33:28.713
narrative reading:
f you were to read this text as

00:33:28.713 --> 00:33:30.980
a story,
regardless of whether it ever

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.470
happened.
 

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.275
So they don't mean historical
in the sense of,

00:33:33.275 --> 00:33:34.519
this is what really happened.
 

00:33:34.519 --> 00:33:37.298
They mean the word
historia--this is a

00:33:37.298 --> 00:33:40.519
narrative sort of shape,
it's reading the text as if

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:42.098
it's telling a story.
 

00:33:42.098 --> 00:33:45.506
Sometimes they'll call that the
historical meaning of the text

00:33:45.506 --> 00:33:48.019
and add that onto some of these
other ones.

00:33:48.019 --> 00:33:52.960
The medieval notion that there
are four senses of the text,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.470
literal is always one,
allegorical is always one,

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.824
and what counts as the other
two varies among different

00:33:58.824 --> 00:33:59.259
authors.
 

00:33:59.259 --> 00:34:02.392
That is definitely there in
medieval theorizing about

00:34:02.392 --> 00:34:05.830
scriptural interpretation,
but it shouldn't be exaggerated

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.159
because you don't see it quite
that rigidly as always four and

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.070
the same four levels of meaning.
 

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:14.318
But you will come across that
if you do any literary study of

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:17.514
the Bible in English literature
and the European context and

00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:18.760
that sort of thing.
 

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.989
The people I gave you to read
illustrate these things.

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:25.940
The first part about Origen,
if you brought your readings

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.679
turn to the part about Origin
like around page 56.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:32.594
What Origen is doing is he's
giving an example of what he

00:34:32.594 --> 00:34:35.880
takes to be the literal meaning
of this text.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.063
The story is from I Samuel 28,
and in case you don't remember

00:34:40.063 --> 00:34:42.715
the story,
Saul, who is the king,

00:34:42.715 --> 00:34:46.188
is fighting a battle,
and he wants to know whether

00:34:46.188 --> 00:34:48.780
he's going to win the battle the
next day,

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.539
whether he and Jonathan his son
are going to win,

00:34:50.539 --> 00:34:51.460
or they'll lose.
 

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.914
He goes and he finds a witch,
and of course he's already

00:34:54.914 --> 00:34:58.873
outlawed all the witches in the
country, so he's not supposed to

00:34:58.873 --> 00:35:00.130
find one at all.
 

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.106
He goes and finds this woman,
she's actually called a belly

00:35:03.106 --> 00:35:05.105
myther,
a person who speaks fabulous

00:35:05.105 --> 00:35:08.393
stories from the belly because I
guess they would kind of do it

00:35:08.393 --> 00:35:11.789
like this and it sounded like it
was coming out of their gut.

00:35:11.789 --> 00:35:14.438
They would sort of sound like a
ventriloquist or something,

00:35:14.438 --> 00:35:16.219
and they're speaking hidden
messages.

00:35:16.219 --> 00:35:17.659
He goes and finds this woman.
 

00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:19.652
It's translated often in
English as "the witch of

00:35:19.652 --> 00:35:20.179
Endor."
 

00:35:20.179 --> 00:35:21.980
That's the popular name for the
story.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.900
And he says call up the spirit
of Samuel the dead prophet,

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.940
and he's going to ask the
spirit--of course in--

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.275
in these kinds of cultures the
idea is that dead people can see

00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:35.621
the future because they're dead,
they live in the realm that

00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:37.949
they're not limited by our kinds
of sight.

00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:40.858
The idea is that the woman is
supposed to call up the dead

00:35:40.858 --> 00:35:42.141
Samuel,
the spirit of Samuel,

00:35:42.141 --> 00:35:44.940
so he comes out of the ground--
like all the dead are under the

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.768
ground in this kind of
cosmology--

00:35:46.768 --> 00:35:49.360
and he asks,
are we going to win the battle?

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.815
Samuel is all angry because
he's being called up,

00:35:51.815 --> 00:35:55.039
and he curses Saul and all this
kind stuff, so the story doesn't

00:35:55.039 --> 00:35:56.369
end too well for Saul.
 

00:35:56.369 --> 00:35:58.322
And sure enough the next day
Saul and Jonathan die,

00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:59.219
they lose the battle.
 

00:35:59.219 --> 00:36:03.096
Origen has a problem because
Christians all know that it's

00:36:03.096 --> 00:36:06.563
wrong to use witches,
and here's the King Saul using

00:36:06.563 --> 00:36:07.380
a witch.
 

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.083
And they also know,
but wait a minute Samuel

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.141
obeyed the woman,
she calls him to come out of

00:36:11.141 --> 00:36:12.449
the ground and he obeyed her.
 

00:36:12.449 --> 00:36:16.210
Why would a great prophet obey
a witch?

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.510
Early Christians reading this
text had a lot of problems,

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.369
and so sometimes they would
allegorize it,

00:36:21.369 --> 00:36:23.070
and they would say,
well it doesn't mean that,

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.039
it means this,
and it doesn't say the woman

00:36:25.039 --> 00:36:28.440
actually saw Samuel,
she thought she saw Samuel.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.817
Then other people would say,
but a good prophet like Samuel

00:36:31.817 --> 00:36:35.369
couldn't have been in hell,
how could he have been in hell?

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:37.139
Great prophets can't be in hell.
 

00:36:37.139 --> 00:36:39.800
So they would say,
oh it's just--it's an allegory.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.610
It doesn't really mean he was
in hell;

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.670
it meant he was in something
else.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.434
Origen comes along and says,
no you can't allegorize this

00:36:47.434 --> 00:36:50.260
text, and it means exactly what
it says.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.489
So he says, you have to read it
literally.

00:36:52.489 --> 00:36:54.199
He argues for a while.
 

00:36:54.199 --> 00:36:57.146
And this is very funny because
Origen is famous throughout

00:36:57.146 --> 00:36:59.576
history for being a great
allegorizing reader of

00:36:59.576 --> 00:37:00.300
scripture.
 

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.670
In fact, a lot of historians
don't like him because he tends

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.840
to read scripture allegorically
in different places.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.594
But in this case,
Origin this great allegorizer

00:37:07.594 --> 00:37:09.929
,is insisting on the literal
reading.

00:37:09.929 --> 00:37:11.780
But now notice what he means by
literal.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.719
First he says the woman really
did see Samuel.

00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:16.353
Samuel really was in hell,
and if you can't accept that

00:37:16.353 --> 00:37:17.329
it's your problem.
 

00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:19.606
Then he explains it,
and he gives some answers for

00:37:19.606 --> 00:37:19.840
it.
 

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.219
But then he says,
the literal meaning of the text

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:23.409
is not just the story.
 

00:37:23.409 --> 00:37:25.472
But this is what he says is the
literal sense:

00:37:25.472 --> 00:37:27.489
it's on page 56 in the chapter
I gave you.

00:37:27.489 --> 00:37:31.096
"Even the literal sense of
the story is to teach that

00:37:31.096 --> 00:37:34.449
Christians will enjoy an
afterlife existence."

00:37:34.449 --> 00:37:36.253
Now I ask you,
is there anything about

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.570
Christians in this story?
 

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:42.255
No, we would not call that the
literal historical sense of this

00:37:42.255 --> 00:37:42.860
story.
 

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.077
It shows that Origen,
when he uses this term literal

00:37:45.077 --> 00:37:47.208
meaning of this story,
he's not still referring to

00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:49.340
what we call the historical
critical meaning.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.297
For him, the literal meaning of
the story is to teach Christians

00:37:52.297 --> 00:37:54.130
about their own after life
existence.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.289
And then he has an elevated or
higher sense of the story,

00:37:57.289 --> 00:38:01.949
which he takes to be that
righteous Christians,

00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:05.420
unlike even righteous prophets
before the coming of Jesus,

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:10.030
won't have to spend any time in
Hades or hell,

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.750
or purgatory.
 

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.630
If you're a good Christian when
you die you'll go straight to

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.411
heaven,
and that's something that even

00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:18.929
the Old Testament prophets
didn't do because they had to go

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:20.621
hell first,
according to Origen,

00:38:20.621 --> 00:38:23.474
to wait until Christ came,
so Christ could open up

00:38:23.474 --> 00:38:25.599
paradise and heaven for
everybody.

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:29.239
Origen has an elevated
spiritual meaning of this text,

00:38:29.239 --> 00:38:31.849
but it's not a particularly
allegorical meaning,

00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:33.980
Ut's just that if you are a
righteous Christian,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.789
the story teaches that you will
get to go straight to heaven

00:38:37.789 --> 00:38:40.630
without passing through hell
when you die.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.445
Notice how Origen is still
playing with these notions of a

00:38:43.445 --> 00:38:46.309
literal reading and a higher
elevated spiritual reading.

00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:49.425
The literal reading doesn't
particularly look like what we

00:38:49.425 --> 00:38:51.940
would call the literal reading
of the text,

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.898
and the higher elevated
spiritual reading doesn't look

00:38:54.898 --> 00:38:57.400
all that allegorical,
it looks almost like a moral

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.980
lesson to us.
 

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.251
That's one example,
though, about how Origen thinks

00:39:01.251 --> 00:39:05.112
it's perfectly fine to get at
least two readings out of this

00:39:05.112 --> 00:39:06.030
same text.
 

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:09.838
Then you move to Augustine,
Now Augustine's a great

00:39:09.838 --> 00:39:10.599
example.
 

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:13.958
He's an example I use because
of a pre-modern practice of not

00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:17.371
just reading scripture for the
answers that it gives you about

00:39:17.371 --> 00:39:18.659
ethics or doctrine.
 

00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:21.684
Remember that section in the
readings where Augustine prays

00:39:21.684 --> 00:39:24.032
with scripture,
he prays the Psalms so he says

00:39:24.032 --> 00:39:25.666
things like,
Then I read,

00:39:25.666 --> 00:39:28.346
"Let your anger deter me
from sin"

00:39:28.346 --> 00:39:30.900
[which is a quotation from
Psalm 4:4].

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.150
How these words moved me,
my God.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.891
I had already learned to feel
for my past sins an anger with

00:39:35.891 --> 00:39:38.309
myself that would hold me back
from sinning again.

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:43.077
This is from Confessions
9.10 and it's on page 57 of my

00:39:43.077 --> 00:39:43.860
chapter.
 

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.601
Notice what Augustine's doing:
he feels like it's okay for him

00:39:47.601 --> 00:39:50.974
to get into the Psalm and put
himself in the role of the

00:39:50.974 --> 00:39:51.710
speaker.
 

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.460
What God is saying to the
psalmist,

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.380
Augustine says he was saying to
me,

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.175
personally, Augustine,
and then Augustine answers back

00:39:58.175 --> 00:39:59.760
with the words of the Psalm.
 

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.197
This is actually a reading of
scripture that's becoming

00:40:02.197 --> 00:40:04.590
popular more in certain modern
Christian contexts,

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.768
especially monastic communities
and churches.

00:40:06.768 --> 00:40:09.440
And it's called sometimes
lectio divina.

00:40:14.018 --> 00:40:17.219
This just means divine reading
in Latin.

00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:21.018
It refers to a practice that
some modern Christians are

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:24.958
trying to resurrect from a
pre-modern Christian practices

00:40:24.958 --> 00:40:28.264
of praying reading scripture,
memorizing scripture,

00:40:28.264 --> 00:40:30.793
and than using the words of
scripture as your own prayer to

00:40:30.793 --> 00:40:33.059
God so that God talks to you and
you talk to God.

00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:36.125
People are getting this stuff
straight from pre-modern

00:40:36.125 --> 00:40:36.820
practices.
 

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.822
Augustine is also a wonderful
example of the multiplicity of

00:40:39.822 --> 00:40:43.030
meanings that are contained in
the text all at the same time.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.514
For example,
on page 58, this is where he

00:40:46.514 --> 00:40:51.994
sees the Trinity in Genesis 1,
"In the beginning,"

00:40:51.994 --> 00:40:55.885
because of John 1:3-10,
you've read the Gospel of John

00:40:55.885 --> 00:40:58.465
the first part of John 1 cites
this "in the

00:40:58.465 --> 00:41:00.880
beginning"
but then goes on to say,

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.320
"That God created
everything through Jesus,

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.460
the logos,"
so Augustine looks at that in

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.371
the beginning and says,
oh that's a reference to John,

00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:11.530
the Gospel of John,
which means that he's talking

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.130
about Jesus here as also being
there.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.619
Then the spirit that moves over
the waters is the Holy Spirit.

00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:20.706
Then one of the most
fascinating things is the way he

00:41:20.706 --> 00:41:26.380
reads the six days of creation
in Genesis allegorically.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.112
On page 59 and around there,
he says on the first day,

00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:33.494
the vault--God created the
heavens and the earth,

00:41:33.494 --> 00:41:34.199
right?
 

00:41:34.199 --> 00:41:37.527
The word heaven there
translated doesn't mean what we

00:41:37.527 --> 00:41:39.320
think as space in the sky.
 

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.800
It referred to an actual firm
kind of vault,

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.068
like a dome,
a ceiling, and that's why in

00:41:46.068 --> 00:41:48.789
older translations it's called
the firmament,

00:41:48.789 --> 00:41:50.250
because it is firm.
 

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.360
It's not air; it's firm.
 

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.630
Augustine says,
the sky, when you look up at

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.956
the sky you see that blue thing,
that big blue dome that's above

00:41:57.956 --> 00:41:58.380
you.
 

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.253
We think of that as seeing
space, but ancient people

00:42:01.253 --> 00:42:01.760
didn't.
 

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.923
They thought they were actually
seeing like a big canvas spread

00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:05.690
over the sky.
 

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.349
The reason it's blue is because
water is behind it.

00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:11.724
It's holding back the water
that's in the sky,

00:42:11.724 --> 00:42:15.849
and the word "heaven"
refers to that thing.

00:42:15.849 --> 00:42:18.099
And so Augustine says,
it's like vellum,

00:42:18.099 --> 00:42:20.985
it's like the skin,
the leather that you make texts

00:42:20.985 --> 00:42:21.619
out of.
 

00:42:21.619 --> 00:42:24.340
And so he interprets
allegorically to say scripture.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.539
The making of the firmament in
Genesis refers to God's giving

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:29.590
us scripture.
 

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.329
And that's why angels--where do
angels live?

00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:33.077
They live on the other side of
scripture.

00:42:33.077 --> 00:42:33.340
Why?
 

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.460
Because they don't have to see
what's written because they know

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.179
everything already.
 

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:38.382
But we humans we live on this
side of scripture,

00:42:38.382 --> 00:42:40.538
and we look up and we read the
writings of God,

00:42:40.538 --> 00:42:42.599
and so we need scripture to
read things.

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:44.768
He goes through this elaborate
allegorical reading.

00:42:44.768 --> 00:42:48.356
Day two, the waters that
preside over the vault,

00:42:48.356 --> 00:42:52.400
they represent angelic peoples,
he says the angels.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.179
On day three,
the gathered-together sea--

00:42:55.179 --> 00:42:58.304
this is when Genesis says,
God separated the sea from the

00:42:58.304 --> 00:43:01.320
dry land and separated the water
from the dry land,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.449
the water he called sea,
the dry land he called earth.

00:43:03.449 --> 00:43:06.148
Augustine says,
okay the sea represents the

00:43:06.148 --> 00:43:09.907
bitter part of humanity;
the dry land represents those

00:43:09.907 --> 00:43:12.789
who thirst after righteousness
and God.

00:43:12.789 --> 00:43:15.023
And so God separates out,
on day three,

00:43:15.023 --> 00:43:17.726
good humanity from bad
humanity, by Augustine's

00:43:17.726 --> 00:43:19.550
allegorical interpretation.
 

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.324
All of these just are
illustrations of how Augustine

00:43:22.324 --> 00:43:25.425
knew how to read this text
literally, but he shows you how

00:43:25.425 --> 00:43:27.329
he also reads it allegorically.
 

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:29.378
He thinks that the text is full
of all these meanings,

00:43:29.378 --> 00:43:31.737
and it is perfectly legitimate
to get all of these meanings of

00:43:31.737 --> 00:43:32.239
the text.
 

00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:35.027
Then one of the most
fascinating is the one I gave

00:43:35.027 --> 00:43:36.849
you from Bernard of Clairvaux.
 

00:43:36.849 --> 00:43:40.279
This I think is so interesting
because Bernard is preaching on

00:43:40.279 --> 00:43:44.143
the Song of Songs,
that erotic part of the Hebrew

00:43:44.143 --> 00:43:45.891
Bible,
which is actually--to us

00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:47.610
moderns it just looks like a
love poem.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.291
But it was read allegorically
throughout the church,

00:43:50.291 --> 00:43:53.552
and even Rabbinic Judaism read
the Song of Songs as being about

00:43:53.552 --> 00:43:54.920
God and people Israel.
 

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.880
The bridegroom is God;
the bride is the people of

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.320
Israel.
 

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.349
Christian Fathers read that it
be about Jesus and the church,

00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:05.315
so Bernard is doing that,
but now notice this is a sermon

00:44:05.315 --> 00:44:08.289
being delivered to monks in a
monastery.

00:44:08.289 --> 00:44:11.056
These are men--they're all men
there--and if you realize that's

00:44:11.056 --> 00:44:13.376
the social setting of this text
it makes it read very

00:44:13.376 --> 00:44:14.090
differently.
 

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.833
Like this one big paragraph I
quoted, and I quote it again

00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:21.773
now, this is the young woman in
the Song of Songs speaking in

00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:22.760
his sermon.
 

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.710
I cannot rest until he kisses
me with the kiss of his mouth.

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:28.429
I thank him for the kiss of the
feet.

00:44:28.429 --> 00:44:30.550
I thank him,
too, for the kiss of the hand,

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:33.579
but if he has genuine regard
for me, let him kiss me with the

00:44:33.579 --> 00:44:34.690
kiss of his mouth.
 

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.570
There is no question of
ingratitude on my part;

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:38.070
it's simply that I am in love.
 

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.820
It is desire that drives me on,
not reason.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.724
Please do not accuse me of
presumption if I yield to this

00:44:43.724 --> 00:44:44.659
impulse of love.
 

00:44:44.659 --> 00:44:48.179
My shame indeed rebukes me,
but love is stronger than all.

00:44:48.179 --> 00:44:51.708
I ask, I crave,
I implore, let him kiss me with

00:44:51.708 --> 00:44:53.550
the kiss of his mouth.
 

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.902
Don't you see that by his grace
I have been for many years now

00:44:56.902 --> 00:44:59.210
careful to lead a chaste and
sober life?

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:03.322
I concentrate on spiritual
studies, resist vices,

00:45:03.322 --> 00:45:04.780
and pray often.
 

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.389
I am watchful against
temptations.

00:45:07.389 --> 00:45:10.210
I recount all my years in the
bitterness of my soul.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:13.449
As far as I can judge I have
lived among the brethren without

00:45:13.449 --> 00:45:13.989
quarrel.
 

00:45:13.989 --> 00:45:15.650
Lived among the brethren?
 

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.699
Wait, who are we talking about
now?

00:45:18.699 --> 00:45:24.000
Are we still talking about the
young girl?

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.409
"I have been submissive to
authority, responding to the

00:45:27.409 --> 00:45:30.530
beck and call of my superior in
the monastery."

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.510
Is this the girl?
 

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.880
"I do not covet goods not
mine.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.380
Rather I put myself and my
goods at the service of others.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.092
With sweat on my brow I ate my
bread, yet in all these

00:45:40.092 --> 00:45:42.500
practices there is evidence only
of my fidelity,

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.780
nothing of enjoyment.
 

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.534
I obey the commandments to the
best of my ability I hope,

00:45:46.534 --> 00:45:49.190
but in doing so my soul thirsts
like a parched land.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:51.800
If therefore he is to find my
holocaust acceptable,

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.880
let him kiss me I entreat with
a kiss of his mouth."

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.708
Halfway through this remarkable
quotation the girl morphs into

00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:00.579
the monk.
 

00:46:00.579 --> 00:46:05.159
The last part is a monk
talking, not a virgin girl.

00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:10.295
And yet this is a male monk
yearning for this male figure,

00:46:10.295 --> 00:46:13.630
and he's doing this in a
monastery.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.599
Isn't this kind of odd?
 

00:46:16.599 --> 00:46:20.320
He uses the eroticism of the
Song of Songs,

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.021
not to get rid of eroticism--I
don't think he's telling the

00:46:24.021 --> 00:46:26.829
monk you're going to have sex
with Jesus,

00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:30.239
but he certainly doesn't get
rid of the erotic at all.

00:46:30.239 --> 00:46:33.440
He doesn't explain it away or
try to get rid of it like Origen

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.429
would have done previously,
or some of the early Christian

00:46:36.429 --> 00:46:37.059
writers.
 

00:46:37.059 --> 00:46:40.644
In fact, he capitalizes on the
erotic and even turns it into

00:46:40.644 --> 00:46:44.231
the homoerotic because he's
asking the monk to identify with

00:46:44.231 --> 00:46:48.059
the body of the girl and to
yearn for this male bridegroom.

00:46:48.059 --> 00:46:51.429
Bernard reads this text not
only in an allegorical way so

00:46:51.429 --> 00:46:55.041
that the girl represents the
monk in a monastery who's trying

00:46:55.041 --> 00:46:57.690
to do the office:
he prays every night,

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.960
he does all the right things,
and he doesn't feel anything

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:00.400
about it.
 

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.516
He feels dry,
and barren, and so Bernard's

00:47:03.516 --> 00:47:07.847
using the erotic of the Song of
Songs to enliven the daily

00:47:07.847 --> 00:47:11.039
office of the monastery for the
monks.

00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:14.690
Then this other quotation,
this is where Bernard says,

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.451
oh, everybody whose lived a
monastic life knows that there's

00:47:17.451 --> 00:47:20.211
time when you go to the church
and you pray in the altar and

00:47:20.211 --> 00:47:23.250
you don't feel anything,
you just feel depressed,

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.369
you feel alone.
 

00:47:24.369 --> 00:47:26.583
He says,
Men with an urge to frequent

00:47:26.583 --> 00:47:28.570
prayer will have experience of
what I say.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:32.307
Often enough when we approach
the altar to pray [you might not

00:47:32.307 --> 00:47:34.452
initially feel all excited about
it]

00:47:34.452 --> 00:47:36.659
our hearts are dry and
lukewarm.

00:47:36.659 --> 00:47:42.250
But if we persevere there comes
an unexpected infusion of grace,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:50.320
our breast expands [the breasts
of the monks?],

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.918
as it were, our interior is
filled with an overflowing of

00:47:52.918 --> 00:47:54.873
love,
and if somebody should press on

00:47:54.873 --> 00:47:57.786
them then this milk of sweet
fecundity would gush forth in

00:47:57.786 --> 00:47:58.909
streaming richness.
 

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:01.500
He's talking about orgasm,
folks.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.675
He's describing orgasm,
the orgasm of a woman,

00:48:05.675 --> 00:48:10.596
the breast filling up,
swelling, and then experiencing

00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:12.360
this explosion.
 

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.762
Bernard is using orgasmic
language taken from the Song of

00:48:16.762 --> 00:48:21.400
Songs to talk to a bunch of
monks in the middle of the night

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.190
to get them to continue praying,
and to get them more excited

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.550
about giving themselves to
Jesus, the bridegroom.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:33.643
This is part of the remarkable
reading of the text of the Bible

00:48:33.643 --> 00:48:37.405
that you get in a pre-modern
world where they seem to feel

00:48:37.405 --> 00:48:41.302
remarkably free to read these
texts as containing a lot more

00:48:41.302 --> 00:48:45.659
meanings than a historian like
me would see them containing.

00:48:45.659 --> 00:48:48.347
Now I could go on and talk
about the Thomas Aquinas stuff,

00:48:48.347 --> 00:48:49.949
but it's just there as
examples.

00:48:49.949 --> 00:48:52.492
Aquinas is a wonderful example
of how he quotes one

00:48:52.492 --> 00:48:54.934
interpretation of John
Chrysostom and then quotes

00:48:54.934 --> 00:48:57.019
another interpretation of
Augustine,

00:48:57.019 --> 00:48:58.110
and he doesn't decide.
 

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.373
He just says,
okay they're both there,

00:48:59.373 --> 00:49:00.090
they're both valid.
 

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:04.059
He doesn't have any desire to
narrow down the meaning of the

00:49:04.059 --> 00:49:05.539
text to one meaning.
 

00:49:05.539 --> 00:49:09.539
I want you to think about this,
also,

00:49:09.539 --> 00:49:12.679
these are legitimate ways to
interpret this text,

00:49:12.679 --> 00:49:14.557
and at least they have been for
much of the history of

00:49:14.557 --> 00:49:15.090
Christianity.
 

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.900
The modern world tended to
reject them, but if you look

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.710
anywhere before the modern
period, you'll find them all

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:21.699
over the place.
 

00:49:21.699 --> 00:49:25.393
Experience some of this stuff
too when you go then to the Yale

00:49:25.393 --> 00:49:27.210
Art Gallery later this week.

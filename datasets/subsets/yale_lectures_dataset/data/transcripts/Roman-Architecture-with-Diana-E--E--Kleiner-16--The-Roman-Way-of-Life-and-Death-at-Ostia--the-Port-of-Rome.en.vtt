00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.480
Prof: Good morning, all.
 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.670
The title of today's lecture
is, "The Roman Way of Life

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.630
and Death at Ostia,
the Port of Rome."

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.766
On Tuesday we spoke about
architecture under the emperor

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:20.150
Hadrian, the extraordinary
emperor Hadrian.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.770
We talked about the buildings
that he commissioned,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.580
and some of which he also had a
hand in designing since,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.111
as we mentioned,
he was an amateur architect

00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:30.700
himself.
 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.637
We spoke about that Greek
import, the Temple of Venus and

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:37.269
Roma,
and also about the two major

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.930
commissions during his
principate,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.020
the Pantheon in Rome and
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.039
The main takeaway point
vis-Ã -vis both of these

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.237
buildings--
and you see them once again now

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:53.059
on the screen,
at left and right--is that

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.880
Hadrian followed the lead of
Trajan before him.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.856
What Trajan had done,
and Apollodorus of Damascus had

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:03.286
done,
in the Forum of Trajan and in

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:06.254
the Markets of Trajan,
and that is to combine,

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:10.242
in one building complex,
both the traditional and the

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:13.739
innovative strands of Roman
architecture.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.982
The traditional that goes back
to Greek and Etruscan

00:01:16.982 --> 00:01:20.670
architecture and is marked by
the traditional elements,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.430
the traditional vocabulary of
architecture,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.760
namely columns and walls and
the roofs that they support;

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.430
and then more innovative Roman
architecture,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.239
which is predicated on concrete
construction,

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:36.291
faced with a variety of
materials, from stone to what

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:40.810
we'll see today as the
ascendance of brick as a facing,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.947
which began,
as you'll recall,

00:01:42.947 --> 00:01:44.568
after the fire in A.D.
 

00:01:44.568 --> 00:01:45.599
64 in Rome.
 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.421
Again, looking at these two
buildings as examples of what

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:52.560
Hadrian, he and his architects,
tried to do.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.200
The Pantheon,
you'll recall on the left,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.881
has a traditional porch,
a porch that looks very much

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.706
like a typical Greek,
Etruscan or Roman temple,

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:07.170
but then a revolutionary body,
when you walk inside the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.433
building, a revolutionary
cylindrical drum and

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:12.030
hemispherical dome.
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.710
And then with regard to
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.278
I show you a view of the
Canopus, and you'll recall that

00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:23.460
the Canopus makes use of
columnar architecture.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.419
There are columns that border
one end of the pool,

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.197
although they are columns with
a twist because you can see they

00:02:31.197 --> 00:02:33.940
support a straight and an
arcuated lintel,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.910
which we saw in Second Style
Roman wall painting,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.555
in painting,
and then eventually it begins

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.000
to infiltrate built
architecture,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.370
comes to the fore under Hadrian.
 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.270
So that's a playing around with
those lintels in a way you

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.169
wouldn't have seen in Greek and
Etruscan architecture,

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.943
but still relies,
in the main,

00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:53.878
on the traditional vocabulary
of architecture.

00:02:53.878 --> 00:02:56.180
But then you'll recall,
on the other end of the pool,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.914
a building that was meant to
conjure up the Serapeum in the

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:07.389
Temple of Serapis in Canopus,
in Egypt, but that was made out

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.639
of concrete construction and
that had a segmented dome,

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.324
a kind of pumpkin dome that we
believe that Hadrian designed

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:15.949
himself.
 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.383
So this extraordinary
combination of traditional and

00:03:19.383 --> 00:03:23.848
innovative Roman architecture;
that we see the hallmark of

00:03:23.848 --> 00:03:28.381
Hadrianic architecture,
and a gift that he gave to the

00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:31.460
future evolution of
architecture.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.050
The other major contribution of
the Hadrianic period,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.025
that Hadrian himself had less
to do with because it was

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:42.043
already bubbling up after the
fire in A.D.

00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:45.798
64, is the move that we're
going to see today toward

00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:47.860
multi-storied housing.
 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.276
We saw that begin already at
the last gasp of Pompeii and

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:52.128
Herculaneum.
 

00:03:52.128 --> 00:03:54.258
You'll remember after the
earthquake of 62,

00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:58.930
and before the eruption of
Vesuvius,

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.918
the Pompeians and those who
lived in Herculaneum began to

00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:05.600
build,
began to add additional stories

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.415
to their residential structures,
and that meant for the most

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:13.270
part a second story being added
to their residential structures,

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.008
but they never went beyond that.
 

00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:18.019
What we see beginning to
happen, especially under

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.473
Hadrian,
is an increased taste for

00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:26.199
multi-storied buildings,
multi-storied domiciles,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.980
but multi-storied residences
that had more than two stories,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.855
even up to as many as five
stories: essentially apartment

00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:35.480
houses.
 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.100
And our best example for such
apartment houses are in the city

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.560
of Ostia,
the port city of Rome,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.721
and it's therefore to the city
of Ostia that we are going to

00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:47.920
turn to today.
 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.307
And, in fact,
we'll spend the entire lecture

00:04:50.307 --> 00:04:53.029
on the city of Ostia,
because like Pompeii and

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:56.452
Herculaneum before it,
especially like Pompeii,

00:04:56.452 --> 00:05:01.790
we have an extraordinary array
of not only private domiciles,

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.149
but also public architecture
from the city of Ostia that

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:08.874
gives us an outstanding sense of
what this city looked like in

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:09.730
antiquity.
 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.610
I show you a plan of Ostia in
its heyday.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.002
You'll remember that the city
was actually founded very early

00:05:17.002 --> 00:05:17.370
on.
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.617
At the very beginning of the
semester, we looked at the town

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:24.714
plan of Ostia,
which dated to the mid-fourth

00:05:24.714 --> 00:05:27.089
century B.C.,
around 350 B.C.

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:29.204
And you'll recall--and I'll
remind you of this plan in a

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.793
moment--
you'll recall that it was

00:05:31.793 --> 00:05:34.415
founded as--
it was actually Rome's first

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:36.473
colony,
although it was a colony in

00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:39.411
Italy obviously,
not outside the mainland,

00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:43.220
but its first colony in Italy,
or anywhere for that matter.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.646
And it was founded,
as so many of these first

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:49.449
colonies were,
as a military camp.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.524
It was laid out as a
castrum,

00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:52.649
as you'll recall.
 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:55.865
And that castrum,
one can see in the very

00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:57.730
center--
I'm going to show you a better

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.500
view of this from Ward-Perkins
in a moment--

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.377
but you can see that kernel of
the castrum plan right

00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:07.189
here in the center of this plan.
 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:11.024
But what this plan shows you is
the way in which the city grew

00:06:11.024 --> 00:06:11.778
over time.
 

00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:14.225
Again, it began in the
Republic, it continued to be

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:15.790
developed during the Republic.
 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.889
It was under Augustus that some
new buildings,

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.040
some public buildings were
added to the locale,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.983
including the Theater,
and we're going to look at the

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:24.889
Theater today.
 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.839
And then ports were added,
as you'll remember--and I'll

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.569
review that momentarily--ports
were added at Portus,

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.129
by Claudius and also by Trajan.
 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.970
And it was after the Port of
Trajan that the city really

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.949
began to take off in terms of
its commercial activity,

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.790
and much of the building that
we see in the city,

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.942
as it looks still today,
belongs to the Hadrianic period

00:06:50.942 --> 00:06:54.720
and into the time of the
successors of Hadrian,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.978
the so-called Antonine
emperors, whose architecture

00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:02.300
we'll also be studying this
semester.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.086
While this plan is on the
screen, let me just point out

00:07:06.086 --> 00:07:09.803
the location of Rome--
the arrow points this way--the

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:13.329
so-called Via Ostiense,
the route, the street that

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:16.540
leads from Rome to Ostia;
the Via Ostiense.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.297
And actually the city road
becomes the town--the country

00:07:22.297 --> 00:07:24.752
road;
the country thoroughfare

00:07:24.752 --> 00:07:27.980
becomes the city street,
the main city street,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.209
the decumanus of the
city of Ostia.

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:36.430
You can also see in this plan
the location of a place called

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.033
Isola Sacra, up there,
which we will see was the main

00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:43.069
cemetery for Ostia.
 

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:45.838
Yes, there are tombs outside
the city walls,

00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:49.379
also elsewhere in the city,
but our most- best-preserved

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.470
tombs are from this area called
Isola Sacra;

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.519
and I'll show that to you also
today.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:57.870
And here you can see the Tiber
River, the Tevere,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.569
the Tiber River wending its way
from Rome to Ostia.

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:05.911
And it is of course along the
Tiber that we'll see warehouses

00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:08.122
were located,
and where the ships went back

00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:09.610
and forth to export or import
material,

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:17.220
products from Rome to Ostia and
back again.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.220
Again, we talked about the
building of ports at Ostia.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.927
We talked especially about the
port that Claudius commissioned,

00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:27.394
at Portus, and I remind you of
it on the back of a Neronian

00:08:27.394 --> 00:08:31.064
coin, a coin of Nero;
obverse with Nero's portrait,

00:08:31.064 --> 00:08:34.139
reverse representing that
Claudian port.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.759
And we see it there.
 

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:39.176
You'll remember it had curved
breakwaters, which you can see

00:08:39.176 --> 00:08:42.418
in that coin depiction,
and a river god at the bottom;

00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:45.139
boats in the center,
as well as the lighthouse.

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:46.928
We see all of that on the coin.
 

00:08:46.928 --> 00:08:50.407
And you'll remember that the
breakwaters were made up of

00:08:50.407 --> 00:08:54.201
columns that partook of that
rusticated masonry that Claudius

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:55.149
so favored.
 

00:08:55.149 --> 00:08:58.139
Down here, a painting that I've
shown you before,

00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:02.620
that is on the walls of the
Vatican in Rome,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.033
the Vatican Museums in Rome,
where you can see Claudius'

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:08.792
port,
with its curved breakwaters and

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:10.690
its lighthouse over here.
 

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.350
And then the port that was
added by Trajan during his

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.870
reign, a multi-sided additional
port right here.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.934
And it was again the
construction of that particular

00:09:20.934 --> 00:09:23.759
port that really brought
commerce even more--

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:27.918
this area had been used since
the mid-fourth century B.C.,

00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:29.850
but it begins to really take
off;

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.870
there's a real efflorescence
during this period.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.955
And it is therefore not
surprising that with commerce

00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:41.668
booming there was more need for
residential architecture,

00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:44.638
for those who lived there,
for the traders and so on and

00:09:44.638 --> 00:09:47.602
so forth who lived there,
and we see this,

00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:52.782
the building of not only civic
buildings but especially of

00:09:52.782 --> 00:09:57.779
private domiciles begins to move
very rapidly apace.

00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:00.962
The city becomes more crowded
and there becomes this need to

00:10:00.962 --> 00:10:03.500
build up vertically,
as well as horizontally;

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.149
and we'll see that development
today.

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:10.495
Tourists who go to Rome really
miss the boat by not going out

00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:14.288
to Ostia in larger numbers,
because most tourists don't

00:10:14.288 --> 00:10:16.450
tend to take the trip out to
Ostia.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.509
But it's well worth it,
and it's very easy to get to.

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:23.740
It only takes about 25 minutes
to a half an hour on a suburban

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.168
train, to get from Rome to
Ostia.

00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:30.058
So it's a not-to-be-missed
experience.

00:10:30.058 --> 00:10:33.736
And I show you one of these
trains in the upper left that

00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:37.350
takes you very easily from Rome
to the site of Ostia.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.590
There are a number of stations
in Ostia.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.408
One of them is Ostia Centro,
the downtown of Ostia,

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.058
which you see in that view in
the upper left.

00:10:45.058 --> 00:10:47.851
And the other is Lido di Ostia,
which means "the

00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:51.288
beach," and I show you a
view of Lido di Ostia down here.

00:10:51.288 --> 00:10:53.288
Now looking at that nice view
of the ocean--

00:10:53.288 --> 00:10:55.730
I know you've all been,
you're back from spring break,

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.508
but still it's nice to
reminisce about what some of you

00:10:58.508 --> 00:11:01.133
may have been doing during
spring break and see this

00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:02.778
wonderful view of the scene.
 

00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:05.316
It looks very enticing,
but I can tell you that it's

00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:06.610
not, once you get there.
 

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.220
It's very polluted.
 

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.460
This is not one of the great
beaches of the world.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.320
So don't be seduced by Lido di
Ostia.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.363
Stay on the train and make your
way to the site called Scavi di

00:11:19.363 --> 00:11:21.541
Ostia,
which is the excavations of

00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:23.899
Ostia, the archaeological
excavations,

00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:26.668
where you can see,
as you saw, as one sees in

00:11:26.668 --> 00:11:29.096
Pompeii,
an ancient Roman city,

00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:31.149
extremely well preserved.
 

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:35.782
And you see a glimpse of it
over here, and you can tell even

00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:40.336
just from this glimpse that we
are dealing here with a city

00:11:40.336 --> 00:11:42.769
that is not unlike Pompeii.
 

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:47.004
It has streets and sidewalks,
and it has buildings along the

00:11:47.004 --> 00:11:48.870
side of either of those.
 

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.369
But there is one main
difference between this and what

00:11:51.369 --> 00:11:53.888
we saw at Pompeii--
and you can see it very well in

00:11:53.888 --> 00:11:56.754
this image--
and that is that these houses,

00:11:56.754 --> 00:12:00.388
that are along the street,
look different than those did

00:12:00.388 --> 00:12:03.129
in Pompeii in that they are made
out of concrete,

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:06.134
faced with brick:
a very different kind of

00:12:06.134 --> 00:12:08.403
appearance,
and one that is

00:12:08.403 --> 00:12:12.962
quintessentially Ostian and
makes this city well worth a

00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:13.710
visit.
 

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.399
In fact, if we think of Pompeii
as the quintessential

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:18.820
first-century A.D.
 

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.856
Roman city, we should think of
the city of Ostia as the

00:12:22.856 --> 00:12:25.548
quintessential second-century
A.D.

00:12:25.548 --> 00:12:28.928
city, the best example that we
have of what a second century,

00:12:28.928 --> 00:12:33.820
a Hadrianic and Antonine city,
would have looked like,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.870
and that is what makes it so
important to us.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.200
Here I remind you again of the
original plan that we looked at,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.538
the plan from the mid-fourth
century B.C.,

00:12:43.538 --> 00:12:48.081
350 B.C., from Ward-Perkins,
that shows you the original

00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:53.200
castrum of the first
colony: this rectangular space,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.844
very regular,
with its own wall surrounding

00:12:55.844 --> 00:12:58.163
the city,
with the cardo,

00:12:58.163 --> 00:13:00.985
the north-south street,
and the decumanus,

00:13:00.985 --> 00:13:04.081
the east-west street,
intersecting exactly at the

00:13:04.081 --> 00:13:05.740
center of that city.
 

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.340
And then at that intersection,
as was Roman practice,

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.418
the placement of the forum of
the city,

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:16.923
a great open rectangular space
with a temple pushed up against

00:13:16.923 --> 00:13:19.144
the back wall,
in this case a Temple of

00:13:19.144 --> 00:13:22.325
Jupiter, a Capitolium,
dominating the space in front

00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:24.565
of it,
and then other buildings around

00:13:24.565 --> 00:13:26.190
it,
as you can see.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.908
Although there's a striking
difference between this forum

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.850
and the forum that we saw at
Pompeii,

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.275
because you'll remember at
Pompeii the various major

00:13:34.275 --> 00:13:35.836
buildings,
the Basilica,

00:13:35.836 --> 00:13:40.302
the Temple of Apollo,
and so on, sort of radiating

00:13:40.302 --> 00:13:44.950
out from the central core of the
forum.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.620
We don't see that here.
 

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.152
We see the buildings sort of
placed separately,

00:13:51.152 --> 00:13:54.009
from that main forum space.
 

00:13:54.009 --> 00:13:56.414
But in every other respect very
similar to the general plan of

00:13:56.414 --> 00:13:57.519
these early Roman cities .
 

00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:00.798
What's also useful about this
particular plan is the fact that

00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:05.287
it shows you the way,
as time went by and as the city

00:14:05.287 --> 00:14:06.865
grew,
it shows you the way in which

00:14:06.865 --> 00:14:08.580
the cardo and the
decumanus were extended,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.660
and then the other buildings of
the city were added here and

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.759
there: a number of baths;
lots of private residences.

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:21.149
This is a particularly
important building here at 15

00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:23.515
and 16,
which we'll look at today:

00:14:23.515 --> 00:14:26.644
15 is the Theater and 16 is the
so-called Piazza of the

00:14:26.644 --> 00:14:28.942
Corporations,
the Piazzale delle

00:14:28.942 --> 00:14:32.009
Corporazioni,
which is very significant,

00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:35.519
and we'll look at that soon.
 

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:39.048
If you go and visit the city of
Ostia today,

00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:44.923
and enter at the ticket booth,
what you see almost immediately

00:14:44.923 --> 00:14:48.679
is again a polygonal masonry
street,

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:51.210
looking very much like Pompeii.
 

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.330
But once again there are no
stepping stones in Ostia,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.022
unlike Pompeii -- the plot
thickens there in terms of why

00:14:59.022 --> 00:15:02.846
we see those in Pompeii and
don't seem to see them anywhere

00:15:02.846 --> 00:15:03.440
else.
 

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.831
You walk along that polygonal
masonry street pavement and you

00:15:07.831 --> 00:15:12.296
see both the remains up here in
the upper left of the original

00:15:12.296 --> 00:15:15.740
Republican city wall,
and it should bring back

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.048
memories of opus
quadratum,

00:15:18.048 --> 00:15:20.224
or ashlar masonry,
that we saw at the beginning of

00:15:20.224 --> 00:15:20.889
the semester.
 

00:15:20.889 --> 00:15:23.687
You can see it's consistent
with the age in which it was

00:15:23.687 --> 00:15:24.908
built in the Republic.
 

00:15:24.908 --> 00:15:27.758
But then over here,
as you make your way along on

00:15:27.758 --> 00:15:32.635
one of the main streets,
you see what is characteristic

00:15:32.635 --> 00:15:35.625
of Ostia as a whole,
and that is concrete

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:36.591
construction,
brick-faced concrete

00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:38.754
construction,
both for the residences and

00:15:38.754 --> 00:15:41.982
also for the public buildings,
and also for the religious

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:47.250
structures,
namely the temples in this city.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.571
The reason for this,
of course--it takes us back to

00:15:49.571 --> 00:15:52.404
the Neronian period,
the great fire of 64,

00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:56.091
when it was realized --
you'll remember the Subura,

00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:59.807
which was located back beyond
the precinct walls of the Forum

00:15:59.807 --> 00:16:03.001
of Augustus,
the area where the working poor

00:16:03.001 --> 00:16:05.957
of Rome lived,
primarily in rickety apartment

00:16:05.957 --> 00:16:08.080
houses that were made out of
wood;

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.480
multi-storied houses.
 

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.778
Those were actually
multi-storied,

00:16:10.778 --> 00:16:12.850
but they were always going up
in flames,

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.139
and there was a recognition
after the great destruction of

00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:19.313
the fire of 64 that the Romans
needed to fireproof their

00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:22.221
buildings,
and they recognized the fact

00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:26.013
that brick is better at
protecting the structure from

00:16:26.013 --> 00:16:29.514
fire than stone is,
and stone can burn,

00:16:29.514 --> 00:16:33.458
and they actually began to--
as we know, we talked about

00:16:33.458 --> 00:16:35.676
this before--
they began to build their

00:16:35.676 --> 00:16:39.683
houses and many of their civic
structures out of concrete faced

00:16:39.683 --> 00:16:40.590
with brick.
 

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.990
And we see that development
especially well here in Ostia.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.352
And Ostia is extremely
important for us also because

00:16:48.352 --> 00:16:52.376
many comparable buildings that
were put up in the city of Rome

00:16:52.376 --> 00:16:54.288
itself no longer survive.
 

00:16:54.288 --> 00:16:57.307
The same apartment houses that
we're going to see at Ostia did

00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:58.100
exist in Rome.
 

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.629
We have some remains of them.
 

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:03.096
There's a very prominent one at
the base of the Capitoline Hill,

00:17:03.096 --> 00:17:05.960
to the left of the hill as you
climb up that hill.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.400
But we have very little
evidence for this in Rome,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.682
and so we have to rely on Ostia
to give us the best picture of

00:17:13.682 --> 00:17:18.483
apartment building in Rome,
in Roman architecture in the

00:17:18.483 --> 00:17:20.410
second century A.D.
 

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:25.538
Here is a spectacular view of
Ostia as it looks today,

00:17:25.538 --> 00:17:28.164
from the air,
and we are obviously looking

00:17:28.164 --> 00:17:31.109
down on the forum,
on the great open rectangular

00:17:31.109 --> 00:17:34.288
space of the forum,
with columns around it.

00:17:34.288 --> 00:17:36.588
We are looking also at the
Capitolium,

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:39.840
at the Temple of Jupiter,
which is a very large

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.307
structure,
as you can see here,

00:17:42.307 --> 00:17:45.838
made out of concrete,
faced with brick.

00:17:45.838 --> 00:17:49.190
It is a typical Roman temple,
unlike Hadrian's Temple of

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.930
Venus and Roma,
because we can see that it has

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.500
a faÃ§ade orientation;
it has a single staircase;

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.013
it has a deep porch,
freestanding columns in that

00:17:59.013 --> 00:17:59.598
porch.
 

00:17:59.598 --> 00:18:04.463
So a typical Roman structure
and--it's a typical Roman

00:18:04.463 --> 00:18:05.288
temple.
 

00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:08.180
And then you can also see its
vast scale.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.211
There are a couple of people
standing here who look miniscule

00:18:11.211 --> 00:18:13.028
in relationship to this
building,

00:18:13.028 --> 00:18:15.663
and only part of the building,
in fact the full height of the

00:18:15.663 --> 00:18:18.598
building,
is not even preserved here.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:21.670
So it was even larger still
than what you see.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.374
The reason for its size is
twofold: one,

00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:28.396
because we have already seen
that this taste for larger and

00:18:28.396 --> 00:18:31.308
larger buildings has really
taken off.

00:18:31.308 --> 00:18:33.868
We saw it in Hadrian's Forum in
Rome.

00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:36.630
We saw it in Domitian's Palace
on the Palatine Hill.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.615
We saw it in Hadrian's Villa at
Tivoli, and in the Pantheon,

00:18:40.615 --> 00:18:43.858
the largest span,
the largest dome ever built.

00:18:43.858 --> 00:18:47.615
So this taste for largeness,
grandiosity in architecture,

00:18:47.615 --> 00:18:49.160
has really taken off.
 

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.191
So it's not surprising to see
this Capitolium,

00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:54.818
which was built in the
Hadrianic period,

00:18:54.818 --> 00:18:58.390
specifically 120 A.D.,
also being large in scale.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.097
But there's a second and
perhaps even more important

00:19:01.097 --> 00:19:03.785
reason,
and that is in a city in which

00:19:03.785 --> 00:19:06.467
all of the--
most of the houses are what are

00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:10.509
called insulae--
i-n-s-u-l-a in the singular;

00:19:10.509 --> 00:19:12.739
a-e in the
plural--insulae,

00:19:12.739 --> 00:19:16.320
multi-storied apartment
buildings, often of as many as

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.470
five stories.
 

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.119
If you want your Capitolium to
stand out in that city,

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:24.080
and be seen up above those
apartment houses,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.630
you've got to build it very
high.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.528
And that is undoubtedly the
reason that they--

00:19:29.528 --> 00:19:32.440
one of the two reasons,
the more important reason--

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.759
that they have built this
temple so large,

00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:38.329
and especially so tall,
so that you could see the

00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:42.568
Temple of Jupiter from
everywhere in the city of Ostia.

00:19:42.568 --> 00:19:45.259
Here's a view of the Temple as
it looks today in isolation,

00:19:45.259 --> 00:19:48.140
again, only part of its height
preserved,

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.058
but enough for us to get a very
good sense of its concrete

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:54.567
construction,
brick facing here,

00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:59.240
and as I've already described,
the single staircase,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.960
the columns in the porch and so
on.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.125
I mentioned already that it was
under Augustus that a theater

00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:11.568
and an entertainment district
was added to the city of Ostia,

00:20:11.568 --> 00:20:16.348
and that building,
you see the remains of it here,

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:20.588
along one of the major streets
of the city of Ostia.

00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:27.009
It was renovated in around 200
A.D.;

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:28.720
that is, in the early part of
the third century A.D.,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.509
so considerably later.
 

00:20:29.509 --> 00:20:34.944
It was expanded to be able to
hold 2,500 spectators at that

00:20:34.944 --> 00:20:39.219
particular point,
and much of the concrete and

00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:43.759
brick-faced construction belongs
to that renovation.

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:47.825
One can't imagine a building
quite like this in the age of

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:48.608
Augustus.
 

00:20:48.608 --> 00:20:53.005
So what you're seeing here is
primarily the restored view,

00:20:53.005 --> 00:20:56.088
the restored version of this
building.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:21:00.042
But what you can see,
that does at least link it back

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:03.344
to the Augustan period,
is the fact that the design of

00:21:03.344 --> 00:21:05.682
the faÃ§ade is very
similar to the design of the

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.382
Theater of Marcellus in Rome,
with the arches,

00:21:08.382 --> 00:21:11.720
and in this case pilasters
between them --

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.097
that same general scheme that
we saw for theater and for

00:21:15.097 --> 00:21:18.200
amphitheater architecture,
used here.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.821
The main difference,
of course, is the fact that we

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.338
have concrete construction with
brick facing,

00:21:23.338 --> 00:21:26.970
rather than concrete
construction with stone facing,

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.608
travertine in the case of the
Theater of Marcellus.

00:21:31.608 --> 00:21:35.230
I haven't yet shown you a Roman
latrine, but today is the day

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.680
for the Roman latrine.
 

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.880
But you have to imagine,
of course,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.220
that in any major public
building, like a theater,

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.080
where you're going to have a
lot of people there at the same

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.474
time,
you have to provide a public

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:49.118
latrine.
 

00:21:49.118 --> 00:21:53.448
And when I say a public
latrine, I really mean a public

00:21:53.448 --> 00:21:54.250
latrine.
 

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.670
There was no privacy,
as you can see,

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.618
in this latrine whatsoever.
 

00:21:58.618 --> 00:22:02.220
What it is composed of,
as you can see,

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.657
is a bench that lines the
walls, with a series of holes in

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:09.080
it,
and then just one single drain

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.038
that encircles the building.
 

00:22:12.038 --> 00:22:15.517
So this gives you an idea of
where you had to go,

00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:18.414
if you needed to go,
during intermission,

00:22:18.414 --> 00:22:21.818
if you were attending the
Theater in Ostia.

00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:25.671
One of the most important
buildings at Ostia is connected

00:22:25.671 --> 00:22:26.910
to this Theater.
 

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.872
I'm showing you now the plan of
the Theater, which corresponds

00:22:30.872 --> 00:22:34.769
to theaters that we've looked at
throughout this semester;

00:22:34.769 --> 00:22:36.190
a typical Roman plan.
 

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.000
It has a semi-circular
orchestra.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.009
It has a stage building or
scaenae frons here.

00:22:43.009 --> 00:22:46.571
It has a semicircular
cavea,

00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:52.964
the seats, which are placed on
top of, of course in this case,

00:22:52.964 --> 00:22:55.690
a concrete foundation.
 

00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.127
This, like other Roman
theaters, is an urban

00:23:00.127 --> 00:23:01.470
phenomenon.
 

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.298
There was no hill to build this
on,

00:23:04.298 --> 00:23:07.393
so the Romans had to build--the
Ostians had to build their own

00:23:07.393 --> 00:23:09.682
hill out of concrete,
and then support the

00:23:09.682 --> 00:23:11.240
cavea on top of that.
 

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.788
But the cavea is made of
stone seats;

00:23:13.788 --> 00:23:17.078
they used stone for the seats,
as is traditional in Roman

00:23:17.078 --> 00:23:18.430
theater architecture.
 

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:25.660
But we see that this Theater is
appended to a porticus.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.557
Now we've seen a
porticus with these

00:23:28.557 --> 00:23:31.582
theaters before;
it was in fact characteristic

00:23:31.582 --> 00:23:32.750
of theater design.
 

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.838
And if you think back to the
Theater in Pompeii,

00:23:35.838 --> 00:23:37.412
for example,
you'll remember that that

00:23:37.412 --> 00:23:41.858
porticus,
which had little shops all

00:23:41.858 --> 00:23:45.623
around it,
or small cubicles all around

00:23:45.623 --> 00:23:50.162
it, was used as a place where
you could go during intermission

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:52.203
to relax,
to walk around,

00:23:52.203 --> 00:23:55.571
to buy a playbill,
to pick up a souvenir T-shirt

00:23:55.571 --> 00:23:58.724
or whatever the equivalent was
in those days:

00:23:58.724 --> 00:24:03.240
a souvenir of your experience
that evening at the theater.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.358
And so we see that same general
scheme here,

00:24:07.358 --> 00:24:09.230
this whole idea of this open
rectangular space,

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.031
with some columns,
and then with these little

00:24:12.031 --> 00:24:13.368
cubicles all along.
 

00:24:13.368 --> 00:24:17.107
But in this case it was not
meant to be a place for

00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:19.950
souvenirs or a place to store
props.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.118
But instead what we see is
something quite fascinating,

00:24:23.118 --> 00:24:27.467
given the fact that the city of
Ostia was primarily a commercial

00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:30.460
city,
a place where items were

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.798
exported and imported.
 

00:24:32.798 --> 00:24:36.578
Because it was a major port or
harbor city,

00:24:36.578 --> 00:24:40.211
what this was used for
instead--hence its name the

00:24:40.211 --> 00:24:46.037
Piazzale delle Corporazioni--
is a series of businesses that

00:24:46.037 --> 00:24:48.917
were--
the import/export business

00:24:48.917 --> 00:24:52.720
essentially is what these spaces
were used for.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.710
And I'll show you.
 

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.836
Actually some of them are quite
well preserved and I can show

00:24:57.836 --> 00:24:59.660
you indeed what they looked
like.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.786
Then in the center something we
also don't see in the Pompeii

00:25:02.786 --> 00:25:05.325
Theater,
a small temple in the center,

00:25:05.325 --> 00:25:09.324
a temple that corresponds to
Roman temples that we've looked

00:25:09.324 --> 00:25:11.900
at thus far: its rectangular
shape;

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.319
its flat side and back walls;
some columns in the deep porch;

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:20.057
a single staircase;
faÃ§ade emphasis,

00:25:20.057 --> 00:25:22.943
as you can see here;
relatively small in scale,

00:25:22.943 --> 00:25:24.788
as these kinds of things go.
 

00:25:24.788 --> 00:25:29.413
And it has been speculated by
the main excavator of this site

00:25:29.413 --> 00:25:34.116
that it was used as a--that it
was dedicated to some god whose

00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:36.957
name we don't know;
we don't know which god or

00:25:36.957 --> 00:25:38.230
goddess this was dedicated to.
 

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.986
But the excavator has
speculated that it was probably

00:25:41.986 --> 00:25:45.670
some god that had something to
do with commerce,

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.097
and the blessing of commerce,
and that probably some trade

00:25:49.097 --> 00:25:51.269
guild,
one of the trade guilds that

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:54.003
had its businesses set up here,
may have been the

00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:55.680
commissioners,
may have paid for,

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.288
indeed commissioned this
particular temple.

00:25:59.288 --> 00:26:02.405
And I think that's as good a
theory as any,

00:26:02.405 --> 00:26:04.410
and may well be the case.
 

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:08.481
This is a view--we're standing
at the top of the cavea,

00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:11.019
looking down over that
cavea.

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:13.868
We can see the cunei or
wedge-shaped sections of seats.

00:26:13.868 --> 00:26:18.670
We can see the stone that has
been used for those seats.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:22.108
We can see the semicircular
orchestra,

00:26:22.108 --> 00:26:29.522
the scalloped face of the
stage, and then one can imagine

00:26:29.522 --> 00:26:34.827
the scaenae frons,
with its forest of columns

00:26:34.827 --> 00:26:37.608
behind;
that part is not well preserved.

00:26:37.608 --> 00:26:40.612
And there also would have
been--I'll show you a restored

00:26:40.612 --> 00:26:43.941
view a little bit later where
you'll see that there was a much

00:26:43.941 --> 00:26:47.490
higher wall in between this and
the Piazzale that lay beyond.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.092
The wall is no longer there,
so we can see very well through

00:26:51.092 --> 00:26:53.906
these columns,
the small temple that was put

00:26:53.906 --> 00:26:57.108
up by that trade guild,
to some god of commerce.

00:26:57.108 --> 00:27:02.334
And then we can also see these
cubicles all along the way,

00:27:02.334 --> 00:27:07.098
that were used as these import
and export emporia.

00:27:07.098 --> 00:27:09.950
This is a view of the temple as
it looks today.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.556
We can see that single
staircase, fairly narrow

00:27:12.556 --> 00:27:14.970
staircase here;
the faÃ§ade orientation;

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.452
a couple of the columns,
including a Corinthian column,

00:27:18.452 --> 00:27:21.868
that are still preserved from
that small structure.

00:27:21.868 --> 00:27:26.970
And then here a very useful
view showing us again these

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.598
interesting spaces,
rectangular spaces along here,

00:27:31.598 --> 00:27:35.000
fronted in each case by
columns.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.628
We'll see that those columns
are made out of cement,

00:27:37.628 --> 00:27:40.721
faced with brick -- so shades
of the Sanctuary of Hercules at

00:27:40.721 --> 00:27:41.288
Tivoli.
 

00:27:41.288 --> 00:27:44.009
We haven't seen this before,
I mean, since then.

00:27:44.009 --> 00:27:48.019
And that was a very unusual
view.

00:27:48.019 --> 00:27:51.256
Here we're seeing something
that actually becomes more

00:27:51.256 --> 00:27:54.674
common in the second century,
making concrete columns and

00:27:54.674 --> 00:27:56.630
then facing them with brick.
 

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.703
I'd like to show you a few
views of these import/export

00:28:00.703 --> 00:28:04.315
businesses, as I've called them;
one of them here,

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:07.083
where we can see that the
architecture itself,

00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:10.650
the walls and the columns are
only partially preserved.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.861
You have to imagine that in
antiquity they went up higher

00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:14.548
than this.
 

00:28:14.548 --> 00:28:19.604
But what is well preserved are
the mosaics on the floor of each

00:28:19.604 --> 00:28:22.538
of these, or many of these
spaces.

00:28:22.538 --> 00:28:26.105
And you can see they're all
done in black-and-white mosaic,

00:28:26.105 --> 00:28:27.460
just the two colors.
 

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:32.313
You can see the interest that
the Ostians had in geometric

00:28:32.313 --> 00:28:33.078
shapes.
 

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:38.361
They have inside these very
abstract, inside the shop here,

00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:42.732
these abstract patterns,
although they've made an

00:28:42.732 --> 00:28:45.009
attempt to vary them.
 

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:47.260
But then in the front,
something very interesting,

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.650
that we see throughout,
is the use of sea imagery.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.170
Because again they were in the
import and export business,

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.440
they were busy sending ships
back and forth,

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.420
from Italy to other parts of
the Roman world by sea,

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.578
and so it's almost all sea
imagery.

00:29:01.578 --> 00:29:04.719
Here we see two heraldic
dolphins--dolphins are

00:29:04.719 --> 00:29:07.450
particularly popular in these
scenes--

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.320
facing one another,
as a kind of advertisement or

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.788
shop sign for this particular
enterprise.

00:29:14.788 --> 00:29:17.374
Here's another one,
where you can see--I like this

00:29:17.374 --> 00:29:20.219
dolphin in particular;
he's nicely preserved and he

00:29:20.219 --> 00:29:23.660
has a wonderful serpentine tail,
with a lot of flourish at the

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.240
end here, as you can see.
 

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.410
And then inside an image of a
boat;

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.509
you can see it's partially
preserved.

00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:34.856
What's wonderful about this
example is it shows us that

00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:37.710
although these are fairly simple
in design,

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:43.009
and are meant essentially as
advertisements for the shop,

00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:45.920
the artist and the patron have
taken real care to think about

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.538
what you're going to see when
you're standing where.

00:29:48.538 --> 00:29:51.664
So that they have oriented
these so that when you're facing

00:29:51.664 --> 00:29:55.058
the shop and deciding whether
you're going to pick this one--

00:29:55.058 --> 00:29:56.958
there's 61 of these,
by the way, around the

00:29:56.958 --> 00:29:59.790
perimeter of this structure,
so you had a lot of choice,

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:02.390
in terms of which enterprise
you were going to,

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:06.019
where you were going to go to.
 

00:30:06.019 --> 00:30:08.507
If you wanted to ship something
from Ostia somewhere else,

00:30:08.507 --> 00:30:10.690
or receive a delivery,
you had a lot of choices.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.583
Although I don't doubt some of
them specialized in different

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:15.936
parts of the world,
shipping to Egypt or shipping

00:30:15.936 --> 00:30:16.818
to Asia Minor.
 

00:30:16.818 --> 00:30:20.000
But you can see here the
dolphin.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.615
When you're standing,
deciding whether you want to go

00:30:22.615 --> 00:30:24.630
in, the dolphin,
you face the dolphin.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.930
Once you're inside,
and standing and talking to the

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.824
owner, if you turn around and
look back, you're going to see

00:30:31.824 --> 00:30:33.210
the boat head on.
 

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.625
So they've really--they've
orchestrated this in such

00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:38.935
a--they've paid real attention;
it's not done willy-nilly,

00:30:38.935 --> 00:30:42.698
they've paid attention to what
you're going to see where,

00:30:42.698 --> 00:30:45.990
when you are entering and
inside these spaces.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.078
Here's another one,
not only dolphins,

00:30:48.078 --> 00:30:50.252
dolphins, dolphins,
more dolphins and more

00:30:50.252 --> 00:30:52.996
dolphins,
but you also see in this case a

00:30:52.996 --> 00:30:54.813
lighthouse,
which could either be a

00:30:54.813 --> 00:30:56.558
representation of their local
lighthouse,

00:30:56.558 --> 00:31:00.883
or some lighthouse somewhere
else that this particular place

00:31:00.883 --> 00:31:01.690
ships to.
 

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.549
And then the last one,
which is the one on your

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:06.538
Monument List,
with two boats.

00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:11.528
So again, how does one ship
things from Ostia elsewhere?

00:31:11.528 --> 00:31:13.680
By boat, and so they tend to
represent boats.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:19.104
So you've kind of seen it all;
dolphins, boats and lighthouses

00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:22.837
tend to be the items that are
chosen for these so-called

00:31:22.837 --> 00:31:24.058
advertisements.
 

00:31:24.058 --> 00:31:28.101
But this one is very useful too
because you can see the shapes

00:31:28.101 --> 00:31:31.413
and the colors of the
tesserae that are used

00:31:31.413 --> 00:31:32.009
here.
 

00:31:32.009 --> 00:31:34.269
And although these are very
effective, you can see that this

00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:37.152
is not the Alexander Mosaic;
these are not done with that

00:31:37.152 --> 00:31:38.078
kind of skill.
 

00:31:38.078 --> 00:31:42.019
They use only black and white,
the simplest possible scheme,

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:44.980
no colors, and you don't get
the sense,

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.910
as you do with something like
the Alexander Mosaic,

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.880
when you step back from it,
it could almost be a painting,

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.890
it's done that well,
with the cast shadows and the

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:57.000
crumpling figures so well
presented.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.426
Here it's something quite
different, more abstract,

00:31:59.426 --> 00:32:01.028
and the stones are not as fine.
 

00:32:01.028 --> 00:32:03.886
You can see they haven't paid
as much attention to getting

00:32:03.886 --> 00:32:05.088
them perfectly shaped.
 

00:32:05.088 --> 00:32:08.619
But nonetheless it's very
effective, and it really

00:32:08.619 --> 00:32:11.430
does--it does what it intended
to do.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:13.048
One of the sad things--it's
great to see,

00:32:13.048 --> 00:32:15.355
and if you go out to Ostia,
make a special point of seeing

00:32:15.355 --> 00:32:16.568
these and taking pictures.
 

00:32:16.568 --> 00:32:21.048
Because I've been looking at
these for many years,

00:32:21.048 --> 00:32:23.740
and every time I'm there it
seems that there are fewer

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.958
tesserae there--
these are the originals--there

00:32:25.958 --> 00:32:27.538
are fewer tesserae than
there were before.

00:32:27.538 --> 00:32:29.190
I'm not saying that people take
them,

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.848
although I think people do take
them,

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:34.736
but just that over time,
by tourists walking on them

00:32:34.736 --> 00:32:39.077
extensively,
they get loose and they get

00:32:39.077 --> 00:32:43.342
spread around the site,
and they haven't done as good a

00:32:43.342 --> 00:32:44.940
job as I think they should at
Ostia,

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.519
in keeping these mosaics
together.

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:51.118
Here's a restored view of the
whole complex,

00:32:51.118 --> 00:32:54.978
where I think you can see that,
although the Theater and the

00:32:54.978 --> 00:32:57.660
Piazzale are connected to one
another,

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.568
and are part of the same
scheme, and are a development,

00:33:00.568 --> 00:33:02.328
a further development in
evolution,

00:33:02.328 --> 00:33:05.096
that is particularly
appropriate for this commercial

00:33:05.096 --> 00:33:08.326
city of Ostia,
that comes out of the orbit of

00:33:08.326 --> 00:33:12.173
that earlier theater and
porticus complex at

00:33:12.173 --> 00:33:13.019
Pompeii.
 

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:15.376
We can see that although
they're part of that same

00:33:15.376 --> 00:33:17.588
complex, they are distinct from
one another.

00:33:17.588 --> 00:33:19.880
If you look at the Theater and
the cavea up above,

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.558
with the original wall of the
scaenae frons preserved--

00:33:23.558 --> 00:33:26.202
we're looking at it from the
back--you can see that that was

00:33:26.202 --> 00:33:26.740
very high.
 

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.722
So only if you were way up at
the top of the cavea

00:33:29.722 --> 00:33:32.440
would you really get a sense of
what lay beyond,

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.068
and once you got into the
Piazzale over here,

00:33:35.068 --> 00:33:38.220
with its temple,
and with its various shops,

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.220
you were in another world,
a commercial world.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.531
Also interesting is the fact
that although they're open to

00:33:44.531 --> 00:33:47.182
the sky today,
in antiquity there was a

00:33:47.182 --> 00:33:49.749
covered colonnade,
as you can see here,

00:33:49.749 --> 00:33:51.990
that would have covered those
shops,

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:56.527
and you would have had to go in
between the columns and back

00:33:56.527 --> 00:34:01.680
along the passageway in order to
check out what the options were.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.185
The city of Ostia,
like all Roman cities that

00:34:04.185 --> 00:34:06.276
we've talked about--
Rome, Pompeii,

00:34:06.276 --> 00:34:07.769
Herculaneum,
and so on--

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:12.030
all obviously had a selection
of bath establishments.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:14.059
Ostia was no exception.
 

00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:18.507
There are a number of baths
preserved, from the Roman city

00:34:18.507 --> 00:34:22.800
of Ostia, this being one of
them, the so-called Baths of

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.094
Neptune, that dates to 139 A.D.;
the Baths of Neptune,

00:34:27.094 --> 00:34:30.134
so called because of the
spectacular mosaic,

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:33.809
black-and-white mosaic,
of Neptune, on the floor.

00:34:33.809 --> 00:34:36.204
I'll show it to you in a
moment, but go into it in more

00:34:36.204 --> 00:34:37.800
detail a bit later in the
lecture.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.510
If we look at the plan of the
Baths of Neptune in Ostia,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.876
I wondered if any of you can
tell me whether this is a plan

00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:51.469
that corresponds to the earlier
bath buildings at Pompeii--

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:55.010
the Stabian Baths or the Forum
Baths--

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.721
or conforms more closely to the
imperial bath type that we saw

00:34:57.721 --> 00:34:59.755
in Rome,
from the time of Titus,

00:34:59.755 --> 00:35:02.510
let's say the Baths of Titus
and Trajan.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:03.909
Any thoughts?
 

00:35:09.909 --> 00:35:12.260
You grimaced,
but maybe I'll ask you.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.219
Do you have a--pick on you.
 

00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:15.139
Student:  The earlier
one.

00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:16.813
Prof: The earlier one,
absolutely.

00:35:16.813 --> 00:35:18.110
And why, why do you say that?
 

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:22.623
Student: Because the
central open area and the

00:35:22.623 --> 00:35:26.442
palaestra,
and then the series of bath

00:35:26.442 --> 00:35:27.309
rooms.
 

00:35:27.309 --> 00:35:28.894
Prof: Excellent,
excellent, that's exactly

00:35:28.894 --> 00:35:29.159
right.
 

00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:32.054
We see the palaestra on
one side, with the

00:35:32.054 --> 00:35:34.286
natatio,
or the piscina,

00:35:34.286 --> 00:35:36.880
that usually accompanied it,
over here.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.768
And then on the other side,
all aligned in a row,

00:35:39.768 --> 00:35:42.230
the typical bath,
the bathing block,

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.474
including the
apodyterium,

00:35:45.474 --> 00:35:49.760
the tepidarium,
the caldarium and the

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.681
frigidarium;
although the frigidarium

00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:55.000
is not a round alcoved structure
at all --

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.467
so in that sense perhaps
influenced by some of what came

00:35:58.467 --> 00:36:02.313
in between those early baths at
Pompeii and the imperial baths

00:36:02.313 --> 00:36:03.070
in Rome.
 

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:06.989
But, and of course also note
here the shops that line the

00:36:06.989 --> 00:36:10.179
front of it,
which is also characteristic of

00:36:10.179 --> 00:36:13.630
the Stabian Baths and the Forum
Baths at Pompeii.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:15.389
So they could have chosen the
other,

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:19.456
but obviously felt that this
was much more appropriate to

00:36:19.456 --> 00:36:22.653
this commercial town,
to use the smaller,

00:36:22.653 --> 00:36:27.246
more intimate bath type here
than the imperial baths that had

00:36:27.246 --> 00:36:30.996
been developed in Rome from the
first century A.D.

00:36:30.996 --> 00:36:31.610
on.
 

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.465
Just a glimpse of the
black-and-white mosaic that

00:36:34.465 --> 00:36:37.380
gives this bath its name,
the Baths of Neptune;

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.809
you see Neptune here.
 

00:36:38.809 --> 00:36:42.190
But you can also see the way in
which every room in the bath--

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.800
which was made out of concrete,
faced with brick,

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.429
as you can also tell from this
view--

00:36:47.429 --> 00:36:51.420
every room was covered with
these black-and-white mosaics.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.369
Ostia is the land of the
black-and-white mosaic.

00:36:55.369 --> 00:36:57.440
I'll return to that in a moment.
 

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.076
Perhaps most importantly,
of anything that I show you

00:37:01.076 --> 00:37:05.481
today, are the apartment houses
of Ostia, and it's to those that

00:37:05.481 --> 00:37:07.230
I'd like now to turn.
 

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.351
What you're looking at on the
screen is a model of what one of

00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:12.809
these apartment houses would
have looked like.

00:37:12.809 --> 00:37:16.581
This one is the so-called
Insula, i-n-s-u-l-a,

00:37:16.581 --> 00:37:19.599
of Serapis, the Insula of
Serapis.

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:23.293
And we're looking at it in a
model that is in that museum of

00:37:23.293 --> 00:37:27.239
casts that I've referred to a
number of times this semester,

00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:29.579
at a place, in a part of Rome
called EUR,

00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:36.168
E-U-R, that area that was built
up in the Fascist period by

00:37:36.168 --> 00:37:39.010
Mussolini in the 1930s.
 

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.251
This model is in that museum,
and it gives us as good an idea

00:37:42.251 --> 00:37:45.385
as anything I could show you of
what one of these apartment

00:37:45.385 --> 00:37:47.440
houses looked like in its
heyday,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.469
in the time of Hadrian.
 

00:37:49.469 --> 00:37:52.014
The word insula,
I should mention,

00:37:52.014 --> 00:37:53.860
it can be used in two ways.
 

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.112
An insula either refers
to a multi-storied apartment

00:37:59.112 --> 00:38:04.909
house, or it refers to a block
of houses in a city like Ostia.

00:38:04.909 --> 00:38:09.297
It's used, for whatever reason,
it was used interchangeably to

00:38:09.297 --> 00:38:13.039
refer to either a block or to an
individual house.

00:38:13.039 --> 00:38:17.516
So pay attention to that when
you read about an insula

00:38:17.516 --> 00:38:19.010
or insulae.
 

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:22.210
Again, this one dates to the
second century A.D.,

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:23.809
the Insula of Serapis.
 

00:38:23.809 --> 00:38:29.050
And it basically was like a
modern condominium,

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:32.289
and often more than one of
these insulae were next,

00:38:32.289 --> 00:38:35.536
were clearly next to one
another, but more than one

00:38:35.536 --> 00:38:37.679
sometimes shared a common bath.
 

00:38:37.679 --> 00:38:42.532
So they would sometimes build a
bath building that would be used

00:38:42.532 --> 00:38:46.460
by those who lived in those two
apartment houses.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:50.010
Now what's characteristic of
this,

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.784
especially as we think about it
in relationship to early

00:38:51.784 --> 00:38:54.061
domus architecture,
that we saw at Pompeii,

00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:58.219
those single-family dwellings,
is the need in this teeming

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:03.648
commercial city to accommodate a
very large population in a small

00:39:03.648 --> 00:39:07.385
amount of space --
people on the whole who could

00:39:07.385 --> 00:39:09.880
not afford single-family
dwellings,

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.239
who needed to be housed in
these apartment buildings.

00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:15.949
They build up vertically,
and, as you can see,

00:39:15.949 --> 00:39:18.309
they go up to as many as five
stories,

00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:21.494
and we see that the Insula of
Serapis was indeed a

00:39:21.494 --> 00:39:23.119
five-storied structure.
 

00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:24.630
It is made out of concrete.
 

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.070
It is faced with brick.
 

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.653
And what is particularly
interesting about the brick

00:39:29.653 --> 00:39:32.702
facing here--
and this is going to be our

00:39:32.702 --> 00:39:36.608
first example of this,
at Ostia--is the fact at some

00:39:36.608 --> 00:39:39.940
point the Romans realized that
brick was really attractive in

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.251
its own right,
and it didn't need to be

00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:43.510
stuccoed over anymore.
 

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:45.730
If you think back to the Domus
Aurea,

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.710
even in the Domus Aurea,
the building was made out of--

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.469
the palace was made out of
concrete faced with brick,

00:39:52.469 --> 00:39:55.018
but the faÃ§ade was
gilded,

00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:59.322
and inside, you'll remember,
Fabullus was commissioned to

00:39:59.322 --> 00:40:03.780
cover the entire interior of the
structure with stucco,

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.250
and then paint it.
 

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:09.184
So you would have had no sense,
when you were standing in the

00:40:09.184 --> 00:40:11.085
Palace of Nero,
in Nero's day,

00:40:11.085 --> 00:40:14.300
that it was a brick-faced
concrete structure.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.342
But somewhere along the way,
and it comes to the fore in the

00:40:17.342 --> 00:40:19.307
second century A.D.,
they realized:

00:40:19.307 --> 00:40:22.253
"Hey, this brick is
actually pretty attractive in

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.199
its own right.
 

00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:24.530
It has texture.
 

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.900
We can vary the color;
we can use a reddish brick,

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.550
we can use a slightly yellowish
brick.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:32.539
We can add some stucco,
to make some decorative

00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:33.190
effects.
 

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.670
This looks awesome."
 

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:42.960
And we think some innovative
architects got the idea,

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.079
innovative designers,
to "let's leave it,

00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:47.536
let's not stucco it over,
let's let it speak for

00:40:47.536 --> 00:40:48.320
itself."
 

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.137
And that was a very wise
decision, because as you'll see

00:40:51.137 --> 00:40:53.096
today,
the buildings that we have

00:40:53.096 --> 00:40:56.512
remaining from Ostia,
that were unadulterated brick

00:40:56.512 --> 00:40:58.927
exteriors,
without stucco,

00:40:58.927 --> 00:41:03.054
are absolutely magnificent,
and they became,

00:41:03.054 --> 00:41:06.889
the designers became real
experts at rendering it in an

00:41:06.889 --> 00:41:08.380
extraordinary way.
 

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.880
I think you can get a sense of
that even in this model.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.010
So exposed brickwork here.
 

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:19.880
You see these arches are made
of bricks that are kind of wedge

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:25.070
shaped and look like the sort of
thing we saw earlier in stone.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.389
Those wedge-shaped sections of
stone that we saw,

00:41:27.389 --> 00:41:29.177
for example,
in the Falerii Novi Gate,

00:41:29.177 --> 00:41:30.869
we see that sort of thing here.
 

00:41:30.869 --> 00:41:32.989
It may have been used,
just as it was in the Pantheon.

00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:36.909
You'll remember how they used
them during the building process

00:41:36.909 --> 00:41:40.380
to keep the concrete from
settling before it dried,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.619
but they realized afterwards
that these could be positioned

00:41:43.619 --> 00:41:46.802
in a way that made them very
attractive in their own right

00:41:46.802 --> 00:41:47.639
ultimately.
 

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:50.610
We can also see that they have
added moldings,

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:54.532
usually with stucco,
added moldings that make the

00:41:54.532 --> 00:41:58.170
building more attractive,
sometimes even little

00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:02.159
pediments, as you can see over
some of the windows over here.

00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:05.592
So they come up with strategies
to make this brick look even

00:42:05.592 --> 00:42:07.980
more attractive than it was on
its own.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.510
Note also the shops in the
first story.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.612
Some of these are shops,
some of these are actually

00:42:13.612 --> 00:42:16.840
staircases that lead you to the
uppermost stories.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.052
And once again,
it's clear that the Romans have

00:42:20.052 --> 00:42:23.822
become so adept at using
concrete that they are able to

00:42:23.822 --> 00:42:25.500
open up these walls.
 

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.369
The openings are larger than
they had been even before,

00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:35.637
and so they become very good at
dematerializing the wall in a

00:42:35.637 --> 00:42:41.489
way that becomes increasingly
sophisticated over time.

00:42:41.489 --> 00:42:45.492
The most famous house at Ostia
is in a sense mine,

00:42:45.492 --> 00:42:50.148
because it's called the Casa di
Diana, the House of Diana,

00:42:50.148 --> 00:42:51.210
at Ostia.
 

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:55.739
And we see a view of it here,
as it looks today.

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:58.193
It was a multi-storied
apartment building,

00:42:58.193 --> 00:43:00.110
a multi-storied insula.
 

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.179
Only two of those stories are
preserved now.

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:05.978
I'll show you a restored view
of what the original looked like

00:43:05.978 --> 00:43:06.849
momentarily.
 

00:43:06.849 --> 00:43:09.528
But we see it here,
as it looks today:

00:43:09.528 --> 00:43:12.425
concrete faced with brick,
exposed brick,

00:43:12.425 --> 00:43:14.960
brick enjoyed in its own right.
 

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:20.327
Very large openings that lead
into--they're either

00:43:20.327 --> 00:43:26.242
entranceways into the structure,
or lead to staircases,

00:43:26.242 --> 00:43:29.090
or open up onto shops.
 

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.262
We can see here in actuality
the same sort of thing we saw in

00:43:31.262 --> 00:43:33.623
the model from EUR,
and that is the use not only of

00:43:33.623 --> 00:43:36.726
exposed brick,
but also of moldings that are

00:43:36.726 --> 00:43:39.036
added,
either in brick sometimes,

00:43:39.036 --> 00:43:42.914
or also sometimes in stucco,
of the nice overhangs that they

00:43:42.914 --> 00:43:45.800
have created above the
second-story windows,

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.010
up there.
 

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.429
We also see a lot of Italian
school children in Ostia,

00:43:50.429 --> 00:43:52.942
and Pompeii also,
but particularly Ostia because

00:43:52.942 --> 00:43:55.952
of its proximity to Rome,
and all the schools that they

00:43:55.952 --> 00:43:59.052
have in the city of Rome;
lots of kids always out in

00:43:59.052 --> 00:44:03.409
groups, and they always seem to
have T-shirts of the same color.

00:44:03.409 --> 00:44:05.786
So you'll see one red school
and one yellow school and one

00:44:05.786 --> 00:44:07.530
blue school;
it's a lot of fun.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.880
And every one of them has
their--it's so funny to me,

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.349
they have their cell phones and
they're all clicking,

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:13.512
clicking, clicking,
as they walk through these

00:44:13.512 --> 00:44:14.090
buildings.
 

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.646
I'm not sure they're looking at
anything, but they're definitely

00:44:16.646 --> 00:44:18.880
clicking, to record the fact
that they were at Ostia;

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.389
perhaps that's for student
papers, I don't know.

00:44:21.389 --> 00:44:25.990
But here a detail of the Insula
of Diana, looking through one of

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.789
these entranceways into the rest
of the structure.

00:44:29.789 --> 00:44:33.010
And I'll bet you're as struck
as I am in looking at this,

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:36.114
that with regard to vista,
the interesting panorama and

00:44:36.114 --> 00:44:36.690
vista.
 

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.233
It doesn't matter whether
you're building out of rubble or

00:44:40.233 --> 00:44:44.090
stone or opus incertum or
concrete faced with brick,

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.800
there is that aesthetic,
that Roman aesthetic,

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.639
of building things in such a
way that wherever you're

00:44:49.639 --> 00:44:52.751
standing in that structure
you're going to be looking from

00:44:52.751 --> 00:44:54.989
one part of the building to
another,

00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:59.989
and you're going to be struck
by the wonderful scenes that you

00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:04.170
see within that building and
from that building,

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.730
outside of that structure.
 

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.811
Here's the restored view of the
Insula of Diana,

00:45:10.811 --> 00:45:14.351
where you can see that
originally it was a four-storied

00:45:14.351 --> 00:45:15.268
structure.
 

00:45:15.268 --> 00:45:17.375
It's a cutaway and an
axonometric view:

00:45:17.375 --> 00:45:18.760
four-storied structure.
 

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.028
And this particular restored
view is also extremely helpful

00:45:23.028 --> 00:45:26.929
because it shows us that these
houses did not have the

00:45:26.929 --> 00:45:30.023
peristyle courts,
or the hortus that we

00:45:30.023 --> 00:45:33.077
know from the domus
italica or the Hellenized

00:45:33.077 --> 00:45:33.920
domus.
 

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.980
There was no space for that in
this commercial city.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.318
There is no emphasis on the
greenery and the wonderful

00:45:41.318 --> 00:45:45.250
fountains and statuary that we
saw in Pompeii.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.500
And keep in mind,
of course, that Pompeii,

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.969
in Campania,
was essentially a resort town;

00:45:49.969 --> 00:45:53.032
a very different kind of feel
than Ostia, this teeming

00:45:53.032 --> 00:45:54.190
commercial center.
 

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.275
So what they replaced those
with here, in order to get more

00:45:57.275 --> 00:46:00.150
light into the structure,
is a kind of a light well;

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:04.615
and you see that light well up
here, where there are also

00:46:04.615 --> 00:46:07.010
windows on multiple stories.
 

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.898
And, in fact,
I would imagine that those were

00:46:08.898 --> 00:46:12.125
the choicest apartments to have,
because they would have been

00:46:12.125 --> 00:46:15.697
less noisy than what you can
imagine an apartment along the

00:46:15.697 --> 00:46:19.034
street must have been,
with all the activity going in

00:46:19.034 --> 00:46:22.329
and out of the thermopolia
and the other shops down

00:46:22.329 --> 00:46:25.170
below;
the cart traffic and so on.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.746
So again I imagine the light
well apartment would have been

00:46:28.746 --> 00:46:29.920
highly desirable.
 

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.380
Speaking of thermopolia,
we have them at Ostia,

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:36.840
as we have them at Pompeii,
quite a number of them.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.481
And I show you the best
preserved, which happens to be

00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:42.896
in Diana's House,
and I show it to you here,

00:46:42.896 --> 00:46:48.010
the Thermopolium of the
Casa di Diana at Ostia.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.494
You can see that right at the
entranceway they have put a

00:46:51.494 --> 00:46:53.050
black-and-white mosaic.
 

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:57.398
You see inside just what we saw
at--just exactly the same thing

00:46:57.398 --> 00:47:00.835
that we saw at Pompeii,
one of these counters that

00:47:00.835 --> 00:47:03.219
would have had recesses in it.
 

00:47:03.219 --> 00:47:08.010
So you have to imagine,
just the same as we saw there,

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.331
a kind of fast food emporium,
where you would take a peek at

00:47:10.331 --> 00:47:12.650
what looked good for the day,
make your choice.

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:16.010
If you go inside the
thermopolium of Diana,

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:19.300
you see hanging on the wall a
painting,

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.882
which it seems likely may have
served as a kind of shop sign

00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:25.797
that might have been hung
outside the building to

00:47:25.797 --> 00:47:28.590
advertise what you could get in
this particular

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.170
thermopolium.
 

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.059
And if we look at what's
depicted here,

00:47:32.059 --> 00:47:35.438
it's a still life of objects,
and we see what seems to be a

00:47:35.438 --> 00:47:38.500
pomegranate on the right,
hanging on a nail, on the wall.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.744
In the center--I don't know if
you can see it from where you

00:47:41.744 --> 00:47:43.867
sit,
but in the center a block that

00:47:43.867 --> 00:47:46.996
supports what looks like a
drinking cup that has little

00:47:46.996 --> 00:47:50.349
round things floating in it,
lentils or chickpeas or

00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:51.719
something like that.
 

00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:55.074
And then at the far left
there's a plate that also is on

00:47:55.074 --> 00:47:58.003
a block, a plate that has a
carrot and some other

00:47:58.003 --> 00:47:58.920
vegetables.
 

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.791
So this may have been a
vegetarian, I guess this was a

00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:07.010
vegetarian restaurant in
Pompeii;

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:10.849
one of the healthier places one
could go, if one wanted a

00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:12.840
snack--in Ostia,
excuse me.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.891
If you go to Ostia,
by the way, you really do want

00:48:16.891 --> 00:48:21.005
to set aside a day to do that,
because by the time you take

00:48:21.005 --> 00:48:25.268
the half an hour ride out there,
get there--there's a lot to see.

00:48:25.268 --> 00:48:27.811
And it used to be,
if you'd go there for a day,

00:48:27.811 --> 00:48:30.132
which I've done many,
many times, there was

00:48:30.132 --> 00:48:31.789
absolutely nowhere to eat.
 

00:48:31.789 --> 00:48:33.210
So you had to remember to bring
your--

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.030
and nowhere to get a bottle of
water,

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.010
so you'd have to remember to
bring your bottle of water,

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.949
and maybe a snack.
 

00:48:37.949 --> 00:48:40.949
But they have rectified that in
recent years;

00:48:40.949 --> 00:48:44.932
the last few years they've
finally put up the Caffetteria

00:48:44.932 --> 00:48:48.219
degli Scavi,
which loosely translated is the

00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:51.800
Excavation CafÃ©,
the Cafeteria of the

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.768
Excavations at Ostia.
 

00:48:53.768 --> 00:48:55.300
And it's actually a wonderful
place.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.190
I have to say it's very modern.
 

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.907
It has a wonderful deck with
tables and the ubiquitous

00:49:00.907 --> 00:49:04.974
Italian white umbrella where
one--and the food is actually,

00:49:04.974 --> 00:49:07.150
for a cafeteria,
ain't bad;

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.039
Italian pasta is always hard to
make bad, it's always good.

00:49:10.039 --> 00:49:12.032
And then inside,
I thought you'd be amused to

00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:13.369
see,
when they decided on the

00:49:13.369 --> 00:49:15.449
dÃ©cor for the interior of
the cafeteria,

00:49:15.449 --> 00:49:20.347
with its simple tables and
chairs, they put brick on the

00:49:20.347 --> 00:49:23.206
wall,
and they then hung up these

00:49:23.206 --> 00:49:27.342
wonderful versions of the
Piazzale delle Corporazioni

00:49:27.342 --> 00:49:29.489
black-and-white mosaics.
 

00:49:29.489 --> 00:49:31.949
So again, very--Italians are
really,

00:49:31.949 --> 00:49:35.972
they do build Ferraris after
all, they are very good at

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:38.813
design and aesthetic,
and pay a great deal of

00:49:38.813 --> 00:49:41.434
attention to that,
and consequently always make

00:49:41.434 --> 00:49:43.199
one's surroundings pleasant.
 

00:49:43.199 --> 00:49:44.369
Warehouses.
 

00:49:44.369 --> 00:49:46.489
This was a commercial port.
 

00:49:46.489 --> 00:49:51.840
We talked about the fact that
in commercial ports one needs

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.039
warehouses.
 

00:49:53.039 --> 00:49:55.768
We began the semester with a
warehouse, in fact,

00:49:55.768 --> 00:49:59.309
the Porticus Aemilia in Rome,
along the banks of the Tiber.

00:49:59.309 --> 00:50:01.369
And I remind you of that here.
 

00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:03.159
Here's the Tiber,
a model of the Tiber,

00:50:03.159 --> 00:50:04.480
with the Porticus Aemilia.
 

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.010
You'll remember that was made
out of concrete.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.838
It was one of the earliest
examples of concrete

00:50:09.838 --> 00:50:12.306
construction in the Republic in
Rome: a series of barrel vaults

00:50:12.306 --> 00:50:14.672
linked to one another,
on three tiers,

00:50:14.672 --> 00:50:18.722
as you'll recall,
with axial and lateral spatial

00:50:18.722 --> 00:50:21.739
relations inside that structure.
 

00:50:21.739 --> 00:50:25.469
Ostia needed its own warehouses
as well.

00:50:25.469 --> 00:50:29.166
It had them in the Republic
already, but it began to add to

00:50:29.166 --> 00:50:31.268
them in the second century A.D.
 

00:50:31.268 --> 00:50:34.358
And it's fascinating to see
what happens when you build a

00:50:34.358 --> 00:50:36.840
warehouse out of concrete faced
with brick.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.594
You get an extraordinary
structure that looks very much

00:50:39.594 --> 00:50:40.820
like an insula.
 

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.699
If I had put this up and said:
"What is this?"

00:50:42.699 --> 00:50:43.804
And you said:
"It's an

00:50:43.804 --> 00:50:45.798
insula,"
you would sort of be on the

00:50:45.798 --> 00:50:48.219
mark, because it looks exactly
like an insula;

00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:50.300
but it is a warehouse.
 

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.559
And this is the most famous
warehouse in Ostia,

00:50:53.559 --> 00:50:55.639
the so-called Horrea--because
the word horrea,

00:50:55.639 --> 00:50:58.780
h-o-r-r-e-a,
is warehouse in Latin--

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.514
the Horrea Epagathiana,
which you have on your Monument

00:51:01.514 --> 00:51:05.969
List,
which dates to 145 to 150 A.D.

00:51:05.969 --> 00:51:08.630
This is the entrance to the
Horrea Epagathiana.

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:14.000
It is again made out of
concrete, faced with brick;

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.501
exposed brickwork,
brickwork enjoyed in its own

00:51:16.501 --> 00:51:18.460
right, for its own aesthetic
here.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:24.007
We can see that it is like the
apartment houses in that it is

00:51:24.007 --> 00:51:27.461
multi-storied,
with the large entranceways,

00:51:27.461 --> 00:51:29.949
or entranceways into the
structure,

00:51:29.949 --> 00:51:33.500
down below, and then the
smaller windows up above.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:37.250
They have monumentalized the
entrance, the main entrance,

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:40.465
to the structure,
by giving it columns supporting

00:51:40.465 --> 00:51:41.469
a pediment.
 

00:51:41.469 --> 00:51:44.530
Very grand, in fact,
and we haven't--

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:47.748
it's interesting to see that
even with this brick-faced

00:51:47.748 --> 00:51:52.016
concrete architecture,
the Romans have not lost their

00:51:52.016 --> 00:51:57.940
interest in Hellenizing works of
art and using touches of ancient

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.940
Greece to monumentalize and to
make more cultured,

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:06.320
in a sense, the entranceway
into this structure.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.940
So we see these columns,
engaged columns,

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.476
supporting a pediment above,
capitals on those columns,

00:52:12.476 --> 00:52:14.050
as you can see here.
 

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:19.010
All of this done in concrete
faced with brick.

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.563
And you can see here,
this is an outstanding example

00:52:21.563 --> 00:52:24.670
of the way in which they have
used brick to their advantage.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:26.829
They have recognized that you
can vary the color;

00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:30.139
you can have a reddish brick;
you can have a yellowish brick.

00:52:30.139 --> 00:52:34.402
So here they've used red brick
to face the column shaft,

00:52:34.402 --> 00:52:37.659
and then a yellow brick for the
capital.

00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:40.458
So there's a distinction
between the shaft and the

00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:41.030
capital.
 

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.659
And they have even used the
most expensive material,

00:52:44.659 --> 00:52:47.230
marble, for the inscription
plaque,

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:50.222
where they identify this
building at the Horrea

00:52:50.222 --> 00:52:53.670
Epagathiana,
and then the pediment above.

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:55.938
And you can see,
if you look at the pediment

00:52:55.938 --> 00:52:59.159
decoration and if you look at
the volutes of the capitals,

00:52:59.159 --> 00:53:04.063
you will see they have used a
small amount of stucco to enable

00:53:04.063 --> 00:53:07.679
them to create the spirals of
the volutes,

00:53:07.679 --> 00:53:11.293
for example,
and some of the more delicate

00:53:11.293 --> 00:53:14.820
decorative work in the pediment
above.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.190
Another subtlety,
another nice subtlety;

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:20.849
it just shows you the amount of
effort and time and money that

00:53:20.849 --> 00:53:22.530
went into this commission.
 

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:26.094
Also this very nice pilaster
that is placed right next to the

00:53:26.094 --> 00:53:29.065
column,
which makes a wonderful

00:53:29.065 --> 00:53:33.262
transition from the column,
the roundness of the column,

00:53:33.262 --> 00:53:34.809
to the squareness of the
pilaster,

00:53:34.809 --> 00:53:36.750
to the shape of the doorway.
 

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:40.235
The aesthetics very much on the
mind of this particular

00:53:40.235 --> 00:53:43.681
designer, as well as the vistas;
again, this idea of looking

00:53:43.681 --> 00:53:46.224
through one space,
seeing another opening and

00:53:46.224 --> 00:53:48.710
wondering where that opening is
going--

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:51.807
all of that very,
very carefully designed by the

00:53:51.807 --> 00:53:52.599
architect.
 

00:53:52.599 --> 00:53:55.539
Here's another view head on of
this elaborate doorway,

00:53:55.539 --> 00:53:58.139
leading into the Horrea
Epagathiana,

00:53:58.139 --> 00:54:02.563
announcing with the inscription
exactly where you are and what

00:54:02.563 --> 00:54:05.610
this building was used for in
antiquity.

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:08.630
A detail of the pediment,
where we can see the

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:09.570
inscription.
 

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:14.291
We can also see the capitals,
the use of stucco work here,

00:54:14.291 --> 00:54:19.094
and the very elaborate work
that they have done to decorate

00:54:19.094 --> 00:54:21.000
the pediment above.
 

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.695
Just a few more details of the
columns, where you can see even

00:54:23.695 --> 00:54:25.905
better this capital,
and the way in which they have

00:54:25.905 --> 00:54:26.570
used brick.
 

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:30.469
They have used brick even for
the acanthus leaves.

00:54:30.469 --> 00:54:32.820
You can see that there are
acanthus leaves here.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.110
This is actually an example,
one of the few we've seen,

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:37.934
of the composite capital,
with the acanthus leaves of the

00:54:37.934 --> 00:54:40.690
Corinthian,
and the volutes of the Ionic.

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:42.780
We saw it on the Arch of Titus
in Rome.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:46.077
But here we see that they've
used brick, and then only at the

00:54:46.077 --> 00:54:48.385
uppermost part,
where the leaf has to curve

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:50.199
over, do they add the stucco.
 

00:54:50.199 --> 00:54:54.664
And this is just a warehouse,
and yet a tremendous amount of

00:54:54.664 --> 00:54:59.056
effort has gone into making it
an extraordinarily beautiful

00:54:59.056 --> 00:55:00.039
building.
 

00:55:00.039 --> 00:55:02.750
And it shows again that they
are absolutely going over the

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:05.413
top, in terms of their being
enamored of what they can do

00:55:05.413 --> 00:55:08.422
with brick facing;
that they are now able to

00:55:08.422 --> 00:55:09.050
expose.
 

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:11.742
Once they can expose it,
they're much more willing to

00:55:11.742 --> 00:55:14.590
put the effort into it,
to make it really attractive.

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:16.561
And if you go into the
courtyard of the Horrea

00:55:16.561 --> 00:55:18.416
Epagathiana--
and by the way,

00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:21.130
behind, within these areas
here,

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:25.577
we have annular vaulting--you
can see these niches that have

00:55:25.577 --> 00:55:27.010
been placed here.
 

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.760
They don't really need these
niches in this courtyard of this

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.110
warehouse.
 

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:33.010
What did they use these niches
for?

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:37.246
Well perhaps they put little
statuettes of gods that those

00:55:37.246 --> 00:55:41.559
who worked here favored and
protected their daily toil here

00:55:41.559 --> 00:55:43.789
in the Horrea Epagathiana.
 

00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:47.650
But look at the attention that
they've paid to these niches,

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:50.579
that have no other purpose than
to be attractive,

00:55:50.579 --> 00:55:53.030
and possibly again to hold
these statuettes.

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:57.559
But you can see here again,
with this combination of stucco

00:55:57.559 --> 00:56:02.010
work for the pilasters and the
capitals, and brickwork;

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:05.038
brickwork creating these
interestingly shaped lozenges

00:56:05.038 --> 00:56:07.692
and triangles,
to create--shows an interest

00:56:07.692 --> 00:56:11.358
again in geometric form and the
contrast of one geometric form

00:56:11.358 --> 00:56:13.231
to another,
just as we saw in

00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:18.367
black-and-white mosaic,
capitalized on by these

00:56:18.367 --> 00:56:20.139
designers.
 

00:56:20.139 --> 00:56:25.340
Now I don't want to leave you
with the impression that because

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:29.860
brick is now exposed and enjoyed
in its own right,

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:33.079
that there are no walls that
were stuccoed and painted in

00:56:33.079 --> 00:56:33.539
Ostia.
 

00:56:33.539 --> 00:56:37.739
That would be a misconception,
because there are still painted

00:56:37.739 --> 00:56:38.909
walls in Ostia.
 

00:56:38.909 --> 00:56:42.425
On the insides of some of these
buildings they still opted to

00:56:42.425 --> 00:56:44.710
stucco over the wall and to
paint it.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.818
And I want to show you just one
glorious example:

00:56:47.818 --> 00:56:50.150
the Insula of the Painted
Vaults,

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:54.349
which dates to 150 to 200,
is one that has one of our best

00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:58.329
preserved ceilings,
walls and ceilings anywhere in

00:56:58.329 --> 00:57:01.166
a Roman house--
you can see how well preserved

00:57:01.166 --> 00:57:03.594
it is here--
and it is what we call the

00:57:03.594 --> 00:57:07.208
spoked-wheel effect,
because the ceiling decoration

00:57:07.208 --> 00:57:09.420
does look like a spoked wheel.
 

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:13.201
We can also see this division;
in fact as you look at it,

00:57:13.201 --> 00:57:16.400
I think you'll be as struck as
I am by the fact that as we look

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.150
at this spoked wheel,
we really get the sense that

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:21.710
we're looking at one of
Hadrian's pumpkin domes in

00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:22.179
paint.
 

00:57:22.179 --> 00:57:26.480
Because you can see the
segmented dome effect here,

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.998
and also, in a sense,
the octagonal effect that one

00:57:29.998 --> 00:57:34.472
also gets from this structure,
as well as the effect of the

00:57:34.472 --> 00:57:38.329
ribs of a groin vault,
as you can see well here.

00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:41.682
But it's a painted version of a
pumpkin dome,

00:57:41.682 --> 00:57:46.103
and it's not surprising to see
that Hadrian's pumpkin domes

00:57:46.103 --> 00:57:48.010
took off in this way.
 

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:52.186
I also just want to mention to
you that while there's a fair

00:57:52.186 --> 00:57:55.371
amount of what we call
post-Pompeian painting,

00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:57.141
Roman painting after A.D.
 

00:57:57.141 --> 00:58:01.248
79, almost all of it is an
exploitation of the Fourth Style

00:58:01.248 --> 00:58:05.000
of Roman painting,
as we know it from Pompeii.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.085
There's actually not as much
invention as one would expect,

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:11.199
after 79, in Roman painting.
 

00:58:11.199 --> 00:58:16.079
I want to show you very briefly
the Insula of the Muses;

00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:20.313
the Insula of the Muses in
Ostia, which dates to around

00:58:20.313 --> 00:58:20.628
A.D.
 

00:58:20.628 --> 00:58:25.568
130, because this is one of the
few single family dwellings that

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:28.940
we see in the second century in
Ostia.

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.134
You can see,
if you look at the plan,

00:58:31.134 --> 00:58:34.914
that it is arranged not around
an atrium but around a peristyle

00:58:34.914 --> 00:58:38.164
court, here;
although there aren't columns,

00:58:38.164 --> 00:58:42.110
there are these piers,
as you can see also in plan.

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:50.079
But just as we saw in the late
first-century A.D.

00:58:50.079 --> 00:58:53.835
houses in Herculaneum,
from between the earthquake and

00:58:53.835 --> 00:58:57.211
the eruption of Vesuvius,
the triclinium has

00:58:57.211 --> 00:58:59.719
become the most important room
in the house.

00:58:59.719 --> 00:59:01.110
You enter into it here.
 

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:03.483
You have a vestibule,
you have this court,

00:59:03.483 --> 00:59:06.264
and then you have,
on axis, the triclinium

00:59:06.264 --> 00:59:07.250
of the house.
 

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:11.927
But what makes this particular
house most distinctive is the

00:59:11.927 --> 00:59:16.210
fact that every single floor is
covered with mosaic.

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:20.121
So, as I said to you before,
the black-and-white mosaic

00:59:20.121 --> 00:59:23.018
reigned supreme in the city of
Ostia,

00:59:23.018 --> 00:59:26.440
and it's clear that everyone
who could afford it decorated

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.840
every room of their house with
mosaic.

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.458
And although this doesn't come
from this particular house,

00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:33.710
this comes from the House of
Apuleius in Ostia.

00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:35.320
It's not on your Monument List,
you don't have to remember it,

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:36.489
but I just wanted to show it to
you,

00:59:36.489 --> 00:59:40.018
because it's a marvelous
example of what can be done--

00:59:40.018 --> 00:59:41.760
I wish it were a little more in
focus--

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.070
but it's a marvelous example of
what could be done,

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:48.394
and was done,
using black-and-white mosaic in

00:59:48.394 --> 00:59:49.692
Ostia;
only black and white

00:59:49.692 --> 00:59:51.112
tesserae,
with a Medusa head in the

00:59:51.112 --> 00:59:51.460
center.
 

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:55.039
And then if you--this is one of
those examples,

00:59:55.039 --> 00:59:56.907
illusionistic examples,
that as you look at it and

00:59:56.907 --> 00:59:58.960
focus on it,
it's hard to tell exactly

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:04.010
what's in the foreground,
what's in the background.

01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:06.630
It's got that like an op art
effect that those of you who

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:10.061
know Op Art of the 1960s--
and I show you an example of

01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:14.612
it, a painting from the Blaze
series by the Op artist Bridget

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:16.280
Riley of the 1960s.
 

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.690
I've mentioned so many times in
the course of this semester that

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.938
there isn't anything that the
Romans didn't do before anybody

01:00:22.938 --> 01:00:24.239
else,
and this is,

01:00:24.239 --> 01:00:26.389
and Op Art is an example of
that.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:32.135
So we do see Op Art in Ostia,
and we see it obviously also

01:00:32.135 --> 01:00:36.469
much later in more contemporary
painting.

01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:40.043
Another bath structure in
Ostia, this one the Baths of the

01:00:40.043 --> 01:00:42.300
Seven Wise Men or the Seven
Sages;

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.800
dates to A.D. 130.
 

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.639
I show it to you only to show
you this one circular room,

01:00:47.639 --> 01:00:49.679
and not because it's a bath
building,

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:53.119
but rather because it has a
wonderful mosaic on the floor;

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:55.780
again, a circular structure,
with a circular mosaic,

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.710
once again done in black and
white.

01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:00.177
And if you look at this,
you can see that what we have

01:01:00.177 --> 01:01:02.257
represented here--
I'll show you a detail in a

01:01:02.257 --> 01:01:04.713
moment--
is a flowering acanthus plant

01:01:04.713 --> 01:01:09.289
that has intertwined within its
leaves hunters and the hunted,

01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:12.420
hunted animals and their
hunters, in combat,

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.070
as you can see here.
 

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:18.032
And here's a detail where you
can see once again done entirely

01:01:18.032 --> 01:01:20.760
in black-and-white mosaic:
the hunters,

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.710
the animals,
very carefully depicted,

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:29.030
interspersed among these
flowering acanthus plants;

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:30.869
very effectively done.
 

01:01:30.869 --> 01:01:34.306
This is another view of the
Baths of Neptune,

01:01:34.306 --> 01:01:38.679
in Ostia, which we looked at
before, dates to 139 A.D.

01:01:38.679 --> 01:01:41.726
And this is a good view because
it shows you not only the

01:01:41.726 --> 01:01:43.958
brick-faced concrete
construction of these

01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:46.380
structures,
but also the mosaics

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:51.114
themselves, and how every single
room of this bath was covered

01:01:51.114 --> 01:01:53.518
with black-and-white mosaic.
 

01:01:53.518 --> 01:01:55.190
The piÃ¨ce de
rÃ©sistance,

01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:58.550
the finest mosaic in the
complex, is this one,

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:01.230
and it's the one from which the
bath gets it name,

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:03.956
the Baths of Neptune,
because we see Neptune himself

01:02:03.956 --> 01:02:05.559
in the center of this scene.
 

01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:09.567
It's not surprising that the
god of the sea was chosen as an

01:02:09.567 --> 01:02:12.420
appropriate subject for a bath
building.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.704
We see him here with his
trident--that's how we know it's

01:02:16.704 --> 01:02:19.920
him--being carried along by four
horses.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.539
He's holding the reins of those
horses.

01:02:21.539 --> 01:02:23.989
His mantle is billowing up
behind him.

01:02:23.989 --> 01:02:26.179
One expects to see a chariot
here;

01:02:26.179 --> 01:02:28.085
one thinks of this as Neptune
in a chariot,

01:02:28.085 --> 01:02:29.719
but it's not Neptune in a
chariot.

01:02:29.719 --> 01:02:32.090
You can see that these horses,
by the way,

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:36.815
aren't fully horses but the
front part is a horse and the

01:02:36.815 --> 01:02:41.014
rest is a sea creature,
and you can see that the legs

01:02:41.014 --> 01:02:45.230
of Neptune are interwoven with
the tail of the sea creature;

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:51.869
he's in fact using the tails of
those sea creatures almost like

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:55.610
skates,
as he makes his way along

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:58.911
this--or water skis,
I guess is a better way of

01:02:58.911 --> 01:03:01.411
putting it;
water skis, as he makes his way

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:04.670
from right to left,
across the white background.

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:10.456
One of the interesting things
about this mosaic is you see the

01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:15.010
tension in the minds and work of
this artist,

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:18.306
on the one hand making these
very abstract black shapes

01:03:18.306 --> 01:03:21.773
against a white background,
but at the same time paying a

01:03:21.773 --> 01:03:24.309
lot of attention to the actual
musculature,

01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:29.079
to what the chest of the god
Poseidon would have looked like,

01:03:29.079 --> 01:03:31.887
as you look at it;
there's very pronounced

01:03:31.887 --> 01:03:35.360
musculature that's carefully
done here by the artist.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.489
Here are our friends the
dolphins frolicking,

01:03:37.489 --> 01:03:39.599
dolphins with cupids on their
back,

01:03:39.599 --> 01:03:43.380
some fairly--other floating
figures,

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.989
a female figure on the back of
another sea creature,

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.036
all of this going on,
on the floor of the Baths of

01:03:49.036 --> 01:03:49.659
Neptune.
 

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.909
But what's particularly
interesting,

01:03:51.909 --> 01:03:54.753
I think, is the same sort of
thing that we saw in the

01:03:54.753 --> 01:03:58.197
Piazzale delle Corporazioni,
and that is that the artist has

01:03:58.197 --> 01:04:01.751
designed this in such a way that
it doesn't matter which part of

01:04:01.751 --> 01:04:03.500
the room you're standing in.
 

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.681
Wherever you are standing,
you can look onto the floor,

01:04:06.681 --> 01:04:09.981
from where you are standing,
and see at least some of the

01:04:09.981 --> 01:04:12.333
figures head on;
whether you're standing here,

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:14.436
whether you're standing here,
whether you're standing up

01:04:14.436 --> 01:04:16.652
there or to the right,
you are always seeing some,

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:19.510
not all but some,
of the figures head on.

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:22.237
So again this is not--this is
done with great care,

01:04:22.237 --> 01:04:25.510
and orchestrated to fit the
space in which it was located.

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:29.485
Here a detail of the mosaic
that we just looked at,

01:04:29.485 --> 01:04:33.539
showing Neptune and his horses
and sea creatures.

01:04:33.539 --> 01:04:36.650
The most important development
that happens at Ostia,

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:40.940
with regard to residential
architecture,

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.599
later in its history,
is we do begin to see the

01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:45.679
re-emergence of the
domus,

01:04:45.679 --> 01:04:49.347
already in the second century
and then even more so in the

01:04:49.347 --> 01:04:51.469
third and fourth centuries A.D.
 

01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:55.840
And I want to show you quickly
two examples of that,

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.121
because they tell us a good
deal about late residential

01:04:59.121 --> 01:05:03.349
architecture in Ostia,
and also by association in Rome.

01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:07.668
This is the Domus of Fortuna
Annonaria, an axonometric view

01:05:07.668 --> 01:05:08.860
of that house.
 

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.150
It dates to the late second
century A.D.,

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:14.869
but was remodeled significantly
in the fourth century A.D.,

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:18.027
and I think we really need to
think of it as more a

01:05:18.027 --> 01:05:21.440
fourth-century house than as a
second-century house.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.646
And, by the way,
Ostia was still thriving in the

01:05:25.646 --> 01:05:27.079
third century.
 

01:05:27.079 --> 01:05:29.014
By the year 400 A.D.,
it was abandoned,

01:05:29.014 --> 01:05:31.967
but in the third century still
a thriving--and early fourth

01:05:31.967 --> 01:05:33.750
century--still a thriving city.
 

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.329
We see this house here.
 

01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:37.969
It's an axonometric view from
Ward-Perkins.

01:05:37.969 --> 01:05:40.976
The most important features,
besides the fact that it's a

01:05:40.976 --> 01:05:43.655
single-story dwelling,
single-family dwelling,

01:05:43.655 --> 01:05:46.269
is the fact that it has an open
court here,

01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:48.132
with a pool;
that it has the

01:05:48.132 --> 01:05:51.760
triclinium as the most
important room of the house;

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.518
so that continues on in
residential architecture.

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:58.300
But there's a particular taste
for apses in these late Roman

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.070
buildings.
 

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:02.300
You can see that this one has
an apse, not so unlike the apse

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.315
that we saw in Domitian's
Palatine Palace on the Palatine

01:06:05.315 --> 01:06:05.800
Hill.
 

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.889
It is finally starting to catch
on, among others.

01:06:08.889 --> 01:06:15.215
We see that you go into that
room through three arches,

01:06:15.215 --> 01:06:16.739
on columns.
 

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:21.289
And this idea of supporting a
triple arch on columns is also a

01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:26.139
very popular motif in domestic
architecture in later antiquity.

01:06:26.139 --> 01:06:28.849
And look also at the fact that
on the left-hand side of the

01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:30.719
triclinium there is a
fountain.

01:06:30.719 --> 01:06:32.380
So the incorporation of a
fountain;

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:36.489
a pool court here,
a fountain there,

01:06:36.489 --> 01:06:41.936
an apsed triclinium,
and then views through triple

01:06:41.936 --> 01:06:44.083
arches,
supported by columns,

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.824
all characteristic features of
late Roman domestic

01:06:46.824 --> 01:06:47.719
architecture.
 

01:06:47.719 --> 01:06:50.630
This is a view obviously,
through the columns,

01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:55.155
supporting that triple arch,
toward the fountain on the left

01:06:55.155 --> 01:06:59.219
and toward the apse in the
center of the structure.

01:06:59.219 --> 01:07:02.237
And you can see the remains of
marble revetment,

01:07:02.237 --> 01:07:05.255
real marble revetment,
that was used both on the

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:08.530
floor, for the pavement,
and also on the walls.

01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:11.954
The other house I want to show
you briefly is the Domus of

01:07:11.954 --> 01:07:14.780
Cupid and Psyche,
the more famous of the two.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:18.023
This dates, without any
question, to late antiquity,

01:07:18.023 --> 01:07:18.914
to around A.D.
 

01:07:18.914 --> 01:07:19.360
300.
 

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:23.108
The House of Cupid and Psyche,
we see it first in plan,

01:07:23.108 --> 01:07:25.539
and you can see it's very
simple.

01:07:25.539 --> 01:07:28.166
An entranceway here,
a long corridor,

01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:32.469
a series of cubicula on
one side of that corridor.

01:07:32.469 --> 01:07:35.637
There may have been a second
story on a small part of the

01:07:35.637 --> 01:07:36.090
house.
 

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:37.539
You can see the stairway there.
 

01:07:37.539 --> 01:07:41.800
As you walk along the corridor,
you eventually end up in the

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.039
very large triclinium.
 

01:07:44.039 --> 01:07:46.960
So again, from the time of the
House of the Mosaic Atrium in

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.387
Herculaneum to here,
the triclinium gaining

01:07:49.387 --> 01:07:50.280
in importance.
 

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.887
As you walk along that
corridor, you look through a

01:07:52.887 --> 01:07:54.764
series of columns,
supporting arches,

01:07:54.764 --> 01:07:57.005
as we'll see,
customary of buildings of this

01:07:57.005 --> 01:07:57.579
time.
 

01:07:57.579 --> 01:08:00.673
And then look at this wall,
which is scalloped for a

01:08:00.673 --> 01:08:04.375
fountain -- so another one of
these fountain courts that seems

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:06.619
to be popular during this
period.

01:08:06.619 --> 01:08:10.427
Here's a view into the room
with the lovers,

01:08:10.427 --> 01:08:15.742
the famous statue of Cupid and
Psyche, the little young Cupid

01:08:15.742 --> 01:08:19.020
and Psyche embracing one
another.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:23.359
That's from that statue that
the house gets its name.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:28.297
One of the best-preserved
marble revetted rooms in the

01:08:28.297 --> 01:08:33.050
history of Roman architecture is
this room here,

01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:37.311
probably the triclinium
in the House of Cupid and

01:08:37.311 --> 01:08:38.010
Psyche.
 

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:41.391
You can see that even marble
from the walls is preserved,

01:08:41.391 --> 01:08:44.956
as well as on the pavement and
on the steps and on the side,

01:08:44.956 --> 01:08:47.010
the base of the walls as well.
 

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:48.375
Brick-faced concrete
construction,

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.408
faced with real marble.
 

01:08:49.408 --> 01:08:52.850
What makes this particular
house especially appealing,

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:55.764
besides that wonderful statue,
is the fact that although

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:58.944
there's the usual touches of
maroon and green that we tend to

01:08:58.944 --> 01:09:01.170
see in many of these Roman
pavements,

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:04.426
most of the color is pastel,
and it makes it look

01:09:04.426 --> 01:09:08.100
particularly attractive,
and it goes particularly nicely

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.130
with the red and yellow of the
brick construction.

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:14.729
And I show you a detail here,
of that marble revetment,

01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:18.945
which gives you as good an idea
as anything I have shown you

01:09:18.945 --> 01:09:22.948
this semester of what the
original Hellenistic palaces of

01:09:22.948 --> 01:09:25.582
the kings,
the palaces of Nero and

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:28.908
Domitian would have looked like
in their heyday.

01:09:28.908 --> 01:09:31.398
And a detail of the statue of
Cupid and Psyche,

01:09:31.398 --> 01:09:33.670
and the room in which that
found itself;

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.390
it can still be seen there
today.

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:40.150
And the marble revetment once
again done in pastel colors of

01:09:40.150 --> 01:09:42.201
the floor,
and of the walls,

01:09:42.201 --> 01:09:44.859
giving us again an excellent
sense,

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:47.202
not only of fourth-century
domestic architecture

01:09:47.202 --> 01:09:49.590
dÃ©cor,
but also what so many of the

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:51.920
buildings that are no longer
preserved,

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.783
whose revetment is no longer as
well preserved as one would

01:09:54.783 --> 01:09:56.670
wish,
what they would have looked

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:57.720
like in antiquity.
 

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.649
A view through the corridor,
through the columns,

01:10:01.649 --> 01:10:04.390
in this case grey granite
columns, that probably would

01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:08.011
have supported an arcade,
but then without question the

01:10:08.011 --> 01:10:11.979
fountain on the side of the wall
that is scalloped,

01:10:11.979 --> 01:10:14.448
both down here and the wall
itself,

01:10:14.448 --> 01:10:17.698
and then the columns there do
support arches.

01:10:17.698 --> 01:10:21.153
So this whole concept of
columns supporting arches,

01:10:21.153 --> 01:10:24.328
very much a part of late Roman
house design.

01:10:24.328 --> 01:10:28.658
In the very few minutes that
remain, I just want to say a few

01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:33.060
words about--we've talked about
the life of this port city.

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:36.239
I want to talk about--since I
said the lecture was about life

01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:38.942
and death--
I want to just end with saying

01:10:38.942 --> 01:10:43.033
a few words about the tombs in
which the people who lived here

01:10:43.033 --> 01:10:44.038
were buried.
 

01:10:44.038 --> 01:10:47.323
People all up and down the
social pyramid lived in this

01:10:47.323 --> 01:10:48.538
commercial center.
 

01:10:48.538 --> 01:10:53.010
The simplest tombs--and by the
way,

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:56.037
I mentioned to you already that
there are tombs both outside the

01:10:56.037 --> 01:10:57.865
city of Pompeii ,
on the major roads,

01:10:57.865 --> 01:11:00.603
and then a little bit further
away at this place called Isola

01:11:00.603 --> 01:11:02.154
Sacra,
or the Sacred Island,

01:11:02.154 --> 01:11:05.335
where one can see particularly
well-preserved tombs from those

01:11:05.335 --> 01:11:07.630
who lived in Ostia of the second
century.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:12.115
The working poor were buried in
very simple tombs,

01:11:12.115 --> 01:11:13.488
of two types.
 

01:11:13.488 --> 01:11:17.479
The upper part of clay
amphoras, just the upper part;

01:11:17.479 --> 01:11:21.011
they were broken and then the
upper part was stuck into the

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:21.560
ground.
 

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.823
The remains of the person were
placed below the ground,

01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:28.086
and then the spout could be
used to pour wine libations

01:11:28.086 --> 01:11:28.630
into.
 

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:31.979
The other simple type was tiles
that were--

01:11:31.979 --> 01:11:34.768
the body was placed below,
and then tiles were arranged

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:37.623
around it,
looking almost like a kind of a

01:11:37.623 --> 01:11:41.333
house that helped to protect --
this idea of the houses of the

01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:43.078
living and the houses of the
dead,

01:11:43.078 --> 01:11:44.960
that were meant to protect the
body.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.658
But most of the tombs are of
what we call the house type.

01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:50.608
We looked at the house type on
the Via Appia,

01:11:50.608 --> 01:11:53.489
in the age of Augustus in Rome;
a tomb that resembles a house

01:11:53.489 --> 01:11:54.960
from the front,
with a doorway,

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.850
and a couple of windows,
and then an inscription plaque.

01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:00.921
And note the use of the
travertine jambs and lintel

01:12:00.921 --> 01:12:04.670
around it, just as we saw in the
Markets of Trajan in Rome.

01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:07.305
But if you look at these,
in this very good view from the

01:12:07.305 --> 01:12:10.179
side, you will see that almost
all of these are barrel-vaulted

01:12:10.179 --> 01:12:12.171
tombs;
which is characteristic of

01:12:12.171 --> 01:12:14.220
second-century tomb
architecture,

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:18.009
at Ostia, at Isola Sacra,
these barrel-vaulted structures

01:12:18.009 --> 01:12:21.189
with facades that make them look
like houses.

01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:24.770
Here's a detail of one of them,
one of these house tombs,

01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:29.038
with again the travertine jambs
down below,

01:12:29.038 --> 01:12:32.010
with the touch of a pediment up
above--

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:34.667
they haven't lost their
interest in Hellenization to a

01:12:34.667 --> 01:12:37.510
certain extent;
windows here, slit windows here;

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:40.150
an inscription,
a long inscription plaque that

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:42.029
tells us who was buried there.
 

01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:44.864
And then very often in these
wonderful tombs for this

01:12:44.864 --> 01:12:47.542
commercial center,
these panels that are done in

01:12:47.542 --> 01:12:50.346
terracotta that tell us
something about the profession

01:12:50.346 --> 01:12:52.038
of those who are buried here.
 

01:12:52.038 --> 01:12:55.145
Here's probably a shipper was
buried here, someone who made

01:12:55.145 --> 01:12:57.609
his money in the import and
export business.

01:12:57.609 --> 01:13:01.091
And over here you can maybe
barely make out a representation

01:13:01.091 --> 01:13:03.064
of a mill,
just as those that we would

01:13:03.064 --> 01:13:05.421
have--saw in Pompeii,
or we saw on the Tomb of the

01:13:05.421 --> 01:13:08.976
baker Eurysaces;
a mill with a worker and a mule

01:13:08.976 --> 01:13:13.408
that is helping to rotate the
mill of the bakery;

01:13:13.408 --> 01:13:16.988
so perhaps a baker also from
this particular family.

01:13:16.988 --> 01:13:22.010
I've superimposed a couple of
other terracotta plaques,

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:24.917
making them a little larger
here, to show you that these two

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:27.778
belong to people who've made
their profession by sharpening

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:29.380
knives,
knife sharpeners,

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.460
and they not only sharpen
knives--

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.060
and you can see them both doing
this,

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.939
in this scene--but they also
sold them.

01:13:34.939 --> 01:13:38.059
And I love the way in the still
life, they're arrayed every

01:13:38.059 --> 01:13:40.587
possible knife that you can
sharpen here or buy,

01:13:40.587 --> 01:13:42.038
from these individuals.
 

01:13:42.038 --> 01:13:44.130
And what do you think the
professions were of these two?

01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:47.117
This one clearly a shop,
someone selling things in a

01:13:47.117 --> 01:13:50.631
shop -- looks like vegetables
once again, asparagus and maybe

01:13:50.631 --> 01:13:52.800
broccoli or some such over
there.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.640
But what about this one,
what was the profession of this

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:55.949
one?
 

01:13:55.949 --> 01:13:56.810
Student:  Midwife.
 

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:58.109
Prof: Midwife, midwife.
 

01:13:58.109 --> 01:13:59.854
And I love this,
because here we have this

01:13:59.854 --> 01:14:01.090
woman, about to give birth.
 

01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:04.439
She's got another woman holding
her and giving her support.

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:07.926
And here the midwife,
instead of looking at what

01:14:07.926 --> 01:14:09.863
she's doing--
she's reaching in,

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:11.877
but she's not,
but instead of looking at what

01:14:11.877 --> 01:14:13.800
she's supposed to be
concentrating on,

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.060
she's looking out at the
spectator,

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.395
just to make sure that we don't
forget her features for

01:14:19.395 --> 01:14:22.444
posterity,
on this tomb relief,

01:14:22.444 --> 01:14:25.140
from her tomb in Ostia.
 

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.393
We saw columbaria,
these underground columbaria,

01:14:28.393 --> 01:14:32.408
with these niches where they
placed the cremated remains of

01:14:32.408 --> 01:14:35.038
the deceased and had
inscriptions.

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:38.060
We see the same sort of thing
in the interiors of tombs at

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:41.189
Ostia, but they are above ground
rather than subterranean at

01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.720
Ostia.
 

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.652
And we also see--and basically
the last point I want to make

01:14:44.652 --> 01:14:47.014
today--
is we also see in the interiors

01:14:47.014 --> 01:14:50.395
of these tombs at Ostia,
not only those niches for the

01:14:50.395 --> 01:14:53.100
cremated remains,
but it's in the second century

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.890
A.D.,
the time of Hadrian on,

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.583
that inhumation,
burial becomes the norm,

01:14:57.583 --> 01:15:01.520
largely under the influence of
the spread of Christianity,

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.710
the idea that the soul needs to
ascend to heaven,

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.899
and so you have to maintain the
bodily remains.

01:15:07.899 --> 01:15:10.716
And so we begin to see in these
interiors what we call

01:15:10.716 --> 01:15:13.274
arcosolia,
a-r-c, arco,

01:15:13.274 --> 01:15:18.010
a-r-c-o-s-o-l-i-a,
arcosolia,

01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:19.939
which are these much larger
niches where bodies are placed,

01:15:19.939 --> 01:15:22.720
bodies are buried,
and then they are covered over

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:26.198
with a marble slab that might
have the inscription naming the

01:15:26.198 --> 01:15:29.279
deceased,
or a figural scene.

01:15:29.279 --> 01:15:32.220
And just in closing,
to show you one last tomb that

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.340
we're going to look at next
time,

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:37.000
the Tomb of the Caetennii in
the Vatican Cemetery in Rome,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.800
to show you that these
concrete, brick-faced tombs,

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.826
with windows,
and with very elaborate

01:15:43.826 --> 01:15:47.043
interiors,
also begin to be put up in

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:49.739
Rome, in the second century A.D.
 

01:15:49.739 --> 01:15:50.640
We'll look at those.
 

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.609
The title of next time's
lecture is "Bigger is

01:15:53.609 --> 01:15:56.131
Better";
we're really going to culminate

01:15:56.131 --> 01:15:59.029
our move toward larger,
more grandiose buildings then.

01:15:59.029 --> 01:16:02.779
And then on Thursday we will
finally move out to the

01:16:02.779 --> 01:16:06.751
provinces by studying Roman
architecture in Roman North

01:16:06.751 --> 01:16:07.560
Africa.
 

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.020
Thank you.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.333
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE:
OK, so we're going to finish 

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.500
up on nucleophilic substitution
elimination 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.467
reactions today with an example
of practical 

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:13.367
application of them. 

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:20.033
And then go on to the reverse
reaction of elimination, which 

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.200
is addition to alkenes, so a new
functional group. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.033
And we'll be talking about the
stability of them today, the 

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.567
stability alkenes. 

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:39.467
OK, so last time we got started
on the silver assisted 

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:43.700
substitution reaction of
neopentyl iodide. 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.300
And notice something interesting
in this, if we 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.167
look at those red crosses that
trace the carbon skeleton of 

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:54.000
the starting material and the
product, what do you notice 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.233
about the carbon skeleton? 

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.867
Does it look like a normal
substitution? 

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:05.033
Ellen, what do you say? 

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:06.000
STUDENT: No. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.467
PROFESSOR: Why? 

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:08.433
STUDENT: There's an extra
carbon. 

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:09.400
PROFESSOR: There's not an extra
carbon. 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.800
There's five carbons on the
left, and there are five 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.500
carbons on the right, but
they're not hooked together 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.033
the same way. 

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:19.567
So there's been a rearrangement
of the carbon 

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.867
skeleton during this reaction. 

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:23.500
So how did this happen? 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.933
Well, silver comes down and
pulls off iodide, which would 

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.767
generate this cation. 

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:36.100
But in a cation we have a low
LUMO, obviously, on the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.100
cationic carbon. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.033
But there are HOMOs next door. 

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.233
They're not very high HOMOs. 

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:46.567
They're the C-C sigma bonds. 

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:50.033
But you could imagine that since
primary cations are 

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.533
rather unstable, and we'll give
some more evidence on 

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:59.100
this later on, that you could
get a rearrangement, in which 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.800
first, the HOMO next door is
shared with the LUMO of the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.133
carbon cation. 

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.733
Did you ever see a structure
like that before, where the 

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:13.300
pair of electrons is shared with
an adjacent atom? 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.533
That's the Y-bond, right? 

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:18.733
The three-center two-electron
electron bond. 

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:22.533
And then it could keep going,
which would give the tertiary 

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:28.300
cation, a carbon cation with
three other carbons attached 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.400
to it, which is much more stable
than the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.100
primary cation is. 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.200
In fact, it's possible that it
doesn't even go that way. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.967
That at the same time the iodide
is leaving and 

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:48.433
beginning to develop this
unstable primary cation, the 

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:52.033
methyl next door should shift
across, so that you directly 

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:56.000
get the cationic rearrangement
product. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.567
But at any rate, once you have
the carbons rearranged like 

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:01.867
that, it's a simple matter to
have-- 

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:05.067
and notice what that means is,
that the sigma of the 

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:07.567
carbon-carbon sigma bond is
actually acting as a 

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:11.000
nucleophile a displacement
reaction. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.933
The carbon next door is backside
attack as the iodide 

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:17.933
is leaving, but it's within the
molecule that the reaction 

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:20.467
is occurring. 

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:24.367
But then you can bring water
down of course, and finally 

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:27.800
lose a proton, which will give
the product. 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.733
But the crucial thing is this
rearrangement, because the 

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:33.667
fact of the rearrangement shows
that there must have 

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:35.700
been a cation intermediate. 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.067
Without that cation, there would
have been no means for 

00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:42.100
the rearrangement to take place
in the carbon skeleton. 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.800
Carbons skeletons don't normally
rearrange. 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.500
But when you lose electrons and
can get these two-electron 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.167
three-center bonds, then a
carbon could move from one 

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:54.867
place to the adjacent one. 

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.733
So the fact of the rearrangement
shows that this 

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:00.900
was an SN1 reaction, that there
was a cation 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.900
intermediate. 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.500
Had there been no cation
intermediate there couldn't 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.433
have been a rearrangement. 

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:09.967
OK, let's think just a second
about the arrangements-- 

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:14.100
so-- we have at about this
three-center 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.533
two-electron bond. 

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:19.500
So we could imagine bringing a
proton down, mixing with the 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.467
pi electrons to form a
three-center 

00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:25.067
two-electron bond. 

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:28.767
We could also imagine bringing a
hydrogen down on one end of 

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:32.800
an alkene to form a normal kind
of cation. 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.100
And of course it could go on the
other end too. 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.633
You can get from one of these to
the next by shifting the 

00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:43.300
hydrogen from left to right. 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.267
That's the rearrangement. 

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:48.733
But the question is, is it a
single minimum, or is it a 

00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:50.300
double minimum? 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.533
Do you have two normal cations
which have a transition state 

00:04:55.533 --> 00:04:58.533
they can go across back and
forth between them that's not 

00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:01.567
too high, because it has this
three-center 

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:02.867
two-electron bond? 

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:07.100
Or might it be that that bridged
structure is in fact 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.933
the lowest energy structure, and
it's a single minimum? 

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:16.967
So you can do simple
calculations to check this, 

00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:19.133
and you may or may not believe
them. 

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:23.633
But these particular ones are
well supported by experimental 

00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:28.133
evidence that we don't have time
to go into right now. 

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:32.467
But if you take the open
compound, that's what its HOMO 

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:33.500
looks like. 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.800
And you notice that the HOMO,
which you would have guessed 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.967
from the structure on the top is
the sigma CH bond, in fact 

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:45.833
is mixed with some of the
electron density in that HOMO, 

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:50.500
or HOMO minus one it is, is
shared over onto 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.967
the cationic carbon. 

00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:56.100
It's distorted, you can see that
the electrons are 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.600
shifting that way. 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.867
And the LUMO is the other way
around, that there's something 

00:06:00.867 --> 00:06:06.733
vacancy of the orbitals that are
involved in the CH bond. 

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.733
So you could imagine that
resonance structure, the one 

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:14.233
that's drawn in color just below
to the right, but you 

00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:16.933
could also have this structure,
which is a proton 

00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:19.967
plus a carbon-carbon double
bond, or you could have a 

00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:23.133
resonance structure that has a
long stretched bond. 

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.700
Remember when you draw resonance
structures, you 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.767
don't move the nuclei. 

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:32.200
So you don't draw that hydrogen
over on the right, 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.633
you draw it with a really long
bond, because they have to be 

00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:37.900
at the same position. 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.467
And if you take those three
simultaneously into account, 

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:45.267
it says you can have positive
charge either on the right 

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:48.200
carbon, on the hydrogen, or on
the left carbon. 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.300
So that's what's denoted by
drawing this Y, that the two 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.733
electrons are shared among these
three centers, and the 

00:06:54.733 --> 00:06:57.067
positive charge, therefore, is
shared. 

00:06:57.067 --> 00:06:58.667
And we can see it in the
orbitals that 

00:06:58.667 --> 00:06:59.767
that's the way it works. 

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:02.400
And of course it makes sense
that you should have that. 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.467
Of course, the CH sigma bond
isn't a very high HOMO, so 

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:11.833
it's not drastically shifted,
not 50/50. 

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:15.833
And we call that, the
stabilization due to that HOMO 

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:18.733
LUMO mixing, hyperconjugation, I
think we've talked about 

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:20.667
that before. 

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:23.533
And incidentally, that's one of
the factors that makes 

00:07:23.533 --> 00:07:26.833
highly substituted carbon
cations stable. 

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:32.467
Because if you have a hydrogen
next door, there's no way that 

00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:36.233
the electrons involved in that
bond can mix with the p 

00:07:36.233 --> 00:07:39.500
orbital, the vacant p orbital,
because they're orthogonal. 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.733
But if you have a carbon and
then a bond, the electrons in 

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:44.367
that bond can overlap. 

00:07:44.367 --> 00:07:48.200
So the more carbons you have
attached to this carbon, the 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.633
more bonds there are whose
electrons could be stabilized 

00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:54.533
by mixing with the vacant
orbital. 

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:58.333
So that hyperconjugation is one
reason that more 

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:02.200
substituted cations are more
stable. 

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.033
Now if we go to the bridged
structure, which is actually 

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:08.333
symmetrically bridged, although
the program drew that 

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:12.367
for its own reasons with a
different kind of bond, and if 

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:15.767
we look at the HOMO, you can see
that it's symmetrical. 

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:19.933
You can see it's the pi orbital,
but it's distorted 

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:24.167
because the hydrogen orbital is
mixed with it. 

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:29.933
And the LUMO is the antibonding
combination, or 

00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:32.067
the LUMO plus one in this case.

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:36.033
So you can see how those
orbitals participate. 

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:38.233
But in fact, in this
calculation, 

00:08:38.233 --> 00:08:41.333
it's a double minimum. 

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:45.033
The open structure is lower in
energy than the bridge 

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:47.100
structure, so it's a double
minimum. 

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.367
But it's different, instead of a
hydrogen on the top, you 

00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:54.033
have a methyl group on top. 

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:56.600
Because the methyl has a
somewhat bigger orbital than 

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.033
hydrogen does, so it's better at
overlapping two neighbors 

00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:03.467
than hydrogen was. 

00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:06.733
So now it turns out to be a
single minimum, that's the 

00:09:06.733 --> 00:09:08.267
lowest energy structure. 

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:11.800
And again, you can see the HOMO,
which is a p orbital on 

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.667
the carbon overlapping with pi,
and the LUMO, which I put 

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.867
in only because I've been
drawing these things, but I 

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:23.900
wouldn't spend a lot of time
worrying about that one. 

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.300
But at any rate it's a single
minimum, so that structure is 

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.200
in fact bridged. 

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.633
Now here I've made the alkene,
the C-C double bond, 

00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:37.167
unsymmetrical, such that a
carbon cation would be more 

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:40.400
stable on one side than on the
other, one side is more 

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.133
substituted. 

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:46.700
And in this case, it distorts so
that it's sort of a double 

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.733
minimum, but the one side is
very low, so it's an 

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:56.833
unsymmetrical cation, and open,
not strongly bridged. 

00:09:56.833 --> 00:10:02.900
That's its structure, and
there's the HOMO, which again 

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.300
is somewhat mixed, but don't
waste time 

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.300
looking at those things. 

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.267
I just put them in because I had
them. 

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:13.233
But anyhow, it's a sort of
double minimum in the sense 

00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:18.300
that it's not a bridged
structure, but it's 

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.533
unsymmetrical and open. 

00:10:20.533 --> 00:10:26.033
OK now, SN1 and E1, there's an
interesting thing about the 

00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:30.400
stereochemistry of SN1
reactions. 

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.867
If you substitute the chloride
here, this tertiary chloride, 

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:40.733
you could imagine getting either
the OH group 

00:10:40.733 --> 00:10:44.633
substituted directly where the
chloride was, or the OH group 

00:10:44.633 --> 00:10:47.600
on the opposite face of the
chloride. 

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.533
Now what would you expect if it
was SN1? 

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:54.000
What about if the SN1-- 

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.800
so the rate determining step is
ionization, you get a 

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.600
cation intermediate, what
structure do you expect for a 

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.033
carbon cation? 

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:06.700
We talked about this last
semester in XH3. 

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.467
So it's the same number of
electrons as BH3. 

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:14.367
There's no electrons in that
fourth orbital. 

00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:15.900
What should that orbital be? 

00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:21.633
There are four atomic orbitals
on the carbon, or boron in 

00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:28.000
BH3, but you only have electrons
in three of them. 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.033
How should you hybridize it? 

00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:35.167
sp2 to get the strongest bonds,
and leave the vacancy 

00:11:35.167 --> 00:11:37.633
in the highest energy orbital,
the p orbital, so 

00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:39.033
it should be planar. 

00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:42.033
Now if you get a planar
intermediate, how much attack 

00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:46.333
should be from one side versus
how much on the other? 

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:48.400
Should be 50/50. 

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.367
But in fact, when you do the
experiment as it says here, 

00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:57.300
you get 40% retention, and 60%
inversion. 

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.533
So 80% of it is racemization,
that's what you expect, that 

00:12:01.533 --> 00:12:05.267
is 40% of right, 40% of left
handed. 

00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:09.767
But the other 20% is excess
inversion. 

00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:12.467
It should have been 100% if
there was a planar 

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:14.500
intermediate cation. 

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.733
Can anybody see how you might
explain this? 

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.767
How could it be that you indeed
form a cation, but it's 

00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:28.333
not equally attacked from the
two faces? 

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:32.400
Mostly it's attacked from the
face opposite the chloride 

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.633
ion, where the chloride ion came
from. 

00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:41.500
Why should it be mostly opposite
where the 

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.867
chloride came from? 

00:12:46.167 --> 00:12:47.600
STUDENT: Steric-steric
hinderance 

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.033
PROFESSOR: Can't hear very well.

00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:49.967
STUDENT: Steric-steric
hindrance? 

00:12:49.967 --> 00:12:53.300
PROFESSOR: Steric hindrance of
what? 

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.600
STUDENT: The electrons in the
chlorine atom. 

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.733
PROFESSOR: Right, the chloride,
even 

00:12:56.733 --> 00:13:00.333
though it's broken the bond, for
a certain time is still 

00:13:00.333 --> 00:13:05.900
around blocking access to the
side it came from. 

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.767
So the idea to explain the net
inversion is that that 

00:13:09.767 --> 00:13:13.267
chloride, for a short time, is
still there, even though it's 

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:14.433
not bonded. 

00:13:14.433 --> 00:13:17.633
So it temporarily blocks the
face that would lead to 

00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:21.133
retention to give the same
stereochemistry coming in 

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:24.467
where the chloride was, and you
get more of the water 

00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:26.833
coming in from the opposite
face. 

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:31.967
So this short lived ion pair
gives an explanation for the 

00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:34.233
net inversion. 

00:13:34.233 --> 00:13:39.033
So even though people would
usually say that SN1 gives 

00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:42.633
racemization, in truth it
doesn't always do so, although 

00:13:42.633 --> 00:13:44.333
it depends on the solvent. 

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:49.933
Because the more the solvent can
stabilize ions, the faster 

00:13:49.933 --> 00:13:53.433
it can get the ions apart from
one another, the less of this 

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.000
affect you would have. So it
depends on the polarity of the 

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.367
solvent, that was acetone and
water. 

00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:03.933
We talked about this elimination
reaction, the 

00:14:03.933 --> 00:14:07.933
t-butyl bromide with sodium
hydroxide gives a large amount 

00:14:07.933 --> 00:14:09.200
of the alkene. 

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.633
But is that process that gives
the alkene E1 or E2? 

00:14:14.633 --> 00:14:17.533
That is, is the rate determining
step formation of 

00:14:17.533 --> 00:14:21.500
the t-butyl cation, and then the
hydroxide attacks it? 

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.833
Or is the rate determining step
attack of the hydroxide 

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:28.567
on a hydrogen, pulling it off at
the same time that the 

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:29.933
chloride leaves? 

00:14:29.933 --> 00:14:31.633
So how could you tell? 

00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:33.633
How could you tell whether it's
E1 or E2? 

00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:41.433
Luke? 

00:14:41.433 --> 00:14:43.333
STUDENT: Maybe test the rate? 

00:14:43.333 --> 00:14:44.233
PROFESSOR: What about the rate? 

00:14:44.233 --> 00:14:45.567
STUDENT: See if it's
bimolecular. 

00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:46.667
PROFESSOR: See if that's 

00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:47.933
what the names mean. 

00:14:47.933 --> 00:14:49.133
So you could follow the names. 

00:14:49.133 --> 00:14:52.933
E2 means it's bimolecular, that
the rate depends on the 

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:54.967
concentration of hydroxide. 

00:14:54.967 --> 00:14:59.600
If the rate limiting step were
breaking the bond, no 

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.767
hydroxide involved there, so the
rate 

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:03.100
wouldn't depend on that. 

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.233
So you can look at the overall
rate, not just the percent of 

00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:10.067
alkene, because more hydroxide
could mean that, even though 

00:15:10.067 --> 00:15:12.767
in the rate determining step you
made the cation, the more 

00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:16.633
hydroxide, the more hydrogens
you pull off, compared to 

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:17.867
water attacking. 

00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:23.967
So if you see the rate, not just
the product ratio, but 

00:15:23.967 --> 00:15:27.000
the rate depends on hydroxide,
then it's E2. 

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.933
OK, another way to see whether
the proton is being pulled 

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:34.200
away in the rate limiting step,
is to look for a kinetic 

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.367
isotope effect. 

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:39.333
Remember that hydrogen is faster
than deuterium by a 

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:43.267
factor of up to about six or
seven usually, only when 

00:15:43.267 --> 00:15:45.533
you're breaking the bond in the
transition state. 

00:15:45.533 --> 00:15:48.333
If the transition state is
forming the ions, and later 

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:51.433
you break the proton away, then
you wouldn't see a 

00:15:51.433 --> 00:15:55.567
hydrogen being faster than
deuterium. 

00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:58.867
OK, now this was a question I
asked on an exam once. 

00:15:58.867 --> 00:16:01.333
Give an example of the influence
of a change in 

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:05.933
reactant structure on the ratio
of SN2 to E2 products. 

00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:08.567
Be as specific and quantitative
as you can. 

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:12.633
And the simplest minded answer
to such a thing, it would be 

00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:16.200
neat to have a more subtle
example, but a really simple 

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.933
one is methyl bromide. 

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:21.433
How about the amount of SN2 and
E2 in that case? 

00:16:21.433 --> 00:16:25.000
Anybody venture a guess? 

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.400
This is in fact a trick
question. 

00:16:31.867 --> 00:16:33.833
Wojciech. 

00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:35.267
I can't hear. 

00:16:35.267 --> 00:16:36.633
STUDENT: There cannot be an
elimination. 

00:16:36.633 --> 00:16:38.233
PROFESSOR: There are not two
carbons, you 

00:16:38.233 --> 00:16:40.933
can't make an alkene, there's no
hydrogen on the adjacent 

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:44.633
carbon, so obviously that's
going to be all SN2. 

00:16:44.633 --> 00:16:46.667
So that was sort of a trick. 

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:50.100
But then in this one, we've seen
from last time that it's 

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.667
much easier to do with a high
concentration of hydroxide, 

00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:57.533
it's much easier to do SN2 than
E2, to the extent-- 

00:16:57.533 --> 00:17:00.567
pardon me, to do E2 than SN2,
because 

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:02.967
the SN2 is so hindered. 

00:17:02.967 --> 00:17:07.933
If you get substitution, it's
SN1 in the cases we saw last 

00:17:07.933 --> 00:17:13.200
time and looking at the rates of
the various RBr's. 

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.267
Now these are really drastic
ratios. 

00:17:16.267 --> 00:17:19.433
Now there are two different
organic chemical perspectives 

00:17:19.433 --> 00:17:22.000
on situations where you have
drastic ratios. 

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.667
One is the perspective of a
synthetic organic chemist, who 

00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:29.067
says it's great to have drastic
ratios, because then 

00:17:29.067 --> 00:17:32.333
you have a reliable way to get a
really high yield. 

00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:35.200
It's not going to be 40/60 or
something like that, and you 

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.800
have to separate and throw away
the stuff you don't want. 

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.367
You get all the stuff you want,
that's great. 

00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:44.300
But for a physical organic
chemist trying to understand 

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.300
mechanism, if you have a really
drastic ratio, then the 

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.733
energy of activation is quite
different between the two, and 

00:17:52.733 --> 00:17:57.033
you can often get an unambiguous
interpretation of 

00:17:57.033 --> 00:18:02.300
what the cause of what's
determining the rate if you 

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.033
can get a really big difference.

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:07.200
If you have just a small
difference, you can't be so 

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.767
confident that it's not just
some subtle change in 

00:18:09.767 --> 00:18:11.567
solvation or something. 

00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:17.233
So for example, the 10^3 steric
retardation of 

00:18:17.233 --> 00:18:21.267
isopropyl via SN2, remember you
had substitution at 

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.433
methyl, at ethyl, at isopropyl,
they 

00:18:23.433 --> 00:18:24.967
got slower and slower. 

00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:28.767
Isopropyl was 1,000 times slower
than methyl. 

00:18:28.767 --> 00:18:33.467
So that's a pretty big effect,
1,000 times, 10 to the third. 

00:18:33.467 --> 00:18:37.467
That meant it must be 4
kilocalories per mole at room 

00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:39.067
temperature difference in those
two. 

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:42.033
So that's pretty big, that's not
like half a kilocalorie or 

00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:43.433
something like that. 

00:18:43.433 --> 00:18:46.733
So a factor of 1,000 or more
often you can be confident in 

00:18:46.733 --> 00:18:47.700
interpreting. 

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.800
Or in the case of t-butyl,
remember it jumped way back up 

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.033
again, it was accelerated by
10^5 compared to isopropyl, by 

00:18:57.033 --> 00:18:59.133
putting that next one in, which
showed that there was a 

00:18:59.133 --> 00:19:03.267
new mechanism coming in, the
formation of the cation 

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.667
intermediate. 

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:09.133
Now what if the ratio is not
drastic? 

00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:11.900
What if the two products that
you could get form in about a 

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.267
50/50 ratio? 

00:19:14.267 --> 00:19:18.500
The synthetic organic chemist
says this is deadly, because 

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.833
he's doing a lot of reactions in
a row to 

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:22.433
try to get some product. 

00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:26.567
If each reaction has a 50%
yield, and you do a whole 

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:30.067
bunch of them in sequence, for
example if you did 12 steps 

00:19:30.067 --> 00:19:34.300
getting a 50% yield at each
step, you'd have a yield at 

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.900
the end of one half to the 12th
power, 0.02%. 

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.233
So a synthetic chemist wants a
reaction that gives a really, 

00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:43.500
really high yield. 

00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:48.567
Although it might be possible to
have a reaction that 

00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:50.733
doesn't give such a good yield,
but to tinker around 

00:19:50.733 --> 00:19:53.533
with it and get the yield up so
that it becomes acceptable 

00:19:53.533 --> 00:19:56.633
in a sequence like that. 

00:19:56.633 --> 00:20:01.467
But a physical organic chemist
finds such a situation 

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:04.767
valuable, because it's a
borderline. 

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:07.967
There's a delicate balance
between going this way and 

00:20:07.967 --> 00:20:09.600
going this way. 

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.167
And now you can see changing
this effect, changing the 

00:20:13.167 --> 00:20:16.267
solvent this way, making it more
polar or less polar, 

00:20:16.267 --> 00:20:19.100
putting a methyl group on,
taking a methyl group off. 

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.867
You can interpret small effects,
so it allows 

00:20:22.867 --> 00:20:26.133
sensitive tests of subtle
influences. 

00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:27.800
For example, isotope effects. 

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.367
Remember that a deuterium
isotope effect, we said the 

00:20:31.367 --> 00:20:34.300
maximum is about a factor of 7
usually. 

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.100
So that's not very big in terms
of 

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.567
kilocalories per mole. 

00:20:39.567 --> 00:20:42.000
But even though it's not a very
big effect, even though 

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.033
it's a small thing, you can
interpret it, because you know 

00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:49.667
that it must involve breaking a
hydrogen away in the rate 

00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:51.533
limiting step. 

00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:56.133
And finally in our discussion of
SN2 and E2 eliminations, 

00:20:56.133 --> 00:20:59.767
I'm going to give you a valuable
lesson that was 

00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:04.733
learned, he taught himself, by
Jo-David Fine, who as you see 

00:21:04.733 --> 00:21:09.567
here was the class of 1972 at
Yale College, and was doing 

00:21:09.567 --> 00:21:13.700
undergraduate research during
the spring of 1971, so 40 

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.067
years ago he began this project.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:20.633
And he continued it through the
summer when he lived on 

00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:24.433
York Street, and then through
the fall, and the next spring 

00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:26.800
as a senior, so this was his
research project. 

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.667
Now what was his research
project? 

00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:30.933
There was an interesting
question he wanted to ask that 

00:21:30.933 --> 00:21:33.433
required preparing this
compound. 

00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:36.833
And the question was this: if
you have a very viscous 

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:42.833
solvent, can motion of the
pieces be a rate or product 

00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:44.133
determining step? 

00:21:44.133 --> 00:21:47.900
Usually we think of bond
formation or bond breaking 

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.367
being a rate limiting step. 

00:21:50.367 --> 00:21:53.767
But obviously for two things to
react with one another, 

00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:55.500
they have to get together. 

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.700
So that requires motion. 

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.200
And if the medium is
sufficiently viscous, and the 

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.333
reaction that follows when they
get close together is 

00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:08.133
sufficiently fast, then it could
be that the rate 

00:22:08.133 --> 00:22:12.567
limiting step would be motion,
not breaking or making bonds. 

00:22:12.567 --> 00:22:15.767
So that was the question that
Jo-David wanted to find the 

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:19.033
answer to, was whether it was
possible that motion would be 

00:22:19.033 --> 00:22:22.900
the rate limiting step, even
very subtle 

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.333
short range of motion. 

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:27.700
It's easy to imagine that long
range motion 

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.967
could be rate limiting. 

00:22:28.967 --> 00:22:32.500
For example, in free radical
chain reactions, you have 

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.300
radicals floating around. 

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.467
Once they find one another,
bingo they're gone. 

00:22:38.467 --> 00:22:40.833
That's the termination reaction
that stops the 

00:22:40.833 --> 00:22:43.967
machines in the free radical
chain reactions. 

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:46.633
So obviously what's rate
limiting is moving them 

00:22:46.633 --> 00:22:47.667
through the solvent. 

00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:51.000
But that's long range motion,
how about very subtle motion? 

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.633
Can it also be rate limiting? 

00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:56.267
So this is what he was going to
do. 

00:22:56.267 --> 00:22:59.300
He was going to use UV light to
knock out a molecule of 

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.333
nitrogen between these two
radicals. 

00:23:01.333 --> 00:23:04.633
So the two radicals are almost
next to one another, but 

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:07.100
there's a nitrogen molecule in
between. 

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.400
But if those two radicals are
going to react with one 

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.967
another, they have to get the
nitrogen out of the way. 

00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:15.233
So how do they get the nitrogen
out of way so they 

00:23:15.233 --> 00:23:16.467
could combine? 

00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:19.533
Well in fact, these radicals
studied in 

00:23:19.533 --> 00:23:21.467
solution don't combine. 

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:24.433
Why would those radicals not
combine easily? 

00:23:24.433 --> 00:23:25.067
Any ideas? 

00:23:25.067 --> 00:23:28.167
Radicals, usually two SOMOs,
come together, form a bond. 

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:29.200
Why not in this case? 

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.633
Lauren? 

00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:33.267
STUDENT: The methyl groups would
be too close together. 

00:23:33.267 --> 00:23:34.867
PROFESSOR: Right, it's a
question of 

00:23:34.867 --> 00:23:36.800
steric hindrance, there are too
many methyl groups to get 

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.467
in the way. 

00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:40.867
So that's not what happens. 

00:23:40.867 --> 00:23:45.433
So in fact what happens, instead
of that, is that you 

00:23:45.433 --> 00:23:50.933
rotate that t-butyl radical
together with the nitrogen. 

00:23:50.933 --> 00:23:53.967
So it's just a rotation, you
don't have to actually move 

00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:58.033
things by translation, just
rotate them to get that 

00:23:58.033 --> 00:23:59.767
geometry shown at the right. 

00:23:59.767 --> 00:24:03.133
And now one radical is close
enough to the deuterium on the 

00:24:03.133 --> 00:24:08.567
other, that you can get a
deuterium atom transfer, which 

00:24:08.567 --> 00:24:13.367
is very exothermic, easy, and
fast. So that would generate 

00:24:13.367 --> 00:24:17.933
then the alkene and the alkane,
by deuterium transfer. 

00:24:17.933 --> 00:24:19.367
Now there's an alternative
reaction 

00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:21.200
for these two radicals. 

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.867
Does anybody see what it is,
besides doing the deuterium 

00:24:24.867 --> 00:24:26.133
atom transfer? 

00:24:32.733 --> 00:24:34.833
What other action could you
imagine? 

00:24:34.833 --> 00:24:36.833
Debby, do you have any idea? 

00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:39.800
STUDENT: No. 

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.400
PROFESSOR: Ok, that particular
process 

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.867
was called radical pair
disproportionation. 

00:24:43.867 --> 00:24:46.233
That's another way that radicals
can kill one another 

00:24:46.233 --> 00:24:48.033
besides coupling. 

00:24:48.033 --> 00:24:53.333
But the second alternative is to
rotate the other group, the 

00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:56.833
one with hydrogens, which would
give the geometry down 

00:24:56.833 --> 00:24:58.033
on the right. 

00:24:58.033 --> 00:25:01.533
And then you would transfer a
hydrogen atom, and that would 

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:07.567
be very exothermic, easy, fast,
and you would get that. 

00:25:07.567 --> 00:25:12.167
So there's a competition then
between transferring hydrogen 

00:25:12.167 --> 00:25:14.633
and transferring deuterium. 

00:25:14.633 --> 00:25:18.067
But what's the product
determining step? 

00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:20.333
What determines which one you
do? 

00:25:20.333 --> 00:25:23.867
Well if it's the hydrogen
transfer, then we know that 

00:25:23.867 --> 00:25:26.433
there'll be a kinetic isotope
effect, and you'll transfer 

00:25:26.433 --> 00:25:30.233
hydrogen more often than
deuterium. 

00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:34.933
But if it's the motion, then the
two rotations should be 

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:37.200
just about equal. 

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.900
There's not a very big effect
from 

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.833
deuterium on the rotation. 

00:25:41.833 --> 00:25:44.567
So all you have to do to answer
this question of 

00:25:44.567 --> 00:25:47.600
whether this very subtle short
range motion, just this 

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.100
rotation, is rate limiting, is
to make this compound, 

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.667
photolize it to knock out the
nitrogen, and see which 

00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:55.467
products you get. 

00:25:55.467 --> 00:25:58.900
Whether the deuterium is in the
alkane product or the 

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.133
alkene product. 

00:26:01.133 --> 00:26:05.167
If it's 50/50, that says that
there wasn't a kinetic isotope 

00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:08.233
effect, hydrogen was not being
transferred when the product 

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.700
was being determined, the
rotation was limiting. 

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.367
If there is an isotope effect,
then that means that the bond 

00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:19.767
breaking, not the motion, was
rate limiting. 

00:26:19.767 --> 00:26:21.500
So that's easy, that's what it
says here. 

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.433
So all he had to do then was to
prepare this compound. 

00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:32.167
And notice how the compound was
pretty carefully devised, 

00:26:32.167 --> 00:26:34.833
not so you can sell it to your
neighbor and make a big 

00:26:34.833 --> 00:26:37.600
profit, but to answer this
particular question. 

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.467
So this is in the same spirit as
the Bartlett and Knox 

00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:43.700
paper, where the idea was to
make some molecule that was 

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.600
designed to answer a particular
question. 

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.633
Now often when you're planning
to make something, you draw a 

00:26:51.633 --> 00:26:55.500
scheme that where the arrow
doesn't show what something 

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.933
goes to something else, it shows
it backwards, it's 

00:26:58.933 --> 00:27:02.667
retrosynthesis, that is, what
could you prepare this 

00:27:02.667 --> 00:27:03.900
compound from. 

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.400
Well we haven't talked about the
reactions that would get 

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.667
from that starting material on
the right to this product, but 

00:27:10.667 --> 00:27:13.333
by the end of the course,
they'll seem trivial to you. 

00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:16.133
They're easy reactions that
would do that. 

00:27:16.133 --> 00:27:19.233
OK, so if you could prepare this
compound, t-butyl 

00:27:19.233 --> 00:27:22.033
hydrazine, then you'd be home
free 

00:27:22.033 --> 00:27:26.333
according to what we planned. 

00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:27.867
So you need t-butyl hydrazine. 

00:27:27.867 --> 00:27:30.567
Now where are you going to get
t-butyl hydrazine? 

00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:33.200
So it requires having a t-butyl
group 

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.533
connected to nitrogen. 

00:27:35.533 --> 00:27:39.167
Well you could buy hydrazine,
that's cheap, you could buy 

00:27:39.167 --> 00:27:41.533
t-butyl chloride, that's cheap.

00:27:41.533 --> 00:27:45.433
At that time 40 years ago, you
could buy a can of it that 

00:27:45.433 --> 00:27:49.800
size for about $5 or something
like that. 

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.900
So all you have to do is do a
substitution reaction where 

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.267
the nitrogen displaces chloride.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.033
Does that sound like a good
synthetic plan? 

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.300
Kate, what do you think about
doing, say, an SN2 reaction, 

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.133
to have the unshared pair on the
nitrogen attack the 

00:28:10.133 --> 00:28:12.167
carbon, displace chloride? 

00:28:12.167 --> 00:28:14.333
Seem OK to you, or not so good?

00:28:17.567 --> 00:28:19.400
STUDENT: I think so.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.300
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.267
STUDENT: I think so. 

00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:22.733
Like a HOMO-LUMO interaction. 

00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:24.100
PROFESSOR:
Yeah, you could imagine the 

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.100
HOMOs and LUMOs. 

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.433
Any problems with it? 

00:28:27.433 --> 00:28:27.967
Ayesha? 

00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:29.267
STUDENT: Steric hindrance-- 

00:28:29.267 --> 00:28:30.533
PROFESSOR:
Steric hindrance, right? 

00:28:30.533 --> 00:28:32.533
When you have all those methyl
groups, it's hard to get at 

00:28:32.533 --> 00:28:36.167
that carbon, and what would
happen instead? 

00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:39.467
If you can't do the
substitution? 

00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:41.867
Elimination. 

00:28:41.867 --> 00:28:43.933
So you're going to have E2 will
be much 

00:28:43.933 --> 00:28:45.733
greater than SN2 here. 

00:28:45.733 --> 00:28:50.567
And in fact, E1 is greater than
SN1 too, so you're going 

00:28:50.567 --> 00:28:53.300
to get this, not that. 

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.567
So you're going to have to
figure some other way of 

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.000
making t-butyl hydrazine. 

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.233
Well fortunately there was in
the literature this paper in 

00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:04.833
the Journal of Organic Chemistry
from 1958 about 

00:29:04.833 --> 00:29:06.900
preparation of these hydra-- 

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.767
that wasn't the title of the
paper, but to make the stuff 

00:29:10.767 --> 00:29:13.133
in the paper, they needed to
prepare hydrazines. 

00:29:13.133 --> 00:29:15.700
And they say in this paper, that
"we explored most of the 

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.333
synthetic methods that have been
used for other alkyl 

00:29:18.333 --> 00:29:19.767
hydrazines. 

00:29:19.767 --> 00:29:24.200
Most failed all together, or
gave only negligible yields" 

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.133
when you tried to do it with
t-butyl. 

00:29:27.133 --> 00:29:29.600
But there was a seldom used
method that had been 

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.333
discovered by Zerner, and that
worked well. 

00:29:32.333 --> 00:29:38.267
And it involved hydrolizing this
CN double bond. 

00:29:38.267 --> 00:29:43.533
So that reacting with water gave
from this half a ketone, 

00:29:43.533 --> 00:29:47.367
a ketone that I think some of
you have seen, and on the 

00:29:47.367 --> 00:29:52.500
right, the t-butyl hydrazine,
the compound you want. 

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.200
So hydrolysis of the immediate
benzophenone. 

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.067
So the idea is to break a CN
double bond and put water in 

00:29:59.067 --> 00:30:02.467
there to put oxygen on the
carbon, the H2 of water on the 

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:07.067
nitrogen, and you have the amine
you want, it's connected 

00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:10.200
to another nitrogen and then to
t-butyl. 

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.300
And it's very common to change
CX double bonds into CO double 

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.767
bonds and H2X, and we'll discuss
this ad 

00:30:17.767 --> 00:30:19.167
nauseam later on. 

00:30:21.867 --> 00:30:27.633
And notice that this reaction is
catalyzed by acid. 

00:30:27.633 --> 00:30:32.233
The way it happens is you put a
proton on this nitrogen, and 

00:30:32.233 --> 00:30:37.833
then that resonance structure
has the cation on the carbon, 

00:30:37.833 --> 00:30:40.733
and that can add water and get
the oxygen on there. 

00:30:40.733 --> 00:30:43.933
But suppose you protonate the
wrong nitrogen. 

00:30:43.933 --> 00:30:48.067
If you protonate that nitrogen
and then shift these electrons 

00:30:48.067 --> 00:30:51.233
in there, now you have the
t-butyl cation, which is going 

00:30:51.233 --> 00:30:55.933
to lose a proton, you have
isobutylene, and you're lost. 

00:30:55.933 --> 00:30:59.933
So it says hot acid caused
elimination of the t-butyl 

00:30:59.933 --> 00:31:02.200
group, so you have to be carried
out at room 

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.967
temperature, you don't want to
warm it. 

00:31:04.967 --> 00:31:06.533
So fine, do it at room
temperature. 

00:31:06.533 --> 00:31:10.567
So this is what Jo-David set out
to do, the synthesis 

00:31:10.567 --> 00:31:14.333
starts with this compound,
weirdly enough, and you have 

00:31:14.333 --> 00:31:18.533
to react it with a Grignard
reagent here, which puts the 

00:31:18.533 --> 00:31:21.533
t-butyl group on and nitrogen,
and then you're going to break 

00:31:21.533 --> 00:31:25.833
that bond, put oxygen on there,
H2 on there, and you're 

00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:27.833
going to have the product you
want. 

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:30.400
That's the idea, that's the
synthetic scheme. 

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.733
So in the first place, it turns
out that t-butyl 

00:31:32.733 --> 00:31:36.433
Grignard is not the easiest
reagent to make, especially in 

00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:38.000
the summer when it's humid. 

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.733
So it was hard for Jo-David to
do this, but finally he got 

00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:45.533
this stuff to add there, and got
the stuff that needed to 

00:31:45.533 --> 00:31:47.933
be hydrolized, and then he tried
to do it. 

00:31:47.933 --> 00:31:51.133
He worked on this from April to
October, through the whole 

00:31:51.133 --> 00:31:55.467
summer, and never got it to
work. 

00:31:55.467 --> 00:31:59.867
And finally he got very
frustrated, so he telephoned 

00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:03.100
Peter A. S. Smith, a professor
at the University of Michigan 

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.567
who had published that paper in
1958, and asked him what 

00:32:06.567 --> 00:32:11.100
gave. And this is a page from
Jo-David Fine's notebook from 

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.667
October 1971: "Private
communication with Doctor P. 

00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:16.100
A. S. Smith. 

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.800
Most importantly, he stressed
that his published method will 

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.233
not give the desired product,
instead the t-butyl group is 

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:27.433
lost. They haven't been able to
reproduce Lakritz's' 

00:32:27.433 --> 00:32:29.167
results, nor to make any more. 

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.567
Although he feels that
hydrolysis in the desired 

00:32:35.567 --> 00:32:38.200
manner is possible, if
hydrolysis 

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.800
is killed very rapidly. 

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.200
He said to, quote, play around
with it." Which of course, 

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.033
Jo-David had been doing from
April to October. 

00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:51.600
So the next comment is the one I
really like in his notebook. 

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.600
"For the sake of public courtesy
and sophistication, I 

00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:00.567
will reserve my own comments on
this subject." Now in 

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:04.667
preparing for this lecture, I
emailed Jo-David Fine, so 

00:33:04.667 --> 00:33:08.700
there's a happy ending to this
rather lachrymose story. 

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.200
He's now a respected Professor
of Dermatology at Vanderbilt, 

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.200
and is the world expert on
Epidermolysis Bullosa, which 

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.333
is a skin disease, he's a
dermatologist after all. 

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:23.900
And his son graduated from Yale
in 2000. 

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.667
Here he is, you see, wearing his
Yale crew tie. 

00:33:27.667 --> 00:33:29.900
He's a very nice guy. 

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.533
And he said in a reply email,
he's a fellow of the Royal 

00:33:33.533 --> 00:33:36.100
College of Physicians in London
now, as well as a 

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.667
Master of Public Health and an
MD. 

00:33:38.667 --> 00:33:41.667
He said, "That project, and my
conversation with that 

00:33:41.667 --> 00:33:45.367
pleasant prof at U of Michigan,
did teach me more 

00:33:45.367 --> 00:33:48.067
about the rigors and foibles of
bench research than 

00:33:48.067 --> 00:33:50.133
anything that I subsequently
experienced as 

00:33:50.133 --> 00:33:51.967
a postdoc at NIH. 

00:33:51.967 --> 00:33:55.267
It therefore prepared me for
many more happily transient 

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:58.833
foibles during the 19 years that
I ran a bench immunology 

00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:01.833
lab at University of Alabama at
Birmingham and University 

00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.300
of North Carolina. 

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.933
As I found out the hard way,
trying to predict 'good 

00:34:05.933 --> 00:34:09.367
behavior' with cell lines,
antibodies, and semi-purified 

00:34:09.367 --> 00:34:13.567
proteins was even more subject
to random whimsy then when I 

00:34:13.567 --> 00:34:15.833
was trying to work with
relatively straightforward 

00:34:15.833 --> 00:34:19.333
purified chemicals in a far more
structured laboratory 

00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:23.267
setting as an undergrad." So he
feels that this was very 

00:34:23.267 --> 00:34:25.967
good training for him. 

00:34:25.967 --> 00:34:31.100
But the important lesson was
learned by me the next year at 

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.767
a Gordon Conference in the
summer, up in New Hampshire, 

00:34:33.767 --> 00:34:37.300
when I ran into my graduate
school friend Steven Nelson, a 

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.500
professor at the University of
Wisconsin. 

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:45.100
He said that the way to make
t-butyl hydrazine is to react 

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.367
this with this. 

00:34:49.567 --> 00:34:56.033
Now it's indeed true that 95% of
it is elimination, but that 

00:34:56.033 --> 00:35:00.467
product is a gas, so it just
goes away. 

00:35:00.467 --> 00:35:04.367
And the other 5% is the stuff
you want. 

00:35:04.367 --> 00:35:07.467
Furthermore, it's very easily
purified, you 

00:35:07.467 --> 00:35:09.267
can crystallize it. 

00:35:09.267 --> 00:35:14.967
So in one day, I made 10 grams
of it. 

00:35:14.967 --> 00:35:16.633
This was after Jo-David had
graduated. 

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.800
So what's the lesson here? 

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:29.233
If you have cheap starting
materials, that the yield you 

00:35:29.233 --> 00:35:31.033
get is not a big deal. 

00:35:31.033 --> 00:35:33.533
If you got cheap stuff, and you
can easily do it and 

00:35:33.533 --> 00:35:36.267
purify the product, that's the
way to make this stuff. 

00:35:38.967 --> 00:35:41.800
OK, so there's a second happy
ending, that Jo-David Fine 

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.733
then had a successor the next
year when we 

00:35:43.733 --> 00:35:45.300
actually had the compound. 

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.933
He was able to make it, test it,
and find out that if you 

00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:51.700
have a fluid solvent, there's an
isotope effect. 

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.533
Hydrogen is transferred more
than deuterium, the atom 

00:35:54.533 --> 00:35:56.433
transfer is rate limiting. 

00:35:56.433 --> 00:35:58.933
But in a very viscous solvent at
low temperature, the 

00:35:58.933 --> 00:36:02.167
kinetic isotope effect
disappeared, it was 50/50 

00:36:02.167 --> 00:36:04.900
hydrogen to deuterium transfer,
because this 

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.367
demonstrated that motion had
become rate limiting. 

00:36:07.367 --> 00:36:10.433
So it is possible for very
subtle motion to be the rate 

00:36:10.433 --> 00:36:12.133
limiting step in a reaction. 

00:36:12.133 --> 00:36:14.467
So there were two happy endings
to this, Jo-David 

00:36:14.467 --> 00:36:19.233
learned a valuable lesson, and I
learned something both from 

00:36:19.233 --> 00:36:24.167
Jo-David and from Steve Nelson,
and from this result. 

00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:28.433
So this is stuff that'll be
included on Friday in the 

00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:31.833
exam, I'm sorry that it's taken
so long to do this. 

00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:33.967
And I'm going to give a review
this evening, but the 

00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:36.833
registrar seems to be having
trouble getting to work or 

00:36:36.833 --> 00:36:38.300
something, I'm not sure. 

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.000
That's not surprising today. 

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.633
So we'll have a room in WLH I'm
sure, and I'll email you 

00:36:43.633 --> 00:36:44.867
where it's going to be. 

00:36:47.367 --> 00:36:52.033
OK now, the next topic is going
to be backwards what 

00:36:52.033 --> 00:36:52.867
we've been doing. 

00:36:52.867 --> 00:36:56.633
So what we've been doing is
substitution and elimination. 

00:36:56.633 --> 00:37:00.867
And the elimination reaction is
of course this, where the 

00:37:00.867 --> 00:37:04.333
hydrogen and the leaving group
go away, proton and leaving 

00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:07.667
group minus typically. 

00:37:07.667 --> 00:37:09.800
So we have a leaving group. 

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.433
Now the next topic is going to
be electrophilic, as it's 

00:37:13.433 --> 00:37:15.967
called, addition to alkenes. 

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:20.467
Now notice that this is the
reverse of E1 or E2, with some 

00:37:20.467 --> 00:37:22.333
of the names changed. 

00:37:22.333 --> 00:37:26.167
So where we have a proton there,
that's a low LUMO, of 

00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:29.133
course an electrophile, some
place where electrons could be 

00:37:29.133 --> 00:37:30.533
easily accommodated. 

00:37:30.533 --> 00:37:33.367
But we can generalize it, it
doesn't have to be a proton, 

00:37:33.367 --> 00:37:37.767
it can be any electrophile, just
call it EL. 

00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:39.867
And the thing that was a leaving
group, we're going to 

00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:42.233
change the name of, it's a high
HOMO. 

00:37:42.233 --> 00:37:46.233
We're going to call it a
nucleophile, and now with 

00:37:46.233 --> 00:37:50.633
those changed names, we're going
to reverse the reaction, 

00:37:50.633 --> 00:37:53.567
and take the alkene to a
substituted alkane. 

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.933
Now there are a number of
questions involved with this, 

00:37:59.933 --> 00:38:04.767
both ones involving mechanism,
and ones involving synthetic 

00:38:04.767 --> 00:38:06.433
practicality. 

00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:08.200
One is what can you make? 

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.433
That's a synthetic question. 

00:38:11.433 --> 00:38:14.333
What can electrophile and
nucleophile be? 

00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:17.633
And you'll see that they could
be a wide range of things. 

00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:21.433
Then there's a mechanistic
question, is this a HOMO-LUMO 

00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:24.300
kind of reaction, or does it
involve 

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.767
singly occupied orbitals? 

00:38:25.767 --> 00:38:28.367
Is it a free radical reaction? 

00:38:28.367 --> 00:38:30.167
There's the question of timing.

00:38:30.167 --> 00:38:32.767
Do you make both bonds at once,
or do you make one bond 

00:38:32.767 --> 00:38:33.800
and then the other? 

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.000
And if so, which one? 

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.367
There's the question of
stereochemistry. 

00:38:38.367 --> 00:38:41.033
Do the electrophile and
nucleophile come in on 

00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:44.333
opposite sides of the double
bond, or on the same side? 

00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:47.767
And that's particularly
relevant, of course, if they 

00:38:47.767 --> 00:38:50.333
happen to be in the same
molecule, then almost 

00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:53.967
certainly they have to come in
on the same side. 

00:38:53.967 --> 00:38:58.733
But if you come in stepwise, one
first, then the other side 

00:38:58.733 --> 00:39:00.667
can flop around. 

00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:03.300
So you could attack either side
of the other one, even if 

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.833
the two things are coming in
from the same side. 

00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:07.933
You could attack the opposite
face if it was 

00:39:07.933 --> 00:39:09.333
stepwise and it rotated. 

00:39:09.333 --> 00:39:11.467
So that's going to be an
interesting question, whether 

00:39:11.467 --> 00:39:15.100
the product is from syn or anti,
we studied that already 

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.767
in elimination, whether
elimination was syn or anti. 

00:39:18.767 --> 00:39:22.867
And then there's the question of
regiochemistry, or as it's 

00:39:22.867 --> 00:39:26.633
sometimes called orientation,
whether the reaction follows 

00:39:26.633 --> 00:39:28.633
Markovnikov's rule. 

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:33.733
Now Markovnikov's rule happens
when you have an unsymmetrical 

00:39:33.733 --> 00:39:38.900
case, and you're adding HX. 

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.067
So you can have X go on the
carbon that's more 

00:39:42.067 --> 00:39:43.367
substituted. 

00:39:43.367 --> 00:39:45.667
And a name that's sometimes been
given to this is the 

00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:52.500
Matthew Rule, from this Bible
quotation, Matthew 25:29: "For 

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.267
unto everyone that hath shall be
given, and he shall have 

00:39:56.267 --> 00:40:00.367
abundance." So the carbon that
already has two methyls gets 

00:40:00.367 --> 00:40:06.700
another X, an H goes to where
the H's were. 

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.833
Contemporary economics seems
often to work that way, that 

00:40:09.833 --> 00:40:12.400
the people that have a lot get a
lot, right? 

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.700
So that's one rule, that's the
Markovnikov rule. 

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:20.300
But sometimes, it's
anti-Markovnikov, the product 

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.533
puts the hydrogen on the carbon
that has more things. 

00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:28.900
So all these are questions we're
now going to address. 

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.000
Last year we had a guest lecture
from Professor Siegel 

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.300
from Zurich who talked with a
more synthetic 

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.500
perspective to the class. 

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.200
If you want to read his lecture,
you could listen to 

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.333
it and see what he wrote on the
board on the web for last 

00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:45.433
year's website. 

00:40:45.433 --> 00:40:47.667
But anyhow, from a synthetic
perspective, the idea is you 

00:40:47.667 --> 00:40:50.533
have an alkene, an unsymmetrical
alkene, and 

00:40:50.533 --> 00:40:53.933
you're going to react it was
some AB reagent, and put A on 

00:40:53.933 --> 00:40:55.833
one end and B on the other. 

00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:58.667
And what can A and B be? 

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:01.733
That is, what products can you
make from an alkene? 

00:41:01.733 --> 00:41:05.767
You can imagine putting two H's
on, an H and an X, an H 

00:41:05.767 --> 00:41:11.733
and an OH, two X's, X and OH, OH
and OH, or you could 

00:41:11.733 --> 00:41:15.800
imagine OH and H. Now we already
had H and OH, but this 

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.433
is different. 

00:41:16.433 --> 00:41:19.367
It's a different orientation,
like that Markovnikov, 

00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:22.500
anti-Markovnikov, and the same
here with these. 

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.733
So in the course of the lecture
he went through and 

00:41:24.733 --> 00:41:28.433
showed a number of reagents and
filled in this scheme of 

00:41:28.433 --> 00:41:30.933
what happens, and what kind of
stereochemistry 

00:41:30.933 --> 00:41:32.233
you have and so on. 

00:41:32.233 --> 00:41:36.933
So that's the synthetic
motivation for studying these 

00:41:36.933 --> 00:41:41.233
things, what compounds can you
make from alkenes? 

00:41:41.233 --> 00:41:43.700
But we're going to take, you
won't be surprised, a little 

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.533
more physical approach, and look
first at the 

00:41:47.533 --> 00:41:53.367
thermodynamic stability of some
of the alkenes, and then 

00:41:53.367 --> 00:41:55.633
at how they react. 

00:41:55.633 --> 00:41:58.833
Now you wonder where you get
this information about 

00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:00.700
stability of compounds. 

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.367
A great place to get it is from
this website, which I can 

00:42:05.367 --> 00:42:06.967
get on the other computer here.

00:42:06.967 --> 00:42:10.700
If you put NIST, which is the
National Institute of Science 

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.033
and Technology [correction:
National Institute of 

00:42:12.033 --> 00:42:14.233
Standards and Technology] into
Google, you get this. 

00:42:14.233 --> 00:42:18.400
And the very first thing you see
is Chemistry WebBook. 

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.567
So if you click there, you get
the Chemistry WebBook and I 

00:42:21.567 --> 00:42:23.067
think I've got that here too. 

00:42:23.067 --> 00:42:27.600
And then you can search in that
WebBook by different 

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.000
criteria, and the easy one is
formula for our purposes. 

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.333
And let's suppose we're
interested in butenes. 

00:42:35.333 --> 00:42:48.000
So we have C4H8, and let's work
in 

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
kilocalories, not in SI units. 

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.033
So let's search and see what we
can find. 

00:42:56.033 --> 00:43:00.833
OK, so here's what I just found,
and it's also on here. 

00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:05.367
So I have 1-butene, 2-butene, in
two flavors, Z 

00:43:05.367 --> 00:43:08.100
and E, cis and trans. 

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.600
Then I have 2-methyl-1-propene,
an isomer, 

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.800
and cyclobutane. 

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:22.333
Also methylcyclopropane and
2-butene, generic that is, not 

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.000
separated as to isomers. 

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.367
So let's just look at 1-butene
and see what kind of 

00:43:26.367 --> 00:43:29.467
information is available. 

00:43:29.467 --> 00:43:32.400
So we see there's all kinds of
data available here. 

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.900
Gas phase thermochemistry,
condensed phase 

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:39.033
thermochemistry, phase changes,
reaction 

00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:40.533
thermochemistry. 

00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:43.700
That's particularly interesting,
but let's first 

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.567
look at gas phase
thermochemistry. 

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:54.600
So here we see the heat of
formation in the gas phase is 

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.833
almost 0, it has about the same
energy as the elements 

00:43:57.833 --> 00:44:00.300
graphite and hydrogen do. 

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.733
And if you look at the heat of
combustion it's this. 

00:44:02.733 --> 00:44:05.567
And what's particularly
valuable, is you can see how 

00:44:05.567 --> 00:44:08.433
well it's known, what the error
limits are. 

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:17.833
These data have been evaluated
by here ALS, which is Afeefy, 

00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:19.433
Liebman, and Stein. 

00:44:19.433 --> 00:44:23.933
But it also gives where the
information came from. 

00:44:23.933 --> 00:44:30.400
So if you click on that, you get
that those things came 

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.867
from Prosen, Maron and Rossini.

00:44:32.867 --> 00:44:35.667
Now this Rossini is not the guy
who wrote 

00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:37.933
The Barber of Seville. 

00:44:37.933 --> 00:44:44.400
It's Frederick Rossini, who was
a great thermodynamicist 

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.433
who measured lots and lots of
these things. 

00:44:47.433 --> 00:44:50.000
Notice incidentally that also
there's a lot of data from the 

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.533
Thermodynamic Research Center at
Texas A&amp;M in Texas. 

00:44:54.533 --> 00:44:57.833
Now Rossini started at the
National Bureau of Standards, 

00:44:57.833 --> 00:45:02.067
which is what's become NIST when
it got renamed, then he 

00:45:02.067 --> 00:45:05.233
went to Notre Dame, and then he
went to Rice in Houston. 

00:45:05.233 --> 00:45:06.467
Now some of you are from
Houston. 

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.600
Why should somebody who lives in
Houston be interested in 

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.000
the energies of hydrocarbons? 

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.033
He measured a zillion
hydrocarbons. 

00:45:21.033 --> 00:45:22.267
Why? 

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.267
Cassie? 

00:45:25.267 --> 00:45:26.667
STUDENT: Oil? 

00:45:26.667 --> 00:45:28.000
PROFESSOR:
Oil. 

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.300
This started in 1942. 

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.567
The American Petroleum Institute
started a big 

00:45:33.567 --> 00:45:36.400
project to determine
thermodynamic properties of 

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.300
all the things that could be in
petroleum and refined 

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.667
petroleum and so on. 

00:45:41.667 --> 00:45:46.500
So this was done first at the
National Bureau of Standards, 

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:51.600
then to Mellon Institute in
Pittsburgh as it was than, and 

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.933
then he went to Rice. 

00:45:52.933 --> 00:45:56.400
So there's a method in what
they're doing here. 

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.667
And I'll be back up. 

00:45:58.667 --> 00:46:02.100
OK so we've got that. 

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:06.267
If we go down a little further,
we could look at 

00:46:06.267 --> 00:46:07.533
reaction thermochemistry. 

00:46:11.967 --> 00:46:20.133
So this is the heat evolved when
you do a reaction, so 

00:46:20.133 --> 00:46:24.267
notice that here is 1-butene
becomes 2-butene, 

00:46:24.267 --> 00:46:28.000
trans-2-butene, and here are
different people who measured 

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.900
it, either by equilibrium
constant, or by isothermal 

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.767
calorimetry, and these are the
values they obtained. 

00:46:39.767 --> 00:46:44.100
And you can see they're pretty
similar to one another. 

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:48.933
That the 2-butene, the
trans-2-butene, is more stable 

00:46:48.933 --> 00:46:52.167
than 1-butene by about 3
kilocalories per mole. 

00:46:55.467 --> 00:47:02.933
Now you can go down in this to
other reactions. 

00:47:07.567 --> 00:47:08.600
These are different reactions. 

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.467
There's adding HBr to 1-butene.

00:47:12.467 --> 00:47:14.433
The one I'm looking for-- 

00:47:14.433 --> 00:47:17.733
here's going to the
cis-2-butene. 

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.767
Oh that's the first one I had. 

00:47:23.767 --> 00:47:24.833
So cis and trans. 

00:47:24.833 --> 00:47:27.933
You see it's a different energy
involved in going to 

00:47:27.933 --> 00:47:29.900
cis and trans. 

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.033
But the one I really looking for
is a little further down 

00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:43.133
here in the middle here, is
adding hydrogen to get butane. 

00:47:43.133 --> 00:47:49.867
So here for that reaction-- 

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.900
wait, I'm out of sync with
what's over here. 

00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.067
This is changing 1-butene to
cis-2-butene, and here are all 

00:48:00.067 --> 00:48:02.867
these values for that. 

00:48:02.867 --> 00:48:07.067
And the next one over here on
the web is the one I just 

00:48:07.067 --> 00:48:09.800
talking about, 30 kilocalories
for that. 

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.533
But you can also do it, and I'm
not going to do it over 

00:48:12.533 --> 00:48:16.333
there for the sake of time, you
can see how much energy is 

00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:21.667
giving off in adding hydrogen to
cis-2-butene, and how much 

00:48:21.667 --> 00:48:23.867
to trans-2-butene. 

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:26.767
Now these differences in energy
that you get here-- 

00:48:30.867 --> 00:48:34.467
wait, here now-- 

00:48:34.467 --> 00:48:37.233
all give the same product. 

00:48:37.233 --> 00:48:41.133
Now there's a big advantage to
doing a reaction that's not 

00:48:41.133 --> 00:48:43.667
very endothermic or exothermic.

00:48:43.667 --> 00:48:45.933
It's not like combustion, which
is 600 

00:48:45.933 --> 00:48:48.467
calories per mole. 

00:48:48.467 --> 00:48:52.100
To take one thing to another
that involves rather small 

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:56.233
amount of energy, like this
adding hydrogen to the alkene, 

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:59.567
and to take three different
isomers and convert them to 

00:48:59.567 --> 00:49:01.233
the same thing. 

00:49:01.233 --> 00:49:06.867
You see why that's a nice
experiment to do? 

00:49:06.867 --> 00:49:07.533
Yes? 

00:49:07.533 --> 00:49:08.533
STUDENT: You can make more? 

00:49:08.533 --> 00:49:08.933
PROFESSOR: Pardon? 

00:49:08.933 --> 00:49:10.733
STUDENT: You could make more of
it? 

00:49:10.733 --> 00:49:12.233
PROFESSOR: Well you could make
more, but 

00:49:12.233 --> 00:49:15.033
not many people want to make
butane. 

00:49:15.033 --> 00:49:19.633
You get that for free, or from
the petroleum to begin with. 

00:49:19.633 --> 00:49:20.867
It's for purposes of 

00:49:20.867 --> 00:49:23.700
measurement that it's important.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.667
Because if you're measuring a
small amount of energy and 

00:49:26.667 --> 00:49:30.633
make a 2% error, it's not very
much. 

00:49:30.633 --> 00:49:34.433
If you're measuring 600 calories
and make a 2% error, 

00:49:34.433 --> 00:49:38.300
that's 12 kilocalories. 

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:43.767
But here, you see these errors
are a part in 200, a part in 

00:49:43.767 --> 00:49:47.000
300, a part in 300. 

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.433
So now you know all these
compounds relative to the same 

00:49:52.433 --> 00:49:56.500
compound, to very high
precision, which means you 

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.867
know the relative to one
another. 

00:49:59.867 --> 00:50:05.367
So that's the way to really get
the data properly. 

00:50:05.367 --> 00:50:08.633
So here's a table from a
textbook, I think it's the 

00:50:08.633 --> 00:50:11.367
Jones textbook which gives these
things, but you've seen 

00:50:11.367 --> 00:50:17.500
now where it really comes from,
from this NIST webbook. 

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.967
Here are data I collected from
the NIST 

00:50:20.967 --> 00:50:23.200
webbook for the hexenes. 

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.300
And you'll notice that a whole
bunch of them were done by 

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.433
Professor Wyberg in the 1980's
and 1990's, the guy who talked 

00:50:29.433 --> 00:50:30.967
to you last year. 

00:50:30.967 --> 00:50:34.333
And this is a problem to do
after the exam, so it could be 

00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:36.600
due next Wednesday, say
something like that, a week 

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.533
from today. 

00:50:37.533 --> 00:50:40.533
But to try and look at these
numbers here, the relative 

00:50:40.533 --> 00:50:46.767
stability of the hexenes, and
see whether it's consistent 

00:50:46.767 --> 00:50:49.900
with what you find for the
butenes in terms of the 

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.667
relative energies. 

00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:53.600
That is, are there regularities
of the energy 

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.167
between cis and trans double
bond? 

00:50:56.167 --> 00:50:59.333
Of the difference between a
double bond at the end of the 

00:50:59.333 --> 00:51:02.033
chain, and a double bond in the
middle of the chain. 

00:51:02.033 --> 00:51:03.633
Can we make generality that way?

00:51:03.633 --> 00:51:06.533
So that's a fun project to look
at. 

00:51:06.533 --> 00:51:10.200
But the first thing to do is to
get to the exam on Friday, 

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.200
so I'll talk to you this evening
about that. 

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.433
That's it.

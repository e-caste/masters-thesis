00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.769
Prof: Okay,
now today we move--basically we

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.990
move into the twentieth century.
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.208
And there is a lot of
similarity between the three

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:21.330
authors we will be discussing:
Nietzsche, Freud and Max Weber.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.060
You know, Durkheim will be a
somewhat different kind of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.910
story.
 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.872
But all--I mean,
Nietzsche, of course,

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:34.155
died in 1900,
but he was out of action for

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:38.639
ten years because of mental
illness, rather severe mental

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:39.760
illness.
 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.490
He published all of his work in
the nineteenth century.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.175
Freud and Weber started to
publish in the nineteenth

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:49.290
century.
 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.541
But these three characters,
in many ways,

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:57.255
are very important bridges
towards twentieth century social

00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:58.150
theory.
 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:06.709
In a way they did foreshadow a
great deal of theorizing,

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:10.860
particularly during the second
half of the twentieth century,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.750
especially in the last thirty
or forty years.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.465
I think it's also very easy to
see the point of departure from

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:25.820
Marx--
some continuity,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.912
but the basic point of
department from Marx in the work

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:35.550
of Nietzsche,
Freud, and Weber.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:43.163
If I can put it very simply,
the major departure is that

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:50.500
they all depart from Marx's
economic reductionism--

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.060
right?--the emphasis on
economic interest,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.236
which is actually not only
Marx.

00:01:57.236 --> 00:01:57.800
Right?
 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.739
It was common in Adam Smith,
and Marx as well.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:11.402
They depart from this and they
emphasize that the problem in

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:17.050
modernity is not so much in the
economic system;

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.460
it is much more in terms of
power and consciousness.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:32.050
The problem of modernity is
repression, in one way or

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.508
another.
 

00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:41.406
The problem of modern life is
that we internalize the reasons

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:48.199
for our own subjugation,
as such, and somehow we have to

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:54.262
figure out how to liberate
ourselves from this internalized

00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:55.830
subjugation.
 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.060
Why do we obey orders?
 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.520
Why do we actually accept that
we are subjugated?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.777
This is the central question,
I think, Nietzsche,

00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:11.438
Freud, and Weber are posing.
 

00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:18.360
It's again a question which has
not been really asked by the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.818
other theorists we discussed so
far.

00:03:22.818 --> 00:03:30.128
They just had civil society as
a point of reference for the

00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:32.020
good society.
 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.803
Now the problem for Nietzsche,
Freud, and Weber is in us,

00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:42.864
internally--in us,
how we solve the problem within

00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:44.310
ourselves.
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.699
So this is a kind of
introducing the three authors.

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.940
In some ways one can say
Nietzsche,

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.781
Freud, and Weber not only
foreshadows twentieth century

00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:02.687
social theory,
but in some ways they are the

00:04:02.687 --> 00:04:08.288
first of post-modern theorists--
right?--the theorists which are

00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:14.051
beginning to come to terms with
the oppressive nature of

00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:18.204
modernity,
and try to figure out how to

00:04:18.204 --> 00:04:19.740
transcend that.
 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:26.074
Now I think what I asked you to
read for today is probably the

00:04:26.074 --> 00:04:30.230
most difficult text for the
semester,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.827
The Genealogy of Morals,
and you may have been greatly

00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:38.267
frustrated by it,
and probably also irritated by

00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:40.940
it, because he's a very
provocative mind.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.939
I hope you did what I suggested;
namely, you had a cursory

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.430
reading of the text before
today,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.920
and now you can go back to the
text,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.262
after my lecture notes,
and I think that should help

00:04:57.262 --> 00:05:03.759
you to find your way out and to
see what he is really up to.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.600
Now what is he up to?
 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.035
Let me just foreshadow,
before I get into his life and

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:13.600
work, and particularly in
Genealogy of Morals.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.244
There is another point in which
Nietzsche, Freud,

00:05:20.244 --> 00:05:27.720
and Weber can be understood in
relationship to Marx.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.492
In my very introductory
comments, I emphasized the

00:05:31.492 --> 00:05:35.880
difference--right?--the shift
away from the economy to the

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.730
question of power and
domination.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:45.360
But there is a point at which
there is a continuity between

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.649
them and Marx--Nietzsche,
Freud and too mainly Weber;

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:54.209
I mean, Weber is a somewhat
more complicated story.

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:57.600
But certainly Nietzsche and
Freud are critical theorists;

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.685
critical theorists in the sense
as we defined this earlier.

00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:02.250
Right?
 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.430
Critical theorists,
that they are offering a

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.019
criticism of human
consciousness.

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:12.560
What is in our mind and how did
it get into our mind,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.750
and how-- and the problem of
our consciousness in

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.720
relationship to our existence.
 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.036
And this is very much critical
theory as it was defined by

00:06:24.036 --> 00:06:27.673
Hegel and then the young Marx,
the Hegelian Marx,

00:06:27.673 --> 00:06:30.399
the Marx of Paris
Manuscripts.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:31.310
Right?
 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.370
The Marx of alienation. Right?
 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.242
This is very much coming from
this tradition,

00:06:38.242 --> 00:06:43.435
and the central issue is how
can we subject this to critical

00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:44.579
scrutiny?
 

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:49.723
And in Nietzsche's case,
there is an incredible attempt

00:06:49.723 --> 00:06:55.726
being made here to try to offer
a critical theory which does not

00:06:55.726 --> 00:06:59.156
really have a critical vantage
point.

00:06:59.156 --> 00:07:00.300
Right?
 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.411
All critical theories of Hegel
and Marx and twentieth century

00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:11.810
critical theory do have an idea
of a good society,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.351
of an emancipated human
existence, and they criticize

00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.389
the reality,
the society what they are

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.384
analyzing,
from the point of view of this

00:07:23.384 --> 00:07:25.230
critical vantage point.
 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.850
Nietzsche is different.
 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.569
He is really the most radical
of critical theorists.

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:38.108
And in the twentieth century
the theorist which builds the

00:07:38.108 --> 00:07:42.579
most consistently on it is
Michel Foucault--

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:47.526
right?--who tried to create a
theory which is critical of

00:07:47.526 --> 00:07:53.175
existence and our consciousness,
but critical without telling

00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:58.300
you what is good,
what you should be aspiring for.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.889
And that's exactly what
Nietzsche is trying to do.

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:05.620
It is sort of the squaring of
the circle.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.468
Can you be critical of a
situation if you cannot tell

00:08:10.468 --> 00:08:12.800
what is the good outcome?
 

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.639
Right?
 

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:19.432
Can you actually subject the
very notion of the good society,

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:22.620
the good, to critical scrutiny?
 

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.601
This is what he's trying to do.
 

00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:25.050
Right?
 

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.740
To offer such a theory.
 

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.290
Well Freud is different. Right?
 

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:39.120
Freud is a critical theorist
beyond Hegel and beyond Marx.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.734
He does agree with Marx that we
have to find some critical

00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:50.250
analysis which is rooted in our
sensuous experiences,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.763
and somehow we have to relate
the problems of our

00:08:54.763 --> 00:08:58.619
consciousness to our sensuous
experiences.

00:08:58.619 --> 00:08:59.558
Right?
 

00:08:59.558 --> 00:09:03.796
In this respect,
Freud is very much in the line

00:09:03.796 --> 00:09:06.558
of Marx's critique of Hegel.
 

00:09:06.558 --> 00:09:09.808
This is not simply radicalizing
your consciousness;

00:09:09.808 --> 00:09:13.125
you have to confront your
consciousness with your sensuous

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:13.940
experiences.
 

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.259
But he is different from Marx
because--

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:19.769
I pointed this out earlier very
briefly--

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:23.682
because in Marx,
this sensuous activity is

00:09:23.682 --> 00:09:27.360
production,
it is economic activity.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.519
For Freud it is our sexual
experiences--

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:36.980
right?-and he offers a
criticism of our consciousness

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:42.967
by confronting us with our
repressed sexual experiences in

00:09:42.967 --> 00:09:44.754
our earlier life.
 

00:09:44.754 --> 00:09:45.908
Right?
 

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:47.682
So this is a critical theory.
 

00:09:47.682 --> 00:09:48.110
Right?
 

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.379
He said, "What you think
is in your mind is right.

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:52.730
No, no, no, it isn't."
 

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.340
Right?
 

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.591
You have to think about all of
your experiences of your earlier

00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:59.464
sexual life,
and then when you figure out

00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:02.220
what you repressed as bad
memories,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.283
that's when you will actually
will be able to have a healthier

00:10:06.283 --> 00:10:07.149
psychic life.
 

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:07.750
Right?
 

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:14.009
Well Weber is more complicated,
and we will come back to this,

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:16.769
Weber's critical theory,
when we get to Weber,

00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:20.139
and to the question whether
he's a critical theorist at all,

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:22.538
that has been highly debated.
 

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:25.850
Okay, I think now we are ready
for Friedrich Nietzsche.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.481
And I hope this makes more
sense now for you--right?--what

00:10:29.481 --> 00:10:30.566
you were reading.
 

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:31.139
Right?
 

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:34.529
And let me just emphasize one
more time--

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:40.605
right?--the big project in
Nietzsche is to offer a critical

00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:45.928
scrutiny of human mind,
but not to have any critical

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:47.226
vantage point.
 

00:10:47.226 --> 00:10:47.970
Right?
 

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.840
To criticize the very
principles of good society and

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.610
good, to critical scrutiny.
 

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:01.109
Where does it come from when we
have the conception of good and

00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:02.440
good society?
 

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.690
That is his project.
 

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.561
It's an incredible intellectual
venture.

00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:08.149
Right?
 

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:11.984
As I said, it is this kind of
squaring of the circle,

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:14.897
what he does;
what he does with a great deal

00:11:14.897 --> 00:11:15.500
of power.
 

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.240
And he does it extremely
provocatively.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.119
I will put up a couple of
quotations for it,

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:22.659
which are outrageous.
 

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:26.279
Don't walk out on it. Right?
 

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.769
Wait a little.
 

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:29.908
Hold your breath, listen.
 

00:11:29.908 --> 00:11:32.440
This is outrageous what he's
saying.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.210
He's a provocateur.
 

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.809
He is like Rousseau;
he is only worse than Rousseau.

00:11:38.809 --> 00:11:39.259
Right?
 

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:42.788
He provokes us even more than
Rousseau.

00:11:42.788 --> 00:11:46.070
But, you know,
deep down he's a very

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.662
sensitive--you know?--very
humanistic human being.

00:11:50.662 --> 00:11:51.600
Right?
 

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.418
He provokes you.
 

00:11:53.418 --> 00:11:56.990
But if you listen carefully,
you figure out there is

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.070
something what you actually can
relate to it,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.919
when you think what he's
actually trying to get at.

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:06.690
All right, here is Nietzsche.
 

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.690
And let me just very briefly
rush through his life.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.587
He was born in 1844,
in the small city of

00:12:13.587 --> 00:12:17.389
Röcken in Germany,
near Leipzig.

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:20.777
And this is very important:
his father was a Lutheran

00:12:20.777 --> 00:12:24.620
minister, and the family was all
clergy, Lutheran clergy.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:30.032
And he's bringing up,
in a very religious sentiments,

00:12:30.032 --> 00:12:32.528
very religious family.
 

00:12:32.528 --> 00:12:38.129
And in many ways his work is a
reaction against the father,

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:42.908
and it is a reaction against
the kind of Lutheran

00:12:42.908 --> 00:12:47.590
Christianity he was deeply
internalized into.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.149
I think this is very important
to understand.

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:54.893
I mean, I know that most of the
people in this room have strong

00:12:54.893 --> 00:12:59.254
feelings in Judeo-Christian
tradition, and he attacks also

00:12:59.254 --> 00:13:01.548
Judeo-Christian tradition.
 

00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:03.960
This is a revolt against the
father.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.139
This is a revolt against what
he was brought up to.

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:10.514
It is an attempt to find
himself.

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:11.110
Right?
 

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.340
That's what he's trying to get
at.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.056
And you have to be a little
tolerant about him,

00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:17.710
you know, and his attempt.
 

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.120
You did that as well.
 

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.322
You were revolting against your
parents, and you were revolting

00:13:23.322 --> 00:13:27.658
against some of the fundamental
principles you were born into.

00:13:27.658 --> 00:13:32.605
He actually enrolls to the
University of Bonn to become a

00:13:32.605 --> 00:13:35.080
Lutheran minister himself.
 

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.750
He studied theology.
 

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.811
As it happens to many people
actually who enroll into a

00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:45.250
seminary, doesn't take him too
long to become an atheist.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:51.644
Very often the seminaries are
the best training grounds for

00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:52.636
atheists.
 

00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:53.629
Right?
 

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:57.932
You're beginning to see somehow
the complexity of theological

00:13:57.932 --> 00:13:58.649
thought.
 

00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:00.389
This is what he experienced.
 

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:02.168
So he quits after a year.
 

00:14:02.168 --> 00:14:08.524
He realizes he is on his way to
become an atheist--right?--and

00:14:08.524 --> 00:14:11.860
he will not become a minister.
 

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.870
Actually this happened to my
brother as well.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.370
He actually did not quit,
he did finish;

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.649
he was also trained as a
Lutheran minister.

00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:26.986
But by the end of his
theological training he was--I

00:14:26.986 --> 00:14:31.153
don't think he ever
confessed--but he was actually

00:14:31.153 --> 00:14:32.428
an atheist.
 

00:14:32.428 --> 00:14:35.461
So I have personal
experiences--right?--what

00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:37.085
theology can do to you.
 

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:37.720
Right?
 

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.355
Okay, then '68,
there is a very important event

00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:45.070
in his life.
 

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.187
He meets the greatest composer
of his time, Richard Wagner,

00:14:49.187 --> 00:14:53.162
and they become great friends
for a time, and they become

00:14:53.162 --> 00:14:56.634
bitter enemies later on;
and it is very important why

00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:57.428
this happened.
 

00:14:57.428 --> 00:15:01.812
He is appointed as Professor of
Classical Philosophy at the

00:15:01.812 --> 00:15:05.288
University of Basel,
before he got actually his

00:15:05.288 --> 00:15:06.120
degree.
 

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.726
But he doesn't do it for too
long.

00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:09.360
Right?
 

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.500
He's only teaching for eight
years in his life,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:19.042
and then he retreats and he
sacrifices his life to scholarly

00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:22.144
activity--
spends a lot of time in Italy

00:15:22.144 --> 00:15:26.993
and, if he's in Switzerland,
in a small, beautiful spot,

00:15:26.993 --> 00:15:28.240
Sils Maria.
 

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.879
He also meets in '73 Paul
Rée,

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:37.708
a German philosopher,
who has a great deal of impact

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:40.700
on him,
who introduces him in '82 to

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.328
Lou Salomé,
his only real but very

00:15:44.328 --> 00:15:45.990
passionate lover.
 

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.409
And I will say a few words
about this later on.

00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:53.158
In '88 he becomes mentally ill.
 

00:15:53.158 --> 00:15:56.998
The story of his beginning of
his mental illness tells you a

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.038
lot about him.
 

00:15:58.038 --> 00:16:02.361
He is in Genoa,
in Italy, and then he walks on

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:08.318
the streets, and then he sees a
carriage driver beating a horse

00:16:08.318 --> 00:16:09.759
vengefully.
 

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:16.047
And then he suddenly cuddles
the horse, beginning to cry,

00:16:16.047 --> 00:16:18.629
and his mind is gone.
 

00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:19.808
All right?
 

00:16:19.808 --> 00:16:22.279
He falls deeply into mental
illness.

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:24.250
He never recovers anymore.
 

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:29.129
It I think tells a lot about
who Nietzsche as a human being

00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:33.505
was--right?--and how
actually--how much compassion he

00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:35.693
could have with suffering.
 

00:16:35.693 --> 00:16:36.620
Right?
 

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:41.196
This work, what you were
reading, has a lot to do with

00:16:41.196 --> 00:16:45.773
suffering, and gives you a
devastating view what human

00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:47.500
suffering means.
 

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.683
Anyway, he's in care of his
mother until she dies,

00:16:52.683 --> 00:16:56.917
and then his care,
unfortunately for him,

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:59.879
to his sister Elisabeth.
 

00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:04.778
And he dies in her home in 1900.
 

00:17:04.778 --> 00:17:08.140
Now a bit about Elisabeth
Nietzsche.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.220
Here she is.
 

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:17.740
She was born two years after
Nietzsche.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:23.429
And she married a guy whose
name was Bernhard Förster,

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:24.410
in 1885.
 

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:29.250
And Förster was one of
these proto-Nazis.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.200
He was a fanatic anti-Semite.
 

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.038
He was very attracted to this
idea of the superior Aryan race,

00:17:37.038 --> 00:17:42.048
and he actually created an
Aryan colony in Paraguay,

00:17:42.048 --> 00:17:46.290
and moved with Elisabeth to
Paraguay in a pure German

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.269
community.
 

00:17:47.269 --> 00:17:51.037
Some remains still exist,
and if you are a devoted

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:53.904
neo-Nazi,
you may want to visit Paraguay,

00:17:53.904 --> 00:17:57.545
because there are some of these
guys here still hanging out

00:17:57.545 --> 00:17:58.108
there.
 

00:17:58.108 --> 00:18:02.351
They look like Indians,
because of course not very pure

00:18:02.351 --> 00:18:05.228
Aryan nation;
they are not blonde and blue

00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:06.259
eyes any longer.
 

00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:08.851
They intermarried with the
locals.

00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:09.480
Right?
 

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.819
But anyway, this is what he
wanted to do.

00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:13.108
It didn't work very well.
 

00:18:13.108 --> 00:18:18.575
So at one point he committed
suicide and Elisabeth returned

00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:19.798
to Germany.
 

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:23.018
Well I think it's very
important that Nietzsche,

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:26.645
after she got married,
broke the relationship with his

00:18:26.645 --> 00:18:27.400
sister.
 

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.247
He just could not stand his
brother-in-law and his

00:18:32.247 --> 00:18:33.828
anti-Semitism.
 

00:18:33.828 --> 00:18:37.714
Though you will see some of the
citations which sound very

00:18:37.714 --> 00:18:40.510
anti-Semitic,
he was very intolerant about

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.670
anti-Semites.
 

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.606
This was one of the reasons why
he broke his relationship with

00:18:45.606 --> 00:18:46.640
Richard Wager.
 

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:53.220
But in '94, Elisabeth created
the Nietzsche Archive.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.819
Nietzsche was insane,
and he had a lot of unpublished

00:18:57.819 --> 00:18:59.588
work, manuscripts.
 

00:18:59.588 --> 00:19:03.461
She put it together into an
archives, and she abused it as

00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:04.818
much as she could.
 

00:19:04.818 --> 00:19:10.511
She turned into a right-winger
and with the rise of Nazism a

00:19:10.511 --> 00:19:13.308
Nazi, an admirer of Hitler.
 

00:19:13.308 --> 00:19:17.505
And she put together a lot of
Nietzsche texts,

00:19:17.505 --> 00:19:22.818
in order to fabricate a Nazi
ideology out of Nietzsche.

00:19:22.818 --> 00:19:25.912
And some, therefore,
had been reading for a very

00:19:25.912 --> 00:19:29.068
long time Nietzsche as an
ideologue of Nazism.

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:33.018
So did Adolph Hitler,
who actually even attended the

00:19:33.018 --> 00:19:36.578
funeral of Elisabeth in 1935,
when she died.

00:19:36.578 --> 00:19:41.180
Well I think people who read
Nietzsche carefully,

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.101
and who have seen now
Nietzsche's original work

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.695
published,
rather than selections by

00:19:47.695 --> 00:19:49.980
Elisabeth,
have a great deal of doubt

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.000
whether Nietzsche has anything
to do with Nazism.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.808
Though the story is complicated.
 

00:19:54.808 --> 00:19:57.385
Now here we come,
a nice triangle:

00:19:57.385 --> 00:20:01.056
Lou Salomé,
Paul Rée and Friedrich

00:20:01.056 --> 00:20:02.150
Nietzsche.
 

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.049
Well I should show this picture
after Freud.

00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:08.670
Remember that.
 

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.573
Watch on it;
it is a very Freudian kind of

00:20:12.573 --> 00:20:15.173
presentation,
Louis Salomé,

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:20.470
Paul Rée in the middle,
and Friedrich Nietzsche on the

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.000
other side of the picture.
 

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.430
Now Lou, Paul and Friedrich.
 

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.498
Paul Rée actually comes
from a very wealthy Jewish

00:20:30.498 --> 00:20:32.750
family, German Jewish family.
 

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.267
For reasons which is beyond me,
occasionally Nietzsche refers

00:20:37.267 --> 00:20:40.219
to him,
when they already broke up,

00:20:40.219 --> 00:20:43.559
as "the English
psychologist";

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:45.230
he was a German philosopher.
 

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.140
Anyway, he became very good
friends, at one point.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.769
I mean, Nietzsche was an
impossible person.

00:20:53.769 --> 00:20:56.548
He'd fall in love with people
and then he broke.

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.680
Just strong love or strong
hatred;

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.009
there was nothing in between.
 

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:05.047
But anyway, the idea of
genealogy, which is probably the

00:21:05.047 --> 00:21:09.818
main piece in Nietzsche's work,
is coming from Paul Rée.

00:21:09.818 --> 00:21:13.118
Then he introduced this
wonderful young,

00:21:13.118 --> 00:21:16.460
and very smart young lady,
Lou Salomé,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.910
to Nietzsche,
and he falls desperately in

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.890
love with her.
 

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.410
This happened in '82.
 

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.258
She was
twenty-one-years-old--as I said,

00:21:25.258 --> 00:21:28.180
very beautiful,
and wonderfully smart.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.318
And well Nietzsche was hoping
to marry her;

00:21:33.318 --> 00:21:37.160
I mean, he was opposed to the
idea of marriage,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.818
but he's writing letters to
Paul Rée--

00:21:40.818 --> 00:21:45.165
kind of not aware that there is
a relationship going on between

00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:48.510
Paul Rée and Lou--
that he wants to marry her,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.500
probably for two years or
something.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.840
Anyway, I think by all
likelihood there is an

00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:00.068
interesting love triangle going
on here for awhile.

00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:04.018
But Nietzsche is impossible,
and Lou is a sane woman,

00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:07.738
and at one point she just
cannot take his insanity

00:22:07.738 --> 00:22:08.650
anymore.
 

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.548
And he moves to Berlin--lives
for awhile with Paul Rée.

00:22:13.548 --> 00:22:16.594
And then, though she is also
opposed to marriage--we are

00:22:16.594 --> 00:22:18.920
talking late nineteenth century,
right?;

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.990
very radical ideas about
sexuality and marriage--but then

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.058
she still married this guy,
a linguist called Andreas.

00:22:27.058 --> 00:22:28.838
Anyway, she was also a very
smart woman.

00:22:28.838 --> 00:22:30.963
She at one point said they
wrote a book

00:22:30.963 --> 00:22:33.872
together--Rée,
Nietzsche, and herself--and she

00:22:33.872 --> 00:22:35.269
never published that.
 

00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:39.102
She said this one was an
experiment, a joint book by the

00:22:39.102 --> 00:22:39.660
three.
 

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.108
We never--as far as I know,
it never had.

00:22:43.108 --> 00:22:47.160
Another important person in his
life: Richard Wagner.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:56.298
Well Nietzsche was a music
fanatic already in his boyhood,

00:22:56.298 --> 00:23:00.720
and when he read Wagner's piano
transcript of Tristan and

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.269
Isolde,
he just fell in love with that.

00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:06.980
That was the music he was
looking for.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.970
Why?
 

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.818
He was a hero worshipper.
 

00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:13.257
That's why people,
some people,

00:23:13.257 --> 00:23:16.670
read still in him a kind of
proto-Nazis.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:21.175
He liked strong,
beautiful people who are heroic

00:23:21.175 --> 00:23:26.048
and do heroic acts;
like the Greek. Right?

00:23:26.048 --> 00:23:30.549
A beautiful young man,
powerful, and heroic,

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:33.900
like the gods,
the Greek gods;

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.680
that's what he really admired.
 

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.170
And this is what he found in
Wagner's music,

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:44.069
a rejection of the roots of
Rossini kind of sentimentalism

00:23:44.069 --> 00:23:48.640
of Italian music,
and in fact the classicism and

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.960
coldness and pretentiousness in
the music of Beethoven.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.690
And what he found is something
new in Wagner.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.450
So he was attracted to Wager.
 

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:07.880
And as he was becoming actually
increasingly anti-Semitic,

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.910
under the influence of his last
wife,

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.818
Cosima, who was the daughter of
Franz Liszt,

00:24:15.818 --> 00:24:19.928
the composer,
and was really a pretty evil

00:24:19.928 --> 00:24:20.829
person.
 

00:24:20.829 --> 00:24:24.670
And also Wagner was changing.
 

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.767
He was becoming in some ways
kind of more Christian or

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:32.865
something, and he was writing
this--I actually have to

00:24:32.865 --> 00:24:36.190
confess--lovely opera,
Parsifal.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.759
Well, Nietzsche could not take
it.

00:24:39.759 --> 00:24:40.690
You know?
 

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:41.970
It was impossible for him.
 

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.480
So then they break.
 

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.740
He could not stand Wagner's
anti-Semitism,

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.400
and he could not stand
Parsifal,

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.848
and a kind of expression of--I
don't know,

00:24:52.848 --> 00:24:57.349
anybody ever heard
Parsifal?

00:24:57.349 --> 00:24:58.589
No.
 

00:24:58.589 --> 00:24:59.930
Well not easy stuff.
 

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.380
It sounds like an oratorium.
 

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:07.913
It has some Bachian kind of
elements in it,

00:25:07.913 --> 00:25:14.500
and it's about the sacrifice of
the lamb of God;

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:22.940
Jesus' sacrifice,
and a performance of the mass

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:30.278
and the cult of Jesus' blood,
as such.

00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:34.130
I mean, anyway this was
certainly--Nietzsche was not a

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.220
buyer for it.
 

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:39.934
Well just a word about his
first book, The Birth of the

00:25:39.934 --> 00:25:43.576
Tragedy--which,
as I said, he was a great

00:25:43.576 --> 00:25:46.720
admirer of the Greek
civilization.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.343
And here he--his idea is that
the whole human history is

00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:58.067
driven by the struggle between a
Dionysian and Apollonian

00:25:58.067 --> 00:25:59.500
principle.
 

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.569
Dionysian means--right?--your
sentiments, right?

00:26:03.569 --> 00:26:05.618
You act out of your instincts.
 

00:26:05.618 --> 00:26:09.548
And Apollonian means the
reason, as such.

00:26:09.548 --> 00:26:13.549
And the book contrasts
Enlightenment.

00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:15.358
Enlightenment is reason.
 

00:26:15.358 --> 00:26:20.423
It's a victory of Apollonian
principle over the Dionysian

00:26:20.423 --> 00:26:21.509
principle.
 

00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:25.423
And he kind of rejected--this
is also why he's also kind of

00:26:25.423 --> 00:26:29.605
post-Modern, right?--he rejects
Enlightenment and Enlightenment

00:26:29.605 --> 00:26:31.358
excessive rationalism.
 

00:26:31.358 --> 00:26:36.442
And this is why actually he
liked Wager, because he thought

00:26:36.442 --> 00:26:41.876
in Wagner the Dionysian and the
Apollonian components are being

00:26:41.876 --> 00:26:42.664
combined.
 

00:26:42.664 --> 00:26:43.630
Right?
 

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:47.150
Passion and reason are put
together.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:50.160
And Wagner loved the book.
 

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.865
Then he writes a book,
1879, Human,

00:26:53.865 --> 00:26:58.672
All Too Human,
which starts from Voltaire and

00:26:58.672 --> 00:27:03.579
the sort of reification of the
free thinkers.

00:27:03.579 --> 00:27:05.220
Now he is a free thinker.
 

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:11.306
And he also breaks with
Romanticism, and follows

00:27:11.306 --> 00:27:12.990
Rée.
 

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.292
And he said,
"Well what we have to do

00:27:15.292 --> 00:27:18.663
is to subject the Christian idea
of good and evil to critical

00:27:18.663 --> 00:27:21.230
scrutiny,
not to accept that there is

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.740
some general principle of
good."

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.906
And therefore he tries to
develop The Genealogy of

00:27:26.906 --> 00:27:27.700
Morals.
 

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.194
Now, as you can see,
Wagner and Nietzsche are on a

00:27:31.194 --> 00:27:32.406
collision course.
 

00:27:32.406 --> 00:27:33.048
Right?
 

00:27:33.048 --> 00:27:37.375
Nietzsche is now subjecting the
very core of Judeo-Christian

00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:42.858
tradition to critical scrutiny,
while Wagner is writing

00:27:42.858 --> 00:27:50.269
Parsifal and being the
Holy Grail and asceticism.

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:54.068
Wagner assumedly even has not
read the book.

00:27:54.068 --> 00:27:57.318
He heard about it and rejected
it.

00:27:57.318 --> 00:28:00.009
He did not buy anything about
this.

00:28:00.009 --> 00:28:04.298
Now this is Nietzsche's house
in Sils Maria.

00:28:04.298 --> 00:28:08.288
He went there for the first
time in '81, fell in love with

00:28:08.288 --> 00:28:11.720
this, and spent time there until
he became ill.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.670
He also wrote The Genealogy
of Morals.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.920
He wrote to his mother,
"Finally I've found the

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.960
loveliest spot on earth."
 

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.490
And he was greatly inspired.
 

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.420
This is where he wrote the book
Also sprach

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.528
Zarathustra, Thus
Spoke Zarathustra.

00:28:29.528 --> 00:28:34.115
This is a kind of a book which
is a central attack on

00:28:34.115 --> 00:28:38.788
Judeo-Christian morality,
what he found repressive and

00:28:38.788 --> 00:28:41.170
wants to get out of it.
 

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.790
His hero is Zarathustra,
which is modeled after the

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.904
Persian prophet Zoroaster,
and he calls him,

00:28:47.904 --> 00:28:52.913
"The first of immoralists;
to dare to be immoral is what

00:28:52.913 --> 00:28:54.788
you have to do."
 

00:28:54.788 --> 00:28:58.493
And he tries to find a middle
way--right?--between the

00:28:58.493 --> 00:29:02.058
repressive Judeo-Christian
morality and nihilism.

00:29:02.058 --> 00:29:05.828
He wants to get--doesn't want
to reject everything.

00:29:05.828 --> 00:29:09.173
And that's where he's beginning
to develop the idea of the

00:29:09.173 --> 00:29:10.640
Übermensch.
 

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.538
I wish we would have more time
to talk about this.

00:29:13.538 --> 00:29:18.210
The Übermensch is
basically the person who brings

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.778
his life under his own control.
 

00:29:20.778 --> 00:29:23.667
It's not quite what you think
the Übermensch is.

00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:24.058
Right?
 

00:29:24.058 --> 00:29:26.750
The stereotypes about the
Übermensch,

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.273
that this was a kind of Nazi
idea of the blond

00:29:29.273 --> 00:29:31.630
Germans--right?--which are
superhuman.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.742
Well Nietzsche has a philosophy
called Notion of the

00:29:34.742 --> 00:29:36.269
Übermensch.
 

00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:38.830
The Übermensch is
the person who achieves

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.442
self-mastery,
who--basically the alienated

00:29:41.442 --> 00:29:43.923
person--
right?--who is in control of

00:29:43.923 --> 00:29:47.842
his own life--
right?--and can express himself

00:29:47.842 --> 00:29:50.835
authentically,
without oppressive

00:29:50.835 --> 00:29:51.914
civilization.
 

00:29:51.914 --> 00:29:52.578
Right?
 

00:29:52.578 --> 00:29:54.289
That's the
Übermensch.

00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:56.410
In a way this is a Buddha.
 

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.240
It is an idea of a Buddha,
but not a passive Buddha.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.663
He disliked Buddhism as much as
he disliked the Judeo-Christian

00:30:04.663 --> 00:30:05.519
tradition.
 

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:10.358
The problem with Buddhism was
that it is too passive.

00:30:10.358 --> 00:30:13.173
He wanted to have an active
Buddhism.

00:30:13.173 --> 00:30:13.798
Right?
 

00:30:13.798 --> 00:30:19.807
Somebody who becomes a master
of its life, through action,

00:30:19.807 --> 00:30:26.450
acting out his feelings and his
even sensual essence in life.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:31.250
And therefore he can overcome
what he calls "the eternal

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.288
return."
 

00:30:32.288 --> 00:30:33.009
Right?
 

00:30:33.009 --> 00:30:36.623
He can overcome the iron law of
these--you know,

00:30:36.623 --> 00:30:39.391
this is again comes from almost
Marx.

00:30:39.391 --> 00:30:40.160
Right?
 

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.559
Reified consciousness.
 

00:30:41.559 --> 00:30:43.519
The reified word can be broken.
 

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:46.460
There are no rules. Right?
 

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:51.151
You can realize yourself in the
world, and you are not ruled by

00:30:51.151 --> 00:30:52.740
the external world.
 

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.048
Now he's ready for The
Genealogy of Morals.

00:30:57.048 --> 00:30:59.980
I have some twelve minutes for
this.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.180
What are the major
contributions?

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:07.799
Well he reconstructs the
methodology of genealogy,

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:12.761
what he takes from Rée,
and he discovers what he calls

00:31:12.761 --> 00:31:15.640
"the origins of
morality."

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.759
And then he introduces a
difference.

00:31:18.759 --> 00:31:21.722
Okay, what is the difference
between good and bad,

00:31:21.722 --> 00:31:24.384
where this is coming from,
and good and evil,

00:31:24.384 --> 00:31:26.200
where this is coming from?
 

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.633
And he compares the two ways,
how this dichotomy,

00:31:29.633 --> 00:31:32.710
that some behavior is good,
other is bad;

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.864
some behavior is good,
other is evil,

00:31:34.864 --> 00:31:36.538
where this is coming from.
 

00:31:36.538 --> 00:31:39.590
And this is the essence of the
genealogical method.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.078
Right?
 

00:31:40.078 --> 00:31:42.190
He does not need a critical
vantage point.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.867
The good and the evil
distinction can be criticized

00:31:45.867 --> 00:31:49.031
from the good/bad distinction
point of view,

00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:51.460
and the good--and vice-versa.
 

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:56.088
You see what--this is the
essence of genealogical method.

00:31:56.088 --> 00:32:00.053
As Foucault will interpret it:
"Give me a notion,

00:32:00.053 --> 00:32:02.145
tell me what is right."
 

00:32:02.145 --> 00:32:02.818
Right?
 

00:32:02.818 --> 00:32:05.847
"And what I do,
I take the same conception back

00:32:05.847 --> 00:32:08.336
in history,
and that will show what you

00:32:08.336 --> 00:32:10.554
think is right,
just, or noble,

00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:14.390
has been at one point of time
regarded as evil,

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:15.900
what you should fight for.
 

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.000
And tell me what you think is
evil,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.121
and I'll go back in history and
I will show you instances where

00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:25.977
what you think is evil was
actually admired and was seen as

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:26.907
ethical."
 

00:32:26.907 --> 00:32:27.640
Right?
 

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.882
This is the essence--right?--of
the genealogical method.

00:32:31.882 --> 00:32:32.500
Right?
 

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.598
That you compare two ways how
morality has been constructed,

00:32:36.598 --> 00:32:40.182
and you are criticizing one
from the point of view of the

00:32:40.182 --> 00:32:43.618
other,
without taking sides where do

00:32:43.618 --> 00:32:46.759
actually you stand,
as such.

00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:51.116
And then he develops the kind
of origins of the notion of

00:32:51.116 --> 00:32:55.318
evil, out of slave morality and
ressentiment.

00:32:55.318 --> 00:32:59.575
And then comes one of the most
controversial issues,

00:32:59.575 --> 00:33:03.913
the idea of the blond beast,
the bird of prey and the

00:33:03.913 --> 00:33:08.207
origins of ideals;
what can be easily--again,

00:33:08.207 --> 00:33:11.798
I will have to ask for your
patience.

00:33:11.798 --> 00:33:14.750
And then the idea of
Übermensch.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:20.019
And finally the origins of
punishment and bad consciousness

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:21.108
and guilt.
 

00:33:21.108 --> 00:33:23.615
Okay, so as I said,
he reconstructed the

00:33:23.615 --> 00:33:25.028
genealogical method.
 

00:33:25.028 --> 00:33:29.719
I think this is a wonderful
sentence, how the whole book

00:33:29.719 --> 00:33:34.238
begins: "We are unknown to
ourselves, we knowers,

00:33:34.238 --> 00:33:36.368
and with good reason.
 

00:33:36.368 --> 00:33:38.776
We have never looked at
ourselves."

00:33:38.776 --> 00:33:39.269
Right?
 

00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:43.134
This is critical theory,
what he suggests.

00:33:43.134 --> 00:33:43.890
Right?
 

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:48.556
You think you know a lot of
stuff about Hobbes and Locke and

00:33:48.556 --> 00:33:50.930
Rousseau, and now Nietzsche.
 

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.750
But you don't look at yourself.
 

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.734
Look at yourself,
be critical of your own

00:33:55.734 --> 00:33:56.930
consciousness.
 

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.452
And especially the major step
here: try to subject the very

00:34:01.452 --> 00:34:06.210
conceptions what you think is
ethical to critical scrutiny.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.639
Where does this idea come from?
 

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:15.902
And he said--his real argument
is that the origins of the terms

00:34:15.902 --> 00:34:20.686
good and evil would do--
we have to discover how it

00:34:20.686 --> 00:34:25.246
actually was constructed,
and not with a more superior

00:34:25.246 --> 00:34:26.329
principle.
 

00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:31.329
So therefore what we need is a
critique of moral values.

00:34:31.329 --> 00:34:32.730
This is wonderful now.
 

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:36.815
"The value of these values
should be subjected to critical

00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:38.266
scrutiny itself."
 

00:34:38.266 --> 00:34:38.860
Right?
 

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.681
And not only the values,
but the values behind the

00:34:41.681 --> 00:34:44.882
values;
you know, there is an unending

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:47.210
criticism in the process.
 

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:52.398
So this way what Nietzsche can
do, or he believes he can do,

00:34:52.398 --> 00:34:57.059
is to offer a critical
analysis, without some ultimate

00:34:57.059 --> 00:34:57.940
value.
 

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.130
He does not give you ultimate
values,

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.114
what is the right is,
but he does that without

00:35:03.114 --> 00:35:07.030
becoming nihilistic and to say
"anything goes."

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.969
Not, "We can discover the
miseries of the world."

00:35:10.969 --> 00:35:12.389
We can be upset.
 

00:35:12.389 --> 00:35:17.659
He could be so upset to cuddle
this horse which is beaten.

00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:18.400
Right?
 

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.340
You can have compassion;
and that he showed.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.360
This was an inspiration for
Foucault.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.853
All right, the differences in
the origins of good and bad,

00:35:28.853 --> 00:35:30.079
and good and evil.
 

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.650
Well I think this is a
pretty--probably the most

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.659
straightforward part in the
text, what you have read.

00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:38.686
Yes, he said,
"Well, when we use the

00:35:38.686 --> 00:35:43.224
word 'good', you often see that
good has something to do with

00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:45.420
being not egoistic."
 

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.989
He said, "Well,
that's not so.

00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:50.253
It has nothing to with
non-egoistic,

00:35:50.253 --> 00:35:51.869
in terms of its origin.
 

00:35:51.869 --> 00:35:55.599
It was constructed as a
non-egoistic later on."

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:57.420
And he said,
"Where does the good

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.110
coming from?
 

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:04.427
It is coming from a master race;
a master race which saw itself

00:36:04.427 --> 00:36:11.760
as good and defined those who
were subjected to its rule,

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.130
usually dark-skinned,
natives, as bad.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.483
That is where the notion of
good and bad is coming

00:36:21.483 --> 00:36:22.639
from."
 

00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:27.380
But that's different with
priests.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.268
You know, he was studying to
become a minister,

00:36:30.268 --> 00:36:33.579
and he really disliked priests;
priests, you know,

00:36:33.579 --> 00:36:35.510
wearing these dark clothes.
 

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:39.688
You know, they are not the
chivalry aristocratic kind,

00:36:39.688 --> 00:36:44.340
like the Greek semi-gods and
gods--right?--who are confident

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.760
in themselves.
 

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:52.552
And therefore the chivalry and
aristocratic distinction--which

00:36:52.552 --> 00:36:55.329
was what?;
the physically good.

00:36:55.329 --> 00:36:55.929
You know?
 

00:36:55.929 --> 00:36:58.239
The beautiful body.
 

00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:03.440
The men and women of Greek
antiquity could see themselves

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.456
as good, and others who were not
as good--was crippled,

00:37:08.456 --> 00:37:10.130
they were bad.
 

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:17.110
Now the priests are powerless,
and this powerlessness leads to

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:21.173
hatred;
hatred of those who have power.

00:37:21.173 --> 00:37:21.860
Right?
 

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:26.340
And now those who have power
are seen by the powerless as

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.460
evil--not simply as bad,
but as evil.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.563
So now the contrast is not
between good and bad,

00:37:33.563 --> 00:37:36.010
but between good and evil.
 

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:40.559
But what turned around is the
power relationship.

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:42.480
And now comes the slave
morality.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.432
And well he said it was the
Jews that was the priestly

00:37:46.432 --> 00:37:49.000
nation,
the nation of priests,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.130
and the origins of Christianity
brought about this reversal,

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.429
saying, "Only those who
suffer are good;

00:37:57.429 --> 00:38:00.431
only poor, the powerless are
good.

00:38:00.431 --> 00:38:01.159
Right?
 

00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:04.230
The rich and those in power are
evil." Right?

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:08.690
And the slave revolt of
moralities, he said,

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:12.010
begins with the Jewish revolt.
 

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:16.280
And this has a thousand years
of history.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.929
And you know what?
 

00:38:17.929 --> 00:38:19.480
That was victorious.
 

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.559
This is the dominant morality
of our times.

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:26.789
And he said this leads to
the--and here you can see,

00:38:26.789 --> 00:38:28.730
this is not an anti-Semitic
statement,

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.920
this is a criticism of the
Judeo-Christian morality,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.900
and in fact the real target is
Christian morality.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.108
That's why he said,
"This is the horrible

00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:41.248
paradox of God on cross."
 

00:38:41.248 --> 00:38:41.889
Right?
 

00:38:41.889 --> 00:38:45.192
That is, you know,
when you sort of

00:38:45.192 --> 00:38:51.409
turn--right?--those without sin
to carry the sin of humankind;

00:38:51.409 --> 00:38:55.956
a self-crucifixion of God for
the salvation of mankind.

00:38:55.956 --> 00:38:56.630
Right?
 

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.690
And this is this
ressentiment;

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:03.023
ressentiment,
there is no proper English or

00:39:03.023 --> 00:39:04.317
German word for it.
 

00:39:04.317 --> 00:39:04.929
Right?
 

00:39:04.929 --> 00:39:09.367
Now beginning to see the enemy
not simply as bad--as I don't

00:39:09.367 --> 00:39:13.280
care if it is bad,
I'll defeat it--but it is evil;

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.139
it may even defeat me.
 

00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:19.380
And now comes the blond beast;
another provocative statement.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.934
"The center of all noble
races, one cannot fail to see

00:39:22.934 --> 00:39:25.905
the beast of prey;
the magnificent blond

00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:29.400
beast"--rig
ht?--"avidly prowling

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.144
around to spoil and
victory."

00:39:32.144 --> 00:39:33.059
Right?
 

00:39:33.059 --> 00:39:34.590
As I said, hero worship.
 

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:39.730
But let's--you know,
is this the German blond?

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.286
He said, "Well Europe
viewed with horror the raging of

00:39:43.286 --> 00:39:46.170
the blond Germanic beast for
centuries."

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.119
But then he adds--and watch
carefully,

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:52.744
right?--"Although between
the old Germanic people and us

00:39:52.744 --> 00:39:56.088
Germans,
there is scarcely an idea in

00:39:56.088 --> 00:39:57.949
common,
let alone blood

00:39:57.949 --> 00:39:59.215
relationship."
 

00:39:59.215 --> 00:39:59.750
Right?
 

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.490
This is not Nazi ideology.
 

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.960
Right?
 

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.655
This is a kind of an argument
that being powerful,

00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:11.349
realizing yourself,
is actually what is desirable,

00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:14.800
what you should be striving
for.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:20.630
Well I think this is very
important--right?--this last

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.489
sentence I'm quoting here.
 

00:40:23.489 --> 00:40:24.480
Right?
 

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.650
"What's happening in the
European situation is kind of a

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:28.443
leveling."
 

00:40:28.443 --> 00:40:28.920
Right?
 

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.179
"Today we see nothing what
wants to expand.

00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:34.572
We are getting thinner."
 

00:40:34.572 --> 00:40:35.150
Right?
 

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:39.543
We are not as strong as this
statue in- Greek statue.

00:40:39.543 --> 00:40:40.219
Right?
 

00:40:40.219 --> 00:40:45.027
"And better natured"--
right?--"cleverer,

00:40:45.027 --> 00:40:48.900
and more comfortable"--
right?--"and more

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.190
mediocre."
 

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.413
And he said,
"Bad air,

00:40:52.413 --> 00:40:54.210
bad air, it smells.
 

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.297
What a horrible
modernity--right?--where we

00:40:57.297 --> 00:41:01.563
become all mediocre and all the
same, and we cannot fulfill

00:41:01.563 --> 00:41:02.740
ourselves."
 

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.550
Right?
 

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:09.704
And then, well this is very
nice poetry--provocative,

00:41:09.704 --> 00:41:12.190
but think about it.
 

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:16.677
"There is nothing strange
about the fact that the lambs

00:41:16.677 --> 00:41:20.329
bear a grudge towards the large
birds of prey.

00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:24.608
But there is no reason to blame
the large birds of prey for

00:41:24.608 --> 00:41:26.599
carrying the little lamb.
 

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:29.809
Well the lambs say to each
other, these birds,

00:41:29.809 --> 00:41:30.949
prey are evil.
 

00:41:30.949 --> 00:41:35.318
And whoever is least like the
bird of prey and most like the

00:41:35.318 --> 00:41:37.983
opposite, like us,
the lamb, is good,

00:41:37.983 --> 00:41:39.094
isn't it?"
 

00:41:39.094 --> 00:41:39.909
Right?
 

00:41:39.909 --> 00:41:43.512
"Those who dominate is bad
and those we are the suffering

00:41:43.512 --> 00:41:45.050
are the good ones."
 

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.840
Well the bad--yeah,
the bird of prey responds.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:56.268
"We don't bear any grudge
at all towards those good lambs.

00:41:56.268 --> 00:41:58.213
In fact, we love them."
 

00:41:58.213 --> 00:41:58.699
Right?
 

00:41:58.699 --> 00:42:03.797
"Nothing can taste better
than a tender lamb."

00:42:03.797 --> 00:42:04.539
Right?
 

00:42:04.539 --> 00:42:07.760
Well, as I said,
this is disturbing.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.715
But I think the point is,
what he's calling for.

00:42:10.715 --> 00:42:11.219
Right?
 

00:42:11.219 --> 00:42:13.250
The self-fulfillment of
individual.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.744
And the--and his desperation
that in the modern world we

00:42:16.744 --> 00:42:18.460
cannot fulfill ourselves.
 

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.534
And here it comes:
"The workshop ideals-

00:42:21.534 --> 00:42:24.329
where the ideals are
fabricated."

00:42:24.329 --> 00:42:29.789
He said in this workshop lies
are turning weakness into

00:42:29.789 --> 00:42:31.510
accomplishment.
 

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:36.402
Impotence;
not to retaliate is being

00:42:36.402 --> 00:42:40.670
turned into goodness,
though you are only impotent,

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.936
and you're beginning to
construct your impotence as

00:42:44.936 --> 00:42:45.789
good.
 

00:42:45.789 --> 00:42:47.289
You are not good.
 

00:42:47.289 --> 00:42:48.750
You can't do anything about it.
 

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:53.277
And submission to people what
you hate, that's what you call

00:42:53.277 --> 00:42:56.143
obedience;
not because they- you really

00:42:56.143 --> 00:43:00.170
accept their superiority,
because you are afraid of them.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:03.170
And then you construct a good
notion out of this.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.409
Obedience, this is a good word.
 

00:43:05.409 --> 00:43:09.416
Well he said there are- they
are also talking,

00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:13.958
"love your enemy,
and they are sweat while they

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:15.739
are saying so."
 

00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:16.719
Right?
 

00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:18.250
It's a big lie.
 

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:19.780
You don't love your enemy.
 

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.250
You hate the guts out of them.
 

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.538
You say you love them,
and meanwhile you sweat.

00:43:24.538 --> 00:43:25.110
Right?
 

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:26.780
That's what he said.
 

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:31.277
You know, this is the
workshop--right?--in which the

00:43:31.277 --> 00:43:33.130
ideals are created.
 

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:37.829
This is where they call it the
triumph of justice.

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:40.820
You don't hate your enemy.
 

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.869
Oh no, no, no.
 

00:43:43.869 --> 00:43:46.610
You hate injustice. Right?
 

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:50.710
You create your enemy as
unjust--right?--and unfair;

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.442
rather think,
well this is my enemy and he's

00:43:53.442 --> 00:43:54.650
stronger than me.
 

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:58.971
Well therefore,
he said, "the workshops

00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:04.599
where ideals are fabricated,
they stink of lies."

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:07.489
And again "bad air,
bad air,"

00:44:07.489 --> 00:44:12.027
get out of here;
clean air, let's talk truth,

00:44:12.027 --> 00:44:13.159
not lies.
 

00:44:13.159 --> 00:44:15.119
That's the point.
 

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:17.347
And Übermensch is
the one which will.

00:44:17.347 --> 00:44:17.719
Right?
 

00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:20.393
Because the
Übermensch is--he

00:44:20.393 --> 00:44:22.932
said, well good and bad,
good and evil,

00:44:22.932 --> 00:44:24.268
fought together.
 

00:44:24.268 --> 00:44:27.280
Now the good and evil is
dominating us.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.679
Well the Renaissance was
brilliant.

00:44:30.679 --> 00:44:33.280
It was
reconstructing--right?--our

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.619
classical idea.
 

00:44:34.619 --> 00:44:38.061
But then came again,
he said, "the Judeo

00:44:38.061 --> 00:44:39.940
triumphed again."
 

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.869
Again, be careful;
not anti-Semitic, no.

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:46.110
It's again more against
Lutherans than against Jews.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:50.335
He said, "Thanks to the
basically proletarian German and

00:44:50.335 --> 00:44:53.577
English ressentiment
movement called the

00:44:53.577 --> 00:44:54.844
Reformation."
 

00:44:54.844 --> 00:44:55.619
Right?
 

00:44:55.619 --> 00:44:57.449
That's his real enemy here.
 

00:44:57.449 --> 00:44:59.199
And he said,
"Well the

00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:02.900
Über"--we don't have
time to labor on this.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.420
So very briefly origins of
punishment.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:13.179
Well we have to forget;
forget is we have to suppress

00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:18.451
memories which were bad,
and in order to suppress,

00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:22.110
well there is mnemo-techniques.
 

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:26.554
That means that we are
actually--pain is the most

00:45:26.554 --> 00:45:31.927
useful way how we forget what we
have to forget--we have to

00:45:31.927 --> 00:45:32.760
remember.
 

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.780
Right?
 

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.751
He said, "These Germans,
the nation of thinker,

00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:41.030
made a memory for themselves
with dreadful methods,

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:47.327
stoning, breaking on wheels,
raping apart and trampling to

00:45:47.327 --> 00:45:50.199
death wild horses."
 

00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:54.119
All right, I have to finish it
now here.

00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:57.320
But I hope you get sort of the
bottom line.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:57.929
Right?
 

00:45:57.929 --> 00:46:01.527
The bottom line is have a
radical critical theory,

00:46:01.527 --> 00:46:05.713
which does not need ultimate
value to be critical of false

00:46:05.713 --> 00:46:07.110
ideas and lies.
 

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:11.072
Get truth;
and the ideal is the person who

00:46:11.072 --> 00:46:16.530
can fulfill itself in the world,
and conquer the world as such.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:22.000

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.923
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:00:03.923 --> 00:00:08.414
here's the plan for today.
I want to do one last foray

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:12.154
into relativity theory.
And this is going to be a

00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:16.173
tricky one, so I hope you're all
feeling mentally strong this

00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:18.119
morning.
If not, we--gosh,

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.250
we should have ordered coffee
for everyone.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.240
And, in so doing,
I want to introduce one key

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.228
concept, and also answer at
least three of the questions

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:35.760
that you guys have asked before
in a more--in more depth,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.330
and also relate the whole thing
back to black holes.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.960
And then, having done that,
we'll have some more questions.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.176
And then, having done that,
I want to get back to

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:47.869
astronomy;
that is to say,

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:51.516
to things in the sky that
actually manifest these

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:54.948
relativistic effects.
So, that's where we're going

00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:57.184
today.
And along the way,

00:00:57.184 --> 00:01:03.195
as I said, we'll deal with some
of the questions you've been

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:11.250
asking in a deeper kind of way.
In particular--so, questions.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310
Watch out for the answers to
these questions.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.526
Somebody asked,
"What's special about special

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:20.840
relativity, and what's general
about general relativity?"

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.970
How do they relate?

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.434
So, we'll come back to that one.
Somebody also asked,

00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:34.747
"Why use the speed of light to
convert time into space and vice

00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:39.290
versa, to get them in the same
coordinate system?"

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:51.940
So, why use c to convert
time to space and vice versa?

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.144
And then, also,
there was the question of,

00:01:54.144 --> 00:01:56.779
you know, "What is the
mathematical formulation of

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:02.143
general relativity?"
So, how to express general

00:02:02.143 --> 00:02:07.940
relativity in some kind of
equation.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.757
And we'll get to the key
equation, which is something

00:02:14.757 --> 00:02:17.342
called a metric,
for general relativity,

00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:21.788
and then we're going to stop.
Because to go on from there is

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:26.229
fairly heavy calculus and we're
just not going to do that.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.409
But I want to get at least that
far.

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:35.040
Okay, so let's go back to
special relativity for a minute.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:45.100
So, special relativity.
Flat space-time, no gravity.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.646
And you'll recall what happens.
As you get close to the speed

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:55.518
of light, all sorts of things
that you thought were kind of

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:57.400
constant and properties of
objects,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.728
like mass and length and
duration, and duration of time,

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:03.534
and things like that,
all start to get weird and

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:06.738
change.
So, length, time,

00:03:06.738 --> 00:03:15.205
mass, all these things,
vary with the velocity of the

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:21.239
person doing the measuring.
And so, you could ask the

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.400
question, is there anything that
doesn't vary?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.320
Is there anything that's an
invariant?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.865
And the answer is, yes.
There are some things that

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:35.390
don't vary.
So, some things are invariant.

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.551
And Einstein actually said
later in his career that it's

00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:47.295
actually the invariants that are
important, not the things that

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:49.830
change.
And so, he should have called

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.569
his theory invariant theory
instead of relativity theory.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.139
Think of what that would have
done to pop philosophy.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.176
Instead of saying,
"everything is relative," all

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:02.729
this stuff, you would have had
the exact same theory.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.590
You would have called it
invariance theory.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.324
And the pop philosophy
interpretation of this would be,

00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:12.371
"some things never change."
And it would have been a whole

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:15.773
different concept in three in
the morning dorm room

00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:18.930
conversations.
Okay, so some things are

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.175
invariant, what things?
Now, let me first give you a

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:27.504
little bit of a metaphor and
then come back to how this

00:04:27.504 --> 00:04:31.675
really works in space-time.
Supposing you're just looking

00:04:31.675 --> 00:04:35.083
at an xy-coordinate
system and you have two points

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:39.626
in a two-dimensional space.
So, here's a point and here's a

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:42.399
point.
Now, if you arrange for some

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:45.868
kind of coordinate
system--here's a coordinate

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.823
system.
This is x,

00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:52.139
this is y--and you ask
how far apart these points are.

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.310
Well, you can do that--let's
see.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.699
They're separated in x
by this amount here,

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.895
which we'll call delta [Δ]
x. And they're separated

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:10.860
in y by this amount here,
and that's Δ y.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.301
But of course,
those quantities depend on the

00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:17.430
orientation of your coordinate
system.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.189
If I now take this coordinate
system and I shift it like this,

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.060
now it's going to be totally
different.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:36.000
Now I'm going to have x
look like this and I'm going to

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.449
have y,
Δ y look like that.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.399
So Δ y has gotten a
whole lot smaller.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.069
Δ x has gotten a whole
lot bigger.

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.680
And all I did was twist the
coordinate system.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.523
Yeah?
Student: [Inaudible.]

00:05:52.523 --> 00:05:54.122
Professor Charles
Bailyn: You still get the

00:05:54.122 --> 00:05:55.231
same distance,
thank you very much,

00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:58.129
that's exactly right.
The distance is the invariant.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.789
The x-coordinate and the
y-coordinate,

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.970
those vary with the coordinate
system, but the distance is the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.800
same.
That's exactly the point.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.019
And so, the quantity--let me
summarize this.

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:19.310
For points on a 2-D space,
Δ x varies.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.425
Δ y varies.
But there is a quantity that is

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:31.544
invariant and that is--well,
let's call it (Δ x^(2))

00:06:31.544 --> 00:06:36.495
+ (Δ y^(2)),
which is the distance squared,

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:39.960
(Δ D^(2)).
And this is invariant.

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.780
It doesn't matter which way you
twist things around,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.329
that will--that quantity will
remain the same.

00:06:51.329 --> 00:07:05.310
So, now, imagine that you've
got events in space-time.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:12.400
So an event in space-time has
three spatial coordinates and

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.707
one time coordinate.
So, it's basically a point in a

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:24.770
four-dimensional space.
And as your velocity changes,

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:32.990
the distance and time also
change.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.170
That's the equivalent of
rotating the coordinate system.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.719
But there is something that
doesn't change,

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:45.608
and let me write that down.
This is usually given the Greek

00:07:45.608 --> 00:07:48.269
letter Tau [T]
squared.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:54.588
And this is equal to (Δ
x^(2)) + (Δ

00:07:54.588 --> 00:08:01.494
y^(2)) + (Δ
Z^(2)) - c^(2)

00:08:01.494 --> 00:08:06.840
(ΔT)^(2).
And this is invariant.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:16.562
This is an invariant interval,
sometimes called proper

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.852
distance.
And as you change your

00:08:19.852 --> 00:08:23.038
velocity--as the space,
as the mass,

00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:26.769
as the time all change--this
quantity,

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:29.968
describing the separation of
two events--so,

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.389
this describes the separation
of two events,

00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:36.530
that quantity changes--doesn't
change.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.051
That quantity is invariant.
Okay, so now,

00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:43.909
this answers one of the
questions that was asked before.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.527
Why does one use c^(2)
or c to transform the

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:52.820
space coordinate into the time
coordinate and back?

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.535
It's because you need the
c^(2) out here in order

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.624
to make this invariant.
If you're calculating the

00:08:58.624 --> 00:09:01.666
distance, if you use
x^(2) plus 1/2

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:05.970
y^(2) or some other
constant times y^(2),

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.549
you're not going to get
something that's invariant.

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:11.060
And it's only when you use the
c, here,

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.850
that you end up with something
that's invariant.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.723
And so, if you think about
these as representing the four

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:21.192
coordinates of the system,
it's clear this one coordinate

00:09:21.192 --> 00:09:24.102
is x, one is y,
one is z, just as you

00:09:24.102 --> 00:09:27.061
would expect.
And then, there's this other

00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:30.427
coordinate, which is c
times T,

00:09:30.427 --> 00:09:35.399
but it's negative so it has to
be times the square root of -1.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:38.413
So, the four coordinates in
space-time can be thought of as

00:09:38.413 --> 00:09:41.634
x, y, Z and i cT,
if you want to think of it that

00:09:41.634 --> 00:09:43.646
way.
And the time coordinate is

00:09:43.646 --> 00:09:47.083
imaginary, because when you
square it, you have to end up

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:51.580
with a negative number.
Don't worry about the details

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.542
of that.
But the presence of the

00:09:54.542 --> 00:09:59.206
c^(2) here is why you
have to use c, in

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:03.690
particular, to get from time to
space and back.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.021
And that's necessary because
this is the thing that doesn't

00:10:08.021 --> 00:10:10.840
vary with velocity.
All right.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.700
So, this is actually kind of a
weird expression.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.655
Because unlike the distance
between two points--and you'll

00:10:18.655 --> 00:10:21.500
notice, these three terms put
together,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.370
that's just the distance
squared, ordinarily,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.720
but that is not invariant
anymore,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.960
because there's this other term
here, which can vary.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.638
Unlike the distance,
this doesn't have to be

00:10:32.638 --> 00:10:35.550
positive.
You've got three different

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:41.100
cases here.
This interval can be zero for

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.487
different points.
In ordinary distance it can

00:10:45.487 --> 00:10:47.888
only be zero if the two points
are the same,

00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:50.178
but this can be zero for
different points,

00:10:50.178 --> 00:10:52.527
for different events.
It can be zero,

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.160
it can be negative,
and it can be positive.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.100
So, what does that mean?
What happens when it's zero?

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:06.240
So, if the interval is zero,
that means that the distance

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.830
between the events in
light-years,

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:16.950
for example,
is equal to the time separation

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:23.926
in years, because
that's--because this term has to

00:11:23.926 --> 00:11:29.620
be exactly equal to that term
there,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.009
in order for them to subtract
out and get zero.

00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:35.689
And the c^(2) converts
from light-years to years and

00:11:35.689 --> 00:11:38.490
back again.
And so, what does that mean?

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:46.946
That means if you emit a photon
at one event,

00:11:46.946 --> 00:11:55.979
that same photon can,
if it's going in the right

00:11:55.979 --> 00:12:04.820
direction, be present at the
second event.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.696
So, if you ride along with
light you'll see both--you'll

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:12.800
participate in both these
events.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.460
So, you sit at event one.
You flash a light.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.031
You ride along with the
expanding light waves from that

00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:25.263
event and you get to something
one light-year away,

00:12:25.263 --> 00:12:29.653
exactly a year later.
And so, if the second event is

00:12:29.653 --> 00:12:34.049
one light-year away in distance
and a year later in time,

00:12:34.049 --> 00:12:37.539
that same photon will be
present at the second event,

00:12:37.539 --> 00:12:41.429
as at the first event.
So, things that have one of

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:45.990
these intervals of zero are
separated by an appropriate

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:51.225
amount so that the same ray of
light can participate in both of

00:12:51.225 --> 00:12:52.070
them.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:03.049
So, if the interval--let's keep
that up there for a minute.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:13.549
If the interval is negative,
what does that mean?

00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:19.050
The distance is less than the
light travel time.

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:27.680
So, the photon is already past
the second event.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.432
So, if you were to emit a ray
of light at event number one,

00:13:39.432 --> 00:13:45.570
it would have passed the second
event by the time it occurred.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.700
The photon has already gone by.
And similarly,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:14:00.220
if the interval is positive,
then the light photon hasn't

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:08.889
reached event two--hasn't yet
reached event two.

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:14.114
Now, this is important,
because this means that you

00:14:14.114 --> 00:14:19.130
can't communicate from event one
to event two.

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:28.065
So, if you're at event two,
you don't know what happened at

00:14:28.065 --> 00:14:30.934
event one.
Because even if you'd sent out

00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:34.308
a signal, a radio signal or
whatever, it would not have

00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:37.370
reached you by the time event
two takes place.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.899
So you can't communicate from
event one to event two.

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:46.354
And similarly,
you can't travel from event one

00:14:46.354 --> 00:14:52.535
and reach event two,
because you'd have to go faster

00:14:52.535 --> 00:14:57.019
than the speed of light to do
it.

00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:00.397
These kinds of intervals,
these negative intervals,

00:15:00.397 --> 00:15:04.316
these are called time-like,
because the time term is larger

00:15:04.316 --> 00:15:09.252
than the distance turn.
And these kinds of intervals

00:15:09.252 --> 00:15:15.483
are called space-like intervals.
And you can only travel or

00:15:15.483 --> 00:15:19.230
communicate over time-like
intervals.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.256
Yes?
Student: What are these

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:24.442
so-called events?
Professor Charles

00:15:24.442 --> 00:15:26.668
Bailyn: So,
they're events--you can think

00:15:26.668 --> 00:15:29.989
of them as points in space-time.
So, they have a particular

00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:32.970
position in space and a
particular point in time.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.961
So, they can be described by
four numbers,

00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:37.390
three spatial coordinates and a
time coordinate.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.442
They can be anything.
You know, turning on a light,

00:15:41.442 --> 00:15:45.446
doing anything you want to do.
Receiving a photon,

00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:47.956
whatever it is.
But they are points in a

00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:51.581
four-dimensional space-time and
therefore require four numbers

00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:52.770
to describe them.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.491
And you can only get from one
to another if they're separated

00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:02.758
from a time-like,
that is to say,

00:16:02.758 --> 00:16:04.530
a negative, interval.

00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:20.532
Okay, so this expression,
which I'll write down again,

00:16:20.532 --> 00:16:26.470
this is called a metric.

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:35.550
And the particular metric that
I've written down here is the

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.828
metric for flat space.
Because remember,

00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:39.856
this is special relativity.
There's no masses,

00:16:39.856 --> 00:16:42.080
no curvature of space,
none of that stuff,

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.681
yet.
This is the metric for flat

00:16:46.681 --> 00:16:52.545
space with no mass present.
And there are many other

00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:55.466
metrics possible.
Any time you add mass or do

00:16:55.466 --> 00:16:58.076
other things,
you get different kinds of

00:16:58.076 --> 00:17:00.620
metrics more complicated than
this.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.458
So, what's special about
special relativity is that you

00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:08.581
use the metric appropriate for
flat space as opposed to the

00:17:08.581 --> 00:17:12.562
many other different kinds of
metrics that you can use in

00:17:12.562 --> 00:17:16.335
general relativity,
which has a much more general

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:18.940
form for the metric.
I should say,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:24.386
you can also write this down.
You can write down the spatial

00:17:24.386 --> 00:17:28.910
terms here in polar coordinates.
Remember polar coordinates?

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.201
Polar coordinates,
you describe the position in

00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:34.089
space, instead of with x,
y, Z, you describe it with

00:17:34.089 --> 00:17:36.680
a radius, a distance from zero,
and some angles.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.289
And it turns out,
that's convenient to do so.

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:43.020
Let me write this down in polar
coordinates, or in polar.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.290
That's an r.
Let me write that explicitly.

00:17:56.869 --> 00:18:00.710
This is an Omega,
that's some angle.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.000
And then the T thing
remains the same.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.562
And I've pulled a little bit of
a notational fast one on you

00:18:09.562 --> 00:18:11.833
here.
I've gone away from the deltas

00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:14.380
and I've written these down as
d.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.619
This is the differential
d.

00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:19.311
Those of you who have taken
some calculus will remember

00:18:19.311 --> 00:18:21.641
this.
If this were a calculus-based

00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:25.809
course I would explain why I did
that, but I'm not going to.

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:29.529
So, just allow me this slight
of hand, here.

00:18:29.529 --> 00:18:31.860
For technical reasons,
these have to be differential.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.460
Yes?
Student: But you do need

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.183
a second angle term for the
[inaudible]

00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:35.135
Professor Charles
Bailyn: I do need a second

00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:36.789
angle term.
I should say--good point.

00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:40.640
You need two angles and a
distance in three space.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.613
This capital Omega here is
actually--Omega squared is

00:18:46.613 --> 00:18:49.830
actually sin θ,
d θ,

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.769
d φ,
which is the correct form.

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:57.176
And so you could write out both
terms here, but in fact,

00:18:57.176 --> 00:18:59.789
this one isn't going to change.
But you're absolutely right.

00:18:59.789 --> 00:19:04.020
In principle,
you need two angles.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:09.089
Okay, why have I done this?
Excellent question.

00:19:09.089 --> 00:19:12.270
I ask myself a question at this
point.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.670
Where am I going?
What I want to do now is write

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:22.375
down a different metric.
A metric that actually involves

00:19:22.375 --> 00:19:26.549
curved space and the presence of
a mass.

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:28.860
And this is something called
the Schwarzschild metric.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.100
Remember Schwarzschild?
He had a radius.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:44.018
And this is the appropriate
metric for the presence of a

00:19:44.018 --> 00:19:51.947
single point mass at the center
of the coordinate system,

00:19:51.947 --> 00:19:56.954
at R = 0.
That's why I put it into polar

00:19:56.954 --> 00:20:01.012
coordinates, because the
presence of the mass is going to

00:20:01.012 --> 00:20:04.781
change the space-time as a
function of distance--from

00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:07.970
radial distance from where the
mass is.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.485
And so, it's much more
convenient for the Schwarzschild

00:20:11.485 --> 00:20:14.220
metric to use this in polar
coordinates.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.140
So, here's the Schwarzschild
metric, (d T^(2)),

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.730
that's the--this is the
interval,

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:28.115
is equal to (dR) / (1 -
R_s /

00:20:28.115 --> 00:20:31.451
R).
So, that's just like the flat

00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:34.490
term, except with something in
the denominator there.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.460
Plus R^(2),
d Omega squared,

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.849
that's just like the flat
metric.

00:20:41.849 --> 00:20:48.056
And then the--whoops this had
better be - c^(2) (1 -

00:20:48.056 --> 00:20:53.619
R_S / R)
(cT) ^(2).

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:57.414
Where R_S is
the Schwarzschild radius,

00:20:57.414 --> 00:21:00.505
which we've had before,
which is 2GM /

00:21:00.505 --> 00:21:03.961
c^(2).
Okay, so this is just like the

00:21:03.961 --> 00:21:08.428
flat metric with two exceptions.
It's got a term in the radial

00:21:08.428 --> 00:21:11.839
part of this 1 -
R_S / R.

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:17.391
And it's got that same term,
but this time in the numerator,

00:21:17.391 --> 00:21:22.951
in the time term here.
Now, what do you do with

00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:28.280
this--with such an equation?
Well, we've done--in special

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.769
relativity, we've dealt with
these kinds of things.

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:33.359
What you do is you start taking
the limiting cases.

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:36.561
You say, okay,
what happens when it's getting

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:39.400
really close to flat on the one
hand,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.440
and what's happening when it's
getting very seriously

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:48.490
relativistic on the other hand?
So let's do that.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:53.568
If R_S /
R goes to zero,

00:21:53.568 --> 00:21:58.430
then the metric turns into the
flat metric.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.974
Because if R_S
/ R = 0,

00:22:00.974 --> 00:22:04.460
this term disappears because
it's 1 - 0, and it just cancels.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.600
This term disappears and you
recover the flat metric.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:13.060
This happens in two cases.
If the mass goes to zero,

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.795
then R_S goes
to zero, and you recover the

00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:22.135
flat metric.
Or if R gets really big,

00:22:22.135 --> 00:22:27.059
then R_S /
R goes to zero,

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:31.279
and again, you recover the flat
metric.

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:36.097
So in--there are two situations
where Schwarzschild metric

00:22:36.097 --> 00:22:40.069
blends smoothly into the
ordinary flat space.

00:22:40.069 --> 00:22:43.609
One is if the mass is zero,
that's not surprising.

00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:46.440
If the mass is zero then
space-time isn't curved.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.382
Or alternatively,
if you're really,

00:22:48.382 --> 00:22:51.059
really far away from the mass.
If R is much,

00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:52.800
much bigger than the
Schwarzschild radius,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.170
you're way out there.
There's no gravitational effect.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.960
Space-time remains flat.
So, these the--this is the

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.519
limiting case where you recover
special relativity.

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:08.759
Now, the other case is when
R gets close to the

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:12.039
Schwarzschild radius and
approaches it.

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:15.857
So then 1 -
R_S / R

00:23:15.857 --> 00:23:20.038
approaches zero,
because these two are going to

00:23:20.038 --> 00:23:25.020
get closer and closer together.
1 - 1 = 0.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.590
What happens then?
So, this is now,

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.263
first of all--in physical terms
you're getting really close to

00:23:30.263 --> 00:23:32.991
the Schwarzschild radius.
So now, what happens to the

00:23:32.991 --> 00:23:38.549
metric if you do that?
The dR term gets very

00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:46.039
big, because it's got a zero in
the denominator.

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:53.568
The dT term gets really
small, because it's got that

00:23:53.568 --> 00:23:59.540
thing that's going to zero in
the numerator.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.130
Fine.
What does that mean?

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.610
Well, remember,
this is the negative term.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.599
This is the positive term.
So the positive term is getting

00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:09.838
really, really big.
The negative term is getting

00:24:09.838 --> 00:24:14.461
really, really small.
And that means that all

00:24:14.461 --> 00:24:21.370
intervals are gradually becoming
space-like.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:29.694
What do I mean by that?
Well, the negative term is

00:24:29.694 --> 00:24:32.196
getting small.
One of the positive terms is

00:24:32.196 --> 00:24:35.233
getting big.
So the sum of those tends to be

00:24:35.233 --> 00:24:37.178
positive.
It's becoming more and more

00:24:37.178 --> 00:24:39.307
positive.
Positive intervals are these

00:24:39.307 --> 00:24:42.243
space-like intervals,
and you can't communicate or

00:24:42.243 --> 00:24:44.519
travel across space-like
intervals.

00:24:44.519 --> 00:24:48.020
When you get all the way to the
Schwarzschild radius,

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.049
this blows up completely,
becomes infinite.

00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:54.090
This becomes zero,
and there are no time-like

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.811
intervals.
There are no time-like

00:24:56.811 --> 00:25:00.250
intervals that cross the event
horizon.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:05.050
That's why you can't get out.
This takes us back to the basic

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:12.606
principle of black holes.
So, cannot communicate or

00:25:12.606 --> 00:25:20.190
travel over space-like
intervals.

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:30.627
And so, you can't cross
R equals the

00:25:30.627 --> 00:25:35.630
Schwarzschild radius.
All right.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.477
Let's see.
Let me write the thing down

00:25:39.477 --> 00:25:40.290
again, here, for you.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.369
Okay, so that's the metric
we're worrying about here.

00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:07.101
And now, let's think about what
happens inside the Schwarzschild

00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:09.387
radius.
R less than

00:26:09.387 --> 00:26:12.240
R_Sch
warzschild.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.964
That means the dR term
becomes negative,

00:26:17.964 --> 00:26:23.690
because 1 -
R_S / R.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.996
If R_S is
bigger than R then this

00:26:26.996 --> 00:26:29.299
term is--this term is greater
than 1,

00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:31.829
and this whole thing is less
than zero, and the signs change.

00:26:31.829 --> 00:26:38.170
And the dT term becomes
positive.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.175
So, that means this is the
time-like term,

00:26:42.175 --> 00:26:45.789
where this one is the
space-like term,

00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:48.330
because it's positive.

00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:56.052
That's what I meant three,
four, five lectures ago,

00:26:56.052 --> 00:26:59.390
when I said that inside the
Schwarzschild radius,

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.514
when you're inside the
Schwarzschild radius,

00:27:01.514 --> 00:27:04.121
space and time reverse.
It's a sign change in the

00:27:04.121 --> 00:27:06.069
metric.
That's what it means.

00:27:06.069 --> 00:27:15.850
And you can only travel along
negative intervals.

00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:22.898
That means you have to move in
R the same way outside

00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:26.589
the Schwarzschild radius you
have to move in T.

00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:29.830
But notice it's only the radial
term.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:33.316
This term hasn't changed.
You could go around in circles,

00:27:33.316 --> 00:27:36.329
but whatever you do,
you still have to move,

00:27:36.329 --> 00:27:39.663
as it turns out,
toward the center of the thing

00:27:39.663 --> 00:27:43.359
in radius, in order to have a
time-like interval.

00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:51.400
And so, motion in R is
required for inside the

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:59.132
Schwarzschild radius,
whereas motion in T is

00:27:59.132 --> 00:28:02.380
required outside.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.510
So space and time reverse.

00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:18.834
All of which is very nice,
but I've left out

00:28:18.834 --> 00:28:21.670
something--I've left something
out,

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.994
which is the fact--inside the
event horizon,

00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:26.589
how do you know that this is
still the metric?

00:28:26.589 --> 00:28:29.682
One could invent some function
that looks just like this

00:28:29.682 --> 00:28:31.650
outside the Schwarzschild
radius,

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.195
but then looks like something
else inside the Schwarzschild

00:28:34.195 --> 00:28:36.171
radius.
And because no communication

00:28:36.171 --> 00:28:39.729
across the Schwarzschild radius
is possible, you'd never be able

00:28:39.729 --> 00:28:42.997
to test it.
And so, this is how one gets

00:28:42.997 --> 00:28:46.359
away with doing non-testable
physics.

00:28:46.359 --> 00:28:48.338
You say, well,
we're just going to assume that

00:28:48.338 --> 00:28:50.660
the metric hasn't changed.
Why should it change?

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.809
After all, it's the same
equation.

00:28:52.809 --> 00:28:56.397
But inside the Schwarzschild
radius you can't actually test

00:28:56.397 --> 00:28:58.218
this.
Outside the Schwarzschild

00:28:58.218 --> 00:29:01.217
radius you can test it,
because you see whether objects

00:29:01.217 --> 00:29:04.660
behave as they ought to behave
in a space that's curved in this

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.159
particular way--in a space-time
that's curved in this particular

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:12.226
way.
And so, this is what I meant

00:29:12.226 --> 00:29:17.782
by, five classes ago,
by saying space and time

00:29:17.782 --> 00:29:23.380
reverse.
These two quantities reverse

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.502
their signs.
All right, that's as far as we

00:29:27.502 --> 00:29:31.880
can go, because the next thing
that one would want to do is,

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.424
you find out what the equation
is for finding out how things

00:29:36.424 --> 00:29:39.119
move in these curved
space-times.

00:29:39.119 --> 00:29:41.716
Basically, you remember,
things go from one event to

00:29:41.716 --> 00:29:44.973
another in the shortest possible
path, that's the equivalent of a

00:29:44.973 --> 00:29:47.582
straight line.
That means if you integrate

00:29:47.582 --> 00:29:50.090
over dT,
it has to be minimized.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.370
So, you minimize this integral.
That tells you how things move.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.059
We're not going to do that.
Sighs of relief?

00:29:57.059 --> 00:30:03.190
And because--for obvious
reasons.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.215
So, this is as far as we can
go, just to write down the

00:30:06.215 --> 00:30:08.792
metric here.
So, let me know pause for

00:30:08.792 --> 00:30:12.808
questions, and then we're going
to go back and talk about

00:30:12.808 --> 00:30:17.182
astronomy--about things in the
sky that actually exhibit these

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:19.960
relativistic behaviors.
Yes?

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.873
Student: You were
talking before about intervals,

00:30:21.873 --> 00:30:23.300
and how all the intervals are
negative.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.738
What exactly is one interval?
[Inaudible]

00:30:26.738 --> 00:30:27.640
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Sorry?

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.670
Student: What exactly is
one interval?

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:30.742
[Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:30:30.742 --> 00:30:31.779
Bailyn: Oh,
an interval.

00:30:31.779 --> 00:30:34.891
So, what I'm doing is I'm
taking two events,

00:30:34.891 --> 00:30:38.508
each of which is one of these
points in space-time,

00:30:38.508 --> 00:30:41.691
and I'm asking,
"What is the interval between

00:30:41.691 --> 00:30:44.208
them?"
What is--you could measure the

00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:47.121
distance between them,
you could measure the time from

00:30:47.121 --> 00:30:49.475
one event to another.
But as it turns out,

00:30:49.475 --> 00:30:52.294
those aren't invariants.
And so, there's this other

00:30:52.294 --> 00:30:54.579
thing, the metric,
which is invariant.

00:30:54.579 --> 00:30:59.669
And so, that's a measure--an
invariant measure of how

00:30:59.669 --> 00:31:04.908
separated these two events are.
So, you take two events and you

00:31:04.908 --> 00:31:07.564
ask yourself,
"Are they separated by zero,

00:31:07.564 --> 00:31:10.609
a positive quantity or a
negative quantity?"

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:13.337
Where by separation,
I mean, this curious

00:31:13.337 --> 00:31:16.460
combination of space and time.
Student: So the

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.769
intervals are before the metric,
before the interval?

00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:20.560
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.367
it's an interval--think of--let
me go back to the analogy I

00:31:23.367 --> 00:31:26.048
started with.
Here's--in two spatial

00:31:26.048 --> 00:31:30.779
dimensions, x and
x, here are two points.

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:33.039
And depending on how I set the
coordinate system up,

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:35.609
the x-distance--the
x difference between them

00:31:35.609 --> 00:31:38.089
and the y difference
between them can change,

00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:41.089
but the distance is always the
same.

00:31:41.089 --> 00:31:46.878
So now, I've got two points
with--each with and x,

00:31:46.878 --> 00:31:53.112
y, Z and a T. And
depending on how I change my

00:31:53.112 --> 00:31:59.346
velocity or my coordinates the
particular values of x,

00:31:59.346 --> 00:32:03.799
y, Z,
and T can change,

00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:09.698
but this (Δ T^(2)) defined
by--I'm in flat space now,

00:32:09.698 --> 00:32:12.495
right?
This separation,

00:32:12.495 --> 00:32:15.667
this interval between those two
points, this is the

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:19.601
invariant--in the same way that
the distance between two points

00:32:19.601 --> 00:32:22.773
doesn't change if you change the
coordinate system,

00:32:22.773 --> 00:32:26.579
even though the x and
y separations do.

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:28.815
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:32:28.815 --> 00:32:31.985
Bailyn: It gives you--no.
Well, it combines these four

00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:34.590
things into one thing that
doesn't change.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:40.099
That's the point.
Yes?

00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:44.156
Student: Is there a way
that you can--like as an

00:32:44.156 --> 00:32:48.663
interval from zero basically
describes two events that appear

00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:50.995
simultaneous?
Professor Charles

00:32:50.995 --> 00:32:52.789
Bailyn: As the--yeah
exactly.

00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:54.680
Student: So,
is that then collapsed into a

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.530
Newtonian theory,
things with two--things appear

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.932
simultaneously if they happen at
the same time -- Professor

00:32:58.932 --> 00:33:02.620
Charles Bailyn: Well okay.
So, there's two different ways

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.799
things can appear,
quote, simultaneously.

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:11.051
One is if they are two
different events in space-time

00:33:11.051 --> 00:33:15.759
and light travels from one,
and they're exactly separated

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:19.564
by--the amount of time between
them is the same as the distance

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:22.509
between them if you multiply by
c^(2).

00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:26.451
They can also appear
simultaneously if they are the

00:33:26.451 --> 00:33:30.519
same point as each other.
And then everything goes to

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:33.714
zero.
And it's only in that second

00:33:33.714 --> 00:33:39.737
case that it--that the Newtonian
concept of simultaneous kicks

00:33:39.737 --> 00:33:42.972
in.
Simultaneous is usually taken

00:33:42.972 --> 00:33:46.799
to mean that the time separation
is zero.

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:48.891
Two things happen
simultaneously when they happen

00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:51.932
at the same time.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:33:51.932 --> 00:33:55.949
Professor Charles
Bailyn: On Earth the--the

00:33:55.949 --> 00:34:00.866
distances and the velocities and
the gravitational fields are

00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:05.374
never so strong that you have
any trouble--that the Δ T

00:34:05.374 --> 00:34:11.030
changes significantly depending
on what your point of view is.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.630
So, in our everyday life,
we have a strong concept of

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.733
simultaneity.
It's two things that happen at

00:34:15.733 --> 00:34:17.335
the same time.
Turns out, though,

00:34:17.335 --> 00:34:20.267
that if you move at close to
the speed--if you observe two

00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:23.301
events to be at the same time
and I'm moving at close to the

00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:25.747
speed of light,
I don't observe those two

00:34:25.747 --> 00:34:28.300
events at the same time,
even though you do.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.929
And so, at that point,
you have to abandon the

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:36.768
Newtonian concept that Δ T = 0
tells you that two events are

00:34:36.768 --> 00:34:39.748
simultaneous.
And the whole concept of

00:34:39.748 --> 00:34:42.430
simultaneity takes on a
different task.

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:46.826
Other questions, yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:34:46.826 --> 00:34:48.480
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.072
so these units can be any units
of length you like provided

00:34:51.072 --> 00:34:52.860
that--any units of length you
like,

00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:01.730
provided the time units are
related to it by c.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.936
That is to say,
if your distance units are

00:35:03.936 --> 00:35:06.519
light-years, your time units
have to be years.

00:35:06.519 --> 00:35:10.767
If your distance units are
meters, then your time units are

00:35:10.767 --> 00:35:14.210
some kind of meter,
light-meter-second thing.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.879
And so, the only restriction on
the units you use is that the

00:35:17.879 --> 00:35:21.671
time and the space units have to
be convertible into each other

00:35:21.671 --> 00:35:24.318
through c^(2).
Or, alternatively,

00:35:24.318 --> 00:35:27.734
another way of saying it is,
you use any units you like,

00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:31.710
and as long as you express the
speed of light in those units.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.959
If you have a time unit and a
space unit, if you're in--if

00:35:34.959 --> 00:35:38.094
you're measuring your space in
furlongs and your time in

00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:41.284
fortnights,
as long as your c is in

00:35:41.284 --> 00:35:45.410
furlongs per fortnight,
it's going to come out okay.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.980
So, as long as it's convertible.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.445
Other questions?
Okay, if you don't get all the

00:35:56.445 --> 00:35:59.974
details and nuance of what I've
said this period,

00:35:59.974 --> 00:36:04.396
don't worry too much about it.
I just wanted to get the

00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:08.390
concept of the metric out there
and show you how,

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:13.382
if you look at that equation
these concepts of space and time

00:36:13.382 --> 00:36:15.544
reversing,
and so forth,

00:36:15.544 --> 00:36:19.413
have a kind of mathematical
consequence, as well as just

00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:21.409
spouting words.
And if you get,

00:36:21.409 --> 00:36:23.450
sort of, the basic outline of
the argument,

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:24.180
that's fine.

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:38.789
Okay, back to actual things in
actual--that actually exist.

00:36:38.789 --> 00:36:46.647
So, what I want to talk about
now is evidence for general

00:36:46.647 --> 00:36:54.223
relativity from astronomical
objects--real black holes,

00:36:54.223 --> 00:36:58.273
stuff like that.
Now, one of the curious things

00:36:58.273 --> 00:37:00.760
about this is that when Einstein
thought all this stuff up,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.577
he thought it up from basically
these philosophical concerns

00:37:04.577 --> 00:37:08.460
about mass – that the inertial
mass turned out to always be

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.610
equal to the gravitational mass.
Why would that be?

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.415
And there wasn't,
when he thought it up,

00:37:16.415 --> 00:37:22.269
a great body of evidence for
his theory in the real world.

00:37:22.269 --> 00:37:24.920
This is in contrast to special
relativity.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.720
Special relativity,
there were all these

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.659
experiments that needed to be
explained.

00:37:28.659 --> 00:37:31.570
General relativity--very,
very little.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:35.230
In fact, when Einstein first
put forward the theory in 1917,

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.704
there was only one thing that
had ever been observed that

00:37:38.704 --> 00:37:41.929
actually showed an effect of
general relativity,

00:37:41.929 --> 00:37:46.273
and that was the orbit of
Mercury, which you're reading

00:37:46.273 --> 00:37:49.170
about for this week's problem
set.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:55.922
So, just going back a little
bit, in the nineteenth century,

00:37:55.922 --> 00:38:02.789
people had observed the orbits
of planets in great detail.

00:38:02.789 --> 00:38:06.262
And they found out that two of
the planets were moving in ways

00:38:06.262 --> 00:38:09.583
they couldn't quite explain.
There were very small

00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:12.579
deviations from the predictions
orbit.

00:38:12.579 --> 00:38:15.916
In particular,
the orbit of Uranus was a

00:38:15.916 --> 00:38:19.980
little weird.
And that was quickly explained

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:24.243
by the presence of an
unknown--hitherto unknown

00:38:24.243 --> 00:38:26.964
planet,
which was also exerting a

00:38:26.964 --> 00:38:31.270
gravitational force on Uranus
and pulling it out of the orbit

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.533
that it should have been,
by a very small amount,

00:38:34.533 --> 00:38:37.911
because the gravitational force
of another planet is very small

00:38:37.911 --> 00:38:40.608
compared to that of the Sun.
But by the middle of the

00:38:40.608 --> 00:38:42.750
nineteenth century they could
measure such things.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:48.380
And they therefore predicted
the presence of this other

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:53.280
planet, of Neptune,
and they calculated where it

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.593
should be.
And some guy went off and

00:38:57.593 --> 00:39:03.984
observed in that spot and found
it--predicted presence of

00:39:03.984 --> 00:39:09.920
Neptune and discovered it in the
predicted place.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.926
Big triumph!
Everybody--if they had had

00:39:12.926 --> 00:39:16.030
Nobel Prizes back then,
they would have won it for

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.575
this, for sure.
And then, there was a whole big

00:39:18.575 --> 00:39:21.296
kerfuffle because they couldn't
decide whether the French guy

00:39:21.296 --> 00:39:23.699
had done it before the English
guy, or vice versa.

00:39:23.699 --> 00:39:27.786
And they argued with each other
for decades about who gets the

00:39:27.786 --> 00:39:29.800
credit.
But in scientific terms,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.444
there was a prediction,
and the prediction was

00:39:32.444 --> 00:39:34.070
verified.
Excellent news.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:42.266
Now, there was also a problem
with the orbit of Mercury--also

00:39:42.266 --> 00:39:47.730
perturbed, from what you would
expect.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.989
And having had this big triumph
in the Outer Solar System,

00:39:49.989 --> 00:39:51.693
they figured,
well, we know how to deal with

00:39:51.693 --> 00:39:54.073
this.
There's got to be another

00:39:54.073 --> 00:39:58.363
planet in there.
So, they predict the presence

00:39:58.363 --> 00:40:03.990
of a planet called Vulcan,
which then disappears from the

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:10.119
scientific literature until it's
resurrected by Star Trek.

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:13.963
But Vulcan--the concept of
Vulcan was, this was going to be

00:40:13.963 --> 00:40:17.210
a planet that's closer to the
Sun than Mercury.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.567
That's why they haven't been
able to find it,

00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:22.460
because it's too near the Sun
to be easily observed.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.532
And it's going to pull on
Mercury in such a way that it's

00:40:26.532 --> 00:40:30.750
going to explain the problems
with the orbit of Mercury.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:36.753
And so, they then look for
Vulcan in the predicted place,

00:40:36.753 --> 00:40:38.790
and they find it.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:47.257
And then somebody else finds it.
And they find it many times and

00:40:47.257 --> 00:40:51.170
each time it's different--all
different.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.289
And it gradually becomes clear
that everybody's fooling

00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:56.485
themselves.
That there's no--this is a

00:40:56.485 --> 00:40:58.710
really hard observation to make,
right?

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.510
Because the thing is right near
to the Sun.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:06.820
And so, it turns out that all
of this is wrong.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.650
None of these observations are
really any good.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:18.219
It's not repeatable--so,
not really.

00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:21.111
And so, after some attempts to
find Vulcan--and then,

00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:24.280
they rule out the presence of
Vulcan in various places.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.707
So, then the people calculating
the orbits have to go back and

00:41:26.707 --> 00:41:28.099
say, well, if Vulcan isn't
there,

00:41:28.099 --> 00:41:31.635
maybe there are two or three
planets combining together to do

00:41:31.635 --> 00:41:34.639
the thing that we originally
wanted Vulcan to do.

00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:36.840
This gets sort out of control
after a while.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.339
And at a certain point,
people just kind of give up,

00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:41.447
and they say,
well, it's a great big mystery

00:41:41.447 --> 00:41:43.982
about Mercury.
And after a while,

00:41:43.982 --> 00:41:48.389
after that, people kind of even
stopped caring.

00:41:48.389 --> 00:41:50.750
Because, you know,
we know Newton's laws worked.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.788
This is just some weirdness
about Mercury that we don't

00:41:53.788 --> 00:42:00.355
understand.
And then, when Einstein creates

00:42:00.355 --> 00:42:10.331
his new theory of gravity,
he then computes in the new

00:42:10.331 --> 00:42:15.790
theory of Mercury's orbit.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.943
And he now gets something that
agrees with the observations,

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:30.180
without the need for a new
planet.

00:42:36.289 --> 00:42:39.553
And so, what happened was,
Mercury's orbit is a little

00:42:39.553 --> 00:42:42.139
different from the Newtonian
prediction.

00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:44.845
The general relativity
prediction is a little bit

00:42:44.845 --> 00:42:48.113
different in just the same way
to explain this problem that

00:42:48.113 --> 00:42:51.889
people had been trying to solve
for fifty years unsuccessfully.

00:42:51.889 --> 00:42:57.211
And so, this was the first
verification,

00:42:57.211 --> 00:43:03.760
empirical verification,
of general relativity.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.999
And if you think about it,
you would expect that Mercury

00:43:06.999 --> 00:43:09.650
would be the place you would
find this out.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.532
For Mercury,
R_S /

00:43:12.532 --> 00:43:16.940
R, this is the
Schwarzschild radius of the Sun

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.010
because that's what's doing the
gravitating,

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.790
is the biggest in the Solar
System.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.712
Because the R,
the distance from Mercury to

00:43:30.712 --> 00:43:33.450
the Sun, is the smallest of any
of the planets in the Solar

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:37.713
System.
And so, the relativistic

00:43:37.713 --> 00:43:47.539
effects, the general relativity
effects, are relatively large.

00:43:47.539 --> 00:43:50.891
But, you know,
this is still a really small

00:43:50.891 --> 00:43:52.714
number.
This is 3 kilometers,

00:43:52.714 --> 00:43:54.659
the Schwarzschild radius of the
Sun.

00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:56.340
Mercury is way out there
somewhere.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.611
So, even though this is the
most--this is the biggest

00:43:59.611 --> 00:44:03.323
relativistic effect in the Solar
System, it still isn't that

00:44:03.323 --> 00:44:06.489
huge.
Let me just remind you what

00:44:06.489 --> 00:44:09.380
this effect is.
Here's the Sun.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.775
Mercury's going around the Sun.
And it's going around in a

00:44:13.775 --> 00:44:17.723
slightly elliptical orbit.
I'm going to draw a very

00:44:17.723 --> 00:44:20.235
elliptical orbit,
here, but it's really not that

00:44:20.235 --> 00:44:22.373
big.
And there's a point in the

00:44:22.373 --> 00:44:24.949
orbit where it is closest to the
Sun.

00:44:24.949 --> 00:44:28.159
That point is called the
perihelion.

00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:34.389
"Peri" for close,
"helios" for Sun--of Mercury.

00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:37.314
And in the Newtonian theory,
you should have exactly the

00:44:37.314 --> 00:44:40.276
same orbit every time.
You should come back and the

00:44:40.276 --> 00:44:44.190
perihelion should be in the same
place in each successive orbit.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.539
The orbit doesn't move or
doesn't change.

00:44:46.539 --> 00:44:50.519
But, in general relativity,
the perihelion moves.

00:44:50.519 --> 00:44:54.559
So, after a while the
perihelion will be here.

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:58.786
The whole orbit will kind of
tip this way,

00:44:58.786 --> 00:45:02.799
and it'll look like this.
So, this is the perihelion

00:45:02.799 --> 00:45:03.130
later.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.208
And it looks like that.
And the angle which the

00:45:13.208 --> 00:45:17.170
perihelion makes with the Sun
has changed.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:21.220
This angle is called the angle
of the perihelion.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:24.627
And this precesses.
So this is called the

00:45:24.627 --> 00:45:27.610
precession of the perihelion.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.030
And it's measured in some angle
per time.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:37.141
Because the question is,
"How long does it take for the

00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:39.619
perihelion to precess across
some angle?"

00:45:39.619 --> 00:45:44.690
And the key number for Mercury
is 43 arc seconds.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.650
Remember arc seconds?
Those are small angles.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:55.486
Per century – a really small
movement, but something that can

00:45:55.486 --> 00:46:00.760
be measured, and had been
measured.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.923
And it's not surprising that
this is small,

00:46:02.923 --> 00:46:05.860
because the relativistic
effects are going to be small,

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.395
because the Schwarzschild
radius of the Sun is really

00:46:08.395 --> 00:46:10.980
small compared to the size of
the orbit of Mercury.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:18.490
But this was observed before
Einstein made his theory.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:21.730
Nobody understood it.
Einstein came up with his

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.221
theory.
It turned out it predicted a

00:46:24.221 --> 00:46:27.744
precession of the perihelion in
a way that Newton didn't,

00:46:27.744 --> 00:46:30.450
and it turned out to work out
precisely.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.764
So, that was good.
And at the time Einstein

00:46:33.764 --> 00:46:37.593
published the theory,
this was the only piece of

00:46:37.593 --> 00:46:44.221
evidence that it was correct.
Pretty small empirical

00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:52.365
verification.
And so, let's just write down

00:46:52.365 --> 00:46:59.351
the fable, here.
This is Einstein and the

00:46:59.351 --> 00:47:05.846
precession of the perihelion.
And there are two versions of

00:47:05.846 --> 00:47:08.115
the moral.
Sometimes in textbooks,

00:47:08.115 --> 00:47:11.110
you know, they make a big deal
out of this.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.232
They say, oh,
there was this terrible problem

00:47:13.232 --> 00:47:15.211
with Mercury,
and then Einstein came along

00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:17.719
with this great new theory,
solved that problem.

00:47:17.719 --> 00:47:20.558
In the same way that they say,
there was this terrible problem

00:47:20.558 --> 00:47:23.210
with the speed of light being
constant from all frames,

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.838
and Einstein came along with
special relativity and solved

00:47:25.838 --> 00:47:29.590
that problem.
That's a misreading of history.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:31.619
This was a by-product of
Einstein.

00:47:31.619 --> 00:47:35.409
It wasn't that there was a
problem with the data and he

00:47:35.409 --> 00:47:39.760
went out to try and fix the
theory to conform with the data.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:46.366
There was very little data.
So, the moral here is aesthetic

00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:53.112
considerations,
aesthetic--perhaps you want to

00:47:53.112 --> 00:48:00.802
call this philosophical,
considerations can lead to a

00:48:00.802 --> 00:48:08.088
good new theory because he
didn't really do it to explain

00:48:08.088 --> 00:48:10.581
the data.
This is, however,

00:48:10.581 --> 00:48:13.652
the only time I can think of
where this actually happened

00:48:13.652 --> 00:48:16.922
this way.
Every other major advance in

00:48:16.922 --> 00:48:22.520
science came about because the
observers or the experimenters

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:30.369
had a problem--but not G.R.
Only for general relativity.

00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:33.339
Now, subsequent to that,
between 1917,

00:48:33.339 --> 00:48:36.869
when this theory was
promulgated, and now,

00:48:36.869 --> 00:48:44.491
there have been a variety of
tests of general relativity

00:48:44.491 --> 00:48:49.654
using astronomical objects.
You always have to use

00:48:49.654 --> 00:48:52.878
astronomical--or almost always
have to use astronomical objects

00:48:52.878 --> 00:48:55.210
to test this,
because you need really strong

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.559
gravitational fields,
and it's hard to produce a

00:48:57.559 --> 00:49:00.309
really strong gravitational
field in the laboratory.

00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:03.220
You're kind of limited to what
the Earth provides you with,

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.780
and that isn't such a strong
gravitational field.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.239
We computed,
at some point,

00:49:07.239 --> 00:49:09.933
the Schwarzschild radius of the
Earth, R /

00:49:09.933 --> 00:49:12.628
R_Sch
warzschild is the relevant

00:49:12.628 --> 00:49:14.954
quantity,
and it's really small from the

00:49:14.954 --> 00:49:17.437
Earth's gravitational field.
So, it's hard to see these

00:49:17.437 --> 00:49:19.532
things.
So, all these tests tend to be

00:49:19.532 --> 00:49:23.329
astronomical in nature.
Since then, a variety of tests

00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:28.010
of G.R., and the punch line is
that it passes all of them.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:32.400
G.R. is still a good theory.
There's no contradictory data.

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.293
But the tests still aren't as
strong as you might have hoped

00:49:36.293 --> 00:49:40.120
they would be.
And we'll talk about some of

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.386
those on Thursday.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.428
Professor David Blight:
In some ways,

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:04.820
the greatest witnesses--there
are many,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.162
many witnesses of the coming of
the Civil War--what caused it,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:15.330
what's percolating from beneath
the society of the South,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.130
we've looked at,
and the society of the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.130
North--and in so many ways,
of course,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.938
the greatest witnesses--and
their stories have only been

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:31.346
with us, in a serious,
robust way, for the past couple

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:35.599
of decades or so,
a few decades--are those of the

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:40.023
slaves themselves.
If it was somehow all about

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:45.623
them--and in varying kind of
ironic ways folks on both sides

00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:50.370
will say that--if it is somehow
all about them,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.076
what did they think?
This week you're reading the

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:58.010
greatest of the slave
narratives.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.637
Frederick Douglass's first
autobiography,

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:01.590
published in 1845,
is, I still would maintain,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.114
the greatest of the slave
narratives, certainly in a

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:09.131
literary sense.
He was an almost mystically

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.920
brilliant writer,
for one so young.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.930
He first drafted this when he
was 26.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.159
He escaped from slavery when he
was 20-years-old.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.470
You'll find out in the text how
he learned his literacy.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.092
He learned it first from his
white mistress,

00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:30.293
Miss Sophia,
who became like an angelic

00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:35.599
mother-figure to him until she
took language away from him.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:40.905
The book is full of metaphor,
it is full of one kind of tale

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:46.121
and story after another that
Douglass shapes into telling a

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:49.050
free story.
Telling a free story,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.266
as the great literary critic of
this genre, Bill Andrews,

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:56.845
has put it.
For a fugitive slave to emerge

00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:02.231
in the Northern states--for that
matter a fugitive slave who goes

00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:05.400
to Britain,
like Olaudah Equiano did,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.106
African born,
or so we still think,

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:12.087
and writes his story in
Britain--but for a fugitive

00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:17.102
slave to write his or her story
and publish it in English in the

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:21.720
western world was to say:
"I'm a person of letters,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.093
I am somebody,
I have a history,

00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:30.970
I am free, but I am not free
until you let me write,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.461
and I will make myself free,
if I must, by telling you who I

00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:39.447
am."
When a fugitive slave could go

00:02:39.447 --> 00:02:43.250
to England and hold up his book
in front of huge

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.619
audiences--Douglass spoke in
London at one point before

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:51.179
10,000 people,
in 1846--and he could hold his

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:55.387
little book up in his hand,
he could probably at that

00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:59.190
moment feel freer than he'd ever
felt,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.019
because he could actually say
"this is who I am,

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.789
I'm not a manufactured
identity,

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.349
I'm not what you necessarily
want me to be.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.099
I won't talk the way you expect
me to talk.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.730
I won't scratch my head when I
tell my story."

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.193
But what a story.
When I was a fledgling graduate

00:03:22.193 --> 00:03:26.529
student, not knowing what I was
doing and writing a dissertation

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:30.009
on Frederick Douglass,
a couple--a few decades ago,

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:34.030
a new book had come out called
Young Frederick Douglass.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.440
It was a wonderful study of
Douglass's youth.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.319
It had been written by a
journalist, so he was hard to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.573
find--he wasn't an academic.
This is pre-email,

00:03:45.573 --> 00:03:49.910
pre-Google, pre-lots of things.
I wrote to his publisher,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.216
Johns Hopkins University Press,
and said can you give me a

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:56.289
phone number for Dick
Preston--Dickson Preston was his

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:58.652
name.
They said, "yes,

00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:03.007
here's his phone number."
I was in Washington,

00:04:03.007 --> 00:04:07.370
D.C., doing research;
called him.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.948
He lived on the Eastern Shore
of Maryland, that much I knew,

00:04:10.948 --> 00:04:13.009
which is where Douglass grew
up.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.211
I didn't know much about Dick
except that he had written this

00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:18.399
extraordinary book on Douglass's
youth.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.551
In fact, it was Preston who
actually discovered Douglass's

00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:24.549
birth date.
Douglass was one year younger

00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:27.850
than he ever knew--wouldn't that
be cool?

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.410
I'll take a year back any time
at this point.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.374
Called him, he said,
"Yeah, come on out to the

00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:36.338
Eastern Shore,
meet me in the Easton Community

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:39.764
College parking lot at 9
a.m."--on whatever Wednesday

00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:43.717
morning it was in July--"I'll
give you a tour of the sites of

00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:47.117
Douglass's youth."
And it was one of the most

00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:50.865
extraordinary days of my life.
I folded myself into his

00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:54.988
station wagon and we drove back
roads all over the Eastern

00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:57.832
Shore.
He took me for a walk through a

00:04:57.832 --> 00:05:00.095
muddy cornfield,
as I believe it,

00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:03.769
out to the back lot of a field,
to a bend in Tuckahoe Creek,

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:05.537
and he said,
"This is where Douglass was

00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:08.223
born.
Here's where Grandmother

00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:12.731
Betsy's cabin was."
Then he took me down all kinds

00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.902
of back roads,
then we ended up at the

00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:18.288
Freeland Farm.
If you've read the

00:05:18.288 --> 00:05:21.023
Narrative you know the
Freeland Farm was--among

00:05:21.023 --> 00:05:23.810
Douglass's three or four masters
he had as a youth,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.899
Freeland he admired the most or
respected the most.

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.472
And then he said,
"Do you want to see Covey's

00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:34.016
Farm?"
Edward Covey,

00:05:34.016 --> 00:05:38.820
the so-called slave-breaker
Douglass had been hired out to,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.003
or sent to,
by his master Thomas Auld,

00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:46.128
when he was a 17-year-old,
quite rebellious and rather

00:05:46.128 --> 00:05:48.827
uncontrollable teenager.
I said, "Sure,

00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:51.154
show me Covey's farm."
Then back roads again that I

00:05:51.154 --> 00:05:53.410
couldn't find today if my life
depended on it.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.588
We get out of a car and,
in my memory,

00:05:56.588 --> 00:06:01.142
we stepped over a fencepost,
we walked out this ridge,

00:06:01.142 --> 00:06:05.180
and Dick said something like
"turn around."

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.389
And there they were.
He hadn't made it up.

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.944
In the narrative,
if you've read far enough,

00:06:14.944 --> 00:06:17.439
if you've read to page 83 in my
edition,

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:20.936
you've encountered the most
beautiful metaphor in

00:06:20.936 --> 00:06:24.569
anti-slavery literature.
It's Douglass's metaphor of the

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.598
white sailing ships on the
Chesapeake that he would see

00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:29.730
from Covey's farm for eight
months,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.300
and he would try to dream and
imagine his way onto their

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.360
decks, their "gallant decks",
as he called them.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.518
And I realized that day
sometimes metaphor is not just a

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:45.683
metaphor.
"Our house stood within a few

00:06:45.683 --> 00:06:48.751
rods of the Chesapeake
Bay"--this is Douglass's

00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:52.819
description--"whose broad bosom
was ever white with sails from

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.620
every quarter of the habitable
globe.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.893
Those beautiful vessels robed
in purest white,

00:06:58.893 --> 00:07:02.893
so delightful to the eye of
freemen"--don't you wish you

00:07:02.893 --> 00:07:07.039
could write like this when
you're 26?--"were to me so many

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.624
shrouded ghosts,
to terrify and torment me with

00:07:10.624 --> 00:07:12.939
thoughts of my wretched
condition.

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.501
I have often,
in the deep stillness of a

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.458
summer Sabbath,
stood all alone upon the lofty

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:21.019
banks of that noble bay and
traced,

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:25.328
with saddened heart and tearful
eye, the countless number of

00:07:25.328 --> 00:07:28.250
sails moving off to the mighty
ocean."

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.612
Douglass was fond of adjectives.
"The sight of these always

00:07:32.612 --> 00:07:35.962
affected me powerfully.
My thoughts would compel

00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:39.956
utterance, and there with no
audience but the Almighty I

00:07:39.956 --> 00:07:43.950
would pour out my soul's
complaint"--a phrase right from

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.709
the Book of Job--"in my rude
way,

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:51.490
with an apostrophe to the
moving multitudes of ships."

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.109
And when you read this,
note what he does then,

00:07:56.109 --> 00:08:00.528
he puts his own teenage voice,
or his memory,

00:08:00.528 --> 00:08:05.649
in quotation marks,
and he speaks to the ships.

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:08.310
"You are loose from your
moorings and are free.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.870
I am fast in my chains and am a
slave.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.548
You move merrily before the
gentle gale and I sadly before

00:08:14.548 --> 00:08:17.894
the bloody whip.
You are freedom's swift winged

00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:20.370
angels that fly around the
world.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.209
I am confined in bands of iron.
Oh that I were free.

00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:28.146
Oh that I were on one of your
gallant decks and under your

00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:31.570
protecting wing.
But alas, betwixt me and you

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.340
the turbid waters roll.
Go on, go on.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.340
Oh that I could also go."
And he still goes on for

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.218
another paragraph,
milking, if you like,

00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:47.760
the sailing ship metaphor for
all it's worth.

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:55.810
How many of us--perhaps all of
us, I think everybody,

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:00.816
has their own Chesapeake.
It may be every morning when

00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:04.686
you have to go to class.
We all have our own Chesapeake

00:09:04.686 --> 00:09:07.947
Bays we've looked out on and
wondered "wouldn't I rather be

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:11.779
there?"
Or "how can I get out of here?"

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:17.769
Or "is there a sailing ship
that will liberate me?"

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:23.309
Telling a free story is what
the slave narratives were about.

00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:28.187
They were acts of telling that
in some ways made the former

00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:32.559
slave almost literally free by
an act of language.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:37.909
Language itself to a former
slave who could write was a form

00:09:37.909 --> 00:09:43.009
of liberation.
We tend to take it for granted

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:46.660
today, these books,
language.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.395
Okay, abolitionism, its roots.
Reformers, the barriers they

00:09:52.395 --> 00:09:54.684
faced.
I'm going to run through this

00:09:54.684 --> 00:09:57.313
with some speed,
and then the stages in the

00:09:57.313 --> 00:10:01.068
development of an anti-slavery
impulse--let's call it that to

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:04.041
begin with.
It begins with this idea of

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:06.962
colonization,
colonizing African-American

00:10:06.962 --> 00:10:11.269
freed people or former slaves
outside the United States;

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:14.795
an idea that never lost its
kind of beguiling hold on the

00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:18.005
American imagination,
even well after the Civil War,

00:10:18.005 --> 00:10:18.950
ironically.

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:25.233
And then on to a more
radicalized form of anti-slavery

00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:27.962
thinking and action,
exemplified especially by

00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:32.326
William Lloyd Garrison,
but by a host of other black

00:10:32.326 --> 00:10:36.902
and white abolitionists.
And then I want to work you at

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:39.686
least to the story,
in myth and reality,

00:10:39.686 --> 00:10:43.758
of the Underground Railroad,
since it is so much a part of

00:10:43.758 --> 00:10:47.476
our imagination of this story,
and it would at least I hope

00:10:47.476 --> 00:10:50.938
take us to the point of
understanding why that Fugitive

00:10:50.938 --> 00:10:53.468
Slave Act,
that we'll hear about on

00:10:53.468 --> 00:10:57.062
Thursday and into next week,
that Fugitive--that Federal

00:10:57.062 --> 00:10:59.480
Fugitive Slave Act passed in
1850,

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.306
in the compromise of 1850 that
flowed out of the Mexican

00:11:04.306 --> 00:11:08.870
War--why that Fugitive Slave Act
was so pertinent,

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.277
so divisive,
so significant,

00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:16.537
in the kinds of ways Americans
were beginning to divide over

00:11:16.537 --> 00:11:20.550
the future of free labor and
slave labor,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.784
whatever.
They may have thought about

00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:26.620
African-Americans as their
neighbors.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.300
But permit me to use Emerson
again, at least briefly.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.169
This idea of reform.
I mentioned last time that--and

00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:39.115
sort of ended there--that in
American History we've had at

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:43.540
least four major reform eras or
waves of reform.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.110
And certainly this is the first.
In Antebellum America from the

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:52.654
1820s through the 1850s all
kinds of reform ferment came to

00:11:52.654 --> 00:11:55.471
the surface.
Sometimes that was against

00:11:55.471 --> 00:11:59.347
flogging in the Navy.
Sometimes it was in utopian

00:11:59.347 --> 00:12:04.912
experiments and communities.
Sometimes that was in Women's

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:07.436
Rights.
Sometimes that was in

00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:12.039
Temperance, which was by
far--that is the anti-alcohol,

00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:16.429
anti-booze, anti-demon rum
movement--Temperance was by far

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:21.049
the most widespread American
reform movement in pre-Civil War

00:12:21.049 --> 00:12:23.908
times.
It was probably the only major

00:12:23.908 --> 00:12:27.110
reform movement that got a hold
in the South.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:32.563
Personal reform of some sort
was something that that Southern

00:12:32.563 --> 00:12:36.200
society we looked at--a slave
society,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.553
a very hierarchical
society--certain kinds of

00:12:39.553 --> 00:12:43.974
personal reform that dealt with
personal piety and behavior

00:12:43.974 --> 00:12:49.197
could take hold in the South;
broader social reforms that

00:12:49.197 --> 00:12:53.910
would challenge the social
order--not so much.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.336
But listen to Emerson.
In his essay called "Man the

00:12:58.336 --> 00:13:01.570
Reformer"--and think about our
own times.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.600
"What is man born for?"
said Emerson.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.240
"What is man born for but to be
a reformer?"

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.629
Now he may be right or wrong
about this, you can decide.

00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:18.627
"A re-maker of what man has
made, a renouncer of lies,

00:13:18.627 --> 00:13:23.134
a restorer of truth and good,
imitating that great

00:13:23.134 --> 00:13:27.727
Nature"--note the metaphor
here--"which embosoms us all and

00:13:27.727 --> 00:13:32.400
which sleeps no moment on an old
past but every hour repairs

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.056
herself,
yielding us every morning a new

00:13:37.056 --> 00:13:41.970
day, and with every pulsation a
new life.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.428
Let him renounce everything
which is not true to him,

00:13:45.428 --> 00:13:49.220
and put all his practices back
on their first thoughts,

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:55.019
and do nothing for which he has
not the whole world for his

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:58.378
reason."
Emerson is arguing,

00:13:58.378 --> 00:14:03.468
right or wrong,
that you are a reformer by

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:08.936
nature.
Nature recreates itself daily

00:14:08.936 --> 00:14:18.059
and so do humans.
Is he right?

00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:21.486
Call home tonight to your
parents and say--you're a

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:24.707
Senior--"I've decided what I'm
going to do, Dad,

00:14:24.707 --> 00:14:26.900
I'm going to be a reformer."

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:36.310
If I were your parent I'd say,
"Of what?

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:43.040
For why?
Do they pay you for that?

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.620
Will it be safe?

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:55.120
Who you been talking to?
A what?"

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:55.780
"I'm gonna be a reformer."

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.791
This was an age,
though, by the 1830s,

00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:07.522
for a small group--and rest
assured abolitionists,

00:15:07.522 --> 00:15:11.769
in particular,
were never a large group.

00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:14.112
They probably were
never--excuse me,

00:15:14.112 --> 00:15:17.259
I was in Montana on the weekend
giving lectures,

00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:20.740
and the mountains were gorgeous
but it was cold.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:26.133
Anyway, abolitionists were
never, even at their peak of

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:30.904
organizational action,
were never more than probably,

00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:34.466
probably at most,
15% of the population of the

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:38.146
Northern states.
Now in some communities they

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:42.811
might be larger--upstate New
York, parts of Massachusetts and

00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:47.009
Connecticut or New
Hampshire--always a small group.

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:51.152
But like most vociferous and,
eventually, highly

00:15:51.152 --> 00:15:56.440
organized--operating by the
printing press--reform groups,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.630
their significance is much
greater than their numbers.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:06.283
Now, what were they up against?
Real quickly let me run through

00:16:06.283 --> 00:16:10.527
these.
I may have begun here last time

00:16:10.527 --> 00:16:14.428
and had to stop.
The American abolitionists,

00:16:14.428 --> 00:16:18.166
or anybody concerned about
slavery--let's just take the

00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:21.926
slavery question--has to deal,
by the 1820s now,

00:16:21.926 --> 00:16:27.224
with the new generations being
born who did not experience the

00:16:27.224 --> 00:16:30.840
Revolution,
and they are inheriting now

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.375
this great experience of their
parents, the American

00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:38.122
Revolution.
But that revolution had at

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.510
least a twofold legacy.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.173
On the one hand,
it was an event that really

00:16:45.173 --> 00:16:47.451
ushered those great
Enlightenment ideas into the

00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:50.164
world that an anti-slavery
impulse in America is going to

00:16:50.164 --> 00:16:51.940
draw upon,
constantly.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.629
Black and white abolitionists,
they're all going to do it.

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:57.574
Those great Enlightenment
ideas--hostility to monarchy,

00:16:57.574 --> 00:17:00.817
the growth of Republicanism,
representative government,

00:17:00.817 --> 00:17:03.909
the faith in human reason,
the notion of individual

00:17:03.909 --> 00:17:06.993
liberty,
that you're born with certain

00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:10.279
natural rights.
These are revolutionary ideas.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.410
They hadn't worked them out yet
either.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.304
How about the right of
revolution, one of Jefferson's

00:17:14.304 --> 00:17:17.890
four first principles?
The doctrine of consent.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.253
Popular sovereignty--not a
brand new idea--it's all the way

00:17:21.253 --> 00:17:24.559
back there in the Epistles of
Paul and even before that in

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:28.443
certain kinds of writings.
But how many times had the

00:17:28.443 --> 00:17:32.813
world actually invented
governments truly based on the

00:17:32.813 --> 00:17:36.034
doctrine of consent?
And that fledgling idea of

00:17:36.034 --> 00:17:38.480
equality, human equality,
had been put in play.

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:45.726
But the other side of the
American Revolution is that it

00:17:45.726 --> 00:17:49.011
had also fostered in the South
the necessity of an

00:17:49.011 --> 00:17:51.759
intensification of slavery's
defense.

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:54.055
In many ways,
the success of the American

00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:57.268
Revolution and putting slavery
on the run in the Northern

00:17:57.268 --> 00:17:59.193
states,
where it was gradually

00:17:59.193 --> 00:18:02.076
abolished in every
Northern--immediately abolished

00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:05.722
in a few but gradually abolished
in most of the Northern States

00:18:05.722 --> 00:18:08.840
by the 1820s--the South now had
to have answers,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.222
it had to have justifications.
And we went through a lot of

00:18:12.222 --> 00:18:15.920
those defenses and
justifications the other day.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.441
This was what Edmund Morgan,
the great colonial revolution

00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:22.777
historian here at Yale for years
argued so brilliantly,

00:18:22.777 --> 00:18:25.552
over and over.
It was the American paradox,

00:18:25.552 --> 00:18:27.630
this great American
contradiction;

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:35.253
largest slave system in the
world being built by one of its

00:18:35.253 --> 00:18:37.490
first functioning,
thriving republics.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:47.243
Two, anybody trying to work
against slavery,

00:18:47.243 --> 00:18:51.740
even in the most gradual,
modest ways,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.400
by the 1820s and the 1830s,
has got to bump his head right

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.868
into what we might simply call
the sanctity of the U.S.

00:18:58.868 --> 00:19:03.232
Constitution.
The Constitution was revered in

00:19:03.232 --> 00:19:07.560
American society,
it was a sacred thing.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.316
And look what it was rooted in.
Now, Garrison's going to call

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:14.682
it a covenant with death,
a deal with the devil,

00:19:14.682 --> 00:19:17.690
because of its complicities in
slavery.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.508
But it's also rooted deeply in
Federalism and in what

00:19:21.508 --> 00:19:25.768
southerners and northerners
would practice as states rights

00:19:25.768 --> 00:19:30.468
doctrine--all that localism that
the Constitution was designed in

00:19:30.468 --> 00:19:33.480
Madison's genius to try to
control,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.282
hold together.
Then you take the three-fifths

00:19:38.282 --> 00:19:42.436
clause and the fugitive slave
clause and the postponing for 20

00:19:42.436 --> 00:19:46.590
years of any consideration of
the banning of the foreign slave

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.994
trade.
And you realize that the U.S.

00:19:49.994 --> 00:19:54.021
Constitution is morally
complicit in slavery,

00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:57.500
even though it never used the
word.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.015
Why did abolitionism in
America--or any kind of

00:20:01.015 --> 00:20:05.678
concern--let's just put it that
way--about slavery become more

00:20:05.678 --> 00:20:08.692
radical with time?
It is because,

00:20:08.692 --> 00:20:14.117
ultimately, an anti-slavery
movement in the United States,

00:20:14.117 --> 00:20:18.019
to succeed, had to become extra
legal.

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:20.520
Or, put another way,
it had to break the law.

00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:27.769
That's why law breaking is such
a central theme in Harriet

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:30.470
Beecher Stowe's great novel,
Uncle Tom's Cabin.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.436
And then, of course,
anti-slavery activists were up

00:20:33.436 --> 00:20:36.283
against the increasingly deep
defense of slavery,

00:20:36.283 --> 00:20:40.245
which we've already dealt with.
They were up against an

00:20:40.245 --> 00:20:45.246
increasingly highly organized
and widely written racial theory

00:20:45.246 --> 00:20:50.665
about black inferiority.
An anti-slavery impulse in the

00:20:50.665 --> 00:20:55.579
United States was an impulse,
a set of ideas,

00:20:55.579 --> 00:21:00.191
that eventually would have to
call for some form of social

00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:05.560
revolution, legal revolution,
and political revolution in a

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.464
society that did not want it.
And in a society where

00:21:10.464 --> 00:21:15.943
increasingly a tremendous amount
of wealth was of course staked

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:19.390
in slavery, a point we've also
made.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.221
Just a last thought on that.
Think today,

00:21:23.221 --> 00:21:26.615
just think around you,
think out of your box for a

00:21:26.615 --> 00:21:30.772
moment, of an issue in the world
of great concern that really

00:21:30.772 --> 00:21:33.269
affects you,
or most of us;

00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:36.619
for that matter the whole
bloody world.

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:44.178
How confident are you in
succeeding in solving it,

00:21:44.178 --> 00:21:49.109
in your lifetime?
World poverty,

00:21:49.109 --> 00:21:53.680
global warming,
take your pick.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:22:00.168
Racism, go end it.
To be an abolitionist in the

00:22:00.168 --> 00:22:03.438
1830s was to take on an issue
like this and say,

00:22:03.438 --> 00:22:06.568
"Well, you know,
maybe not in our lifetime but

00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:08.030
maybe sometime."

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.123
It doesn't mean they were
altruistic, I'm not sure there

00:22:15.123 --> 00:22:17.390
were any altruistic
abolitionists.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.380
As you'll see when you read
about them in Bruce Levine's

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.009
book or any other way we look at
them,

00:22:26.009 --> 00:22:29.637
they could be as egotistical
and as vane and as conflicted in

00:22:29.637 --> 00:22:33.084
their tactics and their methods
and their personalities as

00:22:33.084 --> 00:22:34.791
anybody.
Certainly William Lloyd

00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:36.840
Garrison was not an easy guy to
get along with.

00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:42.422
Now, as I mentioned earlier,
anti-slavery in America,

00:22:42.422 --> 00:22:44.509
though, takes stages,
it goes through periods,

00:22:44.509 --> 00:22:48.609
stages.
The first of these is this idea

00:22:48.609 --> 00:22:53.009
of colonizing black people
elsewhere.

00:22:53.009 --> 00:22:57.366
Now colonization,
as an idea, is not brand new by

00:22:57.366 --> 00:23:02.630
1816, when the American
Colonization Society was formed,

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.830
but it finally took hold in the
political soil of the United

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.750
States, in the wake of the War
of 1812.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.528
The American Colonization
Society was actually founded in

00:23:13.528 --> 00:23:14.809
the U.S.
capitol.

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:17.580
This thing had congressional
funding at first.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.635
It was actually founded by some
of the greatest statesmen in

00:23:22.635 --> 00:23:24.991
America at the time.
Henry Clay was there at the

00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:27.460
original meeting.
James Monroe;

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.910
John Marshall--Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court--and many

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.239
others, especially border state,
Upper South leaders,

00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:40.968
like Clay, from Kentucky,
the great Whig who will become

00:23:40.968 --> 00:23:45.009
the kind of father-figure of the
Whig Party.

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:48.024
Many of them slaveholders,
like Clay--owned about 60

00:23:48.024 --> 00:23:50.329
slaves on his hemp farms in
Kentucky.

00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:54.000
The idea here is that somehow
over time, in that America of

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.628
the future--that vast,
infinite, boundless America of

00:23:57.628 --> 00:24:01.986
the West--that eventually this
problem of slavery might have to

00:24:01.986 --> 00:24:02.830
be faced,

00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:09.069
but the way it could be faced
eventually is if you start

00:24:09.069 --> 00:24:12.240
gradually removing black people
from the United States.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.961
And you do it first with
volunteer freed people,

00:24:15.961 --> 00:24:18.360
free blacks.
They would be asked,

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.200
never coerced,
was the theory of the original

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.392
Colonization Society.
That Colonization Society,

00:24:24.392 --> 00:24:27.298
of course, is the
organization--it had a lot of

00:24:27.298 --> 00:24:31.359
money in its first decade or so.
It was such a beguiling idea.

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:35.730
It fit in so many ways this
generation.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.519
And it was actually the
revolutionary generation and the

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:43.239
immediate post-revolutionary
generation who really were

00:24:43.239 --> 00:24:46.960
infused with what you might call
a kind of Jeffersonian

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.887
idealism--or even a Madisonian
idealism--that somehow this

00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:54.881
America,
yes, it had problems--or as

00:24:54.881 --> 00:24:59.486
Jefferson said,
we got the wolf by the ears,

00:24:59.486 --> 00:25:03.212
with slavery;
you can't get off because the

00:25:03.212 --> 00:25:05.775
wolf will devour you;
but if you stay on you got to

00:25:05.775 --> 00:25:06.810
ride that damn wolf forever.

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:13.487
But he said that in
private--but this kind of

00:25:13.487 --> 00:25:16.472
Jeffersonian idealism that
somehow this grand American

00:25:16.472 --> 00:25:18.950
continent with its resources
physically,

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.114
and this grand American
Constitution,

00:25:21.114 --> 00:25:24.300
this great experiment,
would dissolve this problem,

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:30.059
especially if you helped it.
The American Colonization

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:34.075
Society founded the colony of
Liberia on the West Coast

00:25:34.075 --> 00:25:37.720
of--the nation of Liberia was
founded in 1820,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.580
'22, by the ACS,
the American Colonization

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:48.207
Society.
It would ship approximately

00:25:48.207 --> 00:25:53.417
1500 free African-Americans to
Liberia--1500,

00:25:53.417 --> 00:25:57.680
that's it--between 1821 and
1831,

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:03.280
and they would found its
capital at Monrovia,

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.029
named for James Monroe,
the United States President.

00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:07.585
Liberia today,
as you may know,

00:26:07.585 --> 00:26:10.230
has been through a vicious,
horrifying Civil War.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.748
It's a disaster.
It does have the only African

00:26:13.748 --> 00:26:17.271
woman president now.
It's a fascinating story of

00:26:17.271 --> 00:26:21.282
what's happening to Liberia.
But its roots are back here,

00:26:21.282 --> 00:26:24.989
in the impulse of white
Americans to remove black

00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:27.769
Americans from their native
soil.

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:30.809
Now some African-Americans
bought onto this.

00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:34.851
It's the immigration impulse,
go elsewhere,

00:26:34.851 --> 00:26:38.509
make a new start.
Some of them were even inspired

00:26:38.509 --> 00:26:41.933
by this idea of a return to an
ancestral homeland that they

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:47.142
knew so little about.
But colonization had all kinds

00:26:47.142 --> 00:26:50.050
of flaws at its roots.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.109
Well, we can call these flaws;
we can call these realities;

00:26:56.109 --> 00:26:58.250
we can call them whatever we
want.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.099
Colonization was essentially
rooted in these ideas.

00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:04.640
It was first these--or
assumptions we might call them.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.851
The first assumption was that
equality, racial equality in

00:27:07.851 --> 00:27:09.880
America was never going to
happen.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.684
Just start there,
is what the colonizationalists

00:27:12.684 --> 00:27:17.849
would argue.
"Be real--ain't gonna happen."

00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:21.230
There was a fear of the rising
free black population that had

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.950
really boomed in numbers in the
wake of the American Revolution,

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.702
with all the manumissions that
went on in the Upper South,

00:27:27.702 --> 00:27:30.599
and then the emancipations that
had occurred in the north,

00:27:30.599 --> 00:27:34.956
where the slave population of a
state like New York had been six

00:27:34.956 --> 00:27:38.888
or seven percent.
It was the fear now of the

00:27:38.888 --> 00:27:42.655
specter of slave insurrection.
There'd been the Gabriel

00:27:42.655 --> 00:27:43.569
Prosser plot in 1800 in
Richmond.

00:27:43.569 --> 00:27:47.853
There'd been the Denmark Vesey
insurrectionary plot in

00:27:47.853 --> 00:27:51.893
Charleston in 1822,
which brought a lot of converts

00:27:51.893 --> 00:27:55.902
to colonization.
And of course Nat Turner's

00:27:55.902 --> 00:28:01.424
bloodiest of all insurrections
in 1831 made colonization look

00:28:01.424 --> 00:28:04.829
pretty nice to a lot of
Americans.

00:28:04.829 --> 00:28:08.330
There was this idea too that
somehow colonization would be a

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.392
safety valve.
It might only remove five or

00:28:11.392 --> 00:28:16.046
ten percent of American free
blacks and slaves over say a few

00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:18.802
decades.
But even that five or ten

00:28:18.802 --> 00:28:22.910
percent, the theory was,
would ameliorate conditions in

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.391
the south,
it would begin to defuse this

00:28:26.391 --> 00:28:31.375
powder keg of a rising slave
population being fueled by the

00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:33.180
great cotton boom.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.781
And it had a kind of a strange
attractiveness,

00:28:40.781 --> 00:28:42.880
but mostly to white folks.

00:28:46.049 --> 00:28:50.048
It was roundly loathed by--make
no mistake--by a majority of

00:28:50.048 --> 00:28:53.640
free African-Americans in the
North or Upper South,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:29:01.533
and feared--to the extent they
even grasped the idea--by slaves

00:29:01.533 --> 00:29:06.236
in the Deep South.
But it was a gradualism that

00:29:06.236 --> 00:29:11.088
fueled the idea of colonization
and it was gradualism that a lot

00:29:11.088 --> 00:29:14.631
of America's first early
youthful generation of

00:29:14.631 --> 00:29:19.330
abolitionists thought might
still be the best way to go,

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.937
in the 1820s.
Gradual plans had been used,

00:29:22.937 --> 00:29:25.599
for example,
in states like Connecticut.

00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:28.999
Connecticut passed a law in the
late-1790s that said that every

00:29:28.999 --> 00:29:31.711
slave born in that state,
after that date,

00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:35.330
on his or her 21^(st) birthday
would be freed;

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:39.096
that's a very gradual plan.
Abraham Lincoln is still

00:29:39.096 --> 00:29:43.358
voicing this very kind of
gradual plan of emancipation at

00:29:43.358 --> 00:29:48.260
the outbreak of the Civil War.
He's still going to suggest it

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.963
to the states of Kentucky and
Delaware when he calls them in

00:29:52.963 --> 00:29:57.585
and asks those states in 1862 to
consider emancipation on a

00:29:57.585 --> 00:30:01.307
gradual plan.
And he would even compensate

00:30:01.307 --> 00:30:06.129
the slaveholders 600 bucks a
slave or--I forget exactly what

00:30:06.129 --> 00:30:08.666
the figure was.
And gradualism,

00:30:08.666 --> 00:30:12.365
many people have argued,
is kind of the American way,

00:30:12.365 --> 00:30:15.210
a long-term plan,
cushion the change.

00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:24.982
But, several things began to
happen, especially in the 1820s

00:30:24.982 --> 00:30:28.944
and into the 1830s that
radicalized anti-slavery

00:30:28.944 --> 00:30:34.051
thinkers in the United States.
And this is indeed the roots,

00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:37.375
if you like,
of a more radical abolitionism,

00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:41.935
the roots of what came to be
known among the Garrisonians as

00:30:41.935 --> 00:30:45.580
Immediatism.
And those roots are these;

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.359
I'm going to give you four.
I wrote an essay,

00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:51.281
the first essay I ever
published in graduate school was

00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:54.824
on this subject,
and you never quite forget your

00:30:54.824 --> 00:30:59.609
argument of your first essay,
even if it wasn't very good.

00:30:59.609 --> 00:31:05.789
But what began to radicalize
American anti-slavery activists?

00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:09.880
First, it was Evangelical
Christianity.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.130
Some of the radicalism they
took from their faith.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.250
They took from the so-called
Second Great Awakening.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:20.066
They took from this idea that
somehow, it was their duty,

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:24.624
it was their place in the
world--many of them were the

00:31:24.624 --> 00:31:29.009
sons and daughters of
ministers--to save souls.

00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:31.062
And if you'd been inspired by
Charles Grandison Finney out in

00:31:31.062 --> 00:31:33.496
Oberlin, Ohio,
or--as Theodore Weld had--or a

00:31:33.496 --> 00:31:37.522
number of other ministers across
the North, that it was your duty

00:31:37.522 --> 00:31:40.821
to go save souls,
it was only one step

00:31:40.821 --> 00:31:47.049
further--and Finney told them
that--to save society as well.

00:31:47.049 --> 00:31:50.601
And if conversion to Christ or
conversion to faith,

00:31:50.601 --> 00:31:54.223
conversion to salvation,
can happen immediately in a

00:31:54.223 --> 00:31:58.380
person, why not a whole society?
If you can revolutionize a

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.457
single soul, why can't you
revolutionize a hundred,

00:32:01.457 --> 00:32:02.750
100,000,1,000,000?

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:14.996
A second source--and I can say
so much more about the

00:32:14.996 --> 00:32:20.733
significance of Evangelicalism,
this idea of the rebirth of

00:32:20.733 --> 00:32:25.940
faith and rebirth of the soul,
the born-again notion,

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.306
in this era at least.
We're living in a different

00:32:29.306 --> 00:32:34.061
kind of era of Evangelicalism in
the United States--although some

00:32:34.061 --> 00:32:36.809
Evangelicals are indeed
reformers,

00:32:36.809 --> 00:32:40.752
they tend to be seen today
largely as political

00:32:40.752 --> 00:32:44.009
conservatives,
social conservatives.

00:32:44.009 --> 00:32:47.452
Some of the Evangelicalism of
the 1820s in America,

00:32:47.452 --> 00:32:50.481
in the 1830s,
became a much more radical kind

00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:54.405
of Evangelicalism in terms of
the social changes that they

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:57.662
were advocating.
Having said all that,

00:32:57.662 --> 00:33:02.806
that same Evangelical Christian
who becomes an abolitionist may

00:33:02.806 --> 00:33:07.286
indeed have been a virulent
Temperance advocate and saw

00:33:07.286 --> 00:33:11.849
demon rum as as big a demon as
demon slaveholding.

00:33:11.849 --> 00:33:17.392
The second cause of this roots
of radicalism is what we might

00:33:17.392 --> 00:33:22.842
call perceptions of southern
intransigence or perceptions of

00:33:22.842 --> 00:33:26.412
southern truculence.
In the 1820s a lot of these

00:33:26.412 --> 00:33:28.967
early young--they're youthful,
they're only in their

00:33:28.967 --> 00:33:31.923
twenties--anti-slavery advocates
are--some of them are--even

00:33:31.923 --> 00:33:35.079
William Lloyd Garrison flirted
with colonization at first,

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:37.789
when he was about
23,24-years-old.

00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:42.049
They were gradualists at first,
until they began to realize how

00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:45.690
deeply committed the South
actually was to slavery,

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:50.847
and that leaving it to them,
leaving it to their own

00:33:50.847 --> 00:33:55.599
resources, was never going to
solve anything.

00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:59.819
An early, early abolitionist,
in 1818, George Bourne said,

00:33:59.819 --> 00:34:03.742
quote, "When Southerners are
challenged on the slavery

00:34:03.742 --> 00:34:06.630
question they"--quote--"are
choked,

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:12.269
for they have a Negro stuck
fast in their throats."

00:34:12.269 --> 00:34:16.627
The more and more that early
abolitionists began to realize

00:34:16.627 --> 00:34:20.460
just how deeply committed the
South was--morally,

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.923
biblically, socially,
philosophically--to sustaining

00:34:24.923 --> 00:34:29.211
this slave society,
the more they began to realize

00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:32.800
that if they were serious about
this,

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.000
they had to have much more
radical strategies.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.183
The young William Lloyd
Garrison started by 1829 to use

00:34:42.183 --> 00:34:46.665
metaphors in his writings of
cement and icebergs that would

00:34:46.665 --> 00:34:49.679
only melt with decades and
decades,

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:54.401
to characterize what he
perceived now as this deep kind

00:34:54.401 --> 00:34:58.499
of Southern intransigence.
A third root of American

00:34:58.499 --> 00:35:02.280
radical anti-slavery though was
the British influence.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.135
Make no mistake--and I won't go
into any detail here because

00:35:06.135 --> 00:35:09.926
time doesn't permit--but these
early American abolitionists

00:35:09.926 --> 00:35:13.716
were deeply influenced by the
now decades old--two or three

00:35:13.716 --> 00:35:17.050
decades old--anti-slavery
crusade in England,

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:20.162
which at first meant,
of course, a crusade against

00:35:20.162 --> 00:35:23.148
the slave trade,
succeeding in that great Act of

00:35:23.148 --> 00:35:26.321
Parliament in 1807,
which was just celebrated last

00:35:26.321 --> 00:35:29.116
year--it's still being
celebrated in Britain as we

00:35:29.116 --> 00:35:30.520
speak,
everywhere.

00:35:34.059 --> 00:35:35.861
And then, ultimately,
the movement in England against

00:35:35.861 --> 00:35:38.709
slavery itself;
and the British Empire,

00:35:38.709 --> 00:35:44.800
of course, will free its slaves
by Act of Parliament in 1833.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.371
And thirdly,
I would argue that immediatism

00:35:49.371 --> 00:35:54.812
or a radicalization of
anti-slavery also stems from

00:35:54.812 --> 00:35:57.647
events.
I think--very often historians

00:35:57.647 --> 00:36:00.977
are asked, "so what was the most
pivotal thing" or "what's the

00:36:00.977 --> 00:36:03.869
principle cause of," or "what do
you expect to--?"

00:36:03.869 --> 00:36:06.891
You're always asked to predict,
which is the worst thing you

00:36:06.891 --> 00:36:10.168
can ask any historian,
because the historian will then

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:14.000
say, "Oh, historians never
predict," and then they'll go on

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.836
and do it.
But you know,

00:36:15.836 --> 00:36:19.669
I don't know if I'm old enough
to have any wisdom or

00:36:19.669 --> 00:36:22.449
conclusions about any of this
yet,

00:36:22.449 --> 00:36:29.366
but frankly sometimes people
simply react to events that you

00:36:29.366 --> 00:36:33.891
cannot predict.
And there were events in the

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:39.406
teens and 1820s and by the 1830s
that did indeed have a direct

00:36:39.406 --> 00:36:44.469
impact on this growth of a more
radical anti-slave--.

00:36:44.469 --> 00:36:48.259
Denmark Vesey's insurrection,
aborted insurrection,

00:36:48.259 --> 00:36:52.654
in Charleston in 1822 and the
twenty-eight or thirty people

00:36:52.654 --> 00:36:57.050
who were executed in its wake
made huge national news.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.298
The Negro Seaman's Act,
passed in South Carolina in

00:36:59.298 --> 00:37:02.040
1822, that said that any ship
that came into Charleston Harbor

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.576
in South Carolina,
if it had black sailors,

00:37:04.576 --> 00:37:08.312
those black sailors would be
jailed in Charleston while the

00:37:08.312 --> 00:37:11.313
ship was in harbor.
No white sailors would be

00:37:11.313 --> 00:37:11.820
jailed.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.503
There was a thing called the
Ohio Resolutions,

00:37:18.503 --> 00:37:20.853
passed in 1824.
Imagine this:

00:37:20.853 --> 00:37:25.439
the legislature of the state of
Ohio passed a resolution

00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:30.525
suggesting that a gradual plan
of emancipation be put in place

00:37:30.525 --> 00:37:34.670
over twenty-five years,
over two generations,

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:39.584
whatever plan they might want
to enact, and they sent this

00:37:39.584 --> 00:37:44.843
suggestion--the so-called Ohio
Resolution--to all the southern

00:37:44.843 --> 00:37:49.930
state legislatures--ha--thinking
they were going to open the

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.989
dialogue.
There was no dialogue.

00:37:53.989 --> 00:37:59.199
In effect, Ohio was told where
they could put their resolution.

00:37:59.199 --> 00:38:03.204
They got letters from a few
southern governors that said,

00:38:03.204 --> 00:38:07.210
in no uncertain terms,
"mind your own bloody business;

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.707
this is our society,
this is our system,

00:38:09.707 --> 00:38:13.848
we'll do with it as we please."
That massive growth of the

00:38:13.848 --> 00:38:18.140
domestic slave trade that I
already talked about--nearly

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.743
150,000 slaves moving from east
to west in the decade of the

00:38:22.743 --> 00:38:25.771
1820s alone;
and then it's going to double

00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:30.783
and triple, in the next decade.
Northerners become aware of

00:38:30.783 --> 00:38:33.605
this.
And Nat Turner's Insurrection

00:38:33.605 --> 00:38:36.464
in the fall of 1831,
without a question,

00:38:36.464 --> 00:38:40.350
had a radicalizing effect on
people like Garrison.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.349
Now, who was William Lloyd
Garrison?

00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:52.159
I want to touch on him just at
least briefly;

00:38:52.159 --> 00:38:55.674
well, I want to get us to this
story of the Underground

00:38:55.674 --> 00:38:57.699
Railroad.
Although, if I save the

00:38:57.699 --> 00:39:00.431
Underground Railroad for
Thursday, it still fits,

00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:03.619
because it's right there with
the Fugitive Slave Act.

00:39:03.619 --> 00:39:05.850
So don't worry if I don't quite
get there.

00:39:09.059 --> 00:39:12.863
Garrison was by no means the
whole Abolition movement,

00:39:12.863 --> 00:39:15.111
by any means.
He did found,

00:39:15.111 --> 00:39:19.076
and edited and published,
the longest lasting

00:39:19.076 --> 00:39:23.601
anti-slavery newspaper of all.
First published it January

00:39:23.601 --> 00:39:26.585
1^(st) 1831 in Boston,
called The Liberator,

00:39:26.585 --> 00:39:29.510
and he would publish it for the
next 35 years.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:37.019
He would cease publishing it in
December 1865;

00:39:37.019 --> 00:39:40.316
about nine months after the end
of the Civil War,

00:39:40.316 --> 00:39:44.574
he ceased publication of The
Liberator in the week after

00:39:44.574 --> 00:39:47.940
the ratification of the
Thirteenth Amendment.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:52.983
His life is complicated,
complex--he was one complex

00:39:52.983 --> 00:39:57.352
character.
But he is the real thing,

00:39:57.352 --> 00:40:01.679
a professional,
radical reformer.

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:05.361
He was born in utter poverty,
in Newburyport,

00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:07.909
Massachusetts.
His father went to sea and

00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:11.825
abandoned him as a child.
His mother tried to raise he

00:40:11.825 --> 00:40:16.947
and his equally ne'er-do-well
older brother on next to

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.468
nothing.
At one point,

00:40:18.468 --> 00:40:20.409
she apprenticed him out because
she couldn't feed him.

00:40:20.409 --> 00:40:24.885
And he was apprenticed out at
the age of twelve to a printer,

00:40:24.885 --> 00:40:28.690
and he learned how to make a
printing press work,

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.337
and for the rest of his life he
set his own print,

00:40:32.337 --> 00:40:35.389
every week he could,
if he was in town,

00:40:35.389 --> 00:40:39.010
in Boston, on The
Liberator.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:43.253
And he prided himself at being
faster at setting print than

00:40:43.253 --> 00:40:47.779
anybody he ever hired.
He did start as a kind of a

00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:50.058
gradualist.
He went down to Baltimore,

00:40:50.058 --> 00:40:51.914
Maryland--here I go,
I'm going to talk too much

00:40:51.914 --> 00:40:54.074
about Garrison,
but that's the way it goes--he

00:40:54.074 --> 00:40:56.752
went down to Baltimore and he
worked with an anti-slavery

00:40:56.752 --> 00:40:59.670
paper there called The Genius
of Universal Liberty,

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:03.677
published by a guy named
Benjamin Lundy,

00:41:03.677 --> 00:41:06.760
in Baltimore,
a slave state.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.222
There was a young slave growing
up there named Frederick Bailey,

00:41:12.222 --> 00:41:14.650
but they didn't meet,
yet.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:17.829
Garrison got thrown in jail,
which for him was his

00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:21.723
Birmingham Jail--if you remember
Martin Luther King's "Letter

00:41:21.723 --> 00:41:25.747
from a Birmingham Jail"--he got
thrown in jail for slandering a

00:41:25.747 --> 00:41:31.219
slave ship captain,
whom he accused of murder.

00:41:31.219 --> 00:41:34.355
The guy sued him,
he was convicted and he spent

00:41:34.355 --> 00:41:38.309
about nine months in jail,
which for Garrison was pride.

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:42.306
It was also the first time he
met and talked at great length

00:41:42.306 --> 00:41:45.489
with other blacks,
who were in jail with him.

00:41:45.489 --> 00:41:49.064
By the time he got out and came
back North and finally got the

00:41:49.064 --> 00:41:52.639
chance, after two other aborted
or failed attempts to create a

00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:55.217
newspaper,
he finally got his chance,

00:41:55.217 --> 00:41:58.664
and a little bit of money,
and he founded this paper

00:41:58.664 --> 00:42:03.125
called The Liberator,
a paper he would publish

00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:08.446
without missing an issue--and
write something for every

00:42:08.446 --> 00:42:13.613
issue--for thirty-five years.
Now, if you want to understand

00:42:13.613 --> 00:42:17.169
William Lloyd Garrison,
you have to understand through

00:42:17.169 --> 00:42:21.129
his ideas--and I'll just list
them for you with the briefest

00:42:21.129 --> 00:42:24.668
explanation.
But it is here where you see

00:42:24.668 --> 00:42:29.980
now the fruition by the 1830s of
an immediatist abolitionism,

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.168
a radicalizing form of
anti-slavery--which,

00:42:33.168 --> 00:42:36.130
by the way, will develop a
following,

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:39.630
in various forms,
among free blacks in particular

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.475
in the North,
but it will also of course

00:42:42.475 --> 00:42:45.320
begin to garner widespread
enemies,

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:52.577
widespread enemies.
Garrison and his ilk will come

00:42:52.577 --> 00:42:57.199
to be seen as very dangerous
people, these reformers.

00:42:57.199 --> 00:43:01.406
But if you can remember these
six ideas of William Lloyd

00:43:01.406 --> 00:43:06.450
Garrison's--or do I have seven?
It's seven, sorry--you can have

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:11.329
a handle on what immediatism and
radical anti-slavery became,

00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:15.215
in Garrison's hands.
Now, as soon as you get a

00:43:15.215 --> 00:43:19.889
leader who goes out and pushes
an idea, pushes an agenda,

00:43:19.889 --> 00:43:22.475
pushes a set of moral
principles by which this

00:43:22.475 --> 00:43:25.290
movement should be run,
of course he's immediately

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:28.679
begun to develop an opposition
within his own movement.

00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:29.829
And people will disagree with
him.

00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:32.779
But number one,
his first idea was moral

00:43:32.779 --> 00:43:36.709
perfectionism.
A stern, demanding call for

00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:42.048
abolitionists to remove
themselves personally from any

00:43:42.048 --> 00:43:47.690
corrupting complicity with the
American slave system.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:51.983
"Be ye perfect,
even as your Heavenly Father is

00:43:51.983 --> 00:43:56.731
perfect," said Garrison.
He was not a trained minister,

00:43:56.731 --> 00:44:00.909
but he was a deeply Old
Testament biblical Christian.

00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:05.996
His second principle was
passivism, what the nineteenth

00:44:05.996 --> 00:44:11.678
century called non-resistance.
Garrison rejected all acts of

00:44:11.678 --> 00:44:17.200
violence, in any form--well,
until the Civil War broke out.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.252
More on that later.
His third principle was

00:44:21.252 --> 00:44:25.872
anti-clericalism or opposition
to what he saw as the hypocrisy

00:44:25.872 --> 00:44:29.130
and corruption of the American
churches.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:32.440
The Protestant clergy was one
of his greatest targets.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.932
And make no mistake,
folks, Frederick Douglass began

00:44:35.932 --> 00:44:38.877
his career as an intellectual,
as an orator,

00:44:38.877 --> 00:44:41.480
and as a writer,
as a Garrisonian.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.787
It was William Lloyd Garrison
who, in part,

00:44:43.787 --> 00:44:47.139
discovered Frederick Douglass
by going down to New Bedford,

00:44:47.139 --> 00:44:49.918
Massachusetts and watching this
brilliant, young,

00:44:49.918 --> 00:44:52.755
twenty-one-year-old,
twenty-two-year-old black guy

00:44:52.755 --> 00:44:56.344
get up and speak at the African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church

00:44:56.344 --> 00:45:00.075
in New Bedford,
and said, "My God,

00:45:00.075 --> 00:45:04.468
this kid can speak."
And for the first five,

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:08.019
six years of Douglass's public
life Garrison was like his

00:45:08.019 --> 00:45:11.570
mentor, a father-figure,
and an intellectual teacher.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:15.408
Look for these Garrisonian
tenets when you read the

00:45:15.408 --> 00:45:18.190
narrative.
His fourth principle was what

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:21.336
he called dis-unionism.
"No union with the

00:45:21.336 --> 00:45:26.868
slaveholders" was his motto or
his statement on the masthead of

00:45:26.868 --> 00:45:30.841
The Liberator.
He actually advocated a kind of

00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:32.910
personal secession from the
Union.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.180
This was one of those ideas.
He advocated that Northern

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:41.398
states not participate in the
same Constitution--more on that

00:45:41.398 --> 00:45:45.446
later when we get to 1854.
And five, he took it one step

00:45:45.446 --> 00:45:50.010
further.
He advocated not voting.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:52.164
To vote in an American
election, he believed,

00:45:52.164 --> 00:45:54.269
was to be morally complicit
with slavery.

00:45:54.269 --> 00:45:58.602
Until the U.S.
Constitution was ripped up and

00:45:58.602 --> 00:46:04.610
rewritten he advocated political
non-participation with it.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.550
Now, how that was supposed to
change the world and save it was

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:11.910
always a bit of a problem,
for some of Garrison's own

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.051
admirers.
Sixth, he was an early and

00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:20.010
often supporter of women's
rights and women's equality,

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.180
which was another form of
radicalism that would make you

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.889
lots of enemies in the 1830s,
'40s, and '50s.

00:46:25.889 --> 00:46:29.848
And seventh,
he was a tremendous advocate of

00:46:29.848 --> 00:46:33.163
African-American civil
rights--early,

00:46:33.163 --> 00:46:37.490
in a time when there in effect
weren't any.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:44.942
Now, I'm going to leave you
here thinking with me just for a

00:46:44.942 --> 00:46:48.674
moment--I think I have two
minutes--about what's going to

00:46:48.674 --> 00:46:51.739
happen now with this
anti-slavery impulse,

00:46:51.739 --> 00:46:55.974
because in part what happened
is that two kinds of

00:46:55.974 --> 00:47:00.210
abolitionisms emerged,
one white and one black.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:03.267
And there were hundreds and
hundreds of white abolitionists,

00:47:03.267 --> 00:47:05.493
thousands eventually,
across the North,

00:47:05.493 --> 00:47:08.655
who became deeply involved in
organizing anti-slavery

00:47:08.655 --> 00:47:11.877
societies and creating
newspapers and running petition

00:47:11.877 --> 00:47:15.605
campaigns by the 1830s,
and eventually even beginning

00:47:15.605 --> 00:47:19.657
to be involved in the first
fledging anti-slavery political

00:47:19.657 --> 00:47:23.010
parties--although Garrison
wouldn't go there.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.239
But there are also lots of
black abolitionists in the

00:47:25.239 --> 00:47:26.739
North, free blacks,
many of them,

00:47:26.739 --> 00:47:30.534
though, former fugitive slaves
who wore the experience of

00:47:30.534 --> 00:47:34.869
slavery on their backs and in
their souls and in their psyche,

00:47:34.869 --> 00:47:39.005
and often could not risk the
kind of abstractions,

00:47:39.005 --> 00:47:44.154
the kind of theoretical debates
and arguments over tactics and

00:47:44.154 --> 00:47:49.050
strategy the white abolitionists
would spend hours on.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:51.065
A lot of black abolitionists
said" all right already,

00:47:51.065 --> 00:47:52.460
what are we doing for the
slaves?"

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.113
Or "what are we doing for my
children that don't have a

00:47:54.113 --> 00:47:55.564
school?"
"What are we doing for that

00:47:55.564 --> 00:48:00.659
child who doesn't have parents?
We need an orphanage."

00:48:00.659 --> 00:48:05.257
A real division will evolve by
the 1840s and into the 1850s

00:48:05.257 --> 00:48:09.461
between the very real,
practical needs of northern

00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:13.211
free blacks and black
abolitionists and white

00:48:13.211 --> 00:48:16.598
abolitionists.
But beneath all of this,

00:48:16.598 --> 00:48:20.127
the fugitives kept coming.
The fugitive slaves kept coming

00:48:20.127 --> 00:48:22.604
out of the south.
They never came in the numbers

00:48:22.604 --> 00:48:26.162
that the myth and the legend of
the Underground Railroad teaches

00:48:26.162 --> 00:48:28.775
us today.
And I'm going to return to that

00:48:28.775 --> 00:48:31.960
myth-and-legend problem when we
begin on Thursday.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.690
And I want to leave you with
this.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:38.482
This is just a way of thinking
your way to Thursday,

00:48:38.482 --> 00:48:42.531
and as you read Douglass.
As you already know sometimes I

00:48:42.531 --> 00:48:44.970
think the poets tell us more
than the historians.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:49.639
I hate to admit it.
Robert Hayden,

00:48:49.639 --> 00:48:52.470
the great African-American poet
who wrote mostly in the 1960s,

00:48:56.019 --> 00:48:58.730
wrote a magnificent poem about
runaway slaves,

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:00.960
who they were,
what they represent,

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.112
the story they help us tell.
He called it "Runagate,

00:49:04.112 --> 00:49:07.323
Runagate."
And he rooted it in the refrain

00:49:07.323 --> 00:49:11.490
of the great negro spiritual
"Many Thousands Gone."

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:16.179
Just a couple of verses.
We'll return to it on Thursday.

00:49:16.179 --> 00:49:17.630
It might be something TAs want
to pick up.

00:49:21.019 --> 00:49:24.550
"Runs falls rises stumbles on
from darkness into darkness,

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.710
and the darkness thicketed with
shapes of terror,

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:30.260
and the hunters pursuing and
the hounds pursuing,

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.130
and the night cold and the
night long and the river,

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.744
to cross and the
jack-muh-lanterns beckoning

00:49:35.744 --> 00:49:38.662
beckoning beckoning,
and blackness ahead and when

00:49:38.662 --> 00:49:42.128
shall I reach that somewhere
morning and keep on going and

00:49:42.128 --> 00:49:44.560
never turn back and keep on
going.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:50.232
Runagate, Runagate, Runagate.
Many thousands rise and go,

00:49:50.232 --> 00:49:54.964
many thousands crossing over.
O mythic North,

00:49:54.964 --> 00:49:59.110
O star-shaped yonder Bible
city.

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.239
Some go weeping and some
rejoice and some in coffins.

00:50:02.239 --> 00:50:05.382
And some in carriages,
and some in silks and some in

00:50:05.382 --> 00:50:10.540
shackles.
Rise and go, fair you well."

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.673
See ya Thursday.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.390
PROFESSOR: So I want to begin
today by continuing at the

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.260
point where we left off the
in the previous lecture.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.990
Which was to talk about, in the
context of Jonathan Shay's

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.030
work, Achilles In Vietnam, the
costs that seem to arise when

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.560
people find themselves through
circumstance engaging in

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.940
behavior that they, on
reflection, believe to be

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.950
immoral or unjust.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.150
So in 1961, in newspapers
throughout the New Haven area,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.190
the following advertisement
appeared.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.140
It said, "Public announcement.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.765
We will pay you $4"--

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:48.690
that was quite a bit of money
at that time-- "$4 for one

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.000
hour of your time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.830
Persons needed for
study of memory.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.050
We will pay $500 New Haven
men to help us complete a

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.780
scientific study of memory
and learning.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.000
The study is being done
at Yale University.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Each person who participates
will be will be paid $4, plus

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.660
$0.50 in carfare, for
approximately one hour's time.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.670
We need you only for
that one hour.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.260
There no further obligations.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.810
You may choose the time that
you would like to come,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.400
evenings, and weekends, or
weekdays." And then the ad

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.050
continued by saying that "no
special training, education,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.390
or experience was needed,"
that they wanted "factory

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.780
workers, city employees,
laborers, barbers,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.940
businessmen, clerks,
professional people, telephone

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.010
workers, construction workers,
salespeople, white collar

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.720
workers, and others."

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.010
So when people answered this
advertisement, they were

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.400
invited to come to a building
whose exterior should be

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.740
familiar to you.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.080
The building was
Linsley-Chittenden Hall.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.710
And when they walked into that
building, they encountered the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.440
study of a gentleman who
looked like this.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.620
The advertisement that I've just
shown you is, of course,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.780
the advertisement recruiting
subject to participate in the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.540
famous Milgram study.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.790
So the participants filled out
the coupon at the bottom of

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.270
the ad and came to laboratory
in what is now

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.720
Linsley-Chittenden Hall.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.320
The configuration of the
building was different then,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.210
but the facade was grand,
and the lab was elegant.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.500
When subjects entered the lab,
they were told that they would

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.200
be participating in a study of
learning and memory, and they

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.170
were told that there were two
roles that they might play.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.590
They might be the teacher, or
they might be the learner.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.580
But as a matter of fact, when
they drew the folded pieces of

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.810
paper, both of them said
"teacher," and the other

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.300
subject, who was apparently
participating in this study,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.290
was in fact the collaborator.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.130
So when the study was actually
carried out, the people who

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.900
played the role of teacher were
forty men from the New

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.840
Haven area who had responded to
these ads who ranged in age

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.920
from twenty to fifty, who had
a wide range of occupations

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.200
and education levels.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.200
And all of them were told that
that they were going to engage

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.220
in a task that involved testing
the role of punishment

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.760
on learning, and they were
told that the second

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.480
character, the learner, who
was a forty seven year old

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.670
accountant of Irish-American
stock whom almost all of them

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.100
described as mild-mannered and
likeable, would be presented

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.660
with a series of pairs of words,
and that their task

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.829
would simply be to provide him
with an electric shock every

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.079
time he got the answer wrong.

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.900
And in order to supervise the
study as it went on, there was

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.690
a third person present--

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.170
the experimenter--

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.700
who was a stern, impassive
thirty one year old high

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.840
school biology teacher.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.840
So in every single one of the
cases, two of the figures, the

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.850
experimenter and the learner,
were the same, and one of the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.000
figures, the teacher, varied.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.330
The task was as follows.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.150
They were presented with a
machine that had on it a

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.560
series of switches that began
with the label "slight shock,"

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.080
15 volt, 30 volt, 45 volt,
60 volt, and continued in

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:50.320
increments of 15, 75, 90, 105,
120, et cetera, all the way

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.140
through "intense shock" : 255,
270, 285, 300, "danger severe

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.002
shock," and finally, (don't
search for this on Google!)

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:03.860
"XXX."

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.980
So they were each given in a
shock, purportedly by the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.780
machine, of 45 volts,
which most of them

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.680
estimated to be 70 volts.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.420
That is, they felt it
quite intensely.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.050
And then they were told that
they would need to administer

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.180
a shock to the learner every
time he made a mistake.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.870
Now, before Milgram conducted
this study, he surveyed a

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.180
bunch of Yale senior psychology
majors who make

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.650
predictions about how many
shocks the teachers would be

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.780
willing to give.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.010
And if you can see from this
graph, that prediction was

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.695
that no more than 3% of subjects
would give shocks at

00:05:46.695 --> 00:05:51.390
the level 20, which is down at
the level of danger, and that

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.050
virtually no one would go
to the highest level.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.080
What happened instead, all of
you know, with respect to the

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.430
slight shocks (15, 30,
45, 60), 100% of the

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.270
teachers gave them.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:17.340
With respect to the intense
shocks (255, 270, 285, 300),

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.320
88% of the subjects
went there.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.450
When they expressed
dissatisfaction at continuing,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.870
they were told by the
experimenter, "Please

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.910
continue," or "The experiment
requires that you continue" or

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.950
"It is absolutely essential that
you continue," or "You

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.840
have no other choice, you must
go on," but no other

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.760
encouragement was provided.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:52.060
Nonetheless, up to the level of
"danger, severe shock," 68%

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.090
of the subjects continued, and
all the way up to the very

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.120
last level, 65% continued.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.060
This much is frequently
emphasized when people discuss

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.500
the Milgram experiment, and its
extraordinary fact about

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.440
human beings that Milgram was
prompted to investigate

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.680
because, of course, this
possibility had just been

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.240
demonstrated profoundly for
the world outside of the

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.530
laboratory.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.640
The research that Milgram
conducted was inspired by an

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.280
attempt to understand what could
possibly have explained

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.730
the behavior of ordinary German

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.500
citizens in Nazi Germany.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.740
That said, what I want to bring
out about the Milgram

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.210
study is in fact the part of
the discussion that comes

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.100
subsequent to what I've
just presented.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.830
Which is the discussion
of what it felt like,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.890
subjectively, to these subjects,
when they felt

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:02.460
themselves to be perpetrating
painful behavior on another.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:08.530
As, as you can see from this
slide, so many of them did.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.150
The psychological response of
the subjects sounds like what

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.400
we read in Jonathan Shay's book
for the last lecture.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.760
Many subjects showed "signs of
nervousness, especially upon

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.910
administering the more
powerful shock.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.770
In a large number of cases, the
degree of tension reached

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.790
extremes rarely seen in such
laboratory subjects.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.610
They were observed to sweat,
to stutter, to bite their

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.610
lips, to groan, to dig their
fingernails into their flesh."

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.280
These were characteristic
rather

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.060
than exceptional responses.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.330
And if you've never seen the
film that Milgram made in

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.290
conducting the experiments--

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.220
which are not public domain,
but I here just give you

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.680
information about something
that's on the Iinternet--

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.910
you can listen to the
experimenter's calm voice, and

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.390
watch the subjects' agitation.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.760
Here's a description.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.440
"One might suppose," says
Milgram, reporting "that a

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.480
subject would simply break
off, or continue as his

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.970
conscience dictated.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.160
Yet this is far from
what happened.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.735
There were striking reactions
of tension

00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:14.020
and emotional strain.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.280
One observer related, 'I
observed a mature and

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.860
initially poised businessman
enter the laboratory, smiling

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.590
and confident.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.700
Within twenty minutes, he was
reduced to a twitching,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.560
stuttering wreck.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.980
He constantly pulled
on his earlobe.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.280
He twisted his hands.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.970
At one point, he pushed his fist
into his forehead, and

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.850
muttered, "Oh God, let's stop
it," and yet, and yet he

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.180
continued to respond to every
word of the experimenter, and

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.880
obeyed to the end.'"

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.870
So it's a funny thing about
we human creatures.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:59.150
That on the one hand, we seem to
have a sense of what we can

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.002
comfortably put up with.

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:08.300
And we have, on the contrary, an
ability to go beyond that.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:15.230
That capacity can be exploited
for the good or for the bad.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.030
Those of you who are on sports
teams know the experience of

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.620
being pushed past what you
thought could possibly be your

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.260
limit, and finding yourself
carrying through, despite the

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.990
fact that initially it seems
like something impossible.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.130
But it's always the case that
things with which we feel

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.290
repulsion are things
that we may find

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.310
ourselves carrying out.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.050
Nonetheless, that carries
with it psychic costs.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.030
And that's the second answer
that I want to give in the

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:54.290
context of the lecture on themis
to Glaucon's challenge.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.310
I want to turn now to the topic
of today's lecture,

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.820
flourishing and attachment, by
actually continuing with a

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.050
variation on the Milgram
studies.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.340
Because after Milgram found
these results through the 1961

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.110
work, he was gripped by the
question, under what

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:21.260
circumstances was compliance
more or less likely?

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.090
So in a follow-up study done
the next year, Milgram

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.350
explored the question in its
most general form, as follows.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.392
In its most general form, the
problem is this: "if X tells Y

00:11:34.392 --> 00:11:39.170
to hurt Z, under what conditions
will Y carry out

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.530
the command of X,
and under what

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.030
conditions will he refuse?

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.420
In the more limited form
possible in laboratory

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.990
research, the question becomes:
if an experimenter

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.200
tells a subject to hurt another
person, under what

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.270
conditions will the subject go
along with this instruction,

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.970
and under what conditions
will he refuse to obey?"

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:07.120
Milgram set out to test this by
varying along a continuum

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.910
the degree of human interaction
in the study.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.170
So in one series of studies,
the experimenter, the one

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.530
telling you to continue, was
either in the room with you,

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:25.720
or on the phone with you, or
such that you only received

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.730
written instructions.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:33.180
And the tendency of subject to
collaborate, to cooperate, to

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.680
do what was act of them,
declined directly with whether

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.350
the experimenter was present
in the room with them.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:48.280
Likewise, Milgram varied the
extent to which the subject

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.800
received feedback from the
person being shocked.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.750
Did they receive no feedback,
called the remote condition?

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.230
Did they receive the sort of
voice feedback, as in the

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.960
initial experiments, where you'd
hear the person shouting

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.050
through the wall, "It's
painful, I'm

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.110
hurting, please stop"?

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.720
Were they in the room with the
subject, observing him suffer,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.780
or did they finally, in the most
extreme condition, need

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:20.130
to take the subject's arm, put
it onto a metal plate, and

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.840
hold the there in order
to give him a shock?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.020
What Milgram discovered is that
although compliance is

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:34.380
extremely high when there's no
feedback from the sufferer,

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.130
it's lower when there's voice
feedback, lower still when

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.050
you're in the room with the
person you're harming, and

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.600
lower still when you yourself
need to use your

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.040
body to cause harm.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.930
You'll recall in the very
first lecture, the

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.030
introductory lecture, when I was
telling you about one of

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.270
the questions we would
discuss this term.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.500
That I presented you with
something called the trolley

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.530
problem, a case where a trolley
is hurtling down a

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.650
track, and it's headed
towards five people.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.200
And in the first version of
that study, I asked you

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.800
whether it would be morally
acceptable to divert the

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.680
trolley in such a way that it
went onto a track where there

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.050
was only one person, and
most of you thought

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.240
that was all right.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.110
In the second variation of the
study, I asked you whether it

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:34.220
would be OK to stop the trolley
by pushing into the

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.810
track of a trolley a fat man who
was standing next to you

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.660
on a bridge overlooking
the tracks.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.030
And most of you thought
that was not OK.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:51.330
There's something in the human
perception of our interactions

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:59.160
with one another that seems to
give rise to anxiety in the

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.400
face of caused harms whose
consequences we see.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.440
Milgram articulates it thus.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.710
He says, "In the remote, and to
a lesser extent, the voice

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.570
feedback condition, the victim
suffering possesses an

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.160
abstract, remote quality
for the subject.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.080
He's aware, but only in a
conceptual sense." His reason

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.990
knows, in Plato's terminology,
but the other parts of his

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.590
soul haven't registered
what's going on.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.370
"This phenomenon," Milgram
continues, "is common enough.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.330
The bombardier can reasonably
suppose that his weapons will

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.590
inflict suffering and death.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.810
In fact, they do just as good
a job killing people as

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.240
bayonets do.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.490
But this knowledge is divested
of affect, and does not move

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.530
him to a felt emotional response
to the sufferings of

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.010
his actions."

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.000
Similar observations had
been made in wartime.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.660
Visual cues associated with the
victim's suffering trigger

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.990
empathic responses in the
subject and provide him with a

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.800
more complete grasp of the
victim's experience.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.250
And it turns out that one of the
major strategies in Nazi

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:16.530
Germany to enable people to
commit harm against their

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:22.640
neighbors was to use a language
of dehumanization

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.300
that referred to groups being
harmed--the Jews, the gypsies,

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.670
the homosexuals--as non-human
in some way.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:38.490
When we perceive another as
human, it is difficult to

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:43.040
overcome the tendency not
to want to harm them.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.430
And though I've given you a
number of examples of the way

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:51.410
in which military resistance
can be a powerful mechanism

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:57.359
for pursuing one's will, this
fact that Milgram observes is

00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:01.460
actually what underlies the
possibility of another form of

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.230
resistance which has
been, in some

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.770
circumstances, shockingly effective.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:15.250
Here's Gandhi, engaging in
nonviolent protests in India

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.260
in the 1940s.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.500
Here's a sit-in at the
lunch counters in

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.600
Selma, Alabama in 1963.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.890
And here, of course, is one of
the most famous pictures of

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.140
the last two decades.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:40.200
An individual standing alone
before tanks in a way that

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.350
causes them to halt their motion
in Tiananmen Square.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:50.150
So what is it in about human
beings that makes it easier

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.310
for us to avoid demands when the
person making the demands

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.520
of us isn't present, and harder
for us to carry through

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.450
demands when we have to look
face to face at the person we

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.200
are harming?

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.250
Well, what it is about human
beings is the unsurprising

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.780
fact that we are fundamentally,
deep down, and

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.770
profoundly social entities.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.640
And we're social entities in a
way that is continuous with

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.980
our non-human primate
ancestors.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:31.650
So Harry Harlow, in the first
half of the century, conducted

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:37.310
a number of studies using
non-human primates to try to

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:42.480
figure out what role emotional
connection and social bonding

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.720
played in allowing
them to flourish.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.720
So in the famous wire
versus cloth

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.080
mother studies, monkeys--

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.940
there's a little one
right there--

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:57.740
were presented with two beings,
wire beings with whom

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.530
they could spend their time.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:04.690
The wire mother had milk, and
they needed to go to her to

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:10.320
get food, but the cloth mother
had comfort, and if they

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.330
wanted to be consoled, they
needed to go to her.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.380
And monkey after monkey after
monkey did what you see in

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.130
this picture.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:21.710
Went--

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.560
and the fact that you're saying
"aw" is evidence of the

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.120
point that I'm making.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.500
So we think this is adorable.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.460
We think--

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.310
in fact, it's very hard to
control your facial muscles

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.580
when you look at that picture.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.510
Right?

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:45.260
All of us are looking at it,
seeing these big warm eyes,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.950
and this expression
of affection.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:56.140
It is part of the primate
maturation experience that in

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.200
order to become a healthy and
flourishing member of the

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.700
species, early social
contact is crucial.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.970
And indeed, some of Harlow's
more morally problematic

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:15.950
studies involved subjecting
young monkeys to complete

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:21.400
social deprivation, and
discovering afterwards that

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.490
when they came out of that
deprivation, their behavior

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:29.990
was incompatible with living
in a community.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.660
Not only were they hostile and
aggressive towards their

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.400
peers, even with respect to the
children that they had,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.730
they were incapable of engaging
in nurturing.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.930
So one might wonder, as Harlow's
student John Bowlby

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.390
and his collaborator, Mary
Ainsworth, did, whether

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.370
there's anything that can be
said about what's required for

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.940
human beings to flourish that
can be learned from the

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.680
picture that we see
in the Harlow wire

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.810
baby cloth baby studies.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:06.840
That is, is it possible that for
human beings to thrive, we

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.550
need a certain sort of warmth
and interaction that isn't

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:17.290
limited merely to the receipt
of nutrients required for

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.940
maturation from a wire mother?

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:27.440
So I take this next slide,
this next chart, from a

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.140
website called "Positive
Parenting," because I want you

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:36.230
to recognize how much the
picture that Bowlby and

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.120
Ainsworth have advanced has
permeated contemporary

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.500
conceptions of how it is that
it's appropriate to parent

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.560
one's children.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.450
So famously, Mary Ainsworth
brought young children,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.000
roughly two years old, into a
laboratory setting along with

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.140
their primary caregiver.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:01.200
And the question she wanted to
see was, how comfortable were

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.310
the children in what was known
as a strange situation, a

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.520
situation in which they would
be required to set out on

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.760
their own, away from their
caregiver, in order to engage

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.690
with some appealing toys.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.760
And on the basis of that, that
she identified three--

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.190
it's now been expanded
to four--

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.510
three styles of attachment that
children might have to

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.410
their caregivers.

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:33.580
The first, which she called
secure attachment, results

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.690
from early childhood experience
that involves

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:43.100
predictable responsiveness to
one's needs by somebody who

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.380
feels affection for you.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.890
If you are hungry, somebody
responds by

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.140
providing you with food.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.150
If you are sore, somebody
responds by

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.290
comforting your pain.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.590
If you are cold, somebody
responds by warming you up.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:03.060
And all of this is done in such
a way that you begin to

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:10.240
form an impression of yourself
as an agent in the world whose

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:16.530
expression of needs and desires
can evince in other

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:21.560
conscious beings responses that
reflect what it is that

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.790
you need and desire.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:28.820
The world becomes a place
in which social trust is

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.800
possible, and the early
instincts that you come to

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.440
have, when presented with
the faces and bodies of

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:43.130
conspecifics, cause you, later
on, to have as your most

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:48.550
primitive response pattern an
expectation that, if there's

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:53.320
no evidence to the contrary,
that conspecific is going to

00:23:53.320 --> 00:24:00.440
be responsive to your honest
and expressed needs.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.840
By contrast, a smaller
percentage of the children

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.770
exhibited what Ainsworth called
avoidant attachment.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:17.045
They were unwilling to explore
the room, and they were

00:24:17.045 --> 00:24:20.810
unwilling to do so, hypothesized
Ainsworth,

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:26.210
because their early childhood
experience had been one with a

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:31.200
disengaged or distant
caregiver.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.480
Upon expression of need, there
was no sense that if there's a

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.725
social other, that social other
will respond to what it

00:24:39.725 --> 00:24:42.250
is that you are asking for.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:47.000
So there's a sense that
developed that the world is

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.880
not a safe and cooperative
place.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.730
The third group were children
that she called

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.460
ambivalently attached.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.770
Ambivalently attached children
experienced a regimen of

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:08.080
response which was sometimes
in keeping with what they

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.260
asked, and sometimes ignoring
them entirely.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.900
So although they didn't have the
sense that the world never

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.500
does what you ask it too, they
did have the sense that the

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.830
world doesn't reliably do
what you ask it to.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:27.810
And finally, into a fourth
category added subsequently,

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:33.100
fall children who are not merely
ignored, but who are in

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:39.590
fact abused or mistreated
in the face of

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.760
expression of need.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:48.230
Now, this taxonomy is not of a
level of precision that it

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:53.580
will tell you easily for every
child into which category they

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.300
fall as a result of
their treatment.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.760
There are lots of issues about
innate dispositions that

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.960
children have, and there are
lots of cases where it might

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.910
not be clear how to put children
into this taxonomy.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.840
Nonetheless, it has served as
the basis for one of the most

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.390
extraordinary scientific studies
conducted in the last

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:21.230
century, which is a thirty
year longitudinal study

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:27.850
conducted by people who took
attachment theory seriously,

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.630
who looked at the extent to
which predictors of subsequent

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.270
flourishing could be traced to
early childhood experience.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.900
And this book, The Development
of the Person (which I read

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:46.080
over the summer) is
extraordinary in the sense

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.040
that it shows what it takes to
establish a complicated social

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.590
scientific hypothesis
with even a

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.770
reasonable degree of certainty.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.520
Because of course, if you want
to find out about whether

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.390
early childhood experience
affects subsequent

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:08.780
development, we can't use
you guys, because we

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.360
lost our time machine.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.590
We left it in the future.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.700
So we can't go back and
look at what your

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.950
childhoods were like.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.910
All of these studies needed
to be done perspectively.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:25.350
So what this group did was to
study hundreds and hundreds

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:30.670
and hundreds of children, with
incredible effort to follow

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.610
them even when they
moved away.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.870
And the basic conclusion
that they draw--

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.430
the book is several hundred
pages long, but the basic

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:45.460
conclusion that they draw
confirms the thesis that

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.940
attachment theory
hypothesizes.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.340
That early childhood experience,
and particularly

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.290
early childhood experience of
a trusting and responsive

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:57.060
relationship, significantly
shapes later patterns of

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.730
response to the world.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:03.790
But of course, we've
heard that before.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.110
We heard it when we were told
that "it's not unimportant to

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.790
acquire one sort of habit or
another right from youth.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:14.810
It is, in fact, all-important."

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.700
Now, none of this is to say
that those whose early

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.710
childhood experiences were
not optimal will

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.510
never flourish or thrive.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:30.190
The human spirit is remarkably
resilient, and it is possible,

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.500
through certain kinds of
therapeutic interaction, or

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.100
certain kinds of cultivation of
other trusting relations,

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.710
to overcome early childhood
deprivation.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:48.340
But there is an easier path to
flourishing, and that is the

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.510
one that goes through trusting
early childhood.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.665
Now, the fact that human beings
are social beings

00:28:57.665 --> 00:29:02.400
affects us not just at the
beginning of the lifespan, but

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.130
also at the end.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.410
"If you want to predict," points
out Jonathan Haidt,

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:15.130
"how happy someone is, or how
long they're likely to live,

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:19.470
you should find out about their
social relationships.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.280
Having strong social
relationships strengthens the

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.480
immune system.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.810
It extends life more than
quitting smoking.

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.630
It speeds recovery from surgery,
reduces the risk of

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.700
depression and anxiety
disorders." Social

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:39.610
interactions are crucial
to human flourishing.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:44.310
And this is not just something
that we discover in the west.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:49.830
Here are some titles of articles
that I pulled out of

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.830
Google Scholar when
I was doing my

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:55.524
directed exercise three.

00:29:55.524 --> 00:29:57.800
"Effects of Social Integration:
On Preserving

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.300
Memory Function in a U.S.
Elderly Population." Here's

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.540
one about ten-year survival rate
in an Australian society.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.830
Here's one about social
integration and

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.550
mortality in France.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.960
Here's one about social
interaction and

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.830
mortality in Sweden.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.400
Here's one in Finland.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.930
Here's one in Japan.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.570
Here's one in China.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:24.100
In every culture which anybody
has looked at, social

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:30.170
engagement is crucial to
human flourishing.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:38.140
Now, we might want ask whether
this tells us anything about

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.830
the question that we're
concerned within this segment

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.350
of the course--the question of
human flourishing--and whether

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.725
this tells us anything about the
questions that we're going

00:30:46.725 --> 00:30:49.800
to address in the subsequent
units of the course.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.300
Our discussions of morality
and our discussions of

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.540
political philosophy.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:31:00.680
So Harrow and Bowlby and the
Minnesota study have pointed

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.220
out that in order for human
beings to develop the kind of

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:10.560
trusting relationship that
enables a society even to get

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.970
off the ground, it's crucial
that there be a certain sort

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:19.390
of stable social connection
in infancy.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.630
We'll ask, in the context of
our discussion of political

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:30.330
philosophy, whether this has
any implications for how a

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:37.100
society needs to be structured
if we hope to cultivate in it

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.550
just citizens capable of
domestic and democratic

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.460
participation.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.980
Does it mean, astoundingly, that
something we might think

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.660
would be of no concern as far as
political philosophy goes,

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:57.330
the internal structure of the
family, is of concern, as far

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.860
as political philosophy goes?

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:05.870
And if so, does that turn out to
be a victory for the left?

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.570
For the right?

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:11.020
Or something else altogether?

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:16.490
We'll ask in the context of
Haidt's discussion of romantic

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.390
love as an extraordinary
combination, as you read, of

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:24.120
our capacity for attachment, our
capacity for caregiving,

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.670
and our capacity for mating,
whether any moral code we have

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.880
needs to respect the fact that
we will have special

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.435
relationships to certain
individuals that will render

00:32:36.435 --> 00:32:41.780
us incapable of treating them as
one among many, even though

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.400
what morality seems to demand
of us is that we treat

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.280
everybody equally.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.370
We'll ask, in the context of
Nozick's discussion in the

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:57.760
paper that we read of love as
a formation of a we, whether

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.120
when we form connections that
extend beyond individuals

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.140
connections to things like
neighborhoods or religious

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:12.920
communities or nations, whether
that itself has any

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.150
moral or political bearing.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.530
We'll turn back to the question
raised by James

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:24.170
Stockdale who pointed out
to us the importance of

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.100
friendship, of unit cohesion,
and of close camaraderie in

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:32.440
permitting resilience in the
face of suffering, whether

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.420
it's in fact incumbent upon
political structures to

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:41.410
promote stability in communities
so as to allow

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:46.851
people to whether the storms
that fortune brings.

00:33:46.851 --> 00:33:50.290
And in so doing, we'll be able
to make sense of this

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.810
extraordinarily strange
phenomenon, which is that

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:58.400
Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics,
a book about ethics

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.949
that grounds the Western ethical
tradition, includes

00:34:02.949 --> 00:34:09.159
within its twelve chapters two
full chapters devoted to the

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:13.949
question of friendship, in
which Aristotle begins by

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:17.949
pointing out that if you are
young or if you are old, if

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.690
you are rich, if you are poor,
if you are at a time of your

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.920
life when things are going well
or if you're at a time of

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.880
your life where things are going
badly, nothing plays a

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.620
more central role in allowing
you to flourish than

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.620
friendship does.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.920
Thanks to all of you
for coming by

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.500
for an extra lecture.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.310
I'm happy to take questions,
though technically we've come

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:45.040
to the end of the fifty minutes
that we were allotted.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.270
But I'm happy to answer
questions,

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.780
because there's no deadline.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.600
Hello, yeah.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.850
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.010
PROFESSOR: No, people can go!

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:54.720
Ask your question.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.956
I'd love to answer it.

00:34:55.956 --> 00:34:57.206
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:59.428 --> 00:35:03.892
between early childhood
nurturing, which leads to

00:35:03.892 --> 00:35:07.860
flourishing, and neglect,
which would lead

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.836
to something bad.

00:35:10.836 --> 00:35:14.556
But that seems to be kind of
morally-charged, there's a

00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:16.788
value judgment inherent
in all of this.

00:35:16.788 --> 00:35:20.508
And I've been wondering because
I think that book that

00:35:20.508 --> 00:35:23.732
you mentioned about different
facets of our personality

00:35:23.732 --> 00:35:24.724
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:35:24.724 --> 00:35:30.676
experience because we can't say
that necessarily there's a

00:35:30.676 --> 00:35:34.190
good way to know how to
raise your child.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:40.640
PROFESSOR: OK so the question
was, look, I made a statement

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.920
that a certain kind of early
childhood nurturing seems to

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.980
lead to social capabilities of
a certain kind, whereas early

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.440
childhood neglect seems to lead
to social disabilities.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.630
In making that statement, A, I
making a value judgment that's

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.190
illegitimate about how we want
to be able to function in

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.770
society, B, am I making a
value judgment that's

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.960
illegitimate about what's
appropriate in child rearing?

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.750
So let me turn to the second
first. The claims about early

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:16.210
childhood nurturing that are
made here are primarily about

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.040
roughly the first eighteen
months of life.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:24.030
There is great dispute here on
campus and elsewhere about

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.740
what is appropriate after those
first eighteen months.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.420
But there seems to be pretty
clear evidence, both

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.740
domestically and
cross-culturally, that during

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.700
the first eighteen months, the
idea of too much nurturing,

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.560
too much responsiveness,
is one on which it's

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.180
hard to get a handle.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.390
That is, being such that your
needs are responded to seems

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.990
to be a way of promoting

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.960
stability and trust. OK.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.430
Back to your first question.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.790
Are we making value judgments
about what it's like to be a

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.940
good person when we say: we're
looking to cultivate in

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.080
ourselves the possibility of
trust and connection instead

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.280
of a life of distrust?

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.450
I suppose there are
circumstances, societies in

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.200
which being trusting would
be a detriment.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.850
Being able to respond to
somebody without constantly

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:21.430
being on guard would
be dangerous.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:25.930
And in those circumstances, it
would perhaps make sense to

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.280
cultivate a different kind of
early childhood experience.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:35.090
Whether that shows that we've
found two equally good forms

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.020
of flourishing is something
we'll talk about when we talk

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.330
about moral relativism
in a few weeks.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.020
Good.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.270
Thanks.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.010
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.320
The subject is special
relativity.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.612
And right at the end of last
class, I had written down this

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:20.926
factor, gamma.
And gamma is the key thing,

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:24.080
which tells you how
relativistic you are.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.887
Gamma = 1 over the square root
of [1 - (V^(2) /

00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:33.492
c^(2))].
And we talked about this factor

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:36.787
a little bit.
If V over c is

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:40.728
equal to zero or approaches
zero, then gamma,

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:43.669
obviously, is 1.
And when gamma is 1,

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:46.768
that's the Newtonian
case--then, everything is just

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:53.100
like Newton's law said.
Okay.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.419
On the other hand,
as V over c goes

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:59.946
to 1--that is to say,
as the velocity approaches the

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:02.826
speed of light,
this gamma factor goes to

00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:06.649
infinity, because 1 minus 1 in
the denominator--that's zero in

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.689
the denominator,
so the thing has to go to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.554
infinity.
And then, all these bizarre

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:15.780
relativistic effects start
taking place.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.035
And the one we talked about in
particular came about from an

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:26.700
example of how this gamma is
used--namely,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.240
that the relativistic mass is
equal to gamma times the rest

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.680
mass, which is the Newtonian
mass.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.244
And, obviously,
if gamma = 1,

00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:44.989
then the Newtonian mass is
equal to the--then,

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.145
the mass is equal to the
Newtonian mass,

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:50.129
and you're in Newton's laws,
and everything is fine.

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:53.964
When the velocity approaches
the speed of light,

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:58.371
then this total relativistic
mass goes to infinity--the

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:03.430
consequence of which is that you
can no longer accelerate,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.610
regardless of how much--so,
no more

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.849
acceleration--regardless of how
much force is applied,

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.520
because force equals mass times
acceleration.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.493
And if the mass is infinite,
then any amount of force will

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:23.145
not give you an acceleration.
An acceleration is a change in

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:26.401
velocity, and so,
the consequence of this is that

00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.590
you can't go faster than the
speed of light.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.056
It's also another side
consequence of

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:44.599
this--sorry--there was?
Oh, excellent, yes ask it.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.710
Student: [Inaudible.]
Professor Charles

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.094
Bailyn: V--okay.
V is the velocity that

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:54.674
something is traveling.
There's no escape velocity

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.591
here, at the moment.
There are all kinds of

00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:00.218
different Vs floating
around, so it's important to

00:03:00.218 --> 00:03:02.767
keep them straight.
Yeah, can't--you can't go

00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:06.890
faster than the speed of light.
A side comment from this is

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.475
that photons,
particles of light,

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:12.159
which obviously,
by definition,

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.265
do go at the speed of light,
have to have zero rest

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:20.864
mass--because otherwise they'd
have--they'd end up having

00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:25.546
infinite mass and infinite
energy which isn't--which isn't

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:28.559
physical.
So, photons which go at the

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.264
speed of light,
for which gamma is therefore

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:33.597
infinite,
have to have M--this

00:03:33.597 --> 00:03:36.460
little M_0
here, equal to zero.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.071
So, you have zero times
infinity, and that can equal a

00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:43.070
finite number,
otherwise they'd have infinite

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.020
energy.
Yes?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.527
Student: I was just
wondering if we're talking about

00:03:45.527 --> 00:03:46.879
velocity as a factor or,
like, the speed of light?

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.917
Professor Charles
Bailyn: At the moment what

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.389
I'm talking about is velocity as
a speed.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.360
So, I'm talking about the
magnitude of the velocity.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.719
And you can tell,
actually, that that's the case,

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.979
because it comes in as the
velocity squared.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.353
So, even if it's a vector,
when you square it,

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:05.200
that gives you a scalar
quantity.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.696
Okay.
So, let me go on from here and

00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:17.084
talk about an intermediate case.
We've talked about V

00:04:17.084 --> 00:04:19.500
equals zero, we've talked about
V equals c.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.939
Let me talk about an
intermediate case.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:25.101
And the particular intermediate
case--and this will show up on

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:28.056
your problem set – this is the
thing we didn't get to on

00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:31.211
Thursday.
This is what's called the

00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.190
post-Newtonian approximation.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.420
This is when you're just a tiny
little bit relativistic.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.998
So, V over c, or
more properly,

00:04:45.998 --> 00:04:50.310
V^(2) / c^(2) is
small, but not zero.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.528
And here, a little mathematical
concept that may have flashed

00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:00.850
before your eyes when you were
in eleventh grade,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.626
or something,
comes in, which is the series

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:06.196
expansion.
We won't do the mathematics of

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:09.865
this, but here it is.
If you take 1 plus epsilon

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:13.868
[ε]--and I should say,
epsilon is a--used by

00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:17.690
mathematicians to mean something
small.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.660
Famous mathematician named
Erdos used to refer to children

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.307
as "epsilons."
That seems to be carrying it a

00:05:27.307 --> 00:05:30.761
little bit too far.
But, this is how mathematicians

00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:32.169
think.
So, epsilon,

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.954
in this case,
is something that's much,

00:05:34.954 --> 00:05:37.883
much less than 1.
And if you take 1 plus

00:05:37.883 --> 00:05:41.540
epsilon--so that's a number
that's slightly greater than

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.600
1--and you take it to the
nth power,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.829
you can then expand this as a
series.

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:51.304
And the series goes like this:
1 + n ε,

00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:55.684
plus a bunch of other terms,
each of which is multiplied by

00:05:55.684 --> 00:06:00.014
a higher power of epsilon.
So, there's a term in ε^(2)

00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:03.260
and there's a term in ε^(3),
and so forth.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.061
And this is an infinite series.
But the thing is,

00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.129
if epsilon's small,
then ε^(2) is even smaller.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.887
So, if epsilon's already small
and nε is pretty small,

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:19.930
then ε^(2) is far smaller than
that,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.250
ε^(3) yet smaller,
and these are negligible.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:32.002
And so, the approximation is,
(1 + ε)^(n) is approximately

00:06:32.002 --> 00:06:37.125
equal to 1 + n ε,
if epsilon is much,

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:39.570
much less than 1.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.600
So, here's what we're going to
do.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.296
We're going to use this series
expansion, and we're going to

00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:51.680
generate expressions for some
things--in particular,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.713
the mass, but some other
things, too--where the 1 is the

00:06:55.713 --> 00:06:58.668
Newtonian term.
And the thing represented by

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.048
this n ε,
which is much smaller,

00:07:01.048 --> 00:07:03.550
is a correction to the
Newtonian term,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.067
and is the first sign that
things are becoming

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:11.338
relativistic.
So this is, in this context,

00:07:11.338 --> 00:07:17.868
going to be a Newtonian term,
and this is the post-Newtonian

00:07:17.868 --> 00:07:23.569
approximation.
Okay.

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:29.560
Oh, so, let's just do an
example.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.287
Let's think about the motion of
the Earth--the Earth's orbit

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.412
around the Sun.
Earth's orbit,

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:38.754
you may recall,
from the last section of the

00:07:38.754 --> 00:07:43.004
class, how fast the Earth moves.
It's about 3 x 10^(4) meters

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:48.180
per second.
Thirty kilometers a second.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:54.509
The speed of light is 3 x
10^(8) meters per second.

00:07:54.509 --> 00:08:03.781
And so, V^(2) /
c^(2) = [(3 x 10^(4)) /

00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:11.099
(3 x 10^(8))]^(2) = 10^(-8).
And so, that quantity,

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:16.292
which is going to turn out to
be the post-Newtonian effect,

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:20.500
is one part in 10^(8) for the
Earth's orbit.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.933
And so, pretty small.
Considering that we think that

00:08:23.933 --> 00:08:28.362
9 = 10, something in the eighth
decimal place isn't going to do

00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:32.547
a lot of damage.
So, it's not a particularly

00:08:32.547 --> 00:08:35.793
relativistic situation.
All right, so,

00:08:35.793 --> 00:08:38.730
now I want to go back and I
want--that's just an aside.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:43.960
I want to go back and apply
this approximation to gamma.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.089
Gamma is equal to 1 / (1 -
V^(2) / c^(2)),

00:08:49.089 --> 00:08:52.259
the whole thing to the ½
power.

00:08:52.259 --> 00:08:58.179
That's (1 - V^(2) /
c^(2))^(-1/2).

00:08:58.179 --> 00:09:02.380
I got to get a better pen,
sorry about that.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.235
And now, this can be expanded.
This can be expanded in just

00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:10.000
this kind of way.
The first term is 1.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.110
Epsilon is - V^(2) /
c^(2).

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.516
n is - ½.
Minus times a minus is a

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:22.309
positive, so this is plus 1/2
V^(2) /

00:09:22.309 --> 00:09:25.750
c^(2)--plus additional
terms,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.521
the first of which is
(V^(2) / c^(2))

00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:32.137
^(2),
which in the case of the Earth

00:09:32.137 --> 00:09:36.468
would be 10^(16).
So, it would be vastly smaller

00:09:36.468 --> 00:09:41.063
still, so, we ignore that.
And so that--and so,

00:09:41.063 --> 00:09:45.805
you can substitute this for
gamma in situations where

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:49.985
V is kind of small.
For example,

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:54.720
let's go back to this mass
equation.

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:06.480
1 + 1/2 V^(2) /
c^(2).

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.906
This is the total mass.
Now--oh, let's separate these

00:10:09.906 --> 00:10:12.903
terms out.
M_0 --that's

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:15.506
the Newtonian term.
And now, here's a

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:18.821
post-Newtonian approximation.
1/2 M_0

00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:21.120
V^(2) divided by
c^(2).

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.884
Okay, high school physics
experts, do you recognize this

00:10:30.884 --> 00:10:34.280
term?
Kinetic energy.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.959
Absolutely right.
This is from high school

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:41.313
physics.
The kinetic energy--that is to

00:10:41.313 --> 00:10:45.340
say the energy in the motion of
this object.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.597
So what is this whole term?
This whole term is the kinetic

00:10:50.597 --> 00:10:53.561
energy.
So, M is equal to the

00:10:53.561 --> 00:10:57.480
Newtonian rest mass,
plus the kinetic energy divided

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.787
by c^(2).
Now, you'll recall that

00:11:00.787 --> 00:11:03.679
E / c^(2) =
M.

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:12.759
So, this is the mass equivalent
of the kinetic energy.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:15.888
So, given this nice
relativistic idea that mass and

00:11:15.888 --> 00:11:18.830
energy are interchangeable,
well, here it is.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.090
Here is the kinetic energy
expressed in terms of mass.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:27.161
And so, this little equation
M = M_0

00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:30.169
γ has a variety of
consequences.

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:33.669
When V /
c--V^(2) / C^(2),

00:11:33.669 --> 00:11:37.169
really, goes to zero,
then it's just Newton.

00:11:37.169 --> 00:11:39.360
It just says,
mass equals mass,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.165
because gamma is equal to 1.
And that expresses an important

00:11:43.165 --> 00:11:45.615
Newtonian concept,
that the mass of something is

00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:47.700
an intrinsic property of that
object,

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.778
which doesn't change--which is
how things are in Newton,

00:11:50.778 --> 00:11:53.129
but not how things are
relativistically.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:56.314
In the other extreme,
where V^(2) /

00:11:56.314 --> 00:12:00.653
c^(2) approaches 1,
this equation expresses the

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:04.980
fact that light--the speed of
light is a speed limit.

00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:11.829
And in the post-Newtonian case
where V^(2) /

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:14.423
c^(2) is small,
but not zero,

00:12:14.423 --> 00:12:19.341
this same expression expresses
the fact that E =

00:12:19.341 --> 00:12:24.335
mc^(2).
So, all three of these concepts

00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:30.182
come out of the same equation.
It's this kind of thing that

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:35.073
makes physicists say things
like, the theory of relativity

00:12:35.073 --> 00:12:39.282
is incredibly beautiful.
It's hard to know--I realize,

00:12:39.282 --> 00:12:42.220
it's hard to know what that
means, you know.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.149
What makes a piece of
mathematics beautiful?

00:12:44.149 --> 00:12:48.145
It's when you get a situation
like this, where a simple

00:12:48.145 --> 00:12:52.216
mathematical concept sort of
spawns all kinds of new and

00:12:52.216 --> 00:12:55.229
unexpected ideas,
depending on how you look at

00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:57.940
it--and that they all kind of
come together as one.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.142
I have this vivid memory in
graduate school,

00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:03.011
I was sitting in a class,
you know, and the professor was

00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:05.009
doing the thing that professors
do.

00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:08.156
He was writing down all kinds
of miscellaneous information

00:13:08.156 --> 00:13:10.695
really, really fast,
from relativity theory and

00:13:10.695 --> 00:13:13.205
nuclear physics.
All sorts of stuff was going up

00:13:13.205 --> 00:13:15.024
on the board.
I was doing the thing that

00:13:15.024 --> 00:13:17.485
students do, where you
desperately try and write it all

00:13:17.485 --> 00:13:19.329
down,
so that you can then go back

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:22.340
and figure out what the hell he
was talking about later.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.064
And suddenly,
in the midst of this rather

00:13:25.064 --> 00:13:28.062
typical class,
I realized what was happening:

00:13:28.062 --> 00:13:31.794
that in about twenty minutes,
he was going to put all this

00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:34.340
stuff together and prove
Chandrasekhar's limit.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.179
We talked about Chandrasekhar's
limit a week or so ago.

00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:40.738
That's the limit whereby a
white dwarf can't be bigger then

00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:44.419
1.4 times the mass of the Sun or
it continues to collapse.

00:13:44.419 --> 00:13:47.878
And, I suddenly saw where all
this was going and I sort of

00:13:47.878 --> 00:13:51.214
wrote down in my notebook,
"Chandra," and underlined it,

00:13:51.214 --> 00:13:53.990
put my pencil down.
And then, I just watched for

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.929
twenty minutes.
It was great.

00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:59.455
It was--the only thing I can
compare it to is listening to a

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:02.503
great piece of music,
because it kind of unfolds in

00:14:02.503 --> 00:14:05.735
time, and you see where it's
going, and it's just a great

00:14:05.735 --> 00:14:08.087
feeling.
So, don't be condescending to

00:14:08.087 --> 00:14:11.462
the physics majors when they're
working like hell on those

00:14:11.462 --> 00:14:13.889
problem sets late on a Thursday
night,

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:17.719
because they have access to
realms of aesthetic experience

00:14:17.719 --> 00:14:22.109
that you can only imagine.
But perhaps--it's true,

00:14:22.109 --> 00:14:26.263
it's true, I promise.
But you have to work hard to

00:14:26.263 --> 00:14:29.435
get there and ask questions.
So, at this point,

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:34.431
let's do the question thing.
Here's what I'd like to do:

00:14:34.431 --> 00:14:38.970
talk to the people around you.
Introduce yourself to the

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.220
people around you--groups of
two, three or four will do fine.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.468
And come up,
in consultation with your

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:48.629
neighbors, with a question to
ask.

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:50.809
Now, this could either be a
question of something that you

00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:52.529
guys don't understand about what
I've said,

00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:55.918
or something where the
question, if answered,

00:14:55.918 --> 00:15:00.230
would deepen your understanding
beyond what I've said.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.130
So, take a couple minutes.
Talk to your neighbors.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.424
Make a friend.
Think of a question,

00:15:05.424 --> 00:15:09.094
and in a couple minutes' time,
we'll regroup and I'll answer

00:15:09.094 --> 00:15:11.913
some of the questions.
If your particular question

00:15:11.913 --> 00:15:14.582
doesn't end up being answered,
you know, hand it in at the

00:15:14.582 --> 00:15:16.659
end,
so that I know what you were

00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:19.720
thinking of--and so,
definitely write them down.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.750
And we'll try this out.
Let's see how this goes.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.624
So, introduce yourself to your
neighbors and come up with a

00:15:26.624 --> 00:15:28.870
question.
And when you have it,

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:33.910
put your hand up and ask it.
We'll come around and ask.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.361
All right.
I've now heard the same

00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:38.919
question twice,
so let me answer it,

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:41.769
and then we'll ask for other
things.

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:45.170
The same question,
which has been asked in a

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.730
couple of different ways,
is, what is mass?

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.217
That's an excellent question,
because it's awfully hard to

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:55.888
parse what's going on with this
M_0 and this

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:59.187
other kind of M,
and stuff, if you don't know

00:15:59.187 --> 00:16:01.672
what the concept means.
So, that's a really good

00:16:01.672 --> 00:16:03.509
question.
What's mass?

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:09.110
Mass is defined--you can think
of it this way.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.930
What is mass?

00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:21.510
Mass is defined as from this
equation, in a certain sense.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.263
F = ma.
It tells you,

00:16:24.263 --> 00:16:27.848
for a given object,
how hard it is to move--or,

00:16:27.848 --> 00:16:31.590
more precisely,
how hard it is to accelerate.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:43.833
So, higher mass requires
greater force to accelerate by a

00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:49.833
certain amount.
It's a property of an object,

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:54.399
and it tells you how much it
resists being pushed around.

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:59.280
It's sometimes referred to as
"inertial mass" for this reason.

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:06.425
It's an expression of the
object's inertia--how much it

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:10.544
resists being accelerated.
And so, in Newtonian physics,

00:17:10.544 --> 00:17:14.009
this is purely a property of
the object itself.

00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:16.359
You can say,
if you've got a basketball,

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.527
or if you've got a car,
or something,

00:17:18.527 --> 00:17:21.600
that the car has more mass than
the basketball.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.464
Why?
Because if I go--do I have a

00:17:24.464 --> 00:17:25.950
basketball?
I don't.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.363
All right, car,
a car has--the lectern has more

00:17:29.363 --> 00:17:32.627
mass than the little piece of
cardboard here,

00:17:32.627 --> 00:17:37.079
because if I apply force to the
cardboard I can move it.

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:39.519
And if I apply the same amount
of force to the lectern,

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:42.460
I move it a whole lot less.
And so, what is the difference

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.829
between those two things since
the force applied is the same?

00:17:45.829 --> 00:17:48.519
The difference is that this one
has a whole lot more mass.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:52.222
And in Newtonian physics,
the mass is a property of the

00:17:52.222 --> 00:17:54.538
object.
In Einsteinian physics,

00:17:54.538 --> 00:17:58.894
there is something that's the
property of the object--that's

00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:01.541
its rest mass.
But the inertial mass,

00:18:01.541 --> 00:18:04.261
the amount by which it resists
being pushed,

00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:07.108
is also a property--not just of
the rest mass,

00:18:07.108 --> 00:18:10.522
but also of its motion.
So, if this were moving at a

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:14.160
large fraction of the speed of
light and I applied some kind of

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.931
force to it,
it wouldn't move nearly as much

00:18:16.931 --> 00:18:19.615
as it does--or,
it wouldn't change its motion

00:18:19.615 --> 00:18:22.910
nearly as much as it does when
it's standing still.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:29.657
And so mass--the inertial mass
of the thing varies depending on

00:18:29.657 --> 00:18:34.435
how fast it's moving.
So, that's an important

00:18:34.435 --> 00:18:40.549
question for understanding this.
Let's see--yes?

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:42.420
Student: Let's say that
you're on Earth.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.439
If you were to push an object
that's standing still versus an

00:18:44.439 --> 00:18:45.987
object in motion,
you're going to have the same

00:18:45.987 --> 00:18:47.036
affect on it?
Professor Charles

00:18:47.036 --> 00:18:48.059
Bailyn: No,
you're not going to have the

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:50.627
same effect on it,
because if the object in motion

00:18:50.627 --> 00:18:54.029
is going to have a little extra
piece to its mass.

00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:55.113
Student:
Okay, so it has a very small

00:18:55.113 --> 00:18:56.071
effect [inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.130
Bailyn: A very,
very small effect.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.660
In fact, if you try this on the
Earth itself,

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.019
which is moving at 30
kilometers a second,

00:19:02.019 --> 00:19:04.779
that effect is going to be 1
part in 10^(8).

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:10.070
So, that's what we calculated
before, where we--where was it?

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.369
Yeah, here it is.
That's this purple part here.

00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:20.829
You calculate V^(2)
/ c^(2),

00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:23.208
that's 10^(-8).
So, it's a difference if

00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:26.789
something moving even as fast as
30 kilometers a second,

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:30.123
which is pretty fast--this
difference is only going to

00:19:30.123 --> 00:19:32.640
be--actually,
1/2 of 1 part in 10^(8).

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.650
So, it's a hard thing to see.
Now, the place you can see this

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.993
stuff is in particle
accelerators,

00:19:39.993 --> 00:19:42.373
because there,
you can take sub-atomic

00:19:42.373 --> 00:19:45.330
particles and accelerate them to
very close to the speed of

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.549
light.
And then you see these very

00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:52.569
dramatic effects.
Yes?

00:19:52.569 --> 00:19:54.706
Student: So,
if something's going at the

00:19:54.706 --> 00:19:56.656
speed of light,
so that the force you would

00:19:56.656 --> 00:19:58.700
need to stop it is infinite
[inaudible]?

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.288
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes,

00:20:00.288 --> 00:20:02.384
yes, that's correct.
You cannot stop something

00:20:02.384 --> 00:20:04.994
that's going at the speed of
light, because the force you'd

00:20:04.994 --> 00:20:07.997
need to accelerate it,
which could either be a--making

00:20:07.997 --> 00:20:10.420
it faster or slower,
would be infinite.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:16.059
But, that's why photons don't
have any rest mass at all.

00:20:16.059 --> 00:20:19.806
That statement that you made
only applies to something which

00:20:19.806 --> 00:20:22.599
has non-zero--greater than zero
rest mass.

00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:24.009
Student: And they never
go?

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:25.532
Professor Charles
Bailyn: And they never go to

00:20:25.532 --> 00:20:26.996
the speed of light,
because you can't get them that

00:20:26.996 --> 00:20:28.647
fast.
You'd need an infinite amount

00:20:28.647 --> 00:20:30.370
of force to get it to go that
fast.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.087
Photons are a different story.
And, of course,

00:20:33.087 --> 00:20:35.079
if you stop a photon,
it disappears.

00:20:35.079 --> 00:20:38.274
Because if it's going less than
the speed of light,

00:20:38.274 --> 00:20:41.532
then it's got no energy,
because it's a finite gamma

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:45.579
times zero rest mass.
Yes?

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:46.590
Student: What about all
the weird, like,

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.359
time stuff you always hear
about?

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:48.639
Professor Charles
Bailyn: The weird time stuff

00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:51.310
you always hear about.
Excellent.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.405
Yeah, okay.
A couple of other Lorentz

00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:56.597
transformations.
Time is equal to gamma times

00:20:56.597 --> 00:20:59.990
time zero.
This is time dilation.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:05.099
The faster you go,
the slower your clock works.

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:07.328
This is the origin of all that
nice science fiction,

00:21:07.328 --> 00:21:10.026
where you get on a rocket ship.
You go close to the speed of

00:21:10.026 --> 00:21:11.069
light.
You go somewhere.

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.715
You turn around.
You come back.

00:21:12.715 --> 00:21:16.379
Your clocks are running slow,
so, it only takes a year in

00:21:16.379 --> 00:21:18.271
your time.
And you come back and

00:21:18.271 --> 00:21:20.750
everybody--you know,
a hundred years have passed.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.089
All your friends are dead,
and so forth.

00:21:22.089 --> 00:21:23.730
So, that's a whole science
fiction thing.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.550
There's also length contraction.
That looks like this.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:37.867
Take the pen. Put it in motion.
Make that motion at some

00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:40.462
substantial fraction,
at the speed of light,

00:21:40.462 --> 00:21:45.480
and it gets shorter.
Amazing.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.460
We'll talk more about this in a
little while.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.752
Yeah, these are--these things
with the gammas in them,

00:21:53.752 --> 00:21:57.480
they're collectively known as
the Lorentz transformations.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:06.665
That's just a name.
And these are the ways in which

00:22:06.665 --> 00:22:15.316
basic properties--space,
time, mass--change with

00:22:15.316 --> 00:22:18.630
velocity.
Yeah?

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.094
Student: So with the
equation, M =

00:22:21.094 --> 00:22:22.930
M_0 times
gamma.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.039
M_0 is the
intrinsic mass?

00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:26.789
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes.

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:28.940
No, no, no,
M_0--yes.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.843
Let me think.
M_0 is the

00:22:31.843 --> 00:22:34.230
intrinsic mass.
M is the inertial mass.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.782
Student: Okay.
Professor Charles

00:22:35.782 --> 00:22:36.869
Bailyn: That's a way of
thinking about it.

00:22:36.869 --> 00:22:39.880
Student: So,
if something was traveling at a

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.169
very small speed,
wouldn't it mean that

00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:45.180
V^(2) / c^(2) was
close to zero?

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.150
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.117
Student: Which means the
inertial mass would be close to

00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:49.317
zero?
Professor Charles

00:22:49.317 --> 00:22:51.351
Bailyn: No.
If it goes--so,

00:22:51.351 --> 00:22:54.270
you were right up to the very
end.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.358
Remember how this works.
γ = 1 / [(1 - V^(2) /

00:22:58.358 --> 00:23:02.752
c^(2))^(1/2)]
If V / c goes to

00:23:02.752 --> 00:23:06.822
zero, gamma goes to 1.
And in that case,

00:23:06.822 --> 00:23:12.329
the inertial mass is equal to
the intrinsic mass.

00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:15.863
And, if it's going faster,
then the inertial mass is

00:23:15.863 --> 00:23:19.609
bigger than the intrinsic mass.
The intrinsic mass is usually

00:23:19.609 --> 00:23:21.877
referred to as the rest mass.
Student: Well,

00:23:21.877 --> 00:23:23.680
then how did you get
V^(2) / c^(2)?

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.769
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Ah.

00:23:24.769 --> 00:23:28.670
That's the second term of the
series expansion.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:33.798
1 / [(1 - V^(2) /
c^(2))^(1/2)]

00:23:33.798 --> 00:23:39.975
expands to be 1 + 1/2
V^(2) / c^(2) plus

00:23:39.975 --> 00:23:43.549
other terms.
Here's the first term.

00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:45.688
That's the rest mass,
because we're going to multiply

00:23:45.688 --> 00:23:49.960
this by M.
And this is then the kinetic

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.542
energy divided by c^(2).
Student: So the

00:23:54.542 --> 00:23:55.376
[inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:23:55.376 --> 00:23:56.238
Bailyn: It's the second
term.

00:23:56.238 --> 00:23:57.664
Student: [inaudible]
inertial mass can never be

00:23:57.664 --> 00:23:58.526
zero.
It'll just go closer to the

00:23:58.526 --> 00:23:59.485
front?
Professor Charles

00:23:59.485 --> 00:24:00.819
Bailyn: Yeah,
the rest mass doesn't change.

00:24:00.819 --> 00:24:02.793
If V^(2) / c^(2)
goes to zero,

00:24:02.793 --> 00:24:06.049
what happens is,
the kinetic energy goes to

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:10.255
zero, which is exactly what you
want it to do.

00:24:10.255 --> 00:24:12.773
Yes?
Student: How does--how

00:24:12.773 --> 00:24:16.180
is momentum conserved when
something's relativistic?

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.489
Professor Charles
Bailyn: How is momentum

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:18.660
conserved when something's
relativistic?

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.450
Excellent.
There is an equation of

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.283
relativistic momentum.
And it's that thing that's

00:24:25.283 --> 00:24:30.990
conserved, which is different
from M times V,

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.365
because V behaves
differently and M behaves

00:24:33.365 --> 00:24:35.303
differently.
And you can work out exactly

00:24:35.303 --> 00:24:38.326
where all the gammas go in that,
and I don't remember it off the

00:24:38.326 --> 00:24:40.963
top of my head.
But there is a quantity that is

00:24:40.963 --> 00:24:44.453
conserved, but it doesn't look
quite the same as the Newtonian

00:24:44.453 --> 00:24:47.619
quantity.
In the limit where the velocity

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:51.387
is small, it reduces down.
The first term of that series

00:24:51.387 --> 00:24:56.500
is M times V.
Yes sir?

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.553
Student: When you define
mass by the equation force

00:24:59.553 --> 00:25:01.375
equals mass times the
acceleration,

00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:03.677
how, then, do you define force?
Professor Charles

00:25:03.677 --> 00:25:04.190
Bailyn: Yeah,
okay.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:08.509
So, this gets a little bit
circular, right?

00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:11.580
Okay.
Force--you can define it either

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.781
way.
Force is the thing that--force

00:25:13.781 --> 00:25:16.900
is the ability to do work.
That's the technical definition.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:27.668
Force: ability to do work.
And then, work also has a

00:25:27.668 --> 00:25:30.627
technical definition.
The problem with these things

00:25:30.627 --> 00:25:33.692
is you kind of do--if you just
define them all around the

00:25:33.692 --> 00:25:35.619
circle,
they do tend to come back and

00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:38.339
bite themselves in the tail.
I agree with that.

00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:43.990
But force is also related to
energy.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.210
How much energy is required to
exert a certain force?

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.548
So, all these things,
interrelate--but it is

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:52.865
definitely true that there's a
circularity to the definitions,

00:25:52.865 --> 00:25:55.150
if you follow them all the way
around.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.246
So, if you keep asking that
kind of question,

00:25:58.246 --> 00:26:02.680
I'm going to go around until I
get back where I started from.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.470
Yes?
Student: Why is the

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.269
speed of light constant in all
frames?

00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:09.966
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Why is the speed of

00:26:09.966 --> 00:26:11.430
light constant in all frames of
reference?

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.704
That's problem two of your
problem set, and I'll come--I'll

00:26:15.704 --> 00:26:19.390
say a few things--that's an
insufficient answer,

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.634
but I'll come back and say a
little bit more about that in a

00:26:22.634 --> 00:26:25.029
minute.
Yes?

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:28.426
Student: We were just a
little bit confused with the

00:26:28.426 --> 00:26:30.710
original Lorentz
transformation--how,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.472
in most cases,
that transforms to E =

00:26:33.472 --> 00:26:36.779
mc^(2).
Could you show that to us?

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:37.789
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah.

00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:40.730
So, let's go back and take
another look at that.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.859
All right, so,
here's what I'm going to do.

00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:50.779
First of all,
I'm going to take gamma--this

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:53.490
quantity--and I'm going to
expand it.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.190
This is equal to gamma,
and now I'm going to expand it.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.950
That gives me 1 + 1/2
V^(2) / c^(2).

00:27:03.619 --> 00:27:06.694
Let's see what have I done with
the--my--the pieces of paper are

00:27:06.694 --> 00:27:08.110
getting out of order,
here.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:13.303
Here it is.
So, inertial mass is equal to

00:27:13.303 --> 00:27:15.160
the rest mass,
times gamma.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.712
So, now, I'm going to
substitute in this approximation

00:27:17.712 --> 00:27:20.137
for gamma.
And then, I'm going to multiply

00:27:20.137 --> 00:27:22.579
M_0 through
both terms.

00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:25.371
So this is--so,
the inertial mass is equal to

00:27:25.371 --> 00:27:28.289
the Newtonian mass,
plus a term that looks like

00:27:28.289 --> 00:27:32.126
this.
One half M V

00:27:32.126 --> 00:27:38.660
squared is, in Newtonian terms,
the kinetic energy.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.410
And it appears here,
divided by c^(2).

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:46.851
And so, a way you can write
this is that the inertial mass

00:27:46.851 --> 00:27:50.748
is equal to the rest mass,
plus the kinetic energy,

00:27:50.748 --> 00:27:55.426
divided by c^(2).
And that is an example of the

00:27:55.426 --> 00:28:00.334
fact that energy divided by
c^(2) is another way of

00:28:00.334 --> 00:28:03.241
expressing mass.
Student: Then,

00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:06.208
how is it not saying that
energy over c^(2)

00:28:06.208 --> 00:28:09.660
equals--why is it not from the
energy of c^(2),

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.801
literally, algebraically,
whether it be M minus

00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:11.920
M_0 [inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.365
Bailyn: Oh,
which M are you talking

00:28:14.365 --> 00:28:15.480
about?
Student: Yes.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.764
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yeah,

00:28:17.764 --> 00:28:21.529
its M_0 here,
and it's M over here.

00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:23.754
And so, somebody
asked--actually you're now the

00:28:23.754 --> 00:28:26.704
second person who's asked this
question, so I better answer it

00:28:26.704 --> 00:28:29.278
explicitly.
I answered the question,

00:28:29.278 --> 00:28:32.569
"What is mass?"
What's energy?

00:28:32.569 --> 00:28:37.090
E = mc^(2)
squared.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:41.553
So, what do I mean by this?
M--this is the inertial

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:42.280
mass.

00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:48.625
So, that's M,
which is equal to,

00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:51.900
in this case,
M_0 plus

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.090
kinetic energy over
c^(2).

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.450
And notice the difference here.
This is one kind of energy.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:03.901
This is kinetic energy.
That's the energy in--that's

00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:07.079
the energy contained in the
motion.

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:14.944
Another way you could write
this is the rest energy over

00:29:14.944 --> 00:29:18.006
c^(2).
So E,

00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:21.693
here, is the total energy.
And there are two kinds of

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:24.857
energies being expressed here.
There's a rest energy,

00:29:24.857 --> 00:29:27.813
divided by c^(2),
and there's a kinetic energy,

00:29:27.813 --> 00:29:30.415
divided by c^(2).
But in the Newtonian case,

00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:32.269
you think of them as two
completely different

00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:35.313
things--whereas,
in the relativistic case,

00:29:35.313 --> 00:29:39.262
they're two manifestations of
the same thing,

00:29:39.262 --> 00:29:42.672
and they add to make the
inertial mass.

00:29:42.672 --> 00:29:44.316
Yes?
Student: At what

00:29:44.316 --> 00:29:46.424
velocity are a fractions of
c-- would something need

00:29:46.424 --> 00:29:48.314
to be traveling on Earth for us
to--for there to be a

00:29:48.314 --> 00:29:50.181
perceptible relativistic effect?
Professor Charles

00:29:50.181 --> 00:29:52.589
Bailyn: Okay.
So, how fast do you have to go

00:29:52.589 --> 00:29:55.369
to have a perceptible
relativistic effect?

00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:57.720
That depends how good your
instruments are.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.925
If you've got something that
can perceive--that can measure a

00:30:01.925 --> 00:30:05.990
velocity or an energy or a mass
to eight decimal places,

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.089
then it doesn't have to go so
fast.

00:30:08.089 --> 00:30:10.937
If you have something that's
fairly crude,

00:30:10.937 --> 00:30:14.650
then it has to go much faster.
But I should say--special

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.095
relativity, these Lorentz
transformations,

00:30:17.095 --> 00:30:21.029
have been measured upside down
and backwards in the laboratory.

00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:23.430
This work to many,
many decimal places.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.696
Here's an example.
If you take sub-atomic

00:30:26.696 --> 00:30:29.970
particles that are unstable,
that decay--they have a half

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.777
life, so, half of them will
decay in ten seconds,

00:30:32.777 --> 00:30:35.153
or something.
And you take those particles,

00:30:35.153 --> 00:30:37.799
and you accelerate them to a
large fraction of the speed of

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:40.313
light.
It takes much longer for them

00:30:40.313 --> 00:30:44.666
to decay, because they're going
so fast and their time clocks

00:30:44.666 --> 00:30:47.566
slow down.
One manifestation of this is,

00:30:47.566 --> 00:30:51.343
there's a kind of unstable
particle that's created at the

00:30:51.343 --> 00:30:54.410
top of the atmosphere.
These things are called "muons."

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.529
What happens is,
cosmic rays come in.

00:30:56.529 --> 00:30:57.880
They blast the top of the
atmosphere.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.899
They make these muon things.
The muons propagate close to

00:31:00.899 --> 00:31:03.559
the speed of light,
and they arrive at Earth.

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:05.676
And you can measure,
if you have a little muon

00:31:05.676 --> 00:31:08.546
detector--never mind what the
heck a muon is--but imagine that

00:31:08.546 --> 00:31:11.039
you have something that could
detect it on Earth,

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:13.569
and you see a whole bunch of
these things caused by cosmic

00:31:13.569 --> 00:31:14.867
rays.
But, if you ask,

00:31:14.867 --> 00:31:18.014
how long did it take them to
get from the top of the

00:31:18.014 --> 00:31:21.099
atmosphere down to where your
muon detector is,

00:31:21.099 --> 00:31:24.029
it's much, much longer than
their decay time.

00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:26.030
So, you really shouldn't see
any of them at all.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.523
But you do see them.
And the reason is because

00:31:28.523 --> 00:31:30.500
they're going at close to the
speed of light.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.956
And so this is--these effects
are observed and measured to

00:31:35.956 --> 00:31:42.084
great accuracy in the laboratory
and in astrophysical situations.

00:31:42.084 --> 00:31:44.208
Yes?
Student: I know it's

00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:46.823
practically impossible,
but what would happen here if

00:31:46.823 --> 00:31:49.640
we--if you were to go faster
than the speed of light?

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.418
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Faster than the

00:31:50.418 --> 00:31:53.104
speed of light?
Well, you'd have super infinite

00:31:53.104 --> 00:31:56.300
mass.
This would not be good.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:02.289
Well, okay.
So, let us imagine what the

00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:05.285
equations would do.
What would happen is,

00:32:05.285 --> 00:32:08.214
as you go faster than the speed
of light, if you try and slow

00:32:08.214 --> 00:32:11.289
down toward the speed of light,
you'd have the same problem.

00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:13.678
That is to say,
it would take you more and more

00:32:13.678 --> 00:32:16.430
effort to slow down to close to
the speed of light.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.885
And the consequence of this is
that if you're faster than the

00:32:18.885 --> 00:32:20.563
speed of light,
you can't slow down to the

00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:22.200
speed of light,
or slower than that.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.673
There are hypothetical
particles--and this doesn't

00:32:24.673 --> 00:32:27.247
exist in the real world--but,
there are hypothetical

00:32:27.247 --> 00:32:29.970
particles that do this.
These are called tachyons.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:34.634
They have the odd effect that
they go backwards in

00:32:34.634 --> 00:32:39.298
time--because again,
if you believe the equations,

00:32:39.298 --> 00:32:41.910
right?
Time dilation.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:47.790
T = γ
T_0.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.048
Now, look at gamma.
Square root of 1 - V^(2)

00:32:51.048 --> 00:32:53.940
/ c^(2).
So, this is awkward.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.210
If V is bigger than
c, this is a square root

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:02.839
of a negative number.
That becomes imaginary. Right?

00:33:02.839 --> 00:33:05.310
Square root of a negative
number--hard to do.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.672
So, this becomes imaginary.
So, your time axis becomes

00:33:07.672 --> 00:33:10.307
imaginary, and all sorts of very
bad things start to happen to

00:33:10.307 --> 00:33:13.549
you.
Yeah, yes?

00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:15.992
Student: So,
as your mass increases with

00:33:15.992 --> 00:33:19.177
velocity, do you just--does the
particle or the entity have a

00:33:19.177 --> 00:33:21.550
greater gravitational effect?
Professor Charles

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.320
Bailyn: Does it have a
greater gravitational effect?

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.819
Excellent question.
That's the next lecture,

00:33:26.819 --> 00:33:29.400
because that's general
relativity.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.748
And what you're doing is you're
assuming that Newtonian gravity

00:33:33.748 --> 00:33:36.751
is correct.
Newtonian gravity--gravity is a

00:33:36.751 --> 00:33:40.559
force proportional to the mass.
Turns out--and this is one of

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:43.516
the things that led Einstein to
his theory of general

00:33:43.516 --> 00:33:46.190
relativity--turns out that
relativistically,

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.892
it's--that gravity should not
be thought of as a force,

00:33:49.892 --> 00:33:52.599
at all.
And there's a whole different

00:33:52.599 --> 00:33:56.418
way of thinking about it,
and your question has to be,

00:33:56.418 --> 00:33:58.940
in a kind of Zen sense,
unasked.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.890
We'll get to that.
We will get to that.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:05.550
But the point is that,
in relativistic theory,

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.559
gravity is not a force,
anymore.

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:11.543
And so, the question doesn't
arise in quite the same way.

00:34:11.543 --> 00:34:14.238
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible.]

00:34:14.238 --> 00:34:17.480
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Sorry?

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.650
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:27.489
Bailyn: E =
M_0 /

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:31.449
c^(2) + K.E.
Yeah.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:34.028
You have to put--you have to
get the c squareds in the

00:34:34.028 --> 00:34:36.349
right place, and that's
basically a unit conversion.

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:38.219
Student: What's
K.E. / c^(2)?

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.883
Professor Charles
Bailyn: No,

00:34:39.883 --> 00:34:41.880
E - Student: Oh,
E.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.695
Professor Charles
Bailyn: - is equal to

00:34:45.695 --> 00:34:48.578
c^(2)
M_0 +

00:34:48.578 --> 00:34:51.032
K.E.
Basically, what I've done is

00:34:51.032 --> 00:34:53.610
I've multiplied this equation by
c^(2) on both sides.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:35:04.412
Yeah. Yes?
Student: I don't know if

00:35:04.412 --> 00:35:07.564
this is really a worthwhile
question, but,

00:35:07.564 --> 00:35:10.485
what is--what are the
implications for,

00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:13.041
like, what time is?
Professor Charles

00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:14.679
Bailyn: Well,
this is the-- Student:

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:16.210
If you have one meaning of what
time is?

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.118
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Right.

00:35:17.118 --> 00:35:18.289
So, what are the implications
for what time is?

00:35:18.289 --> 00:35:21.999
This is the big stumbling
block, from a philosophical

00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:24.710
point of view,
to all of this stuff.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.217
Turns out, time isn't absolute.
That is to say,

00:35:28.217 --> 00:35:31.999
one has the feeling,
as we go through our everyday

00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:34.446
life, that,
you know, my watch and your

00:35:34.446 --> 00:35:37.329
watch are kind of measuring more
or less the same thing,

00:35:37.329 --> 00:35:39.949
to the extent that they're
accurate to do so.

00:35:39.949 --> 00:35:42.959
So, if we have identical,
perfectly accurate watches,

00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:45.679
and we go about our daily life
and come back,

00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:48.193
they're going to read the same
time at the end if they read the

00:35:48.193 --> 00:35:50.017
same time at the
beginning--because time moves

00:35:50.017 --> 00:35:51.760
the same way for me as it does
for you.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:57.450
This turns out to be false.
And so, time is not an absolute

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.619
quantity.
Neither is space,

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:01.890
for that matter,
because length changes also.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.282
This is quite disturbing.
And the reason it's so

00:36:06.282 --> 00:36:09.345
disturbing to us is our brains
have evolved in a situation

00:36:09.345 --> 00:36:11.280
where we're always moving
really,

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.280
really slowly compared to the
speed of light.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.600
And therefore,
you don't have to worry about

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.298
this stuff in everyday life,
down to some factor of

00:36:18.298 --> 00:36:20.340
10^(-12).
But, nevertheless,

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.508
it turns out to be true that
time does not tick off in an

00:36:24.508 --> 00:36:27.169
absolute way.
And this is why people get so

00:36:27.169 --> 00:36:29.702
freaked out by this
stuff--because it seems counter

00:36:29.702 --> 00:36:33.410
to everyday experience.
But, it can be measured.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:37.478
And it turns out to be true.
So, the Newtonian case,

00:36:37.478 --> 00:36:40.734
what we're used to and the way
our brains work,

00:36:40.734 --> 00:36:44.557
turns out to be only an
approximation of the way things

00:36:44.557 --> 00:36:47.518
really are.
There are other things that are

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:49.760
conserved, no matter how fast
you go.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:57.051
And we can get to that at some
point--but time isn't one of

00:36:57.051 --> 00:36:58.559
them.
Yes?

00:36:58.559 --> 00:37:01.518
Student: Why is the
speed of light this magic

00:37:01.518 --> 00:37:03.234
number?
Professor Charles

00:37:03.234 --> 00:37:06.640
Bailyn: Why is the speed of
light this magic number?

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.982
Okay.
So, the fact that there is a

00:37:10.982 --> 00:37:17.619
magic number comes out of this
kind of equation.

00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:22.022
Because, when this quantity is
equal to 1, bad things start to

00:37:22.022 --> 00:37:24.909
happen, and all the equations
blow up.

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:29.612
The fact that it is the speed
of light that happens to be

00:37:29.612 --> 00:37:33.894
that, in that equation,
is because light consists of

00:37:33.894 --> 00:37:38.642
particles with zero rest mass.
And a particle at zero rest

00:37:38.642 --> 00:37:42.918
mass has to have this thing go
to infinity or it doesn't exist

00:37:42.918 --> 00:37:45.832
at all.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:37:45.832 --> 00:37:49.766
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Why is the world

00:37:49.766 --> 00:37:51.360
this way?
Student: Well

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.306
[inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:37:52.306 --> 00:37:54.013
Bailyn: That I--no,
seriously, that's what you're

00:37:54.013 --> 00:37:55.809
asking, and it's a good
question, and I can't answer it.

00:37:55.809 --> 00:37:59.121
You know, because this is where
physics turns into--seriously,

00:37:59.121 --> 00:38:01.510
this is where physics turns
into theology.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:06.911
You can't--all you can say from
science is that this is the way

00:38:06.911 --> 00:38:10.065
it works.
You can't answer the "why"

00:38:10.065 --> 00:38:11.804
question.
You got to talk to my

00:38:11.804 --> 00:38:14.019
colleagues in some other
department about that one.

00:38:14.019 --> 00:38:16.876
I'm sorry, because it's the
question one would really like

00:38:16.876 --> 00:38:18.429
to know the answer to,
right?

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:24.119
But that one I can't cope with.
Yes?

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:26.158
Student: Thinking about
black holes, when the light

00:38:26.158 --> 00:38:27.909
enters the black hole across the
event horizon,

00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:31.190
I've heard that it often times
orbits or may orbit Jupiter?

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:35.199
How is that possible if the
light doesn't have mass?

00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:36.946
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:38:36.946 --> 00:38:39.307
so, the question is,
can light go into orbit around

00:38:39.307 --> 00:38:42.530
a black hole?
Basically.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.273
And the answer is, yes it can.
And then, the next part of the

00:38:45.273 --> 00:38:47.694
question was,
how does that work if it

00:38:47.694 --> 00:38:50.856
doesn't have any mass?
You're asking the same question

00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:53.220
he did over there,
because what keeps it in orbit

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.383
is gravity.
And if you reject the view that

00:38:56.383 --> 00:38:59.974
gravity is a force,
then that question doesn't

00:38:59.974 --> 00:39:03.259
become important.
And we'll--as I say,

00:39:03.259 --> 00:39:06.958
we'll talk about that later.
So, that, again,

00:39:06.958 --> 00:39:11.014
is a question that pops up
because you're thinking of

00:39:11.014 --> 00:39:14.601
gravity as a force.
Student: How does--with

00:39:14.601 --> 00:39:17.158
that equation,
not to say "why," if it is,

00:39:17.158 --> 00:39:19.840
why it is, but where--how is it
derived?

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.576
Professor Charles
Bailyn: How is it derived?

00:39:21.576 --> 00:39:24.362
Okay.
So, let me go on with the

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:29.956
presentation in the last couple
of minutes of the class,

00:39:29.956 --> 00:39:31.242
here.
Here's--so, let me ask your

00:39:31.242 --> 00:39:35.322
question in a different way.
Here's what--why did Einstein

00:39:35.322 --> 00:39:39.143
think this up?
What a crazy-ass thing to do,

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:40.833
right?
Why not--there's little

00:39:40.833 --> 00:39:43.947
discrepancies when things are
moving at the--at high speeds,

00:39:43.947 --> 00:39:46.450
but who the heck cares?
It's hard to measure things at

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.479
high speeds.
Why not just stick with Newton,

00:39:48.479 --> 00:39:51.210
which has done very well for
two-and-a-half centuries?

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.107
Here was the problem.
In the late nineteenth century,

00:39:54.107 --> 00:39:57.119
there were a whole series of
experiments, all of which,

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:01.361
one way or another,
had the same

00:40:01.361 --> 00:40:08.203
consequence--namely,
that light--the speed of light

00:40:08.203 --> 00:40:13.950
is the same in all--for all
observers.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.840
Okay?
That's extraordinarily weird.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.000
It's not obvious immediately
why that's so weird.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.945
But let me try and explain it.
Here's a guy,

00:40:26.945 --> 00:40:30.737
and let's say he's a baseball
pitcher, and he's throwing a

00:40:30.737 --> 00:40:32.531
ball.
So, here's the ball and it's

00:40:32.531 --> 00:40:34.738
moving this way at some
velocity, which we'll call

00:40:34.738 --> 00:40:36.884
V_1.
And you're down here,

00:40:36.884 --> 00:40:39.420
or over here somewhere,
it doesn't really matter.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.146
You're down here,
and you've got a radar gun,

00:40:42.146 --> 00:40:45.120
and you measure the velocity of
that baseball.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.732
How fast is it going?
Well, if he throws it at

00:40:47.732 --> 00:40:49.667
V_1,
and you're at rest with respect

00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:51.489
to him, then you measure
V_1.

00:40:51.489 --> 00:40:56.495
Now, supposing we put our
pitcher on top of a moving

00:40:56.495 --> 00:41:00.853
train, all right?
And the train is moving at some

00:41:00.853 --> 00:41:03.909
other velocity,
V_2.

00:41:03.909 --> 00:41:06.320
So, the guy's on top of the
train.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.295
He throws it 100 miles an hour.
The train's moving at 100 miles

00:41:09.295 --> 00:41:11.275
an hour.
You're standing next to the

00:41:11.275 --> 00:41:14.289
track with your radar gun.
How fast do you measure that

00:41:14.289 --> 00:41:17.230
baseball to move?
Well, you measure a total

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.722
velocity, which is the sum of
the velocity of the baseball

00:41:21.722 --> 00:41:26.057
with respect to the train,
and the train with respect to

00:41:26.057 --> 00:41:27.240
you.
Okay?

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:33.077
That seems pretty clear.
But now, supposing this

00:41:33.077 --> 00:41:36.409
guy--instead of throwing a
baseball, he's got a flashlight.

00:41:36.409 --> 00:41:39.815
So he's got some light source,
and the light is moving at the

00:41:39.815 --> 00:41:42.311
speed of light,
because that's the speed that

00:41:42.311 --> 00:41:45.097
light moves.
And you've got some device,

00:41:45.097 --> 00:41:49.199
down here, which measures how
fast that light moves along.

00:41:49.199 --> 00:41:51.780
And he's standing at rest with
you.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.681
And you measure the speed of
light, and it comes out to be

00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:57.429
c--not surprisingly,
the same speed of light.

00:41:57.429 --> 00:41:58.909
Now, let's put the guy on the
train.

00:41:58.909 --> 00:42:02.445
Here he is, moving at
V_2,

00:42:02.445 --> 00:42:05.746
or any V.
You would expect that the speed

00:42:05.746 --> 00:42:09.203
of light that this guy measures
down here would be c +

00:42:09.203 --> 00:42:10.989
V_2.
Right?

00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:13.850
Because, it would the speed of
light with respect--from the

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.760
flashlight, with respect to the
train, plus the speed of the

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.597
train, with respect to you.
You would expect it to be

00:42:19.597 --> 00:42:21.480
c plus
V_2.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:27.185
But it isn't. It's c.
V_total =

00:42:27.185 --> 00:42:31.390
c, not c +
V_2.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:36.149
Very weird.
The speed of light is the same

00:42:36.149 --> 00:42:40.119
no matter how fast you're moving
relative to the source.

00:42:40.119 --> 00:42:43.527
You could be moving at 99% of
the speed of light,

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:47.148
toward a light source,
and it would not be coming at

00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:50.059
you at 1.99 times the speed of
light.

00:42:50.059 --> 00:42:52.630
It would be coming towards you
at the speed of light.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.062
You could have a friend who's
standing still,

00:42:55.062 --> 00:42:58.269
and you would both measure the
same speed of that light,

00:42:58.269 --> 00:43:00.894
even though you're moving
really fast compared to your

00:43:00.894 --> 00:43:02.909
friend.
Very strange.

00:43:02.909 --> 00:43:05.679
And there are a whole series of
experiments, the most famous of

00:43:05.679 --> 00:43:08.360
which is something called the
Michelson-Morley experiment,

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.050
which, one way or another
demonstrated that this was the

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.420
case.
What to do?

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:20.130
And, what Einstein did was,
he said, hmmm.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:24.130
Okay, various things were tried.
The experiments were wrong.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.500
The equations were slightly
screwy, who knows.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.280
But Einstein took--Einstein's
great genius was to take this

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.279
seriously, and to say,
okay something is really

00:43:33.279 --> 00:43:36.730
screwed up with velocities.
What is velocity?

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:45.369
Velocity is space over
time--miles per hour.

00:43:45.369 --> 00:43:50.039
Therefore--so,
space and time are messed up

00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:54.820
when you get close to the speed
of light.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.410
Now, of course,
it also has to be true that

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:03.026
when you're going slowly,
the original Newtonian result

00:44:03.026 --> 00:44:07.309
is recovered.
So, this is your problem set.

00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:10.712
I have written down the
relativistic formula for the

00:44:10.712 --> 00:44:14.575
addition of velocities.
And your problem set is going

00:44:14.575 --> 00:44:18.813
to be to use that series
expansion to demonstrate that in

00:44:18.813 --> 00:44:21.690
the Newtonian limits,
you get this.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:27.186
And in the limit where one or
the other of those velocities is

00:44:27.186 --> 00:44:30.340
the speed of light,
you get this.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.475
So, you'll see.
The algebra's actually not so

00:44:33.475 --> 00:44:35.457
bad.
And that's what prompted

00:44:35.457 --> 00:44:39.752
Einstein to go on this whole
rampage, generating all of these

00:44:39.752 --> 00:44:43.301
gammas, and so forth.
It was the experimental

00:44:43.301 --> 00:44:47.840
evidence that there's a serious
problem with velocities.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.000
Okay, we got to stop.
More next time.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.462
Prof: Okay. So a
quick review of what we covered

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:13.170
on Thursday in the first of
these two lectures in which I'm

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.910
going to be talking about the
war.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.217
And hopefully,
as you hopefully remember,

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:25.097
we began by talking about the
British and the logic of their

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:27.330
actions during the war.
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.468
And I talked for a little while
about a number of their

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:35.684
logistical disadvantages:
like problems getting supplies

00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:40.360
and then dragging them all over
the American countryside;

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.349
like the large expanse of land
that the British confronted that

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:46.730
was one big battlefield in a
sense;

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.062
the ways in which some kind of
traditional battle strategies,

00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:54.383
war strategies,
didn't necessarily work so well

00:00:54.383 --> 00:00:57.405
in this campaign;
and along the same lines,

00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:01.079
that there were different kinds
of challenges that the British

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.728
faced in fighting against a
citizen army.

00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:07.751
I talked about how Britain
couldn't turn its back on the

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.750
rest of the world,
particularly France.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.844
They had to keep an eye on what
France was doing and France--as

00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:16.691
you're going to see in today's
lecture--is going to play a

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:17.438
large role.
 

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:21.409
And then finally I talked about
the simple fact that for the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.846
British to win,
they needed to stamp out a

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:29.299
widespread rebellion over a
large expanse of land,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.626
while the Americans didn't
necessarily have to defeat the

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:34.470
British to emerge victorious.
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.051
They just had to keep fighting
long enough to exhaust British

00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:41.800
supplies and funding and
energies.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.890
And I also mentioned a few
mistaken assumptions on the part

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.772
of the British,
like the way that they

00:01:48.772 --> 00:01:52.000
consistently underestimated the
Americans,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.343
and then along similar lines,
the ways in which they

00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:59.343
consistently overestimated the
amount of Loyalist support that

00:01:59.343 --> 00:02:02.489
they were expecting to find in
the colonies.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.134
And I spent time in Thursday's
class going into those kinds of

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:09.718
details before talking about
phases of war and strategies and

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:13.304
things like that because they
help us to understand the logic

00:02:13.304 --> 00:02:16.650
of British military strategies
throughout the war.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.964
I think it's really easy to
look back on any historical

00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:20.686
event--
but I think it's particularly

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:23.360
true for the American Revolution
that leads to the American

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.884
founding--
it's easy to look back and

00:02:25.884 --> 00:02:29.068
blame the loser for making dumb
mistakes,

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:32.817
but there were really logical
reasons for what the British did

00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:34.229
during this campaign.
 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.587
And that's part of what I'm
trying to bring out in last

00:02:36.587 --> 00:02:38.378
week's lecture and in today's
lecture,

00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:41.566
that there were logical
logistical reasons why they did

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.508
what they did.
 

00:02:42.508 --> 00:02:45.663
There were equally logical
reasons as to why the war

00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:48.258
ultimately had the outcome that
it did,

00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:51.806
but all of those things that I
talked about in the last lecture

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:55.068
at the start show how the
British were acting under pretty

00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:58.043
challenging circumstances and
they were guiding their

00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:01.189
decisions and doing whatever
they decided to do based on

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.310
whatever information and insight
and tradition they had at hand.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.377
So their actions have a logic,
and I bring that up at the

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:11.447
start of this lecture because
it's part of what I've been

00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:15.008
doing overall in this class over
the course of the semester,

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:17.121
and that is,
throughout whatever I've been

00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:20.878
lecturing about,
I've tried to explain the logic

00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:25.720
and reasoning behind people's
choices and decisions,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.370
to give you a view of unfolding
events from the viewpoints of

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.830
people who were there.
 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.037
Now of course it's just
inherently interesting to look

00:03:33.037 --> 00:03:35.411
at historical events from the
viewpoint of people who were

00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.811
there,
so that's part of the reason

00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:38.758
why I do this--
because it's interesting and

00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:40.620
it's fun and I find it
fascinating--

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.680
but more important,
I actually take this approach

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.633
because I want to emphasize the
idea that the Revolution wasn't

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:48.590
inevitable.
 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.250
It wasn't an inevitable event.
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.930
It wasn't a good revolt against
bad people.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.292
It was actually a product of
individual choices,

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:02.082
individual actions on all
sides, and that's ultimately

00:04:02.082 --> 00:04:04.229
what history is all about.
 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.580
Right?
 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.968
It's about people making
choices and then taking action,

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:10.788
and particularly in the case of
the American founding period,

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:13.068
I think it's an important thing
to remember,

00:04:13.068 --> 00:04:16.346
because it's easy to forget
that the Revolution and its

00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:19.439
aftermath weren't inevitable or
inherently right.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:21.310
It has to do with our nation's
founding,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.910
so it's natural to sort of
assume those things,

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.370
but neither one of those things
helps us to really understand

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.139
what was unfolding as the
Revolution unfolded.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.100
So basically,
in all of my classes,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.910
I always try to counter the
sort of seeming inevitability of

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.915
things in the founding period by
really trying to re-create the

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:43.209
logic of decisions at that time
in that moment.

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:46.487
So that's part of why I've been
focusing in that way throughout

00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:47.279
the semester.
 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.586
But okay, back to the decisions
of the Revolution and Thursday's

00:04:51.586 --> 00:04:52.269
lecture.
 

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:56.519
The bulk of my lecture on
Thursday was spent discussing

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:00.139
three of the four phases of the
Revolution,

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.949
and again hopefully you
remember I defined these phases

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.899
based on shifts in British
strategy at various points.

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:09.800
So the British would shift
their strategy,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.956
the Americans would respond,
and then that phase would

00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:16.470
continue until there'd be a new
shift and a new response.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.896
Just to review very briefly
here, the first phase lasted

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:23.634
until roughly July of 1776 and
was largely guided on the part

00:05:23.634 --> 00:05:27.559
of the British by the assumption
that just a little coercion and

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.923
maybe a little sign of
reconciliation would be all that

00:05:30.923 --> 00:05:34.785
the Americans needed to sort of
push them into backing away and

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:37.339
would bring matters to a close.
 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:40.459
That phase lasted through July
1776,

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:44.245
and at that point the British
stepped up their strategy by

00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:48.019
deciding to seize New York,
seemingly one of the major

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:50.728
cities in the colonies--
and again, by sort of

00:05:50.728 --> 00:05:53.550
traditional war standards,
you get a major city,

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.805
you turn the tide of war--
plus, the British were hoping

00:05:56.805 --> 00:05:59.336
that if they could sort of
separate New England from the

00:05:59.336 --> 00:06:02.190
rest of the colonies they might
isolate the troublemakers up in

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.990
New England and again,
maybe that would draw things to

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.720
a close.
 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.685
In part, at that point the
British were underestimating the

00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:14.923
intercolonial and interregional
bonds that were beginning to be

00:06:14.923 --> 00:06:18.000
forged throughout the conflict
thus far,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.266
and they also were
overestimating what it would

00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:25.028
mean along those same lines to
isolate New England.

00:06:25.028 --> 00:06:26.750
So that strategy obviously
didn't end things,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.050
which leads us to the third
phase, which began in 1777,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.598
and that phase largely
consisted of the British trying

00:06:35.598 --> 00:06:40.290
to subdue the middle colonies--
well, now states by 1777.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.226
Again, sort of the basic
assumption being let's keep

00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:46.483
going for those major cities,
and if we get enough of those

00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:48.629
major cities they're going to
have to cave.

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:51.725
So now Philadelphia and
Pennsylvania become major

00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:53.660
targets in this third phase.
 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.843
And then I ended the lecture by
talking about America's shocking

00:06:57.843 --> 00:07:00.300
victory at the Battle of
Saratoga,

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.528
which ended up being a real
turning point in the war.

00:07:03.528 --> 00:07:06.536
And I'm going to go a little
bit more into that--reasons why

00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:07.810
that's the case--today.
 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.240
But I do want to mention--at
the very end,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.689
after I finished my lecture on
Thursday,

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:15.709
a few people came up to me with
questions about precisely how

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:18.954
the Americans won at Saratoga,
because I just sort of

00:07:18.954 --> 00:07:21.209
generally talked about problems
with supplies,

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:23.810
and then the Americans won,
and a few people had questions:

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.430
Well,
what actually really happened?

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.059
So I'll offer just a little bit
more detail here to give you a

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:32.271
sense of how it is that the
Americans came to have this

00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:33.639
unexpected victory.
 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.139
So remember at that point,
British General Howe is headed

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:40.766
off to Philadelphia as part of
the major sort of attempt of

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:45.310
that third phase of the war,
so General John Burgoyne is up

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.005
north with his army,
and lo and behold part of the

00:07:49.005 --> 00:07:51.529
Continental Army under Horatio
Gates--

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:55.430
General Horatio Gates--attacks
Burgoyne,

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.329
and Gates' part of the army is
joined by another part of the

00:07:59.329 --> 00:08:02.699
Continental Army led by General
Benjamin Lincoln.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:06.699
Also, militiamen from nearby
areas,

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:09.901
individually and in groups,
began heading to Saratoga when

00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:13.158
they sort of got a sense that
something major was happening

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:13.720
there.
 

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.557
So by October 7 of 1777,
there were roughly 11,000

00:08:18.557 --> 00:08:24.382
American troops all told facing
roughly 5,000 British troops

00:08:24.382 --> 00:08:26.259
under Burgoyne.
 

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:29.694
So now Burgoyne is in a little
bit of trouble and Howe couldn't

00:08:29.694 --> 00:08:32.629
help him because he's down in
the South somewhere,

00:08:32.629 --> 00:08:35.610
and for a little while Burgoyne
thought that there might be

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.129
another group of British
soldiers led by Sir Henry

00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:39.928
Clinton coming to save the day.
 

00:08:39.928 --> 00:08:43.799
Clinton and his men did not
come to the rescue.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.009
So Burgoyne is in trouble.
 

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:49.671
And to give you just a little
sense of what I'm talking about

00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:53.211
here, here's a quote from a
British lieutenant who actually

00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:54.918
took part in the battle.
 

00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:57.678
And he writes that on October 7
in his regiment,

00:08:57.678 --> 00:09:00.928
quote, "Our cannon were
surrounded and taken--

00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:03.440
the men and horses being all
killed--

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.528
which gave them [the Americans]
additional spirits,

00:09:06.528 --> 00:09:08.639
and they rushed on with loud
shouts,

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:11.644
when we drove them back a
little way with so great loss to

00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:13.831
ourselves,
that it evidently appeared a

00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.298
retreat was the only thing left
for us."

00:09:16.298 --> 00:09:16.586
Okay.
 

00:09:16.586 --> 00:09:19.916
So that's a British soldier
taking part, describing massive

00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:20.490
deaths.
 

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.414
The Americans get cheered by
what's happening and sort of

00:09:23.414 --> 00:09:26.445
surge, and the British come to
the realization that they're

00:09:26.445 --> 00:09:27.960
going to have to retreat.
 

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.145
So Americans ultimately wage a
war on the actual fort at

00:09:32.145 --> 00:09:35.418
Saratoga and ultimately breech
the fort,

00:09:35.418 --> 00:09:39.220
and Burgoyne withdrew his army
to the heights of Saratoga.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.470
He lost roughly 600 men,
which was about four times the

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.720
number of Americans that are
killed in that battle,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.955
and that's the moment where
Burgoyne meets with his chiefs

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:52.303
of staff and decides that at
this point what they need to do

00:09:52.303 --> 00:09:53.779
is actually surrender.
 

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:56.605
And I mentioned at the very end
of Thursday's lecture the

00:09:56.605 --> 00:09:59.634
surrender ceremony when both
sides were sort of so shocked at

00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:02.650
what was unfolding that they--
everyone was sort of quiet and

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.558
the Americans sort of had their
eyes down,

00:10:04.558 --> 00:10:07.442
supposedly because they
couldn't quite believe what was

00:10:07.442 --> 00:10:08.990
happening in front of them.
 

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.567
Now I'm going to mention one
last fact regarding Saratoga

00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:16.019
that I just sort of stumbled
across today actually,

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:19.313
but I thought it was really
interesting because it relates

00:10:19.313 --> 00:10:22.783
back to my earlier point about
the British overestimating the

00:10:22.783 --> 00:10:26.019
amount of Loyalist support that
they had in America.

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:29.676
After he lost the battle,
Burgoyne ends up going back to

00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:33.331
England and he ends up getting
examined by Parliament to

00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:36.389
explain exactly what happened at
Saratoga.

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:38.129
That must have been really fun
for Burgoyne.

00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:42.741
And here are just one or two
sentences from his testimony

00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:44.389
before Parliament.
 

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:47.788
He said, "Would the Tories
have risen?

00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:50.601
Why did they not rise round
Albany and below it at the time

00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:52.928
they found Mr. Gates' army
increasing?"

00:10:52.928 --> 00:10:53.769
("Mr."
 

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:55.500
Gates, not General Gates'
army.)

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.529
"A critical insurrection
from any one point of the

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:01.278
compass within distance to
create a diversion,

00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:04.590
would probably have secured the
success of the campaign."

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.678
So there is Burgoyne talking to
Parliament and saying,

00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:09.860
'Where were the Tories?'--like:
just a little action,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.222
some diversion on the part of
American Tories might have saved

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:14.950
the day,
but where were they?

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.428
I didn't--They weren't there.
 

00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:19.133
So he's puzzled,
and he's partly blaming that

00:11:19.133 --> 00:11:21.100
for what happened at Saratoga.
 

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.048
So the victory at Saratoga
accomplished important things

00:11:26.048 --> 00:11:27.220
militarily.
 

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.567
Of course, psychologically it
was a tremendous victory for the

00:11:30.567 --> 00:11:33.696
Americans after a series of
somewhat less inspiring battle

00:11:33.696 --> 00:11:36.732
moments,
but in many ways the most

00:11:36.732 --> 00:11:42.123
important impact of the Battle
of Saratoga was on the world

00:11:42.123 --> 00:11:42.960
stage.
 

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.261
Because when news of the battle
reached Europe in December of

00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:51.340
1777,
it gave some credibility to the

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.207
American cause,
particularly in France,

00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:58.096
which the Americans had already
been eyeing as a potential

00:11:58.096 --> 00:12:00.620
source of support during the
war--

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.482
and that makes sense given
France's long-standing enmity to

00:12:04.482 --> 00:12:05.149
England.
 

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:07.970
It makes perfect sense that the
Americans think:

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.750
hmm, maybe the French are going
to come aid us as we're fighting

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.788
against their long-time enemy.
 

00:12:13.788 --> 00:12:19.047
Now Franklin--Benjamin Franklin
was in Paris at this point when

00:12:19.047 --> 00:12:21.928
the news begins to reach Europe.
 

00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:24.058
He is serving as an American
ambassador,

00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:27.532
and while he's in France,
he proved that among his many

00:12:27.532 --> 00:12:30.331
talents,
he had an amazing talent at

00:12:30.331 --> 00:12:33.702
self-promotion,
because although he was an

00:12:33.702 --> 00:12:37.628
extremely cultured American,
he was incredibly shrewd at

00:12:37.628 --> 00:12:40.110
playing "the American"
in Paris.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.562
Basically, he knew what the
French sort of expected

00:12:42.562 --> 00:12:44.928
Americans to be like,
and they thought Americans were

00:12:44.928 --> 00:12:46.269
going to be these sort of
simple,

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:49.799
pure, virtuous,
natural backwoodsmen.

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:51.308
So there's Franklin.
 

00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:54.955
He's in the splendor--the grand
splendor of the French court and

00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:57.731
he dressed really,
really simply--and many of you

00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:59.700
have probably seen this image.
 

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.943
He always wore this sort of fur
cap like: 'I just went out and

00:13:02.943 --> 00:13:05.870
killed myself an animal and now
I'm wearing this hat.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.418
[laughter]
I'm a backwoods philosopher.'

00:13:08.418 --> 00:13:11.452
It was--Basically,
the role he was playing was the

00:13:11.452 --> 00:13:14.548
sort of amazing rustic,
natural, backwoods American

00:13:14.548 --> 00:13:15.538
philosopher.
 

00:13:15.538 --> 00:13:18.184
He continually presented
himself in that way,

00:13:18.184 --> 00:13:21.673
which really stood out among
all the splendor of the French

00:13:21.673 --> 00:13:24.500
court, and the French absolutely
adored it.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.288
He became a sort of fad of the
French court.

00:13:28.288 --> 00:13:30.889
There were countless portraits
and images made of him.

00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:32.419
He was put on dishes.
 

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:34.990
He was put on medallions.
 

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.785
As Franklin himself put it,
"My Face is now almost as

00:13:37.785 --> 00:13:39.700
well known as that of the
Moon."

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.094
Right?
 

00:13:40.094 --> 00:13:42.200
They just adored him in France.
 

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.038
Apparently, Franklin also knew
how to enjoy himself in France,

00:13:46.038 --> 00:13:50.370
because a little later in the
war one of Washington's aides

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.178
was sent to France to control
Franklin [laughs]--

00:13:54.178 --> 00:13:56.490
to sort of keep him from having
a little bit too much fun.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.336
Let's just say that Franklin,
who was in his seventies at

00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:01.693
this point,
so he's advanced in age,

00:14:01.693 --> 00:14:05.668
Franklin liked the ladies and
the ladies liked Franklin,

00:14:05.668 --> 00:14:07.860
and particularly given that he
was the fad of the court,

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.269
I think Franklin had a very
enjoyable time in Paris.

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:12.621
[laughs]
And so Washington--one of

00:14:12.621 --> 00:14:14.918
Washington's aides actually gets
sent to sort of baby-sit

00:14:14.918 --> 00:14:15.820
Benjamin Franklin.
 

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.644
Now all of this adulation of
Franklin irked John Adams,

00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:23.908
surprise, surprise.
 

00:14:23.908 --> 00:14:25.945
[laughter]
John Adams really sort of on

00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:29.158
some fundamental level thought
that he deserved some too,

00:14:29.158 --> 00:14:33.798
and Franklin was so beloved it
really proved irksome to Adams.

00:14:33.798 --> 00:14:37.649
He kept a diary and in the
diary he tended to record

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:41.638
adulation moments of Franklin,
like: here's another one of

00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:44.470
those darn moments where they
just loved this guy.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.357
And I want to offer one just so
you can get a sense of what this

00:14:47.357 --> 00:14:49.513
would have been like,
I guess both for Adams and

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:50.110
Franklin.
 

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.351
This is from Adams' diary,
from his journal,

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:57.350
from April 29,1778,
and this is what Adams writes:

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.450
"After dinner we went to
the Academy of Sciences.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.350
Voltaire and Franklin were both
present,

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.269
and there presently arose a
general Cry that Monsieur

00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:08.528
Voltaire and Monsieur Franklin
should be introduced to each

00:15:08.528 --> 00:15:09.090
other.
 

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.970
This was done and they bowed
and spoke to each other.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.600
This was no Satisfaction.
 

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.408
There must be something more.
 

00:15:15.408 --> 00:15:18.456
Neither of our Philosophers
seemed to divine what was wished

00:15:18.456 --> 00:15:19.178
or expected.
 

00:15:19.178 --> 00:15:21.309
They, however,
took each other by the hand .

00:15:21.309 --> 00:15:22.730
But this was not enough.
 

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.234
The Clamor continued,
until the explanation came out

00:15:25.234 --> 00:15:27.690
'Il faut s'embrasser � la
fran�aise.'"

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.043
Right?
 

00:15:28.043 --> 00:15:30.759
They have to embrace themselves
French style.

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:34.049
"The two Aged Actors upon
this great Theater of Philosophy

00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:36.279
and frivolity then embraced each
other,

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:38.913
by hugging one another in their
Arms and kissing each others

00:15:38.913 --> 00:15:40.938
cheeks,
and then the tumult

00:15:40.938 --> 00:15:42.269
subsided."
 

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:46.428
So there's Franklin's sort of
everyday existence in Paris,

00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:48.399
which was pretty extreme.
 

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:49.830
So Franklin is there,
living it up in Paris.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.399
He's there when news of
Saratoga reaches France.

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:57.698
On hearing the news,
France decides ultimately that

00:15:57.698 --> 00:16:00.865
they're going to formally
recognize America as an

00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:04.442
independent nation,
obviously with Franklin and

00:16:04.442 --> 00:16:07.320
Adams and others helping things
along.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.192
And upon recognizing America as
an independent nation,

00:16:11.192 --> 00:16:15.211
the French went one step
further and agreed to enter the

00:16:15.211 --> 00:16:17.769
war as allies to the Americans.
 

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.332
So obviously,
Saratoga happens,

00:16:19.332 --> 00:16:21.726
the news gets to Europe,
France hears it,

00:16:21.726 --> 00:16:23.947
and those are two major
developments:

00:16:23.947 --> 00:16:26.600
France recognizes American
independence;

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.610
France joins the war on the
side of the Americans.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.647
With this agreement,
these really major two

00:16:34.647 --> 00:16:37.160
agreements,
for the first time there seemed

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.018
to be a remote possibility that
the Americans might actually

00:16:40.018 --> 00:16:41.808
have a chance of being
victorious.

00:16:41.808 --> 00:16:45.408
This is a major,
major ally that's just signed

00:16:45.408 --> 00:16:47.490
up on the American side.
 

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.315
Not only did the French bring
credibility to the American

00:16:51.315 --> 00:16:53.729
cause,
but of course they also brought

00:16:53.729 --> 00:16:55.919
military supplies,
and most important of all,

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:58.059
as we're going to see a little
later in the lecture,

00:16:58.059 --> 00:17:00.100
they brought the French navy.
 

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.429
America at this point is still
figuring out how to have a navy,

00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:07.990
so having the French navy was
of huge importance.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:13.118
Now it's important to note at
this point that it's not--

00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:16.271
the dynamic here isn't that the
French were so inspired by the

00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:19.269
nobility of the American cause
that they decided they would

00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:21.130
join the war with the Americans.
 

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.000
There--That is true for some
French individuals.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.240
I'll talk a little bit more
later on in the lecture about

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.318
the Marquis de Lafayette.
 

00:17:27.318 --> 00:17:30.852
He's one of a number of people
who actually were inspired by

00:17:30.852 --> 00:17:32.108
the American cause.
 

00:17:32.108 --> 00:17:34.926
But as a nation,
the French were particularly

00:17:34.926 --> 00:17:38.640
eager to help the Americans
because they assumed that after

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.481
the war they might be able to
take over much of the lucrative

00:17:42.481 --> 00:17:46.578
trade with America that the
British had controlled before.

00:17:46.578 --> 00:17:49.375
So basically,
joining America in this war

00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:53.570
effort was an investment now
that they thought would probably

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.605
pay off later,
and of course add to that the

00:17:56.605 --> 00:18:00.193
fact that by allying themselves
with the Americans they're now

00:18:00.193 --> 00:18:03.250
fighting their long-term,
long-time enemy,

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.797
the British,
so that makes it an attractive

00:18:06.797 --> 00:18:08.740
proposition as well.
 

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:16.349
So in February of 1778,
France signed two treaties with

00:18:16.349 --> 00:18:17.759
America.
 

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:24.236
The first was the Treaty of
Amity and Commerce that said

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:30.594
that France recognized the
United States as a sovereign

00:18:30.594 --> 00:18:31.890
nation.
 

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.766
It also said that France had
trading privileges with America

00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:39.116
as a favored nation,
but America preserved the right

00:18:39.116 --> 00:18:40.298
of free trade.
 

00:18:40.298 --> 00:18:44.971
Second, France signed the
Treaty of Alliance that would go

00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:49.233
into effect if war erupted
between England and France

00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:53.926
because of the first treaty,
which indeed it did five months

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.765
later,
so basically the first Treaty

00:18:55.765 --> 00:18:58.886
of Amity and Commerce is signed,
Britain and France now decide

00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:01.278
they're warring,
and then France says, 'Okay.

00:19:01.278 --> 00:19:03.578
Now the Treaty of Alliance is
going into effect.

00:19:03.578 --> 00:19:06.950
We are now officially allied
with America.'

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.467
The stated purpose of the
Treaty of Alliance was to assure

00:19:10.467 --> 00:19:12.057
the,
quote, "liberty,

00:19:12.057 --> 00:19:14.964
Sovereignty,
and independence absolute and

00:19:14.964 --> 00:19:18.278
unlimited of the [said]
United States."

00:19:18.278 --> 00:19:23.069
France renounced claims to the
mainland of North America east

00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:26.584
of the Mississippi or to the
Bermuda Islands,

00:19:26.584 --> 00:19:28.740
if captured by America.
 

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.286
In return, France asked the
United States to recognize

00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:35.700
whatever France might capture in
the West Indies.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.061
In other words,
if France captures some British

00:19:38.061 --> 00:19:40.115
islands in the West Indies,
America says,

00:19:40.115 --> 00:19:40.630
'Fine.
 

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.250
[laughs]
We'll recognize that for sure.'

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.119
America was given a free hand
to conquer Canada.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:50.519
[laughs] Yay.
 

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:52.019
[laughs] Conquer Canada.
 

00:19:52.019 --> 00:19:54.078
Good thing we got that in the
treaty.

00:19:54.078 --> 00:20:00.094
And then both sides agreed not
to negotiate for peace without

00:20:00.094 --> 00:20:02.400
consent of the other.
 

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.525
So now you've got Britain and
France in war against one

00:20:07.525 --> 00:20:10.343
another,
and with that the American

00:20:10.343 --> 00:20:13.480
Revolution becomes something of
a world war,

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.135
because Spain and the Dutch
ultimately join on the side of

00:20:17.135 --> 00:20:17.970
the French.
 

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.772
So now Europe and European
powers and their own disputes

00:20:22.772 --> 00:20:28.099
also end up playing a role in
who's siding with who during the

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:29.410
Revolution.
 

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.855
Now it's really important to
note at this point that with the

00:20:32.855 --> 00:20:35.210
involvement of other European
nations,

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.568
and particularly with the
involvement of France,

00:20:38.568 --> 00:20:43.548
America became far less of a
central concern to the British,

00:20:43.548 --> 00:20:47.740
who now felt compelled to send
thousands of soldiers to the

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.210
West Indies to guard against
French invasion,

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:56.582
which means that less manpower
was available to fight in the

00:20:56.582 --> 00:20:58.038
United States.
 

00:20:58.038 --> 00:21:00.426
The West Indies,
or what at the time that would

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:03.384
have been known as the Sugar
Islands, were the truly great

00:21:03.384 --> 00:21:05.720
prizes as far as colonies were
concerned.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.848
They were greater prizes than
the North American colonies.

00:21:08.848 --> 00:21:12.450
That's where the real money
was, in these Sugar Islands,

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:17.029
so some British manpower very
naturally went right to the

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:21.528
Indies to protect British
properties from the French.

00:21:21.528 --> 00:21:24.055
At this point,
feeling a little desperate

00:21:24.055 --> 00:21:26.769
because of the French-American
alliance,

00:21:26.769 --> 00:21:30.769
the British actually make one
last stab at reconciliation--

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:33.509
they are persistent--though as
we'll see in a few minutes,

00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:37.438
they made some misjudgments
that ultimately did not achieve

00:21:37.438 --> 00:21:39.470
the success of this attempt.
 

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:44.722
On February 17,1778,
Lord North proposed in the

00:21:44.722 --> 00:21:50.318
House of Commons the
Conciliatory Propositions.

00:21:50.318 --> 00:21:56.328
The Conciliatory Propositions,
February 17,1778.

00:21:56.328 --> 00:22:01.146
And the Propositions called for
the repeal of all of the acts

00:22:01.146 --> 00:22:03.876
that Americans had found
obnoxious.

00:22:03.876 --> 00:22:04.680
Right?
 

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.480
'Okay.
 

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.338
We'll take it all back.'
 

00:22:07.338 --> 00:22:11.118
No standing army in time of
peace in the colonies;

00:22:11.118 --> 00:22:15.077
no changes in colonial charters
unless colonial assemblies

00:22:15.077 --> 00:22:18.381
request them;
England would agree to consider

00:22:18.381 --> 00:22:21.298
American representation in
Parliament,

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:24.371
or if Americans preferred,
to recognize the American

00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:26.660
Congress as a permanent
institution.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.048
Right?
 

00:22:27.048 --> 00:22:30.548
Suddenly England's like:
'okay, we'll take back all the

00:22:30.548 --> 00:22:33.400
things you hate if we just end
this now.'

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.680
Based on those propositions,
the Conciliatory Propositions,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.390
a British commission was sent
to America with instructions to

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.740
deal with the Continental
Congress--

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.460
or by this point,
in a sense also could be called

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.269
the Confederation Congress,
but I'll talk more about the

00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:51.214
Confederation later on--
to deal with the Continental

00:22:51.214 --> 00:22:53.798
Congress as if it was a legal
body,

00:22:53.798 --> 00:22:57.029
but Congress refused to appoint
commissioners to meet with the

00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:58.298
British commissioners.
 

00:22:58.298 --> 00:23:01.833
Instead, they considered the
propositions on their own in

00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:05.429
Congress and then sent a letter
with their response to the

00:23:05.429 --> 00:23:07.068
British commissioners.
 

00:23:07.068 --> 00:23:08.878
As Henry Laurens,
who's the President of the

00:23:08.878 --> 00:23:11.259
Congress at the time,
put it in this letter:

00:23:11.259 --> 00:23:13.940
"The Acts of the British
Parliament,

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.319
the Commission for Your
Sovereign"-- right?

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:20.655
"Your" Sovereign,
not our Sovereign--"and

00:23:20.655 --> 00:23:22.875
Your Letter,
suppose the People of these

00:23:22.875 --> 00:23:24.970
States to be Subjects of the
Crown of Great Britain,

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.818
and are founded on the Idea of
dependence,

00:23:27.818 --> 00:23:30.838
which is utterly
inadmissible."

00:23:30.838 --> 00:23:34.098
And Laurens then went on to add
that if the British wanted,

00:23:34.098 --> 00:23:37.210
the Americans would be happy to
talk about peace,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.128
if the King would either admit
American independence or

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:42.400
withdraw all of its forces from
America.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.826
So, 'If the British are ready
to do that,' the Americans say,

00:23:44.826 --> 00:23:46.118
'we're willing to talk to you.
 

00:23:46.118 --> 00:23:48.738
Otherwise no,
we're not willing to admit that

00:23:48.738 --> 00:23:50.880
we're dependent on you in any
way.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.309
This is utterly inadmissible.
 

00:23:52.309 --> 00:23:54.548
Take them back.'
 

00:23:54.548 --> 00:23:58.142
So clearly it's too late for
what could have been some pretty

00:23:58.142 --> 00:23:59.519
radical propositions.
 

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:03.200
At this point,
we come to the misjudgments,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.930
because the British commission
made a fatal error when they

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.190
realized that that angle wasn't
going to work.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:11.625
They tried to bribe some
high-ranked American officials

00:24:11.625 --> 00:24:15.916
including George Washington,
who they offered to make a duke

00:24:15.916 --> 00:24:19.578
if George Washington would agree
to their terms.

00:24:19.578 --> 00:24:22.922
As one of the commissioners put
it, "Washington is

00:24:22.922 --> 00:24:26.078
certainly to be bought--honours
will do it."

00:24:26.078 --> 00:24:28.954
And I'm assuming that the
commission somewhere or other is

00:24:28.954 --> 00:24:31.980
thinking back to Washington and
the French and Indian War and

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.259
he's an ambitious guy and he
actually wants military honors,

00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:37.400
so the British are thinking:
'we can buy him'--

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.660
like: 'show him a couple honors;
he's an ambitious guy;

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.848
we've got him.'
 

00:24:41.848 --> 00:24:45.400
They also attempted to bribe
Franklin as well.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.503
Again, showing some misjudgment
on the part of the British

00:24:48.503 --> 00:24:52.075
towards either one of those men,
and also assuming clearly how

00:24:52.075 --> 00:24:54.890
wonderfully attractive British
honors would be,

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.108
that they would easily seduce
either one of these two men.

00:24:58.108 --> 00:25:00.440
Neither one of them was
attracted to this;

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.880
British honors were not going
to sway them from their cause.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.509
So not surprisingly,
both sides of this British

00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:11.528
effort were a complete flop.
 

00:25:11.528 --> 00:25:17.648
Now we're about to advance to
the fourth and final phase of

00:25:17.648 --> 00:25:20.131
the war,
but I do want to mention

00:25:20.131 --> 00:25:23.048
something else that happened in
the winter of 1777,

00:25:23.048 --> 00:25:24.759
before I move on to this fourth
phase,

00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:30.858
and that is the American army's
encampment at Valley Forge.

00:25:30.858 --> 00:25:35.666
There, Americans for a time had
really serious problems getting

00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:36.519
supplies.
 

00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:39.723
Supplies are always a problem
generally, partly because the

00:25:39.723 --> 00:25:42.653
Congress--Continental
Congress--does not have a way of

00:25:42.653 --> 00:25:44.088
insisting on anything.
 

00:25:44.088 --> 00:25:46.259
I mentioned back when we talked
about organizing a war,

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:48.140
the Continental Congress was
not very strong,

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.470
couldn't demand things from the
states,

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.816
could just ask,
so supplies--organizing

00:25:52.816 --> 00:25:54.358
supplies was a problem.
 

00:25:54.358 --> 00:25:57.470
But at Valley Forge they became
a serious problem--

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.690
even just basic supplies like
food--

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.760
partly because of the weakness
of the Continental Congress as

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.859
well as a simple lack of
organization,

00:26:05.859 --> 00:26:08.230
and actually some graft as well.
 

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.930
So men were starving,
some of them half naked;

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.868
some froze to death;
hundreds of horses starved to

00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:16.420
death.
 

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.200
The army didn't dissolve or
mutiny at this point,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.896
which actually says something,
but the experience of Valley

00:26:22.896 --> 00:26:26.848
Forge suggested to some of the
men at Washington's headquarters

00:26:26.848 --> 00:26:30.673
that there were problems with
the weakness of the Continental

00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:31.630
Congress.
 

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:35.124
And I'm going to come back to
this lesson in future lectures

00:26:35.124 --> 00:26:38.678
when we begin to talk about the
Articles of Confederation and

00:26:38.678 --> 00:26:41.640
the lead-up to the
Constitutional Convention,

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.400
because the experience of the
Revolution taught some people,

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.420
or led some people to believe
that they had learned,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.588
some hard lessons about what
wasn't present--

00:26:51.588 --> 00:26:54.029
as what--during the war,
as far as the government was

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:56.335
concerned,
and led them to believe

00:26:56.335 --> 00:26:59.210
something stronger needed to be
there.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.145
So in some ways,
working at Washington's

00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:03.330
headquarters during the war was
like a little

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.358
nationalist-creating machine
where people at the center,

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:09.279
who saw how things were so hard
to organize because of the

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.328
weakness of the Continental
Congress,

00:27:11.328 --> 00:27:14.337
many of those people ended up
believing that there needed to

00:27:14.337 --> 00:27:16.430
be a stronger government after
the war.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.368
That'll come in future lectures.
 

00:27:19.368 --> 00:27:19.746
Okay.
 

00:27:19.746 --> 00:27:23.886
This brings us to the fourth
and final phase of the war,

00:27:23.886 --> 00:27:25.769
the southern campaign.
 

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:32.828
The southern campaign lasted
from 1779 to 1781.

00:27:32.828 --> 00:27:37.039
And this phase is marked by a
decision on the part of the

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:40.950
British to transfer their
attention to the South,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.500
hoping that by possessing ports
of the South closer to the West

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.650
Indies they can maybe maneuver
their fighting better;

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.733
they can keep their eye on
what's ever--whatever's

00:27:49.733 --> 00:27:52.394
happening in the Indies;
they can also fight the

00:27:52.394 --> 00:27:54.558
Americans in the South as well.
 

00:27:54.558 --> 00:27:57.838
Here, the British again made a
faulty assumption,

00:27:57.838 --> 00:28:00.920
because they assumed that the
South would be an easy target,

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.792
because they assumed that there
would be a large reservoir of

00:28:04.792 --> 00:28:06.019
Loyalist support.
 

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:09.200
So they really assumed they
would seize key southern ports,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.450
there'd be all these Loyalists
there to help them,

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.450
and then they would move their
way back north,

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:19.078
taking one region after another
as they worked their way north.

00:28:19.078 --> 00:28:22.170
So the British sailed to the
Carolinas.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.731
They took Charleston,
South Carolina,

00:28:24.731 --> 00:28:28.858
which was the most important
city south of Philadelphia.

00:28:28.858 --> 00:28:33.241
They then left behind British
General Charles Cornwallis with

00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:37.915
kind of a mopping-up crew in the
South while the rest of the army

00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:42.006
began to move north to attack
the rest of the Continental

00:28:42.006 --> 00:28:42.808
Army.
 

00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:46.540
Between 1779 and 1781,
there was a series of battles

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.420
between the Americans and the
British in the South.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.828
Americans suffered defeat after
defeat.

00:28:52.828 --> 00:28:56.123
They persisted,
but they were not winning these

00:28:56.123 --> 00:28:56.838
battles.
 

00:28:56.838 --> 00:28:59.660
The British won Georgia,
they already had Charleston,

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.489
and then the British began to
pursue the Americans into

00:29:03.489 --> 00:29:07.313
Virginia,
and that's where the Americans

00:29:07.313 --> 00:29:08.900
began to rally.
 

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.796
Now in part,
this is due once again to

00:29:11.796 --> 00:29:15.710
supply problems,
this time for the British Army.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.885
For Cornwallis,
the British supply lines were

00:29:18.885 --> 00:29:20.980
stretched to their maximum.
 

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.923
And continued fighting was
beginning to take a real toll on

00:29:24.923 --> 00:29:28.388
Cornwallis' forces,
who suffered worse losses than

00:29:28.388 --> 00:29:31.038
were expected,
particularly considering they

00:29:31.038 --> 00:29:34.180
hadn't really expected much in
the way of losses at all.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:38.271
Also, Loyalists remained
largely silent in the South,

00:29:38.271 --> 00:29:42.601
partly because the British
didn't really treat them very

00:29:42.601 --> 00:29:43.308
well.
 

00:29:43.308 --> 00:29:47.660
The British didn't do anything
to court Loyalists in the South.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.978
The British ruled captured
areas in the South under martial

00:29:51.978 --> 00:29:55.180
law and made no allowances for
Loyalists.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.569
They didn't grant any power to
Loyalists, so basically they did

00:29:59.569 --> 00:30:03.748
nothing to solicit Loyalist
support and thus they didn't get

00:30:03.748 --> 00:30:05.588
much Loyalist support.
 

00:30:05.588 --> 00:30:09.598
So Cornwallis is following the
American army.

00:30:09.598 --> 00:30:13.578
He limps into Virginia with his
supply problem,

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:17.159
and while the British army is
in Virginia they plunder George

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:19.580
Washington's plantation,
Mount Vernon,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.078
just for a little zing.
 

00:30:21.078 --> 00:30:25.609
Well, as long as we're here,
let's attack Mount Vernon.

00:30:25.609 --> 00:30:28.288
They took slaves as they left.
 

00:30:28.288 --> 00:30:31.460
George Washington's plantation
manager,

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.548
Lund Washington,
to protect the plantation,

00:30:34.548 --> 00:30:36.769
to prevent further damage being
done,

00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:40.717
actually went on board a
British vessel in a nearby

00:30:40.717 --> 00:30:44.269
harbor and served the British
refreshments.

00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:45.410
Right?
 

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:49.446
'So, please don't attack Mount
Vernon, and maybe you'll even

00:30:49.446 --> 00:30:52.799
give us back our slaves,
and I'm bringing food.

00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:53.558
Have some cookies.'
 

00:30:53.558 --> 00:30:56.108
I don't know what they brought,
but they brought refreshments.

00:30:56.108 --> 00:31:00.118
This did not please George
Washington at all.

00:31:00.118 --> 00:31:05.019
As he wrote to Lund Washington,
"to go on board their

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:08.450
Vessels;
carry them refreshments;

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:12.077
commune with a parcel of
plundering Scoundrels,

00:31:12.077 --> 00:31:16.653
and request a favour by asking
the surrender of my Negroes,

00:31:16.653 --> 00:31:19.098
was exceedingly ill judged.
 

00:31:19.098 --> 00:31:21.895
It would have been a less
painful circumstance to me to

00:31:21.895 --> 00:31:24.007
have heard that,
in consequence of your

00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:25.798
noncompliance with their
request,

00:31:25.798 --> 00:31:29.440
they had burnt my house and the
plantation in ruins."

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.839
Not really good judgment on the
part of Lund Washington.

00:31:31.839 --> 00:31:32.880
Can you imagine?
 

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.855
He's sort of on there--on the
boat, sort of hanging out with

00:31:36.855 --> 00:31:40.964
the British and he's clearly a
relation of the guy leading the

00:31:40.964 --> 00:31:42.380
Continental Army.
 

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.813
It's not good,
not good thinking on the part

00:31:45.813 --> 00:31:47.490
of Lund Washington.
 

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.868
But, so Cornwallis is in
Virginia.

00:31:49.868 --> 00:31:52.138
He forms a new base of
action--after he's plundered

00:31:52.138 --> 00:31:52.818
Mount Vernon.
 

00:31:52.818 --> 00:31:57.481
He forms a new base of action
at Yorktown, Virginia,

00:31:57.481 --> 00:32:01.047
near the coast,
planning to fan out into

00:32:01.047 --> 00:32:03.788
Pennsylvania and Virginia.
 

00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:06.776
But just then,
August 30,1781,

00:32:06.776 --> 00:32:12.852
a French fleet under French
Admiral de Grasse arrived at the

00:32:12.852 --> 00:32:17.781
Virginia coast with troops and,
as we're about to see,

00:32:17.781 --> 00:32:21.060
this ends up being a really
crucial turning point for what's

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.228
happening in Virginia and then
ultimately for the war as a

00:32:24.228 --> 00:32:24.838
whole.
 

00:32:24.838 --> 00:32:29.200
Washington had troops on land
in Virginia,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.950
but in the end it was the
arrival of the French fleet in

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.200
the harbor that really decided
the battle,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.164
because basically it surrounded
the British and they had no way

00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:37.740
to escape.
 

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.078
The troops surrounded them on
land.

00:32:40.078 --> 00:32:43.532
They probably would have tried
to escape to their ships in the

00:32:43.532 --> 00:32:46.589
harbor, but now the French fleet
was there, making that

00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:47.440
impossible.
 

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.702
If the French fleet had arrived
at the wrong time or in the

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:53.288
wrong place, this plan would
have collapsed.

00:32:53.288 --> 00:32:56.391
And sort of miraculously,
they actually get to the right

00:32:56.391 --> 00:33:00.000
place at the right time for the
plan to really go into effect.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.074
So the arrival of the French
really looks bad for the

00:33:04.074 --> 00:33:07.598
British, and Cornwallis is low
on supplies.

00:33:07.598 --> 00:33:09.578
He's also low on men at this
point,

00:33:09.578 --> 00:33:12.628
and now he's trapped at
Yorktown, trapped between

00:33:12.628 --> 00:33:15.170
American forces and the French
fleet,

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:19.318
which now put the British under
siege.

00:33:19.318 --> 00:33:22.597
So Cornwallis has roughly 7,000
men, and there actually were

00:33:22.597 --> 00:33:25.876
some Loyalists fighting there,
so they didn't antagonize all

00:33:25.876 --> 00:33:27.598
the Loyalists in the South.
 

00:33:27.598 --> 00:33:29.951
There were some fighting
alongside the British at

00:33:29.951 --> 00:33:30.490
Yorktown.
 

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:34.953
Cornwallis's roughly 7,000 men
held off a siege of roughly

00:33:34.953 --> 00:33:39.808
15,000 combined American and
French troops for three weeks,

00:33:39.808 --> 00:33:42.368
which is actually a pretty
amazing accomplishment,

00:33:42.368 --> 00:33:50.211
but ultimately Cornwallis was
forced to surrender on October

00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:51.538
17,1781.
 

00:33:51.538 --> 00:33:54.920
Cornwallis wrote a terse note
to Sir Henry Clinton,

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.910
who was then in command of the
British forces in America.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.309
He wrote, quote:
"I have the mortification

00:34:01.309 --> 00:34:04.180
to inform Your Excellency that I
have been forced ...

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.960
to surrender the troops under
my command,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.639
by capitulation,
on the 19^(th) instant,

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:11.396
as prisoners of war to the
combined forces of America and

00:34:11.396 --> 00:34:12.530
France,"
period.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.239
"Mortified"
is a good word.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:18.820
He could not believe what had
happened.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.927
Stunned by what happened in
this battle and just the

00:34:21.927 --> 00:34:25.262
incredible drama of the moment,
there are actually many,

00:34:25.262 --> 00:34:28.105
many, many eyewitness accounts
of what was unfolding at

00:34:28.105 --> 00:34:30.833
Yorktown,
because people understood on

00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:34.190
all sides that something major
was happening.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:37.279
People described,
during the formal surrender on

00:34:37.279 --> 00:34:40.215
October 19,
the slow passage of the British

00:34:40.215 --> 00:34:43.920
troops past the eyes of the
American troops who were lined

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.300
up in two columns that stretched
for half a mile.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.085
The British band played a tune
titled "The World Turned

00:34:51.085 --> 00:34:54.360
Upside Down,"
which they surely felt it was.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.940
Witnesses said that the British
looked,

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.349
quote, "unsoldierly,"
and I think what that means is,

00:34:59.349 --> 00:35:01.731
according to another witness,
"they were very much in

00:35:01.731 --> 00:35:02.360
liquor."
 

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.144
[laughs]
So the British are

00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:07.030
mortified--not just
Cornwallis--but they're

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.190
mortified, and basically,
they were drunk.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.090
They couldn't quite believe
that this was happening.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:15.603
Someone said that their ranks
were broken and "their step

00:35:15.603 --> 00:35:16.869
was irregular."
 

00:35:16.869 --> 00:35:20.382
Cornwallis was so mortified
that he claimed to be sick and

00:35:20.382 --> 00:35:22.480
refused to attend the surrender.
 

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.347
And he sent a deputy to
surrender his sword to

00:35:25.347 --> 00:35:27.130
Washington--
and Washington,

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:30.275
who is so good at sort of
upholding the dignity of the

00:35:30.275 --> 00:35:32.538
cause,
refused to accept the sword

00:35:32.538 --> 00:35:35.690
from a deputy and had it
delivered to his deputy,

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.139
so that terms were equal.
 

00:35:37.139 --> 00:35:40.730
Washington's always good at the
sort of symbolic gesture.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.349
And then, the British as they
were marching by the American

00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:45.925
troops, they had to lay down
their arms under the terms of

00:35:45.925 --> 00:35:46.739
the surrender.
 

00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:49.670
And when the British were told
to lay down their arms one

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.190
witness noted that,
quote,

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:54.539
"their mortification could
not be concealed.

00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:57.795
I am a witness that they
performed this duty in a very

00:35:57.795 --> 00:36:01.152
unofficer-like manner;
and that many of the soldiers

00:36:01.152 --> 00:36:04.922
manifested a sullen temper,
throwing their arms on the pile

00:36:04.922 --> 00:36:07.844
with violence,
as if determined to render them

00:36:07.844 --> 00:36:08.690
useless.
 

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.289
We are not to be surprised that
the pride of the British

00:36:11.289 --> 00:36:13.179
officers is humbled on this
occasion,

00:36:13.179 --> 00:36:16.445
as they have always entertained
an exalted opinion of their own

00:36:16.445 --> 00:36:18.686
military prowess,
and affected to view the

00:36:18.686 --> 00:36:22.989
Americans as a contemptible,
undisciplined rabble."

00:36:22.989 --> 00:36:25.590
Now here we come to some
documents I want to mention,

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.523
just because I discovered them
years ago at the Library of

00:36:27.523 --> 00:36:29.536
Congress,
and I found them so interesting

00:36:29.536 --> 00:36:30.210
at the time.
 

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.190
It's just something I would
never have thought of before--

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.521
which is the glory of doing
research when you're a

00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:36.940
historian--
is, you just never know what

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.570
you're going to find.
 

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.849
And I was actually--I was at
the Library of Congress.

00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:45.210
I was actually researching
dueling, right?

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:46.780
So what I really wanted to know
was--

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.532
supposedly, Americans learned
to duel by watching the French

00:36:49.532 --> 00:36:51.894
during the Revolution,
and they think this is such a

00:36:51.894 --> 00:36:53.380
great idea they take it
themselves.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.985
It sounds dubious to me,
but I was researching this to

00:36:55.985 --> 00:36:58.050
see if I could find any record
of this,

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.992
and I found these letters
from--between actually British

00:37:01.992 --> 00:37:05.936
commanders and French commanders
during the surrender at

00:37:05.936 --> 00:37:06.869
Yorktown.
 

00:37:06.869 --> 00:37:09.070
And what was fascinating about
them is,

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:12.099
the British and the French are
writing to each other and what

00:37:12.099 --> 00:37:14.574
they're both basically saying in
their letters is:

00:37:14.574 --> 00:37:16.306
the British are saying,
'Okay.

00:37:16.306 --> 00:37:19.313
Would you please tell the
Americans to step out of the way

00:37:19.313 --> 00:37:21.900
because they don't know how to
do a surrender;

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.750
they don't know what they're
doing, and they're in the way.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.483
Just please,
French commander,

00:37:26.483 --> 00:37:29.893
tell the Americans to step
aside because they're pesky and

00:37:29.893 --> 00:37:31.210
they're amateurs.'
 

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.318
And the French are basically
writing back to the British and

00:37:33.318 --> 00:37:33.889
saying, 'Yeah.
 

00:37:33.889 --> 00:37:36.518
We understand the Americans are
in the way.

00:37:36.518 --> 00:37:38.679
Aren't they cute,
those little Americans?

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:40.860
We'll have them step off to the
side.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.760
You and I, we know how to
really have a real surrender.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.610
Don't worry.
 

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.409
Your needs will be tended to.'
 

00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:48.641
So basically,
I found these letters in which

00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:51.862
the French and the English were
treating each other as absolute

00:37:51.862 --> 00:37:54.873
equals and neither one was
treating the Americans as equals

00:37:54.873 --> 00:37:56.119
on the same plane.
 

00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:59.525
And it really gives you a sense
of how the French and the

00:37:59.525 --> 00:38:03.052
English were these sort of
long-time Old World war veterans

00:38:03.052 --> 00:38:04.664
who--
even though they were

00:38:04.664 --> 00:38:07.402
enemies--really sort of
understood and appreciated each

00:38:07.402 --> 00:38:09.239
other,
and the Americans are such

00:38:09.239 --> 00:38:11.079
little sort of pipsqueak
newcomers;

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:13.139
they're not even on the radar
screen.

00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:14.981
So I thought that was
fascinating, to find the French

00:38:14.981 --> 00:38:15.619
and the English.
 

00:38:15.619 --> 00:38:16.809
It's not what I thought I would
find.

00:38:16.809 --> 00:38:18.563
I was like: oh,
cool, letters between the

00:38:18.563 --> 00:38:20.360
French and the British during
Yorktown.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.949
Hey, wait a minute.
 

00:38:21.949 --> 00:38:23.641
[laughs]
The French are telling us to

00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:24.630
get out of the way.
 

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.400
So it was interesting.
 

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.157
It really gives you a sense of
sort of American status,

00:38:30.157 --> 00:38:31.690
relatively speaking.
 

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.668
Back in England,
one witness was with Lord North

00:38:34.668 --> 00:38:38.030
when he received word of the
loss at Yorktown and,

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.543
as this witness wrote,
North took the news "as he

00:38:40.543 --> 00:38:42.440
would have taken a shot in the
breast.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.021
For he opened his arms,
exclaiming wildly,

00:38:45.021 --> 00:38:46.659
as he paced up and down.
 

00:38:46.659 --> 00:38:47.539
"Oh, God!
 

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:50.922
it is all over!"--words
which he repeated many times

00:38:50.922 --> 00:38:53.702
under emotions of the deepest
consternation and

00:38:53.702 --> 00:38:54.849
distress."
 

00:38:54.849 --> 00:38:58.623
So at this point England,
which is already overtaxed,

00:38:58.623 --> 00:39:02.179
definitely sees no sign of
victory on the horizon,

00:39:02.179 --> 00:39:05.300
decides to commence peace
negotiations.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.373
Now clearly,
you can see how French aid had

00:39:08.373 --> 00:39:12.835
a major, major impact on what
happened at Yorktown and thus on

00:39:12.835 --> 00:39:14.519
the war in general.
 

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:15.969
The French gave supplies.
 

00:39:15.969 --> 00:39:16.840
They gave men.
 

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.340
They gave naval support.
 

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.840
They gave moral support.
 

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.250
They distracted the British.
 

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.570
In lots of ways,
the French had a huge influence

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.550
on the outcome of the war.
 

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:29.304
Now I noted earlier,
that French self-interest

00:39:29.304 --> 00:39:32.976
played some role in the decision
of the French to join on the

00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:36.112
side of the Americans,
but it is also worth noting

00:39:36.112 --> 00:39:39.409
that there were some Frenchmen
who came to the aid of America

00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:42.813
because they actually really did
get swept up into the American

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:46.056
revolutionary cause and they saw
it as a justified fight for

00:39:46.056 --> 00:39:46.880
freedom.
 

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.307
And the Marquis de Lafayette is
maybe the most notable example

00:39:50.307 --> 00:39:50.869
of this.
 

00:39:50.869 --> 00:39:52.030
He was really young at the time.
 

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.880
He was about nineteen years old.
 

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.657
He's a marquis,
so he's clearly very wealthy

00:39:56.657 --> 00:40:00.277
and obviously he was really
moved by what was going on in

00:40:00.277 --> 00:40:03.250
America so he actually took a
large ship,

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.601
loaded it with men and
supplies, and sailed to America

00:40:06.601 --> 00:40:09.882
just to volunteer his ship,
his men, his supplies and

00:40:09.882 --> 00:40:10.380
himself.
 

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.869
'Here I am joining the American
cause.'

00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:17.110
And he ended up being this
really beloved figure in

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:17.960
America.
 

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.018
Washington really almost
treated him like a son,

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:23.239
when you read letters that
Washington writes,

00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:25.849
and Washington's not exactly a
cozy kind of individual,

00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:29.440
but clearly he had a lot of
affection for Lafayette.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.949
But Americans in general really
admired and appreciated

00:40:32.949 --> 00:40:36.719
Lafayette because he was sort of
this starry-eyed youth who

00:40:36.719 --> 00:40:40.099
sacrificed for the American
cause for no reason.

00:40:40.099 --> 00:40:43.440
He just appeared because he was
swept into the cause.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.224
And between 1824 and 1825,
right on the cusp of the

00:40:46.224 --> 00:40:49.510
fiftieth anniversary of the
Declaration of Independence,

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.824
Lafayette actually came back to
America for the sort of

00:40:52.824 --> 00:40:55.699
triumphal tour,
to sort of visit old friends.

00:40:55.699 --> 00:40:59.996
I think he met with Jefferson
and Adams and I think Andrew

00:40:59.996 --> 00:41:00.750
Jackson.
 

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:04.371
By 1824, there's a weird
conglomeration of people that

00:41:04.371 --> 00:41:05.739
he's meeting with.
 

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:08.940
But he went on a grand tour of
all of America.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.733
He went to all of the
twenty-four states--and I think

00:41:11.733 --> 00:41:15.119
he was in his seventies at the
time, so he's pretty vigorous.

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:17.030
And he was celebrated.
 

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:18.900
He was paraded all over the
place;

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.599
he had receptions where he sort
of hung out, ready to talk to

00:41:22.599 --> 00:41:23.340
Americans.
 

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.215
Americans of all kinds would
line up on the street just to

00:41:27.215 --> 00:41:31.157
see him, to watch parades go by,
to look at him enter their

00:41:31.157 --> 00:41:31.768
city.
 

00:41:31.768 --> 00:41:33.780
So he was beloved at the time
and then he was sort of--

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.780
in a way maybe he sort of
symbolized French assistance,

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.869
the French alliance,
afterwards, because Americans

00:41:40.869 --> 00:41:43.960
gave a lot of love to the
Marquis de Lafayette.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.269
And it's important to note--I'm
mentioning Lafayette because

00:41:46.269 --> 00:41:47.679
he's maybe the best known
figure,

00:41:47.679 --> 00:41:50.367
but he's not the only Frenchman
who volunteered to come and

00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:54.208
fight for the American cause,
and actually France is not the

00:41:54.208 --> 00:41:59.081
only country where people came
voluntarily to join the American

00:41:59.081 --> 00:41:59.789
cause.
 

00:41:59.789 --> 00:42:02.856
So back to the French:
The aid of the French:

00:42:02.856 --> 00:42:05.782
clearly major,
major factor in the American

00:42:05.782 --> 00:42:06.619
victory.
 

00:42:06.619 --> 00:42:09.545
And with the American victory
at Yorktown in 1781,

00:42:09.545 --> 00:42:12.650
the British decide to commence
peace negotiations.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:15.922
It is important to note that
even though the British have now

00:42:15.922 --> 00:42:19.250
informally decided that they're
going to start negotiating for

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.250
peace,
it doesn't mean that there was

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.889
an instant ceasefire in the war.
 

00:42:24.889 --> 00:42:28.755
There was kind of a fuzzy
period here in which there was

00:42:28.755 --> 00:42:32.199
still a sizable British armed
force in America.

00:42:32.199 --> 00:42:35.800
The British hadn't officially
declared surrender.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.460
Authorities in London told
British forces that they should

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.378
avoid battle unless attacked and
they should begin to evacuate

00:42:43.378 --> 00:42:46.329
troops,
but Yorktown was not really the

00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:50.215
instant end of the Revolution,
and there are still skirmishes

00:42:50.215 --> 00:42:52.289
and battles afterwards for some
time.

00:42:52.289 --> 00:42:54.750
People don't have any way of
really knowing the war is over.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:58.469
There's still a British army
there.

00:42:58.469 --> 00:43:04.081
It's not until June of 1782
that negotiations began in

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:04.929
Paris.
 

00:43:04.929 --> 00:43:08.117
Americans sent a commission of
four men: John Adams,

00:43:08.117 --> 00:43:11.179
Benjamin Franklin,
John Jay, and Henry Laurens.

00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:14.840
It's interesting to note that
even now--

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.500
okay, Yorktown,
surrender, war over,

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.590
we're going to have a peace
negotiation--

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.626
even now, the British still
hope that maybe there'd be some

00:43:22.626 --> 00:43:25.507
way to come to terms with the
Americans that would still

00:43:25.507 --> 00:43:28.230
somehow leave America within the
British empire.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.039
They're really persistent.
 

00:43:30.039 --> 00:43:34.349
And it wasn't until John Jay
arrived in Paris--and he is a

00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:37.829
no-nonsense, sort of
straightforward person.

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:39.449
Jay actually said, 'Look.
 

00:43:39.449 --> 00:43:43.121
We're not going to proceed with
peace negotiations unless

00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.481
independence is assumed,
guys'--like:

00:43:45.481 --> 00:43:46.400
okay, end.
 

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.309
[laughs] This is not negotiable.
 

00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:49.349
We're independent.
 

00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:50.429
War over.
 

00:43:50.429 --> 00:43:54.072
It wasn't until he really
insisted, that negotiations

00:43:54.072 --> 00:43:57.717
began and independence was
really finally accepted as

00:43:57.717 --> 00:43:59.820
inevitable by the British.
 

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.570
So Britain recognized American
independence.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:07.969
They agreed to evacuate all
royal troops from American soil.

00:44:07.969 --> 00:44:10.746
John Adams, thinking of New
England, got American fishing

00:44:10.746 --> 00:44:12.829
rights off of the Grand Banks of
Canada;

00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:14.510
Canada appears again.
 

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.065
I like the fact that John Adams
is there, working for fishing

00:44:17.065 --> 00:44:17.449
rights.
 

00:44:17.449 --> 00:44:18.599
Okay. Yeah, independence.
 

00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:19.659
Fishing rights!
 

00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:21.510
[laughter]
Thank you, John Adams.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.539
The Americans promised that
they would urge state

00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:27.887
legislatures to compensate
Loyalists for property loss

00:44:27.887 --> 00:44:30.420
during the war,
and agreed that British

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.130
creditors would be able to
collect prewar debts.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.621
Even though those two very nice
things were agreed to by the

00:44:35.621 --> 00:44:37.923
Americans,
in fact neither one happened in

00:44:37.923 --> 00:44:41.036
a very reliable manner and
created all sorts of problems

00:44:41.036 --> 00:44:44.375
because there were a lot of
states that were just not really

00:44:44.375 --> 00:44:47.601
excited about compensating
Loyalists or about repaying the

00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:48.449
British.
 

00:44:48.449 --> 00:44:50.739
No mention was made of Native
Americans,

00:44:50.739 --> 00:44:54.349
many of whom had supported the
British for really logical

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:56.657
reasons,
given their fears about the

00:44:56.657 --> 00:44:59.911
spreading domination of an
independent American republic

00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:02.099
with settlers swallowing up
land,

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:05.648
and ultimately many Indian
nations simply didn't recognize

00:45:05.648 --> 00:45:09.010
American claims of sovereignty
over their territory.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:13.177
For the Americans overall,
independence had been won,

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:14.940
but at a high price.
 

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.969
And actually,
only the Civil War produced a

00:45:17.969 --> 00:45:22.010
higher ratio of casualties to
the nation's population.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:27.463
And still undecided at the
close of the war were two

00:45:27.463 --> 00:45:30.780
obvious big, major questions.
 

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.768
What kind of society was
America going to become,

00:45:34.768 --> 00:45:39.340
and what kind of government
would the new nation and its

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.920
states possess?
 

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.655
These are two questions which
we're going to be talking about

00:45:43.655 --> 00:45:44.659
in lectures to come.
 

00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:47.637
On Thursday I'm going to talk
about American society and then

00:45:47.637 --> 00:45:50.266
we sort of segue into a
discussion of people wondering

00:45:50.266 --> 00:45:52.500
exactly what's supposed to be
happening,

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.239
what kind of a national
something is supposed to be

00:45:55.239 --> 00:45:58.922
governing over these states,
and that's going to lead us up

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:02.690
to why a constitutional
convention actually made sense,

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.130
because it didn't make sense to
everybody and it took a while

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.079
for it to make sense to anybody.
 

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:09.900
So that's to come.
 

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.559
I will conclude there and I
will see you on Thursday.

00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:19.000

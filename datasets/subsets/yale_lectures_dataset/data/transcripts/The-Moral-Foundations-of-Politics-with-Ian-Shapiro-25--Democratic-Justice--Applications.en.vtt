00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.856
Prof: But what I wanted
to do today was pursue the

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:08.330
discussion of democratic
justice.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.022
I talked about it as a
semi-contextual idea that

00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:16.969
there's a general argument,
which we discussed on Monday,

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:21.791
that recognizes the subordinate
character of democratic

00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:27.060
constraints on the superordinate
goods that people pursue in

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.650
different walks of life.
 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.149
And I said it was a
semi-contextual argument with

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.669
the implication that the way you
work that out varies with time

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:39.200
and circumstance.
 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.578
It varies at different times in
the same setting,

00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:47.410
but then also it varies across
settings.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.003
So if we think about the
traditional family in America in

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.663
the 1950s,
which is more or less captured,

00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:58.136
I think,
at least with respect to

00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:00.658
governing children in this
picture,

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:03.962
that's, of course,
very different than the

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:08.713
traditional family life we might
find in South Africa in the

00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:09.519
1980s.
 

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.834
And where you go depends upon
where you start,

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:19.494
and the basic impulse behind
democratic justice is a kind of

00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:22.180
democratized Burkeanism.
 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.448
That is to say it recognizes
that along with the

00:01:26.448 --> 00:01:30.808
anti-Enlightenment theorists
that we never design

00:01:30.808 --> 00:01:35.440
institutions afresh,
rather we redesign institutions

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.019
that we inherit and reproduce
into the future.

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:43.453
But rather than just reproduce
them into the future in a

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:47.408
conservative fashion,
the impulse of democratic

00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:52.172
justice is to democratize them
as we reproduce them into the

00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:52.980
future.
 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.040
And so when we think about
restructuring the family,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.608
or restructuring the system of
education,

00:02:02.608 --> 00:02:05.828
or restructuring any realm of
collective activity,

00:02:05.828 --> 00:02:10.229
the idea is to take the
inherited systems of norms and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.008
practices,
imbue the values that are

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:17.574
embedded in them,
learn about them,

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.068
but then not be uncritical.
 

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:23.556
Think, rather,
as we reproduce them into the

00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:28.018
future how they could be
restructured in accordance with

00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:33.047
the basic impulse of democratic
justice which is to democratize

00:02:33.047 --> 00:02:37.913
the power dimensions of those
relationships while leaving the

00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:41.970
other dimensions as unsullied as
possible.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.840
We want to democratize.
 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.319
Democracy is a subordinate
good, but we do not want to

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.729
interfere with the superordinate
good any more than necessary.

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:59.008
So that is a summary statement
of what we did on Monday,

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:03.609
but to put some flesh on it I
thought I would walk you through

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.604
a couple of examples of what
this means when you start

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.490
actually to apply it.
 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.830
And I'm going to talk today
about two such examples.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.741
One concerns governing children
and another concerns governing

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:24.038
the workplace,
and I'm going to walk you

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:30.502
through the kind of reasoning
that gets generated if we try to

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:36.542
think about the exercise of
democratizing these spheres of

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:42.370
life within the constraints of
democratic justice.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.018
Now I thought it would be good
to start with governing children

00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:53.016
because on the face of it,
it presents the most difficult

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:57.258
challenge for the argument that
I sketched on Monday.

00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:01.052
Namely, if you want to have
some notion of collective

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:04.526
self-governance,
that is that people have a

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:08.699
presumptive say when power is
exercised over them,

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.960
how is that going to work with
children?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.760
And if you want to have some
notion of opposition,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.019
how is that going to work with
children?

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.519
Because after all we don't want
simply mindless opposition.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:26.230
We want loyal opposition.
 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.172
We want informed opposition,
but young children are

00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:31.750
incapable of that.
 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.942
They're certainly capable of
opposition, but not exactly the

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.500
opposition that we're looking
for.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.827
So if you want to say that
democratic justice should apply

00:04:42.827 --> 00:04:47.079
in all domains where power is
exercised this looks like a

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:52.077
pretty hard case,
and I think it presents unique

00:04:52.077 --> 00:04:53.410
challenges.
 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.634
For one thing,
the hierarchies that exist over

00:04:57.634 --> 00:05:02.442
children are inevitable,
and so we have to think about

00:05:02.442 --> 00:05:06.673
the opposition side of
democratic justice in a way that

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:08.790
takes that into account.
 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.800
On the governance side,
too, we're dealing with a

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.170
situation where it's impossible
for children to make decisions

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.100
about their own lives,
certainly at the very beginning.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.670
Others are going to have to
make those decisions for them.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.851
So on the governance side of
the equation John Locke had

00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:37.988
this,
I think, exactly right when he

00:05:37.988 --> 00:05:44.339
said that the only basis for
disenfranchising people is

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:45.870
necessity.
 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.791
So if somebody is unable to
participate, then they should be

00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:57.110
deprived of the franchise,
but only to the extent that

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.420
necessity requires.
 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.548
So for Locke he said children
should be disenfranchised for

00:06:03.548 --> 00:06:05.896
their "ignorant
non-age"

00:06:05.896 --> 00:06:09.740
and once that expires they
should be enfranchised.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.653
And he also thought that with
respect adults we shouldn't

00:06:15.653 --> 00:06:21.040
disenfranchise people until
absolutely necessary.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.023
Perhaps we find it necessary to
take away people's driving

00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:33.529
licenses once they turn 85 or at
least start subjecting them to

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:38.666
annual driving tests,
but that doesn't necessarily

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:42.449
mean we would take away the vote
from them.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:49.230
So the basic Lockean impulse is
only to disenfranchise when

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:56.009
necessary and no more than is
required by circumstances.

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.245
Now that too presents something
of a challenge when you start to

00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:04.077
think about children because if
you read some books on the

00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:08.314
history of childhood one of the
things you will quickly discover

00:07:08.314 --> 00:07:11.610
is that over the past hundred
years or so,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.399
there's been a huge lengthening
of childhood.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.019
We have invented adolescence.
 

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:22.678
Adolescence is not a category
that existed a hundred years

00:07:22.678 --> 00:07:23.170
ago.
 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.608
Children were thought to be
miniature adults at a much

00:07:27.608 --> 00:07:28.949
earlier stage.
 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.860
So if we have lengthened
childhood,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.230
lengthened the time at which
people are disenfranchised,

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.331
after all the incidence of
adulthood begin to accrue around

00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:44.291
sixteen and seventeen when
people get driving license and

00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:45.000
so on.
 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.610
They can vote now at eighteen,
but we still prohibit the

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.300
imbibing of alcohol until
twenty-one.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.004
So it's a gradual exodus to
adulthood and it's an elongated

00:08:02.004 --> 00:08:02.889
status.
 

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:06.019
Now there might be
justifications for that.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:10.906
When you move from an economy
that's based on physical brawn

00:08:10.906 --> 00:08:15.959
to an information-based economy
that's based on education,

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:20.062
it may be necessary to lengthen
childhood because it may be

00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:24.375
necessary for people to acquire
different kinds of skills that

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:27.629
were not needed in the
eighteenth or nineteenth

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:28.620
century.
 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.772
So there may be a justification
for lengthening childhood and

00:08:32.772 --> 00:08:36.509
I'll come back to that,
but it needs to be supplied.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:41.327
The presumption is that you
only disenfranchise out of

00:08:41.327 --> 00:08:42.418
necessity.
 

00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:47.769
Now there have been movements
from time to time to treat

00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:53.798
children as miniature adults
from the earliest possible age.

00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:58.057
There's a famous British school
called Summerhill founded by a

00:08:58.057 --> 00:09:01.129
man called A.S. Neill who died
recently.

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:05.759
And Summerhill was famous for
not having any rules.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:08.259
And the kids could do whatever
they wanted.

00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:10.460
They could go to class or not
go to class.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.159
They could go to bed whenever
they wanted.

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:15.340
They could come and go.
 

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.788
There simply were no rules.
 

00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:23.350
And Neill used this as an
example.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.630
It was always held up as a
banner by the Children's Rights

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:33.080
Movement as an example of what
could be done,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.062
and the implicit argument
against authority who structures

00:09:37.062 --> 00:09:39.720
over children from a very young
age.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.346
But I think it was rather
artificial, because after all

00:09:43.346 --> 00:09:47.513
Summerhill was a private school
where the well-to-do could send

00:09:47.513 --> 00:09:48.788
their children.
 

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:51.918
In England it's euphemistically
called a public school,

00:09:51.918 --> 00:09:56.025
which means a private school,
and it was a cocooned

00:09:56.025 --> 00:10:01.201
environment where children could
make mistakes without suffering

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:04.980
horrendous consequences of those
mistakes.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.501
Whereas if you go down to the
Hill district of New Haven and

00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:13.639
you imagine eleven- and
twelve-year-old children making

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:18.316
the sorts of mistakes that you
could make in Summerhill School

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:22.990
without consequence for those
kids in the Hill district of New

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.437
Haven the results would be
life-changingly catastrophic and

00:10:27.437 --> 00:10:28.970
often are.
 

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:34.413
So the Summerhill story is,
I think, in that sense na�ve

00:10:34.413 --> 00:10:39.666
about the larger context of
power relations within which

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:42.149
education takes place.
 

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:45.936
And as we'll see even more
explicitly when I come to talk

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:50.196
about democracy in the workplace
you always have to look both at

00:10:50.196 --> 00:10:54.048
the system of power relations
within an institution,

00:10:54.048 --> 00:10:58.029
but then also the larger power
context,

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:00.658
the power externalities as I
call them,

00:11:00.658 --> 00:11:04.960
within which the institution
operates.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.605
And so I think the Lockean
impulse to have a gradual

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:19.293
transition to adulthood makes
sense and it should be bounded

00:11:19.293 --> 00:11:23.562
by necessity,
which creates the presumption

00:11:23.562 --> 00:11:27.538
that if we're going to lengthen
this period of dependency,

00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:33.788
the justification has to be
supplied.

00:11:33.788 --> 00:11:37.769
So that's on the governance
side of the equation.

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:40.440
What about on the opposition
side of the equation?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.154
Because children don't have the
capacity to engage in what we're

00:11:44.154 --> 00:11:45.629
thinking of opposition.
 

00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:49.648
That is opposition where you've
internalized and understood the

00:11:49.648 --> 00:11:53.407
values of the system into which
you're born and now you are

00:11:53.407 --> 00:11:57.490
questioning whether they should
be applied into the future.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.207
There's not going to be much
opposition either,

00:12:02.207 --> 00:12:06.105
of that sort,
until children are fairly

00:12:06.105 --> 00:12:07.440
advanced.
 

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.076
So there's going to be a very
long period in which neither

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:17.038
collective self-governance nor
loyal opposition is going to be

00:12:17.038 --> 00:12:20.048
in any meaningful sense
feasible.

00:12:20.048 --> 00:12:23.613
Children are going to be stuck
in hierarchical situations and

00:12:23.613 --> 00:12:26.940
that is the basic material with
which we have to work.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.778
How can we think about that?
 

00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:36.503
Well, one argument that comes
to mind once we're considering

00:12:36.503 --> 00:12:41.352
inevitably hierarchical
situations, is that perhaps

00:12:41.352 --> 00:12:45.038
hierarchies can check one
another.

00:12:45.038 --> 00:12:50.322
If you have an inevitably
hierarchical relationship and

00:12:50.322 --> 00:12:54.529
you think about more than one
hierarchy--

00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:58.625
this is, if you like,
another version of ambition

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.759
counteracting ambition.
 

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:04.986
You create more than one
authority structure over

00:13:04.986 --> 00:13:09.831
children with the expectation
that they can then to some

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:14.500
degree have competing and to
some degree complementary

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.639
competencies and will check one
another,

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:23.544
and that's the basic approach
that I take in thinking about

00:13:23.544 --> 00:13:27.519
democratic justice as it applies
to children.

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:30.883
We can think of children,
first of all,

00:13:30.883 --> 00:13:35.398
as having two kinds of
interests, which I call basic

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.320
interests and best interests.
 

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.399
So basic interests are rather
like Rawls's resources.

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:48.663
In that sense my argument is a
resourcist argument comparable

00:13:48.663 --> 00:13:52.664
to Rawls's and Amartya Sen's,
which we didn't have time to

00:13:52.664 --> 00:13:54.543
talk about,
and Ronald Dworkin's,

00:13:54.543 --> 00:13:56.690
which I mentioned to you
briefly.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.950
And if you go back to your
notes from our lecture on Rawls,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:05.726
you'll see that I said one of
his most important innovations

00:14:05.726 --> 00:14:09.350
was to take the focus off
welfare,

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.538
therefore different measures of
utility,

00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:15.080
and start, instead,
talking about resources.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.759
In his case they were primary
goods.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:23.784
So I talk about basic resources
or basic interests as those

00:14:23.784 --> 00:14:28.638
things which it's necessary to
vindicate in order for the

00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:33.836
person to survive and thrive in
the economy as it's likely to

00:14:33.836 --> 00:14:39.296
exist for their lifetime and in
the political system governed as

00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:41.029
a democracy.
 

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:45.595
Children have an interest in
their basic interests being met

00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:50.316
and others have an interest in
the basic interests of children

00:14:50.316 --> 00:14:51.399
being met.
 

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:56.525
We all have an interest in the
raising of literate competent

00:14:56.525 --> 00:15:01.043
people so that they can
participate in the democratic

00:15:01.043 --> 00:15:05.908
political order in which we're
all going to operate.

00:15:05.908 --> 00:15:10.278
And then best interests are
something quite different.

00:15:10.278 --> 00:15:14.436
The best interests of children
are to thrive as well as

00:15:14.436 --> 00:15:16.875
possible,
to be all they can be,

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.955
to be happy,
fulfilled, successful human

00:15:19.955 --> 00:15:22.812
beings,
loved and capable of love,

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:27.203
and all of the other things
that we think of that it's

00:15:27.203 --> 00:15:30.269
important for children to
develop.

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:35.876
And the argument is that we
should think of the state as the

00:15:35.876 --> 00:15:40.820
ultimate fiduciary of children's
basic interests,

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:45.096
and parents as the ultimate
fiduciary of children's best

00:15:45.096 --> 00:15:46.029
interests.
 

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:50.889
This raises the question,
what is a fiduciary?

00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:55.129
Again, this comes from Locke
when thinking about children,

00:15:55.129 --> 00:16:00.808
that Locke makes the argument
when he's discussing children,

00:16:00.808 --> 00:16:04.179
he says--well,
I'll put it into twentieth

00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:08.139
century words or twenty-first
century words,

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:13.716
but the basic idea is,
what do you do if you raise

00:16:13.716 --> 00:16:17.986
your child,
you do your best for them,

00:16:17.986 --> 00:16:23.399
you pour resources into them,
you pour energy and affection

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.481
into them,
you do everything right and

00:16:25.481 --> 00:16:27.850
they turn around at the age of
eighteen and they say,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.595
your kid says to you,
"Dad I think you're a

00:16:30.595 --> 00:16:31.179
schmuck.
 

00:16:31.179 --> 00:16:32.379
I'm out of here.
 

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:34.529
I don't owe you anything."
 

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:38.827
And you start slamming your
fist on the table and you say,

00:16:38.827 --> 00:16:42.220
"After all I've done for
you...."

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.700
Locke wants to say this
argument doesn't fly.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.169
Why doesn't it fly?
 

00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:52.149
Why doesn't it fly?
 

00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:57.533
"After all I've done for
you," what's wrong with

00:16:57.533 --> 00:17:03.200
that argument as a basis for
thinking about what children owe

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.900
their parents?
 

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.351
You could take this from a
Lockean point of view or a

00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:08.528
Rawlsian point of view.
 

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:09.240
Think.
 

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.910
Why is it a terrible argument?
 

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.974
I've done these things for you
now you owe it to me to go to

00:17:17.974 --> 00:17:22.869
law school or whatever it is,
support me in my old age.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.549
Any guesses?
 

00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:28.079
Yeah?
 

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:35.180
 
 

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.586
Student: Well,
the child has no choice to

00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:40.894
participate in the power
structure that it's been in for

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.940
the past eighteen or so years.
 

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.887
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Exactly, so and for Locke

00:17:45.887 --> 00:17:49.277
obligation is based on consent,
social contract theory,

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:50.029
consent.
 

00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:52.038
Yeah, so you've got it right.
 

00:17:52.038 --> 00:17:57.602
That's Locke's reason and so he
says, "If your child at the

00:17:57.602 --> 00:18:01.309
age of eighteen says,
'You're a schmuck.

00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:02.358
I'm out of here.
 

00:18:02.358 --> 00:18:05.707
I don't owe you anything,' all
you can really do is conclude

00:18:05.707 --> 00:18:07.750
that you failed as a
parent."

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.740
The child doesn't owe you
anything because--

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.759
and as I said,
in Rawlsian terms the fact that

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:17.352
this child is your child is,
from the child's point of view,

00:18:17.352 --> 00:18:18.278
morally arbitrary.
 

00:18:18.278 --> 00:18:21.880
They didn't do anything to
become your child.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.663
So your power and authority
over the child is the power or

00:18:26.663 --> 00:18:31.109
authority over the fiduciary,
but it's in the nature of a

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:35.086
fiduciary arrangement that the
child doesn't owe the fiduciary

00:18:35.086 --> 00:18:35.868
anything.
 

00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:40.625
You elected to have that child
and you internalized the risk

00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:45.140
that that might happen when the
child turned eighteen.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.279
So Locke says,
"You're basically out of

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:48.788
luck.
 

00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:53.817
What you can do is threaten to
disinherit them but that's about

00:18:53.817 --> 00:18:54.710
it."
 

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.539
And indeed, I think that might
be the best argument for

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:02.726
allowing inherited wealth ever
devised that there's no other

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:05.990
way for parents to control their
children.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.940
But in any event,
short of that you're out of

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.410
luck.
 

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.140
So that's the notion of a
fiduciary relationship.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.190
The charge does not owe
anything to the fiduciary,

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:24.294
and the fiduciary relationship
persists only as long as the

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:29.661
charge is incapable of
exercising that authority for

00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:31.240
themselves.
 

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.320
So why think of the state as
having fiduciary authority over

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:43.711
basic interests and the parents
having fiduciary authority over

00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:45.670
best interests?
 

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:50.151
Well, one reason going in is
what I've already mentioned that

00:19:50.151 --> 00:19:54.708
once you think of an inevitably
hierarchical situation to some

00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:58.219
degree you want to have
hierarchies checking one

00:19:58.219 --> 00:20:02.880
another,
ambition counteracting ambition.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.630
But it's not just that.
 

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.048
It's more than that.
 

00:20:06.048 --> 00:20:11.319
If you think about basic
interests these have to do with

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:14.153
survival,
basic medical care,

00:20:14.153 --> 00:20:18.762
and so on, whereas best
interests have to do with the

00:20:18.762 --> 00:20:23.904
sorts of things it would be
absurd to think the state would

00:20:23.904 --> 00:20:27.538
be any good at:
knowing your child,

00:20:27.538 --> 00:20:31.838
caring deeply about your child,
wanting your child to survive,

00:20:31.838 --> 00:20:35.705
having what we called earlier
interdependent utilities that

00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:39.240
are connected to your child's
welfare and thriving.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.979
Those are not things that can
come from government officials

00:20:42.979 --> 00:20:46.910
almost by definition because
they involve things like care,

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:52.469
and affection,
and all of the things that make

00:20:52.469 --> 00:20:59.635
for the superabundant good of
rearing a happy child to have

00:20:59.635 --> 00:21:01.858
been realized.
 

00:21:01.858 --> 00:21:06.063
And indeed, when you think
about what is it that we think

00:21:06.063 --> 00:21:10.717
of as tragic when a child winds
up being raised in an orphanage

00:21:10.717 --> 00:21:13.568
is precisely that that is
missing.

00:21:13.568 --> 00:21:18.464
They're being raised by people
who do not care passionately and

00:21:18.464 --> 00:21:20.358
intimately about them.
 

00:21:20.358 --> 00:21:25.154
So you can see why it would
make obvious and intuitive sense

00:21:25.154 --> 00:21:28.650
to think of parents as the
guardians of,

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.390
fiduciary guardians of
children's best interests.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.993
Why should the state be the
fiduciary guardian of the basic

00:21:37.993 --> 00:21:42.758
interests, apart from the fact
that we don't want to have one

00:21:42.758 --> 00:21:43.868
hierarchy?
 

00:21:43.868 --> 00:21:48.861
Well, there are certain kinds
of things parents might choose

00:21:48.861 --> 00:21:53.936
to do out of convictions about
children's best interests that

00:21:53.936 --> 00:21:59.352
have an impact on their capacity
to survive and thrive as members

00:21:59.352 --> 00:22:04.512
of a democratic polity and as
able to function in the economic

00:22:04.512 --> 00:22:09.420
system as it's likely to exist
for their lifetime.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.026
The Amish chose,
in a famous case Wisconsin

00:22:13.026 --> 00:22:18.348
versus Yoder they wanted to keep
their kids out of school after

00:22:18.348 --> 00:22:22.900
age fourteen even though the
state of Wisconsin,

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.577
through its democratic
mechanisms had decided that you

00:22:26.577 --> 00:22:30.673
really need to go to the school
to the age of age sixteen in

00:22:30.673 --> 00:22:34.558
order to learn the skills
necessary to participate in the

00:22:34.558 --> 00:22:38.515
political order and in the
economy as it's likely to exist

00:22:38.515 --> 00:22:40.318
for your lifetime.
 

00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:46.019
The Amish didn't dispute that,
but what they said was,

00:22:46.019 --> 00:22:49.644
"We have learned from
experience that if we allow our

00:22:49.644 --> 00:22:52.380
kids to go to school after age
fourteen,

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.945
the odds that they will leave
the Amish community go way

00:22:55.945 --> 00:22:56.660
up."
 

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.300
Well, that's not a good
argument for allowing them to

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.048
prevent their kids getting an
education.

00:23:05.048 --> 00:23:10.013
And so I think the Supreme
Court made the wrong choice when

00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:13.608
it agreed with the parents in
that case.

00:23:13.608 --> 00:23:17.217
Or think of a different one,
where Christian Scientists are

00:23:17.217 --> 00:23:21.198
of the view that a child in need
of a blood transfusion shouldn't

00:23:21.198 --> 00:23:24.058
get it because of their
religious beliefs.

00:23:24.058 --> 00:23:27.528
And this is a case,
again, where I would argue,

00:23:27.528 --> 00:23:32.278
eventually if you can't
persuade them the parents should

00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:36.415
lose,
the state has a fiduciary

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:45.240
obligation to the child to allow
it to survive and not suffer the

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:53.650
consequences of not having a
lifesaving blood transfusion.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.797
On the other hand,
there are other cases we could

00:23:56.797 --> 00:23:57.650
talk about.
 

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.220
For instance,
parents might object and have

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.660
objected to certain kinds of
books being used in the schools,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.828
where the goal is to promote
literacy,

00:24:10.828 --> 00:24:16.346
on the grounds that they object
to the moral message within the

00:24:16.346 --> 00:24:17.058
books.
 

00:24:17.058 --> 00:24:20.291
And they go to court and they
challenge the use of certain

00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:23.808
kinds of books that convey moral
messages that the parents find

00:24:23.808 --> 00:24:24.828
objectionable.
 

00:24:24.828 --> 00:24:28.855
And in cases like that,
the burden should fall to the

00:24:28.855 --> 00:24:33.423
school district to show that
there isn't some other way they

00:24:33.423 --> 00:24:37.759
could meet their obligation to
teach literacy that didn't

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:41.400
infringe on the parents' best
interests,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.800
conception of the child's best
interest which includes their

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.450
moral education.
 

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.298
So in those kinds of cases the
parents should win.

00:24:52.298 --> 00:24:55.960
There will sometimes be murky
cases.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.463
There will sometimes be
disagreements about whether or

00:25:00.463 --> 00:25:05.818
not the state is vindicating the
basic interests in a way that's

00:25:05.818 --> 00:25:10.750
as unobtrusive as possible as
the parent's capacity to meet

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.788
the best interest.
 

00:25:12.788 --> 00:25:17.718
And I think you have to create
procedural mechanisms in which

00:25:17.718 --> 00:25:20.838
those disagreements are played
out,

00:25:20.838 --> 00:25:25.383
and much of that chapter that I
had you read for today is

00:25:25.383 --> 00:25:30.170
concerned with what those
procedural mechanisms might be.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:35.140
It's also the case that it
might change over time.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.914
So, for example,
we might initially think that

00:25:38.914 --> 00:25:43.949
things like sex education belong
in the area of best interest

00:25:43.949 --> 00:25:47.307
because this,
after all, has to do with the

00:25:47.307 --> 00:25:51.192
system of morality that a parent
wants to communicate to their

00:25:51.192 --> 00:25:55.592
child,
and we have deep pluralism of

00:25:55.592 --> 00:25:56.630
values.
 

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.284
Different parents have
different value systems and

00:26:00.284 --> 00:26:04.984
that's understood,
and therefore we don't want one

00:26:04.984 --> 00:26:11.255
moral code to be forced on all
children about matters of sexual

00:26:11.255 --> 00:26:14.568
morality,
and that could be the status

00:26:14.568 --> 00:26:16.068
quo for a long time.
 

00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:22.126
But then along comes AIDS and
suddenly sexual morality becomes

00:26:22.126 --> 00:26:27.460
a public health matter,
and so it then may recast how

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:32.675
we would think about the
division of fiduciary authority

00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:38.082
between parents and the state
over the sexual education of

00:26:38.082 --> 00:26:39.410
children.
 

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.553
And because it becomes a public
health issue it may be the case

00:26:44.553 --> 00:26:49.779
that one would insist on certain
kinds of sex education going on

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:53.605
in the schools,
although it would have to be

00:26:53.605 --> 00:26:57.940
designed to be as unobtrusive as
possible of the parent's

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.500
conception of the children's
best interest.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.608
And they'll tussle about that,
they'll disagree about it,

00:27:04.608 --> 00:27:08.416
they'll go to court,
but that is a healthy tussle

00:27:08.416 --> 00:27:13.178
from the point of view of the
larger conception of democratic

00:27:13.178 --> 00:27:14.130
justice.
 

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.971
Because really what you want to
do is have a system in which

00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:23.970
both hierarchical orders,
namely the parental fiduciary

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:29.463
order and the public fiduciary
order are to some extent held

00:27:29.463 --> 00:27:34.680
accountable and checked by the
claims of one another.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.140
And so this is one
institutional model,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.965
and it's actually not that
different from the one that

00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:44.970
exists in the U.S.
 

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:49.412
today when you think about it,
that the state does reserve

00:27:49.412 --> 00:27:52.920
authority over children's basic
interests,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.344
and when parents become
physically abusive or endanger

00:27:56.344 --> 00:28:00.042
the life of a child,
we will step in and do

00:28:00.042 --> 00:28:01.150
something.
 

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.170
But short of that,
for many very good reasons,

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:11.067
we leave the parent to decide
the best interest of the child

00:28:11.067 --> 00:28:14.470
immune from interference by the
state,

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:19.715
and we try to create mechanisms
that limit the ways in which

00:28:19.715 --> 00:28:25.141
fiduciary interests of the state
are vindicated so as to allow

00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:27.720
the freest possible hand.
 

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.630
Of course there are huge areas
of controversy with this because

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.972
often the state will delegate
its authority over basic

00:28:34.972 --> 00:28:38.289
interest to parents,
and so we'll allow private

00:28:38.289 --> 00:28:43.506
schools and that sort of thing,
and then we have to manage the

00:28:43.506 --> 00:28:49.116
resultant knock-on effects of
that when the school system

00:28:49.116 --> 00:28:52.653
fails,
or it teaches things that are

00:28:52.653 --> 00:28:57.371
at fundamental odds with the
principles of a democratic

00:28:57.371 --> 00:29:00.596
society,
and those sorts of tensions are

00:29:00.596 --> 00:29:03.900
inevitable once you have a
dual-regime system.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.830
And you need to create
mechanisms whether it's courts

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.778
or systems of administrative
appeal,

00:29:10.778 --> 00:29:17.075
or whatever it might be in
which these parties can check

00:29:17.075 --> 00:29:21.538
one another and hold them to
account.

00:29:21.538 --> 00:29:23.720
Because the state has so much
more power,

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:28.788
I argue the burden should often
be adjusted accordingly,

00:29:28.788 --> 00:29:32.712
and it should be easier for
parents to challenge what public

00:29:32.712 --> 00:29:35.440
officials do than the other way
around.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.422
And so you get into fine
nuances of institutional design

00:29:40.422 --> 00:29:46.130
that are intended to accommodate
the basic power disparities.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.041
But so that is,
if you like,

00:29:49.041 --> 00:29:55.730
an adapted Lockean view of how
one would think about governance

00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:02.308
over children that is modified
by the principles of democratic

00:30:02.308 --> 00:30:03.818
justice.
 

00:30:03.818 --> 00:30:07.673
Let's switch and talk about
employment relations,

00:30:07.673 --> 00:30:09.519
very different world.
 

00:30:09.519 --> 00:30:13.675
We're now dealing with
competent adults who are

00:30:13.675 --> 00:30:17.200
presumed to know their own
interests.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.989
We don't need to have fiduciary
arrangements and paternalistic

00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:26.026
judgments at all,
and we can imagine a system in

00:30:26.026 --> 00:30:30.220
which everybody takes care of
their own interests.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.848
Now, if you think about the
governance of the firm,

00:30:34.848 --> 00:30:39.179
as I said, firms are
hierarchical organizations in

00:30:39.179 --> 00:30:43.950
which employees have to do what
employers tell them.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:49.088
This is generally thought to be
efficient.

00:30:49.088 --> 00:30:56.460
There are debates about whether
firms are too hierarchical.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.406
If they become too
hierarchical,

00:30:58.406 --> 00:31:00.480
they may become less efficient.
 

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:06.011
And indeed, in the 1960s and
'70s there was a movement trying

00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:11.635
to argue that democratically-run
firms would be more efficient

00:31:11.635 --> 00:31:15.140
than hierarchically ordered
firms.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.613
Huge literature on that,
but the best book on this

00:31:18.613 --> 00:31:21.519
subject was written by Henry
Hansmann,

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:24.853
now in the Yale Law School,
a book which I commend to you

00:31:24.853 --> 00:31:27.769
all called The Ownership of
Enterprise,

00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:32.227
which I discuss some in that
chapter on democracy in the

00:31:32.227 --> 00:31:33.200
workplace.
 

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.888
And Hansmann pointed out that
if democratically-run firms were

00:31:37.888 --> 00:31:41.347
more efficient,
we would have seen them emerge

00:31:41.347 --> 00:31:43.269
all over the economy.
 

00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:47.615
If democratically-run firms
were more efficient they would

00:31:47.615 --> 00:31:50.818
have outcompeted the
hierarchical firms.

00:31:50.818 --> 00:31:55.748
And indeed in the '60s and
'70s, part of the reason people

00:31:55.748 --> 00:32:00.676
made those arguments was they
observed that Japanese firms

00:32:00.676 --> 00:32:05.259
were much less hierarchical than
American firms,

00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:08.588
and also they thought they were
much more efficient.

00:32:08.588 --> 00:32:12.358
There were all these studies
showing Japanese car firms had

00:32:12.358 --> 00:32:16.000
three layers of management
whereas American car firms had

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.088
seven layers of management,
and Japanese car firms were

00:32:20.088 --> 00:32:21.278
more efficient.
 

00:32:21.278 --> 00:32:25.761
That didn't look so good after
the 1990s rolled in and Japanese

00:32:25.761 --> 00:32:29.450
firms turned out not to be very
efficient at all.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:34.319
There were similar arguments
about what appeared to be

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:39.924
democratic firms in a part of
Italy called Mondragone that was

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:45.452
thought to be very efficient,
but subsequent studies showed

00:32:45.452 --> 00:32:50.424
that actually these firms were
not very democratically-run at

00:32:50.424 --> 00:32:54.982
all and they were basically
controlled by the banks that

00:32:54.982 --> 00:32:57.470
controlled their capital.
 

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:05.327
And so it was rather na�ve to
expect democratic firms to be

00:33:05.327 --> 00:33:06.900
efficient.
 

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.608
And indeed, as Henry Hansmann
points out,

00:33:09.608 --> 00:33:14.885
you only really find that
democratic firms are efficient

00:33:14.885 --> 00:33:21.410
in circumstances where everybody
can do every job like law firms,

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.537
or taxicab companies,
or plywood co-ops in the

00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:29.578
northwestern US,
where everybody has an

00:33:29.578 --> 00:33:31.880
interchangeable role.
 

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:38.019
Then democracy doesn't come at
any cost to efficiency.

00:33:38.019 --> 00:33:41.243
This is a combination of the
ancient ruling and being ruled

00:33:41.243 --> 00:33:41.798
in turn.
 

00:33:41.798 --> 00:33:47.750
If we can all do everything we
can be egalitarian about it.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:52.394
And the Buchanan and Tullock
observation that I talked to you

00:33:52.394 --> 00:33:55.150
about earlier,
namely when we have

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.623
disagreements and you create a
lot of procedure that will be

00:33:59.623 --> 00:34:04.019
time consuming precisely because
we have disagreements.

00:34:04.019 --> 00:34:05.720
We have different interests.
 

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.347
So Hansmann says,
"In large firms or firms

00:34:08.347 --> 00:34:11.090
where you have old workers and
young workers,

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.371
they'll have very different
interests on things like

00:34:14.371 --> 00:34:15.079
pensions.
 

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:17.010
Young workers will want one
thing.

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.018
Old workers will want something
else.

00:34:19.018 --> 00:34:22.811
And if you start to have a lot
of democratic procedure in those

00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:26.297
kinds of circumstances it's
going to come at an efficiency

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:29.905
cost because they're going to be
sitting in meetings all day

00:34:29.905 --> 00:34:33.454
arguing about their pension
benefits and not working on the

00:34:33.454 --> 00:34:34.800
assembly line.
 

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.840
So it's not surprising,"
Hansmann says,

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.226
"that in most industries,
in fact, you do not get

00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:44.489
democratic firms for efficiency
reasons."

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.250
Efficiency is the superordinate
good.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:51.646
Firms are there to produce
goods and services that make

00:34:51.646 --> 00:34:54.106
money,
and if you don't do it more

00:34:54.106 --> 00:34:57.751
efficiently than the next person
you're going to go out of

00:34:57.751 --> 00:34:58.518
business.
 

00:34:58.518 --> 00:35:03.994
So from the point of view of
pure efficiency it seems like

00:35:03.994 --> 00:35:09.469
you're not going to get a lot of
democracy in the firm.

00:35:09.469 --> 00:35:15.050
That's the cold harsh reality
from the perspective of 2010.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:19.333
And the literature advocating
democratic firms has this kind

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:23.398
of kumbaya quality that is
difficult to take seriously in

00:35:23.398 --> 00:35:25.360
the contemporary world.
 

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.230
Firms are going to be
hierarchical.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:32.719
Then we have the problem,
well, so how should we think

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:35.940
about the hierarchies within
firms,

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:45.670
given the fact that they're
sites of greatly unequal

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:50.250
distribution of power?
 

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:55.150
So different players have
different options.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.704
For instance,
if you, and this is where I

00:35:57.704 --> 00:36:02.371
would disagree with Hansmann,
if you're a shareholder in a

00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:06.960
firm and you don't like what the
firm is doing,

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.480
you have a very easy option.
 

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.610
You can just sell your shares
and buy shares in another firm.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.630
No problem there.
 

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.768
And so Hansmann says we should
think of shareholders as

00:36:22.768 --> 00:36:26.369
enforcing democratic
accountability in firms.

00:36:26.369 --> 00:36:31.309
I don't think that's a very
plausible way to go because

00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:34.969
shareholders have very low exit
costs.

00:36:34.969 --> 00:36:39.864
If you don't like the way a
firm is run you buy shares in a

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.300
different firm.
 

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.833
They're not going to exercise
much democratic control of what

00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:47.800
goes on within the firm.
 

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.659
Think about employees in a firm.
 

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:56.130
Well, it depends a lot on the
situation.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:03.449
So just to fix intuitions
consider this.

00:37:03.449 --> 00:37:07.079
Why do I talk about a surfer's
paradise?

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:10.503
The Belgian political
philosopher Philippe Van Parijs

00:37:10.503 --> 00:37:14.320
wrote a book called Real
Freedom for All in which he

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.510
said--
it's a kind of post-Rawlsian

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.320
book about justice.
 

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.172
Van Parijs, he runs something,
by the way, called the Basic

00:37:23.172 --> 00:37:26.329
Income Network,
which I urge you to take a look

00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:27.530
at his website.
 

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.179
It's quite interesting.
 

00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:32.161
He basically says,
"Everybody should be paid

00:37:32.161 --> 00:37:35.639
the highest sustainable wage
regardless of work."

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:39.929
This is sort of Sweden on crack
or something.

00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:42.300
Everybody should be paid the
highest.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.349
Even surfers should be paid.
 

00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:46.260
That's Van Parijs' view.
 

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.610
In European parlance,
it's called the social wage.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:55.739
They should have the highest
social wage possible.

00:37:55.739 --> 00:38:00.893
So imagine that that a surfer's
paradise is the utopia Van

00:38:00.893 --> 00:38:06.139
Parijs defends in that book
Real Freedom for All.

00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:10.556
Think at the other end of a
continuum what we might call a

00:38:10.556 --> 00:38:12.340
Dickensian nightmare.
 

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:17.438
A world in which there's no
health insurance,

00:38:17.438 --> 00:38:22.420
no unemployment insurance,
no welfare state,

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.130
no social security,
nothing.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:31.255
So obviously every actual
economy exists somewhere on this

00:38:31.255 --> 00:38:36.110
continuum from the Dickensian
nightmare to the surfer's

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.280
paradise.
 

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.188
And so what I want to say is,
"Well, that affects a lot

00:38:41.188 --> 00:38:43.840
of what goes on within the
firm."

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:51.239
Because if we're living in a
Dickensian nightmare--go back to

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:55.679
the example I mentioned last
time.

00:38:55.679 --> 00:38:59.027
Think of an employer who's in a
hierarchical relationship with a

00:38:59.027 --> 00:39:01.099
secretary and says to the
secretary,

00:39:01.099 --> 00:39:06.623
"Unless you go to bed with
me I'm going to make sure you

00:39:06.623 --> 00:39:08.280
get fired."
 

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:13.530
So now an employer is abusing
the position in the hierarchy.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:20.016
Well, if this is a Dickensian
nightmare, the secretary's going

00:39:20.016 --> 00:39:25.867
to be terrified because the
costs of losing that job are

00:39:25.867 --> 00:39:27.250
enormous.
 

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:28.429
They're going to lose their
health insurance.

00:39:28.429 --> 00:39:30.677
There's no unemployment et
cetera, et cetera,

00:39:30.677 --> 00:39:31.289
et cetera.
 

00:39:31.289 --> 00:39:38.929
You're going to be thrown out
into a pretty horrible cauldron.

00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:45.766
If you're living in a surfer's
paradise the secretary can walk

00:39:45.766 --> 00:39:50.250
away at much lower cost to
themselves.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:55.523
And I'm not talking about the
question whether the secretary

00:39:55.523 --> 00:39:59.483
is actually fired,
or actually walks away,

00:39:59.483 --> 00:40:04.286
but simply the knowledge both
parties have that in the

00:40:04.286 --> 00:40:09.269
Dickensian nightmare the exit
cost for the secretary are

00:40:09.269 --> 00:40:12.204
enormous,
whereas in the surfer's

00:40:12.204 --> 00:40:16.039
paradise the exit costs for the
secretary are very low.

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:20.380
That structures the power
relations within the firm.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:25.186
So the basic intuition here is
when we ask the question,

00:40:25.186 --> 00:40:30.869
"How much should the state
regulate what goes on in firms?

00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:34.650
The answer is,
"Well, it depends."

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:39.811
It depends upon where you are
on this continuum because if

00:40:39.811 --> 00:40:45.155
you're closer to a surfer's
paradise there's less reason for

00:40:45.155 --> 00:40:50.317
the state to create lots of
protections for workers within

00:40:50.317 --> 00:40:55.389
the firm which are going to come
at an efficiency cost by

00:40:55.389 --> 00:40:57.110
assumption.
 

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:01.641
Appeals, processes,
defense of union rights,

00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:06.807
grievance procedures,
burden shifting to employers

00:41:06.807 --> 00:41:09.760
when there are disputes.
 

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.480
All of that comes at an
efficiency cost.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:19.489
But so the notion is that if
it's a Dickensian nightmare,

00:41:19.489 --> 00:41:22.949
the worker's basic interests
are threatened,

00:41:22.949 --> 00:41:28.150
then democratic justice would
not say the worker should

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:32.989
internalize those costs,
rather the employer should.

00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:37.559
But as you move towards the
surfer's paradise then there's

00:41:37.559 --> 00:41:42.130
more reason to say that the
worker can internalize some of

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:46.461
the costs of hierarchy in the
firm because the costs of

00:41:46.461 --> 00:41:49.670
leaving are comparatively
smaller.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:53.373
And so you have,
as I said, a semi-contextual

00:41:53.373 --> 00:41:54.300
argument.
 

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.293
What this regime should be like
depends on the power

00:41:58.293 --> 00:42:03.070
externalities within which the
power internalities of the firm

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.949
actually take place.
 

00:42:04.949 --> 00:42:10.724
And one of the desirable
features of this I think is that

00:42:10.724 --> 00:42:16.398
it leads you to rethink
relationship between capital and

00:42:16.398 --> 00:42:17.429
labor.
 

00:42:17.429 --> 00:42:21.911
Marx thought that's the basic
conflict, workers on one side

00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:23.690
capital on the other.
 

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.519
But now if you think,
say, about something like

00:42:26.519 --> 00:42:27.690
health insurance.
 

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:30.972
We have a system now where
health insurance is provided

00:42:30.972 --> 00:42:34.143
through employment,
which moves you more into the

00:42:34.143 --> 00:42:37.873
Dickensian nightmare direction
because you lose your job you

00:42:37.873 --> 00:42:39.768
lose your health insurance.
 

00:42:39.768 --> 00:42:45.949
And employers compete with one
another by offering--

00:42:45.949 --> 00:42:49.961
you know, Yale says,
"We offer better health

00:42:49.961 --> 00:42:53.639
benefits than working for
whatever it is,

00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:56.719
Harvard or Columbia."
 

00:42:56.719 --> 00:43:00.380
So employers compete with one
another,

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:05.018
but the truth is all of the
employers would be better off if

00:43:05.018 --> 00:43:10.130
they didn't have to compete and
everybody had health insurance.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.909
So there's a kind of collective
action problem.

00:43:13.909 --> 00:43:16.849
What looks like,
especially once we get into

00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:21.429
strikes and bargaining disputes
between employees and employers,

00:43:21.429 --> 00:43:26.161
what looks like a conflict
between capital and labor can be

00:43:26.161 --> 00:43:30.072
re-conceptualized as,
really, it's a collective

00:43:30.072 --> 00:43:32.260
action problem among firms.
 

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:37.989
They all compete at the margin
over things like benefits,

00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:41.643
but in fact they would be
better off if health benefits

00:43:41.643 --> 00:43:45.364
were taken off the table
entirely and funded through the

00:43:45.364 --> 00:43:46.380
tax system.
 

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:51.172
So what looks like a conflict
between capital and labor is

00:43:51.172 --> 00:43:55.460
actually a collective action
problem among firms.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.369
Another advantage of this,
I think,

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:03.438
is that it does not put the
best in conflict with the good

00:44:03.438 --> 00:44:09.041
in that to the extent you have a
regime like this you give firms

00:44:09.041 --> 00:44:14.021
the incentive to support the
expansion of the social wage

00:44:14.021 --> 00:44:17.489
because what do capitalists
want?

00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:18.518
What do managers want most?
 

00:44:18.518 --> 00:44:22.130
They want flexibility at the
plant level.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:24.000
They want to be able to turn on
a dime,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.929
and layoff people,
and do something differently,

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:29.492
and compete in the twenty-first
century in a totally new way

00:44:29.492 --> 00:44:33.114
than they were competing two
years before because that's what

00:44:33.114 --> 00:44:33.900
you need.
 

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.952
The name of the game is
flexibility, adaptability,

00:44:36.952 --> 00:44:38.760
nimbleness, all that stuff.
 

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.050
That's what firms want.
 

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:41.809
That's what they need.
 

00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:46.000
And if they know that the
closer you get to a Dickensian

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.268
nightmare the more cumbersome
regulation they're going to

00:44:50.268 --> 00:44:52.757
have,
and the more you move toward a

00:44:52.757 --> 00:44:55.639
surfer's paradise the less
you're going to have,

00:44:55.639 --> 00:45:01.552
then they have an incentive to
try and move the society toward

00:45:01.552 --> 00:45:03.880
the surfer's paradise.
 

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.675
So corporations will get behind
expansions of health insurance

00:45:08.675 --> 00:45:09.619
and so on.
 

00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:13.581
And there's a certain realism
to that because if you go and

00:45:13.581 --> 00:45:17.340
study the history of the
expansions of the welfare state

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:21.302
despite what you might read in
the newspapers what you will

00:45:21.302 --> 00:45:25.539
find is it never happens unless
business gets behind it.

00:45:25.539 --> 00:45:27.690
The big expansions of the
social wage,

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.672
the big expansions of the
welfare state even in countries

00:45:31.672 --> 00:45:36.010
like Sweden have only occurred
in circumstances where business

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:38.500
gets behind it and supports it.
 

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.597
So you want an industrial
management regime that

00:45:42.597 --> 00:45:48.179
distributes the incentives in
such a way that they will do it.

00:45:48.179 --> 00:45:53.240
So those are two examples of
how we can think about

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.594
democratizing the power
dimensions of social

00:45:57.594 --> 00:46:03.768
institutions while interfering
with the superordinate goods as

00:46:03.768 --> 00:46:06.300
little as possible.
 

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.927
And that's the basic impulse of
the argument of democratic

00:46:10.927 --> 00:46:11.739
justice.
 

00:46:11.739 --> 00:46:16.402
Now if you take a step back and
you think about democracy over

00:46:16.402 --> 00:46:20.847
the past couple of centuries,
you know, I talked to you some

00:46:20.847 --> 00:46:22.780
about Alexis de Tocqueville.
 

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.018
He made two points about
democracy.

00:46:26.018 --> 00:46:28.159
He had a love-hate relationship
with it.

00:46:28.159 --> 00:46:31.170
I told you he was in many ways
a critic of it,

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:35.518
but he did say two things about
it, one that it was inevitable.

00:46:35.518 --> 00:46:38.458
"The gradual progress of
democracy,"

00:46:38.458 --> 00:46:42.378
he said in the preface to the
1848 edition of Democracy in

00:46:42.378 --> 00:46:46.340
America,
"is something fated.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.139
It's providential.
 

00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:49.880
It can't be stopped."
 

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.050
And the other thing he said is
that, "The thing about

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.110
democracy is it has wild
instincts.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.481
What we need to do is try and
domesticate it,

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:58.559
not get rid of it.
 

00:46:58.559 --> 00:46:59.590
We can't get rid of it.
 

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:03.590
We can't stop it so we must
domesticate it."

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:07.780
Well, I think both of those
claims were partly correct.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:13.380
It is true Tocqueville was
correct to think that democracy

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:17.409
is an idea with world-historical
force.

00:47:17.409 --> 00:47:22.628
It will always be appealed to
by people who experience

00:47:22.628 --> 00:47:27.648
injustice,
and they will always demand

00:47:27.648 --> 00:47:35.126
democratization if they find
their social circumstances

00:47:35.126 --> 00:47:37.619
unsatisfactory.
 

00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:41.480
So I think this notion is
partly right.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:46.137
But even though democracy is an
idea with world-historical

00:47:46.137 --> 00:47:50.876
force, I think he was partly
wrong to say that the progress

00:47:50.876 --> 00:47:53.409
of democracy is inevitable.
 

00:47:53.409 --> 00:47:59.260
There have always been advances
for democracy and then setbacks.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.079
We had the French Revolution.
 

00:48:01.079 --> 00:48:02.559
We had a disaster.
 

00:48:02.559 --> 00:48:06.809
In 1830 we had a democratic
revolution sweep Europe.

00:48:06.809 --> 00:48:11.179
By 1832 the monarchies had been
restored.

00:48:11.179 --> 00:48:15.748
1848, again,
we had democratic revolutions

00:48:15.748 --> 00:48:19.983
sweep Europe,
and by 1851 they had been

00:48:19.983 --> 00:48:21.210
undone.
 

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:24.940
1989, we had democratic
revolutions,

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.141
huge new wave of democracy,
but some of those democracies

00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:32.219
came under real threat in places
like--

00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:38.639
fell apart in Algeria in 1991.
 

00:48:38.639 --> 00:48:42.657
We know what happened in
Rwanda, although things have

00:48:42.657 --> 00:48:44.820
turned around again since.
 

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.949
Or if we look at Pakistan in
the last three or four years.

00:48:48.949 --> 00:48:54.289
We see that we shouldn't think
of democracy as inevitable,

00:48:54.289 --> 00:48:59.818
this sort of Francis Fukuyama
idea that history is intending

00:48:59.818 --> 00:49:01.880
in some direction.
 

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.945
To the extent you think
democracy is valuable really

00:49:05.945 --> 00:49:10.650
what you have to do is work to
promote it and sustain it.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:16.088
Likewise when we talk about
Tocqueville's second observation

00:49:16.088 --> 00:49:20.789
that democracy has wild
instincts and it needs to be

00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:22.079
reined in.
 

00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:25.869
We need to, as he put it,
"educate democracy to

00:49:25.869 --> 00:49:30.326
limit its wild instincts,"
and make sure that it doesn't

00:49:30.326 --> 00:49:35.018
destroy other good things,
superordinate goods.

00:49:35.018 --> 00:49:38.128
In his case,
of course, freedom was the most

00:49:38.128 --> 00:49:42.539
important good that he didn't
want democracy to compromise.

00:49:42.539 --> 00:49:45.833
But I think the same argument
applies with respect to

00:49:45.833 --> 00:49:49.867
efficiency,
with respect to many of the

00:49:49.867 --> 00:49:56.630
superordinate goods that people
strive after and cherish.

00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:01.947
So we always have to be wary of
the capacity of democracy to

00:50:01.947 --> 00:50:04.110
undermine other goods.
 

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:08.139
But, and this is where I think
Tocqueville overstated the case,

00:50:08.139 --> 00:50:13.057
that does not mean we should
overlook democracy's capacity to

00:50:13.057 --> 00:50:16.010
undermine bad things in the
world.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:20.947
To the extent we can
democratize power relations

00:50:20.947 --> 00:50:25.989
without interfering with
superordinate goods,

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:29.545
we can have a tremendous effect
for good whether it's the

00:50:29.545 --> 00:50:32.838
abolition of slavery,
whether it's the limiting of

00:50:32.838 --> 00:50:37.719
exploitation in the workplace,
whether it's the protection or

00:50:37.719 --> 00:50:42.867
the restructuring of the law of
marriage to prevent the

00:50:42.867 --> 00:50:45.059
domination of women.
 

00:50:45.059 --> 00:50:49.123
These are all areas in which
the basic democratic impulse to

00:50:49.123 --> 00:50:52.500
democratize social relations has
improved them.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.230
And so it doesn't mean it'll
always be successful.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:57.880
Sometimes it'll fail.
 

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:02.179
It requires creative ingenuity,
the capacity to try things out

00:51:02.179 --> 00:51:05.000
and change them when they don't
work,

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.219
but the basic impulse of
democratic justice is to take

00:51:09.219 --> 00:51:13.262
inherited institutions,
democratize them as we

00:51:13.262 --> 00:51:18.684
reproduce them into the future,
leaving a better world than we

00:51:18.684 --> 00:51:19.260
found.
 

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.429
Thank you very much.
 

00:51:20.429 --> 00:51:29.000

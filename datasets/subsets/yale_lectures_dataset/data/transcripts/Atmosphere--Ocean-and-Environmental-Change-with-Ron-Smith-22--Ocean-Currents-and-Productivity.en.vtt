RONALD SMITH: Right in the
middle of a section on

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:05.733
oceanography.

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.567
We started about a week ago.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:12.133
And we started by talking
about ocean basins.

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.533
We talked about the salt in
the sea, where that comes

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.867
from, how it's distributed.

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.733
And now we're getting
into ocean currents.

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.467
And I began this subject last
time, but I wanted--

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:26.200
before I get into the subject
again, I wanted to tell you

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.800
what we're trying to do,
in terms of the way we

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.467
organize--the way oceanographers
organize their

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.700
thinking about ocean currents.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.567
For the most part, we try to
break them down into two broad

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:44.200
categories thermohaline
and wind driven.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.400
And you could define them, I
guess, in the simplest way.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.533
Thermohaline would be all
currents that are driven by

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:57.667
the density differences
in the ocean.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:01.567
Thermohaline is the name for
that, because temperature and

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.067
salt determine the density.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:08.200
And then gravity acts on those
density differences to produce

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.933
so-called thermohaline
circulations.

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:15.133
And we can't really do this
experiment, but at least in

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:19.600
the back of our minds, we can
imagine that if we turned off

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.200
all the forcing at the ocean
surface that related to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000
temperature and salt for
example, we shut off all the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.400
heat fluxes in and out of the
ocean, and we shut off all the

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.067
fresh water fluxes in and out of
the ocean, the thermohaline

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:42.133
circulation should cease.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.667
So at least that would
be their definition.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:46.833
If we turned off that kind
of forcing, then those

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.600
circulations would stop.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.300
Wind driven is driven by the
wind stresses at the surface

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.367
of the ocean.

00:01:55.367 --> 00:02:00.533
And there again, a way to define
that, or perhaps an

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:03.967
imaginary one would be, if you
could magically turn off all

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:09.967
the winds, then perhaps not at
that instant, but over some

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:14.633
days or weeks, all the wind
driven currents in the oceans

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.267
would cease.

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:20.300
Now, the thing to remember,
though, about both of these

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.300
types of currents, they're
not driven

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.033
locally by those forces.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:28.667
In other words, you could have
wind blowing from west to

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:37.167
east, and have, at that same
location, wind driven currents

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:40.667
in the opposite direction.

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:46.833
For example, these large gyres
are driven by the mean wind

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.533
stresses, westerlies in
mid-latitudes, easterlies in

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:51.633
low latitudes.

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:54.700
And there well may be, in fact,
there are many places in

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.167
the ocean where the local wind
driven currents are opposite

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:00.467
to the local winds.

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:04.133
So don't get confused by that.

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:05.667
They're still wind
driven currents.

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:09.667
If you turned off all the wind
stresses, those currents would

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:13.300
cease over time.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.667
Now, the problem with this nice,
clean categorization is

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.633
that there are some ocean
currents that seem to be

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:23.733
driven by a mix of
the two things.

00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:26.367
For example, the Gulf Stream,
which I'll be talking about

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.900
today, is generally considered
by oceanographers to be a wind

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.500
driven current.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.267
On the other hand, it carries
warm water northward, some of

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:43.233
which cools and sinks, and
returns underneath in the deep

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:46.667
ocean, towards the south
as a colder current.

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:48.433
So at that point, it seems
to be more of a

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:50.833
thermohaline current.

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:54.833
So some fraction of the Gulf
Stream, quote, wind driven,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:57.900
returns southward as a
thermohaline current.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.600
So there is an example where
we can't quite make that

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.600
distinction as cleanly
as we might like.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.667
We just have to live
with that, though.

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:11.867
And as our models of ocean
currents become more

00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:16.633
sophisticated, we can try to
apply those definitions more

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:19.767
and more securely to
understanding these

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:21.767
differences.

00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:24.967
Any questions on that?

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:30.100
So I'll just back up for a
moment or two here, and remind

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.667
you what we talked about with
respect to thermohaline

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:36.667
circulations.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.067
They're driven by density.

00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:43.067
Typically, they tend to be slow
currents, probably no

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:47.967
more than maybe a couple of
centimeters per second.

00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:49.733
Like about this.

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:52.100
Maybe even slower
in the ocean.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.433
So they're quite slow.

00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:56.067
They do, however, extend, in
some cases, right down to the

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:59.100
bottom of the ocean.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.100
As opposed to wind driven
currents, which are usually in

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.167
the upper kilometer, so the
upper fifth or so, of the

00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:08.033
ocean column.

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:10.367
They're responsible for the
water mass distributions.

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:13.733
We talked about the ones
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:17.300
That conveyor belt circulation
between the Pacific and the

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.167
Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:22.233
And these estuaries, and inverse
estuary circulations

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:26.367
are all thermohaline
circulations.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:27.667
We talked about that.

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:37.433
Stop me if you have any
questions on these sections.

00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:38.433
We went over them before.

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:41.967
That was a north-south section
for temperature in the

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:46.467
Atlantic, for salinity
in the Atlantic.

00:05:46.467 --> 00:05:47.833
Oh, I didn't mention
one thing that

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:49.800
probably should be discussed.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.033
There was this blob of salty
water you'd expect the water

00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:57.567
in the tropics and subtropics
to be salty, because there's

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:00.733
an excess of evaporation at
the surface of the ocean.

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:06.367
But what explains this blob of
salty water is actually that

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:09.533
outflow from the Mediterranean
Sea.

00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:14.033
That salty outflow from the
Mediterranean Sea then moves

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:18.600
westward across the Atlantic
Ocean, and catches us in this

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.867
north-south section.

00:06:19.867 --> 00:06:23.433
So this is if that's north and
that's south, then that's west

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:26.733
and that's east. This is the
Mediterranean water coming

00:06:26.733 --> 00:06:32.633
into this section from the east
as an outflow from the

00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:32.800
Mediterranean.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.067
So it flows over the sill
there in the Straits of

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:40.767
Gibraltar, flows down till it
finds it's appropriate density

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:45.267
level, where the water above
it is less dense, the water

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:46.633
below it is more dense.

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:50.367
And then it floats horizontally
as a tongue of

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:54.333
salty water, finally reaching
that section.

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:57.800
It's part of the reason why the
North Atlantic deep water

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.200
is generally salty, because the
Mediterranean water gets

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.100
entrained into that North
Atlantic deep water.

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:12.033
We talked about the oxygen.

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:16.567
And this was the summary of the
in a north-south section

00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:19.433
of the Atlantic Ocean
thermohaline circulations.

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:23.100
Any questions on this?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.267
So this is the Antarctic
intermediate water, the North

00:07:26.267 --> 00:07:29.367
Atlantic deep water, and the
Antarctic bottom water.

00:07:33.467 --> 00:07:36.767
We talked about this.

00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:37.167
OK.

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:40.200
Now, I got into wind driven
currents a bit.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.067
I want to review that as well.

00:07:42.067 --> 00:07:46.767
The chain of events, as we
understand it today, is that

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:54.633
the wind stress produces a
shallow transport of water in

00:07:54.633 --> 00:07:57.433
the layer that feels that
wind stress directly.

00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:01.333
That's a pretty shallow layer,
probably only 100 meters deep.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:06.967
And in that layer, the water
gets pushed off to the right

00:08:06.967 --> 00:08:10.633
of the wind stress, in the
Northern Hemisphere.

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:14.300
That Ekman layer transport
piles up water.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.667
For example, in the middle of
the North Atlantic gyre,

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:22.867
there's this piling up
of Ekman layer drift.

00:08:22.867 --> 00:08:29.600
And that, in turn, that slight
non-uniformity in the height

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.567
of the ocean surface, generates
pressure gradients

00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:37.600
beneath horizontal pressure
gradients that then generate

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.033
geostrophic ocean currents.

00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:42.133
I mentioned that we can now
measure this, and I'll show

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:44.267
you that plot again
in just a moment.

00:08:44.267 --> 00:08:46.833
But it dawned on me that I
forgot to mention that there

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:50.567
were clues to this, even
in the early days.

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:55.533
For example, the center of the
North Atlantic gyre is

00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:59.733
referred to as the
Sargasso Sea.

00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:00.800
Does anyone know where
that term,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.133
Sargasso Sea, comes from?

00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:03.967
It's an old term.

00:09:03.967 --> 00:09:07.833
It goes back several
hundred years.

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:11.467
If you take a ship across the
Atlantic, through the middle

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:15.333
of this gyre, when you get into
that region of the ocean,

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:21.233
you begin to see floating
pockets of plant material.

00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:24.967
It's mostly sargassum weed.

00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:25.833
It's floating there.

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:30.233
And the reason why it's
collected there is because of

00:09:30.233 --> 00:09:33.333
the Ekman currents
pushing it there.

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:38.300
So we had some clue that that
was a region of convergence,

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.433
even before we could measure
that sea surface height

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:44.033
anomaly from satellites.

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:47.367
If you dumped in and now that
there's more pollution in the

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:51.600
ocean, people have dumped loads
of trash into the ocean

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.967
that floats, some of that
is found in the

00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:56.133
Sargasso Sea as well.

00:09:56.133 --> 00:10:00.533
It's just an area where water
tends to collect, and then, of

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:01.767
course, sink eventually.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:05.667
But in the collecting, all the
things that float remain kind

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:08.400
of gathered there in the
middle of the ocean.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.233
We've also found these
gatherings in the middle of

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.567
the other ocean gyres.

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:17.833
So there's evidence that ocean
water does collect there, and

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:19.967
the things that float are
still found there.

00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:23.167
So the fact that it's called the
Sargasso Sea gives another

00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:26.167
clue to this sequence
of events.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.267
So there's the winds, and
there's the ocean topography,

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:37.400
as measured from space.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.667
With units in centimeters,
typically it's only a

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:43.233
topography of about like this.

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:44.933
You would never notice
it if you were

00:10:44.933 --> 00:10:45.967
sailing through there.

00:10:45.967 --> 00:10:50.700
But the water is slightly higher
there than the geoid of

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.167
the earth, there's a surface
you can imagine, nearly a

00:10:55.167 --> 00:11:02.733
sphere, which we consider
to be the level surface.

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:06.200
And this rises slightly above
that level surface.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.467
And then, in turn, gives rise
to the pressure gradients

00:11:09.467 --> 00:11:11.667
underneath that.

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:13.100
And these are the wind
driven currents.

00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:19.533
I don't want you to memorize all
these names, except some

00:11:19.533 --> 00:11:22.267
of them probably should be
known, and some of them are

00:11:22.267 --> 00:11:24.933
quite obvious, that it's
hard, once you've seen

00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:26.000
them, not to know them.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.233
For example, the Brazil Current
runs down the coast of

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:32.467
Brazil, the Peru Current runs
up the coast of Peru, the

00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:37.433
California Current, the Alaska
Current, the West Australian

00:11:37.433 --> 00:11:39.233
Current, the East Australian
current.

00:11:39.233 --> 00:11:44.167
Pretty hard to forget those
once you've seen them.

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:49.067
The Gulf Stream is part of
the North Atlantic gyre.

00:11:49.067 --> 00:11:52.600
The word gyre is spelled
G-Y-R-E, and it refers to

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.600
these circular current systems.
Forced to be circular

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.267
because the continents prevent
them from going all the way

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:03.700
around the earth.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.700
Only in the southern ocean,
where you get the Antarctic

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.767
Circumpolar Current, do you get
a current going all the

00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:10.633
way around the ocean.

00:12:10.633 --> 00:12:13.700
Otherwise, the continents break
up these wind driven

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.000
currents into gyres.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.633
The North Atlantic Gyre consists
of the Gulf Stream,

00:12:18.633 --> 00:12:21.700
the North Atlantic Drift, the
Canary Current, and the North

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.400
Equatorial Current.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.033
Some of the Gulf Stream,
however, breaks off and

00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:31.100
becomes the North Atlantic
Drift, which eventually goes

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.300
into the Arctic Ocean.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.967
You can have reverse currents
in the very high latitudes,

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.133
like the Alaska Current.

00:12:40.133 --> 00:12:44.833
Notice that goes opposite to the
main North Pacific Gyre.

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:47.833
And the Labrador Current, in
a sense, goes a little bit

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:53.000
opposite to the North Atlantic
Gyre, as well.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.333
The equivalent to the Gulf
Stream in the Pacific Ocean is

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:58.833
the Kuroshio Current.

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:01.900
And there's a lot of studies
kind of comparing those two

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.267
currents, because they play the
equivalent role in the two

00:13:06.267 --> 00:13:09.567
large Northern Hemisphere
basins.

00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:11.000
They're both warm currents.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.033
And you can find equivalent
things in the Southern

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:14.667
Hemisphere as well.

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:18.067
The three warm currents would
be the Brazil Current, the

00:13:18.067 --> 00:13:21.333
Agulhas Current, and the East
Australian Current.

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:24.800
Each returning equatorially
warmed water down into the

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.967
high latitude colder areas.

00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:32.567
Near the equator, things can
get pretty complicated.

00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:35.067
You can have an equatorial
counter current.

00:13:35.067 --> 00:13:40.900
And notice that this would be
the region of the trade winds.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.667
Blowing from east to west. And
yet, there's the counter

00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:48.600
current, a wind driven current,
I propose to you.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.900
And yet it's running opposite
to the local wind direction.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.500
So that's one of those confusing
points where the

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.767
winds don't always seem
to be pushing the

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:02.500
currents around locally.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.033
But then again, that has to do
with this indirect effect.

00:14:05.033 --> 00:14:09.367
It's not just the wind blowing
on the water to make it move.

00:14:09.367 --> 00:14:12.167
You've got that chain of events,
the Ekman layer, the

00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:15.433
piling up of the water, and then
the geostrophic currents.

00:14:15.433 --> 00:14:22.033
It's not a direct, air pushes
water, water moves scenario.

00:14:22.033 --> 00:14:24.967
It's a little more complicated
than that.

00:14:24.967 --> 00:14:29.033
Another interesting fact, which
is why we have to have

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:33.333
this slightly more complex
theory, is that these ocean

00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:36.767
currents, for the most part,
do extend about a kilometer

00:14:36.767 --> 00:14:39.300
down into the ocean.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.667
They don't extend
to the bottom.

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:44.000
But they extend about a
kilometer down, and that's far

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.500
deeper than the wind stress
is felt directly.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.400
So in order to explain that,
we have to have this more

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.367
complicated theory.

00:14:52.367 --> 00:14:55.533
Then it's the pressure gradients
which extend down to

00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:58.733
about a kilometer below the
surface that are generating

00:14:58.733 --> 00:15:02.200
these so-called wind
driven currents.

00:15:05.067 --> 00:15:07.533
When I say they're
geostrophically driven, or

00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:11.100
geostrophically balanced, I
mean they have a balance

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.700
between pressure gradient force
and Coriolis force.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.233
Where does wind appear
then in that?

00:15:18.233 --> 00:15:21.067
If it's Coriolis force and
pressure gradient force, does

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:22.400
that mean wind is not active?

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:22.767
No.

00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:25.267
Wind was important
in setting up the

00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:27.167
pressure gradient force.

00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:29.967
So wind is still in there, even
though it doesn't appear

00:15:29.967 --> 00:15:32.100
directly in that
force balance.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.800
Any questions on this current
map of the world?

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:43.900
OK.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.833
Now, we try to estimate how much
water is moving in each

00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:51.367
of these currents.

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:54.100
Now, in some cases,
it's easy to do.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.233
For example, where the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current

00:15:58.233 --> 00:16:01.900
passes through the Drake
Passage, between the Antarctic

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.167
peninsula and the southern tip
of South America, that's a

00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:08.033
well-defined channel,
if you like.

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:11.467
And so, we can measure with
ships and so on, and current

00:16:11.467 --> 00:16:14.000
meters, we can measure
how much water

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.433
flows between there.

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:19.533
And that would be a local
measurement of the Antarctic

00:16:19.533 --> 00:16:20.800
Circumpolar Current.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.767
In other places, for example,
the Gulf Stream, where do you

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:26.967
put the outer edge?

00:16:26.967 --> 00:16:29.033
OK, it does weaken as
you go out, as I'll

00:16:29.033 --> 00:16:30.033
show you in a minute.

00:16:30.033 --> 00:16:34.867
But it's still a little bit
ambiguous about where you mark

00:16:34.867 --> 00:16:37.567
the outer edge of
the Gulf Stream.

00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:42.133
Nonetheless, we have come up
with these estimates for this

00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:45.467
isn't inclusive, but it's a few
examples of estimates of

00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:50.400
how much discharge are in some
of the major ocean currents

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.267
around the world.

00:16:52.267 --> 00:16:56.900
And we're using the unit of
Sverdrup here, which is named

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.133
after a famous oceanographer.

00:16:59.133 --> 00:17:02.267
It's not really an
SI unit, but it's

00:17:02.267 --> 00:17:03.467
closely related to one.

00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:07.467
It's simply one million cubic
meters per second.

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:12.500
So it's a volumetric discharge
rate, just like we've been

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.867
using in rivers.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:18.433
It's a million cubic
meters per second.

00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:23.400
And one way to remember this,
that if you add up all the

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.233
discharge of rivers in the
world, all the freshwater

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:29.433
rivers dumping water into
the ocean, the number is

00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:31.533
approximately one Sverdrup.

00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:35.167
It just turns out, by accident,
to be that way.

00:17:35.167 --> 00:17:36.600
So it's easy to remember.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.067
Summing up the Amazon, the
Mississippi, all the major

00:17:40.067 --> 00:17:42.567
rivers, you get a number
something like this.

00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:45.833
It's a good comparison point
for then looking at the

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.467
discharge in the
ocean currents.

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:51.700
The Florida Current, which is
where the Gulf Stream is

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.167
passing up along the coast
of Florida, it's only 30

00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:57.100
Sverdrups there.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.467
But a few hundred miles north
of there, where it's just

00:18:01.467 --> 00:18:06.333
leaving Cape Hatteras and
heading eastward, If you do a

00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:09.200
north-south section
through it, it's

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.233
grown to 150 Sverdrups.

00:18:11.233 --> 00:18:14.300
One of the strongest currents
in the world.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.667
The Labrador Current, that
cold current coming down

00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:21.700
through the Gulf of Maine and
reaching, in some cases, even

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.300
Massachusetts, has about
eight Sverdrups.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.567
That Antarctic Circumpolar
Current that I mentioned, at

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:29.067
least where it passes
through the Drake

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:32.000
Passage, is 110 Sverdrups.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.667
And the Kuroshio Current
is 50 Sverdrups.

00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:39.800
Somewhere between these two
estimates for the Gulf Stream.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.167
So these are just round numbers,
but they'll give you

00:18:43.167 --> 00:18:46.833
some sense for how much water
is moving around in these

00:18:46.833 --> 00:18:49.767
ocean currents.

00:18:49.767 --> 00:18:53.067
So let's focus on the Atlantic
Ocean for a few minutes.

00:18:53.067 --> 00:18:54.300
It's complicated.

00:18:56.733 --> 00:18:59.933
The Antarctic Circumpolar
Current flows along at the

00:18:59.933 --> 00:19:02.867
southern edge of it.

00:19:02.867 --> 00:19:07.267
Some cold water gets peeled off
and put northwards into

00:19:07.267 --> 00:19:09.500
the Benguela Current.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.667
And we've talked about the role
that this place plays in

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:17.600
keeping the south equatorial
Atlantic rather cool.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.267
Very few hurricanes
form in here.

00:19:19.267 --> 00:19:23.200
And the ITCZ never really shifts
south of the equator in

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.067
this ocean.

00:19:24.067 --> 00:19:27.867
And that's because of the cold
water being brought up by the

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:28.933
Benguela Current.

00:19:28.933 --> 00:19:31.267
There is a South Pacific--sorry
a South

00:19:31.267 --> 00:19:33.167
Atlantic Gyre.

00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:38.167
And it consists of the South
Equatorial Current, the Brazil

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:42.067
Current, the South Atlantic
Current, and then the return

00:19:42.067 --> 00:19:46.367
in the Benguela Current.

00:19:46.367 --> 00:19:47.300
The equatorial region.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.100
The equator is here.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.167
It's a little complicated.

00:19:50.167 --> 00:19:53.067
There are some counter-currents.

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.267
So let's shift up into the
Northern Hemisphere, where

00:19:55.267 --> 00:19:57.300
I'll spend most of
my time here.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.467
And that is, you've got another
gyre, a subtropical

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:04.333
gyre, consisting of
the Gulf Stream.

00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:10.033
Some would call this the Gulf
Stream extension, or the North

00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:11.000
Atlantic Current.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
It returns in the Canary Current
and then the North

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.233
Equatorial Current there.

00:20:15.233 --> 00:20:19.733
Some of this enters into
the Caribbean Sea.

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:24.533
Then between Mexico and
Cuba, it flows up

00:20:24.533 --> 00:20:26.733
into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:20:26.733 --> 00:20:29.900
Then comes out right along
the coast of Florida.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.667
And that's the number I quoted
you for the Florida Current.

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:36.600
But then additional water joins
it, and by the time it

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.867
gets out here, it has more total
transport than it had as

00:20:40.867 --> 00:20:44.067
it moved up along the
coast of Florida.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.567
So that's oh, then you've got
the Labrador Current up here.

00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:54.567
Water coming down out of the
Arctic Ocean moves along the

00:20:54.567 --> 00:20:57.500
east coast of Greenland, back
up along the west coast and

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.800
Baffin Bay, and then becomes
the Labrador Current, then

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.133
comes down here.

00:21:03.133 --> 00:21:04.367
And that's a cold current.

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:10.600
So the Gulf Stream was
discovered, well it was known,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.367
in a way, from the earliest
sailing expeditions across the

00:21:16.367 --> 00:21:17.067
Atlantic Ocean.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:20.533
But actually, it was Ben
Franklin who did the first

00:21:20.533 --> 00:21:22.967
scientific study of it.

00:21:22.967 --> 00:21:24.533
By looking at ship's logs.

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:28.000
He, himself, took that trip a
couple of times when he was

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.700
posted as being ambassador
to the French court.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.533
And he would take observations
as he traveled across.

00:21:34.533 --> 00:21:38.433
And this is his map from
approximately 1769.

00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:41.467
We'll compare that with what
we know today about it.

00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:43.067
But he's got the basic
idea right.

00:21:43.067 --> 00:21:47.500
It comes up along the coast of
Florida to the Cape Hatteras,

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.300
and then seems to leave the
coast and move out towards the

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.933
east. And doesn't come that
close to us here in

00:21:54.933 --> 00:21:58.967
Connecticut, we're
right there.

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:02.467
He doesn't show anything
splitting off to go up north,

00:22:02.467 --> 00:22:05.700
the way the previous
diagram did.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.833
Here's a satellite image.

00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:10.233
One really neat way to look
at this is just to take an

00:22:10.233 --> 00:22:15.233
infrared, a thermal infrared
image of the ocean.

00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:19.833
Play some tricks to get rid of
the clouds, and then interpret

00:22:19.833 --> 00:22:22.933
the intensity of that radiation
as the temperature

00:22:22.933 --> 00:22:23.867
of the emitting object.

00:22:23.867 --> 00:22:27.567
Remember the Stefan-Boltzmann
law the warmer an object is,

00:22:27.567 --> 00:22:28.767
the more it radiates.

00:22:28.767 --> 00:22:30.200
So that's what's done here.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.200
A color code has been applied.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.200
The red is areas that are
emitting strongly in the

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.633
thermal infrared.

00:22:37.633 --> 00:22:40.333
The blue are areas that are
emitting less strongly.

00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:43.433
And then that's directly related
to the temperature of

00:22:43.433 --> 00:22:44.700
the sea surface.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.433
So this is sea surface
temperature.

00:22:47.433 --> 00:22:49.500
Warm water in the tropics.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.400
And then this little
stream of very warm

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.467
water coming up here.

00:22:54.467 --> 00:22:57.333
It's getting mixed in a little
bit, but it continues as a

00:22:57.333 --> 00:23:02.133
warm water current, until
it leaves Cape Hatteras.

00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:05.033
We see it continuing, but as
soon as it leaves, it begins

00:23:05.033 --> 00:23:06.600
to meander.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.333
And you form eddies
on both sides.

00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:14.733
Cold eddies poking through from
west to east. Warm eddies

00:23:14.733 --> 00:23:18.267
from east to west. And
it begins to mix in.

00:23:18.267 --> 00:23:20.733
However, you can still
see remnants of it

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.167
further across the ocean.

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:25.533
And it still has a pretty good
speed there, but it's losing

00:23:25.533 --> 00:23:29.667
some of its thermal
characteristic as it mixes in

00:23:29.667 --> 00:23:31.667
with the environment.

00:23:31.667 --> 00:23:32.533
So that's a good view.

00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:34.833
But remember, this is going
to be changing with time.

00:23:34.833 --> 00:23:40.100
So if you were to take another
image a week or so later if

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.833
you took it just a day
or so later, it would

00:23:41.833 --> 00:23:42.767
look a lot like this.

00:23:42.767 --> 00:23:45.733
But if you took--if you waited
a week and took another image

00:23:45.733 --> 00:23:49.067
of it, those eddies would have
moved around quite a bit, and

00:23:49.067 --> 00:23:50.200
new ones would have formed.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.033
And it would look
quite different.

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:55.800
Here's a zoom in on
another date.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.967
Again, the trick is the same.

00:23:59.967 --> 00:24:02.733
We're looking at sea surface
temperature derived from

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:04.933
emitted long wave radiation.

00:24:04.933 --> 00:24:09.767
And here's Delaware Bay, Long
Island Sound, and there's just

00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:12.300
a little bit of the tip
of Cape Hatteras.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.033
So you see the warm water
coming up here.

00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:17.733
This may be a little bit of the
Labrador Current coming

00:24:17.733 --> 00:24:18.967
down in here.

00:24:18.967 --> 00:24:23.700
And then you've got the
mid-ocean, the Sargasso Sea

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.467
out here in the middle.

00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:36.900
A quote from one of the first
books to lay down a

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.600
description of this, was
a book by Matthew

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.567
Fontaine Maury in 1855.

00:24:41.567 --> 00:24:45.267
Where he was working for the
Navy and he put togehter--

00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:48.133
gathered together information
from ships' logs.

00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:50.167
From all the US Navy ships.

00:24:50.167 --> 00:24:52.267
And wrote this rather remarkable
book called The

00:24:52.267 --> 00:24:55.867
Physical Geography of the Sea.

00:24:55.867 --> 00:24:58.300
And here's a quote
from that book.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.833
"No feature of the Gulf Stream
excites remarks among seamen

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:04.867
more frequently than the
sharpness of its edges,

00:25:04.867 --> 00:25:07.700
particularly along its inner
borders." He's referring to

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.800
this edge here.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.367
When you sail across that, you
really notice that boundary.

00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:18.800
In part, because of
what he says.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.533
The color of the water changes
from the bright indigo of the

00:25:22.533 --> 00:25:25.933
tropical to the dirty green
of the litoral.

00:25:25.933 --> 00:25:32.300
So you're getting this water is
basically a clear tropical

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.933
light blue, but the
water back here is

00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:35.033
rather dirty and green.

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:37.633
And you see that boundary
very, very sharply as

00:25:37.633 --> 00:25:38.833
you sail across it.

00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:40.567
There are other things, though,
that a sailor would

00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:41.600
notice as well.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.967
There tends to be cumulus clouds
often over the warm

00:25:44.967 --> 00:25:48.233
Gulf Stream, but not over
the cold water.

00:25:48.233 --> 00:25:50.700
That's to be expected, because
the warm water would

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.200
destabilize the atmospheric
boundary layer, and cause

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.000
thermal convection.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.133
So when you're approaching that,
you can often see it at

00:25:59.133 --> 00:26:02.400
quite some distance, because
you see cumulus clouds are

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:07.933
building up over the Gulf
Stream Questions?

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.200
Now, what about this Gulf of
Mexico thing that's rather

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.400
interesting.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.133
It's called the Loop Current.

00:26:18.133 --> 00:26:22.467
Remember, so the--as part of
the North Atlantic Gyre,

00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:29.600
you've got water pushing into
the Caribbean Sea, then coming

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.100
up into the Gulf of Mexico in
a well-defined current.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.167
But that current
is not steady.

00:26:36.167 --> 00:26:40.667
It changes from week to week,
and it goes through a cycle.

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:42.233
A rather interesting cycle.

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:46.433
For a few weeks, it'll seem to
turn directly eastward and end

00:26:46.433 --> 00:26:48.867
up in the Florida Current.

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:50.767
Then that loop seems
to elongate.

00:26:53.467 --> 00:27:00.267
Then that will break off, it
will form a clockwise eddy,

00:27:00.267 --> 00:27:01.867
which will then drift off.

00:27:01.867 --> 00:27:04.367
And the shortcut is then
reestablished.

00:27:04.367 --> 00:27:06.033
It's more like this.

00:27:06.033 --> 00:27:08.233
That eddy will eventually drift
into the western part of

00:27:08.233 --> 00:27:12.633
the Gulf of Mexico, and the
cycle will then continue.

00:27:12.633 --> 00:27:16.467
So it's an unsteady current
going through this cyclic

00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:22.700
behavior of taking a shortcut,
extending in a long path, and

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.567
then breaking off
into a new eddy.

00:27:25.567 --> 00:27:27.533
And you can see that in
satellite images.

00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:30.000
And here's a sequence
of satellite images.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.200
And the dates are given here.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.900
They're from 1998.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.167
But there's the loop.

00:27:37.567 --> 00:27:41.333
And then as it drifts westward,
it weakens.

00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:46.433
The new direct link is
established there to get water

00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:49.300
into the Florida current.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.333
So depending when you're down
there, you're going to find

00:27:51.333 --> 00:27:54.833
either a lot of warm water here
or not, depending where

00:27:54.833 --> 00:28:00.767
you are in the phase of this
cyclic alteration.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.100
OK.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.733
Well, I'm not going to go into
the Pacific Ocean currents

00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:12.033
nearly as deeply.

00:28:12.033 --> 00:28:13.967
If you want to take a course
in this, you could take a

00:28:13.967 --> 00:28:16.833
course in physical oceanography
and learn about

00:28:16.833 --> 00:28:20.900
each of these ocean basins
in a more complete way.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.800
But I will say that

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.900
they--there are certain parallels.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.767
You've got a North Pacific
Gyre, just like you had a

00:28:27.767 --> 00:28:29.633
North Atlantic Gyre.

00:28:29.633 --> 00:28:34.667
A South Pacific Gyre, just as
you had a South Atlanta Gyre.

00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:37.567
Here, the current is the Peru
Current, sometimes called the

00:28:37.567 --> 00:28:39.867
Humboldt Current.

00:28:39.867 --> 00:28:42.467
And then the South Equatorial
Current, the East Australian

00:28:42.467 --> 00:28:46.800
Current, and then
it returns here.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.467
The one surprise, perhaps,
is this Alaska Current.

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:55.200
So you get the current coming
across here from the Kuroshio

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.500
that then splits.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.367
Some of it comes down the
California coast, and some of

00:29:00.367 --> 00:29:03.467
it returns in the other
direction, back across the

00:29:03.467 --> 00:29:07.633
northern stretches of the
Pacific, and returns into the

00:29:07.633 --> 00:29:08.867
Kuroshio that way.

00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:18.533
The South--the Southern Ocean
has its own current system,

00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:21.133
that's the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current, sometimes

00:29:21.133 --> 00:29:23.033
called the west wind drift.

00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:26.600
It pretty much goes all the
way around Antarctica.

00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:37.433
And in the Arctic Ocean, you've
got a well-defined

00:29:37.433 --> 00:29:40.233
gyre, called the
Beaufort Gyre.

00:29:40.233 --> 00:29:43.867
And then, as part of that, or
consistent with that, is a

00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:47.367
current that runs kind of across
the basin, from one

00:29:47.367 --> 00:29:49.900
side to the other, called
the Transpolar Drift.

00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:54.933
Now, there is water leaking
in and leaking out

00:29:54.933 --> 00:29:56.267
of the Arctic Ocean.

00:29:56.267 --> 00:29:59.633
I've already mentioned that the
Gulf Stream extension will

00:29:59.633 --> 00:30:02.100
come up here.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.567
And water then will enter the
ocean--the Arctic Ocean, stay

00:30:05.567 --> 00:30:07.733
there for several years,
presumably.

00:30:07.733 --> 00:30:10.867
And then some of it will leak
out on the East Greenland

00:30:10.867 --> 00:30:12.433
Current and come out that way.

00:30:12.433 --> 00:30:15.833
There's also some exchange
between Alaska

00:30:15.833 --> 00:30:17.733
and the Soviet Union.

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:20.700
There's some exchange of
water there as well.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.700
Between the Pacific Ocean
and the Arctic Ocean.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.433
One the interesting stories
about this Transpolar Drift is

00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:31.867
the trick that Fridtjof
Nansen tried.

00:30:31.867 --> 00:30:34.167
Now, you already know that name,
because he invented the

00:30:34.167 --> 00:30:34.933
Nansen bottle.

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.567
But this was really
his claim to fame.

00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:41.433
He wanted to be the first one
to reach the North Pole.

00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:43.867
And he figured, why should
he have to work at it?

00:30:43.867 --> 00:30:47.767
Why shouldn't he let nature
do the work for him?

00:30:47.767 --> 00:30:49.267
He already had some
evidence that

00:30:49.267 --> 00:30:52.233
Transpolar Current existed.

00:30:52.233 --> 00:30:56.567
So he said, if I can just get
my ship locked into the ice

00:30:56.567 --> 00:31:03.567
about here, it should carry me
close to the Arctic, to the

00:31:03.567 --> 00:31:04.333
North Pole.

00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:06.167
And he did that.

00:31:06.167 --> 00:31:09.400
He left the ship here and tried
to do the rest of it by

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.000
land not by land, but
over the ice.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.567
Couldn't make it, and ended up
having to travel on the ice

00:31:14.567 --> 00:31:17.367
all the way back to here, where
he finally got back to

00:31:17.367 --> 00:31:18.267
civilization.

00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:20.900
While the ship continued
to move like this.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.633
So it was a good idea, but it
didn't quite get him close

00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:28.033
enough to allow him to reach
the North Pole in that way.

00:31:28.033 --> 00:31:29.367
But it's a great
adventure book.

00:31:29.367 --> 00:31:32.000
If you want to read about one of
the great adventure stories

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.467
in human history, read about
Nansen's attempt to get to the

00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:38.533
North Pole using that
Tranpolar Drift.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.333
Questions here?

00:31:44.333 --> 00:31:45.967
OK.

00:31:45.967 --> 00:31:49.133
Switching gears slightly,
we're interested in the

00:31:49.133 --> 00:31:53.133
relationship between physical
oceanography, that we've been

00:31:53.133 --> 00:31:57.433
talking about so far, and
biological oceanography.

00:31:57.433 --> 00:32:01.467
In particular, what is it that
controls productivity in the

00:32:01.467 --> 00:32:02.200
world ocean?

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.867
By this I mean biological
productivity.

00:32:06.867 --> 00:32:09.433
Now the way a biologist
approaches this, is first

00:32:09.433 --> 00:32:11.333
understand the food chain.

00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:14.300
What feeds on what?

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.700
And I'll show you that
in just a minute.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.967
But the most basic level, where
the food chain begins,

00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:23.867
is called primary
productivity.

00:32:23.867 --> 00:32:27.200
And it's usually referring to
plant life in the ocean.

00:32:30.033 --> 00:32:33.500
Plant life requires sunlight
and nutrients.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.667
You need to get those two things
together in order to

00:32:36.667 --> 00:32:38.833
get the primary productivity.

00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:43.300
And then the rest of the food
chain builds on that.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.400
And as I'll be showing you,
there are vast parts of the

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.933
ocean that are devoid of any
primary productivity.

00:32:51.933 --> 00:32:54.933
And for that reason, largely
devoid of any biological

00:32:54.933 --> 00:32:57.100
activity at all.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.333
But there are other regions in
which biological activity is

00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:03.033
very, very active.

00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:06.567
And if I had to categorize them,
and I'm going to try to

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:09.367
categorize them, I would put
them into those four

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:10.433
categories.

00:33:10.433 --> 00:33:12.500
There's a lot of primary
productivity in high

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:18.333
latitudes, in regions of coastal
upwelling, in regions

00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:22.500
of equatorial upwelling, and in
regions of river outflow.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.900
And for the most part, the
rest of the ocean is very

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.567
limited, if not completely
devoid of primary

00:33:29.567 --> 00:33:31.167
productivity.

00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:33.467
So in the next few minutes,
we're going to talk about this

00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:39.533
kind of way of understanding
productivity in the oceans.

00:33:39.533 --> 00:33:42.100
So here's the typical
food chain.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.333
You start with single-celled
life that are plants.

00:33:47.333 --> 00:33:51.100
And they require sunlight and
nutrients, especially

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.833
phosphorus and nitrogen.

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.467
It's a carbon-based life,
which there's

00:33:57.467 --> 00:33:59.400
plenty of carbon available.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:06.267
So it usually depends on the
phosphorus and the nitrogen

00:34:06.267 --> 00:34:09.733
that allows that
to get started.

00:34:09.733 --> 00:34:16.567
These organisms get eaten by
small animals, so-called

00:34:16.567 --> 00:34:18.500
zooplankton.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.533
These are so-called
phytoplankton.

00:34:21.533 --> 00:34:23.300
They get eaten by zooplankton.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.900
And then, in turn, eaten by
small fish, larger fish,

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.000
larger fish, and so on.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.667
So that's the base of
the food chain.

00:34:30.667 --> 00:34:33.067
That's the primary productivity
there.

00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:41.500
Now, here's the great catch
22 for ocean productivity.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.033
You need light from the sun.

00:34:45.033 --> 00:34:47.367
But light is absorbed rather
quickly as you go

00:34:47.367 --> 00:34:49.400
down into the ocean.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.967
The region that has lots of
light in the ocean, the upper

00:34:52.967 --> 00:34:58.533
50 or 100 meters is referred
to as the euphotic zone.

00:34:58.533 --> 00:35:03.367
E-U-P-H-O-T-I-C. The
euphotic zone.

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:04.667
There's a layer beneath
that that gets a

00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:05.367
little bit of light.

00:35:05.367 --> 00:35:09.333
And then, however, most, the
vast majority of the ocean

00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:11.567
depth is dark.

00:35:11.567 --> 00:35:13.733
Because the sunlight doesn't
penetrate that far.

00:35:13.733 --> 00:35:15.500
That's the aphotic zone.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.700
Aphotic meaning no light.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.800
On the other hand, if you look
at the concentration of

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.700
nutrients in the ocean and
here, it's plotted versus

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.900
depth in kilometers.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.700
Sea surface, one kilometer,
two kilometers.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.333
Most of the nutrients,
phosphorus and nitrogen, are

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:41.200
in the lower parts
of the ocean.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.300
And in the upper parts of the
ocean, where you have the

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.767
light, you have depleted
nutrients.

00:35:47.767 --> 00:35:49.200
So here's that catch 22.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.333
Where you've got light, you
don't have the nutrients.

00:35:51.333 --> 00:35:54.333
Where you've got nutrients,
you don't have the light.

00:35:54.333 --> 00:35:59.100
That's the great brake upon
ocean productivity.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.433
To get ocean productivity,
you've got to violate this

00:36:02.433 --> 00:36:07.200
general anti-correlation, and
get the two together.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.667
You can't get the sunlight
deeper, so the only way to do

00:36:10.667 --> 00:36:14.600
that is to get some of these
nutrients up to the surface.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.100
And that'll be the focus of
our discussion for primary

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:17.933
productivity.

00:36:17.933 --> 00:36:20.300
How can we get some of these
nutrients up to the surface?

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.500
Now, why is it like this?

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.900
Well, it's because you've had
some blooms of phytoplankton.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.067
They've depleted
the nutrients.

00:36:29.067 --> 00:36:32.767
And then their bodies will fall
gravitationally into the

00:36:32.767 --> 00:36:35.333
lower ocean, and then rot.

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:38.233
And the nutrients are released
again, but because of gravity,

00:36:38.233 --> 00:36:41.333
they're released in the lower
parts of the ocean.

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:43.933
And once that has happened, then
you have that depletion.

00:36:43.933 --> 00:36:48.100
And the, at least in this
simple set of plots, the

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.033
productivity would shut down.

00:36:50.033 --> 00:36:54.700
You need to do something to
reestablish concentrations of

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.800
nutrients in the surface waters
of the ocean in order

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.533
to get the primary productivity
reestablished.

00:37:02.533 --> 00:37:06.567
This is one of my favorite
diagrams. It comes from a

00:37:06.567 --> 00:37:10.267
satellite in orbit called
SeaWiFS, which looks down at

00:37:10.267 --> 00:37:11.500
the surface of the ocean.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.100
And by using two channels, two
reflected channels, it maps

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.967
out the concentration of
chlorophyll chlorophyll a in

00:37:18.967 --> 00:37:22.867
this case in the surface
waters of the ocean.

00:37:22.867 --> 00:37:26.567
So in a way, it's detecting
those phytoplankton directly,

00:37:26.567 --> 00:37:29.200
because they have chlorophyll
in their bodies.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.067
And so, here we have a global
map of the primary

00:37:34.067 --> 00:37:35.433
productivity in the ocean.

00:37:35.433 --> 00:37:37.767
It's a remarkable thing.

00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:41.200
And the scale here, it's a
log scale, the units are

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.500
milligrams of chlorophyll per
cubic meter of ocean water.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.267
Going from 60 units on down
to 0.01 on a log scale.

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:54.833
So the purple areas are
biological deserts.

00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:58.033
There's really very little
primary productivity going on

00:37:58.033 --> 00:38:00.533
in these areas.

00:38:00.533 --> 00:38:02.967
We can imagine why that is,
because remember, that warm

00:38:02.967 --> 00:38:07.500
water lens extends from
there to there.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.900
And so, you've got this layer of
warm water floating on the

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:17.100
sea, very strong thermocline
beneath it, which, just like

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.533
an inversion in the atmosphere,
makes it very

00:38:19.533 --> 00:38:23.467
difficult to mix water
vertically.

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:25.967
So while you probably have a
lot of nutrients just a few

00:38:25.967 --> 00:38:30.433
hundred meters down, because
of that static stability in

00:38:30.433 --> 00:38:32.933
the thermocline, you can't
mix it to the surface.

00:38:37.667 --> 00:38:39.533
So let's talk about the
high latitudes.

00:38:39.533 --> 00:38:43.300
I'll go through and check off
the four items I had there.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.267
High latitudes are generally
high productivity.

00:38:48.267 --> 00:38:54.500
Well, that's because that warm
water lens doesn't extend to

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.200
high latitudes.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.167
You've got cold water
at the surface.

00:38:59.167 --> 00:39:01.800
You've got cold water
at depth.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.900
You don't have a strong

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.367
thermocline in the high latitudes.

00:39:06.367 --> 00:39:10.000
You do have, also, strong storms
in the atmosphere,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.767
putting winds on the surface
of the ocean,

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.467
tending to mix things.

00:39:14.467 --> 00:39:18.567
So it's pretty easy to get water
to mix up and down when

00:39:18.567 --> 00:39:20.367
you're in the high latitudes.

00:39:20.367 --> 00:39:24.867
And that's why a lot of the
major world fisheries are

00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:27.900
found in high latitudes, because
you can get primary

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.700
productivity, because you can
mix up the nutrient-rich

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.733
waters into the euphotic
zone and get those

00:39:34.733 --> 00:39:38.167
phytoplankton growing.

00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:42.267
A second example would be let's
see, go back to the

00:39:42.267 --> 00:39:44.400
order that I had them here.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.833
Coastal upwelling.

00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:49.467
There's a lot of upwelling,
a lot of productivity, for

00:39:49.467 --> 00:39:55.967
example, along the Peru coast.
And that, we believe, is due

00:39:55.967 --> 00:39:56.967
to coastal upwelling.

00:39:56.967 --> 00:40:01.000
Basically, you have winds
putting a wind

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.267
stress on the ocean.

00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:05.733
And the Ekman drift that
responds from that is pushing

00:40:05.733 --> 00:40:07.967
water offshore.

00:40:07.967 --> 00:40:12.067
So if you're pushing surface
waters away from the shore,

00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:14.867
then that must be replaced
by waters

00:40:14.867 --> 00:40:17.633
coming up from the deep.

00:40:17.633 --> 00:40:20.500
So any time you're for example,
if the wind was like

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.367
this, the Ekman drift would be
perpendicular to that, pushing

00:40:25.367 --> 00:40:29.900
water offshore and allowing
nutrient-rich deep waters to

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.867
come up to the surface, giving
you high productivity along

00:40:33.867 --> 00:40:34.667
that coastline.

00:40:34.667 --> 00:40:36.500
And you find at other
places as well.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.333
Coastlines tend to be highly
productive because of the

00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:42.100
upwelling and the mixing
that can occur there.

00:40:45.233 --> 00:40:46.467
Equatorial upwelling.

00:40:48.967 --> 00:40:52.833
I think this is the most
remarkable aspect of this

00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:56.233
diagram, is this little line.

00:40:56.233 --> 00:40:58.333
And some other productive
areas around it, but

00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:02.333
especially that little
line right at the

00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:04.767
geographical equator.

00:41:04.767 --> 00:41:07.600
That's not at the ITCZ.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.467
That's not approximately
at the equator.

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:13.967
That is at zero degrees
latitude.

00:41:13.967 --> 00:41:16.367
There's a highly productive
region right at

00:41:16.367 --> 00:41:18.567
zero degrees latitude.

00:41:18.567 --> 00:41:21.067
And why would that be?

00:41:21.067 --> 00:41:24.033
Why would there be a highly
productive region right at

00:41:24.033 --> 00:41:28.333
zero degrees latitude?

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:29.867
Yeah.

00:41:29.867 --> 00:41:30.267
STUDENT: A lot of sunlight?

00:41:30.267 --> 00:41:31.167
PROFESSOR: A lot of sunlight.

00:41:31.167 --> 00:41:34.200
But you know, the sun remember,
because of the tilt

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.367
of the earth, there are seasons
of the year when you

00:41:36.367 --> 00:41:38.867
get more sunlight
here than there.

00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:40.667
And more sunlight here
than there, in

00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:43.300
Southern Hemisphere summer.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.567
And really, that begs
the question

00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:46.033
of why it's so narrow.

00:41:46.033 --> 00:41:50.233
Really, why is it right
at the, right at the

00:41:50.233 --> 00:41:51.500
geographical equator?

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.367
What happens, what's
special about the

00:41:55.367 --> 00:41:56.967
geographical equator?

00:41:56.967 --> 00:41:59.200
STUDENT: There's no
Coriolis Force?

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.567
PROFESSOR: No Coriolis force.

00:42:01.567 --> 00:42:06.133
And along with that, it's
where the Coriolis force

00:42:06.133 --> 00:42:11.200
switches sign, from being to
the right, to the left.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.033
That's what's unique
about the equator.

00:42:14.033 --> 00:42:16.267
And I think I have a
diagram for that.

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.367
In fact, I have two diagrams.
So, for coastal upwelling, if

00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:22.333
that's the continent and the
wind is like this, it pushes

00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:26.533
the Ekman drift offshore, it
must be replaced by upwelling.

00:42:26.533 --> 00:42:30.067
Here's the diagram for the
equatorial upwelling.

00:42:30.067 --> 00:42:32.067
Let's say the ITCZ is
located somewhere

00:42:32.067 --> 00:42:34.367
north of the equator.

00:42:34.367 --> 00:42:38.233
So the winds crossing the
equator are the southeast

00:42:38.233 --> 00:42:40.167
trade winds.

00:42:40.167 --> 00:42:44.100
The southeast trade winds.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.600
So the wind stress is along
the blue arrow.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.900
When you're in the Southern
Hemisphere, the Ekman drift is

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.933
to the left of the
wind stress.

00:42:53.933 --> 00:42:56.567
When you're in the Northern
Hemisphere, the Ekman drift is

00:42:56.567 --> 00:42:59.000
to the right of the
wind stress.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.067
So now, draw a section
like this.

00:43:02.067 --> 00:43:04.800
That is pulling water
northwards

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.033
away from the equator.

00:43:07.033 --> 00:43:09.467
This is pulling water
southwards

00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:11.133
away from the equator.

00:43:11.133 --> 00:43:15.967
That water must then be
replaced by upwelling.

00:43:15.967 --> 00:43:18.167
So imagine you're in a bathtub,
you put your hands

00:43:18.167 --> 00:43:20.633
like this, you push
water away.

00:43:20.633 --> 00:43:24.133
Well, that water's going to
be replaced from beneath.

00:43:24.133 --> 00:43:28.300
And that's what's happening
right along the equator to

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.833
give equatorial upwelling.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.933
Any questions on that
general point?

00:43:36.933 --> 00:43:38.100
Did I cover them all,
by the way?

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.667
Let's see here.

00:43:39.667 --> 00:43:40.467
River outflow.

00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:46.300
Well, if you look at, for
example, where the Amazon

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.100
River comes in, where the
Mississippi comes in, where

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.200
some of the other major
rivers come in, you

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.033
see little red regions.

00:43:54.033 --> 00:43:57.767
That's because nutrients are
brought in from the land.

00:43:57.767 --> 00:44:01.867
The rain has fallen on the land,
moved through the soil,

00:44:01.867 --> 00:44:03.833
picked up nutrients.

00:44:03.833 --> 00:44:07.367
And then, where that passes
out into the ocean, you've

00:44:07.367 --> 00:44:10.967
brought nutrients into the
euphotic zone in that way.

00:44:10.967 --> 00:44:12.867
So that pretty much covers it.

00:44:12.867 --> 00:44:16.567
Why you have high productivity
regions in some areas, and low

00:44:16.567 --> 00:44:19.167
productivity regions
in other areas.

00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:22.633
Any questions on this?

00:44:22.633 --> 00:44:26.433
This, of course, controls where
are the major fisheries.

00:44:26.433 --> 00:44:29.867
Now, it's a little sad to notice
that we pretty much

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:33.833
exploited the world's
ocean productivity.

00:44:33.833 --> 00:44:40.833
In the blue is the total marine
fish catch from 1950,

00:44:40.833 --> 00:44:45.333
in units of millions
of metric tons.

00:44:45.333 --> 00:44:47.467
And it's been increasing
from the 1950s.

00:44:47.467 --> 00:44:52.433
But then, about 1990 onwards,
it's pretty much plateaued.

00:44:52.433 --> 00:44:58.033
In other words, we're taking
about as much edible biomass

00:44:58.033 --> 00:45:01.233
out of the oceans as the
oceans can produce.

00:45:01.233 --> 00:45:04.967
So the human population has
grown to the state that it's

00:45:04.967 --> 00:45:09.333
pretty much fully utilizing
everything that the ocean is

00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:12.833
producing in these high
productivity zones.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.433
I wanted to just link this
curious pattern of

00:45:19.433 --> 00:45:23.433
productivity to one famous book,
and that's Moby Dick.

00:45:23.433 --> 00:45:25.333
You probably have
all read that.

00:45:25.333 --> 00:45:32.433
And Captain Ahab was hunting
for a sperm whale.

00:45:32.433 --> 00:45:36.133
Sperm whales are found in
all oceans of the world.

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:40.333
But occasionally, the males
will go down and join the

00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:43.067
females on the breeding grounds
close to the equator.

00:45:43.067 --> 00:45:44.967
And when you read that book, you
may have wondered, what's

00:45:44.967 --> 00:45:46.333
special about the equator?

00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:47.767
Well, now you know.

00:45:47.767 --> 00:45:52.333
It's this equatorial upwelling
that gives rise to a high

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:57.533
productivity region right on
the geographical equator.

00:45:57.533 --> 00:46:06.967
And then if you read a quote
from the book, "You meet them

00:46:06.967 --> 00:46:09.100
on the line." Right?

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.233
By "on the line," Herman
Melville was

00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:15.667
referring to the equator.

00:46:15.667 --> 00:46:17.600
"Just having returned, perhaps,
from spending the

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.267
summer in the northern seas,
cheating summer of all its

00:46:21.267 --> 00:46:23.467
unpleasant weariness
and warmth.

00:46:23.467 --> 00:46:25.100
By the time the have lounged
up and down the

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:25.967
promenade..." OK.

00:46:25.967 --> 00:46:28.400
I won't go through this in
detail, but the point is, that

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.433
it was known by the whalers
also that you had highly

00:46:33.433 --> 00:46:36.100
productive regions in
the high latitudes.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.467
But also, an additional high
productive region right along

00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:42.500
the equator.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.033
They didn't know it was because
of a shift in the

00:46:44.033 --> 00:46:48.267
Ekman layer, but we know that
now, that you have a zone

00:46:48.267 --> 00:46:52.267
there of high productivity.

00:46:52.267 --> 00:46:53.533
Questions on that?

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:56.667
OK.

00:46:56.667 --> 00:47:04.233
Well, we finished up the basic
section on oceanography.

00:47:04.233 --> 00:47:07.900
Next, on Wednesday, I'm going
to be talking about El Nino,

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.033
which you can read about
in the book.

00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:13.800
And we'll talk about this
particular interaction between

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.500
the atmosphere and the ocean.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.074
Prof: So,
what I want to do today--again,

00:00:03.074 --> 00:00:04.620
this is a parallel holding
pattern lecture.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.420
I'm going to talk about
absolute rule.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.200
This parallels what you're
reading.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.610
It's just to make clear,
with some emphasis,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.290
about the importance of the
development of absolute rule.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.130
Now, one of the points I made
last week,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.115
for those of you who were here,
is that one of the themes that

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:27.704
ties European history together
is the growth of the modern

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.110
state,
of state-making.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.546
This tends to be an awkward
expression or term that is used

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:35.770
by historians.
 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.210
If you look at the way states
are in Europe now,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.090
whether they be relatively
decentralized,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.120
such as Great Britain,
or extraordinarily centralized,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.645
as my France,
the origins of the modern state

00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:56.242
must, in part,
be seen in this kind of

00:00:56.242 --> 00:01:00.548
remarkable period of European
history from the early

00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:05.191
seventeenth century through the
middle of the eighteenth

00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.290
century.
 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.317
Now, we have a process in late
Medieval Europe of the

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:15.379
consolidation of territorial
monarchies.

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:17.456
You did have monarchies like
Spain, England,

00:01:17.456 --> 00:01:18.470
and France, namely.
 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.379
Those were the three most
important ones,

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:28.342
in which rulers consolidated to
brush claimants to power aside

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:31.470
and consolidated their rule.
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.346
But the period of absolute rule
really begins in the

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:41.646
mid-seventeenth century,
and is to be found in those

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:46.980
states that had specific kinds
of social structures.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.760
This is a point we'll come back
to,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.316
particularly when we're talking
about the two most important

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:53.947
states,
two of the great powers of the

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.879
period that did not have
absolute rule.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:00.328
And which, in the case of
England,

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:02.590
the civil war was largely
fought,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.075
to a great extent anyway,
trying to prevent the English

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:10.908
monarchy from taking on
characteristics of those

00:02:10.908 --> 00:02:14.580
emerging absolute states on the
continent.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.919
I'll talk next Wednesday about
English/British,

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.860
because Britain doesn't exist
until 1707,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.381
self-identity and how not being
an absolute state is part of

00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:29.750
what emerged in the sense of
being British and being Dutch

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.639
certainly,
arguably even more,

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:37.860
had to do with that because of
the proximity of the direct

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.800
threat to the Dutch by the
megalomaniac,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.460
Louis XIV, who modestly refers
to himself as the Sun King.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.066
So, between 1650 and 1750,
and this is right out of what

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.657
you're reading,
the rulers of continental

00:02:57.657 --> 00:02:59.300
Europe,
of the biggest states,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.628
extended their power.
 

00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:04.128
And, so, there were two aspects
of this.

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:08.596
One is they extend their
ability to extract resources out

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:12.068
of their own populations;
and, second,

00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:18.560
they work to increase their
dynastic holdings at the expense

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.729
of their neighbors munching
smaller states,

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:29.508
or by marriages,
or by wars against their big

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:30.370
rivals.
 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.689
One of the most interesting
examples of that is the Thirty

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.943
Years' War,
which starts before this course

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.985
and ends before this course or
with the beginning of this

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.495
course, 1618-1648,
which I'm going to come back to

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:45.455
a little bit in a while--they
say while it begins as a

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:49.340
religious war between
Protestants and Catholics,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.461
it ends up being a dynastic
struggle between two Catholic

00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:57.143
powers consolidating their
authority over their own

00:03:57.143 --> 00:03:59.896
peoples,
and expanding their dynastic

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:04.378
domains,
thus Austria and France.

00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:07.781
That's an important point,
because it tells you what

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:11.250
really is the big picture that
is going to emerge.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.407
So, when we're talking about
the growth of absolute rule,

00:04:14.407 --> 00:04:17.339
we're talking about France,
that is, the Sun King;

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.379
Prussia, particularly Frederick
the Great about whom you can

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.517
read;
Russia, Peter the Great,

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:27.043
about whom I will have
something to say in a week or

00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:30.819
two, I don't know when;
Austria, aforementioned;

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.670
and Sweden.
 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.430
Sweden kind of disappears from
the great power state when

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.529
they're defeated by Peter the
Great in--when is it?--1709.

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:44.720
Now, what did it mean to be an
absolute ruler?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.550
What it meant was that in
principle,

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.605
your power was greater than any
challenge that could come from

00:04:55.605 --> 00:05:00.052
those underlings,
those craven reptiles in your

00:05:00.052 --> 00:05:02.480
imagination over whom you ruled.
 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.329
But there's a balance to it
that I'll discuss in a while.

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:13.894
There really can't be a
challenge to them from the state

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:14.970
itself.
 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.194
So, they make their personal or
dynastic rule absolute,

00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:25.903
based on loyalty to them as
individuals and not to the state

00:05:25.903 --> 00:05:29.000
as some sort of abstraction.
 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.064
Of course, one of the
interesting things that we'll

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:35.740
hear about in a couple days is
the fact that British national

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.545
identity,
which is formed precociously

00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:42.860
early in European history,
arguably in the seventeenth

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.810
century and for elites perhaps
even before,

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.196
has this sort of constitutional
balance between the rights of

00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:54.673
parliament,
victorious in the English Civil

00:05:54.673 --> 00:05:59.819
War,
and loyalty to the monarchy.

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:07.170
So, absolute rulers assert
their right to make laws,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.771
to proclaim or to announce laws
with the waive of their chubby

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:16.149
hands,
to levy taxes and to appoint

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:21.569
officials who will carry out
their will.

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.326
So, it's possible to talk about
the bureaucratization of

00:06:24.326 --> 00:06:27.632
medieval states if you want,
but when you look at the

00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:30.843
long-range growth of
bureaucracies as part of

00:06:30.843 --> 00:06:33.399
government,
as part of state formation,

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:38.166
that's why the growth of these
bureaucracies is one of the

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:42.766
characteristics of these
absolute states in all of these

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:44.440
big-time powers.
 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.879
So, what they do is--well,
let me give you a couple of

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.009
examples.
 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.026
One thing absolute monarchs
don't want is they don't want

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:56.019
impediments to their personal
rule.

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:59.019
What was a kind of impediment
to their personal rule?

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:02.338
One would be the municipal
privileges.

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:04.629
For example,
in the German port towns,

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:08.149
Lübeck and Hamburg and the
others,

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.000
they formed this Hanseatic
League,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.379
and Germany remains to be
centralized.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:14.639
There are all sorts of states.
 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.970
Some are more powerful than
others.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.529
But Germany is not unified
until 1871.

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:23.653
But if you think of Spain,
if youâ€˜re hitchhiking

00:07:23.653 --> 00:07:25.060
through Spain or something like
that,

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.629
or through the south of France,
or Eurail passes,

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:31.089
and if you go to a town like
Avila in Spain.

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:36.511
Avila is one of the most
fantastic fortified towns in

00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:37.449
Europe.
 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:39.526
Or, if you go to Nimes in the
south of France,

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:42.113
you'll see boulevards that
people race motorcycles around

00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:44.329
all the time and they keep you
up all night.

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:47.401
There are no walls there
anymore, because the king had

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:48.560
them knocked down.
 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.879
So, what happens with municipal
privileges,

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.050
towns that had municipal
privileges,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.464
these are eroded and then
virtually eliminated by powerful

00:07:58.464 --> 00:07:59.699
potentates.
 

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:02.819
In the case of Nîmes,
N-I-M-E-S,

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:04.588
which was largely a Protestant
town,

00:08:04.588 --> 00:08:07.807
they knocked down the wall so
the Protestants of Nimes could

00:08:07.807 --> 00:08:10.915
not defend themselves against
this all-conquering Catholic

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:11.569
monarch.
 

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:14.620
So, municipal privileges--walls
were put up for a variety of

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.810
reasons around towns.
 

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.730
Plague, for example.
 

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.149
Dubrovnik, one of my favorite
cities in Europe.

00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:23.089
Dubrovnik had these magnificent
walls you could walk all the way

00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.509
around.
 

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:26.439
They have a quarantine house
where they would put people who

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.620
were travelers arriving there,
because walls kept out plagues.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.220
Walls keep out
malfaiteurs--;evil doers.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.220
They keep out bandits and
things like that.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.009
The doors literally slam shut
at night.

00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:45.708
There was a case of a very
minor insurrection in an obscure

00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:50.408
Italian city in 1848 where the
people of the town literally

00:08:50.408 --> 00:08:54.458
locked the ruler out of the
town--and Italy remains

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:56.080
decentralized.
 

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.749
The tradition of these
decentralized city-states that

00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:02.288
were the heart of the
Renaissance.

00:09:02.288 --> 00:09:06.230
Italy is not unified--to the
extent it has ever been

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.090
unified--until the 1860s and
1970s.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:16.173
What these kings do,
these kings and queens is they

00:09:16.173 --> 00:09:23.259
get rid of these impediments to
their authority.

00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:27.379
Even take the word burgher
or bourgeois.

00:09:27.379 --> 00:09:28.950
Bourgeois is a French word.
 

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.970
It's more of a cultural sense,
but it also has a class sense.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:37.596
A bourgeois or a burgher was
somebody who lived in a city and

00:09:37.596 --> 00:09:43.410
assumed that some of the justice
that was levied against him or

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.570
her would be the result of
decisions taken locally.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.783
Now, big-time,
powerful absolute monarchs

00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:53.230
don't want that.
 

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:58.839
So, part of the whole process
is the elimination of these

00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:04.649
municipal privileges and
replacing municipal officials,

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:09.198
to make a long story short,
with people that they have

00:10:09.198 --> 00:10:10.350
appointed.
 

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.110
They eliminate--the one
privilege above all that the big

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.870
guys want to get rid of is the
right to not be taxed.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:23.658
Part of being an absolute ruler
is being able to levy taxes

00:10:23.658 --> 00:10:28.748
against those people who have
the joy or the extreme

00:10:28.748 --> 00:10:33.039
misfortune of living in those
domains,

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:35.808
and more about that later.
 

00:10:35.808 --> 00:10:40.559
So, what happens with all this
is that absolute rule impinges

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:44.438
directly on the lives of
ordinary people more than

00:10:44.438 --> 00:10:47.629
kingly,
or queenly, or princely,

00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:52.205
or archbishiply power had
intruded on the lives of

00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:55.100
ordinary people before that.
 

00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:00.379
So, these rulers have a
coercive ability in creating,

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:03.667
and I'll come back to this,
large standing armies that will

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:07.277
be arriving not immediately,
they're not arriving by train

00:11:07.277 --> 00:11:09.700
or being helicoptered in at some
distant command,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.230
but they will get there if
there's trouble.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.597
They will arrive and they will
get there and they will enforce

00:11:16.597 --> 00:11:18.460
the will of the monarch.
 

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.364
We'll see the statistics are
really just fascinating about

00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:24.418
how big these armies become.
 

00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:27.960
The argument that I'm going to
make,

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.456
drawing upon again Rabb--he's
not the only one that's made

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:34.461
this argument,
but he's made it more

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:39.134
thoroughly than most
people--absolutism may be seen

00:11:39.134 --> 00:11:44.366
as an attempt to reassert public
order and coercive state

00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:49.039
authority after this period of
utter turmoil.

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:52.529
The English Civil War,
the Thirty Years' War,

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:56.471
in which in parts of central
Europe a quarter of the

00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:59.418
population disappeared,
were killed,

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:02.335
murdered in ways that I will
unfortunately show you in a

00:12:02.335 --> 00:12:02.759
while.
 

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:10.537
More than this,
what happens is that the

00:12:10.537 --> 00:12:13.979
nobles,
who in all these countries

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:16.288
going back to the Medieval
period,

00:12:16.288 --> 00:12:19.990
had privileges that they were
asserting vis-à-vis their

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.470
monarchs,
they will say,

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.980
"We agree to be junior
partners in absolutism in

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.220
exchange for the protection that
you,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.879
the big guy,
and your armies can provide us,

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:42.985
so that we don't have to lie
awake wondering who is coming up

00:12:42.985 --> 00:12:45.370
the path to the big house.
 

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:50.678
Is it peasants who are come and
assert the rights of the poor

00:12:50.678 --> 00:12:52.360
against us?"
 

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:58.596
And at a time of popular
insurrections in all sorts of

00:12:58.596 --> 00:13:00.009
countries.
 

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:02.695
Think of all the insurrections
or all the people who followed

00:13:02.695 --> 00:13:04.620
false czars to utter slaughter
in Russia.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.259
The nobles say, "All right.
 

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:13.038
We agree to be junior partners
in absolute rule in exchange for

00:13:13.038 --> 00:13:17.979
recognizing your supreme
authority over us in exchange

00:13:17.979 --> 00:13:22.919
for the protection that you will
afford us."

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:25.960
Private armies are disappearing.
 

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.128
The armies of the state,
as you will see in a while,

00:13:30.128 --> 00:13:32.172
are growing,
and moreover,

00:13:32.172 --> 00:13:35.850
"you, oh big guy,
you will assert our own

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.240
privileges.
 

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.000
You will recognize our
privileges as nobles."

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.070
So, it's a tradeoff.
 

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:50.231
But in absolute states,
there's no doubt who rules and

00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:52.529
who helps rule.
 

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:57.856
So, in absolute states big
noble families are very happy to

00:13:57.856 --> 00:14:03.918
send their offspring to become
commanders in the army and navy,

00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:05.480
where they never do a damn
thing,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:11.778
or to become big bishops like
Talleyrand,

00:14:11.778 --> 00:14:19.381
and to profit from the state
while recognizing that the big

00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:21.678
guy,
the king and the queen,

00:14:21.678 --> 00:14:24.720
have absolute authority over
them.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.711
Now, the classic case,
of course, Louis XIV you can

00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:29.750
read about.
 

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:34.017
Louis XIV when he was a kid,
he was about twelve or thirteen

00:14:34.017 --> 00:14:36.259
years old, he lived in Paris.
 

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:40.580
He lived in the Tuileries
palace along the Seine,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.720
which was burned in 1871 during
the commune.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.905
There was a huge old
insurrection called the Fronde,

00:14:49.905 --> 00:14:51.330
F-R-O-N-D-E.
 

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.812
A fronde was a kind of a
slingshot that Paris street

00:14:54.812 --> 00:14:58.235
urchins used to shoot fancy
people with rocks as they rode

00:14:58.235 --> 00:15:01.538
their carriages through the
muddy streets of Paris.

00:15:01.538 --> 00:15:05.899
It's a noble insurrection
against royal authority,

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:09.360
and in Auvergne in central
France you have people rising up

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.687
against their lords saying,
"Hell with you.

00:15:11.687 --> 00:15:12.710
We're not going to pay
anymore."

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.464
When he's a boy,
he hears the crowd shouting

00:15:16.464 --> 00:15:19.870
outside of the royal palace in
Paris.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.830
It scares the hell out of him.
 

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.830
At one time they burst into his
bedroom and he's a little guy.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:31.639
When royal authority conquers
these rebels,

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.547
the frondeurs--;you
don't have to remember any of

00:15:34.547 --> 00:15:35.547
that,
F-R-O-N-D-E,

00:15:35.547 --> 00:15:37.328
it's good cocktail party
conversation,

00:15:37.328 --> 00:15:40.932
or something like that,
but it's important--he makes

00:15:40.932 --> 00:15:42.966
them,
literally, he's a bigger guy

00:15:42.966 --> 00:15:45.139
then,
they literally come and they

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:48.763
bow down,
and they swear allegiance to

00:15:48.763 --> 00:15:54.798
him in exchange for protection
and the recognition of their

00:15:54.798 --> 00:15:59.500
privileges as nobles,
as titled nobles.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.049
That's really the defining
moment in absolute rule.

00:16:04.049 --> 00:16:07.048
What does Louis XIV do?
 

00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:09.820
He goes out and builds
Versailles.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.210
He only goes back to Paris I
think three times ever.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.710
He doesn't like Paris.
 

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.288
Versailles is only eighteen
kilometers away.

00:16:17.288 --> 00:16:20.100
It's about eleven or twelve
miles away.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.255
The women of Paris in October,
many of them will walk to

00:16:23.255 --> 00:16:25.840
Versailles to bring the king
back to Paris.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.144
After that, he's essentially,
well to put it kind of

00:16:29.144 --> 00:16:31.283
ridiculously,
toast, French toast,

00:16:31.283 --> 00:16:32.710
when that happens.
 

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.038
He builds this big--I call it a
noble theme park,

00:16:36.038 --> 00:16:37.908
basically, at Versailles.
 

00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:40.428
It's not the most interesting
of the châteaux at all.

00:16:40.428 --> 00:16:43.520
The most interesting is
Vaux-le-Vicomte,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.899
which is southeast of Paris.
 

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:49.230
It's a big sort of
sprawling--gardens everywhere.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.340
Ten thousand nobles lived there.
 

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.490
How boring!
 

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.788
But the point was that they
could be watched,

00:16:56.788 --> 00:17:00.322
that they're not going to--they
can chase each other's wives and

00:17:00.322 --> 00:17:03.403
mistresses around,
and they can eat big drunken

00:17:03.403 --> 00:17:03.879
meals.
 

00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:06.778
The château was so big
that when it freezes,

00:17:06.778 --> 00:17:10.053
they were trying to get to the
bathroom and most of them never

00:17:10.053 --> 00:17:13.326
made it and peed on these long
corridors that some of you have

00:17:13.326 --> 00:17:13.808
seen.
 

00:17:13.808 --> 00:17:18.545
The wine would freeze on the
way from the kitchen through--it

00:17:18.545 --> 00:17:21.150
is sad--to the big dining hall.
 

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:26.428
But he has 10,000 of these
dudes and dudesses there that

00:17:26.428 --> 00:17:29.019
he's going to watch over.
 

00:17:29.019 --> 00:17:30.823
They can conspire against each
other, and they can hit on each

00:17:30.823 --> 00:17:31.740
other's wives and mistresses.
 

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.259
He could give one damn.
 

00:17:33.259 --> 00:17:35.568
But he can control them there.
 

00:17:35.568 --> 00:17:38.940
He only goes back to Paris
three times ever.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.230
All the time he's expanding his
own personal power

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.848
vis-à-vis his own
population,

00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:50.089
conquering Alsace and parts of
Lorraine and going to these

00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:52.940
inevitable natural frontiers.
 

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.390
Napoleon thought the natural
frontier was the Pacific Ocean.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.500
That would be another story.
 

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.436
So, this is what,
in a nutshell,

00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:03.278
kind of what absolutism was.
 

00:18:03.278 --> 00:18:08.089
But let me say two things now,
after having said that.

00:18:08.089 --> 00:18:11.670
There were doctrines.
 

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.568
You can read about this
stuff--geez, it's obvious.

00:18:13.568 --> 00:18:17.205
But there were doctrines of
absolutism that originated with

00:18:17.205 --> 00:18:18.210
jurists early.
 

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.098
This was out there.
 

00:18:20.098 --> 00:18:24.476
There was a theoretical
conceptual framework for having

00:18:24.476 --> 00:18:27.798
a king or queen having absolute
powers.

00:18:27.798 --> 00:18:33.078
Even the development of this
theory of absolute rule is in

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:38.542
response to the rise of these
territorial states like Spain,

00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:41.599
and France, and Russia later.
 

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.230
France is a good example.
 

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.833
I quote in here a guy who
croaks before this course

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:52.140
starts, Jean Bodin,
B-O-D-I-N.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.664
He says,
"Seeing that nothing upon

00:18:54.664 --> 00:18:58.000
earth is greater or higher next
unto God than the majesty of

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.865
kings and sovereign
princes,"

00:18:59.865 --> 00:19:02.750
he wrote in Six Books of the
Republic,

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.362
"the principal point of
sovereign majesty and absolute

00:19:05.362 --> 00:19:07.660
power was to consist principally
in giving laws,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.506
dictating laws,
onto the subjects in general

00:19:11.506 --> 00:19:14.190
without their consent."
 

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.428
So, for absolute rulers,
the link to religion you can

00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:20.648
read about,
but there's always the sense

00:19:20.648 --> 00:19:25.348
that he or she is doing God's
will by exploiting ordinary

00:19:25.348 --> 00:19:28.276
peasants,
ordinary people and conquering

00:19:28.276 --> 00:19:29.440
other territories.
 

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.730
But there's a theoretical
framework,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.160
and it will catch up with the
French monarchs,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.040
among others,
later--that the ruler must be a

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.480
father,
a benevolent figure.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.068
As I said, in some context last
time,

00:19:46.068 --> 00:19:48.808
how many Russian peasants died
in the 1890s thinking,

00:19:48.808 --> 00:19:50.663
"Oh my god,
if the czar only knew that

00:19:50.663 --> 00:19:53.176
we're starving,
how angry he would be with his

00:19:53.176 --> 00:19:54.150
officials."
 

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.618
Well, he could have given one
damn how many millions of them

00:19:58.618 --> 00:19:59.150
died.
 

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:04.924
But this was the image,
that the big person is there to

00:20:04.924 --> 00:20:10.058
protect you, and that his glory
is your glory.

00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:15.028
But along with this conceptual
framework,

00:20:15.028 --> 00:20:20.009
provided by none other than
Thomas Hobbs in England,

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:22.377
who had lived through the
English Civil War and thought

00:20:22.377 --> 00:20:25.009
that you shouldn't mess around
with this rights business,

00:20:25.009 --> 00:20:27.555
you need some sort of big
powerful monarch there--but

00:20:27.555 --> 00:20:29.710
there was a sense inherent in
all of this.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.107
This will be important to try
and understand the French

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:33.795
Revolution,
La Révolution

00:20:33.795 --> 00:20:37.299
française,
that there's a difference

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:40.619
between absolutism and
despotism.

00:20:40.619 --> 00:20:45.160
And that even conceptually,
theoretically,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:53.353
if the monarch goes too far
against the weight of the past

00:20:53.353 --> 00:21:01.835
that there is inherent in this
the idea that he or she might

00:21:01.835 --> 00:21:03.559
well go.
 

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:07.356
Of course,
you can imagine the thoughts of

00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:12.094
Louis XVI as they were cutting
back his hair to await the fall

00:21:12.094 --> 00:21:16.210
of the guillotine on the 21^(st)
of January, 1793.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.769
In the cabarets and the
estaminets,

00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:23.508
the bars of Paris of which
there are many,

00:21:23.508 --> 00:21:26.700
many, many--happily so--in
1789,

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.349
when ordinary people are
drinking to the Third Estate,

00:21:29.349 --> 00:21:33.714
and talking about despotism,
and finding examples from what

00:21:33.714 --> 00:21:37.868
they saw around them as
representing despotic behavior.

00:21:37.868 --> 00:21:41.376
That line had clearly been
crossed and helps explain why it

00:21:41.376 --> 00:21:44.884
was that in a country in which
there weren't ten people who

00:21:44.884 --> 00:21:46.700
wanted a republic in 1789.
 

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.839
It was possible to imagine life
without a king.

00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:51.569
Imagine that.
 

00:21:51.569 --> 00:21:56.420
So, that's there as well.
 

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.000
Now, let's characterize--oh,
geez.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.900
we've got to move here.
 

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.509
Let's characterize absolute
rule.

00:22:03.509 --> 00:22:06.988
Now, you did have,
in many of these countries,

00:22:06.988 --> 00:22:11.240
diets, or parliaments,
or some representative bodies.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.819
Again, the king doesn't have to
call them.

00:22:13.819 --> 00:22:16.510
In the case of France again,
since we're talking so much

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.259
about Louis XIV,
they call the Estates General,

00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:25.424
which is to represent all the
provinces after the

00:22:25.424 --> 00:22:30.160
assassination of Henry IV in
1610 or 1612.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.588
Appropriately enough,
he was stabbed to death in a

00:22:32.588 --> 00:22:35.579
traffic jam in Paris when his
carriage gets blocked in the

00:22:35.579 --> 00:22:39.550
center of Paris,
and this mad monk sticks a big

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.108
knife into him.
 

00:22:41.108 --> 00:22:44.184
So, they call the Estates
General then,

00:22:44.184 --> 00:22:47.990
but the king never calls it
again until 1789.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.788
So, you have these diets and
you have these parliaments,

00:22:50.788 --> 00:22:56.021
but one of the characteristics
of absolute rule is that you

00:22:56.021 --> 00:23:00.692
don't have to call these bodies,
because the king is the big

00:23:00.692 --> 00:23:01.140
person.
 

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.554
Now, in the case of England,
one of the causes of the

00:23:04.554 --> 00:23:08.894
English Civil War is the refusal
of the kings to pay any

00:23:08.894 --> 00:23:11.175
attention,
to recognize the rights of

00:23:11.175 --> 00:23:13.798
parliament that people in the
British imaginaire,

00:23:13.798 --> 00:23:17.525
in the British collective
memory--I believe started on

00:23:17.525 --> 00:23:19.630
June 15^(th),
which is my birthday,

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.390
1215, although I wasn't born
yet in 1215.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.220
And, so, the idea of the
freeborn Englishperson,

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.868
Englishman is what they would
have said in those days,

00:23:28.868 --> 00:23:32.308
meant that rights of parliament
had to be respected.

00:23:32.308 --> 00:23:36.910
When it looks like those kings
are going to restore

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.951
Catholicism,
at least have lots of paintings

00:23:39.951 --> 00:23:42.230
of swooning cherubs,
and cupids,

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:48.539
and Baroque Italian art in
Windsor, and London,

00:23:48.539 --> 00:23:52.140
and these other places,
then you've got a revolution.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.240
So, absolute rulers didn't
really have to pay attention to

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.940
these assemblies.
 

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.569
The best example I can think of
offhand,

00:24:00.569 --> 00:24:02.920
I should let this wait,
but Peter the Great,

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.059
the czar of the Russians,
who may or may not have beaten

00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:08.137
his son to death,
at least he ordered him

00:24:08.137 --> 00:24:08.618
tortured.
 

00:24:08.618 --> 00:24:12.940
Peter the Great was a huge sort
of power-forward-sized guy at a

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.380
time when people were very
small.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.690
He had this thing called the
drunken assembly,

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.998
which was in a way kind of a
mockery of parliamentary

00:24:20.998 --> 00:24:24.560
representations where his
cronies would come and just get

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.568
wasted and would make all sorts
of flamboyant proclamations that

00:24:28.568 --> 00:24:32.259
seemed to represent what a real
parliament would do.

00:24:32.259 --> 00:24:34.286
But in fact,
Peter the Great listened to

00:24:34.286 --> 00:24:36.519
whom he wanted to and ignored
the others.

00:24:36.519 --> 00:24:38.231
And sometimes had them killed
if he had to,

00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:40.636
if he thought that's what he
should do, because there wasn't

00:24:40.636 --> 00:24:42.390
any sort of challenge to his
authority.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.000
That, my friends,
is part of what it meant.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.231
So, I already mentioned about
how nobles become junior

00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:53.700
partners in absolutism.
 

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.380
That's not a bad phrase,
junior partners in absolutism.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.868
So, what happens?
 

00:24:57.868 --> 00:25:02.691
Two ways of measuring how this
happened and what difference it

00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:05.530
made is to realize,
to return to what I said

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.729
earlier,
that big state structures

00:25:07.729 --> 00:25:09.328
involve bureaucracies.
 

00:25:09.328 --> 00:25:13.670
So, the king's representatives
go out in the name of the king.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.497
They give out justice,
or the lack of justice,

00:25:17.497 --> 00:25:21.750
or they send armies in,
or taxes, or this stuff.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.584
Now, the Renaissance
city-states of Italy had

00:25:24.584 --> 00:25:26.903
relatively efficient
administrations,

00:25:26.903 --> 00:25:27.868
to be sure.
 

00:25:27.868 --> 00:25:31.914
But these are royal
bureaucracies that expand

00:25:31.914 --> 00:25:34.029
dramatically in size.
 

00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:37.161
Even though decentralized
England expands its bureaucracy

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:40.292
and collected taxes much more
efficiently than across the

00:25:40.292 --> 00:25:44.863
channel in France,
state-making involved more

00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:47.009
officials there.
 

00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:50.868
So, in order to raise money,
you have to enforce taxes.

00:25:50.868 --> 00:25:53.529
So, you may farm taxes out to
someone.

00:25:53.529 --> 00:25:56.910
They'll keep as much of the cut
as they can possibly steal.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.269
Or to make money you'll sell
noble titles.

00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:03.309
This gets the French kings into
trouble.

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:04.880
Or you sell monopolies.
 

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.344
Peter the Great had a monopoly
on dice, because people gambled

00:26:09.344 --> 00:26:09.930
a lot.
 

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.130
The nobles gambled all the time.
 

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.430
You could gamble serfs,
real people.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.068
You could gamble them.
 

00:26:14.068 --> 00:26:16.750
You could lose them with a bad
hand.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.868
This was Russia.
 

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:22.109
So, the monopoly on dice he
sells.

00:26:22.109 --> 00:26:23.720
He sells the monopoly on salt.
 

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.950
Salt was a big commodity,
obviously, for storing meat.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:30.068
That monopoly is sold in
various places.

00:26:30.068 --> 00:26:32.776
So, these officials,
nobles get these kinds of

00:26:32.776 --> 00:26:35.422
officials, and really,
they could rake it in,

00:26:35.422 --> 00:26:38.788
get these titles and they are
representing the king.

00:26:38.788 --> 00:26:40.971
They're governors,
or intendants you call

00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:41.759
them in France.
 

00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:48.460
And it expands the number of
officials dramatically.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.808
Then there's warfare.
 

00:26:52.808 --> 00:26:56.592
There is nothing more
symptomatic of the growth of

00:26:56.592 --> 00:27:00.528
absolute rule than the growth of
powerful armies.

00:27:00.528 --> 00:27:02.692
Again, when you traveling
around Europe,

00:27:02.692 --> 00:27:05.855
if you're lucky to do that,
you'll see these big fortified

00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:06.410
towns.
 

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.983
In the case of France again,
they are the work of a

00:27:09.983 --> 00:27:12.915
brilliant military engineer
called Vauban,

00:27:12.915 --> 00:27:14.058
V-A-U-B-A-N.
 

00:27:14.058 --> 00:27:15.997
You go to a place like
Perpignan or Lille or

00:27:15.997 --> 00:27:18.068
Montmédy,
they're all over the place.

00:27:18.068 --> 00:27:22.438
And these are fortress-like
defenses in an age of

00:27:22.438 --> 00:27:25.348
essentially defensive warfare.
 

00:27:25.348 --> 00:27:26.940
But if you're going to have a
big old fort,

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.608
and you're going to have lots
of cannon that you hope to use

00:27:29.608 --> 00:27:32.038
against your craven,
reptile enemies that would want

00:27:32.038 --> 00:27:34.058
to get in your way,
you've got to have people to

00:27:34.058 --> 00:27:34.828
try out the cannon.
 

00:27:34.828 --> 00:27:37.348
You have to have people who
live in these fortifications.

00:27:37.348 --> 00:27:41.690
So, the size of the armies for
these megalomaniac wars,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:46.746
these dynastic wars between
Austria and France--and then

00:27:46.746 --> 00:27:50.690
they changed partners in 1756,
and all of this business.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.858
You can read about that.
 

00:27:51.858 --> 00:27:59.220
But the big story is huge,
huge, huge amount of troops.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.368
During the sixteenth century,
the peacetime armies of the

00:28:02.368 --> 00:28:05.799
Continental Powers were about
10,000 to 20,000 soldiers--very,

00:28:05.799 --> 00:28:06.700
very little.
 

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.618
By the 1690s, 150,000 soldiers.
 

00:28:10.618 --> 00:28:14.195
The French army,
which was then in the 1690s

00:28:14.195 --> 00:28:15.608
180,000 people.
 

00:28:15.608 --> 00:28:17.990
That's twice the Michigan
football stadium.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.171
Can you imagine a stadium
packed with soldiers and all

00:28:20.171 --> 00:28:20.460
that?
 

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.237
How boring.
 

00:28:21.237 --> 00:28:24.063
But, anyway,
it rose to 350,000 soldiers,

00:28:24.063 --> 00:28:25.828
the largest in Europe.
 

00:28:25.828 --> 00:28:29.500
I think I have in this edition
a table the size of European

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.069
armies.
 

00:28:30.069 --> 00:28:36.970
Habsburg empire, 1690,50,000;
1756,200,000.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.750
A polyglot army,
too, because of all the

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.940
different nationalities.
 

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.259
Prussia identified with the
Junkers,

00:28:43.259 --> 00:28:48.009
the nobles who were army
officers,

00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:49.846
the dueling scars that they
had--that Bismarck would have in

00:28:49.846 --> 00:28:53.598
a unified Germany,
a mere 30,000 people in 1690;

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:58.579
195,000 people during the Seven
Years' War;

00:28:58.579 --> 00:29:04.299
in 1789,190,000;
in 1812, as they're fighting

00:29:04.299 --> 00:29:07.048
Napoleon, 270,000 people.
 

00:29:07.048 --> 00:29:12.657
This is in a state that barely
extends beyond Brandenburg and

00:29:12.657 --> 00:29:18.640
Pomerania in what now is Western
Poland, and still Prussia in the

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.509
unified Germany.
 

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:24.200
Even Sweden,
100 at the time of the Battle

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.368
of Poltava.
 

00:29:25.368 --> 00:29:26.151
Forget it.
 

00:29:26.151 --> 00:29:29.200
Well, don't forget it,
but read about.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.160
In 1709, that's when Sweden
loses to Russia.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.990
The Swedish army was 110,000
people, soldiers.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.700
That's an awful lot.
 

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.640
So, that's one of the things
that happens.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.835
The modern state in action,
the absolute state in action is

00:29:44.835 --> 00:29:46.009
the army.
 

00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:48.355
Even in peacetime,
military expenditures take up

00:29:48.355 --> 00:29:50.702
almost half of the budget of any
European state,

00:29:50.702 --> 00:29:52.700
and in times of war,
eighty percent.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.515
Having said all that,
let me just--oops,

00:29:57.515 --> 00:30:00.849
try to turn this baby on.
 

00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:03.680
Did that go on?
 

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.390
Why didn't that go on?
 

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.640
Oh, I've got to put this thing
down.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.420
That's it.
 

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:18.409
Again, these just illustrate my
point, which is:

00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:24.778
Why did nobles and even other
people agree to all of this?

00:30:24.778 --> 00:30:28.998
If they're being exploited,
they've got big armies that can

00:30:28.998 --> 00:30:32.490
crush them like grapes if they
get in the way.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.345
But one argument that can be
made is that things were so

00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:40.551
terrible and so out of control
in the earlier period that the

00:30:40.551 --> 00:30:44.548
strengthening of the state is
something that people saw as

00:30:44.548 --> 00:30:45.740
beneficial.
 

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.009
Again, Hobbes is over the top.
 

00:30:49.009 --> 00:30:51.915
Hobbes wants this sort of
dictatorship to keep people from

00:30:51.915 --> 00:30:53.650
brawling in the state of nature.
 

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.000
Again, the elite in Britain
were scared,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.369
because you've got all these
Ranter groups and Levelers and

00:30:58.369 --> 00:31:00.413
people who believe that
everybody ought to have the

00:31:00.413 --> 00:31:02.348
right to vote,
whether they have property or

00:31:02.348 --> 00:31:04.390
not and people that believe in
the right of women.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.108
This is pretty scary.
 

00:31:06.108 --> 00:31:08.248
So, people like Hobbes thought,
"Well, we need a really

00:31:08.248 --> 00:31:09.009
strong state."
 

00:31:09.009 --> 00:31:12.630
But that's not the outcome of
the English Civil War.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:17.328
But how did this work in other
places?

00:31:17.328 --> 00:31:23.575
Theodore Rabb's argument is
basically that the terrible wars

00:31:23.575 --> 00:31:29.291
of religion that had ripped
central Europe apart in the

00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:36.067
middle of the nineteenth century
led people to look for the kinds

00:31:36.067 --> 00:31:40.619
of safety provided by a strong
ruler.

00:31:40.619 --> 00:31:43.808
That what had begun,
and we'll see this in a minute,

00:31:43.808 --> 00:31:47.490
as a war between protestants
and Catholics,

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:51.618
a war that began in Prague when
somebody gets defenestrated,

00:31:51.618 --> 00:31:54.604
which is a fancy word for
throwing somebody out of a

00:31:54.604 --> 00:31:57.931
window,
that this ended up being a war

00:31:57.931 --> 00:32:02.773
fought by just vicious
mercenaries who slaughtered the

00:32:02.773 --> 00:32:05.788
populations of central Europe.
 

00:32:05.788 --> 00:32:07.741
It didn't matter if they were
Protestants or Catholics or

00:32:07.741 --> 00:32:08.299
anything else.
 

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:10.528
They simply killed them.
 

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:16.228
And that this terrified elites
in much of Europe and had the

00:32:16.228 --> 00:32:21.926
same equivalent of what the
Fronde did for scaring elites in

00:32:21.926 --> 00:32:22.990
France.
 

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.679
One of the arguments that he
makes, and I can't make it as

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:27.801
strongly because I don't know
enough about it,

00:32:27.801 --> 00:32:29.358
is the scientific revolution.
 

00:32:29.358 --> 00:32:32.920
What I know about it is what
you're kind enough to read.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.009
It was hard to piece all of
this stuff together.

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:40.978
But there is this sort of sense
of uncertainty that you see in

00:32:40.978 --> 00:32:44.020
someone like Descartes,
who finally just goes back to

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.209
basics and says,
"I think,

00:32:46.209 --> 00:32:48.329
therefore I am."
 

00:32:48.329 --> 00:32:49.750
Here I am.
 

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:54.818
They go from there to a
methodology of science,

00:32:54.818 --> 00:33:02.009
a methodology of trying to
study things in a rational way,

00:33:02.009 --> 00:33:06.723
to get rid of the kinds of
blind faith that seem to have

00:33:06.723 --> 00:33:10.167
led to this,
this utter catastrophe of mass

00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:11.680
slaughter in Europe.
 

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.220
There are signs all over the
place that this has happened.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:20.230
"I think,
therefore I am."

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:26.823
There is a return to these
kinds of theoretical defenses of

00:33:26.823 --> 00:33:33.757
absolutism that even preceded
the growth of the absolute state

00:33:33.757 --> 00:33:36.598
as I've described it.
 

00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:41.349
Absolutism did not simply just
emerge out of this turmoil.

00:33:41.349 --> 00:33:44.646
As I already suggested,
and I would insist upon this

00:33:44.646 --> 00:33:46.855
again,
that the consolidation of

00:33:46.855 --> 00:33:51.190
territorial rulers had already
given the basis to an expanding,

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.150
more formalized state
structure,

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:57.660
even in England.
 

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.880
This is for sure.
 

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.200
It all just doesn't start like
that.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:08.010
Louis XIV was preceded in
number by Louis XIII.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:12.846
Louis XIII helped expand the
compelling course of structures

00:34:12.846 --> 00:34:14.650
of the French state.
 

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.139
But yet when you look at all of
this,

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.030
you can see that the kind of
chaos,

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:24.244
the political upheavals finds
in response in the growth of

00:34:24.244 --> 00:34:30.010
central government authority and
the growth of bureaucracies.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.514
It wasn't only in Sweden,
Austria, Russia,

00:34:31.514 --> 00:34:32.030
France, etc.
 

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.119
where you found this.
 

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:36.047
Even in smaller states like
Württemberg,

00:34:36.047 --> 00:34:40.039
a state in Germany which was a
sort of middle-sized state.

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:44.099
Even there you see the same
phenomenon on a very lower,

00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:47.588
smaller level,
at least in terms of the size

00:34:47.588 --> 00:34:50.250
of the state,
where people are giving up,

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.971
willing to compromise on their
privileges in order for the

00:34:53.971 --> 00:34:57.039
protection of the ruler of
Württemberg,

00:34:57.039 --> 00:34:59.626
who would never be confused
with Louis XIV or Peter the

00:34:59.626 --> 00:35:00.010
Great.
 

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.039
So, this really becomes a sort
of European-wide phenomenon.

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:06.202
You can apply this also to the
Glorious Revolution in England

00:35:06.202 --> 00:35:06.730
as well.
 

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:11.693
People are happy to have a
monarch back who is going to

00:35:11.693 --> 00:35:13.440
reassert control.
 

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.146
In the case of England,
they're very happy to have a

00:35:17.146 --> 00:35:20.853
monarch back who was not
threatening to turn England

00:35:20.853 --> 00:35:23.179
again into a Catholic state.
 

00:35:23.179 --> 00:35:28.543
So, this is the sort of
argument that you can make,

00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:34.552
even in a state that had a
constitutional monarch such as

00:35:34.552 --> 00:35:35.840
England.
 

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.052
Let me just give you a couple
examples of what one can mean

00:35:39.052 --> 00:35:39.440
here.
 

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.989
Again, these are painters that
you may have come across.

00:35:41.989 --> 00:35:44.766
It doesn't matter if you've
never heard of them or if you

00:35:44.766 --> 00:35:46.800
never think of them again--but,
Titian.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.320
The famous Titian.
 

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.431
This is his picture of Charles
V at a battle in Germany in

00:35:55.431 --> 00:35:56.059
1648.
 

00:35:56.059 --> 00:36:00.230
This is a pretty dramatic
representation of war.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.434
This is like Clint Eastwood,
The Good,

00:36:02.434 --> 00:36:05.739
the Bad, and the Ugly. This
is a guy, he's armored up;

00:36:05.739 --> 00:36:06.820
he's ready to go.
 

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:13.391
He's somebody to be emulated
from the point of view of the

00:36:13.391 --> 00:36:14.429
viewer.
 

00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:19.257
But at the same time,
this is slightly earlier,

00:36:19.257 --> 00:36:24.820
this is a painting--thanks,
Dan--this is a painting of

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.130
Bruegel the Elder.
 

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:32.369
The first is the Triumph of
Death,

00:36:32.369 --> 00:36:35.768
where you see what happens in
real battle when people are just

00:36:35.768 --> 00:36:38.882
sort of slaughtered,
and the commanders are off at a

00:36:38.882 --> 00:36:39.768
safe distance.
 

00:36:39.768 --> 00:36:45.460
Here again, the massacre of the
innocents, where villages are

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.730
just being executed because they
are there.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:54.802
The Triumph of Death,
the dialogue of the

00:36:54.802 --> 00:36:59.230
mathematician Pascal is quoted
by Rabb.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.079
"Why are you killing me
for your own benefit?

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:02.260
I am unarmed."
 

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.677
"Why?
 

00:37:02.677 --> 00:37:04.597
You do not live on the other
side of the water,

00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:05.139
my friend.
 

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:07.909
If you lived on this side,
I should be a murderer.

00:37:07.909 --> 00:37:11.353
But since you live on the other
side, I'm a brave man and it is

00:37:11.353 --> 00:37:13.018
right that I kill you."
 

00:37:13.018 --> 00:37:15.539
When the Swedes get into the
act,

00:37:15.539 --> 00:37:19.974
Gustavus Adolphus brings this
huge old Swedish army down and

00:37:19.974 --> 00:37:22.380
they do a lot of damage,
too,

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.800
and people are absolutely being
devastated.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.268
Here's Reubens' The Horror
of War.

00:37:30.268 --> 00:37:33.748
There's a reason why the first
attempt to even write about

00:37:33.748 --> 00:37:36.250
international law comes at this
period.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.230
Again, this is before the
course, but why not?

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:43.630
Hugo Grotius writes the Law
of War and Peace.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.900
He publishes it in 1625.
 

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.000
The goal was to stop stuff like
this,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.431
to try to create a legal
framework in which states could

00:37:52.431 --> 00:37:55.427
resolve their kind of
differences without kind of

00:37:55.427 --> 00:37:57.050
butchering each other.
 

00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:00.199
So, there we go.
 

00:38:00.199 --> 00:38:05.681
But somewhat here in war and
peace of battle is slowly being

00:38:05.681 --> 00:38:08.469
relegated to the background.
 

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:10.530
But let me give you another
example.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.199
Here's the famous Spanish
painter.

00:38:14.199 --> 00:38:14.940
Again, don't worry about it.
 

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:20.099
Velazquez, who died in 1610,
I think.

00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:23.260
No, it's 1660, sorry.
 

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.920
This is his portrait of Mars.
 

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.570
Mars is the god of war.
 

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:31.748
Now, how different that is than
the portrait of Charles that you

00:38:31.748 --> 00:38:32.809
saw by Titian.
 

00:38:32.809 --> 00:38:36.809
Here, this guy looks like kind
of an overweight NFL player who

00:38:36.809 --> 00:38:39.630
hasn't really gotten ready for
the drill.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.518
He's very human.
 

00:38:41.518 --> 00:38:45.059
There's nothing admirable about
him.

00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:47.034
It's just war is being dissed
by those people that are just so

00:38:47.034 --> 00:38:47.780
tired of the killing.
 

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.447
And Mars has this sort of
human, flabby torso that's

00:38:51.447 --> 00:38:55.188
not--it's sympathetic,
but it's a different portrayal

00:38:55.188 --> 00:38:55.980
of war.
 

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.219
People are getting tired of the
whole damn thing.

00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:00.179
He's dull.
 

00:39:00.179 --> 00:39:05.530
He's uncouth and he's extremely
human.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:10.181
Now, one of the reasons why
people would--it's unthinkable

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:14.833
for someone like me or for
probably most of you to imagine

00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:19.239
giving up your rights to a kind
of absolute rule,

00:39:19.239 --> 00:39:20.710
though we seem to be in a
situation like that,

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.376
where that's happened quite a
lot recently,

00:39:22.376 --> 00:39:23.449
even in this own country.
 

00:39:23.449 --> 00:39:26.362
But these are just
illustrations that come out of

00:39:26.362 --> 00:39:29.518
the Thirty Years' War,
which people are trying to put

00:39:29.518 --> 00:39:30.489
behind them.
 

00:39:30.489 --> 00:39:35.101
This is a French painter,
drawer, lithographer called

00:39:35.101 --> 00:39:36.610
Jacques Callot.
 

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:42.418
These are just many ways that
people died during the Thirty

00:39:42.418 --> 00:39:43.719
Years' War.
 

00:39:43.719 --> 00:39:46.510
This is simply The
Execution.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.070
You don't even need the formal
titles of these.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.260
But these get around.
 

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.880
Peddlers who had these big,
big leather bags that would go

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.722
around Europe and sell things
like pins and miraculous images

00:39:57.722 --> 00:40:01.307
of the Virgin Mary and the
stories of saints and all this

00:40:01.307 --> 00:40:04.510
kind of stuff and Joan of Arc or
Robin Hood,

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.811
in the case of England,
become part of the collective

00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:08.469
memory.
 

00:40:08.469 --> 00:40:12.994
These kinds of images do get
around of the horrors of war

00:40:12.994 --> 00:40:16.469
that the misfortunes and horrors
of war,

00:40:16.469 --> 00:40:19.320
which is basically what he
calls this entire series.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.985
Here's the people sort of
standing around watching this

00:40:22.985 --> 00:40:23.800
execution.
 

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.318
This is somebody being tortured
at the stake for merely

00:40:27.318 --> 00:40:30.903
existing, for having not
confessed to being a Protestant

00:40:30.903 --> 00:40:32.860
or a Catholic or whatever.
 

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.054
I'll tell you,
in the south of France near

00:40:34.054 --> 00:40:35.711
where we live,
when there was a lot of

00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:38.190
resistance in World War II
against the Germans,

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.326
there were some Protestant
villages there that were

00:40:40.326 --> 00:40:41.780
noteworthy for their resistance.
 

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.210
A lot of Catholics resisted,
too.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.791
But one of the interesting
things about some of the

00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:48.942
villages that I know down there
is that there were big mission

00:40:48.942 --> 00:40:52.092
crosses that were put out after
the wars of religion that were

00:40:52.092 --> 00:40:55.139
sort of symbols of conquest by
the all-Catholic king.

00:40:55.139 --> 00:40:57.516
Is it in the collective memory
that people remember three

00:40:57.516 --> 00:41:00.019
centuries later that the
Catholic Church was identified,

00:41:00.019 --> 00:41:03.391
at least as a hierarchy,
with the Vichy Regime in World

00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:03.900
War II?
 

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.880
That's interesting,
a fascinating subject.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.460
But, anyway,
this poor guy's not doing very

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.840
well up there and becomes this
sort of big spectacle.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.380
These are dying soldiers along
the side of the road.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:20.427
It's sort of a sympathetic look
at--that's the name of this--of

00:41:20.427 --> 00:41:22.320
these expiring dudes there.
 

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.420
Here's the attack on a
stagecoach.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.579
The point of this is it didn't
matter who you were.

00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:30.288
If you were in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

00:41:30.288 --> 00:41:31.360
you were history.
 

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.050
That was all.
 

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.199
There were new ways to be
killed.

00:41:34.199 --> 00:41:38.487
Certainly in Europe,
not until the massacres of the

00:41:38.487 --> 00:41:41.742
Armenians,
and arguably some Napoleonic

00:41:41.742 --> 00:41:44.356
atrocities,
and Napoleon's armies'

00:41:44.356 --> 00:41:48.110
atrocities in Palestine,
or in the south of Italy,

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.809
or in Spain as well.
 

00:41:49.809 --> 00:41:55.510
But there was nothing like this
really, including World War I.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:59.802
There were some atrocities at
the beginning of World War I,

00:41:59.802 --> 00:42:04.242
but there was nothing like this
again until World War II and,

00:42:04.242 --> 00:42:05.869
of course, Bosnia.
 

00:42:05.869 --> 00:42:08.780
The point is this is why lots
of people thought,

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.422
"I don't like this guy
sending people around and taking

00:42:11.422 --> 00:42:13.445
my taxes,
but I don't want to get offed

00:42:13.445 --> 00:42:14.420
by some marauders.
 

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.409
Just hang â€˜em high,
hang â€˜em all high."

00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:24.865
These were real ways that
people were executed--stakes,

00:42:24.865 --> 00:42:29.530
massacres, and this sort of
business.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:33.199
There's a convent,
church that's going to go.

00:42:33.199 --> 00:42:34.570
It's a Catholic church.
 

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.030
You can tell from the top.
 

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.860
So, maybe these are Protestant
mercenaries.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.469
It didn't matter,
because the Protestant armies

00:42:39.469 --> 00:42:41.639
had Catholic mercenaries and the
Catholic armies had Protestant

00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:42.199
mercenaries.
 

00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:46.250
Everybody had Dalmatians,
people from the Dalmatian

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.789
coast, and Swiss.
 

00:42:47.789 --> 00:42:50.132
You have to imagine a time when
Switzerland wasn't extremely

00:42:50.132 --> 00:42:50.530
wealthy.
 

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:54.577
Swiss were great,
famous mercenaries fighting in

00:42:54.577 --> 00:42:55.869
these armies.
 

00:42:55.869 --> 00:42:57.666
Again, the Swedish,
the "Swedish

00:42:57.666 --> 00:42:59.864
cocktail"
was sort of suffocating people

00:42:59.864 --> 00:43:02.710
by stuffing manure down their
throat until they died.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:06.800
This was a nasty time.
 

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.293
I guess this is what Hobbes
meant by "nasty,

00:43:09.293 --> 00:43:12.150
short, and brutish,"
or whatever the fourth was.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.443
I don't remember,
but what life was in the Thirty

00:43:15.443 --> 00:43:18.050
Years' War, that was the way it
was.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:22.210
Now, out of all of this,
again to repeat,

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:26.541
we are not making the argument
that the Thirty Years' War

00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:30.362
itself led to absolute rule,
that the growth of state

00:43:30.362 --> 00:43:33.922
structures can be seen in the
beginning and the late medieval

00:43:33.922 --> 00:43:37.780
period with the consolidation of
these territorial monarchies.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:42.380
There were already bureaucrats
representing the royal will.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.929
There were already armies.
 

00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:50.628
But many, particularly
two--bureaucracies and powerful

00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:56.436
standing military forces--are
characteristics of modern

00:43:56.436 --> 00:43:57.619
states.
 

00:43:57.619 --> 00:44:03.226
And to try to explain why it
was that absolute rule came to

00:44:03.226 --> 00:44:09.358
Europe at the time it did,
one has to not only look at the

00:44:09.358 --> 00:44:14.518
particular structures of states,
but one has to look at the

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:16.900
overview and the sheer horror of
it all.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.619
The boy king,
Louis XIV, hearing the crowd

00:44:21.619 --> 00:44:25.190
shouting outside of his room.
 

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:29.101
He goes out to Versailles and
creates this noble theme park

00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:33.148
and sort of a Euro Disney for
nobles where he can watch these

00:44:33.148 --> 00:44:33.889
nobles.
 

00:44:33.889 --> 00:44:37.221
They agree to be junior
partners of absolute rule and

00:44:37.221 --> 00:44:39.079
they weren't the only ones.
 

00:44:39.079 --> 00:44:42.699
The great power struggles of
the eighteenth century would be

00:44:42.699 --> 00:44:46.012
very different than this
bloodletting of civilians that

00:44:46.012 --> 00:44:47.239
had preceded it.
 

00:44:47.239 --> 00:44:51.170
There were professional kinds
of armies and all of that.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.320
But those are more themes for
future lectures.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.409
Wednesday I'm going to talk
about exceptions to absolutism,

00:44:57.409 --> 00:45:01.862
what the Dutch and what the
English had in common that gave

00:45:01.862 --> 00:45:05.010
them very different political
outcomes.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.543
That's important,
too, in the emergence of the

00:45:08.543 --> 00:45:11.369
country in which many of you
live.

00:45:11.369 --> 00:45:11.800
See you.

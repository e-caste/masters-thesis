00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.492
Prof: We're going to
talk today about managing

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:05.610
technological dangers.
 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.627
And this case history on
nuclear weapons is really a good

00:00:09.627 --> 00:00:12.275
one,
because it provides insight

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:15.931
into a whole array of
technological hazards and

00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:20.301
dangers that we'll pick up in
different cases as we move

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:22.050
through the term.
 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.037
This one is quite distinctive,
and it'll give us a chance to

00:00:26.037 --> 00:00:29.350
explore a number of questions in
this lecture,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.240
particularly about different
strategies,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.864
like how you might decide to
manage dangers in different

00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:37.580
ways.
 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.280
One typical approach that was
used in this history was the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.260
reliance on expertise.
 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.781
So technical experts had the
responsibility not just to

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:54.414
design the new weapons,
to think about the other kind

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:58.270
of public interest applications,
especially nuclear energy in

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.783
the 1950s,
but also to worry about what

00:01:01.783 --> 00:01:08.000
would happen to the bombs and
material once it was exploded.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.450
So the idea that you would
concentrate expertise in an

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.355
organization such as the Atomic
Energy Commission at the same

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:19.001
time that you would give them
complete authority over the

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.777
technology so that the statute
that was passed in 1946 that

00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:25.836
created the AEC was really
remarkable in that it

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:29.828
concentrated authority,
it concentrated knowledge,

00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:33.247
it gave the AEC the
intellectual property rights so

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:37.282
that no corporation was allowed
to understand or work on the

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:40.837
technology unless they had
received specific security

00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:42.069
clearances.
 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.711
So this overlap of unlimited
resources, unlimited expertise,

00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:50.330
and complete authority is
really remarkable.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.099
I can't imagine a concentration
of more power in one

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:55.209
organization.
 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:00.644
Another critical approach to
managing technological hazards

00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:04.019
is the control of
experimentation.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.420
So how would you try it out?
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.818
And there are many products in
the marketplace,

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:11.128
many chemicals,
many other kinds of

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:14.683
technologies for burning fuels,
coal, gasoline,

00:02:14.683 --> 00:02:18.667
that are released in the
markets without adequate

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:19.580
testing.
 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.073
So here's one that was released
at grand scale and the public

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:28.491
really had no understanding of
what the government was doing

00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:32.460
because of the classified nature
of the projects.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.793
So they amassed expertise in
the form of academic experts to

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:41.126
try to figure out not only what
the destructive power of the

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:45.680
different weapons would be but
also what happened to them.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.300
Public education is another
approach,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.750
and we'll see in a film clip in
a few moments,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.500
if our audio and video work
correctly,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.268
we'll see the Atomic Energy
Commission's public service

00:02:56.268 --> 00:02:59.812
announcements,
designed to maintain and build

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.240
public support.
 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.385
So obviously,
the public was well aware that

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:09.340
these nuclear explosions were
going on.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.198
I mean, walking to the top of
casinos and hotels in Las Vegas

00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:15.318
at night to watch them explode.
 

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:17.038
I mean, the public was well
aware of this,

00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:20.072
but they understood well the
destructive power but they

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:23.610
didn't really know what to make
of what the danger might be,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.790
the danger to the environment,
the danger to human health of

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.128
the remnants of the explosions.
 

00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:33.268
Another approach would be to
limit the potency of a

00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:36.470
technology, so to try it on a
really small scale.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.329
And what's curious about this
was that the arms race that grew

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.479
between the Soviets and the U.S.
 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.729
caused the development,
the rapid development,

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.917
of bigger and bigger weapons,
greater and greater explosive

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:50.639
power.
 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.479
So that rather than trying to
move from a system which we'll

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.538
see in a couple weeks with
pesticides,

00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:03.330
or pharmaceuticals is another
good example,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.109
where the attempt on the part
of corporations is to evermore

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.211
design technologies or drugs or
biocides that pose less and less

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:17.829
risk but are still effective in
getting the job done.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.069
Minimize environmental release
and exposure.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:27.002
The increased potency moving
from the first atom bombs to the

00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:31.937
hydrogen bombs in the mid-1950s
was the opposite direction so

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:36.377
that more and more materials
were being released to the

00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:39.420
atmosphere as testing expanded.
 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.187
Another notion that grew in
this history was the idea of

00:04:43.187 --> 00:04:45.718
susceptibility,
special vulnerability,

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:49.201
that different people would be
exposed to these chemicals in

00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:52.684
different ways because of their
behavior or because of their

00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:54.160
specific physiology.
 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.358
So that chemicals move
differently in children or in

00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:01.569
fetuses than they do in you or
in me.

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.377
So that basic patterns of
growth and development

00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:08.220
determined this.
 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.250
And also compensating those
that are harmed.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.663
So that with vaccines,
H1N1 vaccine is a good example

00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:15.319
of that.
 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.649
Vaccines always affect some
people adversely.

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:21.629
And if people are seriously
damaged,

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:23.670
if their health loss is
substantial,

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.492
we have laws that are in place
to offer compensation if the

00:05:28.492 --> 00:05:32.899
adverse effect can be tied
tightly to the exposure.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.730
So that we'll look in a few
moments,

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.329
or closer to the end of the
lecture,

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:38.870
at different compensation
strategies,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.283
recognizing that there would be
people that would be intensely

00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:45.221
exposed,
particularly those that were

00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:49.117
involved in producing the
technology or in other

00:05:49.117 --> 00:05:53.759
occupations that led them to
experience greater risk.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.184
So the Atomic Energy Act of
1946 really created this

00:05:57.184 --> 00:05:57.990
authority.
 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.170
It's a remarkable piece of
legislation, and there are very

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.425
few other pieces of law that I
can point to that would give

00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:08.920
such power to an organization.
 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.533
So it created a five-member
Atomic Energy Commission that

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:16.338
was assigned the responsibility
to manage the technology.

00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:20.000
And this gradually evolved into
the Department of Energy,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.439
which we have today.
 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:42.572
So I'm going to try to show a
couple film clips here,

00:06:42.572 --> 00:07:06.552
hopefully this will pick up,
on the effects of radiation and

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:11.430
fallout.
 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.403
Video Narrator 1:
: Gamma radiation may do its

00:07:13.403 --> 00:07:15.149
damage in either of two major
ways, or both.

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:18.038
One, it may physically and
directly destroy tissue or

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:21.259
eventually cause the development
of some kind of cancer.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:23.918
Those which concern us
principally have life period

00:07:23.918 --> 00:07:26.629
ranging from several years to
thousands of years.

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:30.899
They can do no harm unless they
are taken into our bodies with

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:34.399
food or drinking water or in the
air we breathe.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:36.641
Video Narrator 3:
Let us consider the results

00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:39.233
of a powerful thermonuclear
explosion at the Pacific Proving

00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:42.660
Grounds in the Marshall Islands,
eleven degrees north of the

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.259
equator.
 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.149
The huge cloud soars up,
punches through the tropopause,

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:52.764
and finally spreads and
stabilizes as high as 70 or

00:07:52.764 --> 00:08:43.153
80,000 feet,
entirely within the

00:08:43.153 --> 00:09:34.418
stratosphere layer.
 

00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:37.163
Video Narrator 2:
What was remarkable about his

00:09:37.163 --> 00:09:40.375
comments was he demonstrated by
the late 1950s that the AEC had

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:43.378
really strong knowledge of not
just what the effects of the

00:09:43.378 --> 00:09:46.899
bombs might be but also what the
health implications might be.

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:48.870
So they'd worked out the
science.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.032
They'd worked out the science
actually in a more sophisticated

00:09:52.032 --> 00:09:54.934
way than we have for the
majority of chemicals that we've

00:09:54.934 --> 00:09:58.149
classified as toxic or hazardous
under the Clean Air Act,

00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:02.517
the Safe Drinking Water Act,
the Toxic Substance Control Act

00:10:02.517 --> 00:10:03.110
today.
 

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.269
So it's really pretty
remarkable that this

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:08.533
concentration of expertise and
authority and resources produced

00:10:08.533 --> 00:10:11.376
a quality of knowledge that is
really pretty unusual in

00:10:11.376 --> 00:10:13.798
twentieth century environmental
history.

00:10:13.798 --> 00:10:19.220
Now, the experts wondered where
they should experiment.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.418
Should they experiment in the
United States?

00:10:21.418 --> 00:10:24.340
Should they experiment in other
parts of the world?

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.081
And they decided that they
would concentrate most of their

00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:31.692
hydrogen bomb explosions in the
Pacific, in the Marshall

00:10:31.692 --> 00:10:32.480
Islands.
 

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.899
And one of the atolls in the
Pacific is Bikini Island,

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:37.769
which is a very small area.
 

00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:41.190
And I'm going to spend a few
moments talking about this.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.604
These atolls basically are
volcanic, so that the rim of the

00:10:44.604 --> 00:10:47.490
volcano is sitting on the
surface of the ocean.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.240
And what you see here is really
a rim of coral and sand.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.089
And several hundred Bikinians
were asked by the federal

00:10:56.089 --> 00:11:00.509
government back in 1945 if they
would move from the island,

00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:03.763
if they would give up their
homeland in order to provide a

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:06.389
location or a territory for the
explosions,

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:11.833
recognizing that the Marshall
Islands are thousands of square

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:15.970
miles of open ocean with a very,
very small population.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.488
There are very few places on
earth where you could find such

00:11:19.488 --> 00:11:22.470
an area where the population
density was so low.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.043
Again, they were worried about
not really understanding what

00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:29.918
would happen to the materials
and what the exposures might be.

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:34.267
So the idea was to move the
islanders away from the center

00:11:34.267 --> 00:11:37.090
of the explosions to safer
islands.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.240
So eventually,
the Bikinians decided that they

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.019
would move from the homeland to
surrounding islands.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:47.707
And the government first placed
them on an island known as

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:48.419
Rongerik.
 

00:11:48.419 --> 00:11:50.918
Rongerik was not as fertile.
 

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:55.029
You can't see this very
carefully, but if you go on

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:58.400
Google Earth,
you'll see the amount of the

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.168
land that is covered by
vegetation is extremely small.

00:12:03.168 --> 00:12:06.071
So that they tried to grow
crops here and they found that

00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:07.730
the soils were very infertile.
 

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.246
Basically, they were just sand
and beneath the sand was

00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:11.178
volcanic material.
 

00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:15.802
So very nutrient-poor soils
that really would not support

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:16.379
them.
 

00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:19.913
And they planted coconut trees,
but the coconut trees were

00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:21.028
killed by fires.
 

00:12:21.028 --> 00:12:25.532
They were then moved to
Kwajalein within about six

00:12:25.532 --> 00:12:26.360
months.
 

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.673
And Kwajalein is another atoll,
it's basically a ring of coral

00:12:30.673 --> 00:12:33.067
reefs,
but it's also a military base

00:12:33.067 --> 00:12:36.945
and they were forced into a tent
encampment for a period of about

00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:40.642
three or four months and they
protested that they had no place

00:12:40.642 --> 00:12:43.788
to grow their own food,
that they had no fishing boats

00:12:43.788 --> 00:12:46.427
and they couldn't maintain the
lifestyle that they had had

00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:46.889
before.
 

00:12:46.889 --> 00:12:50.100
Gradually, they were moved.
 

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.822
Within actually about twelve
months, they were moved to the

00:12:52.822 --> 00:12:53.620
island of Kili.
 

00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:00.807
Kili -- I could not find any
photograph of Kili -- but Kili

00:13:00.807 --> 00:13:05.269
is an island that is not an
atoll.

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:12.774
Instead, it has no lagoon and
it faces the open ocean on all

00:13:12.774 --> 00:13:15.785
sides,
which meant that they had no

00:13:15.785 --> 00:13:18.783
lagoon to fish in,
so that they had very poor

00:13:18.783 --> 00:13:22.001
land, again,
land that would not support the

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:23.649
development of crops.
 

00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:26.602
And gradually,
over a period of several years,

00:13:26.602 --> 00:13:28.769
the population began to starve.
 

00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:33.317
The military eventually brought
them fishing boats that were

00:13:33.317 --> 00:13:37.403
large enough so that they could
continue their fishing

00:13:37.403 --> 00:13:38.558
activities.
 

00:13:38.558 --> 00:13:42.434
But they lived a miserable life
through the 1950s and early

00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:42.970
1960s.
 

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.649
What was going on on Bikini in
their absence was a series of

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:48.759
experiments.
 

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:52.767
And one was quite curious,
it was one of the first

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:57.511
attempts to blow up weapons both
above ground and below the

00:13:57.511 --> 00:13:58.330
ocean.
 

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.623
And they decided to test the
resilience of the naval fleet to

00:14:03.623 --> 00:14:08.740
different intensities of
different sizes of the weapons.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.880
So they amassed this group of
ships that you can see in the

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.639
upper right.
 

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:16.710
And within the center of it,
they detonated a bomb,

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:21.418
wondering what would happen to
the Navy if the Soviets dropped

00:14:21.418 --> 00:14:23.446
a bomb,
say, at Pearl Harbor,

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.419
or if they found a fleet of
U.S.

00:14:25.419 --> 00:14:26.470
ships at sea.
 

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:40.149
&gt;
 

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:41.929
Hello.
 

00:14:41.929 --> 00:15:53.620
&gt;
 

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.153
Prof: Remarkably,
the Atomic Energy Commission

00:15:56.153 --> 00:15:59.779
also hired film crews and
outfitted them in lead suits so

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:03.404
that they would fly in the
vicinity that those were films

00:16:03.404 --> 00:16:07.096
were taken by crews that were
sitting inside aircraft that

00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:10.009
were flying around the mushroom
cloud.

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:12.750
But they also flew directly
into the mushroom cloud.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.586
And before they had offered
them the possibility of the lead

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:19.710
suits to offer protection from
the radiation,

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:23.888
the pilots and the crews came
back and they experienced such a

00:16:23.888 --> 00:16:27.999
high level of radiation that the
experts became quite worried

00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:30.259
about their long-term health.
 

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:33.923
And so that gradually the
shielding grew as they flew in

00:16:33.923 --> 00:16:34.788
and around.
 

00:16:34.788 --> 00:16:36.240
So a single aircraft,
for example,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.804
would be outfitted with up to
seventy different cameras so

00:16:39.804 --> 00:16:43.495
they could figure out what the
pattern of radiation emission

00:16:43.495 --> 00:16:47.437
was and what the effect would be
as the cloud would dissipate in

00:16:47.437 --> 00:16:50.190
the direction of the prevailing
winds.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.852
Now, among the twenty-three
different bombs that were

00:16:53.852 --> 00:16:56.529
dropped on this island,
Bravo, in 1954,

00:16:56.529 --> 00:16:59.558
was perhaps one of the most
remarkable.

00:16:59.558 --> 00:17:03.456
The first hydrogen bomb that
had been developed in the world

00:17:03.456 --> 00:17:07.288
that had an explosive force
nearly 1,000 times the force of

00:17:07.288 --> 00:17:10.130
the bomb that was dropped on
Hiroshima.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.017
So that they really did not
understand what the effect might

00:17:14.017 --> 00:17:18.299
be, what the distance of damage
would be away from ground zero.

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:21.058
So this was called the Big One.
 

00:17:21.058 --> 00:17:23.289
And by the way,
these clips are coming from a

00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:26.332
film that I'll put on reserve if
you'd like to see the entire

00:17:26.332 --> 00:19:33.555
film,
called The Atomic Bomb

00:19:33.555 --> 00:20:29.308
Movie.
 

00:20:29.308 --> 00:20:31.173
Video Narrator:
: Significantly exceeding its

00:20:31.173 --> 00:20:32.710
expected yield by two and a half
times,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.108
Castle Bravo,
with an explosive power of

00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:38.154
fifteen megatons,
stripped islands clean of

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:41.640
vegetation and took the
scientists by surprise.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:49.598
The huge explosion released
large quantities of radioactive

00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:53.578
debris into the atmosphere.
 

00:20:53.578 --> 00:20:54.808
Prof: So it surprised
the President,

00:20:54.808 --> 00:20:58.233
it surprised the experts,
it created destruction over an

00:20:58.233 --> 00:21:00.598
area that was completely
unexpected.

00:21:00.598 --> 00:21:04.867
When they finally interpreted
the radiation readings from

00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:08.830
ships and different monitoring
facilities that they'd

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.880
established, they produced this
map.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.073
This is a contour map in a way,
and a contour map with the

00:21:16.073 --> 00:21:20.338
different ellipses would
represent different elevations.

00:21:20.338 --> 00:21:23.563
So think about this as
representing different

00:21:23.563 --> 00:21:27.813
intensities of radiation that
one would experience had they

00:21:27.813 --> 00:21:31.548
been in proximity to the site of
the explosion.

00:21:31.548 --> 00:21:35.086
First of all,
the explosion itself created a

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:39.775
crater in the atoll that was a
mile and a half wide in one

00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:43.970
direction and a mile wide in
another direction.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.210
But this graph or chart was
more disturbing,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.634
especially to those that had
security clearances and were

00:21:51.634 --> 00:21:55.000
responsible for funding in the
Senate and the House,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.872
because it demonstrated that
the lethal zone is represented

00:21:58.872 --> 00:22:01.210
by the area that's
cross-hatched.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:06.288
This area spans a distance of
about 170 miles in length by

00:22:06.288 --> 00:22:09.048
about seventy miles in width.
 

00:22:09.048 --> 00:22:16.740
So if this were a perfect
circle and it landed on say,

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.078
downtown in the mall in
Washington,

00:22:19.078 --> 00:22:22.713
D.C., it would have wiped out
all of the buildings within a

00:22:22.713 --> 00:22:24.028
twelve-mile radius.
 

00:22:24.028 --> 00:22:28.799
Within a matter of several
years, the Russians developed a

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:33.989
bomb that they first found was
too big in order to lift off the

00:22:33.989 --> 00:22:34.910
ground.
 

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.713
And eventually,
they worried that the aircraft

00:22:37.713 --> 00:22:41.453
that would release it wouldn't
be able to get far enough away

00:22:41.453 --> 00:22:43.759
so that it wouldn't be
destroyed.

00:22:43.759 --> 00:22:47.324
And gradually,
they overcame those technical

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:52.381
difficulties and Tsar Bomba was
the largest bomb ever exploded

00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:56.608
up in northern Russia in the
twentieth century.

00:22:56.608 --> 00:23:01.946
And it had a destructive force
that was lethal over a distance

00:23:01.946 --> 00:23:05.884
of some 500 miles,
1,500 square miles would be

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:08.160
completely devastated.
 

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.942
So the Bikini explosion would
have taken an area from New

00:23:12.942 --> 00:23:17.470
Jersey to the other side of
Boston and leveled it,

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.971
and an area that roughly would
have gone from just south of

00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:24.690
Albany down to Long Island
Sound.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.682
It would have destroyed all the
structures, it would have made

00:23:27.682 --> 00:23:28.910
the area uninhabitable.
 

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.784
It would have irradiated the
soil so that no crops could

00:23:31.784 --> 00:23:32.150
grow.
 

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:35.737
Any other vegetation that might
grow would have absorbed the

00:23:35.737 --> 00:23:36.710
radionuclides.
 

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.269
So the trees could not be used
for building material,

00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:42.410
they couldn't be used for
firewood,

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.729
because it would simply release
the radioactivity back into the

00:23:45.729 --> 00:23:47.710
atmosphere or into the
environment.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.682
This understanding of the
enormous destructive force of a

00:23:51.682 --> 00:23:56.010
single weapon really transformed
the impression of the experts

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.630
about the implications of what
they were doing.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:04.265
And they were extremely worried
that the public would understand

00:24:04.265 --> 00:24:08.680
the scale of the damage that the
single weapon could face.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.392
By the way, how many nuclear
weapons were in existence by the

00:24:13.392 --> 00:24:15.670
late 1980s and early 1990s?
 

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.505
Roughly 70,000,
that ranged from the bombs of

00:24:19.505 --> 00:24:24.909
this scale to those that would
be deliverable via a suitcase or

00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:27.348
from an artillery shell.
 

00:24:27.348 --> 00:24:30.730
So an enormous diversity of
weapons, an enormous destructive

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.680
capacity that was being amassed.
 

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.298
It was simply being built up in
the stockpiles around the world.

00:24:36.298 --> 00:24:41.808
So what was the result of this
understanding?

00:24:41.808 --> 00:24:44.529
More classification of
information.

00:24:44.529 --> 00:24:47.813
More secrecy,
more worry about how to tell a

00:24:47.813 --> 00:24:51.019
story to develop a narrative
advantage,

00:24:51.019 --> 00:24:55.771
to be able to persuade the
public that continued testing

00:24:55.771 --> 00:25:00.784
was important and that in order
to prevent the Soviets from

00:25:00.784 --> 00:25:05.450
believing that they could
survive a first strike,

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.808
that we would build more
weapons and bigger weapons.

00:25:08.808 --> 00:25:12.009
Now, what about the island
itself?

00:25:12.009 --> 00:25:16.291
What about the environmental
implications of twenty-three

00:25:16.291 --> 00:25:20.652
different tests on a South
Pacific or a Pacific atoll such

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:21.568
as this?
 

00:25:21.568 --> 00:25:24.640
Well, you saw what happened to
the coconut trees.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.529
All of the fronds were blown
off it, all the coconuts were

00:25:28.529 --> 00:25:30.305
blown off it,
all the bark,

00:25:30.305 --> 00:25:33.240
the exterior bark was burned
off of it.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.973
Well, the government decided
that well, we'll just go back

00:25:36.973 --> 00:25:40.710
and we'll cut all those trees
and we'll plant new ones.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.618
So they planted 50,000 new
coconut trees on the island.

00:25:43.618 --> 00:25:46.946
They then said,
"Well, we know that the

00:25:46.946 --> 00:25:49.808
soils are still highly
radioactive.

00:25:49.808 --> 00:25:52.702
Well, we'll go in and we'll
scrape all those soils off and

00:25:52.702 --> 00:25:55.749
we'll bring in soil from other
islands so that they will have

00:25:55.749 --> 00:25:58.440
the potential once again to grow
new crops."

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.500
So they were thinking about
well, in the film clip you saw a

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.609
few minutes ago,
you saw the Atomic Energy

00:26:06.609 --> 00:26:10.104
Commission official saying that
they understood what the key

00:26:10.104 --> 00:26:14.195
routes of exposure might be,
and those were via air,

00:26:14.195 --> 00:26:17.538
via food, and via drinking
water,

00:26:17.538 --> 00:26:20.328
or by dermal uptake,
through the skin.

00:26:20.328 --> 00:26:24.128
Now, those are the four routes
of exposure that we would think

00:26:24.128 --> 00:26:28.115
about today if we were wondering
about the risk or the hazards of

00:26:28.115 --> 00:26:29.299
any technology.
 

00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:30.880
What's the route of exposure?
 

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.980
Is it by air,
is it by food,

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.558
is it by inhalation,
is it by dermal uptake?

00:26:36.558 --> 00:26:39.710
These are all ways that
chemicals can get in your body.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.450
So understanding their
persistence in vegetation,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.038
their pattern of accumulation
in different kinds of foods,

00:26:46.038 --> 00:26:49.170
did the compounds make their
way into drinking water?

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.618
And what would be their
persistence?

00:26:51.618 --> 00:26:54.519
What would be their ecological
pathways?

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:56.318
How would they move through the
environment?

00:26:56.318 --> 00:27:04.829
And what would the long-term
threat be?

00:27:04.829 --> 00:27:06.630
So here's an example.
 

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:10.851
After planting 50,000 coconut
trees, they found no hint that

00:27:10.851 --> 00:27:13.856
there would be a problem with
the coconuts,

00:27:13.856 --> 00:27:16.289
the vegetables,
and the water.

00:27:16.289 --> 00:27:18.960
This was as late as early 1978.
 

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.378
So they faced this problem,
how do we persuade the public

00:27:23.378 --> 00:27:27.720
that this dangerous technology
was worth developing,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.174
that it made sense to continue
the funding and continue the

00:27:31.174 --> 00:27:34.690
testing based on the argument
that we have to understand how

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.670
we might be able to survive a
nuclear attack,

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:42.098
but also that the Russians need
to understand that they could

00:27:42.098 --> 00:27:46.233
not possibly initiate a nuclear
attack without committing

00:27:46.233 --> 00:27:47.118
suicide.
 

00:27:47.118 --> 00:27:50.328
So they developed a variety of
different public service

00:27:50.328 --> 00:27:52.355
announcements,
and I'm going to show you one

00:27:52.355 --> 00:27:55.421
of those now,
that's entitled Common

00:27:55.421 --> 00:27:56.539
Sense.
 

00:27:56.539 --> 00:28:03.930
&gt;
 

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.214
Video Narrator:
 Common sense tells you

00:28:05.214 --> 00:28:06.130
this is dangerous and foolish.
 

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.318
You wouldn't risk your neck in
a trick like this.

00:28:08.318 --> 00:28:11.439
Common sense tells us that
being shot out of a cannon is

00:28:11.439 --> 00:28:12.630
dangerous business.
 

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.593
Common sense tells you not to
be careless at an airfield with

00:28:15.593 --> 00:28:17.519
propellers and jet engines in
action.

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:20.674
And with that in mind,
this too looks dangerous,

00:28:20.674 --> 00:28:23.630
but it's an--
&gt;

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.019
--because they observed common
sense safety requirements.

00:28:26.019 --> 00:28:29.239
But sometimes we forget that
security violations can be

00:28:29.239 --> 00:28:30.730
dangerous business too.
 

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.867
If classified information about
this test mission fell into

00:28:33.867 --> 00:28:35.942
enemy hands,
the consequences can be

00:28:35.942 --> 00:28:39.309
disastrous to all of us,
individually and collectively

00:28:39.309 --> 00:28:40.180
as a nation.
 

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.440
Security is only common sense.
 

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.922
Don't take chances,
avoid loose talk,

00:28:44.922 --> 00:28:48.232
safeguard classified
information, report security

00:28:48.232 --> 00:28:49.818
violations at once.
 

00:28:49.818 --> 00:28:52.786
Prompt action may prevent a
minor incident from developing

00:28:52.786 --> 00:28:53.880
into a serious one.
 

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.609
Avoid writing about classified
material in letters home.

00:28:57.609 --> 00:28:59.460
Be sure you're secure!
 

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.058
Don't be careless!
 

00:29:01.058 --> 00:29:04.880
Marilyn Monroe (on video):
 I hate a careless man.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.588
Prof: This is a U.S.
 

00:29:08.588 --> 00:29:11.021
Air Force film,
and this is Marilyn Monroe,

00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:14.324
who was, you probably know,
a film star during that period

00:29:14.324 --> 00:29:15.019
of time.
 

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:21.579
So message there was the
technology is manageable.

00:29:21.579 --> 00:29:22.950
Use common sense.
 

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.880
Avoid exposure.
 

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.390
And what would this mean?
 

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.611
What would this mean to
hundreds of millions of people

00:29:30.611 --> 00:29:32.798
in the United States at the
time,

00:29:32.798 --> 00:29:35.902
or to the government's
responsibility to educate them

00:29:35.902 --> 00:29:38.108
so that they would know what to
do?

00:29:38.108 --> 00:29:43.861
Well, Tsar Bomba and the Bravo
test basically told them that

00:29:43.861 --> 00:29:47.759
the cities were enormously
vulnerable.

00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:51.130
So what happened during the
Eisenhower era?

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.359
One of the first things that
was done following this was the

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:59.375
investment of tens of billions
of dollars in the National

00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:00.808
Highway Program.
 

00:30:00.808 --> 00:30:03.672
So the argument was,
well, we really need to be able

00:30:03.672 --> 00:30:07.170
to move troops around the city,
but they were really concerned

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.450
about developing the capacity to
evacuate.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.964
Is there the possibility that
we could protect against

00:30:13.964 --> 00:30:18.140
dangerous exposures which are
most of concern,

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:23.355
they're highest in closest
proximity in space and time to

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:25.588
the site of the blast.
 

00:30:25.588 --> 00:30:31.750
So if we could warn people via
sirens, via radio announcements.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.088
If we could tell people what
they need to do in the event

00:30:34.088 --> 00:30:36.220
that we detected an attack,
that would help them.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.343
So not only did they build
hundreds of thousands of miles

00:30:40.343 --> 00:30:44.760
of highways in the United States
in the hope that evacuations

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.609
might work,
but they also developed

00:30:47.609 --> 00:30:48.990
evacuation drills.
 

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.461
And I don't have a shot of
Duck and Cover,

00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:54.088
but ask your parents about
Duck and Cover.

00:30:54.088 --> 00:30:58.384
They probably remember being
told that an emergency drill was

00:30:58.384 --> 00:31:02.038
going to be held in the school,
all the children are now

00:31:02.038 --> 00:31:04.731
required to get down on their
hands and knees and duck

00:31:04.731 --> 00:31:07.118
underneath their desks and cover
their head.

00:31:07.118 --> 00:31:10.357
In fact, there's a cute little
song that I almost developed the

00:31:10.357 --> 00:31:13.282
courage to sing to you called
"Duck and Cover,"

00:31:13.282 --> 00:31:15.318
but I'm going to resist doing
that.

00:31:15.318 --> 00:31:19.364
The idea that ducking and
covering beneath your school

00:31:19.364 --> 00:31:23.255
desk would offer you a
sufficient protection against

00:31:23.255 --> 00:31:27.452
exposure and the damage of
collapsing buildings is quite

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:28.750
ridiculous.
 

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.038
But it was part of their
approach,

00:31:31.038 --> 00:31:34.468
it was part of their persuasive
strategy to convince the public

00:31:34.468 --> 00:31:36.460
that they could take
precautions,

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.538
they could get themselves into
the subway,

00:31:38.538 --> 00:31:41.969
they could build the fallout
shelters and store it with food

00:31:41.969 --> 00:31:45.574
and water and offer themselves
protection until the bulk of the

00:31:45.574 --> 00:31:47.259
radiation had blown away.
 

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:51.154
Well, you know,
we've quite a bit of experience

00:31:51.154 --> 00:31:55.219
with evacuation drills,
and a couple that you may

00:31:55.219 --> 00:31:58.858
recall would include Hurricane
Katrina.

00:31:58.858 --> 00:32:03.259
Hurricane Katrina found people
sitting on the highway stalled,

00:32:03.259 --> 00:32:11.140
trying to leave southern
Louisiana and parts of Texas,

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.460
and also other parts of the
Gulf Coast.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.971
So that moving people out of a
city, even despite having an

00:32:16.971 --> 00:32:20.545
interstate highway system is
much more difficult than anyone

00:32:20.545 --> 00:32:22.180
could possibly imagine.
 

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.962
And these are a bit out of
order, but I wanted to come back

00:32:24.962 --> 00:32:26.259
and show you this notice.
 

00:32:26.259 --> 00:32:29.939
Back in 2005,
the Connecticut State Police

00:32:29.939 --> 00:32:33.259
ordered an evacuation of the
state.

00:32:33.259 --> 00:32:37.363
There was no stated purpose,
but this aired on the radio and

00:32:37.363 --> 00:32:41.675
it was out on the internet that
an evacuation of the cities was

00:32:41.675 --> 00:32:42.720
called for.
 

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.142
And it was an error,
it was an electronic signal

00:32:45.142 --> 00:32:46.380
that had been tripped.
 

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.915
And what was the public's
response to the evacuation

00:32:49.915 --> 00:32:51.720
request and the warning?
 

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.000
Nothing.
 

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.828
They didn't even receive one
phone call.

00:32:54.828 --> 00:33:00.528
So that the public is quite
actually resistant to rings of

00:33:00.528 --> 00:33:01.730
the alarm.
 

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.778
So although the Bikinians were
promised that only one or two

00:33:05.778 --> 00:33:09.690
tests would be conducted on
their island back in 1945,

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:14.497
more nuclear energy was
released on this one site than

00:33:14.497 --> 00:33:17.308
at any other site in history.
 

00:33:17.308 --> 00:33:21.008
So that the cumulative force of
bombs that exploded there was

00:33:21.008 --> 00:33:24.707
nearly four times the energy
released over almost 1,000 tests

00:33:24.707 --> 00:33:27.048
conducted at the Nevada Test
Site.

00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:33.608
So this was labeled the most
contaminated site in the world.

00:33:33.608 --> 00:33:37.289
And at the same time,
President Johnson was feeling

00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:41.705
great pressure to clean up the
island and to basically remove

00:33:41.705 --> 00:33:46.473
the radioactive sands and soils,
to restore the vegetation,

00:33:46.473 --> 00:33:51.428
to try to figure out whether or
not fisheries might be viable so

00:33:51.428 --> 00:33:55.358
that the population could return
to the island.

00:33:55.358 --> 00:34:00.131
So one decade after the bombing
ceased, President Johnson gave

00:34:00.131 --> 00:34:04.588
the okay for the Bikinians to
return to their homeland.

00:34:04.588 --> 00:34:10.739
Now, during the next decade,
scientists continued to work,

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:14.039
particularly at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory on Long

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:16.911
Island,
and reported back to the House

00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:17.829
and Senate.
 

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:21.983
And here's an example that the
House Appropriations Committee

00:34:21.983 --> 00:34:25.514
heard reports from these
scientists in 1973 that the

00:34:25.514 --> 00:34:29.668
cesium-137 concentrations were
ten times higher than the 1970

00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:30.570
levels.
 

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.840
Cesium is measured in their
urine.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.739
It's an easy radionuclide to
detect.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:39.590
And it was attributed to the
foods that were grown on the

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.050
island.
 

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.688
So during the period when they
were restoring the soils and

00:34:42.688 --> 00:34:45.510
they were trying to figure out
which crops they could grow,

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.050
they were often importing food.
 

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.280
But as they grew more and more
food on the island,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.018
they found that the plants that
they had chosen were drawing the

00:34:53.018 --> 00:34:56.760
radionuclides from the soils and
from the underground waters.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.121
So they decided,
oh, well perhaps our

00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:01.809
surveillance was not sufficient
enough.

00:35:01.809 --> 00:35:04.661
Our sampling strategy didn't
pick up the fact that the

00:35:04.661 --> 00:35:07.512
underlying aquifers were
contaminated or that the soil

00:35:07.512 --> 00:35:10.849
concentrations were higher than
were originally estimated.

00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:14.202
And they found that they had
scraped the topsoil off but they

00:35:14.202 --> 00:35:17.878
had not gone deeply enough,
and that some of the plants

00:35:17.878 --> 00:35:22.318
were drawing water up from a
distance that included sands and

00:35:22.318 --> 00:35:26.980
organic matter that had absorbed
significant concentrations.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.208
So that by 1978,
the body burden exceeded the

00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:36.012
maximum permissible level
according to the National

00:35:36.012 --> 00:35:38.320
Institute of Health.
 

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.463
They took the islanders off the
island again and they were

00:35:41.463 --> 00:35:45.568
returned to the island of Kili,
the one that has no coral reef

00:35:45.568 --> 00:35:49.940
surrounding,
that was open to pounding surf.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:56.679
So they were allowed to stay
there for a year.

00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:59.135
There were conflicting
interpretations of the evidence

00:35:59.135 --> 00:36:00.110
that was available.
 

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.168
And we'll find this again and
again through the twentieth

00:36:03.168 --> 00:36:05.300
century with respect to air
quality,

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.233
arguments over how much
inhalation of an air pollutant

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:11.670
is okay,
or how much of a drinking water

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.159
contaminant is okay,
or how much of a pesticide

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:15.449
residue in food is okay.
 

00:36:15.449 --> 00:36:18.956
You find that often,
the government or the purveyor

00:36:18.956 --> 00:36:22.394
of the dangerous technology will
make an argument,

00:36:22.394 --> 00:36:24.500
"Well, you know what?
 

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.920
Let's average the risk."
 

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.262
So the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission reduced its radiation

00:36:30.262 --> 00:36:35.137
dose estimate of the inhabitants
by averaging the exposure to the

00:36:35.137 --> 00:36:36.280
population.
 

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.994
So Rosalie Bertell,
from the Nuclear Regulatory

00:36:40.994 --> 00:36:43.382
Commission,
protested to this,

00:36:43.382 --> 00:36:46.454
arguing, "This is like
telling one smoking member of a

00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:49.630
family his or her risk of lung
cancer is lowered if the other

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.384
non-smoking members of the
family are included and an

00:36:52.384 --> 00:36:53.920
average risk is given.
 

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.407
It's scientifically ridiculous
as an approach to public

00:36:56.407 --> 00:36:57.099
health."
 

00:36:57.099 --> 00:37:00.563
So this idea of averaging risk
across people when you have some

00:37:00.563 --> 00:37:03.300
people that would be more
exposed than others,

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.806
some people would have a diet
that might be high in coconut

00:37:05.806 --> 00:37:06.110
milk.
 

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:09.833
And during periods of drought
throughout the Marshall Islands

00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:12.463
in the Pacific,
it's pretty well known that the

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:15.298
islanders stayed hydrated by
drinking more and more coconut

00:37:15.298 --> 00:37:15.690
milk.
 

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.400
Coconut milk happens to be
loaded with saturated fats.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.016
So the saturated fats were very
effective in binding on to some

00:37:23.016 --> 00:37:24.360
of the radionuclides.
 

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.297
And that explained why the
drought was correlated with an

00:37:27.297 --> 00:37:29.815
increase in the body
concentration of some of the

00:37:29.815 --> 00:37:30.550
compounds.
 

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:34.393
So the idea of averaging that
across the entire population,

00:37:34.393 --> 00:37:36.980
across space and time,
made no sense.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.684
By 1999, the Government
Accounting Office,

00:37:39.684 --> 00:37:41.730
is what it used to be called.
 

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.306
By the way, that's now the
Government Accountability

00:37:44.306 --> 00:37:46.480
Office, if you ever are
searching for it.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.076
And it's a great site to look
at for critical evaluations of

00:37:50.076 --> 00:37:53.621
government activities,
and particularly with respect

00:37:53.621 --> 00:37:57.177
to environmental and health
problems associated with

00:37:57.177 --> 00:38:00.193
dangerous technologies,
that's Government

00:38:00.193 --> 00:38:01.730
Accountability Office.
 

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:07.101
They argued for restricted
access and that if the return of

00:38:07.101 --> 00:38:11.697
the former residents occurred,
that it would expose them to

00:38:11.697 --> 00:38:15.047
dangerous levels of radiation
despite the fact that they spent

00:38:15.047 --> 00:38:17.409
$100 million trying to restore
the site.

00:38:17.409 --> 00:38:22.010
By 1980, the Department of
Energy concluded that the

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.710
Bikinians could return to Enyu
Island,

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:29.722
which is one location in the
Bikini Atoll that received the

00:38:29.722 --> 00:38:33.619
least amount of radiation,
but only if they ate no more

00:38:33.619 --> 00:38:37.467
than fifty percent of locally
grown food and spent no more

00:38:37.467 --> 00:38:40.909
than ten percent of their time
on Bikini Island.

00:38:40.909 --> 00:38:43.824
So this idea that they could
adjust their behavior in a way

00:38:43.824 --> 00:38:46.889
that would reduce their exposure
is a very interesting one.

00:38:46.889 --> 00:38:50.797
One of the islanders,
Pero Joel in 1989,

00:38:50.797 --> 00:38:55.407
reflected on the second exodus
from the island,

00:38:55.407 --> 00:38:57.101
saying:
"Finally,

00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:58.967
the Americans and the
scientists came back a few years

00:38:58.967 --> 00:39:00.480
later saying that we had to
leave again.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.833
They said we had ingested too
much poison and that it wasn't

00:39:03.833 --> 00:39:05.710
safe to live on Bikini anymore.
 

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.217
And we didn't care at this
point, because we had already

00:39:08.217 --> 00:39:10.909
started to get that hopeless
feeling again though because we

00:39:10.909 --> 00:39:13.385
all wanted to stay on Bikini,
we did explore all

00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:16.630
possibilities in an attempt to
find a way out of this problem.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.653
We kept thinking the Americans
first told us it was safe to

00:39:19.653 --> 00:39:20.280
live here.
 

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.719
Then they changed their minds
and some rules for us to follow.

00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:26.469
Now they're telling us to leave.
 

00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:27.869
And should we go?"
 

00:39:27.869 --> 00:39:32.750
So they were constantly being
manipulated by estimates of what

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.150
was risky and what was safe.
 

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.938
And gradually,
this became the site of

00:39:37.938 --> 00:39:42.461
extended epidemiological studies
of the health very carefully

00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:46.909
correlated with measurements of
nuclides in their body.

00:39:46.909 --> 00:39:49.170
The quality of the science is
really extraordinary.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.719
Again, it's exemplary in the
twentieth century.

00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:56.525
And they found that thyroid
disease on the islands that

00:39:56.525 --> 00:39:59.980
experienced the greatest fallout
was excessive.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:03.315
More than a third of all the
residents have thyroid disease

00:40:03.315 --> 00:40:04.119
on Rongelap.
 

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:07.730
Rongelap was an island that,
following the Bravo test,

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:11.929
that thermonuclear explosion,
the hydrogen bomb,

00:40:11.929 --> 00:40:15.260
they hadn't expected that the
ash would reach Rongelap.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.030
But the ash fell out of the sky
like it was snow,

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.945
and the children were described
as running along the beach

00:40:20.945 --> 00:40:23.809
picking up the snow and throwing
it over their heads,

00:40:23.809 --> 00:40:26.300
eating it and rubbing it into
their skin.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:30.916
And it didn't take long before
they realized that something was

00:40:30.916 --> 00:40:34.489
terribly awry,
and their skin started to burn.

00:40:34.489 --> 00:40:37.911
They became nauseous and
vomited because of their

00:40:37.911 --> 00:40:39.480
radiation poisoning.
 

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.230
Then they lost their hair.
 

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.856
So that the combination of
exposure to strontium that

00:40:45.856 --> 00:40:50.661
lodges in the bone to the
iodine-131 that lodges in the

00:40:50.661 --> 00:40:55.199
thyroid eventually led to this
thyroid disease.

00:40:55.199 --> 00:40:57.190
So what are the remedies?
 

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.659
What are the remedies for a
population such as this?

00:40:59.659 --> 00:41:04.295
Well, we'll come back to this
when we get back together on

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:07.059
Thursday, but litigation is one.
 

00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:09.788
Litigation is a really
difficult approach,

00:41:09.788 --> 00:41:12.916
because of the amount of time
it normally takes,

00:41:12.916 --> 00:41:16.510
but also the amount of funding
that it would take.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.898
And litigation that would be
brought against the United

00:41:19.898 --> 00:41:22.909
States government would be
fought intensively.

00:41:22.909 --> 00:41:27.045
So that it's not uncommon for
litigation to span a period of

00:41:27.045 --> 00:41:28.869
time including a decade.
 

00:41:28.869 --> 00:41:31.690
Financial compensation.
 

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.409
Financial compensation to those
that can demonstrate that they

00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:37.838
had their property taken away,
that they had their livelihoods

00:41:37.838 --> 00:41:40.670
taken away,
or that they lost their health.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.789
Financial support,
so the building of schools or

00:41:43.789 --> 00:41:46.510
hospitals or roadways or job
training,

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:50.590
that's another possible form of
support or community

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:51.710
development.
 

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.039
Medical monitoring and medical
treatment,

00:41:54.039 --> 00:41:56.679
and also the landscape
restoration costs,

00:41:56.679 --> 00:42:00.849
such as those that occurred
when they removed the soils,

00:42:00.849 --> 00:42:04.672
when they brought in the trees
that cost the government $100

00:42:04.672 --> 00:42:05.320
million.
 

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:10.396
So I'll close with a slide that
a $20 million resettlement trust

00:42:10.396 --> 00:42:15.150
fund for the people of Bikini
was authorized by Congress.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:19.420
And it was later supplemented
with an additional $90 million.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:23.394
And these were used for the
construction and resettlement of

00:42:23.394 --> 00:42:27.639
the Bikinians to live on Kili
Island in another atoll nearby.

00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:32.454
And a fiscal year budget now
ranges between about 7 million

00:42:32.454 --> 00:42:36.773
and $10 million that's going
into this community that

00:42:36.773 --> 00:42:41.340
originally was only several
hundred people in size.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.369
So we'll come back to this
again on Thursday.

00:42:44.369 --> 00:42:47.199
And once again,
my apologies for being late

00:42:47.199 --> 00:42:47.739
today.
 

00:42:47.739 --> 00:42:53.000

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.390
Prof: Okay,
let's get started.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.000
So last time we looked at
methane and ammonia,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.650
and saw something interesting
about molecular orbitals:

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.300
we could give them the same
name as atomic orbitals;

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.127
that is, if we,
especially if we look at a low

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:26.720
electron density contour of the
molecular orbitals,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.070
we see that what it looks like
is an atom where the nucleus is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.650
split into pieces.
 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.440
Right?
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.005
Now that splitting into pieces
changes the potential energy for

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.110
the electron.
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290
So you expect that to distort
the orbital.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.949
The electrons will move in the
directions that pieces of the

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.190
nucleus have gone.
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.313
But then, in addition to
potential energy controlling the

00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:54.700
shape of orbitals,
kinetic energy also does.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.040
And that's the same thing as it
is in an atom.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.390
You have a thing with no nodes,
a thing with one node --

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.055
and when you have one node you
can have either a spherical

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:05.863
node,
or a planar node,

00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:08.680
and there can be three planar
nodes;

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.920
so a 2s and three
2p's.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.879
Exactly the same considerations
apply in a molecular orbital as

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:16.349
in an atomic orbital.
 

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:19.367
You have the kinetic energy,
which comes with curvature,

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:20.739
which comes with nodes.
 

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:25.239
Now, as you split the nucleus
up and pull pieces in different

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:27.223
directions,
it doesn't have the same

00:01:27.223 --> 00:01:29.480
symmetry it had when it was all
together in the nucleus,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.860
a spherical kind of symmetry.
 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.780
So the nodes get distorted.
 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.300
But still you can see them
there.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.706
And we saw them last time and
went through all the occupied

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:42.810
and vacant valance orbitals of
ammonia and methane,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.430
and saw how they looked like
atomic orbitals.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.572
This, not surprisingly,
because it's so fundamental,

00:01:48.572 --> 00:01:51.224
the potential energy and the
kinetic energy,

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:52.950
applies to every system.
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.748
It applies to you,
viewed as a single atom --

00:01:56.748 --> 00:01:57.440
right?
 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.239
-- with a zillion electrons.
 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.900
Okay?
 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.310
But pieces have moved around,
so the orbitals change.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.689
We'll look at two more
complicated cases and then we'll

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.818
get on to a different way of
looking at bonding.

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:12.770
So we'll look at ethane and
methanol.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.177
And we use -- I didn't tell you
last time, explicitly,

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:18.879
where I got the molecular
orbitals from.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.370
I got them from my laptop.
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.274
There's a program -- the
particular one is called

00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:26.054
Spartan,
that I use -- and it calculates

00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:28.508
what molecular orbitals look
like,

00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:31.938
using approximate molecular
orbital (that is,

00:02:31.938 --> 00:02:35.370
Schrödinger equation kind
of) theory.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.770
Okay, so let's just look at the
ones of ethane and methanol.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.128
Now both of these have seven
pairs of valence electrons.

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:47.186
There are also core electrons,
and if we were looking at the

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:50.830
orbitals for all the electrons,
we'd include those.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.229
And exactly how we're going to
count those --

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.098
you could do it one way or the
other --

00:02:56.098 --> 00:02:58.199
whether you consider the core
electrons,

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:01.092
the 1s electrons to just
be part of the nucleus and then

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:03.658
treat the rest as the electrons
you're interested in;

00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:08.020
or whether you want to count
the core electrons too.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.745
You can do it either way,
but what you analogize to what

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:13.620
depends on whether you count
them as part of the nuclei.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.796
So anyhow, we're going to
compare these molecular orbitals

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:22.266
to the atomic orbitals of argon,
which has also seven electron

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:23.000
pairs.
 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.639
Okay, so there's the 2s
orbital.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.490
I'm going to start with that,
because I'm going to pretend

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.340
that that red part is the core
-- that there's a 1s

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.740
which is core electrons.
 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.464
But in this case -- here's my
pedantic note on this

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:39.360
subject which I just added.
 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.913
So if you have -- before we had
just one heavy atom,

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:45.562
carbon in methane,
nitrogen in ammonia.

00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:46.258
Right?
 

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:48.882
So there was one 1s
orbital.

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:49.500
Right?
 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.110
Now we have two heavy atoms,
carbon and carbon in methane,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.699
carbon and oxygen in methanol.
 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:01.461
So there are two heavy atoms
and therefore two boring core

00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:02.378
orbitals.
 

00:04:02.378 --> 00:04:05.120
So for purposes of making
analogies,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.080
we'll use the atomic 1s
orbital,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.258
of the atom that we're
analogizing things to,

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:14.258
to stand for all the molecular
core orbitals.

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:15.490
You can do it any way you want
to.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.870
We're not really interested in
that.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.149
We're interested in the valence
orbitals.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.887
So whether I start with the
1s or the 2s

00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:23.420
depends on how I'm handling the
core electrons;

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.629
it's not a big deal.
 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.845
Anyhow, let's pretend it's the
2s of argon here,

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:33.451
and we're going to compare it
with this lowest valence level

00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:35.949
molecular orbital of ethane.
 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.971
Now we can -- as I do this,
on the left side of the

00:04:40.971 --> 00:04:44.889
pictures I'm going to show one
view,

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.468
and then, because it's more
complicated than methane and

00:04:49.468 --> 00:04:52.052
ammonia were,
I'm going to also show a

00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:53.879
picture rotated by ninety
degrees.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.807
So I'm going to rotate around
that axis, and on the right I'll

00:04:56.807 --> 00:04:58.920
show a different view of the
same orbital.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.298
Okay, so that's the lowest
valence level molecular orbital

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:03.009
of ethane.
 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.769
And it's not very exciting;
it's just a distorted sphere.

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:09.800
And you can see the way in
which it's distorted.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.137
It's distorted vertically,
because the two carbons are

00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:14.841
pulled apart;
so it's got sort of a narrow

00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:15.790
waist to it.
 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.357
And then it's pulled out,
where each of the protons left

00:05:20.357 --> 00:05:24.259
the middle atom to come out and
be hydrogens.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:24.879
Okay?
 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.250
Now if we look at methanol,
it'll be a little different.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.480
Can you anticipate how it might
be different if,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.985
on the bottom we'll have CH_3
again, but on the top,

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:39.490
instead of having CH_3,
we're going to have OH.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.610
How do you think it might be
different, in the way it looks?

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.144
Student:  It might be
skewed more towards the OH

00:05:46.144 --> 00:05:48.855
because oxygen is --
Prof: Okay,

00:05:48.855 --> 00:05:51.470
so oxygen has a bigger nuclear
charge.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.120
So that's going to pull the
lowest energy orbital toward the

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.829
oxygen.
 

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:57.670
That'll be one thing.
 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.329
We expect it to be bigger,
top-heavy.

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:00.939
Okay?
 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.199
What else, about how the top
will look?

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.350
How will it be different from
if it were a CH_3?

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.680
Yes, Alex?
 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.579
I can't hear very well.
 

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.329
Student:  Oxygen has
lone pairs.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.949
Prof: Oxygen has lone
pairs.

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.180
Now, how is that going to
change things?

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.437
Or another way of saying the
same thing is it has only one

00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:19.579
hydrogen up there.
 

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.990
How's that going to change it,
do you think?

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.160
You have to speak up.
 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.319
Student:  It's not going
to be symmetrical.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.500
Prof: It's not going to
be symmetrical.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.689
Which way is it going to be
distorted to be unsymmetrical?

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:31.829
You have to speak up.
 

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:33.440
Student:  Towards the
electron pair.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.690
Prof: Toward the
electron pair did you say?

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.209
I couldn't hear.
 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:37.269
Student:  Away from
hydrogen.

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:39.629
Prof: Away from hydrogen?
 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:41.639
Well how about -- the proton
goes out;

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.490
does it bring electrons with
it, or does it repel electrons,

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.339
the proton?
 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.970
Speak up.
 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.810
Student:  It brings them.
 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.095
Prof: It pulls,
so it should distort toward the

00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:50.569
hydrogen.
 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:52.293
So here's what it looks like.
 

00:06:52.293 --> 00:06:52.709
Right?
 

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.745
It's top-heavy,
as Angela said,

00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:57.800
and it's distorted out toward
the hydrogen;

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.709
there are no protons pulling it
to the top left.

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.266
And you see the same thing
end-on there,

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:04.250
on the right.
 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.060
Okay, this is the next orbital.
 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.610
What does that look like?
 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.060
Obviously you can peek in the
middle and see.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.016
It's obviously a 2p_z
orbital, with the node across

00:07:16.016 --> 00:07:16.920
the middle.
 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.310
Okay?
 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.379
In both cases.
 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:22.089
Now the ethane case is
symmetrical.

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:23.829
The other case is unsymmetrical.
 

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:25.449
Why is it unsymmetrical?
 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:29.464
Because the first orbital
pulled electrons to the top.

00:07:29.464 --> 00:07:30.069
Right?
 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:33.545
So the next- in the next
orbital, electrons aren't going

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:35.819
to want to be at the top so
much,

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:37.959
because they're going to be
repelled by the other electrons;

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.928
so there'll be more toward the
bottom, because the first ones

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:41.819
went to the top.
 

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.410
Okay?
 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.610
Okay, then here's the next
orbital.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.420
You can see there are energies
marching up here.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.769
The lowest one was s,
then 2p_z,

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:56.971
now 2p_x,
if we define the horizontal

00:07:56.971 --> 00:07:59.949
axis here on the left as the x
axis.

00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:03.084
So again, it's what you expect,
and it's pulled out,

00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:06.836
stretched vertically from being
a dumbbell by where the nuclei

00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:07.389
went.
 

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:11.718
And here's 2p_y,
which we can see more clearly

00:08:11.718 --> 00:08:14.466
on the right,
perpendicular to the

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:15.800
2p_x.
 

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800
Okay?
 

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.161
And notice that it's obviously
so, that the methanol orbital

00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:25.434
will be less symmetric,
in all cases,

00:08:25.434 --> 00:08:27.980
than the one for ethane.
 

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.007
But still we can recognize the
nodes, because they must go that

00:08:31.007 --> 00:08:31.300
way.
 

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.344
It must be no nodes,
one node of three different

00:08:35.344 --> 00:08:36.980
kinds, and so on.
 

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.158
Okay, now this is 3s.
 

00:08:40.158 --> 00:08:43.240
You notice it has -- the node
that we don't see,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.120
the one that's down near the
nuclei,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.090
in fact two nodes down near the
nuclei,

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.668
one for each of the heavy atoms.
 

00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:54.861
But then this now has another
spherical node,

00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:57.330
or approximately spherical
node.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.048
So we have that extra red lump
in the middle on the top,

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:02.740
or blue, in the middle.
 

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.804
Just to review,
what's the difference between

00:09:05.804 --> 00:09:06.850
red and blue?
 

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.169
On the top, the computer
decided to draw it with red in

00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:10.970
the middle.
 

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.580
On the bottom it decided to
draw it with blue in the middle.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.350
What do those colors mean?
 

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.519
Yes, Cathy?
 

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.418
Student:  Positive and
negative signs.

00:09:19.418 --> 00:09:20.620
Prof: The mean positive
and negative.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.759
So which one is right?
 

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:24.922
Should it be positive in the
middle or negative in the

00:09:24.922 --> 00:09:25.460
middle?
 

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.090
Student:  Positive.
 

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.940
Prof: Positive is a
guess.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.778
Wilson, what do you say?
 

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:31.460
Student:  It doesn't
matter.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.178
Prof: Why not?
 

00:09:32.178 --> 00:09:33.740
Student:  Because it's
not really positive or negative;

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.379
it's just kind of a phase of it.
 

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:37.941
Prof: Yes,
it's the sign of the wave

00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:38.350
function.
 

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.990
But you can multiply the wave
function by minus one,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.269
any constant,
and it's just as good as it was

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.840
before.
 

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.614
So it's arbitrary,
and the computer was arbitrary

00:09:46.614 --> 00:09:48.058
in choosing the colors.
 

00:09:48.058 --> 00:09:51.027
I think there's actually a
function that I could've changed

00:09:51.027 --> 00:09:53.740
it, if I'd thought to do so,
so they'd be the same.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.519
But actually it tells a story
if I leave them different.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.740
Okay, so here's the next one.
 

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.782
Now this is -- if you look on
the left now,

00:10:02.782 --> 00:10:07.200
it's more clear where the nodes
are, that that's a d_xz

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.070
orbital.
 

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:14.042
The name 'xz' means that
the product of x and z appears

00:10:14.042 --> 00:10:16.097
in the wave function.
 

00:10:16.097 --> 00:10:16.980
Right?
 

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.558
So when both x and z are
positive, then the product is

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:25.308
positive;
on the top right, red. Right?

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:28.155
When x is negative,
and z is positive,

00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:30.232
the top left,
it's negative,

00:10:30.232 --> 00:10:32.080
the product of them.
 

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.690
So that's why it has the name
xz.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.398
Okay, and there's d_yz,
which you see on the right,

00:10:39.398 --> 00:10:40.960
turned ninety degrees.
 

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.562
And here's the d_z^2,
which is that thing that has a

00:10:44.562 --> 00:10:46.798
doughnut that goes around the
middle.

00:10:46.798 --> 00:10:47.419
Right?
 

00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:49.490
It's hard to see the doughnut.
 

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.049
Can you see?
 

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:51.340
It's blue on top.
 

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.370
You can easily see the red on
the top left,

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.039
which is what's blue in the
middle;

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:58.908
the sign has changed. Right?
 

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.509
But the doughnut is highly
distorted,

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:04.620
because as you go around,
first a proton on the top pulls

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.344
it up,
then a proton on the bottom

00:11:06.344 --> 00:11:07.629
pulls it down,
then up, down.

00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:11.306
So it's like a crown,
the doughnut has been made into

00:11:11.306 --> 00:11:15.053
a crown around the end,
by the protons pulling in that

00:11:15.053 --> 00:11:15.620
way.
 

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.360
Okay.
 

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.899
Then here's the 3p_z.
 

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:24.068
So it has the horizontal nodal
plane, but also it has a

00:11:24.068 --> 00:11:27.312
spherical node,
which you can see in either

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.779
picture really.
 

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:29.970
Okay?
 

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.168
Then here's the 3p _y
orbital,

00:11:32.168 --> 00:11:34.080
which again has that spherical
node,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.019
but now the planar node,
or approximately planar node,

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:39.509
is vertical instead of
horizontal.

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:43.969
So say on the top right there
you have red on the right and

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.428
blue on the left.
 

00:11:45.428 --> 00:11:49.346
There's a vertical node over
which it changes sign,

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:51.070
going right to left.
 

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.559
Or here's the 3_px.
 

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:59.976
Or here's the 3d_xy;
which you don't see so well

00:11:59.976 --> 00:12:02.460
here;
well, but if you turned it down

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.230
you would.
 

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.879
And here's the
3d_x^2-y^2;

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:08.996
which again,
to see it well,

00:12:08.996 --> 00:12:10.879
you'd have to turn it.
 

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:14.820
And here's the 4f
orbital.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.500
So you can see,
especially say in the top ones,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.566
compared with the atomic
orbital, that it's exactly the

00:12:21.566 --> 00:12:26.158
same general pattern of nodes,
slightly distorted.

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:29.775
And incidentally,
remember all the n

00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:32.360
equals whatever,
n=3;

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.629
all the orbitals had the same
energy before.

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:37.759
Now they don't have all the
same energy.

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:39.710
Notice that they all have
different energies.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.190
None of them are degenerate.
 

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.460
Why?
 

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.710
Because if you broke the
nucleus apart,

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.509
how stable a thing that has
that general shape,

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:52.389
like a dumbbell or a cloverleaf
or something,

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:57.779
how stable the electrons are in
those lumps depends on whether a

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:00.690
proton got pulled into the lump.
 

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.812
If there happens to be a proton
in the lump, where kinetic

00:13:03.812 --> 00:13:06.003
energy, the node pattern,
wants it to be,

00:13:06.003 --> 00:13:08.028
then that'll be unusually
stable.

00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:12.024
If the protons have been pulled
someplace where there is a node,

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:15.639
because of kinetic energy,
then it won't be stabilized.

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:19.975
So that breaks the degeneracy
of these different patterns that

00:13:19.975 --> 00:13:22.250
have the same number of nodes.
 

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.649
It depends on where the -- how
the potential energy changed.

00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:27.918
Okay, now just finally and very
quickly,

00:13:27.918 --> 00:13:30.210
I want to look at
1-flouoroethanol,

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.460
which is a molecule that would
have,

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.379
I think, no stability at all,
but you can put it into the --

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:36.923
as a practical matter,
you're never going to put it in

00:13:36.923 --> 00:13:38.841
a bottle,
but you can easily put it into

00:13:38.841 --> 00:13:41.477
the computer and calculate what
its molecular orbitals would

00:13:41.477 --> 00:13:42.058
look like.
 

00:13:42.058 --> 00:13:45.279
And I did it to show you
something that's very,

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:48.779
very unsymmetrical,
and has atoms of very different

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:50.110
nuclear charge.
 

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.940
Okay?
 

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.198
So what will the very,
very, very lowest orbital look

00:13:55.198 --> 00:13:58.230
like, do you think,
for this thing?

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.254
It has a fluorine,
an oxygen, two carbons and five

00:14:02.254 --> 00:14:03.240
hydrogens.
 

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.798
So what do you think?
 

00:14:04.798 --> 00:14:08.264
If you were an electron,
and you had that set of nuclei,

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.289
arranged this way,
where would you want to go?

00:14:11.289 --> 00:14:11.950
Elizabeth?
 

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.846
Student:  Very biased to
the left, especially around the

00:14:14.846 --> 00:14:15.360
fluorine.
 

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:15.956
Prof: Yes.
 

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.639
Now what would the very,
very, very lowest one?

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:21.437
It should be more toward the
left, and really close to the

00:14:21.437 --> 00:14:22.168
fluorine.
 

00:14:22.168 --> 00:14:25.254
It would be a 1s
orbital, and mostly on fluorine,

00:14:25.254 --> 00:14:27.721
because that's where most of
the protons are,

00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:29.629
the most concentrated protons.
 

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:30.480
So let's look.
 

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.320
There's a smaller scale ball
model,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.899
so that we can see really small
orbitals,

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:39.100
and there that's,
you're absolutely right,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.490
it's essentially the 1s
orbital of fluorine,

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.659
is the very lowest orbital.
 

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:47.769
What would be next?
 

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:50.240
Suppose this one,
you came up and this seat was

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.227
already taken,
now where would you go,

00:14:52.227 --> 00:14:53.409
the next electron?
 

00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:53.519
Zack?
 

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:54.178
Student:  Oxygen.
 

00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:57.557
Prof: To the oxygen,
because that's the next highest

00:14:57.557 --> 00:14:59.129
concentration of protons.
 

00:14:59.129 --> 00:15:02.700
And next?
 

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.889
Where will you go next?
 

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:05.668
Steve, what do you say?
 

00:15:05.668 --> 00:15:08.090
The 1s of fluorine is
taken.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.000
The 1s of oxygen is
taken.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.679
Where do we want to go next?
 

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:14.308
Pardon me?
 

00:15:14.308 --> 00:15:16.220
Student:  One of the
carbons.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.450
Prof: Ah, which carbon?
 

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.830
Student:  The left
carbon.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:20.940
Prof: Why?
 

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.696
Student:  Because it's
closer to the fluorine than the

00:15:23.696 --> 00:15:24.110
oxygen.
 

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:28.090
Prof: And what does the
proximity have to do with it?

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:33.658
The proximity means that the
electrons that are on that atom

00:15:33.658 --> 00:15:38.009
will have been drawn toward --
and we'll talk about this more

00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:40.269
later --
will have been drawn toward the

00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:41.769
fluorine and the oxygen.
 

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:44.976
Therefore that atom will have
fewer electrons,

00:15:44.976 --> 00:15:46.827
or lower electron density.
 

00:15:46.827 --> 00:15:47.470
Right?
 

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.440
Therefore, it's a better place
for other electrons to go.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:51.950
Okay?
 

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.243
So you'd expect the next one to
be the middle carbon.

00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:55.750
Right!
 

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.155
And finally,
of course, it's going to be the

00:15:58.155 --> 00:16:00.619
second carbon,
the one that's remote from the

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:03.250
electronegative,
high nuclear charge atoms.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.480
Okay, now we've done all the
1s's.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.573
So we can look at what's
interesting, the valence

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:11.278
orbitals, the ones that are
going to be involved in bonding;

00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:13.860
these don't have anything to do
with bonding.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.879
Okay, so there's the first one.
 

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:19.210
Russell, tell me something
about the shape of this?

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.509
Does it surprise you?
 

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:21.437
Student:  No.
 

00:16:21.437 --> 00:16:23.480
It's highly distorted towards
the fluorine.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.350
Prof: Yes,
it has no nodes;

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.340
except it actually has little
nodes down near the nucleus,

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.121
because it's actually more like
a 2s orbital in that

00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:34.308
respect,
because of the core electrons.

00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:37.538
So it has tiny nodes that we
don't see around the nuclei.

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:41.220
But it has no nodes within the
valence;

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.759
big orbitals that we're looking
at.

00:16:42.759 --> 00:16:44.798
So it's like an s
orbital.

00:16:44.798 --> 00:16:45.308
Right?
 

00:16:45.308 --> 00:16:48.952
And it's big where the nuclear
charge is big,

00:16:48.952 --> 00:16:50.029
as you say.
 

00:16:50.029 --> 00:16:51.330
Okay?
 

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:56.710
What's the next one going to
look like?

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.889
Any ideas?
 

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:02.889
Pardon me?
 

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:03.370
Student:  Towards the
oxygen.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.926
Prof: Toward the oxygen.
 

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:10.140
Will it also have no nodes?
 

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.333
No.
 

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:13.240
The next highest orbital has to
have a node.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.538
Where do you think the node
will be?

00:17:14.538 --> 00:17:17.579
What orbital will it look like,
sort of?

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.328
It'll be highly distorted.
 

00:17:19.328 --> 00:17:21.960
But what -- if this is the s
orbital, right?

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.180
What's going to be next?
 

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.450
Elizabeth?
 

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.250
Student:  It's as if
it's switched but with a planar

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.119
node in between.
 

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.839
Prof: Oh let's see.
 

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:34.338
Right!
 

00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:37.317
So the first one was -- you
were right Russell that this one

00:17:37.317 --> 00:17:38.630
should be big on oxygen.
 

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.490
But notice it's like a p
orbital, it has that horizontal

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.170
node, because it's higher
kinetic energy.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:45.690
Okay?
 

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.123
And then this one,
that's on the carbons,

00:17:49.123 --> 00:17:49.809
right?
 

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:50.380
Mostly.
 

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.038
But it's a p_y,
it has a vertical node.

00:17:54.038 --> 00:17:57.695
So it's negative say on the
fluorine and oxygen and positive

00:17:57.695 --> 00:17:58.750
on the carbons.
 

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.344
Or if we rotate this one around
a horizontal axis to look at it

00:18:02.344 --> 00:18:04.337
from the side,
it looks like that,

00:18:04.337 --> 00:18:07.309
and you can see that it's a
p_y kind of orbital.

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:08.009
Elizabeth?
 

00:18:08.009 --> 00:18:09.690
Student:  I'm just
asking a point of clarification.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.538
These aren't technically
p orbitals,

00:18:11.538 --> 00:18:11.890
right?
 

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.980
We're just saying they're
analogous to them.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.119
Prof: They're analogous
to p orbitals;

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:18.420
because it has to be the same.
 

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.363
The orbitals must go in order
of the number of nodes.

00:18:22.363 --> 00:18:22.970
Right?
 

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.410
So the same thing is in an atom
or in a molecule.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.170
You go from no nodes to one
node.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.924
And there are three ways of
getting one node:

00:18:29.924 --> 00:18:33.683
spherical or distorted sphere,
planes, or distorted planes if

00:18:33.683 --> 00:18:36.440
the nuclei are pulled around;
and so on.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.680
So they're really very much
like the atomic orbitals.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.170
Okay, or this one.
 

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.074
Now that's an interesting one
because that's like a hybrid

00:18:46.074 --> 00:18:46.759
orbital.
 

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:48.368
It looks like the orbital up
here.

00:18:48.368 --> 00:18:50.240
It's a mixture of s with
p.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.029
Did everybody see how that is?
 

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:55.286
It's a big sort of blue lobe on
the top and a small red one on

00:18:55.286 --> 00:18:55.980
the bottom.
 

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.630
And also the next one is the
other one,

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.720
the hybrid that points the
other direction,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.809
another combination of the
s and the p,

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.859
that points down.
 

00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:06.980
Okay?
 

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.619
And then this one looks like
d_xy again.

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:10.078
Right?
 

00:19:10.078 --> 00:19:14.470
It's sort of a cloverleaf with
two nodes.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.701
Okay, so that's all I want to
do with that,

00:19:16.701 --> 00:19:18.720
and we won't go any further
with it.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.808
This is just an interesting way
of looking at how --

00:19:21.808 --> 00:19:24.865
that molecular orbitals are
really just like atomic

00:19:24.865 --> 00:19:27.161
orbitals,
and have energies for the same

00:19:27.161 --> 00:19:28.993
reason,
except the potential energy

00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:31.874
gets screwed up by breaking the
nucleus and pulling pieces

00:19:31.874 --> 00:19:34.733
around,
but in an understandable way,

00:19:34.733 --> 00:19:38.308
and the nodes get distorted
because of this.

00:19:38.308 --> 00:19:43.126
Okay now, now we're getting
into really -- we just looked at

00:19:43.126 --> 00:19:46.720
this view, at the single united
atom view.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.737
But the other view is the one
that's going to be more

00:19:49.737 --> 00:19:52.116
generalizable,
and that's the one where we

00:19:52.116 --> 00:19:53.161
looked at bonding.
 

00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:53.798
Right?
 

00:19:53.798 --> 00:19:57.374
So you have to probe a little
harder to get a qualitative

00:19:57.374 --> 00:20:00.118
understanding of what chemical
bonds are.

00:20:00.118 --> 00:20:03.647
And that's what we're going to
do now by choosing a higher

00:20:03.647 --> 00:20:06.308
contour with which to look at a
molecule.

00:20:06.308 --> 00:20:10.647
Now, true molecular orbitals,
to the extent that orbitals are

00:20:10.647 --> 00:20:14.769
true all together -- why aren't
they true all together;

00:20:14.769 --> 00:20:18.880
why aren't orbitals true all
together?

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.358
Yes, Alex?
 

00:20:20.358 --> 00:20:21.640
Student:  Because you
have multiple electrons.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.740
Prof: Because you have
many electrons;

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.675
you can't have independent
electrons, you can't have

00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:26.308
orbitals.
 

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:29.048
But we're approximating things
by orbitals,

00:20:29.048 --> 00:20:32.130
trying to take electron
interaction into account in a

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.329
sort of a left-handed way by
Self-Consistent Field,

00:20:35.329 --> 00:20:36.420
or something like that.
 

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.605
Because it's much easier if we
can divide the whole into a

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.560
bunch of parts,
each of which we can

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.400
understand.
 

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.900
So, to the extent that
molecular orbitals are true --

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.358
the kinds of things I've just
been showing you,

00:20:46.358 --> 00:20:50.738
calculated with my laptop --
they extend over the whole

00:20:50.738 --> 00:20:54.358
molecule;
they're not local. Right?

00:20:54.358 --> 00:20:57.878
Except like the 1s of
fluorine was local,

00:20:57.878 --> 00:21:01.250
but mostly they go over the
whole molecule.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:05.230
But bonds are thought of,
and have always been thought

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.608
of, as interactions between
pairs of atoms.

00:21:08.608 --> 00:21:14.378
So we want to divide things
completely differently and look

00:21:14.378 --> 00:21:18.655
at the bonds now,
at pairwise LCAO molecular

00:21:18.655 --> 00:21:19.950
orbitals.
 

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.240
Now what's an LCAO?
 

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.032
It's a sum, or a linear
combination.

00:21:26.032 --> 00:21:26.900
Right?
 

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.220
A weighted sum of atomic
orbitals.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.460
So here's an example.
 

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.400
Î¨, which is an orbital --
what's it a function of?

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.690
Student:  Position.
 

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.650
Prof: Position of what?
 

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.269
Student:  One electron.
 

00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.940
Prof: One electron.
 

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.220
So it's a function of
x_1,y_1,z_1;

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.630
we're talking just about
electron one.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.644
So the wave function for
electron one we say is

00:21:46.644 --> 00:21:51.359
1/âˆš2 times one
atomic orbital plus another

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:52.669
atomic orbital.
 

00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:53.630
Right?
 

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:58.170
Now, have you ever seen adding
orbitals like that before?

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.960
That's what hybridization is;
we added s and p.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.877
But this is different,
because when we added s

00:22:04.877 --> 00:22:08.366
and p before,
they were on the same nucleus,

00:22:08.366 --> 00:22:12.248
and we did it to get a new
orbital for that particular

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:15.367
nucleus for that atom;
to distort it one way or the

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:17.300
other, for example,
or to rotate a p

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.669
orbital.
 

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:18.130
Right?
 

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.500
But this is very different,
because we're adding orbitals

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.325
that are on different
nuclei: A, nucleus A,

00:22:26.325 --> 00:22:27.730
and nucleus B.
 

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.598
See the difference?
 

00:22:30.598 --> 00:22:34.049
Adding is just -- wave
functions are numbers,

00:22:34.049 --> 00:22:36.088
we just add the numbers.
 

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:38.323
But in the first case,
hybridization,

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:41.240
those two functions were on the
same nucleus.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.464
Now they're on different
nuclei, what we're adding

00:22:44.464 --> 00:22:45.190
together.
 

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:50.266
Okay, now why is it sensible to
think that you might get

00:22:50.266 --> 00:22:55.990
pairwise molecular orbitals that
can be expressed like this?

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.750
How do you interpret an orbital?
 

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.990
Corey?
 

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.859
What good is an orbital?
 

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:03.710
What do you use it for?
 

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.318
Student:  It's a
one-electron wave function.

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:08.538
Prof: Well what do you
use it for?

00:23:08.538 --> 00:23:10.740
Student:  For
probability.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.108
Prof: And how do you get
probability?

00:23:14.108 --> 00:23:16.520
From the wave function -- if
you have the wave function,

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.319
how do you get the probability
density?

00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:19.019
Student:  You square it.
 

00:23:19.019 --> 00:23:20.108
Prof: You square it.
 

00:23:20.108 --> 00:23:25.278
So do you see why we have a
1/âˆš2 in this?

00:23:25.278 --> 00:23:28.843
Because when we square it,
that's going to be half,

00:23:28.843 --> 00:23:32.763
and we're going to get half of
atomic orbital A squared,

00:23:32.763 --> 00:23:35.329
and of atomic orbital B
squared;

00:23:35.329 --> 00:23:36.980
so it's a half of each of them.
 

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.049
That's why we have
1/âˆš2.

00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:40.650
So let's go on with this.
 

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.568
Suppose we have a hydrogen
molecule, and suppose that the

00:23:44.568 --> 00:23:48.068
nuclei are at a great distance
from one another.

00:23:48.068 --> 00:23:52.559
So far they don't interact,
or negligible interaction;

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:53.890
they're very far apart.
 

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:57.178
What would you expect the
lowest energy,

00:23:57.178 --> 00:24:00.720
one-electron wave function to
look like?

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.746
One possibility is that the
electron could sit exactly

00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:08.685
halfway between the two nuclei?
 

00:24:08.685 --> 00:24:09.538
Right?
 

00:24:09.538 --> 00:24:12.565
Is that a reasonable place,
is that the low energy place

00:24:12.565 --> 00:24:13.390
for it to be?
 

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.828
Lucas, what do you say?
 

00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:17.849
Student:  No,
because the added probability

00:24:17.849 --> 00:24:20.069
density there is not the
greatest.

00:24:20.069 --> 00:24:20.720
Prof: Why not?
 

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.430
Student:  It needs to be
one or the other.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.407
Prof: Why shouldn't the
electrons sit -- if the two

00:24:24.407 --> 00:24:27.171
nuclei are this far apart;
and I don't mean two angstroms

00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:30.753
apart, I mean two meters apart
-- there's a proton here and a

00:24:30.753 --> 00:24:31.650
proton here.
 

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.140
Is the electron most likely to
be here, halfway between?

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:35.838
Student:  No.
 

00:24:35.838 --> 00:24:37.269
Prof: Where would it be
most likely?

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:39.328
Student:  Probably
nearer to one of the two atoms.

00:24:39.328 --> 00:24:43.269
Prof: And which of the
two?

00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:44.538
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:24:44.538 --> 00:24:46.960
Prof: Suppose you took
the long view.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.480
Suppose you averaged it over
eighteen zillion millennia --

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.029
time averaged.
 

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:57.682
Sometimes it would be near this
one, sometimes it would be near

00:24:57.682 --> 00:24:58.329
this one.
 

00:24:58.329 --> 00:24:59.088
Okay?
 

00:24:59.088 --> 00:25:01.210
What would it be if you took a
really long view?

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.210
Student:  Both.
 

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.519
Prof: And half here,
and half here.

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:08.414
So the wave function,
when you square it,

00:25:08.414 --> 00:25:11.673
you want it to be half looking
like this atom,

00:25:11.673 --> 00:25:14.278
and half looking like this
atom.

00:25:14.278 --> 00:25:16.435
Then you see the time average.
 

00:25:16.435 --> 00:25:16.940
Right?
 

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.637
It might take a long time to
achieve that average,

00:25:19.637 --> 00:25:22.887
because it'd take a long time
for the electron to tunnel two

00:25:22.887 --> 00:25:23.880
meters, right?
 

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.111
But in the very,
very long time it would look

00:25:26.111 --> 00:25:26.720
like that.
 

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.710
So we know what we want it to
look like.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.618
What we want is that the
probability density,

00:25:31.618 --> 00:25:34.308
the square of this one-electron
wave function,

00:25:34.308 --> 00:25:38.032
should look half of the time
like the atomic orbital A

00:25:38.032 --> 00:25:42.318
squared and half of the time
like atomic orbital B squared.

00:25:42.318 --> 00:25:45.349
So on time average it's half of
one and half of the other.

00:25:45.349 --> 00:25:47.509
Everybody with me?
 

00:25:47.509 --> 00:25:49.529
So that's what the -- yes, Nate?
 

00:25:49.529 --> 00:25:54.650
Student:  Why isn't
there a 2A -- or a 2AB?

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.890
Prof: Oh,
because I'm telling you what it

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:57.509
looks like.
 

00:25:57.509 --> 00:26:00.327
It's got to look half like this
and half like this.

00:26:00.327 --> 00:26:00.778
Right?
 

00:26:00.778 --> 00:26:04.538
So the square of it has to be
this.

00:26:04.538 --> 00:26:08.238
So all we have to do to find
the wave function is what,

00:26:08.238 --> 00:26:10.430
if we know what its square is?
 

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.131
All we got to do is take the
square root and we've got the

00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:13.890
wave function.
 

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:14.809
Bingo!
 

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:20.170
There's the square root. Right?
 

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.150
So that is a reasonable way to
write the wave function,

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.746
1/âˆš2 (AO_A +
AO_B). Claire,

00:26:28.746 --> 00:26:30.960
you have a question.
 

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.951
Student:  From my small
understanding,

00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:37.486
with the math that I've got --
and this may be wrong,

00:26:37.486 --> 00:26:39.390
correct me if I'm wrong.
 

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.819
But don't you,
if you have a bracket and two

00:26:42.819 --> 00:26:46.171
things inside it,
you square outside of it,

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:50.240
don't you have four things that
come out of it.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.529
Prof: You want that?
 

00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:52.559
Student:  Yes.
 

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:53.650
&gt;
 

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.349
Prof: Okay,
now Claire you're going to help

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.029
me out.
 

00:26:58.029 --> 00:27:00.480
How big is -- that's a number.
 

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.566
It's the product of -- atomic
orbital A assigns numbers

00:27:04.566 --> 00:27:07.818
everywhere in space,
everywhere in space.

00:27:07.818 --> 00:27:11.269
Atomic orbital B assigns
numbers everywhere in space.

00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:14.974
So at some point in space
atomic orbital B assigns a

00:27:14.974 --> 00:27:18.390
number and atomic orbital A
assigns a number;

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.839
and A times B is the product of
those two numbers.

00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:25.960
How big is that product?
 

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.130
How big is atomic orbital A
here?

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.289
This, a meter away from the
proton?

00:27:32.289 --> 00:27:33.160
Student:  Not very big.
 

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.089
Prof: And how big is
atomic orbital B there?

00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:36.598
Student:  Not very big.
 

00:27:36.598 --> 00:27:39.660
Prof: Now how big is
atomic orbital A here?

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.779
Student:  Very big.
 

00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:42.781
Prof: Okay.
 

00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:49.569
So now, how big an error do we
make if we neglect A times B?

00:27:49.569 --> 00:27:51.000
Where do we make an error?
 

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.119
Do we make an error here?
 

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:54.720
Student:  No.
 

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.589
Prof: Do we make an
error here?

00:27:56.589 --> 00:27:57.058
Student:  No.
 

00:27:57.058 --> 00:27:58.079
Prof: Do we make an
error here?

00:27:58.079 --> 00:27:58.809
Student:  Yes.
 

00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:00.009
Prof: No!
 

00:28:00.009 --> 00:28:01.919
We make an error;
yes, sure enough,

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:03.019
we make an error.
 

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:04.759
How big is the error?
 

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:05.750
Student:  Not very big.
 

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.940
Prof: Ah,
it's negligible,

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.200
because it's at great distance.
 

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.519
Okay, so at great distance we
can forget that.

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:18.619
So now it's easier to take the
square root, right?

00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:19.970
Okay?
 

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.670
The old fox up here, huh?
 

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:26.028
&gt;
 

00:28:26.028 --> 00:28:29.949
Okay, now your problem
is what happens if H_2 is at the

00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:31.170
bonding distance?
 

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.220
What if they're only an
Angstrom apart?

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.690
Now there should be a problem,
because A times B is not going

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.788
to be negligible everywhere now.
 

00:28:42.788 --> 00:28:44.769
Okay, so now that's going to
come back.

00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:47.980
So now we got an error, right?
 

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.829
Or do we?
 

00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:52.588
Let's think what that does.
 

00:28:52.588 --> 00:28:57.362
Okay, so we if approximate the
molecular orbital as the sum of

00:28:57.362 --> 00:29:00.804
atomic orbitals,
this way, then it looks very

00:29:00.804 --> 00:29:02.759
good near the nuclei.
 

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:09.480
Because near A it looks like A;
near B it looks like B.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.080
And if we want to square it to
find the electron density,

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.150
we do this.
 

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:19.669
But if we then subtract,
what the atoms would give for

00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:21.288
electron density.
 

00:29:21.288 --> 00:29:25.373
Now what does this remind you
of, where we look at the total

00:29:25.373 --> 00:29:28.278
electron density and subtract
the atoms?

00:29:28.278 --> 00:29:29.180
Student:  Difference
density.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.123
Prof: So we're actually
looking for the difference

00:29:31.123 --> 00:29:31.470
density.
 

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.038
Everybody with me on this?
 

00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:37.153
So we're going to subtract the
atoms, which is ½A^2 and

00:29:37.153 --> 00:29:37.962
½B^2.
 

00:29:37.962 --> 00:29:38.569
Right?
 

00:29:38.569 --> 00:29:42.088
If we subtract, what do we get?
 

00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:45.470
What do we get for a difference
density?

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:49.150
We get A times B.
 

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.411
So we get the difference
electron density,

00:29:52.411 --> 00:29:54.480
which is due to overlap.
 

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.140
And what do I mean by overlap?
 

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.925
I mean that is only important
in regions where both of them

00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:02.576
have a finite value.
 

00:30:02.576 --> 00:30:03.318
Right?
 

00:30:03.318 --> 00:30:06.460
The product of A and B is
negligible if A is zero;

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.210
it's negligible if B is very,
very small.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:09.759
Right?
 

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:13.194
So it's only where they
overlap, the two functions have

00:30:13.194 --> 00:30:15.548
simultaneous values,
that you care.

00:30:15.548 --> 00:30:21.358
Okay, now that thing,
the thing that's the bonding,

00:30:21.358 --> 00:30:25.390
the difference density,
is really a byproduct --

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.868
that's a little bit of a pun
because it's a product --

00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:32.380
but it's a byproduct of
squaring the sum --

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.279
of what Claire didn't like
about it.

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:38.152
So the very thing you didn't
like is what's going to give

00:30:38.152 --> 00:30:39.950
rise to bonding density.
 

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:44.019
Isn't that neat?
 

00:30:44.019 --> 00:30:47.838
Okay, but notice that here
we're multiplying A times B.

00:30:47.838 --> 00:30:50.500
But this is a completely
different instance of

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.567
multiplying from what we had
before.

00:30:52.567 --> 00:30:53.160
Right?
 

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.596
Before we multiplied two
orbitals to try to get a

00:30:55.596 --> 00:30:57.068
two-electron wave function.
 

00:30:57.068 --> 00:31:00.032
This has nothing to do with
this, because both of these are

00:31:00.032 --> 00:31:03.743
functions of the same electron;
it's like one electron that

00:31:03.743 --> 00:31:05.318
we're squaring here.
 

00:31:05.318 --> 00:31:08.162
So this A times B,
this product,

00:31:08.162 --> 00:31:11.828
this overlap,
comes from the squaring.

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:15.119
It was when we squared it that
we got that.

00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:18.608
Okay?
 

00:31:18.608 --> 00:31:21.180
Now, because we have this extra
term,

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.338
we have not only
½(A^2+B^2),

00:31:24.338 --> 00:31:28.259
which would -- what's the
probability of A^2^( )summed

00:31:28.259 --> 00:31:30.401
over all space,
or integrated,

00:31:30.401 --> 00:31:31.559
if it's normalized?
 

00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:32.339
Students:  One.
 

00:31:32.339 --> 00:31:33.089
Prof: And this one?
 

00:31:33.089 --> 00:31:33.990
Students:  One.
 

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.559
Prof: And what's this
whole quantity?

00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:36.130
Students:  One.
 

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.618
Prof: One,
because of the half.

00:31:37.618 --> 00:31:40.711
But actually we've got it
bigger than that,

00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:43.583
because we added the overlap
term to it.

00:31:43.583 --> 00:31:44.318
Right?
 

00:31:44.318 --> 00:31:46.038
So it's actually not going to
be half;

00:31:46.038 --> 00:31:48.895
it'll have to be something a
little less than half,

00:31:48.895 --> 00:31:52.210
so that it'll sum up to one,
if we want to normalize it.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:52.750
Okay?
 

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.640
So there's going to be those
less than halves there.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.779
Okay.
 

00:31:56.779 --> 00:31:59.078
Now what does that do?
 

00:31:59.078 --> 00:32:01.390
That shifts electron density,
right?

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.479
We're taking electron density
away from where the nuclei are,

00:32:05.479 --> 00:32:08.272
from A^2 and B^2,
and where's the electron

00:32:08.272 --> 00:32:09.500
density going?
 

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.898
Because we're using less than
half to begin with,

00:32:12.898 --> 00:32:15.519
we're taking electron density
away.

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:18.817
There's going to be -- we're
subtracting more than was there

00:32:18.817 --> 00:32:19.767
at the beginning.
 

00:32:19.767 --> 00:32:20.269
Right?
 

00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:23.076
Which means that we're going to
have negative electron density

00:32:23.076 --> 00:32:24.180
in the difference map.
 

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.089
Electrons are going away from
the atoms.

00:32:26.089 --> 00:32:28.369
Where are they going to?
 

00:32:28.369 --> 00:32:29.720
Student:  Into it.
 

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.952
Prof: Into the region
where there's overlap.

00:32:31.952 --> 00:32:32.308
Right?
 

00:32:32.308 --> 00:32:36.450
So they go away from there,
into the overlap region.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.868
So this is just like what we
were seeing with X-ray.

00:32:39.868 --> 00:32:43.032
Okay, so that overlap,
the A times B term,

00:32:43.032 --> 00:32:45.039
is what creates bonding.
 

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:46.769
And we've seen this before.
 

00:32:46.769 --> 00:32:50.493
Remember when you have wells
far apart, the wave function is

00:32:50.493 --> 00:32:53.785
the sum of the two;
we saw this in one-dimension.

00:32:53.785 --> 00:32:54.259
Right?
 

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:56.174
But if they come close
together, you get a wave

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:58.743
function that looks like that,
which we looked before,

00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:01.028
just from the point of view of
the energy,

00:33:01.028 --> 00:33:03.528
and saw that that would
stabilize the particle,

00:33:03.528 --> 00:33:05.922
because it's got less
curvature, less kinetic energy.

00:33:05.922 --> 00:33:06.288
Right?
 

00:33:06.288 --> 00:33:10.741
But also the electron density
grows in the middle.

00:33:10.741 --> 00:33:11.470
Right?
 

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.816
So from the point of view of
the electron distribution,

00:33:15.816 --> 00:33:19.598
that was the glue holding the
atoms together.

00:33:19.598 --> 00:33:22.298
So it's held together,
both because the energy goes

00:33:22.298 --> 00:33:24.892
down and because you put this
glue in the middle,

00:33:24.892 --> 00:33:27.430
which is what causes the energy
to go down.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.150
Okay?
 

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:29.460
So that's bonding.
 

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.348
And remember we also had this.
 

00:33:31.348 --> 00:33:35.223
So as the energy went up in the
middle one, the energy is lower

00:33:35.223 --> 00:33:37.598
here than it was in the atoms
apart.

00:33:37.598 --> 00:33:41.865
So the nuclei push one another
apart now, without the glue in

00:33:41.865 --> 00:33:44.710
the middle, and that was
anti-bonding.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.567
So we've seen it before in
one-dimension,

00:33:46.567 --> 00:33:48.608
but it's true in
three-dimensions as well.

00:33:48.608 --> 00:33:50.180
Now let's think about this
again.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.779
So here's atom A.
 

00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:58.680
Now where is the square of that
function significant?

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.950
Is it significant there?
 

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.650
No.
 

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:04.990
Is it significant there?
 

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.849
Yes, it's a little bit
significant at least.

00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:09.889
How about there?
 

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.389
A little bit. Right?
 

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:13.480
Okay.
 

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.429
Now suppose we have another
atomic orbital there.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:23.610
Now, where is the product
significant, of A times B?

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.880
Okay?
 

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.150
So is the product A times B
significant there?

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.320
No.
 

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:39.460
Is it significant there?
 

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.989
Nick, what do you say?
 

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:41.829
Student:  No.
 

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:44.030
Prof: Why not?
 

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.820
Speak up.
 

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.099
Student:  It's very
small near A.

00:34:46.099 --> 00:34:47.130
Prof: What's very small?
 

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.110
Student:  The value of A.
 

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.018
Prof: No,
no.

00:34:50.018 --> 00:34:52.315
The value of A there is
something -- we said that

00:34:52.315 --> 00:34:55.090
before, when we were looking
only at A -- it's not very big

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.909
but there's a significant value.
 

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.630
But how about the product?
 

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.119
Josh?
 

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:00.230
Student:  The value of B
is very small.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.170
Prof: The value of B is
very small there.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.170
So the product is going to be
very small.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.719
How about there?
 

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:08.130
Student: There's going
to be a change.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.969
Prof: Ah,
now they're equal;

00:35:09.969 --> 00:35:11.630
halfway between they're equal.
 

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.983
So both of them are a little
bit small, but their product is

00:35:14.983 --> 00:35:16.007
still significant.
 

00:35:16.007 --> 00:35:16.518
Right?
 

00:35:16.518 --> 00:35:19.922
Only in this region,
where they overlap,

00:35:19.922 --> 00:35:22.539
is that product significant.
 

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:23.190
Okay.
 

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.784
So at the center,
notice that the number

00:35:25.784 --> 00:35:29.711
Î¨_A assigns and the
number Î¨_B assigns

00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:31.309
are the same number.
 

00:35:31.309 --> 00:35:35.525
So 2(Î¨_A Î¨_B) is
as large as

00:35:35.525 --> 00:35:40.143
(Î¨_A)^2+(Î¨_B)^2;
because Î¨_A times

00:35:40.143 --> 00:35:42.469
Î¨_B is the same as
(Î¨_A)^2.

00:35:42.469 --> 00:35:45.847
So the electron density is
nearly doubled in the middle

00:35:45.847 --> 00:35:49.539
from what it would've been if it
had just been two atoms.

00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:51.684
So that's the region of
significant overlap,

00:35:51.684 --> 00:35:53.280
and that's what we care about.
 

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.922
So the overlap integral,
summing this produc -- or

00:35:55.922 --> 00:35:59.320
integrating it -- over all that
space, that's a certain density.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:35:59.860
Right?
 

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.489
We squared in order to get
that.

00:36:01.489 --> 00:36:01.909
Right?
 

00:36:01.909 --> 00:36:03.920
That's part of the density.
 

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.130
So we sum that,
the density that comes from

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.271
that product,
over all space,

00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:12.559
and that's called the overlap
integral.

00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:15.992
If the atoms are very far
apart, the overlap integral is

00:36:15.992 --> 00:36:17.179
essentially zero.
 

00:36:17.179 --> 00:36:19.574
If the atoms are close
together, the overlap orbital

00:36:19.574 --> 00:36:23.447
will be finite,
and the better the -- the more

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:27.755
the orbitals overlap,
the bigger the overlap

00:36:27.755 --> 00:36:29.650
integral, obviously.
 

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:33.889
And that measures the net
change that arises on bonding,

00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:37.360
the difference density,
as we've just seen.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:42.320
Now let's look at some
theoretical examples here.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.240
So let's look at the total
electron density as calculated

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:52.338
for two -- adding two 1s
orbitals of hydrogen at the

00:36:52.338 --> 00:36:55.239
appropriate distance for H_2.
 

00:36:55.239 --> 00:36:57.894
This was this was done forty
years ago and published in the

00:36:57.894 --> 00:36:59.590
Israel Journal of
Chemistry.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.235
Okay now, and here's -- so on
the left we have the total

00:37:02.235 --> 00:37:04.639
electron density that you'd
calculate from that.

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:10.969
A very simple thing:
1/âˆš2(A+B).

00:37:10.969 --> 00:37:13.936
And you square it,
and you get the density,

00:37:13.936 --> 00:37:16.833
and that's the density,
contoured at 0.025

00:37:16.833 --> 00:37:20.579
electrons/cubic a_o,
the unit of distance.

00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:24.260
Okay, now, on the right is the
difference density.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:28.132
So from that thing on the left
we've subtracted the atomic

00:37:28.132 --> 00:37:30.920
orbital, the atomic electron
densities.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.380
And you see exactly what you
expect.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.400
It builds up in the middle,
where there's overlap,

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.190
and at the expense of the
atoms.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.849
Yes Russell?
 

00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:42.829
Student:  Shouldn't it
be H_2^+ ion?

00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:47.411
Prof: Oh,
I think it's the H_2_

00:37:47.411 --> 00:37:52.440
molecule,
I'm sure it's the H_2_.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.262
They aren't so
fantastically different,

00:37:55.262 --> 00:37:58.599
because the two electrons are
in the same orbital;

00:37:58.599 --> 00:38:00.219
two electrons can be in the
same orbital.

00:38:00.219 --> 00:38:02.059
So one'll be twice as big as
the other.

00:38:02.059 --> 00:38:04.260
Qualitatively they'll look very
similar.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.268
And I think this is the H_2
molecule;

00:38:06.268 --> 00:38:08.489
but it might be the ion,
I'm not sure.

00:38:08.489 --> 00:38:13.409
Okay, at any rate the contours
on the right are much smaller.

00:38:13.409 --> 00:38:16.650
Remember, difference density is
much smaller than total density.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:20.320
So what you see is that it's
contoured at 0.004.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.878
So you have one,
two, three, four,

00:38:22.878 --> 00:38:24.119
five contours.
 

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:26.655
So you get up,
in the middle,

00:38:26.655 --> 00:38:30.280
to 0.02 electrons per cubic
angstrom .

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.960
That's how much bonding has
changed things,

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.449
at the maximum.
 

00:38:35.449 --> 00:38:38.980
Okay, now the energy that's
calculated,

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.190
with this very,
very, very crude wave function,

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.621
just one half --
1/âˆš2 times the sum

00:38:45.621 --> 00:38:47.739
of the two atomic orbitals.
 

00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:54.019
The energy, you calculate that,
is 92.9% of the true energy.

00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:57.079
That's pretty darn good, right?
 

00:38:57.079 --> 00:39:01.014
But almost all of that energy
that you calculate was already

00:39:01.014 --> 00:39:03.150
present in the separate atoms.
 

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.530
We're not interested in the
energy of the separate atoms,

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.900
we're interested in how much it
changes when you make a bond,

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.050
which is a small difference
between large numbers.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:16.023
So it turns out that although
we're within 7% of the true

00:39:16.023 --> 00:39:18.664
total energy,
this simple model only

00:39:18.664 --> 00:39:22.632
calculates about 50% of the
change in energy that came from

00:39:22.632 --> 00:39:24.960
putting them together -- right?
 

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.329
-- which is much smaller.
 

00:39:28.329 --> 00:39:32.202
Okay, so high accuracy is
required to calculate a correct

00:39:32.202 --> 00:39:34.070
value of the bond energy.
 

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.510
This simple thing won't do it.
 

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.838
Well it's in the right
direction, you're halfway there,

00:39:38.838 --> 00:39:40.565
so it's a pretty good start.
 

00:39:40.565 --> 00:39:41.119
Right?
 

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:44.721
But to do the difference,
as in the same way you needed

00:39:44.721 --> 00:39:47.789
high precision to do X-ray
difference maps,

00:39:47.789 --> 00:39:49.610
you need better orbitals than
this,

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.730
if you want to calculate good
bond energies.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.829
So you need to make the
orbitals better.

00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:55.329
Okay?
 

00:39:55.329 --> 00:39:59.724
Now -- so but already we can
take heart that the very crudest

00:39:59.724 --> 00:40:03.894
model shows most,
52%, of the energy of the bond,

00:40:03.894 --> 00:40:08.434
and it shows the electron
density building up by 0.02

00:40:08.434 --> 00:40:11.489
electrons per cubic bohr radius.
 

00:40:11.489 --> 00:40:16.001
And what we saw qualitatively
was there was a shift from the

00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:19.059
atom to the bond,
of electron density.

00:40:19.059 --> 00:40:22.909
Okay, now we can adjust the
molecular orbital to get a

00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:25.889
better approximation of the true
thing.

00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:28.666
How will we know when we've
adjusted it and it's gotten

00:40:28.666 --> 00:40:29.130
better?
 

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.867
If we adjust it and get a
lower, calculate a lower average

00:40:32.867 --> 00:40:35.106
energy --
I should've said a lower

00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:37.965
average energy,
because if we don't have a true

00:40:37.965 --> 00:40:41.420
wave function we get different
values for the total energy;

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.565
the kinetic won't exactly
offset the potential as you move

00:40:44.565 --> 00:40:45.780
from place to place.
 

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.380
But if you get the lowest
average energy,

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.750
then that is,
by definition almost,

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:55.856
more realistic,
because you can easily prove

00:40:55.856 --> 00:41:00.920
that the true energy is the
lowest possible energy;

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.860
that makes a certain amount of
sense.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.639
The lowest possible calculated
energy is the true energy.

00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:10.699
So if you change your wave
function and get a lower average

00:41:10.699 --> 00:41:13.289
energy, you're closer to the
truth.

00:41:13.289 --> 00:41:14.018
Okay?
 

00:41:14.018 --> 00:41:17.429
That's called the Variational
Principle.

00:41:17.429 --> 00:41:22.409
Okay, so here we've changed the
form of the molecular orbital.

00:41:22.409 --> 00:41:23.730
And how did we change it?
 

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.289
What does a 1s orbital
look like?

00:41:26.289 --> 00:41:30.960
Kate, do you remember the form
for a 1s atomic orbital?

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.539
I can't hear.
 

00:41:31.539 --> 00:41:32.610
Student:  A sphere.
 

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.670
Prof: Angularly it's a
sphere.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.739
How does it change as you go
out, do you remember?

00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:41.260
How does it depend on
Ï ?

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.590
The same way they all depend on
Ï .

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.119
Anybody remember?
 

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:49.018
Prof: e^-Ï .
 

00:41:49.018 --> 00:41:52.159
So it falls off exponentially
at a certain rate.

00:41:52.159 --> 00:41:54.197
And that rate,
how fast it falls off,

00:41:54.197 --> 00:41:56.349
is determined by the nuclear
charge.

00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.869
Okay?
 

00:41:56.869 --> 00:42:01.507
Now one way to change that
shape would be change how fast

00:42:01.507 --> 00:42:02.583
it falls off.
 

00:42:02.583 --> 00:42:03.329
Right?
 

00:42:03.329 --> 00:42:05.449
It wouldn't be correct for the
atom anymore.

00:42:05.449 --> 00:42:07.940
We've already got the correct
solution for the atom.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.423
But we could change the shape
of the thing by changing how

00:42:11.423 --> 00:42:13.320
fast that exponent falls off.
 

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.391
And we could vary that,
in the molecule,

00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:21.880
using one half --
1/âˆš2(A+B).

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.706
But those A+B are no
longer true atomic functions,

00:42:24.706 --> 00:42:26.980
they're a little fatter,
a little skinnier.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:27.530
Okay?
 

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.257
And we can change how fat or
skinny it is,

00:42:30.257 --> 00:42:33.119
until we get the lowest
molecular energy.

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:36.989
See, that's a way you can vary
it and find the best value.

00:42:36.989 --> 00:42:40.210
And that's what was done here
to optimize the exponent.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.681
And now you get a total
electron density that looks

00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:44.659
essentially the same as it did
before.

00:42:44.659 --> 00:42:48.007
And if you look at the
difference density,

00:42:48.007 --> 00:42:51.030
how has it changed,
if you do this?

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:54.139
First, notice that the energy
got lower.

00:42:54.139 --> 00:42:58.518
We're now to 73% of the
lowering of the bond energy.

00:42:58.518 --> 00:43:00.820
So the total energy's gotten
lower, it's better.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:04.320
And how has the electron
density changed?

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.039
It got higher in the middle.
 

00:43:06.039 --> 00:43:09.592
Because what we did was spread
the exponent out a little bit,

00:43:09.592 --> 00:43:11.960
so you had more overlap in the
middle.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.369
Okay?
 

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:16.206
So this wouldn't have been good
for the single atom,

00:43:16.206 --> 00:43:18.820
to spread it out,
but it gives a better function

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:19.989
for the molecule.
 

00:43:19.989 --> 00:43:21.679
And it's still very,
very simple.

00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:25.677
And what you see it did is it
increases the bonding density

00:43:25.677 --> 00:43:27.539
and the bonding strength.
 

00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:30.320
You get a larger shift from the
atoms to the bond.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.847
Now, how else could you change
the shape of the atomic orbital

00:43:35.847 --> 00:43:39.018
in order to increase the
overlap;

00:43:39.018 --> 00:43:42.126
some way other than making a
single exponential and having it

00:43:42.126 --> 00:43:43.369
get fatter or thinner?
 

00:43:43.369 --> 00:43:44.699
Can you think of some other way?
 

00:43:44.699 --> 00:43:47.429
Here you have an atomic
orbital, a sphere,

00:43:47.429 --> 00:43:51.291
and you want to change its
shape so that it overlaps better

00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:51.956
over here.
 

00:43:51.956 --> 00:43:52.690
Right?
 

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:56.833
How could you change the shape
of an atomic orbital,

00:43:56.833 --> 00:44:00.001
without doing really gross
damage to it,

00:44:00.001 --> 00:44:04.469
making it a cube or something
like that, or a line?

00:44:04.469 --> 00:44:08.052
How could you change it so it
looked pretty much still like an

00:44:08.052 --> 00:44:10.755
atom did, has a lot of the
virtues of the atom,

00:44:10.755 --> 00:44:12.460
but is shifted over here?
 

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.949
Sam?
 

00:44:17.949 --> 00:44:18.610
I can't hear.
 

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.730
Student:  Can't you just
allow the electrons to shift?

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:22.851
Prof: Yes,
how am I going to write a

00:44:22.851 --> 00:44:25.324
function that allows the
electrons to shift in the

00:44:25.324 --> 00:44:26.789
direction I want them to?
 

00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:27.750
Lexy?
 

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.070
Student:  You could
hybridize it.

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.539
Prof: Hybridize it!
 

00:44:30.539 --> 00:44:32.420
We could hybridize to shift the
electrons.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.780
So that's the next one.
 

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.503
So here we're going to --
instead of this we're going to

00:44:37.503 --> 00:44:38.518
hybridize it.
 

00:44:38.518 --> 00:44:41.041
Now, this particular
calculation did the

00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:44.664
hybridization and also did a
little self-consistent field

00:44:44.664 --> 00:44:45.699
calculation.
 

00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:50.719
And the hybridization left it
96.7% 1s.

00:44:50.719 --> 00:44:53.940
So essentially it's still a
normal 1s orbital.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.480
But they added .6% of
2s, which expanded it a

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.367
little bit, because 2s is
-- goes further out than

00:45:01.367 --> 00:45:02.340
1s.
 

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.349
And they added 2.7% of
2p.

00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:10.550
Now why was 2p much more
helpful than 2s?

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:12.730
Lucas?
 

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.619
Student:  It has those
lobes.

00:45:14.619 --> 00:45:17.001
Prof: Yes,
so it takes density from one

00:45:17.001 --> 00:45:18.800
side and shifts it to the other.
 

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.570
In fact, this is precisely what
we saw before.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:29.186
Notice what it did was -- how
much it increased the density in

00:45:29.186 --> 00:45:30.809
the middle.
 

00:45:30.809 --> 00:45:33.429
And notice now,
it's not taking electron

00:45:33.429 --> 00:45:37.126
density away from the nuclei,
which was a good place for

00:45:37.126 --> 00:45:38.469
electrons to be.
 

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.349
Where does it take it away from?
 

00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:41.760
Student: The left one.
 

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.561
Prof: Out beyond the
nuclei, and shift it to the

00:45:44.561 --> 00:45:45.030
middle.
 

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:47.420
So even before,
when it was an atom --

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.679
here's the nucleus,
a certain distance out here,

00:45:50.679 --> 00:45:54.030
and a certain distance out
here, were the same in energy,

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.360
for that atom.
 

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.634
Now we've taken it from a place
which is -- out here,

00:45:59.634 --> 00:46:00.949
and put it here.
 

00:46:00.949 --> 00:46:01.690
Right?
 

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.639
Great idea.
 

00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:05.840
Well done Lexy.
 

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.780
So there's what it looked like.
 

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.170
Remember, if it's 100 percent
at 1s,

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:11.684
it looks like that,
and if you change it to be

00:46:11.684 --> 00:46:14.827
hybridized that way,
with Atom-in-a-Box,

00:46:14.827 --> 00:46:16.686
it looks like this.
 

00:46:16.686 --> 00:46:17.469
Right?
 

00:46:17.469 --> 00:46:20.759
It's not much shift,
but it shifts from the left to

00:46:20.759 --> 00:46:23.260
the right, and gives better
overlap.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:29.233
Okay, but it requires the atom
to be a little bit less happy as

00:46:29.233 --> 00:46:34.920
an atom, because it's partly
2s and 2p now.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.186
The electrons are further from
the nucleus, but you make up for

00:46:38.186 --> 00:46:39.820
that by having a better bond.
 

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.429
Okay, now notice that didn't
change the energy very much.

00:46:43.429 --> 00:46:46.820
It went from 73% to 76%. Right?
 

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.882
We were already about the right
energy, but it changed the

00:46:49.882 --> 00:46:52.300
density a lot,
to be what we want it to be.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.242
Okay, so there's a much bigger
shift, and it's now from beyond

00:46:57.242 --> 00:46:59.349
the nucleus into the bond.
 

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.079
Right?
 

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:04.268
And now we're going to do the
last thing.

00:47:04.268 --> 00:47:07.005
We've done SCF already,
but now you have to do a higher

00:47:07.005 --> 00:47:09.489
level calculation that'll do
correlation, take the

00:47:09.489 --> 00:47:11.820
correlation of the electrons
into account.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.641
And if you add some correlation
calculation to this,

00:47:16.641 --> 00:47:19.480
you now get 90% of the bond.
 

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.978
If you did complete
correlation, you'd get 100% of

00:47:21.978 --> 00:47:22.539
the bond.
 

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:27.445
What does it mean to do a
calculation with complete

00:47:27.445 --> 00:47:28.820
correlation?
 

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.900
It means you don't have an
error anymore,

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.980
you've used a really good
calculation.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.581
So already at this level,
that was done fifty years ago

00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:38.849
almost, you get 90% of the bond.
 

00:47:38.849 --> 00:47:42.143
And the bond density notice,
what about the electron

00:47:42.143 --> 00:47:42.789
density?
 

00:47:42.789 --> 00:47:44.130
Student:  No change.
 

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:45.570
Prof: It hasn't really
changed.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.757
All that happened was that the
electrons kept apart from one

00:47:48.757 --> 00:47:51.349
another, but the average density
was the same.

00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:53.849
So already, with just that
hybridization,

00:47:53.849 --> 00:47:58.150
we got very close to the truth
in electron distribution,

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:01.663
and three-quarters of the way
to the truth in how strong a

00:48:01.663 --> 00:48:02.280
bond is.
 

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.289
So not a bad approximation.
 

00:48:04.289 --> 00:48:06.181
So hybridization,
to give better overlap,

00:48:06.181 --> 00:48:07.079
is a great thing.
 

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:10.637
So the density wasn't changed,
but you got a much better

00:48:10.637 --> 00:48:11.219
energy.
 

00:48:11.219 --> 00:48:13.619
And how so?
 

00:48:13.619 --> 00:48:16.811
Because the electrons kept
apart from one another,

00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:18.699
when you allow correlation.
 

00:48:18.699 --> 00:48:23.210
Okay, so here's a pairwise
atomic orbital:

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:27.788
1/âˆš2(A+B);
and you can use hybridized

00:48:27.788 --> 00:48:28.280
orbitals.
 

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.856
And the virtues are it's very
easy to formulate and to

00:48:30.856 --> 00:48:31.489
understand.
 

00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:35.159
And it looks like atoms,
especially when you get down

00:48:35.159 --> 00:48:36.429
near the nuclei.
 

00:48:36.429 --> 00:48:39.516
And you don't want that to
change because that's the main

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:40.730
event for electrons.
 

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.193
You get much more energy
forming atoms,

00:48:43.193 --> 00:48:46.175
as we saw before,
than you do making new bonds,

00:48:46.175 --> 00:48:48.510
once you have the atoms
already.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.860
Okay.
 

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.518
It builds up electron density
between the nuclei,

00:48:52.518 --> 00:48:55.289
through overlap,
which is the source of bonding.

00:48:55.289 --> 00:49:00.630
It smoothes Î¨,
to lower the kinetic energy.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:04.190
And then there's a pedantic
footnote here that actually

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:07.159
there's a thing called the
Virial Theorem,

00:49:07.159 --> 00:49:09.230
which I'm not going to stress
you with,

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:12.469
but that little bit there,
it happens to be true.

00:49:12.469 --> 00:49:16.302
But still we have the proper
understanding of what's going

00:49:16.302 --> 00:49:16.639
on.
 

00:49:16.639 --> 00:49:20.505
Hybridizing AOs provides
flexibility that gives you

00:49:20.505 --> 00:49:21.820
better overlap.
 

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.043
And if you use all the H-like
Atomic Orbitals,

00:49:25.043 --> 00:49:28.985
you have perfect flexibility,
you can make any shape you

00:49:28.985 --> 00:49:29.630
want.
 

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:32.150
Okay, but we're going to keep
it simple,

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:35.929
use only 2s and
2p orbitals to hybridize,

00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:38.561
because that'll get you most of
the way there and it's much

00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:40.965
simpler,
rather than to try to mix

00:49:40.965 --> 00:49:43.480
5f orbitals into it also.
 

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.110
Okay, so that's great.
 

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:46.835
And when we square it,
we get this,

00:49:46.835 --> 00:49:49.219
which has the overlap part that
helps us out.

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:51.641
We have the atoms,
plus the bond,

00:49:51.641 --> 00:49:54.820
which is the overlap,
that product part.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:59.039
But we could've done the same
thing to get the same product,

00:49:59.039 --> 00:50:02.233
as far as the atoms go,
if we'd used a minus sign

00:50:02.233 --> 00:50:05.230
instead of a plus sign in
combining things;

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:08.545
although then we would've
changed the sign of the overlap

00:50:08.545 --> 00:50:09.019
thing.
 

00:50:09.019 --> 00:50:10.429
It would become minus.
 

00:50:10.429 --> 00:50:13.981
So we would change it from
being less than to being greater

00:50:13.981 --> 00:50:17.226
than, in order to have it be
normalized at the bottom.

00:50:17.226 --> 00:50:17.840
Right?
 

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.320
And that's the anti-bond.
 

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:24.030
So we get both the bond and the
anti-bond by doing this.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.922
And now we're going to go on,
next time, to overlap,

00:50:26.922 --> 00:50:29.985
which we've already introduced,
and also the concept of

00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:30.949
energy-match.
 

00:50:30.949 --> 00:50:33.434
And when you put these two
together, you'll really

00:50:33.434 --> 00:50:34.500
understand bonding.

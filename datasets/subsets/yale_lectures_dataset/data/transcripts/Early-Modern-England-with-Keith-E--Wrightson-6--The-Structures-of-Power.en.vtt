00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.197
Prof: Well,
today we turn to politics and

00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:08.770
the structures of power under
the early Tudors.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.480
On the 22nd of August 1485,
Henry Tudor,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.876
who was then the Earl of
Richmond, defeated and killed

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:22.190
King Richard III at the Battle
of Bosworth Field,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.902
a battlefield which is located
in central England in the county

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:28.995
of Leicestershire,
and was crowned upon the

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:33.890
battlefield with the crown which
was found in the King's tent,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.320
and became king as Henry VII.
 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.641
Now, in fact,
his claim to the throne was

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.970
somewhat weak.
 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.478
He was descended on his
father's side from the widow of

00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:51.869
King Henry V,
who had married Henry's

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.700
grandfather after the King's
death,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.840
but that didn't establish a
direct claim to the throne.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.966
His claim came principally
through his mother,

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.439
Lady Margaret Beaufort,
who was a descendant of the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.150
fourteenth-century king Edward
III.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.438
Nevertheless,
weak though his claim was,

00:01:09.438 --> 00:01:14.716
Henry was the last of the
claimants of the Lancastrian

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:20.691
House and he took the throne on
the behalf of that particular

00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:26.120
group in English politics,
which I'll explain later.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.099
In the twenty-four years
following his seizure of the

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:35.000
throne he made it his business
first of all to hang on to it,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.510
secondly to assert his
authority as best he could,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.300
and thirdly to pass on the
crown to his son,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.849
Henry VIII, who succeeded him
in 1509--

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.610
and by doing so he founded a
new dynasty,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.250
the Tudor dynasty.
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.013
Well, today I want to look at
some of the early stages of that

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:03.408
dynasty and in particular to
introduce the structures of

00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:07.296
political power and authority as
they were exercised under Henry

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:11.000
VII and in the early part of the
reign of Henry VIII,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.310
and by doing so to show how
they managed to establish and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.060
consolidate the new regime.
 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.098
Now by "power,"
of course,

00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:27.006
I mean that I'm concerned with
the capacity to secure

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:31.628
compliance and obedience on the
part of others.

00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:35.032
By "authority I mean
legitimate power:

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:39.895
those forms of power and its
manifestations which were deemed

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:43.264
by most,
if not all, people to be

00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:46.111
legitimate,
to be binding,

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:50.318
to put you under obligation to
obey.

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:54.311
There were many sources of such
power and authority:

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:57.598
economic, ideological,
political, military,

00:02:57.598 --> 00:02:58.930
and so forth.
 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.960
And to a considerable degree,
as we'll see,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.000
they all overlapped and
reinforced one another,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.742
but taken together they
comprised the polity of the time

00:03:10.742 --> 00:03:16.361
as contemporaries described it;
the polity, a system of

00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.340
established government and rule.
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.939
Now in approaching this kind of
subject it's currently

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.812
fashionable amongst political
historians of this period to

00:03:27.812 --> 00:03:32.025
speak of the need for what they
call a new political history as

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:35.490
distinct from the old
constitutional history.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.133
It's a central theme in John
Guy's book, The Tudor

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:43.479
Monarchy, from which
several of our key readings are

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:44.180
taken.
 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.342
By this people mean a political
history which is less narrowly

00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:52.780
focused upon the development of
the institutions of government.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.346
That was for a long time the
really central concern of

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:58.229
historians of this period.
 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.336
They were very focused on the
development of particular

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:02.199
institutions.
 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.306
Instead, now people are
recommending a concern instead

00:04:06.306 --> 00:04:10.954
with the changing contexts and
dynamics of political life and

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:15.990
in particular the social and
ideological context of politics.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.459
Well, I'm very sympathetic to
that shift of perspective.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.346
I can still remember only too
well the old constitutional

00:04:25.346 --> 00:04:27.439
history in its heyday.
 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:31.889
As a student I sat sometimes at
the feet of the great professor

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:32.319
G.R.
 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.716
Elton who was famous for
declaring that in getting to

00:04:35.716 --> 00:04:39.637
grips with the structures of
government it was essential that

00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:42.120
students should learn to be
bored.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.810
&gt;
 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.204
And when he could deliver a
whole lecture on one of the

00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:50.976
seals used in Tudor government
and the purposes for which the

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:54.702
seal was employed and so forth,
he was a man who sometimes

00:04:54.702 --> 00:04:57.629
practiced what he preached
&gt;

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:02.033
But even if the approach has
changed somewhat over the years

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:05.913
it's still essential that we do
get to grips with the

00:05:05.913 --> 00:05:09.644
institutions through which
government authority was

00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:10.838
exercised.
 

00:05:10.838 --> 00:05:15.675
They provided the forum for
political competition and they

00:05:15.675 --> 00:05:18.644
shaped the way
that--that--political

00:05:18.644 --> 00:05:21.189
competition was conducted.
 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:25.706
So historians today are very
much concerned with political

00:05:25.706 --> 00:05:26.500
culture.
 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.591
I've offered a definition of
that on your handout,

00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:32.810
but political culture involves
also institutions;

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.720
they're part of it.
 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.942
So we'll start by running over
some of the aspects of the

00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:43.391
institutional structure under
the early Tudors and then look

00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:48.065
at political society and then at
how political society could be

00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:52.137
animated and controlled and the
authority of government

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:56.511
sustained by the effective use
of all of these institutions

00:05:56.511 --> 00:05:59.000
under the early Tudors.
 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.230
Now the essential points about
some of these institutions are

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.875
laid out on your handout,
so I'll just quick march

00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:10.149
through some of them to briefly
introduce them.

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:10.682
Right.
 

00:06:10.682 --> 00:06:14.942
Well, in 1500 England was
already a very old and,

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:19.470
by the standards of the day,
a quite intensively and

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.399
uniformly governed monarchy.
 

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:29.059
It had existed as a single
monarchy for 600 to 700 years

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:30.269
already.
 

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:33.987
The origins of its high degree
of centralization probably go

00:06:33.987 --> 00:06:38.019
back to the late Saxon kings but
in particular to the time of the

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:42.180
Norman conquest of the eleventh
century and its consequences,

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.540
but that's not our business
today.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.607
Suffice to say that by 1500
many of the central institutions

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:52.744
of royal government were very
old and had been established by

00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:56.192
the initiatives of medieval
kings and reflected the

00:06:56.192 --> 00:06:59.983
relationships which they had
hammered out over time with

00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:01.569
their subjects.
 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:04.629
Above all with their most
powerful subjects,

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:09.478
the nobility,
those who served the king but

00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:16.291
could also on occasion oppose
him and had done so many times

00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:18.139
in the past.
 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:22.160
The king was of course at the
very center of the polity.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.281
He was described by one
sixteenth-century constitutional

00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.394
writer,
Sir Thomas Smith,

00:07:27.394 --> 00:07:32.591
as being "the life,
the head, and the authority of

00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:37.879
all things that be done in this
realm of England."

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:41.865
The principal functions of the
king were seen to be those of:

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:44.790
keeping the peace and defending
the realm;

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.110
maintaining the law and the
administration of justice;

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.418
and upholding the church:
a relatively limited set of

00:07:52.418 --> 00:07:55.899
functions compared to modern
government.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:59.302
And to achieve those ends the
king enjoyed a variety of

00:07:59.302 --> 00:07:59.870
powers.
 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.343
He enjoyed what were thought of
as his ordinary powers exercised

00:08:04.343 --> 00:08:09.180
within the framework of the law,
but in time of emergency he

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.233
might also exercise residual
absolute powers which could go

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:17.980
beyond the normal boundaries of
the law.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.833
Well, English kings already had
a very high notion of their

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:26.180
dignity and their sovereign
authority.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.649
From the fourteenth century
onwards they very often

00:08:29.649 --> 00:08:31.944
represented--
in the coinage--they were

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:34.605
represented wearing what's known
as the "imperial

00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:35.360
crown."
 

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:43.304
That's a crown which is
enclosed at the top usually with

00:08:43.304 --> 00:08:46.279
a cross;
an enclosed crown.

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:51.687
It was meant to symbolize the
fact that they recognized no

00:08:51.687 --> 00:08:56.428
authority higher than themselves
save God alone.

00:08:56.428 --> 00:09:00.711
And though the authority of the
pope was exercised within the

00:09:00.711 --> 00:09:04.191
kingdom over the church,
agreements which had been

00:09:04.191 --> 00:09:07.854
reached and statutes which had
been passed in the fourteenth

00:09:07.854 --> 00:09:11.517
century meant that in practice
in making appointments in the

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:15.365
church the pope usually acted on
the advice and in consultation

00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:16.668
with the king.
 

00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:20.389
They didn't override his
authority.

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:26.692
So a monarchy of considerable
dignity claiming a sovereignty

00:09:26.692 --> 00:09:30.538
represented in the imperial
crown.

00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:33.090
But high as the king's dignity
was,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.730
England was also,
as one contemporary jurist,

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.231
John Fortescue,
put it, a dominium

00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:45.488
politicum et regale--
he phrase is there on your

00:09:45.488 --> 00:09:48.307
handout--
which meant that royal

00:09:48.307 --> 00:09:52.472
authority was supreme--
that's the regale

00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:57.591
part--but it was also sustained
and restrained by certain

00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:03.922
political expectations,
certain constitutional

00:10:03.922 --> 00:10:06.379
institutions.
 

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:11.070
First, kings were expected to
take advice.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:17.782
They were expected to be guided
by counsel, by the counsel of

00:10:17.782 --> 00:10:20.580
their leading subjects.
 

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.808
They ruled with the advice of a
variety of councils.

00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:26.595
Occasionally,
a great council of the leading

00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:30.034
nobility could be called,
especially when advice and

00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:33.600
support was needed in the making
of some major decision.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.477
Henry VII called such councils
of his leading noblemen on a

00:10:37.477 --> 00:10:38.950
number of occasions.
 

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.058
More usually,
for day-to-day administration,

00:10:43.058 --> 00:10:46.996
the king was advised by a
smaller council which attended

00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:51.077
his person on a day-to-day basis
and handled the executive

00:10:51.077 --> 00:10:53.009
business of government.
 

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:58.793
Some of its members were great
noblemen, but very often their

00:10:58.793 --> 00:11:04.769
position in the council was one
which was largely honorific.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:08.514
They tended on the whole to
proffer their advice to the king

00:11:08.514 --> 00:11:12.195
informally and occasionally when
they were in attendance at

00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:12.830
court.
 

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.840
For the most part,
for example,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.594
Henry VII's day-to-day council
consisted in its principal

00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:22.080
members not of the great nobles
of the kingdom,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.288
but of great members of the
church,

00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:27.456
notably Cardinal John Morton,
who was one of his closest

00:11:27.456 --> 00:11:29.990
advisers in the early stages of
his rule,

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.365
and in addition a number of
lawyers and professional

00:11:34.365 --> 00:11:37.922
administrators,
those who are sometimes

00:11:37.922 --> 00:11:43.125
described as 'men of business',
the nucleus of a kind of royal

00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:44.129
bureaucracy.
 

00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:46.950
So the king was expected to
take counsel.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.421
In addition,
he was restrained by the law,

00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:54.399
the 'common law' of
England--described as common

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:58.210
because it extended over the
whole realm.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.950
The king's writ ran everywhere
in legal matters.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.399
The common law had grown up
over centuries by custom and by

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:08.320
precedent.
 

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.830
It was administered in the
king's name.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.220
All legal writs began with the
king's title.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.024
It was administered in his
name, though under normal

00:12:19.024 --> 00:12:24.865
circumstances he was expected to
operate within the constraints

00:12:24.865 --> 00:12:26.278
of the law.
 

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:29.190
The administration of the law,
the provision of justice,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.373
and the redress of grievances,
the means of settling disputes

00:12:33.373 --> 00:12:36.488
peacefully,
was one of the principal

00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:39.250
functions of royal government.
 

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.187
Occasionally,
the king might still sit

00:12:43.187 --> 00:12:45.529
himself in judgment.
 

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:49.743
One of the courts which became
most feared under Henry VII was

00:12:49.743 --> 00:12:52.230
the king's Court of Star
Chamber,

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.359
which met in a chamber of the
palace of Westminster which

00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:58.210
happened to be decorated on the
roof with stars,

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.200
the Star Chamber.
 

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.330
It was effectively the king's
council sitting as a law court

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.250
and the king might on occasion
be personally present,

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.792
but for the most part the
principal law courts operated

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.759
outside the royal household.
 

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.100
They sat permanently in
Westminster,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.178
in Westminster Hall that still
stands besides--

00:13:19.178 --> 00:13:22.835
beside--the houses of
Parliament, and they were

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:25.058
staffed by royal justices.
 

00:13:25.058 --> 00:13:27.129
The names of the principal
courts are on your handout.

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:29.798
There was a Court of King's
Bench which dealt principally

00:13:29.798 --> 00:13:33.149
with criminal matters,
the Court of Common Pleas which

00:13:33.149 --> 00:13:35.730
dealt principally with civil
cases,

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.917
and the Chancery,
the Court of the Lord

00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:41.350
Chancellor.
 

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.909
That court was a little unusual
in that it was not a common-law

00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:47.240
court;
it was a court of equity.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.230
Equity.
 

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.768
That meant that in cases where
the common law didn't provide a

00:13:52.768 --> 00:13:57.231
remedy principles of natural
justice might be administered by

00:13:57.231 --> 00:14:00.182
the chancellor,
and for that reason the

00:14:00.182 --> 00:14:03.110
chancellor was sometimes
described as being the

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.542
conscience of the king,
could provide a remedy based on

00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:11.480
natural justice when the common
law did not.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.360
Okay.
 

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.821
In addition to the central
courts, the king also exercised

00:14:16.821 --> 00:14:18.700
justice by commission.
 

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.619
Twice a year royal judges left
Westminster and went out to

00:14:23.619 --> 00:14:26.783
ride--
to literally ride--six circuits

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:31.491
going from county town to county
town where they heard cases

00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:34.527
arising--
civil cases and criminal cases

00:14:34.527 --> 00:14:36.460
arising--
in the provinces.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.318
Those were the assize courts,
the riding of circuits by royal

00:14:41.318 --> 00:14:42.210
justices.
 

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.636
And in addition the king
exercised justice through the

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.808
commission of the peace.
 

00:14:48.808 --> 00:14:52.208
In each county some leading
gentlemen were appointed as

00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:55.104
justices of the peace
commissioned to deal with

00:14:55.104 --> 00:14:57.485
crimes,
usually petty crimes,

00:14:57.485 --> 00:15:00.740
and other administrative
matters arising.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:06.150
They met in a court called
Quarter Sessions because it met

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.048
four times a year.
 

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:13.317
Counsel and law came together
in another great institution

00:15:13.317 --> 00:15:17.994
that must be mentioned,
Parliament: the periodic

00:15:17.994 --> 00:15:22.322
meeting of the king,
the nobility who had the right

00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:27.354
to sit in the House of Lords,
and representatives of the

00:15:27.354 --> 00:15:29.860
commons of the kingdom.
 

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.222
The House of Lords consisted of
the leading lay and church

00:15:34.222 --> 00:15:38.970
nobility of the realm summoned
by a personal writ to attend.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.676
In 1510 for example,
when Parliament met there were

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:47.048
100 of them, fifty laymen,
fifty great men of the church.

00:15:47.048 --> 00:15:51.527
The House of Commons consisted
of a gathering of two

00:15:51.527 --> 00:15:54.600
representatives for each
county--

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.846
they were known as the
"Knights of the

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:59.682
Shire"--
and two representatives from

00:15:59.682 --> 00:16:03.240
each city which had the
parliamentary franchise;

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.720
they were known as burgesses.
 

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.970
The city of London provided an
exception.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.830
It had four members because of
its size.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.817
Now theoretically the members
who came for the counties were

00:16:16.817 --> 00:16:21.551
elected by freeholders who had
land to the value of forty

00:16:21.551 --> 00:16:24.168
shillings,
though in fact contested

00:16:24.168 --> 00:16:25.629
elections were very rare.
 

00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:28.879
Generally, the elite of the
counties would get together and

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:31.794
choose from amongst their
numbers who would represent

00:16:31.794 --> 00:16:32.298
them.
 

00:16:32.298 --> 00:16:35.169
They were selected rather than
elected.

00:16:35.169 --> 00:16:37.879
The urban franchise might vary.
 

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:41.070
In some cities all householders
had the vote.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.445
In others the choice of a
member for Parliament was

00:16:45.445 --> 00:16:50.519
restricted to a small oligarchy
of the leading citizens.

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:55.138
Parliament, then,
represented the whole realm and

00:16:55.138 --> 00:16:59.658
it had two great functions,
long established.

00:16:59.658 --> 00:17:03.484
First of all,
only Parliament could make

00:17:03.484 --> 00:17:09.270
statutes: new laws which could
override or modify common law

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.348
custom.
 

00:17:10.348 --> 00:17:15.901
So the legislative sovereignty
of the realm lay in Parliament

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:20.156
where the king,
the lords and the commons acted

00:17:20.156 --> 00:17:21.358
together.
 

00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:24.068
Bills proposing new laws were
presented,

00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:28.664
they were read and debated in
each of the houses before being

00:17:28.664 --> 00:17:33.490
passed and passed on to the king
for his consent or his veto.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:38.817
Now if all that sounds rather
familiar, this is where it comes

00:17:38.817 --> 00:17:39.430
from.
 

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.707
Secondly, Parliament could
grant taxes, which from the

00:17:42.707 --> 00:17:46.788
fourteenth century required the
consent of the House of Commons.

00:17:46.788 --> 00:17:51.215
It was essential that the
Commons gave their consent to

00:17:51.215 --> 00:17:54.660
any tax bill passing through
Parliament.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.154
Okay.
 

00:17:55.154 --> 00:18:00.808
One last word on institutions
and that concerns finance.

00:18:00.808 --> 00:18:03.730
The king was expected to
"live of his own."

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.970
That's the phrase they used,
"to live of his own."

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:12.079
That meant he was expected to
live on the revenues of the

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:16.234
royal land holdings,
the customs dues and other dues

00:18:16.234 --> 00:18:20.078
which were due to him as feudal
overlord of the kingdom,

00:18:20.078 --> 00:18:24.585
and for all normal purposes
that should provide for all his

00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:25.440
expenses.
 

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.212
The collection and the
disbursement of royal revenues

00:18:29.212 --> 00:18:32.840
was handled by an institution
called the Exchequer,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.220
at Westminster.
 

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.897
At least that was so in theory
since some late medieval kings

00:18:37.897 --> 00:18:41.147
took to handling financial
business in a more intimate

00:18:41.147 --> 00:18:43.538
setting within their own
household.

00:18:43.538 --> 00:18:46.131
This was known as "chamber
finance,"

00:18:46.131 --> 00:18:49.528
because they would deal with
these matters in the king's own

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:50.910
lodgings or chamber.
 

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.933
Henry VII, who was a notorious
workaholic and also extremely

00:18:55.933 --> 00:19:01.256
tight in financial matters,
actually personally went over,

00:19:01.256 --> 00:19:06.605
checked and initialed every
page of the chamber accounts to

00:19:06.605 --> 00:19:09.650
check his financial situation.
 

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.130
Reliance on taxation was rare.
 

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.539
Taxes would be voted by
Parliament for extraordinary

00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:20.553
circumstances and would then be
collected and returned to the

00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:21.490
Exchequer.
 

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.828
So for the most part the king
lives of his own;

00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:29.180
periodically taxes would be
granted for special reasons.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.150
Okay.
 

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.430
That's a quick run through some
of the principal institutions of

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.759
day-to-day administration of
royal government,

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:41.828
but of course administration is
not synonymous with government.

00:19:41.828 --> 00:19:45.836
If we want to understand the
structures of power we need to

00:19:45.836 --> 00:19:49.981
look beyond this to the larger
political society within which

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:57.368
these institutions functioned,
or sometimes failed to function.

00:19:57.368 --> 00:20:03.402
Obviously, the monarch stood at
the head of the structure of

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:04.220
power.
 

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.553
This is still an age of
personal monarchy and the

00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:13.426
personalities of individual
monarchs colored and gave a

00:20:13.426 --> 00:20:17.400
particular texture to particular
reigns.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.381
Henry VII was a man who seems
by all accounts of him to have

00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:25.167
been of a cold,
somewhat detached,

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:28.630
calculative,
suspicious, temperament.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.125
His son, Henry VIII,
in contrast,

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:35.618
was energetic,
muscular, vain;

00:20:35.618 --> 00:20:41.262
a mixture of largesse on the
one hand but prone to bursts of

00:20:41.262 --> 00:20:45.971
terrifying wrath on the other,
and the personalities of

00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:49.980
different kings gave something
of the flavor to their reigns.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.171
Henry VII for example was only
twenty-eight when he won the

00:20:54.171 --> 00:20:56.048
crown at Bosworth Field.
 

00:20:56.048 --> 00:21:00.006
He was only fifty-two when he
died, and yet it's been said we

00:21:00.006 --> 00:21:02.380
never think of him as a young
man.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.809
His personality was such that
one doesn't think of him that

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:11.368
way, in contrast to his
flamboyant son,

00:21:11.368 --> 00:21:13.710
the young Henry VIII.
 

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.798
The various institutions of
government of course embodied

00:21:16.798 --> 00:21:18.509
the authority of the monarch.
 

00:21:18.509 --> 00:21:20.640
They gave stability and
continuity,

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.602
but the actual exercise of
power and the maintenance of the

00:21:24.602 --> 00:21:28.836
authority of government depended
very much upon the personality

00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:32.730
of the king and the way in which
the kings interacted with

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.598
various important groups of
people,

00:21:35.598 --> 00:21:40.190
communities of interest within
the realm.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.707
By 1500, there already existed
a relatively broad political

00:21:44.707 --> 00:21:48.835
society which was involved in
government in one way or

00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:49.769
another.
 

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:54.143
Most ranks of society down to
the principal citizens of the

00:21:54.143 --> 00:21:58.666
towns or even the leaders of
village society were involved in

00:21:58.666 --> 00:22:03.720
government in one way or another
except perhaps the very poor,

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.361
who were described by Sir
Thomas Smith as being born

00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:10.858
"to be ruled and not to
rule others."

00:22:10.858 --> 00:22:14.643
But of course if many people
participated in one way or

00:22:14.643 --> 00:22:18.916
another in the exercise of royal
power, some people mattered a

00:22:18.916 --> 00:22:21.160
great deal more than others.
 

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.843
And those who mattered most
were of course the nobility and

00:22:25.843 --> 00:22:28.507
the gentry and their
counterparts,

00:22:28.507 --> 00:22:30.930
the leaders of the church.
 

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.313
And the crucial relationship
within the whole structure of

00:22:34.313 --> 00:22:37.815
authority was that between the
king and his central officers

00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:41.019
and those members of the social
elites who governed the

00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:42.029
localities.
 

00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:47.140
It was those elites who
constituted the political nation

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.932
proper,
and when historians of this

00:22:49.932 --> 00:22:53.932
period talk about the political
nation it's primarily those

00:22:53.932 --> 00:22:56.140
people they're talking about.
 

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.365
The nobility were absolutely
vital in two very obvious ways

00:23:01.365 --> 00:23:03.890
which were interconnected.
 

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.288
First of all,
by virtue of their enormous

00:23:07.288 --> 00:23:12.980
landed possessions they were the
natural rulers of the provinces.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.828
Social power and political
power in the realm intersected.

00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:24.170
The Percy family,
the earls of Northumberland,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.875
held absolutely vast lands in
the north of England alongside

00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:31.328
the Scottish border where they
had the responsibility of

00:23:31.328 --> 00:23:34.029
defending the border against the
Scots.

00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:36.970
Indeed, they still hold them.
 

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:41.260
The--they virtually ruled that
part of the north from their

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.848
principal castles at Alnwick and
Warkworth, both of which still

00:23:45.848 --> 00:23:46.588
stand.
 

00:23:46.588 --> 00:23:49.778
If you've seen a Harry Potter
film, you've seen Alnwick

00:23:49.778 --> 00:23:50.308
Castle.
 

00:23:50.308 --> 00:23:54.380
It was used to shoot parts of
those movies.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.750
The Percys were based there and
it was said,

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.894
with only a little
exaggeration,

00:23:58.894 --> 00:24:02.353
that in that part of the
kingdom they "knew no

00:24:02.353 --> 00:24:04.358
prince but a Percy."
 

00:24:04.358 --> 00:24:09.461
Secondly, the powers of
lordship which were conferred by

00:24:09.461 --> 00:24:14.380
these great estates translated
into military power.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.019
The king had no standing army.
 

00:24:17.019 --> 00:24:21.303
Henry VII was unusual in that
he had a small group of royal

00:24:21.303 --> 00:24:25.440
guards permanently available,
the Yeomen of the Guard;

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.838
otherwise, though,
there was no standing army.

00:24:27.838 --> 00:24:32.346
In time of war the king relied
upon the nobility coming in to

00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:36.480
support him with their armed
retainers and servants,

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.519
and each great lord had his
'affinity' as it was called,

00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:46.199
his affinity of retainers:
men bound to his service by

00:24:46.199 --> 00:24:52.200
ties of personal loyalty and
often by formal contract.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:57.234
They wore his badge or his
livery and they were expected to

00:24:57.234 --> 00:24:59.838
follow him when called upon.
 

00:24:59.838 --> 00:25:03.369
People as humble as farm
tenants in some parts of the

00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:07.171
kingdom still had to keep a
horse and arms as part of the

00:25:07.171 --> 00:25:10.701
conditions of holding their
farms from the gentry and

00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:11.720
nobility.
 

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.328
In the north for example that
was commonly the case,

00:25:14.328 --> 00:25:17.290
and when called upon by the
earls of Northumberland or the

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.556
earls of Westmoreland,
who dominated what's now the

00:25:20.556 --> 00:25:23.818
Lake District,
they would come in,

00:25:23.818 --> 00:25:28.098
especially for service on the
border.

00:25:28.098 --> 00:25:31.666
To give one example of the
importance of the military power

00:25:31.666 --> 00:25:34.496
of the nobility:
in 1536 at the outbreak of the

00:25:34.496 --> 00:25:37.263
rebellion against the
Reformation known as the

00:25:37.263 --> 00:25:40.338
Pilgrimage of Grace the Earl of
Shrewsbury,

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:42.940
who was based in the north
Midlands,

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:50.430
was able to mobilize no fewer
than 3,000 men in only six days.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.670
The rebellion had broken out in
Yorkshire;

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.160
Shrewsbury was here.
 

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.853
The fact that he could mobilize
3,000 men so quickly was

00:25:57.853 --> 00:26:01.749
absolutely crucial because he
was able to move north and to

00:26:01.749 --> 00:26:06.051
halt the rebel advance,
to shadow the rebels until a

00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:09.338
larger royal force could be
mustered.

00:26:09.338 --> 00:26:12.817
In contrast,
his friend and former companion

00:26:12.817 --> 00:26:16.454
in arms, Lord Darcy,
based in South Yorkshire,

00:26:16.454 --> 00:26:20.578
sympathized with the rebels and
failed to move.

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:24.815
He sat on his hands for a while
and then eventually joined the

00:26:24.815 --> 00:26:25.440
rebels.
 

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.900
He should have been mustering
his troops to stop them.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.670
That's why such men were
crucial.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:35.366
Darcy didn't act because he was
out of sympathy with royal

00:26:35.366 --> 00:26:36.730
policy in religion.
 

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.730
Shrewsbury acted and saved the
day.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:43.470
Such men were vital.
 

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.987
Having said all of this,
I must be careful not to

00:26:46.987 --> 00:26:47.940
exaggerate.
 

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.748
The nobility were rich and
powerful but they didn't have

00:26:52.748 --> 00:26:57.993
fully independent jurisdictions
of their own where the king's

00:26:57.993 --> 00:27:00.180
authority didn't run.
 

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.550
Some of the great nobility of
continental Europe enjoyed that

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.450
kind of power.
 

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.759
So did some of those of
Scotland in this period.

00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:12.624
In England such jurisdictions
had existed in the past but they

00:27:12.624 --> 00:27:16.236
had mostly gradually fallen into
the crown's hand and been

00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:17.058
retained.
 

00:27:17.058 --> 00:27:20.281
As a result,
English nobles depended

00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:25.528
ultimately for their power upon
grants of royal office.

00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:30.750
Their local authority was
granted to them by the king.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.548
King Edward IV,
who ruled between 1461 and

00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:39.644
1483, had ruled very largely by
parceling out spheres of

00:27:39.644 --> 00:27:42.980
influence to the great nobility.
 

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.250
His system of government has
been described as being somewhat

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.519
like the mob in the way that
each of the great nobles had his

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:54.509
quasi-independent sphere of
influence.

00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:57.690
But that was an anomalous
situation.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:03.450
For the most part the nobles
depended upon royal authority

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.368
formally granted.
 

00:28:05.368 --> 00:28:10.934
Nevertheless,
they still mattered a great

00:28:10.934 --> 00:28:11.910
deal.
 

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.288
Maintaining authority over them
was absolutely vital.

00:28:15.288 --> 00:28:16.730
In the middle of the fifteenth
century,

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:21.898
King Henry VI had failed to do
so, leading first of all to

00:28:21.898 --> 00:28:27.522
rivalry and factionalism amongst
his nobles and eventually to a

00:28:27.522 --> 00:28:31.069
bid by one of them,
the Duke of York,

00:28:31.069 --> 00:28:36.150
to overthrow him because York
had a rival claim to the throne.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:41.367
That led to the on-and-off
civil wars which ran between

00:28:41.367 --> 00:28:47.068
1450 and 1485 usually described
as the Wars of the Roses.

00:28:47.068 --> 00:28:51.412
Now the feuding of the
fifteenth-century Wars of the

00:28:51.412 --> 00:28:56.180
Roses had taken out a number of
exceptionally over-mighty

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:01.115
subjects amongst the nobility,
but in the reign of Henry VII

00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:05.299
there were still a dozen or so
who really mattered and not just

00:29:05.299 --> 00:29:08.269
in the north or along the Welsh
borders,

00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:11.467
which were areas of insecurity,
but in the very heart of the

00:29:11.467 --> 00:29:12.009
kingdom.
 

00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:15.413
In East Anglia the dukes or
Norfolk, the Howards,

00:29:15.413 --> 00:29:16.618
were paramount.
 

00:29:16.618 --> 00:29:19.980
In Kent, Lord Abergavenny was
paramount.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.054
In the west,
the Marquis of Exeter,

00:29:23.054 --> 00:29:26.490
the Courtney family,
were paramount.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.970
They still nurtured their
affinities of retainers,

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.450
they still enjoyed great
prestige as regional leaders,

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:37.835
and they still adhered to an
aristocratic code that certainly

00:29:37.835 --> 00:29:43.338
stressed loyalty,
honor and service to the king.

00:29:43.338 --> 00:29:45.828
But nonetheless they could be
very haughty,

00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:49.538
very touchy,
they assumed their right to

00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:51.820
rule,
they assumed their right to be

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.089
consulted,
and they could be very

00:29:54.089 --> 00:29:57.108
dangerous indeed if they were
slighted.

00:29:57.108 --> 00:30:02.036
No Tudor king was ever likely
to forget that in 1485 at the

00:30:02.036 --> 00:30:05.798
Battle of Bosworth the Stanleys,
William Stanley,

00:30:05.798 --> 00:30:08.330
Lord Derby, and his brother,
Thomas Stanley,

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:12.465
brought their forces and then
sat on the hill waiting to see

00:30:12.465 --> 00:30:15.690
which way the battle between the
claimant,

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:20.430
Henry Tudor,
and King Richard III would go.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.372
When they decided that it
looked like Tudor was gaining

00:30:24.372 --> 00:30:28.898
the upper hand they joined in on
his side leading ultimately to

00:30:28.898 --> 00:30:33.279
the death of Richard III in a
desperate last charge to try to

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.740
break through.
 

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.987
That's what had happened on the
day that Henry came to the

00:30:37.987 --> 00:30:38.500
throne.
 

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.903
He was unlikely to forget that
in his dealings with his

00:30:42.903 --> 00:30:43.798
nobility.
 

00:30:43.798 --> 00:30:46.586
So then, how did the early
Tudors handle their

00:30:46.586 --> 00:30:50.363
relationships with the various
institutions and groups on whom

00:30:50.363 --> 00:30:53.150
the effectiveness of their rule
depended?

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:57.150
I think one can suggest four
ways.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:01.000
They did it by propaganda,
by patronage,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.458
by consultation and,
when necessary,

00:31:04.458 --> 00:31:06.730
by simple coercion.
 

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.622
Two P's, two C's:
propaganda, patronage,

00:31:11.622 --> 00:31:15.259
consultation,
and coercion.

00:31:15.259 --> 00:31:18.924
At this point in time,
propaganda was perhaps the

00:31:18.924 --> 00:31:23.430
least important of the four but
it was not insignificant.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:28.813
Great stress was laid in royal
proclamations and ceremonial and

00:31:28.813 --> 00:31:33.588
symbolism upon the divine nature
of royal authority,

00:31:33.588 --> 00:31:38.192
on the fact that the king was
ordained by God and his subjects

00:31:38.192 --> 00:31:40.910
had a religious duty of
obedience.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:45.666
Henry VII was very careful
early in his reign to obtain the

00:31:45.666 --> 00:31:47.798
recognition of the pope.
 

00:31:47.798 --> 00:31:51.345
He further bolstered his claim
to the crown by marrying the

00:31:51.345 --> 00:31:54.640
daughter of his predecessor,
King Edward IV,

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.710
uniting the houses of Lancaster
and York through that marriage,

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.019
adding to his legitimacy.
 

00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:07.086
From the reign of Henry VII
onwards into the reign of his

00:32:07.086 --> 00:32:09.773
son,
the past, the public memory of

00:32:09.773 --> 00:32:12.871
the past,
was to some extent remodeled

00:32:12.871 --> 00:32:17.694
into an exaggerated picture of
the horrors which had attended

00:32:17.694 --> 00:32:22.598
the breakdown of royal authority
in the Wars of the Roses.

00:32:22.598 --> 00:32:26.497
They elaborated the myth of
Richard III as a kind of monster

00:32:26.497 --> 00:32:26.960
king.
 

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.266
I mean, true enough he was no
sweetie, but he was not the

00:32:31.266 --> 00:32:35.724
crook-backed monster portrayed
for example in Shakespeare's

00:32:35.724 --> 00:32:37.108
history plays.
 

00:32:37.108 --> 00:32:41.194
Historians were commissioned to
write appropriate histories

00:32:41.194 --> 00:32:43.450
celebrating the Tudor dynasty.
 

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.483
Polydore Vergil,
an Italian humanist,

00:32:45.483 --> 00:32:48.140
was brought in to write one
history in Latin.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.476
Edward Hall produced another
history in English entitled

00:32:51.476 --> 00:32:54.874
The Union of the Illustrious
Families of Lancaster and

00:32:54.874 --> 00:32:59.058
York, which sustained
the Tudors' claim to the throne.

00:32:59.058 --> 00:33:03.848
Shakespeare's history plays of
course reflect very much this

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:06.608
Tudor interpretation of history.
 

00:33:06.608 --> 00:33:10.887
The image of royalty was
cultivated in a kind of theater

00:33:10.887 --> 00:33:11.900
of majesty.
 

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.882
Tight as he was with his
finances, Henry VII never forgot

00:33:15.882 --> 00:33:19.934
the importance of having a
magnificent court and sumptuous

00:33:19.934 --> 00:33:20.858
clothing.
 

00:33:20.858 --> 00:33:24.460
The pageantry of the court was
magnificent.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.798
Great tournaments were held.
 

00:33:26.798 --> 00:33:31.566
Great buildings were erected,
perhaps the greatest of which,

00:33:31.566 --> 00:33:35.525
Henry VII's chapel at
Westminster Abbey where he's

00:33:35.525 --> 00:33:38.029
buried, still stands today.
 

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:42.901
Under the reign of Henry VIII
portraiture, royal portraiture,

00:33:42.901 --> 00:33:46.880
began to emerge as a means of
royal propaganda.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.086
Henry VIII always had himself
represented as something more

00:33:51.086 --> 00:33:52.029
than human.
 

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:55.933
In the National Portrait
Gallery in London you can see

00:33:55.933 --> 00:34:00.501
the cartoon which survives of a
great painting of Henry and the

00:34:00.501 --> 00:34:04.480
Tudor line which was once on the
walls of his palace of

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.660
Whitehall.
 

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.634
Henry himself is shown much
larger than life size,

00:34:09.634 --> 00:34:12.230
dwarfing all those around him.
 

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:17.838
He was indeed a big man but
he's represented as even larger

00:34:17.838 --> 00:34:19.000
than life.
 

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.677
You are probably familiar with
the Holbein portraits of Henry

00:34:23.677 --> 00:34:27.731
standing, arms on hips,
gigantic shoulders padded out

00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:29.369
with his doublet.
 

00:34:29.369 --> 00:34:33.905
That kind of image of the king
is the one that dominates our

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:37.902
memory and it was meant to
dominate those who saw his

00:34:37.902 --> 00:34:38.980
portraits.
 

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.554
It's an image that is so
familiar to people in England

00:34:41.554 --> 00:34:43.739
that it was actually used to
sell potato chips

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:45.099
&gt;
 

00:34:45.099 --> 00:34:46.460
a few years ago.
 

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.106
There was a brand of potato
chips--they're no longer sold so

00:34:51.106 --> 00:34:54.413
this is not product
placement--called Tudor

00:34:54.413 --> 00:34:57.800
Crisps--we call them crisps in
England.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.829
Henry VIII on the packet
glowering out as you had your

00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:02.969
potato chips.
 

00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:05.630
Of course, he was a king known
for his hearty eating.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.329
&gt;
 

00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:11.300
The nobles themselves of course
imitated all of this.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.000
The theater of the great
extended to them.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.956
Take a look in the Yale gallery
of British art where you'll see

00:35:17.956 --> 00:35:20.161
some of--
well, we'll go there later in

00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:22.750
the term to look at some of the
power portraits,

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.951
as they're called:
the calm, proud faces of these

00:35:26.951 --> 00:35:30.190
people staring down from the
walls.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.394
Well, the main impact of
portraiture and so forth was on

00:35:33.394 --> 00:35:35.610
the members of the elite
themselves.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.601
They were the ones who were
likely to see these paintings,

00:35:38.601 --> 00:35:41.280
but for a larger audience there
were processions;

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.465
there were royal progresses
where the king would travel

00:35:44.465 --> 00:35:47.827
around an area in a magnificent
procession, staying in the

00:35:47.827 --> 00:35:50.010
houses of his principal
subjects.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:55.911
There were royal entries to the
cities accompanied by great

00:35:55.911 --> 00:36:00.387
ritual, pageants,
display, and everywhere the

00:36:00.387 --> 00:36:03.440
royal badge was displayed.
 

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.101
It's an interesting topic,
the politics of display,

00:36:06.101 --> 00:36:09.242
the art and architecture of
power, and a great deal has been

00:36:09.242 --> 00:36:10.360
written about it.
 

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.469
If it interests you,
I can recommend some reading.

00:36:15.469 --> 00:36:19.559
Rather more significant than
propaganda of this type,

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:22.474
and in fact vitally
significant, was the use of

00:36:22.474 --> 00:36:25.496
patronage,
the exercise of what they

00:36:25.496 --> 00:36:27.429
called good lordship.
 

00:36:27.429 --> 00:36:32.231
That involved the conferring on
significant subjects of honors

00:36:32.231 --> 00:36:36.402
and prestige and material
benefits in return for their

00:36:36.402 --> 00:36:37.820
loyal service.
 

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.746
After all, the interests of the
king and his great subjects were

00:36:41.746 --> 00:36:42.619
not opposed.
 

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:46.800
The system ideally could be
utilized to the advantage of

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.742
both,
and so from Henry VII onwards

00:36:49.742 --> 00:36:54.329
the Tudors were careful to build
up their own affinity,

00:36:54.329 --> 00:36:57.739
their own loyal retainers.
 

00:36:57.739 --> 00:37:00.599
Royal lands were used to this
end.

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:03.353
Those who had shown their
loyalty and who were trusted

00:37:03.353 --> 00:37:06.472
would be granted stewardships of
royal lands where they would

00:37:06.472 --> 00:37:08.760
share in the profits:
favorable leases,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.480
the constableships of castles,
offices of profit,

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.791
and of course grants of local
authority which demonstrated the

00:37:18.791 --> 00:37:24.014
king's trust and which conferred
honor and power within their

00:37:24.014 --> 00:37:26.539
localities of prominence.
 

00:37:26.539 --> 00:37:30.382
All of this was not only to the
personal benefit of the

00:37:30.382 --> 00:37:34.367
individual noble but it also
enabled such men to dispense

00:37:34.367 --> 00:37:38.210
patronage themselves downwards
to their own clients and

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:39.349
retainers.
 

00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:44.409
It enabled them to maintain
their own affinities and

00:37:44.409 --> 00:37:46.989
enhanced their standing.
 

00:37:46.989 --> 00:37:51.867
The Tudor kings had no
objection to building up

00:37:51.867 --> 00:37:57.699
powerful men of this kind so
long as they were loyal.

00:37:57.699 --> 00:38:00.760
But ideally patronage should be
spread around;

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:06.561
it should be dispensed
judiciously in a way that would

00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:12.909
maximize the community of
interest in obeying the crown.

00:38:12.909 --> 00:38:15.380
Let's look now at consultation.
 

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:20.309
The royal court was the very
center of the patronage system.

00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:25.297
Access to the king was vital,
and those who could control

00:38:25.297 --> 00:38:30.018
access to the king were in
positions of real power.

00:38:30.018 --> 00:38:33.695
Under the young Henry VIII,
the gentlemen of the privy

00:38:33.695 --> 00:38:36.811
chamber,
his personal companions,

00:38:36.811 --> 00:38:42.789
those who hunted and engaged in
other sports with the king,

00:38:42.789 --> 00:38:49.070
were absolutely central figures
in gaining access to the king,

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.449
principal amongst them the
groom of the stool,

00:38:52.449 --> 00:38:54.099
an office which still exists.
 

00:38:54.099 --> 00:38:58.150
In Henry's day the groom of the
stool literally looked after the

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.199
king's chamber pot and brought
it for him when it was needed.

00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:07.014
These were people in an
excellent position to drop names

00:39:07.014 --> 00:39:08.940
into the king's ear.
 

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:13.324
But the court was also vital to
the business of consultation

00:39:13.324 --> 00:39:14.440
more broadly.
 

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.061
Any person of significance was
expected to visit the court from

00:39:18.061 --> 00:39:20.458
time to time,
and when they were there the

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.619
king could be quite
approachable.

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:25.150
Henry VII was quite famously
approachable.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:29.293
He let people pop into the
privy chamber where he conducted

00:39:29.293 --> 00:39:30.079
business.
 

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:33.813
Henry VIII was famously
affable, something of a

00:39:33.813 --> 00:39:38.280
back-slapping hearty type when
he was in a good mood.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.650
Nobles in particular expected
that kind of personal access.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:45.094
They expected to be able to
give their counsel informally on

00:39:45.094 --> 00:39:46.320
matters of concern.
 

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.409
They weren't part of the
regular executive,

00:39:48.409 --> 00:39:51.389
their main duties lay out in
their countries,

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:55.186
but they did expect to visit
for part of the year and have

00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:57.320
that kind of personal contact.
 

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.931
More broadly,
the regular executive council

00:39:59.931 --> 00:40:03.476
was a point of contact with
these members of the political

00:40:03.476 --> 00:40:04.159
nation.
 

00:40:04.159 --> 00:40:06.309
It received letters and
dispatched them.

00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:10.820
It expressed the king's
gracious thanks for good

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.780
service.
 

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.952
It handled all kinds of
business brought to its

00:40:14.952 --> 00:40:15.780
attention.
 

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.195
And then of course there was
Parliament, the greatest

00:40:19.195 --> 00:40:23.775
occasion of consultation;
the whole political nation

00:40:23.775 --> 00:40:26.690
gathered in common action.
 

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:30.510
Sir Thomas Smith said that
"every Englishman is

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:34.780
intended to be there present,
either in person or by...

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.230
attorney from the prince...
 

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.989
to the lowest person...
 

00:40:38.989 --> 00:40:43.985
And the consent of the
Parliament is taken to be every

00:40:43.985 --> 00:40:46.059
man's consent."
 

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:49.586
The king, however,
only called Parliament when he

00:40:49.586 --> 00:40:52.380
needed money or new laws or
support.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.994
Before 1529,
the early Tudors called it only

00:40:55.994 --> 00:40:59.786
occasionally,
but then from 1529 to 1559 in

00:40:59.786 --> 00:41:04.512
the crisis of the Reformation
there were only eight years

00:41:04.512 --> 00:41:09.829
without a parliamentary session
and it grew in significance as a

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:13.460
regular part of the political
process.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.987
The Tudor kings usually got
what they wanted from parliament

00:41:16.987 --> 00:41:19.559
but they did it by managing it
carefully.

00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:22.789
Its compliance could never be
simply taken for granted.

00:41:22.789 --> 00:41:25.704
It had to be managed,
and it was a genuine forum of

00:41:25.704 --> 00:41:26.230
debate.
 

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.380
The Speaker of the House of
Commons,

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.090
who controlled the agenda,
was granted at the beginning of

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.889
each session the liberty of free
speech,

00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:38.510
so that he could speak openly
to the king,

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:42.771
and by 1547 that liberty had
been extended to every member of

00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:47.320
Parliament within the precincts
of the meetings of Parliament.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.735
They could address any issue
openly for the good of the

00:41:51.735 --> 00:41:54.190
prince and the commonwealth.
 

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.340
And these members in their turn
got what they wanted.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.458
Government bills might be
amended in the light of their

00:42:01.458 --> 00:42:05.655
local experience and a great
deal of private legislation

00:42:05.655 --> 00:42:09.469
intended for particular
localities was passed.

00:42:09.469 --> 00:42:13.188
So, Parliament as a place of
consultation was a very

00:42:13.188 --> 00:42:16.688
significant forum for the
resolution of potential

00:42:16.688 --> 00:42:19.411
conflict,
for the presenting of royal

00:42:19.411 --> 00:42:22.309
policy and its explanation and
justification.

00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:26.210
The Tudors used it very
carefully to achieve their ends.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.894
In fact, on one occasion Henry
VIII flattered it by saying that

00:42:30.894 --> 00:42:34.976
his royal dignity was never so
high as when he met with

00:42:34.976 --> 00:42:36.110
Parliament.
 

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:41.534
And the growing significance of
this institution is indicated by

00:42:41.534 --> 00:42:46.356
the anxiety of members of the
governing elite to serve as

00:42:46.356 --> 00:42:47.389
members.
 

00:42:47.389 --> 00:42:49.154
But finally,
if propaganda,

00:42:49.154 --> 00:42:52.818
the use of patronage and
consultation didn't succeed in

00:42:52.818 --> 00:42:56.889
welding together the interests
of the crown and the political

00:42:56.889 --> 00:42:59.974
nation,
there remained coercion,

00:42:59.974 --> 00:43:04.510
what was described at the time
as heavy lordship,

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:09.539
as distinct from good
lordship--often evident under

00:43:09.539 --> 00:43:15.976
both Henry VII and Henry VIII as
they established their authority

00:43:15.976 --> 00:43:18.190
and their dynasty.
 

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:23.121
When necessary they would bring
to Parliament and rush through

00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:24.900
'acts of attainder'.
 

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:30.211
Acts of attainder simply
declared particular individuals

00:43:30.211 --> 00:43:34.751
guilty of treason,
depriving them of their lands

00:43:34.751 --> 00:43:36.780
and their status.
 

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:40.570
They were often used against
rebellious nobles.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.701
They could be reversed in the
interests of the heirs to those

00:43:44.701 --> 00:43:48.144
estates if they behaved
themselves, but they had to

00:43:48.144 --> 00:43:50.280
prove themselves compliant.
 

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.030
Henry VII made frequent use of
acts of attainder.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.469
He very cleverly dated the
beginning of his reign to the

00:43:56.469 --> 00:43:58.719
day before the Battle of
Bosworth.

00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:00.489
He got Parliament to agree to
that.

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:03.559
That meant that everyone who
had opposed him,

00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:06.925
even though they were actually
fighting for the person who was

00:44:06.925 --> 00:44:10.800
the king at the time,
was automatically a traitor and

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.940
their lands were forfeit.
 

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.289
Clever.
 

00:44:14.289 --> 00:44:17.652
It enabled him to greatly
extend the royal lands in one

00:44:17.652 --> 00:44:20.268
move and there was more of that
to come.

00:44:20.268 --> 00:44:25.891
Acts of attainder were also
used against those who supported

00:44:25.891 --> 00:44:30.655
pretenders to the throne who
were foci of potential

00:44:30.655 --> 00:44:35.086
rebellions,
and actual rebellion in 1487

00:44:35.086 --> 00:44:37.059
against Henry VII.
 

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:43.905
Henry VII was also willing to
use another coercive measure,

00:44:43.905 --> 00:44:49.454
the placing of his nobility
under recognizances:

00:44:49.454 --> 00:44:52.170
recognizance bonds.
 

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:55.260
They were like a bail bond,
a bond--

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:59.311
a legal bond--that nobles were
forced to enter into to be of

00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:03.012
good behavior,
or if they failed to pay

00:45:03.012 --> 00:45:06.179
enormous financial penalties.
 

00:45:06.179 --> 00:45:09.233
They usually had to find
sureties from amongst their

00:45:09.233 --> 00:45:11.750
kinsmen and supporters for those
bonds,

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:16.076
which meant that those people
had an interest in making sure

00:45:16.076 --> 00:45:20.036
that the nobleman concerned
complied and would lose out

00:45:20.036 --> 00:45:22.530
themselves badly if he didn't.
 

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.864
These were used,
for example,

00:45:24.864 --> 00:45:29.954
against any nobleman who in any
way infringed the requirements

00:45:29.954 --> 00:45:31.289
of new laws.
 

00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:35.246
For example,
under Henry VII retaining,

00:45:35.246 --> 00:45:41.079
the retaining of an affinity of
clients, was regulated by

00:45:41.079 --> 00:45:42.329
license.
 

00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:46.293
Only those who were licensed to
do so could retain armed

00:45:46.293 --> 00:45:49.969
retainers and they were
forbidden from retaining any

00:45:49.969 --> 00:45:52.780
member of the crown's own
affinity.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.329
You could owe loyalty to the
king only.

00:45:55.329 --> 00:45:58.864
Anyone who infringed that was
likely to find himself hauled

00:45:58.864 --> 00:46:02.280
before the council and faced
with a recognizance bond.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.137
Lord Abergavenny,
the principal magnate in Kent,

00:46:06.137 --> 00:46:09.994
was put under a potential fine
of 70,000 pounds,

00:46:09.994 --> 00:46:14.510
a massive sum of money,
for such failure to comply.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:19.639
It wasn't actually executed but
it hung over his head like the

00:46:19.639 --> 00:46:23.510
sword of Damocles and he
complied in future.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.679
And then there were the laws of
treason.

00:46:26.679 --> 00:46:30.420
In the fourteenth century the
law of treason had been

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.737
introduced defining treason as
acts against the king's person

00:46:34.737 --> 00:46:38.909
or his family or open rebellion
against his authority.

00:46:38.909 --> 00:46:42.480
Under the early Tudors the law
of treason was extended.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.831
By the time of Henry VIII,
it came to include even

00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:50.206
treasonable words such as,
for example,

00:46:50.206 --> 00:46:55.179
denying the legitimacy of the
king's many marriages.

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:58.704
Particularly dangerous
individuals were ruthlessly

00:46:58.704 --> 00:46:59.639
eliminated.
 

00:46:59.639 --> 00:47:02.860
Under Henry VII,
the young Earl of Warwick--

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:07.579
Edward, Earl of Warwick--who
was the last potential claimant

00:47:07.579 --> 00:47:10.619
to the Yorkist claim to the
throne,

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:15.112
was imprisoned in the Tower of
London from childhood where he

00:47:15.112 --> 00:47:19.528
was kept until 1499 when in a
moment of danger to the throne

00:47:19.528 --> 00:47:21.849
Henry VII had him executed.
 

00:47:21.849 --> 00:47:25.804
Sir William Stanley,
one of those who had supported

00:47:25.804 --> 00:47:30.786
Henry at the Battle of Bosworth,
fell under the king's suspicion

00:47:30.786 --> 00:47:33.159
and was taken out in 1497.
 

00:47:33.159 --> 00:47:37.052
Under the young Henry VIII,
the presumptuous Edward

00:47:37.052 --> 00:47:41.333
Stafford, Duke of Buckingham,
was executed on trumped-up

00:47:41.333 --> 00:47:42.889
charges in 1521.
 

00:47:42.889 --> 00:47:48.420
His real crime was that he had
a distant claim to the throne.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.905
Henry didn't yet have a male
heir and it was alleged that

00:47:51.905 --> 00:47:55.206
Buckingham had listened to
prophecies that Henry never

00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:58.460
would have a male heir,
and that he had made some

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.820
resentful statements against the
King.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:06.514
When this came to the King's
knowledge Buckingham's days were

00:48:06.514 --> 00:48:07.559
numbered.
 

00:48:07.559 --> 00:48:11.849
Like most nobles who fell under
royal displeasure,

00:48:11.849 --> 00:48:14.300
Buckingham died by the ax.
 

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.378
Lesser folk were hung,
drawn and quartered,

00:48:18.378 --> 00:48:22.070
a less honorable means of
execution.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:24.931
It meant that they were hung by
the neck until they were not

00:48:24.931 --> 00:48:26.820
quite dead,
disemboweled,

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.550
their bowels burned before
their eyes,

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.034
and then cut down,
their bodies cut into four

00:48:34.034 --> 00:48:38.708
quarters which were dipped in
pitch and sent to be displayed

00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:42.985
at the gates of the leading
cities of the kingdom as an

00:48:42.985 --> 00:48:46.710
example to warn other potential
traitors.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:49.385
And trial procedures and
treason trials could be

00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:50.639
extremely arbitrary.
 

00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:53.289
The council could order arrest
at will.

00:48:53.289 --> 00:48:56.728
It could order the torture of
suspects--torture wasn't

00:48:56.728 --> 00:48:58.739
normally used in English law.
 

00:48:58.739 --> 00:49:01.809
Defense counsel was denied.
 

00:49:01.809 --> 00:49:06.403
Evidence could be fabricated to
get rid of unsuccessful losers

00:49:06.403 --> 00:49:08.739
in court factional struggles.
 

00:49:08.739 --> 00:49:12.809
At the very highest levels,
then, political conflict was

00:49:12.809 --> 00:49:16.880
played out to the death,
especially under Henry VIII.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.869
Indeed, one historian of Henry
VIII has said that in some parts

00:49:20.869 --> 00:49:24.797
of his reign his court had the
atmosphere of the Kremlin under

00:49:24.797 --> 00:49:28.221
Stalin,
with people going in constant

00:49:28.221 --> 00:49:31.969
fear of arousing the King's
displeasure.

00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:35.380
So the crown could deliver
largesse to the loyal;

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.010
it could consult with its
leading subjects;

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:42.699
but it could also brutally
display its wrath.

00:49:42.699 --> 00:49:46.130
The majesty which it displayed
on the one hand was

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.090
counterbalanced by terror.
 

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.289
All of this adds up then to a
political culture,

00:49:51.289 --> 00:49:55.077
a set of institutions of
government animated by certain

00:49:55.077 --> 00:49:58.726
understandings and rules and
practices which governed

00:49:58.726 --> 00:50:00.268
political conduct.
 

00:50:00.268 --> 00:50:04.157
That unwritten consensus about
how things were done was very

00:50:04.157 --> 00:50:07.320
well understood throughout
political society,

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.750
and political stability
depended upon sharing power in

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:14.115
varying degrees at various
levels of the structure in

00:50:14.115 --> 00:50:16.768
accordance with these
understandings.

00:50:16.768 --> 00:50:20.844
Effective rule was the outcome
of the use of considerable

00:50:20.844 --> 00:50:25.137
political skills by the kings
and their advisers within this

00:50:25.137 --> 00:50:28.702
framework to bring about the
willing obedience and

00:50:28.702 --> 00:50:32.050
participation of their leading
subjects.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:36.545
And for the most part the early
Tudor kings proved very able in

00:50:36.545 --> 00:50:39.807
achieving that:
in rebuilding the authority of

00:50:39.807 --> 00:50:44.376
the crown which had been so much
shaken by the civil wars of the

00:50:44.376 --> 00:50:48.364
fifteenth century,
in instilling habits of

00:50:48.364 --> 00:50:54.416
obedience, in reestablishing the
latent power of the monarchy and

00:50:54.416 --> 00:50:59.836
indeed in enhancing it--
something that we'll discuss in

00:50:59.836 --> 00:51:00.670
section.
 

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:02.807
But finally,
changing government in the

00:51:02.807 --> 00:51:06.072
sixteenth century involved more
than just reasserting royal

00:51:06.072 --> 00:51:06.860
authority.
 

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.730
It also came to involve
something else,

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:15.190
the expansion of the very scope
and objectives of government,

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:18.456
and to understand that we need
to see its development in the

00:51:18.456 --> 00:51:22.802
context of processes of change,
which were scarcely on the

00:51:22.802 --> 00:51:27.652
agenda as late as 1530,
but which were very soon to

00:51:27.652 --> 00:51:28.389
emerge.
 

00:51:28.389 --> 00:51:32.485
And in the next few lectures
I'll be looking at those by

00:51:32.485 --> 00:51:36.360
examining the most explosive of
these new issues,

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:42.070
the issues of the succession
and the issue of religion.

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:47.000

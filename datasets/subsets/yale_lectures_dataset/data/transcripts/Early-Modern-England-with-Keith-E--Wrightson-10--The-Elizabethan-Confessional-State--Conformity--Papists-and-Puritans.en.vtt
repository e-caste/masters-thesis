00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.010
Okay.
 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.860
Well, as you know,
in 1528 religious change had

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.130
not been a significant issue in
English politics.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.026
By 1558, it was in many ways
the central issue and it was

00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:20.080
about to take another turn.
 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.486
On the 17th of November,
1558, Elizabeth I was

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:30.175
proclaimed queen,
a young woman of twenty-five,

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:34.604
highly intelligent,
well educated and long schooled

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:39.181
in the necessity of caution,
discretion and even

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:44.854
dissimulation in order to
survive the dangers that she had

00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:45.750
faced.
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.050
She was of course Anne Boleyn's
daughter,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.623
and as Anne Boleyn's daughter
it was in a sense her conception

00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:57.521
in December of 1532 that had
finally precipitated the

00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:00.969
assertion of Henry VIII's royal
supremacy.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.468
So you could say in a sense
that Elizabeth's whole identity,

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:08.230
and above all her claims to the
throne,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.390
were bound up with the
rejection by her father of papal

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.760
authority.
 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.941
Now the precise nature of her
personal beliefs remains

00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:20.890
uncertain.
 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.311
She didn't really disclose
them, but unquestionably she

00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:31.030
identified herself with the
Protestant cause.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.760
Shortly after her accession,
at Christmas 1558,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.503
she very ostentatiously walked
out of mass in the royal chapel

00:01:39.503 --> 00:01:43.080
at the point at which the host
was elevated.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.903
A month later in January 1559
she very ostentatiously embraced

00:01:47.903 --> 00:01:52.331
an English Bible which was
offered to her by the citizens

00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:57.629
of London on her state entry to
London prior to her coronation.

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:01.884
So Elizabeth was making no
secret of the fact that she

00:02:01.884 --> 00:02:06.299
inclined towards reform,
as indeed everyone expected.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.628
But if she inclined towards
reform she was neither

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:14.960
dogmatically nor
straightforwardly Protestant,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.490
and the religious settlement of
1559,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.391
the first business of her
reign, very much reflected that

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:22.878
fact.
 

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:28.229
It was in part the product of
theological convictions,

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:33.771
but it was also very much a
settlement that reflected a

00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:39.520
religious preference that was
tempered by sheer political

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.060
expediency.
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.090
What actually happened remains
rather cloudy--

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.690
some aspects of the
documentation are inadequate--

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.750
but the most convincing
interpretation of the settlement

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.810
to my mind is that of Norman
Jones.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.430
In his view Elizabeth and her
chief adviser,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.730
William Cecil,
intended initially to return to

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.280
the situation of 1552 just
before the death of her brother,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.389
Edward VI.
 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.759
But they met severe opposition
in Parliament particularly in

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.205
the House of Lords,
opposition not only from the

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:18.229
Catholic bishops who sat in the
Lords but also from some of the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.758
leading lay members of the
peerage,

00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:24.758
and so they had to return to
Parliament with a distinctly

00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:28.973
watered-down draft prayer book
setting out their desires for

00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:30.758
religious settlement.
 

00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:34.479
So, for example,
in 1559 in the prayer book they

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.911
brought to Parliament the
communion service was in fact a

00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:43.342
blend of the prayer book of 1552
with its very Protestant

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:47.062
statements regarding the
communion service being

00:03:47.062 --> 00:03:51.970
essentially a service of
remembrance and thanksgiving.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.967
They blended that with the
earlier 1549 prayer book which

00:03:55.967 --> 00:04:00.322
had allowed for the possibility
that there was a real presence

00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:04.318
of Christ's body and blood in
the communion service.

00:04:04.318 --> 00:04:08.512
And so in 1559 the wording at
the administration of the

00:04:08.512 --> 00:04:12.704
communion was as follows:
the bread..."the body of

00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:16.333
our Lord Jesus Christ,
which was given for thee

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:19.910
preserve thy body and soul unto
everlasting life."

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.877
That's 1549,
followed immediately by

00:04:22.877 --> 00:04:27.797
"take and eat this in
remembrance that Christ died for

00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:31.699
thee and feed on him in thy
heart by faith with

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.500
thanksgiving";
that's 1552.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.389
They blended the two together
so that you could read it as you

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:39.899
chose.
 

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:43.913
It's been described by Diarmaid
MacCulloch as "a

00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:47.309
masterpiece of theological
engineering,"

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.319
or fudging the issue you could
say.

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.732
Again in 1559 the bill brought
before Parliament put forward

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:59.144
the title for Elizabeth not as
supreme head of the Church of

00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:02.209
England but only of Supreme
Governor.

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:06.163
That's often seen as being a
more appropriate title for a

00:05:06.163 --> 00:05:08.420
woman,
governor rather than head,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.851
but it also of course left open
the possibility that the

00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:15.221
settlement might be accepted,
that the position of supreme

00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:18.307
governor might be accepted,
by people who regarded the

00:05:18.307 --> 00:05:21.500
supreme head of the church as
being elsewhere,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.100
in Rome.
 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.269
Even so, despite these
compromises,

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:29.072
Elizabeth and her counselors
were able to get their

00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:32.269
settlement through Parliament
only by purging the House of

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.829
Lords.
 

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:35.923
They ruthlessly excluded many
of the Catholic bishops in the

00:05:35.923 --> 00:05:38.860
end and they still got a
majority of only three votes.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.100
They squeezed it through the
House of Lords.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.360
Support in the commons was much
stronger.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.180
So the Church of England was
reestablished.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.449
English was Protestant again,
sort of.

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.312
It was a confessional state
bound by an Act of Uniformity

00:05:56.312 --> 00:06:00.588
that the prayer book should be
used throughout the kingdom,

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:06.019
uniformity to the religion set
down by the Queen in Parliament,

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:10.447
what was often described as
'the religion by law

00:06:10.447 --> 00:06:11.860
established'.
 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.615
But that religion was less
imposed by simple royal dictate

00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:21.206
than a reflection of what
Elizabeth and her advisers had

00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:23.959
proved willing to settle for.
 

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:27.115
There was no doubt that England
had turned in a broadly

00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:31.589
Protestant direction again,
but there was also a lot of

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.427
ambiguity about the nature and
the extent of that

00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:38.139
Protestantism.
 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.139
Okay.
 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.536
Well, maybe Elizabeth and
William Cecil and the other

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:46.000
counselors got less than they
originally intended,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.065
but they accepted it,
and they could even use it to

00:06:51.065 --> 00:06:52.889
their advantage.
 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.843
It was perhaps no bad thing in
the England of 1559 that the

00:06:56.843 --> 00:07:00.389
religious settlement contained a
lot of ambiguity.

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:05.490
Thirty years of religious flux
had left the nation profoundly

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.040
divided in matters of faith.
 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.488
No change during those thirty
years had had time to put down

00:07:13.488 --> 00:07:14.689
deep roots.
 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:18.833
To some historians like
Christopher Haigh most of the

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:21.064
people remained,
in the main,

00:07:21.064 --> 00:07:24.810
traditionalists in their
religious beliefs.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.495
To other historians like Robert
Whiting people had grown almost

00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:32.694
indifferent,
acquiescing and conforming to

00:07:32.694 --> 00:07:36.716
change after change,
but essentially guarded and

00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:39.899
unenthusiastic in their
attitudes.

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:42.293
But also, as you've seen in
last week's reading,

00:07:42.293 --> 00:07:45.351
there was a third reading of
the situation represented by the

00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.879
work of Christopher Marsh.
 

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:52.161
People were now only too aware
of the existence of alternatives

00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:57.017
in religion, alternatives which
hadn't existed back in the

00:07:57.017 --> 00:07:57.870
1520s.
 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.639
Some of them hankered after the
old ways,

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:04.494
some of them were drawn to the
attractive features of the new

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:08.278
doctrines,
but everyone knew the danger of

00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:10.180
religious conflict.
 

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.899
They'd witnessed enough of that
under Mary.

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:15.139
As a result,
Marsh suggests they "held

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:17.591
their peace,"
and as you know he uses that

00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:20.310
term in a double sense:
negatively in the sense that

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.404
they were compliant,
they remained silent before the

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:28.644
demands of authority;
positively in the sense that

00:08:28.644 --> 00:08:33.351
they preserved the peace of
their own communities as best

00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:34.529
they could.
 

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:38.818
One could say that that was an
attitude that had developed as a

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:42.761
result of the turmoil of the
late 1540s and early 1550s in

00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:43.798
particular.
 

00:08:43.798 --> 00:08:47.721
Even under Mary,
the mayor of Exeter in the

00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:50.019
west,
down here in Devon,

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:54.830
was a man who although a devout
Catholic in his own practice

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.803
regarded Protestant sympathizers
among his neighbors with some

00:08:59.803 --> 00:09:02.250
discretion and tolerance.
 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.831
It was said of him that he did
"friendly and lovingly bear

00:09:06.831 --> 00:09:10.674
with them and wink at
them," he shut his eyes to

00:09:10.674 --> 00:09:12.080
their practice.
 

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.580
And one could say that
Elizabeth was winking at people

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.090
too.
 

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.587
She winked at people in many
ways.

00:09:18.587 --> 00:09:19.769
&gt;
 

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:23.259
She was the Supreme Governor of
the Church of England.

00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:26.663
She was the head of a
confessional state but she also

00:09:26.663 --> 00:09:30.836
said early in her reign,
"I will not make windows

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:34.327
into men's souls";
a striking metaphor,

00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:38.370
"I will not make windows
into men's souls."

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.730
What she and her counselors
wanted was order,

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:46.217
outward conformity,
stability, and in pursuit of

00:09:46.217 --> 00:09:51.662
those objectives the ambiguities
of 1559 were in many ways

00:09:51.662 --> 00:09:55.960
advantageous and they could be
developed.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.697
Soon after the passage of the
settlement through Parliament,

00:09:59.697 --> 00:10:03.120
a set of injunctions concerning
worship were issued.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.919
They permitted the images which
had survived Protestant

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:12.899
iconoclasm to remain in churches
so long as they were not

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:15.298
superstitiously abused.
 

00:10:15.298 --> 00:10:19.409
They said that in future
communion tables were to be used

00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:22.418
for holy communion rather than
altars,

00:10:22.418 --> 00:10:27.412
but nonetheless the communion
table could stand where the old

00:10:27.412 --> 00:10:28.908
altar had stood.
 

00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:32.938
At holy communion traditional
wafers were used rather than

00:10:32.938 --> 00:10:34.000
common bread.
 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.139
There were many concessions of
this kind.

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:40.408
Elizabeth herself would have
liked to have kept the rood

00:10:40.408 --> 00:10:43.203
screens above the chancel with
their crucifixes,

00:10:43.203 --> 00:10:43.678
etc.
 

00:10:43.678 --> 00:10:46.298
She kept a crucifix in her own
chapel.

00:10:46.298 --> 00:10:50.096
But her more Protestant bishops
really wouldn't stand for that

00:10:50.096 --> 00:10:53.643
and many rood screens were
gradually dismantled throughout

00:10:53.643 --> 00:10:56.320
the kingdom in the course of the
1560s.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.866
Or again in dealing with the
clergy, she faced in Parliament

00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:05.567
bishops who put up such a stiff
opposition that she was forced

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:07.110
to deprive them.
 

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.840
She would have liked them to
stay.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.360
They didn't,
but new appointments to the

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.658
Episcopal bench were rarely
religious extremists.

00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:18.229
It was significant that she
chose as Archbishop of

00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:22.030
Canterbury Matthew Parker,
a Cambridge academic who was a

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.458
Protestant certainly,
but who had not gone into exile

00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:26.110
under Mary.
 

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.798
He had conformed and kept his
head down.

00:11:28.798 --> 00:11:32.423
She considered Parker a more
appropriate choice than some of

00:11:32.423 --> 00:11:36.110
the more radical Protestants
that she could have selected.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.658
Amongst the parish clergy too
there was no mass purge.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:45.167
Many of the clergy were allowed
to keep their positions and even

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:49.101
to get away with formally
subscribing to the prayer book

00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:53.107
and the Act of Uniformity but
continuing many traditional

00:11:53.107 --> 00:11:55.038
practices unhindered.
 

00:11:55.038 --> 00:11:58.447
The toleration which was
extended to traditional

00:11:58.447 --> 00:12:02.075
practices allowed them to
preserve in many ways the

00:12:02.075 --> 00:12:06.426
appearance of tradition in the
way they conducted services in

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:07.950
their parishes.
 

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.860
Christopher Haigh has a nice
phrase for it.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.043
He says many of these people
were "liturgical

00:12:13.043 --> 00:12:14.538
hermaphrodites."
 

00:12:14.538 --> 00:12:19.479
They used the prayer book but
they could tweak it their own

00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:19.990
way.
 

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.808
Again fines were laid down for
people who failed to attend the

00:12:23.808 --> 00:12:27.629
Church of England at least once
a month but they were set very

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:28.129
low.
 

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:31.462
The fine was twelve pence a
month if you failed to attend

00:12:31.462 --> 00:12:34.960
Church of England services,
which was about the equivalent

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.240
of a day's wages for a London
laborer,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.179
not a steep fine at all.
 

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:43.668
So what did it all mean?
 

00:12:43.668 --> 00:12:49.149
Clearly, Elizabeth was no
Catholic but she refused to

00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:54.628
persecute, and equally she
refused to countenance any

00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:56.629
further reform.
 

00:12:56.629 --> 00:13:00.102
She seems to have learned her
lesson in 1559 about the art of

00:13:00.102 --> 00:13:02.129
the possible and she stuck to
it.

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:05.528
And that came out very clearly
just a few years later in 1563

00:13:05.528 --> 00:13:08.472
when at a meeting of the
convocation of the Church of

00:13:08.472 --> 00:13:10.943
England,
the assembly of the clergy of

00:13:10.943 --> 00:13:14.211
the Church of England,
there occurred what's known as

00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:15.918
the Vestiarian Controversy.
 

00:13:15.918 --> 00:13:18.908
Some of the more radical
Protestants in convocation

00:13:18.908 --> 00:13:22.553
wanted to get rid of traditional
vestments worn by the priests

00:13:22.553 --> 00:13:23.750
during services.
 

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.528
They described them as the
"rags of Rome."

00:13:27.528 --> 00:13:31.745
These, however,
had been retained in the prayer

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:36.235
book of 1559 and Elizabeth
insisted upon retaining

00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:41.460
traditional clerical dress and
forced Archbishop Parker to

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.210
demand it of the clergy.
 

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.330
So what was England's religion
in the 1560s?

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.860
Ultimately, one could say it
was the Queen's religion.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.782
With regard to the pope's
authority, it was emphatically

00:13:56.782 --> 00:13:57.710
schismatic.
 

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.418
Papal authority had been
abrogated once again.

00:14:01.418 --> 00:14:03.240
With regard to essential
doctrines,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.197
it was essentially Protestant,
but nonetheless it retained a

00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:11.389
latitude to make of the
settlement,

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:16.520
to read the prayer book,
as you chose provided you

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.928
conformed in general.
 

00:14:18.928 --> 00:14:22.942
The only element of settlement
one could say which was totally

00:14:22.942 --> 00:14:25.970
without ambiguity was the Act of
Uniformity;

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:32.360
conform and hold your peace.
 

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.907
Well, in an age of religious
partisanship,

00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:41.270
in what was already becoming in
Europe an age of religious war,

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.298
that was not really a bad deal.
 

00:14:44.298 --> 00:14:47.960
But of course it couldn't stand
there.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.889
Whatever the ambiguities of the
settlement,

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:54.113
first of all no one could
really doubt that it was

00:14:54.113 --> 00:14:56.678
basically Protestant in
orientation,

00:14:56.678 --> 00:15:02.845
and secondly no one yet knew
that Elizabeth would live to be

00:15:02.845 --> 00:15:03.889
seventy.
 

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:07.775
And those two facts shaped the
attitudes of both committed

00:15:07.775 --> 00:15:11.048
Catholics and the more committed
Protestants,

00:15:11.048 --> 00:15:14.918
and by 1560 of course there
were plenty of both.

00:15:14.918 --> 00:15:19.629
Both groups of zealots were
preoccupied with what might

00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:20.850
happen next.
 

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.700
Would there be another turn of
the wheel?

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.538
Would Elizabeth survive?
 

00:15:24.538 --> 00:15:29.046
And both sides were determined
to do what they could to shape

00:15:29.046 --> 00:15:33.552
events to their own advantage if
such a possibility of future

00:15:33.552 --> 00:15:34.980
change emerged.
 

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.619
So let's look at the two groups
who opposed in different ways

00:15:39.619 --> 00:15:44.490
the Elizabethan settlement and
how their challenges were met.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:49.750
We can start by looking at the
Catholics.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.830
Christopher Haigh argues,
persuasively I think,

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.308
that there was a great deal of
what he calls traditionalist

00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:56.870
"survivalism."
 

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.586
To a considerable degree,
the early Elizabethan church

00:16:00.586 --> 00:16:04.796
was attempting to accommodate
that traditionalism amongst the

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:06.620
population as a whole.
 

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.413
But the more committed,
more theologically aware and

00:16:11.413 --> 00:16:17.336
more politically aware Catholics
knew that this was a recipe for

00:16:17.336 --> 00:16:21.658
the gradual erosion of Catholic
principle.

00:16:21.658 --> 00:16:25.240
There were a lot of people who
were described at the time as

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.850
"church papists"
in the 1560s,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.700
people whose bodies were in the
Church of England,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.870
as it were, but whose hearts
remained with the old religion.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:42.014
Such people would gradually
become hopelessly compromised

00:16:42.014 --> 00:16:47.708
over time unless something was
done to stiffen their resistance

00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:52.761
to a gradual slide into
conformity and acceptance of the

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.139
new ways.
 

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.658
And in the eyes of those who
feared this there was,

00:16:56.658 --> 00:17:00.799
after all, every possibility
that the settlement of 1559

00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:04.490
would not endure any longer than
other changes.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:09.253
It all hung on the life of one
young woman and in 1562

00:17:09.253 --> 00:17:13.568
Elizabeth contracted smallpox
and almost died.

00:17:13.568 --> 00:17:17.568
Her counselors were in a panic
as she lay on her sick bed.

00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:20.405
She recovered,
but it was a warning of what

00:17:20.405 --> 00:17:21.420
could happen.
 

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.153
We have to remember this,
this vital element of

00:17:25.153 --> 00:17:29.861
uncertainty, whenever we look at
the Elizabethan church and

00:17:29.861 --> 00:17:33.190
indeed at other aspects of her
reign.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:37.444
So, you get in these years the
gradual emergence of what might

00:17:37.444 --> 00:17:41.143
be called a kind of shadow
church or a church in exile

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:45.328
waiting for the possibility of a
return to the old ways.

00:17:45.328 --> 00:17:51.147
And the years 1568 to 1570
proved to be in many ways a

00:17:51.147 --> 00:17:55.098
turning point for these
Catholics.

00:17:55.098 --> 00:17:59.073
In 1568, William Allen,
a former Oxford don who had

00:17:59.073 --> 00:18:03.212
fled to the continent,
founded a college at Douai in

00:18:03.212 --> 00:18:07.892
the Netherlands for the purpose
of training priests who would be

00:18:07.892 --> 00:18:12.422
smuggled back into England and
who could operate in secrecy to

00:18:12.422 --> 00:18:15.690
stiffen the faith of English
Catholics.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.310
In the same year,
in May of 1568,

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.096
Mary Stuart,
the Queen of Scotland,

00:18:21.096 --> 00:18:25.682
a Catholic, was deposed by her
own subjects and fled into

00:18:25.682 --> 00:18:26.828
England.
 

00:18:26.828 --> 00:18:30.348
There she was kept under house
arrest by Elizabeth,

00:18:30.348 --> 00:18:33.659
but while she remained she was
clearly a claimant to the

00:18:33.659 --> 00:18:37.328
English throne within reach of
those who opposed Elizabeth.

00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:40.223
She was Elizabeth's nearest
relative, her cousin,

00:18:40.223 --> 00:18:41.250
and a Catholic.
 

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.834
I'll say more about Mary,
Queen of Scots next time,

00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:48.848
but her presence is a constant
factor in the equation.

00:18:48.848 --> 00:18:53.118
In 1567 to '68,
almost simultaneously,

00:18:53.118 --> 00:18:56.190
came the outbreak of the Dutch
revolt,

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.210
a revolt of the provinces of
the Netherlands,

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:03.720
just across the narrow seas,
against Spanish rule,

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.406
which led to the establishment
in the Netherlands of a powerful

00:19:07.406 --> 00:19:11.035
Spanish army to put down that
revolt sent by King Philip II of

00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:13.364
Spain,
the champion of the Counter

00:19:13.364 --> 00:19:14.788
Reformation in Europe.
 

00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:18.848
Its arrival was followed by a
massive repression of

00:19:18.848 --> 00:19:23.721
Protestants in the Netherlands
and the flight of many of them

00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:24.940
to England.
 

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.516
And in the following year,
in 1569, came the revolt of the

00:19:30.516 --> 00:19:32.180
northern earls.
 

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.608
That began with a plot to
release Mary,

00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:38.961
Queen of Scots from captivity,
to marry her to the Duke of

00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:40.990
Norfolk,
who was a crypto-Catholic,

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.017
to restore her to the Scottish
throne with the help of the

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.988
Spanish army,
which was just over the seas in

00:19:46.988 --> 00:19:50.500
the Netherlands,
and to depose Elizabeth.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.019
When the scheme was discovered
by Elizabeth's intelligence

00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:56.549
service the earls of
Northumberland and of

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:59.250
Westmorland,
the two dominant nobles of the

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.759
north,
rose in rebellion.

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:02.818
They raised about 5,000 men.
 

00:20:02.818 --> 00:20:05.200
They captured the city of
Durham.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.450
They restored the mass in
Durham Cathedral.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.088
They moved gradually south.
 

00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:15.590
The government responded to the
rising by securing Mary and

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.538
moving her south out of their
reach.

00:20:18.538 --> 00:20:21.191
She was placed under the
tutelage of the Earl of

00:20:21.191 --> 00:20:23.108
Shrewsbury down in the Midlands.
 

00:20:23.108 --> 00:20:26.088
The northern earls failed to
move swiftly.

00:20:26.088 --> 00:20:30.108
They got bogged down besieging
a castle near Durham which was

00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:33.993
held by the loyal Bowes family
for Elizabeth and eventually

00:20:33.993 --> 00:20:38.079
realizing that their support was
eroding they gave up and fled

00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:39.420
into Scotland.
 

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.359
There then followed two years
of diplomatic and military

00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:47.372
bullying before eventually the
Earl of Northumberland was

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:51.170
surrendered back to the English
and was executed.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.788
By then the rebellion was long
over.

00:20:52.788 --> 00:20:55.853
By December 1569,
it had proved to be a fiasco

00:20:55.853 --> 00:20:58.878
and had fizzled out,
but in February 1570,

00:20:58.878 --> 00:21:03.093
rather too late,
the Pope, having heard of it,

00:21:03.093 --> 00:21:05.240
offered his support.
 

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.554
He excommunicated Elizabeth and
he absolved her subjects from

00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:13.298
their obedience to the Queen.
 

00:21:13.298 --> 00:21:15.180
He was telling her Catholic
subjects,

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.923
in other words,
that rebellion against this

00:21:18.923 --> 00:21:22.942
heretic queen was no sin--
a little too late,

00:21:22.942 --> 00:21:27.678
but nonetheless at last a
clarifying decision on the part

00:21:27.678 --> 00:21:31.230
of the papacy with regard to
Elizabeth.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:37.692
For the Catholic subjects of
the Queen in 1568 to '70 one

00:21:37.692 --> 00:21:43.348
could say the moment of truth
had at last come.

00:21:43.348 --> 00:21:45.984
At last there had been
principled resistance to the

00:21:45.984 --> 00:21:49.181
Elizabeth settlement,
at last there had been a lead

00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:52.163
from the papacy,
but in a sense it was also a

00:21:52.163 --> 00:21:55.538
disaster for the average
traditionalist in religion.

00:21:55.538 --> 00:21:58.960
Now they were in a position
where they had to choose.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.630
They had to make a stand,
like it or not.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.118
Geopolitical realities
increasingly demanded it,

00:22:06.118 --> 00:22:09.980
and for many of them that was
an absolutely agonizing

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.019
situation.
 

00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:14.047
And in the years that followed,
in many ways,

00:22:14.047 --> 00:22:15.078
it got worse.
 

00:22:15.078 --> 00:22:19.519
From the mid 1570s missionary
priests trained in the

00:22:19.519 --> 00:22:24.134
Netherlands began arriving to
stiffen the faith of the

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.048
Catholic faithful.
 

00:22:26.048 --> 00:22:29.599
There were something like sixty
who arrived in the course of the

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:30.390
later 1570s.
 

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.607
Between then and the end of the
reign in 1603,

00:22:33.607 --> 00:22:37.398
something like 500 Catholic
priests were smuggled into

00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:39.759
England to operate in secret.
 

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:42.082
From the 1580s,
they were joined by another

00:22:42.082 --> 00:22:43.702
group,
the Jesuits,

00:22:43.702 --> 00:22:48.752
the shock troops of the
Catholic Counter Reformation in

00:22:48.752 --> 00:22:53.150
Europe who joined in the mission
to England.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.599
Now of course from their
perspective these were heroic

00:22:57.599 --> 00:23:00.103
people,
and yet they were fatally

00:23:00.103 --> 00:23:03.828
compromised by their association
with a foreign power,

00:23:03.828 --> 00:23:08.538
Spain, and they were inevitably
associated with the dynamics of

00:23:08.538 --> 00:23:13.185
religious conflict in Europe--
not least because some of the

00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:17.848
leaders of the Catholic mission
subscribed to the view that it

00:23:17.848 --> 00:23:22.358
was no sin to depose or even
murder a heretical monarch.

00:23:22.358 --> 00:23:25.733
And so began a series of plots
which were uncovered throughout

00:23:25.733 --> 00:23:28.500
the middle and later years of
Elizabeth's reign.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.690
In 1571, the Ridolfi plot to
depose Elizabeth,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.730
place Mary, Queen of Scots on
the throne, marry her to the

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.150
Duke of Norfolk.
 

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.720
That ended in 1572 with the
execution of Norfolk.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.018
In 1572, the news came from
France of the Saint

00:23:45.018 --> 00:23:48.818
Bartholomew's Day Massacre of
Protestants in Paris.

00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:52.550
This seemed a demonstration
from abroad of the risk of

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.029
Catholic treachery.
 

00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:58.358
In 1583, the Throckmorton plot
to murder Elizabeth was

00:23:58.358 --> 00:23:59.338
uncovered.
 

00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:02.759
A year later in 1584,
the leader of the Dutch

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:06.726
Protestants, William the Silent,
was murdered in the

00:24:06.726 --> 00:24:07.970
Netherlands.
 

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.881
In 1586, the Babington plot to
depose Elizabeth and elevate

00:24:12.881 --> 00:24:17.200
Mary, Queen of Scots to the
throne was uncovered.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.296
The atmosphere then was one of
tremendous insecurity and the

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:25.318
government's response was
severe.

00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:29.487
In 1581, it was declared by
Parliament treason to be

00:24:29.487 --> 00:24:34.144
absolved from schism with Rome
and to be reconciled to the

00:24:34.144 --> 00:24:35.779
Catholic church.
 

00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:38.416
Recusancy fines for not
attending the Church of England

00:24:38.416 --> 00:24:41.250
were raised from one shillings a
month to twenty pounds.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.336
That's a four hundredfold
increase in the size of

00:24:45.336 --> 00:24:46.868
recusancy fines.
 

00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:51.608
In 1585, England was at last,
after long hesitation,

00:24:51.608 --> 00:24:55.451
brought to declare open war
with Spain and to send troops to

00:24:55.451 --> 00:24:59.228
the Netherlands to help stiffen
the resistance of the Dutch

00:24:59.228 --> 00:25:00.269
Protestants.
 

00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:04.960
And in the same year Parliament
made it treason for any ordained

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.980
priest of the Catholic church
even to enter England.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:14.308
For a priest to be found on
English soil was treason.

00:25:14.308 --> 00:25:17.038
In 1586, following the
Babington plot,

00:25:17.038 --> 00:25:19.930
Mary, Queen of Scots was at
last brought to trial,

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.896
sentenced to death,
and then, after long hesitation

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:28.430
on the part of Elizabeth,
finally beheaded in February

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:29.259
1587.
 

00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:33.905
And then in 1588 the whole
nation was mobilized to resist

00:25:33.905 --> 00:25:37.890
the threat of invasion by the
Spanish Armada--

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:42.644
a great fleet sent by Philip II
intended to pick up troops in

00:25:42.644 --> 00:25:45.270
the Netherlands,
transport them across the

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.170
narrow seas,
and attack London.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.755
A plan which was eventually
foiled only by the resistance

00:25:51.755 --> 00:25:55.596
which was put up by the English
fleet in the Channel and then

00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:59.117
the scattering of Spanish ships
as they sailed north and

00:25:59.117 --> 00:26:03.278
eventually around Scotland and
Ireland to return to Spain,

00:26:03.278 --> 00:26:07.519
many of them being lost on the
way.

00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:12.438
Following the--what was seen as
the--divine deliverance in the

00:26:12.438 --> 00:26:17.355
Armada campaign the war dragged
on right through to the end of

00:26:17.355 --> 00:26:19.130
Elizabeth's reign.
 

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.537
Well, in such a context any
priests who landed in England to

00:26:23.537 --> 00:26:27.571
do God's work amongst the
Catholic faithful as they saw

00:26:27.571 --> 00:26:30.481
it,
were inevitably regarded by the

00:26:30.481 --> 00:26:34.808
government as the traitorous
servants of a foreign power.

00:26:34.808 --> 00:26:39.834
Between 1581 and 1603,131
Catholic priests were arrested

00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:45.405
and executed together with sixty
of the lay people who had hid

00:26:45.405 --> 00:26:48.282
them,
all of them being executed as

00:26:48.282 --> 00:26:48.960
traitors.
 

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.689
These are those who are
regarded in the English Catholic

00:26:52.689 --> 00:26:55.130
tradition as the Catholic
Martyrs.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:59.230
And in a nation that was
increasingly prone to regard

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:04.200
itself as a beleaguered island
threatened by mighty enemies,

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.632
Catholicism almost inevitably
became tainted by its

00:27:08.632 --> 00:27:11.380
association with that threat.
 

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.210
Of course, that was mistaken.
 

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.998
Many of the Catholic nobility
and gentry went out of their way

00:27:17.998 --> 00:27:20.420
to stress their loyalty to
Elizabeth;

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.130
that they would not support any
foreign invasion;

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.085
that they would indeed
sometimes openly declare

00:27:26.085 --> 00:27:29.170
themselves as sufficiently loyal
to oppose it.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:30.730
They were well known.
 

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.165
They were often trusted as
individuals by their Protestant

00:27:34.165 --> 00:27:34.890
neighbors.
 

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.866
The fines levied upon them for
their Catholic recusancy were

00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:42.440
often very selectively and
intermittently enforced.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.095
Amongst the Catholic population
as a whole there were only a

00:27:46.095 --> 00:27:49.565
tiny number of zealots who were
ever actively involved in

00:27:49.565 --> 00:27:53.288
treasonable plots,
especially against the Queen's

00:27:53.288 --> 00:27:53.750
life.
 

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.240
Nevertheless,
be that as it may,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.909
in the situation after 1570,
and especially after the

00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:05.494
outbreak of war in 1585,
the Catholic community as an

00:28:05.494 --> 00:28:10.422
entity lay under the shadow of
distrust and it was subject to a

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:15.269
developing prejudice which would
take centuries to dispel.

00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:20.617
As Patrick Collinson has
written, anti-Catholicism became

00:28:20.617 --> 00:28:25.776
almost "a sheet anchor of
English nationhood"

00:28:25.776 --> 00:28:31.316
and the Catholic community
within England became in a sense

00:28:31.316 --> 00:28:34.660
aliens within their own land.
 

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.538
What about the other
threat?--the radical

00:28:37.538 --> 00:28:42.000
Protestants, those who we think
of now as Puritans but that was

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.519
not a term they used initially.
 

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:47.740
It was a term of insult that
was sometimes thrown at them.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.660
They were described usually at
the time as "the hotter

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.279
sort of Protestants";
"the hotter sort of

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:56.029
Protestants."
 

00:28:56.029 --> 00:29:00.460
To them the accession of
Elizabeth in 1558 had been a

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.634
providential deliverance,
a divine intervention in

00:29:04.634 --> 00:29:06.338
English affairs.
 

00:29:06.338 --> 00:29:08.645
November the 17th,
the Queen's accession day,

00:29:08.645 --> 00:29:10.900
was celebrated with the ringing
of bells;

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.480
it became almost like a
Protestant holy day.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.592
But though they regarded the
Church of England which she

00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:23.269
established a year later in 1559
as undoubtedly a true church,

00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:27.239
it seemed to these Protestant
radicals that it was a church

00:29:27.239 --> 00:29:31.773
which was only half reformed,
and they too were worried about

00:29:31.773 --> 00:29:33.588
what might happen next.
 

00:29:33.588 --> 00:29:37.608
They could have no certainty
that it would last.

00:29:37.608 --> 00:29:41.068
They were anxious to push
ahead, to consolidate the

00:29:41.068 --> 00:29:44.150
position,
to move urgently to what they

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.720
described as "further
reformation."

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.588
Especially they wanted
reformation of some of the

00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:53.996
traditionalist structures of the
Church of England and the

00:29:53.996 --> 00:29:57.522
removal of some of the more
traditional aspects of its forms

00:29:57.522 --> 00:29:58.538
of worship.
 

00:29:58.538 --> 00:30:00.792
They wanted to get rid of the
"rags of Rome"

00:30:00.792 --> 00:30:02.410
or the "dregs the
popery."

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:06.608
This is the sort of language
they used.

00:30:06.608 --> 00:30:11.096
So there was from the beginning
an element of dissidence even

00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:15.134
amongst those who could be
regarded as Elizabeth's most

00:30:15.134 --> 00:30:17.230
enthusiastic supporters.
 

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.445
And that was especially true
amongst the younger clergy who

00:30:20.445 --> 00:30:22.608
were emerging from the
universities,

00:30:22.608 --> 00:30:26.328
now thoroughly trained in
Protestant doctrine,

00:30:26.328 --> 00:30:27.900
and who were becoming,
if anything,

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.790
more emphatically Protestant
even than those who had led the

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.190
church in the later years of
Edward VI.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.699
This younger generation were
moving beyond the doctrinal

00:30:39.699 --> 00:30:42.760
position which had been
established by Archbishop

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.397
Cranmer in the early 1550s and
was enshrined in the prayer

00:30:46.397 --> 00:30:47.098
book.
 

00:30:47.098 --> 00:30:50.836
Increasingly,
they felt the influence of John

00:30:50.836 --> 00:30:54.657
Calvin, the great Protestant
leader of Geneva,

00:30:54.657 --> 00:30:58.308
and his successor there,
Theodore Beza.

00:30:58.308 --> 00:31:02.186
In terms of the doctrine of
salvation, they increasingly

00:31:02.186 --> 00:31:05.923
adopted the doctrine of
'predestination' championed by

00:31:05.923 --> 00:31:09.851
Calvin;
the notion that only an elect

00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:13.220
minority would find salvation.
 

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.064
Many also adopted the doctrine
of double predestination

00:31:17.064 --> 00:31:20.971
championed by Beza;
the view that God had decreed

00:31:20.971 --> 00:31:26.209
from the beginning of the world
who would be elect and who would

00:31:26.209 --> 00:31:27.288
be damned.
 

00:31:27.288 --> 00:31:31.384
This kind of belief bred
amongst them a very anxious

00:31:31.384 --> 00:31:32.588
spirituality.
 

00:31:32.588 --> 00:31:36.230
At the individual level they
were deeply anxious about their

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.588
own spiritual state.
 

00:31:37.588 --> 00:31:41.548
Were they or were they not
amongst the elect?

00:31:41.548 --> 00:31:44.833
They tended to indulge in
intense spiritual

00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:48.429
self-searching,
rigorous attempts to sanctify

00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:52.958
their personal lives in a way
that would give them a sense of

00:31:52.958 --> 00:31:55.598
assurance of their own election.
 

00:31:55.598 --> 00:31:59.141
It was also a kind of
theological position which bred

00:31:59.141 --> 00:32:03.160
what's been described as a
"piebald mentality."

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.457
They saw things in very black
and white terms,

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.068
a piebald mentality.
 

00:32:08.068 --> 00:32:12.615
The godly saw themselves as a
beleaguered minority in a world

00:32:12.615 --> 00:32:16.858
that was dominated by the
reprobate, the unregenerate.

00:32:16.858 --> 00:32:21.438
They tended to describe
themselves as the "little

00:32:21.438 --> 00:32:25.066
flock," the "godly
remnant,"

00:32:25.066 --> 00:32:29.990
and that in turn seems to have
bred amongst them a kind of

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.150
activist mentality.
 

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.666
There was a duty to demonstrate
their own godliness by standing

00:32:35.666 --> 00:32:39.352
up for the honor of God,
by doing His work in the world,

00:32:39.352 --> 00:32:43.009
by spreading truth,
by combating sin and error.

00:32:43.009 --> 00:32:47.923
A form of activism which in a
sense could give them greater

00:32:47.923 --> 00:32:48.940
assurance.
 

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.407
For the most part,
they did that work in relative

00:32:52.407 --> 00:32:56.308
obscurity, down in the many
parishes of the kingdom.

00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:59.519
Puritans were amongst the most
zealous preachers.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:02.358
They were often chosen as
'lecturers',

00:33:02.358 --> 00:33:06.107
people who would be hired by
local authorities to preach

00:33:06.107 --> 00:33:11.759
extra sermons on market days,
for example, or on the weekdays.

00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:15.748
In some areas they were
numerous enough by the 1570s to

00:33:15.748 --> 00:33:19.958
found regular meetings of
sympathizers which were known as

00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:22.098
"prophesyings."
 

00:33:22.098 --> 00:33:25.575
These were meetings of the
local clergy who would get

00:33:25.575 --> 00:33:29.048
together to hear a sermon,
to debate its doctrine.

00:33:29.048 --> 00:33:31.929
They often opened these
meetings to members of the

00:33:31.929 --> 00:33:32.400
laity.
 

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.041
It was thought to be an
excellent method of improving

00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:37.990
clerical knowledge,
of passing on theological

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:42.066
knowledge to the godly laity,
and in areas of--some areas

00:33:42.066 --> 00:33:45.346
of--the country they were
extremely influential in

00:33:45.346 --> 00:33:48.960
influencing the whole tone of
local religious life.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.150
East Anglia was a great area of
Puritan strength.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.653
There were eight of these
prophesying meetings in the

00:33:54.653 --> 00:33:57.685
county of Suffolk in the middle
of East Anglia and in the county

00:33:57.685 --> 00:34:00.390
of Essex,
just to the south,

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:06.368
there were six of them
operating by the early 1570s.

00:34:06.368 --> 00:34:11.750
But after 1570 Puritanism also
began to acquire something of a

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.250
political edge.
 

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.094
Specifically,
that came in the form of a

00:34:16.094 --> 00:34:20.034
movement to try to formally
alter the structures of the

00:34:20.034 --> 00:34:24.556
Church of England and to purge
the prayer book of what they saw

00:34:24.556 --> 00:34:27.329
as traditional papist survivals.
 

00:34:27.329 --> 00:34:31.465
Those who became involved in it
were convinced that the New

00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:35.599
Testament laid down a clear
model of church government,

00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:39.344
that it did not involve
bishops, that it should be based

00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:43.429
upon autonomous congregations
who elected their own ministers

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.382
and elders,
who would in turn meet together

00:34:46.382 --> 00:34:50.108
at the higher level in councils
and synods to govern the church

00:34:50.108 --> 00:34:50.949
as a whole.
 

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:54.184
In other words,
a Presbyterian system of church

00:34:54.184 --> 00:34:55.099
government.
 

00:34:55.099 --> 00:34:59.762
This is what they desired,
and advocates of such a system

00:34:59.762 --> 00:35:04.259
were to mount a series of
challenges to the Elizabethan

00:35:04.259 --> 00:35:07.340
settlement between 1570 and
1587.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.518
And there were a number of
landmarks in that process.

00:35:10.518 --> 00:35:14.016
In 1570, for example,
the professor of divinity at

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:17.360
the University of Cambridge,
Thomas Cartwright,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.753
gave a series of lectures in
the university in which he

00:35:20.753 --> 00:35:24.461
argued that the English church
failed to follow the model of

00:35:24.461 --> 00:35:28.170
the New Testament and advocated
a Presbyterian system.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.001
There was a tremendous
controversy in the university as

00:35:31.001 --> 00:35:31.579
a result.
 

00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:34.539
Cartwright in fact lost his job.
 

00:35:34.539 --> 00:35:37.385
He was quickly picked up by one
of Elizabeth's favorites,

00:35:37.385 --> 00:35:39.722
the Earl of Leicester,
who sympathized with the

00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:42.110
Puritans, and placed in a living
elsewhere.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.835
So he survived,
but he lost his position at the

00:35:45.835 --> 00:35:46.889
university.
 

00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:51.271
In 1571, in Parliament,
one member, William Strickland,

00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:56.059
introduced a bill to revise the
prayer book and purge it.

00:35:56.059 --> 00:36:02.230
Members of the council sitting
in Parliament opposed this move.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:06.574
He was called before the royal
Privy Council and warned not to

00:36:06.574 --> 00:36:09.994
trespass on the Queen's
prerogative in matters of

00:36:09.994 --> 00:36:10.920
religion.
 

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.487
But a year later when
Parliament met again John Field

00:36:14.487 --> 00:36:17.206
and Thomas Wilcox,
two leading Puritans,

00:36:17.206 --> 00:36:20.250
published the "Admonition
to Parliament,"

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.536
an outspoken attack upon the
structure of the Church of

00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:26.639
England as not being a truly
reformed church,

00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:31.530
calling on Parliament to take
steps to further reform it.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:35.458
Indeed, it was so extreme in
some of its statements that it

00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:39.387
greatly scandalized moderates
amongst Protestants and there

00:36:39.387 --> 00:36:42.300
was no successful action in
Parliament.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.960
In 1576, there came a further
attempt to discuss the church in

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.063
Parliament,
and on that occasion Elizabeth

00:36:49.063 --> 00:36:53.512
had to intervene personally to
ban discussion of religion in

00:36:53.512 --> 00:36:54.570
Parliament.
 

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.858
The Queen also became convinced
in that year that the

00:36:57.858 --> 00:37:01.465
prophesying meetings were a
destabilizing influence on the

00:37:01.465 --> 00:37:03.300
church in the localities.
 

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:07.570
She ordered Archbishop Grindal
to put a stop to them.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.619
The Archbishop protested.
 

00:37:09.619 --> 00:37:12.039
He thought they were doing good
work;

00:37:12.039 --> 00:37:15.079
they were beneficial to the
clergy.

00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:18.601
As a result,
the Queen simply suspended him

00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:23.467
and the Archbishop of Canterbury
himself was suspended from

00:37:23.467 --> 00:37:28.920
exercising his duties from 1577
through to his death in 1583.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.309
Well, at that point,
Grindal's death in 1583 could

00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:38.684
be said in a sense to symbolize
the passing away of the first

00:37:38.684 --> 00:37:42.179
generation of Elizabethan
bishops,

00:37:42.179 --> 00:37:46.161
many of them people who half
sympathized with the desire for

00:37:46.161 --> 00:37:48.929
further reformation within the
church,

00:37:48.929 --> 00:37:52.347
men who had been willing to
serve, willing to bear with the

00:37:52.347 --> 00:37:55.000
Elizabethan compromise for the
time being,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.719
but in their hearts would have
liked to have seen more.

00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:02.512
The phrase that was often used
for people like that was that

00:38:02.512 --> 00:38:06.175
they were willing to "tarry
for the magistrate,"

00:38:06.175 --> 00:38:09.840
they were willing to wait until
such time as the Queen was

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.440
willing to move further in a
Protestant direction.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.690
And they were gradually being
replaced by people of a

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.766
different stamp,
and the most significant of the

00:38:19.766 --> 00:38:23.480
new bishops to emerge was the
new Archbishop of Canterbury,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.230
John Whitgift.
 

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.780
Whitgift was a very different
kind of man from Grindal.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.070
He was a Calvinist in his
doctrine,

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:38.132
no Protestant could ask for
more in terms of his theological

00:38:38.132 --> 00:38:41.188
position,
but he was also a man who had

00:38:41.188 --> 00:38:45.648
grown up with the Elizabethan
settlement and who was deeply

00:38:45.648 --> 00:38:48.800
committed to the settlement in
itself.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.190
In addition to which he was a
firm disciplinarian,

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:56.871
and in 1583 as a means of
preventing further action on the

00:38:56.871 --> 00:39:01.552
part of Puritans Whitgift
introduced what was known as the

00:39:01.552 --> 00:39:06.235
Three Articles to which each of
the clergy was required to

00:39:06.235 --> 00:39:07.550
subscribe.
 

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:11.510
They included recognition of
the royal supremacy,

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:14.844
recognition of the Thirty Nine
Articles of Religion laying down

00:39:14.844 --> 00:39:17.050
the doctrine of the Church of
England,

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:21.978
and taking an oath that there
was nothing in the Prayer Book

00:39:21.978 --> 00:39:25.320
which was contrary to the word
of God.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.349
He proceeded to use the church
courts and particularly his own

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:32.983
Court of High Commission to
examine suspected dissidents

00:39:32.983 --> 00:39:36.617
within the church under oath and
to administer the Three

00:39:36.617 --> 00:39:37.610
Articles.
 

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.596
He was in fact prevented by
members of Elizabeth's council

00:39:40.596 --> 00:39:43.844
sympathetic to the Puritan cause
from taking this policy as far

00:39:43.844 --> 00:39:45.260
as he would have liked.
 

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.045
Nonetheless,
it was a clear statement of his

00:39:49.045 --> 00:39:53.271
unwillingness to tolerate
dissidence from radical

00:39:53.271 --> 00:39:54.679
Protestants.
 

00:39:54.679 --> 00:40:00.603
Well, the advent of Whitgift
perhaps provoked what turned out

00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:05.539
to be the Presbyterian or
Puritans' final throw.

00:40:05.539 --> 00:40:07.923
Some of the prophesying
meetings which were now

00:40:07.923 --> 00:40:09.789
forbidden simply went
underground.

00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:12.277
In some areas they developed
into what's known as the

00:40:12.277 --> 00:40:13.809
"Classis"
movement,

00:40:13.809 --> 00:40:17.599
secret meetings of the clergy
who were practicing a kind of

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:19.559
underground Presbyterianism.
 

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:22.565
John Field, one of the authors
of the "Admonition to

00:40:22.565 --> 00:40:24.070
Parliament"
in 1572,

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.367
built up quite an extensive
network of Presbyterian

00:40:27.367 --> 00:40:31.257
sympathizers amongst the clergy
and the laity throughout the

00:40:31.257 --> 00:40:32.050
kingdom.
 

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:36.429
And that network was activated
in 1584 and 1586 to try to

00:40:36.429 --> 00:40:40.496
introduce further bills into
Parliament calling for a

00:40:40.496 --> 00:40:45.190
Presbyterian system and the
revision of the prayer book.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:48.802
These attempts were again
scotched by royal councilors

00:40:48.802 --> 00:40:50.440
sitting in Parliament.
 

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.539
In 1586, for example,
Parliament itself sent both the

00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:59.429
promoter of the bill and those
who defended it in Parliament to

00:40:59.429 --> 00:41:03.530
the Tower of London briefly to
cool their heels.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.460
The Presbyterians had failed
again.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:10.686
But the exasperation and the
frustration that they felt was

00:41:10.686 --> 00:41:15.204
vividly expressed in 1588 to '89
in the secret publication of a

00:41:15.204 --> 00:41:19.650
number of extremely scurrilous
attacks upon the bishops of the

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.400
Church of England.
 

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.369
These were known as the
Marprelate Tracts.

00:41:24.369 --> 00:41:26.619
They were directed against
bishops, prelates;

00:41:26.619 --> 00:41:31.509
the Marprelate Tracts.
 The Archbishop of

00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:33.882
Canterbury instigated an
investigation to discover the

00:41:33.882 --> 00:41:35.719
secret press that was producing
them,

00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:40.425
and in the course of that John
Field's Puritan network was

00:41:40.425 --> 00:41:44.800
uncovered and the movement was
essentially smashed.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.213
Meanwhile, as the 1580s drew to
a close, some of the leaders of

00:41:49.213 --> 00:41:51.280
Puritanism were dying away.
 

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.179
John Field died in 1588.
 

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:57.635
Some of his sympathizers in the
Royal Council,

00:41:57.635 --> 00:42:01.092
the Duke of Leicester,
Sir Francis Walsingham,

00:42:01.092 --> 00:42:04.780
Sir Walter Mildmay all died in
1589 or 1590.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:11.996
Puritanism as a political
movement was over for the time

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:16.590
being but it left three
legacies.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.235
First of all,
there were small groups of

00:42:19.235 --> 00:42:23.237
Puritan extremists who were so
disillusioned that they broke

00:42:23.237 --> 00:42:27.172
from the Church of England
altogether and formed separatist

00:42:27.172 --> 00:42:29.750
congregations meeting in secret.
 

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.117
One of their leaders said that
they had decided they would have

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.889
"reformation without
tarrying for any."

00:42:35.889 --> 00:42:37.400
They wouldn't tarry for the
magistrate;

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.518
they would have reformation
without tarrying for any.

00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:45.429
Some of them were eventually
forced to flee abroad.

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:48.815
The group led by Robert Browne
based in the city of Norwich

00:42:48.815 --> 00:42:52.085
removed themselves to the
Netherlands to escape potential

00:42:52.085 --> 00:42:53.018
persecution.
 

00:42:53.018 --> 00:42:55.588
Another group led by Henry
Barrow in London went

00:42:55.588 --> 00:42:58.869
underground and some of them
eventually also emigrated to the

00:42:58.869 --> 00:43:01.822
Netherlands where they enjoyed
religious freedom in the

00:43:01.822 --> 00:43:04.119
Protestant areas of the
Netherlands.

00:43:04.119 --> 00:43:06.673
Henry Barrow,
returning to England at one

00:43:06.673 --> 00:43:10.570
point, was arrested and was
eventually hanged for sedition.

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:14.289
It was from amongst these
groups of radical separatists

00:43:14.289 --> 00:43:18.492
who had broken completely with
the Church of England that some

00:43:18.492 --> 00:43:22.213
of the Mayflower Pilgrims of
1620 were eventually to be

00:43:22.213 --> 00:43:23.039
drawn.
 

00:43:23.039 --> 00:43:28.496
So one legacy was separatism,
a tiny minority who broke away

00:43:28.496 --> 00:43:29.699
completely.
 

00:43:29.699 --> 00:43:33.998
Secondly, there was a much
broader legacy of activist

00:43:33.998 --> 00:43:37.469
evangelism within the Church of
England.

00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:41.500
Many Puritan sympathizers felt
that if they could not change

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.804
the structures of the Church of
England then they could at least

00:43:45.804 --> 00:43:49.835
transform its spirit and thereby
leave their own distinctive

00:43:49.835 --> 00:43:53.320
stamp on the nature of English
Protestantism.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.922
They advocated a religion
heavily based upon the Bible:

00:43:57.922 --> 00:44:02.648
advocating preaching,
practicing the sanctification

00:44:02.648 --> 00:44:06.222
of the Sabbath,
insisting upon strict moral

00:44:06.222 --> 00:44:08.931
behavior,
pursuing moral reformation

00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:12.349
where they had the power and the
opportunity,

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:16.914
and they constantly drummed
upon the theme of the failure of

00:44:16.914 --> 00:44:20.932
England to live up to the--
to show proper gratitude for

00:44:20.932 --> 00:44:23.150
God's deliverance of the
kingdom,

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:28.425
the need to turn to a more
strict religious observation in

00:44:28.425 --> 00:44:30.739
return for God's favor.
 

00:44:30.739 --> 00:44:33.389
So that was the second legacy.
 

00:44:33.389 --> 00:44:37.550
Thirdly, there was a legacy of
a different kind.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.681
Some of those who had defended
the Elizabethan settlement from

00:44:41.681 --> 00:44:46.016
Puritan attacks began to develop
an altogether more positive view

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:48.320
of the Elizabethan settlement.
 

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.989
They began to see it not just
as a temporary compromise,

00:44:52.989 --> 00:44:57.360
but as a distinctive and valid
alternative,

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.478
a distinctive middle way
between Catholicism on the one

00:45:02.478 --> 00:45:06.840
hand and radical Protestantism
on the other.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.887
Theologians like Richard Hooker
and Richard Bancroft saw the

00:45:10.887 --> 00:45:14.661
retention of a traditionalist
structure in the Church of

00:45:14.661 --> 00:45:18.159
England as not simply a matter
of convenience,

00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:22.476
or political expediency,
but as a valid Protestant

00:45:22.476 --> 00:45:23.710
alternative.
 

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.753
Indeed, in Bancroft's view,
a divinely ordained form of

00:45:27.753 --> 00:45:32.094
church government in which
England maintained the tradition

00:45:32.094 --> 00:45:35.389
which descended from Christ's
apostles,

00:45:35.389 --> 00:45:39.264
purified of the corruptions
which had crept in in the

00:45:39.264 --> 00:45:40.980
Catholic Middle Ages.
 

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.369
So a new and more positive
notion of Anglicanism as a

00:45:44.369 --> 00:45:48.021
middle way was also emerging
amongst the defenders of the

00:45:48.021 --> 00:45:48.739
church.
 

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:52.565
Diarmaid MacCulloch said of
this that "perhaps the

00:45:52.565 --> 00:45:56.815
Anglican gift to the Christian
story is the ability to make a

00:45:56.815 --> 00:45:58.940
virtue of necessity."
 

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.809
&gt;
 

00:46:01.809 --> 00:46:07.304
But what finally about those
who were neither Catholics nor

00:46:07.304 --> 00:46:12.990
radical Puritans nor Anglican
divines, the mass of the people

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.360
down in the parishes?
 

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.972
It's been said that for most of
them the reformation under

00:46:19.972 --> 00:46:23.775
Elizabeth was essentially a
series of conforming

00:46:23.775 --> 00:46:25.070
experiences.
 

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:30.333
A slow shift from the visual
and ritual and symbolic richness

00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:34.809
of late medieval religion to a
somewhat plainer,

00:46:34.809 --> 00:46:38.204
more verbal,
religion based on the English

00:46:38.204 --> 00:46:40.978
Bible,
based on the Prayer Book of

00:46:40.978 --> 00:46:45.260
1559, including such things as
more frequent preaching,

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:49.550
psalm singing,
and other novel practices.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:53.166
That process of gradual shift
in religious culture was

00:46:53.166 --> 00:46:57.056
probably aided by the elements
of continuity observable in

00:46:57.056 --> 00:47:01.219
Church of England services and
gradually it did its work.

00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:05.407
The older generation of both
the clergy and the laity who

00:47:05.407 --> 00:47:10.268
could remember the old days had
largely died away by the 1580s.

00:47:10.268 --> 00:47:15.315
An increasing proportion of the
population knew no other church

00:47:15.315 --> 00:47:17.349
than that of Elizabeth.
 

00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:20.579
They faced no serious threat
from the Catholic mission.

00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:23.927
The Catholic missionary priests
concentrated their attention on

00:47:23.927 --> 00:47:25.710
politically significant people.
 

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.460
Most of their work was done
amongst the gentry,

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.630
there was no real mission to
the common people,

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:36.295
and by 1603 the Church of
England had something like two

00:47:36.295 --> 00:47:41.641
and a half million communicants
while there were only some 8,000

00:47:41.641 --> 00:47:44.949
to 9,000 known Catholic
recusants,

00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:48.721
most of them members of the
gentry or their immediate

00:47:48.721 --> 00:47:51.840
tenants sheltered under their
protection.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.822
To this extent one could say
that the Catholic threat was

00:47:55.822 --> 00:47:57.460
actually diminishing.
 

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:02.186
Meanwhile, the Anglican clergy
were gradually adapting to their

00:48:02.186 --> 00:48:04.550
role as pastors and teachers.
 

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:07.594
Initially, there'd been a
severe shortage of preachers and

00:48:07.594 --> 00:48:10.844
of educated clergy,
but steady work by the bishops,

00:48:10.844 --> 00:48:14.460
steady work ordaining young men
in the universities,

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.284
meant that by the death of
Elizabeth preaching was

00:48:17.284 --> 00:48:19.820
commonplace in most areas of the
kingdom,

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:23.159
the clergy were increasingly
university graduates;

00:48:23.159 --> 00:48:27.340
their level of learning was
improving.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.672
The more severe and the more
demanding of the clergy could be

00:48:30.672 --> 00:48:34.340
highly critical of the religious
attitudes of the common people.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.179
Some of them saw the common
people as being perhaps

00:48:38.179 --> 00:48:41.545
de-Catholicized,
perhaps hostile to papal

00:48:41.545 --> 00:48:44.844
authority,
but scarcely Protestantized in

00:48:44.844 --> 00:48:47.268
any deep and meaningful sense.
 

00:48:47.268 --> 00:48:51.496
But perhaps that's too harsh a
judgment on people who have been

00:48:51.496 --> 00:48:55.108
nicely described as 'parish
Anglicans' or 'prayer book

00:48:55.108 --> 00:48:58.068
Anglicans',
building up a loyalty for the

00:48:58.068 --> 00:49:01.159
form of religion with which they
were familiar.

00:49:01.159 --> 00:49:03.965
By the 1590s,
it's likely that they certainly

00:49:03.965 --> 00:49:07.474
thought of themselves as being
members of the Protestant

00:49:07.474 --> 00:49:10.280
family,
as it were, even if their

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.853
theological grasp on exactly
what that meant was probably

00:49:14.853 --> 00:49:16.159
rather shaky.
 

00:49:16.159 --> 00:49:20.501
At the same time of course it
remained the case that Puritans

00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:24.264
saw the reformation as
essentially unfinished amongst

00:49:24.264 --> 00:49:26.289
the population at large.
 

00:49:26.289 --> 00:49:28.378
And there were a fair number of
people who shared that

00:49:28.378 --> 00:49:30.561
perception--
that it remained

00:49:30.561 --> 00:49:36.889
unfinished--for the audience of
the godly preachers was by 1603

00:49:36.889 --> 00:49:41.487
significantly larger,
significantly more literate,

00:49:41.487 --> 00:49:45.726
significantly more likely to
have a better knowledge of the

00:49:45.726 --> 00:49:49.829
Bible and of the prayer book,
significantly more likely to

00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:53.447
have read some of the English
language religious publications

00:49:53.447 --> 00:49:57.309
in the Puritan tradition which
were pouring from the presses;

00:49:57.309 --> 00:50:01.780
people more deeply involved in
a vernacular religious culture,

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.780
much of it produced by Puritans
who had abandoned their

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:10.076
political opposition but who had
emerged as the most active

00:50:10.076 --> 00:50:13.001
evangelicals,
the most earnest,

00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:18.525
the most godly counselors of
the Protestant tradition in the

00:50:18.525 --> 00:50:19.650
parishes.
 

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:24.143
At this level the later
reformation was perhaps mostly

00:50:24.143 --> 00:50:28.384
un-dramatic except in the
private drama of people's

00:50:28.384 --> 00:50:30.420
personal conversion.
 

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:35.820
But if the situation of 1600
was one of relative calm it was

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:39.849
also storing up the seeds of
future drama.

00:50:39.849 --> 00:50:44.025
Protestantism was gradually
working its way into popular

00:50:44.025 --> 00:50:46.630
culture,
the Puritan minority was

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:51.000
extending its influence,
not as a political movement but

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.610
as a widespread religious style.
 

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:58.498
Hostility to what was described
as 'popery' was increasingly

00:50:58.498 --> 00:51:01.929
widespread,
and tensions remained regarding

00:51:01.929 --> 00:51:05.739
what the nature of English
Protestantism should be.

00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:08.521
And they would give rise,
as we will see later,

00:51:08.521 --> 00:51:11.726
to what have been called
England's wars of religion in

00:51:11.726 --> 00:51:13.420
the seventeenth century.
 

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:17.389
Disputes not between Catholics
and Protestants--

00:51:17.389 --> 00:51:20.960
that was perhaps largely
settled by 1600--

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:28.416
but disputes between different
conceptions of what it was to be

00:51:28.416 --> 00:51:30.219
a Protestant.
 

00:51:30.219 --> 00:51:30.565
Okay.
 

00:51:30.565 --> 00:51:34.300
And next time I'll turn to
other aspects of Elizabeth's

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.382
reign and in particular the
modes of political participation

00:51:38.382 --> 00:51:42.119
and the queen's relationship
with her counselors.

00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:47.000

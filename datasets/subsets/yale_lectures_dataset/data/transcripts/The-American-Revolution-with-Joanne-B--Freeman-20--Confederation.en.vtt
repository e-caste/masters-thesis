00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.185
Prof: So today I've
titled the lecture for today

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:07.591
"Confederation,"
but in a sense I'm going to be

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:10.390
talking about something larger
than that,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.536
and by the end of the lecture
I'll be talking about the

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:13.650
Articles of Confederation.
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.540
I'll talk a little bit more
about them on Thursday.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.665
But as I mentioned last
Thursday, last Thursday's

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:24.377
lecture,
today's lecture and actually

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:28.290
some of the few that are left --
that are still to come--are all

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.153
in one way or another dealing
with big questions that were

00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:36.490
left looming after the fighting
of the Revolution had passed.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.500
And we dealt with one of them
on Thursday and that was the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.300
question of what would happen to
American society,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.801
and I looked at that in a very
specific way but I was touching

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.600
on that broader question,
which is: okay,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.010
so we've had a Revolution;
what does that do?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.890
And we sort of explored some
things it did or didn't do.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.364
Today I'm going to discuss a
different big question left over

00:00:56.364 --> 00:00:59.549
after the fighting and actually
going on even during the

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.343
fighting,
and that is the question of

00:01:02.343 --> 00:01:05.430
what would happen to American
governance;

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.893
how would independence from
Great Britain actually affect

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:12.233
the way that the states
individually functioned and the

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.769
way that they were governed
together?

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:19.004
And it's not--obviously it's
not just a question of little

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.680
political technicalities
because,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.542
as people at the time really
knew, aside from the obvious

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:29.129
task of winning the war and
gaining independence,

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:31.849
it was really political change.
 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.230
It was the shaping of new state
governments and the creation of

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.470
some kind of a new national or
American government that would

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.780
most shape the real outcome of
the Revolution as a whole.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.050
As Jefferson put it right in
the middle of the Revolution,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.617
"In truth a new government
is the whole object of the

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:52.370
present controversy."
 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.720
See, I love finding quotes from
Founders in which I think to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.110
myself I need a Founder to say
that politics is important.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.650
Oh, there's Thomas Jefferson
now.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.364
[laughs]
A new government "is the

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:03.310
whole object of the present
controversy;

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.602
for should a bad government be
instituted for us in the future

00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:09.626
it had been as well to have
accepted at first the bad one

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:12.596
offered to us from beyond the
water without the risk and

00:02:12.596 --> 00:02:14.270
expence of contest."
 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.622
So basically,
as people at the time well

00:02:17.622 --> 00:02:19.918
knew,
it was in the creation of

00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:23.712
governments in the states and
one for all of the states that

00:02:23.712 --> 00:02:26.930
the Revolution ultimately would
be lost or won.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.641
We're going to hear this --
people talking about the 1780s,

00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.262
when they're a little alarmed
at what is happening in the

00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:32.729
1780s.
 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.030
They're going to repeat that
sentiment,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.254
like: 'uh oh,
we thought we won and now we're

00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:38.937
going to lose because
everything's going to fall apart

00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:40.910
because of problems of
government.'

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.793
So on a really immediate level,
Americans knew that if they

00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:47.471
wanted to win the war in a
broader sense,

00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:50.348
they had to have effective
governments.

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:54.013
And obviously also in the
longer term, they needed

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:57.301
effective governments to
survive, to prosper,

00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:59.770
to last more than five years.
 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.376
It's fascinating when you look
at letters between these people

00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:06.449
in the first couple years under
the Constitution,

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.469
and they're really not
convinced it's going to last

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.449
more than a few years:
nifty little experiment;

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.180
maybe it's not going to work.
 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.068
So people understood government
is the key.

00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:20.147
So when the colonies declared
independence in 1776 and these

00:03:20.147 --> 00:03:24.555
former colonies became states,
they needed to create new state

00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:28.805
governments that would basically
write the royal government out

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:30.930
of their form of governance.
 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.238
And they--each state now needed
to come up with a new way to

00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:36.760
govern itself,
or some decision about how they

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.780
were going to govern themselves.
 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.348
So from roughly 1776 through
the 1780s,

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:46.998
the individual states,
and as we'll see in a little

00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:49.218
bit,
the Continental Congress,

00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:52.638
grappled with trying to figure
out the best mode of

00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:56.535
establishing new governments
according to prevailing hopes

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:57.628
and ideals.
 

00:03:57.628 --> 00:04:01.798
And this whole period was
really a remarkable period of

00:04:01.798 --> 00:04:03.960
political experimentation.
 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.218
As Benjamin Franklin said,
"We are,

00:04:07.218 --> 00:04:10.169
I think, in the right Road of
the spirit of Improvement,

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.889
for we are making
Experiments."

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.438
Right? There's a man of science.
 

00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:17.588
Basically, in this whole
period, not just the Revolution

00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:20.050
but a little before and
certainly after,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.512
fueled by the optimism of the
Revolution and fueled by the

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:25.759
whole spirit of the
Enlightenment,

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.089
this was an age of experiments
in government.

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:33.874
And--I always find when I try
to get across what it felt like

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:36.720
at that time,
how people thought about

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.716
politics at that time,
I'm always sort of trying to

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:42.379
figure out some great metaphor,
something that I can say,

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.259
and I always come back to the
same comparison,

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.908
which somehow,
at least in the last five or

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:50.050
six years,
has always been true.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.365
And that is,
in a sense to get a feeling for

00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:55.810
what it felt like to think about
politics and experience politics

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.661
in the late eighteenth century,
think about how we now

00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:03.050
experience and think about
technology.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.103
Okay, because basically they
could announce tomorrow that

00:05:06.103 --> 00:05:09.377
Apple was secretly coming up
with a device that allows you to

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:11.449
see inside every home in
America,

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.995
and we would go,
'Oh, interesting,' but we would

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:15.730
accept that maybe that exists.
 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.937
There's--On our part there's a
sort of expectation that new

00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:22.089
technological innovations are
popping up all the time,

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.281
and they might have us doing or
thinking things that we never

00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:27.189
did before.
 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:28.439
We're communicating in new ways.
 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.730
Technology I think for us is
this realm where anything can

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.367
happen and things are happening
all the time and we're adjusting

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:37.850
and we're excited and we're
interested.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.108
And that's where a lot of the
innovation is now with people

00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:44.940
sort of trying to pour--
every app-maker in America --

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.680
people creating and innovating
and devising and creating.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.370
And that kind of spirit --
transport that back to the late

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.730
eighteenth century.
 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.810
That's the way that people were
feeling about government.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.418
That was the period in which
government was doing all of

00:06:00.418 --> 00:06:01.129
those things.
 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.060
There were innovations.
 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.588
There were--It was experimental.
 

00:06:04.588 --> 00:06:06.579
People didn't know what was
going to happen.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:09.678
They were challenging rules of
government and sort of seeing

00:06:09.678 --> 00:06:10.730
what would happen.
 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.019
It was--Particularly for people
who were interested in politics,

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:17.098
it was a fascinating sort of
wonderful time because all of

00:06:17.098 --> 00:06:20.069
these weird things were
happening and they were big,

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.060
literally constitutional things
on a really big level.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.144
And you can hear this kind of
excitement in a statement that

00:06:28.144 --> 00:06:32.367
John Adams wrote in 1776 in a
pamphlet that I'll be discussing

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:35.853
in a few minutes,
and it's titled Thoughts on

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:39.649
Government, and Adams
wrote: "You and I,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.115
my dear Friend,
have been sent into life at a

00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:45.589
time when the greatest lawgivers
of antiquity would have wished

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.521
to have lived.--
How few of the human race have

00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:52.266
ever enjoyed an opportunity of
making an election of government

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:52.629
...
 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:55.490
for themselves or their
children."

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.411
People knew that what they were
doing at that time was a big

00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:03.000
deal, and they knew it could
effect enormous change.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.800
So what I'm going to be talking
about today,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.420
in that spirit,
are these experiments in

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.622
government --
people experimenting in

00:07:09.622 --> 00:07:11.887
government --
and I'm going to talk about

00:07:11.887 --> 00:07:14.278
these kinds of experiments on
two levels.

00:07:14.278 --> 00:07:17.625
First, I'll talk about state
constitution-making and how

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:21.519
people were trying to figure out
what to do on a state level,

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:24.625
and then I'll discuss the
process of joining all of these

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.730
states together into some kind
of a confederation or,

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.379
as the Articles of
Confederation themselves put it,

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:33.370
a "league of
friendship."

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.185
That's how the government
defined itself -- the Articles

00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:37.620
-- a league of friendship.
 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.459
But I want to start with state
constitutions --

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.161
and the fact is,
although to us we think

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:45.420
"constitution"
is sort of the big,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.050
looming thing that's important
in that period,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.201
to people at the time,
certainly in the middle of the

00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:52.817
Revolution,
it was really in the drafting

00:07:52.817 --> 00:07:56.718
of state constitutions that they
really thought the future of the

00:07:56.718 --> 00:07:59.339
American people was going to be
decided.

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:05.235
Even before the formal
Declaration of Independence in

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:08.440
July of 1776,
already people in the colonies

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.363
had been giving some thought to
the fact that they were going to

00:08:11.363 --> 00:08:13.913
need new state constitutions
because already things were

00:08:13.913 --> 00:08:15.851
unstable,
sources of authority--royal

00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:18.413
sources of authority--
were not necessarily in place,

00:08:18.413 --> 00:08:21.120
but it was unclear what was in
place instead of them.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.668
So people already saw the need
for some kind of new legitimate

00:08:24.668 --> 00:08:27.170
source of authority and they
began thinking:

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.086
'okay,
well, if we do end up being

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:32.067
independent we need some kind of
a new government so we'd better

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:34.668
start talking about it now
because sooner or later,

00:08:34.668 --> 00:08:37.067
probably sooner,
we're going to actually have to

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:38.240
implement something.'
 

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.875
So as early as the beginning of
1776, states began considering

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:47.510
what they should do about the
unsettled state of governance in

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.259
their own colonies.
 

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:52.441
And some colonies actually
wrote to the Continental

00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:55.876
Congress asking for advice on
what they should do about

00:08:55.876 --> 00:08:57.850
governance in their colony.
 

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.284
And there were some people in
the Continental Congress that

00:09:01.284 --> 00:09:04.068
suggested: 'well,
you guys should take some kind

00:09:04.068 --> 00:09:06.590
of an interim measure;
things aren't sorted out yet

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.480
with England' we don't know
what's going to happen --

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.962
sort of do something to tide
you over until we figure out

00:09:11.962 --> 00:09:13.269
what's coming next.
 

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:16.594
But there were others who were
more radical in their politics

00:09:16.594 --> 00:09:19.697
in the Continental Congress who
thought that the colonies

00:09:19.697 --> 00:09:23.299
actually should really establish
new political institutions,

00:09:23.299 --> 00:09:25.220
basically new constitutions.
 

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.658
More conservative Congressmen
argued that adopting new forms

00:09:29.658 --> 00:09:34.100
of government would be as good
as declaring independence.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.320
Even if independence hadn't
been declared,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.678
if the colonies start creating
their own constitutions,

00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:42.445
these conservatives are
arguing, that's just as good as

00:09:42.445 --> 00:09:45.260
saying you're independent and
it's going to make sort of

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.590
reconciling with England even
harder if you begin to do that.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.884
Even so, in May of 1776,
the Continental Congress

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:58.610
adopted a resolution saying that
colonial assemblies should adopt

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.399
new governments.
 

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:04.620
And just as the conservatives
in Congress argued,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.210
certainly to John Adams and
many others,

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:12.682
that resolution was what really
was the instrument of American

00:10:12.682 --> 00:10:14.028
independence.
 

00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:16.333
That's--To Adams,
he saw that resolution as a

00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:19.528
really key turning point when
the Continental Congress said to

00:10:19.528 --> 00:10:23.395
the colonies becoming states,
'I think it's time that you

00:10:23.395 --> 00:10:26.408
should devise your own
constitutions.'

00:10:26.408 --> 00:10:29.452
Now it's important to note,
the Continental Congress wasn't

00:10:29.452 --> 00:10:30.450
in the lead here.
 

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.715
What happened is that colonies
were asking them what to do and

00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:36.980
Congress sort of responded and
figured out what it thought and

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.639
then made a recommendation.
 

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.480
So states were thinking about
government before the

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.720
Continental Congress necessarily
did anything about it.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.226
The first new constitution had
already been drafted in New

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:54.941
Hampshire in January of 1776,
making it the first written

00:10:54.941 --> 00:10:58.004
constitution drawn up by one of
the colonies without

00:10:58.004 --> 00:11:01.610
consultation with or approval of
the Crown or Parliament.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.306
So the states are all occupied
with constitution-making,

00:11:06.306 --> 00:11:09.210
and that continued through
1777.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.081
Now at first,
people in the Congress were

00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:16.533
undecided about whether maybe it
would be smart to recommend to

00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:19.908
all of the colonies one model
constitution;

00:11:19.908 --> 00:11:22.739
maybe they should come up with
one model, and sort of send it

00:11:22.739 --> 00:11:25.191
out and say, 'Here's what we
think the best kind of a

00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:26.370
government would be.'
 

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.052
But after a brief debate,
the idea went nowhere,

00:11:29.052 --> 00:11:31.278
and that's basically for two
reasons.

00:11:31.278 --> 00:11:32.908
I think one of them is really
obvious,

00:11:32.908 --> 00:11:35.912
which is what is the likelihood
that everybody in that Congress

00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:38.817
was going to agree on what a
model constitution ought to look

00:11:38.817 --> 00:11:40.320
like for all of the states?
 

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.940
Okay, not.
 

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.389
On a purely pragmatic level,
that would be very hard to do.

00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:47.408
But second and more important
than that,

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:51.482
the Congress ultimately felt
that people in each colony or

00:11:51.482 --> 00:11:55.628
each state should really be
adopting and devising their own

00:11:55.628 --> 00:11:59.629
governments that really suited
their own character,

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:03.250
their own habits,
their own specific needs --

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.110
local conditions.
 

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.649
So really, it was the colonies
themselves who were best suited.

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:10.870
It wasn't a smart idea to the
Congress ultimately for them to

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.202
be imposing a model anything,
since part of the purpose of

00:12:14.202 --> 00:12:17.774
the Revolution was for people to
devise governments that suited

00:12:17.774 --> 00:12:18.639
them better.
 

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:22.278
And in making this suggestion,
that each colony should be free

00:12:22.278 --> 00:12:25.557
to create a constitution that
reflected their particular

00:12:25.557 --> 00:12:28.658
values and habits,
the Congress was pretty much

00:12:28.658 --> 00:12:32.115
acting in accordance with a
prevailing belief at the time

00:12:32.115 --> 00:12:34.914
that there was,
or certainly that there should

00:12:34.914 --> 00:12:37.948
be, an intimate connection
between the values of a people

00:12:37.948 --> 00:12:39.697
--
between the habits of a people

00:12:39.697 --> 00:12:42.554
on the one hand and between
their instruments of government

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:44.279
and systems of law on the other.
 

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:45.409
It's a general assumption.
 

00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:46.909
One shapes the other.
 

00:12:46.909 --> 00:12:48.808
One should shape the other.
 

00:12:48.808 --> 00:12:51.274
And that's part of the
assumption that the Continental

00:12:51.274 --> 00:12:52.389
Congress is acting on.
 

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:56.567
But just because Congress
didn't design a model

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:59.909
constitution,
it doesn't mean that individual

00:12:59.909 --> 00:13:03.630
Continental congressmen didn't
begin thinking about what ought

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.620
to be happening in their own
states back home.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.700
And in fact,
so many Continental congressmen

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.794
became so obsessed with the idea
of state constitution-making for

00:13:11.794 --> 00:13:14.504
their own states that some
people feared that some of the

00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:17.309
basic demands of the Revolution
were falling by the wayside

00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:20.572
because everyone was saying,
'Oh, well, back home they're

00:13:20.572 --> 00:13:21.940
making up a constitution.
 

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.610
That's amazing and I have some
ideas about that.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.678
Maybe I should even go back
there.

00:13:26.678 --> 00:13:26.874
Okay.
 

00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:29.246
Maybe not, but I'll send them
some ideas about what they ought

00:13:29.246 --> 00:13:29.870
to be doing.'
 

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.320
So these delegates in the
Continental Congress are

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.921
extremely interested,
for really obvious reasons,

00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:37.620
in what's being devised back in
their home colony,

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.740
their home state.
 

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.457
One result of this obsession
with constitution-making was

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:46.580
this pamphlet I mentioned a few
moments ago,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.990
which ends up being an
important and influential

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.964
pamphlet written by John Adams
that's titled Thoughts on

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:55.591
Government.
Now Adams had long been really

00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:58.889
interested in constitutional
issues,

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:01.678
and he actually had something
of a reputation for being

00:14:01.678 --> 00:14:04.470
someone who was pretty
knowledgeable on the subject.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.599
So when these states began
talking about new constitutions

00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:13.384
beginning at the very,
very end of 1775 going through

00:14:13.384 --> 00:14:16.196
1776,
several men from different

00:14:16.196 --> 00:14:19.860
states came to him to ask his
advice: 'Hey,

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.590
you're the guy who knows a lot
about constitutions.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.740
What do you think we ought to
be doing, Mr. Adams?'

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.101
So Adams -- so many people
asked him, that he wrote up what

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:32.808
he called a sketch of what a new
constitution might look like.

00:14:32.808 --> 00:14:34.918
And he gave the sketch out to a
few people.

00:14:34.918 --> 00:14:36.942
'Well, you want to know what I
think a new constitution ought

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:37.450
to look like?
 

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.168
Here you go, my best idea.'
 

00:14:40.168 --> 00:14:41.677
Well, obviously,
if everyone's casting about

00:14:41.677 --> 00:14:44.236
like: 'I don't know what to do,
what should I say' -- and one

00:14:44.236 --> 00:14:46.937
guy pipes up and says,
'I think this is a pretty good

00:14:46.937 --> 00:14:50.178
idea,' not surprisingly other
people went to Adams and said,

00:14:50.178 --> 00:14:51.798
'Hey, I'd like a copy of that
sketch too.

00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:55.230
I'd like to see what your model
constitution looks like.'

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.826
So by April of 1776,
Adams had turned this sketch

00:14:58.826 --> 00:15:00.399
into this pamphlet.
 

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.599
The full title of his pamphlet
is one of these great

00:15:02.599 --> 00:15:05.053
eighteenth-century titles,
Thoughts on Government

00:15:05.053 --> 00:15:07.943
Applicable to the Present State
of the American Colonies in a

00:15:07.943 --> 00:15:09.918
Letter From a Gentleman to his
Friend.

00:15:09.918 --> 00:15:11.928
We can call it Thoughts
on Government.

00:15:11.928 --> 00:15:14.688
[laughs]
Now besides the obvious

00:15:14.688 --> 00:15:18.474
practical use the pamphlet,
and I'm going to come back to

00:15:18.474 --> 00:15:20.278
some of the things he recommends
in a minute,

00:15:20.278 --> 00:15:23.917
Adams also intended it to be a
response to the concluding

00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:27.554
section of Thomas Paine's
Common Sense published a

00:15:27.554 --> 00:15:29.048
few months earlier.
 

00:15:29.048 --> 00:15:30.976
And you'll remember the
wonderful opinion that John

00:15:30.976 --> 00:15:32.480
Adams registered on Common
Sense,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.210
quote, "A poor
ignorant,

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.690
Malicious, short-sighted,
Crapulous Mass."

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.899
[laughs] Thank you, John Adams.
 

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:44.124
So Adams basically thought that
that final section of Common

00:15:44.124 --> 00:15:48.000
Sense was irresponsible and
impractical;

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.918
it was giving ideas about
forming a new government that

00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:53.370
didn't make sense.
 

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.601
And if you remember,
Paine had said that there

00:15:55.601 --> 00:15:58.586
should be a unicameral --
a one-house legislature for

00:15:58.586 --> 00:16:01.850
each of the colonies,
and that would be--all of those

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.210
would be subordinate to a
unicameral legislature like the

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.649
Continental Congress.
 

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:10.500
No level of government would
have an independent executive.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.610
So basically as Adams is
thinking about it,

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.626
Paine is just tossing off
separation of powers and the

00:16:15.626 --> 00:16:18.743
balance of powers and saying,
Eh, we don't need to think

00:16:18.743 --> 00:16:19.340
about that.
 

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.330
We should be thinking about the
people.'

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:21.535
Right?
 

00:16:21.535 --> 00:16:23.528
'We should be thinking about
making a government responsive

00:16:23.528 --> 00:16:24.798
to people,' which is a nice
idea,

00:16:24.798 --> 00:16:28.456
but Adams thought,
in reality there's no way that

00:16:28.456 --> 00:16:30.210
that's going to work.
 

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.485
Adams and others,
though they valued what Paine

00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:36.261
had to say obviously about
independence,

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:39.038
did not appreciate that whole
plan.

00:16:39.038 --> 00:16:41.860
And in Thoughts on
Government, Adams

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.370
argued that whatever the states
did with these new governments

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.537
they should at least preserve
the best of Anglo-American

00:16:48.537 --> 00:16:51.596
traditions of government,
and particularly,

00:16:51.596 --> 00:16:53.168
separation of powers.
 

00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:57.547
Adams really did not like the
idea of having a one-house

00:16:57.547 --> 00:17:00.889
assembly and having no executive
at all.

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:05.019
He argued that there was no way
that that could work well;

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:07.240
a one-house legislature would
never be effective;

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.000
it could never do anything
executive;

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.368
it could never do anything
judicial.

00:17:11.368 --> 00:17:14.308
As he put it,
a one-house legislature could

00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:17.634
not act as an executive power,
quote, "for want of two

00:17:17.634 --> 00:17:21.068
essential properties,
secrecy and despatch."

00:17:21.068 --> 00:17:21.367
Okay.
 

00:17:21.367 --> 00:17:23.460
That's what executives need to
be;

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.269
no congress will ever manage
those two things.

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:29.019
He also said that a one-house
legislature couldn't be a

00:17:29.019 --> 00:17:31.670
judicial power because it was
"too numerous,

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.890
too slow, and too little
skilled in the laws."

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.883
And just as bad to Adams,
a unicameral legislature was

00:17:39.883 --> 00:17:42.368
just unstable in and of itself.
 

00:17:42.368 --> 00:17:44.818
As he put it,
it was "liable to all the

00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:47.608
vices, follies,
and frailties of an individual;

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:50.818
subject to fits of humor,
starts of passion,

00:17:50.818 --> 00:17:53.558
flights of enthusiasm,
partialities,

00:17:53.558 --> 00:17:55.690
or prejudice,
and consequently productive of

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.818
hasty results and absurd
judgments."

00:17:57.818 --> 00:18:00.281
I think that sounds like a
quote from a guy who's really

00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:01.670
tired of being in congresses.
 

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.690
He was like:
'I know what congresses do.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.019
[laughs]
This unicameral legislature,

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.130
bad idea.'
 

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.951
He really preferred a bicameral
legislature, both houses of

00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:15.528
which would elect a governor.
 

00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:18.507
The governor would have a veto
over legislation,

00:18:18.507 --> 00:18:22.055
and could appoint judges and
some other officers with the

00:18:22.055 --> 00:18:24.019
consent of the upper house.
 

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:27.880
Judges would have tenure for
life during good behavior.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.871
And all officials apart from
judges would be elected annually

00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:35.730
to prevent an aristocratic
ruling class from rising up,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.134
and to keep politicians humble
because they'd have to go home

00:18:39.134 --> 00:18:42.729
every year and get reelected,
and to Adams that would

00:18:42.729 --> 00:18:45.670
successfully keep politicians
humble.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.330
Rotation in office would be
something that would keep the

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.618
right spirit of government
going.

00:18:51.618 --> 00:18:54.612
Now it's hard to say how much
direct influence Thoughts on

00:18:54.612 --> 00:18:55.660
Government had.
 

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.410
It's always very hard.
 

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.680
You always want to say, 'Wow.
 

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.769
These five states were
extremely influenced.'

00:19:00.769 --> 00:19:03.614
It's hard to say that,
but the fact is that most of

00:19:03.614 --> 00:19:07.028
the state constitutions ended up
being in hailing distance of

00:19:07.028 --> 00:19:10.156
what Adams suggested in that
pamphlet and he did receive

00:19:10.156 --> 00:19:13.230
letters from a number of friends
saying: 'well,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.259
actually that was helpful.
 

00:19:14.259 --> 00:19:15.759
Thank you very much, John Adams.
 

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:17.568
That was actually very helpful.'
 

00:19:17.568 --> 00:19:19.736
So we have this little moment
in which John Adams must have

00:19:19.736 --> 00:19:21.529
been smiling because he's
getting recognition.

00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:22.538
Right? 'Yay.'
 

00:19:22.538 --> 00:19:25.296
He's like: 'I wrote a good
pamphlet and they're saying

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:25.920
thank you.
 

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.630
Yay.' Poor John Adams.
 

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.212
Okay.
 

00:19:29.212 --> 00:19:34.348
So, all this talking about new
governments.

00:19:34.348 --> 00:19:37.496
The fact is,
as I suggested when Adams says

00:19:37.496 --> 00:19:41.840
we should be preserving the best
features of Anglo-American

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.704
governance,
these state constitutions

00:19:44.704 --> 00:19:48.636
generally did preserve some
basic features of Anglo-American

00:19:48.636 --> 00:19:49.568
governance.
 

00:19:49.568 --> 00:19:52.814
So take for example a bicameral
legislature, obviously

00:19:52.814 --> 00:19:56.608
resembling Parliament's House of
Commons and House of Lords.

00:19:56.608 --> 00:20:00.069
Obviously, America did not have
Lords and Commons in quite the

00:20:00.069 --> 00:20:02.000
same way, but the idea remained.
 

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.018
You had two houses and you had
different sets of people in the

00:20:06.018 --> 00:20:07.931
two,
although it was not entirely

00:20:07.931 --> 00:20:10.420
clear what that meant in the
American example,

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.308
and this was actually a source
of confusion.

00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:13.618
When the Constitution first
starts,

00:20:13.618 --> 00:20:16.490
with this new bicameral
legislature,

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.093
people aren't sure if the
Senate is kind of like a House

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:22.477
of Lords,
meaning that the people in the

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:25.460
Senate were sort of higher up
than the representatives.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.858
Should they have special
privileges?

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:30.420
Should there be--Should they
get a higher salary?

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.140
Are they "special
people" in comparison to

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:33.779
the House?
 

00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:36.356
Should we really be making that
kind of difference between the

00:20:36.356 --> 00:20:37.328
House and the Senate?
 

00:20:37.328 --> 00:20:39.598
And you can see this throughout
this period.

00:20:39.598 --> 00:20:41.736
You can see it in somewhat
ridiculous ways,

00:20:41.736 --> 00:20:44.328
but you can see how people were
so focused on it.

00:20:44.328 --> 00:20:47.848
And one example of this is from
1790 --

00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:51.378
so one year of government --
and the Senate wrote some kind

00:20:51.378 --> 00:20:53.916
of a bill,
and they included I suppose

00:20:53.916 --> 00:20:56.700
names of people who had drafted
the bill,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.578
and before the names of the
people they put "the

00:20:59.578 --> 00:21:01.794
honorable,"
like "the honorable

00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:04.065
messieurs,"
and they sent this to the

00:21:04.065 --> 00:21:04.730
House.
 

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.220
The House got this bill.
 

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.640
They didn't even look at the
content of the bill.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.150
They just looked at the bill.
 

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.962
'Why are the Senators calling
themselves "the

00:21:11.962 --> 00:21:12.630
honorable?"
 

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.269
We don't like that.
 

00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:16.000
What's it suggesting about who
they are?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.500
Do they think they're better
than us?

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.940
No, they're not better than us.'
 

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.275
So the House--before it votes
on the content of the

00:21:21.275 --> 00:21:23.190
bill--votes to cut those two
words out.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.453
Right?
 

00:21:23.453 --> 00:21:26.143
That's not going to be on the
document, none of this honorable

00:21:26.143 --> 00:21:26.538
stuff.
 

00:21:26.538 --> 00:21:29.390
Then they pass it,
and it goes back to the Senate,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.307
and the Senate passes another
amendment in which they take

00:21:32.307 --> 00:21:35.173
their names off the document
because they don't want them

00:21:35.173 --> 00:21:37.221
printed without "the
honorable"

00:21:37.221 --> 00:21:38.400
attached to them.
 

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:38.675
Okay.
 

00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:41.048
A seemingly little,
trivial, petty thing,

00:21:41.048 --> 00:21:45.308
but that clearly two parts of
the legislature were focused on,

00:21:45.308 --> 00:21:47.230
and there was even a letter
from Madison--

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.440
and I can't remember who he was
writing to--

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.430
and he says,
'This seems trivial.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.615
[laughs]
It really isn't because it's

00:21:53.615 --> 00:21:56.588
getting down to these kind of
basic questions,

00:21:56.588 --> 00:21:58.828
of exactly what is the House
and what is the Senate,

00:21:58.828 --> 00:22:01.410
and what's their relationship
to the House of Lords,

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.838
the House of Commons.'
 

00:22:02.838 --> 00:22:06.574
So a bicameral legislature is
one tradition that Americans

00:22:06.574 --> 00:22:10.506
held on to, generally speaking,
and I'm going to come back to

00:22:10.506 --> 00:22:11.618
an exception.
 

00:22:11.618 --> 00:22:16.123
A second traditional assumption
that was represented in the new

00:22:16.123 --> 00:22:19.753
state constitutions concerned
the need for property

00:22:19.753 --> 00:22:24.038
requirements for voting and for
holding elected office.

00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:27.211
And the reasoning there being,
men who owned property were

00:22:27.211 --> 00:22:29.650
independent men,
so they could vote for

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:33.163
themselves as they thought
rather than being dependent on

00:22:33.163 --> 00:22:36.613
someone else and thus maybe
having to vote in a way that

00:22:36.613 --> 00:22:39.058
somebody else wanted them to
vote.

00:22:39.058 --> 00:22:41.030
And likewise it was thought
that if you had literally

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.509
financial investment in a
community,

00:22:42.509 --> 00:22:45.506
you were the people best
qualified to affect that

00:22:45.506 --> 00:22:47.380
community through elections.
 

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.992
So though the Revolution would
inspire many states to reduce

00:22:51.992 --> 00:22:56.058
the level of the property
requirement for voting,

00:22:56.058 --> 00:22:59.519
the fact is that those kinds of
restrictions remained in place.

00:22:59.519 --> 00:23:02.480
And on average,
in the new state constitutions,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.172
roughly there was an increase
of fifteen percent in the number

00:23:06.172 --> 00:23:09.083
of adult white males voting --
which in a sense,

00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:11.028
compared I suppose with
England,

00:23:11.028 --> 00:23:14.549
maybe seems a little
bit--somewhat substantial,

00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:16.808
if not revolutionary in scope.
 

00:23:16.808 --> 00:23:18.646
So that was held on to,
as well, as something that

00:23:18.646 --> 00:23:19.808
people felt comfortable with.
 

00:23:19.808 --> 00:23:24.271
It was a precedent,
a tradition that made sense to

00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:24.910
them.
 

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.440
Now there were other ways in
which these constitutions--

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.862
these state
constitutions--rather than

00:23:31.862 --> 00:23:35.321
reflecting traditions,
Anglo-American traditions,

00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:38.967
instead more obviously
reflected the immediate impact

00:23:38.967 --> 00:23:40.440
of the Revolution.
 

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.506
And the first and most obvious
example of that is the simple

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.690
fact that they're writing
constitutions.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.084
Right?
 

00:23:46.084 --> 00:23:49.635
Americans were revealing their
recognition of what they

00:23:49.635 --> 00:23:53.122
believed to be the instability
and lack of security in

00:23:53.122 --> 00:23:55.029
unwritten constitutions.
 

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:57.355
As they looked at Great
Britain, they thought,

00:23:57.355 --> 00:23:59.319
we don't like that system very
much.

00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:00.500
We want everything in writing.
 

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.358
We want it all on paper.
 

00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:06.060
Americans wanted to fix the
principles of their new

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.355
governments in writing in a form
that was distinct from and

00:24:10.355 --> 00:24:13.019
superior to mere legal statutes.
 

00:24:13.019 --> 00:24:17.319
You can also see the immediate
impact of the Revolution in the

00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:21.549
three main ideas that were at
the core of most of these state

00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:26.308
constitutions,
three sort of basic ideas.

00:24:26.308 --> 00:24:29.707
Number one, most of these
constitutions were premised on

00:24:29.707 --> 00:24:33.288
the idea that they had to be
grounded on natural rights.

00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:36.843
And you can really see this
belief reflected in the

00:24:36.843 --> 00:24:40.680
declarations of rights that were
appended to most state

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.960
constitutions.
 

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.680
And again, there is a lot
that's traditional in these

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.050
reclarations of rights,
because a lot of the rights

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.298
that are being declared in these
declarations are traditional

00:24:52.298 --> 00:24:54.980
English rights,
but they're being put in--on

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.066
paper in these documents and
then attached to these sort of

00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:02.727
constitutional statements
creating whatever these new

00:25:02.727 --> 00:25:04.769
states were going to be.
 

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:09.806
Most of these declarations of
rights specified things like the

00:25:09.806 --> 00:25:11.868
right of trial by jury.
 

00:25:11.868 --> 00:25:12.093
Right?
 

00:25:12.093 --> 00:25:13.470
They thought back to the
Revolution.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.826
They remembered those Vice
Admiralty courts,

00:25:15.826 --> 00:25:17.689
not popular,
so now they were like:

00:25:17.689 --> 00:25:20.210
'okay, we want the right of
trial by jury;

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.323
we want the right not to be
deprived of life,

00:25:22.323 --> 00:25:25.204
liberty and property through
the protection of due process of

00:25:25.204 --> 00:25:26.630
law;
freedom of speech,

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.030
freedom of the press,
and in some states like

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.126
Virginia, freedom of religion --
again, rights that are familiar

00:25:32.126 --> 00:25:34.126
to us,
rights that they're putting

00:25:34.126 --> 00:25:37.736
down on paper and attaching to
constitutions at this moment in

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:38.210
time.
 

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:43.450
So declarations of rights were
shared by constitutions,

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.932
this sort of idea that there
are these natural rights that

00:25:45.932 --> 00:25:47.848
need to be written down and
memorialized,

00:25:47.848 --> 00:25:50.662
one of the things that all of
these state constitutions

00:25:50.662 --> 00:25:51.598
generally share.
 

00:25:51.598 --> 00:25:56.215
The other two main ideas that
were at the core of these

00:25:56.215 --> 00:25:58.608
constitutions are related.
 

00:25:58.608 --> 00:26:02.710
So these--the last two ideas
are: most constitutions declared

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.650
that representation is based on
consent,

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.828
again, obviously coming right
out of the Revolution;

00:26:07.828 --> 00:26:11.980
consent is important in the
process of representation.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.234
And then the third and last
basic idea related to that is --

00:26:15.234 --> 00:26:18.655
and maybe it's the most central
one of all -- sovereignty rests

00:26:18.655 --> 00:26:21.950
with the people;
the people are sovereign.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.358
As the Virginia Constitution
declared,

00:26:25.358 --> 00:26:28.460
and a lot of the other states
in one way or another rephrased

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.343
it,
but said something like it:

00:26:30.343 --> 00:26:34.585
"all power is vested in,
and consequently derived from,

00:26:34.585 --> 00:26:37.698
the people;
that the magistrates are their

00:26:37.698 --> 00:26:41.261
trustees and servants,
and at all times amenable to

00:26:41.261 --> 00:26:42.259
them."
 

00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:45.772
The main question about this
was, as John Adams put it at the

00:26:45.772 --> 00:26:49.579
time, "to what extent shall
we carry this principle?"

00:26:49.579 --> 00:26:50.519
Like, 'nice idea.
 

00:26:50.519 --> 00:26:52.400
What does that exactly mean?
 

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.241
How is it going to actually
boil down into what people are

00:26:55.241 --> 00:26:56.088
actually doing?
 

00:26:56.088 --> 00:26:59.420
How beholden should the
government be to the people?'

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.208
And this varied in different
states depending on a number of

00:27:03.208 --> 00:27:05.068
different kinds of factors.
 

00:27:05.068 --> 00:27:09.163
One dramatic way in which you
could really see the sovereignty

00:27:09.163 --> 00:27:13.323
of the people being emphasized
in these new state constitutions

00:27:13.323 --> 00:27:17.348
is through the way in which they
curbed executive power.

00:27:17.348 --> 00:27:20.368
They curbed the power of state
governors.

00:27:20.368 --> 00:27:22.788
They made state governors less
important.

00:27:22.788 --> 00:27:26.537
They usually made the lower
house of their legislatures more

00:27:26.537 --> 00:27:27.298
important.
 

00:27:27.298 --> 00:27:30.373
They often made the upper house
of their legislatures less

00:27:30.373 --> 00:27:31.019
important.
 

00:27:31.019 --> 00:27:36.029
They're really trying to limit
power, to curb power.

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:38.417
Again, that's obviously really
connected to what they had just

00:27:38.417 --> 00:27:41.566
experienced in the Revolution,
which felt to them like this

00:27:41.566 --> 00:27:45.479
sort of monarchical unlimited
power that they had no control

00:27:45.479 --> 00:27:46.009
over.
 

00:27:46.009 --> 00:27:49.088
So they're really worried about
executive power,

00:27:49.088 --> 00:27:52.844
fear of a concentration of
power, fear of executive power

00:27:52.844 --> 00:27:56.328
like the power of the monarch
that they had just--

00:27:56.328 --> 00:27:59.306
or were at least,
were in the process of breaking

00:27:59.306 --> 00:28:00.048
away from.
 

00:28:00.048 --> 00:28:01.655
So as I said,
almost every new state

00:28:01.655 --> 00:28:04.180
constitution increased the power
of the lower house,

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.500
decreased the power of the
governor,

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.486
decreased the power of the
upper house of their

00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:10.460
legislatures.
 

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.890
And, as we'll see in a moment,
the national government that

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.201
ends up being created under the
Articles of Confederation

00:28:17.201 --> 00:28:19.390
follows the same general
pattern.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.413
They just eliminate executive,
and they don't have a judicial

00:28:22.413 --> 00:28:23.220
branch either.
 

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.662
So basically,
everyone's really scared of

00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:28.348
executive power,
of centralized power at this

00:28:28.348 --> 00:28:28.960
point.
 

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.239
Okay.
 

00:28:29.239 --> 00:28:31.700
So summing up what I've just
been discussing,

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.943
in essence: Most new state
constitutions shared a few basic

00:28:34.943 --> 00:28:36.509
institutional features.
 

00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:38.750
They had a bicameral
legislature.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.720
They had a weak executive.
 

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.368
They had rotation in office.
 

00:28:43.368 --> 00:28:48.000
They had--As far as principles
go, a lot of them at least had

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.710
declarations of rights;
the idea that representation

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.019
should be based on consent;
that the government rests on

00:28:55.019 --> 00:28:57.480
the people -- that the people
are sovereign;

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:02.390
a somewhat broader electorate
voting in annual elections.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.840
Now that said,
the most extreme constitutional

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.598
revisions actually took place in
Pennsylvania,

00:29:09.598 --> 00:29:12.363
and Pennsylvania is really
where the constitution

00:29:12.363 --> 00:29:15.355
ultimately reflected the most
radical impulses of the

00:29:15.355 --> 00:29:16.220
Revolution.
 

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.097
The new Pennsylvania
constitution had no property

00:29:20.097 --> 00:29:24.539
requirements for voting,
it had a one-house legislature,

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:28.038
and it had some special
features that clearly,

00:29:28.038 --> 00:29:29.990
to the people who were devising
that constitution,

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.486
were aimed at making the
government as responsible to

00:29:34.486 --> 00:29:37.078
popular consent as possible.
 

00:29:37.078 --> 00:29:39.538
So for example--and this is
kind of wild to me.

00:29:39.538 --> 00:29:42.334
Imagine how many laws would
actually pass if this is the

00:29:42.334 --> 00:29:42.690
case.
 

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.913
For a law to become a law in
Pennsylvania,

00:29:44.913 --> 00:29:48.007
a bill had to be passed in two
consecutive sessions of the

00:29:48.007 --> 00:29:50.720
legislature, so a bill had to be
passed twice.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.875
So--and between those two
sessions, the politicians who

00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:57.326
were passing the bill had to go
home and explain it to their

00:29:57.326 --> 00:29:58.319
constituents.
 

00:29:58.319 --> 00:30:00.240
So you would pass a law.
 

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.196
The representatives would go to
their constituents and explain

00:30:03.196 --> 00:30:05.573
why they liked it,
and then they'd have to go back

00:30:05.573 --> 00:30:06.640
and pass it again.
 

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.031
Right?
 

00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:10.625
Obviously, the idea being:
okay, these people are really

00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:14.481
beholden to their constituents
and nothing's going to happen

00:30:14.481 --> 00:30:17.750
unless the constituents really
approve of it.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:21.395
The Pennsylvania constitution
also created this nifty little

00:30:21.395 --> 00:30:24.240
sort of body called the Council
of Censors,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.630
and this Council of Censors was
kind of like a big grand jury.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.068
It would be elected every seven
years.

00:30:31.068 --> 00:30:35.865
And the job of the Council of
Censors was to evaluate all

00:30:35.865 --> 00:30:38.519
aspects of government action.
 

00:30:38.519 --> 00:30:42.019
So basically,
they create this little body,

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:45.287
and the job of it is to just
police government and make sure

00:30:45.287 --> 00:30:48.554
that everything is above board
and operating in the way it's

00:30:48.554 --> 00:30:50.160
supposed to be operating.
 

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.898
So you can really see,
in comparison with what I was

00:30:51.898 --> 00:30:53.740
just saying about the sort of
generality of these state

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.107
constitutions,
Pennsylvania really has an

00:30:56.107 --> 00:30:59.478
extreme reaction to the
experience of the Revolution

00:30:59.478 --> 00:31:03.180
against what the colonists
perceive to be as tyranny.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.005
So in a sense,
if you think of ideas about

00:31:06.005 --> 00:31:08.900
government as being kind of a
pendulum,

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.491
and on one end you've got sort
of British monarchical

00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:13.372
centralized power,
in Pennsylvania,

00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:16.180
boy, that pendulum went way
over onto the other side.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:21.058
Like, 'we don't want any
centralized executive power;

00:31:21.058 --> 00:31:24.616
we are just going to be over
here sort of experimenting with

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:28.415
this interesting government that
we haven't ever had one like it

00:31:28.415 --> 00:31:29.140
before.'
 

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.788
And, as we'll see as we look at
what happens over the next ten,

00:31:31.788 --> 00:31:35.704
fifteen, seventeen years,
the Constitution in a way

00:31:35.704 --> 00:31:40.640
represents a midpoint between
these two ends of the spectrum.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.154
One last point I want to
discuss about state

00:31:44.154 --> 00:31:48.078
constitutions before we get into
the Articles.

00:31:48.078 --> 00:31:51.053
While all of this state
constitution revision was taking

00:31:51.053 --> 00:31:54.107
place,
there were actually two states

00:31:54.107 --> 00:31:58.339
that were not taking part in it,
not out of protest but because

00:31:58.339 --> 00:32:01.156
their colonial charters actually
had in a sense been more radical

00:32:01.156 --> 00:32:03.048
than the other colonies' to
begin with,

00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:07.068
and of course they are
Connecticut and Rhode Island.

00:32:07.068 --> 00:32:10.078
Continuing theme,
Connecticut and Rhode Island.

00:32:10.078 --> 00:32:12.967
Their colonial charters had
basically made them

00:32:12.967 --> 00:32:15.980
self-governing already in--on a
certain level.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.660
So they didn't have to do
dramatic changes to make them

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.500
into state constitutions.
 

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.900
So they basically--Rhode Island
and Connecticut--

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.253
basically preserved their
colonial charters as

00:32:26.253 --> 00:32:29.236
constitutions and didn't really
change them until into the

00:32:29.236 --> 00:32:30.440
nineteenth century.
 

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:30.837
Okay.
 

00:32:30.837 --> 00:32:35.614
That gets us out of the world
of state constitutions and into

00:32:35.614 --> 00:32:40.548
the world of creating some kind
of government for the new union

00:32:40.548 --> 00:32:44.358
of American states,
and that ends up being the

00:32:44.358 --> 00:32:46.250
Articles of Confederation.
 

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:54.342
Now on July 12,1776,
just after they had declared

00:32:54.342 --> 00:32:58.740
independence,
the Continental Congress also

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.377
was trying to create some kind
of a proposal for a new national

00:33:02.377 --> 00:33:03.200
government.
 

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.848
And between 1776 and 1777,
the Continental Congress

00:33:07.848 --> 00:33:11.568
drafted the Articles of
Confederation.

00:33:11.568 --> 00:33:16.027
And the Articles are the
document that literally created

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:18.538
the United States of America.
 

00:33:18.538 --> 00:33:22.084
They literally gave that name
to the United States of America,

00:33:22.084 --> 00:33:25.338
but it's important that--to
note that they actually meant

00:33:25.338 --> 00:33:26.848
that really literally.
 

00:33:26.848 --> 00:33:29.174
We sort of don't think of what
that phrase means,

00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:30.920
but it was meant really
literally.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.473
In the context of what I'm
talking about now,

00:33:33.473 --> 00:33:36.260
what that said was:
this was not one consolidated

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:36.900
nation.
 

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.642
This was "united states
"--what the articles

00:33:39.642 --> 00:33:41.788
created;
it united some states together.

00:33:41.788 --> 00:33:45.568
That's what that phrase
literally meant.

00:33:45.568 --> 00:33:48.765
As John Adams explained later,
they never thought "of

00:33:48.765 --> 00:33:51.624
consolidating this vast
Continent under one national

00:33:51.624 --> 00:33:54.034
Government"
but instead erected "a

00:33:54.034 --> 00:33:57.250
Confederacy of States,
each of which must have a

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.970
separate Government."
 

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:03.105
So when thirteen free and
independent states had defeated

00:34:03.105 --> 00:34:07.390
England and now had to figure
out how to come together,

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:13.360
they were not thinking of one
big unified republic at this

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.199
point.
 

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.699
They really definitely were
not, and that's--the Articles of

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:16.869
Confederation went along with
that thinking.

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:20.059
It did not create one unified
government;

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:23.936
it did not bond people together
in anything other than a loose

00:34:23.936 --> 00:34:24.510
league.
 

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.146
The Articles created a loose
league of individual republican

00:34:28.146 --> 00:34:29.010
governments.
 

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:34.440
Now if, as the founding
generation assumed,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.590
absolute power corrupts
absolutely,

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.268
then the Articles of
Confederation was a very

00:34:40.268 --> 00:34:43.800
virtuous form of government
because under the Articles,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:50.521
the Confederation Congress had
almost no power to enforce its

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:52.090
will at all.
 

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.873
The newly-created Confederation
was almost more of a United

00:34:55.873 --> 00:34:58.940
Nations than a central governing
institution.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.541
As the Articles themselves
stated, they were intended to

00:35:03.541 --> 00:35:06.552
create, quote,
"a firm league of

00:35:06.552 --> 00:35:08.059
friendship ...
 

00:35:08.059 --> 00:35:10.994
for their common defense,
the security of their

00:35:10.994 --> 00:35:14.570
Liberties, and their mutual and
general welfare."

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:19.402
The Articles were basically a
pact between thirteen sovereign

00:35:19.402 --> 00:35:24.235
states which agreed that certain
powers would be delegated to

00:35:24.235 --> 00:35:29.070
this new central government for
very specific purposes,

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:34.083
but these thirteen sovereign
states retained all powers not

00:35:34.083 --> 00:35:38.059
expressly delegated by them in
the Articles.

00:35:38.059 --> 00:35:40.431
So under the Articles,
the national government

00:35:40.431 --> 00:35:43.487
consisted of a one-chamber
national Congress elected by the

00:35:43.487 --> 00:35:44.699
state legislatures.
 

00:35:44.699 --> 00:35:47.619
Each state had one vote.
 

00:35:47.619 --> 00:35:52.362
Congress could request funds
from the states but it could not

00:35:52.362 --> 00:35:56.869
enact a tax of its own without
every state's approval--

00:35:56.869 --> 00:36:00.688
how likely is that to
happen?--so it could not really

00:36:00.688 --> 00:36:02.230
make its own taxes.
 

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.639
It could not regulate
interstate commerce between the

00:36:05.639 --> 00:36:06.230
states.
 

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.574
The Articles did not provide
for any kind of an executive

00:36:09.574 --> 00:36:12.800
branch or any kind of an
executive character at all.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.300
Instead, Congressional
Committees oversaw anything

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.659
having to do with finance or
diplomacy or military affairs.

00:36:20.659 --> 00:36:24.235
There was no judicial system by
which this new national

00:36:24.235 --> 00:36:27.480
government could compel
allegiance to its laws.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.079
So basically as far as the
powers of Congress were

00:36:31.079 --> 00:36:35.485
concerned, the Confederation
Congress was kind of filling the

00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:37.909
place of the imperial system.
 

00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:40.659
It could regulate foreign
affairs.

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:43.809
It could declare war with
foreign countries.

00:36:43.809 --> 00:36:46.010
It could negotiate peace
treaties.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.559
It could fix standards for
weights and measures.

00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:50.889
It could manage Indian affairs.
 

00:36:50.889 --> 00:36:54.610
It could borrow money although
it couldn't really tax.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:58.501
Basically, the Confederation
Congress had power over war and

00:36:58.501 --> 00:37:02.326
foreign affairs and the states
maintained control over what

00:37:02.326 --> 00:37:05.360
they called "internal
policing."

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.193
Now it's important to realize
that in the context of the time

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:12.514
when they were created,
the Articles of Confederation

00:37:12.514 --> 00:37:14.559
actually make perfect sense.
 

00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:16.731
I think it's really easy--and
I'll talk a little bit more

00:37:16.731 --> 00:37:18.940
about this on Thursday -- I
think it's really easy to look

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.260
at the Articles and say,
'Huh?

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.190
What were they thinking?
 

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.650
How did that make sense?
 

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.000
Let's create a government and
give it no power.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.039
Go.'
 

00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:29.688
So I think the Articles get a
bum rap basically,

00:37:29.688 --> 00:37:31.380
in the long view of history.
 

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.487
And I think it's important to
realize at that moment in time

00:37:34.487 --> 00:37:37.556
they made perfect sense,
given the experience of the

00:37:37.556 --> 00:37:41.335
Revolution and what people had
just experienced in the realm of

00:37:41.335 --> 00:37:42.190
government.
 

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:47.150
Basically, the Articles denied
to this new government the very

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:51.949
powers and violations that they
had seen at the heart of the

00:37:51.949 --> 00:37:53.170
Revolution.
 

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:57.289
So the Congress can't tax;
the Congress can't overrule

00:37:57.289 --> 00:38:00.527
local laws;
the Congress can't alter a

00:38:00.527 --> 00:38:03.992
state constitution;
it can't interfere with state

00:38:03.992 --> 00:38:05.369
judicial proceedings.
 

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:08.677
All of these things are things
that we saw in past weeks

00:38:08.677 --> 00:38:11.385
happening during the course of
the Revolution,

00:38:11.385 --> 00:38:13.130
inflicted by the British.
 

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.880
So this is a really--Again and
again,

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.389
when people are creating
constitutions,

00:38:17.389 --> 00:38:20.320
they learn a lesson and then
they act based on that lesson

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.983
that they learned,
and then they look at this new

00:38:22.983 --> 00:38:24.829
thing they created and go:
'okay,

00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:26.820
new lesson learned.
 

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.059
Let's make another government
because we didn't like that one

00:38:29.059 --> 00:38:29.469
so much.'
 

00:38:29.469 --> 00:38:32.090
But you can actually see people
experiencing something,

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:35.286
thinking about what that means,
and then creating a government

00:38:35.286 --> 00:38:37.119
based on those immediate
lessons.

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:40.409
That's what we see here with
the Articles of Confederation.

00:38:40.409 --> 00:38:43.199
And then to avoid an entrenched
elite--

00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:47.391
They don't want any kind of a
little aristocracy coming up in

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:50.121
America--
the Articles did establish

00:38:50.121 --> 00:38:51.630
rotation in office.
 

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:55.050
So you could not be in office
more than three or every six

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:56.989
years;
you couldn't be President of

00:38:56.989 --> 00:38:59.230
Congress more than one in any
three years;

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:04.510
and any delegate could be
instantly recalled by his home

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.280
state.
 

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:05.755
Okay.
 

00:39:05.755 --> 00:39:09.938
So there we see this weak
central government,

00:39:09.938 --> 00:39:12.789
lots of things it can't do.
 

00:39:12.789 --> 00:39:16.789
There were very,
very few things that the states

00:39:16.789 --> 00:39:21.300
were restricted from doing under
this new compact,

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.846
but there were a couple of
things that the states were not

00:39:23.846 --> 00:39:25.539
supposed to do--
and you'll hear,

00:39:25.539 --> 00:39:27.710
they're not exactly dire
restrictions.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.967
Okay.
 

00:39:27.967 --> 00:39:30.862
So no state could enter into an
alliance or treaty with a

00:39:30.862 --> 00:39:33.500
foreign nation without the
consent of Congress,

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.079
so New Jersey cannot make a
treaty with France.

00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:36.469
Okay.
 

00:39:36.469 --> 00:39:39.119
They need to go through
Congress.

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:42.353
No two or more states could
enter into a confederation

00:39:42.353 --> 00:39:44.429
without the consent of Congress.
 

00:39:44.429 --> 00:39:45.880
Okay. Think about that one.
 

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.018
So New England can't break away
and form its own confederation

00:39:49.018 --> 00:39:51.179
without at least checking with
us first.

00:39:51.179 --> 00:39:54.449
Would you allow us to break off
and form our own confederation?

00:39:54.449 --> 00:39:55.340
No?
 

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.639
That would have been an
interesting little game.

00:39:56.639 --> 00:39:58.710
No? Well, try to stop us.
 

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.869
But at least it's saying,
states are not supposed to form

00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:04.070
their own little
mini-confederations.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:08.213
States were not to keep
warships or troops in peacetime

00:40:08.213 --> 00:40:12.050
unless Congress deemed it
necessary for defense.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.943
States were not supposed to
declare war without consent of

00:40:14.943 --> 00:40:17.936
Congress--that's nice--except
where sudden invasion admitted

00:40:17.936 --> 00:40:18.750
of no delay.
 

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.230
Okay. Those are the restraints.
 

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.661
Right?
 

00:40:20.661 --> 00:40:23.909
Ooh, [laughs]
those are not dire restraints.

00:40:23.909 --> 00:40:27.230
Don't make war with another
country all by yourself.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.927
Don't break away from the
Articles, from the league of

00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:32.320
friendship, and form your own
little country.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.809
Don't make a treaty with a
foreign nation all by yourself.

00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:37.170
Those are the restrictions on
the states.

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.297
Obviously, none of these
restraints placed too serious a

00:40:41.297 --> 00:40:45.800
check on the sovereignty of the
states under this compact.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.994
So essentially the Articles of
Confederation were designed so

00:40:49.994 --> 00:40:54.260
that the new nation's central
government would not infringe on

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.309
the states.
 

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:58.106
As I said before,
it would kind of fill the hole

00:40:58.106 --> 00:41:01.260
where the British imperial
system had been before,

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.159
have a very,
very limited sphere of actions,

00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:06.570
not really have a power of
enforcement,

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:10.385
and leave everything that
wasn't specified to the states

00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:12.190
to control on their own.
 

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.942
Now, this is a document that's
being drafted in the middle of a

00:41:15.942 --> 00:41:18.219
revolution,
and what we're going to see

00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:20.971
over the course of the next few
lectures is that once

00:41:20.971 --> 00:41:23.376
revolutions end--
Remember we started the course

00:41:23.376 --> 00:41:25.889
by talking about how the
colonies came together basically

00:41:25.889 --> 00:41:28.403
when they needed to defend
themselves and then as soon as

00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:30.469
they didn't need to defend
themselves they went

00:41:30.469 --> 00:41:32.400
"boom"
and sort of parted.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:32.684
Okay.
 

00:41:32.684 --> 00:41:35.190
So we had this Revolution,
and the states,

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.476
the colonies,
they come together,

00:41:36.476 --> 00:41:38.148
they unite,
they fight together,

00:41:38.148 --> 00:41:41.186
and then the war ends,
so guess what the 1780s is

00:41:41.186 --> 00:41:42.500
going to look like.
 

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:42.657
Okay.
 

00:41:42.657 --> 00:41:44.405
It's going to look like just
what you think it will look

00:41:44.405 --> 00:41:44.659
like.
 

00:41:44.659 --> 00:41:46.952
The states basically all turn
their back on each other and

00:41:46.952 --> 00:41:48.079
say, 'Well, that was nice.
 

00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:49.748
[laughs]
Now we're going to do our own

00:41:49.748 --> 00:41:50.110
thing.
 

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.469
Thank you very much.'
 

00:41:51.469 --> 00:41:54.327
So the Articles is drafted in a
time when there is this

00:41:54.327 --> 00:41:56.550
cooperation going on between the
states.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:00.141
What we're going to see in the
next two lectures is what

00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:03.670
happens when these Articles
actually go into effect.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.579
What do the 1780s look like?
 

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:10.536
And that's going to take us on
the road to new lessons being

00:42:10.536 --> 00:42:13.018
learned and yet another
government.

00:42:13.018 --> 00:42:15.239
Think about the pace at which
governments are being created in

00:42:15.239 --> 00:42:15.750
this period.
 

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.135
It gets back to where I started
at the beginning of this

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:18.570
lecture.
 

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.260
They're just:
'Hey, we need a new government.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:21.909
Let's make one now.
 

00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:23.079
Okay. How do you like that one?
 

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:23.820
I don't know.
 

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.739
We need to revise it.'
 

00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:26.454
They're also revising these
governments throughout this

00:42:26.454 --> 00:42:26.739
period.
 

00:42:26.739 --> 00:42:29.789
That's also got to be a little
unsettling.

00:42:29.789 --> 00:42:33.414
It's part of why in this
period, people tend to get very

00:42:33.414 --> 00:42:34.800
upset, very scared.
 

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.344
Something goes a little wrong
and they think,

00:42:36.344 --> 00:42:37.750
'Aah, it's the end of the
government!'

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:42.159
Well, if it's only two years
old, maybe it will collapse,

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:45.480
and if these are the guys who
actually made the government,

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.697
then they kind of have a good
reason for thinking that it

00:42:47.697 --> 00:42:48.449
could fall apart.
 

00:42:48.449 --> 00:42:50.610
They were there when they put
it together.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.150
Maybe it's actually going to
collapse.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.690
So that's actually--And we're
going to see that particularly

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.730
in the 1780s and then the 1790s.
 

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:59.340
We won't be talking so much
about the 1790s.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.630
If you want to take my Early
National America course,

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.260
that will start right where
this one drops off actually,

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:09.130
and takes us into the 1790s --
but you can see that spirit in

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:10.840
the 1790s,
of people saying, 'Wow.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.300
We've been creating a lot of
governments.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.539
Do you think this one's going
to stick around?

00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:15.289
I don't know.
 

00:43:15.289 --> 00:43:16.030
I hope so.
 

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.300
Maybe it'll last for five years.
 

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.150
That'll be exciting.'
 

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.230
So--Okay. I will stop there.
 

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.733
On Thursday we will look at
what happened when the Articles

00:43:23.733 --> 00:43:24.760
go into effect.
 

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:30.000

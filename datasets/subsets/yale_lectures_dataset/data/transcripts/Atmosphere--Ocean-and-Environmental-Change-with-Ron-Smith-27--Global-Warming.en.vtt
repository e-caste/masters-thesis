RONALD SMITH: OK, so we are
starting this new subject,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.733
which is a really important one.

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:13.133
And we'll be covering at least
these subtopics, starting with

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.933
the carbon cycle, then the
question of whether we can use

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:21.033
the Holocene as a reference
period for judging recent

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.467
climate change.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:26.367
We'll go over the history and
the theory of the warming and

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:30.300
cooling we've had over the last
hundred years or so, talk

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.400
about the IPCC forecasts for the
future, and then go back,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.100
in a way, and kind of summarize
some of this by

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.833
talking about this interesting
and useful concept of climate

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.233
sensitivity.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:46.300
So it's quite a lot
of material.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.100
The book is chapter 13.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.900
A couple of you have commented
that in the earlier editions,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.033
there may not even be
such a chapter.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.133
So please check with your
classmates that have the

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:05.433
current edition and look at
their chapter 13 and see what

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:05.967
the deal is.

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:08.400
If you don't have that chapter,
you may want to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.500
borrow someone else's textbook
for a few hours while you read

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.667
through that chapter.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:19.567
But a lot of the material, as
I'll indicate in a minute, is

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:23.167
coming out of the
IPCC reports.

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:24.633
And those are--some are already
put online on the

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:29.533
class's server for you,
others you can

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.267
find very easily online.

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:33.100
Just Google IPCC.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.900
It'll take you to their
big website.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.867
There's lots of different
reports, you just have to

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:40.700
figure out which ones you're
looking for there.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.967
So even if you don't have a
chapter 13, you can get a lot

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:48.133
of this from the IPCC reports.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:52.067
Now I wanted to point out that
this subject we're dealing

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:56.433
with now, I think, is one of the
four great paradigm shifts

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:59.000
in the earth sciences.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The four, in my mind, being the
theory of evolution, that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.333
is, Darwin's idea of
the mutability of

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:11.900
species back in the 1860s.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.233
The theory of the Ice Ages,
which we've spoken about in

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.567
this course.

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:20.100
The idea that just 14,000 years
ago, we had a thick

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.833
layer of ice covering over much
of what is today open,

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:27.233
useful land.

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:31.867
The theory of plate tectonics,
which helps us to understand

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:35.400
the layout of the continents,
how that has changed through

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.467
geologic time.

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.500
The difference between
continental crust and ocean

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.900
crust. It even helps us to
understand the shape of the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.567
ocean basins.

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:45.833
And then the theory of global
warming, which we'll be

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:46.600
dealing with now.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.400
Now, these each have their own
characteristics, but on a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.400
scientific front, they all
were true revolutions.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.300
In other words, they changed the
very most basic ideas of

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.633
how we thought about the
different subjects of biology

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:07.400
and climate and geology, and
then, not only climate for

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.367
global warming, but also the
role of humans on the planet.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.433
There are books, interesting
books, written on the history

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:18.267
of each of these.

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:19.067
Fascinating reading.

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:22.767
How they were resisted, how they
were promoted, what kinds

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:27.167
of evidence finally tipped it
over so that the majority of

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:31.233
the scientific community
finally accepted these.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.200
Fascinating reading in the
history of human thought.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.367
Of course, the theory of
evolution was resisted

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:40.367
strongly by the church at that
time because it changed the

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:45.667
way we thought about humans
and human nature.

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:51.367
Still resisted to this
day in some areas.

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:53.767
The theory of the Ice Ages and
plate tectonics I don't think

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:59.900
had any kind of resistance or
even that much notoriety in

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.833
the general public.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:05.867
So they were mostly battles
fought within cadre of

00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:07.100
scientists.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.300
So that's a little different.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.367
But then we get to the theory
of global warming, and now

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:17.967
we're back in a subject that
is of great interest to the

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:22.267
general public as well, and
comes straight into politics.

00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:27.933
And it has a stake,
a current stake.

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:30.500
Now, all of these things were
interesting--those first three

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.067
were interesting intellectually,
but none of

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:39.933
them required that we do much
in response to whether the

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:41.967
theory was accepted or not.

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:44.867
Where the theory of global
warming is a little different

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:49.367
because it has to do with not
only the role of humans on the

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:51.933
planet and the question of
whether there are too many

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:55.000
people and our lifestyle is
wrong, but also in many

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.600
respects it brings in the issue
whether we should be

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.800
changing our lifestyle or
changing the way we do things.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.733
So here we are.

00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:07.267
And so you and I are living
through this one.

00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:10.033
Not only is it a scientific
debate, but it has these

00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:12.467
political and economic
consequences.

00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:16.800
It's really a mess, because
it's all these fears of

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.933
discussion are engaged in the
theory of--in the discussions

00:05:21.933 --> 00:05:24.000
of the theory of
global warming.

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:31.033
Any comments or questions
on this?

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:33.233
So, of course, I'm going to try
to approach this in the

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:40.100
most boring, scientific way that
I can and try to keep to

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.433
a large extent out of the
politics and these other

00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:46.500
discussions.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.500
But we can't avoid dealing
with some of these.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.400
It used to be that, when you
went to someone's house or a

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.533
cocktail party, your companion
would whisper in your ear, now

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:06.333
remember, don't talk about
politics or religion.

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:08.667
And now you have to say, don't
talk about politics or

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:11.800
religion or global warming,
because you get into some

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.733
terrible battles quite
innocently, making the most

00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:16.700
benign remarks.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.467
And suddenly, everybody's
in an uproar.

00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:21.767
So, particularly hard for
someone who works in this

00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:30.700
field to avoid that kind of
awkward party situation.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.967
So as I've indicated, for a lot
of the discussion, then,

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:38.600
that you'll do, and that I will
do, and that everybody

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.267
else does, your primary
reference material are these

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:44.367
very valuable IPCC reports.

00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:47.100
There have been a series of
IPCC reports, and the most

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.533
recent one, called the
Fourth Assessment,

00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:53.167
was finished in 2007.

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:55.000
And of course, the
Intergovernmental Panel on

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.100
Climate Change is busily working
on the next one.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.867
I don't know when the target
date is, but probably within a

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:04.733
year or two, there
will be the Fifth

00:07:04.733 --> 00:07:08.067
Assessment of climate change.

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:10.433
And some of that material
is already being leaked.

00:07:10.433 --> 00:07:11.767
You can find it on
their website.

00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:15.067
But for the most part, we're
going to be going back and

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:18.567
focusing most of our attention
on the 2007 report.

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:22.467
But there have been other things
more recent, such as an

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:27.300
interesting National Academy of
Sciences report on, what's

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.733
the word they used?

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:32.900
Sudden, they used a different
word sudden climate change,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.933
they did a particular
study on how fast

00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:37.133
climate change will occur.

00:07:37.133 --> 00:07:41.567
And I've got that posted on
the lab course website.

00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:44.433
A special report, also by the
National Academy, on high

00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:49.267
latitude climate change, and
both of those are more recent

00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:53.000
than 2007, so those will give
you some updated material.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.900
And there is other for example,
if you go to this

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.700
website, RealClimate.com, which
has a reputation for

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:07.900
being a little bit on the
liberal side of the issue, but

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.700
nevertheless, a lot of
scientists post recent results

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.633
on RealClimate.com.

00:08:14.633 --> 00:08:16.333
And if you're going to do that,
though, you should be

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:20.167
evenhanded and go to some of
these other anti websites,

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:24.867
like, what are they called,
ClimateSkeptic.com

00:08:24.867 --> 00:08:25.633
and things like that.

00:08:25.633 --> 00:08:28.167
So be sure you, if you're going
to bookmark some of

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:31.767
these things, try to get an even
number of bookmarks on

00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:33.833
the two sides of the issue.

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:36.567
You'll have to decide for
yourself, in the end, which

00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:41.300
material you accept and
which ones you reject.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.467
I'll try to help with
that a little bit.

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:48.500
So let's start out by looking at
the carbon cycle, which is

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.033
really one of the core
issues in the debate.

00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:55.900
It has to do with what controls
the carbon dioxide

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.000
level in the atmosphere.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.700
We know the carbon dioxide is
a powerful greenhouse gas.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.267
It has a linear molecular
structure, but it can flap and

00:09:07.267 --> 00:09:12.000
it can vibrate in such
a way to absorb and

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.800
emit infrared radiation.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.633
So it's a powerful
greenhouse gas.

00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:22.900
It's in part controlled by
anthropogenic processes, so

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:29.200
it's at the center of
the whole debate.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.633
You have to know this.

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:35.267
You have to know that when you
burn something like coal, the

00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:42.233
chemical reaction looks like
that, carbon plus oxygen.

00:09:42.233 --> 00:09:45.800
You oxidize the carbon to form
CO2, and that's a gas that

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.867
goes into the atmosphere.

00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:50.567
This comes from the atmosphere,
and this would be

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:55.267
coming from some buried
deposit of coal.

00:09:55.267 --> 00:10:01.800
If you're burning methane, which
is CH4, you combine that

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.867
with oxygen and you get two
by-products, water vapor and

00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:08.000
carbon dioxide.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.633
The water vapor we pretty much
neglect, because it goes into

00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:17.833
the atmosphere as water vapor,
but then instantly, it becomes

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:20.867
part of the normal
hydrologic cycle.

00:10:20.867 --> 00:10:23.867
And if you remember early in
the course, we computed the

00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:27.767
average residence time
for water vapor.

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:29.167
Anybody remember
what that was?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.033
Nine days, yeah, eight
days, nine days.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:40.067
So in other words, it's cycled
back in rain to the earth's

00:10:40.067 --> 00:10:43.967
surface or the ocean very, very
quickly, and so it really

00:10:43.967 --> 00:10:47.200
plays no role in the
greenhouse effect.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200
Let me be careful.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.867
Water vapor is also a very
powerful greenhouse gas.

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:55.033
And because there's so much of
it, it's actually in a sense

00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:57.300
the strongest of all the
greenhouse gases.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.867
But it is controlled by
the natural system.

00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:04.633
It doesn't matter how
much we add into it.

00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:08.933
The level is not going to
change for that reason.

00:11:08.933 --> 00:11:12.267
It's going to be controlled
by the own, the internal

00:11:12.267 --> 00:11:14.133
processes within
the atmosphere.

00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:16.767
Nothing we can do in adding
water vapor is going to have

00:11:16.767 --> 00:11:19.933
any influence on changing the
amount of water vapor in the

00:11:19.933 --> 00:11:21.433
atmosphere.

00:11:21.433 --> 00:11:25.733
So it's important to know that
water vapor is one product,

00:11:25.733 --> 00:11:29.467
but in terms of what that does
to climate, that particular

00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:32.300
piece is negligible
in the sense

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.067
that I have just described.

00:11:36.567 --> 00:11:39.767
Propane is another
form of gas.

00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:43.467
It can be burned for heat,
and the reaction--

00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:45.267
the stoichiometry is a
little bit different.

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.100
I've tried to balance
those reactions.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.900
I'm not a chemist, so you
may want to check me.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.000
Add up the carbons, add up the
oxygen, be sure everything

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.500
adds up properly, and correct
if I've gone wrong here.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.433
But basically water
and CO2 again, and

00:12:01.433 --> 00:12:03.700
the same thing implies.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.967
The CO2 stays in the

00:12:04.967 --> 00:12:09.067
atmosphere, influencing climate.

00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:13.100
The water vapor quickly gets
cycled into the natural

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.467
hydrologic system.

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:17.767
Another thing that's going on,
we've talked about calcium

00:12:17.767 --> 00:12:22.767
carbonate in this course a
couple of times because that

00:12:22.767 --> 00:12:25.567
excess calcium that we found in
the Quinnipiac River that

00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:30.633
wasn't there in ocean water,
we argued goes into making

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:33.700
calcium carbonate in
the oceans, shells,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.067
limestones, and so on.

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:41.000
There's a lot of that around in
the earth's climate system.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.767
If we take a little bit of
that and heat it, we can

00:12:44.767 --> 00:12:49.400
separate it into the material
that's used to make cement,

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.567
but that releases CO2 as well.

00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:54.933
So there's another
source of CO2.

00:12:54.933 --> 00:12:56.533
It's not quite as powerful
as these.

00:12:56.533 --> 00:12:58.500
I'm going to show you some
numbers in a minute.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:04.567
But that is another significant
input of CO2, is

00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:09.033
the making of cement from
natural calcium carbonate that

00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:13.633
was precipitated in the oceans
by either living

00:13:13.633 --> 00:13:17.167
or non-living processes.

00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:18.933
Stop me if you have any
questions on this.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.467
So when you burn fossil fuels
then, you're putting carbon

00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:28.167
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:30.700
And that comes from carbon
that's been stored in the

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.867
earth, typically for 60
or 100 million years.

00:13:35.867 --> 00:13:39.467
Remember in the Cretaceous
Period, way back when the

00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:44.000
dinosaurs were alive, that's
when a lot of forests were

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.967
being the earth was very warm
during that period of time.

00:13:47.967 --> 00:13:50.533
You had tropical forests almost
everywhere on the

00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:51.667
continents.

00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:54.833
Those trees would
eventually fall.

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:59.167
And the productivity was so
high, instead of their rotting

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:01.967
and putting that CO2 back in the
atmosphere, they would be

00:14:01.967 --> 00:14:06.000
covered over by another and
then another and another.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.767
So you ended up sequestering all
of that carbon down in the

00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:13.833
crust of the earth where it's
been sitting there for 60 or

00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:15.733
100 million years.

00:14:15.733 --> 00:14:21.467
And now we're suddenly pulling
it back out and burning it and

00:14:21.467 --> 00:14:24.033
putting it back into
the atmosphere.

00:14:24.033 --> 00:14:28.800
And in the oceans, too,
you had algae growing,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.967
phytoplankton, that would sink
to the bottom of the ocean,

00:14:32.967 --> 00:14:36.000
and instead of rotting and
returning to the ocean system,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.733
they would get covered over.

00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:43.100
And today you have all of these
oil deposits beneath the

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.533
ocean bottom.

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:48.333
And then we dig those up
and we burn those, too.

00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:54.967
So both on the land and in the
oceans, we are removing

00:14:54.967 --> 00:14:59.000
ancient, very ancient fossil
carbon and burning it to put

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.667
it back in the atmosphere.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:06.467
Now the natural, the
modern biosphere is

00:15:06.467 --> 00:15:07.700
active in this as well.

00:15:11.433 --> 00:15:19.000
For example, trees remove a lot
of carbon dioxide during

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.200
the summer season when they're
growing and use that to build

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200
their woody biomass.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.933
Remember, the trunk of
a tree is about 1/5

00:15:28.933 --> 00:15:31.500
or one quarter carbon.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.000
Well, where did that
carbon come from?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.533
It didn't come from the soil.

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:38.100
From the soil, the tree is
getting water and it's getting

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.500
nutrients, like nitrogens and
phosphorus, but almost all of

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.333
the carbon to build a tree
trunk is coming from the

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:47.567
atmosphere.

00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:54.900
I mentioned in another context
that I did a project down on a

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.033
small island in the Caribbean
last spring.

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:00.667
And we were flying an aircraft
around the island.

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:03.333
One of the sensors we had on
the airplane was a carbon

00:16:03.333 --> 00:16:06.400
dioxide sensor so we could
measure how much carbon

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.533
dioxide was in the atmosphere
upstream of the island, over

00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:12.033
the island, and downstream
of the island.

00:16:12.033 --> 00:16:14.367
The island was forested.

00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:17.000
It's the island of Dominica,
one of the few Caribbean

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.833
islands that still has its
original forest. And when we

00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:25.267
flew downstream of the island,
across the wake of the island,

00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:31.500
we found a slight deficit
in carbon dioxide.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.533
In other words, the air that
had come from upstream and

00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:38.533
passed over the island's forests
had lost a little bit

00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:41.900
of carbon dioxide to those
trees, and we found that

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.733
deficit downwind.

00:16:43.733 --> 00:16:45.733
Now, this has been well known.

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:48.167
You can measure this in
lots of other ways.

00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:52.900
But this is yet another way to
convince yourself that the

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.367
forests are actively removing
carbon dioxide from the

00:16:57.367 --> 00:17:02.100
atmosphere all the time
that they're growing.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.067
But then, they recycle
some of that.

00:17:04.067 --> 00:17:08.100
For example, the material in
leaves that falls to earth at

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:14.100
this time of year then rots and
respires over the winter

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.100
season to put that little
bit of carbon back in.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.933
Now it still has its woody
biomass, which is most of it,

00:17:20.933 --> 00:17:25.200
but a little bit goes back into
the atmosphere, which

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.567
gives that little bit of wiggle
in the Keeling curve

00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:32.433
that you were studying in
your Time Series Lab.

00:17:32.433 --> 00:17:37.000
So I want to emphasize that the
biosphere is a very active

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.300
player in this carbon cycle.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.567
Certainly on the long term, but
then on the modern time

00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:48.433
scales as well.

00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:50.967
Any questions there?

00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:51.267
Yeah.

00:17:51.267 --> 00:17:54.200
STUDENT: Does the carbon that's
sequestered in the

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.067
wood, when, like, the wood from
the tree rots, is that

00:17:57.067 --> 00:17:59.767
also, is that rereleased
in the atmosphere?

00:17:59.767 --> 00:18:00.300
PROFESSOR:
That's right.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.933
So if a tree, if a modern tree
today does fall and then you

00:18:05.933 --> 00:18:08.467
watch it over some years, it
rots and kind of disappears

00:18:08.467 --> 00:18:09.167
into the Earth.

00:18:09.167 --> 00:18:12.033
That carbon ends up back
in the atmosphere.

00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:15.733
A little bit may be left in the
soil as organic carbon,

00:18:15.733 --> 00:18:18.333
but then over a longer period
of time, maybe ten or twenty

00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:21.067
years, that too will go back
to the atmosphere.

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:23.967
So there are few places on
earth, however, where you're

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:26.267
getting this sequestration,
where you're getting things

00:18:26.267 --> 00:18:29.067
falling on top of it faster
than it can rot.

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:32.933
But I would say, for example,
in most of these New England

00:18:32.933 --> 00:18:38.633
forests, most of the ancient
tree material is going back

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:39.867
into the atmosphere.

00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:47.967
Well, in fact, that's one of the
problems with this idea of

00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:50.867
solving the global warming
problem by

00:18:50.867 --> 00:18:53.467
planting lots of trees.

00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:57.500
Because what that will do in the
short run, indeed, it will

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.500
draw extra CO2 from the
atmosphere and store it in the

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.233
biomass of the tree.

00:19:02.233 --> 00:19:06.533
But a typical tree of the
species you're familiar with,

00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:11.633
both conifers and deciduous,
typically have lifetimes of 60

00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:14.333
to 80 to 100 years.

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:17.233
And then they will fall and
they'll rot and the material

00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:17.700
will go back.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:23.767
So it is a temporary fix,
perhaps, to reducing carbon

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:26.667
dioxide buildup in the
atmosphere, but by no means is

00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:30.167
it permanent because of the
short turnover time of trees

00:19:30.167 --> 00:19:38.633
in the forest.

00:19:38.633 --> 00:19:43.733
So this diagram will summarize
some of this.

00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:45.967
And there are two types
of numbers on here.

00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:51.033
There are, for example,
storage.

00:19:51.033 --> 00:19:53.367
These numbers are in boxes.

00:19:53.367 --> 00:19:59.000
And those units would be
in gigatons of carbon.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And then the arrows, which are
the fluxes, going between

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.800
these reservoirs, and
those units are in

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.800
gigatons per year of carbon.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.100
So for example, in the
atmosphere typically and this

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.533
is a calculation you could
do but we have about

00:20:15.533 --> 00:20:19.300
760 gigatons of carbon.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.133
Remember, that's the
C in the CO2.

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:26.500
If you want to know what the
mass of the carbon dioxide is,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.400
be sure to include the mass of
the two oxygens that are on

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.033
the carbon dioxide.

00:20:31.033 --> 00:20:34.667
This is just the carbon
in the carbon dioxide.

00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:42.167
For example, let's look at how
it interacts with terrestrial

00:20:42.167 --> 00:20:45.200
production, the one I've just
been talking about, of trees

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.600
and other biomass on
the continents.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:57.433
So about 60 gigatons per year
is put in and about 62 is

00:20:57.433 --> 00:21:01.367
taken out every year.

00:21:01.367 --> 00:21:05.167
So it's a very dynamic
reservoir.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.967
The difference, however,
is rather small.

00:21:09.967 --> 00:21:13.333
There's an excess going from
the atmosphere into the

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:18.433
biosphere of about two or
three gigatons per year.

00:21:18.433 --> 00:21:24.567
It's this big exchange, the 60
and the 60 that's responsible

00:21:24.567 --> 00:21:29.900
for that wiggle in the
Keeling curve.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.833
And it's the annual difference,
that two or three

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:37.100
units, that's responsible
for that trend

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:37.967
in the Keeling curve.

00:21:37.967 --> 00:21:39.967
I'll show you that Keeling
curve in a moment.

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:41.833
You've seen it before,
but that's a

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:43.933
central part of our argument.

00:21:43.933 --> 00:21:46.933
The oceans are somewhat similar,
so there's biological

00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:49.233
activity taking place
in the oceans.

00:21:49.233 --> 00:21:51.533
We've talked about that.

00:21:51.533 --> 00:21:54.167
We've seen that it's confined to
certain parts of the ocean

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:57.133
where you can get nutrients
coming up into

00:21:57.133 --> 00:21:59.333
the euphotic zone.

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:03.433
The numbers are even bigger
than for the terrestrial

00:22:03.433 --> 00:22:07.733
biomass, but they too have
a similar characteristic.

00:22:07.733 --> 00:22:15.433
Large instantaneous cycling,
but over a year, only about

00:22:15.433 --> 00:22:19.467
two gigatons, and going in the
same direction, going from the

00:22:19.467 --> 00:22:23.067
atmosphere into the ocean.

00:22:23.067 --> 00:22:28.233
There's the cement production,
about 6.5.

00:22:28.233 --> 00:22:31.800
And there's some other
things here.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.533
This is one to look at.

00:22:33.533 --> 00:22:37.767
The amount of fossil fuel
reserves still in the crust of

00:22:37.767 --> 00:22:44.067
the earth is 4,000 units
of gigatons.

00:22:44.067 --> 00:22:48.667
So you can imagine if you burn
the rest of that, what that

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.633
would do to that number.

00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:56.867
It would be 4,760, unless, you
probably should take into

00:22:56.867 --> 00:22:58.367
account this removal as well.

00:22:58.367 --> 00:23:03.000
But it would be a huge number if
one were to burn all of the

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.433
fossil fuel reserves and put
that carbon dioxide in the

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:08.333
atmosphere.

00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:12.267
Questions on this busy
diagram here?

00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:18.933
I'm going to use these numbers
to do something we did early

00:23:18.933 --> 00:23:20.800
in the course.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.167
I want to compute residence
times, because sometimes

00:23:25.167 --> 00:23:28.100
that's helpful to get a physical
feeling for the way

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.767
these reservoirs work.

00:23:29.767 --> 00:23:33.633
So I'm going to be using the
atmosphere as the reservoir,

00:23:33.633 --> 00:23:36.300
and then either these
large monthly--

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:42.500
month by month fluxes or the
smaller annual total fluxes to

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.433
compute the residence time.

00:23:46.433 --> 00:23:48.367
So residence time is for CO2.

00:23:48.367 --> 00:23:52.000
On the month by month, on the
seasonal basis, I'll take that

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.633
760 gigatons and divide it
here I'm just using the

00:23:57.633 --> 00:23:59.733
atmospheric number.

00:23:59.733 --> 00:24:03.000
I probably should have summed
up the atmosphere and the

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.133
ocean number, but I'm just using
the atmospheric number.

00:24:06.133 --> 00:24:11.667
And when I do that, I get a
pretty short time, 13 years.

00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:15.367
I get even a shorter time if
I use, if I put the ocean

00:24:15.367 --> 00:24:17.200
numbers in there as well.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.033
So there's this rapid cycling
that's taking place.

00:24:20.033 --> 00:24:23.467
But in a way it's kind of
irrelevant because it cancels

00:24:23.467 --> 00:24:25.900
itself out at the
end of the year.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.567
So I'm not going to put
a great deal of

00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:29.867
stock in this number.

00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:31.233
It is a residence time.

00:24:31.233 --> 00:24:34.833
It is computed in the proper
way, but the fluxes we're

00:24:34.833 --> 00:24:38.767
using are balanced over
the course of a year.

00:24:38.767 --> 00:24:41.800
And so, the numbers is
not of great use.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.500
On the longer term, I'll take
760 and divide it by one of

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.667
those imbalances.

00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:51.500
Now again, I've used the
imbalance for just the

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.567
terrestrial biomass.

00:24:52.567 --> 00:24:55.800
Maybe I could have changed that
to four by adding up two

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.133
here and two there.

00:24:58.133 --> 00:24:59.433
But you can see what
that will do to the

00:24:59.433 --> 00:25:01.900
numbers pretty easily.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.233
I've just used two gigatons
per year here.

00:25:04.233 --> 00:25:05.567
And I got 380 years.

00:25:05.567 --> 00:25:07.933
Now this is a more useful
number because this is

00:25:07.933 --> 00:25:12.000
actually how long a carbon
dioxide molecule is likely to

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.033
stay in the atmosphere before
it's returned into one of the

00:25:20.033 --> 00:25:22.467
biosphere sinks.

00:25:22.467 --> 00:25:25.533
So when we're trying to predict
the future of carbon

00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:29.667
dioxide concentrations in the
atmosphere, we have to realize

00:25:29.667 --> 00:25:32.900
that it stays there for quite a
long period of time in spite

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.600
of these fluxes back and
forth between the

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.133
atmosphere and the biosphere.

00:25:40.133 --> 00:25:43.000
Questions there?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.933
So from economic data, we can
get a pretty good handle on

00:25:49.933 --> 00:25:52.000
the carbon dioxide emissions
that have taken

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.600
place in past years.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.600
And here you see
various curves.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.367
The black is the total,
where all the others

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:03.300
have been summed up.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.567
The two largest independent
sources have been coal, in the

00:26:07.567 --> 00:26:12.233
green, and petroleum,
in the dark blue.

00:26:12.233 --> 00:26:17.467
Each of those is about six
billion metric tons

00:26:17.467 --> 00:26:19.333
of carbon per year.

00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:20.500
So this is not accumulated.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.933
This is what's emitted
each year.

00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:26.667
And of course, that number has
been growing since the

00:26:26.667 --> 00:26:30.800
beginning of the Industrial
Revolution, where we began to

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.800
use fossil fuels for steam
engines and then for

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.400
electricity generation and
transportation and so on.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.267
Natural gas is growing
rapidly now.

00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:44.800
Cement production is lower
but still growing.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.600
And a small amount is the gas
flaring that you see in some

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.033
of these oils fields and gas
fields, just burning off

00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:56.467
excess gas.

00:27:00.733 --> 00:27:02.167
So it's rising very rapidly.

00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:06.133
No sign at all of any
decrease in this.

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:10.233
There have been some temporary
for example, in the 1970s

00:27:10.233 --> 00:27:13.367
there was a kind of an oil
crisis, and you see a tiny

00:27:13.367 --> 00:27:14.600
little bit of a dip there.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.967
But generally it's just
a curve that's

00:27:16.967 --> 00:27:19.033
rising very, very steeply.

00:27:19.033 --> 00:27:22.767
And this is the rate at which
we are putting CO2 into the

00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:23.033
atmosphere.

00:27:23.033 --> 00:27:26.800
This is not the accumulated
amount.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.067
Questions there?

00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:37.167
So we've been monitoring carbon
dioxide concentration.

00:27:37.167 --> 00:27:40.467
The first measurement started on
the Mauna Loa Observatory,

00:27:40.467 --> 00:27:44.200
up on the Big Island of Hawaii,
up on top of the high

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.500
volcanic peak there.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.667
There's a picture of
the laboratory.

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.967
And I know you've seen this
before, and now I know that

00:27:50.967 --> 00:27:53.233
you're familiar with it because
you're working with it

00:27:53.233 --> 00:27:54.533
in your lab.

00:27:54.533 --> 00:27:58.333
This is exactly the same data
set that I gave you to work on

00:27:58.333 --> 00:28:01.133
in Lab Number Four.

00:28:01.133 --> 00:28:06.200
And the features here, of
course, plotting the units are

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.567
in parts per million by
volume, not by mass.

00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:11.000
So it's by molecule.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
It's a ratio, for every for
every million molecules of

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.467
air, there are 320--

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:22.167
molecules of carbon dioxide.

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:27.100
That's the way you would
read that number.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.667
There's an annual oscillation
that has to do with the mostly

00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:34.533
the Northern Hemisphere biomass
drawing carbon dioxide

00:28:34.533 --> 00:28:39.500
in the summer and releasing
it in the winter.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.967
And then on top of that, you've
got a trend, which you

00:28:42.967 --> 00:28:45.600
can see from the smoothed
line here.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.867
And that slope has
been increasing.

00:28:48.867 --> 00:28:54.767
And of course, the increase in
that slope is because of this,

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:57.533
the rate at which we've been
putting CO2 into the

00:28:57.533 --> 00:28:58.767
atmosphere has been
increasing.

00:28:58.767 --> 00:29:04.500
So that rate of change of carbon
dioxide concentration

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.300
has been increasing as well.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.867
So any questions on the it's
called the Keeling curve

00:29:14.867 --> 00:29:18.167
because the scientist that got
this started back in the '50s

00:29:18.167 --> 00:29:19.800
was Charles Keeling.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.933
He passed away a couple of years
ago, but he's one of the

00:29:21.933 --> 00:29:24.067
great heroes in climate
science.

00:29:24.067 --> 00:29:28.833
To have the forethought to get
an accurate measurement of

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:34.200
this type going early enough,
so by the time we got to the

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.600
year 2000, we had a good record
and the beginning of a

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.533
clear understanding of what's
causing this rise.

00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:51.800
Now here's another diagram from
the IPCC report that's a

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.367
really important one.

00:29:54.367 --> 00:29:56.533
You can read through the legend,
but I put these little

00:29:56.533 --> 00:29:58.567
labels up here as well.

00:29:58.567 --> 00:30:04.467
This is the annual change in
carbon dioxide concentration

00:30:04.467 --> 00:30:07.467
in parts per million
by volume.

00:30:07.467 --> 00:30:13.000
And the bars are the actual
annual change.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.100
And if that curve looks
familiar, if those bar graph

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.967
looks familiar, it's because
you computed that very same

00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:22.200
quantity in your lab exercise.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.667
So you're familiar with
how to do this.

00:30:25.667 --> 00:30:30.500
And the increase started out at
about 0.5 parts per million

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:36.167
change per year and is now about
three times that amount

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:38.867
of increase per year.

00:30:38.867 --> 00:30:44.800
Up above is the expected change
from emissions if all

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:50.600
the CO2 we're putting in, namely
that, remained in the

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:56.800
atmosphere, and it's about
twice what we're actually

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.233
finding as the increase every
year in the atmosphere.

00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:02.233
So here's what we've
learned from this.

00:31:02.233 --> 00:31:09.233
The biomass is taking in about
half of that extra that we are

00:31:09.233 --> 00:31:11.500
emitting into the atmosphere.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.667
That's rather remarkable.

00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:18.967
The reason seems to be that
carbon dioxide is in many

00:31:18.967 --> 00:31:25.067
places around the earth and the
ocean a limiting quantity

00:31:25.067 --> 00:31:29.567
for photosynthesis.

00:31:29.567 --> 00:31:33.467
So that when you increase the
concentration of CO2, you

00:31:33.467 --> 00:31:35.967
increase the rate at
which plants grow.

00:31:35.967 --> 00:31:39.733
It's called CO2 fertilization.

00:31:39.733 --> 00:31:44.533
So as CO2 has increased, the
plants have tried to take some

00:31:44.533 --> 00:31:47.467
of that excess back out.

00:31:47.467 --> 00:31:49.233
They take about half
of it out.

00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:52.267
There's some speculation about
whether they will continue to

00:31:52.267 --> 00:31:54.933
be able to take out half,
because they need other

00:31:54.933 --> 00:31:55.767
nutrients as well.

00:31:55.767 --> 00:31:59.000
They need phosphorus and
nitrogen, they need water, if

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.900
they're plants growing
on land.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.067
And it might be that as these
other ingredients become

00:32:04.067 --> 00:32:09.500
limiting, the biosphere will no
longer be able to do this

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.167
for us, and these numbers
could creep up.

00:32:12.167 --> 00:32:15.400
As this one increases, these
might actually creep up

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.433
eventually to become more equal
to the amount that we're

00:32:19.433 --> 00:32:23.100
putting in every year.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.333
Questions on that?

00:32:27.467 --> 00:32:30.533
So it's interesting to look
at this from a historical

00:32:30.533 --> 00:32:32.567
perspective because what
we're doing now is so

00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:35.033
unusual and so rapid.

00:32:35.033 --> 00:32:37.167
So if we go back 10,000
years, this

00:32:37.167 --> 00:32:38.933
roughly covers the Holocene.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.333
Here is carbon dioxide
concentration in parts per

00:32:44.333 --> 00:32:45.833
million by volume.

00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:49.700
And of course, the Keeling curve
is the little red part

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.500
here, it's just that
little part.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.100
Before that time, we get that
data from the ice cores, the

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:59.733
little vesicles, the little
bubbles in the ice cores give

00:32:59.733 --> 00:33:01.233
us the data prior
to that time.

00:33:01.233 --> 00:33:05.700
But it was pretty flat through
the Holocene, with a value of

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:11.767
about 270 or 280 or 290
parts per million.

00:33:11.767 --> 00:33:15.067
And then in the Industrial
Revolution, on this time

00:33:15.067 --> 00:33:18.133
scale, it shoots up
almost vertically.

00:33:18.133 --> 00:33:21.200
If you blow that up, blow that
time scale up, and show it

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.267
here going back to 1800, it was
slow at first and then has

00:33:25.267 --> 00:33:29.033
become more and more rapid, as
we discussed in the previous

00:33:29.033 --> 00:33:34.067
couple of diagrams because the
rate of carbon dioxide

00:33:34.067 --> 00:33:35.500
emissions has increased
so strongly.

00:33:38.633 --> 00:33:41.333
We can go back even further
in geologic time.

00:33:44.267 --> 00:33:46.700
And you've seen this kind
of thing before.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:55.100
This is an ice core showing
carbon dioxide concentrations.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:01.100
Here we are in the Holocene,
right about here, with

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.867
preindustrial levels
around 270 or 280.

00:34:05.867 --> 00:34:09.067
But just prior to that, 15,000,
20,000 years ago at

00:34:09.067 --> 00:34:11.667
the end of last Ice Age, the
values were down about 200

00:34:11.667 --> 00:34:15.900
hundred, and then oscillated
around those lower levels for

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.800
at least 400,000 years.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.733
It's hard to put this recent
data even on the same scale

00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:25.767
because it plots as almost
a vertical line.

00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:28.333
So the rate at which we're
putting CO2 in and changing

00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:33.033
atmospheric composition is far
higher than anything one could

00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:36.600
diagnose from previous
geologic eras.

00:34:40.267 --> 00:34:44.467
There's another piece to this
argument that I find kind of

00:34:44.467 --> 00:34:45.833
interesting.

00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:48.967
It has to do with the
isotopes of carbon.

00:34:48.967 --> 00:34:54.067
Carbon, like hydrogen and oxygen
that we spoke about

00:34:54.067 --> 00:34:59.333
earlier in the week, come as
a primary element and then

00:34:59.333 --> 00:35:02.433
various heavier isotopes.

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:05.200
And most carbon is Carbon
12, but there's a

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.567
Carbon 13 as well.

00:35:06.567 --> 00:35:09.400
It's a stable isotope
of carbon.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:15.500
And the buried fossil fuel
happens to be depleted in

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.633
Carbon 13 relative to the
normal Carbon 12.

00:35:20.633 --> 00:35:27.267
So when we dig up this fossil
fuel and burn it, we're now

00:35:27.267 --> 00:35:32.667
putting a lot of the dominantly
we're putting in

00:35:32.667 --> 00:35:37.733
the Carbon 12 into the
atmosphere, which takes

00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:42.400
whatever fraction we started
with, Carbon 13 to Carbon 12

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.367
in the atmosphere, and making
the overall carbon in the

00:35:47.367 --> 00:35:50.433
atmosphere lighter, because
we're mixing in more of the

00:35:50.433 --> 00:35:54.833
light carbon from the
fossil fuel burning.

00:35:54.833 --> 00:36:01.000
And indeed, if you plot Delta
Carbon 13, using the same kind

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.567
of Delta notation we used
before, from 1977 to 2002,

00:36:06.567 --> 00:36:08.033
it's a decreasing number.

00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:10.133
This is data from
the South Pole.

00:36:10.133 --> 00:36:13.300
Here's some data
from Mauna Loa.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.200
And it shows also a
decreasing trend.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.867
So some would argue, how do we
know that new carbon dioxide

00:36:21.867 --> 00:36:24.033
in the atmosphere is
coming from the

00:36:24.033 --> 00:36:26.867
burning of fossil fuels?

00:36:26.867 --> 00:36:29.500
Well, one argument would have
been, well we're putting twice

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.500
that much in the atmosphere.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.000
It makes sense that
at least half of

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.900
that would stick around.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.333
It's a pretty powerful
argument.

00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:38.667
But maybe this is even a more
powerful argument, because

00:36:38.667 --> 00:36:40.733
that carbon we're
putting it has a

00:36:40.733 --> 00:36:43.400
certain isotopic signature.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.767
And now we see that signature
showing up in

00:36:46.767 --> 00:36:49.300
the atmospheric carbon.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:55.200
So it's another argument for the
case that the burning of

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.600
fossil fuels is what's leading
to that increase in carbon

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.633
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:37:01.633 --> 00:37:02.300
Questions on that.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:02.633
Yes?

00:37:02.633 --> 00:37:05.467
STUDENT: Do we know
why it's depleted

00:37:05.467 --> 00:37:07.367
in the heavier isotope?

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:09.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
has to do with the plants that

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.433
originally took in
that carbon.

00:37:12.433 --> 00:37:16.667
So when a plant grows, as I
mentioned, it takes carbon in

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:19.100
from the atmosphere to
build its biomass.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.200
It actually prefers
the light isotope

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.200
over the heavy isotope.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.633
So when those plants, way back,
100 million years ago,

00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:30.733
were growing their biomass,
they were doing it

00:37:30.733 --> 00:37:33.233
preferentially out
of Carbon 12.

00:37:33.233 --> 00:37:36.933
And then when they got buried,
that left behind a lot of the

00:37:36.933 --> 00:37:38.967
Carbon 13 in the atmosphere.

00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:40.467
They buried a lot of
the Carbon 12.

00:37:40.467 --> 00:37:43.467
Now we're reversing that,
putting the Carbon 12 back in

00:37:43.467 --> 00:37:44.033
the atmosphere.

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:48.900
So it has to do it how plants
draw in CO2 into their leaves

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.067
and then use that to build
their biomass.

00:37:54.233 --> 00:37:55.467
Good question.

00:37:57.533 --> 00:38:01.467
So let's conclude, then,
our brief discussion

00:38:01.467 --> 00:38:02.767
of the carbon cycle.

00:38:02.767 --> 00:38:05.967
Fossil fuel burning is quickly
returning to the atmosphere

00:38:05.967 --> 00:38:09.800
carbon stored for millions of
years in crustal reservoirs.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.733
About half of the emitted CO2
stays in the atmosphere, and

00:38:17.733 --> 00:38:20.300
we estimate it'll stay there
for at least a few hundred

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:25.233
years, given the cycling rate
between the biosphere and the

00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:26.300
atmosphere.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:31.500
The CO2 emission rate has
increased with time since the

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.300
beginning of the Industrial
Revolution.

00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:39.367
And the current CO2
concentration, which is

00:38:39.367 --> 00:38:43.067
approximately 395 parts per
million by volume, is the

00:38:43.067 --> 00:38:44.600
highest in several
million years.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.267
Let me be careful of
what I say here.

00:38:47.267 --> 00:38:50.467
If I go back to this diagram,
which shows the last 400,000

00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:55.800
years, clearly, now that we're
up at 390 or 395, that's way

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.533
higher than anything we've
had during the Ice Ages.

00:38:59.533 --> 00:39:05.067
Yet if you go back way earlier,
say 50, 60, 100

00:39:05.067 --> 00:39:08.633
million years ago, you'll find
periods in the earth's history

00:39:08.633 --> 00:39:10.867
where the carbon dioxide
concentration in the

00:39:10.867 --> 00:39:15.133
atmosphere was actually much
higher than it is even today.

00:39:15.133 --> 00:39:17.833
So I don't want to make a
blanket statement saying that

00:39:17.833 --> 00:39:20.400
it's as high as it's
ever been.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:26.500
So instead I have said, it is
the highest it's been in

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.000
several million years.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.067
But again, this is the kind of
an argument that arises.

00:39:35.067 --> 00:39:38.867
Someone will say, well, yes,
we're putting a lot of CO2 in

00:39:38.867 --> 00:39:44.033
the atmosphere, but it hasn't
by any means reached an

00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:45.467
unprecedented level.

00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:49.500
There have been periods in the
ancient earth history where

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.267
carbon dioxide concentrations
have been

00:39:51.267 --> 00:39:53.767
much higher than this.

00:39:53.767 --> 00:39:57.633
So it all depends on what you
want to use for your reference

00:39:57.633 --> 00:40:02.567
timeframe as to what kind
of a statement you

00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:03.467
make in this regard.

00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:08.933
So be very careful about that
not to overstate the

00:40:08.933 --> 00:40:15.000
uniqueness of the current carbon
dioxide concentration.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.267
It's probably safe to say
there's never been a time in

00:40:17.267 --> 00:40:21.967
Earth's history where the CO2 is
increasing as rapidly as it

00:40:21.967 --> 00:40:25.767
is today, where the rate
has been as large.

00:40:25.767 --> 00:40:28.800
But in terms of the absolute
amount, the record we're

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.800
setting now is only the record
for the last few million

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.433
years, not for--certainly not
for all of Earth's history.

00:40:41.733 --> 00:40:45.467
So we've got a couple minutes
to begin the next section,

00:40:45.467 --> 00:40:50.200
which is the Holocene as a
reference time period.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.767
And I wanted you to be aware
of these particular often

00:40:53.767 --> 00:40:56.000
discussed dates.

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:04.633
The retreat of the last large
ice sheets was occurring

00:41:04.633 --> 00:41:09.433
around 11,000 years
before present.

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:11.167
That's right when the
ice was in the

00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:13.800
process of melting back.

00:41:17.367 --> 00:41:20.533
There was a warm period that
followed that called the

00:41:20.533 --> 00:41:25.033
Holocene Optimum about seven to
eight thousand years ago.

00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:32.067
That comes into the argument
when one is trying to find out

00:41:32.067 --> 00:41:36.400
whether the current
warm climate is

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.700
unique even in the Holocene.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:42.733
In other words, is our current
climate cooler or warmer than

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:46.733
this so-called Holocene
Optimum.

00:41:46.733 --> 00:41:50.700
Much more recently, the Medieval
Warm Period, which

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.567
was roughly 1000 A.D.,
is another

00:41:55.567 --> 00:41:56.633
important reference point.

00:41:56.633 --> 00:41:59.500
This, by the way, is the
period when the Vikings

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.500
colonized Greenland.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.467
There was a warm period when
they could grow crops in the

00:42:07.467 --> 00:42:09.733
coastal regions of Greenland.

00:42:09.733 --> 00:42:15.433
Then came the Little Ice Age
from 1400 to 1800 A.D. I'll

00:42:15.433 --> 00:42:19.167
say a bit more about that.

00:42:19.167 --> 00:42:21.000
And then we get into this
period, as you're seeing in

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.033
your data analysis in the lab,
of a more rapid climate change

00:42:26.033 --> 00:42:28.333
over the last hundred
years or so.

00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:30.867
So at the very minimum,
be aware of these.

00:42:30.867 --> 00:42:34.867
And I'll point these out to
you as we look at various

00:42:34.867 --> 00:42:37.800
historical reconstructions
of temperature.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:45.567
For example, this one goes back
12,000 years, so that's

00:42:45.567 --> 00:42:47.800
covering most of the Holocene.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.633
And there's lots of different
data sets represented.

00:42:50.633 --> 00:42:53.600
The black curve is an average
from a number of different

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.900
proxy data sets.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.900
A proxy data set is where you
haven't measured temperature

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:01.667
directly with a thermometer,
but you're keeping track of

00:43:01.667 --> 00:43:04.833
something that you think
depends on temperature.

00:43:04.833 --> 00:43:06.000
Maybe it's lake levels.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.333
Maybe it's isotopes.

00:43:07.333 --> 00:43:10.700
Maybe it's there's a lot of
different things you can use.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.467
They're all called climate
proxies, and they show a lot

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:18.067
of variability when you average
them together they

00:43:18.067 --> 00:43:20.467
show some trend.

00:43:20.467 --> 00:43:23.000
You see a rapid warming coming
out of the last Ice Age.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.167
Then you see this climatic
optimum, what I called the

00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:27.067
Holocene Optimum, right here.

00:43:27.067 --> 00:43:28.667
And then it cooled
off a little bit.

00:43:28.667 --> 00:43:30.833
And then there's some wiggles
near the end that we'll talk

00:43:30.833 --> 00:43:34.667
about in just a minute.

00:43:34.667 --> 00:43:37.500
And again these are plotted
as temperature anomalies.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.500
They've chosen some period of
time as a reference to compute

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.167
the temperature anomaly.

00:43:45.867 --> 00:43:48.567
This shows the last thousand
years or so.

00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:51.600
So we're looking at a more
recent period of time.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.467
And this is from the IPCC
report, I think.

00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:58.067
Now I've forgotten
which is which.

00:43:58.067 --> 00:44:03.933
Anyways, these are two different
authors' graphs

00:44:03.933 --> 00:44:08.167
describing the Northern
Hemisphere temperature

00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:11.000
reconstructions for the
last thousand years.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.500
And they look a lot alike, but
I wanted to point out some

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.933
differences, because it's on
these differences that many

00:44:16.933 --> 00:44:19.667
arguments will be built.

00:44:19.667 --> 00:44:22.467
For example, this author
has shown a lot of

00:44:22.467 --> 00:44:25.867
the different proxies.

00:44:25.867 --> 00:44:28.867
And if you average those
together, you'd probably get

00:44:28.867 --> 00:44:31.900
something that rose a little
bit in this period of time,

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.733
then sank a little bit more.

00:44:33.733 --> 00:44:36.867
Here's the Little Ice Age, a
little cooler in this period

00:44:36.867 --> 00:44:41.900
of time, and then you get the
rapid rise and rise again.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.800
This author has suppressed all
the different proxies and

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.867
instead just shown the standard

00:44:50.867 --> 00:44:54.200
deviation in the data.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.567
I think it's like the two
sigma and the one sigma.

00:44:57.567 --> 00:45:00.700
And while he does show a little
bit of a rise, the way

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.400
he's plotted it gives you the
idea that this is more of a

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:08.033
straight line, maybe slightly
decreasing, and then rising

00:45:08.033 --> 00:45:08.800
rapidly at the end.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:15.267
By the way, this is the famous
hockey stick diagram.

00:45:15.267 --> 00:45:20.967
Because that shape looks a
bit like a hockey stick.

00:45:20.967 --> 00:45:23.933
It used to be, twenty years ago,
when you Google hockey

00:45:23.933 --> 00:45:30.500
stick, all you would get would
be websites about hockey.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.900
Now when you Google hockey
stick, you get hockey and you

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.800
get climate change because of
all the controversy over this.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.233
The author this original
diagram, Mike Mann, was a PhD

00:45:40.233 --> 00:45:41.000
from our department.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.867
In fact, I sat on
his committee.

00:45:42.867 --> 00:45:44.967
This wasn't in his thesis,
it was in following work.

00:45:44.967 --> 00:45:48.233
But I've tried to follow
the arguments.

00:45:48.233 --> 00:45:53.333
The poor guy has been badgered
by the right wing anti-global

00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:55.467
warming crowd incessantly.

00:45:55.467 --> 00:45:58.533
Because the implication of this
diagram is that what's

00:45:58.533 --> 00:46:03.700
happened in the past hundred
years is unique in regards to

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.900
what's happened over the
last thousand years.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.267
But it seems to me you'd get
that impression from this

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:11.233
curve as well, even though
they've given you more of a

00:46:11.233 --> 00:46:15.867
warming period in here, in
Medieval Warm Period.

00:46:15.867 --> 00:46:18.933
Still, what's happening today
in steepness and in height

00:46:18.933 --> 00:46:20.033
seems to be unique.

00:46:20.033 --> 00:46:26.167
So all the arguments and the
dispute over the details of

00:46:26.167 --> 00:46:29.567
how this diagram were
constructed seem to be kind of

00:46:29.567 --> 00:46:32.767
moot now because we see
such a rapid rise the

00:46:32.767 --> 00:46:36.733
last 20 or 30 years.

00:46:36.733 --> 00:46:39.933
So, we're out of time
today, but we'll be

00:46:39.933 --> 00:46:41.833
continuing this on Monday.

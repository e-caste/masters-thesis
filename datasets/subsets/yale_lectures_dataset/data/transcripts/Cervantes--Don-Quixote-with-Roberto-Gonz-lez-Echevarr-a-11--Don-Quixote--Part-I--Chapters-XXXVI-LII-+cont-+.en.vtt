00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.131
Prof: I have been
speaking in the last lectures

00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:06.910
about the ending of Part I of
the Quixote,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.770
and today we finally get to the
end of the novel.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.493
I remind you,
again, that although you have

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:21.252
both parts bound as one book--
we all have it bound as one

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:27.097
book--this is the end of the
novel Cervantes set out to

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:31.537
write,
that he had no specific plan to

00:00:31.537 --> 00:00:36.077
write a second part,
which would not be published

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:41.250
anyway until a decade later,
in 1615.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.443
It is very easy to make the
mistake that what we're coming

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:55.510
to now is a provisional ending,
so avoid that mistake.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.192
It is very easy to make,
because of the book being bound

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:05.385
together, and also because of
the very nature of the ending of

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:08.280
Part I that is so complicated.
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.670
It is also easy to fall in that
mistake because you know that

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.890
Part II is coming as part of
your course,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.512
and that you are going to read
it, but not the readers of the

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:23.316
1605 Quixote in 1605 did
not have a second part that they

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:27.796
knew they were going to read,
so I want to dispel the notion

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.629
that this is a provisional
ending.

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:35.050
This is the ending of the novel
as Cervantes conceived it.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.411
There are critics who seem to
see in the ending hints that

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:48.330
Cervantes planned a second part,
but they are at best hints.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.254
Because second parts were often
written in the sixteenth

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:55.896
century, second parts of
chivalric romances had many

00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:56.610
parts.
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.099
The Celestina had many
second parts,

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.578
the Lazarillo had second
parts,

00:02:01.578 --> 00:02:05.299
the Guzmán de
Alfarache also had a second

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.092
part,
so it is conceivable to see in

00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:11.753
some of those hints the
possibility that Cervantes

00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:14.520
thought of writing a second
part,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.089
but it is not part of the plan
of the 1605 Quixote,

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:23.210
which stands on its own,
or was designed to stand on its

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.870
own as a book.
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.764
It is almost impossible to buy
it today separately,

00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:30.938
of course.
 

00:02:30.938 --> 00:02:35.419
Now, ending the Quixote
is a difficult thing to do

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.979
because it is no ordinary story
with a clear beginning;

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.400
that is, the birth of the hero,
for instance,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.141
and a linear plot in which the
protagonist pursues a goal that

00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:51.330
he either attains or fails to
attain;

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.520
hence, he is defeated or he
dies.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.961
It is not a love story like the
subordinate stories that we have

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:04.973
just seen being resolved at the
end in which the lovers get

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:09.378
married and presumably live
happily ever after.

00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:13.735
The Quixote,
as we have seen from start,

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:18.658
from the prologue to be
specific, is a meta-novel;

00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:24.639
a novel about the writing of a
novel among other things like;

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:31.853
it's a kind of meta-chivalric
romance in that it is a parody

00:03:31.853 --> 00:03:34.910
of a chivalric romance.
 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.396
Meta-novel is a novel that
includes a novel about the

00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:39.940
writing of the novel.
 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.181
This is quite common in
avant-garde fiction in the

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:47.123
twentieth century,
but it is the first time that

00:03:47.123 --> 00:03:51.440
it happens in literature in
the Quixote,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.699
to have this dimension of
criticism of the novel included

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.158
in the novel itself.
 

00:04:00.158 --> 00:04:07.180
So the business of bringing it
to a close is a complicated one

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.050
that involves closing several
narrative strands,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.769
plus the commentary or meta
novel part about the composition

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.172
of the novel--
You can't just come to the end

00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:23.759
and say,
the hero failed,

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.910
died, got married.
 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.785
No, no, no, you still have to
deal with all of this commentary

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.470
on the writing of the novel,
which is part of the novel.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.685
How do you end that?
 

00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:41.553
How do you close that?--I will
anticipate that you have already

00:04:41.553 --> 00:04:46.007
read that ending,
because the only possible

00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:50.180
ending to that narrative level
is the prologue,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.980
with all of its hesitations
about how to write it,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.843
which means,
with all of the problems about

00:04:57.843 --> 00:05:01.480
how to close the book;
the last episode of that

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.730
meta-fictional level is the
prologue,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:14.997
because closing the book,
which we literally do when we

00:05:14.997 --> 00:05:18.286
finish,
has many implications,

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:22.007
the most important of which is
that it implies or includes a

00:05:22.007 --> 00:05:24.240
statement,
by just doing it,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.836
about the structure,
about the shape of the

00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:30.163
book--Endings,
as I've mentioned,

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.540
are very important,
and I believe that I mentioned

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.110
the best book on the subject by
Frank Kermode,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.029
The Sense of an Ending.
 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.264
It's a brief but very,
very smart book that I

00:05:43.264 --> 00:05:47.012
recommend, if you're in
literature, that you pick up

00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:48.629
some day and read.
 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.209
So closing the book--after
you've got to the end and you

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:55.903
close it--
has many implications

00:05:55.903 --> 00:06:00.579
about--it's a statement about
the structure of the book,

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:01.879
the very fact that it has an
ending,

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.709
that you can close it.
 

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:08.740
These are the reasons why we do
have several endings or closures

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.769
and why the prologue has to be
the final or overarching one,

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:18.540
which necessarily suggests
circularity and self enclosure--

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.759
if you come back to the
beginning and make it the end--

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.620
and this circularity and this
self enclosure,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.389
we saw, is one of the
characteristics of the novel,

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.735
of the Quixote,
which is a fiction based on

00:06:35.735 --> 00:06:38.634
fictions,
and in where there are,

00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:42.639
or there seem to be,
no way out of the fiction,

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.541
because even the very author
whose name is on the cover is

00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.800
contained within that fiction.
 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.492
Miguel de Cervantes is
contained in the scrutiny of the

00:06:52.492 --> 00:06:54.298
books;
remember, his novel La

00:06:54.298 --> 00:06:57.718
Galatea is mentioned;
and then, Juan de Saavedra is

00:06:57.718 --> 00:07:01.593
mentioned in the captive's tale;
that's one of Cervantes' last

00:07:01.593 --> 00:07:04.416
names;
so it's also an allusion to

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:05.942
himself;
Rinconete and

00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:07.790
Cortadillo,
the story that you read for

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.838
today,
is a Cervantes story that is

00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:12.502
contained,
so even the author whose name

00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:15.699
is stamped on the cover is
within the fiction.

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.177
So I will discuss several
episodes that constitute partial

00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:24.970
endings, but reminding you that
the ending is the prologue.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:31.839
The first of those episodes has
to do with the en-closure,

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:34.660
with the enclosure of Don
Quixote--I'm playing with the

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.879
word enclosure--
by which I mean his caging.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:41.632
Caging Don Quixote is a literal
form of closure,

00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:43.149
you close him in.
 

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:48.060
It takes him out of circulation
for good, as the character that

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.279
he invented himself to be.
 

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:53.904
So I'm seeing,
even in the act of enclosure of

00:07:53.904 --> 00:07:57.047
the character,
a form, a kind of ending,

00:07:57.047 --> 00:07:58.899
a formal enclosure.
 

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:05.901
Now, Don Quixote is an outlaw,
as we saw in the arrest order

00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:10.649
read by the Holy Brotherhood
trooper--

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:12.459
remember, the one who can't
read very well--

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:16.519
who apprehends him after the
fracas at the inn.

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:20.617
Being a criminal,
others, particularly the

00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:26.012
priest, have to argue Don
Quixote's case to prevent the

00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:30.610
Holy Brotherhood from taking him
prisoner.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.480
Remember, this crime is against
the Crown,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.110
because the galley slaves were
under the purview of the Crown,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.570
so he would have been taken by
the Holy Brotherhood,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.139
arrested and perhaps even
executed.

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:44.990
Remember that Sancho says,
at some point,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.822
that he can hear the arrows of
the Holy Brotherhood buzzing

00:08:47.822 --> 00:08:50.474
around his ears,
because of course,

00:08:50.474 --> 00:08:56.126
Sancho being a commoner is more
liable to be arrested by the

00:08:56.126 --> 00:08:59.066
Holy Brotherhood,
whereas Don Quixote,

00:08:59.066 --> 00:09:01.496
being an hidalgo,
perhaps thought that he was

00:09:01.496 --> 00:09:02.178
above the law.
 

00:09:02.178 --> 00:09:07.009
But in any case,
the others, the priest,

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:12.969
particularly,
have to argue that Don Quixote

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:21.284
be released into their custody
because the priest argues very

00:09:21.284 --> 00:09:24.985
persuasively,
like a lawyer,

00:09:24.985 --> 00:09:29.639
being insane Don Quixote would
never be kept in jail;

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.190
he would never be convicted.
 

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.918
The insanity defense existed in
Spanish law since the thirteenth

00:09:34.918 --> 00:09:38.837
century;
so an insane man would be

00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:40.168
released.
 

00:09:40.168 --> 00:09:47.678
Again, Don Quixote's insanity
puts him above or beyond the

00:09:47.678 --> 00:09:48.470
law.
 

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.128
It is his most significant
characteristic as a literary

00:09:53.128 --> 00:09:57.269
character, and being insane he
accepts no law.

00:09:57.269 --> 00:10:02.413
But why is he caged,
and not simply arrested and

00:10:02.413 --> 00:10:07.558
taken home in shackles,
sitting on Rocinante?

00:10:07.558 --> 00:10:12.081
Why is it that at the end Don
Quixote's freedom has to be

00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:15.230
denied in such a spectacular
fashion?

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.645
And I mean spectacular,
because this caging of Don

00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:22.899
Quixote and being carried home
in this case is a spectacle.

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:29.590
There are two plot strands that
are winding up here.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:35.081
First, Don Quixote's quest,
and second, the priest and the

00:10:35.081 --> 00:10:40.960
barber's own quest to return him
home possibly to be cured.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.158
This is what justifies the
charade of the masks.

00:10:47.158 --> 00:10:50.509
Pragmatically,
the farce is staged because if

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:54.470
Don Quixote recognizes the
barber and the priest,

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.888
he will catch on about the plan
to return him home and he might

00:10:58.888 --> 00:10:59.529
resist.
 

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:03.129
But there is more to it.
 

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:07.272
It is really only at the level
of fiction that Don Quixote,

00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:11.629
the character that he himself
has created, can be captured.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:16.879
Alonso Quixano,
the hidalgo,

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:20.080
the modest hidalgo from
that place in la Mancha,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.370
can be arrested or apprehended,
but not Don Quixote,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.590
who is an invented literary
character,

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.940
unless it is within the world
of his fiction;

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.528
hence the make-believe.
 

00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:40.258
And this is the scene of the
caging on page 415 of the Jarvis

00:11:40.258 --> 00:11:44.958
translation:
"They made a kind of cage

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.207
with poles,
great-wise, large enough to

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:52.835
contain Don Quixote at his ease
[this is at the bottom of page

00:11:52.835 --> 00:11:57.158
415]: and immediately Don
Quixote and his companions,

00:11:57.158 --> 00:12:00.384
with Don Louis's servants,
and the officers of the Holy

00:12:00.384 --> 00:12:03.826
Brotherhood,
together with the innkeeper,

00:12:03.826 --> 00:12:08.649
all by the contrivance and
direction of the priest,

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:11.129
covered their faces,
and disguised themselves,

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:12.886
some one way,
some another,

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:16.807
so as to appear to Don Quixote
to be quite other persons as

00:12:16.807 --> 00:12:19.308
those he had seen in that
castle.

00:12:19.308 --> 00:12:22.332
This being done,
with the greatest silence they

00:12:22.332 --> 00:12:25.619
entered the room where Don
Quixote lay fast asleep,

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:28.379
and not dreaming of any such
accident;

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:32.990
and laying fast hold of him,
they bound him hand and foot,

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.360
so that, when he awakened with
a start,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.336
he could not stir,
nor do anything but look round

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:40.772
him,
and wonder to see such strange

00:12:40.772 --> 00:12:42.038
visages about him.
 

00:12:42.038 --> 00:12:45.567
And presently he fell into the
usual conceit that his

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:49.639
disordered imagination was
perpetually presenting to him,

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:52.724
believing that all these shapes
were goblins of that enchanted

00:12:52.724 --> 00:12:54.964
castle,
and that, without all doubt,

00:12:54.964 --> 00:12:58.072
he must be enchanted,
since he could not stir nor

00:12:58.072 --> 00:13:00.940
defend himself:
all precisely as the priest,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.326
the projector of this
stratagem, fancied it would fall

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:04.710
out.
 

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.245
Sancho alone,
of all that were present,

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:10.450
was in his perfect senses,
and his own figure;

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.058
and, though he wanted but
little of being infected with

00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:16.504
his master's disease,
yet he was not at a loss to

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:20.570
know who all of these
counterfeit goblins were;

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.914
but he does not open his lips
until he saw what this surprisal

00:13:25.914 --> 00:13:30.822
and imprisonment of his master
meant [we're talking about

00:13:30.822 --> 00:13:32.399
Sancho]."
 

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:36.852
The irony here,
in this episode,

00:13:36.852 --> 00:13:44.467
is that Don Quixote has
communicated to the others the

00:13:44.467 --> 00:13:51.940
freedom to act out whatever
fantasies they have.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.019
Isn't this contradictory?
 

00:13:54.019 --> 00:13:55.690
He is caged.
 

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.347
Forgiven them,
allowing them the freedom to

00:13:59.347 --> 00:14:01.090
cage him in a way.
 

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.556
He has contaminated them with
the imaginative freedom that he

00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:06.450
practices.
 

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.860
This theme began with the story
of Dorotea becoming Princess

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.346
Micomicona and her acting out a
chivalric romance invented on

00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:19.532
the spot by the priest and
performed by her as the priest

00:14:19.532 --> 00:14:22.000
invents this whole charade.
 

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.155
This whole charade,
which is like a brief

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:29.890
theatrical piece or interlude
taking place in the darkness of

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.678
the inn, is like the episode of
a nightmare.

00:14:33.678 --> 00:14:37.914
Don Quixote awakens to find
himself bound and surrounded by

00:14:37.914 --> 00:14:41.639
what seemed like goblins who put
him in the cage.

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:45.720
But is this a dream,
or is this reality?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.336
He's dealing
here--Cervantes--with a theme

00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:51.654
that was very common in the
sixteenth and seventeenth

00:14:51.654 --> 00:14:55.355
centuries and that was made
famous in a play called Life

00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:58.960
is a Dream,
by a playwright called

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.250
Calderón de la Barca--
you may have heard of it.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:10.759
 
 

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:17.062
This is a play from the 1630s,
but you can see that the theme

00:15:17.062 --> 00:15:22.418
is here of--if it's real life or
this is a dream.

00:15:22.418 --> 00:15:27.024
He has gone from being asleep
to finding himself surrounded by

00:15:27.024 --> 00:15:30.950
these strange figures in the
darkness of the inn,

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.269
so what could it be if not some
sort of nightmare?

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:36.820
So he believes that he is
enchanted.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.542
In the cage,
Don Quixote is like the

00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:42.109
prisoner he is,
in the sense that,

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:46.855
because prisoners were paraded
through the streets as a lesson

00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:48.100
to others.
 

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.269
Prisoners were routinely--I
think,

00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:54.129
even up through the nineteenth
century--

00:15:54.129 --> 00:15:56.590
paraded through the streets of
town,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:03.123
in carts or walking or being
flogged and so forth as a lesson

00:16:03.123 --> 00:16:04.428
to others.
 

00:16:04.428 --> 00:16:09.312
Part of their punishment was
their punishment being made

00:16:09.312 --> 00:16:12.653
public,
so it was no unusual for them

00:16:12.653 --> 00:16:14.200
to be,
probably, mostly,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.220
riding donkeys and stuff they
were paraded through towns,

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.570
but also in carts.
 

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:27.820
He is also like a circus freak
show,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.447
that's what this shows,
and you will see one or two in

00:16:32.447 --> 00:16:36.899
second part of the
Quixote traveled around in

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:39.501
carts,
and, in fact,

00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:47.210
plays were staged in carts in
town squares throughout Spain.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.268
That is, the company came in
the carts and the carts opened

00:16:50.268 --> 00:16:53.360
up and became the stage;
so the cart here is an

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.134
important and significant means
of communication of taking Don

00:16:58.134 --> 00:17:02.828
Quixote around as a prisoner and
also as some sort of a freak

00:17:02.828 --> 00:17:05.196
show,
the continuation of the

00:17:05.196 --> 00:17:09.000
theatrical episode of the
charade to put him in the cage.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:17.278
So this emphasizes that
theatrical quality that I

00:17:17.278 --> 00:17:19.348
mentioned.
 

00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:23.152
An important part of the
charade is the prophecy

00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:27.682
contrived and delivered in
dramatic highly affected tones

00:17:27.682 --> 00:17:31.027
by the barber,
which foretells of the future

00:17:31.027 --> 00:17:34.480
of Don Quixote as knight,
projecting a potential ending

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.837
to the story on that fictional
level which satisfies Don

00:17:37.837 --> 00:17:38.509
Quixote.
 

00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:42.144
Like the priest,
the barber is an author,

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:44.690
but also an actor besides.
 

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:49.348
I cannot do justice in my
performance,

00:17:49.348 --> 00:17:52.886
particularly in Jarvis'
eighteenth century English and

00:17:52.886 --> 00:17:59.047
with my Cuban accent,
but this is the prophecy by the

00:17:59.047 --> 00:18:02.730
barber:
"O Knight of the Sorrowful

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.338
Figure!
 

00:18:03.338 --> 00:18:06.848
let not the confinement you are
under afflict you;

00:18:06.848 --> 00:18:08.946
for it is expedient,
it should be so,

00:18:08.946 --> 00:18:11.861
for the more speedy
accomplishment of the adventure

00:18:11.861 --> 00:18:14.598
in which your great valour has
engaged you;

00:18:14.598 --> 00:18:19.247
which shall be finished when
the furious Manchegan lion shall

00:18:19.247 --> 00:18:22.500
be coupled with the white
Tobosan dove,

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.134
after having submitted their
stately necks to the soft

00:18:26.134 --> 00:18:28.740
matrimonial yoke:
from which unheard-of

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.648
conjunction shall spring into
the light of the world brave

00:18:32.648 --> 00:18:35.752
whelps,
which shall emulate the tearing

00:18:35.752 --> 00:18:37.690
claws of the valorous sire.
 

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.227
And this shall come to pass
before the pursuer of the

00:18:41.227 --> 00:18:45.309
fugitive nymph shall have made
two rounds to visit the bright

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:48.779
constellations in his rapid and
natural course.

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:53.398
And thou, O the most noble and
obedient squire that ever had

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:55.923
sword in belt,
beard on face,

00:18:55.923 --> 00:19:00.218
and smell in nostrils,
be not dismayed nor afflicted

00:19:00.218 --> 00:19:03.939
to see the flower of
knight-errantry carried thus

00:19:03.939 --> 00:19:05.798
away from thine eyes!
 

00:19:05.798 --> 00:19:09.711
for, ere long [before long],
if it so please the fabricator

00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:12.353
of the world,
thou shalt see thyself so

00:19:12.353 --> 00:19:15.980
exalted and sublimated that thou
shalt not know thyself,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.349
and shalt not be defrauded of
the promises made thee by thy

00:19:20.349 --> 00:19:21.328
noble lord.
 

00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:24.144
And I assure you,
in the name of Sage

00:19:24.144 --> 00:19:27.882
Mentironiana [Mentironiana,
from the word in Spanish

00:19:27.882 --> 00:19:30.844
'mentira' for lie,
this is the Sage]

00:19:30.844 --> 00:19:34.700
that thy wages shall be
punctually paid thee,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.890
as thou will see it effect:
follow,

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.000
therefore, the footsteps of the
valorous and enchanted knight,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.207
for it is expedient for you to
go where you may both rest:

00:19:44.207 --> 00:19:46.740
and because I am permitted to
say no more,

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.867
God be with you:
for I return I well know

00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:51.118
whither."
 

00:19:51.118 --> 00:19:55.832
So this is the prophecy
invented on the spot and

00:19:55.832 --> 00:20:02.265
delivered by the barber,
who is, as we can see,

00:20:02.265 --> 00:20:09.270
quite a ham himself,
and also quite able to imitate

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.990
the speech of chivalric
romances.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:19.430
This is the peak of playacting
in the Quixote.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.112
By the way, you can see the
prophecy that this is a

00:20:22.112 --> 00:20:25.330
projected ending of the novel;
that is Don Quixote and

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.788
Dulcinea will marry and have
children, and so forth.

00:20:28.788 --> 00:20:31.893
So, you see,
this is the projected ending

00:20:31.893 --> 00:20:35.849
within the fictions,
or beyond even the fictions Don

00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:37.788
Quixote has invented.
 

00:20:37.788 --> 00:20:42.114
So this is yet another level,
those levels that the novel

00:20:42.114 --> 00:20:45.279
shows throughout created by
characters.

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:48.828
This is the peak of playacting
in the Quixote,

00:20:48.828 --> 00:20:52.991
a culminating performance that
among other things displays

00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:55.838
Cervantes's talents as a
playwright,

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:58.500
particularly a playwright of
the interludes,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.588
the entremeses,
the funny skits that he wrote.

00:21:01.588 --> 00:21:05.126
Juan Palomeque's inn,
which has been used as a court

00:21:05.126 --> 00:21:09.497
of law and as a debating meeting
room where they debate what the

00:21:09.497 --> 00:21:13.075
basin is and so forth,
is now transformed into a

00:21:13.075 --> 00:21:16.690
theater as Don Quixote is
finally dismissed from it.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.813
This, too, is one of the
endings of the 1605

00:21:19.813 --> 00:21:23.009
Quixote and the novel has
several,

00:21:23.009 --> 00:21:25.993
as I mentioned,
and as we saw in the last class

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:28.720
when I discussed the
restitutions made--

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.450
Excuse me, we have a visitor in
the class,

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.058
an insect who is crawling in
the middle of the room...

00:21:36.058 --> 00:21:48.829
This is an added show free of
charge by this bug.

00:21:48.829 --> 00:21:54.390
Elena, maybe you can capture it.
 

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:55.579
Shall we kill it or not?
 

00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:58.130
No.
 

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:04.170
What is it?
 

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.170
It came out of Toby's bag.
 

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:11.278
I'm sorry.
 

00:22:11.278 --> 00:22:20.730
Well, if you can possibly pay
attention to my lecture.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:26.204
So please let us make a pause,
an interlude,

00:22:26.204 --> 00:22:32.953
while Toby, the valorous
knight, delivers us from this

00:22:32.953 --> 00:22:38.430
monster, who is very elusive,
it seems.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:23:33.798
 
 

00:23:33.798 --> 00:23:40.334
So this, too,
is one of the endings of the

00:23:40.334 --> 00:23:45.535
1605 Quixote,
and the novel has several,

00:23:45.535 --> 00:23:47.750
as I mentioned,
and as we saw in the last

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.462
class, and we discussed the
various restitutions to those

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:51.818
who had suffered damages.
 

00:23:51.818 --> 00:23:54.390
This ending is the most
consistent;

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.267
the prophecy with the fictional
world generated by Don Quixote

00:23:58.267 --> 00:24:01.890
and now inhabited by all of the
characters around him,

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.679
except for Sancho,
who knows what is going on but

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:08.598
prudently chooses not to
intervene.

00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:14.192
So now, we go on the road,
and we meet one of the most

00:24:14.192 --> 00:24:19.508
memorable characters in Part I,
the Canon of Toledo,

00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:24.519
who is traveling with a retinue
and meets this very strange

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:29.876
caravan carrying Don Quixote and
stops to find out what this is

00:24:29.876 --> 00:24:33.590
all about,
and after he does,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:39.073
the canon, Don Quixote,
and the priest engage in a

00:24:39.073 --> 00:24:43.991
discussion about commonplaces of
literary theory about the

00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:49.782
romances of chivalry,
and about mostly Aristotle's

00:24:49.782 --> 00:24:51.858
Poetics.
 

00:24:51.858 --> 00:24:57.477
Now, the relevant background
texts here are the

00:24:57.477 --> 00:25:04.192
Filosofía antigua
poética by Alonso

00:25:04.192 --> 00:25:08.469
Lopéz Pinciano,
known as "el

00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:10.833
Pinciano,"
1596-- in Spanish we write

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:12.849
"filosof
ía"

00:25:12.849 --> 00:25:16.538
today with an 'f,' that's just
the old fashioned spelling--

00:25:16.538 --> 00:25:23.131
and Lope de Vega's Arte
nuevo de hacer comedias en este

00:25:23.131 --> 00:25:25.519
tiempo,
1609, which is,

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:27.980
of course, published after
the Quixote,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:34.198
but which deals with topics
that are very relevant to this

00:25:34.198 --> 00:25:35.288
episode.
 

00:25:35.288 --> 00:25:39.910
Filosofía antigua
poética is a book in

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:44.372
which el Pinciano expounds
literary theory mostly derived

00:25:44.372 --> 00:25:47.240
from Aristotle's Poetics.
 

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.303
Now, it is one of the great
ironies of literary history that

00:25:53.303 --> 00:25:58.954
Cervantes was wildly innovative
in narrative fiction but

00:25:58.954 --> 00:26:03.578
exceedingly conservative in the
theater,

00:26:03.578 --> 00:26:06.980
except when writing his brief
comic of interludes.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.961
I don't have to emphasize now
how he was wildly innovative in

00:26:10.961 --> 00:26:12.288
narrative fiction.
 

00:26:12.288 --> 00:26:16.844
About the theater,
this episode is a vicious

00:26:16.844 --> 00:26:22.588
critique of Lope de Vega,
his enemy Lope de Vega,

00:26:22.588 --> 00:26:28.752
because Lope de Vega wrote
plays that did not follow

00:26:28.752 --> 00:26:35.273
Aristotle's Poetics,
the rules of unity of action,

00:26:35.273 --> 00:26:37.980
and of plays,
and of time;

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.925
everything had to happen in one
day, and one place,

00:26:40.925 --> 00:26:43.519
and there was only one plot,
and so forth.

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:49.593
Lope flaunted all of these
rules and his plays were

00:26:49.593 --> 00:26:56.152
historical plays that were
dubiously accurate about the

00:26:56.152 --> 00:26:57.608
history.
 

00:26:57.608 --> 00:26:58.940
He just made it up,
like Shakespeare.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.306
He was a great innovator who
wrote thousands of plays,

00:27:03.306 --> 00:27:07.588
and who really couldn't care
less about the rules.

00:27:07.588 --> 00:27:12.237
He invented the Spanish
National Theater by not

00:27:12.237 --> 00:27:14.460
following the rules.
 

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.363
But there were those,
like Cervantes himself who

00:27:17.363 --> 00:27:22.568
criticized him for that;
and he replied in 1609 in this

00:27:22.568 --> 00:27:29.528
very hilarious poem called
The New Art About How to Make

00:27:29.528 --> 00:27:35.296
Plays at This Time--
the title is very polemical,

00:27:35.296 --> 00:27:36.740
as you can see.
 

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.624
"Arte," art,
is supposed to be eternal and

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:43.319
it says "new art,"
new art is an oxymoron,

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:46.432
art cannot be new or old;
it's always the same,

00:27:46.432 --> 00:27:49.180
supposedly, if you follow the
Poetics;

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.442
to write comedies "at this
time," now,

00:27:53.442 --> 00:27:55.529
not in the past:
now.

00:27:55.529 --> 00:27:57.160
And so Lope was wildly
innovative.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.487
And he, as I've mentioned
before, just took over the

00:28:01.487 --> 00:28:05.876
Spanish theater,
and Cervantes with his plodding

00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:10.804
plays that followed the
Poetics did not have much

00:28:10.804 --> 00:28:11.788
success.
 

00:28:11.788 --> 00:28:18.066
He did write have a few staged,
and then he had the interludes

00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:21.153
also staged,
and a book of this appeared,

00:28:21.153 --> 00:28:23.854
and I will speak about that
when I speak about the

00:28:23.854 --> 00:28:26.500
transition between the first and
second part.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.920
But it is an irony that
Cervantes, who was so innovative

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.160
in the prose,
was so conservative;

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.865
so he is using,
of course, the canon and the

00:28:34.865 --> 00:28:38.829
priest to criticize Lope de Vega
for all of these irregularities

00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:39.900
in his plays.
 

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.222
Peter Russell,
who was a very reputable

00:28:43.222 --> 00:28:47.157
English cervantista,
Cervantes scholar,

00:28:47.157 --> 00:28:51.338
writes, quote:
"The discussion among the

00:28:51.338 --> 00:28:56.461
three characters [about theory]
has little bearing on the kind

00:28:56.461 --> 00:29:01.334
of discoveries about fiction
that Cervantes has been making

00:29:01.334 --> 00:29:03.769
empirically in his book.
 

00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:06.086
Hardly a word is said in it,
for example,

00:29:06.086 --> 00:29:07.710
about comic writing."
 

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.808
It is true.
 

00:29:08.808 --> 00:29:11.949
I think that Russell is right,
that Cervantes considered all

00:29:11.949 --> 00:29:14.608
of the theoretical issues the
canon puts forth,

00:29:14.608 --> 00:29:17.950
but that in practice he did not
adhere to any of them,

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:22.146
except that of verisimilitude,
that the novel does not deviate

00:29:22.146 --> 00:29:26.473
from the imitation of nature,
that its characters never

00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:31.133
engage in supernatural actions,
and that there are no actions

00:29:31.133 --> 00:29:34.930
that are beyond the credible;
that is verisimilitude.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.913
The most interesting part of
the discussion is when the canon

00:29:38.913 --> 00:29:42.830
and Don Quixote explore the
possibilities of the romances of

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.954
chivalry which,
in the end, the canon winds up

00:29:46.954 --> 00:29:49.766
praising,
because they afford the

00:29:49.766 --> 00:29:52.640
possibility of introducing
variety,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.884
which is one Renaissance
principle that Cervantes did

00:29:56.884 --> 00:29:57.618
follow.
 

00:29:57.618 --> 00:30:01.955
Besides, the canon himself
confesses that he has written

00:30:01.955 --> 00:30:05.819
the first hundred pages of a
chivalric romance.

00:30:05.819 --> 00:30:11.368
This is hilarious;
he is the critic of chivalric

00:30:11.368 --> 00:30:14.868
romances, and this is a typical
cervantean twist.

00:30:14.868 --> 00:30:18.505
We have seen that it was the
priest who read out loud The

00:30:18.505 --> 00:30:21.523
Novel of the Curious
Impertinent, and here the

00:30:21.523 --> 00:30:25.118
canon says:
"'I myself,' replied the

00:30:25.118 --> 00:30:27.482
canon,
'was once tempted to write a

00:30:27.482 --> 00:30:30.858
book of knight-errantry,
in which I purposed to observe

00:30:30.858 --> 00:30:33.450
all of the restrictions I have
mentioned;

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.280
and, to confess the truth,
I had gone through above a

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.858
hundred sheets of it:
and,

00:30:37.858 --> 00:30:42.038
to try whether they answered my
own opinion of it,

00:30:42.038 --> 00:30:44.769
I communicated it to some
learned and judicious persons,

00:30:44.769 --> 00:30:47.200
who were very fond of this kind
of reading,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.288
and to other persons who were
ignorant,

00:30:49.288 --> 00:30:52.440
and regarded only the pleasure
of reading extravagances;

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.530
and I met with a kind
approbation from all of them:

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.190
nevertheless I would proceed no
further,

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.050
as well in regard that I looked
upon it as a thing foreign to my

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.660
profession,
as because the number of the

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.346
unwise is greater than that of
the prudent: and though it is

00:31:08.346 --> 00:31:12.221
better to be praised by the few
wise than mocked by a multitude

00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:14.722
of fools,
yet I am unwilling to expose

00:31:14.722 --> 00:31:17.740
myself to the confused judgment
of the giddy vulgar,

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:28.453
to whose lot of the reading of
such books for the most part

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:32.365
falls.'"
Don Quixote,

00:31:32.365 --> 00:31:36.946
for his part as in reply,
makes up a chivalric interlude

00:31:36.946 --> 00:31:40.750
based on the story of the Knight
of the Lake,

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.692
which is quite remarkable and
with which in a sense he wins

00:31:45.692 --> 00:31:46.798
the debate.
 

00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:53.413
Both the canon and Don Quixote
are authors, as is the barber,

00:31:53.413 --> 00:31:56.828
and the priest,
and so forth.

00:31:56.828 --> 00:32:01.713
Now, there is a very elegant
joke embedded in this

00:32:01.713 --> 00:32:03.009
discussion.
 

00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:08.045
The canon, I maintain,
is the "idle reader,"

00:32:08.045 --> 00:32:11.750
the "desocupado
lector"

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:16.118
that Cervantes addressees in
the prologue.

00:32:16.118 --> 00:32:18.038
Remember, that he really says
"desocupado

00:32:18.038 --> 00:32:19.318
lector,"
idle reader.

00:32:19.318 --> 00:32:25.661
The joke is that canons were
supposed to have cushy jobs that

00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:31.896
allowed them the time to read
and devote themselves to other

00:32:31.896 --> 00:32:34.538
leisurely activities.
 

00:32:34.538 --> 00:32:38.054
"Vida de
canónigo"

00:32:38.054 --> 00:32:42.170
was, and still is,
a way of saying cushy life.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:54.828
Canons were in charge of
reading canon law.

00:32:54.828 --> 00:32:57.980
They were in churches,
and they were supposed to read

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.859
canon law, and pass judgment.
 

00:32:59.859 --> 00:33:01.769
Canon law is church law.
 

00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:06.108
That is, when we talked about
incest,

00:33:06.108 --> 00:33:08.951
and the prisoner of sex,
who would determine what is

00:33:08.951 --> 00:33:11.935
incest and what is not,
whom you can marry and whom you

00:33:11.935 --> 00:33:13.636
cannot marry,
and what is a sin,

00:33:13.636 --> 00:33:15.180
and not a sin,
and so forth.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.380
Canon law is very,
very important;

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.528
it's not to us anymore.
 

00:33:20.528 --> 00:33:23.167
And the separation between
crime and sin is beginning in

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:26.238
the seventeenth century and it's
not quite accomplished until the

00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:28.788
nineteenth century,
if you know what I mean.

00:33:28.788 --> 00:33:32.327
But canons had all of the time
in the world to sit around and

00:33:32.327 --> 00:33:35.529
read,
and so they were supposed to be

00:33:35.529 --> 00:33:39.119
well-fed,
fat, and they had the time to

00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:43.910
read romances of chivalry and
pass judgment as this.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:47.892
All of these figures of
authority in Cervantes are

00:33:47.892 --> 00:33:50.250
always slightly ridiculous.
 

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:56.515
They have some flaw or another,
but here it's yet another

00:33:56.515 --> 00:34:00.318
author, another internal author.
 

00:34:00.318 --> 00:34:03.815
We have seen many in the
Quixote: Don Quixote

00:34:03.815 --> 00:34:06.428
himself,
the priest, the barber we just

00:34:06.428 --> 00:34:08.260
saw,
Ginés de Pasamonte,

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:13.039
Cide Hamete Benengeli,
the translator,

00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:18.670
we have Grisóstomo,
Cardenio, and so forth.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.849
The Quixote is
literature within literature.

00:34:20.849 --> 00:34:24.420
Literature with its own
internal rules discussed not

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.152
from the outside;
this is what is important here,

00:34:28.152 --> 00:34:32.650
the characters are discussing
the nature of the work within

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.280
which they appear.
 

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.650
That is to say,
that there is a seamless

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.871
continuity between theory and
practice at the level of

00:34:39.871 --> 00:34:42.789
discourse, but not at the level
of ideology.

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:46.454
That is to say,
the novel does not comply with

00:34:46.454 --> 00:34:50.038
the theory propounded by the
Canon of Toledo,

00:34:50.038 --> 00:34:53.539
but flows from within its own
practice.

00:34:53.539 --> 00:34:57.586
Notice that the canon has not
finished the novel that he

00:34:57.586 --> 00:34:59.829
begun,
and that he also confesses that

00:34:59.829 --> 00:35:02.989
he's never finished reading the
novels that he began reading;

00:35:02.989 --> 00:35:04.219
he never gets to the end.
 

00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:09.159
I think that Cervantes is
pointing out here the difficulty

00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:13.170
of finishing a novel,
and finishing this novel in

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.309
particular,
and that is more important than

00:35:16.309 --> 00:35:20.442
all of the common places about
Aristotelian theory that the

00:35:20.442 --> 00:35:22.010
characters discuss.
 

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:26.159
A little background on
Aristotelian theory,

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:35.139
although I think that the best
thing to approach this passage

00:35:35.139 --> 00:35:43.170
of the Canon of Toledo which,
of course, has generated a lot

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.213
of criticism,
because all you have to do is

00:35:46.213 --> 00:35:49.208
give a scholar a set of rules
that were being propounded and a

00:35:49.208 --> 00:35:51.313
novel,
and scholars think that art is

00:35:51.313 --> 00:35:56.235
written following rules;
it is delusion of scholars and

00:35:56.235 --> 00:35:57.309
critics.
 

00:35:57.309 --> 00:36:03.739
But none of this theory can
contain the narrative,

00:36:03.739 --> 00:36:06.306
the experiments in narrative
that we have been observing in

00:36:06.306 --> 00:36:09.380
the Quixote,
all of those various levels of

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.458
fiction,
all of these intertwined

00:36:12.458 --> 00:36:17.476
stories, all of these very wild,
and at the same disciplined

00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:21.195
experiments about the nature of
fiction that we find in the

00:36:21.195 --> 00:36:22.110
Quixote.
 

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:27.025
All of that surpasses any
theory that was expounded in the

00:36:27.025 --> 00:36:31.768
Spanish Golden Age in the
sixteenth century or in Europe

00:36:31.768 --> 00:36:34.268
in the sixteenth century.
 

00:36:34.268 --> 00:36:39.280
So we cannot be here blinded by
the Filosofía antigua

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.992
poética,
by Aristotle's Poetics,

00:36:42.992 --> 00:36:45.570
by Plato and all of those
discussions,

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.150
because the poetics of the
Quixote are contained in its

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.568
own practice,
and its own practice includes

00:36:52.568 --> 00:36:55.559
the discussion of its own
poetics.

00:36:55.559 --> 00:36:59.516
But it does not take theory
from outside and applies it to

00:36:59.516 --> 00:37:02.570
the Quixote; that would
be foolish.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:08.646
What happens in the sixteenth
century in literary theory,

00:37:08.646 --> 00:37:14.724
in the sixteenth century,
is the well-worn debate between

00:37:14.724 --> 00:37:17.329
Plato and Aristotle.
 

00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:22.849
Plato was the first spoilsport
in the history of criticism,

00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:29.378
because he thought that art was
a negative influence in the

00:37:29.378 --> 00:37:32.552
republic,
and he wanted to banish the

00:37:32.552 --> 00:37:36.672
poets because art appealed to
the emotions and because art was

00:37:36.672 --> 00:37:39.992
based on imitation;
it couldn't be itself,

00:37:39.992 --> 00:37:43.409
it was always an imitation of
something.

00:37:43.409 --> 00:37:50.253
Although, Neo-Platonism is
important in other realms of

00:37:50.253 --> 00:37:57.664
sixteenth century literature,
that view of art and of poetry

00:37:57.664 --> 00:38:04.038
was countered by Aristotle's
critique of Plato in which he

00:38:04.038 --> 00:38:08.784
departs from--
his point of departure,

00:38:08.784 --> 00:38:13.949
his baseline,
is that humans tend to imitate;

00:38:13.949 --> 00:38:19.369
imitation is part of the human
condition, and that therefore,

00:38:19.369 --> 00:38:24.610
art is inherent in the human
animal because he imitates.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.751
That is, we are all
"micomicones,"

00:38:26.751 --> 00:38:29.889
if we remember that Princess
Micomicona was about imitation,

00:38:29.889 --> 00:38:35.409
was about mimesis,
that we are all monkeys,

00:38:35.409 --> 00:38:39.684
we imitate just like monkeys,
and this is what Aristotle

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:43.746
really propounds,
that imitation is a good thing,

00:38:43.746 --> 00:38:47.869
and that imitation in art leads
to a pleasurable,

00:38:47.869 --> 00:38:55.159
intellectual process that he
favors;

00:38:55.159 --> 00:38:57.650
that is at the base of
Aristotelian theory.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.208
Now, Aristotle then in the
Poetics gives a series of

00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:05.014
rules that he bases on his own
practice of reading the epic and

00:39:05.014 --> 00:39:08.880
the theater that is applied,
slavishly sometimes,

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.577
in the Renaissance with the
Renaissance penchant for

00:39:13.577 --> 00:39:15.880
reviving the classics.
 

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.309
That is basically what is at
stake here.

00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:21.210
It's parallel to what I
mentioned in the last class

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:24.518
about the rules of government
that are being drawn up then

00:39:24.518 --> 00:39:27.476
from Machiavelli on and it's
very much a part of the

00:39:27.476 --> 00:39:30.030
Renaissance who try to draw up
rules,

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.750
and the rules of behavior that
were contained in Baltasare

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.099
Castiglione's The
Courtier.

00:39:36.099 --> 00:39:39.230
These are all parallel
movements.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:43.873
But in the case of the
Quixote none of this theory

00:39:43.873 --> 00:39:47.454
is ultimately relevant,
it is contained within it,

00:39:47.454 --> 00:39:52.945
it is discussed,
but it does not drive the book,

00:39:52.945 --> 00:39:57.889
it does not control the
poetics,

00:39:57.889 --> 00:40:01.518
Cervantes's poetics in the
Quixote,

00:40:01.518 --> 00:40:07.869
which surpasses all of that by
quite a bit.

00:40:07.869 --> 00:40:13.815
So I will not expound very much
beyond that on the presence of

00:40:13.815 --> 00:40:18.894
Aristotle's Poetics,
there is a lot of criticism,

00:40:18.894 --> 00:40:23.052
and one of those who has
written eloquently about it is

00:40:23.052 --> 00:40:25.670
E.C. Riley,
whom you have met in my

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:28.981
Casebook,
in the essay about life and

00:40:28.981 --> 00:40:33.369
art, and so forth,
in Don Quixote.

00:40:33.369 --> 00:40:37.322
He wrote a book,
he died not too long ago,

00:40:37.322 --> 00:40:41.659
about the theory of the novel
in Cervantes.

00:40:41.659 --> 00:40:43.349
Cervantes Theory of the
Novel,

00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:45.110
which is a classic of Cervantes
criticism,

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:48.807
but I think that ultimately
what I have said here today

00:40:48.807 --> 00:40:50.110
takes care of it.
 

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:53.693
Now, Cervantes,
of course, expounded on

00:40:53.693 --> 00:40:57.963
literature in other books,
he has a long poem called

00:40:57.963 --> 00:41:01.021
Viaje del Parnaso,
A Voyage to Parnasus,

00:41:01.021 --> 00:41:03.878
which is a book of literary
criticism about the literature

00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:06.882
of his time,
and in the prologues to his

00:41:06.882 --> 00:41:10.230
various books he expounds on
criticism,

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.119
and so forth.
 

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:16.518
But the problem is,
as with all writers of fiction,

00:41:16.518 --> 00:41:21.445
that Cervantes has this theory
appear always in dialogue,

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:25.230
in a dialogue among various
characters.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:28.931
You cannot really pinpoint him
as to what Cervantes's

00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:32.949
preference is in all of this,
but I think that the point to

00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:36.610
remember is that the canon is a
slightly ridiculous figure,

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:39.731
that we cannot take him as a
figure of authority who has

00:41:39.731 --> 00:41:43.079
given us the poetics of the
Quixote by any means,

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:46.989
that he himself has tried to
write a romance of chivalry.

00:41:46.989 --> 00:41:51.050
Now, another element that is
present in this episode is the

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:55.039
critique or the criticisms of
the romances of chivalry.

00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:58.523
They were criticized severely
in the sixteenth century by

00:41:58.523 --> 00:42:01.510
figures as important as Erasmus
of Rotterdam,

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.724
another one of these
Renaissance figures that I have

00:42:03.724 --> 00:42:07.489
mentioned before;
Vives and others criticized the

00:42:07.489 --> 00:42:12.518
romances of chivalry for their
being potentially a bad

00:42:12.518 --> 00:42:16.918
influence on society,
in terms that Cervantes echoes

00:42:16.918 --> 00:42:21.045
mockingly in the Quixote
when he says that he's written

00:42:21.045 --> 00:42:24.630
the book to do away with the
romances of chivalry.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:28.809
So there is in this episode,
too, also an echo of those

00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:32.059
debates about the romances of
chivalry,

00:42:32.059 --> 00:42:34.880
because, as I mentioned,
they were quite popular at one

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.998
point,
aided by the fact that they

00:42:36.998 --> 00:42:38.980
could be,
they were printed,

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:43.349
and distributed in relatively
large numbers for the period.

00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:48.005
So this is what is at stake in
these episodes involving the

00:42:48.005 --> 00:42:51.007
Canon of Toledo,
which I think are also

00:42:51.007 --> 00:42:53.829
preparing us for the ending of
the book,

00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:55.250
which, as I said,
is the prologue.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:43:00.277
It is one of the most sustained
takes on the poetics of the

00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:05.045
chivalric romances and on
poetics and on literary theory

00:43:05.045 --> 00:43:07.300
in the Quixote.
 

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.900
So the important thing to
remember is verisimilitude;

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.268
Cervantes never deviates from
verisimilitude;

00:43:13.268 --> 00:43:17.523
that is, the characters never
engaged in anything that is

00:43:17.523 --> 00:43:21.398
supernatural or do something
that is beyond what the

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:24.969
commonsense of a normal reader
would allow.

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:28.726
So much for this episode which
has, as I said,

00:43:28.726 --> 00:43:32.820
elicited a lot of criticism as
you can imagine;

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.949
and that I find very
entertaining because I think

00:43:35.949 --> 00:43:39.730
that the figure of the canon is
really a very funny one.

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:43.188
You will see that religious
figures appear in the

00:43:43.188 --> 00:43:46.445
Quixote, well,
the priest has been around the

00:43:46.445 --> 00:43:47.869
whole first part.
 

00:43:47.869 --> 00:43:52.529
Others will appear in Part II,
one in particular,

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:56.217
who is depicted in very
negative terms,

00:43:56.217 --> 00:43:58.159
as you will see.
 

00:43:58.159 --> 00:44:01.931
The canon is not,
the canon is very learned,

00:44:01.931 --> 00:44:05.003
very well read,
and funny in his own

00:44:05.003 --> 00:44:06.670
contradictions.
 

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:10.795
Notice, of course,
that the whole debate takes

00:44:10.795 --> 00:44:14.528
place over lunch,
this picnic that they have

00:44:14.528 --> 00:44:18.400
organized in this nice valley
with food that they have

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.664
obtained from the inn,
in this locus amoenus

00:44:22.664 --> 00:44:26.210
where we will find a pastoral
interlude,

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:30.103
which is another one of those
stories that almost repeats

00:44:30.103 --> 00:44:33.860
previous ones towards the end of
the Quixote.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.585
It is, again,
a way of lending substance to

00:44:37.585 --> 00:44:40.869
the book by these inner
references.

00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:44.902
The episode is like a new
version of the Grisóstomo

00:44:44.902 --> 00:44:47.925
and Marcela episode,
but it also recalls parts of

00:44:47.925 --> 00:44:50.018
the some of the intertwined love
stories.

00:44:50.018 --> 00:44:54.503
Leandra is a young beauty in
her father's care who is desired

00:44:54.503 --> 00:44:56.829
by many men;
Eugenio, the goatherd,

00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:58.514
and Anselmo,
another goatherd,

00:44:58.514 --> 00:45:00.550
are Leandra's principle
suitors.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:03.175
They appear to be perfect
candidates to marry her,

00:45:03.175 --> 00:45:06.340
as in the earlier story of
Grisóstomo and Marcela.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.059
They're both well off and so
forth.

00:45:09.059 --> 00:45:14.280
Then there appears Vicente de
la Rosa who woos her with his

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.599
wiles and lies,
because Leandra is no Marcela;

00:45:18.599 --> 00:45:22.469
she allows herself to be
seduced by Vicente de la Rosa,

00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:25.650
who is a modern man,
in that he has made himself,

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.931
almost literally,
the way that he uses three sets

00:45:28.931 --> 00:45:30.715
of clothes,
he has three suits,

00:45:30.715 --> 00:45:33.371
and he shuffles them in such a
way that it appears that he has

00:45:33.371 --> 00:45:35.739
many;
and he is a miles

00:45:35.739 --> 00:45:41.092
gloriosus--it's a term in
Latin--a self glorifying

00:45:41.092 --> 00:45:45.536
soldier, solider,
miles gloriosus from

00:45:45.536 --> 00:45:47.760
classical comedy.
 

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.978
This is a soldier who goes
around boasting of all of his

00:45:50.978 --> 00:45:54.840
great feats of arms and showing
scars that he has from battles,

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.820
as Vicente de la Rosa does here.
 

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.197
He plays the guitar,
and so forth,

00:46:01.197 --> 00:46:04.010
and this is the way that he
woos her.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:07.331
They run off to the wild,
the same kind of landscape that

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:11.000
we found in the Sierra Morena,
where she is robbed,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.420
but surprisingly not sexually
ravaged,

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.985
which is a curious detail that
I have not been able to ever

00:46:18.985 --> 00:46:20.010
understand.
 

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.900
What does that reveal about
Vicente de la Rosa?

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:28.079
It may be as bad that he was
impotent and that all of these

00:46:28.079 --> 00:46:33.260
Don Juan like adventures that he
seems to be engaged in are

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:38.275
really a cover for that,
but I find it amazing that she

00:46:38.275 --> 00:46:42.684
has been left untouched,
and that that satisfies her

00:46:42.684 --> 00:46:44.219
father very much.
 

00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:46.320
But the story is left is
unfinished;

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.018
it hasn't concluded.
 

00:46:48.018 --> 00:46:49.760
No one knows what is going to
happen,

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.152
and I have wondered why,
and I think that the reason is

00:46:53.152 --> 00:46:56.733
that we are now coming to the
end of the novel and what is

00:46:56.733 --> 00:46:59.309
being narrated is kind of a
present,

00:46:59.309 --> 00:47:01.400
and a present cannot have a
conclusion,

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.300
because current events are
current,

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:11.239
and to give them a conclusion
is an artificial way of

00:47:11.239 --> 00:47:13.510
finishing them.
 

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:17.980
I think that's the only way to
explain this unfinished story

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.329
that is just left unfinished.
 

00:47:20.329 --> 00:47:22.969
We come to the end.
 

00:47:22.969 --> 00:47:26.498
Finally, the priest,
barber, Sancho and Don Quixote

00:47:26.498 --> 00:47:30.099
arrive back in Don Quixote's
village on a Sunday.

00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:32.679
Is this significant?
 

00:47:32.679 --> 00:47:36.172
It is the day of rest,
of leisure, of feasts,

00:47:36.172 --> 00:47:40.460
consonant perhaps with Don
Quixote's arrival in a cage,

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.079
as if he were part of a fair.
 

00:47:43.079 --> 00:47:48.675
But to me the most moving and
interesting detail is that Don

00:47:48.675 --> 00:47:52.090
Quixote does not know where he
is.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.820
If you go to page 458,
at the very end:

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.000
"All of this
discourse"--

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.074
at the top of page
458--"All of this discourse

00:48:00.074 --> 00:48:03.885
passed between Sancho Panza and
his wife Teresa Panza [you will

00:48:03.885 --> 00:48:06.960
see that her name changes
throughout the book;

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.309
this is another one of
Cervantes's careless mistakes,

00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:13.110
she goes Juana Gutierrez and so
forth],

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:17.389
while the housekeeper and the
niece received Don Quixote,

00:48:17.389 --> 00:48:20.704
and having pulled off his
clothes, laid him in his own

00:48:20.704 --> 00:48:21.079
bed.
 

00:48:21.079 --> 00:48:27.556
He looked at them with eyes
askew, not knowing perfectly

00:48:27.556 --> 00:48:30.030
where he was."
 

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:39.090
After all of these adventures,
home is no longer familiar to

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:41.239
Don Quixote.
 

00:48:41.239 --> 00:48:45.188
It is not, if it ever was,
the abode of the canny,

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:46.880
but of the uncanny.
 

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.362
Instead of curing him,
it seems to me,

00:48:49.362 --> 00:48:52.719
bringing him home has made him
madder than ever.

00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:56.637
Perhaps the circularity of the
event, coming back again has

00:48:56.637 --> 00:49:00.958
made him dizzy to the point that
he cannot recognize even his own

00:49:00.958 --> 00:49:01.500
bed.
 

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.090
This is what I found very
moving.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:06.539
He's in his own bed and he
can't even recognize it.

00:49:06.539 --> 00:49:09.121
Now, he will,
again, get out of it,

00:49:09.121 --> 00:49:13.603
although we will meet him in it
at the beginning of Part II,

00:49:13.603 --> 00:49:15.349
but not quite soon.
 

00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:19.775
In the fiction of Part II he
will get out of it,

00:49:19.775 --> 00:49:23.730
but a long decade later in real
history.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:28.409
I was going to wind up today by
talking about Rinconete and

00:49:28.409 --> 00:49:31.851
Cortadillo,
which you were supposed to read

00:49:31.851 --> 00:49:33.583
for today,
and I'm going to do it very

00:49:33.583 --> 00:49:36.478
briefly,
but we will come back to The

00:49:36.478 --> 00:49:40.663
Exemplary Novels,
again, to discuss Rinconete

00:49:40.663 --> 00:49:43.949
and Cortadillo perhaps a
little more,

00:49:43.949 --> 00:49:46.570
and also because we will be
reading several of them.

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:52.275
Sixteen thirteen is the date of
the Novelas ejemplares,

00:49:52.275 --> 00:49:56.954
called here--this is the
edition that you're using,

00:49:56.954 --> 00:50:00.510
I assume-Exemplary
Stories.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.989
It's impossible to find a good
title for it because

00:50:03.989 --> 00:50:08.094
novellas at the time
meant short novels or long short

00:50:08.094 --> 00:50:11.206
stories,
but today if you say exemplary

00:50:11.206 --> 00:50:13.960
novels,
you think of longer novels.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.228
Short stories,
the term didn't really emerge

00:50:17.228 --> 00:50:20.039
until the late eighteenth
century,

00:50:20.039 --> 00:50:22.918
early nineteenth century with
the appearance of newspapers and

00:50:22.918 --> 00:50:25.474
all of that;
so this is why there is no good

00:50:25.474 --> 00:50:28.409
way of translating it,
and when a Spanish speaker

00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:31.527
reads it today he's mislead by
the title, Novelas

00:50:31.527 --> 00:50:32.750
ejemplares.
 

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:38.056
The point is,
as Cervantes became well known

00:50:38.056 --> 00:50:43.239
because the Quixote did
so well,

00:50:43.239 --> 00:50:46.949
and publishers became
interested in publishing his

00:50:46.949 --> 00:50:48.539
works for a change.
 

00:50:48.539 --> 00:50:50.780
They had all ready fleeced him
with the Quixote,

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.980
so they were ready to do so
again with other books.

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:58.719
So he was able to publish his
collection of stories that,

00:50:58.719 --> 00:51:02.219
as I told you in an earlier
class, does not have the

00:51:02.219 --> 00:51:06.269
overarching fiction that the
Decameron and other such

00:51:06.269 --> 00:51:09.382
books have;
all of the characters leave the

00:51:09.382 --> 00:51:13.277
city because of the plague,
get together somewhere and then

00:51:13.277 --> 00:51:16.300
each one tells a story on a
different day.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:21.460
This is the Decameron's
overarching fiction.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.610
The Exemplary Novels
doesn't have that,

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:28.179
it is a one-man show,
twelve stories with a prologue

00:51:28.179 --> 00:51:30.070
by Miguel de Cervantes.
 

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:33.856
Cervantes, as I have mentioned
favored the long short story

00:51:33.856 --> 00:51:37.184
like several ones we have
encountered intertwined in

00:51:37.184 --> 00:51:40.644
the Quixote and
individually in The Novel of

00:51:40.644 --> 00:51:46.989
the Curious Impertinent,
and he had a few in reserve,

00:51:46.989 --> 00:51:51.353
obviously,
as we recall the papers that

00:51:51.353 --> 00:51:55.253
someone left at the inn,
Juan Palomeque's inn,

00:51:55.253 --> 00:51:58.949
including at least a couple of
stories by Cervantes.

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:01.639
These were stories that were
circulating in manuscript.

00:52:01.639 --> 00:52:05.929
Remember that I told you that
stories still circulated in

00:52:05.929 --> 00:52:09.989
manuscript in spite of the
development of printing.

00:52:09.989 --> 00:52:14.403
In the book,
he collects stories with very

00:52:14.403 --> 00:52:18.514
diverse themes and styles;
it is like a series of

00:52:18.514 --> 00:52:19.659
narrative experiments.
 

00:52:19.659 --> 00:52:24.260
Some, like Rinconete,
are akin the picaresque,

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:27.268
others to the Byzantine
romance;

00:52:27.268 --> 00:52:30.130
others are love stories,
etcetera.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.340
We are going to be reading
several here.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.420
They are superb.
 

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.735
I think that even Cervantes had
not published the Quixote

00:52:38.735 --> 00:52:42.367
he still would have become a
major author by just this

00:52:42.367 --> 00:52:44.559
collection of short stories.
 

00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:46.777
You will see the Glass
Graduate and all of the

00:52:46.777 --> 00:52:49.168
others that we're going to read
that are really excellent

00:52:49.168 --> 00:52:49.679
stories.
 

00:52:49.679 --> 00:52:54.335
Now, Rinconete and
Cortadillo is obviously of a

00:52:54.335 --> 00:52:57.500
picaresque thematic and
ambiance,

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:02.639
and it takes place in the
center of picaresque life,

00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:06.313
Seville, but it does not follow
the autobiographical form of the

00:53:06.313 --> 00:53:09.869
picaresque and that Cervantes
made fun of through Ginés

00:53:09.869 --> 00:53:12.300
de Pasamonte--
Remember?

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.079
When he says,
how can the book be over if my

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:17.750
life is not over?
 

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:19.050
He's making fun of that.
 

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:23.300
So you will see that he does
use it in the Dialogue of the

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.418
Dogs at the end,
but you will see in what

00:53:26.418 --> 00:53:28.190
experimental fashion.
 

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:32.840
To me, the point is that that
Rincón and Cortado,

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.400
known by the diminutive
Rinconete and Cortadillo,

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:42.932
become pícaros
because it is already a literary

00:53:42.932 --> 00:53:45.775
character;
so they become

00:53:45.775 --> 00:53:52.353
pícaros the same
way that Don Quixote becomes a

00:53:52.353 --> 00:53:57.590
knight,
and there are hints of this in

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:01.119
the first inn,
when we learn that the

00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:05.012
innkeeper of that first inn had
been a pícaro and

00:54:05.012 --> 00:54:08.768
he tells stories,
and we get the sense that some

00:54:08.768 --> 00:54:13.483
of these pícaros
that the innkeeper assembled

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:17.956
within those emporia of
picaresque life that he mentions

00:54:17.956 --> 00:54:20.070
had chosen that life.
 

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:24.782
It was not that they were just
simply poor boys who were out

00:54:24.782 --> 00:54:28.838
looking for a way of living,
but that they had chosen that

00:54:28.838 --> 00:54:30.382
life,
so they had--as they said in

00:54:30.382 --> 00:54:32.840
the sixties in this country--
they had dropped out,

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.318
as it were, dropped out of
society to become

00:54:35.318 --> 00:54:36.760
pícaros.
 

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.083
And this is,
I think, what is the case of

00:54:39.083 --> 00:54:41.342
Rincón and Cortado,
who, at the end,

00:54:41.342 --> 00:54:43.130
decide not to be
pícaros any more,

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.929
and that is the end of their
adventures.

00:54:45.929 --> 00:54:49.565
It is not that they go to the
galleys or that they are nabbed

00:54:49.565 --> 00:54:53.202
or they have to write a story
because they are married to the

00:54:53.202 --> 00:54:55.869
mistress of an archpriest and so
forth--

00:54:55.869 --> 00:54:58.880
I'm alluding to Lazarillo de
Tormes.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.367
I think the other very
significant element here is

00:55:03.367 --> 00:55:08.653
Monipodio's brotherhood,
Monipodio is the chief criminal

00:55:08.653 --> 00:55:11.472
here,
who runs the whole brotherhood

00:55:11.472 --> 00:55:13.800
in very well organized fashion.
 

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.226
He's, again,
one of these figures of

00:55:16.226 --> 00:55:19.000
authority who is slightly
ridiculous,

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.079
and he's surrounded by a bevy
of petty criminals,

00:55:23.079 --> 00:55:28.518
prostitutes and pimps all of
who have their own features,

00:55:28.518 --> 00:55:31.255
physical features--remember,
I talk about the physical

00:55:31.255 --> 00:55:33.320
features in some of these
characters--

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:38.601
and it is not a somber sordid
life that is depicted as the

00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:40.268
picaresque life.
 

00:55:40.268 --> 00:55:41.960
On the contrary,
it seems like a lot of fun.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.230
Everybody is having fun,
even the prostitute,

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:51.699
who comes complaining about her
pimp beating her up at the end,

00:55:51.699 --> 00:55:54.978
she actually reveals that it
was really an S&amp;M

00:55:54.978 --> 00:55:58.213
sadomasochistic,
a little mutual sexual game

00:55:58.213 --> 00:55:59.960
that they were playing.
 

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.949
So there's nothing evil in all
of these pícaros.

00:56:03.949 --> 00:56:05.260
This is very much Cervantes.
 

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.760
As I've told you,
even the worst characters have

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.079
some good and are never totally
evil, and certainly none of

00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:15.090
these are totally evil.
 

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:19.853
Repolido is her pimp's name,
and it means that he is bald,

00:56:19.853 --> 00:56:23.030
probably from some venereal
disease.

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:25.869
I mean, Cervantes deals with
the most sordid,

00:56:25.869 --> 00:56:28.929
but in a way that does not read
as a sordid story,

00:56:28.929 --> 00:56:33.626
and I think also what is
interesting here is that

00:56:33.626 --> 00:56:39.789
Monipodio's brotherhood seems
like the blueprint for society.

00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:44.873
That it is the kernel of
society where rules are being

00:56:44.873 --> 00:56:48.094
created,
and where there is a kind of

00:56:48.094 --> 00:56:51.960
self enclosed atmosphere created
by those rules,

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.152
as if this were the beginning
of laws and the beginning of a

00:56:56.152 --> 00:56:59.050
certain mode of speech,
and so forth.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.577
This is, I think,
what is behind this

00:57:01.577 --> 00:57:03.947
brotherhood;
it's one of the Renaissance

00:57:03.947 --> 00:57:06.835
topics about utopia,
this is a counter utopia--I am

00:57:06.835 --> 00:57:09.458
referring now to Thomas More,
another one of those

00:57:09.458 --> 00:57:11.480
Renaissance figures that I want
you to remember--

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.012
but utopia, what it means is
that it's a well ordered

00:57:14.012 --> 00:57:16.291
society,
in which everything has been

00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:18.253
thought of,
and advanced,

00:57:18.253 --> 00:57:22.514
and there are rules,
and this is what Monipodio's

00:57:22.514 --> 00:57:27.929
brotherhood is like is a counter
utopia that is organized with

00:57:27.929 --> 00:57:33.079
the well wrought sort of polish
of a work of fiction.

00:57:33.079 --> 00:57:40.355
So we will return to this in
our next class which will come

00:57:40.355 --> 00:57:43.239
after Tuesday's exam.
 

00:57:43.239 --> 00:57:49.000

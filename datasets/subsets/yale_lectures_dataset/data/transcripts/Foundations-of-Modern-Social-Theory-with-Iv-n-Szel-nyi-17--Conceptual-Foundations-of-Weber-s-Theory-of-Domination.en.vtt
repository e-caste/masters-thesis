00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.950
Prof: All right,
good morning.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.460
I want to do what I did last
time around the test;

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.281
just to walk very quickly
through the test questions and

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:16.100
sort of test myself;
how would I respond to them?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.030
There is a lot for today to
cover.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.280
So I will rush.
 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.327
Let me just one more time
emphasize, you have plenty of

00:00:31.327 --> 00:00:33.415
time to do that.
 

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:34.590
Right?
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.490
I have a discussion section at
7:00.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.700
So I don't want to risk that
something is going on wrong in

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.790
the internet.
 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.110
So I will post this before my
discussion section,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.970
before 7:00;
exactly when, I don't know.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.640
I mean, I have these anxieties,
what Hobbes was talking about,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.450
and therefore I don't want--I
prefer to be five minutes early,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.978
rather than being an hour late.
 

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:01.548
Right?
 

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:04.694
So sometime before 7:00 you
will find it,

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:08.390
and you have to send your
answer around 9:00.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.402
Some of you communicated that
you need another time,

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:19.000
because you have already
engagements;

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.191
it is always you have to work
this out with your discussion

00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:29.742
section leader--right?--and your
discussion section leader will

00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:32.250
take care of your needs.
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.459
And be brief. Right?
 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.510
Sort of the two questions
should be about--more like four

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.379
to six double-spaced pages,
rather than much longer.

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.090
I mean, we will accept eight.
 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.030
So you will not be penalized if
you are longer.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.310
But the point is not to be
long, but to be crispy.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.933
And again the point is,
you know, you try to show the

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:05.736
different views of the authors,
and then comment on it,

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:08.581
whether-- which is more
sensible.

00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:09.650
Right?
 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.884
And a third,
a third, a third--right?--of a

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:14.580
paper goes this way.
 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.990
You spend a third presenting
one author;

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.060
a third about an opponent of
that author;

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.896
and then your reflections on
it.

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:24.629
Right?
 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.300
That's about it.
 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.060
So let me then rush through.
 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.173
This is not an easy
question--right?--Marx's theory

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:35.968
of alienation;
Nietzsche's or Freud's theory

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:37.610
of civilization.
 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.194
I mean, there is a common
feature--right?--between the

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.580
three authors.
 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.900
This really asks to create a
controversy between the two.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.660
Right?
 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.030
You can pick two, usually.
 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.203
The common feature is that they
are all concerned about

00:02:58.203 --> 00:03:03.854
modernity and people's sense of
being lost and being without

00:03:03.854 --> 00:03:06.250
control in modernity.
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.383
And the problem of modernity:
that we are too much

00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:14.854
controlled, and the control is
increasingly inside us,

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:17.637
rather than outside,
and coercive.

00:03:17.637 --> 00:03:18.650
Right?
 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.610
I think that's the common
feeling.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.030
I think I made this point in
the lecture.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.008
If you read twentieth century
literature, particularly first

00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:37.240
half, you find this feeling
expressed by a lot of novelists.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.087
You read Franz
Kafka--right?--you read Albert

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:42.970
Camus.
 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.012
That's where you get that same
feeling expressed,

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:50.044
to what Marx,
Nietzsche and Freud are

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:51.560
responding to.
 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.342
But there are big differences.
 

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:53.758
Right?
 

00:03:53.758 --> 00:04:00.048
Marx tries to move away from
Hegel and wants to come down to

00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:06.016
earth and offer a theory of
alienation which is rooted in

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:10.310
the economy,
into the production process.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.931
And Marx has a view what
emancipated society will be,

00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:19.732
and he even has a historic
agent who will get us there,

00:04:19.732 --> 00:04:22.949
to emancipation;
the proletariat.

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.113
Now Nietzsche is very
different.

00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:26.930
Right?
 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.821
The genealogical method does
not really offer you the right

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:32.579
solution.
 

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:33.339
Right?
 

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:40.271
The genealogical method only
shows you what is unique in

00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:42.887
modernity,
in modern morality,

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:44.639
in the Judeo-Christian
morality,

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.589
what you think is so attractive
and so noble.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:51.355
And he
shows--right?--how--right?--in

00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:57.526
the workshop where ideas are
produced, it's actually torture

00:04:57.526 --> 00:05:00.559
and oppression what operates.
 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:01.709
Right?
 

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:06.958
So there is no good society,
and no agent who will get you

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:07.511
there.
 

00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:08.339
Right?
 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.019
You have to do it by yourself.
 

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:16.454
Now Freud also sees
civilization as coming from

00:05:16.454 --> 00:05:20.000
repression of sexual drives.
 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.658
So he is in a critique of
civilization.

00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:24.430
Right?
 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.610
But at the same time Freud has
this dual attitude about

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.098
civilization.
 

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.129
Right?
 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.060
Civilization is coming from
repression,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.581
but it is still sublimation,
and the most beautiful things

00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:44.627
in human society--
art and science--are coming

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:45.870
from this sublimation.
 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.663
And he is also reflecting--he's
writing in 1930,

00:05:49.663 --> 00:05:54.264
through the rise of Nazism--an
anti--right?--civilization,

00:05:54.264 --> 00:05:57.170
and he does not want to support
that.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.139
Right?
 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.555
So in a way,
you know, one can say that he

00:06:01.555 --> 00:06:06.720
does have- he does not offer you
the vision of good society.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.600
To some extent he is with
Nietzsche.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.560
He said, "You have to
emancipate yourself.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.391
You have to figure out for
yourself what your problem

00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:14.990
is."
 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.160
And he certainly does not have
a historic agent like Marx has.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.199
Anyway, this is the way how I
would be dealing with this.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.519
And I will not tell you what my
opinion is;

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.490
I want to hear your opinion
about it.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.250
Okay, the second question.
 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.490
That's not easy either.
 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.543
Practical theory of truth,
and Nietzsche's genealogical

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:39.220
method.
 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.146
Well there is,
again, a common element between

00:06:43.146 --> 00:06:44.980
Marx and Nietzsche.
 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.041
Neither of them believes in
objective abstract truth.

00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:50.819
Right?
 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.480
Marx says there is no objective
abstract truth.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.069
Truth is a practical question.
 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:04.403
Truth is being achieved by
human practices.

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:05.420
Right?
 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.932
And Nietzsche,
of course, does not believe in

00:07:08.932 --> 00:07:10.211
objective truth.
 

00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:10.930
Right?
 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.519
He's trying to find truth.
 

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:18.589
But truth is being accomplished
by comparing,

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:22.019
you know, different notions of
morality,

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.540
and to show that in comparison
with each other,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.283
both have its upsides and
downsides.

00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:28.910
Right?
 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.584
So there is--by the way
Nietzsche, don't misunderstand

00:07:35.584 --> 00:07:36.339
him.
 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:38.889
He is not a nihilist.
 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:42.110
He does not say everything goes.
 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.410
Nihilism is a very negative
term for Nietzsche.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.949
So he does not want to say
there is no truth at all.

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:53.721
He said truth is just relative,
and you can arrive at a

00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:57.704
critical understanding of your
situation by comparing your

00:07:57.704 --> 00:07:59.870
situation with another one.
 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.384
There is, of course,
a very fundamental difference

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:07.610
again between Marx and
Nietzsche.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.778
Because what is this practical
truth?

00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:14.226
These are human activities,
and Marx basically arrives at

00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:18.752
these human activities through
changing the physical work,

00:08:18.752 --> 00:08:21.689
through the system of
production.

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:26.459
And again, he has the agent who
is--this is the revolutionary

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:30.754
practices of the proletariat,
which will get you to the

00:08:30.754 --> 00:08:31.550
truth.
 

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.350
There is nothing like that in
Nietzsche.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.720
Right?
 

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.996
Nietzsche does not have a
historical agent,

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:44.107
and does not have the society
where after all you will get to

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.840
true society.
 

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.080
Well this is actually a very
simple question.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.408
Many of you did not like it.
 

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:57.250
So I'm thinking very hard
whether to put it on.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.080
It's a bit narrow,
but very simple.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.120
German Ideology and the
Grudrisse.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.190
Very simple.
 

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.360
There are two unique features
in the German Ideology.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:14.379
One is when he--he does develop
the notion of mode of production

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:18.678
for the first time in this book,
'45--1845.

00:09:18.678 --> 00:09:25.302
But he does identify the nature
of mode of production primarily

00:09:25.302 --> 00:09:27.759
by division of labor.
 

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:30.778
And this doesn't serve him very
well,

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:33.833
because the division of labor
does not capture the

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:36.639
conflictuous relationship
between classes,

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:40.100
which eventually will have to
lead to revolution.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.779
So he abandons it--does not
finish the book.

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:49.434
Because only at the very end of
the book does he realize that

00:09:49.434 --> 00:09:54.431
the two components of mode of
production are forces of

00:09:54.431 --> 00:09:57.508
production,
technology, and relations of

00:09:57.508 --> 00:09:58.178
production.
 

00:09:58.178 --> 00:10:02.296
And relations of production,
for most of the German

00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:05.168
Ideology,
is division of labor.

00:10:05.168 --> 00:10:08.157
And then he realizes,
no, no, no, it is not division

00:10:08.157 --> 00:10:10.610
of labor,
but property relations:

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.253
the relationship between those
who have property and those who

00:10:15.253 --> 00:10:17.080
do not have property.
 

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.801
And he also has a very
deterministic view of history in

00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:22.798
the German Ideology.
 

00:10:22.798 --> 00:10:26.672
All societies have to go
through the same modes of

00:10:26.672 --> 00:10:30.386
production: tribalism,
slave mode of production,

00:10:30.386 --> 00:10:32.678
feudalism and capitalism.
 

00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:36.389
In the Grundrisse,
there are two big innovations.

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:40.460
Now the center is property
relations;

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.655
the peak of history of
capitalism, when the producer is

00:10:45.655 --> 00:10:50.658
separated from the means of
production completely.

00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:56.812
And he breaks from the
deterministic view of history.

00:10:56.812 --> 00:10:57.759
Right?
 

00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:01.940
Now he has this multi-linear
development of history.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.990
Not every society has to come
through slavery and feudalism.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.600
The Asiatic societies,
in a quasi-communal society,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.919
can move directly into
capitalism.

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:16.629
Okay.
 

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:18.928
So that's basically a very
simple question.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:22.827
I probably did a very bad job
in the lecture,

00:11:22.827 --> 00:11:25.750
that this did not become clear.
 

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:32.427
So four, Marx as a historical
materialist, and compare him

00:11:32.427 --> 00:11:33.950
with Freud.
 

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:39.779
Well actually I am inspired
here by Jürgen Habermas.

00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:44.344
And Jürgen Habermas says,
"Well, Marx in the 'Thesis

00:11:44.344 --> 00:11:48.269
on Feuerbach' got it right when
he said that the real point of

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:51.230
departure is sensuous human
activity."

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.568
At that time,
when Habermas was writing this,

00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:56.769
he was still a materialist.
 

00:11:56.769 --> 00:12:00.072
Then he had his culture turn,
and he's probably not a

00:12:00.072 --> 00:12:01.658
materialist any longer.
 

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:04.923
He said, "Materialism is
if your point of departure is

00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:08.188
what you can get from through
your senses, not through your

00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:09.090
ideas."
 

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.629
But he said Marx made a mistake;
namely, that he reduced

00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:19.490
sensuous human activities to the
economy, and to production.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.929
And well, he said,
Freud is more interesting,

00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:27.700
because he has a different kind
of sensuous human activity.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.758
And this is sensuous human
activities between

00:12:30.758 --> 00:12:33.470
people--right?--sexual
relationships.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.389
In fact, Habermas makes it more
complicated;

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:39.370
I don't want to get into
Habermas.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.154
But his interpretation of Freud
is that Freud also starts from

00:12:43.154 --> 00:12:46.133
sensuous human activity,
to understand what is in

00:12:46.133 --> 00:12:47.250
people's mind.
 

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.548
But it is not economic
reductionism;

00:12:50.548 --> 00:12:54.158
if anything,
it is sexual reductionism.

00:12:54.158 --> 00:12:54.918
Right?
 

00:12:54.918 --> 00:12:58.740
It is a pan-erotic explanation
of history.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.388
But, in some ways,
you know, they all starts for

00:13:02.388 --> 00:13:06.580
sensuous human activities,
in explaining what can be in

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.528
people's minds--what is our
ideas.

00:13:09.528 --> 00:13:12.881
So the starting point is
material sensuous

00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:16.562
experience--right?--and the
product are ideas.

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:17.379
Right?
 

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:20.351
This is, in this sense,
they are both materialists,

00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:21.778
but in different ways.
 

00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:26.571
Is that--I suppose it should be
pretty clear now.

00:13:26.571 --> 00:13:27.370
Right?
 

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.558
Okay, Classes.
 

00:13:30.558 --> 00:13:33.381
Well you can have different
views on this,

00:13:33.381 --> 00:13:37.236
and especially whether Marx's
theory of classes are still

00:13:37.236 --> 00:13:38.269
applicable.
 

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:41.261
You know, Marx defined classes
in terms of property

00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:42.158
relationship.
 

00:13:42.158 --> 00:13:45.557
He had two classes in The
Communist Manifesto,

00:13:45.557 --> 00:13:48.038
the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat.

00:13:48.038 --> 00:13:50.679
The question is does it still
matter?

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:52.178
And you have to reflect on this.
 

00:13:52.178 --> 00:13:56.618
Do you think property relations
still is a major antagonistic

00:13:56.618 --> 00:14:00.168
divide in American society,
or not any longer?

00:14:00.168 --> 00:14:02.187
And, of course,
Marx believed in The

00:14:02.187 --> 00:14:04.524
Communist Manifesto,
yes there is still a

00:14:04.524 --> 00:14:06.808
middle-class,
but it will be done away;

00:14:06.808 --> 00:14:12.046
middle-class will be become
either bourgeois or become

00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:13.428
proletarian.
 

00:14:13.428 --> 00:14:15.726
And, of course,
in the United States,

00:14:15.726 --> 00:14:19.169
the received wisdom is that we
are all middle-class.

00:14:19.169 --> 00:14:20.558
Are we all middle-class?
 

00:14:20.558 --> 00:14:23.880
I would like to hear your view
about this.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.529
Right?
 

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:25.909
But that's the big question.
 

00:14:25.909 --> 00:14:29.375
Clearly Marx did get it wrong;
that's undoubtedly,

00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:30.820
I think everybody agrees.
 

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.923
I think Karl Marx,
if he would be alive,

00:14:32.923 --> 00:14:35.029
he would say,
"Ah, I screwed it.

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:37.200
I made a mistake.
 

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.307
Of course there is a big
middle-class."

00:14:39.307 --> 00:14:39.700
Right?
 

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.807
So, I mean, you don't have to
really hate Marx,

00:14:43.807 --> 00:14:47.470
you know, that there is a
middle-class.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.211
He clearly made a mistake.
 

00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:49.678
Right?
 

00:14:49.678 --> 00:14:52.817
Anyway, but you can ask the
question, who is the

00:14:52.817 --> 00:14:53.820
middle-class?
 

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.178
Are we indeed all middle-class?
 

00:14:56.178 --> 00:14:59.668
Is this sensible to talk about
the big bourgeoisie?

00:14:59.668 --> 00:15:01.879
Well there are no big
bourgeoisie any longer.

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:04.418
This is people's capitalism we
live in.

00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:06.970
And these are the questions I
would like you to deal with.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.100
Okay, labor theory of value,
and Adam Smith.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.255
I thought this is a very easy
question.

00:15:13.255 --> 00:15:13.710
Right?
 

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:19.254
Adam Smith said that,
you know, all value is created

00:15:19.254 --> 00:15:20.450
by labor.
 

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:25.489
But then he said when it comes
to distributing wealth or

00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:30.070
income, it has to go to labor,
capital and land.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.159
Marx, on the other hand,
said, "Well,

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:35.120
this is a contradiction.
 

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.649
If all labor goes to- if all
value is created by labor,

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:40.220
it should go to labor.
 

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.586
And therefore if it is taken
away from labor,

00:15:42.586 --> 00:15:45.168
it should be understood as
exploitation."

00:15:45.168 --> 00:15:49.038
Is this an advance or is this a
misunderstanding?

00:15:49.038 --> 00:15:51.683
And you can say,
"Well this is a

00:15:51.683 --> 00:15:55.210
misunderstanding because Adam
Smith was right.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.750
He said all labor is--all value
is created by labor,

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.129
in societies where capital is
not accumulated and the land is

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:07.176
not privately owned,
and therefore this is a

00:16:07.176 --> 00:16:08.778
consistent argument."
 

00:16:08.778 --> 00:16:11.628
Or you can say,
"Well Marx actually got a

00:16:11.628 --> 00:16:14.413
very important point,
because there is indeed

00:16:14.413 --> 00:16:16.851
exploitation;
there are exploitive

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.961
relationships,
and it does drive

00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:20.120
history."
 

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.278
I mean, how you take your
position, this is up to you.

00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:27.412
You have to argue
consistently--right?--and the

00:16:27.412 --> 00:16:30.340
argument of consistency will be
rewarded.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.259
Seven: Well this is--again,
a lot of people said don't do

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:37.690
it because we have not talked
about domination.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.297
I'll probably leave it,
because I will talk in the

00:16:42.297 --> 00:16:46.897
next--
how much have I got?--forty

00:16:46.897 --> 00:16:51.744
minutes about this--
domination and mode of

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:54.779
production, and what domination
is.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:59.168
Well Protestant ethic;
was he as an idealist?

00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:01.450
Some people think this is a too
narrow question.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.602
Well I think you kind of can
ask the question,

00:17:05.602 --> 00:17:08.740
is this really an idealist
view?

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.606
Some people said,
what Weber is saying,

00:17:11.606 --> 00:17:15.230
that it is Calvinism which
created capitalism.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.630
Is this his view?
 

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.880
What is exactly his view?
 

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:24.088
He is very critical of Marx.
 

00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:29.145
He believes that Marx has a
simplistic materialist

00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:33.480
explanation: it is consciousness
which--

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.308
it is existence which
determines consciousness,

00:17:36.308 --> 00:17:38.319
rather than the other way
around.

00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:41.078
Is Weber saying the opposite?
 

00:17:41.078 --> 00:17:44.336
It is consciousness which
determines existence or

00:17:44.336 --> 00:17:45.220
capitalism.
 

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.380
And that's what The
Protestant Ethic is trying

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.019
to do.
 

00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:52.888
And, of course,
he has this interesting notion

00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:56.184
of elective affinity--
questions whether there is

00:17:56.184 --> 00:18:00.259
really a causal relationship
between ideas and the economy.

00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:03.598
And you can labor on this,
what he might mean.

00:18:03.598 --> 00:18:08.013
And what you think--this is a
cop-out--right?--that he

00:18:08.013 --> 00:18:12.678
actually--is Marx more of a
contemporary social theorist,

00:18:12.678 --> 00:18:16.009
because he has a causal
explanation?

00:18:16.009 --> 00:18:18.640
He tries to give a causal
explanation.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.798
And that's what you are told in
political science or economics.

00:18:21.798 --> 00:18:24.592
"Real social science comes
up with causal

00:18:24.592 --> 00:18:25.770
explanations."
 

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:26.328
Right?
 

00:18:26.328 --> 00:18:30.038
And Weber shies away,
and Marx tries to do causal

00:18:30.038 --> 00:18:30.890
analysis.
 

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.279
Okay.
 

00:18:35.279 --> 00:18:39.538
Did I miss nine?
 

00:18:39.538 --> 00:18:44.682
Well this is very much a--very
similar to the previous

00:18:44.682 --> 00:18:45.750
question.
 

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.907
Here only I ask you to compare
the two: Is Marx really a

00:18:49.907 --> 00:18:53.838
simple-minded economic
deterministic--determinist?

00:18:53.838 --> 00:18:59.190
It is existence which
determines consciousness.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.868
Or does he have a more
complicated view?

00:19:01.868 --> 00:19:04.710
Is there a contradiction in
Marx?

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.420
Right?
 

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.759
The philosophy of praxis,
that we are making history.

00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:10.779
He also makes that claim.
 

00:19:10.779 --> 00:19:11.940
How does it fit?
 

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.568
Does he simply contradict
himself, or is this a consistent

00:19:15.568 --> 00:19:16.269
ideology?
 

00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:18.913
And, you know,
Weber, is he an idealist,

00:19:18.913 --> 00:19:21.220
or he is not really an
idealist?

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.440
What does he mean by this
elective affinity?

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.071
And then finally,
with the final question,

00:19:27.071 --> 00:19:29.640
I think people seem to be
liking this.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.230
Not easy, by the way.
 

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:36.521
Marx clearly has a notion of
human nature.

00:19:36.521 --> 00:19:37.358
Right?
 

00:19:37.358 --> 00:19:40.904
Marx believes--is a
Rousseauian--an even more

00:19:40.904 --> 00:19:44.691
radical than Rousseauian theory
of human nature,

00:19:44.691 --> 00:19:47.752
especially in his theory of
alienation.

00:19:47.752 --> 00:19:48.720
Right?
 

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.015
We are good,
and the problem comes as

00:19:52.015 --> 00:19:54.670
society makes us alienated.
 

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:59.630
But I think he goes a little
beyond Rousseau.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.690
Because he thinks that in the
state of nature we are actually

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.939
social;
being social is in our nature.

00:20:05.939 --> 00:20:06.589
Right?
 

00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:10.269
Rousseau did not think so.
 

00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:16.318
The noble savage has to be
socialized into civil society.

00:20:16.318 --> 00:20:20.661
Marx believes that this whole
idea of state of nature is an

00:20:20.661 --> 00:20:21.710
abstraction.
 

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.318
We are all born in society,
and by nature we are social.

00:20:25.318 --> 00:20:28.276
Only capitalism,
which makes us

00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:32.808
competitive--competitive
bourgeois individuals,

00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:36.160
makes us asocial and egoistic.
 

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.058
Well does Weber has a theory of
human nature?

00:20:40.058 --> 00:20:42.868
It's a more difficult question
to pose.

00:20:42.868 --> 00:20:47.883
I think, if I would argue,
I would say if Weber does have

00:20:47.883 --> 00:20:50.267
one,
it is closer to Hobbes,

00:20:50.267 --> 00:20:53.170
because he does believe that
people--

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:59.140
the history of humankind is a
struggle for power;

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.193
yes, an ending struggle for
power, and that's why he

00:21:02.193 --> 00:21:05.009
explained human history with
power struggles.

00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:07.574
That's about it;
that's the way how I would,

00:21:07.574 --> 00:21:09.200
in a nutshell,
try to deal with this.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.740
And I hope this was somewhat
helpful, and makes you

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:21.170
relaxed--right?--that this will
not be a difficult test.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:26.317
It will be actually a lot of
fun, to deal with these

00:21:26.317 --> 00:21:29.650
intriguing, interesting issues.
 

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.038
Okay?
 

00:21:31.038 --> 00:21:36.140
And believe me,
I really want you to have fun.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.548
I think these are interesting
questions.

00:21:41.548 --> 00:21:47.318
Okay, now we come to Weber's
theory of domination.

00:21:47.318 --> 00:21:52.240
And that's almost impossible,
what I am trying to do now.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.390
But will try to rush you
through.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:59.885
And first of all we have to
understand Weber's theory of

00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:04.582
action which has some
similarities to Hobbes and

00:22:04.582 --> 00:22:08.880
Hobbes' theory of voluntaristic
action.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.396
But then we also have to deal
with Weber's notion of

00:22:13.396 --> 00:22:18.181
rationality, and then his
distinction between power and

00:22:18.181 --> 00:22:22.160
domination;
his theory of legitimacy.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.930
This is very, very important.
 

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:28.071
It's one of the most
fundamental concepts,

00:22:28.071 --> 00:22:33.528
particularly in political
theory, but also in economics

00:22:33.528 --> 00:22:35.650
and in sociology.
 

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.338
And finally his types of
authority;

00:22:39.338 --> 00:22:42.548
we will deal at great lengths
with different types of

00:22:42.548 --> 00:22:43.288
authority.
 

00:22:43.288 --> 00:22:48.050
I'll just give you a sense what
this is in the next twenty-five

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:48.818
minutes.
 

00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:52.430
Okay, the four types of
economic action.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.900
He makes a distinction.
 

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.421
The question is,
how can--how are we orienting

00:22:57.421 --> 00:22:58.828
with each other?
 

00:22:58.828 --> 00:23:03.230
What motivates us when we are
interacting with other people?

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.752
He said well we can act
instrumentally,

00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:09.538
rationally, and I will explain
it to you what he means.

00:23:09.538 --> 00:23:13.858
And then he said we can also
act value rationally;

00:23:13.858 --> 00:23:17.618
and again we'll come--explain
what this means.

00:23:17.618 --> 00:23:24.720
In our interaction we can be
led our emotions.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.130
And he said this is--well,
whether this is rational;

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.730
he said this is not irrational
thing.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.904
It is not necessarily
irrational that we act out of

00:23:35.904 --> 00:23:39.066
our emotions,
and I will tell you when he

00:23:39.066 --> 00:23:41.569
thinks this is becoming
irrational,

00:23:41.569 --> 00:23:43.640
acting out of emotion.
 

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.910
Or, in our interactions we can
be led by tradition.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:52.090
Now to understand this,
that we actually interact with

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.009
each other in very different
ways--

00:23:55.009 --> 00:24:00.323
over time, with the same
person, we can act occasionally

00:24:00.323 --> 00:24:05.442
instrumentally or occasionally
we can act affectually.

00:24:05.442 --> 00:24:06.410
Right?
 

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.525
Occasionally we act towards
somebody because we have a great

00:24:11.525 --> 00:24:15.180
deal of emotion or feeling;
love or hate.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.135
And occasionally we can act
instrumentally.

00:24:18.135 --> 00:24:18.700
Right?
 

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.088
We use somebody in order to
achieve somebody.

00:24:21.088 --> 00:24:23.929
Can I borrow twenty dollars
from you?

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:24.559
Right?
 

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.528
Then we act instrumentally.
 

00:24:26.528 --> 00:24:31.167
But we also can act out of hate
or love.

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:32.118
Right?
 

00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:36.308
In a discussion section I
really hate the guts of somebody

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:39.833
who is always speaking--
right?--in the discussion

00:24:39.833 --> 00:24:42.608
section, and then I just will
contradict,

00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:46.808
because I just--it is my
antagonism.

00:24:46.808 --> 00:24:51.247
Or I just sympathize with
somebody, and therefore I also

00:24:51.247 --> 00:24:54.588
tend to disagree;
basically driven by my emotion.

00:24:54.588 --> 00:24:59.380
And now I'm not talking about
love, which binds people more.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:05.990
Now what is behind this is
Weber's fundamental methodology.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:12.084
He calls his approach to
society 'interpretative

00:25:12.084 --> 00:25:13.769
sociology.'
 

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:18.146
The term interpretative
sociology is translated from

00:25:18.146 --> 00:25:18.920
German.
 

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.240
The German term is
Verstehen;

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.660
Verstehen means
understanding.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.852
Occasionally we also translate
it into English,

00:25:27.852 --> 00:25:30.420
that what Weber does is
understand.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:38.759
But Weber's strong commitment
is that social analysts--

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:43.430
be it an economist,
be a political scientist,

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.327
be a sociologist,
be a historian,

00:25:46.327 --> 00:25:50.692
be an anthropologist--
is not to pass value judgments

00:25:50.692 --> 00:25:53.756
on others,
but to try to understand what

00:25:53.756 --> 00:25:55.338
drives other people.
 

00:25:55.338 --> 00:25:59.047
Don't assume that other people,
because they act differently

00:25:59.047 --> 00:26:02.692
than you, would act in their
situation, that they are dumb,

00:26:02.692 --> 00:26:03.948
evil, or irrational.
 

00:26:03.948 --> 00:26:04.640
Right?
 

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.990
This is particularly a debate
with economists.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.395
Economists tend to
have--right?--a very strong

00:26:12.395 --> 00:26:17.088
conception that there is one
economically rational behavior.

00:26:17.088 --> 00:26:20.566
Weber said, 'No;
I mean, there are various types

00:26:20.566 --> 00:26:24.115
of ways how we can act,
and my job is not to say,

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:26.410
'Now you're very rational'.
 

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.521
My job is to try to put myself
into your position,

00:26:30.521 --> 00:26:35.643
and to understand why you did,
and why you did the way how you

00:26:35.643 --> 00:26:37.068
did it."
 

00:26:37.068 --> 00:26:39.615
This is interpretive sociology.
 

00:26:39.615 --> 00:26:40.190
Right?
 

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.505
This is understanding,
Verstehen.

00:26:42.505 --> 00:26:42.980
Right?
 

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.798
That I emotionally try to put
myself into your situation,

00:26:47.798 --> 00:26:50.136
and rather than saying,
"This is what I would

00:26:50.136 --> 00:26:52.892
do",
I decide if I were you,

00:26:52.892 --> 00:26:57.130
in your situation,
would I do the same thing?

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.500
Why do you do that the way how
you do do?

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.904
Assuming that you are not
acting irrationally,

00:27:02.904 --> 00:27:06.839
but try to understand why you
act the way you act.

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:07.970
Okay?
 

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.759
Now let's talk about
instrumentally rational action.

00:27:11.759 --> 00:27:15.641
This comes to the closest what
most economists,

00:27:15.641 --> 00:27:20.112
especially neoclassical
economists, regard as rational

00:27:20.112 --> 00:27:21.798
economic action.
 

00:27:21.798 --> 00:27:26.078
He said, "Instrumentally
rational action"--

00:27:26.078 --> 00:27:27.960
he calls it Zweckrational
ität--

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:35.598
is when the ends and the
means are all rationally taken

00:27:35.598 --> 00:27:39.023
into account and weighted.
 

00:27:39.023 --> 00:27:40.210
Right?
 

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.203
This is kind of utility
maximization.

00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:43.868
Right?
 

00:27:43.868 --> 00:27:48.598
When you--utilitarians define
this as the rational way to act.

00:27:48.598 --> 00:27:49.220
Right?
 

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.862
That you have--you are striving
for happiness,

00:27:52.862 --> 00:27:57.476
and you try to achieve this
happiness, and in this process

00:27:57.476 --> 00:27:59.500
you maximize utility.
 

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.911
You try to reduce the expenses,
and you try to increase the

00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:08.269
return on what you try to
achieve.

00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:13.317
But let me also emphasize that
Weber's notion of instrumental

00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:17.778
rationality does not say that
the ends are irrational.

00:28:17.778 --> 00:28:18.618
Right?
 

00:28:18.618 --> 00:28:22.890
Weber, very much like John
Stuart Mill,

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.700
is quite aware that we actually
do have preferences,

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.750
and there are some ends what we
find more valuable than other

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.338
ends.
 

00:28:32.338 --> 00:28:37.031
Instrumental rationality only
means if in order to achieve

00:28:37.031 --> 00:28:42.134
this end is too costly for us,
then we probably will go for

00:28:42.134 --> 00:28:45.471
our second preference,
rather than our first

00:28:45.471 --> 00:28:46.146
preference.
 

00:28:46.146 --> 00:28:46.640
Right?
 

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.150
So well I would like to date
somebody;

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:56.430
I very much would like to date
that person.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.465
But in order to have a
successful date,

00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:04.500
I have to take this person into
a four, five-star restaurant.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:09.660
Well the dinner will cost me
$200.00.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.640
Well there is another person
whom I would not mind to date--

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.738
you know, my second
preference--and that would go

00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:20.940
with a full-star restaurant,
and would cost me only 50 bucks.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.464
And therefore,
you know, I will weigh it,

00:29:23.464 --> 00:29:24.160
you know?
 

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.142
Is my preference for the first
date is so strong that it is

00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:31.720
worth for me to pay $200.00?
 

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.930
Or it's actually not that much
stronger;

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.941
my second preference is
actually pretty good,

00:29:37.941 --> 00:29:41.500
and therefore I actually go for
the $50.00 dinner.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.048
You see what I'm getting at?
 

00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:46.780
So you are weighting
rationally, both the ends and

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.980
the means, and you come to a
conclusion.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.789
Again, you know,
not all that far away from

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:55.412
Hobbes--
right?--and Hobbes'

00:29:55.412 --> 00:30:00.061
idea--right?--that we are--
you know, we do have these

00:30:00.061 --> 00:30:03.952
drives, we have these appetites,
and we have these fears,

00:30:03.952 --> 00:30:05.920
and then we arrive at a will.
 

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.690
This is instrumental
rationality.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.029
But he said people can act
value rationally,

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:15.458
and if somebody acts value
rationally, I am not willing to

00:30:15.458 --> 00:30:18.800
call them irrational;
value rationality,

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.720
if somebody says,
"This value is so

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.518
important for me that I don't
care what is the price I will

00:30:25.518 --> 00:30:27.154
have to pay for it."
 

00:30:27.154 --> 00:30:27.808
Right?
 

00:30:27.808 --> 00:30:32.386
Well let me give you a very
simple example.

00:30:32.386 --> 00:30:33.259
Right?
 

00:30:33.259 --> 00:30:37.760
You actually may think that
human life is particularly

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.525
valuable.
 

00:30:38.525 --> 00:30:39.288
Right?
 

00:30:39.288 --> 00:30:43.928
Now you or your partner may be
expecting a child,

00:30:43.928 --> 00:30:48.180
and then you will have to make
a decision.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.601
Will you give birth to this
child or will you have an

00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:51.019
abortion?
 

00:30:51.019 --> 00:30:51.440
Right?
 

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.881
And then it can come back to
value rationality.

00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:55.480
Right?
 

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.094
People can say that the life of
an unborn child is so superior

00:31:00.094 --> 00:31:04.557
for me that though I know it is
a very crazy stuff for me to

00:31:04.557 --> 00:31:06.685
have a child,
or my partner,

00:31:06.685 --> 00:31:09.818
to have a child right now,
I will do it;

00:31:09.818 --> 00:31:12.890
you know, because I am acting
value rationally.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.648
I know it is instrumentally
irrational.

00:31:15.648 --> 00:31:16.230
Right?
 

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.160
I may have to quit school,
you know,

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.894
in order to earn an income or
to take care of the baby or

00:31:21.894 --> 00:31:24.537
something,
and I'm actually screwing my

00:31:24.537 --> 00:31:28.161
life, but I don't mind--
right?--because I have such a

00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:29.740
strong value commitment.
 

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.240
You see what I'm getting at?
 

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.442
And you cannot say this is
irrational behavior.

00:31:34.442 --> 00:31:35.000
Right?
 

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.577
This is rational behavior
because people has a commitment

00:31:38.577 --> 00:31:41.683
to an ultimate value,
and this ultimate value

00:31:41.683 --> 00:31:45.859
occasionally is so high that you
are sacrificing your economic

00:31:45.859 --> 00:31:48.315
interests;
and occasionally you sacrifice

00:31:48.315 --> 00:31:48.890
your life.
 

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:55.611
You are wiling to die for noble
causes--right?--and you do

00:31:55.611 --> 00:31:58.558
it--right?--rationally.
 

00:31:58.558 --> 00:32:01.868
You weigh it,
but you know that you will die.

00:32:01.868 --> 00:32:05.265
And if you know that you will
die for this noble cause,

00:32:05.265 --> 00:32:08.410
one cannot say that you are
acting irrationally.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:12.348
Affectual orientation.
 

00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:16.170
Affectual orientation,
that you are led by emotions.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:20.028
He said it can be on the
borderline, because if it is

00:32:20.028 --> 00:32:23.441
simply an uncontrolled reaction
to a situation,

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.073
then it is irrational.
 

00:32:25.073 --> 00:32:25.890
Right?
 

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.494
If you're simply acting out of
anger, then you were irrational.

00:32:30.494 --> 00:32:31.088
Right?
 

00:32:31.088 --> 00:32:35.295
When you are drunk in a party
and you are saying something to

00:32:35.295 --> 00:32:37.887
your partner,
and your relationship is

00:32:37.887 --> 00:32:40.817
breaking up;
you actually wanted this

00:32:40.817 --> 00:32:42.548
relationship to go on.
 

00:32:42.548 --> 00:32:45.747
Next morning you wake up and
said, "My goodness

00:32:45.747 --> 00:32:48.380
gracious, what have I
done?" Right?

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.519
"I was dumb,
I was irrational.

00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:53.630
I was led by emotions.
 

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.769
I said things what I should not
have said."

00:32:55.769 --> 00:32:58.700
In this case emotion was
irrational.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.690
It was an uncontrolled reaction
to a stimulation.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.298
But otherwise,
to act out of love and to make

00:33:07.298 --> 00:33:10.250
sacrifices for love is very
rational.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.069
Right?
 

00:33:11.069 --> 00:33:13.039
We do this all the time. Right?
 

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:15.250
Your parents do it.
 

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:19.881
You know, they send you to Yale
and they pay $200,000.00 to get

00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:23.575
you a Yale degree--
right?--very well aware that

00:33:23.575 --> 00:33:27.827
probably they will never get
anything like that back from

00:33:27.827 --> 00:33:28.130
you.
 

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.890
Right?
 

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.828
They hope they will get some
love back from you.

00:33:31.828 --> 00:33:34.083
Well they might or they might
not.

00:33:34.083 --> 00:33:34.630
Right?
 

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.608
But, you know,
they act out of love.

00:33:36.608 --> 00:33:38.327
And, you know,
some people may say,

00:33:38.327 --> 00:33:39.440
"You are crazy.
 

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.368
Why you invest so much to your
children?

00:33:42.368 --> 00:33:45.618
They will put you in a home of
elderly"--r

00:33:45.618 --> 00:33:47.880
ight?--"when you get old.
 

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.150
Nobody will take care of
you." Right?

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.938
Well they--but the answer is,
"But I love my child and I

00:33:53.938 --> 00:33:56.588
want the best for my
child." Right?

00:33:56.588 --> 00:34:01.710
This is a very not irrational
behavior: well justified.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:06.174
Anyway, these are traditional
orientation, where you act out

00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:07.157
of tradition.
 

00:34:07.157 --> 00:34:07.838
Right?
 

00:34:07.838 --> 00:34:13.496
Well some people actually still
believe in arranged marriages.

00:34:13.496 --> 00:34:14.239
Right?
 

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:18.324
Certainly if you are Islamic,
or even if you are an Orthodox

00:34:18.324 --> 00:34:22.755
Jew, you probably want to choose
your partner through an arranged

00:34:22.755 --> 00:34:23.378
marriage.
 

00:34:23.378 --> 00:34:24.139
Right?
 

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.286
You go to the rabbi and the
rabbi will arrange the marriage

00:34:27.286 --> 00:34:27.829
for you.
 

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:31.197
You have to be pretty orthodox,
but there are some Orthodox

00:34:31.197 --> 00:34:32.010
Jews who do.
 

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.670
Many Muslims who do that.
 

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.050
Is it irrational?
 

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.690
Not irrational.
 

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.757
Actually one can say romantic
love is not all that bloody

00:34:39.757 --> 00:34:40.360
rational.
 

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.570
You know?
 

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.315
The whole idea that you see
somebody, fall in love,

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:47.391
and next day you propose,
that seems to be a pretty silly

00:34:47.391 --> 00:34:48.268
thing to do.
 

00:34:48.268 --> 00:34:51.309
Is not it is much better to go
to the rabbi,

00:34:51.309 --> 00:34:53.996
who knows you,
who knows your potential

00:34:53.996 --> 00:34:57.320
partner, and arranges the
marriage for you?

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.059
Anyway, the point
is--right?--tradition can guide

00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:02.150
your action.
 

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.380
And that's again not irrational.
 

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.420
It is only irrational if it is
completely unthinking.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.349
I think that's very important
to say.

00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:15.210
If it is self-conscious,
you know what you do.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:18.429
I do it because I am a Jew.
 

00:35:18.429 --> 00:35:23.844
I am doing it because I am a
reborn Christian,

00:35:23.844 --> 00:35:28.175
and that's what reborn
Christians do.

00:35:28.175 --> 00:35:29.380
Right?
 

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.518
If you follow this way,
then you are acting rationally;

00:35:33.518 --> 00:35:37.650
or not acting irrationally,
to put it more.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.829
Now what is rationality?
 

00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:45.230
Well I think the key--it's a
very complex notion.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.820
For me--and you can have a
different interpretation;

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.900
now I will give you my
interpretation.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:57.918
I think what is important,
that rationality means that you

00:35:57.918 --> 00:36:05.550
substitute unthinking acceptance
of a situation and not thought

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.795
out,
spontaneous reactions,

00:36:08.795 --> 00:36:11.320
to deliberate adaptation.
 

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.483
So when you are conscious about
what you are doing,

00:36:14.483 --> 00:36:18.217
then you are actually acting
rationally, or at least you are

00:36:18.217 --> 00:36:19.989
not acting irrationally.
 

00:36:19.989 --> 00:36:23.360
He makes a distinction between
rational,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.199
which is giving a great deal of
thought,

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:32.101
and non-rational,
where actually there is still

00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:34.980
some reflection going on.
 

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.222
Schluchter, a major Weber
scholar who knows much more

00:36:38.222 --> 00:36:39.719
about Weber than I do.
 

00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:42.804
Though I have read this book
cover to cover a couple of

00:36:42.804 --> 00:36:45.396
times,
I haven't read all the sixty

00:36:45.396 --> 00:36:49.929
volumes of Weber cover to cover,
but have read quite a bit of it.

00:36:49.929 --> 00:36:53.570
Anyway, but Schluchter has read
everything more than once.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.260
This is his interpretation.
 

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.050
He said, "The question is
means and ends.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.494
Instrumental rationality is the
ultimate rationality,

00:37:01.494 --> 00:37:04.739
because you consider both means
and ends."

00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:08.219
And he said,
"Value rationality is a

00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:12.831
lower level of rationality
because you do not consider

00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:15.442
really means any longer."
 

00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:16.400
Right?
 

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.719
"Ends dominate.
 

00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:21.146
And traditionally the factual
rationality are more marginal

00:37:21.146 --> 00:37:22.860
types of rationality."
 

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:28.039
Well I would offer you an
alternative interpretation.

00:37:28.039 --> 00:37:31.960
This is my reconstruction of
Jürgen Habermas;

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.447
which said, "Well what
Weber is emphasizing is what is

00:37:36.447 --> 00:37:39.619
the level--right?--of your
reflexivity?

00:37:39.619 --> 00:37:42.210
Do you really think about what
you are doing?

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:46.771
And also to what extent you can
communicate to others what you

00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:47.670
are doing.
 

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.525
And if you do it this way,
you can have reflexivity which

00:37:51.525 --> 00:37:52.559
is very high.
 

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:56.007
So you think very hard why you
are doing, and you are aware

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:59.396
what the motivation of your
action is, and you can explain

00:37:59.396 --> 00:38:01.360
it to a great deal to others.
 

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.510
If this is so"--I think
this is really Habermas--

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.360
"then your rationality is
the highest level of

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.385
rationality."
 

00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:08.900
Right?
 

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.500
Because you can really explain
your values very well.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.550
Instrumental rationality.
 

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.739
There is not much to say.
 

00:38:16.739 --> 00:38:19.199
It's only I am making more
money this way.

00:38:19.199 --> 00:38:19.679
Right?
 

00:38:19.679 --> 00:38:23.353
Therefore the level of
communication is relatively low,

00:38:23.353 --> 00:38:26.550
though you know very well what
you are doing.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.422
Anyway, I'll just leave it for
you-- don't want to elaborate on

00:38:30.422 --> 00:38:31.360
this anymore.
 

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.260
But the bottom line is for
Weber rationality is really--

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.523
has something to do how
conscious you are of what you

00:38:38.523 --> 00:38:41.543
are doing,
and how conscious you are of

00:38:41.543 --> 00:38:44.139
the consequences of your action.
 

00:38:44.139 --> 00:38:49.295
You are irrational when you
don't know what the consequences

00:38:49.295 --> 00:38:51.130
of your action are.
 

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.349
Now power and domination.
 

00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:58.614
Weber makes a fundamental
difference between power--in

00:38:58.614 --> 00:39:02.489
German, Macht--and
domination.

00:39:02.489 --> 00:39:06.032
And this is a very important
citation.

00:39:06.032 --> 00:39:06.800
Right?
 

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.030
"Power is the probability
that an actor within a social

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:14.902
relationship will be in a
position to carry out his own

00:39:14.902 --> 00:39:17.340
will despite resistance."
 

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.347
You can resist,
and nevertheless the person who

00:39:20.347 --> 00:39:23.880
is in power can force you to do
what you want to do.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.626
He said, "Well,
this actually very rarely

00:39:26.626 --> 00:39:28.518
happens in social situations.
 

00:39:28.518 --> 00:39:33.615
What typically defines a social
situation is relations of

00:39:33.615 --> 00:39:34.800
domination.
 

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.309
That's what he calls
Herrschaft.

00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:45.693
Domination is the probability
that a command will be obeyed.

00:39:45.693 --> 00:39:46.829
Right?
 

00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:54.010
The difference--right?--between
power--domination--this is sort

00:39:54.010 --> 00:40:00.150
of my little equation
here--domination is nothing else

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.045
but power and legitimacy.
 

00:40:03.045 --> 00:40:04.320
Right?
 

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.510
The people who hold power try
to legitimate what they do.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.210
You know, I was trying to do
this in the first twenty

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:12.730
minutes.
 

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.715
"Look, you know,
you have these questions which

00:40:15.715 --> 00:40:16.769
sound difficult.
 

00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:17.869
They are not difficult.
 

00:40:17.869 --> 00:40:19.219
They are exciting."
 

00:40:19.219 --> 00:40:21.268
You know, there I tried to
legitimate myself.

00:40:21.268 --> 00:40:23.539
"This is sensible,
that you try to answer this

00:40:23.539 --> 00:40:24.039
question.
 

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:27.298
You will learn, you know;
you will understand society

00:40:27.298 --> 00:40:27.610
better.
 

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.826
You will understand yourself
better if you think about these

00:40:30.826 --> 00:40:31.699
questions."
 

00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:32.190
Right?
 

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.813
I was trying to legitimate the
process, rather than just acting

00:40:35.813 --> 00:40:36.690
out of power.
 

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.289
"If by 9:00 it will not be
here,

00:40:40.289 --> 00:40:42.320
you will get an
F"--right?--

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.768
"and then you will be in
big trouble--

00:40:44.768 --> 00:40:46.639
right?--you will not get your
degree."

00:40:46.639 --> 00:40:49.197
No, I did not want to
legitimate--I tried to

00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:52.230
legitimate what we will be doing
this afternoon--

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:56.333
right?--by the legitimacy,
saying this will be sensible

00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:57.550
for you to do.
 

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.639
You benefit from it. Right?
 

00:40:59.639 --> 00:41:02.661
I tried to
internalize--right?--what I want

00:41:02.661 --> 00:41:06.760
you to do, between 7:00 and
9:00, that you're beginning to

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.429
believe this is good for me that
I am doing it.

00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:11.889
It is fun. Right?
 

00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:13.079
I'm learning.
 

00:41:13.079 --> 00:41:14.719
I'm enriching myself.
 

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:16.887
This is my self-development.
 

00:41:16.887 --> 00:41:17.429
Right?
 

00:41:17.429 --> 00:41:21.548
So I was trying to
convert--right?--power into

00:41:21.548 --> 00:41:22.556
domination.
 

00:41:22.556 --> 00:41:23.380
Right?
 

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:28.144
And that is legitimacy;
a claim that what I'm doing

00:41:28.144 --> 00:41:32.255
when I'm asking you,
7:00, you know,

00:41:32.255 --> 00:41:38.376
not to have a cocktail,
but to sit down in front of

00:41:38.376 --> 00:41:41.039
your computer and to write a
test,

00:41:41.039 --> 00:41:43.289
is good for you. Right?
 

00:41:43.289 --> 00:41:46.279
And if you internalize it and
you're beginning to think how

00:41:46.279 --> 00:41:48.751
wonderful,
you know, that I can delay

00:41:48.751 --> 00:41:53.307
these cocktails for two hours--
right?--then I achieved,

00:41:53.307 --> 00:41:56.452
then I--you know,
then it was domination rather

00:41:56.452 --> 00:41:56.943
than power.
 

00:41:56.943 --> 00:41:57.300
Right?
 

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.969
Is that clear?
 

00:41:58.969 --> 00:42:02.510
Now what is legitimacy?
 

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.070
This is a very tricky question.
 

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:08.262
And well I have my own view;
many people will vehemently

00:42:08.262 --> 00:42:09.409
disagree with me.
 

00:42:09.409 --> 00:42:13.646
He said--and that's very
important--"Every genuine

00:42:13.646 --> 00:42:17.411
form of domination implies a
minimum of voluntary

00:42:17.411 --> 00:42:19.059
compliance."
 

00:42:19.059 --> 00:42:21.811
That is an interest in
obedience.

00:42:21.811 --> 00:42:22.500
Right?
 

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:27.322
Unless I could persuade you
that you will feel,

00:42:27.322 --> 00:42:33.193
well I actually could--you
know, I could drop this course

00:42:33.193 --> 00:42:36.340
and not to take this test.
 

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.710
This is too difficult;
I'll just drop the course.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.179
I can live without this course.
 

00:42:40.179 --> 00:42:44.855
You can have a kind of
voluntary compliance and,

00:42:44.855 --> 00:42:47.840
most important,
an interest.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.891
You're beginning to think,
well I will learn something by

00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:51.599
doing this.
 

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:55.579
If I achieve that,
then this is really domination.

00:42:55.579 --> 00:43:00.849
 
 

00:43:00.849 --> 00:43:06.617
Now this is also an extremely
important argument.

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:07.579
Right?
 

00:43:07.579 --> 00:43:13.804
That every privileged
groups--people in position of

00:43:13.804 --> 00:43:20.280
power--are developing a myth of
their superiority;

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:26.699
they are developing a myth that
this is useful for you to obey.

00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:29.559
So the essence--right?--of
legitimacy,

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:34.815
that it has a certain--expects
you to believe in the reasons

00:43:34.815 --> 00:43:40.340
what those in position of power
try to justify their power,

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.219
but also an understanding that
this is a myth.

00:43:44.219 --> 00:43:49.201
Because this is--right?--comes
very close to Nietzsche.

00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:49.940
Right?
 

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.304
Nietzsche is sticking his head
out here.

00:43:54.304 --> 00:43:55.199
Right?
 

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.820
It is a mythology.
 

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.929
It's not really true. Right?
 

00:43:58.929 --> 00:44:02.911
You just internalize your own
submission to the authority.

00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:03.469
Right?
 

00:44:03.469 --> 00:44:09.469
But the tendency in history is
that you will internalize it.

00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:13.469
So this is very different from
what we normally say legitimacy,

00:44:13.469 --> 00:44:16.643
because by legitimacy in
contemporary political

00:44:16.643 --> 00:44:19.655
discourse,
refers--well Karzai is not

00:44:19.655 --> 00:44:23.559
legitimate because he was faking
the elections.

00:44:23.559 --> 00:44:28.769
If elections are fair and free,
then the person who is elected

00:44:28.769 --> 00:44:30.820
is a legitimate ruler.
 

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:33.340
No, no, no, that's not Weber's
view.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:38.400
It's not universal suffrage and
free and fair elections,

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.530
what makes the ruler
legitimate.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:45.449
What makes the ruler
legitimate, that the ruler is

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:50.409
capable to develop mythologies,
to justify that you better obey

00:44:50.409 --> 00:44:53.369
the orders, what is given to
you;

00:44:53.369 --> 00:44:57.230
because you have some self
interest to do so,

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:01.213
and you have some level of
belief that it is actually not

00:45:01.213 --> 00:45:04.965
bad for you,
to do what the ruler wants you

00:45:04.965 --> 00:45:05.503
to do.
 

00:45:05.503 --> 00:45:06.219
Right?
 

00:45:06.219 --> 00:45:12.059
Now there are different types
of domination and authority.

00:45:12.059 --> 00:45:15.880
And this is where he
clashes--right?--with Marx.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:21.309
As we have seen--right?--Marx
developed his typology of

00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:24.730
societies from economic systems.
 

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:28.820
Economy drives history.
 

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:33.780
Weber is a Nietzschian;
Hobbesian or Nietzschian. Right?

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.869
What drives history is power,
struggle for power.

00:45:37.869 --> 00:45:40.880
And the nature of power,
how power is constructed,

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:46.389
and how our power is
sublimated--right?--

00:45:46.389 --> 00:45:51.389
into domination,
to put it in the Freudian way,

00:45:51.389 --> 00:45:56.293
that is how you should
understand how societies

00:45:56.293 --> 00:45:57.360
operate.
 

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.143
So it is not modes of
production what describes the

00:46:01.143 --> 00:46:04.927
evolution of history,
but types of domination which

00:46:04.927 --> 00:46:07.880
describes the evolution of
history.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:12.213
And there are really three
types of what he calls

00:46:12.213 --> 00:46:14.469
legitimate authorities.
 

00:46:14.469 --> 00:46:19.780
There are three ways how rulers
in history legitimated their

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:20.500
rules.
 

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.563
It can be legal
rational--easily you can say

00:46:24.563 --> 00:46:28.250
liberal--traditional and
charismatic.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:33.030
And we will spend time on this,
each one of them.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:37.858
I just very briefly want to
tell you what these different

00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:39.409
authorities are.
 

00:46:39.409 --> 00:46:45.237
Legal rational authority is a
system in which there is a

00:46:45.237 --> 00:46:49.690
belief in the legality of
enacted rules.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:55.052
And those who are actually
issuing the commands,

00:46:55.052 --> 00:46:59.960
they themselves are bound by
those rules;

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.768
by this is the rule of law.
 

00:47:02.768 --> 00:47:06.000
That's what he calls legal
rational authority.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.809
It is rule of law administered
in a bureaucratic manner.

00:47:10.809 --> 00:47:13.849
You do not have a personal
master.

00:47:13.849 --> 00:47:16.510
You do not obey a person.
 

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.706
You obey the rules of the game.
 

00:47:19.706 --> 00:47:20.429
Right?
 

00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:23.650
And these rules of the game are
prescribed.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:26.809
You know in advance before you
act.

00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:29.800
It is set, and you follow these
rules.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.139
That is legal rational
authority.

00:47:32.139 --> 00:47:36.090
This is not identical with
democracy.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.949
It can be democratic,
or it can be authoritarian.

00:47:39.949 --> 00:47:44.130
It can be actually a
constitutional monarchy.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:44.889
Right?
 

00:47:44.889 --> 00:47:49.563
A constitutional monarch passed
laws by a separate legislature

00:47:49.563 --> 00:47:53.090
which was or was not
democratically elected.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:55.929
But everybody knew who the
rules of the game

00:47:55.929 --> 00:47:59.956
are--right?--in a constitutional
monarchy, eighteenth century,

00:47:59.956 --> 00:48:02.400
early nineteenth century
England.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.108
No democratically elected
parliament.

00:48:05.108 --> 00:48:05.710
Right?
 

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.500
But the laws were there and the
monarch followed the laws.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.639
That was legal rational
authority.

00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:16.320
 
 

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.650
Then you have traditional
authority.

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.565
Traditional authority,
he said, rests on the

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:24.753
established belief on the
sanctity of immemorial

00:48:24.753 --> 00:48:28.458
traditions,
and the legitimacy of those

00:48:28.458 --> 00:48:32.050
exercising the authority under
them.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.851
In some ways,
you know, when you are obeying

00:48:35.851 --> 00:48:40.980
your father, you are acting
under traditional authority.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:45.677
The authority what your father
has is ascribed to your father

00:48:45.677 --> 00:48:46.695
by tradition.
 

00:48:46.695 --> 00:48:47.400
Right?
 

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.375
We know that this is something
what fathers do have a

00:48:51.375 --> 00:48:54.862
legitimate right to say--
right?--that in fact,

00:48:54.862 --> 00:48:58.793
you know, fathers do have a
legitimate right to say that by

00:48:58.793 --> 00:49:00.961
midnight you have to be at home.
 

00:49:00.961 --> 00:49:01.639
Right?
 

00:49:01.639 --> 00:49:05.000
You kind of are not very happy
about this;

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.016
you know, when you were sixteen
you started to revolt against

00:49:08.016 --> 00:49:08.369
this.
 

00:49:08.369 --> 00:49:10.965
But, you know,
you accepted this is normally

00:49:10.965 --> 00:49:12.958
what, you know,
fathers, you know,

00:49:12.958 --> 00:49:14.043
or mothers do say.
 

00:49:14.043 --> 00:49:14.889
You know?
 

00:49:14.889 --> 00:49:16.782
And, you know,
he also said,

00:49:16.782 --> 00:49:20.847
"Well you did something
and therefore for this weekend

00:49:20.847 --> 00:49:22.528
you cannot go out."
 

00:49:22.528 --> 00:49:23.300
Right?
 

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.530
They are acting out of
traditional authority;

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:30.500
authority which is ascribed to
them by tradition.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.840
 
 

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.559
And finally there is
charismatic authority.

00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:38.030
This is a very complex issue.
 

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:40.590
We will talk about this a great
deal.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:46.166
Charismatic authority refers to
the fact when a leader is trying

00:49:46.166 --> 00:49:50.150
to legitimate its right to issue
commands,

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:53.789
that he has some extraordinary
character--

00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:57.440
that he's something like,
you know,

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.268
an extraordinary,
unusual person.

00:50:01.268 --> 00:50:07.556
But it's also very important to
see that they are often seen as

00:50:07.556 --> 00:50:10.802
supernatural,
or even superhuman,

00:50:10.802 --> 00:50:14.150
having exceptional qualities.
 

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:18.326
But what is also very important
to see, that charismatic

00:50:18.326 --> 00:50:22.730
authority in Weber is not really
the characteristics of the

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:23.869
individual.
 

00:50:23.869 --> 00:50:27.297
This is what we attribute to
the individuals,

00:50:27.297 --> 00:50:30.880
to have these extraordinary
characteristics.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.779
In the most recent U.S.
 

00:50:32.779 --> 00:50:36.081
history, during the
electoral--during the

00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:39.675
presidential campaign,
Barack Obama,

00:50:39.675 --> 00:50:44.460
with his, you know,
charming personality,

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.940
with his extraordinary skills
of delivering speeches,

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:55.648
was capable to create a kind of
charismatic aura around himself.

00:50:55.648 --> 00:50:56.500
Right?
 

00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.224
People got excited,
you know, almost like around a

00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:00.985
rock star.
 

00:51:00.985 --> 00:51:01.670
Right?
 

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:08.596
And his whole arguments for
trying to legitimate himself was

00:51:08.596 --> 00:51:12.704
very much cast in charismatic
terms.

00:51:12.704 --> 00:51:13.880
Right?
 

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.791
Hope you can believe in.
 

00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:17.449
Right?
 

00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:21.400
This is a very typical
charismatic appeal.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.867
"You have to believe in me
because I'm offering you hope in

00:51:25.867 --> 00:51:27.780
a hopeless situation."
 

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.420
Right?
 

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.619
That's what creates charismatic
authority.

00:51:31.619 --> 00:51:35.123
How much charismatic authority
President Obama still has,

00:51:35.123 --> 00:51:37.940
this is another
question--right?--what you may

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.820
want to discuss in the
discussion section.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:46.007
It's also a problem whether,
you know, candidate Obama was

00:51:46.007 --> 00:51:48.739
really a charismatic leader.
 

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:53.684
Weber basically defined
charismatic leaders as the great

00:51:53.684 --> 00:51:57.909
leaders, the makers of great
world religions.

00:51:57.909 --> 00:52:01.309
Jesus Christ was a charismatic
leader.

00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:04.804
So in some ways to say modern
politicians, they are

00:52:04.804 --> 00:52:07.250
charismatic, it's a bit
slippery.

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:11.061
But I think the emphasis on
hope and the call,

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:16.400
"You believe me because I
will be able to deliver."

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.050
Yes we can.
 

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:21.159
You know, I remember when I
first heard him saying that,

00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:23.931
I said, "Yeah,
that's exactly the charismatic

00:52:23.931 --> 00:52:24.666
appeal."
 

00:52:24.666 --> 00:52:25.289
Right?
 

00:52:25.289 --> 00:52:27.418
It's not quite reasoned out.
 

00:52:27.418 --> 00:52:27.949
Right?
 

00:52:27.949 --> 00:52:33.197
And it moved me when Barack
Obama came out and he said,

00:52:33.197 --> 00:52:36.889
"You think nothing can be
done.

00:52:36.889 --> 00:52:38.750
But yes, we can.
 

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:40.411
Hope you can believe in."
 

00:52:40.411 --> 00:52:40.800
Right?
 

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.110
This is very much a charismatic
appeal.

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:45.800
That's what charismatic
authority is all about.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:51.000

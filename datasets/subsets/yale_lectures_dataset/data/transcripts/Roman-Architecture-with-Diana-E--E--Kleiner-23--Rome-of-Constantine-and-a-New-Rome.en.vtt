00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.550
Prof: Good morning
everybody.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.600
This is the last lecture in
Roman Architecture,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.794
and I think it's appropriate
that I deliver this last

00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:14.559
lecture,
which I call "Rome of

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.900
Constantine and a New
Rome," on Rome's birthday.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.500
Indeed, this is Rome's birthday
today, April 21^(st),

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.120
2009.
 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.091
Rome was born,
as you'll recall,

00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:35.777
on the 21^(st) of April in 753
B.C., which means that Rome is

00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:38.980
2762 years old today.
 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.272
And since birthdays are often
celebrated with cake and ice

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.518
cream,
I should make good today on the

00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:48.252
promise that I made to you at
the very beginning of the

00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:50.650
semester,
which is that sometime in the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.370
course of this semester I would
recommend four ice cream places

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.620
to you,
four gelaterias in Rome, to you.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.170
And I've only recommended two.
 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.533
I recommended Tre Scalini in
Piazza Navona,

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:07.097
and I recommended the Della
Palma that is located near the

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:08.140
Pantheon.
 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.310
So I haven't--there are two
more to go.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.158
And it seemed on Rome's
birthday, this was the perfect

00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:17.238
thing to begin the lecture with,
and that is to round the circle

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:21.421
and make you aware of the two
other best ice cream places in

00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:21.989
Rome.
 

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:25.105
And I show you here,
on the left-hand side of the

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:28.092
screen, Giolitti,
and on the right-hand side of

00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:29.909
the screen San Crispino.
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.857
And note the birthday balloons,
and that I'm enjoying myself

00:01:33.857 --> 00:01:36.400
very much on Rome's birthday,
today.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.700
But just so that you know where
these are.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.492
You know Rome so well by now
that I think I can give you

00:01:41.492 --> 00:01:43.980
directions that are going to
make sense to you.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.769
So you are in the core of
ancient Rome.

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:51.400
You've just been to visit the
Colosseum and the Roman Forum.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.420
Maybe you've been up on the
Capitoline Hill.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.069
You're exploring the Victor
Emmanuel Monument,

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.110
and so with your back to the
Victor Emmanuel Monument,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.840
look straight ahead and you see
the Corso,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.620
the so-called Corso,
the street of the racecourses,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.980
or the racecourse,
where the popes,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.060
by the way, used to race their
horses.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.229
You stand facing the Corso.
 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.699
You walk down the Corso.
 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.649
You're on your way,
in this regard,

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.460
toward the Piazza di Spagna,
the Spanish Steps.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.438
But before you get to the
Spanish Steps,

00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:26.319
you're going to notice one,
the only department store in

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.621
Rome,
Rinascente--that's why it's a

00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:31.258
good landmark--
Rinascente, on the right.

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:33.786
You take a left and you're
going to see the Column of

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.848
Marcus Aurelius,
which is a column we didn't

00:02:35.848 --> 00:02:38.764
look at this semester,
but is based on the Column of

00:02:38.764 --> 00:02:39.288
Trajan.
 

00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:42.340
You take a look at the Column
of Marcus Aurelius.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.526
You continue into the next
piazza, which is the Piazza

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:47.917
Montecitorio,
with a great obelisk in the

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.930
center and a government building
and a couple of hotels.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.542
You stay on the right and you
go down that next small street

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:57.419
and you hit Giolitti,
which in my opinion is the

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.870
single best ice cream place in
Rome.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.780
So if you're in Rome,
not to be missed.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.598
It has the best fruit flavors
in the city of Rome;

00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:06.870
in fact, anywhere in Italy that
I know of.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.878
And the second one that I
mention to you is San Crispino.

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:14.500
San Crispino is near the Trevi
Fountain in Rome.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.860
So you're going to go to the
Trevi Fountain in any case,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.122
and all you need to do when
you're facing the Trevi Fountain

00:03:21.122 --> 00:03:25.531
is to go about two blocks away
from the Trevi Fountain and you

00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:27.408
will hit San Crispino.
 

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:30.900
It has a smaller selection of
flavors, but everything is very,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.930
very good there.
 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.497
In fact, they've been such a
success that they have expanded

00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:38.098
and opened another one near the
Pantheon.

00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:41.026
So again, back to the Pantheon,
down that small street--I

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:43.590
already gave you the directions
to Della Palma.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.888
You go beyond Della Palma,
you take a left and you'll hit

00:03:46.888 --> 00:03:48.419
the second San Crispino.
 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.747
So very important to share this
with you, again before the term

00:03:52.747 --> 00:03:55.610
is up, and in honor of Rome's
birthday.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.401
Also, of course,
when you're at San Crispino,

00:03:58.401 --> 00:04:00.560
don't forget the Trevi
Fountain.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.766
And you probably all know the
tradition that when you go and

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:06.152
visit the Trevi Fountain,
which is always very

00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:08.613
crowded--this is actually a
small crowd compared to what's

00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:11.235
usually there--
after you've looked at it,

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:15.139
and enjoyed it for its own sake
and for architecture,

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.831
obviously, of a much later
period but I think one you can

00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:20.665
see is very closely based on a
lot of things that we've been

00:04:20.665 --> 00:04:22.060
looking at this semester.
 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.036
After you've looked at it--and
people usually do this right

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:27.759
before they leave Rome;
you go up to the fountain,

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.387
bring a coin--
it can be an American coin or

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:33.240
an Italian coin or any coin for
that matter--

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.009
you stand in front of the Trevi
Fountain,

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.379
with your back to the Trevi
Fountain,

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.286
you take a coin,
you throw it over your

00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:42.586
shoulder--
got to make sure it goes into

00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:45.964
the water and not on the side--
but throw it into the water,

00:04:45.964 --> 00:04:48.918
and that will ensure that you
will get to return to Rome

00:04:48.918 --> 00:04:49.509
someday.
 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.629
So don't forget to do that as
well.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:57.769
We spoke in the last lecture
about the Tetrarchy,

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:01.879
about Diocletian and his
formation of the Tetrarchy,

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.732
and his attempt to bring
stability back to Rome and to

00:05:05.732 --> 00:05:08.627
the Empire,
and how successful he was

00:05:08.627 --> 00:05:09.230
indeed.
 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.098
We also talked about the fact
that Diocletian and the other

00:05:13.098 --> 00:05:16.634
Tetrarchs were responsible for
some important building

00:05:16.634 --> 00:05:19.654
projects,
in fact, bringing architecture

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:23.687
back to Rome in a way that it
had been missing in the third

00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:24.730
century A.D.
 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.529
And I mentioned in particular
that Diocletian was interested

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.430
both in public and in private
architecture.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.978
And I remind you of an example
of public architecture that we

00:05:34.978 --> 00:05:37.444
looked at last time,
on the top left,

00:05:37.444 --> 00:05:40.000
the so-called Five Column
Monument,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.529
or Decennial Monument,
or Tetrachic Monument,

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.081
that Diocletian erected in the
Roman Forum to honor himself and

00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:50.240
to honor his formation of the
Tetrarchy,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.319
and his relationship to Jupiter.
 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.040
You'll remember the five
columns: four with the Tetrarchs

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.961
imaged on the top in the front,
the one of Jupiter behind,

00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:03.478
that this was located behind
the Rostra or the speaker's

00:06:03.478 --> 00:06:05.459
platform in the Roman Forum.
 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:08.896
We also talked about the fact
that Diocletian was interested

00:06:08.896 --> 00:06:12.682
again in private architecture,
that he built a palace for

00:06:12.682 --> 00:06:14.898
himself,
a place that he hoped to retire

00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:17.596
to,
on the Dalmatian Coast where he

00:06:17.596 --> 00:06:20.560
was born,
at a place called Split.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.660
And I remind you of it here,
a restored view showing you

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.363
what it looked like;
that it was essentially a

00:06:26.363 --> 00:06:29.067
fortified camp,
designed like a Roman

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:32.819
castrum,
with walls and towers and a

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.382
very distinctive octagonal
mausoleum that was located

00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:40.629
across from the Temple of
Jupiter.

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:45.363
So again his connecting himself
to Jupiter, honoring Jupiter as

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.889
he honors himself.
 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.870
And I also showed you an
example of the portraiture of

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.769
the Tetrarchs.
 

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:53.490
We talked about the
all-for-one-and-one-for-all

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.555
philosophy,
how they stuck together,

00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:57.720
not only in life but in their
portraits,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.845
and they depicted themselves,
or they had themselves depicted

00:07:01.845 --> 00:07:04.497
as this foursome,
in large part again to

00:07:04.497 --> 00:07:07.634
underscore the fact that all
four of them were co-equal

00:07:07.634 --> 00:07:09.622
emperors,
that all four of them--or

00:07:09.622 --> 00:07:12.386
almost co-equal emperors:
you'll remember that there were

00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:15.023
Augusti and Caesars,
so some had the slight upper

00:07:15.023 --> 00:07:17.620
hand, but for the most part they
worked together.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.185
They're represented as a whole,
and they're represented in a

00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:23.240
very similar way to one another.
 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.060
And we talked about the use of
geometric forms,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.129
the abstraction,
the solidity of these portraits

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:32.916
that I suggested mirrors this
new stability that Diocletian

00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:36.899
and the Tetrarchy have brought
to Rome and to the Empire.

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:40.029
And we saw that those same
qualities, that interest in

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:42.213
geometry, in abstraction,
in solidity,

00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:45.519
were characteristic also of
Tetrarchic architecture.

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:49.930
And we're going to see some of
those features continuing on in

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.980
the buildings that we're going
to be looking at today.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.161
Diocletian stepped down,
retired voluntarily,

00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:01.300
on the first of May in 305 A.D.
 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.208
And Maximian,
his co-Augustus,

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:08.721
stepped down as well,
and the two Caesars were

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:13.136
elevated to Augusti,
and two new Caesars were

00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:14.439
chosen.
 

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:18.961
But without the strong presence
of Diocletian the Tetrarchy fell

00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:23.125
apart, and Rome and the Empire
were once again plunged into

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:24.129
civil war.
 

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:29.120
The two main claimants for
imperial power that came out of

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.041
this civil war were Maxentius--
Maxentius who was the son of

00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:36.894
Maximian--
and Constantine--Constantine

00:08:36.894 --> 00:08:40.269
who eventually became
Constantine the Great--

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:43.820
Constantine who was the son of
Constantius Chlorus.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.418
And these two men,
Constantine and Maxentius,

00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:50.600
warred with one another for
imperial power,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.562
and they went against one
another in one of the most

00:08:53.562 --> 00:08:55.830
famous battles of all time:
in fact,

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.519
a battle that is as well known,
if not even more well known,

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:02.698
than the Battle of Actium,
and this is the Battle of the

00:09:02.698 --> 00:09:06.071
Milvian Bridge,
the Battle of the Milvian

00:09:06.071 --> 00:09:09.428
Bridge which took place in 312
A.D.

00:09:09.428 --> 00:09:14.221
And it was at that epic-making
battle that Constantine was

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:18.989
victorious over Maxentius,
that Constantine became sole

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:22.301
emperor of Rome --
so a move away from the

00:09:22.301 --> 00:09:26.970
Tetrarchy and the placement of
power in the hands of one man.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.440
Once again, Constantine becomes
sole emperor of Rome.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.408
And it was at that same battle,
the Battle of the Milvian

00:09:33.408 --> 00:09:35.383
Bridge--
and one of the reasons that

00:09:35.383 --> 00:09:38.591
it's such an important battle in
historical terms is the fact

00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:41.370
that it was at that Battle of
the Milvian Bridge that

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.740
Constantine was said to have
seen the vision of the cross;

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.690
the vision of the cross that
helped him to be victorious,

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:53.153
the vision of the cross that
eventually led him to convert to

00:09:53.153 --> 00:09:56.990
Christianity,
which he did on his deathbed.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.639
He was baptized a Christian on
his deathbed.

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:02.861
One of the most interesting
things that we'll talk about

00:10:02.861 --> 00:10:04.972
today,
and about the architecture

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:07.970
under Constantine the Great,
is that we will see,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.363
because he began as a pagan
emperor and ended his life as a

00:10:11.363 --> 00:10:14.486
Christian emperor,
he has in a sense one foot in

00:10:14.486 --> 00:10:18.288
the pagan past and the other
foot in the Christian future,

00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:21.181
and we're going to see that
reflected in the architecture

00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:25.139
that he commissioned,
as we look at that today.

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:29.091
A few coins of Constantine
which I think will help set the

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:33.668
stage for this one foot in the
past and one foot in the future,

00:10:33.668 --> 00:10:38.129
that is going to be the
leitmotif of today's lecture.

00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:41.272
I show you on the left-hand
side of the screen a coin of

00:10:41.272 --> 00:10:44.298
Constantine, when he first began
his rise to power.

00:10:44.298 --> 00:10:48.899
It was probably struck in
around 306 A.D.

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:51.379
And it's an interesting coin,
because if you remember--

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:52.649
I didn't bring it back to show
you--

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:56.120
but if you remember the coin of
Diocletian that I showed you,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.519
you'll recall that he was
represented in a very similar

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.149
fashion.
 

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:02.548
It's the sort of bearded
blockhead style,

00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:04.590
as I call it,
for the Tetrarchy;

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.918
a very cubic image,
a short, military hairstyle,

00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:11.202
closely cropped,
and a short beard that adheres

00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:14.129
very closely to the shape of the
face,

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:19.428
and the face masked itself with
cubic geometric forms.

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:22.870
So we see Constantine in his
very early portrait trying to

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.102
look like a Tetrarch,
trying to look like his father,

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.932
Constantius Chlorus,
trying to look like Diocletian,

00:11:28.932 --> 00:11:31.605
trying to fit in,
before he figures out the way

00:11:31.605 --> 00:11:35.303
that's going to enable him,
in fact, to become emperor,

00:11:35.303 --> 00:11:36.918
sole emperor of Rome.
 

00:11:36.918 --> 00:11:40.472
After he defeats Maxentius,
at the Battle of the Milvian

00:11:40.472 --> 00:11:42.174
Bridge,
we see the greatest

00:11:42.174 --> 00:11:45.120
transformation in the history of
Roman portraiture,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.970
in the history of self-imaging
by emperors,

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.697
by people in power,
and that is this transformation

00:11:50.697 --> 00:11:53.480
that I can show you from this
early coin of 306,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.529
to a coin that dates after the
Battle of the Milvian Bridge,

00:11:57.529 --> 00:11:59.710
and that also represents
Constantine.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.303
And what you see has happened
here is Constantine has shaved

00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:06.600
off his beard,
he has lost about twenty years

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.907
of age,
and he is shown with an

00:12:08.907 --> 00:12:11.028
entirely different hairstyle.
 

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:14.381
Not the short military
hairstyle that he wore because

00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:18.379
he wanted to liken himself to
his father and to Diocletian,

00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:20.960
but an entirely new hairstyle,
but one--

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.755
for any of you who know your
Roman portraiture or remember

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:26.749
the portraits that I showed you
fleetingly of Augustus and the

00:12:26.749 --> 00:12:30.010
Julio-Claudians--
he is wearing a cap of hair

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.250
that is very similar to--
a fuller cap of hair,

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.538
with comma-shaped locks over
his forehead,

00:12:35.538 --> 00:12:37.418
growing long on the nape of his
neck,

00:12:37.418 --> 00:12:40.840
that is characteristic of
Augustus and also of Trajan.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.058
He's in fact a neo-Augustus in
this image, with a neo-Trajanic

00:12:45.058 --> 00:12:45.889
hairstyle.
 

00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:46.678
Why?
 

00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:50.202
Because he is--as sole emperor
he has made the decision that he

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:53.267
wants to now ally himself,
not with the Tetrarchs,

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:55.610
which are of the past at this
point,

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.253
but rather with the great
emperors of the past:

00:12:58.253 --> 00:12:59.980
with Augustus,
with Trajan,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.048
and as we'll see also with
Hadrian and with Marcus

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:03.798
Aurelius.
 

00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:06.028
And we can see that very
important break here,

00:13:06.028 --> 00:13:08.009
and we'll see it also in
architecture.

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:12.673
Another coin down here
representing Constantine,

00:13:12.673 --> 00:13:15.850
with a bunch of pagan regalia.
 

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.918
We see him, as so many of the
earlier emperors of Rome,

00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:23.913
depicted along with a patron
god, in this case the god

00:13:23.913 --> 00:13:26.250
Helios, the god of the sun.
 

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.820
And you can see Constantine in
the foreground,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.464
Helios in the background:
Helios represented with a rayed

00:13:32.464 --> 00:13:34.619
crown--
and that's why we know it's

00:13:34.619 --> 00:13:37.120
him--silhouetted right behind
the emperor.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.283
The emperor is shown as
warlike, with military costume,

00:13:40.283 --> 00:13:42.570
a spear, and then a shield over
here.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.837
And if we look closely at the
shield we'll see the depiction

00:13:45.837 --> 00:13:48.219
of someone in a chariot,
led by four horses,

00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:50.379
coming--it's represented
frontally;

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:53.889
it's the solar chariot,
the solar chariot of Helios.

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:57.580
So a coin that is very much in
the usual pagan tradition,

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.774
where we see Constantine
associating himself with the

00:14:02.774 --> 00:14:07.418
pagan past and with a pagan god,
in this case Helios.

00:14:07.418 --> 00:14:10.616
This coin, however,
that was also made after the

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:14.291
Battle of the Milvian Bridge,
shows us a very different

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:15.379
Constantine.
 

00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:19.288
It's an interesting frontal
portrait, which is rare on Roman

00:14:19.288 --> 00:14:19.820
coins.
 

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.129
He is still shown as the
warrior.

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:23.570
He's in military costume.
 

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.162
He's holding the reins of his
horse, who's also depicted

00:14:27.162 --> 00:14:29.710
nicely in this portrait on this
coin.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.360
If you look very closely at his
shield,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.634
you will actually see that it
still is decorated with a pagan

00:14:35.634 --> 00:14:37.894
symbol,
with the she-wolf suckling

00:14:37.894 --> 00:14:39.149
Romulus and Remus.
 

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:40.490
But look up here.
 

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.724
The scepter that he carries is
not the usual scepter or spear

00:14:43.724 --> 00:14:47.063
that we see in pagan imagery,
but a cross scepter,

00:14:47.063 --> 00:14:49.856
a cross scepter and--
I don't know if you can see it

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:53.070
from where you sit--
he wears a medallion on the top

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.539
of his very elaborate helmet,
with plumage and so on,

00:14:57.539 --> 00:15:00.538
a medallion that has the
Chi-Rho,

00:15:00.538 --> 00:15:03.320
C-h-i, dash,
R-h-o, the Chi-Rho,

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.460
which was the Christian
monogram.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.731
So we see him in this image,
not as the great pagan warrior,

00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:13.340
but as the new Christian
crusader.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.855
So a very important change from
paganism to Christianity,

00:15:17.855 --> 00:15:22.370
that as I mentioned already we
will see also reflected in

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.870
Constantine's architecture.
 

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.163
Constantine learned a lot
though from the Tetrarchs,

00:15:28.163 --> 00:15:32.038
and one of the things that he
continued on was to build great

00:15:32.038 --> 00:15:35.302
public architecture;
public architecture for the

00:15:35.302 --> 00:15:37.840
benefit of the Roman populace at
large.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.130
He follows the lead of
Diocletian in this regard and

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:46.168
adds another very large imperial
bath to Rome;

00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:49.408
and I show you a plan of that
imperial bath here.

00:15:49.408 --> 00:15:52.972
It bears his name,
the Baths of Constantine,

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:54.879
and dates to 320 A.D.
 

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:56.120
It is located in Rome.
 

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.058
It is located on the Quirinal
Hill, the Quirinal Hill.

00:16:01.058 --> 00:16:02.668
And that should ring a bell for
all of you,

00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:05.048
because you'll remember it was
Trajan--

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.267
Trajan, and remember
Constantine is imaging himself

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:11.548
as a neo-Augustus with a
neo-Trajanic hairstyle--

00:16:11.548 --> 00:16:16.217
Trajan who built--who had much,
a good part of the Quirinal

00:16:16.217 --> 00:16:19.678
Hill cut back to make way for
his forum,

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:23.998
and then placed his markets on
part of what remained of the

00:16:23.998 --> 00:16:25.190
Quirinal Hill.
 

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.024
So the Quirinal Hill was
associated in everybody's mind

00:16:29.024 --> 00:16:30.019
with Trajan.
 

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:33.580
Constantine wanted to associate
himself with Trajan.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.532
So when he decides where to
place his new bath structure,

00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:39.720
he chooses the Quirinal Hill.
 

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.125
This is not coincidental;
it was very deliberative on his

00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:43.548
part.
 

00:16:43.548 --> 00:16:47.062
He builds it in a manner that
is completely consistent with

00:16:47.062 --> 00:16:50.698
imperial bath architecture in
Rome: the imperial bath type of

00:16:50.698 --> 00:16:53.908
architecture in Rome that we've
already studied,

00:16:53.908 --> 00:16:56.749
from the time of Titus,
up through the time of

00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:57.570
Diocletian.
 

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.960
The baths on the Quirinal Hill
are no longer preserved,

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.840
but we fortunately have some
drawings that were made by the

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.250
famous architect Andrea
Palladio,

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.116
P-a-l-l-a-d-i-o,
Andrea Palladio,

00:17:11.116 --> 00:17:14.970
who drew it when it was in
better shape,

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.894
and his drawings of the Baths
of Constantine allow us to see

00:17:19.894 --> 00:17:24.318
exactly what these baths were
like in their heyday.

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:27.855
And we can see,
although Palladio's drawing

00:17:27.855 --> 00:17:30.970
concentrates on the bathing
block,

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.230
you can see that he also
includes down here--

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.749
and it's probably that this is
all that remained of this

00:17:35.749 --> 00:17:38.038
particular part of the bath in
Palladio's time--

00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:40.978
you can see he includes down
here the great hemicycle that

00:17:40.978 --> 00:17:43.038
we've seen in so many of these
baths,

00:17:43.038 --> 00:17:48.009
that are part of that precinct
that surrounds the bath block.

00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:50.910
So this suggests to us,
and I think very convincingly,

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.400
that this bath,
this bathing block,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.834
was also placed in one of these
very large precincts that had

00:17:56.834 --> 00:18:00.096
all the seminar and lecture
rooms and libraries around the

00:18:00.096 --> 00:18:02.913
perimeter of it,
and that this was lined with

00:18:02.913 --> 00:18:05.851
seats and probably used for
people to watch athletic

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:09.583
contests,
or perhaps even plays of other

00:18:09.583 --> 00:18:10.278
kinds.
 

00:18:10.278 --> 00:18:13.604
The bathing block again we can
see conforms extremely well to

00:18:13.604 --> 00:18:15.818
the other baths that we've
looked at,

00:18:15.818 --> 00:18:17.930
to the Baths of Caracalla and
Diocletian,

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.460
for example,
with a natatio,

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.496
rectangular in shape,
with a frigidarium that

00:18:23.496 --> 00:18:25.700
is also rectangular and has
three--

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.336
a triple groin vault,
as you can see designated in

00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:30.800
Palladio's drawing,
and down here--this is a

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.071
re-interpretation,
by the way, of Palladio's

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:35.834
drawing from Ward-Perkins,
this plan that you see on the

00:18:35.834 --> 00:18:36.420
screen now.
 

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.144
A tepidarium over here
that's somewhat more unusual in

00:18:41.144 --> 00:18:45.061
shape than we tend to see,
where we have a series of

00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:48.314
lobes, four lobes in fact,
that have been--that have

00:18:48.314 --> 00:18:51.255
expanded the space almost--
well it's sort of a circle,

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:55.022
trying to become an oval,
I suppose--but you can see the

00:18:55.022 --> 00:19:00.730
way in which they have expanded,
and we call that kind of space

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.246
quadrilobate,
quadrilobate,

00:19:03.246 --> 00:19:05.000
and we see that here.
 

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.857
And then we also see--this is
most interesting -- how the

00:19:07.857 --> 00:19:09.390
caldarium is treated.
 

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.640
Because as you've seen in the
baths that we've looked at,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.890
the imperial baths that we've
looked at,

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.625
if there's any room that's
different in each of these it's

00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:16.730
the caldarium.
 

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.686
You'll recall that Diocletian
had moved to a rectangular

00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:22.000
caldarium,
with radiating alcoves.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.303
But Constantine and his
architects move back to the

00:19:25.303 --> 00:19:28.738
circular caldarium that
we saw in the Baths of

00:19:28.738 --> 00:19:31.615
Caracalla,
uses the same sort of scheme

00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:34.108
here, with three radiating
alcoves,

00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:37.818
all of those screened from the
outer space with columns,

00:19:37.818 --> 00:19:42.163
and the rest of the structure,
around these main rooms of the

00:19:42.163 --> 00:19:45.710
bathing block that are related
to one another,

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.308
axially we see the other rooms
symmetrically disposed.

00:19:49.308 --> 00:19:52.336
One other important point to
make about the caldarium

00:19:52.336 --> 00:19:55.106
is that we see that it too
corresponds to a development

00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:58.237
that we've already begun to see
in some of the other buildings

00:19:58.237 --> 00:20:01.486
that we looked at,
especially in the last lecture,

00:20:01.486 --> 00:20:04.784
and that is this move away from
the oculus for

00:20:04.784 --> 00:20:06.368
round-domed buildings.
 

00:20:06.368 --> 00:20:08.635
This round--this
caldarium does not have

00:20:08.635 --> 00:20:10.951
an oculus,
as so many caldaria did

00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:13.295
in the past;
think back to the--well or so

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:16.567
many bathing rooms did--think
back to the frigidaria in

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:19.250
Pompeii, for example,
with their oculus.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.400
The oculus is no longer
used here,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.594
and instead we see windows in
the base of the dome that are

00:20:24.594 --> 00:20:28.117
very similar to the windows that
we saw in a couple of Tetrarchic

00:20:28.117 --> 00:20:28.890
buildings.
 

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:33.432
We're going to see it elsewhere
today, and I'll reiterate that

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.400
point then.
 

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.753
Constantine,
like so many Roman emperors

00:20:36.753 --> 00:20:39.920
before him,
did complete buildings that had

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.518
been begun by his predecessors,
and he did this for some of the

00:20:45.518 --> 00:20:47.820
Tetrarchs,
including his father,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.690
not surprisingly,
Constantius Chlorus.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.789
We know that Constantius
Chlorus had chosen as his

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:58.471
capital the city of Trier,
the city of Trier,

00:20:58.471 --> 00:21:01.818
in what was Gaul but now is
Germany.

00:21:01.818 --> 00:21:04.650
And I show you the location of
Trier.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.630
This is a map showing the
locations,

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.900
as we've discussed so many
times this term,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.354
of many of the--of all of the
places that we've looked at in

00:21:14.354 --> 00:21:15.940
the Western Empire.
 

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.519
And you can see the French
cities that we looked at just

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:20.757
last time,
in Gaul, and then up there

00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:25.038
Trier, in what is now Germany,
located near the modern city of

00:21:25.038 --> 00:21:25.700
Cologne.
 

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.848
This was the chosen capital for
Constantius Chlorus.

00:21:29.848 --> 00:21:34.087
Even before Constantius Chlorus
began to build a palace for

00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:37.297
himself at Trier,
as the other Tetrarchs had done

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.269
elsewhere in the Roman
provinces,

00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:42.891
there was quite a bit of
building activity going on with

00:21:42.891 --> 00:21:46.335
regard to one project in Trier,
in the third century,

00:21:46.335 --> 00:21:49.318
and not surprisingly that too
was a defensive wall.

00:21:49.318 --> 00:21:54.403
That part of the Empire was
being attacked on a regular

00:21:54.403 --> 00:21:57.773
basis by Germanic tribes,
by the Franks and by the

00:21:57.773 --> 00:22:00.064
Alemanni, were coming in,
wreaking havoc in that part of

00:22:00.064 --> 00:22:03.689
the world,
and a decision was taken,

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:07.452
not surprisingly,
in 275 and 276--because you'll

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:10.553
remember that's exactly when the
Aurelian Walls were dedicated in

00:22:10.553 --> 00:22:14.123
Rome,
275--to build a major wall in

00:22:14.123 --> 00:22:17.690
this part of the Empire as well.
 

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:22.328
And we have some part of that
wall still preserved,

00:22:22.328 --> 00:22:26.380
especially a gate in that wall
called the Porta Nigra,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.380
which I show you here on the
right-hand side of the screen.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.409
The Porta Nigra which,
although the walls were begun

00:22:32.409 --> 00:22:34.884
in the 270s--
so the walls date primarily in

00:22:34.884 --> 00:22:37.788
the third century--
this particular gate was not

00:22:37.788 --> 00:22:41.548
added to the walls until the
early fourth century A.D.,

00:22:41.548 --> 00:22:45.250
during the time of Constantius
Chlorus,

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:52.450
and Constantine completes this
gateway and those baths .

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.092
If we compare the gate at the
Porta Nigra in Trier to the gate

00:22:56.092 --> 00:22:58.779
that we looked at from the
Aurelian Walls,

00:22:58.779 --> 00:23:03.568
the so-called Porta Appia that
does date to around 275--

00:23:03.568 --> 00:23:06.400
and you see it again in this
restored view from Ward-Perkins,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.259
on the left-hand side of the
screen--

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:10.921
you will see the close
resemblance of the Porta Nigra

00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:12.558
to the Porta Maggiore in Rome.
 

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:17.890
By that I mean both of them
have two arcuated entranceways;

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.750
both of them have round towers,
as you can see here;

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:27.900
both of them have arcuated
windows or blind windows,

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.275
as you can see;
in the case of the Porta Nigra

00:23:32.275 --> 00:23:36.846
they have columns between them,
which is not the case in the

00:23:36.846 --> 00:23:38.009
Porta Appia.
 

00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:41.942
The main difference between
these two is that the Porta

00:23:41.942 --> 00:23:46.458
Appia in Rome you'll recall was
made out of concrete faced with

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:49.212
brick,
the most contemporary building

00:23:49.212 --> 00:23:51.845
material,
whereas you can clearly see by

00:23:51.845 --> 00:23:55.740
looking at the Porta Nigra that
the Porta Nigra is made out of

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.000
stone,
out of cut stone construction

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.910
-- extremely old-fashioned at
this particular time.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.368
But I think it is very likely
that they wanted,

00:24:04.368 --> 00:24:07.278
by choosing this for this
particular part of the world--

00:24:07.278 --> 00:24:11.670
and it is--this cut stone
construction is local stone--

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.769
by choosing this,
they wanted to reassert a

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:18.608
relationship between the early
fourth century A.D.

00:24:18.608 --> 00:24:21.250
and earlier Rome,
and especially earlier Rome and

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.877
imperial power,
the very symbols of Roman

00:24:23.877 --> 00:24:27.088
power, buildings like the
Theater of Marcellus,

00:24:27.088 --> 00:24:31.028
and especially the Colosseum in
Rome;

00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:33.223
we've talked about that as the
very icon of Rome,

00:24:33.223 --> 00:24:34.868
its ability to impress and to
awe.

00:24:34.868 --> 00:24:39.122
And I think they wanted to take
advantage of that kind of awe

00:24:39.122 --> 00:24:42.594
inspiring rhetoric,
you know, visual rhetoric that

00:24:42.594 --> 00:24:44.650
such a choice could make.
 

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.970
And I think it's an example of
the fact,

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:53.337
just as Constantine reaches
back to emperors like Trajan and

00:24:53.337 --> 00:24:56.042
Augustus,
to associate himself with in

00:24:56.042 --> 00:24:59.673
his portraiture,
I think that they had reason to

00:24:59.673 --> 00:25:04.778
look back to some of the great
buildings of the Roman past,

00:25:04.778 --> 00:25:10.578
and to use that kind of visual
imagery to reassert that Rome,

00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:13.160
despite the fact that they were
being attacked by barbarians,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.005
all was well in Rome,
or continued to be well in the

00:25:18.005 --> 00:25:20.664
capital,
as well as on the frontiers,

00:25:20.664 --> 00:25:23.778
and this kind of image I think
worked in that regard.

00:25:23.778 --> 00:25:27.342
Well one hopes that--well they
thought it would work at any

00:25:27.342 --> 00:25:30.166
rate in that regard,
even into the early fourth

00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:31.150
century A.D.
 

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.701
Here's another view,
the same view,

00:25:32.701 --> 00:25:33.660
of the Porta Nigra.
 

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.210
And I compare it also to a
detail from the Porta Maggiore

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.568
in Rome, which you'll recall was
built by Claudius.

00:25:40.568 --> 00:25:43.230
There is an interesting
resemblance between the two,

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.868
and many scholars have called
attention to that,

00:25:45.868 --> 00:25:49.484
because the stone of the Porta
Nigra is not as smoothed over as

00:25:49.484 --> 00:25:52.808
the stone of the Colosseum or
the Theater of Marcellus;

00:25:52.808 --> 00:25:56.718
it's left in a much more rough
state, a rough state that

00:25:56.718 --> 00:26:00.625
reminds one of the rusticated
masonry of Claudius' Porta

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:01.548
Maggiore.
 

00:26:01.548 --> 00:26:05.253
But remember that in the case
of the Porta Maggiore,

00:26:05.253 --> 00:26:08.522
there was a deliberate
disjunction between the

00:26:08.522 --> 00:26:12.009
rusticated masonry and the
finished masonry;

00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:16.259
the finished capitals and also
the finished pediments above.

00:26:16.259 --> 00:26:19.795
And we talked about the fact
that we believe that that has a

00:26:19.795 --> 00:26:23.151
lot to do with the particular
personality and antiquarian

00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:26.569
interests of Claudius,
who liked the intellectual

00:26:26.569 --> 00:26:30.450
exercise and idea of playing off
one against the other.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.470
We don't see that same
combination here.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:36.972
We don't see the rough and the
finished, in the case of the

00:26:36.972 --> 00:26:38.759
Porta Nigra in Trier.
 

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:41.390
And it has been suggested,
and I think correctly so,

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.351
that the reason that the Porta
Nigra looks the way it does is

00:26:45.351 --> 00:26:48.516
not deliberate,
the way the Porta Maggiore is,

00:26:48.516 --> 00:26:51.480
but rather because it really
was unfinished;

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.808
the blocks were never fully
smoothed over.

00:26:54.808 --> 00:26:58.949
But it makes a very attractive
appearance even still today,

00:26:58.949 --> 00:27:00.019
despite that.
 

00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:05.596
So Constantine completed this
gateway, but he also completed

00:27:05.596 --> 00:27:10.038
the palace that had been begun
by his father;

00:27:10.038 --> 00:27:12.509
Constantius Chlorus had begun a
palace in Trier.

00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:15.868
The palace had a very large and
impressive bath building,

00:27:15.868 --> 00:27:18.936
as a piece of it,
and it also had this building

00:27:18.936 --> 00:27:22.672
that is usually referred to
today as the Aula Palatina or

00:27:22.672 --> 00:27:25.520
the Basilica --
the Aula Palatina or the

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.180
Basilica.
 

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.640
We're not exactly sure how it
was used in the palace,

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.459
but possibly in the same way
that the basilica was in the

00:27:33.459 --> 00:27:37.160
Palace of Domitian on the
Palatine Hill,

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.058
as a place where he could sit
and try cases himself.

00:27:42.058 --> 00:27:45.230
It may have been used in the
same fashion here.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.269
And I can show you it's
extremely well preserved.

00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:53.855
It dates to 300 to 310 A.D.;
again, part of the Palace of

00:27:53.855 --> 00:27:57.390
Constantius Chlorus,
completed by Constantine.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.589
We see a plan and a restored
view from Ward-Perkins now on

00:28:00.589 --> 00:28:01.318
the screen.
 

00:28:01.318 --> 00:28:04.798
And if you look at the plan,
you will see that in the main

00:28:04.798 --> 00:28:08.461
it follows the basilican plan
that we've become so accustomed

00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:12.368
to: a great open rectangular
space with an apse on one end,

00:28:12.368 --> 00:28:15.548
and with all attention drawn
toward that apse.

00:28:15.548 --> 00:28:19.180
So in that sense again,
one foot in the pagan past;

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.849
it looks back to basilicas of
an earlier date,

00:28:22.849 --> 00:28:27.825
be they the one in Domitian's
Palace or the Forum of Trajan in

00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:28.558
Rome.
 

00:28:28.558 --> 00:28:30.528
But there are some differences
here.

00:28:30.528 --> 00:28:33.840
One of them is the fact that
you can see that there are no

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.410
columns inside the cella.
 

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.228
That's interesting,
and it is in keeping with the

00:28:38.228 --> 00:28:41.338
Tetrarchic aesthetic that we've
already described,

00:28:41.338 --> 00:28:44.125
for the Curia,
for example,

00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:48.088
with a box-like open space
inside,

00:28:48.088 --> 00:28:51.589
without any columnar decoration
at all.

00:28:51.589 --> 00:28:54.279
No columns in here;
stark, geometric,

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:56.640
abstract in the Tetrachic
manner.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.848
But they have placed columns on
the outside of the Basilica,

00:29:00.848 --> 00:29:04.730
in a kind of courtyard on
either side,

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:09.191
columns that you can see here,
which is a very interesting and

00:29:09.191 --> 00:29:11.970
unusual and in fact unique
approach.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.368
You can also see there is a
transverse corridor over here,

00:29:16.368 --> 00:29:20.720
and that--a transverse--a
vestibule,

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.700
a transverse vestibule,
entrance vestibule,

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.660
which is unusual and which we
don't see in typical Roman

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.460
basilican architecture.
 

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.930
We call that a narthex,
n-a-r-t-h-e-x,

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.890
and this addition of the
narthex here,

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.455
the transverse vestibule,
is interesting because it is

00:29:38.455 --> 00:29:42.358
going to become the basis for
most church architecture,

00:29:42.358 --> 00:29:45.328
both from the time--basilican
church architecture--

00:29:45.328 --> 00:29:49.194
in the time of Constantine,
because Constantine does found

00:29:49.194 --> 00:29:50.851
Old--
does build Old St.

00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:54.788
Peter's and other churches in
Rome, and others follow suit.

00:29:54.788 --> 00:29:58.355
So again, one foot in the pagan
past, one in the Christian

00:29:58.355 --> 00:29:58.920
future.
 

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.838
On the left-hand side of the
screen,

00:30:00.838 --> 00:30:04.508
the restored view of the
exterior, shows not only those

00:30:04.508 --> 00:30:08.092
low-lying columnar courtyards,
but also that there were

00:30:08.092 --> 00:30:09.490
railings on two stories.
 

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:13.307
It does show you as well--and
the building is made out of

00:30:13.307 --> 00:30:16.106
solid brick--
it does show you as well the

00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:18.038
rounded windows,
the arched windows,

00:30:18.038 --> 00:30:18.868
which we have seen.
 

00:30:18.868 --> 00:30:22.398
The round topped windows which
we have seen have become

00:30:22.398 --> 00:30:25.078
customary for Tetrarchic
architecture,

00:30:25.078 --> 00:30:28.940
as well as the very interesting
use of projecting elements,

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.848
that are very simple -- they
look almost like pilasters,

00:30:31.848 --> 00:30:34.059
but they're not pilasters,
they're a simplified,

00:30:34.059 --> 00:30:36.480
abstract version of pilasters.
 

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.098
So this paring down of the
elements that is so consistent

00:30:41.098 --> 00:30:43.410
with the Tetrarchic ethos.
 

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:47.160
Here's a view of the Aula
Palatina as it looks today.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.762
Again, it is extremely well
preserved, as you can see,

00:30:50.762 --> 00:30:54.844
but it no longer has its outer
courtyard and it no longer has

00:30:54.844 --> 00:30:56.000
its railings.
 

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.808
But the rest is there.
 

00:30:57.808 --> 00:31:00.567
You can see these wonderful
round-headed windows and how

00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:01.420
large they are.
 

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.465
We've talked about the ability
of architects to dematerialize

00:31:05.465 --> 00:31:09.541
the wall at this point in time,
and the way in which they have

00:31:09.541 --> 00:31:11.798
opened it up with very large
windows.

00:31:11.798 --> 00:31:14.707
And you can see what I was
describing just before,

00:31:14.707 --> 00:31:18.028
these molded elements that
project out into our space.

00:31:18.028 --> 00:31:21.422
They kind of look like they're
made to conjure up pilasters,

00:31:21.422 --> 00:31:24.585
but they don't have any
capitals and they don't have any

00:31:24.585 --> 00:31:26.969
bases;
they're, in my mind,

00:31:26.969 --> 00:31:30.769
a kind of abstract version of a
pilaster.

00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:35.105
And they're very effective,
I think, in terms of the

00:31:35.105 --> 00:31:39.098
aesthetic appeal of this
particular building.

00:31:39.098 --> 00:31:43.088
While the Basilica at the
Palace at Trier,

00:31:43.088 --> 00:31:45.269
the Palace of Constantius
Chlorus at Trier,

00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:49.740
is so clearly based on earlier
Roman basilican architecture,

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.940
it looks to the future.
 

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.009
And if we look around Rome in
the years following the

00:31:56.009 --> 00:31:59.768
construction of buildings like
the Aula Palatina,

00:31:59.768 --> 00:32:02.430
we see lots of early churches.
 

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.009
I show you the church of Santa
Sabina, S-a-b-i-n-a,

00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:09.232
Santa Sabina in Rome,
which dates to 425 A.D.,

00:32:09.232 --> 00:32:11.308
so the fifth century A.D.
 

00:32:11.308 --> 00:32:16.039
And I think you can see how
similar it is to the Aula

00:32:16.039 --> 00:32:20.000
Palatina: the basilican form;
the apse at the end;

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.885
the very large round-topped
windows that we see in the

00:32:24.885 --> 00:32:26.730
Basilica at Trier.
 

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:30.462
The interior of the Aula
Palatina is also very well

00:32:30.462 --> 00:32:31.359
preserved.
 

00:32:31.359 --> 00:32:34.000
You see a view of it here.
 

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.433
It has been transformed,
not surprisingly,

00:32:35.433 --> 00:32:36.519
into a church in later times.
 

00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:38.318
It's a perfect space for that.
 

00:32:38.318 --> 00:32:42.250
And I think it's well worth
comparing it to the interior of

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.029
the Curia that we looked at last
time,

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:49.240
because again it shows a vision
of the Tetrarchy --

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.759
a vision that is consistent
from Rome to the provinces;

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:56.048
this whole idea of paring
things down to their basics,

00:32:56.048 --> 00:32:59.490
of creating a box-like shape,
no columnar architecture

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.096
whatsoever,
a very sparsely decorated

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:06.032
rectangular space with a flat
ceiling and with round-headed

00:33:06.032 --> 00:33:06.779
windows.
 

00:33:06.779 --> 00:33:09.019
We see the same concept here.
 

00:33:09.019 --> 00:33:12.022
Here they've placed the
round-headed windows on two

00:33:12.022 --> 00:33:15.267
stories, which has opened the
building up even more and

00:33:15.267 --> 00:33:18.848
allowed light to flow into it;
no columnar decoration

00:33:18.848 --> 00:33:19.690
whatsoever.
 

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.690
The scheme of two rows of
round-headed windows,

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.828
in the niche as well,
also opening it up,

00:33:26.828 --> 00:33:30.278
dematerializing it,
allowing light to stream into

00:33:30.278 --> 00:33:33.730
the building in what is a very
spiritual way,

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:39.570
and again not at all surprising
that it would be transformed in

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.210
later times into a church.
 

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.006
Once again one foot in the
pagan past, one in the Christian

00:33:45.006 --> 00:33:45.440
future.
 

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.258
I show you a restored
view--we've looked at it

00:33:48.258 --> 00:33:51.891
before--of the Basilica Ulpia in
Rome, part of the Forum of

00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:52.578
Trajan.
 

00:33:52.578 --> 00:33:56.840
It's that kind of thing,
that kind of basilican plan

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:01.771
that lies behind the design of
the Basilica at the Palace of

00:34:01.771 --> 00:34:04.528
Constantius Chlorus in Trier.
 

00:34:04.528 --> 00:34:07.509
But it also looks forward to
others.

00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:09.789
I show you here the interior of
Santa Sabina.

00:34:09.789 --> 00:34:11.697
This might not have been the
best to choose,

00:34:11.697 --> 00:34:14.362
because you can see the columns
have been reintroduced in the

00:34:14.362 --> 00:34:15.650
interior of Santa Sabina.
 

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:18.702
But if you think those columns
away and just look at the way in

00:34:18.702 --> 00:34:21.648
which the apse is designed,
with the round-headed windows,

00:34:21.648 --> 00:34:24.539
the same round-headed windows
in the upper story up here,

00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:28.800
I think that you can see how
much it owes to buildings like

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.269
the Aula Palatina.
 

00:34:33.559 --> 00:34:39.561
The round dome building type,
just like the basilican type,

00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:44.942
was to be very important in the
Constantinian period,

00:34:44.942 --> 00:34:47.840
and also in later times.
 

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.545
And I show you--I remind you of
some of the important domed

00:34:51.545 --> 00:34:55.188
rooms that we've looked at in
the course of this semester:

00:34:55.188 --> 00:34:59.150
at the frigidarium at
the Stabian Baths of Pompeii;

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:02.317
at the Temple of Mercury from
the spa at Baia,

00:35:02.317 --> 00:35:04.710
the so-called Temple of
Mercury;

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:09.099
the octagonal room of Nero's
Domus Aurea;

00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:13.190
and the dome of the Pantheon
here on the far right.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.735
There is no more important form
in Roman architecture than the

00:35:16.735 --> 00:35:19.909
domed room,
very characteristic of the

00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:25.539
Romans, and a special gift that
they passed on to posterity,

00:35:25.539 --> 00:35:27.349
as you well know.
 

00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:32.099
And this type of building
continued to be explored in the

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:34.050
Constantinian period.
 

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.478
I could show you several
examples, but I've chosen to

00:35:37.478 --> 00:35:41.175
show you just one of those;
and it's the one that you now

00:35:41.175 --> 00:35:44.440
see on the screen in plan,
a plan from Ward-Perkins.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.394
This is the so-called
"Temple of Minerva

00:35:47.394 --> 00:35:48.940
Medica" in Rome.
 

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.230
It's not a temple at all.
 

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.559
It dates to the early fourth
century A.D.

00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:55.788
It's not a temple,
but what it was,

00:35:55.788 --> 00:35:57.690
was a pavilion in a garden.
 

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:01.110
We know that an emperor of the
third century A.D.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.027
by the name of Gallienus,
G-a-l-l-i-e-n-u-s,

00:36:05.027 --> 00:36:10.496
Gallienus, was responsible for
building some imperial gardens

00:36:10.496 --> 00:36:13.139
in the third century A.D.
 

00:36:13.139 --> 00:36:18.641
-- so this was another project
that did happen in the third

00:36:18.641 --> 00:36:21.773
century A.D.,
the building of some imperial

00:36:21.773 --> 00:36:25.112
gardens for the enjoyment of the
emperors and of the imperial

00:36:25.112 --> 00:36:25.670
family.
 

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.442
And it was in these gardens
that were created in the third

00:36:29.442 --> 00:36:32.090
century that this pavilion was
added,

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.456
during the Constantinian
period, in the early fourth

00:36:35.456 --> 00:36:36.380
century A.D.
 

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.719
And I show you a plan of that
temple,

00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:42.039
that so-called Temple of
Minerva Medica,

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:45.710
or this pavilion in the
so-called Licinian,

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:50.300
L-i-c-i-n-i-a-n,
the Licinian Gardens,

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.809
as commissioned by Gallienus,
the Licinian Gardens.

00:36:54.809 --> 00:36:55.719
And we see it here.
 

00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:58.268
And it's very interesting
because although it clearly--

00:36:58.268 --> 00:37:00.480
it's a building made out of
concrete,

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.460
faced with brick--and although
it clearly is based on some of

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.449
the buildings that I just showed
you--

00:37:05.449 --> 00:37:08.369
the typical round structure
with oculus,

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:12.449
the frigidaria,
the spa, the octagonal room,

00:37:12.449 --> 00:37:15.869
and the Pantheon--you can see
that the architects of this

00:37:15.869 --> 00:37:18.190
period were still able to
innovate,

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:22.768
and have gone further by
creating not a round building,

00:37:22.768 --> 00:37:25.969
although at first it looks
round, or an octagonal building,

00:37:25.969 --> 00:37:30.190
but a decagonal building,
a ten-sided building.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:33.264
And you can see ten--you can
see radiating apses,

00:37:33.264 --> 00:37:36.019
nine, and then the entranceway
over here.

00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:38.349
So ten-sided structure.
 

00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:44.322
If you look very carefully at
the plan you will notice though

00:37:44.322 --> 00:37:47.829
that the uppermost apse,
the one that is located

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:49.219
directly across from the
entranceway,

00:37:49.219 --> 00:37:52.789
is a tiny bit larger than the
others.

00:37:52.789 --> 00:37:57.289
So that gives the building a
little bit--

00:37:57.289 --> 00:38:01.539
even though it's a round
building--a little bit of a

00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:04.925
longitudinal axis,
which is very interesting --

00:38:04.925 --> 00:38:08.019
this incorporation of a
longitudinal axis into a round

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:08.780
structure.
 

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.059
You can also see the way in
which the radiating apses,

00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:14.739
the two on either side,
left and right,

00:38:14.739 --> 00:38:18.922
are screened by columns,
in a way that we've also become

00:38:18.922 --> 00:38:20.139
accustomed to.
 

00:38:20.139 --> 00:38:23.835
And I believe that those
columns, yes I'm pretty sure,

00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:27.599
that those columns have a
triple arcuation up above.

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:30.289
So that--yes,
you can see that in plan--

00:38:30.289 --> 00:38:35.465
a triple arcuation above that
we've seen also is

00:38:35.465 --> 00:38:40.420
characteristic of late Roman
architecture,

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.320
not only in the private sphere,
as this is,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.719
but also in the more public
sphere.

00:38:45.719 --> 00:38:48.585
But going back to that
longitudinal axis,

00:38:48.585 --> 00:38:51.309
look also at the entrance
vestibule.

00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:53.760
This is another one of these
narthexes,

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.239
this cross--this transverse
vestibule,

00:38:57.239 --> 00:38:59.260
in this case with apses on
either end,

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:04.960
that is characteristic of these
early fourth-century A.D.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.442
Roman, pagan Roman buildings,
but is going to become a

00:39:08.442 --> 00:39:10.940
hallmark of Christian
architecture,

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.885
not only basilican
architecture,

00:39:12.885 --> 00:39:15.710
that is churches in the form of
basilicas,

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:22.179
but small religious structures
that are circular in general

00:39:22.179 --> 00:39:22.960
plan.
 

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.588
So a very interesting plan in
that regard, and a very

00:39:26.588 --> 00:39:30.079
innovative plan in the early
fourth century A.D.

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:31.389
The building is still preserved.
 

00:39:31.389 --> 00:39:32.610
I can show it to you.
 

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.943
I can show you the outside,
as well as some details of the

00:39:35.943 --> 00:39:38.400
inside of the building,
as you see here.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.563
It was made out of concrete,
faced with brick,

00:39:41.563 --> 00:39:43.250
as I mentioned before.
 

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:47.070
We are looking at the interior,
up toward the dome.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.239
You can see something very
interesting here,

00:39:50.239 --> 00:39:55.239
which is the addition of
ribbed--of bricks to create ribs

00:39:55.239 --> 00:39:58.755
in the dome,
to give it something of a sense

00:39:58.755 --> 00:40:02.240
of a segmented dome,
which is a building technique

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.590
that we see sometimes in late
Roman architecture.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:08.384
And you can also see--although
it looks like it has an

00:40:08.384 --> 00:40:10.757
oculus,
that's just because most of the

00:40:10.757 --> 00:40:12.907
roof has fallen in;
it did not have an

00:40:12.907 --> 00:40:13.690
oculus.
 

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.655
Instead the lighting was
provided through these

00:40:16.655 --> 00:40:20.268
round-headed windows that we
see, very large round-headed

00:40:20.268 --> 00:40:22.590
windows at the base of the dome.
 

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:28.010
So again this move away,
in late antiquity,

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.681
from the oculus to using
these very large round-headed

00:40:30.681 --> 00:40:32.820
windows to light the interior of
the building.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.719
And this is a view of the
so-called Temple of Minerva

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:38.173
Medica as it looks today,
from the outside,

00:40:38.173 --> 00:40:41.070
where you can see those same
round-headed buildings ,

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.300
where you can see those same
sort of piers,

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.449
that are not so different from
the ones that we saw at Trier,

00:40:47.449 --> 00:40:51.900
used rather than columns to
decorate the structure.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.429
A large round-headed doorway
down here.

00:40:55.429 --> 00:40:58.958
You can see the scale--this is
a pretty big pavilion in a

00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:02.800
garden--you can see its scale in
relationship to the cars that

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.809
surround it.
 

00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:08.050
So continued innovation in
round architecture under

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:12.123
Constantine the Great,
and a building type that is

00:41:12.123 --> 00:41:16.030
going to have a long history in
the Medieval period,

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.320
in the Byzantine period,
and well beyond.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.949
I show you just one example of
the impact that it had on later

00:41:22.949 --> 00:41:24.619
church architecture.
 

00:41:24.619 --> 00:41:29.215
This is the Church of San
Vitale, a very famous church in

00:41:29.215 --> 00:41:32.498
Ravenna, in Italy,
that honors Justinian,

00:41:32.498 --> 00:41:35.699
the famous Justinian,
and Theodora.

00:41:35.699 --> 00:41:37.739
It was built in the sixth
century A.D.

00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:41.038
And I think you can see by
looking at a view of the

00:41:41.038 --> 00:41:43.670
exterior plan,
and also a view of the

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:47.380
interior, how important
architectural experiments under

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.365
the Romans were for buildings
like this: the massing of the

00:41:51.365 --> 00:41:53.025
outside;
the geometry,

00:41:53.025 --> 00:41:55.730
the interest in geometry;
simple forms;

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.940
round-headed windows.
 

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.858
So similar to the aesthetic
that we saw in the Curia or in

00:42:00.858 --> 00:42:02.510
the Basilica at Trier.
 

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:06.463
The plan above,
in this case an octagon with a

00:42:06.463 --> 00:42:09.889
central area,
with radiating alcoves;

00:42:09.889 --> 00:42:13.108
very similar to the sorts of
things that we see,

00:42:13.108 --> 00:42:16.737
not just in the Domus Aurea,
but also in the Temple of

00:42:16.737 --> 00:42:18.039
Minerva Medica.
 

00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:20.313
And you can see the narthex
here, just as we saw it in the

00:42:20.313 --> 00:42:21.389
Temple of Minerva Medica.
 

00:42:21.389 --> 00:42:23.280
And you can see in this view of
the interior,

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.157
for example,
the triple arches on top of the

00:42:27.157 --> 00:42:30.563
two columns --
all of these motifs taken over

00:42:30.563 --> 00:42:35.344
clearly from Roman architecture,
ancient Roman architecture,

00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:40.360
and exploited in the Medieval
and Byzantine periods.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.226
The single most important
building that I am going to show

00:42:44.226 --> 00:42:47.619
you today is the one that I want
to turn to now.

00:42:47.619 --> 00:42:50.905
And this is the so-called
Basilica Nova,

00:42:50.905 --> 00:42:54.530
or the Basilica of
Maxentius-Constantine.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:43:00.648
I can't over-emphasize the
significance of this incredible

00:43:00.648 --> 00:43:01.829
building.
 

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.650
It is a building that
demonstrates to us that

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:08.561
Constantine not only completed
commissions that had been begun

00:43:08.561 --> 00:43:12.114
by his father,
such as the palace at Trier and

00:43:12.114 --> 00:43:15.797
the Porta Nigra,
but also by other Tetrarchs,

00:43:15.797 --> 00:43:19.889
and in this case by his rival,
Maxentius.

00:43:19.889 --> 00:43:22.400
We know that this building was
begun by Maxentius,

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.201
which is why it is sometimes
referred to as the Basilica of

00:43:26.201 --> 00:43:29.820
Maxentius-Constantine,
or more easily the Basilica

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.260
Nova.
 

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:36.760
It was begun by Maxentius in
306 A.D.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.092
When Constantine was victorious
over Maxentius at the Battle of

00:43:41.092 --> 00:43:44.277
the Milvian Bridge,
he took it over and he

00:43:44.277 --> 00:43:48.251
completed it in his own name:
so hence the Basilica of

00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:52.360
Maxentius-Constantine,
or again more easily the

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.710
Basilica Nova.
 

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.809
Now let me show you where it
is, and by so doing it takes us

00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:59.802
back to a Google Earth image
that we've looked at time and

00:43:59.802 --> 00:44:02.010
again in the course of this
semester,

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.331
and I suppose in the last
lecture it's very appropriate to

00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:07.780
go back to this particular
aerial view,

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.769
to remind ourselves of
everything we've covered in the

00:44:10.769 --> 00:44:11.730
center of Rome.
 

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.023
Just reminding you,
of course, the Circus Maximus

00:44:15.023 --> 00:44:17.027
up here,
the Palatine Hill,

00:44:17.027 --> 00:44:20.773
originally, with the huts of
Romulus and later with the

00:44:20.773 --> 00:44:22.300
Palace of Domitian.
 

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:28.679
The Capitoline Hill over here,
as redesigned by Michelangelo.

00:44:28.679 --> 00:44:32.909
The Wedding Cake of Victor
Emmanuel down here.

00:44:32.909 --> 00:44:35.809
The Via dei Fori Imperiali,
the Imperial Fora,

00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:37.550
with the Forum of Trajan.
 

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.449
The area that was built up by
Diocletian,

00:44:40.449 --> 00:44:43.199
or one of the areas,
was the area over here,

00:44:43.199 --> 00:44:47.384
which is where we see the
Curia, which was restored by

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:50.204
Diocletian,
and also the Five Column

00:44:50.204 --> 00:44:52.849
Monument, are located on this
side,

00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:55.659
closest to the Capitoline Hill.
 

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:58.625
But Maxentius was particularly
interested in the area,

00:44:58.625 --> 00:45:01.199
the uppermost area,
closer to the Colosseum.

00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:03.719
If you look right under the
Colosseum,

00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:07.329
you can see the remains of the
Temple of Venus and Roma,

00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:10.090
which we looked at earlier in
the semester --

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:14.407
a Temple of Venus and Roma that
was the Greek import that

00:45:14.407 --> 00:45:18.570
Hadrian built and may have
designed himself in Rome.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.748
And it was that--and I
mentioned this at the time,

00:45:21.748 --> 00:45:25.577
but you may have forgotten by
now--that at the time that the

00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:30.047
building burned down in a fire;
remember that fire of 283 that

00:45:30.047 --> 00:45:34.077
destroyed the Curia also
destroyed part of the Temple of

00:45:34.077 --> 00:45:37.163
Venus and Roma,
and it was rebuilt by

00:45:37.163 --> 00:45:41.099
Maxentius, by Maxentius,
by the Tetrarch Maxentius.

00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:45.985
He rebuilt the Temple of Venus
and Roma, and you'll recall the

00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:50.070
niche that is well preserved
with his rebuilding.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:54.097
So it's not surprising to see
him choosing the location right

00:45:54.097 --> 00:45:57.143
next door,
right underneath the Temple of

00:45:57.143 --> 00:46:00.550
Venus and Roma for his Basilica
Nova in Rome,

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.679
when it begins to be built.
 

00:46:02.679 --> 00:46:05.409
And it still is preserved on
that site today.

00:46:05.409 --> 00:46:08.695
I show you a panorama that
includes the Basilica Nova,

00:46:08.695 --> 00:46:12.168
and you see it right here,
and you can see how very large

00:46:12.168 --> 00:46:13.469
a building it is.
 

00:46:13.469 --> 00:46:16.086
And there are only essentially
three barrel vaults,

00:46:16.086 --> 00:46:18.599
a small part of the building,
still preserved.

00:46:18.599 --> 00:46:21.806
But it gives you a sense of its
scale, when you compare it to

00:46:21.806 --> 00:46:23.730
some of the other structures
here.

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:25.760
But you can see many that we've
studied.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.420
You can see the Temple of
Antoninus and Faustina.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.820
You can see the Arch of
Septimius Severus.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.750
You can see the Curia over here.
 

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:38.711
You can see the Tabularium,
and the Michelangelo palazzo

00:46:38.711 --> 00:46:41.639
that was built into that.
 

00:46:41.639 --> 00:46:44.369
You can see the Victor Emmanuel
Monument over there.

00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:47.179
And you can see on this side
the Arch of Titus,

00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:49.804
the remains of the Temple of
Venus and Roma,

00:46:49.804 --> 00:46:50.659
and so on.
 

00:46:50.659 --> 00:46:54.579
So a very large building in the
midst of an area that Maxentius

00:46:54.579 --> 00:46:57.300
was particularly interested in
restoring.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.329
Here's a view of the Basilica
Nova as it looks today.

00:47:01.329 --> 00:47:04.074
It's taken from the side,
the other side,

00:47:04.074 --> 00:47:06.750
with one's back to the Palatine
Hill.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:10.242
And we can see here that it is
a building made out of

00:47:10.242 --> 00:47:13.869
brick--out of concrete,
excuse me, faced with brick.

00:47:13.869 --> 00:47:17.349
We can see that the artists are
better than ever at

00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:21.663
dematerializing--the architects
and designers--better than ever

00:47:21.663 --> 00:47:23.889
at dematerializing the wall.
 

00:47:23.889 --> 00:47:27.182
They have used very large,
round-headed windows here,

00:47:27.182 --> 00:47:28.260
on two stories.
 

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.030
There's more window than
there's wall.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:35.643
That's how good they've become
at manipulating the brick-faced

00:47:35.643 --> 00:47:40.260
concrete medium--you see it in
this wall over here as well.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.523
And you see these three giant
barrel vaults,

00:47:43.523 --> 00:47:48.380
with soaring vaults -- a very
impressive work of architecture.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:52.797
Let me show you a restored view
of what the Basilica Nova would

00:47:52.797 --> 00:47:56.981
have looked like in its heyday,
and then let me say a little

00:47:56.981 --> 00:48:00.380
bit more about what happens when
Constantine takes over

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.150
construction of this particular
building.

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:06.090
This restored view is very,
very interesting because it

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:08.760
shows us that although this
building was used,

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.079
without question,
as a basilica--that was its

00:48:11.079 --> 00:48:14.280
purpose,
a basilica--we see here that it

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.434
is unlike any basilica that we
have seen in the course of this

00:48:19.434 --> 00:48:20.449
semester.
 

00:48:20.449 --> 00:48:23.746
And I wonder as you look at
this whether you can tell me if

00:48:23.746 --> 00:48:26.760
it's not--it's not built like a
customary basilica;

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.159
it doesn't look like the
Basilica Ulpia in Rome.

00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:31.230
It doesn't look like the
basilica at Trier.

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:34.833
But it does look like what
other kind of building,

00:48:34.833 --> 00:48:39.539
that we've seen time and again
in the course of this semester?

00:48:39.539 --> 00:48:42.331
Look at the vaulting,
look at the barrel vaults on

00:48:42.331 --> 00:48:43.130
either side.
 

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:45.539
Look at the shape of the
windows in the upper tier.

00:48:45.539 --> 00:48:48.856
Look at the shape of the
exterior of the building that is

00:48:48.856 --> 00:48:50.989
created by the choice of
vaulting.

00:48:50.989 --> 00:48:52.579
What does this look like?
 

00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:59.449
If not a basilica?
 

00:48:59.449 --> 00:49:01.070
Someone said a market.
 

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:04.500
Yes which--yes,
who said bath structure?

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.360
That's the answer.
 

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:11.077
Which part of a typical Roman
imperial bath does this look

00:49:11.077 --> 00:49:11.780
like?
 

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.675
The frigidarium;
the frigidarium,

00:49:13.675 --> 00:49:17.094
the frigidarium,
the great large rectangular

00:49:17.094 --> 00:49:21.099
space, with a triple groin
vaulted roof,

00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:24.860
with windows that are usually
divided into three parts,

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.030
on the uppermost part,
and then buttressed by great

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.679
barrel vaulted chambers.
 

00:49:29.679 --> 00:49:32.706
This is a basilica that is
built in the form of a

00:49:32.706 --> 00:49:34.030
frigidarium.
 

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.190
That's an awfully creative
thing to do.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.420
It shows us once again this
interest in the

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.550
interchangeability of form;
that you can take a plan that

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:44.789
was used for one kind of
building and use it for another,

00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:46.980
as they have done so
effectively here,

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.929
using a frigidarium plan
for a basilica,

00:49:50.929 --> 00:49:54.996
and capitalizing on that,
to make it work in this

00:49:54.996 --> 00:49:56.860
environment as well.
 

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.280
So some very creative minds I
think at work in the time of

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.860
Maxentius and in the time of
Constantine.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.869
When the building was first
designed for Maxentius,

00:50:04.869 --> 00:50:09.797
the idea was to have the
entranceway on the eastern part

00:50:09.797 --> 00:50:12.625
of the building--
the eastern part of the

00:50:12.625 --> 00:50:14.974
building, the part of the
building that faces the

00:50:14.974 --> 00:50:18.360
Colosseum--
and to enter into it that way,

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.050
and to have the main apse be
over here,

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:25.969
on the western end of the
structure,

00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:28.987
to give it a longitudinal
focus, and the kind of focus one

00:50:28.987 --> 00:50:31.690
would have seen in a typical
frigidarium,

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:33.780
as well as in a typical
basilica.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.391
Constantine comes in,
takes it over,

00:50:36.391 --> 00:50:40.050
and decides he wants to change
the orientation.

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.900
He wants the entranceway not to
be closest to the Colosseum,

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.929
but rather to the Roman Forum,
and to the Sacred Way,

00:50:46.929 --> 00:50:49.282
and to the Velia,
which is the part on which this

00:50:49.282 --> 00:50:51.610
was built,
to the Arch of Titus.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:56.050
And he instructs his architects
to change the orientation from

00:50:56.050 --> 00:51:00.199
an east-west orientation to a
north-south orientation,

00:51:00.199 --> 00:51:03.409
and to place the entranceway on
the Forum side,

00:51:03.409 --> 00:51:05.550
on the south.
 

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:08.059
He also instructs them to put
four columns here,

00:51:08.059 --> 00:51:10.699
and these columns are made out
of porphyry,

00:51:10.699 --> 00:51:14.121
that purplish stone that's
quarried in Egypt and that was

00:51:14.121 --> 00:51:16.690
used so extensively for
Tetrarchic art,

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:19.369
Tetrachic portraiture;
we see that here.

00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:22.827
Then he's very tempted to
change the orientation of the

00:51:22.827 --> 00:51:25.039
niche;
instead of to put his portrait,

00:51:25.039 --> 00:51:28.003
as Maxentius--Maxentius
intended to put his portrait in

00:51:28.003 --> 00:51:30.911
this--his own portrait,
that is, of Maxentius--in this

00:51:30.911 --> 00:51:31.460
apse.
 

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:36.253
Constantine was probably
tempted to put his own portrait

00:51:36.253 --> 00:51:39.423
in this apse over here,
on the northern side,

00:51:39.423 --> 00:51:42.050
so that it would be the first
thing that you saw when you came

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:42.309
in.
 

00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:46.081
But he resisted that temptation
and decided to leave--or to

00:51:46.081 --> 00:51:49.202
place a seated portrait of
himself in this niche,

00:51:49.202 --> 00:51:51.869
leave it where Maxentius
intended it.

00:51:51.869 --> 00:51:55.880
So you would have to enter the
building and take an abrupt left

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.239
to see that statue.
 

00:51:57.239 --> 00:52:00.195
But we think--we're not
absolutely sure--we think he may

00:52:00.195 --> 00:52:03.581
also have put another statue of
himself, in this case a standing

00:52:03.581 --> 00:52:04.980
statue, in this niche.
 

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.938
But as we'll see,
there are lots of niches in the

00:52:07.938 --> 00:52:11.206
wall of the northern end,
and we think that there were

00:52:11.206 --> 00:52:13.550
statues of all of his
lieutenants;

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:17.385
the lieutenants that had helped
him win his great battle at the

00:52:17.385 --> 00:52:19.860
Milvian Bridge,
that were located in this

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:20.480
niche.
 

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:25.072
And so he may have been shown
there, surrounded by his most

00:52:25.072 --> 00:52:28.239
worthy and his most loyal
lieutenants.

00:52:28.239 --> 00:52:32.420
And then another statue of him
seated in the niche over here.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:36.014
So we see him--again the most
important thing is he shifts the

00:52:36.014 --> 00:52:36.840
orientation.
 

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.719
Another restored view,
which perhaps--in color--which

00:52:39.719 --> 00:52:42.710
perhaps gives you a better sense
of the majesty of this

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.760
particular building,
in its time.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.380
The entrance,
the Constantinian entranceway,

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.199
through the porphyry columns,
through the doorways,

00:52:50.199 --> 00:52:52.440
into the main body of the
structure --

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.606
the same kind of marble
pavements with maroon and green

00:52:56.606 --> 00:52:58.938
and white,
that we've seen in so many

00:52:58.938 --> 00:53:02.177
other buildings,
used here, marble revetment on

00:53:02.177 --> 00:53:02.949
the wall.
 

00:53:02.949 --> 00:53:05.748
You can get a sense of the
groin vaults and the way in

00:53:05.748 --> 00:53:08.916
which they were probably also
decorated, either with painting

00:53:08.916 --> 00:53:10.869
and stucco, or maybe even
mosaic.

00:53:10.869 --> 00:53:14.329
The great coffered ceilings of
the barrel vaults.

00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:17.289
And look at the way in which
they've created a lateral

00:53:17.289 --> 00:53:19.097
entrance,
arched entranceways,

00:53:19.097 --> 00:53:22.067
in each of these piers,
to create a greater flow of

00:53:22.067 --> 00:53:25.619
space, just as you would see in
a typical frigidarium.

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:29.505
And then again this opening up,
this very impressive opening up

00:53:29.505 --> 00:53:32.507
of the walls,
with these exceedingly large

00:53:32.507 --> 00:53:36.862
round-headed windows that allow
again light to stream into the

00:53:36.862 --> 00:53:37.789
structure.
 

00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:40.659
A real tour de force of Roman
architecture;

00:53:40.659 --> 00:53:44.032
in my opinion,
one of the greatest buildings

00:53:44.032 --> 00:53:46.619
ever built by Roman architects.
 

00:53:46.619 --> 00:53:49.097
Believe it or not,
we have the portrait of

00:53:49.097 --> 00:53:52.452
Constantine still preserved,
and I can show it to you,

00:53:52.452 --> 00:53:54.469
or least bits and pieces of it
--

00:53:54.469 --> 00:53:56.539
a fairly significant number of
bits and pieces,

00:53:56.539 --> 00:53:59.000
including the head,
which I show you here,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.030
which is now on view in the
courtyard of the Conservatori

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.771
Palace,
one of the palaces on the

00:54:05.771 --> 00:54:10.300
Capitoline Hill that belongs to
the Capitoline Museums.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.697
We see Constantine here,
and you can see how similar he

00:54:13.697 --> 00:54:16.907
is to that transformed portrait
that showed him as a

00:54:16.907 --> 00:54:20.619
neo-Augustus with a neo-Trajanic
hairstyle: beardless,

00:54:20.619 --> 00:54:24.030
very clean shaven,
very large eyes,

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:28.559
but very much in the mode of
the earlier emperors,

00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:33.034
Augustus and Trajan,
rather than in the mode of the

00:54:33.034 --> 00:54:34.110
Tetrarchs.
 

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.942
And yet a very abstract,
geometric image,

00:54:36.942 --> 00:54:40.695
very much in keeping with
Tetrarchic and Constantinian

00:54:40.695 --> 00:54:44.449
art, in that regard,
and truly colossal in scale.

00:54:44.449 --> 00:54:48.309
We have a lot of the body parts
that are also preserved in that

00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:50.876
same courtyard,
from this same statue,

00:54:50.876 --> 00:54:53.990
including the shin of the leg,
from the knee down,

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.925
the knee itself,
and the way in which the knee

00:54:56.925 --> 00:55:00.059
is depicted tells us that the
knee was bent,

00:55:00.059 --> 00:55:04.476
and that consequently this did
indeed come from a seated statue

00:55:04.476 --> 00:55:07.213
of Constantine,
that statue that would have

00:55:07.213 --> 00:55:08.829
been in that left-hand niche.
 

00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:12.802
We also see the famous hand
from the statue,

00:55:12.802 --> 00:55:15.389
as well as part of an arm.
 

00:55:15.389 --> 00:55:18.813
And the arm is very impressive,
because if you look at it

00:55:18.813 --> 00:55:22.360
carefully you will see that the
musculature is very clearly

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.289
delineated,
and you can even see the veins

00:55:25.289 --> 00:55:27.760
of the arm showing through the
skin,

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:31.768
which shows you how adept
artists still were during this

00:55:31.768 --> 00:55:32.789
time period.
 

00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:35.771
These are right out in the
courtyard of the Conservatori

00:55:35.771 --> 00:55:36.260
Palace.
 

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.983
Everybody--there's no tourist,
with a camera,

00:55:38.983 --> 00:55:42.820
who goes by here without taking
a photograph in front of it;

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:43.860
including yours truly.
 

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.590
I've done that.
 

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:48.070
I'm absolutely incapable--it's
hard to say it--

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:51.514
I'm totally incapable of going
into this piazza and not taking

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:54.005
a picture,
either of whomever I'm with,

00:55:54.005 --> 00:55:57.039
or them of me,
and I have tons of these from

00:55:57.039 --> 00:56:00.119
years and years of posing in
front of this.

00:56:00.119 --> 00:56:02.233
It's a pretty good
Mediterranean tan,

00:56:02.233 --> 00:56:03.820
I must say, on this side.
 

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:08.940
But posing with these hands and
feet and so on.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.875
This is my son,
Alex, posing on the foot,

00:56:12.875 --> 00:56:15.039
as you can see here.
 

00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:19.730
So one can't--and you can only
imagine.

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:23.050
I imitate the exact gesture up
there, in this image.

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:27.789
But you can only imagine the
kinds of photographs that are

00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:32.280
taken in front of that hand,
as tourists have to do.

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.411
You can find these actually if
you go on Google Image,

00:56:35.411 --> 00:56:38.250
and you can find them quite
readily out there.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:43.643
So if you do go--this is one of
those other places that I hope

00:56:43.643 --> 00:56:48.860
if any of you travel there and
inspiration so moves you,

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.769
to take a picture of yourself
and send it to me;

00:56:50.769 --> 00:56:51.949
I'd love to see it.
 

00:56:51.949 --> 00:56:53.786
At any rate,
if you put all of those pieces

00:56:53.786 --> 00:56:56.016
together--and there are actually
two feet preserved,

00:56:56.016 --> 00:56:57.460
two feet; the shin;
the knee;

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.360
part of the chest,
which we also have;

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:02.199
that arm that I showed you,
the hand, the infamous hand;

00:57:02.199 --> 00:57:04.679
and the head of Constantine.
 

00:57:04.679 --> 00:57:06.989
This is what you get:
a seated statue,

00:57:06.989 --> 00:57:08.949
thirty feet tall--you've got a
big building,

00:57:08.949 --> 00:57:11.309
you need a big statue--thirty
feet tall,

00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:15.958
that sat in the main niche,
that niche to the left as you

00:57:15.958 --> 00:57:20.771
entered into the Basilica of
Maxentius-Constantine from the

00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:22.099
Roman Forum.
 

00:57:22.099 --> 00:57:25.960
Here's another picture of me,
although you can barely see me.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.860
This was taken--it's amazing
that I was able to take this

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.139
picture at one point,
with no one else in it,

00:57:31.139 --> 00:57:33.420
because the Forum is usually so
crowded.

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:37.795
But here I'm standing with my
back to us, looking at the

00:57:37.795 --> 00:57:39.070
Basilica Nova.
 

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:43.615
And you can see how vast the
great barrel vaults of the

00:57:43.615 --> 00:57:45.300
Basilica Nova are.
 

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:49.987
There are scholars who argue
that Roman architecture declined

00:57:49.987 --> 00:57:53.208
in late antiquity;
and not only architecture but

00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:55.039
painting and sculpture as well.
 

00:57:55.039 --> 00:57:58.768
And one could make an argument,
I believe, that Roman painting

00:57:58.768 --> 00:58:00.480
and sculpture did decline.
 

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.070
I'm not saying I necessarily
agree that they did,

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:06.041
because art can sometimes
change for reasons that have to

00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:09.172
do with trying to articulate a
different message than you've

00:58:09.172 --> 00:58:12.326
tried to articulate before,
and a new style may be more

00:58:12.326 --> 00:58:15.561
appropriate for that than the
style that you've been using up

00:58:15.561 --> 00:58:16.480
to that point.
 

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:20.476
So I think it's a very complex
matter when you think about

00:58:20.476 --> 00:58:22.579
whether art declines or not.
 

00:58:22.579 --> 00:58:25.757
But I will go so far as to say,
without going into it in great

00:58:25.757 --> 00:58:27.422
detail,
although I'll say a little bit

00:58:27.422 --> 00:58:29.494
more about it momentarily,
when we look at the Arch of

00:58:29.494 --> 00:58:29.980
Constantine.
 

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.393
But without saying whether I
believe that Roman sculpture or

00:58:33.393 --> 00:58:36.434
painting declines,
I want to say categorically

00:58:36.434 --> 00:58:40.219
that I do not believe that Roman
architecture declines.

00:58:40.219 --> 00:58:43.190
And I think a building like
this is a case in point.

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:45.878
This, in my opinion,
is again one of the greatest

00:58:45.878 --> 00:58:46.550
buildings.
 

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:48.230
If you compare this to the
Colosseum,

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:51.289
if you compare this even to the
sacred Pantheon,

00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:54.396
if you compare this to some of
the bath buildings that we've

00:58:54.396 --> 00:58:56.739
talked about,
as impressive as they are,

00:58:56.739 --> 00:59:00.300
I think this takes its place,
the Basilica Nova takes its

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:04.364
place among the most impressive
works of architecture that were

00:59:04.364 --> 00:59:06.199
left to us by the Romans.
 

00:59:06.199 --> 00:59:09.289
And I think you can see what I
mean, just by looking at this

00:59:09.289 --> 00:59:09.710
image.
 

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:13.411
Because to still be able to
create these kinds of soaring

00:59:13.411 --> 00:59:16.695
vaults out of concrete,
to face them with brick,

00:59:16.695 --> 00:59:20.157
to create windows that are
large enough to essentially

00:59:20.157 --> 00:59:23.867
dematerialize the wall--
and the building still stands,

00:59:23.867 --> 00:59:26.835
and still stands today--
the soaring vaults,

00:59:26.835 --> 00:59:29.606
those soaring rib vaults,
or groin vaults,

00:59:29.606 --> 00:59:31.860
that we see in the center of
this space,

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:35.164
to do that at this kind of
scale is an incredible

00:59:35.164 --> 00:59:36.610
architectural feat.
 

00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:39.219
I don't think there's any way
that one can say that

00:59:39.219 --> 00:59:42.349
architecture declines during
this period, when one looks at a

00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:43.550
building like this.
 

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:46.300
And also keep in mind how
creative they've been,

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:50.166
that at this point in time
they've decided to create a

00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:53.670
basilica in the form of a
frigidarium,

00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:55.920
from a typical imperial bath.
 

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.949
That's a very creative thing to
do,

00:59:57.949 --> 01:00:00.536
and I think it couldn't have
happened were it not that

01:00:00.536 --> 01:00:03.199
architects--
that creative juices were not

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:06.818
continuing to flow for
architects and artisans working

01:00:06.818 --> 01:00:10.777
on major projects like these in
the time of Constantine the

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:11.530
Great.
 

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:15.239
I want to turn from the
Basilica Nova to the Arch of

01:00:15.239 --> 01:00:19.677
Constantine, which is the last
ancient monument that I'm going

01:00:19.677 --> 01:00:21.860
to show you this semester.
 

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:25.728
The Arch of Constantine was
constructed by Constantine to

01:00:25.728 --> 01:00:29.597
celebrate his victory over
Maxentius at the Battle of the

01:00:29.597 --> 01:00:30.909
Milvian Bridge.
 

01:00:30.909 --> 01:00:35.443
We think it was begun in 312
A.D.

01:00:35.443 --> 01:00:39.268
and completed in 315 A.D.
 

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:42.905
It is also possible,
some scholars have suggested

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:46.605
that it's conceivable,
that Maxentius may have begun

01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:49.123
this too,
in the same way that he began

01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:52.686
the Basilica Nova,
and that Constantine took it

01:00:52.686 --> 01:00:57.773
over when he was victorious over
Maxentius at the Battle of the

01:00:57.773 --> 01:00:59.250
Milvian Bridge.
 

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:02.400
We don't know which is the
case, whether it was begun by

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.148
Maxentius and finished by
Constantine, or whether

01:01:05.148 --> 01:01:07.039
Constantine began it himself.
 

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:10.126
I'm more likely to favor the
latter, that Constantine began

01:01:10.126 --> 01:01:10.820
it himself.
 

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.682
But we do not know,
and it's something that you

01:01:12.682 --> 01:01:14.710
should be aware of,
that particular controversy.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:20.422
But it certainly dates to this
time period, to roughly between

01:01:20.422 --> 01:01:22.110
312 and 315 A.D.
 

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:23.800
One of the reasons that we
believe--

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.708
I mean, one of the reasons,
the incontrovertible reason

01:01:26.708 --> 01:01:29.996
that we know that the building
was completed by Constantine is

01:01:29.996 --> 01:01:33.230
the inscription tells us it's a
Constantinian building,

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:36.498
but also there are friezes here
that depict the Battle of the

01:01:36.498 --> 01:01:39.434
Milvian Bridge,
and other battles from that

01:01:39.434 --> 01:01:42.291
war, and show us,
of course, Constantine

01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:44.179
victorious in those scenes.
 

01:01:44.179 --> 01:01:47.913
It is a triple-bayed arch,
very similar in that regard to

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:51.380
the Arch of Septimius Severus in
the Roman Forum,

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.472
and I don't think there's any
question that the general format

01:01:54.472 --> 01:01:57.059
of it is based on the Arch of
Septimius Severus,

01:01:57.059 --> 01:01:58.010
in the Roman Forum.
 

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.300
It too, like the Arch of
Septimius Severus,

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:04.063
is covered with sculpture,
a veritable billboard

01:02:04.063 --> 01:02:08.867
advertising the achievements of
Constantine in this important

01:02:08.867 --> 01:02:10.789
battle, and overall.
 

01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:15.110
But we see that of course
instead of the panels,

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:19.132
the excerpts as I described
them, from the Columns of Trajan

01:02:19.132 --> 01:02:22.813
or Marcus Aurelius that we see
on the Arch of Septimius

01:02:22.813 --> 01:02:25.380
Severus,
we see a very different kind of

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.900
sculptural decoration here.
 

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:31.503
It does cover the entire arch,
and it's interesting primarily

01:02:31.503 --> 01:02:34.420
because some of it is
Constantinian.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:35.952
The parts that are
Constantinian,

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.965
that were carved during the
fourth century,

01:02:37.965 --> 01:02:39.929
are the spandrels with the
victories;

01:02:39.929 --> 01:02:43.594
the spandrels with the river
gods, very much like the Arch of

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:47.079
Trajan at Benevento;
the frieze that encircles all

01:02:47.079 --> 01:02:50.989
sides of the monument,
you can see that frieze here;

01:02:50.989 --> 01:02:54.539
the pedestals of the columns
were also carved in the

01:02:54.539 --> 01:02:58.155
Constantinian period;
and there are two roundels,

01:02:58.155 --> 01:03:01.438
two round frames,
on either short side of the

01:03:01.438 --> 01:03:05.318
Constantinian monument that were
also done during the

01:03:05.318 --> 01:03:07.260
Constantinian period.
 

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.702
But what's particularly
interesting is the fact that all

01:03:10.702 --> 01:03:14.333
the rest of the sculpture was
cobbled together from earlier

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:15.210
monuments.
 

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.025
And it won't surprise you to
hear that they were the

01:03:18.025 --> 01:03:21.206
monuments of the emperor Trajan,
the emperor Hadrian,

01:03:21.206 --> 01:03:23.389
and the emperor Marcus Aurelius
--

01:03:23.389 --> 01:03:27.693
all the men whom Constantine
considered the great emperors of

01:03:27.693 --> 01:03:31.320
the second century A.D.,
the emperors of the second

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.099
century A.D.
 

01:03:32.099 --> 01:03:35.090
with whom he most wanted to
connect himself.

01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:40.320
He inserts sculpture from their
monuments into this monument.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.585
We don't know whether these
were monuments that had fallen

01:03:43.585 --> 01:03:47.079
into disrepair and were lying in
shambles around the city,

01:03:47.079 --> 01:03:51.163
or whether he actually
deliberately took apart earlier

01:03:51.163 --> 01:03:55.940
monuments to extract from them
the fragments that he wanted.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:59.842
Also very interesting is the
fact that in all of these

01:03:59.842 --> 01:04:01.757
scenes,
the scenes that are used from

01:04:01.757 --> 01:04:04.199
earlier monuments,
he replaces the heads of

01:04:04.199 --> 01:04:08.210
Trajan, Hadrian and Marcus
Aurelius with his own portrait.

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:12.889
So he in a sense becomes them
in this arch.

01:04:12.889 --> 01:04:16.161
Let me show you quickly a
diagram, which will give you

01:04:16.161 --> 01:04:18.630
perhaps a better sense of all of
this.

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:21.507
The Trajanic,
the material from the Trajanic

01:04:21.507 --> 01:04:25.389
period includes statues of
Dacians that come from the Forum

01:04:25.389 --> 01:04:28.599
of Trajan in Rome,
as well as from two

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:32.867
panels--four panels in fact;
two that are located on the

01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:36.623
central bay, on either side,
and two that are located on the

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.980
sides on the attic,
in both cases.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:42.005
Hadrian, the roundels,
eight of them on the two long

01:04:42.005 --> 01:04:44.675
sides of the arch,
belong to some lost hunting

01:04:44.675 --> 01:04:46.099
monument of Hadrian.
 

01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:49.567
The panels, the vertical panels
that you see in the attic,

01:04:49.567 --> 01:04:52.730
come from an arch,
a lost Arch of Marcus Aurelius.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:57.880
And, as I've already described,
the bases, the spandrels,

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:03.030
and the frieze all belong to
the Constantinian period.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.219
I want to show you those very,
very quickly.

01:05:05.219 --> 01:05:09.355
A panel on the left-hand side
from the Forum of Trajan,

01:05:09.355 --> 01:05:13.873
representing Trajan returning
to Rome after his victory over

01:05:13.873 --> 01:05:15.099
the Dacians.
 

01:05:15.099 --> 01:05:18.775
We think this was a pedestal,
or a base, a podium,

01:05:18.775 --> 01:05:23.503
for the Temple of Divine Trajan
that was at the end of the forum

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.380
and built by Hadrian.
 

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.713
We see a couple of the Dacians
over here that come from the

01:05:29.713 --> 01:05:32.179
Forum of Trajan,
the second story,

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:34.719
in the main part of the forum.
 

01:05:34.719 --> 01:05:38.615
And then here these vertical
panels that we believe come from

01:05:38.615 --> 01:05:40.760
a lost Arch of Marcus Aurelius.
 

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:43.786
Here we see part of the
Constantinian frieze,

01:05:43.786 --> 01:05:46.331
with Constantine seated,
now headless,

01:05:46.331 --> 01:05:47.570
in the center.
 

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:50.994
Here we see the roundels from a
lost hunting monument,

01:05:50.994 --> 01:05:52.610
we believe, of Hadrian.
 

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:55.210
You can see a dead lion,
for example,

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.150
lying here.
 

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:59.715
Hadrian has returned from the
hunt, but the head of Hadrian

01:05:59.715 --> 01:06:01.989
re-carved as a head of
Constantine.

01:06:01.989 --> 01:06:06.400
Another scene over here:
a sacrifice to Hercules,

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.630
who is floating in the
uppermost part above.

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:13.510
But again the main thing for us
is just that this comes from--

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:17.295
a Hadrianic monument is reused
here so that Constantine can

01:06:17.295 --> 01:06:20.951
associate himself with these
great emperors of the fourth

01:06:20.951 --> 01:06:21.800
century .
 

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.920
Another detail showing you the
Dacians,

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.588
from the Forum of Trajan,
as well as these panels from

01:06:27.588 --> 01:06:30.150
this lost Arch of Marcus
Aurelius,

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:36.590
probably originally dating to
the 170s to 180 A.D.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:39.713
What you see here are the
spandrels, with victories,

01:06:39.713 --> 01:06:43.088
and a victory in the base;
victories triumphant over a

01:06:43.088 --> 01:06:45.239
barbarian, who kneels at her
feet.

01:06:45.239 --> 01:06:47.637
And if you look at these
scenes, if you look at these

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:50.449
very carefully and you compare
them to the little bit of Roman

01:06:50.449 --> 01:06:53.539
sculpture that we've looked at
in the course of this semester--

01:06:53.539 --> 01:06:55.429
think of the Ara Pacis,
for example--

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:58.469
when you think back to that and
you look at these figures,

01:06:58.469 --> 01:07:04.061
one could agree with the
contention that this is not as

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:06.340
good as it once was.
 

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:10.260
If you look at this figure of
the doughy season--

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.360
the boy who's representing a
season down here,

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.755
or this figure of the victory,
who is not depicted with the

01:07:15.755 --> 01:07:19.266
same finesse that we see the
victory writing on the shield on

01:07:19.266 --> 01:07:23.543
the Column of Trajan,
I think a case can be made that

01:07:23.543 --> 01:07:28.610
this is not as well rendered as
it was once upon a time.

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:29.909
You can see that in the river
god;

01:07:29.909 --> 01:07:32.300
and you can definitely see it
in this scene here.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.579
This is a scene from the
Constantinian frieze,

01:07:34.579 --> 01:07:40.449
depicting the siege of the city
of Verona,

01:07:40.449 --> 01:07:43.489
very similar to that siege
scene we saw in the Column of

01:07:43.489 --> 01:07:45.260
Trajan with the battering ram.
 

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.027
And I think you can see,
as you look at these figures,

01:07:48.027 --> 01:07:50.429
they are much more awkward in
their motions.

01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:52.940
Look at these three over here,
with the shields and the

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:53.360
spears.
 

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.623
They are exactly the same as if
they were stamped out of a

01:07:56.623 --> 01:07:57.539
cookie cutter.
 

01:07:57.539 --> 01:08:01.023
You don't see the artist taking
the time to create distinction

01:08:01.023 --> 01:08:03.420
between them,
as you would see on the south

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.820
frieze, for example,
of the Ara Pacis.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:08.030
Again there may be--there's a
different--

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:11.478
they had different thoughts
behind this of what they're

01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:14.166
trying to achieve,
and it may be that this

01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:17.625
different style works better for
what they've been trying to

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:18.270
achieve.
 

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:22.770
We've talked about this move
toward abstraction and toward

01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:24.430
geometry and so on.
 

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:28.810
So it's not that I'm talking
about this in a denigrating way.

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:34.278
I'm saying that it could be
chosen for a different reason

01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:39.649
to--it helps them present their
case in a better way.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:43.298
But I don't--I think it's
undeniable that it isn't as fine

01:08:43.298 --> 01:08:45.538
in quality as what we saw
before.

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:49.935
And we see here this scene of
Constantine on the Rostra in the

01:08:49.935 --> 01:08:52.529
Roman Forum addressing the
people.

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:54.550
He's got the Five Column
Monument behind him.

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:58.460
But look at these statues on
either side; seated statues.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:02.162
We can identify them by their
portraits of Hadrian and of

01:09:02.162 --> 01:09:04.740
Marcus Aurelius,
which I think demonstrates

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.166
without any question--
the head of Constantine is

01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:09.484
gone, but he would have been
represented with his

01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:11.630
neo-Trajanic hairstyle,
in the center,

01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:14.210
flanked by Marcus Aurelius and
by Hadrian.

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:18.206
I think that suggests without
question again that he is

01:09:18.206 --> 01:09:21.210
deliberately--
that he has taken these bits

01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:24.787
and pieces of sculpture from
other monuments in order to

01:09:24.787 --> 01:09:28.819
underscore his relationship to
these great leaders of the pagan

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:29.470
past.
 

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:31.939
And I want to quote from
Bernard Berenson,

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:34.492
the great art historian,
in a book that he wrote called

01:09:34.492 --> 01:09:38.609
The Arch of Constantine,
or the Decline of Form,

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:39.510
in 1954.
 

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:42.435
And I quote him as we look at
another detail from the

01:09:42.435 --> 01:09:45.305
Constantinian frieze:
"These stunted bodies are

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:49.167
swathed in heavy blankets,
or covered with scanty shifts,

01:09:49.167 --> 01:09:52.908
both with the folds of the
drapery as unfunctional,

01:09:52.908 --> 01:09:57.181
as helplessly chiseled,
as ever European art sank to in

01:09:57.181 --> 01:09:59.158
its darkest ages."
 

01:09:59.158 --> 01:10:04.051
So that is a very damning point
of view vis-à-vis this

01:10:04.051 --> 01:10:05.029
sculpture.
 

01:10:05.029 --> 01:10:07.000
But again I think a case can be
made.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.216
But I'd like to say here today
that I don't think the same--I

01:10:10.216 --> 01:10:13.594
want to underscore--that I don't
think the same case can be made

01:10:13.594 --> 01:10:14.720
for architecture.
 

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.590
When you look at the buildings
that we looked at today,

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:21.649
the Basilica at the Palace of
Constantius Chlorus,

01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:25.367
finished by Constantine,
I think you will agree with me

01:10:25.367 --> 01:10:29.132
that this is a great building,
and a great building again

01:10:29.132 --> 01:10:31.399
rooted in the past,
looking to the future.

01:10:31.399 --> 01:10:34.658
When you look at something like
the Tor de'Schiavi,

01:10:34.658 --> 01:10:38.086
which we looked at last time,
a tomb that is based on the

01:10:38.086 --> 01:10:41.029
Pantheon in Rome,
but has the innovation of the

01:10:41.029 --> 01:10:43.460
porthole windows that we talked
about --

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.377
architects still innovating,
still looking to the past but

01:10:46.377 --> 01:10:47.350
still innovating.
 

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:50.652
The great Baths of Diocletian,
on the left,

01:10:50.652 --> 01:10:54.270
and of Constantine,
that we looked at today.

01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:57.350
Huge baths in the imperial
tradition.

01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:00.530
Not very different from the
Baths of Trajan or the Baths of

01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:02.140
Caracalla;
still as great.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.006
They could still build at this
scale, and they continued to

01:11:06.006 --> 01:11:10.073
innovate, exploring new forms
for the caldarium in each

01:11:10.073 --> 01:11:11.340
of these cases.
 

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:14.569
The Minerva Medica that we
talked about today.

01:11:14.569 --> 01:11:16.220
Yes, in the tradition of round
buildings,

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.413
in traditions of the
explorations of Hadrian at his

01:11:19.413 --> 01:11:22.194
villa,
or Rabirius on the Palatine

01:11:22.194 --> 01:11:26.360
Hill, but of a grand scale and
with new innovations:

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.511
the placement of those windows,
those round-headed windows,

01:11:30.511 --> 01:11:33.189
at the base of the dome rather
than the oculus,

01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:35.238
the use of a decagonal plan.
 

01:11:35.238 --> 01:11:38.783
Innovative, new,
things that haven't happened

01:11:38.783 --> 01:11:39.510
before.
 

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:41.609
So they are looking to the past.
 

01:11:41.609 --> 01:11:44.480
They are building as well as
they usually build,

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.170
and they are continuing to add
new things.

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:49.140
When we look at--in fact,
I'm reminded,

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.425
as I think about this,
of the two roundels that were

01:11:52.425 --> 01:11:53.997
put up--
that were added to the

01:11:53.997 --> 01:11:56.641
Arch--that were put up in the--
that were made in the

01:11:56.641 --> 01:11:59.720
Constantinian period for the
Arch of Constantine.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.619
And I show them to you here.
 

01:12:01.619 --> 01:12:06.395
Luna in her chariot;
the moon descending,

01:12:06.395 --> 01:12:10.859
a cupid by her side,
and the personification of the

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:13.449
ocean, Oceanus down below.
 

01:12:13.449 --> 01:12:14.698
Luna descending.
 

01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:17.324
And on the other side Apollo,
the sun god,

01:12:17.324 --> 01:12:20.911
ascending, from the ocean,
his chariot is going up toward

01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:21.680
the sky.
 

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.930
The cupid leads the way with a
torch.

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:28.564
Just as the moon descends and
the sun rises,

01:12:28.564 --> 01:12:31.694
civilizations end,
eras end, and other

01:12:31.694 --> 01:12:35.328
civilizations come to take their
place.

01:12:35.328 --> 01:12:39.157
And what happened at the very
end of ancient Rome is that

01:12:39.157 --> 01:12:41.550
Constantine founds a new
capital.

01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:44.802
He founds the city of
Constantinople as the capital of

01:12:44.802 --> 01:12:45.970
the Roman Empire.
 

01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:53.600
He does that in 324 A.D.,
and he dedicates it as the--

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.565
he dedicates this new city of
Constantinople to the god of the

01:12:59.565 --> 01:13:04.750
Christians on the 11th of May in
330 A.D.; 330 A.D.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:08.652
So Constantinople becomes the
new capital, replaces Rome as

01:13:08.652 --> 01:13:10.939
the capital of the Roman Empire.
 

01:13:10.939 --> 01:13:13.822
This may not have sounded so
amazing at the start,

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:17.409
because we've already seen the
Tetrarchs creating all kinds of

01:13:17.409 --> 01:13:20.162
new capitals;
the creation of a new capital

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:23.430
wasn't that bizarre at this
particular point in time.

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:26.841
But he went on to decorate it
with all kinds of buildings that

01:13:26.841 --> 01:13:28.908
look very much like those in
Rome,

01:13:28.908 --> 01:13:32.743
and in retrospect we know that
that move of the capital from

01:13:32.743 --> 01:13:36.189
Rome to Constantinople signaled
the death of Rome,

01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:39.643
at that particular point in
time, not to be resuscitated

01:13:39.643 --> 01:13:42.279
again until essentially the
Renaissance.

01:13:42.279 --> 01:13:45.743
If we look at some of the
buildings that survive though

01:13:45.743 --> 01:13:48.969
from Constantinople,
we will see that they are based

01:13:48.969 --> 01:13:51.788
so very closely on those of
Rome: the Hippodrome;

01:13:51.788 --> 01:13:55.010
the sculpture at the base of
the obelisk;

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:59.565
the aqueducts of Constantinople;
and of course especially the

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:03.592
famous mosque of Hagia Sophia,
which you see on the left,

01:14:03.592 --> 01:14:06.376
which would have been
inconceivable without the

01:14:06.376 --> 01:14:09.100
architectural innovations of the
Pantheon.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.385
So although we see that the
capital shifts from Rome to

01:14:12.385 --> 01:14:15.760
Constantinople,
that Rome's history at this

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.898
point lies in the future,
when it's going to be revived

01:14:19.898 --> 01:14:22.715
in the Renaissance;
it's going to be looked at

01:14:22.715 --> 01:14:26.318
again in the Baroque period and
into the time of Mussolini and

01:14:26.318 --> 01:14:28.975
even today, when Roman
architecture remains so

01:14:28.975 --> 01:14:29.979
influential.
 

01:14:29.979 --> 01:14:33.628
But although again the argument
can be made that sculpture and

01:14:33.628 --> 01:14:36.381
painting decline,
I think that architecture did

01:14:36.381 --> 01:14:36.859
not.
 

01:14:36.859 --> 01:14:42.597
And the lessons that the Roman
architects provided have lasted

01:14:42.597 --> 01:14:45.899
the test of time,
that they were passed on,

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:49.025
these architectural wonders
were passed on to the Middle

01:14:49.025 --> 01:14:51.930
Ages in the West,
to Byzantium in the eastern

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:54.618
part of the Empire;
that they continued to be

01:14:54.618 --> 01:14:57.512
operative in the Renaissance,
in the Baroque period,

01:14:57.512 --> 01:15:00.578
in the time of Mussolini,
in the time of Richard Meier,

01:15:00.578 --> 01:15:01.600
indeed today.
 

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.872
And I believe that they will
continue to be significant for

01:15:05.872 --> 01:15:08.010
anyone designing buildings.
 

01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:13.092
They will provide an
inspiration for at least the

01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:15.000
next 2672 years.
 

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.341
Thank you very,
very much this semester for

01:15:18.341 --> 01:15:23.197
joining me on what has been a
special adventure this semester,

01:15:23.197 --> 01:15:26.619
and I again want to thank you
for that.

01:15:26.619 --> 01:15:28.439
And that's it.
 

01:15:28.439 --> 01:15:29.539
Thank you.
 

01:15:29.539 --> 01:15:33.300

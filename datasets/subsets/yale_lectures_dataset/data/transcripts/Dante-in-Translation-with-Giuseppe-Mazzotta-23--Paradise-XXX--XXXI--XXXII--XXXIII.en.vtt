00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:08.507
Prof: You may recall
that last time we went over the

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.870
shape of Dante's cosmos,
remember.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.437
And the point there,
one of the points was to show

00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:23.210
that the context of Dante's
experience,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.352
the way he moves,
the tale he's telling about

00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:29.210
this extraordinary experience he
has,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.030
is really the whole cosmos.
 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.003
It's not just one's own town,
one's own place and so on,

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:41.338
it really takes place within
the cosmos and we saw how Dante

00:00:41.338 --> 00:00:43.690
describes that cosmos.
 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.281
He describes it in terms of a
physical and a metaphysical

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.480
principle.
 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.161
That is to say,
all the materiality and the

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:58.720
spirituality of two hemispheres
all placed in one.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.802
The Empyrean is the threshold
and the limit of the physical

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:10.989
cosmos and the way of entering
into the spiritual cosmos.

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:16.760
The challenge he has as a poet
is that to show the relationship

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.390
between the finite and the
infinite,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.745
the way that they are really
disjointed and at the same time

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:24.599
they are not.
 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:28.646
The finite universe can only be
part of the infinite universe

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:32.489
and so he describes how the
infinite enters the finite and

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:34.849
the finite enters the infinite.
 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.694
This is heart of the cantos of
metaphysics which we all

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:42.110
call--which we can call the
cantos of physics and

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.459
metaphysics at the same time.
 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.680
Now, Dante moves straight into
the Empyrean,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.644
he was in the--you remember
into the primo mobile or

00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:56.468
the crystalline heaven,
before that he was in the

00:01:56.468 --> 00:02:00.305
Heaven of the Fixed Stars XXV,
XXVI, XXVII then he moved into

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:06.090
the crystalline;
now he is into the Empyrean.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.120
This is the end of the race for
him;

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.128
it's the end of the journey.
 

00:02:12.128 --> 00:02:18.176
The question will be how he is
going to say farewell to

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:19.408
Beatrice.
 

00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:21.360
There will be a change of the
guard.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.772
Beatrice--the role of Beatrice
as a guide will stop,

00:02:24.772 --> 00:02:27.583
will end with Canto XXX of
Paradise,

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:30.449
quite appropriately;
it's suitable;

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:34.250
she is the woman tied with the
number 30.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.538
She appeared in Canto XXX of
Purgatorio,

00:02:37.538 --> 00:02:41.901
stays on the stage of the poem
for thirty three cantos and now

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.620
she's going to actually
disappear.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.560
He'll realize that she has
disappeared in Canto XXXI.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.170
But there's a change of the
guard because Dante moves from

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.930
Beatrice to a contemplative,
a historical figure all the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.180
time, almost all the time with
Dante,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.860
Bernard of Clairvaux,
who was a famous monk of--

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.912
French monk who stands for--he
has written treatises on

00:03:11.912 --> 00:03:16.060
contemplation and mystical
visions.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.311
So appropriately,
he's the one who will usher and

00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:23.240
pray the Virgin Mary that she
may in turn pray her son,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.563
it's a chain of mediations so
that the beatific vision may be

00:03:28.563 --> 00:03:30.250
granted to Dante.
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.277
That's going to happen with
Canto XXX and we are going to

00:03:33.277 --> 00:03:36.470
find out the difficulties that
Dante has in both seeing,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.949
but above all,
in recalling and recollecting.

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.417
The poem will end up with being
a sort of registering the

00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:48.964
defeat, the unavoidable defeat
of memory and importance of

00:03:48.964 --> 00:03:50.400
forgetfulness.
 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.789
We are going to find in Canto
XXXIII a sort of further twist

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:59.152
to the metaphor of--
you remember in Canto XXXIII of

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:01.292
Purgatorio that I
mentioned to you what has

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:01.860
happening.
 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.033
Dante will go on being immersed
ritually into the River Lethe

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:09.449
and then into River Eunoe.
 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.460
There are two rivers,
one the river of forgetfulness,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.139
the one the river of memory,
of good memory and Dante goes

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.399
on saying that they really
came--

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.709
he was at the point where the
two streams were really

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:25.610
originating from the same
source.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.480
It as if memory and
forgetfulness--first of all,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.627
I equate it with water there in
Canto XXXIII of

00:04:32.627 --> 00:04:35.569
Purgatorio implying the
lability,

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.750
the water has that quality of
flowing,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.839
the fluidity,
the ability of both memory and

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:43.990
forgetfulness.
 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.790
The most important thing is
that they originated from the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.440
same place.
 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.440
It is as if Dante were already
preparing what will move now

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.269
front stage in Paradiso
XXXIII,

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:57.790
namely the notion of a
forgetful memory,

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.230
and the importance of forgetful
memory,

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.055
you have to forget and you have
to remember and somehow the two

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.778
are going to be brought
together.

00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:10.959
It's not a mystical proposition
that he advances;

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.738
it's actually the way of
justifying his poem and we'll

00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:20.427
come to that in some detail
in--when we come to Canto

00:05:20.427 --> 00:05:21.420
XXXIII.
 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.194
What I would emphasize,
though, to move now to Canto

00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:29.560
XXX, Dante's entering into the
Heavenly Jerusalem which is a

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.560
garden and it's a city.
 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.399
It will be described as such,
you will see in--

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:43.079
well, let's turn right now to
these images--

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:49.848
this is really Canto XXX
line--a sequence of images lines

00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:55.410
32-- I'm sorry 110 and
following, page 437,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.172
"I saw," line 112,
"I saw,

00:06:01.172 --> 00:06:05.802
rising above the light all
around in more than a thousand

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:08.613
tiers,
as many of us as have returned

00:06:08.613 --> 00:06:09.870
there above."
 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.379
The Heavenly Jerusalem is first
of all described as a theatre

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.137
and we ought to really think
about it for a moment,

00:06:18.137 --> 00:06:19.189
a theatre.
 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.571
"And if the lowest
rank," that's the image of

00:06:22.571 --> 00:06:25.639
theatre where you have in an
auditorium today,

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.370
tiers, "encloses within it
so great a light,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.485
what is the expense of this
rose in its farthest

00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:36.120
petals?"
 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.970
The second image is that it's
described--to describe this--the

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.468
Heavenly Jerusalem is the rose,
a white rose,

00:06:44.468 --> 00:06:46.060
a mystical rose.
 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.660
I can tell you immediately that
Dante is using the image that

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.190
this is--
it derives straight out of

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.610
thirteenth-century French poem
called,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.925
The Romance of the Rose,
which Dante had translated as a

00:07:01.925 --> 00:07:04.709
young man into a sequence of
sonnets,

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:07.939
part of his experimenting with
poetic forms.

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:11.098
But it's also--it's deeply
altered because The Romance

00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.180
of the Rose,
which is an extraordinary

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.209
satirical poem,
it's a compendium of all

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:19.375
knowledge,
it really has--it deals

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:25.459
with--it's a story of--
about nature and about reason.

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:31.363
The connections between reason
and nature but it's also a story

00:07:31.363 --> 00:07:33.459
with a sexual theme.
 

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:37.637
Dante is clearly taking that
language of The Romance of

00:07:37.637 --> 00:07:40.642
the Rose and literally
spiritualizing,

00:07:40.642 --> 00:07:41.889
reversing it.
 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:46.841
The resonances of the original
poem are still there so that you

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:50.995
are forced to think of the
Heavenly Jerusalem as also

00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:54.750
having some kind of materiality
within it,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.310
so you cannot just say,
well I'm taking that image,

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.733
placing it in a different
context, and hope that the

00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:02.346
original,
the residues,

00:08:02.346 --> 00:08:06.011
the traces of that original
image are going to be completely

00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:06.569
faced.
 

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:10.595
It's part of the strategy of,
once again hinting,

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:15.375
intimating that spirituality
and materiality now are still

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:18.060
going to be converging here.
 

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.264
That's the archaeology,
let's say, of this image of the

00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:22.810
rose.
 

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.086
This continues,
next paragraph,

00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:28.500
"Into the yellow of the
eternal rose,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.966
which expends and rises in
ranks, and exhales odours of

00:08:32.966 --> 00:08:37.019
praise to the Sun that makes
perpetual spring,

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:40.956
Beatrice drew me,
as one who is silent and fain

00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:43.303
would speak,
and she said:

00:08:43.303 --> 00:08:46.986
'Behold how great is the
assembly of the white

00:08:46.986 --> 00:08:50.178
robes!'"
This is a procession,

00:08:50.178 --> 00:08:53.827
a theatrical performance of
sorts, the whole of paradise is

00:08:53.827 --> 00:08:57.614
a theatrical performance,
and whenever we think of

00:08:57.614 --> 00:09:00.076
theatre--now,
let me just reflect a little

00:09:00.076 --> 00:09:00.889
bit on this image.
 

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:04.881
Whenever we think of a theatre,
we understand that it implies

00:09:04.881 --> 00:09:09.073
the reduction of the world to a
spectacle, that's what a theatre

00:09:09.073 --> 00:09:09.538
is.
 

00:09:09.538 --> 00:09:13.231
The world is something to be
seen, it's also an optical

00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:15.722
phenomenon,
or a case, to put it in another

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.583
way,
which really does not do any

00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:20.136
violence on the text,
a question of the

00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:21.330
representation.
 

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.753
The world is a representation
implying that I become the

00:09:24.753 --> 00:09:25.500
spectator.
 

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.928
I am--it's their representation
for me,

00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:32.114
I can really watch this world,
and see it in its whole

00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:35.840
totality just as Dante is seeing
the whole of the universe,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.639
now he can see the whole
totality of the blessed.

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:42.715
This is the whole of the
Heavenly Jerusalem where all the

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.698
blessed will be sitting,
enjoying, acting,

00:09:45.698 --> 00:09:48.320
and spectating at the same
time.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.690
Two or three things that I want
to say here;

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.131
on the one hand,
the theatre is an image of

00:09:54.131 --> 00:09:58.639
multiple perspectives,
that's what a theatre implies.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:01.450
You are sitting there,
I'm standing here,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:06.283
multiple perspectives but Dante
wants to say that he's enjoying

00:10:06.283 --> 00:10:10.433
an overall perspective,
what we call a perspective of

00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:11.240
the whole.
 

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.908
He can see the whole of reality.
 

00:10:13.908 --> 00:10:17.048
He sees the whole expanse of
the horizon of the world.

00:10:17.048 --> 00:10:20.317
In other words,
whatever he's saying about

00:10:20.317 --> 00:10:25.101
himself, it partakes of and it
belongs to the totality of the

00:10:25.101 --> 00:10:25.899
world.
 

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:29.576
He's not seeing something
isolated or disconnected with

00:10:29.576 --> 00:10:31.210
the rest of the world.
 

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:36.389
This is, to him,
what legitimizes a claim to be

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:38.529
a visionary poet.
 

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:43.380
To be truly a visionary poet,
you have to be able to see the

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.625
whole of a reality,
not just like Narcissus your

00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:50.363
own image,
not like someone who is bound

00:10:50.363 --> 00:10:53.720
to one's own perspective,
one's own self.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.022
He sees the whole of the world
and that's really what I think

00:10:58.022 --> 00:11:02.538
is the claim or the implications
of the image of the theatre.

00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:06.414
The text, I think need some
glossing, "Behold how great

00:11:06.414 --> 00:11:09.240
is the assembly of the white
robes."

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.428
A sense of the magnitude of the
spectacle;

00:11:14.428 --> 00:11:18.086
then, "See our city,
how great it is,

00:11:18.086 --> 00:11:19.870
its circuit."
 

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.285
It has been described a littler
earlier as--in terms of a rose

00:11:24.285 --> 00:11:26.674
and a garden,
and now it's a city,

00:11:26.674 --> 00:11:30.149
that's an interesting shift in
Dante's poem.

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:34.029
It's an interesting shift for a
number of reasons because the

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:37.455
whole poem now appears as
literally a journey from the

00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:39.886
wilderness,
not to the garden,

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:43.460
but to a city or to a garden
which is a city.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.884
It is a way of encompassing the
whole movement of the poem

00:11:47.884 --> 00:11:49.980
within these two figures.
 

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.774
This is--it is as if the whole
impulse behind this experience

00:11:54.774 --> 00:11:59.330
of Dante is a reintegration into
what is it he implies.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.038
The place where many other
people are as if--

00:12:02.038 --> 00:12:04.350
I not only seeing the world as
a whole,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.173
I want to be part of this
whole, and the way of being part

00:12:08.173 --> 00:12:10.788
of this whole is this political
poem.

00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:13.009
This city, heavenly city to be
sure,

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:18.475
but it has--the idea of city
always implies some human

00:12:18.475 --> 00:12:23.101
contact,
some human idea of what we call

00:12:23.101 --> 00:12:28.620
usually the polis,
the political reality.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.321
Let me just add something else
which is interesting in terms of

00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:32.278
Dante's imagination.
 

00:12:32.278 --> 00:12:37.940
We have a compression of images
from the pastoral tradition.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.548
The garden and the idea of
city, and we do know that when

00:12:42.548 --> 00:12:46.500
you read pastoral literature you
really have,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.461
usually have this
juxtaposition,

00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:51.700
it's called,
between the urbs which you know

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.077
is--
the term's for the urban now

00:12:56.077 --> 00:13:01.090
for the city from the
rus,

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.230
the rustic, a division between
gardens and cities.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.690
This is the economy on which
pastoral literature,

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.863
eclogues, bucolic,
ideals, idyllic literature is

00:13:13.863 --> 00:13:18.365
usually based on,
on this divergence between the

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:21.090
two modes of the imagination.
 

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.610
I live in the city and then I
want to go down into the villa.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.500
I want to go down to the
country;

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.934
it's as if there were two--a
kind of--almost a hint of a

00:13:32.934 --> 00:13:37.532
schizophrenic existence that you
have with Roman and Greek

00:13:37.532 --> 00:13:38.418
poetry.
 

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:42.836
What Dante's doing is literally
shattering that distance between

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:43.960
the two modes.
 

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.495
In an eschatological
perspective, in a perspective

00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:51.320
which is at the end,
city and garden come together.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.749
It is literally a change,
both in the idea of the city

00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:56.820
and in the idea of the garden.
 

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.620
They are not two divergent
modes of the imaginatio;

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.500
they really cohere within one.
 

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.820
You see what the point is.
 

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.616
The point is that no matter
what Dante is touching with his

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:11.528
imagination,
all the oppositions,

00:14:11.528 --> 00:14:16.211
all systems of contrarieties,
of contrary forms,

00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:20.914
he tries to always bring them
together in a kind of

00:14:20.914 --> 00:14:24.136
concordance,
discordant made concordant

00:14:24.136 --> 00:14:26.450
again, which is the idea of
music.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.720
A kind of a harmonization of
all these oppositions and

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.990
everything that he has--we so
far have been seeing.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.136
But now there is a further
image which sort of complicates

00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:36.908
the problem.
 

00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:42.365
"'See our seats so filled
that few souls are now wanting

00:14:42.365 --> 00:14:46.365
there.'"
This is a kind of line which is

00:14:46.365 --> 00:14:51.730
really strange because it's
implying that for all of us late

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.864
comers there is no room,
there is not even standing room

00:14:55.864 --> 00:14:58.830
there for us--
the places have all been taken,

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.558
almost all been taken.
 

00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:04.370
Very few, the implication is,
are going to be saved.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.822
Then one can make this claim,
it follows, because he really

00:15:09.822 --> 00:15:15.277
believes that this is a kind
of--that he has what we can an

00:15:15.277 --> 00:15:17.440
apocalyptic vision.
 

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.360
That the end of the world is
near, therefore,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.000
he can say only a few seats are
available,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.350
or which is really the way I
think,

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.105
because I don't think that
Dante really has an apocalyptic

00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:29.538
vision.
 

00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:31.365
That is to say,
what I mean by an apocalyptic

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.394
vision,
apocalypse means visionary,

00:15:33.394 --> 00:15:36.245
he is a visionary,
apocalyptic means,

00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:40.658
implies the imminence of the
ending of history.

00:15:40.658 --> 00:15:43.379
I don't think that he has that
idea at all.

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:47.038
A man who keeps thinking as he
does about the renewal or the

00:15:47.038 --> 00:15:50.979
corruption of institutions,
the hope that some intervention

00:15:50.979 --> 00:15:53.928
will come from other human
beings or from--

00:15:53.928 --> 00:15:57.696
of history, a king for
instance, or an intervention

00:15:57.696 --> 00:16:01.962
from the world of grace,
cannot really have a sense of

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:04.889
the imminent consummation of
history.

00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:05.710
You see what I mean?
 

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.750
You wouldn't be worried so much
about renewing the institutions.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.629
This line is to--can be taken
to mean,

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:14.879
and I think has to be taken to
mean,

00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:18.647
is that scene from the
perspective of eternity as he is

00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:20.809
really there are a few seats.
 

00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:21.798
You see what I'm saying?
 

00:16:21.798 --> 00:16:27.152
If you see it in terms of the
totality of time then they are

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:31.960
not--a lot of time has been--has
already passed by.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.998
Then he will continue--a
haunting image I think that sort

00:16:35.998 --> 00:16:39.981
of gives all this talk of this--
my reflections on city,

00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:43.313
whether Dante has an
apocalyptic imagination or not

00:16:43.313 --> 00:16:47.308
an apocalyptic imagination,
look at how this absence,

00:16:47.308 --> 00:16:51.785
"And in that great chair
on which thy eyes are held by

00:16:51.785 --> 00:16:55.105
the crown that is already set
over it,"

00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:58.655
an empty seat,
it's taken, a crown is on it,

00:16:58.655 --> 00:17:02.832
a king is going to be sitting,
that's what I call a haunting

00:17:02.832 --> 00:17:07.166
image of royal absence and royal
presence because you'll see in a

00:17:07.166 --> 00:17:08.588
moment what it is.
 

00:17:08.588 --> 00:17:13.799
"Before thou shalt sup at
these nuptials shall rest the

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:19.098
soul, which shall be imperial
below, of lofty Henry."

00:17:19.098 --> 00:17:22.711
This is the emperor who
actually died in 1313 whom Dante

00:17:22.711 --> 00:17:26.257
was hoping would come down to
Italy from the Holy Roman

00:17:26.257 --> 00:17:30.336
Empire;
come down to Italy to set Italy

00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:31.420
straight.
 

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.692
That is to say,
to placate the violence between

00:17:34.692 --> 00:17:38.095
the cities,
the whole history of Italian

00:17:38.095 --> 00:17:41.104
communes,
but he had died prematurely and

00:17:41.104 --> 00:17:42.769
he's expected in heaven.
 

00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:44.710
You see there is a way in which
the king,

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:49.116
the emperor is beatified,
his seat in heaven is going to

00:17:49.116 --> 00:17:52.455
be assured,
and yet implying that somehow

00:17:52.455 --> 00:17:55.588
the violence in history is going
to be,

00:17:55.588 --> 00:17:58.920
for the time being,
continued and prolonged,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.900
so a political interest,
a political--

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.996
the keeping,
the holding on to Dante's own

00:18:06.996 --> 00:18:12.990
fantasies of political renewals
that gives therefore the sort

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.435
of--
that tempers all views that

00:18:15.435 --> 00:18:18.118
Dante may have,
an apocalyptic imagination.

00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:21.892
"The blind greed that
bewitches you has made you like

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:24.935
the infant,"
etc., and then Dante goes on,

00:18:24.935 --> 00:18:26.788
the other great problem.
 

00:18:26.788 --> 00:18:31.176
The canto ends with a final
denunciation about Simon Magus

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:34.410
and the reference to
Inferno XIX.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.118
Dante's at the height of the
universe,

00:18:37.118 --> 00:18:40.730
he can't forget Simon Magus,
Inferno XIX,

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.788
and Boniface XVIII,
"gets his dues,

00:18:43.788 --> 00:18:47.871
and shall make him of Anagni
go," Boniface XVIII,

00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:49.950
"deeper still."
 

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.723
Remember how they were punished
being upside down in the

00:18:53.723 --> 00:18:56.457
ditches,
and the flames of fire,

00:18:56.457 --> 00:19:00.527
Pentecostal flames of fire,
on the soles of their feet,

00:19:00.527 --> 00:19:03.390
this is the way they have been
twisting around,

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.390
turning around the gift of
prophecy.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.743
Let me just go onto Canto XXXI;
it's really a farewell to

00:19:11.743 --> 00:19:15.944
Beatrice, and I thought that we
expected so much her arrival in

00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:22.686
Canto XXX of Purgatorio;
we should see how the farewell

00:19:22.686 --> 00:19:24.609
takes place.
 

00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:35.170
Canto XXXI, lines 40 and
following,

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.626
page 449, "I who had come
to the divine from the

00:19:39.626 --> 00:19:44.000
human," this is Dante
speaking for himself,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.827
"to the eternal from time,
and from Florence to a people

00:19:48.827 --> 00:19:52.459
just and sane,
with what amazement must I have

00:19:52.459 --> 00:19:53.390
been filled!
 

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.317
Truly between that and the joy
I was content to hear nothing

00:19:57.317 --> 00:19:58.848
and to remain silent.
 

00:19:58.848 --> 00:20:02.085
And like a pilgrim who is
refreshed in the temple of his

00:20:02.085 --> 00:20:05.910
vow as he looks around and hopes
sometime to tell of it again,

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.480
so, taking my way up through
the living light,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.548
I carried my eyes through the
ranks,

00:20:12.548 --> 00:20:17.180
now up, now down,"
he looks around to see whom he

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.859
sees and he actually will go on
listing the number of blessed,

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:24.880
the women and men that he sees.
 

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.618
"I carried my eyes through
the ranks, now up,

00:20:27.618 --> 00:20:29.798
now down and now looking round
again.

00:20:29.798 --> 00:20:34.829
I saw faces,
persuasive to charity,"

00:20:34.829 --> 00:20:39.180
used to charity,
"adorned with Another's

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.990
light,
and with their own smiles."

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:48.588
These blessed are blessed
because they are--there's some

00:20:48.588 --> 00:20:50.509
other in them.
 

00:20:50.509 --> 00:20:54.211
They are themselves and there
is another in them too,

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:57.770
"and with their own
smiles, and every movement

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.480
graced with dignity.
 

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:06.176
Already my glance had taken in
the whole general form of

00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:11.170
Paradise,"
what I called earlier,

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.131
the vision of the whole,
the totality that he manages

00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:16.348
to-- gazes at.
 

00:21:16.348 --> 00:21:18.288
"But had not yet dwelt on
any part of it,

00:21:18.288 --> 00:21:22.452
and I turned with new-kindled
eagerness to question my Lady of

00:21:22.452 --> 00:21:25.730
things in which my mind was in
suspense."

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.986
We have now a revision,
a rehashing,

00:21:28.986 --> 00:21:32.335
if you wish,
of the scene of Virgil's

00:21:32.335 --> 00:21:37.358
disappearance when Beatrice is
just about to come.

00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:41.821
Dante saw all stricken by and
seized by tremor at the

00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:47.057
approaching of Beatrice that he
turns around to try to see and

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:51.519
get comfort from Virgil and
Virgil had vanished.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:56.430
We have now a kind of variant
of that same vanishing act.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.188
"One thing I intended,
and another encountered me:

00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:05.068
I thought to see Beatrice,
and I saw an old man,"

00:22:05.068 --> 00:22:10.219
Bernard of Clairvaux,
the great enemy of the

00:22:10.219 --> 00:22:15.326
so-called of the philosophers,
but I don't want to get into

00:22:15.326 --> 00:22:15.640
that.
 

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.778
"clothed like that
glorious company.

00:22:18.778 --> 00:22:22.109
His eyes and his cheeks were
suffused with a gracious

00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:26.144
gladness, and his aspect was of
such kindness as befits a tender

00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:26.849
father.
 

00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:29.019
And 'Where is she?'
 

00:22:29.019 --> 00:22:32.009
I said in haste;
and he replied:

00:22:32.009 --> 00:22:37.730
'To end thy longing Beatrice
sent me from my place;

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.019
and if thou look up to the
third circle from the highest

00:22:42.019 --> 00:22:46.622
tier thou shall see her again,
in the throne her merits have

00:22:46.622 --> 00:22:48.259
assigned to her.'
 

00:22:48.259 --> 00:22:52.066
Without answering,
I lifted up my eyes and saw her

00:22:52.066 --> 00:22:56.570
where she made for herself a
crown, reflecting from her the

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.970
eternal beams.
 

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.321
From the highest region where
it thunders no mortal eye is so

00:23:01.321 --> 00:23:04.673
far, were it lost in the depth
of the sea, was my sight there

00:23:04.673 --> 00:23:07.448
from Beatrice;
but to me it made no

00:23:07.448 --> 00:23:12.576
difference, for her image came
down to me undimmed by aught

00:23:12.576 --> 00:23:13.548
between.
 

00:23:13.548 --> 00:23:15.930
'O Lady,"
here he goes on now,

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.202
"in whom my hope has its
strength and who didst bear for

00:23:19.202 --> 00:23:21.818
my salvation to leave thy
footprints in Hell,

00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:24.864
of all the things that I have
seen I acknowledge the grace and

00:23:24.864 --> 00:23:27.710
the virtue to be from that power
and from thy goodness.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.910
It is thou who hast drawn me
from bondage into liberty."

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.489
The great theme of liberty that
we have been discussing,

00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:41.567
especially in Purgatory
found also--it's sealed here in

00:23:41.567 --> 00:23:44.400
the presence of Beatrice,
etc.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.868
This is now--he turns to the
faithful Bernard.

00:23:49.868 --> 00:23:56.740
You may remember that Canto
XXIX ended with Beatrice very

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.769
worried that Dante has been
expounding.

00:24:01.769 --> 00:24:04.625
Remember Canto XXVIII,
XXIX there had been the

00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:08.670
exposition about angels,
the exposition about creation,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.390
creation as an act of God's
love,

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:19.798
the ordering and the new ranks
of angelic-- the angelic choir.

00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:25.230
Then Beatrice gets very upset
because the whole issue seemed

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:30.570
to be to her a way of thinking
more about the appearance of

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.529
things rather than the truth of
things.

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:37.730
You remember that she attacks
the human beings on Earth;

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:42.048
they do nothing else than go
after false appearances.

00:24:42.048 --> 00:24:45.565
We are swayed by false
appearances so that the question

00:24:45.565 --> 00:24:48.430
was, what does she mean that the
truth is?

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.740
She was saying let's get back
to some--

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.733
let's bring some kind of sense
of the real back into play in

00:24:54.733 --> 00:24:57.779
all of this,
some sense of the truth value

00:24:57.779 --> 00:25:01.278
what we are saying back into
this representation.

00:25:01.278 --> 00:25:06.051
That was the way Canto XXIX
stopped, with Beatrice

00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:08.778
suspicious of appearances.
 

00:25:08.778 --> 00:25:14.155
Dante now gets into Canto XXX
and XXXI and goes back to the

00:25:14.155 --> 00:25:19.009
question of appearances,
and says to Beatrice that the

00:25:19.009 --> 00:25:24.191
appearance is exactly what--
the image is exactly what he

00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:27.436
has preserved,
that he is going to preserve of

00:25:27.436 --> 00:25:27.700
her.
 

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.660
Two things, therefore,
have to be followed from this.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.420
Are you with me in all of these
issues?

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.068
Dante's saying here,
in the encounter with Beatrice,

00:25:36.068 --> 00:25:39.546
"Without answering,
I lifted my eyes and saw her

00:25:39.546 --> 00:25:44.236
where she made herself a crown,
reflecting from her the eternal

00:25:44.236 --> 00:25:45.250
beams."
 

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.680
This is the language of image
and the language of reflections.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:53.035
What Dante's saying to Beatrice
is that we are always in a world

00:25:53.035 --> 00:25:56.297
of images,
and that somehow the image is

00:25:56.297 --> 00:26:00.525
the locus of the sacredness,
but the image is also has its

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:02.038
own fleeting quality.
 

00:26:02.038 --> 00:26:06.338
The journey of Dante is to go
between the images and the

00:26:06.338 --> 00:26:07.200
essences.
 

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.660
Now he's preparing for the
final leap.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.125
This is to say that Dante's
journey was not a journey to

00:26:14.125 --> 00:26:17.070
Beatrice;
it's going to be a journey to

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.460
God.
 

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:23.316
Beatrice is the stepping stone
for the pilgrim's entering the

00:26:23.316 --> 00:26:26.828
experience of the beatific
vision.

00:26:26.828 --> 00:26:30.788
This is what I want to
emphasize, and in fact,

00:26:30.788 --> 00:26:35.747
Canto XXXI, ends with,
"Like one that

00:26:35.747 --> 00:26:39.680
comes," line 113,
"Like one that comes,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.971
perhaps, from Croatia,
to see our Veronica,"

00:26:43.971 --> 00:26:48.710
Veronica is an allusion to one
of the pious women,

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.500
who during the Calvary ascent
of Jesus,

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.357
is said to have wiped his face
and the face of Jesus remained

00:26:57.357 --> 00:27:01.650
imprinted on her veil and so
that Veronica became--

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.900
it's the name of the woman
Veronica,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.451
but it was also understood in
the whole of Middle Ages as

00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:12.996
vera icona,
this was the kind of phony,

00:27:12.996 --> 00:27:15.990
to be sure etymology given to
the Veronica.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:21.223
It was--Dante's evoking now the
pilgrims who come to--who go to

00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:26.288
Rome from Croatia to see the
true image left imprinted on the

00:27:26.288 --> 00:27:28.400
veil of the Veronica.
 

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.328
This is where Dante himself is.
 

00:27:31.328 --> 00:27:34.803
He is like one of those
pilgrims who is still seeing the

00:27:34.803 --> 00:27:38.719
image but wants to move beyond
images, wants to go and see what

00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:39.920
lies behind it.
 

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.597
The journey of the Divine
Comedy is the journey within

00:27:44.597 --> 00:27:48.185
that in tercets,
between images and essences so

00:27:48.185 --> 00:27:49.200
to speak.
 

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.577
This is Veronica,
"and whose old hunger is

00:27:51.577 --> 00:27:53.708
never satisfied,
but he says within himself,

00:27:53.708 --> 00:27:55.750
as long as it is shown:
'My Lord Jesus Christ,

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.640
very God, was this then your
true semblance?',

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.816
such was I, gazing on the
living charity of him who in

00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:05.969
this world tasted by
contemplation of the

00:28:05.969 --> 00:28:07.230
peace."
 

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:12.973
That's how we can--we are ready
to get into Canto XXXIII which

00:28:12.973 --> 00:28:16.930
is the final canto and the final
vision.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:23.595
Let's see how Dante carries
that off and let me begin with

00:28:23.595 --> 00:28:26.868
saying a couple of things.
 

00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:32.481
There are a number of dramas
that will go--are going to be

00:28:32.481 --> 00:28:35.240
unfolding in Canto XXXIII.
 

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:45.222
The first drama is that of the
pilgrim who wants to see the

00:28:45.222 --> 00:28:50.193
face of God,
wants to see the face of God,

00:28:50.193 --> 00:28:56.740
wants to preserve the wit so
that he can be able to come back

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.680
and retell the story,
tell the story,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.278
write the poem as a witnessing
to the vision he has had.

00:29:05.278 --> 00:29:08.496
So it's a way of thinking about
the relationship between vision

00:29:08.496 --> 00:29:10.778
and language,
if you want to say it in a very

00:29:10.778 --> 00:29:11.608
general way.
 

00:29:11.608 --> 00:29:15.118
How are the two related to each
other?

00:29:15.118 --> 00:29:19.170
The real--the other drama is
how is he going to remember?

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.440
Can he remember?
 

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.970
Number four,
what does he really see?

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.519
These are the number of
problems that he faces.

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:32.838
The poem begins with--Canto
XXXIII begins with a prayer,

00:29:32.838 --> 00:29:37.650
a prayer to the Virgin Mary,
or the Virgin Mother,

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.994
and it's going to be
constructed through a series of

00:29:42.994 --> 00:29:46.973
paradoxes as you can see,
Virgin Mother,

00:29:46.973 --> 00:29:51.115
daughter of your son,
paradox is about time,

00:29:51.115 --> 00:29:58.058
paradox is about all sorts of
reversals of the natural order,

00:29:58.058 --> 00:30:02.704
"lowly and exalted more
than any creature,"

00:30:02.704 --> 00:30:07.259
a way of using paradoxes that
challenge the rational

00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:10.028
understanding of the world.
 

00:30:10.028 --> 00:30:13.881
This is not going to be a
rational representation of what

00:30:13.881 --> 00:30:16.684
Dante will see,
"fixed goal of the eternal

00:30:16.684 --> 00:30:19.325
council,
thou art she who didst so

00:30:19.325 --> 00:30:23.983
ennoble human nature,
that its Maker did not disdain

00:30:23.983 --> 00:30:26.048
to be made its making.
 

00:30:26.048 --> 00:30:30.813
In thy womb,"
Dante goes on now to that motif

00:30:30.813 --> 00:30:36.451
of birth with which we began
talking from Inferno I,

00:30:36.451 --> 00:30:39.269
when we discussed Virgil.
 

00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:44.073
This idea of the beginning,
the idea of a beginning of

00:30:44.073 --> 00:30:49.691
birth as an image of beginning,
and an image of nature becoming

00:30:49.691 --> 00:30:52.712
an event;
the idea of nature becoming a

00:30:52.712 --> 00:30:55.636
historical event,
a possibility of a historical

00:30:55.636 --> 00:30:56.210
event.
 

00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:00.339
"In thy womb was rekindled
the love by whose warmth this

00:31:00.339 --> 00:31:03.162
flower,"
this flower really means the

00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:06.880
whole of the mystical rose that
he has just seen,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:11.641
so the mystical rose begins
in--it's contained in the womb

00:31:11.641 --> 00:31:14.996
of Mary,
"has bloomed thus in the

00:31:14.996 --> 00:31:16.759
eternal peace."
 

00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:24.778
It's another way of making this
idea of--

00:31:24.778 --> 00:31:27.318
I could gloss this image of the
womb as--

00:31:27.318 --> 00:31:31.950
in terms of this is the immense
sphere of the mystic,

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:37.625
within which--the immense
sphere within which the finite

00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:41.960
and the infinite come together
and meet.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.269
The immense sphere,
it's a circle;

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:48.775
the immense sphere whose center
is nowhere, or whose center is

00:31:48.775 --> 00:31:52.098
everywhere, whose circumference
is nowhere.

00:31:52.098 --> 00:31:55.106
That's the way that he is
understanding,

00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:58.808
he's explaining this motif of
the incarnation.

00:31:58.808 --> 00:32:02.074
What is crucial about this
image, I believe,

00:32:02.074 --> 00:32:05.868
is first of all,
the humanization of the divine.

00:32:05.868 --> 00:32:11.048
This is clearly the divine that
becomes divine because it enters

00:32:11.048 --> 00:32:16.230
history and experiences all that
the human beings experience.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.936
The other element that,
I think, that Dante is pushing

00:32:20.936 --> 00:32:26.355
forth is the feminization of the
divine in the sense that here

00:32:26.355 --> 00:32:30.618
the divine has become the child
of a woman,

00:32:30.618 --> 00:32:34.634
and the woman is therefore
part, they subsume this part of

00:32:34.634 --> 00:32:35.618
this divine.
 

00:32:35.618 --> 00:32:38.893
A kind of feminine--I don't
call it feminist because I don't

00:32:38.893 --> 00:32:41.390
really know what that is but the
feminine--

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:46.450
and I don't mean it as in--it's
a true statement I don't know,

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:50.308
but it's a feminine,
a theology of a feminine

00:32:50.308 --> 00:32:51.798
element in God.
 

00:32:51.798 --> 00:32:54.875
"Here thou art for us the
noonday torch of charity,

00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:58.400
and below among mortals thou
art living spring of hope."

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.880
And then the second stylistic
theme here is the repetition,

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.184
the iterative mode,
"Thou, Lady,"

00:33:07.184 --> 00:33:10.717
skip a few lines,
and "Thy loving-kindness

00:33:10.717 --> 00:33:12.984
in thee is mercy,
in thee pity,

00:33:12.984 --> 00:33:16.326
in thee great bounty,
in thee is joined all goodness

00:33:16.326 --> 00:33:17.868
there in any creature."
 

00:33:17.868 --> 00:33:22.800
What is the point of this
iterativeness of--the style of

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.759
repetitions of anaphoric style?
 

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:28.348
I think one of the reasons,
you may think of others,

00:33:28.348 --> 00:33:32.321
but one of the reasons is a
language that is falling upon

00:33:32.321 --> 00:33:35.868
itself as a way of giving
consistency to itself.

00:33:35.868 --> 00:33:41.236
The poem at this point is
really dealing with vanishing

00:33:41.236 --> 00:33:44.400
traces,
things that cannot quite be

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.500
pinpointed or placed within
logical propositions,

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.978
and therefore,
the language becomes

00:33:50.978 --> 00:33:55.279
incantatory as if it were an
effort to create a kind of--

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:59.811
a mood, a sort of--creating a
reality through this mood

00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:02.750
induced through these
iterations.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.410
Then the prayer of Bernard
continues,

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:09.530
"This man,"
and in the pilgrim line 30,

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.594
20, "This man,
who from the nethermost pit of

00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:16.096
the universe to here has seen
one by one the lives of the

00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:18.829
spirits,
now begs of thee by thy grace

00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:22.603
for such power that with his
eyes he may rise still higher

00:34:22.603 --> 00:34:25.867
towards the last salvation;
and I,"

00:34:25.867 --> 00:34:28.320
this is extraordinary.
 

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.579
We are in Paradise,
so far,

00:34:32.579 --> 00:34:36.820
Dante strays so far from the
temptations of mystical writing,

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:41.760
which ends up always evoking
identities,

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.182
representable identities;
Dante distinguishes very

00:34:46.182 --> 00:34:49.409
carefully until the end between
I and he.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:53.922
There are individualities in
this Paradise of Dante's

00:34:53.922 --> 00:34:56.010
imagination,
"And I,"

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.585
this is Bernard,
"who never burned from my

00:34:58.585 --> 00:35:00.820
own vision more than I do for
his."

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:04.128
See the differences,
I and him, "offer to thee

00:35:04.128 --> 00:35:06.920
all my prayers,
and pray that they come not

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.297
short, that by thy prayers thy
wilt disperse for him every

00:35:10.297 --> 00:35:13.972
cloud of his mortality so that
the supreme joy may be disclosed

00:35:13.972 --> 00:35:15.039
to him."
 

00:35:15.039 --> 00:35:17.230
That's the first prayer to the
Virgin.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.351
"This too I pray to thee,
Queen, who canst what thou

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:23.472
wilt, that thou keep his
affections pure after so great a

00:35:23.472 --> 00:35:24.420
vision."
 

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.878
The first danger to the pilgrim
is that he may be losing

00:35:27.878 --> 00:35:29.199
literally his mind.
 

00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:33.851
The vision of God may--a face
may obliterate his powers

00:35:33.851 --> 00:35:39.280
of--this vision may obliterate
the powers and the affections.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.429
"Let thy guardianship
control his human impulses.

00:35:42.429 --> 00:35:45.378
See Beatrice and so many of the
blessed who clasp their hands

00:35:45.378 --> 00:35:46.510
for my prayers."
 

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.800
This is an extraordinary vision.
 

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.681
The whole of the cosmos is
praying for Dante--the pilgrim's

00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:54.280
beatific visions.
 

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.289
"The eyes by God beloved
and reverenced…

00:35:57.289 --> 00:36:00.949
and I, who was drawing near to
the end of all desires."

00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:04.550
I want to emphasize this,
even this language of desire,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:08.429
up to know the poem has
been--can be called literally--

00:36:08.429 --> 00:36:09.929
we've been calling it so many
things,

00:36:09.929 --> 00:36:11.818
a poem of hope,
a poem of peace,

00:36:11.818 --> 00:36:16.387
it's a poem of exile,
and poem of desire and the poem

00:36:16.387 --> 00:36:17.590
of longing.
 

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:21.050
The prayer is the mode of this
longing.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:25.978
Prayer, you address someone you
don't see hoping that you can be

00:36:25.978 --> 00:36:30.592
heard and that your prayer can
be answered is a desire for a

00:36:30.592 --> 00:36:31.610
response.
 

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.960
This is really the mode of
Dante's theology.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.224
At the heart of his theological
universe, there is a sense of

00:36:39.224 --> 00:36:43.559
constant longing and a sense of
being not quite where he wants

00:36:43.559 --> 00:36:44.268
to be.
 

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:47.217
"I who was drawing near to
the end of all desires,"

00:36:47.217 --> 00:36:50.213
I emphasize and I prepare you
in case I would not make a point

00:36:50.213 --> 00:36:50.949
about that.
 

00:36:50.949 --> 00:36:55.576
Very soon the language of Dante
will change from desire to

00:36:55.576 --> 00:36:56.550
enjoyment.
 

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:02.865
He starts getting the sense of
this sweetness and this idea of

00:37:02.865 --> 00:37:06.179
the fullness of his pleasures.
 

00:37:06.179 --> 00:37:10.666
A desire will shift into joy
very soon, "ended perforce

00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:12.719
the ardour of my craving.
 

00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:15.885
Bernard signed to me with a
smile to look upward,

00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:19.250
but already of myself I was
doing what he wished;

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.382
for my sight,
becoming pure,

00:37:21.382 --> 00:37:25.728
was entering more and more
through the beam of the lofty

00:37:25.728 --> 00:37:28.889
light which in itself is
true."

00:37:28.889 --> 00:37:34.483
Now the first defeat;
Dante starts recording the

00:37:34.483 --> 00:37:38.280
forgetfulness of this
experience.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.018
"From that moment,"
first of all,

00:37:41.018 --> 00:37:43.440
"my vision was greater
than our speech,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.670
which fails at such a
sight."

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.440
How are you going to make a
failure become a success?

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.414
How--from the fact that he is
not going to be able to see will

00:37:56.414 --> 00:37:59.349
become somehow a mode of his
own,

00:37:59.349 --> 00:38:02.476
not just a humility because it
would be a success in terms of

00:38:02.476 --> 00:38:06.094
the pilgrim's own humility,
but in terms of the writing of

00:38:06.094 --> 00:38:06.780
the poem.
 

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.833
Now the poem will be a
different way of understanding

00:38:10.833 --> 00:38:12.936
the poem,
not just going to be a

00:38:12.936 --> 00:38:15.110
representation of plentitude of
vision,

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:20.650
but until the end the statement
of a longing for a vision that

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:21.650
may come.
 

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.840
The memory too fails to such
excess.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.416
Excess in Italian is really the
language--I don't know,

00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:30.925
probably English is best,
etymologically it's the same

00:38:30.925 --> 00:38:33.510
thing, but in Italian it's
outrage.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:40.070
Outrage in the sense in which
with resonance that there is

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.851
something too bold and over--
a kind of hyperbolic,

00:38:44.851 --> 00:38:47.739
an overreaching because that's
really what it is.

00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:51.351
An excess is an overreaching,
"Like him that sees in a

00:38:51.351 --> 00:38:54.961
dream and after the dream the
passion wrought by it remains

00:38:54.961 --> 00:38:58.199
and the rest returns not to his
mind, such am I;

00:38:58.199 --> 00:39:03.853
for my vision almost wholly
fades, and still there drops

00:39:03.853 --> 00:39:10.018
within my heart the sweetness
that was born from it."

00:39:10.018 --> 00:39:13.010
That's all he's going to be
left with.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:17.170
This sweetness that gathers in
the chamber of the heart.

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:20.420
This has been a journey of the
heart,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:25.023
because as I have been saying
to you in a number of ways in

00:39:25.023 --> 00:39:29.512
the past few weeks,
is that the journey to God is a

00:39:29.512 --> 00:39:33.179
journey of the mind,
but it's a journey of the heart.

00:39:33.179 --> 00:39:37.041
You have to--you will come to
know God through this idea of

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:37.840
the heart.
 

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.590
But also, you know,
that Dante's clearly punning on

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:45.565
the notion of what memory is,
because to him memory is

00:39:45.565 --> 00:39:48.340
connecting to those with a
heart.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.280
What can I remember?
 

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.380
What can I recall within me?
 

00:39:53.380 --> 00:40:00.007
What is this--the only thing
that memory can retrieve is this

00:40:00.007 --> 00:40:02.768
sweetness of the heart.
 

00:40:02.768 --> 00:40:07.739
Such a--then he continues,
"Thus the snow loses its

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:10.179
imprint in the sun."
 

00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:15.280
The image of the liquefaction
of shapes,

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.914
the loss of shapes,
water that had been

00:40:18.914 --> 00:40:24.588
crystallized just dissolves,
and then an image which brings

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:28.349
us back to the Aeneid,
the third book of the

00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:31.159
Aeneid,
"thus in the wind on the

00:40:31.159 --> 00:40:34.949
light leaves the Sybil's oracle
was lost."

00:40:34.949 --> 00:40:39.371
This is the idea when Aeneas
goes to the Sybil's cave to find

00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:43.760
out about the future,
his future, and as the Sybil

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:49.284
opens the gates the wind comes
and will go on scattering all

00:40:49.284 --> 00:40:52.000
the leaves kept within it.
 

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.639
It's the impossibility of
reading,

00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:58.320
the impossibility of
deciphering the actual leaves,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.670
like sort of messiness and
confusion,

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:04.226
that's exactly the state of
mind in which he seems to find

00:41:04.226 --> 00:41:04.849
himself.
 

00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:08.175
"O Light Supreme,"
Dante now shifts to another

00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:10.594
mode on his own,
and now in a sequence of

00:41:10.594 --> 00:41:11.320
prayers.
 

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:17.581
"O Light Supreme that art
so far exalted above mortal

00:41:17.581 --> 00:41:21.322
conceiving,
grant to my mind again a little

00:41:21.322 --> 00:41:24.434
of what thou appearedst,
and give my tongue,"

00:41:24.434 --> 00:41:28.599
this is the kind of--
the prayer of--this is the

00:41:28.599 --> 00:41:35.083
prayer of that language may,
I am missing a page here--this

00:41:35.083 --> 00:41:40.760
is the prayer that somehow,
language now may triumph over

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.639
him, over the threats of
forgetfulness.

00:41:44.639 --> 00:41:46.579
Forgetfulness threatens him.
 

00:41:46.579 --> 00:41:49.690
Why am I insisting so much?
 

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:53.289
"That it may leave but a
gleam of thy glory to the people

00:41:53.289 --> 00:41:54.469
yet to come."
 

00:41:54.469 --> 00:41:59.481
What Dante is saying is that
his poem is meant for the

00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:04.400
future, that in effect,
he's envisioning a future.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.644
This is not a poem written for
him, it's not a poem written for

00:42:08.644 --> 00:42:12.070
his contemporaries,
it's a positing of a future.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.449
That is to say,
the opening up to,

00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:18.885
and that's what work will do,
a work of art invents and

00:42:18.885 --> 00:42:22.498
prepares a future,
so more than an act of

00:42:22.498 --> 00:42:25.177
remembrance,
and the commemoration,

00:42:25.177 --> 00:42:27.530
the poem will be what we call
it,

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.047
a prolepsis,
a proleptic move,

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:33.260
a movement forward into the
future.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.550
Why do I talk so much about
memory?

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.840
Dante seems to be becoming now
utopian,

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.182
lend me some of your glory,
let me see your glory so that a

00:42:43.182 --> 00:42:46.030
spark of it may be left in my
text,

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.230
so that the future will
understand it and will see,

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:52.190
and some fire can come from
that spark.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:55.230
Now why does then language--his
insistence on memory?

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:59.860
Because that's the answer,
he talks about retrieving the

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:04.657
memory of what he has seen
because the actual constitution

00:43:04.657 --> 00:43:09.063
of his poem,
he can only his write his poem,

00:43:09.063 --> 00:43:14.820
he can only have some authority
for his voice if he remembers

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.739
what he has seen.
 

00:43:16.739 --> 00:43:22.219
In order to ground the poem in
the notion into the vision of

00:43:22.219 --> 00:43:23.590
God,
that therefore,

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.518
will authorize him to say all
of the things he has been saying

00:43:26.518 --> 00:43:30.715
about the living and the dead,
the powerful and the not so

00:43:30.715 --> 00:43:33.092
powerful,
the historical figures and the

00:43:33.092 --> 00:43:36.534
cultural figures of the past,
it's crucial for him to

00:43:36.534 --> 00:43:41.833
remember so that memory becomes
the actual foundation of his

00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:43.449
representation.
 

00:43:43.449 --> 00:43:48.045
He has to bring it back,
give it a presence to what has

00:43:48.045 --> 00:43:50.429
gone on in his experience.
 

00:43:50.429 --> 00:43:51.010
Do you see what I mean?
 

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.639
He's forced to go on
remembering and yet he cannot.

00:43:54.639 --> 00:43:58.389
How is he going to--where does
his authority come from then?

00:43:58.389 --> 00:44:00.831
If he can't remember,
and he says that he can

00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:03.496
remember very little,
only the sweetness that has

00:44:03.496 --> 00:44:06.659
been gathering in his heart,
where does it come from?

00:44:06.659 --> 00:44:10.639
This is the third--fourth
challenge of the poem.

00:44:10.639 --> 00:44:13.021
"I think,"
he continues,

00:44:13.021 --> 00:44:16.989
"from the keenness I
endured of the living ray,

00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:19.755
that I should have been dazzled
if my eyes had been turned from

00:44:19.755 --> 00:44:21.521
it;
and I remember that for this

00:44:21.521 --> 00:44:24.603
cause I was the bolder to
sustain it until I reached with

00:44:24.603 --> 00:44:26.750
my gaze the Infinite
Goodness."

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:31.769
Once again, breaking the
narrative and turning into the

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:36.605
meditative, a prayer,
sort of begging that the divine

00:44:36.605 --> 00:44:40.510
may reveal itself and remain
with him.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.809
"O abounding grace,
by which I dared to fix my look

00:44:43.809 --> 00:44:47.289
on the Eternal Light so long
that I spent all my sight upon

00:44:47.289 --> 00:44:47.710
it.
 

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:48.929
In its depth."
 

00:44:48.929 --> 00:44:51.110
That's what he sees.
 

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:54.320
"I saw that it
contained,"

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.429
the cosmos as a book.
 

00:44:56.429 --> 00:45:00.409
That's it, the whole world I
called it last time,

00:45:00.409 --> 00:45:03.559
a cosmos book,
the cosmos as a book.

00:45:03.559 --> 00:45:06.612
That is to say,
as a parchment maybe,

00:45:06.612 --> 00:45:11.786
but he uses also the image of a
book which is different from a

00:45:11.786 --> 00:45:14.840
volume, the volume is rolled up.
 

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:20.050
The book is the one which we
have a kind of square structure.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.918
The two together,
as a kind of allegory wrapped

00:45:23.918 --> 00:45:24.340
up.
 

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:28.315
"I think I saw…
in its depth I saw that it

00:45:28.315 --> 00:45:30.771
contained,
bound by love in one

00:45:30.771 --> 00:45:34.032
volume,"
now that was the word Dante had

00:45:34.032 --> 00:45:37.590
used for Virgil at the beginning
of the poem.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:43.061
A way to give continuity to his
quest and his questions begins

00:45:43.061 --> 00:45:48.802
with the volume of Virgil's book
and that Virgil's book becomes a

00:45:48.802 --> 00:45:54.003
pre-figuration of the book of
the cosmos that he sees bound

00:45:54.003 --> 00:45:55.349
together.
 

00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:59.409
"That which is scattered
in leaves through the universe,

00:45:59.409 --> 00:46:02.981
substances and accidents and
their relations as it were fused

00:46:02.981 --> 00:46:06.909
together in such a way that what
I tell of it is a simple light.

00:46:06.909 --> 00:46:11.375
I think I saw the universal
form of this complex,"

00:46:11.375 --> 00:46:15.114
of this compound,
"because in telling of it

00:46:15.114 --> 00:46:17.059
I feel my joy expand."
 

00:46:17.059 --> 00:46:21.961
Now is the retrieval of--or
rather the recovery of this

00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:25.047
state of mind,
which is one of joy,

00:46:25.047 --> 00:46:27.500
which excludes absence.
 

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:32.032
Desire has to be replaced by
joy because desire always

00:46:32.032 --> 00:46:33.829
entails an absence.
 

00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:38.400
We long for what we do not
have, at least at that moment.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:43.099
Desire is always tied to an
experience of lacking.

00:46:43.099 --> 00:46:47.471
Joy is tied to an experience of
plentitude of a procession

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:51.304
somehow at this point,
and now another mythological

00:46:51.304 --> 00:46:53.989
figure that I want to focus on.
 

00:46:53.989 --> 00:47:00.121
"A single moment makes for
me deeper oblivion,"

00:47:00.121 --> 00:47:06.143
you see now the dialectics
between memory that fails and

00:47:06.143 --> 00:47:11.045
oblivion does its memory,
and efforts at remembering and

00:47:11.045 --> 00:47:12.659
the reality of forgetfulness.
 

00:47:12.659 --> 00:47:18.840
This was the dialectic between
the two metaphors together,

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:25.800
"A single moment makes for
me deeper oblivion than five and

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:31.657
twenty centuries upon the
enterprise that made Neptune

00:47:31.657 --> 00:47:36.409
wonder at the shadow of the
Argo."

00:47:36.409 --> 00:47:38.670
What an extraordinary image.
 

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:42.364
Single moment,
it's clearly an image to say

00:47:42.364 --> 00:47:47.117
that I forgot more in one
second, so time doesn't exist

00:47:47.117 --> 00:47:47.909
here.
 

00:47:47.909 --> 00:47:52.179
It exists in Dante,
Dante is still being human,

00:47:52.179 --> 00:47:55.659
he stills has time,
time is--at least he can only--

00:47:55.659 --> 00:47:57.949
his life can only be measured
by time,

00:47:57.949 --> 00:48:00.570
but he's in the presence of the
eternal instant,

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.750
but a single instant he says
literally,

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:05.927
I'm just glossing this,
a single instance made me

00:48:05.927 --> 00:48:09.436
forget more than what we have
forgotten in twenty-five

00:48:09.436 --> 00:48:12.550
centuries from the experience of
the Argo,

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.748
allusion to the Argonauts,
another mythological counter to

00:48:16.748 --> 00:48:18.369
Dante's own journey.
 

00:48:18.369 --> 00:48:22.480
They went for the--Jason went
for the golden fleece,

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.719
Dante's going for the beatific
vision,

00:48:25.719 --> 00:48:29.407
another little connection to
Canto I of Paradiso

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:33.300
starts with a reference to the
story of the Argonauts,

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.626
the daring of the Argonauts,
and now Dante is closing the

00:48:37.626 --> 00:48:39.559
circle here once again.
 

00:48:39.559 --> 00:48:42.755
There's a further--something
else that in the story of the

00:48:42.755 --> 00:48:47.934
Argonauts as Dante retrieves it,
is that the guard is now below,

00:48:47.934 --> 00:48:53.202
Neptune is in the depth,
and Dante is now thinking of

00:48:53.202 --> 00:48:58.440
the divine as being also caught
in its own unreachable,

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.510
unfathomable depth,
which is a height,

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.670
but you see there are two
different perspectives.

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:06.077
More importantly,
here Dante sees Neptune

00:49:06.077 --> 00:49:11.362
wondering at the daring of man,
just as Neptune is wondering at

00:49:11.362 --> 00:49:16.456
the daring of the Argonauts;
the implication is that he too

00:49:16.456 --> 00:49:21.110
has had this kind of daring that
the divine, that God may be

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.949
wondering at his own
achievement.

00:49:23.949 --> 00:49:29.884
What is crucial is the change
of perspective from the depth of

00:49:29.884 --> 00:49:34.262
underneath the sea to the depth
up in the sky,

00:49:34.262 --> 00:49:37.960
up in the heavens for Dante's
God.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.094
Then he continues,
"Thus my mind,"

00:49:41.094 --> 00:49:45.760
Dante's so careful--I wish we
had time about this to show you.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.643
I mean I know that there are
some graduate students who may

00:49:49.643 --> 00:49:53.527
want to think about this whole
issue of how Dante's lexicon

00:49:53.527 --> 00:49:56.112
about mind,
intellect, reason,

00:49:56.112 --> 00:50:00.230
he's so carefully calibrated
and differentiated;

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:04.119
mind is the faculty of
visionariness.

00:50:04.119 --> 00:50:11.130
It's also the root word of
measure, as you know;

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:15.351
Latin etymology is--the
medieval minds are always taken

00:50:15.351 --> 00:50:18.400
with the discovery of the root
words.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:24.646
The word measure comes from the
immense, for instance,

00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:28.300
comes from the word for mind.
 

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.592
It is as if he's still keeping
a sense of the measure for

00:50:32.592 --> 00:50:33.360
himself.
 

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.550
He's still aware of his own
particular city.

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:40.849
He's not lost in the immensity
of what's around him,

00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:44.617
"Thus my mind, all rapt,
was gazing, fixed still and

00:50:44.617 --> 00:50:47.099
intent,
and ever enkindled with gazing.

00:50:47.099 --> 00:50:50.465
At that light one becomes such
that it is impossible for him

00:50:50.465 --> 00:50:54.059
ever to consent that he should
turn from it to another sight;

00:50:54.059 --> 00:50:57.280
for the good which is the
object of the will is all

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.858
gathered in it,
and apart from it that is

00:50:59.858 --> 00:51:02.630
defective which there is
perfect."

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.090
Now language fails,
memory fails;

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.018
the second failure is that of
speech.

00:51:08.018 --> 00:51:12.192
"Now my speech will come
more short even or what I

00:51:12.192 --> 00:51:14.820
remember than an infant's."
 

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:19.266
You know that the word infant,
which usually we take that to

00:51:19.266 --> 00:51:23.789
be a child, it literally means
the child who cannot speak.

00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:26.657
You refer;
you use the word infant for

00:51:26.657 --> 00:51:29.704
someone who is pre-,
as it were babbling even,

00:51:29.704 --> 00:51:31.599
that's the infant really.
 

00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:33.666
"Fari,"
in Latin means to speak,

00:51:33.666 --> 00:51:36.739
"And infant's who yet
bathes his tongue at the breast.

00:51:36.739 --> 00:51:40.614
Not that the living light at
which I gazed had more than a

00:51:40.614 --> 00:51:43.275
single aspect--
for it is ever the same as it

00:51:43.275 --> 00:51:45.726
was before--
but that my sight gaining

00:51:45.726 --> 00:51:49.239
strength as I looked,
the one sole appearance,

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:52.559
I myself changing was,
for me, transformed.

00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:56.393
In the profound and clear
ground of the lofty light

00:51:56.393 --> 00:52:00.610
appeared to me,"
that's the vision that he has,

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:06.139
"three circles of three
colours and the same extent,

00:52:06.139 --> 00:52:10.860
and the one seemed reflected by
the other as rainbow by rainbow,

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:14.992
and the third seemed fire
breathed forth equally from the

00:52:14.992 --> 00:52:16.469
one and the other.
 

00:52:16.469 --> 00:52:22.130
O how scant is speech and how
feeble to my conception!"

00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:26.539
It ends with an unavoidable
statement of failure,

00:52:26.539 --> 00:52:30.150
a failure of memory so that the
memory can be forgetful memory,

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:34.824
and the failure of speech
unable to contain the plentitude

00:52:34.824 --> 00:52:36.300
of what he sees.
 

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:41.130
Vision exceeds language,
exceeds speech,

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:45.110
there is more to the text Dante
is saying,

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:50.210
there's more to my experience
of the world than what I can say

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:51.130
in words.
 

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:57.418
There is--not everything is
reducible or containable within

00:52:57.418 --> 00:53:00.889
the syllables of our language.
 

00:53:00.889 --> 00:53:03.893
"This, to what I saw,
is such that it is enough to

00:53:03.893 --> 00:53:04.840
call it little.
 

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.409
O Light Eternal."
 

00:53:06.409 --> 00:53:11.817
Once again, "that alone
abidest us in Thyself,"

00:53:11.817 --> 00:53:16.838
a divine that is now caught
within itself and is self

00:53:16.838 --> 00:53:18.190
contained.
 

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:20.210
Look at this,
"In Thyself alone and

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:22.177
knowest Thyself,
and, known to Thyself,

00:53:22.177 --> 00:53:24.820
and knowing lovest and smiles
on Thyself."

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:29.875
This is the kind of inner and
closure or circularity of the

00:53:29.875 --> 00:53:30.659
divine.
 

00:53:30.659 --> 00:53:37.648
In Italian, I have to read to
you in Italian so you see line

00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:43.454
123--line 125 maybe,
O luce etterna che sola in

00:53:43.454 --> 00:53:45.349
te sidi.
 

00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:49.742
"Sola,"
only you understand yourself,

00:53:49.742 --> 00:53:53.389
t'intendi,
e da te intelletta e intendente

00:53:53.389 --> 00:53:55.380
te ami e arridi!
 

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:59.623
You see how the words keep
repeating and falling on

00:53:59.623 --> 00:54:04.800
themselves to convey the idea of
the self-enclosed nature,

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.159
now there is something that
always escapes,

00:54:09.159 --> 00:54:13.469
a grasp and escapes Dante's.
 

00:54:13.469 --> 00:54:17.222
There's some--for all of the
diffusiveness of God in the

00:54:17.222 --> 00:54:21.248
creation there is an element of
the divine that literally is

00:54:21.248 --> 00:54:25.063
absolutely self-transcendent,
just transcends itself

00:54:25.063 --> 00:54:25.880
completely.
 

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.164
"That circling which,
thus begotten,

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:31.556
appeared in Thee as reflected
light when my eyes dwelt on it

00:54:31.556 --> 00:54:33.255
for a time,
seemed to me,

00:54:33.255 --> 00:54:35.440
within it and in its own
colour,

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.880
painted with our likeness."
 

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:41.853
He sees our own,
as he calls it,

00:54:41.853 --> 00:54:46.342
our effigy line 131,
"nostra

00:54:46.342 --> 00:54:50.829
affige,"
our likeness.

00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:53.585
He doesn't say "my
likeness,"

00:54:53.585 --> 00:54:57.427
it's a poem therefore that at
the end seems to want to

00:54:57.427 --> 00:55:02.139
retrieve the commonality of the
common likeness that we have.

00:55:02.139 --> 00:55:06.168
What he sees is the
incarnation, the human image

00:55:06.168 --> 00:55:09.376
within God,
because in God there is also

00:55:09.376 --> 00:55:13.463
the human since we are--
if you agree with the principle

00:55:13.463 --> 00:55:18.050
that we are creations of God and
the way we were created in His

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:21.130
image,
so therefore there's something

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:24.755
human also within the divine,
and then he continues,

00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:27.552
"Like the geometer who
sets all his mind to the

00:55:27.552 --> 00:55:30.733
squaring of the circle,"
a famous mathematical surd in

00:55:30.733 --> 00:55:34.036
the Middle Ages,
meaning one of the impossible

00:55:34.036 --> 00:55:37.219
paradoxes of how do you square
the circle,

00:55:37.219 --> 00:55:40.219
and the geometers will go on
reflecting on it and that's what

00:55:40.219 --> 00:55:42.010
Dante--
where Dante places himself.

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:48.654
The science of measurement
stumbles against this paradox

00:55:48.654 --> 00:55:52.400
that the geometer--and fails.
 

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.628
"Like the geometer who
sets all his mind to the

00:55:54.628 --> 00:55:57.032
squaring of the circle and for
all his thinking does not

00:55:57.032 --> 00:56:01.300
discover the principle he needs,
such was I at a strange sight.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:05.498
I wished to see how the image
was fitted to the circle and how

00:56:05.498 --> 00:56:09.619
it has its place there;
but my own wings,"

00:56:09.619 --> 00:56:14.646
the flight of the soul,
the wings of the soul,

00:56:14.646 --> 00:56:20.250
the platonic idea that we go on
developing wings,

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:25.800
of the two Eros allows us to
unfold our wings for the sight.

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:31.500
It's also a pun,
I think, on Dante's own name.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.664
We have been talking about,
"were not sufficient for

00:56:34.664 --> 00:56:37.885
that, had not my mind been
smitten by a flash wherein came

00:56:37.885 --> 00:56:38.619
its wish.
 

00:56:38.619 --> 00:56:42.389
Here power failed the high
phantasy."

00:56:42.389 --> 00:56:45.159
How many fantasies are there?
 

00:56:45.159 --> 00:56:46.878
There are three,
the highest form of the

00:56:46.878 --> 00:56:49.010
imagination,
that's what he means that

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:51.190
the--a pretty romantic
distinction,

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:54.889
I mean, coloriage between
imagination and fantasy.

00:56:54.889 --> 00:57:00.268
Dante follows--Dante belongs in
that same line of thinking,

00:57:00.268 --> 00:57:03.000
"But now my desire and
will,

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.409
like a wheel that spins with
even motion,

00:57:06.409 --> 00:57:09.789
were revolved by the Love that
moves the sun and the other

00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:10.619
stars."
 

00:57:10.619 --> 00:57:15.050
That's the end of the poem
which ends exactly the way--with

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:16.960
Dante doing two things.
 

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.922
One seeing the Prime Mover and
understanding the Prime Mover,

00:57:20.922 --> 00:57:24.621
not the way he did at the
beginning of Paradiso I,

00:57:24.621 --> 00:57:25.480
but love.
 

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.849
The definition of God as the
Prime Mover,

00:57:29.849 --> 00:57:31.817
you remember,
seemed to have a limitation for

00:57:31.817 --> 00:57:33.920
Dante as the Prime Mover moves
the universe,

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.989
and somehow then detaches,
disengages himself from it.

00:57:37.989 --> 00:57:42.130
Now Dante sees that primal,
the motion as a motion of love,

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:44.610
the universe as a universe of
love,

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:49.005
but calls the world together
and prevents it from falling

00:57:49.005 --> 00:57:51.360
apart is exactly this power.
 

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.576
Prevents it from chaos,
it's this power called love so

00:57:54.576 --> 00:57:56.639
the whole universe is in motion.
 

00:57:56.639 --> 00:58:01.231
Love that moves the sun and the
other stars, and the only thing

00:58:01.231 --> 00:58:05.599
stable, the only thing that
makes it cohere is this love.

00:58:05.599 --> 00:58:08.981
By using this same language
here of love that moves the sun

00:58:08.981 --> 00:58:11.547
and the other stars,
it's a universe of love,

00:58:11.547 --> 00:58:12.889
we understand that.
 

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:20.300
Dante uses, symmetrically,
the same phrase,

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.329
the stars of the sun and the
other stars in Inferno--

00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:24.936
at the end of Inferno
and at the end of

00:58:24.936 --> 00:58:25.650
Purgatorio.
 

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:29.429
Fair, remember that,
and then now I was cleansed

00:58:29.429 --> 00:58:33.610
enough to come back and look at
the stars, the end of

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.380
Purgatorio.
 

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:39.666
Then now Virgil and I finally
managed to come back and see the

00:58:39.666 --> 00:58:40.230
stars.
 

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:43.442
Now Dante says,
the love that moves the sun and

00:58:43.442 --> 00:58:46.576
the other stars,
what he's really doing is

00:58:46.576 --> 00:58:51.199
placing himself immediately with
this line right back on earth.

00:58:51.199 --> 00:58:53.849
He's here with us looking up at
the stars.

00:58:53.849 --> 00:58:57.233
It's the line that shifts,
allows him to shift from the

00:58:57.233 --> 00:59:01.057
moment of this vision that he
has, a vision that is the vision

00:59:01.057 --> 00:59:03.190
of the incarnation at the end.
 

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:06.784
That is to say his own--our own
likeness, that's all he sees,

00:59:06.784 --> 00:59:10.139
that's all he remembers,
and then comes back to earth.

00:59:10.139 --> 00:59:16.570
But it also means that this
line places Dante exactly in

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:22.768
Inferno I and this is the
story of the poem.

00:59:22.768 --> 00:59:26.105
The story of the poem--we have
been reading the poem as an

00:59:26.105 --> 00:59:29.557
account of an experience of a
pilgrim who goes from the dark

00:59:29.557 --> 00:59:32.659
wood in Inferno I to the
beatific vision,

00:59:32.659 --> 00:59:35.686
whatever he remembers of it,
and then comes back to tell us

00:59:35.686 --> 00:59:36.260
about it.
 

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:39.789
But in effect we are also
discovering in this reading of

00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:42.422
the poem,
is that by the end of the poem

00:59:42.422 --> 00:59:44.773
Dante says,
now my journey starts,

00:59:44.773 --> 00:59:47.369
the real journey was this poem
here.

00:59:47.369 --> 00:59:49.945
We are in a sense,
by that last line,

00:59:49.945 --> 00:59:54.454
caught in the circle of Dante's
telling, in the drama of Dante's

00:59:54.454 --> 00:59:55.170
story.
 

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:58.369
We read the poem which is a
kind of journey for us,

00:59:58.369 --> 01:00:02.349
then we read because we want to
tell our own story,

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:05.619
and then we want to go on
re-reading it once again.

01:00:05.619 --> 01:00:06.590
Do you see what I mean?
 

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:09.338
It's a sort of,
if you wish,

01:00:09.338 --> 01:00:15.039
witty even, way for Dante to
say this poem will hold you,

01:00:15.039 --> 01:00:20.739
and it's meant to hold you,
and I wish it holds you.

01:00:20.739 --> 01:00:24.628
You can see the poem as both a
journey and the telling of the

01:00:24.628 --> 01:00:28.063
journey endlessly like the
movement of the sun and the

01:00:28.063 --> 01:00:29.099
other stars.
 

01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:30.380
This is the end of the poem.
 

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:34.000
Let me see, I'm sure that there
are questions.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.400
I raised some issues and we
have a minute--a few minutes and

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.860
I'll tell you then later what
we're going to do next time.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.389
Please.
 

01:00:49.389 --> 01:00:51.539
Student:  Can you talk
about this line where he's--

01:00:51.539 --> 01:00:59.987
at line 52 [Canto XXXIII],
"Bernard signed to me with

01:00:59.987 --> 01:01:06.509
a smile to look
upward…the lofty light

01:01:06.509 --> 01:01:10.659
which in itself is true.
 

01:01:10.659 --> 01:01:15.487
There are few things going on
here about light and truth and

01:01:15.487 --> 01:01:19.762
I'm wondering--
the light seems to be pure all

01:01:19.762 --> 01:01:24.949
and what's happening is that
Dante's vision becomes--

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:28.887
that the faculty improves
enough to appreciate this and

01:01:28.887 --> 01:01:33.630
that his sight somehow fails and
then he has failure of memory.

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:36.213
I don't know,
light is the truth,

01:01:36.213 --> 01:01:40.976
it no longer illuminates but
isn't very obvious to the truth

01:01:40.976 --> 01:01:42.429
at this point.
 

01:01:42.429 --> 01:01:46.235
I'm not sure it seemed like
there was a lot going on and I'm

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:48.840
not quite--
Prof: Okay,

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.619
the question is in reference to
lines--

01:01:52.619 --> 01:02:00.650
line 52 of Paradiso
XXXIII where Dante says,

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:04.313
"And I who was drawing
near to the end of all

01:02:04.313 --> 01:02:07.079
desires,"
that we understand,

01:02:07.079 --> 01:02:11.139
" ended perforce the
ardour of my craving.

01:02:11.139 --> 01:02:14.755
Bernard signed to me with a
smile to look upward,

01:02:14.755 --> 01:02:19.050
but already of myself I was
doing what he wished;"

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:21.469
that's fairly,
at least literally clear,

01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:25.422
"for my sight,
becoming pure,"

01:02:25.422 --> 01:02:31.429
that's also clear,
Dante's experience in the final

01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:38.063
poems can be reduced to a
refinement of the faculty of

01:02:38.063 --> 01:02:44.030
vision,
physical but also clearly

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:46.050
spiritual.
 

01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:50.030
"Becoming pure was
entering more and more through

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:54.237
the beam of the lofty light
which in itself is true"

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:57.135
meaning that--
I think this means,

01:02:57.135 --> 01:03:00.309
and this is also a footnote of
yours,

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.929
it's the footnote is too the
famous phrase,

01:03:02.929 --> 01:03:06.110
"In thy light we see the
light."

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:13.309
The idea that--you are quite
right that it's not a light that

01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:18.110
reveals an object being a true
object;

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:20.699
that's really what you--the
point that you are making.

01:03:20.699 --> 01:03:23.708
That's absolutely true,
I would agree with that,

01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:27.420
but it's really a statement
about the light which in itself

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.018
is--contains a light.
 

01:03:29.018 --> 01:03:32.789
It's this kind of--that's the
meaning of the biblical phrase,

01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:36.108
"In thy light we see the
light," it's not because of

01:03:36.108 --> 01:03:39.266
your light I see the world,
I see myself or whatever,

01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:41.099
in thy light I see the light.
 

01:03:41.099 --> 01:03:45.170
The light is the light of
truth, that's what he's saying.

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:49.309
It's the light of truth in and
of itself, the light of truth.

01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:50.789
Yes, it's a light in itself.
 

01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:56.690
That was your point or not?
 

01:03:56.690 --> 01:04:01.041
Student:  Kind of,
I'm just a little confused what

01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:03.139
the function of light is.
 

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:04.619
Prof: What the function
of light here?

01:04:04.619 --> 01:04:14.088
Well, the--I can give you a
little bit of the idea of what

01:04:14.088 --> 01:04:23.059
we call the metaphysics of light
in Paradiso.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:30.512
Dante begins with the idea that
what we know of the divine is

01:04:30.512 --> 01:04:34.485
light,
a light that--the power of

01:04:34.485 --> 01:04:40.748
which and the limitation of
which is exactly like the dark

01:04:40.748 --> 01:04:47.010
in the sense that the light
reveals to us the divine,

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:50.699
but at the same time hides the
origin of the light.

01:04:50.699 --> 01:04:52.210
You cannot see through the
light.

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:58.063
That's really the understanding
of Dante in Paradiso I

01:04:58.063 --> 01:05:00.492
saying,
"The glory of Him who

01:05:00.492 --> 01:05:03.340
moves all things,"
the glory is an image really

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.179
means light.
 

01:05:04.179 --> 01:05:07.206
The light of Him,
who moves all things,

01:05:07.206 --> 01:05:09.039
is what I really saw.
 

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:12.802
Now Dante's seeing the origin
of that light,

01:05:12.802 --> 01:05:18.141
that which has remained forever
invisible, exactly the way the

01:05:18.141 --> 01:05:19.280
dark has.
 

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.956
You may say that some of our
imagination is that we are in

01:05:23.956 --> 01:05:24.860
the dark.
 

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.010
We don't know the origins of
anything;

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:32.860
we don't know the causes that
lie beyond our perceptions.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.748
We don't know the origin of the
dark, we may even go like

01:05:36.748 --> 01:05:39.804
mystics believing that the dark
is the image,

01:05:39.804 --> 01:05:41.679
is the cover for light.
 

01:05:41.679 --> 01:05:44.750
If there is a dark there must
be a light somewhere else,

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:47.429
in fact that dark may
occasionally be removed.

01:05:47.429 --> 01:05:51.284
The worst thing about the
mystical language of the divine

01:05:51.284 --> 01:05:54.449
in terms of light is that the
light itself,

01:05:54.449 --> 01:05:57.983
which makes all things visible,
remains in and of itself

01:05:57.983 --> 01:06:00.940
impenetrable in its origin to
the human eye.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.070
Now Dante sees it,
that's the idea of the true

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:07.619
light, "In thy light we see
the light."

01:06:07.619 --> 01:06:10.632
Is that a little--
Student:  The beatific

01:06:10.632 --> 01:06:13.583
vision then is not exactly--
Prof: This is not a

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:14.809
beatific vision.
 

01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:18.101
He has seen a moment of light
and the origin of the light,

01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:19.429
that's still not God.
 

01:06:19.429 --> 01:06:23.114
The beatific--the only thing
that he remembers of the

01:06:23.114 --> 01:06:26.090
beatific vision is some--he
doesn't say.

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:29.054
Some sweetness that has
gathered in his heart,

01:06:29.054 --> 01:06:32.018
and what he then sees beyond
the general form,

01:06:32.018 --> 01:06:34.059
he sees a number of things.
 

01:06:34.059 --> 01:06:37.768
The general form of the cosmos,
which is this conjunction of

01:06:37.768 --> 01:06:40.418
circle and square,
book and volume,

01:06:40.418 --> 01:06:43.909
if you want to visualize it in
terms of--

01:06:43.909 --> 01:06:48.219
I like that image because it
really implies the Word.

01:06:48.219 --> 01:06:52.559
It's the theology of the Word
that seems to come out of that.

01:06:52.559 --> 01:06:55.666
Then the other things that he
sees is our likeness,

01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:59.021
i.e., he sends us back to
Genesis 1, or the creation of

01:06:59.021 --> 01:07:00.699
man as told in Genesis.
 

01:07:00.699 --> 01:07:06.590
"Let me us make man in our
image and likeness,"

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:09.219
so here's our likeness.
 

01:07:09.219 --> 01:07:12.422
You are talking now about the
light and the meaning about this

01:07:12.422 --> 01:07:15.414
light is that the light--what
does it mean to say that the

01:07:15.414 --> 01:07:16.360
light is true?
 

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.119
Not because he reveals and
dissipates the shadows that

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:23.054
would be one way,
one function of the light,

01:07:23.054 --> 01:07:25.550
the like the light,
the light of the mind,

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.400
the light of the sun,
whatever.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.652
Because of that,
the artificial light,

01:07:29.652 --> 01:07:33.246
but there is a way in which
Dante is now thinking about what

01:07:33.246 --> 01:07:35.380
is called metaphysics of light.
 

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.550
What is the light in and of
itself?

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:40.222
The light--Dante by the way,
if you really want to know

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:42.045
this,
Dante distinguishes between the

01:07:42.045 --> 01:07:43.840
word for light and the word for
lamp,

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.581
lume,
luce,

01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:49.349
and so on light,
lamp and so on and a number of

01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:51.340
scientific distinctions.
 

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:56.820
Here he is talking about the
vision of the origin of light,

01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:01.050
"In thy light we see the
light," that's the meaning

01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:02.179
of the phrase.

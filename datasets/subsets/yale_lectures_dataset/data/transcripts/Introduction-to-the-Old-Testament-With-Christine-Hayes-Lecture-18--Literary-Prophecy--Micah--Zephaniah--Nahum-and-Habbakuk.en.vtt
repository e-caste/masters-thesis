00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.111
Professor Christine
Hayes: We were talking last

00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:05.150
time about prophets of the
Assyrian crisis.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.931
We've talked about two of the
northern prophets,

00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:10.477
Amos and Hosea,
and we started talking about

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:13.910
Isaiah who was a southern
prophet, a prophet in Judah;

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.063
and we'll be talking now about
the second southern prophet of

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:18.220
the Assyrian crisis.
 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.020
That is Micah, or Micah.
 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.514
And he is said to come from the
town of Moreshet,

00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:25.060
which is about 25 miles
southwest of Jerusalem.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.611
So he's in Judah,
and he's the last of the

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:29.230
eighth-century prophets.
 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.040
He's quite different from the
city-bred Isaiah.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.170
He seems to have been a rural
prophet who spoke for the poor

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.916
farmers.
Now, he's prophesying in the

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:44.670
second part of the eighth
century, so 740 to about 700.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.220
He's attacking the northern
kingdom, although he's a

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.170
southern prophet.
 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.747
He attacks Israel for
idolatries and says that the

00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:54.960
kingdom will surely fall because
of these.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.835
So he also follows the other
prophets, as we've seen,

00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:00.710
in condemning the people for
their moral failings.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.210
The greedy landowners,
the dishonest merchants,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.493
the aristocracy,
they're all targets of his

00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:08.319
denunciations as are other
leaders: the priests,

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.813
the judges, royalty,
the royal house as well as

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:13.560
other false prophets.
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.172
But the greatest contrast
between Isaiah and Micah--if you

00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:20.658
want to differentiate these two
southern prophets of the

00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:24.144
Assyrian crisis in your
mind--the greatest contrast lies

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:27.440
in his view of the city as
inherently corrupt.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.084
It's inherently sinful;
it's inherently doomed to

00:01:30.084 --> 00:01:32.707
destruction.
Isaiah had preached the

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:37.359
inviolability of Zion and Micah
is sharply critical of the

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.298
Davidic dynasty.
He ridicules the idea of the

00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:43.260
inviolability of Zion.
 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.071
He ridicules the belief that
the presence of the sanctuary in

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.120
Jerusalem somehow protects the
city from harm.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.245
He says, on the contrary,
that God will destroy his city

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.780
and his house if need be.
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.068
Micah 3:9-12:
Hear this,

00:01:58.068 --> 00:01:59.489
you rulers of the House of
Jacob,

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.330
You chiefs of the House of
Israel,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.455
Who detest justice
And make crooked all that is

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:06.700
straight,
Who build Zion with crime,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.210
Jerusalem with iniquity!
 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.362
Her rulers judge for gifts,
Her priests give rulings for a

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:14.830
fee,
And her prophets divine for pay;

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.270
Yet they rely upon the Lord,
saying,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.610
"The Lord is in our midst;
No calamity shall overtake us."

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.780
Assuredly, because of you
Zion shall be plowed as a field,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.900
And Jerusalem shall become
heaps of ruins,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.030
And the Temple Mount
A shrine in the woods.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.243
A stark contrast then between
Isaiah who trusts and has

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:36.516
confidence that God will never
allow His holy city to be

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:39.270
destroyed,
his sanctuary to be destroyed.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.331
His presence in the midst of
the city is a guarantee that it

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.078
will survive.
And Micah says:

00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:46.080
it's no guarantee of anything.
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.436
One of the most famous passages
in the Book of Micah is in

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:52.851
chapter 6--eight verses in
chapter 6--and this is a passage

00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:55.560
that takes the form of a
covenant lawsuit,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.014
which we've talked about
before, and the structure is as

00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:02.092
follows (I've put it up on the
white board there):

00:03:02.092 --> 00:03:05.610
The first two verses are the
issuing of the summons,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.020
the summons to the case.
 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.643
So the prophet here is acting
as God's attorney and he summons

00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:14.148
the accused and he summons the
witnesses--those would be the

00:03:14.148 --> 00:03:16.423
mountains,
who are to hear the case

00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:19.069
against Israel,
God's case against Israel:

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.229
Hear what the Lord is
saying:

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.530
Come, present [My]
case before the mountains,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.590
And let the hills hear you
pleading.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.650
Hear, you mountains,
the case of the Lord--

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.629
You firm foundations of the
earth!

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.405
For the Lord has a case [=a
lawsuit]

00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:32.825
against His people,
He has a suit against

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:35.504
Israel.
So those are the opening verses

00:03:35.504 --> 00:03:38.595
and in verses 3 to 5 we then
move on to the plaintiff's

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:40.770
charge, God's charge or
accusation.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.090
And this is given,
again, through the attorney.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.468
He appeals to Israel's memory
of all of the events that have

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:50.139
manifested his great love for
her.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.027
That begins with the exodus of
course and continues with the

00:03:53.027 --> 00:03:55.964
entry into the Promised Land and
he says Israel seems to have

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.753
forgotten all of these deeds
that God has performed on her

00:03:58.753 --> 00:04:01.706
behalf,
and the obligations that those

00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:03.560
deeds obviously entail.
 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.879
Israel's conduct in response to
this continuous benevolence on

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.719
God's part is appalling.
 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.050
In verses 6 to 7 you have the
defendant's plea.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.012
This is Israel speaking,
but Israel really,

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:18.410
of course, has no case to
plead.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.324
And Israel knows that her only
choice is to try to effect

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:26.030
reconciliation but she doesn't
know where to begin.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.820
Verses 6-7:
With what shall I

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.620
approach the Lord,
Do homage to God on high?

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.730
Shall I approach Him with burnt
offerings,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.690
With calves a year old?
 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.020
Would the Lord be pleased with
thousands of rams,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.879
With myriads of streams of oil?
 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.319
Shall I give my firstborn for
my transgression,

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.750
The fruit of my body for my
sins?

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.157
And the prophetic
attorney--because the prophet is

00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:52.329
here acting as the attorney--in
verse 8, responds to this.

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:54.620
"He has told you,
O man, what is good,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.130
And what the Lord requires of
you:

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.269
Only to do justice
And to love goodness,

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:01.819
And to walk humbly with your
God." [See note 1]

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.355
And the word that has been
translated here as goodness,

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:05.670
is this word hesed.
 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.098
This is a word that we
discussed last week in relation

00:05:09.098 --> 00:05:12.462
to Hosea, and it's a word that
seems to refer to that

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:16.182
covenantal loyalty,
the loyal love of covenantal

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:19.153
partners.
This is a classic passage that

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:23.211
really typifies the prophetic
emphasis on morality or the

00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:26.399
primacy of morality in prophetic
thought.

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:30.007
The book of Micah itself
structurally alternates three

00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:33.887
prophecies of doom with three
prophecies of restoration or

00:05:33.887 --> 00:05:35.111
hope.
So it's doom,

00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:36.522
restoration,
doom, restoration,

00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:37.509
doom, restoration.
 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.544
These last prophecies tell of
the glory of Zion to come in the

00:05:41.544 --> 00:05:44.456
future.
These restoration passages may

00:05:44.456 --> 00:05:49.088
seem a little out of keeping or
out of step with the scathing

00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:53.721
denunciations or condemnations
of Judah in the other parts of

00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:56.873
Micah's prophecy,
and so some scholars have

00:05:56.873 --> 00:06:00.596
suggested that those restoration
passages and those references to

00:06:00.596 --> 00:06:04.259
God's unconditional promise to
preserve the Davidic kingdom,

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.533
and the optimistic predictions
of universal peace--these must

00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:11.240
be interpolations by a later
editor.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.860
And it's true that certain
parts we see again in Isaiah.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.451
But this is always a very
difficult case or issue,

00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:22.482
because we know that the
prophetic writings do fluctuate

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:26.000
wildly between denunciation and
consolation.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.587
So I think that a shift in
theme alone is not ever a

00:06:29.587 --> 00:06:33.033
certain basis for assuming
interpolation--outright

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:37.184
contradiction perhaps--but a
shift in theme or tone is never

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:40.490
a solid basis for assuming
interpolation.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.529
Anachronism is a very good
guide to interpolation.

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.150
So Micah explicitly refers to
the Babylonian exile,

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.400
of course, and that's going to
be in 586 and he's in the eighth

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.638
century.
He's also going to refer to the

00:06:51.638 --> 00:06:53.610
rebuilding of the walls of
Jerusalem.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.381
The walls of Jerusalem aren't
even destroyed until 586 for

00:06:56.381 --> 00:06:58.569
anyone to even speak about
rebuilding them,

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.674
so those little units or
passages may of course represent

00:07:02.674 --> 00:07:05.019
late editorial interpolations.
 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:09.157
But in its present form--in
that nice structure of

00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:12.257
alternation of denunciation,
restoration,

00:07:12.257 --> 00:07:13.438
denunciation,
restoration,

00:07:13.438 --> 00:07:15.990
a pattern that happens three
times--that structure,

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.347
is I think typical of the
common paradox that we find in

00:07:19.347 --> 00:07:22.949
the prophetic writings where
they try to balance God's stern

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:25.790
judgment on the one hand,
his punishment,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.500
with his merciful love and
salvation of his people.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.921
A further paradox lies in the
very preservation of prophecies

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.690
like Micah's prophecy.
 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.556
These prophecies were probably
preserved by priests in the

00:07:39.556 --> 00:07:43.829
temple, even though priests were
very often among the targets of

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:46.204
the prophets in their
denunciations,

00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:47.899
particularly Micah.
 

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:50.706
Alright, so we've talked about
the prophets who responded to

00:07:50.706 --> 00:07:53.560
the Assyrian crisis towards the
end of the eighth century,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.490
two in the north,
two in the south.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:01.193
Jerusalem survived the siege of
701 when the Assyrians laid

00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:05.388
siege in 701.
And that gave credence to the

00:08:05.388 --> 00:08:09.598
royal ideology,
the idea that God was with

00:08:09.598 --> 00:08:11.250
Zion,
was with Jerusalem,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.740
and was with the House of David
and would preserve them,

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.779
but even so Judah moves into
the next century,

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:21.170
into the 600s in a considerably
weakened state after the siege.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.656
And it's during that
century--the first half of the

00:08:24.656 --> 00:08:28.910
next century--that Assyria
reached the zenith of its power.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.309
In Judah, you have King
Manasseh reigning.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.730
Now, King Manasseh reigned for
nearly 50 years.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.677
We're not sure of exact dates,
but somewhere around the 690s

00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:41.019
to the 640s, about 640:
50 years.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:44.071
Now remarkably,
the Deuteronomistic historian

00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:48.162
devotes only 18 verses to this
king who reigned for 50 years

00:08:48.162 --> 00:08:51.629
and all of those verses are
entirely negative.

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:55.712
And that's in great contrast to
their treatment of his father,

00:08:55.712 --> 00:08:59.259
Hezekiah, and his grandson who
follows him, Josiah.

00:08:59.259 --> 00:09:03.105
Manasseh was apparently a loyal
vassal of Assyria,

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:07.736
and according to the biblical
writer he reversed the reforms

00:09:07.736 --> 00:09:12.053
of his father Hezekiah who is
said by the writer to have

00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:14.799
destroyed idolatry and so on.
 

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:18.695
But he is said to have reversed
that and to have adopted

00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:21.649
Assyrian norms.
As we move through this century

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:24.470
and move towards the latter half
of this century,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.742
Assyria, which has overextended
itself is beginning to decline

00:09:27.742 --> 00:09:31.014
and some of the other states in
the Ancient Near East are able

00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:33.480
to break away.
First Egypt breaks away;

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.080
Babylon breaks away.
 

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.080
Josiah comes to the throne in
Judah in 740.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.899
He sees Assyria's weakness.
 

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:44.046
He decides to take advantage of
that and asserts Judean

00:09:44.046 --> 00:09:46.143
independence,
carries out a series of

00:09:46.143 --> 00:09:49.289
reforms--we've talked about
several times--in 622,

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:53.941
which include purging the cult
perhaps of Assyrian religious

00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:58.986
influences, centralizing worship
of Yahweh only and in Jerusalem,

00:09:58.986 --> 00:10:01.923
and so on.
So this centralization of the

00:10:01.923 --> 00:10:04.894
cult served probably a political
agenda as well,

00:10:04.894 --> 00:10:07.549
of asserting independence from
Assyria.

00:10:07.549 --> 00:10:11.488
Assyria is continuing to
decline towards the end of this

00:10:11.488 --> 00:10:15.139
century and in 612 the capital
Nineveh will fall.

00:10:15.139 --> 00:10:18.248
The Babylonians manage to
conquer the Assyrians by

00:10:18.248 --> 00:10:21.128
destroying Nineveh;
it's actually an alliance of

00:10:21.128 --> 00:10:22.400
Medes and Babylonians.
 

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.290
So things are going quite well.
 

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.444
Josiah is king;
he's a favored king,

00:10:26.444 --> 00:10:29.964
but just a few years later he
will die in a battle against the

00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:31.350
Egyptians at Megiddo.
 

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.671
So a little bit of historical
background for you as we talk

00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:36.159
about the next prophets.
 

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:39.752
Alright, so Josiah,
the king who's highly favored

00:10:39.752 --> 00:10:42.931
will die in 609.
Now, Zephaniah was a Judean

00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:46.730
prophet who prophesied during
the reign of King Josiah.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.790
So we're going to be moving on
now to Zephaniah and Jeremiah,

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.340
as the prophets of the
Babylonian crisis--and we're

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.349
going to throw in a couple of
prophetic characters along the

00:10:55.349 --> 00:10:57.230
way,
but they will be the two main

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.592
prophets of the Babylonian
crisis, obviously in the

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.860
south--all we have now is a
southern kingdom,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.984
Judah--but I'll be picking up
on two other prophets in a

00:11:04.984 --> 00:11:07.811
moment as well.
So he prophesied during the

00:11:07.811 --> 00:11:09.259
time of King Josiah.
 

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:13.176
Some of his prophecies seem to
date to the time,

00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:16.759
we think, before Josiah's
reforms in 622.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:19.710
And those prophecies tend to be
very pessimistic and very grim.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.920
Judah is condemned.
 

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.116
It's condemned for apostasy;
it's condemned for decadence,

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:27.409
all of the things that
flourished under King Manasseh.

00:11:27.409 --> 00:11:31.029
God is wrathful and his wrath
is imminent.

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:33.753
There will be a universal
destruction according to

00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:37.009
Zephaniah.
All life, animal and human,

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.120
will be exterminated.
 

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.679
So, as we saw in the book of
Amos this Day of Yahweh,

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.828
this Day of the Lord,
which has been so eagerly

00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:48.756
awaited,
will not in fact be a day of

00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:52.670
triumph, but a day of dark
destruction and despair.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.328
Zephaniah 1:15-18,
That day shall be a day

00:11:57.328 --> 00:11:59.610
of wrath,
A day of trouble and distress,

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.629
A day of calamity and
desolation,

00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:03.300
A day of darkness and deep
gloom,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.738
A day of densest clouds,
A day of horn blasts and

00:12:06.738 --> 00:12:08.910
alarms--
Against the fortified towns

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.600
And the lofty corner towers.
 

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.440
I will bring distress on the
people

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.509
And they shall walk like blind
men,

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:16.129
Because they sinned against the
Lord;

00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:18.320
Their blood shall be spilled
like dust,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.260
And their fat like dung.
 

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.580
Moreover, their silver and gold
Shall not avail to save them.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.029
On the day of the Lord's wrath,
In the fire of his passion,

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:28.710
The whole land shall be
consumed;

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.792
For He will make a terrible end
Of all who dwell in the

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:34.176
land.
You can see why people didn't

00:12:34.176 --> 00:12:37.259
enjoy listening to these
prophets, but at the same time,

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:40.399
like the other prophets,
Zephaniah also offered hope.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:44.110
There will be a humble remnant
which will seek refuge in God.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.279
These Jewish exiles,
he says, will be delivered from

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:52.366
their oppressors and even
Gentiles will join in the

00:12:52.366 --> 00:12:57.330
worship of God.
Zephaniah 3:11-13:

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.083
"In that day,
You will no longer be shamed

00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:02.600
for all the deeds
By which you have defied me.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.491
For then I will remove
The proud and exultant within

00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:07.320
you,
And you will be haughty no more

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.630
On my sacred mount.
 

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.620
But I will leave within you
A poor, humble folk,

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.770
"--this idea of purging the
dross and leaving the pure

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.030
remnant--"And they shall find
refuge

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.400
In the name of the Lord.
 

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.430
The remnant of Israel
Shall do no wrong

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.090
And speak no falsehood;
A deceitful tongue

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.330
Shall not be in their mouths.
 

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.149
Only such as these shall graze
and lie down,

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:28.759
With none to trouble
them."

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:31.680
There will also be an
ingathering of any exiled.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.541
Verse 20:
"At that time I will

00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:34.488
gather you,
And at [that]

00:13:34.488 --> 00:13:36.989
time I will bring you [home];
For I will make you renowned

00:13:36.989 --> 00:13:38.820
and famous
Among all the peoples on earth,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.049
When I restore your fortunes
Before their very eyes."

00:13:42.049 --> 00:13:44.452
There's one passage in
particular that seems

00:13:44.452 --> 00:13:45.850
extraordinarily joyous.
 

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.504
It seems to announce the
salvation as happening now,

00:13:49.504 --> 00:13:53.375
as present and so a lot of
scholars think that this was

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:57.818
Zephaniah's reaction to Josiah
and Josiah's reform which seemed

00:13:57.818 --> 00:14:02.046
to him to perhaps be the very
salvation for which the nation

00:14:02.046 --> 00:14:05.410
was longing.
Chapter 3:14 and 15:

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.350
Shout for joy, Fair Zion,
Cry aloud, O Israel!

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.280
Rejoice and be glad with all
your heart,

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.698
Fair Jerusalem!
The Lord has annulled the

00:14:12.698 --> 00:14:15.460
judgment against you,
He has swept away your foes.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.710
Israel's Sovereign the Lord is
within you;

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.639
You need fear misfortune no
more.

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:24.601
So, this sounds very much like
a reaction to these reforms

00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:26.129
initiated by Josiah.
 

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:30.143
This is hailed as the very
restoration of God's presence in

00:14:30.143 --> 00:14:33.049
the community of Judah that was
desired.

00:14:33.049 --> 00:14:36.520
The judgment has been annulled,
these terrible things I've been

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.200
prophesying will not happen.
 

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.080
Another short prophetic book we
should mention now is the Book

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.251
of Nahum.
It's very different from the

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:45.460
other prophetic books.
 

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.927
It doesn't really contain
prophecies and it doesn't really

00:14:48.927 --> 00:14:51.360
upbraid the people for their
failings,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.980
which are two things that most
of the other prophets do.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.046
The Book of Nahum is a short
little book and it's really a

00:14:58.046 --> 00:15:02.470
series of three poems and the
first one is an acrostic poem,

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.996
an alphabetical poem--each line
beginning with successive

00:15:06.996 --> 00:15:10.713
letters of the Hebrew
alphabet--and these poems

00:15:10.713 --> 00:15:14.269
rejoice over the fall of Nineveh
in 612,

00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:18.549
the capital of the cruel
Assyrian empire.

00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:21.771
The Assyrians were actually
quite widely hated in the

00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:23.009
Ancient Near East.
 

00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:25.845
They were noted for their
exceptional brutality,

00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:28.741
their inhumanity,
particularly in their conquests

00:15:28.741 --> 00:15:30.190
and empire building.
 

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.820
They deported populations
wholesale;

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.029
they were guilty of all sorts
of atrocities like mutilating

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:38.487
their captives;
they would butcher women and

00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:40.710
children--all sorts of
horrendous deeds.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.045
We have lots of testimony about
this, both in Assyrian sources

00:15:44.045 --> 00:15:47.053
but other Ancient Near Eastern
sources, texts as well as

00:15:47.053 --> 00:15:49.382
artwork.
So Nahum, in this poem,

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:53.674
is celebrating the avenging and
wrathful God who has finally

00:15:53.674 --> 00:15:57.819
turned around to destroy this
terrible enemy of Israel and

00:15:57.819 --> 00:15:59.419
indeed the world.
 

00:15:59.419 --> 00:16:02.767
According to Nahum,
it's quite true that God had

00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:04.690
used Assyria as his tool.
 

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.140
He had used Assyria to
discipline the kingdom of

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.178
Israel--they did destroy
Israel--and to discipline Judah

00:16:12.178 --> 00:16:13.720
for Judah's sins.
 

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.149
But God is ultimately the
universal sovereign and so

00:16:17.149 --> 00:16:21.184
Assyria's savagery--even if it
was part of God's disciplining

00:16:21.184 --> 00:16:25.017
of his children is--Assyria's
savagery is itself something

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:26.899
that must be punished.
 

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:30.101
So for Nahum,
the fall of Nineveh is God's

00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:34.240
vengeance upon Assyria for her
barbaric inhumanity.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.983
The Book of Nahum has often
been praised for its very vivid

00:16:38.983 --> 00:16:41.644
poetic style.
It describes these armed

00:16:41.644 --> 00:16:44.572
legions that march against
Nineveh and plunder its

00:16:44.572 --> 00:16:47.035
treasure,
and some of the most exciting

00:16:47.035 --> 00:16:50.527
archaeology that's been going on
has been the digging up of

00:16:50.527 --> 00:16:52.730
Nineveh.
I think the dig has obviously

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.129
stopped for reasons having to do
with the climate in that part of

00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:58.634
the world,
but the findings of Nineveh and

00:16:58.634 --> 00:17:01.678
the sacking of Nineveh--how
shallow pits were dug and

00:17:01.678 --> 00:17:05.308
treasures thrown into them and
covered over by the gates of the

00:17:05.308 --> 00:17:08.374
city as people were fleeing,
and many of these things-- when

00:17:08.374 --> 00:17:10.498
you read the description of
Nineveh and look at some of the

00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:13.630
archaeological data,
it's quite fascinating.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:18.060
But Nahum looks forward to a
happy era of freedom for Judah

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.574
and he says in 2:15:
"For never again shall the

00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:23.789
wicked come against you."
 

00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:25.533
Well, this isn't true,
and in fact,

00:17:25.533 --> 00:17:27.839
in a few years Josiah's going
to be killed.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.312
Judah's going to be made
subject to Egypt and in fact

00:17:31.312 --> 00:17:35.003
Babylon.
By 605 Babylon manages to

00:17:35.003 --> 00:17:39.839
extract tribute from Judah as a
vassal.

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:42.057
So in a way,
we have here really a glaring

00:17:42.057 --> 00:17:45.302
error and it's important to note
that this error in Nahum--it

00:17:45.302 --> 00:17:49.583
wasn't updated,
it wasn't repaired in order to

00:17:49.583 --> 00:17:53.269
protect his prophetic
reputation.

00:17:53.269 --> 00:17:54.839
So we see this interesting
tension.

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:58.518
We sometimes see prophetic
books being edited,

00:17:58.518 --> 00:18:02.359
revised, having interpolations
put into them,

00:18:02.359 --> 00:18:04.861
partly out of this conviction
that their words must be

00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:07.079
relevant and continue to have
some relevance;

00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:10.280
and other times,
there seems to be good evidence

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.230
that prophetic oracles were
preserved rather faithfully.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.027
But with the fall of Nineveh,
national confidence was

00:18:18.027 --> 00:18:22.408
probably boosted and then things
quickly turned sour with the

00:18:22.408 --> 00:18:26.059
death of Josiah in 609,
which was a terrible shock.

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:30.952
You have Judah lying trapped,
as it were, between two great

00:18:30.952 --> 00:18:35.930
powers: Egypt in the southwest,
Babylon in the northeast.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.086
And in 605, as I said,
Babylon managed to defeat Egypt

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:44.869
and reduce Judah to the status
of a tributary vassal under the

00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:48.822
King Jehoiakim.
King Jehoiakim rebels and in

00:18:48.822 --> 00:18:53.220
response, the Babylonians lay
siege to Jerusalem.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.566
There will be two sieges of
Jerusalem by the Babylonians

00:18:56.566 --> 00:18:59.487
just as we've had two sieges
earlier--two sieges:

00:18:59.487 --> 00:19:02.235
one in 597,
one in 587, both under

00:19:02.235 --> 00:19:05.367
Nebuchadnezzar.
He lays siege to Jerusalem in

00:19:05.367 --> 00:19:07.599
597, and doesn't destroy
Jerusalem.

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:11.137
He kills the king,
takes the king's son into

00:19:11.137 --> 00:19:15.250
captivity in Babylon and
installs a puppet king,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.435
still under the assumption that
things could be kept under

00:19:19.435 --> 00:19:22.029
control.
So the puppet King Zedekiah is

00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:25.253
on the throne but he also
decides to rebel and assert

00:19:25.253 --> 00:19:28.230
Judah's independence against the
Babylonians.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.630
So Nebuchadnezzar returns,
and this is in 587.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.837
And now the city is in fact
captured, the sanctuary is

00:19:34.837 --> 00:19:38.714
completely destroyed,
and the bulk of the population

00:19:38.714 --> 00:19:43.519
is exiled and this is what
brings to end nearly 400years of

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:46.170
an independent Hebrew nation.
 

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.109
The Book of Habakkuk was
written during this period,

00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:53.507
so 600 to the
destruction--somewhere in those

00:19:53.507 --> 00:19:56.247
years.
That's the period in which the

00:19:56.247 --> 00:19:58.740
Babylonians attacked Jerusalem
twice.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.200
Habakkuk is another unusual
prophetic book.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.398
It doesn't contain prophecies,
so much as it contains

00:20:06.398 --> 00:20:09.789
philosophical musings on God's
behavior.

00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:12.038
And we're going to see this
increasing now as we move into

00:20:12.038 --> 00:20:14.366
the next section of the Bible
when we complete the prophetic

00:20:14.366 --> 00:20:16.467
section.
We'll be encountering writings

00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:19.560
of very different genres and
some of them do contain these

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.839
philosophical musings on God's
conduct.

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:26.792
Habakkuk 1 and 2 are a kind of
poetic dialogue between the

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:30.615
prophet and Yahweh,
and the prophet complains

00:20:30.615 --> 00:20:33.569
bitterly about God's inaction.
 

00:20:33.569 --> 00:20:35.789
Verses 2 and 3 of the first
chapter:

00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:38.500
How long,
O Lord, shall I cry out

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.230
And You not listen,
Shall I shout to you "Violence!"

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.940
And you not save?
 

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.619
Why do You make me see iniquity
[Why] do You look upon wrong?--

00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:49.450
Raiding and violence are before
me,

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.990
Strife continues and contention
goes on.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.710
And skipping down to verses 13
and 14,

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.640
You whose eyes are too
pure to look upon evil,

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.259
Who cannot countenance
wrongdoing,

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:01.190
Why do you countenance
treachery.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.377
And stand by idle
While the one in the wrong

00:21:03.377 --> 00:21:05.000
devours
The one in the right?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.559
You have made mankind like the
fish of the sea,

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:10.160
Like creeping things that have
no ruler.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.884
Well, God responds to these
charges by saying that the

00:21:12.884 --> 00:21:16.071
Babylonians are the instruments
of his justice even though they

00:21:16.071 --> 00:21:18.950
ascribe their might and their
success to their gods,

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.539
rather than to Yahweh.
 

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:25.501
Now, we've already seen in
other books the idea that a

00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:29.538
conquering nation is serving as
the instrument of God's

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:32.493
punishment.
But Habakkuk is a little bit

00:21:32.493 --> 00:21:36.684
unusual because he doesn't couch
this idea in the larger argument

00:21:36.684 --> 00:21:40.089
that Judah deserves this
catastrophic punishment.

00:21:40.089 --> 00:21:42.788
There's a great difference
between Habakkuk and the

00:21:42.788 --> 00:21:45.025
Deuteronimistic historian,
for example,

00:21:45.025 --> 00:21:48.652
because Habakkuk doesn't assert
that the people are suffering

00:21:48.652 --> 00:21:51.332
for their sins.
Habakkuk is struggling with

00:21:51.332 --> 00:21:54.339
what appears to him to be a
basic lack of justice.

00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:57.767
The Deuteuronomistic historian
wants to assert God's justice,

00:21:57.767 --> 00:22:00.509
and whatever suffering happens
is justifiable.

00:22:00.509 --> 00:22:03.103
Habakkuk is resisting that idea
and we're going to see that

00:22:03.103 --> 00:22:05.607
resistance really come to a
climax next week when we talk

00:22:05.607 --> 00:22:06.769
about the Book of Job.
 

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:12.098
Habakkuk in 1:4 struggles with
this, "…decision fails / And

00:22:12.098 --> 00:22:14.230
justice never emerges.
 

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:18.146
/ For the villain hedges in the
just man-- / Therefore judgment

00:22:18.146 --> 00:22:19.410
emerges deformed."
 

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.028
It's not merely that the wicked
and the righteous suffer the

00:22:23.028 --> 00:22:26.830
same fate, it's that the wicked
really seem to fare better than

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.203
the just and that reduces
humankind to the level of fish

00:22:30.203 --> 00:22:33.822
and creeping things for whom
sheer power and not morality is

00:22:33.822 --> 00:22:36.029
the principal consideration.
 

00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:40.430
Now, having made this charge,
Habakkuk awaits God's answer.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.970
In chapter 2:1-5 he says,
I will stand on my watch,

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.970
Take up my station at the post,
And wait to see what He will

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.392
say to me,
What He will reply to my

00:22:50.392 --> 00:22:53.210
complaint.
The Lord answered me and said:

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.360
"Write the prophecy down,
Inscribe it clearly on tablets,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.200
So that it can be read easily.
 

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.640
…the righteous man is
rewarded with life

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.029
For his fidelity.
 

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:05.440
How much less then shall the
defiant go unpunished,…

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.430
Not a terribly deep answer.
 

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.297
The righteous simply have to
have faith that justice will

00:23:11.297 --> 00:23:14.369
prevail and this faith has to
sustain them through the trials

00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:16.109
that challenge that very idea.
 

00:23:16.109 --> 00:23:19.819
We'll see a deeper answer to
this same problem in the Book of

00:23:19.819 --> 00:23:22.759
Job.
The third chapter then shifts

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:25.027
gears.
So much so that once again

00:23:25.027 --> 00:23:27.690
scholars say it must be an
interpolation.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.284
But again, I would warn that
dramatic shifts in tone and

00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:33.161
theme are not that uncommon in
the prophetic books and we have

00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:35.876
to be careful.
But in this third chapter,

00:23:35.876 --> 00:23:38.390
God is described as a warrior
god.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.822
He thunders from the east,
he hurls his spear,

00:23:40.822 --> 00:23:43.200
he seeks vengeance on Israel's
oppressors.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.648
It may be that this is some
editor's attempt to respond to

00:23:46.648 --> 00:23:50.036
Habakkuk's skepticism that
Yahweh will bring justice--and

00:23:50.036 --> 00:23:52.940
bring it soon-- that he's
waiting: how long?

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.170
why is this taking you so long?
 

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.670
Why are you not acting?
 

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.632
And this image of an avenging
warrior God answers Habakkuk's

00:23:59.632 --> 00:24:02.789
opening question:
How long will God stand by and

00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:06.079
watch while the Babylonians rape
and pillage?

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:08.523
But on the other hand,
it's possible that it's

00:24:08.523 --> 00:24:11.401
Habakkuk himself and again the
book exhibits that same

00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:14.768
paradoxical tension we've seen
through so many of the prophetic

00:24:14.768 --> 00:24:16.419
books.
Specifically,

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:20.955
he holds out the paradoxical
view that God's justice is slow

00:24:20.955 --> 00:24:25.414
in coming but the righteous must
have complete faith in its

00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:27.259
ultimate execution.
 

00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:31.217
But he's raised the issue of
theodicy, the problem of evil,

00:24:31.217 --> 00:24:33.059
the problem of suffering.
 

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:36.207
Ultimately, he sees the
problem's resolution only in

00:24:36.207 --> 00:24:38.798
some vision of the future--an
avenging God,

00:24:38.798 --> 00:24:40.650
when justice will be done.
 

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.070
That is typical of some texts
that we will see later,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.839
particularly apocalyptic
literature,

00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:48.096
which is going to emphasize
patient waiting for an end time

00:24:48.096 --> 00:24:51.296
when there will be a cataclysmic
final act that will bring

00:24:51.296 --> 00:24:52.700
justice and judgment.
 

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.495
Now the prophet,
who lived at the time of the

00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:58.990
final destruction of Judah,
saw the fall of Jerusalem at

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.120
the hands of the Babylonians in
587 was the prophet Jeremiah,

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.039
another long prophetic book.
 

00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:08.055
So we have our three long
prophetic books,

00:25:08.055 --> 00:25:10.809
Isaiah of the Assyrian crisis,
Jeremiah of the Babylonian

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:13.592
crisis,
and Ezekiel writing from exile

00:25:13.592 --> 00:25:16.851
in Babylon.
Jeremiah was born of a priestly

00:25:16.851 --> 00:25:20.202
family in a village near
Jerusalem, Anathoth,

00:25:20.202 --> 00:25:24.240
and he began prophesying while
he was still a boy.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.109
Now, he was a contemporary of
King Josiah and so he saw the

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:31.578
renaissance that briefly
occurred under his guidance:

00:25:31.578 --> 00:25:34.943
the sweeping reform,
the eradication of Assyrian

00:25:34.943 --> 00:25:38.339
influences that had been
welcomed by King Manasseh,

00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:41.357
the renewal of the covenant,
all of these activities that

00:25:41.357 --> 00:25:43.890
are so highly favored by the
biblical writer.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.761
And when Josiah died,
Jeremiah also lamented his

00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:49.509
passing, along with the rest of
the nation.

00:25:49.509 --> 00:25:53.900
Jeremiah witnessed the final
destruction and the exile.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.452
The Book of Jeremiah is a
collection of very different

00:25:58.452 --> 00:26:00.170
types of material.
 

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.687
There's really no clear
organization,

00:26:01.687 --> 00:26:04.301
there's no clear chronological
order, not the kind of thing you

00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:06.789
can just sort of sit down and
read from beginning to end and

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:07.970
hope it'll make sense.
 

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.216
There are prophecies,
there are oracles and diatribes

00:26:11.216 --> 00:26:14.168
against foreign nations,
there are stories,

00:26:14.168 --> 00:26:17.417
biographical narratives,
there's some poetry,

00:26:17.417 --> 00:26:21.773
and at the very end a little
brief historical appendix which

00:26:21.773 --> 00:26:24.799
really resembles 2 Kings:
24 and 25.

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:28.451
So the literary history of the
book itself is also quite

00:26:28.451 --> 00:26:31.970
complex because there's great
variation in our ancient

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.941
witnesses.
The Septuagint,

00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:38.179
which is the Greek translation
of the Bible--third century BCE

00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:41.722
Greek translation of the
Bible--its Jeremiah is much

00:26:41.722 --> 00:26:45.890
shorter than the Hebrew version
of Jeremiah and it's arranged

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.214
differently;
internally, the arrangement is

00:26:49.214 --> 00:26:51.241
different.
There are also significant

00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:54.222
differences between the Hebrew
text that we have now and some

00:26:54.222 --> 00:26:57.204
fragments of Jeremiah that have
been found among the Dead Sea

00:26:57.204 --> 00:26:59.717
scrolls.
So this attests to the very

00:26:59.717 --> 00:27:03.589
open-ended nature of written
compositions in antiquity.

00:27:03.589 --> 00:27:06.396
We find three main types of
material, however,

00:27:06.396 --> 00:27:08.985
in Jeremiah.
(1) The poetic oracles that

00:27:08.985 --> 00:27:11.400
generally are attributed to
Jeremiah;

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.850
Then (2) biographical anecdotes
and narratives about him,

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:20.379
which are attributed to his
amanuensis and assistant whose

00:27:20.379 --> 00:27:23.319
name I don't think I put up
here.

00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:26.762
Baruch ben Neriah,
ben simply meaning son

00:27:26.762 --> 00:27:29.105
of, so Baruch,
the son of Neriah,

00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:33.500
whose name comes up quite a bit
in the Book of Jeremiah.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.966
And he is a scribe who assists
Jeremiah, and it's thought that

00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:40.149
perhaps the biographical
narrative sections were composed

00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:41.569
by Baruch ben Neriah.
 

00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:44.823
Then we also have (3) certain
editorial notes about Jeremiah

00:27:44.823 --> 00:27:47.801
that are in the style of the
Deuteronomistic historian,

00:27:47.801 --> 00:27:49.289
Deuteronomistic editor.
 

00:27:49.289 --> 00:27:52.163
Jeremiah, in general,
seems to have very close

00:27:52.163 --> 00:27:56.250
connections with the language
and the ideology of Deuteronomy.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.529
So if we look quickly at the
structure of the book,

00:27:59.529 --> 00:28:02.349
for the most part,
the first 25 chapters,

00:28:02.349 --> 00:28:06.111
Jeremiah 1 through 25 contain
an introduction and an account

00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:09.347
of Jeremiah's call,
but then also poetic oracles

00:28:09.347 --> 00:28:13.210
with some biographical snippets
thrown in there as well.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.374
Not snippets
narratives--biographical

00:28:15.374 --> 00:28:17.720
narratives as well as poetic
oracles.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.763
In 26to 29 we have stories of
his encounters--I should say

00:28:22.763 --> 00:28:27.807
run-ins--with other prophets and
with authority figures of

00:28:27.807 --> 00:28:32.133
various types.
Chapters 30 to 33 are oracles

00:28:32.133 --> 00:28:36.551
of hope and consolation;
34 to 45 are more prose

00:28:36.551 --> 00:28:41.750
stories, and these stories
center around and after the time

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.259
of the final destruction.
 

00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:49.248
Then we have several chapters,
46 to 51 that contain oracles

00:28:49.248 --> 00:28:51.461
against nations.
Some of these,

00:28:51.461 --> 00:28:53.734
scholars think,
might be from other writers and

00:28:53.734 --> 00:28:56.355
then again, as I say,
it concludes with this

00:28:56.355 --> 00:28:59.813
historical appendix about the
fall of Jerusalem that's

00:28:59.813 --> 00:29:01.509
extracted from 2 Kings.
 

00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:05.460
Now, Jeremiah preached the
inevitable doom and destruction

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.410
of the nation because of its
violation of the covenant,

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.351
which was the very charter for
her existence,

00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:16.430
and his descriptions were quite
vivid and quite terrifying.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:20.155
He denounced Israel's leaders,
the professional prophets in

00:29:20.155 --> 00:29:23.109
particular with whom he has many
encounters.

00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:25.654
The professional prophets are
liars, he says,

00:29:25.654 --> 00:29:27.390
because they prophesy peace.
 

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.715
He has some negative references
to priests as well,

00:29:30.715 --> 00:29:34.838
but he's especially critical of
King Jehoiakim who's the son of

00:29:34.838 --> 00:29:37.523
Josiah.
He can be compared to Micah

00:29:37.523 --> 00:29:41.791
because he also attacked this
idea, this popular ideology of

00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:43.890
the inviolability of Zion.
 

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.180
As long as injustice and
oppression are practiced in

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.471
Judah, the presence of the
temple is no guarantee of

00:29:50.471 --> 00:29:53.460
anything.
Judah will suffer the fate that

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.859
she deserves for failure to
fulfill her covenantal

00:29:56.859 --> 00:29:59.710
obligations.
So God tells Jeremiah to go

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.400
stand at the gate of the temple
and speak these words,

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.640
and this is a passage that's
often referred to as the "Temple

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.970
Sermon."
It's from chapter 7:

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.924
Thus said the Lord of
Hosts, the God of Israel:

00:30:11.924 --> 00:30:14.766
Mend your ways and your
actions, and I will let you

00:30:14.766 --> 00:30:16.130
dwell in this place.
 

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.143
Don't put your trust in
illusions and say,

00:30:18.143 --> 00:30:20.452
"The Temple of the Lord,
the Temple of the Lord,

00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:22.809
the Temple of the Lord are
these buildings."

00:30:22.809 --> 00:30:25.809
No, if you really mend your
ways and your actions;

00:30:25.809 --> 00:30:28.710
if you execute justice between
one man and another;

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.944
if you do not oppress the
stranger, the orphan,

00:30:30.944 --> 00:30:32.941
and the widow…
You hear the language of

00:30:32.941 --> 00:30:33.599
Deuteronomy right?
 

00:30:33.599 --> 00:30:35.644
Those three are always together
in Deuteronomy,

00:30:35.644 --> 00:30:37.599
drawing very heavily on the
same language.

00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:39.764
If you do not oppress the
stranger, the orphan,

00:30:39.764 --> 00:30:41.901
and the widow;
if you do not shed the blood of

00:30:41.901 --> 00:30:44.741
the innocent in this place;
if you do not follow other

00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:48.055
gods, to your own hurt --then
only will I let you dwell in

00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:50.589
this place,
in the land that I gave to your

00:30:50.589 --> 00:30:51.809
fathers for all time.
 

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:54.900
See, you are relying on
illusions that are to no avail.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.452
Will you steal and murder and
commit adultery and swear

00:30:57.452 --> 00:30:59.351
falsely,…
Again, allusion to the

00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:00.170
Decalogue, right?
 

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.160
Those four terms in the
Decalogue.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.011
Will you steal and murder
and commit adultery and swear

00:31:05.011 --> 00:31:08.169
falsely, and sacrifice to Baal,
and follow other gods whom you

00:31:08.169 --> 00:31:10.870
have not experienced,
and then come and stand before

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.870
Me in this house,
which bears My name and say,

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.311
"We are safe"?
[Safe]

00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:17.589
to do all these abhorrent
things!

00:31:17.589 --> 00:31:19.783
Do you consider this House,
which bears My name,

00:31:19.783 --> 00:31:20.950
to be a den of thieves?
 

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.412
As for Me, I have been
watching--declares the

00:31:23.412 --> 00:31:25.747
Lord.
So he attacked this doctrine of

00:31:25.747 --> 00:31:28.288
the inviolability of Zion and
that would have been

00:31:28.288 --> 00:31:30.000
iconoclastic to say the least.
 

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.369
But he pointed to history as
proof for his assertion.

00:31:34.369 --> 00:31:37.210
He cites the example of Shiloh
as an example.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.843
You remember during the period
of the Judges when the Ark of

00:31:39.843 --> 00:31:42.789
the Covenant was peripatetic and
would stay at different places,

00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:46.450
but for some time it came to
rest at Shiloh with the priest

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:47.650
Eli and his sons.
 

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.272
And in that time,
the Philistines managed to

00:31:50.272 --> 00:31:53.750
destroy the sanctuary and
capture the Ark and carry it off

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.579
into Philistine territory.
 

00:31:55.579 --> 00:31:58.565
So the presence of the Ark of
the Covenant is no guarantee of

00:31:58.565 --> 00:32:01.700
anything, and the belief that
God would not allow his temple,

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.794
his city, his anointed ruler to
be destroyed,

00:32:04.794 --> 00:32:06.833
Jeremiah says,
is a deception.

00:32:06.833 --> 00:32:08.309
It's an illusion.
 

00:32:08.309 --> 00:32:12.758
His political message resembles
very much the message of his

00:32:12.758 --> 00:32:15.504
predecessors.
He says that the nation's

00:32:15.504 --> 00:32:19.443
pathetic attempts to resist the
great powers and to enter into

00:32:19.443 --> 00:32:22.994
alliances with the one against
the other--these were all

00:32:22.994 --> 00:32:24.480
completely futile.
 

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.503
And to dramatically illustrate
the destruction and the slavery

00:32:28.503 --> 00:32:31.718
that were inevitable,
he paraded around Jerusalem,

00:32:31.718 --> 00:32:34.690
first in a wooden yoke and then
in an iron yoke.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.640
He does this in chapters 27 and
28.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.887
This is a symbol of the
slavery, the yoke of the master

00:32:40.887 --> 00:32:43.988
that is to come.
In chapter 27:6 he claims that

00:32:43.988 --> 00:32:47.890
God has power over all the Earth
and has given the Earth to

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.849
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon,
God's servant.

00:32:50.849 --> 00:32:54.094
As you can imagine,
referring to the destroyer of

00:32:54.094 --> 00:32:57.609
the nation as God's servant
would have been shocking,

00:32:57.609 --> 00:32:59.299
not to say dangerous.
 

00:32:59.299 --> 00:33:01.510
You can imagine parallels in
our own time,

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.746
where people would see the God
most commonly understood to be

00:33:04.746 --> 00:33:08.143
the God of most Americans being
the one who orchestrated attacks

00:33:08.143 --> 00:33:11.015
against us.
It would have that same kind of

00:33:11.015 --> 00:33:14.043
feel and power to people,
and in several passages

00:33:14.043 --> 00:33:18.079
Jeremiah exhorts the king to
submit to the Babylonian forces.

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:21.583
This is acceptance of God's
will, the forces that are

00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:23.200
surrounding Jerusalem.
 

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.531
To ensure the preservation of
his words, which were not

00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:31.782
popular, Jeremiah had his
amanuensis Baruch write down

00:33:31.782 --> 00:33:34.750
everything that God spoke to
him.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:38.160
Chapter 36 gives us an insight
into this process.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.516
It's kind of interesting
because Jeremiah's words are

00:33:42.516 --> 00:33:45.569
transcribed.
God specifically tells Jeremiah

00:33:45.569 --> 00:33:47.653
how to do this.
"Get a scroll," he says,

00:33:47.653 --> 00:33:50.113
"and write upon it all the
words that I have spoken to

00:33:50.113 --> 00:33:52.945
you--concerning Israel and Judah
and all the nations--from the

00:33:52.945 --> 00:33:55.730
time I first spoke to you in the
days of Josiah to this time"

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.637
(36:2).
Now it's the time of

00:33:57.637 --> 00:34:01.471
KingJehoiakim and then in verse
4 we read, "So Jeremiah called

00:34:01.471 --> 00:34:04.446
Baruch son of Neriah;
and Baruch wrote down in the

00:34:04.446 --> 00:34:07.587
scroll, at Jeremiah's dictation,
all the words which the Lord

00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:08.739
had spoken to him."
 

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.621
Now, Jeremiah is in hiding at
this time because he's

00:34:11.621 --> 00:34:14.739
politically very unpopular,
so he instructs Baruch to take

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.699
the scroll to the temple and to
stand there and to read it to

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.860
the people.
The king's officials are there.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.206
They report to the king about
the subversive message which has

00:34:24.206 --> 00:34:26.130
been delivered by Baruch.
 

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:30.471
So Baruch goes into hiding;
the scroll is torn into strips

00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:33.113
and burned.
God orders Jeremiah to get

00:34:33.113 --> 00:34:36.579
another scroll and repeat the
process, and he does.

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:40.139
Verse 32 of chapter 36,
"So Jeremiah got another scroll

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:43.369
and gave it to the scribe Baruch
son of Neriah.

00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:46.114
And at Jeremiah's dictation,
he wrote in it the whole text

00:34:46.114 --> 00:34:48.809
of the scroll that King
Jehoiakim of Judah had burned;

00:34:48.809 --> 00:34:50.873
and more of the like was
added," – so,

00:34:50.873 --> 00:34:53.869
and then some.
They came back with even more.

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:57.469
So it's possible--some scholars
suggest--that what was written,

00:34:57.469 --> 00:35:00.953
would have been the contents of
chapters 1 to 25 which really

00:35:00.953 --> 00:35:03.739
contains the oracular material,
the oracles.

00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:06.594
But in any event,
this story gives us some

00:35:06.594 --> 00:35:09.309
insight into the process of
prophecy.

00:35:09.309 --> 00:35:11.909
It doesn't appear to have been
really off the cuff.

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:14.300
The compositions of the
prophets were literary

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.690
compositions that were committed
to memory;

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:19.320
they could then be dictated
again.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.117
And on an archaeological note,
I should point out that one of

00:35:22.117 --> 00:35:26.096
the most exciting finds,
I think, is a clay--in 1975

00:35:26.096 --> 00:35:32.347
they found a clay bulla which is
like a clay imprint of Baruch

00:35:32.347 --> 00:35:35.387
son of Neriah,
the scribe – that's what it

00:35:35.387 --> 00:35:36.550
says on the clay imprint.
 

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.630
Another one was found in 1996.
 

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.740
It was said to be found in a
burnt house in Jerusalem,

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.090
which would have been around
the time of the destruction.

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.114
And it just showed up on the
antiquities market,

00:35:45.114 --> 00:35:47.139
so some question whether it's
genuine or not.

00:35:47.139 --> 00:35:49.599
The second one that was found
has a fingerprint on it and

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:51.620
people say, well,
that could be the fingerprint

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.849
of Baruch son of Neriah.
 

00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:55.308
Anyway, this is the fun stuff
you get to do if you do

00:35:55.308 --> 00:35:58.004
archaeology, but there are
plenty of people who think that

00:35:58.004 --> 00:36:01.219
these probably are the seals of
the scribe Baruch son of Neriah,

00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:04.736
that he would have used to
stamp anything that he would

00:36:04.736 --> 00:36:06.690
have transcribed or written.
 

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:10.780
So Jeremiah was rejected;
he was despised;

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.929
he was persecuted by fellow
Judeans.

00:36:12.929 --> 00:36:15.909
Naturally, they would have seen
him as a traitor.

00:36:15.909 --> 00:36:18.280
He was flogged,
he was imprisoned.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.832
Often in his life he was in
hiding, he was a very troubled

00:36:21.832 --> 00:36:24.699
person and he lived in very
difficult times.

00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:28.504
But we also get an insight into
his emotional state which we

00:36:28.504 --> 00:36:31.020
don't from any of the other
prophets.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.176
He suffered immensely;
he weeps over Jerusalem in

00:36:35.176 --> 00:36:38.536
chapter 8 and 9.
We get a sense of the turmoil

00:36:38.536 --> 00:36:41.156
that he suffers,
particularly because of a group

00:36:41.156 --> 00:36:44.613
of passages that are referred to
as the Confessions of Jeremiah

00:36:44.613 --> 00:36:48.069
and these are sort of scattered
throughout--some in chapters 11

00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:49.898
and 12,
15,17, 18,20,

00:36:49.898 --> 00:36:54.090
but these are passages that
reveal his inner state.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.269
Some people question their
authenticity,

00:36:56.269 --> 00:36:59.679
but in any event they paint a
very fascinating portrait of the

00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:02.206
prophet.
He curses the day that he was

00:37:02.206 --> 00:37:04.702
born;
he accuses God of deceiving

00:37:04.702 --> 00:37:09.396
him, of enticing him to act as
God's messenger only to be met

00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:13.699
with humiliation and shame,
but he can't hold it in.

00:37:13.699 --> 00:37:17.139
God's words rage inside him and
he must prophesy.

00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:21.998
It would be better had he not
been born at all than to suffer

00:37:21.998 --> 00:37:23.780
this ceaseless pain.
 

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.809
Chapter 20:7-18,
just selections from there:

00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:30.650
You enticed me,
O Lord, and I was enticed;

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.360
You overpowered me and You
prevailed.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.770
I have become a constant
laughingstock,

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.210
Everyone jeers at me.
 

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.420
For every time I speak I must
cry out,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.250
Must shout, "Lawlessness and
rapine!"

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.060
For the word of the Lord causes
me

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.460
Constant disgrace and contempt.
 

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.480
I thought, "I will not mention
Him,

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.159
No more will I speak in His
name"--

00:37:50.159 --> 00:37:52.302
But [His Word]
was like a raging fire in my

00:37:52.302 --> 00:37:54.639
heart,
Shut up in my bones;

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:57.199
I could not hold it in,
I was helpless.

00:37:57.199 --> 00:37:59.070
I heard the whispers of the
crowd--

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.210
Terror all around:
"Inform!

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.790
Let us inform against him!"
 

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.560
…Accursed be the day
That I was born!

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.960
…Accursed be the man
Who brought my father the news

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.030
And said, "A boy / Is born to
you,"

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.400
And gave him such joy!
 

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.510
Let that man become like the
cities

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.809
Which the Lord overthrew
without relenting!

00:38:14.809 --> 00:38:17.030
…Because he did not kill me
before birth

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.090
So that my mother might be my
grave,

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:22.329
And her womb big [with me]
for all time.

00:38:22.329 --> 00:38:24.310
Why did I ever issue from the
womb,

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.329
To see misery and woe,
To spend all my days in

00:38:28.329 --> 00:38:30.526
shame!
Nevertheless,

00:38:30.526 --> 00:38:35.817
despite all of his very harsh
criticisms of the establishment

00:38:35.817 --> 00:38:38.808
authorities,
the royal house and even

00:38:38.808 --> 00:38:43.119
scribes, other prophets who are
labeled as liars by Jeremiah,

00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:47.623
his words were preserved by
scribes, by the Deuteronomistic

00:38:47.623 --> 00:38:50.221
editors.
Shortly after the fall of

00:38:50.221 --> 00:38:53.500
Judah, Jeremiah was taken
forcibly to Egypt.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.610
And he lived his final years
out in Egypt.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.350
He didn't give up his job
though.

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:58.619
He kept denouncing people.
 

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:02.290
We have records of his
denouncing his fellow Judean

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:06.328
exiles down in Egypt for
worshipping the Queen of Heaven

00:39:06.328 --> 00:39:10.329
and as before,
it seems very few heeded him

00:39:10.329 --> 00:39:12.671
there.
But like the earlier prophets,

00:39:12.671 --> 00:39:15.514
Jeremiah also balanced his
message with a message of

00:39:15.514 --> 00:39:17.715
consolation,
and there are some very

00:39:17.715 --> 00:39:20.979
interesting and unique features
of Jeremiah's message of

00:39:20.979 --> 00:39:23.587
consolation.
These passages are found

00:39:23.587 --> 00:39:27.808
particularly in chapters 30 to
33 where we have more hopeful

00:39:27.808 --> 00:39:31.000
prophesies.
He envisages a restoration;

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.628
the exile will come to an end,
and in fact Jeremiah is the

00:39:34.628 --> 00:39:38.384
first to actually set a time
limit to what we might refer to

00:39:38.384 --> 00:39:40.739
as the dominion of the
idolaters;

00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:43.599
the idolaters holding sway over
God's people,

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:46.329
and that time limit he says is
70 years.

00:39:46.329 --> 00:39:50.406
Jeremiah writes a letter to the
first group of deportees,

00:39:50.406 --> 00:39:53.099
so remember the first siege in
597?

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:56.326
You have the king killed,
his son and many people taken

00:39:56.326 --> 00:39:57.760
into exile in Babylon.
 

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.674
Jeremiah, from Jerusalem,
writes a letter to that first

00:40:00.674 --> 00:40:03.050
group of exiles and it's quite
remarkable,

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.166
it's found in chapter 29,
and it's quite remarkable for

00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:09.630
its counsel, its advice to the
exiles to settle down in their

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:12.170
adopted home and just wait out
the time.

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:13.769
There is an appointed end.
 

00:40:13.769 --> 00:40:16.982
He warns the people not to
listen to prophets who say you

00:40:16.982 --> 00:40:19.219
will return shortly,
it's just a lie.

00:40:19.219 --> 00:40:22.954
The Israelites have to serve
the king of Babylon and by doing

00:40:22.954 --> 00:40:24.199
so they will live.
 

00:40:24.199 --> 00:40:27.997
So in Jeremiah 29:4-7,
"Thus said the Lord of Hosts,

00:40:27.997 --> 00:40:31.570
the God of Israel,
to the whole community which I

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.400
exiled from Jerusalem to
Babylon,"

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.014
--he's writing to the exiles:
Build houses and live in

00:40:38.014 --> 00:40:40.480
them, plant gardens and eat
their fruit.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.280
Take wives and beget sons and
daughters;

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.809
and take wives for your sons,
and give your daughters to

00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:48.110
husbands, that they may bear
sons and daughters.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.989
Multiply there, do not decrease.
 

00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:53.341
And seek the welfare of the
city to which I have exiled

00:40:53.341 --> 00:40:55.460
you..."
Instead of seek the welfare of

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.633
Jerusalem, seek the welfare of
the city to which I have exiled

00:40:58.633 --> 00:41:00.869
you "and pray to the Lord in its
behalf;

00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:03.869
for in its prosperity you shall
prosper.

00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:06.929
In other words,
you're in for the long haul.

00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:10.380
And you shouldn't be deceived
by the idle dreams or the false

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.140
prophets who tell you that
return is imminent.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.550
God has other plans.
 

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.335
They are plans for welfare,
not for evil,

00:41:17.335 --> 00:41:20.469
and they will give you a future
and a hope.

00:41:20.469 --> 00:41:22.817
At the end of 70 years,
Jeremiah said,

00:41:22.817 --> 00:41:26.434
there will be a great war of
all the nations and Judah and

00:41:26.434 --> 00:41:29.099
Israel will be returned to their
land.

00:41:29.099 --> 00:41:32.745
Zion, he declared,
would be acknowledged as the

00:41:32.745 --> 00:41:36.469
Holy City and a new Davidic king
would reign.

00:41:36.469 --> 00:41:39.739
A new covenant would be made
with Israel as well.

00:41:39.739 --> 00:41:41.443
And this time,
Jeremiah says,

00:41:41.443 --> 00:41:44.364
it's a covenant that will be
etched on the heart,

00:41:44.364 --> 00:41:46.860
encoded as it were into human
nature.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.822
Jeremiah 31:31-34:
See, a time is

00:41:50.822 --> 00:41:54.052
coming--declares the Lord--when
I will make a new covenant with

00:41:54.052 --> 00:41:56.449
the House of Israel and the
House of Judah.

00:41:56.449 --> 00:41:58.695
It will not be like the
covenant I made with their

00:41:58.695 --> 00:42:01.445
fathers, when I took them by the
hand to lead them out of the

00:42:01.445 --> 00:42:03.868
land of Egypt,
a covenant which they broke,

00:42:03.868 --> 00:42:06.380
so that I rejected
them--declares the Lord.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.596
But such is the covenant I will
make with the House of Israel

00:42:09.596 --> 00:42:12.706
after these days--declares the
Lord: I will put My Teaching

00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:16.030
into their inmost being and
inscribe it upon their hearts.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.050
Then I will be their God,
and they shall be My people.

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.931
No longer will they need to
teach one another and say to one

00:42:21.931 --> 00:42:24.106
another, "Heed the Lord";
for all of them,

00:42:24.106 --> 00:42:26.730
from the least of them to the
greatest, shall heed

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.760
Me--declares the Lord.
So this is a remarkable idea.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.128
It seems to express some
dissatisfaction with the element

00:42:33.128 --> 00:42:35.654
of free will,
which is otherwise so crucial

00:42:35.654 --> 00:42:38.481
to the biblical notion of
covenant and morality:

00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:41.789
the idea that humans freely
choose their actions.

00:42:41.789 --> 00:42:44.819
After all, when you think about
some of the major themes set out

00:42:44.819 --> 00:42:47.464
in the Hebrew Bible at the very
beginning in the opening

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:50.619
chapters,
this would seem to be a

00:42:50.619 --> 00:42:53.699
cardinal principle:
choice.

00:42:53.699 --> 00:42:56.384
But free choice does mean of
course that there will be bad

00:42:56.384 --> 00:42:58.739
choices and there will be
disobedience and evil,

00:42:58.739 --> 00:43:02.090
and people can get tired of
that and Jeremiah was.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:06.194
So his utopian ideal is
inspiring, but it does eliminate

00:43:06.194 --> 00:43:08.210
the element of free will.
 

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:11.467
It seems to describe a
situation in which humans are

00:43:11.467 --> 00:43:14.150
almost hardwired to obey God's
covenant.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.219
That's a tension that will also
be developed in some later

00:43:17.219 --> 00:43:19.820
texts.
I just note it here.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.809
In a very beautiful passage,
Jeremiah describes a future

00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:27.580
restoration of the temple,
the bringing of offerings

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.966
again, the singing of psalms and
praise, and this is in contrast

00:43:31.966 --> 00:43:34.334
to chapter 25.
There, in chapter 25,

00:43:34.334 --> 00:43:37.323
he warned that God will banish
"the sound of mirth and

00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:39.631
gladness,
the voice of bridegroom and

00:43:39.631 --> 00:43:42.170
bride," leaving the land a
desolate ruin.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.630
Now in his oracle of
consolation Jeremiah says,

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.158
Again there shall be
heard in this place… in the

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:51.099
towns of Judah and the streets
of Jerusalem that are desolate,

00:43:51.099 --> 00:43:52.834
without man,
without inhabitants,

00:43:52.834 --> 00:43:55.489
without beast--the sound of
mirth and gladness,

00:43:55.489 --> 00:43:58.168
the voice of bridegroom and
bride, the voice of those who

00:43:58.168 --> 00:44:00.130
cry, "Give thanks to the Lord of
Hosts,

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.711
for the Lord is good,
for His kindness is

00:44:02.711 --> 00:44:04.778
everlasting!"
as they bring thanksgiving

00:44:04.778 --> 00:44:06.300
offerings to the House of the
Lord.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.868
For I will restore the fortunes
of the land as of old--said the

00:44:09.868 --> 00:44:13.586
Lord [Jer 33:10-11].
So just to kind of summarize

00:44:13.586 --> 00:44:18.402
these prophets leading up to the
time of the destruction (because

00:44:18.402 --> 00:44:23.218
next time we'll be talking about
the exile and later the return):

00:44:23.218 --> 00:44:27.658
The fall of Jerusalem shattered
the national and territorial

00:44:27.658 --> 00:44:31.119
basis of Israel's culture and
religion.

00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:33.742
The Babylonians had burned the
temple to the ground,

00:44:33.742 --> 00:44:36.210
they carried away most of the
people to exile,

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.730
to live in exile in Babylon,
leaving behind mostly members

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:43.559
of the lower classes to eke out
a living as best they could.

00:44:43.559 --> 00:44:48.033
And it was the completion of a
tragedy that had begun centuries

00:44:48.033 --> 00:44:52.506
earlier and it was interpreted
as a fulfillment of the covenant

00:44:52.506 --> 00:44:54.821
curses.
It was the end of the Davidic

00:44:54.821 --> 00:44:57.550
monarchy, although the
Deuteronomistic historian does

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:00.471
close with this note,
that the son of Jehoiakim was

00:45:00.471 --> 00:45:03.738
alive and living in Babylon,
kind of holding out hope that

00:45:03.738 --> 00:45:06.260
the line hadn't actually been
killed out,

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.750
hadn't been completely wiped
out.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.119
But the institution seemed to
have come to an end for now.

00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:15.035
It was the end of the temple,
the end of the priesthood,

00:45:15.035 --> 00:45:17.832
the end of Israel as a nation,
as an autonomous nation,

00:45:17.832 --> 00:45:21.829
and so the Israelites were
confronted with a great test.

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:25.143
As I've stressed before,
one option would be to see in

00:45:25.143 --> 00:45:28.769
these events a signal that
Yahweh had abandoned them to,

00:45:28.769 --> 00:45:31.802
or had been defeated by,
the god of the Babylonians,

00:45:31.802 --> 00:45:35.369
and Marduk would replace Yahweh
as the Israelites assimilated

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:37.449
themselves into their new home.
 

00:45:37.449 --> 00:45:40.919
And certainly there were
Israelites who went this route,

00:45:40.919 --> 00:45:44.515
but others who were firmly
rooted in exclusive Yahwism did

00:45:44.515 --> 00:45:46.498
not,
and they're the ones who left

00:45:46.498 --> 00:45:47.570
us their literature.
 

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:51.707
How could this faith survive
outside the framework of

00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:56.084
Israelite national culture,
away from the temple and the

00:45:56.084 --> 00:45:58.710
land, uprooted and scattered?
 

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.641
Could Israelite religion
survive without these national

00:46:01.641 --> 00:46:04.409
foundations and institutions and
on foreign soil,

00:46:04.409 --> 00:46:07.480
or would it go the way of other
national religions?

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.567
You hear the pain and the
despair that would have been

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:13.829
experienced at this time in the
words of the Psalmist,

00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:16.840
Psalm 137 which is written at
this time:

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.170
By the rivers of Babylon,
there we sat,

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:22.040
sat and wept,
as we thought of Zion.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.769
There on the poplars
we hung up our lyres,

00:46:24.769 --> 00:46:28.010
for our captors asked us there
for songs

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:29.851
our tormentors,
for amusement,

00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:32.199
"Sing us one of the songs of
Zion."

00:46:32.199 --> 00:46:33.610
How can we sing a song of the
Lord

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:36.570
on alien soil?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem,

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.880
let my right hand wither;
let my tongue stick to my palate

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.365
if I cease to think of you,
if I do not keep Jerusalem in

00:46:43.365 --> 00:46:46.530
memory
even at my happiest hour.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.536
It was the message of the
prophets that helped some

00:46:49.536 --> 00:46:53.203
Israelites make sense of their
situation in a manner that kept

00:46:53.203 --> 00:46:56.269
them distinct and invulnerable
to assimilation.

00:46:56.269 --> 00:46:59.040
And this was probably the
reason for the preservation of

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.062
the prophetic writings,
even though they had often been

00:47:02.062 --> 00:47:04.619
despised or unheeded in their
own lifetimes.

00:47:04.619 --> 00:47:07.800
Yahweh hadn't been defeated,
they claimed.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.687
The nation's calamities were
not disproof of His power and

00:47:10.687 --> 00:47:12.409
covenant, they were proof of it.
 

00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:15.081
The prophets had spoken truly
when they had said that

00:47:15.081 --> 00:47:18.164
destruction would follow if the
people didn't turn from their

00:47:18.164 --> 00:47:20.630
moral and religious violations
of God's law.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:23.215
So that rather than undermining
faith in God,

00:47:23.215 --> 00:47:26.563
the defeat and the exile when
interpreted in the prophetic

00:47:26.563 --> 00:47:29.083
manner,
had the potential to convince

00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:32.637
Jews of the need to show
absolute and undivided devotion

00:47:32.637 --> 00:47:36.365
to God and His commandments,
so that paradoxically the

00:47:36.365 --> 00:47:40.367
moment of greatest national
despair could be transformed by

00:47:40.367 --> 00:47:44.300
the prophets into an occasion
for the renewal of religious

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.120
faith.
The great contribution of the

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.241
prophets was their emphasis on
God's desire for morality as

00:47:51.241 --> 00:47:53.869
expressed in the ancient
covenant.

00:47:53.869 --> 00:47:57.802
The great contribution of
Jeremiah was his insistence on

00:47:57.802 --> 00:48:01.019
God's everlasting covenant with
his people,

00:48:01.019 --> 00:48:04.415
even outside the land of Israel
and despite the loss of national

00:48:04.415 --> 00:48:08.440
religious symbols--the temple,
the Holy City, the Davidic king.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.996
And this insistence that the
faithful person's relationship

00:48:11.996 --> 00:48:15.208
with God wasn't broken,
even in an idolatrous land,

00:48:15.208 --> 00:48:18.380
when added to Jeremiah's notion
of a new covenant,

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:22.275
provided the exiles with the
ideas that would transform the

00:48:22.275 --> 00:48:25.500
nation of Israel into the
religion of Judaism.

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.007
Next time we're going to turn
to two post-destruction prophets

00:48:29.007 --> 00:48:32.227
who also helped the nation
formulate a viable response to

00:48:32.227 --> 00:48:34.469
the tragedy that had befallen
them.

00:48:34.469 --> 00:48:38.994
This is a point at which we can
begin to use words like

00:48:38.994 --> 00:48:40.000
"Judaism."

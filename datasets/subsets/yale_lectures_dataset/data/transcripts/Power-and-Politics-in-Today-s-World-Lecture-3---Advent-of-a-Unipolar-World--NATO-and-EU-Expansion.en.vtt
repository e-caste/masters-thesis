00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.660
- Today, we're gonna be talking

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.910
about the international architecture

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.960
of what I'm calling the
early post-Cold War world,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960
and by early, I'm really
focusing on the time

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.370
from the collapse of communism
until the financial crisis

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.960
of 2008 because we're gonna see

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.930
that that ushered in pretty
big structural changes,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.540
both within a lot of the countries

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.070
we're gonna be talking about

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.670
and in international political economy

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.163
and in international relations.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.860
Our agenda, we're gonna talk

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.610
about NATO expansion after the Cold War,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.360
we're gonna talk about
the Washington Consensus

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.830
and then we're gonna talk
about the European Union,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.653
its enlargement and its challenges.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.720
So it's a pretty big menu.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.370
I do wanna take a minute to say something

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.150
about three lenses for
thinking about politics.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.560
One of the problems with political science

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.410
is that people tend not to
say in words of one syllable

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.923
what they can say in
words of five syllables.

00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:26.640
And so there's an awful lot of terminology

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270
and jargon, and it's my ambition

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.493
to use as little of this as possible.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.690
But I do want to alert you
to three different ways

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.440
of thinking about politics,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.150
that, to some extent, compete

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.250
and, to some extent, are complementary.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.093
The first is one that focuses
on people's interests.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.450
You might think of Marxism as focusing

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.100
on people's economic interests

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.100
but also former rational
choice models of politics

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.820
that use economic approaches to politic,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.810
focus on people's individual interests.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.110
It's all interest-based.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.810
And we think about just common
folk wisdom about politics,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.010
people expect people to do things

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.000
that are in their interest.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.300
When we move into the realm
of international relations,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.350
this interest-based way of looking

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.460
at the world sometimes traffics

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.130
under the title of realism,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.050
that, realists in international relations

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.010
are people who say that countries follow

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.270
their individual interests.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.650
Now, not every interest-based theory

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.610
of international politics is realist

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.770
because there are some who say,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.780
well, yeah but you've gotta
look at the domestic politics

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.490
of countries and how that influences

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.490
what they do internationally.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.220
So they might still be interest-based

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.440
but they're not gonna take countries

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.130
as their basic unit of analysis.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.550
But the idea behind realism but trying to,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.170
all of these different
schools I've just mentioned,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.940
is that if you want to understand

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.790
what's gonna happen in politics,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.030
look at the interests
of the relevant actors.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.750
Might have different theories about that

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.523
but it's all an interest-based.

00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:22.780
This second basic lens
that people bring to bear

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.850
on politics is about institutions.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.870
And here, in domestic politics,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.910
it might be people who
think independent courts

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.280
and the separation of
powers are important,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.810
that they structure what happens.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.100
Others think, no, it's the
kinds of political parties,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.580
but institutional
arrangements are important.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.243
When we think about the
international system,

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:50.930
institutionalists travel
under various labels,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.720
again, they call them
liberal institutionalists,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.410
some of them, but they have,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.230
sometimes they just call
themselves institutionalists,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.550
plain and simple,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.810
but they look at
international institutions,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.020
things like the United Nations.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.335
NATO is a kind of
institution, it's an alliance,

00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:11.530
it's not an international institution,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.880
it's an alliance, but it it
has an institutional presence.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.120
So this second lens focuses
on institutional arrangements

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.890
which may or may not be consistent

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.060
with the way people's
interests line up, right?

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.720
So for instance, George Kennan,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.240
who I mentioned to you last time,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.860
thought the United Nations
was a waste of time

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.280
because countries always
behave in their interests

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.970
and if the UN told them to do something

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.000
that wasn't in their interest,
they would ignore it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.810
So there, you can see possible tensions

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.943
between institutionalists
and interest-based accounts.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.850
Rosa Luxemburg is famous for saying,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.330
the rivers of history run

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.020
through the most finely meshed statute.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.500
So again, it's in a
Marxist view that interests

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.730
are gonna prevail and
institutional stuff is irrelevant.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.160
And then the third, I'm
putting under the heading

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.160
of ideals, and this can
be ideas, culture, norms,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.730
things other than
interests and institutions

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.070
that affect what actually
happens in politics.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.560
And again, people disagree a lot about,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.453
some hard boiled realist will say,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.300
norms and institutions
are all beside the point.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.710
Others think norms are very important

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.880
and that they actually
structure what happens.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.050
Again, here, there's
lots of fancy terminology

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.510
to capture this notion,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.160
there's something called constructivism

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.120
in international relations theory,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.470
it's basically a theory
of normative behavior,

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.820
norms shaping outcomes.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.820
And so, a lot of the squabbling
in the academic journals

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.150
and so on is among people
who focus on interests,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.320
on institutions, or on ideas.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.370
And my own view, just putting my cards

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.760
on the table before we dig in to today,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.790
is that, to say, which is the right one,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.120
is the wrong question.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.850
And it's better to try and understand

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.240
what are the conditions
under which interests tend

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.680
to prevail or institutions tend to prevail

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.710
or norms can re-structure things.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.920
And those conditions change.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.920
And there's often much more play,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.230
there's sometimes much
more play for norms,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.280
say, than at other times,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.450
like when the Cold War collapses

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.830
and the institutional
architecture's up for grabs,

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.090
then it might matter a lot
what ideas are out there

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.520
or not out there but in
the middle of the Cold War,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.000
when everybody's locked into positions

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.440
that are highly, highly rigid,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.130
then ideas are probably largely
gonna be beside the point.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.690
So that's the way I will
tend to use these notions

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.570
and you will see them coming up,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.283
obviously, today but
throughout the course.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.980
Okay.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.980
So let's think about
the first post-Cold War

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:26.210
international security
crisis which was prompted

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.210
by Saddam Hussein's invasion
of Kuwait in late 1990.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.360
- Just two hours ago,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.720
allied air forces began an
attack on military targets

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.173
in Iraq and Kuwait.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.230
These attacks continue as I speak.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.040
Ground forces are not engaged.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.850
This conflict started August 2nd,

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.870
when then dictator of Iraq invaded a small

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.790
and helpless neighbor.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.570
Kuwait, a member of the Arab League,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.880
and a member of the United
Nations was crushed,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.220
its people brutalized.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.280
Five months ago,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.500
Saddam Hussein started this
cruel war against Kuwait.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.283
Tonight, the battle has been joined.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.170
This military action,

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.790
taken in accord with
United Nations resolutions

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.110
and with the consent of
the United States Congress,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.060
follows months of constant

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.500
and virtually endless diplomatic activity

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.380
on the part of the United Nations,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.500
the United States, and
many, many other countries.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.640
Arab leaders sought what became known

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.570
as an Arab solution only to conclude

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.180
that Saddam Hussein was
unwilling to leave Kuwait.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.560
Others traveled to Baghdad
in a variety of efforts

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.210
to restore peace and justice.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.980
Our Secretary of State, James Baker,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.860
held an historic meeting in Geneva

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.830
only to be totally rebuffed.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.230
This past weekend, in a last ditch effort,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.860
the Secretary General
of the United Nations

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.450
went to the Middle East
with peace in his heart,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.280
his second such mission,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.310
and he came back from Baghdad
with no progress at all

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.530
in getting Saddam Hussein
to withdraw from Kuwait.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.710
Now, the 28 countries with
forces in the Gulf area

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.270
have exhausted all reasonable efforts

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.750
to reach a peaceful resolution,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.750
have no choice but to drive
Saddam from Kuwait by force.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.163
We will not fail.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.030
As I report to you, air
attacks are underway

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.323
against military targets in Iraq.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.160
We are determined to knock out

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.340
Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.963
We will also destroy his
chemical weapons facilities.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.090
Our objectives are clear;

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.223
Saddam Hussein's forces will leave Kuwait,

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.560
the legitimate government of Kuwait

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.800
will be restored to its rightful place,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.993
and Kuwait will once again be free.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.100
Iraq will eventually comply

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.750
with all relevant United
Nations resolutions

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.280
and then, when peace is restored,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.300
it is our hope that Iraq
will live as a peaceful

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.223
and cooperative member
of the family of nations.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.500
I had hoped that when the
United States Congress,

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.930
in historic debate, took
its resolute action,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.900
Saddam would realize he could not prevail

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.820
and would move out of Kuwait in accord

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.793
with the United Nation resolutions.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.630
He did not do that.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.250
Instead, he remained intransigent,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.193
certain that time was on his side.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.810
Saddam was warned over
and over again to comply

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.090
with the will of the United Nations,

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.263
leave Kuwait or be driven out.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.120
Saddam has arrogantly
rejected all warnings.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.937
Instead, he tried to make
this a dispute between Iraq

00:11:07.937 --> 00:11:09.923
and the United States of America.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.520
Well, he failed.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.470
Tonight, 28 nations, countries
from five continents,

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.590
Europe and Asia, Africa
and the Arab League,

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.990
have forces in the Gulf area,

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.143
standing shoulder to shoulder
against Saddam Hussein.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:31.100
These countries had hoped the
use of force could be avoided.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.270
Regrettably, we now believe

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.483
that only force will make him leave.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.890
- So that was the first Gulf War,

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.800
so-called Operation Desert Storm,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.770
as President Bush said there,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.800
it was it was authorized.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.350
This is resolution 678

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.070
which I will post and you
can peruse at your leisure.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.070
I do wanna notice that, just
notice that it was authorized

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.530
by the Security Council with
Cuba and Yemen voting against.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.060
They were temporary members
of the Security Council.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.310
The way the security council works is,

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.630
any one of the five permanent
members can veto it,

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.120
and China chose to abstain
but it didn't veto it,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.540
and the Soviet Union supported it.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.490
So...

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.820
I wanna, I start with this

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.090
'cause I wanna point out several things

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.490
about what Bush did.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.050
He certainly was, the US
was certainly not blameless

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.680
in this whole affair,

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.630
and I don't want to
sugar coat every aspect

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.390
of what President Bush did in this regard.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.210
He was heavily criticized later

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.990
for having apparently
signaled to Saddam Hussein

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.050
that it would be okay with the
US if they went into Kuwait,

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.310
he was also criticized for
encouraging a Shiite uprising

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.740
in southern Kuwait and
then not supporting it

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.800
after we left,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.930
so there there are grounds
for criticizing what we did

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.170
but the things I wanna point out is,

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.990
first of all, it was an
action of last resort,

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.130
every effort, as he said in the video,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:26.440
had been made to end
this without an invasion.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.010
Secondly, it was proportional,

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.860
stop the bully without becoming one.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.920
Bush took a lot of criticism for this.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.770
People said, you should go to Baghdad,

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.800
you should knock off this regime,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.683
and he steadfastly refused to do it,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.190
partly because of the fact

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.730
that he was not behaving unilaterally.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.700
As he indicated, there
was genuine coalition

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.730
including every Arab
country except Jordan,

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.430
was actually participating in this,

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.430
and he knew that if he did
more than the UN mandate,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.460
the Security Council resolution mandated,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.573
the coalition would collapse.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.590
So it was a broad-based coalition

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.170
with strong regional support

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:20.170
to stop the bully
without becoming a bully,

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.680
that is to say, this
aggression will not tolerated.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.410
And this, as I said,

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.350
was the first international
security crisis

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.010
of the post-Cold War world.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.350
And had that become the
template going forward,

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.700
we would be in a very
different place today.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.820
Well, that's one of the
things I'm going to be arguing

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.290
to you later in the course
because, as it turns out,

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.860
it was one of the paths not taken

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.290
to treat the way in which Saddam Hussein

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.590
had been expelled from Kuwait

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.030
as perhaps norm-setting
for the future handling

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.407
of international security crises,

00:15:00.407 --> 00:15:03.300
it was a path not taken.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.910
Okay, let's talk about NATO.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.000
What, when, and why?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.393
So NATO is a creature of the Cold War.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.820
And I've already mentioned

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.360
the United Nations several times today,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.740
and it's important to think about NATO

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.330
and the origins of NATO
alongside the creation

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.030
of the United Nations because
they were created both

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.327
in the 1940's.

00:15:32.324 --> 00:15:33.380
After World War I,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.350
Woodrow Wilson had wanted to
create a League of Nations

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.590
and that had failed,

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.160
largely because the American Congress

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.445
wouldn't go along with it

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.670
and FDR had, during World War II,

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.330
greatly invested in the idea

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.330
that there must be an
institution of this general sort

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.850
created after World War
II to prevent nations

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.300
from going to war.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.860
And when President
Truman came into office,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.860
he made it his business to
make sure that that happened.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.790
And so here, you can see President Truman

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.627
addressing the conference in
San Francisco in April of 1945

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.823
as they were drawing up
the charter of the UN.

00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:31.840
- There were many who
doubted that agreement

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.870
could ever be reached
by these fifty countries

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.840
differing so much in race and religion,

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.583
in language and culture.

00:16:42.716 --> 00:16:46.400
But these differences were all forgotten

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.500
in one unshakable unity of determination,

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.835
to find a way to end wars.

00:16:53.835 --> 00:16:56.540
(audience applauding)

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.020
If we had had this
charter a few years ago,

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.950
and above all, the will to use it,

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.123
millions now dead would be alive.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:10.860
If we should falter in the
future in our will to use it,

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.603
millions now living will surely die.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.740
Well, there is a time for making plans,

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.100
and there is a time for action.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.133
The time for action is here now!

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.870
- And indeed, they did act,

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.820
they did create the institutions,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.890
and just to elaborate
what he said later on

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.417
in that speech, he said,

00:17:35.417 --> 00:17:37.197
"The essence of our problem here

00:17:37.197 --> 00:17:40.187
"is to provide sensible
machinery for the settlement

00:17:40.187 --> 00:17:42.127
"of disputes among nations.

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:44.857
"Without this, peace cannot exist.

00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:48.737
"We can no longer permit any
nation, or group of nations,

00:17:48.737 --> 00:17:51.247
"to attempt to settle their arguments

00:17:51.247 --> 00:17:54.350
"with bombs and bayonets."

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.450
So he was foursquare behind the creation

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.750
as the US was, unlike after World War I,

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.310
the creation of the United Nations.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:08.030
But time moves on and four years later,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.653
we were looking at a
very different reality.

00:18:12.546 --> 00:18:14.559
(triumphant music)

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:18.220
- For us, war is not inevitable.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.150
We do not believe that
there are blind tides

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.173
of history which sweep
men one way or another.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.950
In our own time,

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.980
we've seen brave men overcome obstacles

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.860
that seemed insurmountable

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.420
and forces that seemed overwhelming.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.840
Men with courage and vision

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.970
can still determine their own destiny.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.943
They can choose slavery
our freedom, war or peace.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.933
I have no doubt which they will choose.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.640
The treaty we are signing here today

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.580
is evidence of the path they will follow.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.300
If there is anything certain today,

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.630
if there is anything
inevitable in the future,

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.107
it is the will of the people

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:04.253
of the world for freedom and for peace.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.460
- So there was the creation of NATO,

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.460
an alliance to face down what
was seen as the Soviet threat.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.670
The previous month, just after the text

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.920
of the proposed treaty had
been released to the public,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.460
Secretary of State, Dean
Acheson went on radio.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.580
And I tried to, I was gonna
play his radio speech for you

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.950
but the sound was too bad.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.117
But here, you can see him saying that,

00:19:37.117 --> 00:19:39.940
"The best deterrent to
aggression is the certainty

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.290
that immediate and
effective countermeasures

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.730
will be taken against those
who violate the peace."

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.420
And then probably the most
quoted line he ever uttered

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.187
was that, "If the free
nations do not stand together,

00:19:54.187 --> 00:19:58.030
"they will fall one by one."

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.220
So here, the US had moved

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.650
from backing an international institution

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.560
for solving conflicts
to forming an alliance.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.550
And just what was this alliance?

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:15.367
The most famous part of the
NATO Charter is Article 5

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.430
which says that the parties
agree that an armed attack

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.110
on one of them in Europe or North America

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.160
shall be considered an
attack against all of them

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.140
and consequently, that if
such an armed attack occurs,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.630
each of them, in the exercise of the right

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.890
of individual collective self-defense,

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.810
recognized by Article
51 of the UN Charter,

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.890
will assist the party
or parties so attacked

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.900
by taking forthwith,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.430
individually and in
concert with other parties,

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.420
such action as it deems necessary,

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.530
including the use of
armed force to restore

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:02.530
and maintain the security
of the North Atlantic area.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.730
And any such armed attack
and all measures taken

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.840
as a result thereof shall
immediately be reported

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.750
to the Security Council.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.910
And, this is an important kicker,

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.250
such measures shall be terminated

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:19.410
when the Security Council has
taken the measures necessary

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:24.410
to restore and maintain
international peace and security.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.430
So here is an alliance created

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.790
that says an attack on
one is an attack on all.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.740
We are entitled to protect any member

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.560
of that alliance as though
we had been attacked,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.110
we will report it to the Security Council

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:47.110
but we will not cease and desist
until the Security Council

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.050
has taken the measures necessary,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.680
essentially, to eliminate the threat.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.630
So not only had the US
created this new alliance,

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.720
but it clearly said that the UN,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.593
a realist might say this is
exactly what you should expect,

00:22:06.718 --> 00:22:11.718
a realist would say that
the UN is subordinate

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.390
to the interest of NATO.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.670
Now, it tells you how
hard boiled the realist,

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:21.670
Kennan, was that he was also
against NATO for two reasons.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.930
One is that he thought it
would unnecessarily militarize

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.790
the standoff with the Soviets,

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.340
they would create a similar alliance

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.320
which they indeed did a few years later,

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.620
that's where the Warsaw Pact came from,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.530
was the Soviet response to NATO,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.370
but he also said it's stupid,

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.080
because when the chips are down,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.960
countries follow their own interests,

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.960
they're no more gonna be guided
by membership of an alliance

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.980
then they are gonna be
guided by UN resolutions.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.241
Nonetheless, the US created NATO.

00:22:57.241 --> 00:23:00.050
The first thing to say about NATO

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.660
is it's a historically unprecedented,

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.480
highly unusual alliance.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.750
If you think about George
Washington's Farewell Address

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.010
to Congress in 1796, he said,

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.777
and this was seen as a
warning for the future,

00:23:15.777 --> 00:23:18.517
"It is our true policy to steer clear

00:23:18.517 --> 00:23:22.327
"of permanent alliance with any portion

00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:24.252
"of the foreign world."

00:23:24.252 --> 00:23:29.252
If you Google up things like
international encumbrances,

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:36.080
you can find American president
after American presidents

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.450
saying we will not commit
ourselves to any encumbrance

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.980
on a long term or permanent basis.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.180
And they all echo this philosophy

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.090
that was once attributed
to Lord Palmerston

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.637
from a famous speech he made
in the House of Commons in 1846

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.357
when he said, "We have no eternal allies,

00:23:58.357 --> 00:24:00.617
"we have no perpetual enemies.

00:24:00.617 --> 00:24:03.347
"Our interests," another
hard boiled realist,

00:24:03.347 --> 00:24:05.347
"are eternal and perpetual,

00:24:05.347 --> 00:24:09.670
"and those interest it
is our duty to follow."

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.820
So American presidents have been guided,

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.180
American administrations
had ever formed any kind

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.540
of permanent alliance,

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:23.540
that essentially followed the
Palmerston Washington view.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.200
And here, we have the creation

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.743
of an alliance among the western powers,

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:37.290
dedicated to protecting
one another in perpetuity

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.650
with armed force, if necessary,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.210
and subordinating
international institutions

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.503
to that purpose.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.730
Now, a lotta debate about whether NATO

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.983
was successful during the Cold War.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.480
You could say, well,
the US won the Cold War

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.180
and some people say, you could say

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.170
that we wouldn't have won it without NATO.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.470
That's one of the, we can't
run the counterfactual,

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.300
so it really is something
of an imponderable,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.850
whether we could have won
the Cold War without NATO.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.960
It is also worth noticing that NATO,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.330
during the Cold War, never
actually went into battle.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.140
The first time a NATO operation occurred,

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.090
which I'm gonna talk more
about later in the course,

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.340
was in Kosovo in 1999,
after the Cold War over.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.640
And by the way, when
Article 5 was not created

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.640
because no NATO country was threatened.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.070
And that same thing is true
with subsequent NATO actions

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.340
in the post-Cold War period,

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.750
such as the invasion of Libya in 2012,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.110
about which we'll also
be spending time later.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:55.140
The partial exception was 9/11,

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.660
although even then, the US, essentially,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.160
went to war more or less
immediately after the attacks

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.430
and NATO allies participated

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.970
but NATO didn't assume
full operational control

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.693
in Afghanistan until several years later.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.563
So NATO after the Cold War.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.620
Some people such as French
President Francois Mitterrand

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:29.093
said, well, it's done its
job, we should get rid of it,

00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:33.690
and was there to protect these countries

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:34.930
against the Soviet Union,

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.423
and it's now an alliance
without a purpose.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.360
That was a difficult thing to do right

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.073
at the end of the Cold War
because of East Germany.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.090
And the thing about East Germany

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:54.440
was it rapidly became clear
after the wall came down

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.710
that Germany was gonna be reunited,

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:01.710
and it was just, unstoppable
force to reunite Germany.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.503
And reuniting Germany made
a lot of people nervous.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.005
Many people remembered World War II

00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:16.005
and some, not that few,
also remembered World War I,

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.780
and the idea of an independent Germany,

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.540
outside of NATO, made a
lot of Europeans nervous.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:29.540
And so the impetus to
say the reunified Germany

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.910
would be part of NATO came
from the other European powers.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.433
And the Russians didn't like it.

00:27:41.439 --> 00:27:44.410
They, too, said, what's going on here,

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.340
why is NATO starting to expand?

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.930
And George Herbert Walker
Bush and Helmut Kohl,

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.920
who was then the German Chancellor,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.920
promised Gorbachev that
NATO would not expand

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.480
beyond including Germany
and that'd been an artifact

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.023
of the reunification.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.823
Gorbachev was less than
impressed by their reasoning.

00:28:13.338 --> 00:28:15.420
(speaking in foreign language)

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.360
- [Translator] And I'm not
persuaded by the assurances

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.839
that we hear, that Russia
has nothing to worry about.

00:28:21.839 --> 00:28:26.390
You may not humiliate a nation, a people,

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.260
and think that it'll have no consequences.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.913
So my question is, is this a new strategy?

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.510
I feel that if the same kind
of games continue to be played,

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.470
if one country plays some card
against the other country,

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.240
then all of those problems,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.780
all of those issues that
we've been mentioning today

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.070
will be very difficult to resolve.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:56.720
Glasnost, free elections,
political pluralism,

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.963
the problems of concern to you.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.740
- So he was skeptical.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:07.740
He thought that this is
not likely to be how things

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.500
are gonna play out but he did,

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.390
he saw this, as he says in that clip,

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.650
he saw this as a humiliation of Russia,

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.320
that was still the Soviet
Union at that time.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.790
He saw this as a humiliation
of the Soviet Union

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:27.093
and was adamantly opposed to it.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.830
But history played out differently.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.153
So let me just give you a
sense of what was coming now.

00:29:39.312 --> 00:29:42.895
(camera shutters clicking)

00:29:45.454 --> 00:29:47.871
(applauding)

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.403
- Today, we welcome Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic,

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.240
finally erasing the
boundary line the Cold War

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.023
artificially imposed on
the continent of Europe.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.020
Strengthening an alliance that now,

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.140
clearly, is better
preserved the keep the peace

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.633
and preserve our security
into the 21st century.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:23.810
For the 16 of us already in
NATO, enlarging our alliance,

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.220
our goal is to help to build a Europe

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.120
that is undivided, free,
democratic, at peace, and secure.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.650
- So there you have it.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:42.120
The first three east European countries

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.380
included in NATO in 1999,

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.810
and that, as you can see,

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:53.810
is the first edition of countries besides,

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.590
Germany's not on this list,

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.703
since the end of the Cold War.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.670
So this didn't go down
very well in Russia.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.870
As Gorbachev had predicted,

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.283
it produced a sense of
outrage and humiliation.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.940
So here, again, just to
give you some, a couple of,

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.493
a little flavor of it.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:23.287
(chanting in foreign language)

00:32:02.249 --> 00:32:06.166
(speaking in foreign language)

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.520
- So a couple of comments about that clip.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.200
So one is, on the signs, one of the things

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.350
that they're demonstrating
about is that president Clinton

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:28.350
had bombed Iraq for
violating the no-fly zones,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.300
and they're saying, basically,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:38.250
only an idiot or worse
would be bombing Iraq,

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.830
the no-fly zones that had been set up

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:45.830
following Saddam Hussein's
invasion from Kuwait.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.480
This gentleman at the end
of the clip is somebody

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.340
by the name of Sergey Baburin.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.440
He was a Soviet Russian politician

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.120
and subsequently became one of the leaders

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.070
of a far right populist movement,

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.210
and what he's saying at
the end of that clip,

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.686
is he's basically saying,

00:33:09.686 --> 00:33:14.390
we made a mistake once
but the next generation

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.610
are not gonna be making the same mistakes.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.250
And it's interesting that he said this

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.920
in response to them demonstrating

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.810
against the American bombing of Iraq,

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.680
partly because, as I noticed in 1991

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.950
when I was in Moscow and
I just told you about

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:40.910
in an early lecture, the
US Desert Storm Operation

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.990
was hugely popular among Russians in 1991.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.280
In 1991, the US could do no wrong.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.540
In fact, in Moscow in 1991,

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.420
in March of 1991,

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.340
there were actually commercials

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.048
for selling Desert Storm condoms.

00:34:03.048 --> 00:34:03.881
(audience laughing)

00:34:03.881 --> 00:34:04.714
Go figure.

00:34:05.613 --> 00:34:06.446
(professor laughing)

00:34:06.446 --> 00:34:08.330
I never quite could understand

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.643
what it was trying to communicate but.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.879
There had been no resistance to the idea

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:21.350
that Bush Sr. had gone in but, you know,

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:26.350
seven years later, when
these east European countries

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:32.260
were starting to join in, to join NATO,

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.140
things played out very differently.

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.763
And it didn't stop there, it continued.

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:44.413
(applauding)

00:34:45.767 --> 00:34:47.017
- [Woman] Yeah!

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:49.923
- Thank you, all.

00:34:49.923 --> 00:34:51.697
- [Man] Thank you Mr. President!

00:34:51.697 --> 00:34:53.114
- You're welcome.

00:34:54.695 --> 00:34:56.290
Thank you all.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:57.410
Thank you all, good afternoon,

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:58.960
and welcome to the White House.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:05.444
Today we proudly welcome Bulgaria,

00:35:05.444 --> 00:35:06.930
(audience cheering)

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:07.996
Estonia,

00:35:07.996 --> 00:35:09.720
(audience cheering)

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.680
Latvia,

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.190
(audience cheering)

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.287
Lithuania,

00:35:13.287 --> 00:35:15.600
(audience cheering)

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.654
Romania,

00:35:16.654 --> 00:35:17.608
(audience cheering)

00:35:17.608 --> 00:35:18.603
Slovakia, and Slovenia.

00:35:19.882 --> 00:35:22.940
(audience cheering)

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.780
We welcome them into the ranks

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.452
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

00:35:27.452 --> 00:35:29.869
(applauding)

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.760
When NATO was founded, the
people of these seven nations

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.603
were captives to an empire.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.033
They endured bitter tyranny.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.113
They struggled for independence.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.123
They earned their freedom
through courage and perseverance.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.470
And today, they stand with
us as full and equal partners

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.644
in this great alliance.

00:36:03.644 --> 00:36:06.061
(applauding)

00:36:17.229 --> 00:36:18.062
(pen thudding)

00:36:18.062 --> 00:36:18.895
(laughing)

00:36:18.895 --> 00:36:21.500
(applauding)

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.110
This is a special moment

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.250
in the hopeful story of human liberty

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.720
as America formally declares its support

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.963
for Albania and Croatia's entry into NATO.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.470
We strengthen America's
partnership with nations

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:40.123
that once found themselves
in the shackles of communism.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.330
We rejoice in taking a major step

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.720
toward welcoming the people
of Albania and Croatia

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.900
into the greatest alliance

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.580
for freedom the world has ever known.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.890
- And I want to reaffirm
as strongly as I can,

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.440
the United States'
commitment to honor Article 5

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.200
of the NATO treaty.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:05.200
No ally or adversary should
ever question our determination

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.520
on this point.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.560
It is the bedrock of the alliance,

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:14.200
and an obligation that
time will not erode.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.810
The NATO membership process,

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.190
which requires applicants to make reforms

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:21.350
across their political,
economic, and defense sectors,

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:25.670
has helped create the stable
democratic Europe we see today.

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.060
We were glad to see the
alliance welcome Albania

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.400
and Croatia last year,

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.460
and there can be no question
that NATO will continue

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.730
to keep its door open to new members.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:41.040
- Montenegro's accession
is good for Montenegro,

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.190
it's good for NATO, it's
good for the stability

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.090
of the western Balkans,

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:50.240
and it's good for international
peace and security.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.610
Today is a historic day.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:56.330
So, President Vujanovic,
welcome so much to NATO,

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.340
it's a great honor to
have you here, welcome.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:03.010
- With NATO membership,
our future will be stable,

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:07.700
secure and prosperous,
and we will make decisions

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.520
about the most important
issues within the strongest,

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.030
the most organized, and
most efficient alliance

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.853
in the history of mankind.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.830
- So as you can see,

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.760
this had been a bipartisan
story on the US side.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.760
Democrats and Republicans
alike have led the expansion

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:36.060
of NATO to include all
of the former members

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:39.250
of the Warsaw Pact except for Russia.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.050
And this actually doesn't
tell the whole story

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:47.050
because there were others who
wanted to join NATO as well.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.730
So in 2008, for example,

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.520
NATO announced that it
would welcome the addition

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.940
of Georgia and Ukraine to NATO.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:03.940
And that is part of what
prompted the Russian incursion

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.050
into Georgia in 2008,

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.840
and also had a big impact
in Ukrainian politics

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:17.840
that contributed to the way
things would play out in 2014.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:24.420
A couple of other things to
notice about this accession,

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.720
you might wonder why, in 2004,

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.430
we added all of these countries to NATO.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.630
Why do you think, anyone have a thought?

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.730
Why would the Bush administration,

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.500
many east European countries
wanted to join NATO

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.740
from very early on but
there had been resistance.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.330
I mean, after all, you know,
you're committing yourself

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.820
to go to war if one of
these countries is attacked.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.030
That's not a light thing, right?

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.990
You're actually, it's not like saying,

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.240
well, let them join the European Union,

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.730
if they don't like it, we'll kick 'em out,

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.770
or they can leave.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.460
This is really committing you

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.980
to defend these countries.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.352
Why would the US, anyone?

00:40:07.352 --> 00:40:08.320
(student mumbling)

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.322
Pardon?
- Deflection.

00:40:10.322 --> 00:40:14.071
(mumbles) Suppression in the Middle East.

00:40:14.071 --> 00:40:16.420
- It was related to what he was doing

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.170
in the Middle East but
it was not deflection.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:24.170
What had we just done in
the Middle East in 2004?

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.190
Yeah.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.620
- [Student] We had just invaded Iraq

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:32.240
and then the former (mumbling)

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.790
were not supportive (mumbling).

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:36.530
- Bingo, exactly right.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:41.330
So what had happened was, after,

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.890
and this is something we will
return to later in the course,

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:47.600
but once the Bush Jr., George W. Bush,

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.943
had decided to invade Iraq in 2003,

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.560
unlike what his father had done,

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.560
he couldn't get Security Council
resolution to authorize it

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:05.690
and he had a lot of trouble
putting together a coalition

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.610
because all the Middle Eastern
countries were not in favor

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:13.120
of it and he needed the fig leaf

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.867
of an international coalition to create,

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.780
he thought, legitimacy for this action.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.810
And so if you look at
all of these countries,

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:29.980
except Slovenia, every
one of these countries

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.050
joined the coalition, nominally at least,

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:37.370
and sent troops to Iraq as part

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:42.370
of the US-led coalition of the willing.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.580
They joined the coalition of the willing

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.360
and the quid for the quo

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.540
was that he supported their accession

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.240
to NATO the following year.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.570
Interestingly though, they all got rid

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:00.660
of the draft in the meantime.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.150
Clearly, they were worried
about the domestic politics

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.840
of committing their
youth to fighting in wars

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.480
to defend NATO countries.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:17.480
So here, you see that
geopolitics playing itself out

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.480
in this way, that this is very much

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.080
an interest-based story,

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.760
that Bush is looking to get legitimation

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.210
for his invasion, and so
that became the impetus

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.233
for getting these countries to join.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.200
It's also, one might think
it's something of an anomaly,

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:46.290
given the Trump administration's hostility

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:48.460
to NATO in general,

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:53.000
why they allowed the
Montenegro thing to go forward.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.960
Of course, it'd been started much earlier

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.060
but I think, as far as Trump is concerned,

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.183
it doesn't really matter who's in NATO.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:07.750
Nonetheless, the question
that Trump asks about NATO

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:10.460
is not a crazy question, right?

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.290
And it's the same question
Francois Mitterrand

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:17.853
was asking, what is this
alliance there actually for?

00:43:19.234 --> 00:43:22.170
So there's some enduring questions

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:24.340
about post-Cold War NATO

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.600
which are gonna come
back later in the course.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.290
One is, was Mitterrand right?

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:35.290
Was there a missed opportunity
at the end of the Cold War?

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:38.080
Was Gorbachev right?

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.000
Did NATO expansion make it more likely

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.900
that someone like Putin would
come to power in Russia?

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.870
Gorbachev had said,

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.943
humiliate people and there
will be consequences.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.940
And certainly, the steady inclusion

00:43:55.631 --> 00:44:00.610
of NATO into the former,

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:01.917
not only Eastern Europe,

00:44:01.917 --> 00:44:05.100
but as I said, they were
running up trial balloons

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:10.050
about incorporating the
Ukraine and Georgia in 2008.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.700
There's a colorable case

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:18.700
that this might have
bolstered the nationalism

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.170
of a figure like Putin.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.103
We'll come back to that, too.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:28.140
And what are the advantages and costs

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.680
of having a permanent military alliance

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.678
that now lacks any clear
motivating purpose?

00:44:34.678 --> 00:44:38.800
It's led by the most
powerful military on Earth,

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.253
it's not clear what its goal is or is not.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.310
We will see later in the course that,

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.920
when it has become active,

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.470
it has had nothing to do with
Article 5 of the NATO treaty,

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:55.340
but it's rather taken on new missions

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.360
and new rationales, mostly ad hoc,

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.130
dreamed up on the fly,
to suit the interests

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:05.003
of different players at different times.

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.640
Let's turn to the Washington Consensus,

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.800
or what I'll say, taking
neo-liberalism global.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.460
And I'll talk somewhat briefly about this

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.580
'cause I want to spend most

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:22.490
of the rest of the time talking
about the European Union.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.380
So the Washington Consensus, again,

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:31.130
and what I call the Washington
Consensus is essentially,

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:35.210
a global version of what often
gets called neo-liberalism.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.270
And I think of it, again,

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:39.170
distilling it down and getting rid

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:43.500
of all the jargon that
plagues these discussions,

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.290
as having three main features.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.103
One is deregulation,

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.190
the second is free trade
or trade agreements,

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.420
and the third is
privatization of state assets,

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.220
previously held, state-held assets.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.523
Within countries, that tends
to be called neo-liberalism.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:05.740
When the World Bank or the IMF

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.240
or the Americans try
to get other countries,

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.780
as they did particularly up
until the financial crisis,

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.000
when the Washington Consensus, we'll see,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
started to lose some of its
ideological power in the world,

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.930
the core elements of the diet

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.430
on which they would insist for countries

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:33.430
to get US aid or aid from
institutions controlled

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:36.233
by the World Bank or the IMF.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:42.290
And it's difficult to
overstate the confidence,

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.540
the hubris, we might say in retrospect,

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.827
the confidence with which this was viewed

00:46:50.827 --> 00:46:55.827
as the one size fits all approach

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.070
to economic development.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:03.700
In 2004, in a speech to
the the New York Fed,

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.450
I think it was to the New York Fed,

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:10.590
Ben Bernanke, who was then
Chairman of the Federal Reserve,

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.490
made a speech that you could,

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:16.660
if you Google up his great
moderation so-called speech,

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.060
it's a speech in which he says,

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.370
essentially, the
technocrats running the fed

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:26.463
are now sufficiently competent that we've,

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.720
well, he didn't actually say this

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.190
but this is what it's
come to be interpreted

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.220
as his having said.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.300
What he actually said
was somewhat more nuanced

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:42.770
but the takeaway lines
from the speech are,

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:46.140
to the effect that the fed
has basically managed to,

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.660
if not abolish the business cycle,

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:53.210
manage it so successfully
that the peaks and troughs

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.660
could not be too damaging and we can,

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.580
largely, have no
inflation, full employment,

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.000
and let the technocrats run it.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.340
As I said, what he actually said,

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.830
if you go and read the whole speech,

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:08.290
was a little more nuanced than that.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.900
But it became emblematic of the idea

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:16.900
that this diet of economic deregulation,

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:22.080
free trade, and privatization,
informing all public policy,

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.460
was the way to go,

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:30.453
and that the world would
be hunky-dory thereafter.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:34.270
Deregulation of Wall Street

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:38.613
after the repeal of Glass-Steagal in 1999.

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:44.900
So here, the Glass-Steagal
Act had been enacted

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:49.900
in the 1930's in the wake of
the Depression to stop trading,

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:56.240
to stop investment banks
from engaging in investments

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:00.360
on their own accounts
with depositor's money.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.180
You either had to be an investment bank

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.540
or a commercial bank.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.740
The banks didn't like it,

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:08.000
they lobbied against it for decades

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.310
and actually, by the time
it was repealed in 1999,

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.640
there wasn't much of it left.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.910
Read Ron Chernow's "The House of Morgan"

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:21.910
if you want the blow-by-blow
of the lobbying about that.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.840
Brilliant book among his
many brilliant books.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.990
And so, this great debate now,

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:34.240
about how much actually getting rid

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.130
of Glass-Steagal contributed
to the financial crisis,

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.210
some say not at all,

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:42.720
some say it was really all
about real estate markets

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.970
and had nothing to do with that,

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:45.520
and some say a lot.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.240
But my point in mentioning it here

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.810
is not whether repealing
Glass-Steagal contributed

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:52.880
to the financial crisis,

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.980
I tend to think probably not,

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:59.980
but it was emblematic of and
ushered in a whole other set

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.150
of steps of deregulation.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:06.620
So, for instance, in 2004 Hank Paulson,

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.930
who was then Chairman of Goldman Sachs,

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:14.200
led a group of the five
biggest banks to Washington

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.353
to lobby Christopher Cox,

00:50:18.362 --> 00:50:20.470
who was then the head of the SEC,

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:23.103
not the sharpest knife in congress,

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.230
to lobby him on the grounds

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:31.230
that if a bank was sufficiently big,

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.740
if it had five billion dollars in assets,

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.740
it should be exempted
from capital requirements

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.830
or have reduced capital requirements

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.810
because they were big
enough to self-insure.

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:47.020
The thought that because they were so big

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:50.300
is maybe why they should
have the capital requirements

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.573
didn't seem to occur to him.

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:57.990
And so the ones that were too big to fail

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:02.440
were the ones that were subjected to less

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.970
in the way of capital requirements.

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.720
And we might say, go figure,

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.830
how could anybody be so foolish?

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.490
The quid for the quo, by the way,

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:14.170
they said, we'll open our books to you.

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:18.960
But the SEC at that time
had a tiny office with,

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.830
I think it was seven people working in it,

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:24.150
ostensibly, to keep track

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:26.460
of four trillion dollars worth of assets.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:28.820
So they weren't gonna be able to do this

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.670
in any serious way,

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:32.630
monitor the books of these companies.

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:36.950
And indeed, months before
the financial crisis,

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:40.360
literally, two or three months
before the financial crisis,

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:44.310
Cox was reassuring
congress that the big banks

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:47.200
were fundamentally sound and then,

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.600
turned around and Lehman
Brothers went belly-up.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.820
But I'm not giving you as story

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.640
about the causes of the financial crisis,

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.340
but I'm giving you a story
about the confidence people had

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.400
in this deregulatory enterprise,

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.640
that, just leave it all to the Fed,

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.670
get rid of all the regulations,
and everything will be fine.

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:14.680
And so this was the
new-liberal game at home

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:19.680
and it was the Washington
Consensus taken abroad.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.310
There was much more resistance to it

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:26.653
in what we might think
if as the Global South.

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.670
This is just one of endless numbers

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:33.470
of cartoons one could pick up put out,

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:36.590
indicating that it was perceived

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:40.680
as a kind of imperialist venture
from the point of view of,

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.830
particularly, developing countries

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.640
that were having this
diet imposed upon them.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.300
But in the second and first worlds,

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:55.300
the hegemony of this idea
was, it's hard to overstate.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.450
And if you, I always talking
about Russia last time,

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:05.450
if you look at US aid to Russia,

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.850
it gives you some sense also, I think,

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:13.650
as a kind of proxy for
American influence over Russia.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.630
You can see that at the collapse

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:20.370
of the Soviet Union in '92, '93,

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:25.370
that you get huge amounts
of US assistance to Russia.

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:33.660
And then it goes down and then, in 1998,

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.990
when they default, this is run
Russia defaulted on its debt,

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:38.980
I talked about that last time,

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.630
and just bailed out by the IMF,

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:44.300
you see it increase again and then,

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:49.300
in the early 2000's, it goes
down after the crisis wanes

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:55.610
and then, here, and this
is the period when Putin

00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:59.690
is basically implementing the
Washington Consensus diet.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.980
This is when he's
reforming the tax system,

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.130
it's when he bringing tax rates

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:08.390
down to 13% flat rate,
balancing the books,

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:11.740
building up a massive
sovereign wealth fund

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.133
or a rainy day fund.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
And so he's essentially
getting rewarded for following

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:24.710
what many would have
regarded as pretty orthodox,

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:29.080
pretty orthodox Washington
Consensus policies

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.620
and the best book about
this is by a man by the name

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.250
of Christopher Miller which
I put on the suggested

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:37.607
reading list, called "Putinomics".

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:42.920
But then you can see, and this
is for later in the course,

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.980
what happens after the financial crisis.

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.870
Not only does US aid go south,

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:52.960
but so does US influence,

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.653
and we'll talk more about that later.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.920
So let's talk about the European
Union and its challenges.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.530
It's been around since early 1950's.

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:11.930
The European Coal and Steel
Community came into being

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:14.870
as a byproduct of the Treaty of Paris

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:17.430
signed by the original six;

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:19.610
France, Italy, the
Netherlands, West Germany,

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.583
Belgium and Luxembourg.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.190
It became the European Economic Community

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:30.493
as a result of the Rome Treaty of 1957.

00:55:31.906 --> 00:55:35.800
A much more ambitious
treaty was enacted in 1992,

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.550
the so-called Maastricht Treaty.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:42.177
And the most recent piece
of legal architecture,

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.120
which I 'll talk a little
bit more about in a minute,

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.670
was the the Lisbon Treaty of 2007.

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:53.910
I'm not gonna give you the blow-by-blow

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:56.330
of how all the 28 countries,

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:59.350
how they got from six to 28,

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.940
but you can Google it
up for yourself and see

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:04.950
when the different ones joined.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.850
What I want us to do is focus more on,

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:09.225
what was the point of this?

00:56:09.225 --> 00:56:13.940
Why was a European Union
thought to be necessary?

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.793
What purpose would it serve?

00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:18.374
Yeah.

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.626
- [Student] Economic and political union

00:56:20.626 --> 00:56:25.237
between European countries
could stave off, like,

00:56:25.237 --> 00:56:26.670
war in the future.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:27.690
- To stave off war.

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:30.630
So there were multiple motives

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:34.430
but it's good that you're clairvoyant

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:36.590
and got the first item on my slide

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:37.690
'cause what if you had come up

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.400
with the third item on my slide?

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.970
I would've been crossed off

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:42.530
but you came out with the first item,

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:43.753
so that's fantastic.

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:48.303
So part of the impetus was,

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:51.000
particularly people were worried

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.680
about France and Germany
going to war again.

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.340
Not only the French and the Germans,

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.760
Churchill, for example, was a big fan

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.240
of the European Coal and Steel Community

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.480
and he didn't want Britain to join

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.540
but he wanted the Europeans to join,

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.400
partly for that reason.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:12.400
So that was a beginning
part of the initial impetus.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.630
This is for the political
philosophers in the room,

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.510
this is Montesquieu's idea of
(speaks in foreign language),

00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:24.140
that if you have commercial
interchange with a country,

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.380
it's gonna be peace-generating, right?

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.652
So that was one.

00:57:29.652 --> 00:57:33.700
Other reasons why people might
have favored the creation?

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.088
Yeah.
- To reduce the pressure

00:57:36.088 --> 00:57:38.869
from the Soviet Union and (mumbles).

00:57:38.869 --> 00:57:42.404
- To reduce the pressure
from the Soviet Union and?

00:57:42.404 --> 00:57:43.730
- America.

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:46.160
- Okay so let's start,
let's take the second,

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:49.280
that this is less about the Soviet Union

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.100
and more about US 'cause
I want to keep you

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.042
on my slide, here.

00:57:54.042 --> 00:57:56.020
(audience laughing)

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.890
This was the big French motive.

00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:02.890
de Gaulle, for example, was
a big proponent of the idea

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:08.300
that what the Europeans needed to do

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:13.300
was to band together to be a
comparable force in the world

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.800
to the US, right?

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.830
Now, de Gaulle, I'm sure, as you all know,

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:22.620
was a staunch nationalist, right?

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:24.020
Staunch French nationalist,

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:27.240
so he did not want a political union

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:32.240
that could in any way erode
French national sovereignty.

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.680
He would be, I think,
chuckling at the Brexit fight

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.663
that's going on at the moment.

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:45.790
But the way in which de Gaulle

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.760
thought you could both have a strong,

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:52.960
united Europe and protect
the national sovereignty

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.200
of France, which they
guarded very jealously,

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.130
they kicked NATO troops out of France,

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:01.940
they bought their own,
independent nuclear deterrent,

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.940
they had a very jealous conception

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.840
of their independence and sovereignty

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:13.520
and they were not gonna be
pushed around by the Americans.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.220
So they came up with the idea

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:21.200
that any important changes in the union

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.800
would have to be resolved
by unanimity rule,

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.270
and of course unanimity rule

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:28.650
is a dictatorship of one, right?

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:30.800
If you have unanimity rule,

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.570
if you don't like the proposed change,

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.740
you can stop it and block it.

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:39.100
So de Gaulle was a strong proponent

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.220
of unanimity rule and so
this was this was the idea

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:47.220
of a big block that could be
of comparable economic clout

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.550
in the world to the US.

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:58.260
Any other reasons why people
might have thought it important

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:02.790
to have a big economic union

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:05.523
of countries, European countries?

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.133
- [Student] Trade.

01:00:10.133 --> 01:00:11.210
- Trade.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.760
You guys are amazing.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.593
(audience laughing)

01:00:13.593 --> 01:00:15.113
Wow, okay.

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:20.850
Yes, so but here's the
thing, it's complicated

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:25.100
because it's, and this is part of,

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.240
again, Trump administration's
beef about the EU,

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.950
it's an internal free-trade zone

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:35.030
but it's externally protectionist, right,

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.150
in many respects.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:39.090
You go and talk to African farmers

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:42.590
about the tariffs that
they experience trying

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:47.220
to sell their goods in Europe.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:51.820
So in this sense, and this
is one of the reasons Britain

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:56.820
had such a difficult time
before Britain finally

01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:01.930
joined under Edward Heath in the 1970's,

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:05.740
they had been rejected
twice because Britain

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.050
wanted to preserve its imperial preference

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:13.013
before they realized there
was no empire left to prefer.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.363
But they had essentially had,

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:21.890
they had had trading arrangements
with members of the empire

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.850
and then, when they
created the Commonwealth,

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:27.840
they wanted to have preferential treatment

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.410
for trade from the Commonwealth

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:33.530
and the European Union said,
no, they couldn't have that

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.850
and so the French, actually,

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:38.350
de Gaulle was flatly against Britain

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:40.937
joining the European Union and vetoed it

01:01:40.937 --> 01:01:44.963
and they didn't join until
after he left power in 1969.

01:01:47.196 --> 01:01:50.870
So it was an internally free trade

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:55.870
but externally, it was a
protectionist trading block

01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:00.300
and that incidentally,
we can fast forward,

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.083
it's the story of TPP,

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:09.130
that what the Trump administration
failed to understand

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:12.190
or at least to articulate
if they did understand it,

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:17.190
was that the TPP was not
just a free-trade deal,

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:22.690
it was about containing China
from developing its influence

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.740
in the Far East and it
was largely motivated,

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.250
actually, by a political
agenda because China,

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.440
for reasons we're gonna talk about later,

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.580
had become much more muscular
in the South China Sea

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:41.530
and elsewhere during the course
of the Obama administration.

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.960
So the EU, we could say,

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.850
is internal free-trade zone,
externally protectionist.

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.640
But actually, that's too
simple because the sense

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.550
in which it was internally
a free-trade area

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.580
is complicated because, as I put up here,

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.860
there was a first mover advantage.

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.614
And so if you think
back to what I just said

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:09.614
about de Gaulle insisting
on unanimity rule,

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.670
that meant that the things you
could put in place early on

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:18.500
would be very difficult to change

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.020
because you would have a veto power.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:26.020
And so the French didn't
agree to the British joining

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:31.370
until they had put in the
Common Agricultural Policy

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.350
and the Common Fisheries Policies.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:36.800
And particularly, the
Common Agricultural Policy

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:40.063
was massive protection for French farmers,

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:45.950
and was operated to the great disadvantage

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.030
of British farmers.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:53.030
And so it was a free-trade
zone with a difference.

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:59.100
And an interesting irony
of history here is that,

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.743
when Britain joined the
European Union in the '70's,

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.180
the British parties were a polar opposite

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.310
of what they are today about Europe.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:13.520
At that time, the Labor Party
was badly divided over Europe

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.890
and the Conservatives were
largely in favor of Europe

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:19.880
because Europe, the Tories thought,

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.950
would be an instrument for
disempowering British unions

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:27.120
and deregulating the economy

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.223
and making it function more efficiently.

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:35.210
Margaret Thatcher, a lot
of people don't know this,

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:36.780
Margaret Thatcher was one

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:41.010
of Ted Heath's most aggressive lieutenants

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:44.303
in getting Britain into
the European Union.

01:04:45.228 --> 01:04:47.813
She only became a Euro-skeptic later.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.583
Not only that, later,

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.120
about halfway through her administration,

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.760
Margaret Thatcher was the person

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.850
who pushed the European Union

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:05.240
toward qualified majority voting

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.730
on things like reducing
non-tariff barriers to trade

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:11.513
because she could see.

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:15.250
She had, earlier than before she did that,

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:20.250
she had negotiated big rebates for Britain

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.610
because of the unfairness of
the Common Agricultural Policy

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.500
and so on, so Britain was getting rebates

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.560
but she wanted, in her privatizing agenda,

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.770
which we're gonna be
concerned with in a couple

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:34.270
of weeks from now,

01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:39.270
she wanted more, what we
call, neo-liberal policies,

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.430
she wanted the reduction
of non-tariff barriers

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:44.790
to trade in Europe.

01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:47.010
It was completely obvious
you couldn't get that

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:49.700
with unanimity rule in the union

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.640
because whoever stood
to lose by getting rid

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.180
of these barriers to trade would veto.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:59.380
So they went to qualified majority voting

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:01.640
to make decisions in the European Union

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.063
at the behest of Margaret Thatcher.

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:09.490
So that's another reason

01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:14.400
that the European Union was created,

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.570
there was this internal free-trade zone

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:20.730
but with these wrinkles to it.

01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:25.400
A fourth reason, which is
much less intuitively obvious,

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.880
is that saw people saw
this as a counterweight

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.880
to some of the pressures of
their own domestic politics.

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:36.200
And I can give you a dramatic example

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.530
of this that I ran into at
a conference in Portugal

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.760
about three years ago,

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.277
when the rolling Euro crisis was going on

01:06:45.277 --> 01:06:50.150
and the southern European
countries were in extremis.

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:53.350
And a left wing German intellectual,

01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.280
sort of neo-Marxist by the
name of Klaus Hoffa stood up,

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.250
this was in Portugal,

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:05.667
and he gave a speech in which he said,

01:07:05.667 --> 01:07:07.587
"You know, we Germans are really screwing

01:07:07.587 --> 01:07:09.017
"you southern Europeans.

01:07:09.017 --> 01:07:10.237
"You should insist on being

01:07:10.237 --> 01:07:15.237
"let out of the Euro
because we're just forcing,

01:07:15.397 --> 01:07:19.237
"you should be able to
devalue your currencies

01:07:19.237 --> 01:07:22.767
"and re-equilibrate your
economies to get yourselves out

01:07:22.767 --> 01:07:26.850
"of this crisis and you can't
because of us nasty Germans."

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:31.850
So he thought he would get huge applause.

01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:35.670
And this Portuguese politician,
I don't speak portuguese,

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:38.460
she stood up and screamed at him.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.710
And evidently, he
understood enough Portuguese

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:44.650
to get the sense that
she was angry with him,

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:46.020
but not what he was saying.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.220
So he said, "I think you've
misunderstood what I'm saying."

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.163
And he said it again and she
screamed at him even more.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:55.990
So then, we went for lunch
and I was with a bunch

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:57.540
of economists and lawyers and I said,

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.910
"What was that about?"

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.450
And the economists all said,

01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:04.340
well, the Portuguese government knows

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:06.660
that, but for these constraints,

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:07.800
the Portuguese government

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.860
would be printing money hand over fist

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.300
and would have massive hyperinflation.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.380
And the lawyers all said,

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.550
you don't seem to understand.

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:19.130
Portugal has never been
able to be a democracy

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:21.530
outside of the European Union, right?

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:26.530
So these people saw it, actually,

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.260
the fact that this was a constraint

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.860
on Portugal was a good thing.

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.240
And in a less dramatic fashion,

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.360
even the Germans like
some of the constraints.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.800
And then finally, of course,

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.450
there was the idea of a
federal European state.

01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:47.450
This is the idea most famously associated

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:52.550
with Jacques Delors, of
an ever closer union,

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:56.800
it actually comes from a
declaration in Stuttgart,

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.580
signed in 1983, including
by the British, by the way.

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.620
The heads of state or
government on the basis

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.640
of an awareness of the common destiny

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.560
and the wish to affirm
the European identity,

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.150
confirm their commitment to progress

01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:13.750
toward an ever closer
union among the peoples

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:17.380
and member states of the community.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:20.710
So five motivations there.

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:22.523
What do they all share in common?

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.600
What's common, I mean,
it's a disparate list

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.200
but there's one thing in common.

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:34.542
Yeah.

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:36.640
- [Student] They have focus on Europe.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.510
- Their focus on Europe.

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:39.060
What's another thing in common?

01:09:41.499 --> 01:09:43.190
- [Student] A power in numbers?

01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:45.923
- Power in numbers, what's another thing?

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.620
So they're all examples,
there all from above,

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.063
they're an elite project,
if you think about it.

01:09:54.063 --> 01:09:59.063
They are the views of what
elites think should happen

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:04.727
in Europe and a symptom
of that happens in 2005

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.470
when the Maastricht had
created a constitution

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:13.270
that was gonna integrate Europe even more,

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:15.680
a much more close, ever closer union,

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.110
and as you can see,
France and the Netherlands

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:23.540
held referendums in
which it was voted down

01:10:24.435 --> 01:10:27.340
by the populations, the
European constitution

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.620
that had come out of Maastricht.

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:32.600
And that quickly led
the Czechs, the Danes,

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.600
the Irish, the Polish, the Portuguese,

01:10:38.647 --> 01:10:42.970
and the UK governments all
to cancel their referendums.

01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:47.260
And actually, the Lisbon
Treaty is a step back

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.240
from Maastricht because
Maastricht was really trying

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.530
to create a federal state
and the Lisbon Treaty steps

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:57.350
back to making it an
intergovernment arrangement.

01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:00.173
Very much a top-down enterprise.

01:11:01.593 --> 01:11:04.197
And so the implications of this are one,

01:11:04.197 --> 01:11:06.690
and this is, the chapter and verse of this

01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:09.570
is in Tony Judt's book, "Postwar",

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:11.770
which he published in 2005.

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:14.930
He died shortly thereafter
so he had a ready finished it

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:17.900
before these referendums
but the basic message

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:21.000
of that book about Europe is look out

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.560
when the first crisis hits

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:27.560
because there's no grassroots
support for this institution.

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.250
And what happened when
the first crisis did hit?

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.570
We'll talk about later
but the chapter and verse

01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:37.600
of that is in Adam
Tooze's book, "Crashed",

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.040
which is mainly a book
about the Eurozone crisis

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.280
and why the European governments

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.360
have been unable to resolve it.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.790
And again, it's to do with the fact

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:52.270
that this was an elite project,

01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:54.420
although he plays out the conflicts

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.670
of interest within the elites.

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:59.070
And then there's one
final thing I will mention

01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:03.100
before we close, and to
bring why have I been talking

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.743
about NATO and the European Union.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:12.320
So NATO is actually a
source of the obstacle

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.130
to a Pan-European identity

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:19.930
because they contract out
their national security.

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:22.553
If you think back to
the beginning of the US,

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:26.610
that we almost lost
the War of Independence

01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:30.970
because the states
wouldn't ante up soldiers

01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:33.600
and funds to fight the war.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.740
And the reason we created
the Federal Constitution

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.710
was to enable Washington to raise an army

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:44.610
so that he could defend itself

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.653
and pay its national debts.

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:51.440
Because Europe contracts out, essentially,

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.550
its national security to NATO

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:56.470
there's no European army,

01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:59.610
there's no sense that Europeans might

01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:02.790
have to go and die for
Europe in a way that,

01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:07.540
as a result of the transition
from the Confederation

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.610
to the United States of America,

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:13.370
we have created a national entity

01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:16.520
with people actually identify.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.240
So there's an irony there that,

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.020
actually, the strength of NATO

01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:25.040
can be an obstacle to the formation

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.010
of a Pan-European identity.

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:30.530
Okay, we're out of time and next,

01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:33.650
we will be talking about
fusing capitalist economics

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:37.663
with communist politics
in China and Vietnam.

01:13:40.454 --> 01:13:43.037
(gentle music)

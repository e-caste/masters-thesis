00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.290
Prof: Welcome to Roman
Architecture.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.263
I'm Professor Kleiner,
and what I'd like to do today

00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:12.017
is to give you a sense of some
of the great buildings and some

00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:17.160
of the themes that we will be
studying together this semester.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.685
I think it's important to note,
from the outset,

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:24.735
that Roman architecture is
primarily an architecture of

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:25.560
cities.
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.726
The Romans structured a
man-made, worldwide empire out

00:00:29.726 --> 00:00:34.137
of architectural forms,
and those architectural forms

00:00:34.137 --> 00:00:39.281
revolutionized the ancient world
and exerted a lasting influence

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:43.771
on the architecture and the
architects of post-classical

00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:44.670
times.
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.974
This semester we will be
concerned primarily with urban

00:00:48.974 --> 00:00:51.799
communities--
with urban communities--and we

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.318
will,
in the first half of this

00:00:53.318 --> 00:00:55.826
semester,
we will focus on the city of

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:59.765
Rome, and in the second--
and also central Italy,

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:01.478
including Pompeii.
 

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.520
And I wanted to show you,
at the outset,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.510
an aerial view of Rome--you see
it over here,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.549
on the left-hand side of the
screen--

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.209
that situates us in the very
core of the ancient city.

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:15.277
You see the famous Colosseum,
the very icon of Rome,

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:16.540
at the upper right.
 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.390
You see the Roman Forum,
as it looks today,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.390
and you see a part of the
Capitoline Hill,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.299
transformed by Michelangelo
into the famous Campidoglio,

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.340
as well as the Via dei Fori
Imperiali of Mussolini,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.620
built by Mussolini,
and the Imperial Fora.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.015
So the city of Rome again we'll
be concentrating on,

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.646
at the beginning of this
semester, as well as the city of

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:41.209
Pompeii.
 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.260
An aerial view of Pompeii,
as it looks today.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.277
You can see many of the
buildings of the city,

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:50.429
including the houses and the
shops, and also the

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.239
entertainment district.
 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:56.400
This is the theater and the
music hall of ancient Pompeii.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.750
The amphitheater is over here.
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.242
And you can see,
of course, looming up in the

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:05.606
background, Mount Vesuvius,
the mountain that caused all

00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:07.750
that trouble in 79 A.D.
 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.430
So that's the first half of the
semester.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.363
The second half of the semester
we are going to be going out

00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:16.151
into the provinces,
into the Roman provinces,

00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:19.252
and that is going to take us--
and we're going to look at the

00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:21.983
provinces both in the eastern
and the western part of the

00:02:21.983 --> 00:02:24.738
Empire--
and that will take us to Roman

00:02:24.738 --> 00:02:25.330
Greece.
 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.300
It will take us to Asia Minor;
Asia Minor, which of course is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.289
modern Turkey.
 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.410
It will take us to North Africa.
 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.710
It will take us to the Middle
East,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.758
in what's now Jordan and Syria,
and it will also take us to

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:43.673
Europe,
to western Europe,

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:48.669
to cities in France and to
cities in Spain.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.453
And let me just show you an
example of some of the buildings

00:02:51.453 --> 00:02:53.860
that we'll look at as we travel
to the provinces.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.360
This is the Library of Celsus,
in Ephesus, on the western

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.128
coast of Turkey.
 

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:05.080
This--the theater,
a spectacularly well-preserved

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.278
theater at Sabratha,
you see on the upper right-hand

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:12.770
side;
and down here a restored view

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.470
of the masterful Palace of
Diocletian.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.729
We have the late Roman emperors
in a place called Split,

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.526
which is in Croatia,
along the fabulously gorgeous

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:26.538
Dalmatian Coast today.
 

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:29.471
So those are just a sampling of
the kinds of buildings that

00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.139
we'll look at in the provinces.
 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.079
We're going to be seeing,
we'll be concentrating on the

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.310
ways in which the Romans planned
and built their cities.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.163
And it's important to note,
from the very outset,

00:03:43.163 --> 00:03:47.340
that Rome itself grew in a very
ad hoc way.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.199
And we can tell that.
 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.840
Here's a Google Earth image
showing that core of Rome,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.788
with the Colosseum,
with the famous,

00:03:56.788 --> 00:04:01.242
modern Victor Emmanuel Monument
that looks either like a wedding

00:04:01.242 --> 00:04:02.870
cake or a typewriter.
 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.183
It's very white,
and it's called the wedding

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:06.800
cake by a lot of the locals.
 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.860
You see that here.
 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.288
But it's a landmark in Rome.
 

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:13.379
And the Capitoline Hill,
with the Campidoglio over here;

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.149
the Forum, the Roman Forum;
the Imperial Fora on this side.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.923
But you can see from the
relatively crooked and narrow

00:04:22.923 --> 00:04:27.014
streets of the city of Rome,
as they look from above today,

00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:30.846
you can see that again the city
grew in a fairly ad hoc

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:32.149
way,
as I mentioned.

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:35.949
It wasn't planned all at once,
it just grew up over time,

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.529
beginning in the eighth century
B.C.

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.144
Now this is interesting because
what we know about the Romans is

00:04:42.144 --> 00:04:44.670
when they were left to their own
devices,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.980
and they could build a city
from scratch,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.069
they didn't let it grow in an
ad hoc way.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.769
They structured it in a very
methodical way.

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:56.889
It was basically based on
military strategy,

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.339
military planning.
 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:01.461
The Romans, they couldn't have
conquered the world without

00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:04.310
obviously having a masterful
military enterprise,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.610
and everywhere they went on
their various campaigns,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.790
their various military
campaigns, they would build

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.084
camps,
and those camps were always

00:05:15.084 --> 00:05:17.120
laid out in a very geometric
plan,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.040
along a grid,
usually square or rectangular.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.446
So when we begin to see the
Romans building their ideal

00:05:24.446 --> 00:05:26.918
Roman city,
they turn to that so-called

00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:29.312
castrum,
or military camp design,

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:31.519
and they build their cities
that way.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:33.250
And I show you here one example.
 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.699
We're using Google Earth here
again,

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.641
another example of,
or an example of a city called

00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:41.648
Timgad,
T-i-m-g-a-d,

00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:46.247
which is in modern Algeria,
and the ancient city still

00:05:46.247 --> 00:05:47.089
survives.
 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.959
And if we look at this Google
Earth image of it,

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:55.069
you can see there are no later
accretions,

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.593
as we have in Rome,
no later civilizations built on

00:05:57.593 --> 00:05:58.199
top of it.
 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.475
You can see the ideal Roman
plan, which, as I said,

00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:04.360
is usually either a square or a
rectangle.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.588
It has in the center the two
main streets of the city.

00:06:07.588 --> 00:06:10.658
The north-south street is
called the cardo,

00:06:10.658 --> 00:06:11.410
c-a-r-d-o.
 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.612
The east-west street is called
the decumanus,

00:06:15.612 --> 00:06:17.259
d-e-c-u-m-a-n-u-s.
 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.449
We'll go back to all of this in
the future; so you don't have to

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:20.250
worry about it today.
 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.476
The cardo and the
decumanus,

00:06:22.476 --> 00:06:24.759
and you can see that they cross
exactly;

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.569
they intersect exactly at the
center of the city.

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.959
And then the rest of the city
is arranged in blocks,

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:35.348
very regular blocks,
this grid plan that I mentioned

00:06:35.348 --> 00:06:36.079
before.
 

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:39.060
Then some of the major
monuments, whether it's the

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.932
theater or the forum,
are arranged in different parts

00:06:41.932 --> 00:06:43.891
of the city,
and then these blocks

00:06:43.891 --> 00:06:47.482
constitute essentially the
housing and the shops and so on

00:06:47.482 --> 00:06:48.490
and so forth.
 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.514
This is a city that was planned
in around 100 A.D.,

00:06:51.514 --> 00:06:53.149
under the emperor Trajan.
 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:57.040
And again it gives us an
inkling of what the Romans --

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.230
when the Romans thought about
ideal Roman town planning --

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.663
it was this grid plan,
not Rome, but this grid plan

00:07:04.663 --> 00:07:07.680
that they had very much in mind.
 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.680
Cities like Rome,
like Timgad,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.613
and most of the others that
we'll look at in the course of

00:07:13.613 --> 00:07:16.512
this semester,
were surrounded by defensive

00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:17.339
walls.
 

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:20.331
As a major military machine in
its own right,

00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:24.411
Rome was only too aware of the
dangers of attack from others,

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:27.540
and consequently they walled
their cities.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.387
And we will look at the two
major walls in Rome,

00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:33.600
as well as walls in other parts
of the Roman world.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.824
I promise not to spend too much
time on walls,

00:07:35.824 --> 00:07:38.050
because they're essentially
piles of stone.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.283
But they're important in their
own right and I will speak to

00:07:41.283 --> 00:07:44.079
them on occasion,
and especially the two in Rome.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.560
You see them here.
 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.730
This is the first wall in Rome,
the so-called Servian Walls,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.509
which was built in the
Republic, in the Roman Republic,

00:07:52.509 --> 00:08:02.420
to surround the city,
the Republican city,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.163
and essentially the Seven
Hills, the famous Seven Hills of

00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:06.838
Rome,
to surround the Seven Hills of

00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:09.620
Rome,
in the fourth century B.C.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.110
You see a section of it here.
 

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.879
This wall--any of you who've
come to Rome by train,

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:18.778
and the Stazione Termini,
see a very extensive section of

00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:21.024
the Servian Walls,
as you get out--I don't know if

00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:22.915
you've noticed it,
but you should see--an

00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:26.757
extensive section of the Servian
Walls right outside the train

00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:27.449
station.
 

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:30.802
This is a different section,
a picture I took on the

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:33.629
Aventine Hill,
showing part of that wall.

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:36.379
And that was eventually
replaced by later walls.

00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:38.070
The city grew over time.
 

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.500
It needed a more extensive,
broader wall system,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.297
and in the late third century
A.D., under the emperor

00:08:45.297 --> 00:08:49.019
Aurelian, the famous Aurelian
Walls were built.

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.245
The Aurelian Walls,
as you know -- there's no way

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:53.414
you've missed those --
I'm sure if you've been in Rome

00:08:53.414 --> 00:08:55.327
you've seen the Aurelian Walls--
they're there,

00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:58.490
they're very much there--
at least if you've left the

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.870
city.
 

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.019
Maybe if you've just gone into
the core of the city and haven't

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:02.720
gone beyond that,
you might not have seen them.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.312
But if you've left the city,
you've seen the Aurelian Walls

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:09.841
-- a very impressive set of
walls that encircled the later

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:10.399
city.
 

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.000
One thing that's apparent to
you as you look at these,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.190
even if you have no knowledge
whatsoever of Roman

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.650
architecture,
is these are made of very

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.730
different kinds of materials.
 

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.688
So technical issues come to the
fore right away as one analyzes

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:25.028
this sort of thing.
 

00:09:25.028 --> 00:09:28.017
In the early period,
essentially blocks of stone,

00:09:28.017 --> 00:09:30.879
piled one on top of the other,
for the wall.

00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:33.724
Here, a more sophisticated use,
later on in the Empire,

00:09:33.724 --> 00:09:36.884
of a new technology that we're
going to talk about a lot this

00:09:36.884 --> 00:09:37.570
semester.
 

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.181
That is concrete,
and what concrete did to

00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:42.408
revolutionize Roman
architecture;

00:09:42.408 --> 00:09:48.940
concrete, in this particular
case, faced with brick.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.485
We talked about regular town
planning and the location of the

00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:54.850
cardo and the
decumanus.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.490
I want to show you just an
example of this.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.032
This is a city in Italy,
in this case the city of

00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:01.769
Pompeii.
 

00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:04.000
You see it here in plan.
 

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.860
This is a plan of Pompeii as it
looked, just at the moment that

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.350
Vesuvius erupted.
 

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.490
So in August of 79 A.D.
 

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.178
this was the way Pompeii was at
that particular time.

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:18.980
You can see it's not really a
rectangle;

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.597
it's kind of elongated,
sort of like an oval,

00:10:21.597 --> 00:10:23.799
kind of an oval,
an irregular oval.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:26.750
But it has the sense;
I think it has the sense.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:32.841
It shows you that again even
though the Romans were thinking

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:38.519
to try to create their cities in
a very regular way,

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:41.649
it didn't always work out
exactly that way,

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:43.850
depending on the terrain and so
on and so forth.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.296
But this is a rough--it's sort
of an irregular rectangle,

00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:48.649
as you can see here.
 

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:50.317
But if you look very carefully,
you sort of say to yourself

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:51.352
like, "Where's the
cardo,

00:10:51.352 --> 00:10:52.129
where's the dec?
 

00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:53.532
You just told us the
cardo and the

00:10:53.532 --> 00:10:55.038
decumanus intersect in
the center;

00:10:55.038 --> 00:10:55.664
like where are they?
 

00:10:55.664 --> 00:10:57.230
Why aren't they intersecting in
the center?"

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.715
Well, surprise,
surprise, maybe not such a

00:10:59.715 --> 00:11:02.745
surprise, if you look over here
at the bottom left,

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:06.080
you will actually see the
original city of Pompeii.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.812
In the fourth century B.C.,
the third century B.C.,

00:11:08.812 --> 00:11:11.929
the second century B.C.,
Pompeii didn't look like this;

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:14.820
Pompeii looked like this.
 

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.778
And if you look very carefully
at just this section,

00:11:16.778 --> 00:11:19.269
where we have the buildings in
the various colors,

00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:23.533
you will see that there is
indeed a cardo and a

00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:28.360
decumanus that intersect
exactly at the center of this

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.341
roughly square--
so this was actually pretty

00:11:31.341 --> 00:11:34.517
regular originally--
this roughly square city of

00:11:34.517 --> 00:11:35.220
Pompeii.
 

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.908
At three we find the forum,
because the forum is always at

00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:40.139
the intersection.
 

00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:42.840
The Romans try--they're very
careful about this sort of

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.591
thing--
try to put their forum right at

00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:48.783
the intersection of the
cardo and the

00:11:48.783 --> 00:11:50.269
decumanus.
 

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:53.851
You see that here;
and then you see a lot of other

00:11:53.851 --> 00:11:55.889
buildings splayed off to either
side.

00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:59.970
The law court or the basilica,
another temple here.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.744
Here the main Temple of
Jupiter, and the Senate House or

00:12:03.744 --> 00:12:07.312
Curia, and a series of other
religious and comparable

00:12:07.312 --> 00:12:09.990
structures, on the right-hand
side.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.272
So it began as a quite regular
plan, cardo and

00:12:13.272 --> 00:12:17.186
decumanus intersecting at
the center, forum right at the

00:12:17.186 --> 00:12:19.080
intersection of those two.
 

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.048
And then over time it grew.
 

00:12:21.048 --> 00:12:23.366
It grew and expanded,
and the streets,

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:26.061
the same streets,
the cardo expanded,

00:12:26.061 --> 00:12:29.379
although it was no longer
exactly at the center of the

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:30.070
city.
 

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.523
This is a view from Google
Earth that shows you just pretty

00:12:33.523 --> 00:12:35.312
much--
I tried to angle it in such a

00:12:35.312 --> 00:12:37.448
way that it looks--
that it's exactly the same

00:12:37.448 --> 00:12:39.529
angle, or close to exactly the
same angle,

00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:42.019
as the plan that we just looked
at before.

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:44.850
And you can see over here the
amphitheater.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.956
You can see many of the
streets, including the shops and

00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:54.320
the houses, and you can see over
here the forum,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.570
as it looks today from the air.
 

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.019
And again it shows you how
helpful Google--

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:00.322
and, of course,
as you know,

00:13:00.322 --> 00:13:02.830
using Google Earth yourselves
for other purposes,

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.590
you know that you can go way
down;

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.571
I mean, you can find the entire
city and then you can go and

00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:12.552
explore each individual building
on your own and in your own

00:13:12.552 --> 00:13:13.158
time.
 

00:13:13.158 --> 00:13:14.269
In fact, that's what I've done
here.

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:17.749
Here you see a closer view of
the forum in Pompeii,

00:13:17.749 --> 00:13:19.905
as it looks today,
from the air,

00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:22.620
via Google Earth,
here at the left.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.166
And I compare it to this plan
that comes from your textbook,

00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:27.850
one of your two textbooks.
 

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.191
This is the book by
J.B. Ward-Perkins,

00:13:31.191 --> 00:13:34.211
which is, of the two,
the more--well,

00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:36.469
they're both important,
but then they both do different

00:13:36.469 --> 00:13:38.147
things--
but one of the two important

00:13:38.147 --> 00:13:40.120
books that we'll be using this
semester.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.418
Here is a plan from that book.
 

00:13:42.418 --> 00:13:44.649
And you can see the way in
which this forum,

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:47.765
and this forum is very
important at Pompeii because

00:13:47.765 --> 00:13:51.562
it's very early in date,
and consequently we will talk

00:13:51.562 --> 00:13:53.309
about it a fair amount.
 

00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:54.769
We see this.
 

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:58.547
The way Roman forums were
usually arranged was to have one

00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:01.807
general open rectangular space,
open to the sky,

00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:04.515
surrounded by columns,
with a temple,

00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:07.678
the key, the most important
temple,

00:14:07.678 --> 00:14:10.961
the chief temple,
pushed up against one of the

00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:13.763
short back walls,
and dominating the space in

00:14:13.763 --> 00:14:14.409
front of it.
 

00:14:14.409 --> 00:14:17.059
This is a Capitolium;
we'll talk about what a

00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:20.003
Capitolium is in a future
lecture, but it is a temple to

00:14:20.003 --> 00:14:22.090
Jupiter and others,
as we shall see.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.015
Temple of Apollo over here,
the basilica or law courts over

00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:26.490
here.
 

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.620
And you can see,
interestingly enough,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.394
they have essentially the same
shape as the central forum

00:14:32.394 --> 00:14:35.485
proper,
rectangular with a colonnade in

00:14:35.485 --> 00:14:39.340
the center,
and then something on one side;

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.691
it's not another temple but
rather a tribunal,

00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:47.009
a place from which the judge
would try the cases in the law

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:47.830
courts.
 

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.351
We see the Senate House over
here, and a series of other

00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:54.426
buildings, including a
marketplace and some other

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:57.178
buildings here,
on the right-hand side.

00:14:57.178 --> 00:15:00.899
So a typical Roman forum at its
earliest.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:03.936
This dates very early on,
second century B.C.,

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:07.850
and is therefore an extremely
important building for us.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.279
Just so that you get a sense of
what some of these look like in

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:13.748
actuality,
this is the basilica or the law

00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:17.283
court,
which is part of the Forum of

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.240
Pompeii.
 

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.693
And we see that tribunal that I
mentioned before,

00:15:21.693 --> 00:15:26.298
a two-story tribunal from which
the judge would try the cases.

00:15:26.298 --> 00:15:28.697
The building isn't as well
preserved as we'd like,

00:15:28.697 --> 00:15:30.509
although there's quite a bit
there.

00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:33.235
What is there allows us to
create this kind of

00:15:33.235 --> 00:15:36.807
reconstruction drawing where we
can get a very good sense of

00:15:36.807 --> 00:15:40.259
what this building actually
looked like in antiquity.

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:41.830
You see the tribunal over there.
 

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.663
You see that there are double
stories with columns on either

00:15:45.663 --> 00:15:46.120
side.
 

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.399
You see these colossal columns
along the aisle.

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:51.580
But most importantly,
unlike the forum,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.620
which was open to the sky,
this is roofed,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.301
and it had a flat roof with
what's called a coffered

00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:58.167
ceiling--
we'll talk about that later in

00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:00.538
the term--
but then a sloping roof from

00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:01.418
the outside.
 

00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:03.308
And basilicas were always
roofed;

00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:06.995
that's what distinguishes them
from a lot of other Roman

00:16:06.995 --> 00:16:07.799
buildings.
 

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:09.250
Roman temple architecture.
 

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.860
The Temples of Jupiter and
Apollo at Pompeii are not that

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.504
well preserved,
but some Roman temples are

00:16:15.504 --> 00:16:17.308
magnificently preserved.
 

00:16:17.308 --> 00:16:20.190
I mean, look at this one,
it's pristine;

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.860
it's like it was created
yesterday as a duplicate of what

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.548
a Roman temple,
or a restoration of what a

00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:29.168
Roman temple might have looked
like.

00:16:29.168 --> 00:16:32.469
You could put this in Memphis
or somewhere like that,

00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:36.149
and think that you had a nice
replica of a Roman temple.

00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:37.509
That's how well preserved it is.
 

00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:39.120
It's an amazing temple.
 

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.933
It just happens to be well
preserved, in part because it

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:44.288
was re-used over time,
most recently as a small

00:16:44.288 --> 00:16:45.620
archaeological museum.
 

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.080
This is the famous Maison
Carrée,

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.678
or Square House,
for obvious reasons,

00:16:50.678 --> 00:16:56.129
that is in the beautiful French
town of Nîmes,

00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:57.918
in the south of France.
 

00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:01.440
You see it here in all its
glory.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.924
And think as you look at this
how many banks were based on

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:06.868
this plan.
 

00:17:06.868 --> 00:17:09.579
I mean, you can go to almost
any small city in America and

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.720
see a bank that looks something
like this,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.219
which just gives you some sense
of again how influential Roman

00:17:15.219 --> 00:17:17.170
architecture has been over time.
 

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.930
It's a quite traditional temple.
 

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.226
We'll talk about the difference
between traditional temple

00:17:22.226 --> 00:17:25.579
architecture and more innovative
temple architecture in the

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.200
course of this semester.
 

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.767
And as innovative as it gets,
is one of the key buildings of

00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:33.125
Roman architecture,
which is, of course,

00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:35.058
the famous Pantheon in Rome.
 

00:17:35.058 --> 00:17:37.990
I'm sure there's none of you
who's been in Rome who hasn't

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.380
been inside the Pantheon.
 

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.480
It's an incredible building.
 

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.828
This is a Google Map.
 

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:45.185
It was done during--the
building was put up during the

00:17:45.185 --> 00:17:47.987
reign of the very important,
from the architectural

00:17:47.987 --> 00:17:49.509
standpoint and many other
standpoints,

00:17:49.509 --> 00:17:51.759
the very important Emperor
Hadrian.

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:55.953
And we see--this is again one
of the wonderful things about

00:17:55.953 --> 00:17:59.063
Google Earth,
because you're seeing here the

00:17:59.063 --> 00:18:02.390
modern city, but you're also
seeing in 3D.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.560
The building still stands,
and it's in incredible

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.890
condition--
but you're also seeing the

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.000
building almost as it would've
been in ancient times,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.980
surrounded by its modern
environment.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.910
It's a temple.
 

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.001
It's a very distinctive and
innovative temple,

00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:19.953
because when you look at it
from the front,

00:18:19.953 --> 00:18:22.140
you see it has a kind of
traditional porch.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.940
It is not unlike the one on the
Maison Carrée with

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.038
columns that support a pediment
and looks like earlier Greek or

00:18:28.038 --> 00:18:29.338
Etruscan architecture.
 

00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:32.832
But what's very innovative
about it is that once you go

00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:36.169
into the building,
you see that this is not

00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:39.880
about--this is all about an
interior space,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.980
an extraordinary interior space
that is shaped by light,

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.009
that is shaped by genius,
essentially.

00:18:48.009 --> 00:18:51.073
And this image is actually one
of those that gives you a sense

00:18:51.073 --> 00:18:54.036
of the kind of thing that I've
been able to incorporate into

00:18:54.036 --> 00:18:56.890
this course,
that I didn't always use

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.838
before, which includes many,
many, many of my own images.

00:19:00.838 --> 00:19:02.750
And this one I'm particularly
proud of.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.098
It's a very atmospheric view of
the dome of the Pantheon,

00:19:07.098 --> 00:19:09.910
and I think really gives you,
almost more than anything else,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.885
gives you a sense almost more
than anything else that I can

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:15.507
show you today,
of Rome at its best,

00:19:15.507 --> 00:19:20.430
of the power and glory of Rome
and of Roman architecture.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.270
I'm very biased,
but as far as I'm concerned

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.839
this is the greatest building
ever conceived by man.

00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:27.769
So there you are.
 

00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:31.121
We'll see by the end of the
semester whether you agree with

00:19:31.121 --> 00:19:34.009
me or you think I'm absolutely
wrong about that.

00:19:34.009 --> 00:19:37.773
This is another extraordinary
structure and one that enables

00:19:37.773 --> 00:19:41.730
me to say something that you'll
hear me say more than once--

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.309
and I know I'm biased--but say
more than once in the course of

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:46.651
this semester,
and that is that there isn't

00:19:46.651 --> 00:19:48.910
much that the Romans didn't
discover,

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.259
didn't create,
and not just in architecture,

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:53.480
in all kinds of ways.
 

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.410
And this is a good example of
that.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.553
This is the so-called,
the famous Markets of Trajan in

00:19:58.553 --> 00:20:02.230
Rome, part of the great Forum of
the emperor Trajan in Rome.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.212
And you can see that what the
Romans have done is taken a

00:20:05.212 --> 00:20:06.971
hill,
one of the famous Seven Hills,

00:20:06.971 --> 00:20:09.056
the Quirinal Hill,
taken that hill,

00:20:09.056 --> 00:20:11.820
cut it back,
poured concrete on it and

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.828
created this incredible shopping
center on the side of the hill.

00:20:16.828 --> 00:20:19.892
If this isn't the beginning of
mall architecture,

00:20:19.892 --> 00:20:22.650
I don't know what is;
shopping mall architecture.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.779
It's right here already.
 

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:26.838
You can shop;
there are over 150 shops.

00:20:26.838 --> 00:20:29.009
You can shop on a variety of
levels.

00:20:29.009 --> 00:20:31.688
You can shop in the hemicycle,
you can shop along the Via

00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:32.308
Biberatica.
 

00:20:32.308 --> 00:20:38.440
You can shop 'til you drop in
this incredible mall.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.890
And as one looks at it in
detail, one sees amazing things.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.680
This is a view of one of the
shopping streets.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.952
You can see the typical
polygonal masonry that is so

00:20:48.952 --> 00:20:51.838
characteristic of Roman street
design here.

00:20:51.838 --> 00:20:54.509
Along it, some of the
individual shops--think that

00:20:54.509 --> 00:20:56.690
away at the top,
that was added later.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.420
But you see some of the
individual shops here.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.208
And look how ingenious the
Romans have been to provide not

00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:09.500
only a ramp but also a series of
stairs, flat area stairs and so

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.088
on.
 

00:21:10.088 --> 00:21:14.209
And this has all been very,
very carefully orchestrated by

00:21:14.209 --> 00:21:18.473
the designers in a way that is
not only utilitarian but also

00:21:18.473 --> 00:21:19.920
very attractive.
 

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.368
And then there's this.
 

00:21:21.368 --> 00:21:27.509
This is the Great Hall of the
Markets of Trajan in Rome,

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:30.766
a kind of bazaar,
which also has a series of

00:21:30.766 --> 00:21:34.960
shops and also attic windows,
as you can see, above.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.570
But then the particular marvel
of this space is--look what

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.269
they've done above.
 

00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:43.978
They have taken,
using concrete once again--and

00:21:43.978 --> 00:21:47.568
this gives you some sense of the
miracle of Roman concrete.

00:21:47.568 --> 00:21:50.136
Using concrete,
they have created a new kind of

00:21:50.136 --> 00:21:51.823
vault,
which we call the groin

00:21:51.823 --> 00:21:53.974
vault,
which is a ribbed vault,

00:21:53.974 --> 00:21:56.920
and you can see the ribs very
clearly here.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.301
And they have lifted that
ribbed vault on top of piers

00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:05.772
that have been attenuated,
narrowed to the point,

00:22:05.772 --> 00:22:10.201
in a very sophisticated way,
much more than was true up to

00:22:10.201 --> 00:22:10.920
this moment.
 

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.371
So they have been able to lift
those groin vaults in a way that

00:22:14.371 --> 00:22:17.204
always reminds me--
it's as if you went and opened

00:22:17.204 --> 00:22:19.259
a series of umbrellas over a
space,

00:22:19.259 --> 00:22:23.250
lifted the space up in a truly
miraculous way.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.397
And as an example again of the
fact that the Romans--there's

00:22:26.397 --> 00:22:28.960
nothing the Romans didn't do or
didn't invent.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.371
Here you see the well-known
marketplace in San Francisco,

00:22:32.371 --> 00:22:34.930
where you see essentially the
same idea;

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:40.084
a series of shops down below
and then this magnificently

00:22:40.084 --> 00:22:42.240
lifted ceiling above.
 

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.874
So Roman architecture,
as I said in the very

00:22:44.874 --> 00:22:48.548
beginning, really had a huge
impact on later architecture.

00:22:48.548 --> 00:22:52.377
The Markets of Trajan were part
of the forum complex,

00:22:52.377 --> 00:22:56.058
the Forum of Trajan,
which you see part of here.

00:22:56.058 --> 00:22:59.000
The forum itself was really
quite conventional.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.453
This is an interesting building
because we have a fairly

00:23:02.453 --> 00:23:04.965
traditional approach to the
forum itself,

00:23:04.965 --> 00:23:08.170
and then an innovative approach
to the markets.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.473
This is a restored view of the
basilica or law court of the

00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:12.500
Forum of Trajan.
 

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.219
You see that it's very
traditional, with columns and

00:23:16.219 --> 00:23:19.210
marble and a flat ceiling with
coffers.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:24.900
And that's what most of the
forum looks like.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.762
The markets are done in a very
different style,

00:23:27.762 --> 00:23:28.509
as we saw.
 

00:23:28.509 --> 00:23:32.266
And this particular forum was
not only a meeting and a

00:23:32.266 --> 00:23:35.483
marketplace,
or a place where cases could be

00:23:35.483 --> 00:23:38.665
tried,
but was also a monument in

00:23:38.665 --> 00:23:43.009
stone to the military victories
of Trajan.

00:23:43.009 --> 00:23:46.565
Trajan was the emperor who
extended the borders of the

00:23:46.565 --> 00:23:48.980
empire to their furthest
reaches,

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:55.644
and the monument is a testament
to what his accomplishments were

00:23:55.644 --> 00:23:57.019
militarily.
 

00:23:57.019 --> 00:24:00.342
And the famous Column of
Trajan, which still stands and

00:24:00.342 --> 00:24:03.994
is in magnificent condition,
as you can see here,

00:24:03.994 --> 00:24:08.708
is a monument that is wrapped
with a spiral frieze that

00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:12.961
purports to describe,
from bottom to top,

00:24:12.961 --> 00:24:17.703
all of the exploits,
all of the military exploits of

00:24:17.703 --> 00:24:20.880
Trajan's two military campaigns
in Dacia.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.088
It also served as the emperor's
tomb.

00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:27.968
There was a burial chamber down
below for urns of Trajan and his

00:24:27.968 --> 00:24:29.130
wife Plotina.
 

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.065
So it served not only as a
commemoration of his military

00:24:33.065 --> 00:24:35.909
victory over Dacia--
which by the way is modern

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:40.001
Romania today--
but also to victory over death

00:24:40.001 --> 00:24:41.880
for the emperor.
 

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.519
Every Roman city had its bath
buildings.

00:24:44.519 --> 00:24:47.537
Most of the houses did not have
running water,

00:24:47.537 --> 00:24:50.690
so baths were extremely
important, obviously.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.666
So most of these had more than
one, and in fact most cities,

00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:56.191
Pompeii, for example,
seems to have had about three

00:24:56.191 --> 00:24:57.150
bath buildings.
 

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.210
They're very important,
both in terms of their social,

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:05.368
their practical needs,
and also as a place for social

00:25:05.368 --> 00:25:08.269
interaction,
but also because there are some

00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:11.560
very interesting architectural
experiments that took place in

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.000
them.
 

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.798
I'm going to show you in the
course of this semester the

00:25:14.798 --> 00:25:17.240
development from the simplest
bath buildings,

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.509
such as the ones in Pompeii,
to the most elaborate.

00:25:20.509 --> 00:25:23.604
Those of you who've visited the
Baths of Caracalla in Rome --

00:25:23.604 --> 00:25:26.646
that's an example of one of the
huge and most elaborate bath

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:27.368
buildings.
 

00:25:27.368 --> 00:25:29.930
I show you here on the
left-hand side of the screen,

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.596
just as an example,
a view of one of the rooms of

00:25:33.596 --> 00:25:37.577
the Forum Baths in Pompeii,
the caldarium or warm

00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:37.940
room.
 

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.848
All of these baths had multiple
spaces within them.

00:25:41.848 --> 00:25:46.933
One of the distinctions of the
earlier baths was that the men's

00:25:46.933 --> 00:25:51.444
sections and the women's
sections were separate from one

00:25:51.444 --> 00:25:52.430
another.
 

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:55.377
And I hate to say it,
but the men had all the great

00:25:55.377 --> 00:25:55.848
rooms.
 

00:25:55.848 --> 00:25:59.569
They were bigger and they were
more ornately decorated,

00:25:59.569 --> 00:26:03.980
as this one is -- the warm room
of the men's baths at Pompeii.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.442
But you can see here,
even in much smaller scale than

00:26:06.442 --> 00:26:09.140
a building like the Pantheon,
and much earlier than the

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.037
Pantheon,
they're beginning to explore

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:15.784
the curvatures of the wall,
the semi-dome there,

00:26:15.784 --> 00:26:19.573
and the way in which you can
create light effects by putting

00:26:19.573 --> 00:26:22.400
holes or what's called an
oculus,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.548
a round hole,
in part of the ceiling,

00:26:26.548 --> 00:26:31.167
and other rectangular holes in
the ceiling to create fantastic

00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:32.380
light effects.
 

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.740
So they're already exploring
that here in Pompeii.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.470
When we look at some of the
larger bathing establishments,

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.048
the Baths of Caracalla still
look--well they're essentially a

00:26:43.048 --> 00:26:46.328
pile of concrete faced with
brick today,

00:26:46.328 --> 00:26:47.640
as any of you who've seen it
know.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.578
But the scale is truly
colossal, and one is very

00:26:50.578 --> 00:26:54.269
impressed when one wanders
around the Baths of Caracalla.

00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:55.410
But some of the others,
for example,

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.818
the Baths of Diocletian have
been reused in modern times,

00:26:58.818 --> 00:27:01.644
and it's one of the reasons
that so many Roman buildings

00:27:01.644 --> 00:27:04.828
survive is because of this kind
of reuse over the centuries.

00:27:04.828 --> 00:27:09.040
This, the Baths of Diocletian,
part of which was transformed

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.182
into a church,
at first, was decorated at one

00:27:12.182 --> 00:27:14.608
point in part by Michelangelo.
 

00:27:14.608 --> 00:27:18.105
And what we're looking at here,
the Church of Santa Maria degli

00:27:18.105 --> 00:27:20.446
Angeli,
Saint Mary of the Angels,

00:27:20.446 --> 00:27:24.569
what we're looking at here is a
view into what was the cold

00:27:24.569 --> 00:27:27.460
room,
or the frigidarium of

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.939
the Baths of Diocletian,
but transformed into a church,

00:27:31.939 --> 00:27:36.400
used as nave of the church of
Saint Mary of the Angels.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.961
But if you look very closely,
you'll see those same cross or

00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:43.160
groin vaults that we saw in the
Markets of Trajan,

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.319
that are also used here to lift
the ceiling in a very effective

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:48.832
way,
and then all these

00:27:48.832 --> 00:27:52.190
multi-colored columns that you
see are actually the columns

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.868
from the ancient building.
 

00:27:53.868 --> 00:27:56.863
So even in this interior of
Santa Maria degli Angeli,

00:27:56.863 --> 00:28:00.028
we can get a sense of how
ornate some of the decorations

00:28:00.028 --> 00:28:02.390
of some of these bath buildings
were.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.990
We're going to look at Roman
theaters this semester.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.667
This is an example of one,
the spectacular Roman theater

00:28:09.667 --> 00:28:12.009
at Orange in the south of
France.

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:13.828
You see it here.
 

00:28:13.828 --> 00:28:16.411
I'm not going to go into the
parts of a theater or its

00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:19.140
relationship to earlier Greek
theatrical architecture.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.853
But you can see the stair,
you can see the seats,

00:28:22.853 --> 00:28:25.019
you can see the orchestra.
 

00:28:25.019 --> 00:28:28.334
You can see the stage building,
a stage building that initially

00:28:28.334 --> 00:28:30.578
was decorated with a forest of
columns,

00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:33.946
only a couple of which survive,
as well as a lot of sculptural

00:28:33.946 --> 00:28:37.240
decoration,
again most of which does not

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.048
survive.
 

00:28:38.048 --> 00:28:41.319
But one of the points I want to
make today is that the Greeks

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:44.425
tended to build--the Greeks
always built their theaters on

00:28:44.425 --> 00:28:45.190
hillsides.
 

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.838
They used the natural hill to
support the seats.

00:28:48.838 --> 00:28:51.509
And that's true at Orange as
well.

00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:57.575
But the Romans were not content
to build their theaters only on

00:28:57.575 --> 00:28:58.750
hillsides.
 

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.796
They wanted to build their
theaters where they wanted to

00:29:00.796 --> 00:29:02.714
build their theaters,
and if they wanted to build a

00:29:02.714 --> 00:29:05.137
theater in downtown Rome,
they wanted to build a theater

00:29:05.137 --> 00:29:06.019
in downtown Rome.
 

00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:10.798
So what they did was that they
used concrete again to build a

00:29:10.798 --> 00:29:15.180
hill, upon which they could
support those same seats.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.670
And that's again an innovation
that we'll talk about.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.654
This is the Theater of
Marcellus in Rome,

00:29:20.654 --> 00:29:24.907
the earliest surviving stone
theater in Rome that dates to

00:29:24.907 --> 00:29:26.700
the Age of Augustus.
 

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.226
But I show it to you again,
just to show you the wonders of

00:29:29.226 --> 00:29:29.880
Google Earth.
 

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.259
I've looked at this building a
zillion times.

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:33.348
I've wandered around it.
 

00:29:33.348 --> 00:29:36.269
Most of the ancient part is
over on this side,

00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:39.318
and I'll show that to you in
another lecture.

00:29:39.318 --> 00:29:42.407
But over time this is one of
those buildings that was

00:29:42.407 --> 00:29:45.794
transformed into all sorts of
things, most recently into a

00:29:45.794 --> 00:29:47.279
fabulous condominium.
 

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:50.971
But as you wander around it
today, you get a sense of some

00:29:50.971 --> 00:29:55.051
of the high-rise apartments that
have been added to the original

00:29:55.051 --> 00:29:55.828
theater.
 

00:29:55.828 --> 00:29:58.690
But you can't get a full sense
of it unless you go up above it.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.528
And so here's where again
Google Earth is so helpful,

00:30:01.528 --> 00:30:04.118
because we can look down on the
entire complex,

00:30:04.118 --> 00:30:06.108
see the gardens,
see some of the apartments,

00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:08.858
see the circular driveway and
so on and so forth,

00:30:08.858 --> 00:30:12.384
which gives us information that
it wouldn't be possible to glean

00:30:12.384 --> 00:30:13.278
anywhere else.
 

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:17.662
And here is--if you let that
transformation from modern Rome

00:30:17.662 --> 00:30:21.078
to ancient Rome take place on
Google Earth,

00:30:21.078 --> 00:30:23.509
this is what you're going to
get for that same Theater of

00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:24.028
Marcellus.
 

00:30:24.028 --> 00:30:26.344
We just saw it and what it
looks like today on Google

00:30:26.344 --> 00:30:26.700
Earth.
 

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.821
Here's what it looks like when
you let it transform completely

00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:34.269
into the Theater of Marcellus
from ancient times.

00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:36.410
The Colosseum,
the very icon of Rome.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.830
No Roman city was without its
amphitheater,

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.415
its place for gladiatorial and
animal combat,

00:30:43.415 --> 00:30:45.858
and Rome was no exception.
 

00:30:45.858 --> 00:30:50.029
The most famous surviving Roman
amphitheater is the Colosseum.

00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:52.608
I show it to you here from the
inside,

00:30:52.608 --> 00:30:55.568
rather than the outside
initially, because I can--

00:30:55.568 --> 00:30:59.057
it allows me to illustrate the
places where the animals were

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:02.810
kept down below,
but also to show you that that

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.970
building has been used as a
quarry.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:10.067
It was used by the popes and
the princes of later Italy as a

00:31:10.067 --> 00:31:11.108
stone quarry.
 

00:31:11.108 --> 00:31:13.526
They would take
essentially--well they stripped

00:31:13.526 --> 00:31:16.856
it of all its interior marble,
to use that in a variety of

00:31:16.856 --> 00:31:20.358
buildings in Rome,
and some of those we know their

00:31:20.358 --> 00:31:22.380
identification even today.
 

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.086
Here's a view of one of the
corridors where you can see once

00:31:26.086 --> 00:31:29.604
again those groin vaults or
ribbed vaults that the Romans

00:31:29.604 --> 00:31:30.608
popularized.
 

00:31:30.608 --> 00:31:33.532
Connecting all these cities
with one another were the

00:31:33.532 --> 00:31:34.769
streets of the city.
 

00:31:34.769 --> 00:31:36.588
We'll look at streets,
especially in Pompeii,

00:31:36.588 --> 00:31:38.490
where they are extremely well
preserved,

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.858
and these streets look very
modern--

00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:43.436
you see the polygonal
stones--but very modern in the

00:31:43.436 --> 00:31:44.599
use of the sidewalks.
 

00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:47.185
The sidewalks;
there are drains as well along

00:31:47.185 --> 00:31:48.058
the sidewalks.
 

00:31:48.058 --> 00:31:54.134
And then you can see these very
deep rut marks where the wheels

00:31:54.134 --> 00:32:00.109
of the carts used to--over time
obviously they made these ruts

00:32:00.109 --> 00:32:02.068
in the pavement.
 

00:32:02.068 --> 00:32:07.021
And then over here a small
fountain, a fountain blessed by

00:32:07.021 --> 00:32:08.759
Hermes or Mercury.
 

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:11.220
You can see him there with his
wings and his caduceus.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.791
A small fountain,
important obviously again

00:32:14.791 --> 00:32:19.640
because most of the houses did
not have running water,

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.537
and there had to be a place
that you could go to collect

00:32:23.537 --> 00:32:25.380
water for household use.
 

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.414
One of the great things about
Pompeii, of course,

00:32:28.414 --> 00:32:32.209
is it gives us a sense of what
life was like in ancient Roman

00:32:32.209 --> 00:32:34.170
times, daily life was like.
 

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:39.180
And we'll look at millstones
that are part of bakeries,

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.035
as well as ovens that
look--again, the Romans invented

00:32:42.035 --> 00:32:44.105
everything--
look very much like a modern

00:32:44.105 --> 00:32:44.670
pizza oven.
 

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.230
You go over to BAR,
you'll see one of those.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.224
Over here, wine shops;
we have lots of wine shops in

00:32:50.224 --> 00:32:52.657
these Roman cities,
and they're particularly well

00:32:52.657 --> 00:32:54.769
preserved in Herculaneum and in
Pompeii,

00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:59.308
with these clay amphorae
that were used to hold wines,

00:32:59.308 --> 00:33:01.420
that were brought to Italy,
and also sometimes oils,

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.380
that were brought to Italy from
different parts of the world.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.776
Every Roman city had its
McDonald's, or its Wendy's,

00:33:07.776 --> 00:33:11.039
or its Burger King,
and I show one of those to you

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:11.640
here.
 

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.029
It's called a
thermopolium,

00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:15.338
as you can see down below;
thermopolium.

00:33:15.338 --> 00:33:21.159
A thermopolium was
essentially--what it was made up

00:33:21.159 --> 00:33:26.672
of is a--it is a series of--a
counter, with a series of

00:33:26.672 --> 00:33:28.000
recesses.
 

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.586
And each day those who ran this
thermopolium put

00:33:32.586 --> 00:33:35.711
different food in there,
and so when you got

00:33:35.711 --> 00:33:37.506
hungry--again,
the whole sort of fast food

00:33:37.506 --> 00:33:38.762
idea--
you just walk by,

00:33:38.762 --> 00:33:41.220
like in a cafeteria,
point out what you wanted.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.630
They'd serve it to you and
you'd be on your way.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.124
So very much fast food--so we
see lots of them in Pompeii and

00:33:47.124 --> 00:33:47.940
Herculaneum.
 

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.420
We'll look at Roman houses.
 

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.146
This is one example,
the House of the Vettii in

00:33:52.146 --> 00:33:54.538
Pompeii,
spectacularly preserved house,

00:33:54.538 --> 00:33:58.019
where we can see a pool that
was actually used for collecting

00:33:58.019 --> 00:33:59.727
water,
a hole in the ceiling,

00:33:59.727 --> 00:34:02.650
but a view from the atrium of
the house into the garden.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.787
The garden over here,
you get a sense of it -- the

00:34:05.787 --> 00:34:08.668
greenery, the marble furniture,
the fountains,

00:34:08.668 --> 00:34:11.230
and then the paintings on the
walls.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:14.074
I mentioned at the beginning
we'll spend a fair amount of

00:34:14.074 --> 00:34:16.869
time -- we'll spend a few
lectures on Roman painting.

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:19.746
And the reason that I do that
is because it's absolutely

00:34:19.746 --> 00:34:21.420
gorgeous and it's fascinating.
 

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.500
But it also allows us to get a
better understanding of interior

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.579
decoration among the Romans,
how they decorated their walls.

00:34:29.579 --> 00:34:32.320
But also, because as you can
see from this one example,

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.409
from Boscoreale,
now in the Metropolitan Museum,

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:36.989
the famous Met
Cubiculum,

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:40.050
which is decorated with Second
Style Roman wall painting,

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.989
that these paintings often
depict buildings.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:45.436
They are architectural
paintings, and they are very

00:34:45.436 --> 00:34:48.469
important in that regard because
we see --

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:52.068
we often see -- experimentation
in painting before we see it in

00:34:52.068 --> 00:34:52.940
architecture.
 

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.860
And so there are going to be
some things,

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.730
for example,
this broken triangular

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.688
pediment,
that we're going to see first

00:34:58.688 --> 00:35:00.659
in painting and then in built
architecture.

00:35:00.659 --> 00:35:04.110
So painting -- extremely
important for us.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.829
We'll also go to the city of
Ostia,

00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:08.516
the port of Rome,
which is a city very different

00:35:08.516 --> 00:35:11.605
from Pompeii because it is
essentially a second-century

00:35:11.605 --> 00:35:13.965
Roman city,
rather than a first-century

00:35:13.965 --> 00:35:14.610
Roman city.
 

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:19.989
The construction technique is
concrete, faced with brick.

00:35:19.989 --> 00:35:21.860
I show you one example of that.
 

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.510
But what's most interesting
about the houses in Ostia has to

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:29.097
do with the kind of city it was
-- again, the port of Rome,

00:35:29.097 --> 00:35:30.460
a commercial city.
 

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.699
It was very congested.
 

00:35:31.699 --> 00:35:34.851
People were not as wealthy as
those in the resort town of

00:35:34.851 --> 00:35:36.739
Pompeii,
and consequently they

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:39.699
needed--people didn't have
single-story houses,

00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:42.840
like the one in Pompeii that I
just showed you before --

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.820
but rather apartment houses
with multi-stories;

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.579
a kind of condominium idea.
 

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:52.155
And these are fascinating in
their difference from those in

00:35:52.155 --> 00:35:56.039
Pompeii, and that's a difference
that we will surely explore.

00:35:56.039 --> 00:35:59.108
The very well-to-do lived
in--the very well-to-do had

00:35:59.108 --> 00:35:59.639
villas.
 

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:03.289
The emperors had villas all
along what is now the Amalfi

00:36:03.289 --> 00:36:03.820
Coast.
 

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.289
Capri, the island of Capri.
 

00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:09.119
The emperor Augustus and
Tiberius had twelve villas on

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:10.710
the Island of Capri.
 

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.728
The most extraordinary villa,
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli,

00:36:13.728 --> 00:36:15.760
which I show you here from the
air.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.380
A kind of microcosm of the
empire at that particular time,

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.260
with extraordinary buildings,
with pools,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.996
decorated with sculpture that
show the eclectic taste of the

00:36:26.996 --> 00:36:29.851
emperor who liked things Roman,
liked things Greek,

00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:33.668
liked things Egyptian,
and statues of--he was married,

00:36:33.668 --> 00:36:39.429
but he also had a beloved young
boy whom he met in Bithynia.

00:36:39.429 --> 00:36:42.536
Antinous, the famous Antinous
that he met in Bithynia and who

00:36:42.536 --> 00:36:44.090
became the love of his life.
 

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.726
And when Antinous died he
created all kinds of shrines for

00:36:47.726 --> 00:36:48.429
Antinous.
 

00:36:48.429 --> 00:36:50.800
This is very important
architecturally because all

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.349
these are interesting shrines.
 

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:55.849
But in each of those shrines he
created statues of Antinous,

00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:59.670
and this is one showing
Antinous as an Egyptian pharaoh,

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:03.543
which was perfect for this
particular locale because it was

00:37:03.543 --> 00:37:06.150
meant to conjure up a canal in
Egypt.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.710
We're going to look at tomb
architecture--

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.260
I want to show you this very
quickly--

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.389
but we're going to look at a
lot of tomb architecture,

00:37:11.389 --> 00:37:13.960
because tomb architecture is
particularly interesting,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.659
because the only practical
consideration for a tomb,

00:37:16.659 --> 00:37:18.650
is that it had to house the
remains of the deceased,

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:19.610
that's it.
 

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:23.387
So you could be very whimsical
and personal about the kind of

00:37:23.387 --> 00:37:25.530
tomb you wanted to be buried in.
 

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.677
This is a series at Pompeii,
but we're going to look at

00:37:28.677 --> 00:37:32.061
those of the emperor Augustus
who was buried in a mausoleum

00:37:32.061 --> 00:37:35.210
that went back to those of the
earlier Etruscans,

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:40.940
kings, who ruled Rome before
the emperors did,

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.380
and he built a round tomb with
an earthen mound,

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.199
very similar to that of the
Etruscans.

00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:49.849
Hadrian, the famous emperor
Hadrian,

00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:53.233
was also buried in a round
tomb, at the well-known Castel

00:37:53.233 --> 00:37:55.056
Sant' Angelo,
in Rome today,

00:37:55.056 --> 00:37:57.260
with its beautiful Bernini
bridge,

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.469
the angels, Bernini's angels on
the bridge --

00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:02.159
also a round tomb.
 

00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:04.878
In its current form,
transformed into a fortress,

00:38:04.878 --> 00:38:08.219
it was used by the popes when
they needed to hide out during

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.409
times of trouble.
 

00:38:09.409 --> 00:38:13.655
Very whimsical tombs,
including this pyramid of a man

00:38:13.655 --> 00:38:18.682
by the name of Cestius,
and he built this tomb during a

00:38:18.682 --> 00:38:22.083
time of--
when a wave of things Egyptian

00:38:22.083 --> 00:38:26.483
came into Rome,
at the time that Augustus

00:38:26.483 --> 00:38:30.210
defeated Cleopatra and Antony.
 

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:34.416
And then even these communal
tombs, communal burial places

00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:38.474
for the less well-to-do,
where their remains were placed

00:38:38.474 --> 00:38:39.360
in urns.
 

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.989
We'll also look at tombs in
other parts of the Roman world.

00:38:43.989 --> 00:38:47.431
This is a famous tomb,
a rock-cut tomb in Petra,

00:38:47.431 --> 00:38:49.190
in what is now Jordan.
 

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:53.739
And you can see that the tomb
is essentially the rock;

00:38:53.739 --> 00:38:56.483
in fact, the burial chamber is
inside the rock and the

00:38:56.483 --> 00:38:58.969
façade has been carved
out of the rock.

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:02.077
We're going to talk about
aqueducts in the course of the

00:39:02.077 --> 00:39:04.525
semester;
just fleetingly show you two,

00:39:04.525 --> 00:39:06.980
the ways in which the Romans
brought--

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.489
for those they conquered,
they provided amenities,

00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:11.731
including water,
that was brought from a great

00:39:11.731 --> 00:39:12.280
distance.
 

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.739
This is the famous Pont du Gard
at Nîmes.

00:39:14.739 --> 00:39:18.391
And this is the one I showed
you before on Google Earth,

00:39:18.391 --> 00:39:21.844
the fabulous aqueduct at
Segovia that marches its way

00:39:21.844 --> 00:39:23.239
through the city.
 

00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:26.688
I have just a couple of
minutes, and I basically wanted

00:39:26.688 --> 00:39:29.947
to close just making two very
quick points about the

00:39:29.947 --> 00:39:33.269
difference between traditional
Roman architecture and

00:39:33.269 --> 00:39:35.570
innovative Roman architecture.
 

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.869
I'm not going to go into that
in any detail here.

00:39:37.869 --> 00:39:41.320
It's going to be the topic of
one of our lectures very soon.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.472
But this transformation from
temples that are based on Greek

00:39:44.472 --> 00:39:46.768
and Etruscan prototypes,
like that one here,

00:39:46.768 --> 00:39:48.639
to something like the Pantheon.
 

00:39:48.639 --> 00:39:52.074
I also want to mention from the
start that unlike other courses

00:39:52.074 --> 00:39:55.344
in architecture where you may
have been studying Frank Lloyd

00:39:55.344 --> 00:39:58.384
Wright or Borromini,
Francesco Borromini,

00:39:58.384 --> 00:40:01.159
or Frank Gehry,
we have very few names of

00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:03.349
architects preserved from Roman
times,

00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:05.699
because it was the patron who
was all,

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:08.028
not the architect,
and I'll explain that in a

00:40:08.028 --> 00:40:08.929
future lecture.
 

00:40:08.929 --> 00:40:11.860
But we have some,
and we'll talk about them when

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:12.360
we do.
 

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.039
We will also see--and I just
want to end up where I began,

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:20.498
which is to say again that
Roman architecture had a huge

00:40:20.498 --> 00:40:23.579
impact on architecture of
post-classical times.

00:40:23.579 --> 00:40:26.460
The Roman basilica became the
Christian church.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:31.271
The round tomb of Rome became
the round church in the early

00:40:31.271 --> 00:40:34.010
Medieval and Byzantine periods.
 

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.760
Tombs like the one in Jordan,
that I showed you just before,

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.030
which form what I call kind of
a baroque phase of Roman

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.380
architecture,
were the models for

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.090
seventeenth-century Baroque
architecture in Rome,

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.239
for example,
Borromini's San Carlino.

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:53.320
The Pantheon had--you all know
what this is,

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:53.889
UVA.
 

00:40:53.889 --> 00:40:56.050
The Pantheon had a huge impact.
 

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.525
There are many 'Pantheons'
everywhere, including in this

00:40:58.525 --> 00:40:59.829
country banks and the like.
 

00:40:59.829 --> 00:41:03.498
Thomas Jefferson looked to the
Pantheon to design his rotunda

00:41:03.498 --> 00:41:07.289
at the University of Virginia,
and the lawn that lay beyond.

00:41:07.289 --> 00:41:10.800
But for us, in this classroom,
at this particular time,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.280
the most important impact,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.135
of Roman architecture on more
modern architecture has to do

00:41:17.135 --> 00:41:19.530
with the amphitheater at
Pompeii,

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:22.010
which you see here;
my favorite amphitheater.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.500
The Colosseum is more famous.
 

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.579
The amphitheater at Pompeii is
earlier in date.

00:41:28.579 --> 00:41:31.199
And what's significant for us,
in this classroom,

00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:34.416
at this particular time,
is that the amphitheater at

00:41:34.416 --> 00:41:38.005
Pompeii--
and I kid you not--is the model

00:41:38.005 --> 00:41:42.478
for our own amphitheater,
and that is the Yale Bowl -- it

00:41:42.478 --> 00:41:43.360
is the model.
 

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.717
This is the building--and you
see it here from the air,

00:41:46.717 --> 00:41:50.699
the amphitheater in Pompeii--on
which the Yale Bowl was based.

00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:54.905
So again, the Romans have
clearly had a huge impact on

00:41:54.905 --> 00:41:58.349
architecture worldwide;
on our own architecture.

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.467
And we think we live on a
Gothic campus,

00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:03.130
but I'll show you,
in the course of this semester,

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.250
how many Roman buildings there
are.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.260
In fact, we had a post--and
just to get you inspired--

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:11.268
we had a post in an earlier
year in which people went around

00:42:11.268 --> 00:42:15.003
the campus to take pictures and
then post them online of

00:42:15.003 --> 00:42:19.351
buildings that they thought were
influenced by those of the Roman

00:42:19.351 --> 00:42:20.099
past.
 

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:21.610
At any rate,
that's it for today.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.360
Great to see you, meet you all.
 

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.822
If any of you have any
questions at all,

00:42:26.822 --> 00:42:30.360
I'm happy to answer them,
as are the teaching fellows.

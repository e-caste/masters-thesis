00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.695
Professor Steven Smith:
There's so much to say and so

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:05.160
little time.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.079
Today, I want to talk about the
general will,

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:23.327
Rousseau's most important
contribution to political

00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:29.311
science and I will also want to
talk about the legacies of

00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:36.030
Rousseau and what he's meant for
the world that he did so much to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.336
shape.
But I want to start first with

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:42.643
the general will which is his
answer to the problems of

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:45.888
civilization or the political
problem of the Second

00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:48.950
Discourse that we talked
about last week,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.564
the problems of inequality,
the problem of

00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:58.741
amour-propre,
the problem of our general

00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:04.014
discontent.
Social contract is his answer

00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:08.340
to the problem of natural
freedom.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.783
This is so, in a way,
because for Rousseau nature,

00:01:12.783 --> 00:01:16.047
he tells us,
provides no standards or

00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:20.310
guidelines for determining who
should rule.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.597
Unlike Aristotle,
man is not here a political

00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:27.856
animal, and notice that when
Rousseau speaks of the social

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:32.564
contract in the general will as
the foundation of all legitimate

00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:35.808
authority,
he means, literally,

00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:41.953
that all standards of justice
and right have their origins in

00:01:41.953 --> 00:01:47.791
the will in this unique human
property of the will or free

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:51.689
agency.
It is this liberation of the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.360
will from all transcendent
sources or standards,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.321
whether those be found in
nature, in custom,

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.730
in revelation,
in any other source.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.509
The liberation of the will from
all of these sources that is the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.913
true, as it were,
center of gravity of Rousseau's

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:17.946
philosophy.
It is a world that begins to

00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:22.879
emphasize the primacy and the
priority of the will,

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.217
a moral point of view that I
want to indicate a little later,

00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:33.717
finds its, in many ways,
very powerful expression in the

00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:38.258
philosophy of Immanuel Kant.
But given Rousseau's,

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:42.116
let's call it libertarian
conception of human nature,

00:02:42.116 --> 00:02:46.642
his description of the actual
mechanism of the social contract

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:50.129
may come as something of a
surprise to us.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.977
The problem,
to which the formula of the

00:02:53.977 --> 00:02:58.910
general will is the answer,
is stated succinctly by

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.876
Rousseau in Book I,
chapter 6 of the Social

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:05.603
Contract.
"Find a form of association,"

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:09.167
he writes, "which defends and
protects with all the common

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:11.934
force,
the person and goods of each

00:03:11.934 --> 00:03:16.816
associate and by means of which
each one while uniting with all

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:20.990
obeys only himself and remains
as free as before."

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.369
This, he calls,
the fundamental problem for

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.909
which the social contract is the
solution.

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.221
That statement,
a famous statement,

00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:35.897
Book I, chapter 6,
really contains two parts that

00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:43.224
merit close attention.
The first part says--the first

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:52.494
part of that clause says that
the aim of the contract is to

00:03:52.494 --> 00:04:00.964
protect and defend with the
common force the goods and

00:04:00.964 --> 00:04:06.986
person of each member.
So far, think of that,

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:11.096
this is entirely consistent
with Locke's claim or even

00:04:11.096 --> 00:04:15.593
Hobbes' claim that the purpose
of society is to protect the

00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:20.582
security or the life,
liberty, and estate of each of

00:04:20.582 --> 00:04:24.295
its members.
Yet, Rousseau adds to this

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:29.614
Lockean or liberal clause you
might say, a second and more

00:04:29.614 --> 00:04:35.109
distinctly Rousseauian claim,
namely, that the contract must

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:40.044
ensure not only the conditions
for mutual protection and the

00:04:40.044 --> 00:04:43.139
preservation of self and
property,

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.285
but rather also that in uniting
with one another,

00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:52.379
he says, each person obeys only
himself and then he says,

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.529
"remains as free as they were
before."

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.180
But how is this possible,
we want to know.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.147
Isn't the essence of the social
contract that we give up some

00:05:04.147 --> 00:05:08.783
part of our natural freedom to
guarantee mutual peace and

00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:13.024
security?
How can we remain as free as we

00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:18.231
were before, and as he says,
obey only our--that the

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:23.109
participant obey only himself.
That is the paradox,

00:05:23.109 --> 00:05:26.128
in many ways,
or the fundamental problem,

00:05:26.128 --> 00:05:29.223
as he calls it,
to which his contract is a

00:05:29.223 --> 00:05:33.579
solution.
Rousseau provides an answer as

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:36.604
follows;
he says, "Properly understood

00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:39.410
these clauses are all reducible
to one.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.346
Namely," he says,
"the total alienation of each

00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:47.966
associate together with all of
his rights to the entire

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:51.304
community."
The total alienation of each

00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:55.560
associate with all of his rights
to the entire community.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.866
And those two phrases,
"total alienation" and "entire

00:05:59.866 --> 00:06:03.180
community" are obviously central
here.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.060
In the first place,
all persons must give

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.451
themselves entirely over to the
social contract to ensure that

00:06:10.451 --> 00:06:13.980
the terms of the agreement are
equal for all.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.315
The total alienation clause as
it were, is Rousseau's manner of

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:22.161
ensuring that the terms of the
contract are the same for

00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:24.095
everyone.
But secondly,

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:27.329
when we alienate ourselves,
it is crucial,

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:32.300
he says, that this be done or
given to the entire community,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.745
for only then he wants to
argue, is the individual

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:42.370
beholden not to any private will
or any private association,

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.009
or to some other person but to
the general will,

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:48.720
the will of the entire
community.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.535
The social contract is the
foundation of the general will

00:06:52.535 --> 00:06:56.350
which is, for Rousseau,
the only legitimate sovereign.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.526
Not kings, not parliaments,
not representative assemblies,

00:07:00.526 --> 00:07:03.603
not presidents,
but the general will of the

00:07:03.603 --> 00:07:07.339
entire community is the only
general sovereign,

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.862
the doctrine of the famous
doctrine of what we call the

00:07:10.862 --> 00:07:14.189
sovereignty of the people or
popular sovereignty.

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:17.695
Since everyone combines to make
up this will,

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:22.554
when we give ourselves over to
it entirely, he wants to argue,

00:07:22.554 --> 00:07:25.980
we do nothing more then obey
ourselves.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.843
The sovereign,
in other words,

00:07:27.843 --> 00:07:31.314
is not some distinct third
party that is created by the

00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:34.223
contract,
but rather the sovereign is

00:07:34.223 --> 00:07:38.218
simply the people as a whole
acting in its collective

00:07:38.218 --> 00:07:43.227
capacity,
the people in their collective

00:07:43.227 --> 00:07:46.696
capacity.
Now, you might suggest that

00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:49.660
there is something deeply amiss
here.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.892
That is to say,
from a highly individualistic

00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:57.080
set of premises where each
person is concerned only in the

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.062
state of nature,
or in the pre-contract

00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:03.500
tradition, only with the
protection of their lives,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.589
persons and property,
Rousseau seems to be leading us

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:11.759
to a highly regimented and
collectivized conclusion,

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:16.475
where the individual has given
over virtually his or her entire

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:19.290
being to the will of the
community.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:24.439
In what way does this render us
as free as we were before?

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:30.750
In what way do we remain free
and obey only ourselves?

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:36.377
That seems to be the problem.
Is Rousseau's formula for the

00:08:36.377 --> 00:08:39.675
general will,
a recipe or a formula for

00:08:39.675 --> 00:08:42.916
freedom,
or is it a recipe for the

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:47.673
tyranny of the majority of the
type later analyzed by

00:08:47.673 --> 00:08:52.429
Tocqueville that we'll be seeing
after the break?

00:08:52.429 --> 00:08:55.155
Rousseau wants to say,
paradoxically,

00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:59.320
only through this total
alienation do we remain free.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.750
Why is this?
Why is this?

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:08.231
Because he wants to argue no
one is dependent upon the will

00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:11.657
of another.
The people established through

00:09:11.657 --> 00:09:15.539
their act a new kind of
sovereign, the general will,

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:19.777
which he says is not strictly
speaking the sum total,

00:09:19.777 --> 00:09:23.688
the additive total of the
individual wills or the

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:27.542
individual parts,
but is more like the general

00:09:27.542 --> 00:09:32.210
interest or the rational will,
if you want to use that kind of

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.496
Kantian formulation,
the rational will of a

00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:38.980
community.
Since we all contribute to the

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.148
shaping of this general will,
when we obey its laws we do,

00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:48.500
he wants to say,
no more than obey ourselves.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.056
Rousseau describes this new
kind of freedom that we achieve

00:09:53.056 --> 00:09:57.019
under the general will.
He wants to say that this

00:09:57.019 --> 00:09:59.100
brings about,
in some ways,

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.419
a radical transformation of
human nature in itself.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:06.911
The freedom of the citizen
under the general will is not

00:10:06.911 --> 00:10:09.259
the freedom of the state of
nature,

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:12.544
it's not the freedom to do
anything we like,

00:10:12.544 --> 00:10:16.440
anything that our will and
power allows us to do,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.666
but it is a new kind of freedom
that he calls moral freedom,

00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:25.210
a freedom to do what the law
commands.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.114
The passage from the state of
nature, he writes,

00:10:28.114 --> 00:10:31.081
to the civil state,
the passage from the state of

00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:34.541
nature to the civil state
produces a remarkable change in

00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:37.904
man.
For it substitutes justice for

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:42.752
instinct in his behavior and
gives his actions a moral

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:46.320
quality that they previously
lacked.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.230
And Rousseau continues that
statement as follows.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.302
"What man loses through the
social contract is his natural

00:10:53.302 --> 00:10:57.732
liberty and unmitigated right to
everything that tempts him and

00:10:57.732 --> 00:11:01.092
he can acquire.
What he gains is civil liberty

00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:04.230
and proprietary ownership of all
he possesses,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.457
but--and here I think is the
crucial argument or the crucial

00:11:08.457 --> 00:11:12.470
clause, but he writes--to the
preceding acquisitions,"

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.885
that is to say civil liberty,
"could be added the acquisition

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:21.850
of moral liberty which alone,"
he says, "makes man truly the

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.841
master of himself.
For it to be driven by appetite

00:11:25.841 --> 00:11:30.183
alone is slavery and obedience
to the law one has prescribed

00:11:30.183 --> 00:11:34.779
for oneself is freedom."
That is a remarkable statement.

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:39.205
"Obedience to the law that one
prescribes for oneself is

00:11:39.205 --> 00:11:41.780
freedom."
That is moral liberty,

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.777
which is only created and
possible through the social

00:11:45.777 --> 00:11:48.954
contract,
and the implications of this,

00:11:48.954 --> 00:11:53.074
the moral and political
implications of that statement

00:11:53.074 --> 00:11:56.158
are massive.
It is here, in many ways,

00:11:56.158 --> 00:12:00.454
where Rousseau departs most
powerfully, most dramatically

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:03.370
from his early modern
predecessors.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.244
Consider the following.
For Hobbes and Locke,

00:12:07.244 --> 00:12:11.517
liberty meant that sphere of
human conduct which is

00:12:11.517 --> 00:12:15.511
unregulated by the law.
Remember chapter 21 of

00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:18.330
Leviathan,
where Hobbes says,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.759
"where the law is silent"
praetermitted in his term,

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:26.755
"where the law is silent,
the citizen is free to do what

00:12:26.755 --> 00:12:30.514
ever he or she chooses to do."
Freedom begins,

00:12:30.514 --> 00:12:34.149
so to speak,
where the law is silent.

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:37.902
But for Rousseau,
law is the very beginning of

00:12:37.902 --> 00:12:40.702
our freedom.
Where the law is silent,

00:12:40.702 --> 00:12:44.919
we may have a kind of natural
freedom, but our moral freedom,

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:51.368
we are free to the extent that
we are participants in the laws

00:12:51.368 --> 00:12:56.414
that we in turn obey.
Freedom means acting in

00:12:56.414 --> 00:13:00.279
conformity with self-imposed
law.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.673
A radically different
understanding of what freedom

00:13:03.673 --> 00:13:07.610
consists and it seems underlying
the difference between,

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.575
one could say Hobbes and Locke
on the one side,

00:13:10.575 --> 00:13:14.038
and Rousseau on the other;
it's a difference between two

00:13:14.038 --> 00:13:16.269
very different conceptions of
liberty.

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:20.848
One might call them liberal and
republican respectively,

00:13:20.848 --> 00:13:24.927
small "r" republican of course
or democratic even,

00:13:24.927 --> 00:13:27.138
if you like.
For liberals,

00:13:27.138 --> 00:13:30.247
following in the tradition of
Hobbes and Locke,

00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:34.302
again, freedom has always meant
a sphere of privacy where the

00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:38.559
law does not intrude or where
other people do not intrude.

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:41.978
This is why the separation of
the public and the private

00:13:41.978 --> 00:13:44.899
sphere has always been so sacred
to liberals,

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:49.525
because only in the private
sphere, only in that area of

00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:53.898
civil society where the state
does not intrude is the

00:13:53.898 --> 00:13:57.009
individual really and truly
free.

00:13:57.009 --> 00:14:02.703
But for the republican theory
of liberty of which Rousseau is

00:14:02.703 --> 00:14:08.172
a most powerful modern exponent,
this separation of public and

00:14:08.172 --> 00:14:12.581
private is only an exercise in
what might be thought of as

00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:16.350
private selfishness.
The task is rather to create a

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.397
community where the individual
and the public interest are not

00:14:20.397 --> 00:14:24.732
in conflict with one another,
where the individual does not

00:14:24.732 --> 00:14:28.929
think of him or herself as a
being apart from the social

00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:31.725
body.
This is the freedom of the

00:14:31.725 --> 00:14:36.179
citizen, for Rousseau,
who takes an active role in the

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:40.549
determination of the laws of
one's own community.

00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:45.080
Rousseau's purpose in saying
this and in writing this seems

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.532
to be to bring back to life a
concept that he believes has

00:14:49.532 --> 00:14:52.755
been dormant,
had laid dormant for centuries

00:14:52.755 --> 00:14:57.559
and that concept is the citizen.
The last people who really knew

00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:01.769
what a citizen meant,
he says, were the Romans.

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:04.726
In a footnote,
again to Book I,

00:15:04.726 --> 00:15:10.344
chapter 6, he indicates to what
degree the true meaning of

00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:14.779
citizen has been lost on modern
subjects.

00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:19.889
"Most modern men," he writes,
"mistake a town for a city,

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:24.990
and a bourgeois for a citizen."
Think of that.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.240
Most mistake a bourgeois for a
citizen.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.658
The modern world furnishes
almost no examples of what a

00:15:32.658 --> 00:15:37.404
citizen is, and this is why it
is necessary for Rousseau to

00:15:37.404 --> 00:15:40.759
return to the histories of
antiquity,

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:46.110
especially Rome and Sparta to
find models of citizenship.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:50.394
Only in these societies can one
find the spirit of

00:15:50.394 --> 00:15:54.679
self-sacrifice and devotion to
the common good,

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:58.718
a kind of patriotic devotion
upon which citizenship is

00:15:58.718 --> 00:16:01.187
founded.
If I could take perhaps

00:16:01.187 --> 00:16:05.271
Rousseau's most memorable
example of the true citizen it

00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:09.429
comes from an example he lifts
from the Roman writer,

00:16:09.429 --> 00:16:13.296
Plutarch that he uses in the
opening pages of his book,

00:16:13.296 --> 00:16:16.589
The Émile,
which I hope you will have a

00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:19.309
chance to read at some other
time.

00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:23.002
Here, he tells an unforgettable
story for anybody who ever reads

00:16:23.002 --> 00:16:26.161
Émile.
"A Spartan woman," he writes,

00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:30.297
"had five sons in the army and
was awaiting news of the

00:16:30.297 --> 00:16:33.188
battle,"
had five sons in the army and

00:16:33.188 --> 00:16:37.544
was awaiting news of the battle.
"A helot, slave arrives

00:16:37.544 --> 00:16:42.409
trembling she asks him for news.
‘Your five sons were killed,'

00:16:42.409 --> 00:16:44.970
the helot replies.
‘Base slave,

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:50.230
did I ask you this?'
‘We won the victory,' he says.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:55.590
The mother runs to the temple
and gives thanks to the gods."

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.360
Here, for Rousseau,
was the ancient citizen.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.829
An example that is both
terrible and sublime,

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:08.619
which of course he wants it to
be, he intends it to be.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:13.970
There is the example of what
the true citizen is.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.469
The question,
when you consider this

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:20.253
possibility, is whether
Rousseau's idea of the freedom

00:17:20.253 --> 00:17:23.572
of the citizen,
freedom to live under

00:17:23.572 --> 00:17:27.498
self-imposed law,
leads to a higher form of

00:17:27.498 --> 00:17:31.040
nobility,
higher than the kind of low

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.150
minded pursuit of one's
self-interest as Rousseau wants.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.228
He wants to dignify politics
again by leading to a higher

00:17:40.228 --> 00:17:43.870
form of nobility or does it
result in a new kind of

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.506
despotism,
the despotism of law,

00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:51.047
the despotism of obedience to
the general will and of course

00:17:51.047 --> 00:17:55.665
underlying that sinister reading
of Rousseau is the famous or

00:17:55.665 --> 00:18:00.206
maybe infamous statement that
not only that the general will

00:18:00.206 --> 00:18:04.654
is the source of freedom,
but that anyone who obeys,

00:18:04.654 --> 00:18:08.470
who refuses to obey,
the general will may be in his

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:13.329
famous formulation,
may be forced to be free.

00:18:13.329 --> 00:18:20.938
That anyone who disobeys it and
being chastised or can be,

00:18:20.938 --> 00:18:27.035
as it were, forced to be free.
Recall that this is a

00:18:27.035 --> 00:18:31.988
conception of freedom which,
again, is almost the opposite

00:18:31.988 --> 00:18:37.289
of that of what we might again
call the liberal tradition.

00:18:37.289 --> 00:18:40.006
A view, which,
and again in a slightly

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:43.090
paradoxical way,
was given, a very powerful

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.443
formulation by Hobbes.
I want to read a passage that I

00:18:47.443 --> 00:18:52.410
read a couple of weeks ago from
Hobbes which I think stands as a

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.799
striking contrast to that of
Rousseau's.

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:59.720
Again, in chapter 21 of
Leviathan Hobbes writes,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.204
"The Athenians and the Romans
were free, that is,

00:19:03.204 --> 00:19:07.488
they were free commonwealths.
Not that any particular men had

00:19:07.488 --> 00:19:10.230
liberty to resist their own
representatives,

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.224
but their representatives had
the liberty to resist or invade

00:19:14.224 --> 00:19:17.327
other people."
Hobbes clearly says that the

00:19:17.327 --> 00:19:21.039
ancient freedom was the freedom
of the collective;

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:23.160
it wasn't the freedom of the
individual.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.071
"The freedom of the
authorities," as he says,

00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:28.519
"to resist or invade other
people."

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:31.974
There is written,
on the turrets of the city of

00:19:31.974 --> 00:19:35.880
Lucca, remember that,
in the great characters at this

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.960
day the word libertas and
yet,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.340
he goes on to say,
"no man can thence infer that a

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.617
particular man has more liberty
or immunity from service to the

00:19:46.617 --> 00:19:49.859
commonwealth there than in
Constantinople."

00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:53.512
That is to say,
freedom for Hobbes consists of,

00:19:53.512 --> 00:19:56.609
as he puts it,
immunity from service,

00:19:56.609 --> 00:20:00.735
immunity from service and for
this reason there is no reason

00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:05.349
to believe that anyone is freer
in the republican city of Lucca,

00:20:05.349 --> 00:20:11.230
which has libertas on
the wall than in Constantinople.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.471
That seems to,
already a 100 or so years

00:20:14.471 --> 00:20:18.295
before Rousseau,
suggest a powerful alternative

00:20:18.295 --> 00:20:21.888
to his view of freedom.
Hobbes' point,

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:26.028
like Rousseau's,
is extreme and that in many

00:20:26.028 --> 00:20:29.880
ways is the power of these two
views.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.883
Hobbes' view of freedom is
immunity from service,

00:20:33.883 --> 00:20:38.471
Rousseau's view is that freedom
consists, you might say,

00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:43.689
only in service.
Our freedom starts where the

00:20:43.689 --> 00:20:47.670
law begins.
Again, at the basis of this are

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.878
two radically different views of
the role of political

00:20:51.878 --> 00:20:55.396
participation in lawmaking.
For Rousseau,

00:20:55.396 --> 00:21:00.726
again, laws are legitimate only
if everyone has a direct share

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:04.599
in making them.
It doesn't mean we all agree

00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:09.772
with the outcome but only if we
have some kind of share or voice

00:21:09.772 --> 00:21:12.522
in making them.
For Hobbes, for Locke,

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:14.835
for the authors of the
federalist papers,

00:21:14.835 --> 00:21:18.366
on the other hand,
the direct involvement of the

00:21:18.366 --> 00:21:23.080
citizen in lawmaking is clearly
a subordinate or a secondary

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.769
good.
Legislation is better handled

00:21:25.769 --> 00:21:28.949
by persons chosen from the
electorate who are,

00:21:28.949 --> 00:21:31.847
so to speak,
the agents or representatives

00:21:31.847 --> 00:21:34.894
of the people.
This was what the federalist

00:21:34.894 --> 00:21:38.242
authors argued was the great
advance of modern political

00:21:38.242 --> 00:21:40.859
science, the doctrine of
representation.

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:43.984
What is far more important for
the federalist authors,

00:21:43.984 --> 00:21:47.551
as well as for Locke,
Hobbes and that tradition is

00:21:47.551 --> 00:21:51.660
that laws be generally known,
that they be applied by

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.596
impartial judges,
rather than they be the direct

00:21:55.596 --> 00:22:00.807
expression of the general will.
In many ways underlying the,

00:22:00.807 --> 00:22:06.587
again, liberal conception of
law is a certain distrust of the

00:22:06.587 --> 00:22:11.693
collective wisdom or the
collective sovereignty of the

00:22:11.693 --> 00:22:14.483
people.
It is too cumbersome,

00:22:14.483 --> 00:22:17.362
in many ways,
and also too dangerous a

00:22:17.362 --> 00:22:21.485
mechanism to call people
together to decide on matters

00:22:21.485 --> 00:22:24.927
over public concern.
This is better left according

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:26.890
to this tradition to
representatives.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:32.390
Rousseau obviously could not
disagree more.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:37.329
One could say that Rousseau
makes heroic and unreasonable

00:22:37.329 --> 00:22:42.532
assumptions about human nature.
Why do we want to gather

00:22:42.532 --> 00:22:47.594
together constantly or often to
decide, to deliberate,

00:22:47.594 --> 00:22:52.369
and to debate over questions of
public concern?

00:22:52.369 --> 00:22:54.299
Most people,
it's hard enough just to get

00:22:54.299 --> 00:22:56.470
most people, as we know,
to go out to vote,

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:02.242
why do we want to engage in
endless debate of something like

00:23:02.242 --> 00:23:07.819
a college council meeting trying
to discuss what to do,

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:11.817
whether to buy or not a new set
of dumbbells for the weight

00:23:11.817 --> 00:23:14.126
room.
This is a debate that will go

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:16.960
on for hours and hours and maybe
even weeks.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.000
Don't people simply want to be
left alone?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.965
Rousseau, again,
he seems in some way,

00:23:23.965 --> 00:23:29.325
to make unreasonable
assumptions about human nature

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:33.720
and our capacity to engage in
debate.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.160
But Rousseau will tell you he
is not being idealistic at all.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.592
He is starting from the
assumption of men as they are,

00:23:40.592 --> 00:23:43.751
he says.
Unless everyone he wants to say

00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:48.612
is engaged in the process of
legislation, there is no way for

00:23:48.612 --> 00:23:53.149
you know that the laws will be
an expression of your will

00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:58.010
rather than simply the private
will or corporate will of some

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:03.185
individual or intermediary body.
You will find yourself in a

00:24:03.185 --> 00:24:07.589
condition of dependence and
slavery on the will of others.

00:24:07.589 --> 00:24:13.332
And what is really at issue for
Rousseau is freedom from

00:24:13.332 --> 00:24:17.365
dependence on some faction,
some interest,

00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:21.601
or some association that we
have come to call today interest

00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:23.980
groups,
in some way.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.904
Rousseau's appeal is not to our
altruism, but rather,

00:24:27.904 --> 00:24:30.470
to our selfishness,
in some way.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:35.491
Our desire, our private or
selfish desire to preserve our

00:24:35.491 --> 00:24:41.050
freedom and resist the willful
domination of others upon it.

00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:47.910
So far, this all,
in many ways,

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:54.932
is very abstract and Rousseau
deliberately sets out his plan

00:24:54.932 --> 00:25:01.954
for the general will in a highly
abstract and semi-technical

00:25:01.954 --> 00:25:05.890
language.
But he turns to questions

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:11.223
particularly in Book III about
how is the general will actually

00:25:11.223 --> 00:25:16.019
applied.
How is it applied?

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:20.928
Here Rousseau is far more
specific sociologically and so

00:25:20.928 --> 00:25:25.568
on about the conditions under
which the general will,

00:25:25.568 --> 00:25:28.960
or a general will,
can come about.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.304
In the first place,
the general will can only

00:25:32.304 --> 00:25:35.953
operate in small states,
much like the size of an

00:25:35.953 --> 00:25:38.541
ancient republic.
In one place,

00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:42.581
one particularly notable place
in the social contract,

00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:45.424
he says,
only the island country of

00:25:45.424 --> 00:25:49.663
Corsica is today a place where
the general will might be

00:25:49.663 --> 00:25:52.601
established.
The modern nation-state,

00:25:52.601 --> 00:25:57.203
as we have come to think of it,
is far too large and diffuse to

00:25:57.203 --> 00:26:00.608
determine the general will.
Such a state,

00:26:00.608 --> 00:26:05.412
such large states will
necessarily entail considerable

00:26:05.412 --> 00:26:09.220
degrees of social inequality of
wealth,

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.830
of status and with such
inequalities,

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:19.348
there can be no general will.
Finally, or in addition,

00:26:19.348 --> 00:26:23.220
such a state where the general
will is operative would be one

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.046
that would have to,
in some sense,

00:26:26.046 --> 00:26:31.471
eschew the temptations of
commerce and luxury for these

00:26:31.471 --> 00:26:37.309
bring with them,
again, large scale inequalities.

00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:43.772
His ideal city seems to be a
kind of agrarian democracy,

00:26:43.772 --> 00:26:49.549
a small-scale agrarian society.
Yet, at the same time,

00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:54.298
we might get the impression
that only a direct democracy

00:26:54.298 --> 00:26:58.788
would satisfy Rousseau's
requirements for the general

00:26:58.788 --> 00:27:03.710
will and yet we find out this is
not quite the case.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.174
In Book III,
which I hope you will look at

00:27:07.174 --> 00:27:11.060
with some care,
he shows surprising flexibility

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.708
about the forms of government
that may be appropriate to

00:27:15.708 --> 00:27:20.270
different physical and different
climates and different

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:24.706
topographies and so on.
In the chapter on democracy,

00:27:24.706 --> 00:27:27.625
he remarks even,
"were there a people of God's

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:30.480
that would govern itself
democratically,"

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.630
and then he adds,
"so perfect a government is not

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.265
suited to men."
So he is skeptical about the

00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:42.519
possibility of a direct
democracy and by that he means a

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:46.309
democracy not only where the
people legislate,

00:27:46.309 --> 00:27:51.127
bring, create law but where
they are in charge also with the

00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:55.971
administration of law as well,
the execution or enforcement of

00:27:55.971 --> 00:27:58.765
the law.
He is very skeptical about that

00:27:58.765 --> 00:28:02.048
kind of democracy.
Again, democracies are only

00:28:02.048 --> 00:28:04.890
possible under very,
very special unique

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.244
circumstances;
otherwise, aristocracy,

00:28:08.244 --> 00:28:13.575
monarchy, some kind of even
mixed government is possible or

00:28:13.575 --> 00:28:17.441
even desirable.
He insists on the separation of

00:28:17.441 --> 00:28:21.579
powers for much the same reasons
that one finds in Locke.

00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:25.482
The people who make the law
should not be charged with,

00:28:25.482 --> 00:28:28.880
responsible for executing and
enforcing them,

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.236
and throughout this part of the
book Rousseau seems to be in

00:28:33.236 --> 00:28:37.740
dialogue with an unnamed rival
whom he sometimes simply refers

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.608
to as a famous author.
That author is of course,

00:28:41.608 --> 00:28:44.882
Montesquieu,
the author of The Spirit of

00:28:44.882 --> 00:28:48.055
the Laws.
That came out in 1755 and

00:28:48.055 --> 00:28:52.059
Montesquieu was,
of course, famous for arguing

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:56.141
that different forms of
government must be tailored to

00:28:56.141 --> 00:28:59.118
different climates,
different geographies,

00:28:59.118 --> 00:29:01.492
different circumstances.
In many ways,

00:29:01.492 --> 00:29:04.937
in Book III,
Rousseau seems to indicate or

00:29:04.937 --> 00:29:09.589
to introduce a very,
very almost un-Rousseauian

00:29:09.589 --> 00:29:14.713
emphasis on prudence,
moderation, flexibility that

00:29:14.713 --> 00:29:20.989
seems at odds with the dogmatic
claims of the first two books

00:29:20.989 --> 00:29:26.322
with its emphasis upon the
absolute inviolability of

00:29:26.322 --> 00:29:29.632
sovereignty.
But most important for

00:29:29.632 --> 00:29:32.880
Rousseau, it is important that
legislative authority,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.856
in whatever kind of
constitution and under whatever

00:29:36.856 --> 00:29:40.674
kind of government,
that legislative authority is

00:29:40.674 --> 00:29:43.907
only,
is always held by the people in

00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:46.910
their collective capacity.
This is why,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.153
in a very powerful chapter,
Book III, chapter 15,

00:29:50.153 --> 00:29:54.139
Rousseau rejects altogether the
legitimacy of representative

00:29:54.139 --> 00:29:57.132
government.
That passage or that chapter

00:29:57.132 --> 00:30:00.480
could be taken already as a kind
of repudiation,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.124
not just of Locke,
Locke's theory of the

00:30:03.124 --> 00:30:07.193
representative but also twenty
years or so before the fact of

00:30:07.193 --> 00:30:10.380
the federalist argument for
representation.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.109
"Sovereignty," he says,
"can never be delegated."

00:30:14.109 --> 00:30:19.477
Sovereignty can never be
represented, it can only be

00:30:19.477 --> 00:30:23.360
expressed.
The general will can never be

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.237
delegated to someone else.
If you do that,

00:30:27.237 --> 00:30:32.219
if you delegate the authority
for making law you are,

00:30:32.219 --> 00:30:36.735
he wants to say,
on the first step down the road

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:40.213
to tyranny because you give
someone else,

00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:44.474
some partial body or
association the power to make

00:30:44.474 --> 00:30:49.310
law over you.
The lawmaking function can only

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:54.269
legitimately be held by the
people themselves.

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:57.782
I'm going to skip over a bunch
of stuff that has to do,

00:30:57.782 --> 00:31:00.838
very interestingly,
I hope you can discuss it in

00:31:00.838 --> 00:31:04.637
your sections perhaps,
with Rousseau's account of the

00:31:04.637 --> 00:31:08.782
legislator, the extraordinary
individual who was responsible

00:31:08.782 --> 00:31:12.554
at the beginnings of regimes,
for shaping the general,

00:31:12.554 --> 00:31:16.303
for molding a people and for,
as it were, giving the general

00:31:16.303 --> 00:31:19.480
will a kind of shape and
distinctive direction,

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.967
and I'm also going to skip,
for our purposes,

00:31:22.967 --> 00:31:27.089
the very interesting discussion
of civil theology,

00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:30.210
which occupies the theme,
the very last chapter of the

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.799
book, Book IV,
chapter 8,

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:37.083
where Rousseau talks about the
way in which a civil religion

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:42.097
must be tailored to bring about
love and obedience to the

00:31:42.097 --> 00:31:45.385
general will.
It was that chapter,

00:31:45.385 --> 00:31:49.005
I should say,
that more than anything else

00:31:49.005 --> 00:31:54.213
led to the books being burned
and banned in Geneva and other

00:31:54.213 --> 00:31:59.245
places and for its powerful
attack on Christianity in that

00:31:59.245 --> 00:32:02.801
chapter.
I'm going to pass over that for

00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:07.193
the time being to look at the
legacies of Rousseau and to talk

00:32:07.193 --> 00:32:10.865
about what--and I just
deliberately use that word in

00:32:10.865 --> 00:32:13.890
the plural--the legacies of
Rousseau,

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.567
because there is virtually no
part of modern life,

00:32:17.567 --> 00:32:20.269
political, cultural,
intellectual,

00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:25.095
moral that does not in some
sense bear the stamp or

00:32:25.095 --> 00:32:28.859
fingerprints of Jean-Jacque
Rousseau.

00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:33.996
Rousseau's description of the
legislator, the kind of

00:32:33.996 --> 00:32:37.750
political founder creating a
people,

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.480
was for many,
in many ways,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.835
the closely connected with the
French Revolution and

00:32:45.835 --> 00:32:52.134
particularly the claim of the
revolutionaries to create a new

00:32:52.134 --> 00:32:54.531
nation,
a new people,

00:32:54.531 --> 00:32:57.866
a new sovereign,
a new popular sovereign in

00:32:57.866 --> 00:33:01.033
France.
Consider the following words of

00:33:01.033 --> 00:33:05.015
the famous revolutionary
Robespierre in his homage to

00:33:05.015 --> 00:33:09.570
Rousseau written in 1791.
Divine man, this is

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:16.549
Robespierre, "Divine man you
taught me to know myself.

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:19.553
While I was still young,
you made me appreciate the

00:33:19.553 --> 00:33:23.398
dignity of my nature and reflect
upon the great principles of the

00:33:23.398 --> 00:33:26.439
social order.
The old edifice is crumbling,

00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:30.547
the portico of the new edifice
is rising up on its ruins and

00:33:30.547 --> 00:33:33.819
thanks to you I have brought my
stone to it.

00:33:33.819 --> 00:33:36.020
Receive my homage,
as weak as it is,

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.494
it must be please you.
I wish to follow your venerable

00:33:39.494 --> 00:33:42.600
footsteps, happy if in the
perilous career that an

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.960
unprecedented revolution just
opened up before us.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.137
I remain constantly faithful to
the inspirations that I found in

00:33:50.137 --> 00:33:53.186
your text."
People might tell you that the

00:33:53.186 --> 00:33:56.829
writings of Rousseau had no
influence on the French

00:33:56.829 --> 00:33:59.682
Revolution,
that the French Revolution was

00:33:59.682 --> 00:34:03.530
brought about by bread crises
and economic problems and so on;

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:09.171
absolute baloney.
The writings of Rousseau had

00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:14.547
this powerful influence on the
idea of creating a new people

00:34:14.547 --> 00:34:18.967
and a new nation.
Yet, despite what appears to be

00:34:18.967 --> 00:34:22.988
a utopian and impractical in his
politics, again,

00:34:22.988 --> 00:34:27.596
Rousseau had a profound
influence on the politics of his

00:34:27.596 --> 00:34:30.338
era.
He was approached during his

00:34:30.338 --> 00:34:34.599
lifetime to write constitutions
for Poland and for Corsica,

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:39.764
and of course that was the
island where a generation later

00:34:39.764 --> 00:34:45.110
a man named Napoleon Bonaparte
was born who attempted to,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:49.195
you might say in some way,
extend Rousseau's teaching,

00:34:49.195 --> 00:34:53.820
not just to France but to all
of Europe at the point of a gun

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.599
to bring democracy to all of
Europe at the point of a gun.

00:34:58.599 --> 00:35:02.132
Does that sound familiar at all
in any way related to events

00:35:02.132 --> 00:35:04.716
going on now?
Where we have a new kind of

00:35:04.716 --> 00:35:06.090
Bonapartism, perhaps.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.822
In many ways,
although Rousseau's attack on

00:35:12.822 --> 00:35:16.667
representative government would
seem to put him strongly at odds

00:35:16.667 --> 00:35:19.230
with the American
Constitution,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:23.332
his glorification of the rural
republic based on equality,

00:35:23.332 --> 00:35:26.683
moral simplicity,
skepticism of commerce and

00:35:26.683 --> 00:35:31.489
luxury, this was to be re-echoed
in the writings of Jefferson,

00:35:31.489 --> 00:35:35.402
with his ideal of a nation of
small Yeoman farmers and

00:35:35.402 --> 00:35:39.020
certainly any reader of
Tocqueville's depiction in

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.449
celebration of the independent
townships of New England.

00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:47.589
Tocqueville's account of this
was directly dependent on his

00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:51.351
reading of Rousseau,
the small-scale experiment in

00:35:51.351 --> 00:35:55.355
direct democracy that
Tocqueville saw was a real world

00:35:55.355 --> 00:36:00.039
example of a kind of politics
governed by the general will.

00:36:00.039 --> 00:36:04.339
And when you read those early
chapters from Tocqueville's

00:36:04.339 --> 00:36:08.869
democracy in America about the
New England township you will

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:13.092
very much see Tocqueville
looking at America through the

00:36:13.092 --> 00:36:18.159
lenses that were in some ways
crafted or shaped by Rousseau.

00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:22.851
That influence was palpable on
a whole host of later

00:36:22.851 --> 00:36:26.495
nineteenth-century writers.
Like Tolstoy,

00:36:26.495 --> 00:36:29.572
for instance,
whose celebration of Russian

00:36:29.572 --> 00:36:34.150
peasant life was inspired by
Rousseau and through Tolstoy,

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.580
Rousseau influenced the
establishment of the Israeli

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:41.684
kibbutz movement that was also
founded by Russian Jews who had

00:36:41.684 --> 00:36:45.290
been influenced by Tolstoy,
so you have a sort of

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.969
self-reinforcing cycle of
influence.

00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:51.493
These, you might say,
small rural socialistic

00:36:51.493 --> 00:36:55.818
experiments in communal living
exhibit the same kind of

00:36:55.818 --> 00:36:59.374
equality,
self-government devotion to the

00:36:59.374 --> 00:37:03.836
common good that Rousseau helped
people imagine might be

00:37:03.836 --> 00:37:07.070
possible.
Yet, Rousseau's influence was

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.830
not limited to politics.
If he was a divine man,

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:15.160
as Robespierre called him,
he was no less so to Immanuel

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.558
Kant,
who claimed that it was his

00:37:17.558 --> 00:37:21.752
reading of Rousseau that led him
to learn respect for the dignity

00:37:21.752 --> 00:37:26.349
and the rights of man;
that's what Kant said.

00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:31.000
He called Rousseau "the Newton
of the moral universal."

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.048
Kant's entire philosophy and I
hope you also have a chance to

00:37:35.048 --> 00:37:38.625
read Kant's critique of
practical reason in some later

00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:42.498
philosophy course,
Kant's entire moral philosophy

00:37:42.498 --> 00:37:47.037
is a kind of deepened and
radicalized Rousseauianism where

00:37:47.037 --> 00:37:51.814
what Rousseau called the general
will is transmuted into what

00:37:51.814 --> 00:37:56.989
Kant calls the rational will and
the categorical imperative.

00:37:56.989 --> 00:38:00.947
It was not the least of
Rousseau's legacies that after

00:38:00.947 --> 00:38:05.352
his death he became a hero both
to the revolution and to the

00:38:05.352 --> 00:38:08.602
counter-revolution,
both to a revival of

00:38:08.602 --> 00:38:12.509
Roman-style republicanism as
well as to Romanticism,

00:38:12.509 --> 00:38:16.340
or if I can use the words of
great Rousseauian,

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.746
Jane Austin,
he became both an advocate of

00:38:19.746 --> 00:38:23.019
sense and sensibility.
Emerson, Thoreau,

00:38:23.019 --> 00:38:27.537
American transcendentalism with
its worship of nature and its

00:38:27.537 --> 00:38:31.452
protests against the kind of
deadening and corrupting

00:38:31.452 --> 00:38:35.675
influence of society,
all of these people were the

00:38:35.675 --> 00:38:38.988
direct heirs of Rousseau.
Rousseau's last work,

00:38:38.988 --> 00:38:42.210
a book called The Reveries
of a Solitary Walker,

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:46.753
set the stage for later
American classics like Walden

00:38:46.753 --> 00:38:52.082
Pond and generations of nature
writers that have come after it

00:38:52.082 --> 00:38:56.135
and imitated it.
Only by turning away from the

00:38:56.135 --> 00:39:00.905
noise and business of society
can one return to what precedes

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:04.267
society,
to the feeling of existence,

00:39:04.267 --> 00:39:08.710
to the feeling of or sweetness
of mere existence,

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:12.566
to the sentiment of existence,
the le sentiment de soi,

00:39:12.566 --> 00:39:15.369
as Rousseau calls it,
the sentiment of the self.

00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:20.301
There is a kind of union that
he celebrates with nature that

00:39:20.301 --> 00:39:23.978
puts the solitary,
the solitary walker either

00:39:23.978 --> 00:39:28.952
above humanity or below it.
That type of man foreshadowed

00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:33.716
by Rousseau, the solitary is no
longer a philosopher in any

00:39:33.716 --> 00:39:38.724
sense that we would understand.
It might be better understood

00:39:38.724 --> 00:39:44.060
as an artist or a visionary.
He can claim a privileged place

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:50.200
in society because such a person
regards him or herself as the

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:56.167
conscience of that society.
His claim to privilege is based

00:39:56.167 --> 00:40:00.732
on a heightened moral
sensitivity rather than his

00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:06.260
wisdom or his rationality,
and it is this kind of radical

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.230
individualism,
the radical detachment of the

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:15.124
solitary from the interests of
society that is perhaps

00:40:15.124 --> 00:40:20.849
Rousseau's deepest and most
enduring legacy for us today.

00:40:20.849 --> 00:40:23.769
So, on that note I wish you a
good break.

00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:28.131
I hope you have a lot of turkey
to eat and you come back well

00:40:28.131 --> 00:40:31.905
rested and most,
most, most importantly we come

00:40:31.905 --> 00:40:36.180
back with a win over that evil
empire to our north.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.580
Thank you very much.

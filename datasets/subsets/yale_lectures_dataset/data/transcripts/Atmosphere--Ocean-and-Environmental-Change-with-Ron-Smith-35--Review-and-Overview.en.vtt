RONALD SMITH: What have
we learned?

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.833
Well, we've learned about the
atmosphere and the ocean, and

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:07.433
how they work.

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:11.600
The physical processes that go
on to make the ocean and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.000
atmosphere, like we find
them on our planet.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.667
We've also learned a little bit
about how they're changing

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:20.600
in time and what processes
are causing them

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.700
to change as well.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.933
So in a nutshell, that's kind
of what we've learned.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.333
And how did we do it?

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.433
This may not have been apparent
to you, but as I look

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:33.833
at the course, we've been
using three intellectual

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:38.567
approaches as we've gone
through this material.

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:43.267
Observation has been one,
a very important one.

00:00:43.267 --> 00:00:48.433
Quantification, trying to get
numbers onto everything.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:51.267
Amounts, numbers, and units.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.367
And then logic, interpretation,
and

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:55.933
explanation.

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.833
Why are things the
way they are?

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.133
How do things connect?

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.667
How do physical principles
explain this phenomena, but

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.333
also that phenomena.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.967
So observations, quantification,
and I guess

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:14.433
explanation are the themes, or
the approaches, that we've

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.533
used going through the course.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.300
What can we do with this?

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.633
Well, that's not
so easy maybe.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:30.767
On a kind of a trivial basis,
you could use the material of

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:34.133
this course to lead you into
more advanced courses.

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.000
If you need--if youwant to
chat with me about any of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.567
that, I'd be more than happy
to talk to you about what

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:45.367
other courses are offered,
especially in G&amp;G, which I

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:50.600
know the best. But also EVST,
maybe engineering as well has

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.867
some other courses.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.033
So you can you know this is
an introductory course.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:02.633
It's a survey course, and for
many it can serve as a good

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:06.900
foundation for doing more
advanced courses.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.367
Another thing that you can do
with this that I think is fun,

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.400
I remember when I was a student,
I loved to take

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.400
material I learned in one course
and see if I could fit

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.200
it together with things I was
learning in other, seemingly

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.233
unrelated courses.

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:24.167
Find ways in which
they connect.

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:27.967
A few of you over the course
have mentioned to me examples

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:32.600
where you've seen the material
in here kind of match up in a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.967
certain way with other courses
you are taking, have taken, or

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:40.067
maybe you'll find out this will
happen in the future as

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:42.233
you take other courses.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:44.967
But that's really important
because this stuff is not

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:48.400
meant to have sharp boundaries
around it.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.233
It's not a body of knowledge
that's controlled and fenced

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:56.567
off from other disciplines.

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:58.833
It's supposed to be
just the opposite.

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:02.667
A subject that has a lot of
connections, whether it's

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:07.400
economics, or engineering,
or biology.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.067
I hope you'll try to find those

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:12.333
connections as you go forward.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:21.300
So I think this course you can
take a course in music

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.367
appreciation.

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:27.333
Or you can take a course
in nature appreciation.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:30.067
Maybe this is a course in nature
appreciation, where you

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:32.933
learn a bit about how to observe
and appreciate things

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:33.733
that are going on.

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:35.767
Now some would take the other
side of the argument.

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:40.067
Some would say, no, no if I
approach environmental studies

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:45.433
from a physical or a quantified
point of view, it

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:50.767
loses--some of nature loses its
appeal to me, its wonder,

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:51.833
its beauty, and so on.

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:54.633
Now I've never found
that to be true.

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:59.767
I got into this field because
I appreciated what was going

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:01.300
on around me in nature.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.867
And I've found that only
deepening as I've studied it

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:05.833
quantitatively.

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:09.300
It's true that when I see
something happening now I can

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.933
understand, at some level,
why it's happening.

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:17.167
But that only leaves another
thousand mysteries beyond that

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:18.733
of things that I don't
yet understand,

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:19.900
but wish that I did.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.167
So in a sense this I don't
think will limit your

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:27.167
appreciation of what goes
on in the out-of-doors.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.500
It will just perhaps change a
little bit the approach you

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.767
take to understanding it.

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:37.533
And the last one I have on
my list here is that this

00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:39.833
material, I think, is important
because there are

00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:44.700
some important political and
moral questions that face us

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.600
as individuals and as a society
for which you need

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.367
some scientific knowledge in
order to understand what

00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:56.133
direction we should be going.

00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:58.300
You know this idea I'm sure
you've heard this in other

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.667
courses but this idea of a
common, something that's

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.700
shared by a number of people.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.233
In the old days in
New England, it

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:09.700
was the town green.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.367
Like what's now New Haven Green,
and all these old New

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:15.500
England villages, was a common
space and people could bring

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.033
their cows and their sheep
to graze there.

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.767
Now that didn't last too long,
because after a while they

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:26.067
were too many sheep and too
many cows to--they would

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:28.433
overgraze a single common
area like that.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:32.867
But the point is, it's a shared
area where everybody

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:36.133
benefited from it, but everybody
had to take some

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:38.367
responsibility for it as well.

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:41.367
Well now, the atmosphere
and the ocean are

00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:42.533
the commons, right?

00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:44.900
We all derive benefits
from it.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.367
We all pollute it in some way.

00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:51.500
And so we have to take
responsibility for that.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.667
And that's the basis for these
moral and political questions

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.567
that I alluded to.

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:02.433
Having a scientific
understanding of that system

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:05.133
may help us to make the
right choices there.

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:09.533
So that's some of the
why's and what's we

00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:13.000
did during the term.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.900
I want to finish up by spending
the next few minutes

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.867
talking about some
common themes.

00:06:17.867 --> 00:06:21.700
And I passed out this sheet of
paper which lists some, and

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.367
I've--that's up on the
server as well.

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:29.933
I tried to scan through, the
other night, the things--kind

00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:32.900
of the physical principles that
we've run across in this

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.367
course more than once.

00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:41.000
We didn't always state them in
the same way sometimes they

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.733
were, because they had such
a different context.

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:46.133
They almost seem like a
different physical principle.

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:48.167
But today I want to spend
some time trying

00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:49.567
to tie these together.

00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:54.500
Because I don't know I want to
OK, agreed there's a lot of

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.967
individual little facts and
figures that you dealt with

00:06:57.967 --> 00:06:58.767
throughout the course.

00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:00.267
But I've never looked
at it that way.

00:07:00.267 --> 00:07:04.733
I've always looked at it as kind
of a continuum where we

00:07:04.733 --> 00:07:07.667
could learn a few physical
principles, and use them over

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:11.033
and over again to solve
related or maybe even

00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:15.733
seemingly unrelated problems
during the semester.

00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:17.400
And that's what I want
to emphasize today.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.333
I don't think I've done a good
enough job during the term

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:24.667
emphasizing those common themes,
so my last day here is

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:29.467
an attempt to repair my errors
for the semester by paying

00:07:29.467 --> 00:07:34.433
more attention to these
common themes.

00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:36.467
The first, which is not
even on the list,

00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:40.267
would be physical units.

00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:43.633
So we talked about units earlier
in the course, and

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:46.500
we've had to use them every time
we were doing any kind of

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.233
a quantitative calculation.

00:07:49.233 --> 00:07:52.200
And I hope you've come to
appreciate them as much as I

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.200
have. Not only did they provide
us a common language

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.467
when I say the air density in
this room is 1.2 and leave it

00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:03.633
there, that conveys
essentially zero

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:05.800
information to you.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.833
Unless I put the units onto
that, kilograms per cubic

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:11.800
meter, it has no meaning.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.967
So the units are really
essential in how we talk to

00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:16.800
each other and convey
information.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.233
They also have this magical
property of allowing us to

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:25.500
check our work, to see whether
a formula that we're plugging

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.400
numbers into, or that we've
derived in some way, is

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.633
physically consistent, by seeing
if the units work out.

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:35.067
So it's really a wonderful
set of things.

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:39.100
And if you're not fully up to
speed on that by now, I

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.267
recommend that you work a bit
on that, because that will

00:08:42.267 --> 00:08:45.267
improve everything that you do
in this course and in another

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:47.000
physical science courses.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.933
Having a more of a facile
understanding and a adeptness

00:08:52.933 --> 00:08:58.267
of using units will certainly
improve all of your work and

00:08:58.267 --> 00:09:00.367
your thinking.

00:09:00.367 --> 00:09:03.667
So let's go on then to the first
one that I do have on

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:06.567
this list, the properties
of air.

00:09:06.567 --> 00:09:11.333
And of course, density and how
it's related to other things

00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:12.067
is important.

00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:17.167
And we found that air
is a perfect gas.

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:19.233
p equals rho r t.

00:09:19.233 --> 00:09:22.400
And so we know that we can
solve that equation for

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.633
density if we want.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.133
p over r t.

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:32.567
And that shows us that density
is a function of pressure and

00:09:32.567 --> 00:09:34.100
temperature.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.833
At constant pressure, if you
heat up the air it'll expand

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:41.200
and the density will
become less.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.600
At constant temperature, if you
add pressure to it the air

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.800
will compress and the density
will become greater.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.533
So we had to know that, and
that's so important in all of

00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:51.400
the things we did.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.033
And that gas constant, which
appears in the perfect gas

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:57.867
law, is different
for every gas.

00:09:57.867 --> 00:09:58.500
Remember that.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.400
And that can be found by
dividing the universal gas

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.667
constant by the molecular
weight for

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:06.100
that particular gas.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.667
So the other thing we needed
to know is heat capacity.

00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:17.033
How much heat is stored in
a chunk of air at a given

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.800
temperature?

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.533
And that's important for how the
winds transport heat, how

00:10:25.533 --> 00:10:28.200
air cools and warms as it
rises and sinks in the

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.333
atmosphere, we used it
over and over again.

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:34.767
OK, so any questions on
properties of air?

00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:38.467
Properties of water.

00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:40.400
Now the list is longer.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.467
Why is the list longer for
water than for air?

00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:45.167
Very simple.

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:50.933
Air, in the realm in which we
experience it, conditions here

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:53.867
on earth, is always a gas.

00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:57.000
You can compress
it to a liquid.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.200
I suppose, with enough
compression and cooling, you

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.267
might even reduce
it to a solid.

00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:04.600
But we never see air in anything
other than the

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.933
gaseous state, so all we need
are those three little things

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:10.167
that I mentioned for air.

00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:15.467
But for water, we find it in
all three phases on normal

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:16.433
conditions on earth.

00:11:16.433 --> 00:11:21.633
Gas, liquid, and solid,
that is to say, ice.

00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:27.100
So we have to have some
information about its density

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.633
in the gaseous state--in
the liquid state.

00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:31.233
And for the oceans, we've
learned they're dependent on

00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:33.567
salinity and temperature.

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:36.867
We need to know the heat
capacity of water.

00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:40.100
How much heat can be stored
in water at a certain

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.333
temperature?

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.833
And then everything else here
has to do with phase changes.

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:49.167
So at what temperature does it
freeze from liquid to solid?

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:54.833
And that was actually slightly
dependent on salinity.

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:58.267
Remember, at full ocean
salinity, the freezing point

00:11:58.267 --> 00:12:00.700
is not zero Celsius,
but about -2.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.667
It's not much of a difference,
but it makes some difference.

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:06.667
And then there was this
definition, or this thing we

00:12:06.667 --> 00:12:10.067
talked about, of supercooled
water, which happens

00:12:10.067 --> 00:12:15.600
frequently in clouds in the
atmosphere, where you cool the

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.000
temperature down below the
freezing point, but yet the

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.667
water doesn't freeze
until something

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:22.933
triggers that freezing.

00:12:22.933 --> 00:12:30.800
When freezing does occur, heat
is either well, for freezing

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.933
to occur, you have
to remove heat.

00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:36.067
The reverse of that,
when you melt ice,

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:37.533
you have to add heat.

00:12:37.533 --> 00:12:40.767
That is called the latent heat
of freezing, or the latent

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:41.533
heat of melting.

00:12:41.533 --> 00:12:44.067
It's the same number,
either way.

00:12:44.067 --> 00:12:48.633
And when you're condensing vapor
to form liquid, there's

00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:52.000
a big heat required, depending
whether you're condensing or

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.800
evaporating.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.667
So that's really important, and
then the saturation vapor

00:12:56.667 --> 00:13:02.033
pressure, this idea that you
can keep more water in the

00:13:02.033 --> 00:13:07.167
liquids--in the vapor state,
the hotter it is, is so

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:08.267
important for the atmosphere.

00:13:08.267 --> 00:13:10.633
It explains why clouds
form, for example.

00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:15.167
Rising air, adiabatic cooling,
eventually you come to the

00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.567
saturation point and
then cloud liquid

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:19.333
water begins to form.

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:24.967
So water is a little more
complicated, maybe, than air,

00:13:24.967 --> 00:13:27.867
because it gets in these
different phases and we really

00:13:27.867 --> 00:13:31.367
have to understand how these
phase changes occur in order

00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:34.767
to understand the atmosphere
ocean system.

00:13:34.767 --> 00:13:36.033
Questions on that?

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:42.933
Hydrostatic balance is something
we've come across

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:43.967
over and over again.

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:49.567
It's the idea that when you go
up the way we derived it in an

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:58.967
incremental form is that if you
go up in the atmosphere a

00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:04.333
height, delta z, move up from
there to there, the pressure

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:08.533
will decrease keep the minus
sign to remind me of that at a

00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:11.900
rate that depends on the
acceleration of gravity and

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.200
the density of the fluid.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.433
So we use that.

00:14:16.433 --> 00:14:20.333
We came across that first in
atmospheres, but then it's

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:21.800
true in the oceans as well.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.833
But remember, a typical density
in the atmosphere,

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:32.367
well it's 1.2 kilograms per
cubic meter at sea level.

00:14:32.367 --> 00:14:35.500
But then it decreases strongly
as you go up.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.567
So this value will change at
different altitudes in the

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:40.367
atmosphere.

00:14:40.367 --> 00:14:44.300
In the ocean, it's about 1025.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.133
It changes a bit around that
based on the salinity.

00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:50.733
Same units, 1000
times greater.

00:14:50.733 --> 00:14:53.000
When you get down
into the earth--

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.267
you can go down through
the earth's mantle--

00:14:55.267 --> 00:14:59.367
this equation continues to be
valid, but there the density

00:14:59.367 --> 00:15:05.233
is more like 2000 or 3000
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:15:05.233 --> 00:15:09.767
So the pressure increases even
faster as you go down.

00:15:09.767 --> 00:15:13.733
So the same equation can be
used in all three spheres.

00:15:13.733 --> 00:15:16.700
But just remember, the density
can be all over the place.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.767
From nearly zero, up in the top
of the atmosphere, to this

00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:25.067
value at the surface, to this
value in the ocean, and this

00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:29.733
value down in the interior
of the earth.

00:15:29.733 --> 00:15:32.267
We also use that with
a barometer.

00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:35.433
You know, the whole principle of
a mercury barometer is the

00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:36.567
hydrostatic law.

00:15:36.567 --> 00:15:41.733
That column of mercury rises to
a height needed to balance

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:45.167
the atmospheric pressure
pushing up at its base.

00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:48.400
And so you see that principle
of hydrostatic

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.567
balance there as well.

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:51.800
Questions on hydrostatic?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.833
Geostrophic balance,
another kind of

00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:00.100
important force balance.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:05.333
The idea there is that when
objects or fluids move

00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:09.567
relative to the earth, they
have a Coriolis force.

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:14.100
And very often in the atmosphere
and the ocean,

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.467
after a few hours, you end up
in a state of geostrophic

00:16:17.467 --> 00:16:21.933
balance, where the pressure
gradient force balances that

00:16:21.933 --> 00:16:22.667
coriolis force.

00:16:22.667 --> 00:16:25.233
And that gives some very
special properties.

00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:28.967
It says that the air or the
water moves along the isobars

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:30.733
rather than across.

00:16:30.733 --> 00:16:36.733
And the speed of the fluid is
proportional to the strength

00:16:36.733 --> 00:16:38.400
of the pressure gradient.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.467
Here's how we derive that.

00:16:39.467 --> 00:16:46.067
We said that the pressure
gradient force was the product

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:49.867
of the pressure gradient and
the volume of some little

00:16:49.867 --> 00:16:52.600
block of air that we imagined.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.233
And then we equate that with the
Coriolis force, which was

00:16:56.233 --> 00:17:03.833
2 times the mass, which is rho
times volume, times the

00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:07.933
velocity of the object, times
the rotation rate of the earth

00:17:07.933 --> 00:17:10.300
and the sine of the latitude.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.267
So having equated those then
and solving for U, and

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:19.900
canceling out the volumes, I get
pressure gradient over 2

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:27.133
rho U omega sine phi for the
geostrophic--the speed of the

00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:29.833
geostrophic wind.

00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:35.500
And the direction of course
depends on the hemisphere, but

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.533
along the isobars.

00:17:38.533 --> 00:17:41.467
Applies to both the atmosphere
and the ocean.

00:17:41.467 --> 00:17:43.833
So any questions on that?

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:51.233
OK, now, this fifth item on the
list I've handed you is

00:17:51.233 --> 00:17:55.033
the concept of equilibrium
states.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:59.333
And I tried to get that started
in the early part of

00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:04.067
the course by taking you
upstairs and doing this tank

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:08.733
experiment, where I had a
certain q in, and then I had a

00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:15.233
q out that depended on the
depth of the water.

00:18:15.233 --> 00:18:19.100
It depended on how much water
there was in the tank.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.833
And we tried to understand the
equilibrium states of this

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:22.933
simple system.

00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:25.300
And in a nutshell, this
is the way you do it.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:34.300
If you make an axis--a plot like
this, with rates on this

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:40.100
axis, and some measure of the
amount of water in this case,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.600
maybe it's the depth, z, on that
axis you can work out the

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.733
solution to this equilibrium
state graphically.

00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:52.733
For example, if I'm putting a
certain amount of water into

00:18:52.733 --> 00:18:58.000
this tank per unit, time, that
doesn't depend on how much

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.533
water I have in the tank.

00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:02.167
This is just, you know, how much
water am I squirting into

00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:03.500
the tank per unit time?

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.500
So that is a constant.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.767
That's the rate of inflow.

00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:13.233
But the rate of outflow will
depend on how much

00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:14.600
water is in the tank.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.433
The deeper the water, the more
pressure there is at the

00:19:18.433 --> 00:19:22.567
bottom pushing water
through that valve.

00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:25.867
And so if I make a plot here
of the outflow rate, versus

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:28.633
the depth of water in the
tank, it's going to look

00:19:28.633 --> 00:19:31.400
something like this.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.633
The deeper the water,
the faster the

00:19:33.633 --> 00:19:35.200
water will gush out.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.833
And there will be a crossing
point where the two are equal.

00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:42.533
That's the equilibrium state.

00:19:42.533 --> 00:19:45.333
Then the depth will remain
constant because the rate at

00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:48.533
which we are putting fluid in
balances the rate at which

00:19:48.533 --> 00:19:50.933
fluid is moving out.

00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:52.533
That's what I mean by an
equilibrium state.

00:19:52.533 --> 00:19:54.867
We saw this early
in the course.

00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:59.200
Now let's see if some of the
ways that we have run across

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.000
this in the atmosphere
are perhaps

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.100
not appreciated enough.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:08.833
For example, if we're
evaporating water from the

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:12.267
surface of the earth and putting
water vapor molecules

00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:16.867
into the atmosphere, when we
get enough water in the

00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:20.333
atmosphere, given the vertical
motions that are there from

00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:24.667
convection, from fronts, and
so on, we're going to

00:20:24.667 --> 00:20:27.267
eventually build up clouds.

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:32.867
And under some circumstances,
those clouds will precipitate.

00:20:32.867 --> 00:20:37.233
And generally speaking, the
amount of water you take out

00:20:37.233 --> 00:20:40.233
per unit time is going to be
related to how much water you

00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:41.467
have in the atmosphere.

00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:43.267
Well obviously, if you don't
have any water in the

00:20:43.267 --> 00:20:46.233
atmosphere, you can't
take any out.

00:20:46.233 --> 00:20:49.833
And if you've completely
saturated the atmosphere with

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.933
water, you're going to
be raining a lot out.

00:20:51.933 --> 00:20:58.067
So there is some curve like
this, where, again, rate would

00:20:58.067 --> 00:20:59.767
be on this axis.

00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:07.200
This might be the water vapor
content of the atmosphere.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.033
The rate at which we're putting
it in might depend a

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:14.333
little bit on water
vapor content.

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:18.067
But the rate at which we're
taking water out will

00:21:18.067 --> 00:21:23.233
certainly depend on the
water vapor content.

00:21:23.233 --> 00:21:25.800
And there will be a
crossover point.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.867
So the amount of water vapor in
the atmosphere is going to

00:21:27.867 --> 00:21:33.667
be sustained roughly at a level
where these two things

00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:36.367
can balance with time.

00:21:36.367 --> 00:21:39.067
And that's the way we think
about water vapor in the

00:21:39.067 --> 00:21:40.333
atmosphere.

00:21:42.967 --> 00:21:44.000
Let's do another one.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.333
Heat in the climate system.

00:21:46.333 --> 00:21:52.467
So the sun's radiation
is warming the earth.

00:21:52.467 --> 00:21:56.567
If it had--if it was ice cold,
or if it were colder than ice,

00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:59.467
if it were absolute zero
Kelvin, it would not be

00:21:59.467 --> 00:22:01.367
radiating to space.

00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:02.433
But it's not.

00:22:02.433 --> 00:22:05.700
It's at some temperature, so
its radiating to space as

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.767
well, in relationship
to its temperature.

00:22:07.767 --> 00:22:13.967
So if I make this plot again,
the rate will be the energy

00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:17.333
from the sun absorbed
on the earth.

00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:19.000
That's going to be independent
of the

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.133
temperature of the planet.

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:25.900
But the rate at which I'm
radiating to space is going to

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.633
be strongly dependent on the
temperature of the planet.

00:22:29.633 --> 00:22:31.867
Remember, it goes like
t to the fourth.

00:22:31.867 --> 00:22:35.700
The Stefan-Boltzmann law says
that this goes like

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.333
temperature to the
fourth power.

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:39.567
So there's some crossover
point.

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.867
And that's where we are most
of the time with the earth.

00:22:41.867 --> 00:22:47.267
We're at an equilibrium state
set by seeking out this

00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:50.700
balance between inflow
and outflow.

00:22:53.467 --> 00:22:56.367
I'll do two more and then we'll
I don't want to beat

00:22:56.367 --> 00:22:59.700
this too much to death but
it is so important.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.267
If I had a what's next if I had
a mountain glacier, snow

00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:14.933
falling on this glacier,
it's going to be

00:23:14.933 --> 00:23:16.167
flowing under gravity.

00:23:19.633 --> 00:23:24.667
So the rate at which I'm adding
snow to the top of this

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:27.400
is independent about how
much ice and snow

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.167
I have on the mountain.

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:30.167
That's just an atmospheric
thing, so the

00:23:30.167 --> 00:23:32.067
input is just constant.

00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:33.167
And this will be a measure.

00:23:33.167 --> 00:23:36.900
Let's call this the thickness
of the glacier.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.367
Thickness of the glacier.

00:23:40.367 --> 00:23:43.167
If it's really thin, it's not
going to flow, and there's not

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:45.000
going to be any ice leaving
the system.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.267
That is to say, running
down the mountainside.

00:23:48.267 --> 00:23:52.400
But as it gets thicker, now
gravity is going to be pulling

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.733
that ice down away
from this region.

00:23:55.733 --> 00:23:58.300
And that will be a
loss that will

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.167
increase with ice thickness.

00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:03.767
The system will seek
out an equilibrium

00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:05.967
where the snow falls.

00:24:05.967 --> 00:24:06.967
You've reached a balance.

00:24:06.967 --> 00:24:09.867
The amount of ice sliding down
the mountain is just equal

00:24:09.867 --> 00:24:12.633
every year to how much
snow has fallen.

00:24:12.633 --> 00:24:13.967
So you've reached
a steady-state

00:24:13.967 --> 00:24:15.600
system for the glacier.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.000
Now these glaciers are not
always in that steady state,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.633
but this is one of the
possibilities we should always

00:24:20.633 --> 00:24:23.467
investigate, to see whether
that system

00:24:23.467 --> 00:24:26.933
is in steady state.

00:24:26.933 --> 00:24:29.667
And the last one I had here was
the ozone layer, where you

00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:34.067
remember far above the earth
there is this ozone layer.

00:24:39.233 --> 00:24:40.900
You make ozone from oxygen.

00:24:43.633 --> 00:24:47.867
You photosynthesize it and
recombine it differently to

00:24:47.867 --> 00:24:49.267
make ozone.

00:24:49.267 --> 00:24:52.467
So the rate at which you are
making ozone, for our intents

00:24:52.467 --> 00:24:54.633
and purposes is pretty much
fixed, because you're not

00:24:54.633 --> 00:24:57.633
going to change that
very much.

00:24:57.633 --> 00:25:01.733
But the rate at which are
destroying ozone is going to

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:05.533
be proportional to how much
ozone you have. I showed you

00:25:05.533 --> 00:25:07.433
that chemical reaction, also.

00:25:07.433 --> 00:25:10.267
The more ozone you have, the
more chances that you'll

00:25:10.267 --> 00:25:13.100
dissociate an ozone, combine
them in such a way that

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.833
removes ozone from the system.

00:25:14.833 --> 00:25:18.733
So once again, you've got curves
generally like this.

00:25:18.733 --> 00:25:22.033
The input's relatively
independent of how much ozone

00:25:22.033 --> 00:25:27.167
you have. The loss rate is
proportional to how much ozone

00:25:27.167 --> 00:25:30.233
you have. So there's going to
be a crossing point, and

00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:32.100
that's going to be a
steady-state solution.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.733
Again, I'm not claiming that the
earth's ozone layer is in

00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:38.000
steady state, but that's one
possibility that we'd

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.267
want to look at.

00:25:39.267 --> 00:25:42.167
And then if it's not, we'd want
to understand why there

00:25:42.167 --> 00:25:44.000
are temporal changes going on.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.633
Why has that system not yet
reached its steady state?

00:25:50.633 --> 00:25:51.867
Questions there?

00:26:01.867 --> 00:26:06.500
So this idea of lapse rate and
static stability, we ran

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.700
across for the ocean
and the atmosphere.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.133
And for the atmosphere,
we did it this way.

00:26:14.133 --> 00:26:18.533
We plotted temperature
versus height.

00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:21.967
And we put reference lines
on there, which we

00:26:21.967 --> 00:26:24.367
call capital gamma.

00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:31.333
The dry adiabatic lapse rate was
about negative 9.8 degrees

00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:32.967
Celsius per kilometer.

00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:37.500
And we ran our reasoning about
whether an atmosphere would be

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.533
stable, just stay there in
layers, or whether it would

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:44.300
turn over and begin to
come back based on

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.300
this kind of an argument.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.567
This is for the atmosphere.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.867
For the ocean, we get a
little differently.

00:26:52.867 --> 00:26:57.700
We plot in density versus
height or depth.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.967
And we looked at various
possibilities.

00:27:00.967 --> 00:27:02.733
Our reference line there
was really a

00:27:02.733 --> 00:27:05.833
line of constant density.

00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:08.667
If the density increased
as you went up,

00:27:08.667 --> 00:27:10.567
that would be unstable.

00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:12.533
If the density increased
as you went down,

00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:14.733
that would be stable.

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:17.400
Why do we do the two
differently?

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.000
Well, the answer is clear.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.200
For atmospheres we're dealing
with a compressible substance.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.133
Gas is very compressible.

00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:31.700
And so we had to work out this
adiabatic lapse rate, and do

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.900
the argument this way.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.367
For water, it's incompressible
and it has the other

00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:37.600
components.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.900
It's got salinity
in it as well.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.933
Remember density is a function
of temperature and

00:27:42.933 --> 00:27:45.167
salinity in the ocean.

00:27:45.167 --> 00:27:47.500
So the fact that it's
incompressible and the fact

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.933
that salinity is involved makes
us do the argument a

00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:51.167
little bit differently.

00:27:51.167 --> 00:27:54.367
But the question we're
asking is the same.

00:27:54.367 --> 00:27:57.667
Is that column of fluid going to
stay stagnant in layers, or

00:27:57.667 --> 00:27:59.967
is it going to turn
over and mix?

00:27:59.967 --> 00:28:05.133
And that's important in
both spheres, the

00:28:05.133 --> 00:28:07.533
atmosphere and the ocean.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.833
Transport of heat
by fluid motion.

00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:21.767
So we've come across this
several times, but the idea is

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:28.167
if you have a pipe, let's say
with fluid passing through it,

00:28:28.167 --> 00:28:34.800
the volumetric flow rate
is a product of the

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.800
velocity and the area.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.067
Now it doesn't have to be
confined in a pipe.

00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:42.833
In the atmosphere or the ocean
it's not confined in a pipe.

00:28:42.833 --> 00:28:46.033
But still it's the area and the
velocity that gives you

00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:47.400
the volumetric flow rate.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.700
The mass flow rate
would be rho U a.

00:28:58.167 --> 00:29:03.100
The heat that you're pushing
through the pipe, well we got

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.033
the mass flow rate, and we know
that the amount of heat

00:29:06.033 --> 00:29:12.433
stored per unit mass is C p T.
So this is heat capacity times

00:29:12.433 --> 00:29:19.133
temperature times rho U A. If
that's water and you want know

00:29:19.133 --> 00:29:22.233
how much salt is being
transported, well it's the

00:29:22.233 --> 00:29:28.333
salinity times rho U A.

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:34.200
If it's some other pollutant,
like in the air, maybe it's

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.467
nitrous oxide, well then that
would be the concentration of

00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:45.233
no2 times rho U A, if that
is a ratio by mass.

00:29:45.233 --> 00:29:49.133
Be careful, be sure that's a
ratio by mass if you're going

00:29:49.133 --> 00:29:50.733
to use it that way.

00:29:50.733 --> 00:29:55.067
So anyway, this is a common
theme we ran across in the

00:29:55.067 --> 00:29:57.567
atmosphere and the ocean.

00:29:57.567 --> 00:30:01.267
And this is related to the next
one on the list, which is

00:30:01.267 --> 00:30:10.067
the general idea of
concentration, where if you

00:30:10.067 --> 00:30:14.167
put a substance and mix it into
a background fluid, we're

00:30:14.167 --> 00:30:17.567
very interested in the
concentration, which is how

00:30:17.567 --> 00:30:21.500
much did you put in, compared
to how much

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.900
you've mixed it into.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.967
So for example, when I write
down, when I say this co2 in

00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:30.700
brackets, I'm referring to the

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.200
concentration of carbon dioxide.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:42.300
And that could be either the
mass of co2 over the mass of

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.400
air, or it could be the
molecules, the number of

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.433
molecules of co2 versus the
number of molecules of air.

00:30:58.533 --> 00:31:00.700
So remember which one
you're dealing with.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.433
Neither of these ratios has
units but you do have to

00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:10.600
remember whether it's a mass
ratio or a molecular ratio.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.233
This one is usually called "by
volume." And this one we would

00:31:16.233 --> 00:31:22.067
say that's a ratio "by mass."
Taking into account by mass.

00:31:22.067 --> 00:31:25.200
So you have to know how much
you put in, and into what

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.467
volume have you mixed it, and
the longer you wait for it to

00:31:29.467 --> 00:31:34.167
mix into a larger and larger
volume, you have diluted it.

00:31:34.167 --> 00:31:37.300
The same amount of material
added, but mixed into a larger

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.400
and larger amount, the
concentration will drop

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.233
because you're diluting it
into a larger background.

00:31:47.833 --> 00:31:53.733
And that brings us to the last
one, which is this a question

00:31:53.733 --> 00:31:57.733
that's always fascinated me
about the degree of symmetry

00:31:57.733 --> 00:32:01.167
between the northern and
southern hemisphere.

00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:08.400
So here we have our planet, our
home planet and it spins

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.267
in that direction.

00:32:10.267 --> 00:32:14.833
And to what extent are the
northern and southern

00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:17.067
hemispheres similar
or different?

00:32:17.067 --> 00:32:20.133
Is there some kind of symmetry
between the northern and

00:32:20.133 --> 00:32:20.633
southern hemispheres?

00:32:20.633 --> 00:32:23.867
So I'll end up with a brief
discussion of this.

00:32:23.867 --> 00:32:29.967
So we know that the seasons are
reversed between the two

00:32:29.967 --> 00:32:30.800
hemispheres.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.767
And that has to do with the
tilt of the earth, right?

00:32:33.767 --> 00:32:38.100
So if the sun's over there, at
this moment the northern

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.333
hemisphere is tilted towards
well not at this moment.

00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:46.467
At this moment, in December,
it's like that, right?

00:32:46.467 --> 00:32:50.200
At this moment, the northern
hemisphere is tilted away from

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.867
the sun, southern hemisphere
towards.

00:32:51.867 --> 00:32:55.267
So it's southern hemisphere
it's summer, and then six

00:32:55.267 --> 00:32:57.300
months later, when the earth is
going around to the other

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.767
side of the sun,
it's like this.

00:33:00.767 --> 00:33:03.800
And the northern hemisphere
has its summer.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.467
So there's an opposite sense of
the timing of the seasons

00:33:08.467 --> 00:33:10.267
between the two hemispheres.

00:33:10.267 --> 00:33:13.033
What about the Coriolis
force and storms?

00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:16.600
Well that's the opposite in
the two hemispheres, too.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.233
But for a different reason.

00:33:18.233 --> 00:33:19.900
It has nothing to do with
the tilt of the earth.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.500
It has to do with the
spin of the earth.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.200
The fact that it appears to spin
this way in the northern

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.767
hemisphere, but the opposite
direction in the southern

00:33:28.767 --> 00:33:29.867
hemisphere.

00:33:29.867 --> 00:33:34.767
So that cyclones move
counterclockwise in the

00:33:34.767 --> 00:33:37.800
northern hemisphere, but
clockwise in the southern

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.567
hemisphere.

00:33:38.567 --> 00:33:42.567
And that applies to the
atmosphere and the ocean.

00:33:42.567 --> 00:33:45.067
Coreolis force is reverse
between the two.

00:33:45.067 --> 00:33:52.700
Therefore, things just spin
differently in the two

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.833
hemispheres.

00:33:54.833 --> 00:34:00.200
Now, are there any other
aspects of symmetry?

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.000
Well, one thing that's different
between the two

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.767
hemispheres is the
amount of land.

00:34:07.767 --> 00:34:10.733
If you look at that one,
there's a fairly large

00:34:10.733 --> 00:34:12.000
fraction of land.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.833
I want to get this base
out of the way, so

00:34:15.833 --> 00:34:17.633
I'll do it this way.

00:34:17.633 --> 00:34:22.867
If you look at it that way,
there's much less land.

00:34:22.867 --> 00:34:27.467
And as we know, land and ocean
have different heat storage

00:34:27.467 --> 00:34:29.933
capabilities.

00:34:29.933 --> 00:34:33.933
The ocean can store heat
powerfully, because not only

00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:40.200
does it have a high specific
heat capacity, C p, but also,

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.400
when you heat, put heat at the
top of the ocean, it mixes it

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.333
in, because it's a fluid.

00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:48.333
So you may have to mix heat.

00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:52.033
Heat can be stored easily in the
first hundred meters or so

00:34:52.033 --> 00:34:54.467
of the ocean, and that's
an enormous mass.

00:34:54.467 --> 00:34:59.767
Where when I had heat to a
continent, it only goes in

00:34:59.767 --> 00:35:01.333
about that much.

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:04.933
Or maybe over a season, between
winter and summer, it

00:35:04.933 --> 00:35:08.300
will go in about that much.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.233
As compared to 100 meters
for the ocean.

00:35:12.233 --> 00:35:16.300
So the heat storage capacity is
very different between land

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.767
and sea, and the northern
hemisphere has much more land

00:35:19.767 --> 00:35:20.933
than the southern hemisphere.

00:35:20.933 --> 00:35:28.833
So there's going to be that
asymmetry between the two.

00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:31.233
And there's also a little
different configuration, I

00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:34.133
want to remind you,
near the poles.

00:35:34.133 --> 00:35:36.567
When it comes to this
question of Arctic

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:38.200
sea ice, for example.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.933
The Arctic Ocean is a little
it's an ocean surrounded by

00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:51.200
land, whereas in the southern
hemisphere, it's land

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.467
surrounded by ocean, right?

00:35:53.467 --> 00:35:56.200
So this interaction between
the ocean and the land is

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.267
quite different at the high
latitudes in the two

00:35:59.267 --> 00:36:00.433
hemispheres.

00:36:00.433 --> 00:36:04.833
For example, Antarctic bottom
water, which is water formed

00:36:04.833 --> 00:36:09.433
near the Antarctic coast, the
densest water in the sea drops

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:11.300
down to the bottom and
flows northward.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.633
There's no equivalent to that
in the northern hemisphere,

00:36:14.633 --> 00:36:18.133
because that geometry
is different.

00:36:18.133 --> 00:36:23.367
So these are fundamental ideas
and I think I'll leave it

00:36:23.367 --> 00:36:26.033
there, and thank you and good
luck on the final exam.

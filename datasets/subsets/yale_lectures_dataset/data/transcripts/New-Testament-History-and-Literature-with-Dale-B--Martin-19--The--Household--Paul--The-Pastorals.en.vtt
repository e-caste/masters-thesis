00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.514
Prof: What we're doing
this week is extending our

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:08.252
conversation we started last
week about how was Paul used as

00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:10.470
a figure in early Christianity.
 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.500
Today we're going to talk about
the Pastoral Epistles,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.920
which is I and II Timothy and
Titus,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.227
and then next time we'll talk
about The Acts of Paul and

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.649
Thecla because these are two
practically opposite ways of

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:26.242
interpreting Paul and using Paul
that came about probably in the

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.440
second century.
 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.808
The Pastoral Epistles are
called "pastoral"

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:36.850
because it presents Paul as
writing to Timothy and Titus,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.081
two of his followers,
but he's telling them how to be

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.760
good pastors of a church.
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.551
In fact he's also doing
something like almost acting

00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:48.450
like they're going to become
bishops;

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.789
they are also supposed to be
appointing other people as

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.150
pastors of churches.
 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.632
We call these the Pastoral
Epistles because it presents

00:00:56.632 --> 00:01:00.307
Paul as himself serving in a
sort of pastoral role for his

00:01:00.307 --> 00:01:04.305
churches and assigning Timothy
and Titus pastoral roles for his

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:07.030
churches also,
and establishing leadership

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.816
positions,
what kind of leadership

00:01:08.816 --> 00:01:11.170
structures he wants to go on in
the churches.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.462
Most of us scholars believe
that these letters are

00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:15.468
pseudonymous.
 

00:01:15.468 --> 00:01:17.010
We don't believe Paul wrote
them.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.724
There has been some question in
the last several years that

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:24.504
maybe the actual historical Paul
wrote II Timothy because II

00:01:24.504 --> 00:01:28.283
Timothy looks sort of like a
last will and testament of Paul

00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:30.909
that he may have written in
prison.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.750
But I don't tend to buy that.
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.402
I tend to group all three of
them together as being probably

00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:38.560
by the same author and all being
pseudonymous.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.440
Why do we think they're
pseudonymous?

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.590
Well again, as we saw with
Ephesians and Colossians,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.042
the writing style in these
letters is very different from

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:51.050
the seven letters that scholars
all agree Paul actually wrote,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.640
so the writing style is a big
issue.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.402
As I'll show today there are a
lot of ways of seeing that these

00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:59.498
letters simply presuppose a
different stage in early

00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:00.530
Christianity.
 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.230
They don't look like they're
from the more primitive sort of

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.430
time of when Paul was actually
founding churches.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.117
The theology looks different,
the church structure looks

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:13.140
different,
as I'll talk about,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.592
positions on the household,
on marriage,

00:02:15.592 --> 00:02:18.937
on slavery, on family,
on women, all of these things

00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:19.949
are different.
 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.254
I'm using the Pastoral Epistles
in this lecture as one

00:02:24.254 --> 00:02:28.479
illustration of how Christianity
changes in different

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.860
trajectories.
 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.878
One trajectory becomes very
much pro-household.

00:02:33.878 --> 00:02:38.330
The traditional Roman style or
Greco-Roman family is promoted

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.115
as the Christian way for
families to be and even the

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:46.122
church itself is molded to look
like a household with a

00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:49.776
paterfamilias,
the head of the household on

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:52.979
top, women below that,
children and slaves below that.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:56.210
When we get to The Acts of
Paul and Thecla, we'll see

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.550
that that interpretation of Paul
makes Paul anti-household.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.622
He actually is presented as
going around preaching against

00:03:02.622 --> 00:03:03.947
marriage,
against sex,

00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:07.548
against the Roman household,
and preaching a very kind of

00:03:07.548 --> 00:03:10.075
hierarchical disrupting,
even city-,

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:14.204
polis-disrupting Gospel
and certainly a household- and

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:16.199
family-disrupting Apostle.
 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.258
These two trajectories of
Pauline Christianity show the

00:03:20.258 --> 00:03:23.639
diversity of Christianity as it
developed,

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.800
and even how they used the same
figure,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.168
Paul, as founder of
Christianity in radically

00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:30.470
different ways.
 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.020
When did these letters come
about?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.940
It's everybody guess.
 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.818
I actually tend to think that
the Pastoral Epistles were

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:40.490
probably written sometime in the
second century,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.610
and maybe even toward the
middle of the second century.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.888
That's a bit later than a lot
of scholars would put them,

00:03:46.888 --> 00:03:48.818
and we're just guessing anyway.
 

00:03:48.818 --> 00:03:51.645
We sort of have to imagine what
kind of level of early

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:53.992
Christianity,
what kind of phase of early

00:03:53.992 --> 00:03:57.090
Christianity do we imagine
taking place before we can get

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.296
this kind of a letter with this
kind of theology and church

00:04:00.296 --> 00:04:01.568
structure written.
 

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:05.413
It is interesting that when we
talked about Marcion early,

00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:09.191
remember the heretic in Rome
who made his own first Canon

00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:11.348
list of New Testament books?
 

00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:14.144
Remember he included Luke as
his Gospel in his own edited

00:04:14.144 --> 00:04:16.740
version of it and he included
the letters of Paul.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.112
We don't have any evidence that
Marcion actually knew about

00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:23.019
these three letters,
I and II Timothy and Titus.

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:26.720
If Marcion was writing in the
middle of the second century,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.339
maybe Marcion,
if he didn't mention them,

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.516
maybe he didn't know them,
and maybe that's evidence that

00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:33.615
they weren't yet highly
circulated so that's one of the

00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:35.250
things that people have talked
about,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.829
the dating of these letters.
 

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:39.644
Since Marcion didn't seem to
know them, perhaps they were

00:04:39.644 --> 00:04:42.762
either just being written or not
long written around the middle

00:04:42.762 --> 00:04:44.069
of the second century.
 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:49.716
First let me back up because I
want to go through Paul really

00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:55.271
quickly and talk about what
Paul's own view of the household

00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:55.930
is.
 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.718
Look with me in 1 Corinthians
7, we're going to review some

00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:01.795
things that we've gone on before
but keep your Bibles in front of

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:02.180
you.
 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:12.771
Look at 1 Corinthians 7:1:
Concerning the matters about

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.649
which you wrote,
"it is well for a man not

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:15.709
to touch a woman."
 

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.884
But because of cases of sexual
immorality each man should have

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.278
his own wife and each woman her
own husband;

00:05:21.278 --> 00:05:23.790
the husband should give his
wife her conjugal rights,

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.480
likewise the wife to her
husband.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.629
Notice how Paul balances these
things.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.204
He tells basically the man,
you have control of the body of

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:32.911
your wife, but he also tells to
the woman, you have control of

00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:34.199
the body of your husband.
 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.649
There's something of
reciprocity in 1 Corinthians 7.

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:42.065
This will be important because
that kind of reciprocity doesn't

00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:44.600
exist when you get to the
Pastoral Epistles.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.100
That's one thing to notice.
 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.252
Verse 5:
Do not deprive one another

00:05:50.252 --> 00:05:52.812
except perhaps by agreement for
a set time to devote yourselves

00:05:52.812 --> 00:05:53.350
to prayer.
 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.538
Then come together again so
that Satan may not tempt you

00:05:55.538 --> 00:05:57.089
because of your lack of self
control.

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.740
This I say by way of
concession, not of command.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.165
I wish that all were as I
myself am but each has a

00:06:02.165 --> 00:06:04.939
particular gift from God,
one having one kind and another

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:05.980
a different kind.
 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.639
Notice he's basically saying,
have sex within marriage.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.666
He's not condemning sex,
but he really prefers that all

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:16.800
Christians be single like he
himself is.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.668
Paul's preference is not
marriage and sex within

00:06:19.668 --> 00:06:20.339
marriage.
 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.423
That's a concession that he
gives for people that he says

00:06:23.423 --> 00:06:24.910
can't control themselves.
 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.793
To the unmarried and widows,
I say that it is well for them

00:06:28.793 --> 00:06:32.127
to remain unmarried as I am,
but if they are not practicing

00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:33.470
self control they should marry.
 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.029
It is better to marry than to
burn.

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.180
That's what the Greek actually
says, "It is better to

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.199
marry than to burn."
 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.134
That's been an interesting
question of scholars,

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:42.779
what does he mean by
"burn"?

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.050
Does he mean burn in hell?
 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.588
That it's better to marry than
to be tempted to sin with sex

00:06:46.588 --> 00:06:48.740
outside of marriage and then
you'd burn in hell?

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.120
I've argued that what he means
is "burn with desire"

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.500
because it was very common in
ancient Greek culture to portray

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.879
any kind of erotic desire as
actually a physical burning.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:00.560
They even portrayed it as a
disease.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.810
When you start having that
itchy feeling that we all know

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.959
so well,
that's because your body is

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:09.512
actually heating up,
and that's what causes that

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:10.199
desire.
 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.870
The ancient Greek doctors,
Greek and Roman doctors,

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.656
gave all kinds of prescriptions
to people to control that

00:07:16.656 --> 00:07:19.591
burning so they can control
their erotic desire because they

00:07:19.591 --> 00:07:21.829
felt like it made you actually
unhealthy.

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:25.810
Desire was unhealthy and sexual
activity was dangerous.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.273
This was a concern throughout
the ancient world and I think

00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:29.759
that's what Paul's talking
about.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.048
What I've argued,
and have argued this in my

00:07:32.048 --> 00:07:34.550
Corinthian body book and a few
other places,

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.449
is that Paul actually prefers
that people avoid sex entirely,

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:40.740
Christians avoid sex entirely.
 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.863
If they can't avoid sex
entirely, and they're starting

00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:45.470
to have sexual desire burning in
them and that gets dangerous,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.004
then they should get married
and have sex but only to

00:07:49.004 --> 00:07:50.569
decrease the burning.
 

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:54.322
What Paul wants is for them to
experience sexual intercourse,

00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:57.199
even in marriage,
without any erotic desire.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:00.185
Now that's kind of a radical
idea but I believe that's

00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:02.439
actually what Paul was teaching
here,

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:05.874
is that he concedes it possible
that Christians could have sex

00:08:05.874 --> 00:08:09.250
without experiencing desire,
and that's his goal.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.735
Notice Paul doesn't have a very
positive view of sex,

00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:15.951
even within marriage,
it's a concession he allows

00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:16.689
people.
 

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:20.122
Notice in none of this passage
does he talk at all about having

00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:20.509
kids.
 

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:24.884
Sexuality for Paul is not to
make children in Paul's own

00:08:24.884 --> 00:08:25.680
letters.
 

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.379
You have sex in marriage only
to keep you from desiring.

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:31.129
That's Paul's concern.
 

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:34.029
That will change later.
 

00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:36.907
That's one place where--we also
saw in I Thessalonians 4,

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:39.629
if you'll remember,
we had this same kind of thing.

00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:43.500
There, Paul is just talking to
the men of the congregation and

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.990
he says, don't you start wanting
your brother's wife.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.224
He calls them skeuos,
your vessel,

00:08:49.224 --> 00:08:52.519
he says, "Each of you
should have your vessel."

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:56.250
And the debate is whether he's
talking about their genitalia,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.070
which is one possible
interpretation of the Greek,

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.200
or their wife's body,
which is another possible

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.590
interpretation of the Greek.
 

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.928
For Paul, in I Thessalonians 4,
he's telling men also,

00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:08.923
control yourself--and he says,
"Not in passion of desire

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.070
like the Gentiles,"
so there again,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.690
in I Thessalonians,
4, Paul is really concerned

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.255
that the Thessalonian disciples
are not lusting after their

00:09:19.255 --> 00:09:21.460
fellow Christian's wife.
 

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.461
Keep your own vessel,
and that's how your control

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:26.379
yourself.
 

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:29.610
And notice again he's excluding
the idea of passion and desire.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.720
It just does not have a part in
it.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.009
I admit that this is kind of a
radical argument,

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:37.226
and there are a lot of people
out there who haven't bought my

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:38.859
argument,
but that seems to me to be

00:09:38.859 --> 00:09:40.460
precisely what the text is
saying.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.624
Paul never allows for a good
notion of sexual pleasure or

00:09:45.624 --> 00:09:47.100
sexual desire.
 

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.216
He seems to want to exclude it
in order to keep you from

00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:53.275
experiencing desire and he
believes that he can do that

00:09:53.275 --> 00:09:54.580
even by having sex.
 

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.418
In those ways we see Paul is
not anti-marriage exactly,

00:09:58.418 --> 00:10:00.019
but he's certainly not
pro-marriage,

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:04.528
and he's not anti-sex exactly,
but he's certainly is not

00:10:04.528 --> 00:10:05.350
pro-sex.
 

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.265
The one thing he does seem to
be anti is desire,

00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:10.600
sexual desire.
 

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.340
All right, where do women fit
in all this?

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.710
I pointed out that in I
Thessalonians 4 Paul doesn't

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.418
seem to think about women at all
there.

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:22.400
In fact, I even proposed when I
lectured on I Thessalonians that

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.200
by the time Paul wrote that
letter,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.600
which is one of his earliest
letters,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.370
maybe the earliest letter we
have in the Canon,

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.501
Paul may have been conceiving
of the Christian group as being

00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:33.424
sort of a male club because
that's the way he tends to be

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:34.470
talking to them.
 

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.538
A male club of mainly working
class manual laborers.

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:40.471
That's changed by the time we
get to I Corinthians,

00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:40.940
right?
 

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.678
Because Paul directly talks
about women a lot,

00:10:43.678 --> 00:10:46.950
he sees women as being in
something like a co-relationship

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.450
with their husbands and sexual
activity in I Corinthians 7.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.418
He addresses women as leaders
of churches at times.

00:10:54.418 --> 00:11:00.360
So by the time Paul writes I
Corinthians, women are

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.538
acknowledged as an important
part of his churches.

00:11:06.538 --> 00:11:11.804
But in 1 Corinthians 11,
look there, he doesn't have

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:17.690
women on a completely equal
stance with men apparently.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.211
In I Corinthians 11 he says:
I commend you because you

00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:23.666
remember me in everything and
maintain the traditions just as

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:24.730
I handed them onto you.
 

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.886
But I want you to understand
that Christ is the head of every

00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:31.150
man and the husband is ahead of
the wife as God is ahead of the

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.730
church.
 

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.186
There is a clear hierarchy
there, and Paul goes on to talk

00:11:34.186 --> 00:11:36.859
about what this is going to have
to do with women veiling their

00:11:36.859 --> 00:11:38.538
heads when they pray and
prophesy,

00:11:38.538 --> 00:11:44.777
which another very complicated
and controversial passage in

00:11:44.777 --> 00:11:45.529
Paul.
 

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:49.129
It's clear that Paul views,
just as he views God as the

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:51.514
head of Christ,
that is Christ of being

00:11:51.514 --> 00:11:54.298
somewhat inferior person
compared to God the Father,

00:11:54.298 --> 00:11:57.884
so women are in an inferior
position with regard to their

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:58.590
husbands.
 

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.690
The Greek words here,
they're just the words for

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.330
"man"
and "woman."

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.783
But since the Greek doesn't
have special terms for

00:12:06.783 --> 00:12:08.785
"husband"
and "wife,"

00:12:08.785 --> 00:12:11.639
when you see a Greek term like
this in this context,

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:14.570
you have to make the decision:
are you going to translate this

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.442
as "man"
or "woman,"

00:12:16.442 --> 00:12:19.374
and make this a generic kind of
idea that women in general are

00:12:19.374 --> 00:12:21.918
supposed to be subordinated to
men in general,

00:12:21.918 --> 00:12:23.988
or do you take the terms and
translate them into

00:12:23.988 --> 00:12:25.879
"husband"
and "wife."

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.250
Both translations are fine,
as far as the Greek goes,

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.532
and then you're taking that
sort of inferiority

00:12:30.532 --> 00:12:33.360
subordination complex to be
something that's talking about

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.750
with husbands and wives.
 

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:49.710
Look at I Corinthians 14:33:
As in all the churches of the

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.822
saints,
women should be silent in the

00:12:51.822 --> 00:12:54.461
churches for they are not
permitted to speak but should be

00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:56.129
subordinate as the law also
says.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:57.955
If there is anything they
desire to know,

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.690
let them ask their husbands at
home.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.004
For it is shameful for a women
to speak in church,

00:13:02.004 --> 00:13:03.941
or did the word of God
originate with you,

00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:06.019
or are you the only ones it has
reached?

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:09.696
That's odd, he seems to telling
the women not to speak in church

00:13:09.696 --> 00:13:11.628
at all,
although previously he had

00:13:11.628 --> 00:13:14.585
given instructions for how they
could pray and prophesy in

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.919
church as long as they are
wearing a veil.

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:18.558
What is going on here?
 

00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:22.024
Also, doesn't this have
something--have something of a

00:13:22.024 --> 00:13:25.948
conflict with Galatians 3:28
which is a famous verse in which

00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:29.128
Paul says,
"In Christ there is no Jew

00:13:29.128 --> 00:13:31.793
nor Greek,
there's no free or slave,

00:13:31.793 --> 00:13:34.259
there's no male and
female."

00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:37.729
Now that verse has been
interpreted, especially since

00:13:37.729 --> 00:13:41.865
the 1970s, as teaching that Paul
taught the equality of men and

00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:44.501
women in Christ;
if in Christ there's no male

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:46.549
and female doesn't that mean
they're equal?

00:13:46.549 --> 00:13:47.308
Yes sir.
 

00:13:47.308 --> 00:13:47.870
Student:  What letter is
that?

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.120
Prof: Galatians 3:28.
 

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.044
This has been an argument,
this is why I'm talking about

00:13:54.044 --> 00:13:56.299
the stuff--
those of you who are writing

00:13:56.299 --> 00:13:57.779
papers this week need to talk
about,

00:13:57.779 --> 00:13:59.269
but notice this is complex.
 

00:13:59.269 --> 00:14:03.442
You've got Galatians 3:28 that
looks like an egalitarian

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.912
statement,
except a very famous biblical

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:12.134
scholar wrote an article arguing
that Galatians 3:28 is not an

00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:17.100
egalitarian statement because
Paul was talking about in the

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:22.341
resurrection human beings--
Christians will be androgynes,

00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:25.928
that they'll be male/female
combinations,

00:14:25.928 --> 00:14:31.241
and in that male/female
combination the masculinity is

00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:36.955
still superior to femininity
even in the androgyne body of

00:14:36.955 --> 00:14:39.058
the resurrection.
 

00:14:39.058 --> 00:14:43.100
Is Galatians 3:28 an
egalitarian statement by Paul?

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.389
Some people say yes.
 

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:47.149
Is it not an egalitarian
statement by Paul?

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:49.830
I say it's not.
 

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.658
That's a complicated argument
also.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:57.139
If Galatians 3:28 is an
egalitarian statement,

00:14:57.139 --> 00:15:00.451
how does that fit then with
this 1 Corinthians 14 passage

00:15:00.451 --> 00:15:04.059
where Paul seems to be saying
women should be silent in church

00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:06.730
and be subordinate,
ask your husband at home.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.226
Did any of you notice that
those verses I just read in 1

00:15:10.226 --> 00:15:13.471
Corinthians 14 are in some
translations in brackets,

00:15:13.471 --> 00:15:14.678
in parentheses?
 

00:15:14.678 --> 00:15:18.515
How many people have a
translation of 1 Corinthians

00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:22.274
14:34-36 that's in either
brackets or parentheses?

00:15:22.274 --> 00:15:23.808
Raise your hand.
 

00:15:23.808 --> 00:15:26.085
How many people have a
translation where they're not in

00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:27.558
brackets or parentheses,
anybody?

00:15:27.558 --> 00:15:30.168
Okay, so some of you don't have
them in brackets.

00:15:30.168 --> 00:15:33.047
That's showing you that these
editors are not sure whether

00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:35.470
that was actually part of the
original letter.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.080
There's a dispute here.
 

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.870
If you looked at your footnotes
of your Bible,

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.490
your footnotes might even say,
"some ancient

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.004
authorities"
don't include this or include

00:15:44.004 --> 00:15:46.080
these verses in a different
place.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.221
This is the issue,
and we do have some Greek

00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:51.114
texts,
some Greek manuscripts that

00:15:51.114 --> 00:15:53.720
either don't have these verses
or have them in a different

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.679
place in the text.
 

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:56.519
Well how would that happen?
 

00:15:56.519 --> 00:16:01.980
Well, the idea goes that some
scribe,

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.778
at some point,
was copying over I Corinthians

00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:10.783
14 and got to the point where
this is in the text and wrote

00:16:10.783 --> 00:16:14.033
out in the margin,
well wait a minute this is not

00:16:14.033 --> 00:16:16.390
right because of course the
scribes are living at a later

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.960
time when women definitely were
in a more inferior position in

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.548
churches.
 

00:16:19.548 --> 00:16:21.379
They couldn't be priests,
they couldn't be bishops and

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:23.822
this sort of thing,
and that scribe writes in,

00:16:23.822 --> 00:16:26.380
well no,
of course, women can't do that,

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.019
so there's a little note that
occurs there on the margins of

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:30.759
the text.
 

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:33.346
Other scribes come along and
find this manuscript and they

00:16:33.346 --> 00:16:35.889
decide, well that shouldn't be
out here in the margin;

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:37.610
that should go into the text
someplace.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.203
So one scribe copying it over
puts that excerpt in this part

00:16:41.203 --> 00:16:44.980
of the text and another one puts
it in this part of the text in

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.259
different places.
 

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:49.220
And then those manuscripts are
copied over by other scribes.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.179
And you end up with Greek
manuscripts with these verses in

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.889
different places in I
Corinthians 14.

00:16:55.889 --> 00:17:00.275
Some scholars have said that
all looks like those verses that

00:17:00.275 --> 00:17:04.663
teach the subordination of women
in I Corinthians 14 were not

00:17:04.663 --> 00:17:09.269
originally by Paul but were a
later scribal interpolation,

00:17:09.269 --> 00:17:11.788
insertion into the text.
 

00:17:11.788 --> 00:17:15.630
Other scholars disagree with
that, and they think that these

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.558
verses were original with I
Corinthians 14.

00:17:18.558 --> 00:17:20.281
In other words,
I've given you a lot of

00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:21.368
problems to deal with.
 

00:17:21.368 --> 00:17:24.327
If you're going to talk about
what was Paul's view of women

00:17:24.327 --> 00:17:26.776
you've got to figure out,
well, what do you think

00:17:26.776 --> 00:17:28.509
Galatians 3:28 really teaches.
 

00:17:28.509 --> 00:17:30.700
Is it an egalitarian statement
or not?

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.864
Is I Corinthians 14--these
verses--is that part of Paul's

00:17:33.864 --> 00:17:35.390
original teaching or not?
 

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.836
Then you've got the situation
where in Romans 16,

00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:42.930
several verses in Romans 16,
Paul actually addresses women

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.868
as leaders of churches.
 

00:17:44.868 --> 00:17:47.893
There are places where Paul is
willing to talk to women as

00:17:47.893 --> 00:17:49.058
leaders of churches.
 

00:17:49.058 --> 00:17:51.808
In fact, one of the verses in I
Corinthians 16,

00:17:51.808 --> 00:17:56.380
Paul addresses two people,
Andronicus and Junia,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.046
and he says,
"These are esteemed among

00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:00.380
the Apostles."
 

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.733
"Among the Apostles,"
that sounds like he's actually

00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:06.980
saying that Andronicus and Junia
are themselves Apostles.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.877
And Paul thinks himself--the
Apostles, in Paul's view,

00:18:09.877 --> 00:18:12.118
doesn't include just the
twelve, right?

00:18:12.118 --> 00:18:14.772
Because he thinks he's an
Apostle and he's not one of the

00:18:14.772 --> 00:18:15.200
twelve.
 

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.934
The word "Apostle"
for Paul is wider than the

00:18:18.934 --> 00:18:22.808
twelve, and it refers to people
who go out and spread the

00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:23.568
Gospel.
 

00:18:23.568 --> 00:18:27.656
Apparently, Paul is calling two
people, Andronicus and Junia,

00:18:27.656 --> 00:18:30.108
"Apostles"
in Romans 16.

00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:32.491
Interestingly enough,
that word "Junia,"

00:18:32.491 --> 00:18:35.068
that might be in your
translation as "Junia"

00:18:35.068 --> 00:18:37.574
nowadays,
but in older English versions,

00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:39.944
it was translated as
"Junias,"

00:18:39.944 --> 00:18:41.828
which would be a man's name.
 

00:18:41.828 --> 00:18:43.656
In Latin, if you add an
"s"

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:45.838
on that word it looks like a
man's name,

00:18:45.838 --> 00:18:47.048
if you don't have the
"s,"

00:18:47.048 --> 00:18:48.118
it looks like a woman's name.
 

00:18:48.118 --> 00:18:51.220
There was debate among scholars
about how to translate it.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.244
It looks the same basically in
Greek because of the way the

00:18:54.244 --> 00:18:55.808
word occurs in the sentence.
 

00:18:55.808 --> 00:18:57.946
When you translated it,
are you going to make it a

00:18:57.946 --> 00:18:59.298
man's name or a woman's name?
 

00:18:59.298 --> 00:19:01.846
People had always made it a
man's name.

00:19:01.846 --> 00:19:02.250
Why?
 

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.289
Because scholars just
thought--of course all these

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:06.704
scholars are men themselves
throughout hundreds of years of

00:19:06.704 --> 00:19:07.810
tradition--
they thought,

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.220
well you can't have a woman
Apostle,

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.338
so it must be a man's name.
 

00:19:11.338 --> 00:19:15.086
In the seventies some feminist
biblical scholars came along and

00:19:15.086 --> 00:19:17.143
pointed out that
"Junias"

00:19:17.143 --> 00:19:20.163
is a very,
very, very rare man's name but

00:19:20.163 --> 00:19:23.690
"Junia"
is a very common woman's name,

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.815
and argued again through
textual criticism that Paul

00:19:26.815 --> 00:19:29.450
originally was addressing a
woman, Junia.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.617
And now you have basically most
scholars admitting that this is

00:19:32.617 --> 00:19:33.130
a woman.
 

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.108
It's a woman's name.
 

00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:36.692
Paul was addressing a man,
Andronicus, and a woman,

00:19:36.692 --> 00:19:38.759
Junia, and calling them both
Apostles.

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:42.778
There's some evidence that Paul
actually doesn't have such a

00:19:42.778 --> 00:19:46.660
negative view of women if he's
going to allow them to have

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.180
leadership roles in his
churches.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.450
So you've got Paul in rather
confusing situations.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.098
Is Paul a feminist?
 

00:19:54.098 --> 00:20:00.990
Is he for egalitarian theology
with men and women?

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.633
How does this relate to these
different issues that come up in

00:20:03.633 --> 00:20:04.240
his letters?
 

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.224
Those are Paul's basic views of
both marriage and the family,

00:20:09.224 --> 00:20:12.048
and sex, and the roles of
women.

00:20:12.048 --> 00:20:15.175
Often in early Christianity,
in the history of Christianity,

00:20:15.175 --> 00:20:16.818
these two things go together.
 

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:20.221
What a text is going to teach
about the role of women in the

00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:23.738
church and in the world often
has something to do with what it

00:20:23.738 --> 00:20:25.410
teaches about the family.
 

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.778
Most of the time when a text is
really, really pro-family,

00:20:29.778 --> 00:20:33.920
they teach the subordination of
women more directly.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.656
When they're anti-family,
they often tend to allow women

00:20:38.656 --> 00:20:41.930
bigger roles in their
congregations.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.970
So it's kind of a pairing that
goes along,

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.944
and that's exactly what we'll
see this week when we see the

00:20:46.944 --> 00:20:50.125
Pastoral Epistles that take Paul
down the pro-family anti-woman

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:53.160
route,
and The Acts of Paul and

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.016
Thecla,
which takes Paul down the

00:20:57.016 --> 00:21:00.108
anti-family pro-woman route.
 

00:21:00.108 --> 00:21:03.240
Let's look at the Pastorals,
first.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.759
What is this author in I
Timothy attacking?

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:09.200
I'm going to spend most of my
time in I Timothy because that's

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.519
where I can get these examples.
 

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:13.214
A lot of this stuff occurs in
the letter to Titus also because

00:21:13.214 --> 00:21:15.821
the letter to Titus repeats a
lot of the stuff that's in the

00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:17.059
first letter of Timothy.
 

00:21:17.059 --> 00:21:21.280
In I Timothy 1:3,
I urge you, as I did when I was

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.154
on my way to Macedonia,
to remain in Ephesus so that

00:21:24.154 --> 00:21:27.017
you may instruct certain people
not to teach any different

00:21:27.017 --> 00:21:29.367
doctrine,
not to occupy themselves with

00:21:29.367 --> 00:21:32.942
myths and endless genealogies
that promote speculations rather

00:21:32.942 --> 00:21:35.930
than the divine training that is
known by faith.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:41.529
This and vain discussions and
genealogies--in I Timothy 4:7 he

00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:45.019
talks about godless and silly
myths.

00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:49.790
Titus 1:10 and 14 also--and he
also in Titus says that he's

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:54.808
against people who are teaching
circumcision and Jewish myths,

00:21:54.808 --> 00:21:56.289
he calls them.
 

00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:58.079
What are these myths?
 

00:21:58.079 --> 00:22:00.298
Well, we're not really sure.
 

00:22:00.298 --> 00:22:04.104
Are these sort of Gnostic-type
myths about many different gods

00:22:04.104 --> 00:22:07.596
doing things and having to
placate those gods in order to

00:22:07.596 --> 00:22:11.401
reach the highest God as we've
seen in some Gnostic texts that

00:22:11.401 --> 00:22:14.269
we talked about earlier in the
semester?

00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:16.382
We don't know,
but there's some kind of

00:22:16.382 --> 00:22:19.439
stories about either angels or
gods that some people are

00:22:19.439 --> 00:22:22.328
teaching, and this author is
writing against it.

00:22:22.328 --> 00:22:26.900
Some aspect--something's Jewish
about this he doesn't like.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:35.036
Look at I Timothy 4:1:
Now the spirit expressly says

00:22:35.036 --> 00:22:37.574
that in later times [in the
latter days]

00:22:37.574 --> 00:22:41.477
some will renounce the faith by
paying attention to deceitful

00:22:41.477 --> 00:22:44.210
spirits and the teachings of
demons,

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.720
through the hypocrisy of liars
whose consciences are seared

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.808
with a hot iron.
 

00:22:48.808 --> 00:22:52.074
They forbid marriage and demand
abstinence from foods which God

00:22:52.074 --> 00:22:54.810
created to be received with
thanksgiving by those who

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.759
believe and know the
truth."

00:22:56.759 --> 00:23:01.140
This author is against people
who are challenging marriage.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.679
He's against people who are
promoting some kind of ascetic

00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:08.218
behavior with regard to food,
so avoiding certain kinds of

00:23:08.218 --> 00:23:10.328
foods: is this kashrut?
 

00:23:10.328 --> 00:23:13.574
Maybe he's talking about people
who are teaching people not to

00:23:13.574 --> 00:23:15.328
eat pork, not to eat shellfish.
 

00:23:15.328 --> 00:23:17.430
Are they teaching Jewish food
laws?

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.430
He's not explicit.
 

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.922
He's against people who are
teaching that,

00:23:21.922 --> 00:23:25.509
he's against people who are
forbidding marriage and teaching

00:23:25.509 --> 00:23:27.759
any kind of dietary
restrictions.

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:32.848
Look at I Timothy 5:23.
 

00:23:32.848 --> 00:23:35.548
This is when he tells Timothy,
"No longer drink only

00:23:35.548 --> 00:23:38.439
water but take a little wine for
the sake of your stomach and

00:23:38.439 --> 00:23:40.029
your frequent ailments."
 

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:42.856
Why does he have to tell
somebody to drink some wine and

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.038
not just drink water?
 

00:23:44.038 --> 00:23:47.022
Well, because there were
ascetics who taught to avoid

00:23:47.022 --> 00:23:48.630
wine in the ancient world.
 

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.698
That was one of those things
that very strict ascetics might

00:23:51.698 --> 00:23:53.828
decide to avoid was wine and
rich food.

00:23:53.828 --> 00:23:58.058
This author says to Timothy,
nope, you should drink wine.

00:23:58.058 --> 00:24:00.380
This was our favorite verse
when I grew up in a church that

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.778
didn't allow drinking,
of course.

00:24:01.778 --> 00:24:06.940
I always like to throw this one
back at the elders of the

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.769
church.
 

00:24:07.769 --> 00:24:12.054
Look at I Timothy 6:20,
"Timothy,

00:24:12.054 --> 00:24:16.568
guard what has been entrusted
to you.

00:24:16.568 --> 00:24:19.785
Avoid the profane chatter and
contradictions of what is

00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:21.750
falsely called knowledge."
 

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.829
What is the Greek word for
knowledge?

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:26.490
Pardon?
 

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.338
Student:  Gnosis.
 

00:24:27.338 --> 00:24:30.710
Prof: Gnosis,
exactly.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.210
See, you're getting more than
you paid for in this course.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.038
You didn't know you were going
to learn Greek,

00:24:37.038 --> 00:24:40.494
and you're getting some good
cocktail party information,

00:24:40.494 --> 00:24:42.568
and even some Greek language.
 

00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:45.401
Gnosis is the word for
knowledge here,

00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:48.748
and this guy is attacking
people who are going around

00:24:48.748 --> 00:24:51.578
boasting about falsely called
knowledge.

00:24:51.578 --> 00:24:55.224
Again, that's led some scholars
to say is he talking about some

00:24:55.224 --> 00:24:56.460
kind of Gnosticism?
 

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.430
Is that what he's opposing?
 

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.251
That would go along with this
idea that they're using this

00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:03.480
word gnosis in ways he
doesn't like.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.548
They're teaching myths,
they're teaching asceticism,

00:25:06.548 --> 00:25:08.519
they're teaching the avoidance
of marriage,

00:25:08.519 --> 00:25:11.640
well that does look a bit like
other early Christian,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.367
second century Christian
groups, some of whom their

00:25:14.367 --> 00:25:17.426
opponents would call Gnostics,
but we don't have enough

00:25:17.426 --> 00:25:19.470
information for it to be easy to
tell.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:28.028
Now look at one more text,
this is II Timothy 2:18,

00:25:28.028 --> 00:25:38.298
he's actually giving some names
of people he doesn't like.

00:25:38.298 --> 00:25:40.858
In 2:18 it says,
"These people have swerved

00:25:40.858 --> 00:25:44.071
from the truth by claiming that
the resurrection has already

00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:45.269
taken place."
 

00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:47.210
He's condemning that.
 

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.332
Remember how I even talked
about with Colossians and

00:25:50.332 --> 00:25:53.538
Ephesians last time,
you had this idea that they

00:25:53.538 --> 00:25:56.940
almost sound like the
resurrection has already taken

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.538
place.
 

00:25:57.538 --> 00:26:00.118
In your baptism with Christ you
have been raised with Christ,

00:26:00.118 --> 00:26:02.897
and maybe there are other
people wandering around the

00:26:02.897 --> 00:26:05.178
second century,
Christians, saying that you've

00:26:05.178 --> 00:26:06.759
already been raised from the
dead,

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:07.930
you've already experienced the
resurrection.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.670
This author really condemns
that.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.632
He wants to say,
no, the resurrection hasn't

00:26:11.632 --> 00:26:14.138
taken place yet,
so he's condemning false

00:26:14.138 --> 00:26:17.487
teachers for all kinds of
different activities and

00:26:17.487 --> 00:26:19.808
teachings that he doesn't like.
 

00:26:19.808 --> 00:26:22.834
So we're seeing a definite
split here between different

00:26:22.834 --> 00:26:24.009
kinds of Paulinism.
 

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:27.872
There's a Paulinism represented
by these texts which is

00:26:27.872 --> 00:26:31.019
pro-family, pro-marriage,
pro-procreation.

00:26:31.019 --> 00:26:33.715
We'll talk about later that
he's for having children and

00:26:33.715 --> 00:26:36.354
mentions this explicitly;
anti-asceticism,

00:26:36.354 --> 00:26:40.957
against forcing people to
control what they eat and these

00:26:40.957 --> 00:26:45.806
sorts of things and this idea
about maybe Jewish myths being

00:26:45.806 --> 00:26:50.078
something and the teaching of
the resurrection.

00:26:50.078 --> 00:26:54.443
I Timothy 1:9,
then, gets us into another

00:26:54.443 --> 00:27:01.210
issue: what is the law and what
is this author's take on it?

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:05.635
I Timothy 1:9,8:
"Now we know that the law

00:27:05.635 --> 00:27:09.868
is good if one uses it
legitimately."

00:27:09.868 --> 00:27:12.111
That of course can be a
quotation right out of Romans

00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:14.440
because Romans itself has Paul
says the law is good.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.920
This means understanding that
the law is laid down not for the

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.660
innocent but for the lawless and
disobedient,

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.519
for the godless and sinful,
for the unholy and profane,

00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:25.200
for those who kill their father
or mother,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.442
or murderers,
fornicators,

00:27:26.442 --> 00:27:27.698
sodomite,
slave traders,

00:27:27.698 --> 00:27:29.815
liars, perjurers,
whatever else is contrary to

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:32.118
sound teaching that contradicts
the gracious,

00:27:32.118 --> 00:27:34.049
the glorious gospel of the
blessed God,

00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:35.519
which he entrusted to me.
 

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:38.993
Notice this guy doesn't have
really a problem with the law

00:27:38.993 --> 00:27:41.858
that we've seen sometimes in
Paul's writings.

00:27:41.858 --> 00:27:46.239
The law is basically just a set
of rules designed to keep people

00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:48.950
who can't control themselves in
line.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.118
In fact, he goes on to say that
if you're a good person you

00:27:52.118 --> 00:27:54.358
don't even need to worry about
the law.

00:27:54.358 --> 00:27:58.038
Now this is again different
from what Paul's view is.

00:27:58.038 --> 00:28:01.768
Paul did not want his Gentile
followers to keep the Jewish

00:28:01.768 --> 00:28:05.170
law, and Paul said in Romans
that the law is good.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:10.104
For Paul the law is still this
cosmic entity almost that

00:28:10.104 --> 00:28:11.720
invaded history.
 

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.570
This is very much Galatians,
remember when I gave the

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.862
lecture on Galatians and Romans
I talked about how the Jewish

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:20.440
law for Paul is not simply a
list of rules.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.490
It was this thing that came
into the cosmos as an invader,

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.809
it enslaved humanity,
it was the pedagogue that

00:28:27.809 --> 00:28:31.708
swatted humanity down when
humanity was in its childish

00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:32.430
state.
 

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.788
Obeying the law for Paul is
equal to trying to worship the

00:28:36.788 --> 00:28:41.375
stoichea of the cosmos,
these elemental spirits of the

00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:42.368
universe.
 

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:45.920
So the law for Paul isn't
simply a list of rules.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.150
The law for Paul is a very
ambiguous cosmic entity.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.298
It's just mythological in a
sense for Paul.

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:56.019
For this author that's not what
the law is.

00:28:56.019 --> 00:28:58.430
The law--you don't need to obey
it,

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.076
he says, and he's against
teaching his Gentile converts to

00:29:02.076 --> 00:29:04.481
keep the Jewish law,
but he just says,

00:29:04.481 --> 00:29:05.578
it's not important.
 

00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:07.980
It's only for people who are
sinners who can't control

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.568
themselves.
 

00:29:08.568 --> 00:29:11.160
As long as you're not a sinner,
as long as you don't do this

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.794
list of things that I can give
you, you don't need to concern

00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:14.980
yourself about the law.
 

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.681
So this is another one of the
reasons that people like me say,

00:29:18.681 --> 00:29:20.318
this is not Paul writing.
 

00:29:20.318 --> 00:29:23.788
People who believe Paul wrote
these letters would say,

00:29:23.788 --> 00:29:26.208
well they're written years
later, it's to a different

00:29:26.208 --> 00:29:28.180
context,
and Paul changed his mind,

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.382
or Paul's nuancing his message
differently for a different

00:29:31.382 --> 00:29:32.000
context.
 

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.221
So there are scholars who would
defend these letters being by

00:29:34.221 --> 00:29:35.630
Paul and that's what they would
say.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.078
I look at it and I say that's
so not like Paul.

00:29:39.078 --> 00:29:42.933
It's a totally different view
of the law and its role in the

00:29:42.933 --> 00:29:45.940
cosmos than you see in Romans or
Galatians,

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.728
which is another piece of
evidence for me that Paul is not

00:29:49.728 --> 00:29:51.588
the author of this letter.
 

00:29:51.588 --> 00:29:55.288
The strategy,
then, of this author,

00:29:55.288 --> 00:29:58.488
he's trying to argue against
all kinds of myths and practices

00:29:58.488 --> 00:30:01.740
that somebody's going through
Paul's churches and teaching.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.605
So he writes a letter in Paul's
name, seemingly addressed to

00:30:05.605 --> 00:30:09.209
Paul's follower Timothy,
and he lays out what he doesn't

00:30:09.209 --> 00:30:10.519
like about that.
 

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:12.150
But that's not all of his
strategy.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.626
What is his strategy for
combating these things that he

00:30:15.626 --> 00:30:17.430
considers false teachings?
 

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:21.509
First, he makes the church
itself a household.

00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:24.215
Now this is where all that
lecturing in the first part of

00:30:24.215 --> 00:30:26.355
the semester,
when I talked over and over

00:30:26.355 --> 00:30:28.528
again, what is the patriarchal
household,

00:30:28.528 --> 00:30:29.723
what is the Roman household,
what is the

00:30:29.723 --> 00:30:31.573
paterfamilias,
what is the structure of the

00:30:31.573 --> 00:30:33.261
household,
what is the patron client

00:30:33.261 --> 00:30:35.525
relationship,
what is the role of wives and

00:30:35.525 --> 00:30:38.000
women in the household,
and children, and slaves?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.007
All of that was because when
you get to some of these aspects

00:30:41.007 --> 00:30:44.229
of early Christianity,
this author is using the Roman

00:30:44.229 --> 00:30:47.250
household as the model for the
church itself.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.048
That wasn't the way Paul did
it, right?

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:53.489
Paul never talked about the
church as if it just had the

00:30:53.489 --> 00:30:55.490
same structure of a household.
 

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:59.067
He didn't talk about men always
being on top of the leadership

00:30:59.067 --> 00:31:01.590
organization,
and he didn't promote marriage

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.289
very much, which is what this
author does.

00:31:04.289 --> 00:31:12.173
I Timothy 3:14:
I hope to come to you soon,

00:31:12.173 --> 00:31:16.563
but I am writing these
instructions to you so that if I

00:31:16.563 --> 00:31:21.682
am delayed you may know how one
ought to behave in the household

00:31:21.682 --> 00:31:23.700
of God,
which is the church of the

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.573
living God,
the pillar and bulwark of the

00:31:25.573 --> 00:31:25.910
truth.
 

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.269
The church is the household of
God.

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:32.467
The same thing happens in I
Timothy 5, the beginning of I

00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:34.833
Timothy 5:
Do not speak harshly to an

00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:36.801
older man;
speak to him as a father,

00:31:36.801 --> 00:31:39.520
to younger men as brothers,
to older women as mothers,

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.240
to younger women as sisters,
with absolute purity.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.150
Notice everybody in the church
has some familial role.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.487
Older guys are fathers,
your younger men in the church

00:31:48.487 --> 00:31:51.173
are your brothers,
younger women sisters,

00:31:51.173 --> 00:31:54.266
older women mothers,
everybody has a household role

00:31:54.266 --> 00:31:55.130
in the church.
 

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.220
This is different--we might
think this is automatic but,

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.523
notice, this is not treating
the church as an

00:32:00.523 --> 00:32:02.608
ecclesia,
that Greek word that we

00:32:02.608 --> 00:32:04.028
translate "church."
 

00:32:04.028 --> 00:32:06.430
Where did the term
ecclesia come from?

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.500
Do you remember?
 

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.585
In Greek, what does the term
ecclesia originally refer

00:32:10.585 --> 00:32:11.819
to in classical Greek?
 

00:32:11.819 --> 00:32:12.960
Student:  Assembly.
 

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.720
Prof: The assembly of
the city.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.611
It's the assembly of the
city-state that came together

00:32:17.611 --> 00:32:19.630
for political purposes and to
vote.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.367
It comes out of the Greek
democracy, with its notions of

00:32:23.367 --> 00:32:27.241
some kind of equality among
citizens and all the--at least

00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:29.690
the men citizens getting a vote.
 

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.301
It's important that early
Christians, for some reason,

00:32:33.301 --> 00:32:36.982
chose this word ecclesia
to describe their house

00:32:36.982 --> 00:32:37.869
churches.
 

00:32:37.869 --> 00:32:39.690
It was ridiculous.
 

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.457
An outsider would have--might
have thought this is kind of

00:32:41.457 --> 00:32:43.259
ridiculous;
you're using the term that

00:32:43.259 --> 00:32:46.490
people would have heard as the
town assembly for a few people

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.430
who can fit into one dining
room?

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:53.886
It's kind of acceding more
importance to yourself than you

00:32:53.886 --> 00:32:55.420
really should.
 

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.289
I think it's important that
early Christian groups use that

00:32:58.289 --> 00:32:59.380
term for themselves.
 

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.983
Why didn't early Christian
groups call themselves

00:33:00.983 --> 00:33:01.818
"synagogues"?
 

00:33:01.818 --> 00:33:04.900
That was a term already in use
by Jews;

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.848
it would have been a normal
term to use.

00:33:06.848 --> 00:33:09.201
We don't find many early
Christians using the term

00:33:09.201 --> 00:33:11.170
"synagogue"
for their groups.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.550
We do find them using
ecclesia very quickly,

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.598
but an ecclesia isn't a
household.

00:33:15.598 --> 00:33:19.430
What this author is doing is
shifting,

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.809
in a not so subtle way,
understanding these house

00:33:22.809 --> 00:33:25.980
groups as being more like town
assemblies,

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:31.298
and making them look more like
Roman household.

00:33:31.298 --> 00:33:35.259
Also, then, men have certain
roles.

00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:39.144
I Timothy 2:8:
"I desire than that in

00:33:39.144 --> 00:33:43.957
every place the men should pray,
lifting up holy hands without

00:33:43.957 --> 00:33:46.986
anger or argument,
also that the women should pray

00:33:46.986 --> 00:33:49.950
lifting up holy hands without
argument."

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.269
No, Dale's lying to you again.
 

00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:55.500
The women should dress
themselves modestly,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.170
decently, and in suitable
clothing,

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.890
not with their hair braided
[girls,

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:02.615
are you listening?]
or with gold,

00:34:02.615 --> 00:34:04.773
pearls,
or expensive clothes,

00:34:04.773 --> 00:34:07.285
but with good works as is
proper for women who profess

00:34:07.285 --> 00:34:08.280
reverence for God.
 

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.170
Let a woman learn in silence
with full submission.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.739
I permit no woman to teach or
have authority over a man.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.289
She is to keep silent.
 

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:19.992
For Adam was formed first,
then Eve, and Adam was not

00:34:19.992 --> 00:34:22.485
deceived but the woman was
deceived, and became a

00:34:22.485 --> 00:34:23.369
transgressor.
 

00:34:23.369 --> 00:34:25.693
Yet she will be saved through
childbearing,

00:34:25.693 --> 00:34:28.846
provided they continue in faith
and love and holiness with

00:34:28.846 --> 00:34:29.510
modesty.
 

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:33.317
Now this is something that my
mom used to hate it when they

00:34:33.317 --> 00:34:35.679
would preach about this in
church.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:39.996
Also, it's controversial;
does it mean that she's saved

00:34:39.996 --> 00:34:42.989
from the dangers of
childbirth?

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:43.949
That's one way of reading it.
 

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:46.675
She'll be saved from the
dangers of childbirth if she

00:34:46.675 --> 00:34:48.250
lives a pious and holy life.
 

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.940
Or, a bit more of a radical way
of reading,

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.056
it would be to say,
by having babies women help

00:34:54.056 --> 00:34:58.382
constitute their own salvation--
that having children is one of

00:34:58.382 --> 00:35:00.880
the ways that women save
themselves.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.500
Either way you look at it,
this author really wants women

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.460
to be in a subordinate role,
silent in church.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.179
They can't have any leadership
authority or teaching authority

00:35:12.179 --> 00:35:12.760
over a man.
 

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.119
As we'll see,
they do have some offices.

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:18.353
There are roles that women can
play in the Pastoral Epistles,

00:35:18.353 --> 00:35:20.079
but not in authority over men.
 

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:23.239
Then there's this odd thing
about childbearing.

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:28.409
And I think what it means is
that childbearing actually can

00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:32.510
help save women from their sins
in some way.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.945
Women have to be modestly
dressed, no jewelry,

00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:38.159
saved through childbearing.
 

00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:41.945
In order to maintain this kind
of household structure,

00:35:41.945 --> 00:35:46.161
a very hierarchical household
structure, this author sets up

00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:48.018
offices in the church.
 

00:35:48.018 --> 00:35:50.295
And here's another reason to
call these "the Pastoral

00:35:50.295 --> 00:35:51.811
Epistles,"
because he's setting up

00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:52.650
pastoral offices.
 

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.460
Look in I Timothy 3:1-7,
"The saying is sure

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.800
whoever is aspires to the office
of bishop desires a noble

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.679
task."
 

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:02.644
Now a bishop--does anybody have
a different translation for what

00:36:02.644 --> 00:36:04.340
I just read as
"bishop"?

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.170
Student: 
"Overseer."

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.413
Prof:
"Overseer,"

00:36:06.413 --> 00:36:08.110
yes, "overseer"
is a translation.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.170
Anybody have a different
translation?

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.650
The word "bishop"
here is--

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.268
the Greek word is
episkopos,

00:36:16.268 --> 00:36:18.869
where we get the English word
"bishop"

00:36:18.869 --> 00:36:22.130
and you get the name for the
Episcopal church because it's a

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:23.679
church that has bishops.
 

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:27.373
In Greek it basically means
"an overseer"

00:36:27.373 --> 00:36:29.960
or "someone in
charge."

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.730
The bishop must be above
reproach,

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:33.070
married only once,
temperate, sensible,

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.869
respectable,
hospitable, an apt teacher,

00:36:34.869 --> 00:36:36.760
not a drunkard,
not violent but gentle,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.550
not quarrelsome,
not a lover of money.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.324
He must manage his own
household well,

00:36:40.324 --> 00:36:43.300
keeping his children submissive
and respectful in every way.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.590
For if someone does not know
how to manage his own household,

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.079
how can he take care of God's
church?

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:49.210
Again the church is a household.
 

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.860
If you're going to be the
bishop over the church you have

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.605
to be married,
because how can you manage the

00:36:55.605 --> 00:36:58.929
household of the church if you
can't prove it by managing your

00:36:58.929 --> 00:37:00.130
own household well?
 

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.981
"He must not be a recent
convert…"

00:37:02.981 --> 00:37:05.490
The bishop or the
episkopos is already

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.829
himself now a male head of
household.

00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:12.949
The other office he talks about
in 5:17,

00:37:12.949 --> 00:37:17.021
"Let the elders,"
now just as the word we

00:37:17.021 --> 00:37:21.340
translated "bishop"
or "overseer,"

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.250
comes from the Greek word
episkopos,

00:37:30.949 --> 00:37:33.599
the Greek for elder here is
presbyteros,

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:36.585
presbyter, and this is where
the Presbyterian church gets the

00:37:36.585 --> 00:37:37.630
name of its church.
 

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:40.592
They're Presbyterians because
the Presbyterian church rejected

00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:43.409
the use of bishops like they
found in Catholic and Anglican

00:37:43.409 --> 00:37:45.291
churches,
and chose a plurality of

00:37:45.291 --> 00:37:47.445
elders, so they're called
"elders"

00:37:47.445 --> 00:37:50.327
in the Presbyterian church,
and the Presbyterian church

00:37:50.327 --> 00:37:52.885
comes from this Greek word
meaning "elder,"

00:37:52.885 --> 00:37:55.050
presbyteros and this is
actually--

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:58.795
this came to be later in
English the name for a bishop

00:37:58.795 --> 00:38:03.317
who was not just the head of one
particular church but became the

00:38:03.317 --> 00:38:06.842
head of a series of churches,
a bunch of churches,

00:38:06.842 --> 00:38:10.157
that is the bishop now is not
the head of one church but the

00:38:10.157 --> 00:38:14.030
head of a whole diocese,
that is a geographical grouping.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.159
The word's changed a bit but
that's--

00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:19.925
bishop comes from this word and
presbyteros turned into

00:38:19.925 --> 00:38:22.516
the word priest,
so one of the suggested

00:38:22.516 --> 00:38:25.967
etymology's for where the
English word "priest"

00:38:25.967 --> 00:38:28.739
came from is from this Greek
word itself,

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:35.081
and you can kind of say
presbyteros,

00:38:35.081 --> 00:38:36.440
priest.
 

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.726
It just kind of happens in
English over a few hundred

00:38:41.726 --> 00:38:42.539
years.
 

00:38:42.539 --> 00:38:46.795
Elders also have to have wives,
be family men,

00:38:46.795 --> 00:38:49.539
and all this sort of thing.
 

00:38:49.539 --> 00:38:51.902
There are other offices to look
at--real quickly we're going to

00:38:51.902 --> 00:38:52.590
go through this.
 

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.869
Deacons: 3:8:
Deacons likewise must be

00:38:56.869 --> 00:38:59.529
serious, not double-tongued,
not indulging in much wine,

00:38:59.529 --> 00:39:00.690
not greedy for money.
 

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.773
They must hold fast to the
mystery of the faith with a

00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:03.518
clear conscience.
 

00:39:03.518 --> 00:39:05.601
Let them first be tested,
then, if they prove themselves

00:39:05.601 --> 00:39:07.079
blameless, let them serve as
deacons.

00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:09.170
Women likewise must be serious.
 

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.500
Now there's an exegetical
problem, does this

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.722
"women"
refer to women who would

00:39:13.722 --> 00:39:15.889
themselves independently be
deacons?

00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:18.132
In other words,
is he allowing women to be

00:39:18.132 --> 00:39:20.867
deacons on their own,
or is it supposed to be taken

00:39:20.867 --> 00:39:23.329
to be just the wives of the male
deacons?

00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:25.449
That they're called deacons
also, or deaconesses;

00:39:25.449 --> 00:39:28.324
the word for "deacon"
here comes from the Greek

00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:29.300
diakonos,
 

00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:40.969
it comes into English directly,
and that word just means

00:39:40.969 --> 00:39:43.974
"a servant,"
"someone who serves or

00:39:43.974 --> 00:39:45.199
ministers."
 

00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:48.788
The women in 3:11--some
exegetes would say this shows

00:39:48.788 --> 00:39:52.929
that this author does allow at
least women to be deacons,

00:39:52.929 --> 00:39:55.172
deaconesses,
and they have certain kinds of

00:39:55.172 --> 00:39:55.599
roles.
 

00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:59.599
Verse 12: "Let deacons be
married only once,

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:01.969
let them manage their children
and their households well,

00:40:01.969 --> 00:40:04.313
for those who serve well as
deacons gain a good standing for

00:40:04.313 --> 00:40:05.070
themselves."
 

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:09.250
Notice, in the beginning,
all of these roles,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.530
whether it's the elder,
presbyter, or the bishop--

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.623
and there's some debate about
whether "presbyter"

00:40:15.623 --> 00:40:18.610
refers to the same role as a
bishop in these letters--

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.541
they seem to be combined in
some of the later pastoral

00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:23.407
letters,
or whether they refer to two

00:40:23.407 --> 00:40:25.929
separate offices,
so there's a bit of a debate.

00:40:25.929 --> 00:40:29.027
All of these people,
whether you're from bishops,

00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:32.061
presbyters, deacons,
they all are required to be

00:40:32.061 --> 00:40:35.289
married and all are required to
have children.

00:40:35.289 --> 00:40:38.237
In the beginning of early
Christianity,

00:40:38.237 --> 00:40:41.730
see, you did not have the
celibate ministr.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:43.880
The celibate ministry comes
about later.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.306
This is in line with this
author's intention to set up the

00:40:48.306 --> 00:40:51.956
church as a household structure
with men on top,

00:40:51.956 --> 00:40:54.518
women having their own roles.
 

00:40:54.518 --> 00:41:02.432
Now there are other roles here
too, look at I Timothy 5:3-10,

00:41:02.432 --> 00:41:09.159
"Honor widows,"
this is I Timothy 5:3:

00:41:09.159 --> 00:41:11.840
Honor widows who are really
widows.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.519
If a widow has children or
grandchildren they should first

00:41:14.519 --> 00:41:17.295
learn their religious duty to
their own family and make some

00:41:17.295 --> 00:41:20.168
repayment to their parents,
for this is pleasing in God's

00:41:20.168 --> 00:41:20.500
sight.
 

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.012
The real widow,
left alone, has set her hope on

00:41:23.012 --> 00:41:25.525
God and continues in
supplications and prayers,

00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:26.510
night and day.
 

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.576
But the widow who lives for
pleasure is dead even while she

00:41:29.576 --> 00:41:30.000
lives.
 

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.280
Give these commands as well so
that they may be above reproach.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.759
Whoever does not provide for
relatives, and especially for

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.586
family members,
has denied the faith and is

00:41:37.586 --> 00:41:39.110
worse than an unbeliever."
 

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.233
[Now it gets really
interesting.]

00:41:41.233 --> 00:41:44.949
Let a widow be put on the list,
let her be registered.

00:41:44.949 --> 00:41:50.119
It seems like he's actually
creating another kind of office

00:41:50.119 --> 00:41:54.309
in the church,
that is, the office of widows.

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:56.333
And, sure enough,
in Christianity later,

00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:58.826
"widow"
became almost like an office in

00:41:58.826 --> 00:42:00.018
early Christianity.
 

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:03.099
They could be registered,
and they received financial

00:42:03.099 --> 00:42:04.579
help from the churches.
 

00:42:04.579 --> 00:42:08.269
"Let a widow be put on the
list if she is not less than

00:42:08.269 --> 00:42:11.710
sixty years old and has been
married only once."

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:14.768
Notice over and over here,
we've seen this thing about

00:42:14.768 --> 00:42:15.980
being married once.
 

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.983
Apparently this author believes
in marriage and wants people to

00:42:18.983 --> 00:42:21.744
be married, but his ideal is
that people should be married

00:42:21.744 --> 00:42:22.179
once.
 

00:42:22.179 --> 00:42:25.610
You certainly should not be
divorced and remarried.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.943
Paul himself forbids people in
his church from being divorced

00:42:29.943 --> 00:42:33.340
and remarried,
as we saw in I Corinthians 11.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.780
But this author seems to say
that if you're married and your

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:40.047
spouse dies, he still kind of
prefers that these women be

00:42:40.047 --> 00:42:41.039
married once.
 

00:42:41.039 --> 00:42:44.327
He also said that the bishop or
the presbyteros should be

00:42:44.327 --> 00:42:47.652
men who are married only once,
so multiple marriages are

00:42:47.652 --> 00:42:51.117
really frowned on even though
marriage itself is highly

00:42:51.117 --> 00:42:51.760
valued.
 

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.507
This led to what is currently
the practice in many of the

00:42:55.507 --> 00:42:56.780
eastern churches.
 

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.500
Eastern Orthodox,
the Greek Orthodox,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.804
the Russian Orthodox,
they do not forbid their

00:43:00.804 --> 00:43:03.706
priests from being married,
but you have to be married

00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:05.179
before you become a priest.
 

00:43:05.179 --> 00:43:08.496
So you'll have a lot of young
men in Greece or Russia who are

00:43:08.496 --> 00:43:11.369
going to become priests,
and they want to quickly get

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:13.250
married right out of seminary.
 

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.378
So they're looking around for a
partner, because if they become

00:43:16.378 --> 00:43:19.610
ordained as a priest and they're
not married, they're expected to

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.570
stay unmarried.
 

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.726
If their wife dies after they
become a priest,

00:43:23.726 --> 00:43:27.655
they're expected to stay
celibate and single for the rest

00:43:27.655 --> 00:43:29.340
of their lives also.
 

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.610
This led to the tradition in
Eastern Christianity,

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.175
that you can be a married
priest, unlike the Roman

00:43:35.175 --> 00:43:37.563
Catholic Church,
but only if you get married

00:43:37.563 --> 00:43:39.010
before you become a priest.
 

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:43.389
And it kept this idea of being
married once only.

00:43:43.389 --> 00:43:48.184
I can't go into the rest of
this but notice how this whole

00:43:48.184 --> 00:43:51.969
hierarchy of man and woman in a
household,

00:43:51.969 --> 00:43:54.474
old and young,
is also extended to children

00:43:54.474 --> 00:43:55.250
and slaves.
 

00:43:55.250 --> 00:44:00.182
Already in Colossians and
Ephesians we had what we called

00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:04.940
the household codes:
masters treat your slaves well;

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.199
slaves be obedient to your
masters;

00:44:06.199 --> 00:44:10.280
husbands treat your wives well;
wives submit to your husbands;

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.139
children submit to your fathers;
fathers treat your

00:44:13.139 --> 00:44:14.949
children--these are called
household codes.

00:44:14.949 --> 00:44:17.731
Already in Colossians and
Ephesians they set up the

00:44:17.731 --> 00:44:20.179
household in a clear
hierarchical patriarchal

00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:20.960
situation.
 

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.849
That is intensified in the
Pastoral Epistles.

00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:26.817
You have much longer household
codes, and, whereas in

00:44:26.817 --> 00:44:29.784
Colossians and Ephesians
that--those writers at least

00:44:29.784 --> 00:44:31.840
said there was some reciprocity.
 

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.438
They would address the slaves,
you would have to obey the

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:36.896
master but they would also
address the master and say,

00:44:36.896 --> 00:44:38.150
treat your slaves well.
 

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:41.467
When you get to the Pastoral
Epistles they left out the

00:44:41.467 --> 00:44:43.545
reciprocity,
it's mainly directed to the

00:44:43.545 --> 00:44:45.045
slaves,
to the children,

00:44:45.045 --> 00:44:46.650
to the wives,
saying,

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.820
submit.
 

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.831
This is the strategy that this
writer uses to combat the forms

00:44:52.831 --> 00:44:56.119
of Christianity that he doesn't
like,

00:44:56.119 --> 00:45:00.851
to construct the church as a
rigid patriarchal household in

00:45:00.851 --> 00:45:03.380
which each person has a role.
 

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.956
Even young women,
he says they're not supposed to

00:45:05.956 --> 00:45:08.996
be enrolled as widows,
if you have young women who are

00:45:08.996 --> 00:45:10.418
widows,
and they start running around

00:45:10.418 --> 00:45:11.829
gossiping and getting in a lot
of trouble,

00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:14.170
he says get them married off
again.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.510
Old women, of course,
you couldn't marry off again,

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.378
they're not enough old men
around in the ancient world to

00:45:19.378 --> 00:45:22.548
marry them off,
so he creates this structure by

00:45:22.548 --> 00:45:24.407
which women,
older women,

00:45:24.407 --> 00:45:27.257
get pulled back into the
household by this role as

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:27.840
widows.
 

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.900
No matter what happens to a
woman, in this author's view,

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.885
they have to be put back into
their submissive place in the

00:45:34.885 --> 00:45:37.429
household structure,
even if that means creating a

00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:39.539
new role for them called
"widows."

00:45:39.539 --> 00:45:45.090
This strategy this author uses
to bring Paul into his own time.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:48.405
He's taking a Paul that we've
seen as a bit different from

00:45:48.405 --> 00:45:51.898
this and he's reinventing Paul
for a second century Christian

00:45:51.898 --> 00:45:55.389
environment and restructuring
the church as a household.

00:45:55.389 --> 00:45:59.072
We'll see an author on
Wednesday doing precisely the

00:45:59.072 --> 00:46:00.590
opposite with Paul.
 

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.050
See you next time.

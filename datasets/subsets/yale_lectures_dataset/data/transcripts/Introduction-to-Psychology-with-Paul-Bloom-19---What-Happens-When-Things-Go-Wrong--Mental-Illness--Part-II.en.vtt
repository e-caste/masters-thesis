00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.009
Professor Paul Bloom:
The final topic of the course

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.811
is clinical psychology,
also known as abnormal

00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:22.236
psychology or psychopathology,
and this, for many of us,

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:24.790
is what psychology is really
about.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.835
It's about mental illness.
It's about clinical

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:27.550
psychologists.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.097
And we started talking about
this when Dr.

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:38.820
Nolen-Hoeksema gave her guest
lecture last week and I want to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.285
continue through this today.
It is a topic of tremendous

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:47.249
scientific importance but also a
topic of great personal

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:52.025
importance for many of us.
Many of the people in this room

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:55.577
have been mentally ill,
strictly speaking,

00:00:55.577 --> 00:01:00.888
at some point in their lives.
Some of you are under some sort

00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:05.719
of therapy or treatment or
medical intervention right now.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.099
Some of you are on Prozac or
Zoloft or Ambien or Wellbutrin

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.498
or any of those other
medications to deal with

00:01:13.498 --> 00:01:16.670
psychological problems you are
facing.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.198
Others are also talking to
psychiatrists,

00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:22.757
psychologists,
social workers,

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:27.068
and other people.
Many of you who are not at this

00:01:27.068 --> 00:01:31.985
point mentally ill will become
mentally ill during your stay at

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:33.398
Yale.
[laughter]

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:38.147
And this is a difficult period
in many people's lives and it's

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:42.973
a period of people's lives where
mental illness emerges in many

00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:44.713
of us.
By one estimate,

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:47.638
one half of all college
graduates in the United States

00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:50.840
– and the number is very high
with college graduates,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.330
highly educated people – one
half of you will have some sort

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.730
of mental illness in your life
serious enough to require some

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.971
sort of treatment.
Those of you not directly

00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:10.675
affected with mental illness
yourselves will no doubt

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:14.299
experience your loved ones,
your family,

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.998
your friends getting some sort
of illness, be it Alzheimer's or

00:02:18.998 --> 00:02:23.849
schizophrenia or depression or
some sort of anxiety disorder.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.848
So the personal importance of
clinical psychology,

00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:30.335
the personal importance of
understanding what can go wrong

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:35.000
and how best to treat it,
simply can't be underestimated.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.220
Now, when we talk about mental
disorders, the scope of this is

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.221
very broad.
It includes the prototypical

00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:46.949
schizophrenic which you could
see on the streets of New Haven,

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.776
somebody walking and gesturing
and talking to themselves and

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:53.281
sometimes screaming.
It includes alcohol addiction

00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:57.000
and cocaine addiction and other
addictions.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.232
It includes somebody with Down
syndrome or autism,

00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:04.169
an old person losing his
memory,

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.568
a teenager falling into a deep
depression, somebody with a

00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:10.787
severe social phobia to the
extent that he or she can't

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:14.015
leave the house.
Then there are also very hard

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:18.016
cases where it's difficult to
say one way or another--that

00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:22.298
guy's photographing me as I'm
talking and it's freaking me out

00:03:22.298 --> 00:03:23.562
[laughs]
[laughter]

00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:29.070
in kind of a social phobia way.
There's difficult cases where

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.848
it's just hard to tell mental
illness from just bad behavior

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:39.591
in general.
So, consider a killer without a

00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:44.050
conscience or a mobster like
John Gotti.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.129
Is he mentally ill?
And this is a question which is

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.924
a deep one and we'll wrestle
with it a little bit actually

00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:55.285
towards the end of this lecture.
What about somebody who acts in

00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:59.764
a kind of unusual or zany way?
This is originally supposed to

00:03:59.764 --> 00:04:03.189
be a picture of the character
Kramer on "Seinfeld" but,

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.678
given his unusual antics in the
last few months,

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.856
it could be a picture of the
actor who plays him who got into

00:04:08.856 --> 00:04:11.573
all sorts of trouble.
What about someone who is just

00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:13.875
kind of wacky?
At what point does wackiness

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.170
move into the domain of mental
illness?

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.290
What about unusual lifestyles
such as extreme altruism?

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.220
Batman devotes most of his life
to helping others.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.365
He sleeps one hour a night and
this hour is fraught with

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:33.230
nightmares and then he fights
crime.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.813
What about somebody,
and this was a case reported in

00:04:35.813 --> 00:04:37.889
The New Yorker a few
months ago,

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.374
who has lots of money and a
loving family and has his kidney

00:04:43.374 --> 00:04:46.924
removed to help a stranger?
And he says,

00:04:46.924 --> 00:04:49.215
"I have two kidneys.
It's minor pain,

00:04:49.215 --> 00:04:51.940
a minor operation.
I could save someone's life."

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.350
And his wife says,
"You're mentally ill.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.180
That's just crazy to do that."
Where do we draw the line?

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.057
And so, there are these great
philosophical and moral

00:05:02.057 --> 00:05:05.266
questions over the boundaries
and how to think about mental

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:08.262
illness.
So, how should we think about

00:05:08.262 --> 00:05:11.084
mental illness?
Well, there are some answers we

00:05:11.084 --> 00:05:14.256
could quickly dispense with.
It used to be thought that

00:05:14.256 --> 00:05:18.129
severe mental illness was a
result of demonic possession.

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.709
If you read the Gospels,
Jesus Christ wandered around a

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:25.420
lot, met crazy people and
exorcised the demons from their

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.699
bodies.
It was a common way of thinking

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.594
about craziness.
We now believe that this is not

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:35.100
true.
What about--yeah, it's not true.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.220
What about social deviants?
Some people including the

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.371
psychiatrist Thomas Szasz claim
that when we label somebody as

00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:49.339
mentally ill this is not a
medical decision.

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:54.716
It's rather a social decision
designed to ostracize people who

00:05:54.716 --> 00:05:59.917
deviate from society's norms,
to ostracize them and rid them

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:03.329
of moral agency.
It's not that we disagree with

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:05.160
them.
It's not even that we see them

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.931
as evil.
Rather, we see them as sick and

00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:12.423
as such we don't even have to
accord to them the respect that

00:06:12.423 --> 00:06:17.432
we accord to criminals.
Now, this is not entirely an

00:06:17.432 --> 00:06:21.966
unreasonable view.
In many countries around the

00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:26.002
world, dissidents,
people who argue against the

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:31.179
state, are often determined to
be mentally ill and thrown in

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:35.007
asylums.
Blacks in the United States who

00:06:35.007 --> 00:06:39.689
tried to escape from slavery
were described as having a

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.370
mental illness.
Why would they want to do so

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.191
unless they were mentally ill?
Up until 1973,

00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:50.614
to be a homosexual,
to be gay, would count in the

00:06:50.614 --> 00:06:56.376
official records of how we
classify illness as being

00:06:56.376 --> 00:07:00.607
mentally ill.
And many people saw this,

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:04.739
and we see this now,
not so much as reflecting a

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:08.783
sort of unbiased medical
analysis but rather as

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:13.970
reflecting biases that people
have against gay people.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.970
And these are political and
social and moral biases.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.540
They are not objective medical
judgments.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.271
Even now I've been recording
every president that has been

00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:28.919
the president of the United
States in my memory including

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:33.401
Bush and particularly Clinton
has been described by his

00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:37.561
opponents not merely as awful,
evil, terrible,

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:40.839
"hate his policies," but as
mentally ill.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:43.876
Every president at some point
or another, some bright,

00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:47.199
intelligent person figures to
call him a psychopath and put

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:51.031
that in Time magazine.
Now, put aside whether--the

00:07:51.031 --> 00:07:55.416
extent to which these things are
accurate, point being that we

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:59.663
often use medical labels,
particularly labels like

00:07:59.663 --> 00:08:05.249
"psychopath," "schizophrenic,"
"delusional," to ostracize and

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:08.600
pick out people we disagree
with.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.899
At the same time though,
this is not entirely right.

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:17.249
People go too far when they say
there's no such thing as mental

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:19.822
illness.
Some people are mentally ill in

00:08:19.822 --> 00:08:23.558
a very real sense of "illness,"
in the same sense we would

00:08:23.558 --> 00:08:27.949
describe somebody as physically
ill if they were to have cancer.

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:32.290
This illness damages their
functioning.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.571
They cannot function well.
They do not tend to be more

00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:38.480
creative or more productive or
more vivacious.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.289
Rather, for – with very few
exceptions;

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.700
possibly some exceptions
revolving around mania as Dr.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.432
Nolen-Hoeksema discussed –
with very few exceptions being

00:08:48.432 --> 00:08:52.549
mentally ill is just very bad
for you in every possible way.

00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:57.945
Moreover, when people are
treated, when people get better,

00:08:57.945 --> 00:09:02.110
they become more competent,
happier, better able to

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.383
participate in the world,
and they do not choose to go

00:09:05.383 --> 00:09:09.571
back to their mental illness,
suggesting that it really is

00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:14.552
illness in the serious sense.
And so the modern treatment of

00:09:14.552 --> 00:09:19.777
psychological disorders treats
them as disorders like medical

00:09:19.777 --> 00:09:22.730
disorders.
Schizophrenia is as much a

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.139
disease as is cancer and should
be thought of in the same way.

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:31.959
There's a whole field of
abnormal psychology of

00:09:31.959 --> 00:09:36.637
tremendous scope.
We've already discussed many

00:09:36.637 --> 00:09:41.340
mental illnesses in the context
of other things.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.008
So, for instance,
we talked about amnesia in the

00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:46.110
context of memory and how it
works.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.340
We talked about autism in the
context of social reasoning.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.669
There are many more and I'm not
going to read through them.

00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:58.098
These are the major categories
just for people's interest from

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:02.164
The Diagnostic and Standard
Manual. You don't have

00:10:02.164 --> 00:10:05.649
to--you're not responsible for
all of these.

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:08.187
And this is an illustration,
which people might find

00:10:08.187 --> 00:10:10.823
interesting, of sex differences
in these--in the major

00:10:10.823 --> 00:10:12.847
disorders.
And the patterns,

00:10:12.847 --> 00:10:15.659
as you could see,
are kind of neat.

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:19.865
Women are more prone to have
anxiety disorders and mood

00:10:19.865 --> 00:10:22.858
disorders.
Men are much more likely to

00:10:22.858 --> 00:10:27.279
suffer from substance disorders,
particularly alcoholism.

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:30.732
Schizophrenia is sort of evenly
matched but antisocial

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:34.054
personality disorders,
sometimes known as sociopathy

00:10:34.054 --> 00:10:36.789
or psychopathy,
is predominantly male.

00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:39.730
And we'll turn to that a bit
later.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.500
Here are the major ones which I
want to review today.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.606
I'm not going to talk about
mood disorders at all because

00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:50.155
this was the topic of the superb
lecture we heard last week but I

00:10:50.155 --> 00:10:52.429
want to quickly review
schizophrenia,

00:10:52.429 --> 00:10:55.860
the class of disorders known as
anxiety disorders,

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.850
the class of disorders known as
dissociative disorders,

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.909
and the class of disorders
known as personality disorders.

00:11:03.909 --> 00:11:07.230
And these are the main
psychological problems.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.914
When a psychologist or
psychiatrist does his or her

00:11:10.914 --> 00:11:15.188
work, they're predominantly
focused on somebody who has one

00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:18.777
of these problems.
Some of them are rare but some

00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:22.384
of them such as anxiety
disorders and the mood disorders

00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:23.630
are very common.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:35.464
About 1% of the world's
population suffers from

00:11:35.464 --> 00:11:41.549
schizophrenia and this is the
most common reason for being in

00:11:41.549 --> 00:11:45.907
a mental hospital.
And the reason for that is

00:11:45.907 --> 00:11:49.998
because of its severity,
because of how terrible an

00:11:49.998 --> 00:11:52.606
illness it is.
Schizophrenics have been

00:11:52.606 --> 00:11:55.697
described as the lepers of the
twentieth century by people who

00:11:55.697 --> 00:11:58.534
pointed out that in the last
hundred years people who are

00:11:58.534 --> 00:12:01.930
schizophrenics are just--there's
no place for them in society.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.870
They're shunned.
They're rejected.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.169
We have no idea how to treat
them or how to help them.

00:12:07.169 --> 00:12:12.666
The roots of schizophrenia come
from the terms "split" and

00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:17.970
"mind" but the idea is there is
a split from reality.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.429
It's important to stress the
sort of etymological point

00:12:21.429 --> 00:12:24.632
because sometimes people confuse
schizophrenia with

00:12:24.632 --> 00:12:27.771
something--with split
personality and they somehow

00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:32.000
think schizophrenia refers to
having multiple personalities.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.357
This is incorrect.
A multiple personality disorder

00:12:35.357 --> 00:12:37.149
is an entirely different
disorder.

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:40.000
It's a sort of dissociative
disorder.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.317
Split personality--people with
schizophrenia do not have

00:12:44.317 --> 00:12:48.572
multiple personalities.
What they have is a problem

00:12:48.572 --> 00:12:53.464
with relating to reality.
It's roughly equally split

00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:58.834
between the genders but it
strikes men earlier and it

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:04.411
happens between--around these
ages and as you could see

00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:06.984
roughly--and,
as you could see,

00:13:06.984 --> 00:13:09.465
it is the sort of thing that
could make its first occurrence

00:13:09.465 --> 00:13:11.190
while you're in college or
university.

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:18.289
There are five symptoms –
main symptoms of schizophrenia.

00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:21.961
Four of them are the positive
symptoms, meaning things that

00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:24.429
you do, that you have that's
unusual.

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.666
One is a negative symptom,
something that you don't have,

00:13:27.666 --> 00:13:29.919
something that a schizophrenic
lacks.

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:34.019
So, just to walk through them,
a hallucination is an

00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:38.200
experience, a sensory
experience, that isn't real.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.830
So, the most typical
hallucinations are auditory.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.039
Schizophrenics hear voices.
They hear sounds,

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:48.480
particularly people telling
them to do things,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.296
that aren't real.
Sometimes there are

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:55.222
auditory--there are visual
hallucinations or hallucinations

00:13:55.222 --> 00:13:59.419
of smell and taste but a typical
hallucination is auditory.

00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:04.330
Sometimes the voices are seen
from coming from oneself and so

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.077
you could sometimes stop the
hallucinations by doing things

00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:13.659
like humming or counting or
holding your mouth open.

00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:17.934
And some schizophrenics will do
this in an attempt to block

00:14:17.934 --> 00:14:21.379
auditory hallucinations.
There are delusions.

00:14:21.379 --> 00:14:24.389
The difference between a
hallucination and a delusion is

00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:27.234
a hallucination is a sensory
experience that's wrong,

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:32.457
that just didn't really happen.
A delusion is a belief that

00:14:32.457 --> 00:14:35.958
isn't right.
It's a belief that you

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.501
shouldn't be having.
Now, again, the question of

00:14:39.501 --> 00:14:43.391
what counts as a delusion and
what counts as accuracy can be a

00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:46.108
controversial one.
Richard Dawkins titled his

00:14:46.108 --> 00:14:48.811
recent book The God
Delusion, describing this

00:14:48.811 --> 00:14:52.097
mass delusion that many people
have that they believe there's a

00:14:52.097 --> 00:14:55.383
supernatural being who created
the universe and who is watching

00:14:55.383 --> 00:14:57.327
them.
Some people find that

00:14:57.327 --> 00:15:01.189
offensive, to call it a delusion
and people will have different

00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:04.520
views.
The delusions schizophrenics

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.269
have tend to be pretty clearly
weird and wrong.

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:12.970
They often tend to believe they
are famous people.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.368
Many schizophrenics have a
religious bent and believe that

00:15:16.368 --> 00:15:19.866
they are Jesus Christ.
In 1959, there was a Michigan

00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:23.928
hospital that had three Jesus
Christs in it and they would

00:15:23.928 --> 00:15:28.283
meet and talk.
One theme of delusions is

00:15:28.283 --> 00:15:32.809
what's called "ideas of
reference."

00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:36.904
And ideas of reference are you
think that there's all sorts of

00:15:36.904 --> 00:15:39.789
things happening that revolve
around you.

00:15:39.789 --> 00:15:43.386
You hear people whispering and
you think they're talking about

00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:45.400
you.
You pick up the newspaper and

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.951
you believe that there's coded
messages in it that are directed

00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:52.260
towards you.
You might believe that there is

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.133
some sort of omnipotent,
powerful force conspiring

00:15:56.133 --> 00:16:00.322
against you or trying to
manipulate you like aliens or

00:16:00.322 --> 00:16:03.230
the FBI,
the CIA, the government.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.499
You might believe that they
have some sort of evil plan in

00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:10.500
mind for you.
There is disorganized speech.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.990
Some schizophrenics babble.
They talk and it's nonsense.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.432
If you listen to a
schizophrenic on the street,

00:16:17.432 --> 00:16:20.299
sometimes what they're saying
makes no sense at all,

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:22.901
not merely that they're
conveying ideas that are

00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:24.950
unreasonable but it's just
garbled,

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.730
it's just a mess.
And sometimes there is

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.549
disorganized behavior too,
odd motor movements.

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:35.279
And the most extreme cases of
this are motor movements

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:39.078
described as "catatonic" where
the person doesn't move,

00:16:39.078 --> 00:16:44.080
often freezes in a position.
Those are all positive symptoms.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.065
A major negative symptom in
schizophrenia is absence of

00:16:48.065 --> 00:16:51.830
normal thought or affect,
affect meaning emotion.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.710
So some schizophrenics might
just not talk.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.429
They might have very low
emotional responses.

00:16:57.429 --> 00:17:02.139
They might not care about
anything.

00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:05.019
The basic psychological
misfunction--oh,

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:05.610
sorry.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.819
There are different subtypes of
schizophrenia.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.962
There are five major subtypes
but I'm going to focus on the

00:17:17.962 --> 00:17:20.292
three major ones,
the three most interesting

00:17:20.292 --> 00:17:22.404
ones.
The first one is paranoid

00:17:22.404 --> 00:17:25.581
schizophrenia.
So, paranoid schizophrenics

00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:30.309
believe that others are spying
and plotting against them.

00:17:30.309 --> 00:17:32.759
And they often have delusions
of grandeur.

00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:36.109
They often believe that other
people are jealous of them.

00:17:36.109 --> 00:17:38.400
They might believe they have
supernatural powers.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.579
They might believe that they're
God or a messiah.

00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:46.819
The catatonic schizophrenics
are unresponsive to their

00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:51.619
surroundings and often they'll
just repeat what people say to

00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:53.492
them,
they won't generate their own

00:17:53.492 --> 00:17:54.725
speech.
And finally,

00:17:54.725 --> 00:17:59.532
the disorganized schizophrenics
are maybe what you most think of

00:17:59.532 --> 00:18:02.890
when you think of somebody who
is insane.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.572
They make no sense.
They have delusions and

00:18:06.572 --> 00:18:08.769
hallucinations.
They babble.

00:18:08.769 --> 00:18:11.569
They--their actions--they could
be dangerous.

00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:13.150
They could be perceived as
dangerous.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.430
They're unable to help
themselves.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.020
They're unable to do anything
in their lives.

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:25.363
It's hard to pin down exactly
what's at root of all of these

00:18:25.363 --> 00:18:29.014
problems but a very general
summary is that there is a

00:18:29.014 --> 00:18:32.940
problem – an inability to put
together your thoughts and

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.995
perceptions,
to sequence them and coordinate

00:18:36.995 --> 00:18:41.900
them, to impose a logical
structure and a reasonable,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:47.470
realistic temporal sequence on
your experience.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.170
This is the core thing going
wrong but what happens as a

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.265
result of this is you lose
contact with others,

00:18:54.265 --> 00:18:58.479
you lose social contact.
Losing social contact means you

00:18:58.479 --> 00:19:02.993
don't get much reality checking.
If I start acting weird and

00:19:02.993 --> 00:19:06.081
nobody cares,
I could just get weirder and

00:19:06.081 --> 00:19:08.329
weirder,
while if I'm in a good social

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:11.316
group of people who care about
me often the situation could be

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.982
brought under control.
So, schizophrenia is sort of a

00:19:13.982 --> 00:19:16.579
vicious circle where you have
this cognitive problem.

00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:19.621
Then you have problems losing
contact with others,

00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:22.599
exaggerating the cognitive
problem, and so on.

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:27.089
A lot of people have studied
the genetics of schizophrenia.

00:19:27.089 --> 00:19:30.589
It's clear enough that there is
a powerful genetic component.

00:19:30.589 --> 00:19:35.884
I could--you can tell how much
at risk somebody is for becoming

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:40.495
schizophrenic based on the
schizophrenia and illness of

00:19:40.495 --> 00:19:43.455
their family members.
In particular,

00:19:43.455 --> 00:19:46.346
if you have an identical twin
who's schizophrenic,

00:19:46.346 --> 00:19:50.180
your odds are about a half of
becoming schizophrenic yourself.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.265
At the same time,
and we dealt with this as well

00:19:53.265 --> 00:19:56.680
when we talked about issues of
sexual orientation,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.269
the fact that identical twins
the odds are only 50% means

00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:05.450
there has to be an environmental
component to it.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.309
If it was entirely genetic,
it would be 100%.

00:20:08.309 --> 00:20:12.417
And so one claim--one way of
looking at it is your genes make

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:16.525
you vulnerable to schizophrenia
but whether or not you become

00:20:16.525 --> 00:20:20.769
schizophrenic depends on what
happens in your environment.

00:20:20.769 --> 00:20:23.299
You're sensitive to certain
triggers.

00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:26.309
Some triggers might happen
early.

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:30.346
There is some evidence that
schizophrenia is associated with

00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:32.809
trauma even at the point of
birth.

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:37.333
And there's some other evidence
that schizophrenia is linked to

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:39.714
viral infections.
As an example,

00:20:39.714 --> 00:20:43.123
there are more schizophrenics
born in the winter,

00:20:43.123 --> 00:20:47.314
subtle--a subtle difference but
there seems to be a reliable

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:51.150
effect of more schizophrenics
born in the winter.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.380
More people get sick in the
winter.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.514
At times when there's been some
sort of epidemic or some sort of

00:20:57.514 --> 00:21:00.992
plague, this seems to cause a
jump in the frequency of

00:21:00.992 --> 00:21:03.420
schizophrenics born at that
time.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.878
There's some recent research
that ties schizophrenia to the

00:21:07.878 --> 00:21:12.413
possibility of toxoplasmosis,
which is a disorder carried by

00:21:12.413 --> 00:21:14.994
cat feces.
The experiment basically

00:21:14.994 --> 00:21:18.630
involved asking the parents of
schizophrenics one question:

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.640
"Did you own a cat when your
child was born?"

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.248
And if the answer was "yes," it
seemed to correspond to a bit

00:21:25.248 --> 00:21:28.015
higher odds for schizophrenic
families than for

00:21:28.015 --> 00:21:33.425
non-schizophrenic families.
A different sort of trigger is

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:39.049
stressful family environments.
Schizophrenics seem to really

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:41.953
have more stressful family
environments than

00:21:41.953 --> 00:21:46.238
non-schizophrenics.
Now, we have to be careful

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:49.202
about this.
We have to bring--we have to

00:21:49.202 --> 00:21:52.249
return to the sort of
methodological cautions we had

00:21:52.249 --> 00:21:55.714
in mind when we talked about
individual difference research

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:58.436
in general.
Remember we talked about the

00:21:58.436 --> 00:22:02.347
worst study in the world and one
of the features of this was it

00:22:02.347 --> 00:22:05.250
was failing to pull apart cause
and effect.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.006
It might be that having a
difficult family environment ups

00:22:09.006 --> 00:22:11.509
your odds of becoming
schizophrenic.

00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:13.718
On the other hand,
it might also be that

00:22:13.718 --> 00:22:16.493
schizophrenic children or
children who will become

00:22:16.493 --> 00:22:19.607
schizophrenic are difficult to
deal with in certain ways

00:22:19.607 --> 00:22:23.403
causing a family environment.
So, it's not clear whether the

00:22:23.403 --> 00:22:26.487
effect is from difficult family
environment to later

00:22:26.487 --> 00:22:29.328
schizophrenia or from
schizophrenia to difficult

00:22:29.328 --> 00:22:32.958
family environment.
There used to be a very popular

00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:36.754
theory of schizophrenia,
which is that it was caused by

00:22:36.754 --> 00:22:39.565
excess dopamine.
Dopamine, you'll remember,

00:22:39.565 --> 00:22:43.069
is a neurotransmitter.
And there is some reason to

00:22:43.069 --> 00:22:47.056
take this seriously.
Drugs that reduce dopamine

00:22:47.056 --> 00:22:50.559
provide some help in reducing
symptoms.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:56.840
And if I give you a drug that
shoots up your dopamine that

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:02.019
will turn you into a temporary
schizophrenic.

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:05.516
You get what's called
"amphetamine psychosis" and it'd

00:23:05.516 --> 00:23:09.210
give you--it can give you
schizophrenic-like symptoms,

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.079
hallucinations,
delusions, that sort of thing.

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:15.802
This--There might be something
to this theory but we know now

00:23:15.802 --> 00:23:18.779
it can't be complete for at
least two reasons.

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:22.380
First, it doesn't explain the
negative symptoms.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.674
It explains hallucinations and
delusions and so on but it

00:23:27.674 --> 00:23:32.308
doesn't explain the loss of
affect, the quietness,

00:23:32.308 --> 00:23:36.206
the stillness.
Also, there seemed to be some

00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:40.297
sort of structural brain
differences involving enlarged

00:23:40.297 --> 00:23:44.056
cerebral ventricles,
involving reduced frontal lobe

00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:48.089
activity, suggesting that the
problem with schizophrenia is a

00:23:48.089 --> 00:23:51.450
lot more complicated than others
might have it,

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.660
than the dopamine theory would
have it.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.785
I'll end with a mystery.
And this mystery is discussed

00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:03.160
nicely in the Gray textbook.
The symptoms of schizophrenia,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.084
the prevalence of
schizophrenics,

00:24:06.084 --> 00:24:11.474
is similar wherever you go but
less industrialized countries

00:24:11.474 --> 00:24:16.316
have a better rate of recovery
from schizophrenia than

00:24:16.316 --> 00:24:20.619
industrialized countries.
And nobody really knows why.

00:24:20.619 --> 00:24:22.640
I listed here three
possibilities.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.685
One is that the families that
were--that--in a less

00:24:25.685 --> 00:24:29.218
industrialized country there's
more latitude and so there's

00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:32.273
less critical- less criticism.
There's less use of

00:24:32.273 --> 00:24:35.416
antipsychotic medication.
Antipsychotic medications help

00:24:35.416 --> 00:24:38.710
with the symptoms but they might
also impair recovery.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.232
And finally,
if you think of schizophrenia

00:24:41.232 --> 00:24:44.740
as a transient disorder,
maybe that will in some sense,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.746
in some way,
make that more likely to

00:24:46.746 --> 00:24:47.750
actually happen.

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:55.475
The second sort of disorder I
want to talk about,

00:24:55.475 --> 00:24:58.849
much more common than the 1%
that's schizophrenia,

00:24:58.849 --> 00:25:02.060
is the classic disorders known
as "anxiety disorders."

00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:13.220
The primary disturbance in
anxiety disorders is anxiety;

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.881
you have a lot of anxiety.
It's persistent,

00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:25.440
either anxiety or maladaptive
behaviors to reduce anxiety.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.240
Now, everybody experiences
anxiety.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.689
If you didn't experience
anxiety, you'd be a very strange

00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:33.619
person and you probably wouldn't
function very well in the world,

00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:37.494
but you have an anxiety
disorder when you experience too

00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:41.694
much of it, it's uncontrollable,
it's unreasonable and it messes

00:25:41.694 --> 00:25:43.978
up your life.
And there's quite a few anxiety

00:25:43.978 --> 00:25:46.087
disorders.
The simplest one is this

00:25:46.087 --> 00:25:50.056
generalized anxiety disorders
where--and this is about one in

00:25:50.056 --> 00:25:53.827
twenty people will get it at
some point in their lives and

00:25:53.827 --> 00:25:56.799
you worry all the time.
You're just very anxious.

00:25:56.799 --> 00:26:00.140
You're just worried all the
time and it could be paralyzing.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.553
It could give you physical
symptoms like headaches,

00:26:03.553 --> 00:26:05.669
stomachaches,
muscle tension and

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:08.926
irritability.
There is some evidence that

00:26:08.926 --> 00:26:12.964
generalized anxiety disorder has
a genetic component,

00:26:12.964 --> 00:26:16.769
that it's somehow related to
major depression.

00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:21.944
And it does seem to have its
possible roots in some sort of

00:26:21.944 --> 00:26:25.968
childhood trauma.
And so the model some people

00:26:25.968 --> 00:26:30.542
give for this is when you are
young something really bad

00:26:30.542 --> 00:26:34.349
happens to you.
This makes you hyper-vigilant.

00:26:34.349 --> 00:26:37.842
You don't trust the world,
bad things could always happen

00:26:37.842 --> 00:26:40.552
around the corner.
And because you're

00:26:40.552 --> 00:26:45.019
hyper-vigilant you are more
prone to develop generalized

00:26:45.019 --> 00:26:49.000
anxiety disorder after a
difficult life event.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.455
A second sort of anxiety
disorder, which we already

00:26:52.455 --> 00:26:56.188
discussed in class are phobias
and phobias are intense,

00:26:56.188 --> 00:26:59.202
irrational fears.
They could focus on objects,

00:26:59.202 --> 00:27:02.243
events, and social settings.
Here's a nice diagram of

00:27:02.243 --> 00:27:04.258
different phobia,
different things,

00:27:04.258 --> 00:27:07.519
and their proportion of people
who are afraid of it.

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:11.109
And the point of this diagram
isn't with the details.

00:27:11.109 --> 00:27:14.228
It's really--It's rather to
give you a feeling for the fact

00:27:14.228 --> 00:27:17.561
that some things most everybody
is afraid of or a lot of people

00:27:17.561 --> 00:27:20.250
are afraid of and some things
not many at all.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.978
The big phobic object we know
from previous lectures is

00:27:23.978 --> 00:27:26.264
snakes.
About 40% of the population say

00:27:26.264 --> 00:27:29.342
they're afraid of snakes.
How many people here are afraid

00:27:29.342 --> 00:27:33.650
of snakes?
Okay.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:36.941
And then there's a really
terrifying thing,

00:27:36.941 --> 00:27:39.577
mice.
How many people are afraid of

00:27:39.577 --> 00:27:41.675
mice?
Mice are the worst things in

00:27:41.675 --> 00:27:43.123
the world.
[laughter]

00:27:43.123 --> 00:27:47.487
And then cats and if you're
afraid of cats that's really

00:27:47.487 --> 00:27:50.215
unusual.
Not many people are afraid of

00:27:50.215 --> 00:27:52.009
cats.
There is a classical

00:27:52.009 --> 00:27:56.308
conditioning model of phobias,
which we are all familiar with,

00:27:56.308 --> 00:28:00.044
but we are all familiar with
why it is not a very good

00:28:00.044 --> 00:28:02.739
theory.
A lot of people who are afraid

00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:06.130
of snakes have never had a bad
experience with snakes.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.758
Moreover, a lot of people who
have had bad experiences with

00:28:09.758 --> 00:28:13.323
things like car crashes and
being electrocuted on a socket

00:28:13.323 --> 00:28:16.541
or a shooting,
seeing a gun during a shooting,

00:28:16.541 --> 00:28:20.009
do not develop phobias.
This lead--gives rise to a much

00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:23.470
more plausible theory known as
the "preparedness theory,"

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.910
which says that we have evolved
to be sensitive to certain

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.627
phobic objects,
objects that were dangerous to

00:28:29.627 --> 00:28:33.720
us in our evolutionary history.
And we're prone to develop

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.024
phobic responses to this.
The final anxiety disorder is

00:28:38.024 --> 00:28:42.922
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Obsessions are irrational

00:28:42.922 --> 00:28:48.519
disturbing thoughts that intrude
into your consciousness.

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:53.567
This is--hits about two to
three percent of the population

00:28:53.567 --> 00:28:58.791
and it leads to compulsions,
repetitive actions performed to

00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:02.050
alleviate the obsessions.
For instance,

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.707
you might be obsessed with the
idea of being dirty,

00:29:04.707 --> 00:29:06.779
your hands are dirty,
you're filthy.

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:09.910
That might lead to compulsive
washing.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:15.341
You might believe that God is
angry at you and that might lead

00:29:15.341 --> 00:29:19.839
to compulsive prayer.
Cleanliness and religion are

00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:24.039
common themes of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:27.275
You often know,
rationally, that these are

00:29:27.275 --> 00:29:32.009
unreasonable behaviors but you
can't help yourself from doing

00:29:32.009 --> 00:29:34.671
them.
Sometimes I get the worry that

00:29:34.671 --> 00:29:38.509
I left my door unlocked and I
run back and checked it--check

00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:40.832
it.
But I feel it's a little bit of

00:29:40.832 --> 00:29:44.696
OCD coming on because I know I
locked it, but did I really lock

00:29:44.696 --> 00:29:46.579
it?
And then you get--now I'm

00:29:46.579 --> 00:29:51.599
worried if I locked my door.
Checking and washing.

00:29:51.599 --> 00:29:54.781
Checking is what I'm talking
about here- most common

00:29:54.781 --> 00:29:58.086
compulsions, and it seems to
have a neuropsychological

00:29:58.086 --> 00:30:00.387
phenomena.
At least it's related to

00:30:00.387 --> 00:30:03.420
heightened neural activity in
the caudate nucleus.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.584
What's interesting is you might
think obsessive-compulsive

00:30:07.584 --> 00:30:10.359
disorder is a very sort of
Freudian,

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:14.816
psychoanalytic sort of disorder
but actually it's treated quite

00:30:14.816 --> 00:30:18.010
well with drugs,
drugs that affect the serotonin

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.360
level.
Serotonin, being a

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.560
neurotransmitter,
can often do good work for

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.968
obsessive-compulsive disorders.
So, if you develop a disorder,

00:30:24.968 --> 00:30:27.414
an OCD problem,
you might find yourself being

00:30:27.414 --> 00:30:29.250
cured simply with medications.

00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:39.884
We've talked about
schizophrenia and anxiety

00:30:39.884 --> 00:30:43.000
disorders.
Any questions or thoughts so

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.240
far?
Yes.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.327
Student: What's the
difference between OCD and

00:30:46.327 --> 00:30:47.652
Tourette's or are they
[inaudible]

00:30:47.652 --> 00:30:49.819
Professor Paul Bloom:
It's a good question.

00:30:49.819 --> 00:30:52.243
The question was the
relationship between OCD and

00:30:52.243 --> 00:30:54.959
Tourette's.
Tourette's is--I don't know

00:30:54.959 --> 00:30:59.231
much about it but it's a very
specific neurophysiological

00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:04.190
syndrome that doesn't have--you
don't have obsessive thoughts.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:08.776
What it leads to is involuntary
tics and tremors and sometimes

00:31:08.776 --> 00:31:12.160
sort of shouted obscenities or
taboo words.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.611
And it seems to be very
specific to that while OCD is

00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:19.726
much broader and involves both
behaviors but also the behaviors

00:31:19.726 --> 00:31:23.095
are in the service of thoughts.
That's one way of thinking

00:31:23.095 --> 00:31:25.000
about the difference.
Yes.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.520
Student: Can individuals
have multiple disorders like be

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.265
bipolar and schizophrenic?
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:33.939
Yes.
The question is can individuals

00:31:33.939 --> 00:31:37.230
have multiple disorders?
Absolutely, and in fact some

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.775
disorders are "comorbid."
And that's just a fancy way of

00:31:40.775 --> 00:31:43.555
saying they often go together.
So, if you have a severe

00:31:43.555 --> 00:31:46.160
depression for instance,
which is a mood disorder,

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.339
you may also have an anxiety
disorder.

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:51.450
So yes, having one
unfortunately doesn't immunize

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.259
you against having another.
Yes.

00:31:54.259 --> 00:31:57.836
Student: Where does
superstition [inaudible]

00:31:57.836 --> 00:32:01.412
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question was about

00:32:01.412 --> 00:32:04.790
superstitions.
I think--it's an interesting

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.299
question which I have never
thought of before.

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:11.269
I think it depends on the
severity of superstitions.

00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:15.226
So, if you just have a
superstition saying "Step on a

00:32:15.226 --> 00:32:17.890
crack, break your mother's
back,"

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.943
which has never been
scientifically proven,

00:32:19.943 --> 00:32:21.801
[laughter]
but suppose you--and then so

00:32:21.801 --> 00:32:24.624
you're just kind of "Oh,
I kind of--I just kind of--" or

00:32:24.624 --> 00:32:26.829
it's bad luck to break a mirror
and that's it,

00:32:26.829 --> 00:32:29.289
you just have it and it doesn't
make a big deal to you,

00:32:29.289 --> 00:32:31.682
that's harmless.
On the other hand,

00:32:31.682 --> 00:32:37.009
if your superstition is such
that you develop weird rituals;

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:40.179
you might have to carefully
walk so you don't step on any

00:32:40.179 --> 00:32:43.405
other--on any cracks or you
might have to do--or if you do

00:32:43.405 --> 00:32:46.687
you might have to go back and
start your whole walk to work

00:32:46.687 --> 00:32:49.623
over again.
When it gets to that level it

00:32:49.623 --> 00:32:53.213
could creep into OCD.
And often obsessive-compulsive

00:32:53.213 --> 00:32:57.541
disorders have a religious or a
magical manifestation where you

00:32:57.541 --> 00:33:01.868
believe there are certain things
you must do or terrible things

00:33:01.868 --> 00:33:06.126
will happen and in that way you
could view them as extreme and

00:33:06.126 --> 00:33:11.103
build from superstitions,
but simple superstitions don't

00:33:11.103 --> 00:33:14.640
tend to be of that type.
Yes, in back.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.490
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:22.690
The question is "are people with
schizophrenia dangerous?"

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:27.059
As a rule statistically,
it tends not to be the case.

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:30.890
They tend to be more likely
victims than harmful.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.597
They tend to be fairly helpless.
You can have a case where a

00:33:34.597 --> 00:33:36.500
schizophrenic might harm
somebody.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.101
A paranoid schizophrenic,
for instance,

00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:43.003
might develop a delusion to
harm somebody and so there are

00:33:43.003 --> 00:33:46.289
definitely such cases but for
the most part,

00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:51.079
again, they are more victims
than oppressors.

00:33:51.079 --> 00:33:53.673
They're more--they're very
vulnerable because they aren't

00:33:53.673 --> 00:33:55.480
capable of dealing with other
people.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.050
They often aren't capable of
defending themselves.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.980
One more.
Yes.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.047
Student: How permanent
are the effects of the

00:34:05.047 --> 00:34:06.706
medications?
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:34:06.706 --> 00:34:08.076
The question is,
"How permanent is the effect of

00:34:08.076 --> 00:34:10.989
the medication?"
Do you mean for schizophrenia?

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:13.171
Student: Do they have to
stay on the medication for

00:34:13.171 --> 00:34:14.663
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:34:14.663 --> 00:34:16.370
Yes.
In general, I think.

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:21.374
I can't think of any exceptions.
The effects of medication are

00:34:21.374 --> 00:34:23.801
temporary.
Now, that doesn't mean if you

00:34:23.801 --> 00:34:26.894
have a bout of OCD or depression
you have to be on medication the

00:34:26.894 --> 00:34:29.189
rest of your life.
What could happen is,

00:34:29.189 --> 00:34:31.626
for instance,
somebody--if you had a mild

00:34:31.626 --> 00:34:35.099
depression, go on something like
Prozac or Wellbutrin,

00:34:35.099 --> 00:34:38.436
use that time to kind of get
your life back together,

00:34:38.436 --> 00:34:41.259
cheer up a bit,
and then when they go off the

00:34:41.259 --> 00:34:45.093
medication they are fine.
But as Professor Nolen-Hoeksema

00:34:45.093 --> 00:34:48.787
pointed out, unless they've
developed coping skills they're

00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:51.780
likely to relapse and get the
problem again.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.969
So, the physical effects of
medication are always temporary,

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:57.510
particularly with anybody with
schizophrenia,

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.583
but they can often help people
get out of a problem,

00:35:00.583 --> 00:35:03.650
anxiety or depression.
Okay.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.274
Dissociative disorders.
I'll show you a movie clip and

00:35:08.274 --> 00:35:13.400
then we'll go back and talk a
little bit about it.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:20.820
Let me ask you a question that
might seem somewhat uncaring.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.380
How many of you think he's
faking?

00:35:25.809 --> 00:35:30.477
How many of you [laughter]
are confident there are many

00:35:30.477 --> 00:35:35.750
people living inside his head
as--in the way it's depicted?

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.300
Okay.
How many of you are unsure?

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.238
How many of you have two minds?
There is one part of you

00:35:43.238 --> 00:35:47.676
struggling-- [laughter]
It's--let's go--we'll go back

00:35:47.676 --> 00:35:51.004
to him.
Dissociative disorder are

00:35:51.004 --> 00:35:54.369
disorders involving
dissociation.

00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:58.707
And what people mean by that is
literally a dissociation of

00:35:58.707 --> 00:36:02.237
memory;
that is, you become somehow

00:36:02.237 --> 00:36:08.587
unaware, separated from some
part of your identity or history

00:36:08.587 --> 00:36:14.831
and you're unable to recall
those parts of your identity and

00:36:14.831 --> 00:36:20.969
history except sometimes under
special circumstances.

00:36:20.969 --> 00:36:25.099
Now, some degree of
dissociation is normal.

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:28.967
There is--I will--I have here
in, actually,

00:36:28.967 --> 00:36:31.637
Dr.
Nolen-Hoeksema's excellent

00:36:31.637 --> 00:36:36.702
abnormal psychology textbook a
checklist of dissociative

00:36:36.702 --> 00:36:42.411
experiences many of which normal
people have: "Not sure whether

00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:47.660
one has done something or only
thought about it."

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.940
Anybody ever have that?
Common.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:57.380
"So involved in the fantasy
that it seems real."

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:02.489
[laughter]
"Feeling as though one's body

00:37:02.489 --> 00:37:07.056
is not one's own."
I will also add that

00:37:07.056 --> 00:37:13.090
experiments with pharmaceuticals
can often lead to dissociative

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.431
experiences.
[laughter]

00:37:15.431 --> 00:37:20.547
"Driving a car and realizing
that one doesn't remember part

00:37:20.547 --> 00:37:24.650
of the trip.
Talking out loud to oneself

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.539
when alone."
Okay.

00:37:27.539 --> 00:37:31.400
"Not recognizing one's
reflection in a mirror."

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.138
Okay.
That's not very common

00:37:36.138 --> 00:37:39.736
[laughter]
but it is--it's within the

00:37:39.736 --> 00:37:45.632
normal range but then you get
more severe cases and there is

00:37:45.632 --> 00:37:50.530
three different types:
dissociative amnesia,

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:54.065
dissociative fugue,
and dissociative identity

00:37:54.065 --> 00:37:57.252
disorder.
Dissociative amnesia is

00:37:57.252 --> 00:38:02.359
illustrated in a story of a
woman who sees something

00:38:02.359 --> 00:38:08.367
terrible and as a result her
memory of that experience was no

00:38:08.367 --> 00:38:12.886
longer accessible.
It's often known as

00:38:12.886 --> 00:38:17.856
"psychogenic amnesia."
The only thing wrong in here is

00:38:17.856 --> 00:38:22.077
you have memory loss.
And sometimes it's a selective

00:38:22.077 --> 00:38:26.059
memory loss but sometimes it
could be global.

00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:29.314
It's as in these movies cases
where you lose your memory

00:38:29.314 --> 00:38:32.806
because something terrible has
happened and you would get it

00:38:32.806 --> 00:38:36.179
back later but you have a
temporary loss of identity.

00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:39.383
The idea is that something so
terrible has happened you

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:42.527
separate yourself from your
previous identity and your

00:38:42.527 --> 00:38:45.859
memory.
Over half of people charged

00:38:45.859 --> 00:38:52.309
with homicide claim to have some
degree of dissociative amnesia.

00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:56.488
The problem here is that many,
many, many of those cases

00:38:56.488 --> 00:39:00.742
involve alcohol and drugs,
which can lead to some sort of

00:39:00.742 --> 00:39:04.909
alcoholic blackout.
Also, people could be lying.

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:08.001
If you're charged with murder,
it's often a reasonable thing

00:39:08.001 --> 00:39:10.150
to say, "I don't remember any of
this,"

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:14.340
to just kind of--and--as a way
to distance yourself from it.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:19.480
Dissociative fugue is kind of
weird and interesting.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.840
The guy's wife leaves him for
another man.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.498
Six months later he was
discovered tending bar in Miami

00:39:26.498 --> 00:39:28.869
Beach and calling himself
Martin.

00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:33.252
And he totally wiped out his
past memory and developed a new

00:39:33.252 --> 00:39:36.335
identity.
This is also known as

00:39:36.335 --> 00:39:40.816
"psychogenic fugue."
So, it's global amnesia but

00:39:40.816 --> 00:39:43.690
there's also identity
replacement.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:47.265
You leave home,
you develop a new identity,

00:39:47.265 --> 00:39:52.293
and it's called a fugue state.
This is my favorite mental

00:39:52.293 --> 00:39:54.703
disorder.
If I had to get a serious

00:39:54.703 --> 00:39:57.384
mental disorder,
I would get this because I'd

00:39:57.384 --> 00:40:00.046
get to travel.
When it wears off your old

00:40:00.046 --> 00:40:03.550
identity comes back and your new
identity is forgotten.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:08.755
Then there's dissociative
identity disorder and this is a

00:40:08.755 --> 00:40:14.239
story of this woman who goes
back and forth from her regular

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:20.560
personality to a personality of
Donna who is only six years old.

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:29.320
This was originally known as
""multiple personality disorder"

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.713
and the idea is you have two or
more distinct people in one

00:40:32.713 --> 00:40:35.552
head.
It is--there are--It is a rare

00:40:35.552 --> 00:40:40.023
and controversial disorder but
it includes some very famous

00:40:40.023 --> 00:40:44.185
cases and has been illustrated
in many movies and books

00:40:44.185 --> 00:40:48.733
including the wonderful movie
Primal Fear where--Ed

00:40:48.733 --> 00:40:52.670
Norton's first big movie,
highly recommend it.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.130
And it's been tried as a
criminal defense.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:59.818
The Hillside Strangler claimed
to be two people but he was

00:40:59.818 --> 00:41:02.449
still convicted,
both of them.

00:41:02.449 --> 00:41:08.100
It typically starts early,
the pattern of dissociation.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.655
Mostly it's women.
And mostly, it involves some

00:41:11.655 --> 00:41:15.199
sort of recollection of torture
or sexual abuse.

00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:19.061
Also, and to get back to your
question, can you have more than

00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:21.530
one mental disorder at the same
time,

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.928
people with dissociative
disorder often show symptoms of

00:41:24.928 --> 00:41:27.400
posttraumatic stress disorder or
PTSD.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:33.471
What causes it?
Well, it is often argued to be

00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:38.828
the cause--caused by severe
abuse, often sexual or physical

00:41:38.828 --> 00:41:41.580
abuse.
The problem is most people who

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.230
get abused don't develop
dissociative identity disorder.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:50.226
And one idea is that it's abuse
plus some sort of genetic or

00:41:50.226 --> 00:41:54.800
biological predisposition to
dissociate and in fact,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.920
people with dissociative
identity disorder seem to be

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.550
very susceptible.
They're easier to hypnotize

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.942
than other people.
And so it might begin as sort

00:42:03.942 --> 00:42:06.849
of a self--an act of
self-hypnosis.

00:42:06.849 --> 00:42:10.525
You put yourself in a hypnotic
trance to cope with some

00:42:10.525 --> 00:42:14.812
terrible situation and you begin
to develop new and separate and

00:42:14.812 --> 00:42:18.593
distinct personalities.
Now, of the many things I'm

00:42:18.593 --> 00:42:21.976
going to talk to you,
I've talked--spoken about,

00:42:21.976 --> 00:42:24.639
some have been very
controversial.

00:42:24.639 --> 00:42:27.761
One issue of controversy which
we talked about was the

00:42:27.761 --> 00:42:31.059
existence in nature of so-called
"repressed memories."

00:42:31.059 --> 00:42:34.190
This is another very
controversial case related to

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.587
the repressed memory case.
In a recent poll,

00:42:37.587 --> 00:42:42.692
less than one quarter of
psychiatrists believe there is

00:42:42.692 --> 00:42:47.420
such a thing as dissociative
identity disorder.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.282
Why would you doubt that?
Well, there are some curious

00:42:50.282 --> 00:42:52.929
statistics.
Between 1930 and 1960,

00:42:52.929 --> 00:42:56.760
there were two cases in the
United States.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.400
In the 1980s,
there were 20,000 cases.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.912
You cannot go elsewhere from
the United States and find

00:43:02.912 --> 00:43:05.840
people with dissociative
identity disorder.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.970
It seems to be an American
phenomena.

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:11.756
And it varies by therapists.
Some therapists,

00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:15.505
indeed some hospitals,
some medical units go decades

00:43:15.505 --> 00:43:20.210
without ever seeing anybody that
approaches dissociative identity

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.354
disorder.
Other therapists,

00:43:22.354 --> 00:43:26.420
virtually every patient they
have has multiple personalities.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:31.755
One worry based on these facts
is dissociative identity

00:43:31.755 --> 00:43:36.324
disorder is in a sense real,
that Richard really does

00:43:36.324 --> 00:43:39.936
believe he's moving from
personality to personality but

00:43:39.936 --> 00:43:43.280
he didn't come in to therapy
with that problem.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.980
Rather, his therapist gave it
to him.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.429
The claim is that it's the
result of suggestion by the

00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:51.135
therapist.
The therapists,

00:43:51.135 --> 00:43:54.218
and they're typically good
people who wish to help,

00:43:54.218 --> 00:43:57.980
but the therapists might be in
the grips of a theory involving

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.063
repression and multiple
personalities and different

00:44:01.063 --> 00:44:05.079
selves and encourage,
either tacitly or overtly,

00:44:05.079 --> 00:44:10.010
their patients to develop these
separate personalities.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.315
Related to this,
it's not clear to what extent

00:44:13.315 --> 00:44:17.796
dissociative identity disorder
is an extreme version of normal

00:44:17.796 --> 00:44:21.940
psychopathology--sorry,
of normal psychology.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.267
So people, from the philosopher
Dan Dennett to the psychologist

00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:29.129
Judith Harris,
have pointed out that we're

00:44:29.129 --> 00:44:32.269
different selves in different
situations.

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:35.987
We can consciously play act the
different selves but we could

00:44:35.987 --> 00:44:39.705
also just shift personalities
depending on whether we're with

00:44:39.705 --> 00:44:42.679
our friends or our family or
with strangers.

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:45.610
The claim is that dissociative
identity disorder,

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:49.196
however dramatic it looks,
might merely be an extended

00:44:49.196 --> 00:44:53.296
version of this where people as
well are to some extent play

00:44:53.296 --> 00:44:56.980
acting to make their therapists
and doctors happy.

00:45:00.199 --> 00:45:06.400
Any questions about
dissociative identity disorder?

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.929
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:45:09.929 --> 00:45:13.090
Professor Paul Bloom:
Yes.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.527
Dissociative amnesia--the
question involves the

00:45:15.527 --> 00:45:18.072
relationship between
dissociative amnesia and the

00:45:18.072 --> 00:45:21.039
retrograde and anterograde
amnesia discussed before.

00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:23.880
Those other amnesias are the
result of brain damage.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.056
They tend to be if not
permanent long lasting and

00:45:28.056 --> 00:45:30.537
severe.
Dissociative amnesia is

00:45:30.537 --> 00:45:34.744
apparently caused by specific
life events and can often be

00:45:34.744 --> 00:45:37.408
very short-lived.
They're, of course,

00:45:37.408 --> 00:45:40.848
all brain events but in the
crude sense the dissociative

00:45:40.848 --> 00:45:44.100
amnesia is more of a
psychological happening than the

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:48.040
other sorts of amnesias that we
talked about involving Korsakoff

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.980
syndrome and the patient "HM"
and so on.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.679
Other questions.
Yes, in back.

00:45:59.679 --> 00:46:08.525
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:46:08.525 --> 00:46:11.196
Yes.
What happened in 1960--There

00:46:11.196 --> 00:46:14.608
was a very famous case.
I think the case was the case

00:46:14.608 --> 00:46:17.090
of Sybil.
Does anybody know?

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.890
The teaching fellows are
nodding but there was a very

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.068
famous case which I think was of
Sybil which was made into a

00:46:23.068 --> 00:46:26.139
movie and discussed and had a
huge influence on people and

00:46:26.139 --> 00:46:28.940
then they started to believe
that it was real.

00:46:32.539 --> 00:46:36.933
There is a type--The fourth and
final type of disorder is

00:46:36.933 --> 00:46:41.718
something which is not actually
discussed in the Gray textbook

00:46:41.718 --> 00:46:45.170
but it has to do with
personality and this is

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:49.955
interesting because it probably
extends to some extent to many

00:46:49.955 --> 00:46:53.800
of these people--the people in
this room.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.883
Personality,
as you remember,

00:46:55.883 --> 00:47:00.572
is your way of dealing with the
world, in particular the way you

00:47:00.572 --> 00:47:03.400
have of dealing with other
people.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.436
The notion of personality
disorders is that some

00:47:07.436 --> 00:47:12.074
personalities are so bad that
they veer off into mental

00:47:12.074 --> 00:47:16.541
illness so one personality
disorder is a narcissistic

00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:20.691
personality disorder.
Everyone likes to talk about

00:47:20.691 --> 00:47:24.289
themselves and thinks they're
terrific to some extent,

00:47:24.289 --> 00:47:28.403
some people to a little bit too
much, but if it's really extreme

00:47:28.403 --> 00:47:32.517
they could talk--they--you could
get labeled with a narcissistic

00:47:32.517 --> 00:47:36.859
personality disorder.
You might have an avoidant

00:47:36.859 --> 00:47:41.340
personality disorder,
dependent, histrionic,

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:44.650
borderline.
Borderline is really bad.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:48.065
When people describe you as a
borderline personality disorder,

00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:50.530
that just means you're just
awful to be with,

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:52.679
you're kind of awful.
[laughter]

00:47:52.679 --> 00:47:56.424
There is the paranoid
personality disorder which is

00:47:56.424 --> 00:47:59.570
not that you're paranoid
schizophrenic,

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:02.200
very clearly no signs of
schizophrenia,

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.900
no hallucinations,
nothing like that.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.993
You are just paranoid.
You're just--to a greater

00:48:07.993 --> 00:48:10.718
extent than normal,
you think other people are

00:48:10.718 --> 00:48:13.139
against you and plotting against
you.

00:48:13.139 --> 00:48:17.186
The most interesting
personality disorders in my mind

00:48:17.186 --> 00:48:21.544
have to do with violence and
crime and they have to do in

00:48:21.544 --> 00:48:25.824
particular with something called
"antisocial personality

00:48:25.824 --> 00:48:29.729
disorder."
Now, most murderers are not

00:48:29.729 --> 00:48:34.426
mentally ill in a medical sense.
They're not mentally ill

00:48:34.426 --> 00:48:37.260
according to how clinicians
categorize things.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:41.400
To some extent,
most people who kill are just

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.540
normal people being driven by
normal desires,

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:50.340
rage, jealousy,
hate, just taken to an extreme.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:55.163
Even mass murderers do not as a
rule appear to be substantively

00:48:55.163 --> 00:48:58.820
different from a psychological
point of view.

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:03.368
In every society--and honestly,
I wrote the lecture on this

00:49:03.368 --> 00:49:07.099
quite a while ago but,
given the recent events,

00:49:07.099 --> 00:49:11.570
they stand as a perfectly good
example of what I'm going to

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:14.189
say.
In every society there is a

00:49:14.189 --> 00:49:17.964
notion of somebody who has been
deeply humiliated,

00:49:17.964 --> 00:49:21.199
usually male,
and he's been humiliated over

00:49:21.199 --> 00:49:24.235
and over again.
He sees himself as losing

00:49:24.235 --> 00:49:27.643
status and losing status and
losing status and he tries to

00:49:27.643 --> 00:49:31.202
get it all back,
to gain face with one act of

00:49:31.202 --> 00:49:36.568
terrible violence where he takes
his revenge over everybody and

00:49:36.568 --> 00:49:39.769
then is known as--and as a
result,

00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:43.034
even though he might die,
he probably will die,

00:49:43.034 --> 00:49:46.866
makes his way to a level of
social status he would have

00:49:46.866 --> 00:49:51.628
never gotten before.
The American term for this used

00:49:51.628 --> 00:49:56.659
to be "going postal" and--but
this is an old idea.

00:49:56.659 --> 00:50:00.687
Stone Age tribes in Papua,
New Guinea, had a term for

00:50:00.687 --> 00:50:03.404
this.
They call it "running amok" and

00:50:03.404 --> 00:50:06.000
this is--and every society has
this.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.819
So, there's normal murderers,
there's mass murderers,

00:50:09.819 --> 00:50:13.418
and then there's the
interesting cases like serial

00:50:13.418 --> 00:50:16.210
killers like Dahmer or Son of
Sam,

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:20.212
Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy,
even the imaginary Hannibal

00:50:20.212 --> 00:50:22.578
Lecter.
Many of these sort of serial

00:50:22.578 --> 00:50:26.036
killers do have some sort of
mental illness but the mental

00:50:26.036 --> 00:50:28.219
illnesses are all over the
place.

00:50:28.219 --> 00:50:30.357
There was a guy,
Jerome Brudos,

00:50:30.357 --> 00:50:34.559
who had such a severe fetish
for women's feet that he killed

00:50:34.559 --> 00:50:38.691
young women and severed their
feet and then kept their feet

00:50:38.691 --> 00:50:43.018
around his house.
Son of Sam was pretty clearly a

00:50:43.018 --> 00:50:47.693
paranoid schizophrenic.
He did his murders because a

00:50:47.693 --> 00:50:51.777
barking dog told him to.
Jeffrey Dahmer is a cannibal

00:50:51.777 --> 00:50:55.628
killer and he killed people so
he could eat them and then--and

00:50:55.628 --> 00:50:59.163
I asked one of my colleagues in
clinical--colleagues what

00:50:59.163 --> 00:51:02.446
exactly was wrong with him and
the person immediately

00:51:02.446 --> 00:51:05.691
responded,
"He has a severe eating

00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:07.252
disorder."
[laughter]

00:51:07.252 --> 00:51:11.619
So, it's--it was a joke.
It was in very, very bad taste.

00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:14.033
[laughter]
A lot of [laughter]

00:51:14.033 --> 00:51:17.861
murderers claim to have
dissociative disorders,

00:51:17.861 --> 00:51:22.271
"it wasn't me who killed the
guy, it was my alter ego,

00:51:22.271 --> 00:51:24.967
Fred."
It's not clear how often

00:51:24.967 --> 00:51:28.785
they're telling the truth,
if ever or whether this is a

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:32.497
way of escaping responsibility.
There is a mental

00:51:32.497 --> 00:51:36.266
illness--There's an extreme,
specific version of a

00:51:36.266 --> 00:51:40.420
personality disorder that
revolves around violence,

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.078
and this is known as
"antisocial personality

00:51:43.078 --> 00:51:43.820
disorder."

00:51:47.219 --> 00:51:50.389
It is--it used to be called
moral insanity.

00:51:50.389 --> 00:51:54.340
Now it's often called
psychopathy.

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:58.751
Some people make a distinction
between psychopath and

00:51:58.751 --> 00:52:01.361
sociopath.
For the purposes here others

00:52:01.361 --> 00:52:04.998
don't, and for the purposes here
I'm going to blend them into one

00:52:04.998 --> 00:52:07.207
category.
Then I'll use the term

00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:11.739
"psychopath."
They're typically male.

00:52:11.739 --> 00:52:15.710
They are defined as selfish,
callous, impulsive,

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:20.472
they're sexually promiscuous.
They seem to lack love,

00:52:20.472 --> 00:52:25.690
loyalty, normal feelings of
affiliation and compassion,

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:30.765
and they get into all sorts of
trouble because they're easily

00:52:30.765 --> 00:52:33.980
bored and they seek out
stimulation.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.971
Now, when you hear this,
you've got to realize that this

00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:41.455
sort of person is not
necessarily an unattractive

00:52:41.455 --> 00:52:46.100
person to imagine or think about
or even under some circumstances

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.493
to encounter.
You have to avoid the

00:52:48.493 --> 00:52:51.487
temptation when you think about
psychopath to think about a guy

00:52:51.487 --> 00:52:53.659
like this, to think about
Hannibal Lecter.

00:52:53.659 --> 00:52:59.021
The most famous psychopath,
of course, is James Bond who is

00:52:59.021 --> 00:53:04.568
a perfect psychopath in every
regard as played by him also by

00:53:04.568 --> 00:53:07.776
Sean Connery.
The Roger Moore and Timothy

00:53:07.776 --> 00:53:10.199
Dalton characters were not
psychopaths.

00:53:10.199 --> 00:53:12.430
I could give a whole course on
that.

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:16.602
Is this an illness?
Well, again,

00:53:16.602 --> 00:53:21.612
this is one of the hard cases.
Psychopaths don't come in for

00:53:21.612 --> 00:53:24.269
treatment.
James Bond would never go to a

00:53:24.269 --> 00:53:26.494
therapist and say,
"I have a problem with

00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:28.719
promiscuity and my life of
adventure.

00:53:28.719 --> 00:53:30.987
[laughter]
Why is it that I don't have

00:53:30.987 --> 00:53:34.418
this need to settle down and
have kids and be a one-woman

00:53:34.418 --> 00:53:37.202
man?"
They don't have a problem with

00:53:37.202 --> 00:53:38.968
it.
Other people often have a

00:53:38.968 --> 00:53:42.493
problem with it but it's not
clear that's enough to make it a

00:53:42.493 --> 00:53:46.117
mental disorder.
Also, a lot of psychopaths are

00:53:46.117 --> 00:53:49.986
reasonably successful.
Now, this gets complicated

00:53:49.986 --> 00:53:54.328
because psychologists study
psychopaths but the psychopaths

00:53:54.328 --> 00:53:57.697
that they study are by
definition unsuccessful

00:53:57.697 --> 00:54:00.880
psychopaths.
And what some people have

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:04.929
argued is the real psychopaths,
the successful ones,

00:54:04.929 --> 00:54:08.155
are the ones that run the
world, that excel in every field

00:54:08.155 --> 00:54:11.494
because they are successful
enough that they don't look like

00:54:11.494 --> 00:54:13.991
psychopaths.
They have no conscience,

00:54:13.991 --> 00:54:15.980
no compassion,
love, loyalty.

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.261
They are cold-blooded and
ambitious but they don't go

00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:23.110
around making this so obvious
that we throw them in prison.

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:28.600
And so, it's an interesting and
subtle and complicated case.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:37.201
The final section – and I'll
start this and we'll go five

00:54:37.201 --> 00:54:40.733
minutes into this and then
move--continue it next week with

00:54:40.733 --> 00:54:43.230
the final class – concerns
therapy.

00:54:48.719 --> 00:54:52.251
Now, the most interesting thing
for us to deal with is the

00:54:52.251 --> 00:54:54.420
question of, "Does therapy
work?"

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.019
And there's a lot to be said
about this.

00:54:57.019 --> 00:55:00.900
The history of therapy has been
gruesome and unsuccessful.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:04.357
Again, to be mad was to be
viewed as to be in league with

00:55:04.357 --> 00:55:07.937
the devil and so people with
mental illnesses were tortured

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:11.130
to death,
burnt, sent out to sea and so

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:12.855
on.
In the eighteenth century they

00:55:12.855 --> 00:55:15.599
were thought of as degenerates
and sent away from society.

00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:21.576
In the nineteenth century there
was a brief blast of compassion

00:55:21.576 --> 00:55:27.455
where Pinel tried to have mental
hospitals and then there were

00:55:27.455 --> 00:55:33.238
all sorts of--since then all
sorts of medical treatments that

00:55:33.238 --> 00:55:38.347
were considerably less
successful and this brief video

00:55:38.347 --> 00:55:44.420
will summarize some of the
previous medical treatments.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:48.170
I often wonder a hundred years
from now how they're going to

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:51.794
look at our current therapies
and then whether they'll see

00:55:51.794 --> 00:55:55.099
them as equally barbaric and
stupid as we look at the

00:55:55.099 --> 00:55:59.081
therapies in the past.
What I'll begin next lecture

00:55:59.081 --> 00:56:03.797
with is a very quick discussion
of what therapies work of the

00:56:03.797 --> 00:56:08.199
ones currently available and
then I'll end the class.

00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:09.829
And this will be a somewhat
short class.

00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:13.309
I'll end the class with a
discussion of happiness.

00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:17.107
There is an optional thing I'll
add, which is your reading

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:20.905
responses are done and you'll
have the opportunity to make

00:56:20.905 --> 00:56:24.502
comments on the class in
anonymous evaluations but what

00:56:24.502 --> 00:56:29.099
I'm kind of interested in is if
people could send me an e-mail,

00:56:29.099 --> 00:56:32.177
and this is entirely optional,
about the most interesting

00:56:32.177 --> 00:56:34.429
thing that we've covered in this
class.

00:56:34.429 --> 00:56:37.571
I'm curious what people think
it is and it's something which I

00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:39.940
could try to build up on for
future classes.

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.174
So, again, this is optional.
Just give it a subject heading

00:56:43.174 --> 00:56:45.932
"Intro Psych" and send it to me
if you choose to do it and I'll

00:56:45.932 --> 00:56:47.398
see you on Wednesday.

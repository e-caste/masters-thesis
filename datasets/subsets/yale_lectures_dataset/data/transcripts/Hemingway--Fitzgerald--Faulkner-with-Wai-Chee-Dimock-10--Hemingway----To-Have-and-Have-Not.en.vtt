00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:13.533
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: We're
moving on to

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.100
To Have and Have Not.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.400
And this novel was written in
a fairly haphazard fashion.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.967
It was written between
1935 and 1937.

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:33.200
Basically, it was written when
Hemingway was taking a break

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.067
from his coverage of the
Spanish Civil War.

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:39.833
So he would be in Spain for
the Spanish Civil War, and

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:45.667
then he would come back to the
United States, but actually

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:49.800
also to the Bahamas to write
To Have and Have Not.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.033
So you guys know that
we'll be reading For

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.933
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.833
For Whom the Bell Tolls and To
Have and Have Not are really

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:01.567
interlocking in multiple ways,
because one is about the

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.233
Spanish Civil War, and this
one's written when Hemingway

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.133
was covering the Spanish
Civil War.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.700
So you can really think of those
as in dialogue in really

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.967
interesting ways.

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:20.367
A hotel that Hemingway stayed at
when he was writing To Have

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:23.567
and Have Not was
in the Bahamas.

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:25.200
It's in Bimini.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.367
It's the Compleat
Angler Hotel.

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:30.867
Actually, the hotel burnt down,
so it's no longer there,

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.100
but this was a picture
taken before that.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.967
That's really lucky that
there was this picture.

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:40.900
And inside there, there's a
plaque saying that this was

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.633
the home of Ernest Hemingway.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.633
He was there for two years.

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.867
He probably wrote To Have and
Have Not in various different

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:52.167
places, but this was one of the
main places that he stayed

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:55.067
at when he wrote the novel.

00:01:55.067 --> 00:02:00.867
As we also know, Cuba was very
important to Hemingway.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:05.433
This is his house still
standing, the Finca Vigia,

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:10.167
which is now the Museo Ernest
Hemingway in Havana.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:14.033
And this is a picture of
Hemingway writing.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.400
He wrote The Old Man and the
Sea when he was in Cuba in

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.567
this very house, and all
his books were there.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:25.967
But this picture was probably
taken a little

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:29.533
later, in the 1950s.

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:34.000
So I found some old pictures
of Havana in the 1930s.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.433
This is the waterfront.

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:40.167
This is the El Malecon
with the seawall.

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:42.600
You can see there's some
really very magnificent

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.500
buildings on the waterfront.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.767
And this is the main avenue,
the Avenida de los

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:54.467
Presidentes, a very, very
impressive-looking avenue.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:58.400
Cuba was actually called the
Paris of the Western

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400
Hemisphere in the first half
of the 20th century.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.767
And we can see why.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.900
It really was a very
magnificent place.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.567
And this is downtown Havana,
still in the '30s.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:14.667
And this is a bar that Hemingway
went to quite a lot.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:16.967
It's the Sloppy Joe's Bar.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:21.533
And here's a picture of him
and the British playwright

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.700
Noel Coward at the
Sloppy Joe's Bar.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.300
So really interesting
historic pictures.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.700
Other than drinking, Hemingway
also went fishing a lot.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.567
As we can see, he has a very
intimate knowledge of fishing.

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:42.600
And the fish that especially

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.267
preoccupied him was the marlin.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:49.700
So this is a description from To
Have and Have Not of what a

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.300
marlin looked like.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.900
And I just happen to have
found this picture.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.800
This doesn't correspond
exactly to that.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.500
"The sword, the eye, and open
lower jaw, and huge

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.300
purple-black head of
a black marlin."

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.700
From this picture, we can't
really see how big it is.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.167
This is a picture of Hemingway
on the boat Anita--

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:12.133
this was just before he wrote
To Have and Have Not--

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:14.567
with his friends.

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:22.733
And the next picture is taken
in Bimini with his second

00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:27.733
wife, Pauline, and his three
sons, Gregory, John, and

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:30.533
Patrick, 1935.

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:34.967
And we can see just how
huge the marlin is.

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.967
It could weigh up
to 1,000 pounds.

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:45.633
So this picture I downloaded
online, thanks to the Ernest

00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:49.433
Hemingway Collection at the
JFK Library in Boston.

00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:53.300
So this is just to acknowledge
a very important collection.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.767
If you guys want to do future
work on Hemingway, that's the

00:04:56.767 --> 00:04:59.000
place to go.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.433
It's helpful in thinking about
To Have and Have Not to think

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.633
a little bit about
the publication

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:10.033
history of this novel.

00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:15.467
It was also published as
two short stories.

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:18.033
"One Trip Across" was
published in the

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:21.300
Cosmopolitan, 1934.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.900
And then "The Trader's
Return" published in

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.000
Esquire magazine, 1936.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.833
And then To Have and Have
Not was published by

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:32.067
Scribner's in 1937.

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:37.967
So because of the way it came
out initially as short

00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:42.733
stories, I think once again
we have to think about the

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:45.167
narrative structure
of the novel.

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:47.567
And there's a lot to think
about, because it turns out

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:50.400
that this is an incredibly
complicated switching back and

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.567
forth between the first person
and the third person.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:58.733
So part one is told in
the first person.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.567
It seems very straightforward.

00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:03.867
It's told from Harry Morgan's
point of view.

00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:07.900
It's also the spring, the
section called "Spring." So it

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.933
is in many ways the spring
in Harry Morgan's life.

00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:19.700
And then part two is told
in the third person.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.967
And this is actually
quite jolting.

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:25.500
All of a sudden, we see Harry
Morgan from the outside as if

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.533
we knew nothing about him.

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:32.667
He's re-introduced to us as "he"
and even as "the man," a

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:36.433
very, very alienating
perspective in part two.

00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:38.933
And that's the section
called the "Fall."

00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:41.867
And then part three is called
the "Winter." And here, it's

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:43.933
even more complicated
than that.

00:06:43.933 --> 00:06:45.600
It's mixed narration.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.000
It begins with someone who's
not even a very important

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.733
character, someone called
Albert who tells the

00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:53.367
story in Chapter 9.

00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:57.567
And then it switches back to
Harry in Chapter 10, and then

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:03.833
we get third-person narration
for a good part of part three.

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:07.333
And then the very final chapter,
Chapter 26, it

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:10.200
switches back to the
first-person narration, but

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.233
it's told by Marie,
Harry's wife.

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:17.733
So at the very least, we can
say that Hemingway is

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:22.333
experimenting with all kinds of
narrative points of views.

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:26.067
And so the most fundamental
question

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:28.033
has to do with pronouns.

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:30.567
Who is attached to
which pronoun?

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:34.533
Why does Hemingway choose
to use certain pronouns?

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:37.567
Why does he choose to use
certain points of views for

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:40.067
that section?

00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:43.167
And this is also a good moment
to start thinking about the

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:45.200
interconnections among
the novels.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.367
I know that you guys just turned
in your first paper,

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:51.867
but it's not too early to start
thinking about the next

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:53.567
big project.

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:57.133
And the interconnections among
the novels would be a very

00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:58.000
good approach.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.233
Think about that
larger project.

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:04.900
So two things are very clear
in terms of the prior

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.733
publication as short stories.

00:08:07.733 --> 00:08:13.833
To Have and Have Not obviously
looks back to In Our Time.

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:16.067
Hemingway's habit is to publish

00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:17.900
parts as short stories--

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.400
actually, it's very common--

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.000
publish parts as short stories,
and then to have a

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.700
larger entity.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.033
Whether or not the two are
related in terms of this prior

00:08:29.033 --> 00:08:32.067
publication history is
a good question.

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:35.900
But To Have and Have Not is also
linked to The Sound and

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.067
the Fury because of the multiple
narrative voices.

00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:43.533
In The Sound and the Fury, we
know that there are just four.

00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:47.900
So the three brothers each gets
one section, and then the

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.000
omniscient narration
in section four.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.867
In To Have and Have Not, it's
much less clear-cut than that.

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:59.933
As I just mentioned, someone
who's quite marginal to the

00:08:59.933 --> 00:09:02.600
story, like Albert, gets
to have the section.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.300
So he obviously doesn't have the
centrality that Benjy or

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.967
Quentin or Jason --

00:09:07.967 --> 00:09:11.367
that the three brothers do in
The Sound and the Fury.

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:15.433
Why does someone like Albert
get to tell the story?

00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:20.233
Even though the two novels share
a common ground in terms

00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:24.267
of multiple narrative voices,
the actual configuration of

00:09:24.267 --> 00:09:27.200
those voices are two different

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.067
configurations in the two
novels.

00:09:30.067 --> 00:09:33.967
And finally, something new is
also emerging in To Have and

00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:38.633
Have Not that we haven't seen so
far or that hasn't been in

00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:40.933
the foreground up
to this point.

00:09:40.933 --> 00:09:43.600
And I'd like to call your
attention to it, which is

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.467
characters as generic types.

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:50.733
It has to do with
classification, with taxonomy

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:52.200
of social types.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.867
We see it in the very
title of the novel.

00:09:55.867 --> 00:10:00.633
It's divided into two, the
haves and the have-nots.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:04.100
And obviously, two
social types.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:09.500
It's very much an organizing
principle in this novel, but

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.033
it also looks forward to
Fitzgerald's stories that

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:16.267
we'll be reading next week.

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:20.500
A story like "The Rich Boy"
is very much about this

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.167
classifiable, generic type.

00:10:30.933 --> 00:10:36.433
So I want to think about the
difference between the two

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:42.033
novels in terms of another novel
that Hemingway is famous

00:10:42.033 --> 00:10:43.833
for, which is The Old
Man and the Sea.

00:10:48.867 --> 00:10:52.767
And they're both set in Cuba.

00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:56.367
They're both about Cuba to some
extent, but they're not

00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:59.533
centrally about Cuba,
but set in Cuba.

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:02.367
But in many ways, they represent
two different sides

00:11:02.367 --> 00:11:04.600
of the spectrum.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.367
To Have and Have Not, as we can
see from the title, is a

00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:11.733
divided canvas.

00:11:11.733 --> 00:11:16.000
It's populated by two
taxonomic groups.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.933
So it's very much about
classifiability.

00:11:18.933 --> 00:11:23.000
Not only is it giving us two
taxonomic groups, but it's

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.400
also about the phenomenon
of classifiability.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.533
Are human beings classified?

00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:32.633
Can they be put under various
generic labels?

00:11:32.633 --> 00:11:36.100
That is a big question
in this novel.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.800
The Old Man and the Sea is in
many ways on the other side of

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.767
the spectrum.

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:48.533
As we can see and as you guys
know, the story, the novel, is

00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:55.900
about a solitary Cuban
fisherman, Santiago, and his

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.600
decision to go out alone.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.933
And he did get this
huge marlin--

00:12:00.933 --> 00:12:03.167
once again, that fish--

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:06.267
and he's trying to save
that marlin from

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.333
being eaten up by sharks.

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:11.700
So the novel is really about
his struggle against the

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.267
sharks, and he loses out.

00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:16.467
The marlin is completely cleaned
out by the sharks by

00:12:16.467 --> 00:12:17.500
the end of the novel.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.267
But in spite of that ending,
it is really about a heroic

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:25.100
struggle of a man against
elemental forces.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.367
So most of us know Hemingway
actually as the Hemingway of

00:12:29.367 --> 00:12:31.333
The Old Man and the Sea.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:34.800
And it's helpful to
keep that in mind.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.500
But Hemingway is also very
interested in the other side

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.200
of the equation, which is not
so much about individuals as

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.867
about individuals who can
be understood or can be

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:53.533
encompassed or accounted for
in terms of social types.

00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:59.567
So we see it not only in the
main characters in the novel,

00:12:59.567 --> 00:13:02.400
but also in very marginal
characters, people

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.767
who appear just once.

00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:07.467
They're also presented to
us as social types.

00:13:07.467 --> 00:13:12.033
So the very opening of the
novel, Harry Morgan is

00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:16.267
approached by three young Cubans
who want to pay him a

00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:19.567
lot of money to be taken
to the United States.

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:22.333
And this is how they
are described.

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:26.767
"They were good-looking young
fellows, wore good clothes.

00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:30.067
None of them wore hats, and
they looked like they had

00:13:30.067 --> 00:13:31.867
plenty of money.

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:36.933
They talked plenty of money,
anyway, and they spoke the

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:41.000
kind of English Cubans
with money speak."

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.567
So obviously classifiability
is front and

00:13:44.567 --> 00:13:46.200
center in this passage.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.133
The very syntax--

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:50.600
"they talked plenty of money"--
is an expression that

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.400
we use, and it certainly is the
kind of labeling that goes

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.667
on behind that kind of syntax.

00:13:56.667 --> 00:14:00.667
So the outward appearance, the
clothes, the speech patterns

00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:05.900
of these people easily
classify them.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.233
We don't really need to know
much else about them, and

00:14:09.233 --> 00:14:11.433
Hemingway is not interested
in telling us

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:12.767
much else about them.

00:14:12.767 --> 00:14:15.833
They are just there as
representatives of Cubans with

00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:21.067
money who need to get out
of Cuba at that moment.

00:14:21.067 --> 00:14:25.467
But because classifiability
seems so central to the novel,

00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:29.300
the question obviously arises
as to whether or not Harry

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.800
Morgan himself is
classifiable.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.567
He is a hero, he's a
protagonist, who inhabits a

00:14:37.567 --> 00:14:41.733
novel that is populated by
lots of social types.

00:14:41.733 --> 00:14:44.633
Whether or not he belongs,
whether or not he fits

00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:49.267
completely into that landscape
is the open question.

00:14:49.267 --> 00:14:52.667
Is he able to break away

00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:54.500
occasionally from that
landscape?

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.300
Does he manage to stand out and
be an individual that we

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.000
would recognize and that will
stick in our memories as one

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.433
individual rather than
as one social type?

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:10.967
That is the question that
we have to think about.

00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:15.133
And I'd like to break that down
a little bit in terms of

00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:19.967
four interconnected clusters
of issues.

00:15:19.967 --> 00:15:23.967
One is to what extent is
Harry Morgan a racist?

00:15:23.967 --> 00:15:27.667
Is he a racist, or is
he not a racist?

00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:29.167
The other question--

00:15:29.167 --> 00:15:32.067
and that's something that
we've already seen in

00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:34.967
Faulkner, the play of pronouns,
and that is

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:38.200
highlighted, dramatized, by
Hemingway's choice of

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.600
narrative technique--

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.467
is whether he is an "I" or
whether he is a "he."

00:15:45.467 --> 00:15:50.467
And the choice of those
pronouns obviously has

00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:52.400
narrative implications.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.600
If he is an "I," very likely
we're going to see

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.367
the inside of him.

00:15:57.367 --> 00:16:00.667
It's going to be an interior
view of Harry.

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:03.467
If he's going to be a "he," very
likely, it's going to be

00:16:03.467 --> 00:16:06.333
an external view of Harry.

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:09.933
Just as in Faulkner, there's an
external view and not very

00:16:09.933 --> 00:16:13.733
pretty view of Dilsey in the
fourth section of The Sound

00:16:13.733 --> 00:16:15.000
and the Fury.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.600
And finally, going back to the
title of the novel, whether he

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.000
is a have or have-not.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.467
Does he exit the novel
empty-handed?

00:16:26.467 --> 00:16:30.233
Can you say that he has achieved
something, that

00:16:30.233 --> 00:16:33.000
something is in his possession,
that he has

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.400
something, he owns something?

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.467
He owns a boat in
the beginning.

00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:41.833
Whether he still owns anything
at all at the end of the

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:45.333
novel, that is an
open question.

00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:49.933
I raised the question of racism,
because that is the

00:16:49.933 --> 00:16:53.333
question raised by
Toni Morrison.

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:57.733
Toni Morrison, we know as
the author of novels.

00:16:57.733 --> 00:16:59.400
We know her as a
novelist. She's

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.900
written novels like Beloved.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:08.333
But she is also someone who
gives a lot of talks, and she

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:11.633
also turned some of those
talks into essays.

00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:15.633
So Playing in the Dark is a
collection of essays published

00:17:15.633 --> 00:17:17.433
by Toni Morrison.

00:17:17.433 --> 00:17:22.000
And she devotes a long section
to Hemingway and To

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.433
Have and Have Not.

00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:26.267
It's very interesting that this
is not the best-known

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:30.633
novel by Hemingway, but this
is the novel that Morrison

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:35.400
singles out, although she's
singling it out not to praise

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.467
it, but to point to some
troubling aspects of To Have

00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:41.167
and Have Not.

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:44.267
And this is what
Morrison says.

00:17:44.267 --> 00:17:50.133
"Harry includes a nigger in his
crew, a man who throughout

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:53.567
all of part one has no name.

00:17:53.567 --> 00:17:57.900
His appearance is signaled by
the sentence, 'Just then, the

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.867
nigger we had getting bait comes
down to the dock.' The

00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:05.967
black man is not only nameless
for five chapters, he's not

00:18:05.967 --> 00:18:07.367
even hired.

00:18:07.367 --> 00:18:11.467
Just someone we had getting
bait, a kind of trained

00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:15.800
response, not an agent
possessing a job."

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.900
And then she goes on to say,
"The spatial and conceptual

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.933
difference is marked by the
shortcut that the term

00:18:23.933 --> 00:18:29.267
'nigger' allows, with all
of its color and caste

00:18:29.267 --> 00:18:31.000
implications.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.333
The term occupies a territory
between man and animal."

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:42.400
Very, very strong objections
to the novel.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.033
In response, I would like just
not to defend Hemingway

00:18:46.033 --> 00:18:49.267
completely, but just to point
out that the word "nigger" is

00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:51.900
used by Faulkner, as
we've just seen.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.400
It is also used by Mark Twain,
because that's the word that

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.067
those characters would
have used.

00:18:57.067 --> 00:18:59.700
Huck Finn would have used
the "nigger" in

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.767
the nineteenth century.

00:19:00.767 --> 00:19:03.367
It would have been very odd for
Mark Twain not to use that

00:19:03.367 --> 00:19:05.333
word in his novel.

00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:08.300
Someone like Quentin, certainly
Jason, would have

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.633
used the word "nigger" if
they were living people.

00:19:12.633 --> 00:19:16.267
So it would have been very odd
for Faulkner not to use that

00:19:16.267 --> 00:19:19.533
word, because that's the basic
speech pattern of his

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:20.867
characters.

00:19:20.867 --> 00:19:31.633
But Morrison actually concedes
that it's only in part one

00:19:31.633 --> 00:19:34.400
that this black man doesn't
have a name.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.733
He does have a name
in part two.

00:19:36.733 --> 00:19:39.767
So we can look at that moment
of transition when the black

00:19:39.767 --> 00:19:41.067
man acquires a name.

00:19:41.067 --> 00:19:43.267
All of a sudden, we find
out what he's called.

00:19:43.267 --> 00:19:50.667
But before we get to part two,
I just want to call attention

00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:56.267
to a passage where the word
"nigger" is used, but not to

00:19:56.267 --> 00:20:00.433
describe the black man that
Morrison has in mind.

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:04.433
This is an earlier appearance
of that word "nigger," and

00:20:04.433 --> 00:20:09.567
this is actually coming right
after Harry's conversation

00:20:09.567 --> 00:20:13.567
with those three rich Cubans.

00:20:13.567 --> 00:20:16.467
All of a sudden, there's
this fighting

00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:19.433
breaking out and shooting.

00:20:19.433 --> 00:20:23.567
And it turns out that the key
player in that shooting is a

00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:25.133
black character.

00:20:25.133 --> 00:20:31.167
"The nigger with the Tommy gun
got his face almost into the

00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:35.533
street and gave the back of
the wagon a burst from

00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:39.500
underneath, and sure enough, one
came down, falling toward

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.867
the sidewalk with his
head above the curb.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:46.900
At 10 feet, the nigger shot
him in the belly with the

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.200
Tommy gun, with what must have
been the last shot in it,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.933
because I saw him
throw it down.

00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:57.567
And old Pancho sat down hard
and went over forwards.

00:20:57.567 --> 00:21:01.567
He was trying to come up, still
holding onto the Luger,

00:21:01.567 --> 00:21:04.500
only he couldn't get his head
up when the nigger took the

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.567
shotgun that was lying against
the wheel of the car by the

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:12.567
chauffeur and blew the
side of his head off.

00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:15.700
Some nigger."

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.967
So we might object to the
violence of the scene, but

00:21:20.967 --> 00:21:27.233
what is clear in this passage
is the tremendous admiration

00:21:27.233 --> 00:21:30.467
that Hemingway has for
this black character.

00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:33.733
He's meant to kill.

00:21:33.733 --> 00:21:37.867
His job is to kill the three
rich Cubans, and he

00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:39.867
accomplishes that task
magnificently.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:50.067
And Hemingway is just using
every bit of his writerly

00:21:50.067 --> 00:21:54.033
skill to convey to us, even
those of us who really know

00:21:54.033 --> 00:21:59.300
nothing about guns and nothing
about the art of shooting, to

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.300
highlight for us what an art
this is, to be able to get

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.467
your face almost down to the
street and to be able to get

00:22:06.467 --> 00:22:11.767
someone, to get the shotgun when
there's nothing left in

00:22:11.767 --> 00:22:15.367
your own Tommy gun and to be
able to finish off the last of

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:16.700
the three Cubans.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.567
One against three.

00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:21.967
It's just the performance
of it.

00:22:21.967 --> 00:22:25.900
So there's nothing but
admiration in this description

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.500
of the black man.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:33.100
And we can almost get a capsule
summary of the intense

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:38.000
admiration from the two-word
phrase that concludes the

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.500
passage, "some nigger."
Hemingway is still using the

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:48.267
word "nigger," but the
expression "some nigger"

00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:51.733
almost completely undermines
that word.

00:22:51.733 --> 00:22:54.000
Yes, he's a nigger.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.333
He's a classifiable type.

00:22:57.333 --> 00:22:59.700
But he's a magnificent
specimen.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:04.233
He's an amazing specimen
of that type.

00:23:04.233 --> 00:23:06.733
So much so that he's stretching

00:23:06.733 --> 00:23:08.200
that type to its limit.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.700
So much so that he's almost
making that type

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.100
non-functional.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.533
He's such an amazing character
that it is almost--

00:23:16.533 --> 00:23:17.867
you can call him a
nigger, but it

00:23:17.867 --> 00:23:18.800
doesn't really mean anything.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.667
He's "some nigger."

00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:25.500
It turns out that that
construction, "some" followed

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.267
by what appears to be a
derogatory term, that is a

00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:32.000
kind of a verbal tic
for Harry Morgan.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.233
He uses that phrase over and
over again for other

00:23:35.233 --> 00:23:36.233
characters as well.

00:23:36.233 --> 00:23:40.267
So we can go and look at some
other instances when he uses

00:23:40.267 --> 00:23:42.467
that construction.

00:23:42.467 --> 00:23:48.033
And it turns out that he also
uses it for the man who owes

00:23:48.033 --> 00:23:51.833
him $825, and he's
able to clear out

00:23:51.833 --> 00:23:52.800
without paying a cent.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.433
This is the very rich Mr.
Johnson who charters the boat

00:23:56.433 --> 00:24:06.600
for fishing, manages to lose
all the works on the boat,

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:15.233
manages to do real damage to
Harry's boat because of his

00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:16.567
ineptness as a fisherman.

00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:20.900
And so he owes $825.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.333
And this Mr. Johnson, even
though he is quite inept as a

00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:30.433
fisherman, he nonetheless is
very skilled in one thing, and

00:24:30.433 --> 00:24:33.867
this is what this passage
pays tribute to.

00:24:33.867 --> 00:24:37.933
"'He went on the plane,"
Frankie said.

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:38.500
All right.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.567
There it was.

00:24:39.567 --> 00:24:41.033
The consulate was closed.

00:24:41.033 --> 00:24:47.333
I had $0.40, and anyhow, the
plane was in Miami by now.

00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:49.467
I couldn't even send a wire.

00:24:49.467 --> 00:24:51.800
Some Mr. Johnson, all right.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.333
It was my fault.

00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:55.200
I should have known better.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.167
Hell, I didn't even have enough
money to put in gas.

00:24:58.167 --> 00:25:00.267
It was a hell of a
note, all right.

00:25:00.267 --> 00:25:02.367
Some Mr. Johnson."

00:25:02.367 --> 00:25:08.033
It is not the same kind of
performance as the shooting,

00:25:08.033 --> 00:25:14.933
but it gets from Harry the same
involuntary admiration,

00:25:14.933 --> 00:25:19.667
even though he's obviously the
victim of that magnificent

00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:22.800
performance on the part
of Mr. Johnson.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.867
It takes nerve.

00:25:23.867 --> 00:25:28.367
It takes whatever,
ruthlessness.

00:25:28.367 --> 00:25:33.933
We can attach any number of
adjectives to Mr. Johnson.

00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:37.533
But Hemingway, in his much
more economic style of

00:25:37.533 --> 00:25:42.733
writing, uses only one phrase,
and that is enough.

00:25:42.733 --> 00:25:44.800
That is completely adequate
for Mr. Johnson.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.600
There's no need for any string
of adjectives to be attached

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.767
to Mr. Johnson.

00:25:49.767 --> 00:25:52.967
"Some Mr. Johnson,"
that does it all.

00:25:52.967 --> 00:25:59.033
So we can see right away that
this is really Hemingway's way

00:25:59.033 --> 00:26:02.700
of both paying tribute to
a generic type--in this

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.333
case, a rich man--

00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:07.500
even his name is generic,
Mr. Johnson.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.467
He's a generic type.

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:16.867
He's a generic rich man who
manages to get to be where he

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:19.967
is by what he does, by doing
certain numbers of things.

00:26:19.967 --> 00:26:22.467
And he's very good at that.

00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:27.167
So once again, this is a
specimen of a generic type

00:26:27.167 --> 00:26:31.000
that is so good at what he's
doing that he stretches the

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.967
limit of that type.

00:26:34.967 --> 00:26:36.167
One other example.

00:26:36.167 --> 00:26:39.833
And this one is much more
analogous to the expression

00:26:39.833 --> 00:26:44.667
"some nigger." We know that
actually even in Cuba, there's

00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:46.867
a very significant--

00:26:46.867 --> 00:26:50.567
even in Havana now, there's
a very important Chinese

00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:51.367
population.

00:26:51.367 --> 00:26:54.100
And it turns out that there is a
Chinese character in To Have

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.800
and Have Not.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:01.100
He's a very smooth-talking,
smooth-looking Chinaman.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.333
He wears a white suit and a silk
shirt with a black tie

00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:08.433
and a $125 Panama hat.

00:27:08.433 --> 00:27:12.833
So he also talks like this,
and Hemingway gives us a

00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:16.200
specimen of the speech
pattern of this very

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.867
classifiable type.

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:19.933
He talks like an Englishman.

00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:22.067
"'Quite so,' Mr. Sing said.

00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:25.067
'How many of my unfortunate
compatriots could you both

00:27:25.067 --> 00:27:28.867
accommodate?' 'You mean carry?'
He stood up, and I

00:27:28.867 --> 00:27:30.367
watched him go out.

00:27:30.367 --> 00:27:33.700
Frankie smiled at
him as he went.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.767
Mr. Sing didn't look at him.

00:27:35.767 --> 00:27:39.500
He was a smooth-looking
chink, all right.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.867
Some chink."

00:27:42.867 --> 00:27:48.367
So once again, this is a type
that outperforms the type by a

00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:49.633
wide margin.

00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:54.933
So this is about what kind of
performance can be expected

00:27:54.933 --> 00:28:00.267
within a generic type and the
extent of that outperformance.

00:28:00.267 --> 00:28:04.667
Even as a smooth talking
chink, Mr. Sing

00:28:04.667 --> 00:28:07.733
is very, very memorable.

00:28:07.733 --> 00:28:11.467
And we see it--

00:28:11.467 --> 00:28:16.700
even when Mr. Sing is dead, he's
still memorable and still

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.067
more than just a specimen.

00:28:18.067 --> 00:28:24.667
You guys probably know that Mr.
Sing is killed by Harry,

00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:29.333
because he wants Harry basically
to kill off 12

00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:32.800
Chinese passengers that he has
no intention of shipping to

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.167
where they thought
they were going.

00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:38.867
So he wants Harry to kill those
12 Chinese passengers.

00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:41.900
And instead of killing those 12
Chinese passengers, Harry

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:47.400
kills Mr. Sing, but not without
a lot of resistance,

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.133
very heroic resistance,
magnificent

00:28:51.133 --> 00:28:53.000
resistance, from Mr. Sing.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.900
And this is the outcome.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.767
He's dead, he's killed
by Harry, but he's

00:28:58.767 --> 00:29:01.367
left a mark on Harry.

00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:04.400
And this is actually the
beginning of the bodily

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.267
injuries sustained by Harry.

00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:12.067
This is actually one of the
structural principles in the

00:29:12.067 --> 00:29:18.200
novel is the things that
eat into Harry's body.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.533
And that is part of the catalog
of things that we can

00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:26.467
put on the have-not column.

00:29:26.467 --> 00:29:28.733
Harry starts with--

00:29:28.733 --> 00:29:30.533
he's an able-bodied person.

00:29:30.533 --> 00:29:31.433
He's complete.

00:29:31.433 --> 00:29:37.200
He has all his body parts, and
he gradually loses some parts

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.567
of his body, or parts of his
body will get damaged.

00:29:40.567 --> 00:29:43.967
So this is the first instance
of something that happens to

00:29:43.967 --> 00:29:49.233
his body, and it's coming to
him because of Mr. Sing.

00:29:49.233 --> 00:29:55.333
"I held the wheel with my knee
and opened up my shirt and saw

00:29:55.333 --> 00:29:58.567
where Mr. Sing bit me.

00:29:58.567 --> 00:30:03.367
It was quite a bite, and
I put iodine on it.

00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:07.133
And then I sat there steering
and wondering whether a bite

00:30:07.133 --> 00:30:09.733
from a Chinaman was poisonous.

00:30:09.733 --> 00:30:12.467
Hell, no, that bite
wasn't poisonous.

00:30:12.467 --> 00:30:15.767
A man like that Mr. Sing
probably scrubbed his teeth

00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:17.567
two or three times a day.

00:30:17.567 --> 00:30:19.500
Some Mr. Sing."

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:24.200
This is Hemingway writing and
not Faulkner, but we see the

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.233
same mixture of tragedy
and comedy right

00:30:28.233 --> 00:30:30.533
here in full display.

00:30:30.533 --> 00:30:34.000
So it is not a great experience
to be bitten by

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.333
anyone, and this seems to
be a very bad bite.

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:42.233
But the bite is also an occasion
on what a generic,

00:30:42.233 --> 00:30:45.300
smooth-looking chink would do.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.567
He's going to be brushing his
teeth three or four times a

00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:51.767
day, and you can count on his
hygiene to save you from

00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:53.700
getting any infection
from his bite.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.467
So this one consoling fact--

00:30:57.467 --> 00:31:00.767
that if you have to be bitten,
it's better to be bitten by

00:31:00.767 --> 00:31:04.600
the likes of Mr. Sing than
to be by someone else--

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.767
that is the dark comedy
that is emerging in To

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:10.900
Have and Have Not.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:17.033
But it also is a meditation
really on all

00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:19.900
those derogatory labels.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.933
And the question to us as to
whether or not we should

00:31:24.933 --> 00:31:27.967
consider them allowable, whether
or not we should say,

00:31:27.967 --> 00:31:31.800
this is an instance where it
is completely legitimate to

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.367
use those words, or whether we
still think that some other

00:31:35.367 --> 00:31:37.067
word would have been
preferred.

00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:42.033
So I encourage you to talk about
this issue in section.

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:49.567
But now I'd like to switch to
part two of To Have and Have

00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:56.500
Not and to the possibility
that Harry Morgan himself

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:04.367
might actually be portrayed as
a type, as dramatized and

00:32:04.367 --> 00:32:07.633
reinforced by Hemingway's
narrative technique.

00:32:07.633 --> 00:32:11.900
So we're switching to the
third-person narration and a

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.267
very jolting outside view
of Harry Morgan.

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:19.533
And this is also the moment
when the black character

00:32:19.533 --> 00:32:22.400
actually acquires a name.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.000
"'I'm sorry, Wesley,' the man
said, 'but I got to steer.'

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.933
'You treat a man no better than
a dog,' the nigger said.

00:32:30.933 --> 00:32:34.200
He was getting ugly now,
But the man was

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.400
still sorry for him.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.167
'I'm going to make you
comfortable, Wesley,' he said.

00:32:39.167 --> 00:32:42.867
'You just lay quiet.' 'You ain't
going to fix me up,' the

00:32:42.867 --> 00:32:43.900
nigger said.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:49.200
The man, whose name was Harry
Morgan, said nothing then,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.733
because he liked the nigger,
and there was nothing to do

00:32:52.733 --> 00:32:57.900
now but hit him, but he
couldn't hit him."

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:04.100
It almost seems an act of
deliberate hostility against

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.567
his own character, after so many
pages when we're inside

00:33:08.567 --> 00:33:13.500
the head and inside the skin of
Harry Morgan, to encounter

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.200
that phrase, "the man, whose
name was Harry Morgan." It

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.900
can't be more externalizing
than that.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.133
It can't be more objectifying
than that.

00:33:25.133 --> 00:33:30.267
What is interesting is that that
objectifying description

00:33:30.267 --> 00:33:37.367
is actually used for a white
protagonist in the same moment

00:33:37.367 --> 00:33:40.767
when the black character
is acquiring a name.

00:33:40.767 --> 00:33:44.567
So this double dynamics suggests
that this is a very,

00:33:44.567 --> 00:33:46.767
very important moment.

00:33:46.767 --> 00:33:52.233
The black character acquires a
name, and the white character

00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:56.200
also acquires a name,
but in a bad way.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.433
When he had been telling the
story, he doesn't refer to

00:33:59.433 --> 00:34:01.600
himself as Harry Morgan.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.200
For the white character to
acquire a name and to be

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.533
referred to as "the man, whose
name was Harry Morgan" puts

00:34:08.533 --> 00:34:13.233
him in almost exactly the same
structural position as the

00:34:13.233 --> 00:34:14.833
black man, Wesley.

00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:17.667
Each of them acquires a name,
except that for the black

00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:20.900
character to acquire a name is
a good thing, whereas for the

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.833
white character, acquiring a
name is about the worst thing

00:34:24.833 --> 00:34:27.867
that can happen to him
at that moment.

00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:32.533
Why is it that Hemingway would
suddenly switch to this

00:34:32.533 --> 00:34:35.900
third-person narration and this
very alienating mechanism

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.767
that has been visited
upon Harry Morgan?

00:34:39.767 --> 00:34:43.533
We can think of a number
of issues.

00:34:43.533 --> 00:34:51.367
In part one, we sort of know
what Harry does for a living.

00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:53.567
Why does this man have a boat?

00:34:53.567 --> 00:34:55.933
We have our conjectures.

00:34:55.933 --> 00:35:01.967
But in part two, all of that
is being clarified for us.

00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:06.400
We know that the black
man is shot.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.000
And there's the smell of liquor
all over the boat.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.800
The boat itself is referred
to as the booze boat.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.500
So we know that's what Harry
does is that he smuggles

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.633
liquor into the United States.

00:35:24.633 --> 00:35:27.167
He becomes just that.

00:35:27.167 --> 00:35:32.067
That's his profession, and
that's what we know him by.

00:35:32.067 --> 00:35:37.867
That takes over the intimate,
internal view that we had of

00:35:37.867 --> 00:35:39.267
him in part one.

00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:46.433
And because that is the
occupation that lands him in

00:35:46.433 --> 00:35:49.533
this very tight spot with his
companion, the black man,

00:35:49.533 --> 00:35:50.633
Wesley, being shot.

00:35:50.633 --> 00:35:55.600
And we also know that something
else as well, that

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.500
Wesley is not the only one to
be shot on that occasion, as

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:07.733
we find out in this
next description.

00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:10.867
"'Who the hell's shot worse?'
He asked him.

00:36:10.867 --> 00:36:16.500
'You or me?' 'You're shot
worse,' the nigger said.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.400
'But I ain't never been shot.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.200
I didn't figure to get shot.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.833
I ain't paid to get shot.

00:36:21.833 --> 00:36:25.567
I don't want to be shot.' 'Take
it easy, Wesley,' the

00:36:25.567 --> 00:36:26.567
man told him.

00:36:26.567 --> 00:36:31.067
'It don't do you any good
to talk like that.'"

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:35.067
Just this one little detail
that in fact both

00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:38.233
of them were shot--

00:36:38.233 --> 00:36:41.433
because they obviously
had a run-in.

00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:43.867
The booze boat was discovered.

00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:53.000
And so it was a major event with
casualties in both Harry

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.933
and Wesley.

00:36:54.933 --> 00:36:59.633
So far, what is in the
foreground in part two is the

00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:03.067
casualties that were sustained
by Wesley, and that's what

00:37:03.067 --> 00:37:04.200
he's complaining about.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.533
He's making everyone aware
that he's been shot.

00:37:09.533 --> 00:37:16.033
The extent of Harry's wound is
revealed to us in this very

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:19.767
oblique, very marginal
mention--

00:37:19.767 --> 00:37:24.133
"'Who the hell's shot worse?' he
asked. 'You or me?' 'You're

00:37:24.133 --> 00:37:28.800
shot worse.'" So Wesley
acknowledges that actually the

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.767
more serious wound
is on Harry.

00:37:30.767 --> 00:37:32.733
But we don't actually
know what the

00:37:32.733 --> 00:37:35.567
consequences might be.

00:37:35.567 --> 00:37:39.467
Because right now, the limelight
is really on Wesley

00:37:39.467 --> 00:37:43.333
and the fact that he's furious
for having gotten shot, for

00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:49.467
going on this trip with Harry,
and Harry trying his best to

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:50.033
appease Wesley.

00:37:50.033 --> 00:37:54.600
And then in the rest of part
two, we also have this outside

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.833
character, Frederick Harrison,
who takes up a lot of the

00:37:57.833 --> 00:38:01.600
space in part two, wanting
to report Harry to the

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.100
authorities.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:09.400
So part two is in many ways a
part of the story in which we

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:16.433
see Harry as someone who should
be reported to the

00:38:16.433 --> 00:38:21.267
authorities, someone who is the
recipient of complaint, of

00:38:21.267 --> 00:38:24.500
ill will, of anger, of a grudge,
at the very least,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:29.300
from Wesley, and who's also
someone that an outsider would

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.133
want to report to
the authorities.

00:38:31.133 --> 00:38:36.000
He's someone who's doing
something illegal, and he's

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.333
outside the law in many ways.

00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:43.233
So all of that suggests that
it is fitting that in part

00:38:43.233 --> 00:38:48.367
two, the story should be told
from outside of his point of

00:38:48.367 --> 00:38:50.567
view, that we're no longer
inside his skin.

00:38:50.567 --> 00:38:54.000
We're just seeing him as he is
seen by other people, as he's

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.900
seen by Wesley, as he's seen by
Captain Willie, who tries

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.467
to protect him, as he is seen
through the binoculars by

00:39:02.467 --> 00:39:04.533
Frederick Harrison, who
wants to report him.

00:39:04.533 --> 00:39:09.233
So he really is an object, he's
a seen object, and it is

00:39:09.233 --> 00:39:13.600
fitting that a seen object
should be conveyed to us

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.133
through the third-person
narration.

00:39:16.133 --> 00:39:21.600
But I think that there's also
another reason why Hemingway

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.033
would want to switch from
first-person narration to

00:39:26.033 --> 00:39:27.300
third-person narration.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:32.567
It's that already in part two,
we're beginning to see a

00:39:32.567 --> 00:39:37.967
symmetry between Harry and
the black man, Wesley.

00:39:37.967 --> 00:39:44.100
We just saw that both of them
acquire a name in part two.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.000
We now see in this moment that
they are also linked.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.033
They are kindred in one sense.

00:39:50.033 --> 00:39:53.800
They are kindred in a narrative
sense, in the same

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.600
way that Benjy, Quentin, and
Jason are kindred in a

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.467
narrative sense in
Faulkner's novel.

00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:05.133
These two are kindred in a
narrative sense, because the

00:40:05.133 --> 00:40:09.767
same thing happens to
them, being shot.

00:40:09.767 --> 00:40:13.233
That is the tie between
this black character

00:40:13.233 --> 00:40:15.267
and this white character.

00:40:15.267 --> 00:40:20.300
And the only difference between
them, actually, is the

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.133
degree of severity
of that shot.

00:40:23.133 --> 00:40:26.967
And here, actually, we know that
it is the black man who

00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:29.533
actually has the lighter wound,
that it's the white

00:40:29.533 --> 00:40:36.533
protagonist who's
suffering more,

00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:38.667
actually, on this occasion.

00:40:38.667 --> 00:40:42.367
So both the commonality between
the white character

00:40:42.367 --> 00:40:45.067
and the black character, but
also a potential line of

00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:47.867
differentiation, in the sense
that it's the person who has

00:40:47.867 --> 00:40:52.267
the lighter wound who's being
taken care of by Harry.

00:40:52.267 --> 00:40:59.167
Let's then go to Chapter 9,
which is in part three.

00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:04.567
And here, this is a chapter that
is told by Albert, the

00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:06.967
very marginal character.

00:41:06.967 --> 00:41:12.267
So it is told from Albert's
point of view, but Harry is

00:41:12.267 --> 00:41:14.333
once again seen from
the outside.

00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:18.633
He is a "he" in part
three, Chapter 9.

00:41:18.633 --> 00:41:22.867
But what is also interesting
about part three, Chapter 9,

00:41:22.867 --> 00:41:27.733
is that it basically is a
revisiting of an earlier

00:41:27.733 --> 00:41:31.467
moment between Harry
and Wesley.

00:41:31.467 --> 00:41:36.400
And now we know the consequences
of that gunshot

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.233
wound earlier.

00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:44.000
"'What happened to your arm?'
the lawyer asked Harry.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.633
Harry has the sleeve pinned
up to the shoulder.

00:41:47.633 --> 00:41:50.300
'I didn't like the look
of it, so I cut it

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.033
off,' Harry told him.

00:41:53.033 --> 00:41:58.967
'You and who else cut it off?'
'Me and a doctor cut it off,'

00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:04.133
Harry said."

00:42:04.133 --> 00:42:09.300
I think that Hemingway really
wants that shock that comes

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:16.300
from that lack of knowledge
in part two.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.700
Part two goes on for quite a
while, and all the time when

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.400
we're reading about Frederick
Harrison, we have no idea that

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.733
the wound is serious
enough that the arm

00:42:27.733 --> 00:42:29.733
would have to be amputated.

00:42:29.733 --> 00:42:35.700
And it's the withholding of that
information in part two

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.600
that maximizes it
in part three.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.700
It is a shock to us that
that is what will have

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.933
to happen to Harry.

00:42:45.933 --> 00:42:51.800
And none of that would have been
conveyed to us if Harry

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.567
had been telling the story.

00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:56.633
It is impossible to talk about
the amputation of the arm with

00:42:56.633 --> 00:43:01.600
this kind of dramatic
impersonality that Hemingway

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.933
is aiming for.

00:43:02.933 --> 00:43:05.367
If it had been told from Harry's
point of view, it

00:43:05.367 --> 00:43:09.667
would have been about his pain,
but Hemingway is not

00:43:09.667 --> 00:43:14.267
into conveying the inside
view of pain.

00:43:14.267 --> 00:43:17.600
That is not the phenomenal
field that

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.667
he chooses to enter.

00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:22.767
Some other novelists do a
great job within that

00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:24.400
phenomenal field.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.667
That is not Hemingway's
chosen subject.

00:43:27.667 --> 00:43:32.333
What he wants is to give us
that complete impersonal,

00:43:32.333 --> 00:43:36.267
neutral, almost joking
kind of look at

00:43:36.267 --> 00:43:39.367
someone losing his arm.

00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:42.333
And that can only be achieved
by looking at

00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:43.567
Harry from the outside.

00:43:43.567 --> 00:43:48.467
So the combination of the
straightforward, third-person

00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:53.533
narration in part two and then
Albert telling the story in

00:43:53.533 --> 00:43:59.267
part three, Chapter 9, the
combination of those maximizes

00:43:59.267 --> 00:44:04.400
the shock of realizing that,
really, Harry is starting to

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.633
lose something.

00:44:05.633 --> 00:44:09.267
He's well on his way in his
trajectory towards the

00:44:09.267 --> 00:44:10.800
have-not category.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.467
He's well on his way.

00:44:11.467 --> 00:44:18.067
Losing one's arm is quite
different from losing lots of

00:44:18.067 --> 00:44:20.367
other things, to
say the least.

00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:26.533
So we've just seen that Harry
has something in common with

00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:30.533
Wesley, but we also see that
he has something else in

00:44:30.533 --> 00:44:33.200
common with someone
else as well.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.567
Because of course someone else
prior to this had also lost

00:44:37.567 --> 00:44:40.133
his arm, Mr. Sing.

00:44:40.133 --> 00:44:44.833
In the fight between Harry and
Mr. Sing, Harry tries to bend

00:44:44.833 --> 00:44:48.267
Mr. Sing's arm behind him, and
at one point, he just hears

00:44:48.267 --> 00:44:52.000
this funny little noise that is
made when an arm is broken.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.567
And then he lets go of the arm,
because the arm isn't

00:44:54.567 --> 00:44:56.233
good to Mr. Sing anymore.

00:44:56.233 --> 00:45:00.533
So we've seen that dramatized
rendition of someone losing

00:45:00.533 --> 00:45:05.633
his arm and this deliberately
undramatized rendition of

00:45:05.633 --> 00:45:07.967
someone losing his arm and only

00:45:07.967 --> 00:45:10.433
appearing as a man without--

00:45:10.433 --> 00:45:15.633
for Harry to appear as a man
without an arm, as seen by the

00:45:15.633 --> 00:45:17.767
doctor by a lawyer.

00:45:17.767 --> 00:45:22.667
So once again, it's Harry as a
seen object, but still the

00:45:22.667 --> 00:45:24.067
common ground is there.

00:45:24.067 --> 00:45:26.500
He and Mr. Sing actually do
have something in common.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.700
Mr. Sing loses his arm.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.833
He loses his life.

00:45:29.833 --> 00:45:31.833
Harry loses his arm.

00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:36.133
Whether or not he's going to
lose his life like Mr. Sing is

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:39.733
the open question in To
Have and Have Not.

00:45:39.733 --> 00:45:43.667
So this is a novel that actually
it is very hard to

00:45:43.667 --> 00:45:47.333
predict the ending of this
novel, so I'm very happy not

00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:49.167
to tell you the ending
and just leave

00:45:49.167 --> 00:45:50.567
it as an open question.

00:45:50.567 --> 00:45:54.867
To what extent is the symmetry
between Harry and Mr. Sing

00:45:54.867 --> 00:45:56.433
going to extend?

00:45:56.433 --> 00:45:58.433
How far does that extend?

00:45:58.433 --> 00:46:06.467
But just one more meditation on
the question of having and

00:46:06.467 --> 00:46:08.200
not having.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:12.767
It seems that Harry actually
is quite aware that he's on

00:46:12.767 --> 00:46:15.900
his way to becoming
a have-not.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.733
But he has his own way of
classifying himself.

00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:26.033
So this is one character's
attempt to classify himself in

00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:27.500
his own fashion.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.233
And what is going to be used
as the criteria for

00:46:31.233 --> 00:46:33.100
classifying the haves
and the have-not?

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.467
You can classify people by the
amount of money they have, or

00:46:36.467 --> 00:46:39.533
you can classify them by whether
or not they have arms,

00:46:39.533 --> 00:46:42.033
or you can classify them
by something else.

00:46:42.033 --> 00:46:45.133
So here is Harry proposing
to classify

00:46:45.133 --> 00:46:48.500
himself in his own fashion.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.900
"'The hell with my arm.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.267
You lose an arm, you
lose an arm.

00:46:52.267 --> 00:46:54.733
There's worse things
than lose an arm.

00:46:54.733 --> 00:46:56.733
You've got two arms,
and you've got two

00:46:56.733 --> 00:46:58.333
of something else.

00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:03.033
And a man's still a man with one
arm or with one of those.

00:47:03.033 --> 00:47:05.133
The hell with it,' he says.

00:47:05.133 --> 00:47:07.867
'I don't want to talk about it.'
Then after a minute, he

00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:11.667
says, 'I got those other
two still.'"

00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:18.933
So this is the celebrated
concept of the cojones that

00:47:18.933 --> 00:47:25.067
Harry still has, a word that
Hemingway is very fond of.

00:47:25.067 --> 00:47:29.667
And that's how he would like
to classify himself.

00:47:29.667 --> 00:47:33.033
Maybe the arm is the most
obvious thing that people see,

00:47:33.033 --> 00:47:37.333
but the most obvious thing is
not actually the thing that

00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:39.467
best classifies someone.

00:47:39.467 --> 00:47:43.767
Something that is invisible
could be a better classifier.

00:47:43.767 --> 00:47:48.400
So I think that the novel
entertains that question is,

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.633
how much can you lose?

00:47:50.633 --> 00:47:53.233
Harry is going to lose a lot
of things in the course of

00:47:53.233 --> 00:47:55.200
this novel.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.700
You can keep on losing
a lot of things and

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.233
still remain yourself.

00:48:00.233 --> 00:48:03.900
At least, that's the hope, or
maybe that's a fantasy.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.800
We have to decide whether it is
a legitimate hope, a real

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.800
hope, a hope that actually has
some grounding in reality, or

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.467
whether it is just a fantasy,
whether at a certain point

00:48:14.467 --> 00:48:18.367
when you've lost so much, that
you really have stopped being

00:48:18.367 --> 00:48:21.200
yourself, you're no longer what
you used to be, whether

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.500
that is indeed the case.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:28.233
So we'll come back and wrap up
the novel, but think more

00:48:28.233 --> 00:48:30.867
about where we should
put Harry.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.591
Prof: Okay,
so our task today is to finish

00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:10.359
up teaching about Rawls,
and then I'm going to take a

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.907
step back and look at where
we've gotten to so far in

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:18.674
today's course,
because we're really entering a

00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:21.798
transition moment from the
Enlightenment to the

00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:26.810
anti-Enlightenment,
which is what we'll begin with

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.420
on Wednesday.
 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.664
So just to recap briefly,
we had been talking about

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:37.418
Rawls's two principles of
justice which were really three

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:41.295
principles of justice,
one for the distribution of

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.454
liberties,
which was his most expansive

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:48.750
system compatible with the like
liberty for all.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.427
One was the principal of
equality of opportunity which is

00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:58.014
2b in his lexical ranking,
which for some reason known

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:00.978
only to John Rawls comes before
2a,

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:04.408
and the third one was 2a,
this so called difference

00:01:04.408 --> 00:01:07.412
principle,
or what used to be called in

00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:10.578
welfare economics the maximin
principle,

00:01:10.578 --> 00:01:14.409
which says maximize the minimum
share.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.459
And I had explained to you why
Rawls thinks the standpoint of

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:24.510
justice is the standpoint of the
most adversely affected,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.697
which is not a bleeding heart
idea but rather this

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:31.611
universalizable idea,
this notion that if you can

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:35.346
affirm a principle,
even from the standpoint of

00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:39.090
those people who are most
adversely affected by it,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.266
you'll affirm it from every
other conceivable standpoint as

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:43.769
well.
 

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:48.584
And so this translated into
these L-shaped indifference

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:53.933
curves per if we start with a
distribution like that anywhere

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:59.461
in this area would be preferred
because all Rawls is interested

00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.760
in is maximizing that distance.
 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.938
That is the size of the share
at the bottom.

00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:10.788
He's indifferent to who has
that share.

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:15.104
So that, say,
a move from X to F over here

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:21.313
would be an improvement for
Rawls even though it's clearly a

00:02:21.313 --> 00:02:25.840
massive loss to A and a huge
gain to B.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.740
He's not interested in that.
 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.424
The point is that the distance
from the axis to F is greater

00:02:34.424 --> 00:02:41.221
here than the distance from the
axis to X is there and that's

00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:45.300
the only relevant consideration.
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.436
Now sometimes Rawls is called
an egalitarian,

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:52.640
and as I began to point out to
you at the end of Wednesday's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.348
lecture, that's really
misleading.

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:59.090
His principle is rather very
underdetermined.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.473
That is to say if we compare it
with the Pareto principle it

00:03:05.473 --> 00:03:11.210
completely contains within it
the Pareto principle.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.740
So that if somebody came along
and said,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.717
"Well, the best way to
benefit the people at the bottom

00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:21.470
is to have markets--
trickle down let's say that the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.497
pie will grow the most and the
people at the bottom will

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.938
benefit the most from a pure
market system--

00:03:28.938 --> 00:03:31.554
Rawls would say,
"Fine,"

00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:35.910
because everything that is
Pareto superior is also Rawls

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.020
preferred.
 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.809
On the other hand,
if somebody came and made the

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:44.759
case that heavy state
intervention to redistribute

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:49.115
would in fact work to the
greatest benefit of the least

00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:53.550
advantaged then he would agree
with that as well.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.026
And so you can conjure up
egalitarian results that are

00:03:59.026 --> 00:04:04.710
compatible with the Rawlsian
scheme, or anti-egalitarian

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.949
results.
 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:11.280
A further consideration comes
in here when we stop just

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.105
talking about the worst-off
individual because you can start

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:21.050
to think about,
well, what happens if you get a

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.120
small marginal increment for the
person at the bottom paid for by

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.125
massive cuts on the middle class
and perhaps big benefits to the

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:30.269
very wealthy.
 

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:35.069
And I mentioned the example of
the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.160
which had that structure.
 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.497
Rawls would have no objection
to that either even though from

00:04:41.497 --> 00:04:45.762
an egalitarian perspective that
would look like a regressive

00:04:45.762 --> 00:04:49.160
redistribution from the status
quo in 1980.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.500
So it's a very underdetermined
principle.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.980
It's not necessarily
egalitarian or necessarily

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.420
anti-egalitarian.
 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.562
All it says is,
"Arrange things to the

00:05:01.562 --> 00:05:05.528
greatest benefit of the person
at the bottom."

00:05:05.528 --> 00:05:09.528
And as I think I mentioned to
you, Rawls took a lot of

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:14.204
criticism in the 1970s and 1980s
from people who would plow all

00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:18.732
the way through to page 300 and
whatever it is in his book to

00:05:18.732 --> 00:05:23.031
learn that Rawls says he's
agnostic between capitalism and

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.389
socialism.
 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.875
And people say, "Well,
to read 300 pages of a book

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:33.444
about justice and discover the
author is agnostic between the

00:05:33.444 --> 00:05:37.937
two main political economic
systems of the twentieth century

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:40.680
isn't exactly satisfying."
 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.613
But Rawls' answer,
as I said, is which type of

00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:49.598
political economic system
actually operates to the benefit

00:05:49.598 --> 00:05:54.670
of the person at the bottom is
not a question for political

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.069
theorists.
 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.910
That's a question maybe for a
political economist,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.040
maybe for trial and error
through policy innovation.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.252
It's going to have to get
hammered out in the real world

00:06:06.252 --> 00:06:08.778
of practical political economy.
 

00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:12.930
And so it's not a critique of
the Rawlsian standard.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.821
It's underdetermined with
respect to the choice of actual

00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:23.389
political economic systems.
 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.600
And I think that Rawls is on
relatively firm ground there.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.985
We wouldn't want to think that
what political economy is the

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:36.000
most efficient from the
standpoint of benefiting people

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.865
at the bottom is really a
philosophical question when

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:41.649
clearly it is not.
 

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:44.680
So that's the Rawlsian story.
 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.906
I gave you the big picture at
the beginning:

00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:51.660
his general conception of
distributive justice,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.221
and then these more specific
principles that get added in the

00:06:57.221 --> 00:07:02.692
course of trying to figure out
how the general conception of

00:07:02.692 --> 00:07:06.029
justice can actually be applied.
 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.629
Now I want to take a step back.
 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:11.507
I'm going to come back to Rawls
a little bit later,

00:07:11.507 --> 00:07:14.788
but I want to take a step back
first and think about where

00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:15.939
we've come from.
 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:21.358
And then we'll see how Rawls
leads us to think about where

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.069
we've gotten to.
 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:27.370
We started out this course by
talking about Enlightenment

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.829
political theory.
 

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:32.314
The Enlightenment being a
philosophical movement that

00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:36.601
really starts in the seventeenth
century but gathers steam in the

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:40.855
eighteenth century,
and I said that from the point

00:07:40.855 --> 00:07:44.029
of view of political
arrangements,

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:48.190
there were really two core
values of the Enlightenment.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.779
One was a commitment to the
idea of individual freedom as

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:57.615
realized through a doctrine of
individual rights as the most

00:07:57.615 --> 00:08:03.757
important value in politics,
and the second was a commitment

00:08:03.757 --> 00:08:07.742
to science,
reason and science as the basis

00:08:07.742 --> 00:08:12.500
of politics rather than things
that had prevailed hither to

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.589
such as natural law,
or tradition,

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:19.209
or natural rights,
or religious argument.

00:08:19.209 --> 00:08:22.170
That rather the move,
which we saw so dramatically

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.434
with Bentham but has been
present in one way or another

00:08:25.434 --> 00:08:29.649
with everybody we've looked at,
the move is to say, "No,

00:08:29.649 --> 00:08:31.980
we're not going to appeal to
tradition.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.580
We're not going to appeal to
religion.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.418
We're not going to appeal to
natural law, natural rights.

00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:40.798
We're going to appeal to the
idea of science,

00:08:40.798 --> 00:08:44.980
science understood through
reason."

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.147
And so those are the two twin
ideas which one way or another

00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:55.139
have shaped every single
theorist that we've looked at.

00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:59.058
So starting with the commitment
to science,

00:08:59.058 --> 00:09:02.879
remember those early
Enlightenment theorists were

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:07.336
very different from modern
Enlightenment thinkers in that

00:09:07.336 --> 00:09:10.759
they identified science with
certainty.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:15.095
Remember the Cartesian idea
that you have certainty about

00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:20.523
the contents of your own mind,
or Locke's point that only we

00:09:20.523 --> 00:09:26.370
have that kind of privileged
access into the contents of our

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.558
own soul.
 

00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:33.297
Remember his famous line to the
effect that true and lasting

00:09:33.297 --> 00:09:38.839
conviction requires inward
persuasion of the mind and that

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:45.158
can't be forced on anybody by
the magistrate or anybody else;

00:09:45.158 --> 00:09:49.350
that this internal certainty is
so important.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.941
And for Hobbes we saw that
knowledge has its basis in

00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:56.769
willing things.
 

00:09:56.769 --> 00:10:01.432
So we got this rather curious
result that he said,

00:10:01.432 --> 00:10:06.759
"The laws of geometry have
the force of laws because

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:09.899
they're the product of wills.
 

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:12.136
We make the triangle,
if you like,

00:10:12.136 --> 00:10:15.798
and the laws of politics were
like the laws of geometry

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:20.139
because we make the commonwealth
in the same way that we make the

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:23.258
triangle,"
and that therefore in the early

00:10:23.258 --> 00:10:27.191
Enlightenment there was this
enormous emphasis on certainty

00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:29.700
as the hallmark of science.
 

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.837
But then we saw,
as we moved into the mature

00:10:32.837 --> 00:10:36.558
Enlightenment with people like
John Stuart Mill,

00:10:36.558 --> 00:10:39.860
that actually they had a very
different view of science.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.610
That the hallmark of science
was fallibilism,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.298
that everything we think we
know is subject to doubt.

00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:53.419
There isn't anything in our
reasoning about the real world

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:58.451
that meets the Cartesian
criterion of being impossible to

00:10:58.451 --> 00:10:59.350
doubt.
 

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.279
What we think we know is always
revisable in the light of more

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:08.080
evidence and better scientific
investigation.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.442
And Mill's defense of the
marketplace of ideas,

00:11:11.442 --> 00:11:14.951
and of competition,
and argument was precisely to

00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:16.340
encourage that.
 

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.926
And so the long chapter on
freedom of thought and action in

00:11:21.926 --> 00:11:25.490
On Liberty is really
about--

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:31.006
remember how we get from
freedom to utility via a system

00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:34.720
that allows the truth to come
out,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.325
mainly a system in which ideas
have to confront contrarian

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:44.750
ideas in the marketplace of
public speech,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:52.259
and that science is really a
process which makes it possible,

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:55.558
or more possible than any other
process,

00:11:55.558 --> 00:11:59.388
for us to approximate the
truth, but that's something very

00:11:59.388 --> 00:12:02.678
different from having this
notion of certainty.

00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:06.826
So the commitment to science
becomes the commitment to

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:11.211
fallibilism,
and the commitment to a system

00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:17.206
which has room in it for
experimental searching after the

00:12:17.206 --> 00:12:23.629
truth as a perpetual feature of
human social association.

00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:27.548
Now when we look at Rawls and
Nozick,

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:32.332
and the social contract
theorists, we find at least in

00:12:32.332 --> 00:12:36.394
some respects a sort of
throwback to the early

00:12:36.394 --> 00:12:40.744
Enlightenment,
at least in the Nozick and the

00:12:40.744 --> 00:12:44.168
Rawls that we've talked about to
date.

00:12:44.168 --> 00:12:48.827
That is to say,
they are looking for a unique

00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:53.974
answer to the question,
"What principles would

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:59.558
people agree upon if they were
designing society afresh?"

00:12:59.558 --> 00:13:03.743
And this hypothetical social
contract, so called,

00:13:03.743 --> 00:13:08.535
depends on the idea that
there's a unique answer to that

00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:10.278
question, right?
 

00:13:10.278 --> 00:13:13.355
So they can see that there
never was a social contract,

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:15.861
but they say,
"Suppose we were designing

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.399
the rules from scratch?
 

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.168
What rules would we
design?"

00:13:19.168 --> 00:13:22.778
even though no society was ever
created in that way.

00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:25.678
And the thought was,
"Well,

00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:29.129
if there's an answer to that
question,

00:13:29.129 --> 00:13:31.798
if there's a definitive answer
to that question,

00:13:31.798 --> 00:13:35.273
then we have a standard,
a yardstick for measuring

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:38.250
actual institutional
arrangements."

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.711
That is to say,
societies that come closer to

00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:46.196
that standard can be judged
better than societies that are

00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:47.769
further from it.
 

00:13:47.769 --> 00:13:51.573
And as societies evolve over
time, if they evolve toward it

00:13:51.573 --> 00:13:54.854
they'll be improving,
and if they evolved away from

00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:57.149
it they would be getting worse.
 

00:13:57.149 --> 00:14:01.235
So this was the Kantian,
or what I called neo-Kantian

00:14:01.235 --> 00:14:05.556
aspiration to come up with a
standard which any rational

00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:08.620
person must, on reflection,
affirm.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.768
And if you can say what that
is, then you have your yardstick

00:14:13.768 --> 00:14:18.659
by reference to which you can
look at actual political and

00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:20.720
social arrangements.
 

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.706
And it might be worth pausing
just for a second to notice that

00:14:25.706 --> 00:14:29.225
Immanuel Kant himself,
who we didn't read in this

00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:32.460
course so you'll have to just
take it on faith from me--

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.948
Kant himself was deeply
skeptical that that could be

00:14:35.948 --> 00:14:39.234
done because he thought that
social and political

00:14:39.234 --> 00:14:42.586
arrangements are inevitably
dependent on empirical

00:14:42.586 --> 00:14:46.692
considerations and you're not
going to get the universal laws

00:14:46.692 --> 00:14:48.538
about those things.
 

00:14:48.538 --> 00:14:53.283
So Kant himself would have been
skeptical of the Rawlsian

00:14:53.283 --> 00:14:54.129
project.
 

00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:57.240
He would have said,
"You're not going to be

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.086
able to get empirical
propositions about the

00:15:00.086 --> 00:15:04.322
organization of society that are
going to rise to this level of a

00:15:04.322 --> 00:15:06.639
categorical imperative."
 

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:10.576
And I think that one
implication of our discussion of

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.678
Rawls is that Kant was,
in fact, right.

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:18.827
For example,
Rawls' story about protecting

00:15:18.827 --> 00:15:26.234
the position of the person at
the bottom assumes an enormous

00:15:26.234 --> 00:15:29.750
degree of risk aversion.
 

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.490
Now he had an answer for why.
 

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.210
He said, "Well,
there's no necessary

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.360
relationship between the level
of economic development and the

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.216
fortunes of the person at the
bottom,"

00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:45.210
so you had that grave risk
assumption.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.472
But we saw that even that
becomes problematic if you think

00:15:49.472 --> 00:15:54.110
about very marginal improvements
in the condition of the person

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.673
at the bottom coming at enormous
costs for the person a little

00:15:58.673 --> 00:16:00.168
bit higher up.
 

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:04.688
It's not at all clear that the
rational thing to do would be

00:16:04.688 --> 00:16:09.207
always to, at no matter what
cost, to preserve the condition

00:16:09.207 --> 00:16:11.658
of the person at the bottom.
 

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:16.654
The important article about
this published by John Harsanyi

00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:21.563
in 1975 argues that if you
really think that people have a

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:26.259
rational view of risk,
it would make more sense to

00:16:26.259 --> 00:16:31.792
choose utilitarianism behind the
veil of ignorance than it would

00:16:31.792 --> 00:16:36.621
make to choose the Rawlsian
commitment to maximizing the

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:40.308
position of the person at the
bottom.

00:16:40.308 --> 00:16:43.491
Now it's not obvious that
Harsanyi is right,

00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:46.750
but nor is it obvious that
Rawls is right.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:52.110
And once you make that
admission, then you no longer

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.529
have a unique answer.
 

00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:56.970
You say, "Well,
we plug one set of

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.759
psychological assumptions in
about risk and we get Rawls.

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:04.750
We plug a different set of
assumptions in about risk and we

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.192
get Harsanyi,"
and so it's all being driven by

00:17:08.192 --> 00:17:12.253
the assumptions about human
psychology that we plug into the

00:17:12.253 --> 00:17:13.078
model.
 

00:17:13.078 --> 00:17:17.079
And, of course,
once you recognize that then

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.150
you don't have a unique answer.
 

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.634
Another way of putting it is
that the young Rawls was rather

00:17:25.634 --> 00:17:30.282
na�ve about what is
uncontroversial in economics,

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:32.980
psychology and sociology.
 

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.353
That is, Rawls made a
distinction between the laws of

00:17:36.353 --> 00:17:39.098
psychology and economics,
as he put them,

00:17:39.098 --> 00:17:42.880
which we do have knowledge of
behind the veil of ignorance and

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.670
which he was treating as
uncontroversial,

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.958
and then the specific knowledge
that we have about our

00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:53.094
particular life plans,
goals and so on which he kept

00:17:53.094 --> 00:17:54.519
hidden from us.
 

00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:59.263
But it turns out that there are
very few uncontroversial

00:17:59.263 --> 00:18:03.318
assumptions about human
psychology or economics,

00:18:03.318 --> 00:18:06.769
and so you can't get unique
answers.

00:18:06.769 --> 00:18:11.683
And indeed, if we only restrict
ourselves to economics one of

00:18:11.683 --> 00:18:15.942
the most interesting
developments in economics of the

00:18:15.942 --> 00:18:20.119
past decade is precisely the
turn away from standard

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:25.198
economistic assumptions into the
field of psychology to see how

00:18:25.198 --> 00:18:29.557
preferences are formed,
why people have the risk

00:18:29.557 --> 00:18:31.950
profiles that they do and so on.
 

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:37.429
And much of modern behavioral
economics regards as subjects

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:41.868
for study rather than axiomatic
assumptions,

00:18:41.868 --> 00:18:45.640
the source of things Rawls
wanted to work with.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.920
So there isn't a unique answer.
 

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:55.919
Now as it turns out as Rawls
became older he realized that

00:18:55.919 --> 00:19:04.058
this neo-Kantian venture was
built upon a hill of sand,

00:19:04.058 --> 00:19:08.881
and that he wasn't going to be
able to make Kant's ethics do

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:13.458
the work in social contract
theory that traditionally had

00:19:13.458 --> 00:19:18.769
been done by natural law for the
reason that I just gave you.

00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:22.367
You're not going to actually be
able to get unique results out

00:19:22.367 --> 00:19:22.838
of it.
 

00:19:22.838 --> 00:19:27.240
And so the mature Rawls made a
different kind of move,

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.192
which in some ways is an even
bigger retreat from the early

00:19:31.192 --> 00:19:34.940
Enlightenment than was Mills
retreat to fallibilism,

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.371
and that is the move that comes
under the heading of

00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:41.490
"political,
not metaphysical."

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:47.196
And that's the name of the
subtitle of the article I had

00:19:47.196 --> 00:19:50.309
you reading about for today.
 

00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:55.430
And so here's the intuition.
 

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.540
It's counterintuitive until you
think it through,

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.430
but then I think it's actually
quite a powerful intuition.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.886
And I'm going to explain it to
you actually not by reference to

00:20:07.886 --> 00:20:10.925
Rawls,
but by another person called

00:20:10.925 --> 00:20:15.660
Cass Sunstein who's a lawyer at
the University of Chicago.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.144
You might hear a lot about him
because he's on the long short

00:20:20.144 --> 00:20:23.509
list for Obama picks for the
Supreme Court.

00:20:23.509 --> 00:20:26.390
So Cass Sunstein might be in
the news.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.130
Stay tuned.
 

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.410
But Sunstein had a different
slogan;

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.546
not "political,
not metaphysical,"

00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:38.847
but rather what he called a
theory of incompletely theorized

00:20:38.847 --> 00:20:39.868
agreement.
 

00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:46.297
This is not an elegant term,
but let me give you the

00:20:46.297 --> 00:20:48.440
intuition here.
 

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.373
We often think,
when we think about political

00:20:51.373 --> 00:20:53.351
disagreement,
we often think,

00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:57.056
well, people can agree on very
general things and the devil is

00:20:57.056 --> 00:20:58.150
in the details.
 

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.190
People can agree that freedom
is good,

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:07.670
but they can't agree on what is
actually required for freedom

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:14.259
when you get down to brass tacks
of arguing about policies.

00:21:14.259 --> 00:21:18.599
Does freedom require people
have universal healthcare?

00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:19.720
Some people say yes.
 

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.798
Some people say no, right?
 

00:21:21.798 --> 00:21:25.830
So one view of political
disagreement is we can agree at

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.248
a very high altitude,
but then when you start to get

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:35.211
into the dirty particulars of
everyday life then we can't

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.009
agree.
 

00:21:36.009 --> 00:21:41.016
Sunstein and Rawls in his
political-not-metaphysical mode

00:21:41.016 --> 00:21:45.038
have the almost opposite
intuition to that.

00:21:45.038 --> 00:21:50.068
And so here the sort of example
would be,

00:21:50.068 --> 00:21:59.272
well, think about a faculty in
a university trying to decide

00:21:59.272 --> 00:22:07.230
whether or not a junior person
should get tenure.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.134
They might be able to agree
that the person should get

00:22:11.134 --> 00:22:15.409
tenure without being able to
agree in a million years about

00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:18.210
why the person should get
tenure,

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.640
or when we think of Congress
passing a piece of legislation,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.625
when we think of Congress
passing the healthcare bill that

00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:33.098
just went through,
warts and all,

00:22:33.098 --> 00:22:36.180
through the House.
 

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.050
You get the votes,
but if those people had to

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:45.506
agree upon why they were voting
for it they couldn't agree in a

00:22:45.506 --> 00:22:47.088
million years.
 

00:22:47.088 --> 00:22:51.298
They all have different reasons
for why they're voting for it or

00:22:51.298 --> 00:22:54.371
why they're voting against,
it for that matter,

00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:55.038
right?
 

00:22:55.038 --> 00:22:58.194
So the notion of incompletely
theorized agreement is,

00:22:58.194 --> 00:22:59.529
"You know what?
 

00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:03.000
We don't care."
 

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.085
We don't care,
or Rawls' idea of

00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:07.910
"political,
not metaphysical."

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.930
The question is,
what political arrangements

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.950
would people with very different
values,

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.891
commitments,
worldviews, metaphysical

00:23:18.891 --> 00:23:21.730
systems,
what would they agree on?

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.809
What would be,
to use another one of Rawls's

00:23:25.809 --> 00:23:30.460
terms, what would be the
overlapping consensus?

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.980
Think of sort of a big Venn
diagram where you've got a lot

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.434
of circles mostly not
overlapping, but they all

00:23:40.434 --> 00:23:42.759
overlap in one area.
 

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:47.348
That's the overlapping
consensus, okay?

00:23:47.348 --> 00:23:51.019
And we don't care about the
parts that don't overlap.

00:23:51.019 --> 00:23:54.963
So it's much less
rationalistically ambitious

00:23:54.963 --> 00:24:00.344
because now if you think back to
the first principle we don't

00:24:00.344 --> 00:24:04.915
have to say that the
fundamentalist would agree that

00:24:04.915 --> 00:24:10.205
she or he has more freedom in a
disestablished church regime

00:24:10.205 --> 00:24:15.494
than the non-fundamentalist
would have in the fundamentalist

00:24:15.494 --> 00:24:17.019
regime.
 

00:24:17.019 --> 00:24:21.869
All we have to say is that the
fundamentalist accepts this.

00:24:21.869 --> 00:24:23.119
We don't know why.
 

00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:25.348
We don't care why.
 

00:24:25.348 --> 00:24:28.271
So that's the notion of
incompletely theorized

00:24:28.271 --> 00:24:31.130
agreement, or political,
not metaphysical.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:35.681
We're just going to look for
what is the overlapping

00:24:35.681 --> 00:24:40.232
consensus for people with very
different worldviews,

00:24:40.232 --> 00:24:44.250
metaphysical systems,
beliefs, et cetera.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:51.788
Okay, and so another way you
can think about this is,

00:24:51.788 --> 00:24:54.602
instead of saying,
"First I'm going to

00:24:54.602 --> 00:24:57.986
convince you of my metaphysics,
and my epistemology,

00:24:57.986 --> 00:25:01.816
and my theory of science,
and then when I've persuaded

00:25:01.816 --> 00:25:06.571
you about all of those things
I'm going to show you how my

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:09.410
political theory follows."
 

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:13.240
On the Sunstein or mature Rawls
view that's a mug's game.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.415
You're never going to do it
because people are never going

00:25:15.415 --> 00:25:16.828
to agree about all of those
things.

00:25:16.828 --> 00:25:20.788
And more important for politics
we don't need them to agree

00:25:20.788 --> 00:25:22.700
about all of those things.
 

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:30.402
All we need to do is find the
overlapping consensus that they

00:25:30.402 --> 00:25:32.200
will affirm.
 

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.415
So they might affirm a series
of political arrangements,

00:25:36.415 --> 00:25:39.788
institutions,
for very different reasons from

00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:42.779
one another, and it doesn't
matter.

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:46.660
We don't need it to be any more
robust than that.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.078
And so that's where the mature
Rawls winds up.

00:25:51.078 --> 00:25:55.760
And as we'll see in the final
lectures of this course there is

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.442
a certain democratic element to
this, but it's under-theorized

00:26:00.442 --> 00:26:01.440
in Rawls.
 

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.829
And the analogy I'll just
mention and I'll come back to it

00:26:06.829 --> 00:26:12.410
later in the course is--the
analogy is the secret ballot.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:17.911
We don't require people to give
reasons for the way in which

00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:19.028
they vote.
 

00:26:19.028 --> 00:26:23.048
They can have reasons for
choosing the same candidate as

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:27.069
we choose that we would regard
as completely idiotic.

00:26:27.069 --> 00:26:30.288
We don't care, right?
 

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:35.170
So the
political-not-metaphysical move;

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:39.144
or the incompletely theorized
agreement move is analogous to

00:26:39.144 --> 00:26:42.915
the idea of the secret ballot in
that we become much less

00:26:42.915 --> 00:26:43.858
demanding.
 

00:26:43.858 --> 00:26:50.282
People don't have to have good
reasons for voting the way they

00:26:50.282 --> 00:26:50.808
do.
 

00:26:50.808 --> 00:26:55.180
Their reasons are their private
business, okay?

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.832
And so the
political-not-metaphysical move

00:26:58.832 --> 00:27:02.038
builds on that kind of
intuition,

00:27:02.038 --> 00:27:07.692
and obviously it's a huge
retreat from the original

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:14.250
Enlightenment motivation to get
principles that must follow

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:20.470
scientifically for any
clearheaded-thinking person.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:26.116
So the mature Rawls is a kind
of extreme retreat,

00:27:26.116 --> 00:27:28.000
you might say.
 

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.309
Even though the young Rawls is
an Enlightenment thinker with

00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:34.940
all the zeal of a Jeremy
Bentham,

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:39.410
the mature Rawls really gives
up on the Enlightenment project.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.765
And, of course,
you then get into the

00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:47.798
question--he still thinks his
three principles would be

00:27:47.798 --> 00:27:49.009
affirmed.
 

00:27:49.009 --> 00:27:52.904
He thinks these three
principles are part of this

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:56.962
overlapping consensus,
but he has no way of knowing

00:27:56.962 --> 00:27:59.558
that that, in fact,
is true.

00:27:59.558 --> 00:28:03.955
It's just an assertion that
it's true and it's not

00:28:03.955 --> 00:28:06.019
necessarily the case.
 

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:10.672
So what I'm going to suggest to
you in later lectures is that

00:28:10.672 --> 00:28:15.788
Rawls actually retreats too far
from the Enlightenment project,

00:28:15.788 --> 00:28:19.675
and that there's a way of
thinking about the mature

00:28:19.675 --> 00:28:24.183
Enlightenment that's consistent
with a democratic political

00:28:24.183 --> 00:28:27.914
outlook that doesn't give up so
completely as the

00:28:27.914 --> 00:28:32.268
political-not-metaphysical view
does on the Enlightenment

00:28:32.268 --> 00:28:35.420
project,
but that's for the future.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.680
Let's first focus on the other
element of the Enlightenment.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.352
I said the one was this
commitment to science and we've

00:28:44.352 --> 00:28:48.364
seen how that played out now
from the seventeenth century to

00:28:48.364 --> 00:28:52.461
the late twentieth century,
and this affirmation,

00:28:52.461 --> 00:28:57.952
but this gradual retreat from
certainty that marked the march

00:28:57.952 --> 00:29:03.809
from the early Enlightenment
thinkers through Mill to Rawls,

00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:05.568
Sunstein and others.
 

00:29:05.568 --> 00:29:09.287
But now let's focus on the
idea, the normative idea of

00:29:09.287 --> 00:29:10.690
individual rights.
 

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:17.930
Remember we said that the
summum bonum,

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:23.650
the most important value of the
Enlightenment is this idea of

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:29.655
individual freedom recognized or
institutionalized by a doctrine

00:29:29.655 --> 00:29:32.038
of individual rights.
 

00:29:32.038 --> 00:29:34.788
The rights of the individual
are somehow sacrosanct.

00:29:34.788 --> 00:29:38.863
And we saw that in the early
Enlightenment,

00:29:38.863 --> 00:29:41.868
this had a theological basis.
 

00:29:41.868 --> 00:29:46.358
Remember I said to you that
Locke was tormented by the

00:29:46.358 --> 00:29:50.509
theological controversy between
the two sides,

00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:58.038
some of whom said God is
omnipotent,

00:29:58.038 --> 00:30:01.121
but if you said God is
omnipotent, that seemed to

00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:05.230
undermine the idea that the laws
of nature could be timeless,

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.994
because if God is omnipotent he
could decide to change them

00:30:08.994 --> 00:30:09.710
tomorrow.
 

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.585
So either God is omnipotent or
the laws of nature are timeless,

00:30:13.585 --> 00:30:16.210
but not both,
and he wrestled with that.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.721
If you go and read his essays
on the law of nature published

00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:22.578
in 1660 you see him really
tormenting himself.

00:30:22.578 --> 00:30:26.563
But at the end of his life he
comes down firmly on what we

00:30:26.563 --> 00:30:30.337
call the will-based theory,
the idea that something can't

00:30:30.337 --> 00:30:32.769
be a law unless it's a product
of a will.

00:30:32.769 --> 00:30:37.044
And so we'll go with the
omnipotence and let the

00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:42.137
omniscience fall by--and let the
universalism fall by the

00:30:42.137 --> 00:30:43.230
wayside.
 

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:49.836
And so that was the idea of God
owns his creation because he

00:30:49.836 --> 00:30:51.926
made it,
and God knows his creation

00:30:51.926 --> 00:30:55.189
because he made it,
and then the move Locke makes

00:30:55.189 --> 00:31:00.769
is that God gave us the capacity
to make things for ourselves.

00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:03.670
We become, as he called it,
miniature gods.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.151
That so long as we act within
the constraints of the law of

00:31:08.151 --> 00:31:12.709
nature we can behave in our
realm in a way that's an analogy

00:31:12.709 --> 00:31:15.798
of the way God behaves in his
realm.

00:31:15.798 --> 00:31:21.317
We could create things over
which we have maker's knowledge

00:31:21.317 --> 00:31:26.074
just as God created maker's
knowledge and rights of

00:31:26.074 --> 00:31:29.690
proprietorship over his
creation,

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:32.788
this idea that we're miniature
Gods.

00:31:32.788 --> 00:31:35.588
And then we saw what happened
to that idea.

00:31:35.588 --> 00:31:38.558
We called it the workmanship
model.

00:31:38.558 --> 00:31:44.317
We saw what happened to it over
the course of the next several

00:31:44.317 --> 00:31:45.450
centuries.
 

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:50.450
And particularly we saw that
beginning with Marx what you get

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.700
is an attempt to secularize the
workmanship idea.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.784
That is to say,
to cut it loose from its

00:31:57.784 --> 00:32:01.500
theological moorings,
but still affirm the basic

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.930
structure of the idea that
making confers ownership.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:12.041
And we saw that Marx's version
of that ran into trouble because

00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:18.352
he wanted to say only the worker
makes things when in fact we saw

00:32:18.352 --> 00:32:24.170
the capitalist also contributes
to the value of things.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:27.298
And then we looked at the
feminist critique of Marx which

00:32:27.298 --> 00:32:28.505
was,
"Well yes,

00:32:28.505 --> 00:32:31.714
and the stay-at-home spouse
contributes to the value of what

00:32:31.714 --> 00:32:34.433
the worker makes,"
and indeed even perhaps the

00:32:34.433 --> 00:32:37.480
Sunday school teacher who
drummed the work ethic into the

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.526
worker contributes to the value
of what the worker makes,

00:32:40.526 --> 00:32:41.558
and so on.
 

00:32:41.558 --> 00:32:45.604
So that if you have this idea
that making confers ownership

00:32:45.604 --> 00:32:49.160
you're going to get a
complicated web of overlapping

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.163
and indecipherable entitlements,
not any clean argument of the

00:32:54.163 --> 00:32:58.759
sort that Marx's theory of
exploitation aspired to be.

00:32:58.759 --> 00:33:04.566
And so we saw that if you look
at the Marxist tradition they

00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:08.108
eventually give up on all of
that.

00:33:08.108 --> 00:33:10.838
People like John Roemer,
and Jon Elster,

00:33:10.838 --> 00:33:13.980
and Jerry Cohen,
and instead just turn--

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.986
they give up on the idea of
workmanship and turn to

00:33:17.986 --> 00:33:19.910
arguments about power.
 

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:26.803
But most people wouldn't find
that entirely satisfying because

00:33:26.803 --> 00:33:30.644
most people do want,
at some level,

00:33:30.644 --> 00:33:34.940
to link what we get to what we
do.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.335
Even if the notion of
workmanship is problematic,

00:33:39.335 --> 00:33:43.730
most people don't want to give
it up entirely.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.118
And I think you see this very
dramatically with Rawls,

00:33:47.118 --> 00:33:53.625
because Rawls takes the idea of
workmanship apart in a

00:33:53.625 --> 00:33:59.640
hardheaded way that nobody
before him ever did.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:04.744
And this is the debate I was
referring to last Wednesday

00:34:04.744 --> 00:34:09.480
about nature and nurture and
moral arbitrariness.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.269
Just to remind you,
there's this huge debate.

00:34:12.269 --> 00:34:14.409
It's gone on for 150 years.
 

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:18.885
Are the differences between us
the result of nature or are they

00:34:18.885 --> 00:34:20.619
the result of nurture?
 

00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:23.070
And Rawls makes the point,
"You know what?

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.570
It doesn't matter.
 

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:28.574
It doesn't make any difference
because in either case these

00:34:28.574 --> 00:34:31.268
differences are morally
arbitrary,"

00:34:31.268 --> 00:34:31.960
right?
 

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.179
Remember this? Yeah.
 

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:38.871
So whether I'm a good athlete
because of my genes or whether

00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:43.007
I'm a good athlete because of
the way I was raised is

00:34:43.007 --> 00:34:44.199
immaterial.
 

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:48.815
I did nothing to have certain
genes or to be raised in a

00:34:48.815 --> 00:34:53.851
certain way, and I didn't even
make choices that led to those

00:34:53.851 --> 00:34:54.860
results.
 

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.289
So any benefits I get are
morally arbitrary.

00:34:58.289 --> 00:35:04.619
That was the notion that Rawls
brought to bear.

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:09.115
But then the question is,
"Well, why should anyone

00:35:09.115 --> 00:35:12.280
be entitled to what they
make?"

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.567
And Rawls is really pushed in
the direction of a kind of

00:35:16.567 --> 00:35:21.010
socialization of capacities
strategy, as I call it in that

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.349
piece that I had you read.
 

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:28.755
But it's very unsatisfying
because if I spent five years

00:35:28.755 --> 00:35:33.179
writing a book and you come
along and say,

00:35:33.179 --> 00:35:35.199
"Well, you're not entitled
to that book.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:38.943
You don't have any special
claim on the capacities,"

00:35:38.943 --> 00:35:40.949
I'm going to get really mad.
 

00:35:40.949 --> 00:35:41.860
"I worked really hard on
that.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.829
I want it. It's mine.
 

00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:46.340
Who are you to take it
away?"

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:51.481
So even if you can't give a
good philosophical defense of

00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:56.347
this workmanship ideal,
people are deeply unwilling to

00:35:56.347 --> 00:35:57.909
let go of it.
 

00:35:57.909 --> 00:36:02.050
Indeed, so is Rawls deeply
unwilling to let go of it.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.275
So Rawls, and we walked through
this on Wednesday but I'll just

00:36:05.275 --> 00:36:09.117
remind you of it again,
Rawls makes a distinction

00:36:09.117 --> 00:36:14.992
between the capacities that we
have and the use we choose to

00:36:14.992 --> 00:36:17.780
make of those capacities.
 

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:24.371
But that's not very--the notion
was so if we both have the same

00:36:24.371 --> 00:36:26.869
IQ,
but one of us chooses to work

00:36:26.869 --> 00:36:30.590
and the other chooses to sit on
the couch watching ESPN,

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:35.250
the one who works should get
more because they chose to work.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:39.190
And the person who sits on the
couch should get less because

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.860
they chose not to work.
 

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:46.070
But that doesn't really work
for Rawls because once you've

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:51.007
made the move into this land of
moral arbitrariness the

00:36:51.007 --> 00:36:56.583
differences in weakness of the
will are themselves distributed

00:36:56.583 --> 00:36:59.510
in morally arbitrary ways.
 

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:04.311
So perhaps the person who works
all day had the work ethic

00:37:04.311 --> 00:37:08.271
drummed into them a
mile-a-minute by some Sunday

00:37:08.271 --> 00:37:11.980
school teacher or very involved
parent,

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:16.166
whereas the one who winds up
sitting on the couch all day

00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:16.840
didn't.
 

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:22.059
Their father was off stoned all
day or something when they were

00:37:22.059 --> 00:37:25.849
supposed to be being taught the
work ethic.

00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:29.487
Well, if the capacities
themselves are morally arbitrary

00:37:29.487 --> 00:37:33.590
then the differences in the
capacity to use the capacities,

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.480
so you can get,
obviously, an infinite regress.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.914
So Rawls tries to kind of build
a moat around this implication

00:37:41.914 --> 00:37:44.750
of his argument,
but it doesn't work.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.909
And if we had time to talk
about other theorists in this

00:37:48.909 --> 00:37:51.860
tradition, you'd find the same
thing.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.920
I'll just mention the example
of Ronald Dworkin,

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.836
whom also like Rawls has a
resourcist view and also like

00:37:58.836 --> 00:38:02.610
Rawls sees that the differences
between us are morally

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.949
arbitrary,
which they are.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:08.300
And he says,
"Well, we should make a

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:13.159
distinction between what he
calls material resources people

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:17.684
have (which is sort of like
Rawlsian primary goods) and

00:38:17.684 --> 00:38:20.449
physical and mental powers.
 

00:38:20.449 --> 00:38:23.942
And we should treat the
differences in material

00:38:23.942 --> 00:38:28.269
resources as morally arbitrary,
but not the differences in

00:38:28.269 --> 00:38:31.079
physical and mental
powers."

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:33.572
But, again, you have to come
back and say,

00:38:33.572 --> 00:38:34.909
"Why not?"
 

00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:36.943
He says, "Well,
we couldn't redistribute

00:38:36.943 --> 00:38:38.929
them," but actually that's
not true.

00:38:38.929 --> 00:38:40.789
For instance,
think about blind people.

00:38:40.789 --> 00:38:43.800
You could have a system which
said,

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:48.402
"Well, if some people are
blind we have to compensate them

00:38:48.402 --> 00:38:52.561
for their blindness because they
have a morally arbitrary

00:38:52.561 --> 00:38:54.789
disadvantage,"
right?

00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:58.586
Or, indeed, if you really
wanted to be brutal about it,

00:38:58.586 --> 00:39:02.735
but it's nothing in the logic
of what Dworkin's saying rules

00:39:02.735 --> 00:39:05.403
it out;
we should just blind all the

00:39:05.403 --> 00:39:06.960
sighted people,
right?

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.030
Maybe the technology--we get
forcible eye transplants.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.434
It's not a path people are
going to want to go down,

00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:13.969
right?
 

00:39:13.969 --> 00:39:19.005
It's not a path people are
going to want to go down,

00:39:19.005 --> 00:39:22.760
but it's hard to see why not,
right?

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.652
It's hard to see why not once
you take this idea of moral

00:39:26.652 --> 00:39:28.460
arbitrariness seriously.
 

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.880
So two points to make about
that.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.289
 
 

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:35.750
We go back to the very
beginning.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.079
This was never a problem for
Locke, right?

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:41.987
And we should remember that
because, after all,

00:39:41.987 --> 00:39:45.590
all of this comes from Locke,
this workmanship model comes

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.539
from Locke.
 

00:39:46.539 --> 00:39:49.320
Why is it not a problem for
Locke?

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:54.358
Because for Locke,
if we have differences in

00:39:54.358 --> 00:40:00.219
capacities, it must have been
God's plan, right?

00:40:00.219 --> 00:40:05.530
Remember Locke's story is human
beings are God's creation.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:08.489
Human beings do not create
other human beings.

00:40:08.489 --> 00:40:11.583
He's very clear about this in
his discussion of parental

00:40:11.583 --> 00:40:12.090
rights.
 

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.891
We don't own our children in
the way that we own our property

00:40:15.891 --> 00:40:18.110
because we don't create
children.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:23.331
God creates children and he
implants in human beings the

00:40:23.331 --> 00:40:28.268
urge to reproduce,
but we don't fashion the child.

00:40:28.268 --> 00:40:31.588
We can't create a child in an
architectural sense,

00:40:31.588 --> 00:40:34.367
and most importantly,
of course for Locke,

00:40:34.367 --> 00:40:37.010
we don't put the soul in the
child.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.239
So God does all of that.
 

00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:42.030
So children are God's property
and parents are fiduciary.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.690
So we don't own our children.
 

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:46.840
So if it turns out that some of
us are smarter than others,

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.849
or some of us are more
hardworking than others,

00:40:48.849 --> 00:40:51.530
and some of us are better
athletes than others,

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:57.641
we don't have to--there's no
moral imperative for us to have

00:40:57.641 --> 00:41:02.822
some account of why those
differences exist because

00:41:02.822 --> 00:41:07.070
they're not products of human
action.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.820
They're products of the divine
choice.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.842
So in the Lockean story this
isn't a problem,

00:41:13.842 --> 00:41:18.507
but the minute you secularize
the workmanship ideal,

00:41:18.507 --> 00:41:20.518
this issue arises.
 

00:41:20.518 --> 00:41:26.865
Why is it that some people
should get more than others just

00:41:26.865 --> 00:41:32.010
because of morally arbitrary
characteristics?

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:41.719
And the ways in which people
who have gone down this path try

00:41:41.719 --> 00:41:49.650
to not get to the end of it
aren't very plausible,

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.268
right?
 

00:41:51.268 --> 00:41:52.659
I mentioned Rawls.
 

00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:54.280
I mentioned Dworkin.
 

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.746
We could have looked at some
others I talk about in that

00:41:57.746 --> 00:42:01.530
piece, Jerry Cohen being one of
them, but it doesn't work.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:06.253
So you're left with the fact
that if you embrace the

00:42:06.253 --> 00:42:11.438
socialization of capacity
strategy you're going to get to

00:42:11.438 --> 00:42:15.699
a place that very few of us want
to go to.

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:20.320
Now it's actually even worse
than that.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:27.641
It's even more problematic than
that because everything I've

00:42:27.641 --> 00:42:33.969
said to you so far presumes that
in the absence of a

00:42:33.969 --> 00:42:40.730
justification for inequality,
we should presume equality.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:43.934
After all, I said,
"Why should somebody get

00:42:43.934 --> 00:42:47.820
more just because they work
harder if the capacity to work

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.070
is itself morally
arbitrary,"

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:50.889
right?
 

00:42:50.889 --> 00:42:57.030
That presumes that there's some
assumption that other things

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:01.300
being equal we should all get
the same.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.960
But why assume that?
 

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.539
Why assume that?
 

00:43:08.539 --> 00:43:12.588
We could just say,
"Well, it's not a divine

00:43:12.588 --> 00:43:16.809
plan, so some people are lucky
and some people are

00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:18.360
unlucky."
 

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.840
There it is.
 

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.240
"Losses must lie where
they fall,"

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.420
as a famous American judge once
said.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.889
And gains should lie where they
fall.

00:43:26.889 --> 00:43:30.480
And so you could get Nietzsche.
 

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.871
We'll hear a little bit more
about Nietzsche when we read

00:43:33.871 --> 00:43:35.750
Alasdair MacIntyre next week.
 

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:41.293
You could get the view that the
strong win and it's just the way

00:43:41.293 --> 00:43:45.780
it is, and asking moral
questions about it is simply

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.099
irrelevant.
 

00:43:47.099 --> 00:43:50.679
Now Rawls thinks he has an
answer to that,

00:43:50.679 --> 00:43:55.123
which is what I started with at
the very beginning of the Rawls'

00:43:55.123 --> 00:43:58.148
lectures,
which was essentially--remember

00:43:58.148 --> 00:44:02.157
when we had the discussion of
what's the fair way to cut a

00:44:02.157 --> 00:44:02.719
cake.
 

00:44:02.719 --> 00:44:05.000
And one of you said,
"Well,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.018
the fair way to cut a cake is
to give the knife to the person

00:44:09.018 --> 00:44:13.239
who takes the last slice and
then he will divide it equally,

00:44:13.239 --> 00:44:17.715
or she will divide it equally,
presumption being the person

00:44:17.715 --> 00:44:21.190
wants to maximize the slice that
they get,

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.887
the residual slice,
and the way you do that is to

00:44:24.887 --> 00:44:26.429
divide it equally.
 

00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:33.498
But I made the point that
that's not really an argument

00:44:33.498 --> 00:44:36.380
for equality,
right?

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.219
That's not a moral argument for
equality.

00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:44.050
It's not a moral argument for
equality because it assumes what

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:48.960
we want to get is equality and
then you create the mechanism to

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.940
generate that result.
 

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.014
So if, for example,
we added more information and

00:44:55.014 --> 00:44:58.856
we said,
"Well, we know that the

00:44:58.856 --> 00:45:05.086
six people here waiting for the
slice of cake one of them has

00:45:05.086 --> 00:45:09.862
three cakes at home,
and one of them has nothing,

00:45:09.862 --> 00:45:12.880
and one of them is a
diabetic."

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:18.583
As soon as you introduce
information of that sort then

00:45:18.583 --> 00:45:24.719
it's not obvious where you want
to wind up is equality.

00:45:24.719 --> 00:45:28.137
And so saying to the person
with the knife,

00:45:28.137 --> 00:45:31.556
"You get the last
slice," becomes

00:45:31.556 --> 00:45:33.429
problematic, right?
 

00:45:33.429 --> 00:45:37.393
So all of this is only to make
the point that the cake-cutting

00:45:37.393 --> 00:45:41.619
example does not establish the
moral desirability of equality,

00:45:41.619 --> 00:45:44.126
on the contrary,
it assumes you've decided

00:45:44.126 --> 00:45:47.552
equality's where you want to end
up and then you create a

00:45:47.552 --> 00:45:49.510
mechanism that generates it.
 

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.391
And that's the structure of
what Rawls does in his theory of

00:45:52.391 --> 00:45:52.880
justice.
 

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.795
He assumes that his principles
are where we want to end up,

00:45:56.795 --> 00:46:00.442
and then he structures the
choice situation to generate

00:46:00.442 --> 00:46:01.050
them.
 

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.159
But it means if you favor
equality,

00:46:04.159 --> 00:46:07.211
or if you favor efficiency,
or if you favor some other

00:46:07.211 --> 00:46:11.456
basis for distribution,
you have to have an argument

00:46:11.456 --> 00:46:14.889
for it,
some other argument for it

00:46:14.889 --> 00:46:19.989
other than just that it gets
generated in this way.

00:46:19.989 --> 00:46:22.847
And to the extent Rawls has any
argument at all,

00:46:22.847 --> 00:46:24.610
it's this kind of prudence.
 

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.461
This, "there but for
fortune go I,"

00:46:26.461 --> 00:46:27.219
the grave risks.
 

00:46:27.219 --> 00:46:31.181
We better take care of the
person at the bottom because it

00:46:31.181 --> 00:46:32.989
might turn out to be me.
 

00:46:32.989 --> 00:46:36.980
But as we saw,
that assumes a view of risk

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:41.554
that some people find
irrationally conservative,

00:46:41.554 --> 00:46:47.199
and so we don't really have a
clear, clean-cut answer.

00:46:47.199 --> 00:46:53.173
And so we don't really have a
very satisfying evolution of the

00:46:53.173 --> 00:46:58.659
workmanship ideal from Locke
down through the present.

00:46:58.659 --> 00:47:00.309
It's a theological argument.
 

00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:04.719
In Locke's formulation it's got
this very nice coherent--

00:47:04.719 --> 00:47:07.838
it all fits together,
but the moment you try to

00:47:07.838 --> 00:47:11.838
secularize it you're left with
this problem that it leads in

00:47:11.838 --> 00:47:15.769
the directions people are not
going to want to go in,

00:47:15.769 --> 00:47:17.039
on the one hand.
 

00:47:17.039 --> 00:47:20.418
On the other hand they're not
going to want to get rid of it

00:47:20.418 --> 00:47:21.449
entirely either.
 

00:47:21.449 --> 00:47:26.387
And so the ways in which people
try and hedge in the parade of

00:47:26.387 --> 00:47:31.487
horribles doesn't entirely work
and we're left with this kind of

00:47:31.487 --> 00:47:36.507
nagging feeling that there's got
to be some way to salvage this

00:47:36.507 --> 00:47:42.079
workmanship idea,
but we haven't managed to do it.

00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:47.039
And so, just as the evolution
of science has taken us--

00:47:47.039 --> 00:47:51.309
or the evolution of the
commitment to science has taken

00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:55.657
us to a rather uncomfortable
endpoint when we get to the

00:47:55.657 --> 00:47:59.768
world of "political,
not metaphysical,"

00:47:59.768 --> 00:48:03.929
so the evolution of the
workmanship idea has taken us to

00:48:03.929 --> 00:48:08.619
a rather uncomfortable endpoint
once we get to Rawls's move and

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:13.007
his attempt to limit the radical
implications of it that he

00:48:13.007 --> 00:48:14.518
doesn't like.
 

00:48:14.518 --> 00:48:18.536
And so we will pick up that
story when we come to talk about

00:48:18.536 --> 00:48:22.349
the democratic tradition in the
last few lectures of this

00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:23.099
course.
 

00:48:23.099 --> 00:48:29.297
But before we get there we're
going to consider seriously the

00:48:29.297 --> 00:48:34.670
idea that maybe the whole
Enlightenment project was a

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:35.909
mistake.
 

00:48:35.909 --> 00:48:40.630
Maybe we should reject the
whole Enlightenment venture.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.469
This was, of course,
the view of Edmund Burke,

00:48:44.469 --> 00:48:47.800
the Irish political thinker
that we'll talk about on

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.827
Wednesday,
and it's a long tradition from

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:53.150
Burke down through the present.
 

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:57.538
We're going to look at Alasdair
MacIntyre as a contemporary

00:48:57.538 --> 00:49:01.862
defender of this view,
but this is the idea that we

00:49:01.862 --> 00:49:07.248
shouldn't be surprised that the
Enlightenment project turns out

00:49:07.248 --> 00:49:12.721
to be untenable because it was a
profound and indeed politically

00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:14.719
dangerous mistake.
 

00:49:14.719 --> 00:49:16.420
We'll start with that on
Wednesday.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:22.000

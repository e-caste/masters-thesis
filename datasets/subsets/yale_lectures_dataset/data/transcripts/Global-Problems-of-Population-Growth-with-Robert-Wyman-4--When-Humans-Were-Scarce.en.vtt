00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.935
Prof: As you may have
noticed, the course has been

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:10.170
proceeding somewhat
historically.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.712
First with pre-primate animals,
the whole evolution of sex from

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:19.700
things that swam in the ocean,
and then we discussed the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.710
primate mating system as you've
seen--

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.370
in the same sense as on the
board.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.607
The first--the pre-primate is a
few millions of years--I'm

00:00:32.607 --> 00:00:35.210
sorry, tens of millions of
years;

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.760
primates maybe ten million
years or so.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.459
Then last time we started
discussing the transition from

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:47.015
ape to human,
and evolutionarily modern

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:50.850
humans date to something like
150 thousand years ago.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.227
We're coming up to time and
today we're going to discuss

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:59.650
fully anatomically modern
humans.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.197
They have the same brain
capacity that we do,

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:04.890
etcetera, etcetera.
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.706
The earliest groups that we
have any kind of decent

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:13.209
demographic data on are hunter
gatherers which would include

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:17.714
cavemen and people that are
hunter gatherers but do not live

00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:18.860
in caves.
 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.322
Last time we asked why there
were so few chimps and so many

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:29.692
humans and today we're going to
ask very similar questions

00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:31.602
about--
we're going to start with,

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:32.709
we're going to cover a lot
more;

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.134
we're going to ask very similar
questions about hunter

00:01:36.134 --> 00:01:36.910
gatherers.
 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.170
There never was a great density
of hunter gatherers.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.910
There is certainly not now and
the question is,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.790
why?
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.540
If you look where hunter
gatherers live now they--

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.232
each small group,
and the again the small group

00:01:53.232 --> 00:01:56.920
is the same size we've been
talking about something like 40,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.284
are spread out over a very
large area and they use that

00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:03.400
area to hunt in and to collect
fruits and nuts,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.269
and whatever they can get from
the trees.

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:11.972
It looks like a very simple
question, why is the density of

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:14.080
hunter gatherers so low?
 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.658
Why are there so few of them?
 

00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:19.288
For a long time,
the answer was:

00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:21.750
they didn't have much food.
 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.008
That they needed all this space
to get enough food to survive,

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:34.270
and if they overpopulated that
space they couldn't survive.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.026
In sort of modern hubris,
we looked back and thought

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:41.634
hunter gatherer is a very
inefficient form of food

00:02:41.634 --> 00:02:45.389
gathering,
not modern, and we're so much

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.400
better than them now.
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:58.848
The data is quite clear on some
part of those assumptions;

00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:02.060
hunter gatherers,
at the time when all human

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.346
beings were in the stage of
hunter gatherers,

00:03:05.346 --> 00:03:09.080
before--farming starts about
10,000 years ago.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.479
There's--what is the number
here?

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.455
There may have been like two
million people on the whole

00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:19.889
earth.
 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.060
Remember I said hunter
gatherers spread out of Africa,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.740
spread amazingly over the whole
earth,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.776
and maybe the total population
of humans at that time was

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:30.729
something like two million
people.

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:36.407
Now we have over six billion
people, that's an increase of

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:41.586
3,000 times in the human
population, so clearly there

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:45.669
were fewer hunter gatherers than
now.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.529
This is a very--you'll see this
in lots of discussions of this

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.061
field, but it's a very
elementary kind of

00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:53.199
consideration.
 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.900
It talks about the long scale
of human demography,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.783
of human population growth,
and we came out of being other

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:06.349
species of primate,
of hominids and we gradually

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.508
grew up to some sort of a limit.
 

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:14.185
There's the idea that the
various productive systems that

00:04:14.185 --> 00:04:17.641
we use,
like hunter gathering--limit is

00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:21.110
some sort of a carrying capacity
limit,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.867
and so the idea is that the
human population increased until

00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:28.690
it reached a limit and then for
a very long period of time it

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.730
can't get beyond that limit.
 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.720
Then 10,000 years ago,
maybe it's 12,000,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.894
farming is invented and all of
a sudden the whole system

00:04:38.894 --> 00:04:41.579
changes,
there's many more people and we

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:44.160
jump up and then again reach a
limit,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.084
and we'll talk about that as
some Malthusian limit in this

00:04:48.084 --> 00:04:51.569
particular period,
later we'll discuss that,

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.894
and then around here the
industrial revolution happens

00:04:55.894 --> 00:05:00.300
and all of a sudden the
population increases again.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.480
This is a logarithmic scale so
it's not linear.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.500
Each of these jumps is by a
factor of several thousand.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.357
That's a very,
very schematized version of

00:05:10.357 --> 00:05:16.379
human demographic history and
we're talking about this period.

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.406
What limited hunter gatherers
to this level whereas farmers

00:05:20.406 --> 00:05:22.350
could go up to this level.
 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.252
Again, the obvious answer and
looking at this kind of rough

00:05:28.252 --> 00:05:31.000
data is that it was food.
 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.088
Whoever then--archeologists,
paleontologists go and actually

00:05:35.088 --> 00:05:39.105
try to examine this and there
turns out to be the data does

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:41.740
not fit that theory terribly
well.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.310
What do archeologists do?
 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.136
They dig up skeletons and they
have a good representative set

00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:55.574
of skeletons from the last 7,000
years in North and South

00:05:55.574 --> 00:05:56.740
America.
 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.901
One study looked at more than
12,500 skeletons so we're

00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:05.819
talking about a good scientific
sample.

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:06.980
What did they find out?
 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.836
These were set into
communities, and communities

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:14.529
lasted so much time,
so you can date the whole

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.060
archeological site to a certain
period.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.392
The medical anthropologists got
into it and started looking at

00:06:21.392 --> 00:06:23.579
the bones and dentition and all
this,

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:25.947
and not only did they find the
violence we talked about last

00:06:25.947 --> 00:06:28.410
time,
but these people were also sick.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.069
They had diseases at different
times.

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:33.874
You could see bone problems and
how well the bones grew and from

00:06:33.874 --> 00:06:36.190
the teeth how much calcium they
had, and all this.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.365
What does it turn out,
that contrary to the idea of

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:43.430
progress that you'd think the
later people were more healthy,

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.529
in fact, it was earlier people
in the--

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:50.750
the earlier individuals that
were healthier.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.105
As time goes on,
the skeletons get less and less

00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:58.245
healthy, that they're getting
less food and less good food,

00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:00.959
and were more subject to
diseases.

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:05.540
It was quite a shocker when
this status started coming out.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.846
The researchers attributed this
decline in health in large part

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:13.329
to the rise in agriculture.
 

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:16.973
Two main factors they say,
the rise of agriculture and the

00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:20.233
rise of urban living,
and we'll talk about the urban

00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:21.639
story in a moment.
 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.423
If you again go like we did
last time from the archeology to

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:29.079
the anthropology and look at
current hunter gatherers,

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:33.053
it's a little bit of a
distorted study because nowadays

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:37.396
almost all hunter gatherers have
been pushed out of the good

00:07:37.396 --> 00:07:42.319
lands that they used to live in,
into very marginal lands.

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:45.134
You know this from
U.S. History in high school,

00:07:45.134 --> 00:07:48.682
how the European farmers pushed
the very earlier farmers or

00:07:48.682 --> 00:07:51.620
hunter gatherers of the American
Indians,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.740
the Native Americans into
Arizona, into desert,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.218
into the Badlands in the West,
the dry Badlands and to the

00:07:58.218 --> 00:08:02.374
West of the U.S.,
farming peoples push hunter

00:08:02.374 --> 00:08:06.069
gatherers into inhospitable
land.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:11.898
There's a story in the
Smithsonian Magazine recently

00:08:11.898 --> 00:08:14.870
about Pygmies in Africa.
 

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.947
I don't know if you know a
little bit about the history of

00:08:16.947 --> 00:08:19.540
African demography,
which we'll also cover,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.810
but the Bantus have expanded
from south--

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.435
the bulge of southwest Africa
basically all around and have

00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:29.875
pushed other people's out and
the Pygmies are one of the

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:33.375
groups that have been very
severely discriminated against

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:36.440
and really pushed into
inhospitable places.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.293
Another example is the Bushmen
of Africa who were pushed into

00:08:41.293 --> 00:08:44.610
the Kalahari Desert in southern
Africa.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.250
Even in the desert these guys
eat 85 different species of

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.121
plants,
and it's almost inconceivable

00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.798
in their culture,
for someone to die of

00:08:54.798 --> 00:08:59.023
starvation because plants will
bloom some years and not bloom

00:08:59.023 --> 00:09:00.149
some years.
 

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:03.076
They will get a fungus some
year, or a virus,

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:06.870
plants--any one species is not
generally very reliable.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.889
When you have 85 different
species to survive on you're not

00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:12.759
going to go without food.
 

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:17.462
There will always be some group
of plants that are going to be

00:09:17.462 --> 00:09:21.548
available to you and so you're
not going to starve.

00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:24.924
Further, the anthropologists
lived with these people and they

00:09:24.924 --> 00:09:28.470
start writing down what they're
doing at every point in time.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.085
Per hour invested,
the Bushmen get more food then

00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:34.269
the early agriculturalists.
 

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:39.633
Not modern agriculturalists who
can drive a tractor and in an

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:42.582
hour do a lot,
but we're comparing

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:47.590
hunter-gatherers to the first
stages of agriculture.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.350
The Kalahari--the Bushmen in
Kalahari spent 12 to 19 hours a

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.191
week collecting food and the
rest of the time they used for a

00:09:57.191 --> 00:10:00.500
lot more sleep than current
farmers,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.000
and a lot more leisure than
farming people,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.908
so life is more generous to
them.

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:11.062
You have to think now,
this is for people pushed into

00:10:11.062 --> 00:10:13.244
a desert,
a very inhospitable place,

00:10:13.244 --> 00:10:16.828
and now if they--
if you can imagine them living

00:10:16.828 --> 00:10:20.700
in a lush forest region where
they originated,

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.179
life must have been much,
much easier so the amount of

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:30.506
time exerted to get your basics
of food and everything must have

00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:32.788
been much-- a lot less.
 

00:10:32.788 --> 00:10:38.172
Not only do they have to work
less and they get more food per

00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:40.879
hour,
but the variety of foods is

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:45.009
very good for you because you
need different minerals,

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:46.690
you need different other
micronutrients,

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:51.519
you need different vitamins,
and as we are bombarded with in

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:55.982
the popular press,
a variety of foods is very good

00:10:55.982 --> 00:10:56.779
for you.
 

00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:00.450
You don't want to eat just one
kind of food,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.058
so they had a very diverse and
healthy kind of diet.

00:11:05.058 --> 00:11:09.716
Agriculture comes in and indeed
it enormously increases the

00:11:09.716 --> 00:11:13.570
amount of food per acre when
land is limited,

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.265
when you have a population
density such that land becomes

00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:18.528
limiting rather than your time
or your need,

00:11:18.528 --> 00:11:22.461
when land becomes limiting then
agriculture becomes important

00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:26.066
because per acre you can get a
lot more food than hunter

00:11:26.066 --> 00:11:29.398
gathering,
but you have to spend lots and

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:34.408
lots of hours to get that land
to give you that amount of food.

00:11:34.408 --> 00:11:39.846
The question remains 'why are
there are--why were there and

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:44.626
still are of course,
why are there are so few hunter

00:11:44.626 --> 00:11:45.940
gatherers?
 

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.428
Again, a Malthusian type
question that,

00:11:49.428 --> 00:11:52.351
if we know they lived quite
well, we know that later people

00:11:52.351 --> 00:11:55.475
going into agriculture lived a
lot less well in terms of basics

00:11:55.475 --> 00:11:58.366
of life,
how come the hunter gatherer

00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:03.160
population did not increase up
to the same level of misery as

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.745
early farmers,
which is basically one of the

00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:10.370
earliest examples of a
Malthusian type question.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.070
Malthus thought those same kind
of thoughts but for a much later

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.038
population.
 

00:12:16.038 --> 00:12:20.102
Well in truth,
we don't really know the answer

00:12:20.102 --> 00:12:25.611
to this and it's greatly argued
about, but I can tell you some

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:27.960
things that are known.
 

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.856
Current hunter gatherers have a
moderate number of children and

00:12:31.856 --> 00:12:32.798
many survive.
 

00:12:32.798 --> 00:12:35.586
They do not have an enormous
infant mortality,

00:12:35.586 --> 00:12:39.426
certainly not compared to later
populations which I'll show you

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.779
that have a huge infant
mortality.

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:44.402
If they are Nomadic,
and I'll tell you about an

00:12:44.402 --> 00:12:47.311
example of that later,
they have to move quite a lot

00:12:47.311 --> 00:12:49.820
and that means carrying children
around.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.000
I think Bonnie has sort of
indicated to you,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.428
even dealing with a lot of
children in one place is

00:12:54.428 --> 00:12:57.605
difficult,
but the difficulty of moving

00:12:57.605 --> 00:13:01.110
with very young children,
and packing up everything and

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.989
moving for a very long time,
over a long distance is

00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:08.735
difficult and Nomadic peoples
very often show very clear signs

00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:12.470
of some form of conscious
population control.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.799
They know they can't cope with
more than "x"

00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:17.120
number of children.
 

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.697
We'll get to that all societies
have indeed controlled their

00:13:20.697 --> 00:13:23.730
population but mechanism they
were not totally--

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.245
not clear what they think the
reason for their doing things

00:13:27.245 --> 00:13:29.374
were,
but Nomads apparently know what

00:13:29.374 --> 00:13:30.168
they're doing.
 

00:13:30.168 --> 00:13:33.269
Hunter gatherers are moderately
healthy.

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:36.701
Again, their burden of sickness
is not severe,

00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:39.600
again compared to later
populations;

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.120
however parasites are always a
problem.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.070
I'll show you again a modern
case of parasites.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.613
This is a girl,
modern girl,

00:13:48.613 --> 00:13:51.700
current girl in Central
America, and you may notice the

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.730
swollen belly.
 

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:58.918
You know what's inside there to
swell it?

00:13:58.918 --> 00:14:04.758
Worms--exactly and when they
purge her that was what was

00:14:04.758 --> 00:14:08.580
inside that girl,
all those worms.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:13.080
Humans have had this problem
since time in memorial.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.639
Hunter gatherers are not immune
to this.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:20.580
Infectious diseases they have
less because they're in small

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.023
groups,
so infectious diseases as you

00:14:23.023 --> 00:14:26.793
know need large groups to keep
spreading and they're hostile to

00:14:26.793 --> 00:14:29.212
their neighbors,
just again like chimpanzees so

00:14:29.212 --> 00:14:31.340
they don't come in a lot of
contact with neighbors,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.014
so diseases don't spread from
group to group and each

00:14:35.014 --> 00:14:38.690
individual group is not large
enough to allow for the

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.740
maintenance of a disease.
 

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.986
Each village,
if you--anthropologists go and

00:14:44.986 --> 00:14:50.322
sit in one village for a long
time and they have a high

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:52.990
population growth rate.
 

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.279
Each village seems to be
expanding quite noticeably,

00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:58.847
and you think,
well in each village that we go

00:14:58.847 --> 00:15:02.744
study population is increasing,
again, it doesn't make sense

00:15:02.744 --> 00:15:06.316
why haven't they--
been living that way a hundred

00:15:06.316 --> 00:15:08.842
thousand years,
why haven't they filled up

00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:09.470
their space?
 

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:14.066
Why is each village surrounded
by lots of--basically unused

00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:14.700
space?
 

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.322
Even today, a lot of the very
tropical lands are not

00:15:18.322 --> 00:15:20.168
high--densely populated.
 

00:15:20.168 --> 00:15:23.210
We may have the image that they
are but they're not.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.230
New Guinea is not densely
populated.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.836
If you call densely
populated--the Netherlands is I

00:15:27.836 --> 00:15:30.389
think the most densely populated
in the world,

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:33.048
Bangladesh, the livable regions
of China,

00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:36.879
the livable regions of Japan,
these are densely populated.

00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:43.769
The tropical regions of the
world, nothing like that;

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:46.970
New Guinea I said,
Borneo very sparsely populated,

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.700
the Amazon, Sub-Saharan Africa
vast open areas,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.779
so these are not situations of
high population density,

00:15:55.779 --> 00:16:01.460
yet any village that you sit in
is increasing its population.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.720
What's going on?
 

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.196
What are the--what the
archeologists find out is that

00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:11.605
when they study a site,
and I sort of mentioned this

00:16:11.605 --> 00:16:13.879
already, what you see is this.
 

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:19.125
You go to--you start digging a
site and you actually dig in

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.912
reserve,
but you go to the bottom and

00:16:21.912 --> 00:16:25.370
you see there was nobody there
before certain years,

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.720
and then a small population,
and what you see,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.220
you can count the amount of
food remains,

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.364
all kinds of things,
the population grows more or

00:16:33.364 --> 00:16:34.740
less exponentially.
 

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.019
That means that the same
percentage every year.

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:39.639
A half of a percent a year or
whatever it is,

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:43.171
and it grows up faster and
faster, because there are more

00:16:43.171 --> 00:16:46.830
people producing that same
percent of population growth.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:50.095
You get this phase and then all
of a sudden you reach the top of

00:16:50.095 --> 00:16:53.360
your pile and your village is
gone and there's nothing there.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.803
Some sort of a crash happened,
where if it's not totally gone

00:16:57.803 --> 00:17:00.840
it's really knocked down
tremendously,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.634
and then you either wait--look
at that site again like the

00:17:04.634 --> 00:17:08.561
biblical sites which they dig,
and dig, and dig and sometime

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:12.384
later starts up again,
or a different site starts up

00:17:12.384 --> 00:17:15.108
again and you get the same
phenomenon.

00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:17.528
Forget this line,
this is the idea of -- the

00:17:17.528 --> 00:17:20.116
carrying capacity,
but you can see nothing fits

00:17:20.116 --> 00:17:21.578
the carrying capacity.
 

00:17:21.578 --> 00:17:25.199
It just maybe stays there for a
little here, so the idea of

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:28.568
carrying capacity for humans
doesn't work very well.

00:17:28.568 --> 00:17:33.038
What are the reasons--so--then
the explanation for the

00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:38.265
population staying more or less
constant and not filling up the

00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:42.650
space is not that each community
doesn't exist,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.964
but communities--here's your
space filled with community A,

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.936
B, C, D, E and as each
community increases some other

00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:51.490
community just disappears,
goes out of existence.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.226
If you measure over the whole
big space you have a floating

00:17:55.226 --> 00:17:58.190
game of different communities
each growing,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.299
but then disappearing
completely, and the population

00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:04.348
and the whole space stays more
or less the same.

00:18:04.348 --> 00:18:07.255
I don't want to push that as it
really becomes super duper

00:18:07.255 --> 00:18:10.108
constant, but more or less the
same--does not fill up.

00:18:10.108 --> 00:18:13.648
What are the reasons why a
community would grow very

00:18:13.648 --> 00:18:16.077
happily, more or less,
very vaguely,

00:18:16.077 --> 00:18:19.410
exponentially,
and then go out of existence?

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.759
One is of course climatic
disaster.

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:26.704
There could be a freeze;
there could be a drought,

00:18:26.704 --> 00:18:31.645
these real climatic things,
and if you look at the Anasazi

00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:37.368
of Arizona that lived near the
Colorado River regions,

00:18:37.368 --> 00:18:39.782
one of the thoughts--they're
one of the communities that fit

00:18:39.782 --> 00:18:40.068
this.
 

00:18:40.068 --> 00:18:41.987
They're healthy,
you go see their ruins,

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.608
and then they just disappeared.
 

00:18:43.608 --> 00:18:47.038
How many of you have been to
Anazasi site in Arizona?

00:18:47.038 --> 00:18:51.900
Just one student,
something you've got to do.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.386
There you're living in a
semi--a true desert now and a

00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:58.413
semi-desert back then,
so climatic things are a

00:18:58.413 --> 00:19:00.190
reasonable explanation.
 

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.015
You go into the tropical
regions you don't have droughts

00:19:04.015 --> 00:19:07.771
that last, you don't have
freezes, and yet you see this

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.720
same kind of phenomenon.
 

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.557
While undoubtedly climatic
things happened occasionally in

00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:18.193
the temperate zones,
certainly in the northern

00:19:18.193 --> 00:19:21.969
zones, most hunter gatherer
societies probably that's not

00:19:21.969 --> 00:19:23.250
the explanation.
 

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.151
The next thing is diseases of
the crops, that some fungus came

00:19:27.151 --> 00:19:29.068
by and wiped out your crops.
 

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:32.756
Well we've just talked about
that, that since they're eating

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.630
85 different kinds of things in
the desert,

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.625
there isn't any kind of
microorganism that cuts across

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:44.705
species like that,
so that explanation doesn't

00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:46.519
seem to work.
 

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.196
Diseases of humans,
same thing, not diseases of

00:19:49.196 --> 00:19:51.499
plants,
but diseases of humans,

00:19:51.499 --> 00:19:54.490
again, the data just doesn't
fit that,

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:59.115
that because of the isolation
they don't have a huge problem

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.390
with communicable diseases.
 

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.943
That leaves the possibility of
violent confrontation from one

00:20:05.943 --> 00:20:07.690
community to another.
 

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.234
We've seen in the chimps how
the northern group will

00:20:11.234 --> 00:20:14.990
completely wipe out the southern
group and so forth.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.124
What kind of evidence can one
adduce that this might be what's

00:20:19.124 --> 00:20:19.868
going on?
 

00:20:19.868 --> 00:20:25.726
If one looks at any modern
population and looks at the

00:20:25.726 --> 00:20:30.807
survival curve,
so this is the number of deaths

00:20:30.807 --> 00:20:33.348
per 1,000 per year.
 

00:20:33.348 --> 00:20:35.487
This is India,
for instance,

00:20:35.487 --> 00:20:38.019
and it's fairly recent--1960s.
 

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:41.440
Antibiotics are just coming in
at this stage,

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.558
so very high infant mortality
rate,

00:20:44.558 --> 00:20:48.952
80 per 1,000--one out of every
12 kids dies almost immediately

00:20:48.952 --> 00:20:52.480
and then that high rate
continues until about--

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.635
comes down to something about
six or seven years old so a lot

00:20:56.635 --> 00:21:00.170
of your population is just wiped
out immediately.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:05.016
Then you have a pretty low
level of death and fairly flat

00:21:05.016 --> 00:21:09.949
until it gets to be what's
considered old age in different

00:21:09.949 --> 00:21:13.930
populations and then the death
rate rises.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.328
You have this very standard
u-shaped curve,

00:21:16.328 --> 00:21:19.028
and here after you have sort of
modern medicine--

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:21.240
this is Sweden in the same year
as the infant--

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.413
primarily the main thing is the
infant mortality drops like

00:21:24.413 --> 00:21:28.318
crazy and the old age stuff--
everything drops but the main

00:21:28.318 --> 00:21:30.528
drop is in infant mortality.
 

00:21:30.528 --> 00:21:32.788
The idea is--what I just want
you to get out of this--

00:21:32.788 --> 00:21:36.660
we'll see this graph again and
again in a couple of times,

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.449
is that during the adult years
the death rate is very low

00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:42.750
compared to either here or here.
 

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:48.901
Now if you look at what we can
gather from archeological data

00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:53.821
from hunter gatherer
communities, you have a high

00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:56.180
death rate of kids.
 

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.371
Not as high as when you get all
these communicable diseases in

00:21:58.371 --> 00:22:00.414
modern societies,
and then you have a flat

00:22:00.414 --> 00:22:03.509
period, and then all of a sudden
there's this big bump.

00:22:03.509 --> 00:22:07.470
What they call an excess
mortality in exactly the young

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.007
adult years,
and then it comes back down

00:22:10.007 --> 00:22:13.150
again and you get a more or less
normal old age situation.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.849
Well what is it that kills
people in their middle years?

00:22:16.849 --> 00:22:19.240
Violence.
 

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.470
So this kind of data--again we
don't totally--

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.384
we don't really know the
answer, but this kind of data

00:22:25.384 --> 00:22:28.740
leads you to suspect that indeed
one of the major reasons,

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.527
not the only reason,
but a major reason that the

00:22:32.527 --> 00:22:36.877
hunter gatherer communities and
the early archeological

00:22:36.877 --> 00:22:41.308
communities disappear so
suddenly is that they are wiped

00:22:41.308 --> 00:22:44.130
out by some sort of violence.
 

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:49.904
We're right back in hunter
gatherer times as far as we can

00:22:49.904 --> 00:22:54.868
tell to what you've seen before
of these mass--

00:22:54.868 --> 00:22:59.895
I've showed you last time these
mass graves that are

00:22:59.895 --> 00:23:03.048
characteristic of this period.
 

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:06.711
Okay, nevertheless,
over the very long scale of

00:23:06.711 --> 00:23:09.057
time--
our period of being cavemen and

00:23:09.057 --> 00:23:12.200
hunter gatherers lasted hundreds
of thousands of years--

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.068
but gradually population did
slowly increase,

00:23:16.068 --> 00:23:20.367
and as population increases,
the land available to people

00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:21.288
gets less.
 

00:23:21.288 --> 00:23:23.920
We talk, I think next time
about Africa,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.383
which has a culture where land
is not a scarce commodity and

00:23:27.383 --> 00:23:30.722
now it's getting to be scarce,
but in their traditions,

00:23:30.722 --> 00:23:32.769
land is not the scarce
commodity,

00:23:32.769 --> 00:23:37.645
but as the population grows the
land per person gets less and

00:23:37.645 --> 00:23:42.441
then you have to make a more
intense utilization of the land

00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:44.880
and farming gets invented.
 

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.069
A big discussion whether it
actually was the population

00:23:48.069 --> 00:23:51.732
pressure that caused farming to
be invented or whether that was

00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:55.160
just some brilliant stroke by
somebody that invented--

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.519
that people slowly figured it
out.

00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:04.150
They actually can trace the
origin of agriculture to--

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.519
the current data is 11,700
years ago in the Middle East,

00:24:07.519 --> 00:24:10.772
in Anatolia,
what's now Turkey,

00:24:10.772 --> 00:24:14.909
now eastern Turkey,
and it expands on the average

00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:18.589
from the original sites you can
watch it expand and it expands

00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:20.220
at one kilometer a year.
 

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.390
That's the average.
 

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.269
Then it eventually takes over
the whole world.

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:27.570
The number of people,
and when you invent

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.851
agriculture, the number of
people that can be supported on

00:24:30.851 --> 00:24:33.210
one plot of land grows up
enormously.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.556
We've seen that and so these
people become more numerous and

00:24:36.556 --> 00:24:39.960
so in military confrontations
and warlike confrontations,

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.150
they're going to be dominant,
almost no matter what the

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.921
technology is,
no matter what the bravery is,

00:24:44.921 --> 00:24:49.083
if you have an awful lot more
people you're going to wipe out

00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:53.038
or push out groups that don't
have that kind of population

00:24:53.038 --> 00:24:53.940
density.
 

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.442
Agriculture spreads;
in the early days of

00:24:57.442 --> 00:25:02.612
agriculture you don't know an
awful lot yet and you probably

00:25:02.612 --> 00:25:07.078
have one crop that you really
know how to grow.

00:25:07.078 --> 00:25:08.864
For instance,
in the Americas,

00:25:08.864 --> 00:25:12.555
the big crop was corn that most
of Latin America even to this

00:25:12.555 --> 00:25:16.317
day lives on corn,
and the North American Indians

00:25:16.317 --> 00:25:17.960
lived a lot on corn.
 

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.740
Of course in Southeast Asia a
great big population,

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.939
it was rice,
and you basically lived off

00:25:22.939 --> 00:25:27.215
most of your calories,
most of your food from one

00:25:27.215 --> 00:25:28.650
single crop.
 

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:33.328
That's not very healthy because
each crop is missing something.

00:25:33.328 --> 00:25:36.248
Corn, you may know,
misses lysine,

00:25:36.248 --> 00:25:41.465
one of these essential amino
acids and over a very long time

00:25:41.465 --> 00:25:46.519
the Americans learned to--
a rather complicated procedure

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:51.078
for boiling it in lime to
extract this amino acid from the

00:25:51.078 --> 00:25:53.644
plant,
but until that was discovered

00:25:53.644 --> 00:25:56.140
they must have been extremely
unhealthy.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.970
Rice, you know,
is missing all kinds of

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.365
vitamins and people have very
severe vitamin deficiencies if

00:26:03.365 --> 00:26:05.750
their diet is too much rice.
 

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.362
You're not getting a health--in
early farming you're not getting

00:26:10.362 --> 00:26:14.901
a particularly healthy diet and
you're not getting the vitamins

00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:17.608
and micronutrients that you
need.

00:26:17.608 --> 00:26:19.838
Furthermore,
your food security goes down.

00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:23.078
Again, as I've mentioned,
that a virus or a fungus,

00:26:23.078 --> 00:26:26.388
or something attacks your
crops, and that's 80% of your

00:26:26.388 --> 00:26:29.759
calories and that is wiped out
in a year you're gone.

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:34.750
Or if locusts come by and eat
them up or some insect

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.490
infestation comes through.
 

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:44.848
Also an increase in calorie
availability;

00:26:44.848 --> 00:26:49.695
you can--more people can stay
alive and so you get dense

00:26:49.695 --> 00:26:50.930
populations.
 

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.807
The social structure changes,
now previously each person

00:26:54.807 --> 00:26:58.827
could only get enough food
basically for himself and maybe

00:26:58.827 --> 00:27:00.519
a very small family.
 

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:03.221
As you develop the technology
of agriculture,

00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:06.474
an individual can produce a
surplus, not everything he

00:27:06.474 --> 00:27:07.088
feeds.
 

00:27:07.088 --> 00:27:09.338
Well who's going to get that
surplus?

00:27:09.338 --> 00:27:13.573
In an egalitarian society he
keeps the surplus himself,

00:27:13.573 --> 00:27:15.690
his family, and so forth.
 

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.284
But there's other guys that are
either stronger and nastier then

00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:22.480
you and they come in and steal
your surplus from you,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.813
and they have to leave you just
with a small part of your

00:27:24.813 --> 00:27:27.188
production to just keep you
alive because they want you to

00:27:27.188 --> 00:27:30.410
work for them,
and so you get societies now

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.578
where there are classes.
 

00:27:32.578 --> 00:27:36.077
There are people who in way or
another take the excess food

00:27:36.077 --> 00:27:38.789
from the farmer and use it for
other purposes,

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:40.660
usually their own purposes.
 

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.750
They can largely hire military
to keep them in power and to

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.078
protect them from other places.
 

00:27:47.078 --> 00:27:51.123
That's a large use of the food
surplus which agriculture puts

00:27:51.123 --> 00:27:51.460
up.
 

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.608
Also manufacturers come in;
they hire artisans to make

00:27:55.608 --> 00:27:59.338
beautiful gold objects for them,
or to make beds,

00:27:59.338 --> 00:28:03.038
or chairs or all the
manufacturing starts on the

00:28:03.038 --> 00:28:07.522
agricultural surplus that
agriculture brings in because an

00:28:07.522 --> 00:28:12.403
individual human now can produce
more calories than he needs to

00:28:12.403 --> 00:28:15.630
keep going at a subsistence
level.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.718
What you see as agriculture
progresses is the hunter

00:28:18.718 --> 00:28:22.108
gatherer societies are generally
quite an egalitarian.

00:28:22.108 --> 00:28:24.876
They'll more or less have a
head man but he won't--or a wise

00:28:24.876 --> 00:28:27.269
man or an old man,
but they won't have authority.

00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:29.298
He can't order other people
around;

00:28:29.298 --> 00:28:33.123
the community has to agree on
some project if they undertake

00:28:33.123 --> 00:28:34.288
projects at all.
 

00:28:34.288 --> 00:28:38.660
As more food wealth becomes
available,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:44.480
societies start stratifying,
you get social classes,

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.446
you get castes,
and this inequality changes

00:28:49.446 --> 00:28:54.058
everything about the way humans
live.

00:28:54.058 --> 00:28:57.265
The congestion in the
cities--cities start growing up

00:28:57.265 --> 00:29:00.717
and then you start getting the
spread of these infectious

00:29:00.717 --> 00:29:04.169
diseases where one person
spreads it to the next in large

00:29:04.169 --> 00:29:06.078
agglomerations of humans.
 

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:10.273
That just gets worse and worse
up through the 1400s in Europe

00:29:10.273 --> 00:29:14.400
when you get the Black Death and
wipes out a huge number.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.287
That is--as civilization
progresses the death rate from

00:29:19.287 --> 00:29:23.358
infectious diseases just keeps
going on up.

00:29:23.358 --> 00:29:27.512
Adding all this together and
the data we have,

00:29:27.512 --> 00:29:33.420
is that hunter gatherers--their
lifespan is ballpark 50 years.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.328
In early agriculture societies
that goes down to 35 years,

00:29:38.328 --> 00:29:43.965
so we're really--and I'll show
you data that in a lot of places

00:29:43.965 --> 00:29:47.328
it's probably even lower than
that.

00:29:47.328 --> 00:29:51.240
We have this situation where
humans--

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.808
not counting violence that
humans live--

00:29:53.808 --> 00:29:55.710
when they weren't being
attacked by their neighbors,

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.049
humans were living very well,
the hunter gatherer society;

00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:00.868
sort of Garden of Eden.
 

00:30:00.868 --> 00:30:04.140
Then agriculture comes in and
the vast mass of humans become

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.505
peasants;
the land becomes owned not by

00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:09.749
them but by someone else,
and they have to give most of

00:30:09.749 --> 00:30:11.970
what they've produced to someone
else,

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.858
so life becomes miserable.
 

00:30:13.858 --> 00:30:17.798
There's a lot of thought that
the various of Garden of Eden

00:30:17.798 --> 00:30:20.413
myths--
I mean almost every culture has

00:30:20.413 --> 00:30:24.359
some sort of glorification of a
very distant past where people

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:26.430
did not have to work so hard.
 

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.798
In our culture we call it the
Garden of Eden;

00:30:28.798 --> 00:30:31.688
everything was perfect,
then something happened,

00:30:31.688 --> 00:30:35.375
and after the fall of one sort
or another, now it's the sweat

00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:36.358
of our brow.
 

00:30:36.358 --> 00:30:39.895
It's a very nice description of
what I've been telling you of

00:30:39.895 --> 00:30:43.019
the hunter gatherers living in a
lush environment--

00:30:43.019 --> 00:30:44.740
before they're pushed into the
desert--

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.434
living quite well,
and however,

00:30:47.434 --> 00:30:51.119
later on then they have to be
farmers,

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:52.548
the sweat of the brow.
 

00:30:52.548 --> 00:30:59.980
And violence like Cain and Abel
is what is the fly in the

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:05.288
ointment of that beautiful Eden
story.

00:31:05.288 --> 00:31:11.165
Now we come to the agricultural
period in our historical romp

00:31:11.165 --> 00:31:12.930
through history.
 

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.013
There are some really
fundamental issues that you have

00:31:17.013 --> 00:31:21.945
to understand to understand what
was happening with population in

00:31:21.945 --> 00:31:23.180
these times.
 

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.661
There's constraints on human
population, and the first was

00:31:27.661 --> 00:31:31.750
this enormous infant mortality
which I showed you.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:36.890
Again, we're looking at 1960
here in a very civilized place,

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:41.733
poor India in 1960,
but still even into the 1960s

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:47.079
where we're very modern,
the infant mortality is

00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:48.220
enormous.
 

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.940
You go, even currently,
to a less well developed place,

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.960
just cut out this quote from
Haiti in 1979,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.670
before this recent rash of
problems,

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.660
a Cornell trained Haitian,
comes from Haiti to Cornell,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.568
gets a medical degree,
returns to Haiti,

00:32:05.568 --> 00:32:08.810
and he gets a job at a
pediatric hospital:

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.367
"40% of the infants,
of the babies,"

00:32:12.367 --> 00:32:15.357
the birth rate--
he's working in among other

00:32:15.357 --> 00:32:18.626
things a maternity clinic,
"40% of the babies were

00:32:18.626 --> 00:32:20.368
dying of endemic diarrhea.
 

00:32:20.368 --> 00:32:25.304
A man would come to pick up the
bodies three times a day with a

00:32:25.304 --> 00:32:26.098
big bag.
 

00:32:26.098 --> 00:32:29.490
The noise of the skulls in the
bag was unbearable."

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:35.368
And this is 1979 in--how far is
Haiti from Miami?

00:32:35.368 --> 00:32:39.470
A hundred and fifty miles or
something like that.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:45.112
The data--we have various data
sets for what life expectancy

00:32:45.112 --> 00:32:49.688
was like,
and this is various populations

00:32:49.688 --> 00:32:53.578
and what this is,
this is a survivorship curve.

00:32:53.578 --> 00:32:59.298
So you take--for 1,000 people
born in any given space of time,

00:32:59.298 --> 00:33:01.920
in an earlier period--so this
is Cisalpine Gaul,

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.575
this is Roman times,
that's the part of Gaul that's

00:33:05.575 --> 00:33:08.720
this side of the Alps according
to them,

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.660
Cisalpine Gaul.
 

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.635
Out of 1,000 children born,
and actually this shows females

00:33:16.635 --> 00:33:21.698
but it's more or less the same
for males, almost immediately

00:33:21.698 --> 00:33:23.500
half of them die.
 

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:30.233
That's very characteristic of
human societies until modern

00:33:30.233 --> 00:33:35.550
sanitation comes in,
which is in Europe 1700s,

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.858
and in Asia maybe 1900s.
 

00:33:38.858 --> 00:33:43.576
You have this tremendous death
rate of children and then it

00:33:43.576 --> 00:33:48.130
continues at a fairly high but
decreasing death rate,

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.848
and then finally there's very
few people left.

00:33:50.848 --> 00:33:53.589
This is not the curve which
showed you the percentage of

00:33:53.589 --> 00:33:55.981
death in age thing,
but how many people are still

00:33:55.981 --> 00:33:56.680
surviving?
 

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.724
At any point in--by age 15
here, this dotted line,

00:34:01.724 --> 00:34:07.286
only about 40% of people are
still alive, 60% have died

00:34:07.286 --> 00:34:09.139
before age 15.
 

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.789
This again is women,
so a lot of these deaths in

00:34:11.789 --> 00:34:14.175
this middle period,
by the time--this is the

00:34:14.175 --> 00:34:18.945
reproductive years,
these dotted lines is 15 to 45

00:34:18.945 --> 00:34:21.717
or so,
I think 50 in this case,

00:34:21.717 --> 00:34:25.989
which is the years in which
women can reproduce and most of

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:30.409
the death in females in this
period is childbirth itself.

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.829
In a developing population,
in a pre-medical population,

00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:37.599
childbirth itself is one of the
most dangerous things in these

00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:41.820
years and the death rates are
very high from childbirth

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:46.030
itself,
so a lot of that is female--is

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.340
childbirth.
 

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.380
If you looked a male population
it might even be more extreme

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:57.168
due to the--probably due to the
violence that we've talked

00:34:57.168 --> 00:34:58.010
about.
 

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.257
Now as times goes on--we're
going to come back to this

00:35:00.257 --> 00:35:02.173
graph,
but as time goes on,

00:35:02.173 --> 00:35:05.780
this is Italy in 1921 and
things have gotten--

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.068
at all ages the death is less,
so there's more people

00:35:09.068 --> 00:35:11.730
surviving,
and then you come to Japan;

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:16.030
again 1984 and you have very,
very little infant mortality,

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:20.278
very little mortality through
this period and then again old

00:35:20.278 --> 00:35:22.800
age takes over and people do
die.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.951
This kind of bump here compared
to say this, is again possibly

00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:31.920
violence in that era,
but again, we don't really

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.679
know.
 

00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:34.869
For our purposes,
going back in time,

00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:38.181
we're really interested in this
lower graph which is

00:35:38.181 --> 00:35:41.880
characteristic of humans from
way back until really almost

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.018
Napoleonic times,
maybe through Napoleonic times

00:35:45.018 --> 00:35:47.817
but the death--
the violence in Napoleonic

00:35:47.817 --> 00:35:49.268
times was enormous.
 

00:35:49.268 --> 00:35:52.208
If you look at women,
consider this just a graph for

00:35:52.208 --> 00:35:52.670
women.
 

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:56.329
Of 1,000 women born,
400 are still alive at the

00:35:56.329 --> 00:36:01.181
beginning of their reproductive
period and about 200 are still

00:36:01.181 --> 00:36:05.159
alive at the end of their
reproductive period.

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:08.311
If you average that out
something like--it would be the

00:36:08.311 --> 00:36:11.347
same as if something 300 women
lived throughout their

00:36:11.347 --> 00:36:12.750
reproductive period.
 

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.280
Well, if that society is going
to keep going,

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:23.148
what is needed to happen that
these more or less 300 women

00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:27.369
have to reproduce 1,000 women,
right?

00:36:27.369 --> 00:36:32.400
If they reproduce 1,000 women
they also have to reproduce

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.570
1,000 boys.
 

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.905
So 300 women have to give rise
to 2,000 children and if they

00:36:37.905 --> 00:36:42.021
don't do that then there's fewer
and fewer people in each

00:36:42.021 --> 00:36:46.800
generation and rapidly you don't
see this population anymore.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.239
How many children is that that
each woman has to have?

00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:53.730
Three hundred women making
2,000 children--

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.570
6 2/3, almost 7,
so that means that in--

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.260
when you have a mortality curve
like this,

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.800
which again is most of human
recorded history,

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.097
most of human history not
counting hunter gatherers who

00:37:06.097 --> 00:37:09.326
did live longer apparently,
the absolute minimum that a

00:37:09.326 --> 00:37:12.429
society could cope with is women
have basically an average of

00:37:12.429 --> 00:37:13.360
seven children.
 

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.061
Wait a minute,
I've made this a better case,

00:37:17.061 --> 00:37:21.967
that's of the--all that this
graph shows is women that are

00:37:21.967 --> 00:37:24.119
alive in this period.
 

00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:26.320
What fraction go infertile?
 

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.480
What fraction have infertile
husbands?

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.170
What fraction never get married?
 

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.679
What fraction are too sick to
have children?

00:37:32.679 --> 00:37:36.931
What fraction of women are worn
out after two or three children

00:37:36.931 --> 00:37:38.440
and can't bear many?
 

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.760
That's also a very large number
which depends on the population,

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.195
so if you subtract those--let's
call them infertile women for a

00:37:45.195 --> 00:37:48.190
variety of reasons in which they
or their husbands,

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:53.539
or their health they're
infertile, then there's even

00:37:53.539 --> 00:37:58.260
fewer people alive and so this
curve goes--

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.807
if you didn't graph just women
alive but women that are alive

00:38:01.807 --> 00:38:05.572
and in childbearing condition,
the curve gets much lower,

00:38:05.572 --> 00:38:08.289
so the number of children that
women--

00:38:08.289 --> 00:38:12.177
the women that were physically
capable of it had to have in

00:38:12.177 --> 00:38:15.260
these pre-modern times was more
than seven,

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.085
and probably eight or nine,
or you have to do the

00:38:19.085 --> 00:38:23.630
calculation and people don't
know how to evaluate the--

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:29.340
what fraction of Roman women
were fertile or infertile?

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.969
You can't calculate that.
 

00:38:31.969 --> 00:38:40.518
We have a huge problem that
somehow there must be cul--

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:43.909
there must be mechanisms to
insure that no women are wasted,

00:38:43.909 --> 00:38:46.730
that any woman that can
reproduce does reproduce,

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.480
and when they reproduce they go
at it.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.405
They just keep going and going,
and of course men have an equal

00:38:53.405 --> 00:38:57.079
part--well they don't do the
amount of work but they have a

00:38:57.079 --> 00:38:58.030
part in it.
 

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:03.123
As I said, this level of
mortality continues into quite

00:39:03.123 --> 00:39:06.518
modern times,
it's quite striking.

00:39:06.518 --> 00:39:11.001
Europe got out of it a little
bit earlier, I say somewhere in

00:39:11.001 --> 00:39:15.110
1700s, but for instance in 1912
in Australia--we have an

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.530
Australian T.A.
 

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:17.820
is she here today?
 

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:22.688
Went to the--she got a ticket
to the inauguration--1912

00:39:22.688 --> 00:39:27.827
Australian census shows that 60%
of all children born died

00:39:27.827 --> 00:39:29.090
unmarried.
 

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.083
That's this number,
we have them--well it was about

00:39:32.083 --> 00:39:35.737
the same number as this,
this shows that only 40% are

00:39:35.737 --> 00:39:39.159
left and this says in Australia
60% are dead,

00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:43.219
so that's the same number.
 

00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:46.090
Sixty percent of children born
died unmarried,

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.480
and among the married one-ninth
of marriages were sterile,

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.710
and just 11% of the men and 14%
of the women produced half of

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:54.768
the children.
 

00:39:54.768 --> 00:39:59.632
That means those that could
reproduce and were married and

00:39:59.632 --> 00:40:03.472
had to really have very,
very high birthrates,

00:40:03.472 --> 00:40:05.179
as late as 1912.
 

00:40:05.179 --> 00:40:11.224
China, as late as 1930,
had a nearly aboriginal birth

00:40:11.224 --> 00:40:13.199
and death rate.
 

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:17.094
The total fertility level was
at these levels of six,

00:40:17.094 --> 00:40:21.141
seven, eight children per
woman, yet the population was

00:40:21.141 --> 00:40:24.597
not increasing,
which means the death rate was

00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:28.315
just as high and they were in
this kind of a situation for

00:40:28.315 --> 00:40:29.360
reproduction.
 

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.219
We're going to talk a lot about
China later of course.

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:37.460
At that death rate,
and this is data for China,

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.230
in order to have a 50%
certainty--so as you know many

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.635
cultures,
and Chinese included in

00:40:43.635 --> 00:40:47.989
traditional times,
for sure wanted at least one

00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:49.929
child to survive.
 

00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:53.880
They do a calculation at this
death rate how many children is

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.831
the minimum you have to have to
give yourself a 50% chance of

00:40:57.831 --> 00:41:01.159
having one son survive;
five children.

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:04.969
If you're not thinking of
reproducing the population,

00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:08.172
but just reproducing your own
family which is the way

00:41:08.172 --> 00:41:12.360
individual families think,
and they have to have a son and

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.650
you have this mortality rate,
at five children you have a 50%

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:17.139
chance.
 

00:41:17.139 --> 00:41:19.838
If you want to have an 80%
chance of something you're back

00:41:19.838 --> 00:41:23.059
up to eight,
nine, ten children which

00:41:23.059 --> 00:41:26.394
explains the desire--
not necessarily--they don't

00:41:26.394 --> 00:41:28.889
necessarily keep this birth rate
but the desire for these very,

00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:31.679
very high birth rates.
 

00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:35.929
The result is that in most
pre-modern societies,

00:41:35.929 --> 00:41:40.358
women spend their whole
post-pubertal lives either

00:41:40.358 --> 00:41:42.710
pregnant or lactating.
 

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:47.012
There's basically never a time
when they're free of the

00:41:47.012 --> 00:41:50.039
biological aspects of
childbearing,

00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:55.134
not counting the children that
are now not breastfeeding

00:41:55.134 --> 00:41:58.840
anymore that Bonnie was talking
about.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.583
For instance,
in Bangladesh in the 1990s,

00:42:01.583 --> 00:42:05.701
we're coming up very--75% of
the women in the age group of 20

00:42:05.701 --> 00:42:08.719
to 39 were either pregnant or
lactating.

00:42:08.719 --> 00:42:10.889
That means four out of every
five women were,

00:42:10.889 --> 00:42:12.690
at that moment,
any moment that you look,

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.050
they're either pregnant or
breastfeeding,

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.617
and there's a small period in
which they rest and then it

00:42:19.617 --> 00:42:21.250
starts over again.
 

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:25.699
We're not talking--in the need
for these very high birth rates,

00:42:25.699 --> 00:42:29.059
we're not just talking about
primitive tribes by any means,

00:42:29.059 --> 00:42:33.182
we're talking about the period
in which all the world's great

00:42:33.182 --> 00:42:34.969
civilizations developed.
 

00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:38.715
Civilization--one of the things
that civilizations had to do was

00:42:38.715 --> 00:42:40.619
insure a birth rate like this.
 

00:42:40.619 --> 00:42:45.148
In the period in which cultures
were learning to write and

00:42:45.148 --> 00:42:49.878
producing a classic literature,
and developing the great world

00:42:49.878 --> 00:42:52.929
religions,
all of these if you read

00:42:52.929 --> 00:42:58.342
through them are calculated in
some sense to keep fertility

00:42:58.342 --> 00:42:59.090
high.
 

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:03.230
All of these things glorify
high fertility.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:09.510
The religious doctrines push it;
there's community sanctions;

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.860
the cultures just developed in
a way that--

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.679
in order to increase fertility
and any culture that doesn't do

00:43:15.679 --> 00:43:17.760
that and doesn't increase it
successfully,

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.239
they're just not here anymore.
 

00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:22.105
Of course most cultures that
you read about are not here

00:43:22.105 --> 00:43:24.190
anymore, and they were not
successful.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:28.927
In our Western culture,
the most famous of these things

00:43:28.927 --> 00:43:34.719
is the First Commandment in the
Bible: be fruitful and multiply.

00:43:34.719 --> 00:43:37.891
Well that fits us,
if you didn't do that then the

00:43:37.891 --> 00:43:41.128
Hebrews would be gone,
and we wouldn't have any of

00:43:41.128 --> 00:43:44.300
what we currently have in terms
of religion;

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.340
any kind of the monotheistic
religions.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.780
There's all kinds--you look at
the culture--the religious

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:55.061
tradition of any culture,
you'll find all kinds of laws

00:43:55.061 --> 00:43:57.518
about regulating sexuality.
 

00:43:57.518 --> 00:44:01.268
Now, Yale students don't know
much about the Bible--

00:44:01.268 --> 00:44:04.547
how many of you know--you know
masturbation is supposed to a

00:44:04.547 --> 00:44:07.293
bad thing,
do you know what the Bible is

00:44:07.293 --> 00:44:09.179
supposed to prohibit that?
 

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:14.639
Student:  Story of Onan
spilling his seed.

00:44:14.639 --> 00:44:17.885
Prof: Yes,
so it's the story Onan spilling

00:44:17.885 --> 00:44:22.010
his seed, and do you know why he
was spilling his seed or what

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:23.429
the situation is?
 

00:44:23.429 --> 00:44:25.242
Student:  There's
different versions,

00:44:25.242 --> 00:44:27.605
one is that he was having sex
with his brother's wife and

00:44:27.605 --> 00:44:29.039
didn't want to impregnate her.
 

00:44:29.039 --> 00:44:31.478
Prof: Why was he
having--so she said he was

00:44:31.478 --> 00:44:34.067
having sex with his brother's
wife and didn't want to

00:44:34.067 --> 00:44:35.809
impregnate her;
that's correct.

00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:37.802
Student:  Well he was
doing it because his brother had

00:44:37.802 --> 00:44:39.489
passed away,
and according to the Levirate

00:44:39.489 --> 00:44:41.654
marriage tradition,
he was then supposed to do it,

00:44:41.654 --> 00:44:43.219
in order to have a kid that
would--

00:44:43.219 --> 00:44:45.286
have his brother's kid,
but he didn't want to have a

00:44:45.286 --> 00:44:47.110
kid that would count as the
brother's kid,

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:48.949
he wanted his kid to count as
his kid,

00:44:48.949 --> 00:44:51.389
so he would always pull out and
spill his seed on the ground,

00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:54.380
and God said that's immoral and
struck him dead.

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.860
Prof: Right,
exactly correct.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.929
I have to repeat this for the
camera.

00:45:00.929 --> 00:45:03.789
The situation--it's a very
short passage,

00:45:03.789 --> 00:45:07.681
a very interesting passage,
and it's giving out various

00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:10.351
moral--
it's in a section giving out

00:45:10.351 --> 00:45:12.402
moral laws,
and it says,

00:45:12.402 --> 00:45:16.389
'someone had sons and one of
them was Ur,

00:45:16.389 --> 00:45:18.409
and Ur was married,
and Ur died.'

00:45:18.409 --> 00:45:20.469
It doesn't say much about Ur
except that he died.

00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:22.050
Onan was the next brother.
 

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:27.338
Repeated in the Old Testament
many times is that if a man's

00:45:27.338 --> 00:45:32.534
brother dies he has the moral
obligation to inseminate the

00:45:32.534 --> 00:45:36.731
sister--
the sister-in-law--in order to

00:45:36.731 --> 00:45:40.559
secure an heir for the dead
brother.

00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:44.809
That if he fathers a child with
his sister-in-law then that is

00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:48.521
not considered his child,
it is considered the dead

00:45:48.521 --> 00:45:50.929
brother's child,
and that's one of these

00:45:50.929 --> 00:45:54.054
important things of carrying on
the family lines which is one of

00:45:54.054 --> 00:45:56.929
the ways of course insures a
high population birthrate.

00:45:56.929 --> 00:46:02.139
This is a way of keeping women,
whether they're married or not,

00:46:02.139 --> 00:46:03.940
whether their husband is dead
or not,

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.847
you've got to keep them
reproducing or the culture

00:46:06.847 --> 00:46:07.619
disappears.
 

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:11.340
Why doesn't Ur want to do--why
doesn't Onan want to do this?

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.940
Well he may or may--it's not
his kid so it was born--

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.750
there's none of this sort of
power and authority,

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.393
and macho stature to come with
having a lot of kids because

00:46:22.393 --> 00:46:24.621
it's the brother's kid,
in the culture it was the

00:46:24.621 --> 00:46:27.052
brother's kid,
but on top of that he would

00:46:27.052 --> 00:46:28.750
have to support this kid.
 

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.195
Economically he would have to
support not only the wife but

00:46:31.195 --> 00:46:33.612
the kid,
and he didn't want to have to

00:46:33.612 --> 00:46:37.514
support kids that weren't his,
so he engaged in the sex act

00:46:37.514 --> 00:46:40.130
because that was the fun part of
it and--

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:44.286
but at the last minute he pulls
out and spills his seed upon the

00:46:44.286 --> 00:46:44.880
ground.
 

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.449
Then the Bible passage is very
curt, it doesn't say more--and

00:46:48.449 --> 00:46:49.760
then God killed him.
 

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.360
There's not a lot of
explanation for this.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.072
It's repeated,
this particular law called the

00:46:55.072 --> 00:46:57.905
levirate laws,
as a student said is repeated

00:46:57.905 --> 00:47:00.614
in several places in the Bible
and it's very,

00:47:00.614 --> 00:47:03.139
very clear that people didn't
do this.

00:47:03.139 --> 00:47:06.456
People did not insem--did not
want to inseminate their

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:10.400
brother's wives because of these
reasons and so whenever you see

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.657
a law sort of demanding
something over and over again

00:47:13.657 --> 00:47:17.224
you know people weren't doing it
and that's why the law is

00:47:17.224 --> 00:47:18.539
demanding it.
 

00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:24.413
That's just one example of how
religion gets involved in

00:47:24.413 --> 00:47:28.434
enforcing fertility,
and in this particular example,

00:47:28.434 --> 00:47:31.514
it's one of the mechanisms for
keeping every woman pregnant as

00:47:31.514 --> 00:47:35.623
much of the time as possible,
independent of her state of

00:47:35.623 --> 00:47:36.530
marriage.
 

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:42.849
The--anybody know why the
Muslims took to polygamy?

00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:48.070
Why Mohammed allowed four wives;
no Muslims in the class?

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:49.019
Student:  To free women
from slavery.

00:47:49.019 --> 00:47:51.750
Prof: What?
 

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.739
Student:  To free women
from slavery.

00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:57.150
Married women--that's the
version that I remember.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.972
Prof: No.
 

00:47:57.972 --> 00:48:00.797
The standard version is they
were going through a lot of

00:48:00.797 --> 00:48:01.210
wars.
 

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.101
The Muslims were conquering the
whole world, they were

00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:04.849
constantly at war,
the men were getting killed.

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:08.443
There weren't enough men,
so what do you do with the

00:48:08.443 --> 00:48:09.429
other women?
 

00:48:09.429 --> 00:48:11.869
They--I mean many reasons but
one of--

00:48:11.869 --> 00:48:15.309
they need support and so it's a
beneficial thing,

00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:18.018
but their society needed more
men, more children,

00:48:18.018 --> 00:48:20.989
so let them get married
multiply.

00:48:20.989 --> 00:48:24.077
You just--whatever religion you
want to look at you'll find

00:48:24.077 --> 00:48:25.570
similar kinds of examples.
 

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:33.070
When we get to family planning
issues later on,

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:36.139
how people controlled their
reproduction,

00:48:36.139 --> 00:48:38.610
one of the major beliefs that
the early--

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.059
we don't really know again,
but in the West was that the

00:48:41.059 --> 00:48:43.510
mechanism people used was
coitus interruptus,

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.289
because it was the only thing
they knew about.

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:47.230
It's in the Bible,
it tells you what you do,

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:51.753
it tells you the result of it,
and so that Onan passage is

00:48:51.753 --> 00:48:55.641
currently interpreted to say
that masturbation and

00:48:55.641 --> 00:48:58.432
contraception,
all kinds of things are bad,

00:48:58.432 --> 00:49:00.909
when in fact the passage has
nothing to do with that.

00:49:00.909 --> 00:49:03.876
That's not what that passage is
about but that's what it's used

00:49:03.876 --> 00:49:06.750
for today, but it's been used
absolutely for the opposite.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:09.929
People use this,
oh that's how I can avoid

00:49:09.929 --> 00:49:13.731
having children and so
it's--culture twists itself

00:49:13.731 --> 00:49:16.989
about and has unexpected
consequences.

00:49:16.989 --> 00:49:23.423
Okay, so I've been stressing
for you that culture pushes up

00:49:23.423 --> 00:49:27.639
fertility and up to this high
limit.

00:49:27.639 --> 00:49:32.179
What is the limit of human
fertility?

00:49:32.179 --> 00:49:34.409
We have to evaluate that.
 

00:49:34.409 --> 00:49:38.146
There's a very famous
calculation of this and it's set

00:49:38.146 --> 00:49:41.320
by the number of years a woman
is fertile,

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.179
which is generally 15 to 45
more or less,

00:49:44.179 --> 00:49:45.860
it can be a little bit younger,
occasionally a little bit

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:50.538
older,
but they usually consider 30 or

00:49:50.538 --> 00:49:53.809
so years of fertility.
 

00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:57.289
At that--well if she gets
pregnant, she's pregnant for

00:49:57.289 --> 00:49:58.210
nine months.
 

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:02.730
Ovulation rarely starts again
before at least three months,

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:08.460
if she's lactating and
therefore going through--

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:12.103
not ovulating again,
there's going to be more

00:50:12.103 --> 00:50:12.849
months.
 

00:50:12.849 --> 00:50:16.710
If a woman has sexual
intercourse it takes an average

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.159
of five cycles to get pregnant.
 

00:50:19.159 --> 00:50:21.900
When we talk about abortion
we'll talk about why that is,

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.400
but if a woman's having normal
sex trying to get pregnant,

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.126
the average is five months
before she actually does get

00:50:28.126 --> 00:50:31.369
pregnant and we'll see where
that comes from.

00:50:31.369 --> 00:50:35.148
If the child dies,
fetal mortality introduces a

00:50:35.148 --> 00:50:39.184
month there--
anyway you add all of this up

00:50:39.184 --> 00:50:44.152
and you get 18 months that--
pretty much the maximum that

00:50:44.152 --> 00:50:48.710
human females can do is 18
months or one and a half years.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.980
Dividing--what they usually do
is choose 20--

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.530
any particular woman will
probably be fertile for 25

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:56.038
years,
divide that by 18 months,

00:50:56.038 --> 00:51:00.650
and you get a theoretical
possibility of 16.7 children.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:05.405
Now how many of you know
somebody's who has had more than

00:51:05.405 --> 00:51:06.000
that?
 

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.420
What's the maximum number of
children you know about?

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.980
Student:  I know someone
with 18 children.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.820
Prof: Eighteen;
I'm bid 18.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.610
Only one in the class?
 

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.152
Student:  I think the
world record for a woman is

00:51:19.152 --> 00:51:21.510
somewhere--it's really high,
much higher than 18.

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:24.239
I thought it was like in the
60s.

00:51:24.239 --> 00:51:25.449
Prof: Oh, no not 60.
 

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:28.507
That's really crazy unless
there's some crazy multiple

00:51:28.507 --> 00:51:28.969
birth.
 

00:51:28.969 --> 00:51:32.856
Now with modern drugs sometimes
there's multiple,

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:33.909
but not 60.
 

00:51:33.909 --> 00:51:36.699
This is an unusual class,
but as time goes on,

00:51:36.699 --> 00:51:39.739
families get smaller and people
don't remember.

00:51:39.739 --> 00:51:43.768
The maximum I got out of this
class was 24 children.

00:51:43.768 --> 00:51:46.442
I think it was a Chinese
student, I don't totally

00:51:46.442 --> 00:51:48.907
remember,
and that 24 was only two sets

00:51:48.907 --> 00:51:51.199
of twins,
so there were 22 separate

00:51:51.199 --> 00:51:55.048
successful pregnancies,
two of which produce twins,

00:51:55.048 --> 00:51:58.389
24 children,
one woman.

00:51:58.389 --> 00:52:02.871
Even--forget this--independent
of this calculation which I've

00:52:02.871 --> 00:52:05.860
just sort of sketched for you at
the--

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.137
even before the calculation was
done and the person who did the

00:52:09.137 --> 00:52:13.771
calculation knew about it--
this is not--here is

00:52:13.771 --> 00:52:22.920
the--Norway in an earlier set of
women which is this set,

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.688
and a later set of women,
and this is the number of

00:52:25.688 --> 00:52:29.516
children that the women have,
and the percentage--the per

00:52:29.516 --> 00:52:32.409
1,000 of women that have that
number.

00:52:32.409 --> 00:52:40.119
In the late 1880s the most
common number from Norway--

00:52:40.119 --> 00:52:43.298
again we're talking Norway
1890, we're not talking about

00:52:43.298 --> 00:52:46.869
anything very primitive,
is 10 children.

00:52:46.869 --> 00:52:51.512
The mode for Norway was 10
children and it goes out to 18,

00:52:51.512 --> 00:52:55.260
which was the record that
someone here knew.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.679
There were--of course if you
had a bigger assembly you get an

00:52:57.679 --> 00:52:58.929
occasional of something more.
 

00:52:58.929 --> 00:53:01.880
Student:  The world's
record it's 69 children.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:02.900
Prof: What does it say?
 

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.210
Good for him--what--that's
something special;

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:07.889
does it say anything about it?
 

00:53:07.889 --> 00:53:09.958
Student:  She has--
Student:  Sixteen sets

00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:12.117
of twins, seven sets of
triplets, and four sets of

00:53:12.117 --> 00:53:12.780
quadruplets.
 

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:16.333
Prof: Okay so it
was--what was the total number

00:53:16.333 --> 00:53:18.480
of--yeah so--okay I was wrong.
 

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:24.887
Send me--both of you send me
the reference for that because

00:53:24.887 --> 00:53:27.539
next year I'll use it.
 

00:53:27.539 --> 00:53:29.755
Now, just as long as I've got
this slide up there,

00:53:29.755 --> 00:53:30.659
look what changes.
 

00:53:30.659 --> 00:53:35.369
We go from 40 years later,
not a huge fraction of time;

00:53:35.369 --> 00:53:38.130
we're going to talk about this
later in the class.

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:41.936
It goes from the mode being 10
children to the mode being 2

00:53:41.936 --> 00:53:42.659
children.
 

00:53:42.659 --> 00:53:47.407
Something drastic happens in
between these two in 40 years,

00:53:47.407 --> 00:53:50.110
and this is common over Europe.
 

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:53.204
This is just one data set and
we're going to talk about that a

00:53:53.204 --> 00:53:54.268
since it's up here.
 

00:53:54.268 --> 00:53:57.793
In this period of time that
we're talking about women had

00:53:57.793 --> 00:54:01.385
this very un--
in the mode there's a very

00:54:01.385 --> 00:54:06.556
large number of children and
they far exceeded what's

00:54:06.556 --> 00:54:09.440
calculated as the maximum.
 

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:13.112
Let's see okay,
the answer is that the

00:54:13.112 --> 00:54:16.289
biological limit is very high.
 

00:54:16.289 --> 00:54:22.063
I'll say 24,
you say 69, and we have to read

00:54:22.063 --> 00:54:23.809
that stuff.
 

00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:27.353
In a human population,
and continuing for any length

00:54:27.353 --> 00:54:30.690
of time, the highest
well-documented fertility is

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.469
that of the Hutterites in the
1920s.

00:54:33.469 --> 00:54:35.380
Anybody hear of Hutterites?
 

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.659
It's a Christian religious sect
that are an--

00:54:37.659 --> 00:54:42.340
what's called an anabaptist
sect that originated in Europe,

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.635
migrates here,
they're in the upper mid-West

00:54:45.635 --> 00:54:49.389
in North Dakota and going on
over into Canada,

00:54:49.389 --> 00:54:54.610
and they're very successful in
both economic ways and in

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:56.320
population ways.
 

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.577
They marry fairly early,
not extremely early but fairly

00:54:59.577 --> 00:55:00.059
early.
 

00:55:00.059 --> 00:55:02.525
They have a good diet,
they're farmers and very

00:55:02.525 --> 00:55:04.936
productive farmers,
and they have good medical

00:55:04.936 --> 00:55:05.420
care.
 

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:09.735
They engage in sex regularly;
they're supposed too,

00:55:09.735 --> 00:55:14.460
and their religion forbids
contraception or abortion.

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.349
Not only do they have--they
obey these rules.

00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:20.409
Many people have those rules in
the books but this is a very

00:55:20.409 --> 00:55:23.300
religious group and they obey
the rules.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.980
Their, what we call total
fertility rate,

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.994
which at this moment you can
consider the average number of

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:34.869
children that a woman in that
society would have was 12.4

00:55:34.869 --> 00:55:35.768
children.
 

00:55:35.768 --> 00:55:39.346
Nothing--that's high--you think
that's high, I saw someone

00:55:39.346 --> 00:55:42.860
blanch here, as an average,
but nothing like the 24 or 60

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.679
that we're talking about.
 

00:55:44.679 --> 00:55:48.139
This is the highest human
population that we have

00:55:48.139 --> 00:55:52.175
documented, can have that,
and it's nowhere near any kind

00:55:52.175 --> 00:55:54.409
of calculation for a limit.
 

00:55:54.409 --> 00:55:57.889
The most usual limit,
and you see a lot of cultures

00:55:57.889 --> 00:56:01.369
in at least some part of the
history where the--

00:56:01.369 --> 00:56:06.447
eight is current cultures were
or historical cultures where

00:56:06.447 --> 00:56:09.949
eight is kind of a maintained
average.

00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:11.590
In the colonial United States,
for instance,

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:15.282
for a short time when the
frontier was wide open they had

00:56:15.282 --> 00:56:18.449
a fertility rate of eight
children per women,

00:56:18.449 --> 00:56:23.019
but as soon as the frontier
would close in a region the

00:56:23.019 --> 00:56:25.389
fertility rate would drop.
 

00:56:25.389 --> 00:56:27.730
It's clearly land availability
had something to do with it.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.728
There's good data for
Massachusetts,

00:56:29.728 --> 00:56:32.469
Concord Massachusetts,
very good demographic data

00:56:32.469 --> 00:56:33.039
there.
 

00:56:33.039 --> 00:56:35.880
People had these high birth
rates until the frontier closed.

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:39.800
What did the frontier mean in
1600s in Massachusetts?

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.670
It meant like Springfield,
these were people living in

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:44.032
Plymouth,
and Concord,

00:56:44.032 --> 00:56:46.527
and Lexington,
right near the coast and the

00:56:46.527 --> 00:56:49.847
frontier was Springfield,
and as soon as--if they had a

00:56:49.847 --> 00:56:52.702
lot of children,
the children would have to move

00:56:52.702 --> 00:56:56.425
out to Springfield or somewhere
which is 100 miles or something

00:56:56.425 --> 00:56:59.190
like that and that was beyond
the frontier.

00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:03.074
As soon as the children had to
move more than a day's horse

00:57:03.074 --> 00:57:05.619
ride away the fertility rate
drops,

00:57:05.619 --> 00:57:07.422
so there's something about
having the support of your

00:57:07.422 --> 00:57:09.364
children,
really having a group that

00:57:09.364 --> 00:57:10.829
increases the fertility.
 

00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:14.331
As soon as the children will
have to disperse and not anymore

00:57:14.331 --> 00:57:16.489
be of some sort of support to
you,

00:57:16.489 --> 00:57:20.800
or some part of your group,
fertility comes back down.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:27.139
No society really has ever come
close to the biological limit.

00:57:27.139 --> 00:57:31.153
Before we talked about how
culture pushes up the birth

00:57:31.153 --> 00:57:33.648
rate,
but now we see that something

00:57:33.648 --> 00:57:37.704
is pushing down the birth rate,
that we're coming to an

00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:39.360
intermediate level.
 

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.840
What's going on is again fairly
straightforward and simple.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:52.237
That it was this slide that I
want--here is again fairly

00:57:52.237 --> 00:57:54.119
recent data.
 

00:57:54.119 --> 00:57:58.072
Chinese women interviewed in
1981, but referring to their

00:57:58.072 --> 00:58:02.166
pregnancies which had been
sometime in the past and it says

00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:06.472
it tried to gather data on what
was the birth interval of your

00:58:06.472 --> 00:58:09.650
children and how many of them
survived?

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:13.918
If the birth interval was less
than two years 45% of the

00:58:13.918 --> 00:58:15.159
children died.
 

00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:20.780
If it was between two and three
years, 34% of the children died.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:26.335
If it was more than three
years, only 19% of the children

00:58:26.335 --> 00:58:27.030
died.
 

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:31.164
In every culture and every time
and place where we have data

00:58:31.164 --> 00:58:35.228
like this it's very clear that
if the birth interval is too

00:58:35.228 --> 00:58:38.820
small,
the children just don't survive.

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:44.393
What's going on with pushing
down the fertility rate is that

00:58:44.393 --> 00:58:46.507
it--
especially in situations of

00:58:46.507 --> 00:58:48.800
poverty where resources are not
great,

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.440
women are not especially
healthy, there's no--

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:56.032
any kind of medicine available,
that if the child does not get

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:59.311
a lot of resources,
which a large case is milk from

00:58:59.311 --> 00:59:01.090
the mother is the primary
thing--

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:05.887
in China there's no dairy
products at this time in this

00:59:05.887 --> 00:59:07.219
social class.
 

00:59:07.219 --> 00:59:09.880
It's largely food directly from
the mother;

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.570
the children are just going to
die.

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:17.119
The reason that fertility is
pushed up from below,

00:59:17.119 --> 00:59:22.876
is pushed down is not to reduce
total number of children but to

00:59:22.876 --> 00:59:25.940
maximize surviving fertility.
 

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.547
What people aim is not to just
keep popping them out and having

00:59:28.547 --> 00:59:29.010
them die.
 

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:33.952
What people aim at and cultures
have learned to accommodate to

00:59:33.952 --> 00:59:36.949
is to maximize surviving
fertility.

00:59:36.949 --> 00:59:39.929
Not total fertility,
which is just being born,

00:59:39.929 --> 00:59:44.440
but maximizing the number of
children that are going to stay

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.032
alive to become adult
reproducing members of the

00:59:48.032 --> 00:59:48.949
society.
 

00:59:48.949 --> 00:59:55.639
Now people have many mechanisms
for limiting the birth rate.

00:59:55.639 --> 01:00:00.880
One that is often quite
conscious is breastfeeding;

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.960
it's a very standard method
across many cultures.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.320
You've all heard of this,
lactation amenorrhea,

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:14.300
and many, many cultures don't
leave--

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.563
I mean in our culture a woman
can breastfeed a little bit or

01:00:16.563 --> 01:00:18.157
long,
it's totally up to the

01:00:18.157 --> 01:00:18.860
individual.
 

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.989
Many cultures are very strict
rules about this.

01:00:22.989 --> 01:00:26.070
You must breastfeed for at
least--and there's a certain

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:27.039
period of time.
 

01:00:27.039 --> 01:00:31.702
Among the !Kung of Southwest
Africa, which these people speak

01:00:31.702 --> 01:00:35.510
this click language,
they've got all these--you've

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:36.909
heard of them.
 

01:00:36.909 --> 01:00:39.849
Mothers keep the infant with
them at all times,

01:00:39.849 --> 01:00:42.981
they nurse all day,
at intervals separated by only

01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:43.940
15 minutes.
 

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.869
Bonnie how would you like to
have that all day long?

01:00:46.869 --> 01:00:49.639
Nurse every 15 minutes the
child;

01:00:49.639 --> 01:00:53.211
they sleep next to the mother,
and have access to her breast

01:00:53.211 --> 01:00:56.722
all night long and the nursing
continues until the child is

01:00:56.722 --> 01:00:58.539
more than three years old.
 

01:00:58.539 --> 01:01:02.050
By that mechanism,
primarily by the lactation

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:06.918
amenorrhea, the birth interval
among !Kung is four years which

01:01:06.918 --> 01:01:10.110
fits--is beyond this survival
issue.

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:15.659
This is the kind of--I talked
about Nomads and people that

01:01:15.659 --> 01:01:19.025
have--
fairly conscious--they're

01:01:19.025 --> 01:01:25.130
probably are aware that this is
limiting the births and it's

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:28.650
something that they want to do.
 

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:33.210
When the women go foraging they
carry their children--

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.969
again the !Kung,
they carry their children with

01:01:35.969 --> 01:01:39.570
them until their four years old
and while carrying the infant

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.210
she walks up to 12 miles round
trip to--

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:46.280
it takes 6 miles to go out and
find some food and come back;

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.059
12 miles round trip and then in
addition to that she carries

01:01:50.059 --> 01:01:51.789
loads of 15 to 35 pounds.
 

01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:55.465
Here's a woman who--being a
hunter gatherer is probably

01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:59.177
fairly healthy,
she's carrying an infant on her

01:01:59.177 --> 01:02:02.110
back,
walking around 12 miles,

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:07.050
and coming back with a load of
35 pounds of food.

01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:10.570
It's quite a feat and it's
clear that they can't--

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.260
they're not going to have a
second infant,

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.789
one on the back,
one of the hip,

01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:18.219
this is not a way of improving
survival.

01:02:18.219 --> 01:02:22.530
That's--lactation is one
mechanism.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:28.557
There's many taboos on sexual
relations, especially after

01:02:28.557 --> 01:02:29.420
birth.
 

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:32.271
In many cultures,
as I said, a prescribed period

01:02:32.271 --> 01:02:33.059
of nursing.
 

01:02:33.059 --> 01:02:37.317
There's also a post-partum
taboo against having sexual

01:02:37.317 --> 01:02:41.333
relations, and again,
another obvious mechanism for

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:42.780
birth spacing.
 

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:48.092
If you--again this gets to the
degree of consciousness of these

01:02:48.092 --> 01:02:48.949
methods.
 

01:02:48.949 --> 01:02:52.610
If you ask a member of a
society that has a taboo they

01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:56.686
report for instance that sex at
that time is very dangerous,

01:02:56.686 --> 01:02:58.619
a life and death matter.
 

01:02:58.619 --> 01:03:01.820
It is dangerous to mix the
man's blood with the woman's,

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.789
and the man's blood is
transmitted through semen.

01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:08.088
It's a bodily fluid and they
don't totally--the biology is

01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:09.130
not very strong.
 

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:12.731
Their course at Yale was
terrible--we'll talk a lot

01:03:12.731 --> 01:03:14.844
about--
not a lot--some,

01:03:14.844 --> 01:03:19.331
about what pre--pre-education
people believe about

01:03:19.331 --> 01:03:22.170
reproduction and everything.
 

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:28.509
If man's blood gets into the
woman through his semen then it

01:03:28.509 --> 01:03:33.166
also gets into her milk,
and then the man's blood goes

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:36.920
back into the baby through the
mother's milk and this is poison

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.889
for the baby.
 

01:03:37.889 --> 01:03:43.960
That's their version of why
they shouldn't--why they have

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.369
this taboo.
 

01:03:45.369 --> 01:03:47.320
We see this in the evolution of
cultures,

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.099
I mean just as we evolve
biologically,

01:03:49.099 --> 01:03:52.869
of course evolve culturally,
that cultures may--

01:03:52.869 --> 01:03:56.766
will pick up a behavioral
pattern for who knows what

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:59.172
reason,
and they may have no clue what

01:03:59.172 --> 01:04:01.916
it's 'real' as we see it,
it's 'real' purpose is,

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:05.003
in this case to space births
apart they have some kind of

01:04:05.003 --> 01:04:08.143
cultural story about it and it
doesn't matter whether that

01:04:08.143 --> 01:04:10.679
cultural story has any degree of
reality.

01:04:10.679 --> 01:04:13.635
If they've picked up a cultural
norm that works,

01:04:13.635 --> 01:04:16.969
the society is still here,
and that gets passed on.

01:04:16.969 --> 01:04:22.775
If that cultural practice does
not work, not only reproduction,

01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:26.710
all sorts of ways,
that society is gone.

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:31.760
This post-partum abstinence is
a major issue,

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.860
especially in Africa now.
 

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:40.170
The abstinence is up to three
years which is--that's sort of

01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:42.780
the mode of this in Africa.
 

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:46.889
In addition to limit births,
there's another thing which

01:04:46.889 --> 01:04:50.030
again is a population limitation
issue,

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.097
because we've talked about
individual family limitation

01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:53.900
issues,
trying to keep the kid alive.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.186
If the village is resource
limited they may have mechanisms

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:02.768
for keeping the whole population
of the whole village down,

01:05:02.768 --> 01:05:06.099
and so in Africa especially,
they have a thing called

01:05:06.099 --> 01:05:07.510
terminal abstinence.
 

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:10.782
That means at a certain point
in life the culture demands that

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:12.659
you stop having sexual
relations.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:16.710
Very often this is when your
daughter has her first child.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.699
After that you're a
grandmother, and you're not

01:05:19.699 --> 01:05:21.780
supposed to reproduce anymore.
 

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:25.110
It's interesting what--to
prevent--they perceive it as

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:28.882
preventing conflicts between
their duties as mother and their

01:05:28.882 --> 01:05:31.891
duties as grandmother,
so a grandmother is supposed to

01:05:31.891 --> 01:05:33.159
help raise the grandchildren.
 

01:05:33.159 --> 01:05:36.909
And there's a lot of biological
theory about why do humans,

01:05:36.909 --> 01:05:41.820
somewhat unique among animals,
why don't we just die --

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.550
females especially after their
fertile period,

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:45.929
there's no reason for you to
evolutionarily stay alive,

01:05:45.929 --> 01:05:49.980
most animals they don't have a
post-menopausal period.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.929
The theoretical reason is the
grandmother effect,

01:05:53.929 --> 01:05:57.956
that as a grandmother you
support the children of your

01:05:57.956 --> 01:06:00.369
child,
and that increases their

01:06:00.369 --> 01:06:03.469
survival, and so it's
evolutionarily good.

01:06:03.469 --> 01:06:05.646
Here in these tribes in Africa,
are basically saying the same

01:06:05.646 --> 01:06:07.605
thing that if you're a
grandmother you're going to have

01:06:07.605 --> 01:06:09.818
a conflict between taking care
of your own children and taking

01:06:09.818 --> 01:06:11.268
care of your daughter's
children,

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:16.659
and that conflict is bad so you
have to not engage in sexuality.

01:06:16.659 --> 01:06:19.909
Up to the middle of the 1900s
in Ireland,

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:22.755
rural Ireland,
people lived in households with

01:06:22.755 --> 01:06:26.170
many members of both sexes and
several generations,

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:28.530
big multi-family houses.
 

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:31.757
The Irish believe that there
should be only one sexually

01:06:31.757 --> 01:06:35.514
active procreative couple in the
household, so they also practice

01:06:35.514 --> 01:06:37.099
grandmother abstinence.
 

01:06:37.099 --> 01:06:41.527
These cultural items are--they
may seem a little outlandish to

01:06:41.527 --> 01:06:44.940
us in our modern day but they
were effective.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:52.510
They kept that society going.
 

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:57.719
Another issue is exogamy,
that just like chimpanzees,

01:06:57.719 --> 01:07:01.900
it's again in most animals,
it's the males that disperse,

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:06.010
but in chimps and humans it's
the females that disperse.

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:10.079
The females leave the community
at birth,

01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:13.697
to go live with the man's
family, and so she's under the

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:17.159
control then,
in many cultures basically a

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:22.266
slave to the son's family,
and the reproductive rules are

01:07:22.266 --> 01:07:27.751
then set by the son's family and
she has no choice in this and

01:07:27.751 --> 01:07:32.358
we'll talk about that extra--
this out marrying--remember

01:07:32.358 --> 01:07:36.010
with chimpanzees they were
hostile to the neighbors around

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.643
us,
human societies are that same

01:07:38.643 --> 01:07:39.018
way.
 

01:07:39.018 --> 01:07:44.590
The professor in the lab next
to me is from China,

01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:47.777
a village near Shanghai,
and he describes this to me in

01:07:47.777 --> 01:07:49.331
China,
and he says my village,

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.018
which have all the same name as
him,

01:07:51.018 --> 01:07:54.355
it's all a male bonded,
the males have been there

01:07:54.355 --> 01:07:56.554
forever,
they all have the same last

01:07:56.554 --> 01:07:59.746
name--they're hostile to all the
villages around them so they

01:07:59.746 --> 01:08:01.820
won't marry the village around
them.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:06.148
To get married they have to go
two villages away and they're

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.909
still sort of enemies.
 

01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:10.409
In New Guinea where all over
the world that's the same

01:08:10.409 --> 01:08:11.929
problem,
you're fighting with your

01:08:11.929 --> 01:08:13.695
neighbors,
and yet you have to get wives

01:08:13.695 --> 01:08:16.912
from somewhere,
you have to exchange genetic

01:08:16.912 --> 01:08:20.271
material,
otherwise you get inbreeding

01:08:20.271 --> 01:08:25.313
and so the Mae Enga they say in
New Guinea that we marry our

01:08:25.313 --> 01:08:27.659
enemies and--
this is a great story.

01:08:27.659 --> 01:08:30.747
Time is up;
I will continue this story next

01:08:30.747 --> 01:08:31.220
time.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.104
Prof: I realize that as
we read from assignment to

00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:10.714
assignment,
and partly because we read in a

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:14.864
very selective way,
I know there are a lot of gaps

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:16.300
in our readings.
 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.397
I never really have tried to
share with you the idea that

00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:24.401
there is a line,
a narrative line,

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:28.680
a conceptual line running
through the poem.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.549
The cantos are not discrete
units,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.662
poetic units,
without much relationship where

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:41.896
the links are to be found
symmetrically maybe with cantos

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:46.570
far apart from the cantos that
we are reading.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.386
I think that there is a
continuity going through many of

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:52.000
them.
 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.863
There is no doubt,
for instance,

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:58.004
between Cantos XV,
XVI, and XVII of

00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:02.530
Paradise we read last
time and Cantos XVII,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.611
XVIII, and XIX there is
actually a thematic expansion of

00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:13.799
some of the issues that Dante
raises in the Heaven of Mars.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.924
To begin with,
Dante in Canto XVIII is still

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:27.188
in the Heaven of Mars and he
meets and he lists--

00:01:27.188 --> 00:01:30.927
I know that I did not--the
number does not appear in your

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:34.739
syllabus,
but just bear with me so that I

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:37.459
can go on with these ideas.
 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.330
He just lists the number of
warriors,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.260
souls who are figures,
heroic figures,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.578
the heroic life very much like
Cacciaguida himself who appears

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:56.568
as one of the blessed,
from lines 40 and following of

00:01:56.568 --> 00:01:57.530
Canto XVIII.
 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.090
He mentions,
he sees and he mentions Joshua,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.926
biblical figures Joshua and
Judas Maccabaeus and then he

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:12.169
goes on mentioning medieval
figures.

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:17.883
Charlemagne was clearly--he's
justifying retrospectively the

00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:23.889
whole issue of the crusades to
which Cacciaguida took part,

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:29.233
and which can really be brought
back to Charlemagne's experience

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:33.050
in France and in Spain against
the Muslims.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.901
He mentions and lists
Charlemagne and of course his

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.668
paladin the great,
the so called,

00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:42.949
the Achilles-like invulnerable
Roland,

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.680
who however,
dies at Roncevaux which is the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.744
site of the war between Muslims
and Christians and he dies

00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:56.628
because of the hubris that
characterizes his life,

00:02:56.628 --> 00:03:02.830
the hubris of not wanting to
blow the bugle,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.733
that it would be heard by
Charlemagne and Charlemagne

00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:07.520
could have come to his rescue.
 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.925
As I have probably said before,
that became in the Western

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:16.908
imagination a most traumatic
experience.

00:03:16.908 --> 00:03:22.342
A traumatic experience because
it showed that the myth of

00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:29.483
invincibility of the Christian--
of Christian Europe was simply

00:03:29.483 --> 00:03:33.256
that,
an illusion to be turned into

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:38.810
rubble by the invading and
victorious Christian armies.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.258
Then he goes on mentioning the
figures of the second crusade,

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:48.750
1109 the Godfrey of Bouillon
and a figure--

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.669
a Normand who defeated actually
the Muslims in Sicily,

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.610
the Guiscard,
Robert Guiscard,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.425
and brought about in the early
ninth century-- in the late

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:01.695
ninth century;
after about 75 years the

00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:06.949
Muslims were there the expulsion
of the Muslims from Sicily.

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:13.388
A clear, thematic thread
between the previous cantos and

00:04:13.388 --> 00:04:19.709
this canto is the question of
what is a heroic life.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.375
The heroic life can even
involve a defeat,

00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:24.129
as in the case of Roland.
 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.024
It implies, however,
a heroic life clearly,

00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:33.867
though there is a typology that
runs from Joshua's defeat of and

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:36.000
seizure of Jericho.
 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.410
This is the great epic biblical
story to Guiscard,

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.089
contemporary history,
almost contemporary history.

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:49.649
For Dante it implies really a
division,

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:55.884
it implies a heroic life which
is--it implies the power to

00:04:55.884 --> 00:05:01.899
establish and live for a cause
which is going to be--

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:05.310
for Dante it's a just cause but
it's a cause that brings about

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.915
divisions so it's not--
a heroic figure is not

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:14.934
necessarily a figure that would
unify and cut across barriers

00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:16.639
and divisions.
 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.074
On the contrary,
Dante is indicating that

00:05:20.074 --> 00:05:25.142
there's a possible heroic life
onto a giving of oneself to a

00:05:25.142 --> 00:05:28.149
cause much larger than oneself.
 

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:32.593
We could just leave it at that
and we will come back to this

00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:34.100
issue in a moment.
 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.779
What I would stress--in a few
minutes.

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:42.526
What I would stress though
about this particular scene is

00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:46.940
that Dante is really aware of
divisions,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.689
aware of the need even to
separate what is mine from what

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.499
is not mine,
what is ours from what is not

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:58.875
ours so it would seem--
he seems to be perpetuating a

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:02.843
myth that's--
or an idea that some might find

00:06:02.843 --> 00:06:08.529
even objectionable that indeed
this separation is dangerous and

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.300
it's in itself caused by war and
a cause of wars.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.629
This is the objection to this
problem.

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:22.800
It's not the only time that
Dante is establishing divisions,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.709
when I have been talking over
the past few weeks about,

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:31.507
for instance,
divisions and boundaries that

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:36.480
Dante establishes even when
talking about continents.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.908
You remember in Canto VI of
Paradise when there's the

00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:45.338
story of the eagle of the Roman
Empire Dante goes on talking

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:49.916
about the periphery of Europe
where the Justinian and the bird

00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:55.690
of the empire had nestled;
the eastern part of the empire.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.790
That was the periphery of
Europe and we have been talking

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.072
about the whole how in Canto XII
of Paradise meeting

00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:07.165
Dominic, St.
 

00:07:07.165 --> 00:07:12.540
Dominic, Dante talks about the
western part of Europe.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.377
He goes out of the way to
mention this idea so there are

00:07:16.377 --> 00:07:19.028
always divisions that always
buries.

00:07:19.028 --> 00:07:24.408
He seems to believe that Rome
and the history of Rome really

00:07:24.408 --> 00:07:27.600
escapes this logic of
separation.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.939
In effect, this I know that I
mentioned to you,

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:34.262
in Monarchia,
the political track that he

00:07:34.262 --> 00:07:38.053
writes,
he does stress the fact that

00:07:38.053 --> 00:07:41.800
Aeneas is really a Roman and
not;

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.697
for instance,
he cannot really be thought of

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:45.125
as an Asian,
which he was,

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:47.540
nor can he be thought of as a
European,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.579
and he stresses the fact that
he has a kind of some--

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:54.420
there is a sort of
universalizing history in him,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.071
a universalizing impulse in the
measure in which he married

00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:01.028
three women from three different
continents,

00:08:01.028 --> 00:08:05.220
Creusa from Asia,
Dido from Africa,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.689
and Lavinia from Europe.
 

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:10.689
He does distinguish between a
kind--

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:15.122
a sort of--the history that
transcends barriers but also an

00:08:15.122 --> 00:08:19.860
idea which is really heroic here
of a history that manages--

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.887
what keeps barriers,
that these are people who

00:08:22.887 --> 00:08:24.569
fought at the crusades.
 

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:29.355
These are the--many of them
such as Joshua and Judah

00:08:29.355 --> 00:08:31.526
Maccabaeus,
but Charlemagne,

00:08:31.526 --> 00:08:34.529
not of the crusades but against
a Muslim named Roland,

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:37.759
but Godfrey of Bouillon and so
on.

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:40.980
We'll see what the consequences
of this may be.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.048
Now another conceptual thread,
I'm really going around two or

00:08:45.048 --> 00:08:49.389
three--I think I'm keeping two
or three themes in my head now.

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:55.148
Another conceptual thread
between XVII and the remaining

00:08:55.148 --> 00:08:59.754
part of XVIII,
XIX and XX which is the Heaven

00:08:59.754 --> 00:09:03.520
of Jupiter,
is the question of a very

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.450
abstract question that Dante
asks.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.389
What is a place?
 

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:15.058
That was the underlying problem
in XV, XVI, and XVII.

00:09:15.058 --> 00:09:19.525
In XV Dante tries to determine
whether his history could be

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:24.455
reduced to the boundaries of his
own native town and decides that

00:09:24.455 --> 00:09:28.460
that was no longer possible for
him to conceive.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.302
The famous chronicles,
he tries to figure out where

00:09:33.302 --> 00:09:37.080
exactly he can be in the history
of--

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.860
in the midst of Florence itself
and decides that he is an exile.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.389
That was the final prophecy of
Cacciaguida.

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:50.916
Exiled is a word that
means--it's a Latin word,

00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:54.903
in Italian or in English,
it comes "being out of

00:09:54.903 --> 00:09:56.820
one's own soil."
 

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.076
That's what the meaning is so
that in the Middle Ages they

00:10:00.076 --> 00:10:03.620
never really thought of exile as
just a spiritual condition.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.980
That is to say I feel
dislocated, I am--

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.778
my personal existential
predicament is that of feeling

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.905
that I'm out of it,
that I don't belong,

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:17.445
or that kind of--
that was not the conventional

00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:18.230
understanding.
 

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.442
Dante changes this meaning of
exile in making it into a

00:10:22.442 --> 00:10:24.158
spiritual condition.
 

00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:29.186
It's the condition of--it's the
pre-condition for his writing

00:10:29.186 --> 00:10:33.375
poetry to begin with,
so that poetry and exile seem

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:35.470
to be going together.
 

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.038
In XVIII, the real issue that
he raises is what is a place?

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:41.991
I am an exile,
I do not belong anywhere,

00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:46.381
what is--how do we understand
here and how do we understand

00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:47.139
there?
 

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:48.850
What does it mean?
 

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.928
What are these terms?
 

00:10:49.928 --> 00:10:53.642
At any rate,
he starts and enters now into

00:10:53.642 --> 00:10:59.346
canto with the remaining part of
Canto XVIII, he enters into the

00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:01.340
Heaven of Jupiter.
 

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:08.399
A heaven of white light which
he links with geometry.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:10.509
You know what geometry is?
 

00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:15.908
A science, very complex
science, it encompasses--

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:18.620
what it means is the
measurement of the Earth,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.844
it's the whole Earth that
anyone can measure with medieval

00:11:22.844 --> 00:11:23.658
geometry.
 

00:11:23.658 --> 00:11:27.224
It means--it implies the
presence of perspective within

00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:31.153
it,
with the idea that geometry is

00:11:31.153 --> 00:11:38.577
what regulates the idea of space
and the arrangement of space it

00:11:38.577 --> 00:11:43.541
implies altimetry,
it implies the measurement of

00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:45.340
the depths and so on.
 

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:51.100
It is, as you know,
traditionally linked to ethics.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.133
It has a profound intimate
linkage with ethics for the

00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:59.090
simple reason--well,
when Dante discusses justice;

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.278
for instance,
in cantos--in Inferno he

00:12:02.278 --> 00:12:05.538
distinguishes between
distributive justice.

00:12:05.538 --> 00:12:10.038
Remember Inferno VII,
the god is fortuna who

00:12:10.038 --> 00:12:15.009
manages to distribute with some
idea of impenetrable occult,

00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:18.710
equity a cold justice the goods
of the Earth,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:24.046
though she's blindfolded and
moves the wheel around so there

00:12:24.046 --> 00:12:28.336
can be some kind of uniform--
If you are up you are not going

00:12:28.336 --> 00:12:30.443
to be up all the time,
you may be down,

00:12:30.443 --> 00:12:33.009
etc., and if you are down you
eventually--

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:36.433
if you are on the shifty curve
of fortune you are going to be

00:12:36.433 --> 00:12:36.720
up.
 

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.668
It's a sort of arithmetical
notion of equity.

00:12:41.668 --> 00:12:45.168
If you have--sometimes you have
five then you lose three and you

00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:47.725
get to have two,
whoever have one will get two,

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:48.168
etc.
 

00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:52.101
The other form of justice was
also geometric justice which

00:12:52.101 --> 00:12:56.240
Dante describes in the so called
rule of the counterpart,

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.904
counter passion,
in the contrapasso in

00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:01.873
Inferno XXVIII when he
has to establish the

00:13:01.873 --> 00:13:04.658
relationship between crime and
punishment.

00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:08.090
It could not be an even one,
one and one;

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.971
you cannot pluck someone's eye
because someone has plucked your

00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:14.350
eye, that's not necessarily
justice.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.017
You cannot cut someone's arm
off because you have perpetrated

00:13:18.017 --> 00:13:21.440
that crime or kill because you
just have been killed,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.389
there should be some kind of
proportionality,

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:24.470
is the argument.
 

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.519
The idea is that geometry is
always part,

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:35.592
geometry in fact is related to
ethics simply because its

00:13:35.592 --> 00:13:44.253
extension always implies a point
which is the beginning of a

00:13:44.253 --> 00:13:49.674
geometric reflection,
always implies the existence of

00:13:49.674 --> 00:13:51.640
other points;
it establishes relations

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.210
therefore.
 

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.058
That's the language.
 

00:13:54.058 --> 00:13:58.379
In this canto Dante discusses
primarily justice.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.519
What is justice?
 

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.808
That's the idea that runs
through this.

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:04.250
The other thing that you have
to be--

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.861
as you read these cantos,
and I hope you read them with

00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:11.121
care,
and I will not say much about

00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:16.720
it, is that he deploys--
Dante deploys the language of

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.500
geometry.
 

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.028
Now you know that this is a
technique of his.

00:14:20.028 --> 00:14:24.729
If he were dealing with
arithmetic he would do music,

00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:28.886
he would do that,
but I just want to give you a

00:14:28.886 --> 00:14:31.870
few examples of these issues.
 

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.727
For instance,
just let me open here and the

00:14:35.727 --> 00:14:38.937
notion of God,
the geometer,

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:43.629
he will go on talking for
instance,

00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:53.264
this is in Canto XIX,
anywhere really,

00:14:53.264 --> 00:14:55.870
line 90.
 

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.885
Look at this,
"The Primal Will,

00:14:57.885 --> 00:14:59.960
which in itself is good,
from itself,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.149
the Supreme Good,
never was moved;

00:15:02.149 --> 00:15:05.808
whatever accords with it is in
that measure just;"

00:15:05.808 --> 00:15:08.957
the language of measure,
"no created good draws it

00:15:08.957 --> 00:15:11.288
to itself, but it,
raying forth";

00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:14.048
"ray,"
which in Italian is both

00:15:14.048 --> 00:15:16.695
radius,
it's the ray of the sunlight

00:15:16.695 --> 00:15:20.950
but also the radius of a circle,
"creates that good.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.350
As the stork circles,"
there it goes,

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.230
even the very shapes,
"circles over the

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.580
nest," and then a little
bit further down,

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.743
"Wheeling,
it sang, then spoke,"

00:15:34.743 --> 00:15:41.669
wheeling again a circular
motion and this continues--

00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:43.899
literally continues throughout.
 

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:53.048
I want to find for you the
image of the compass that I

00:15:53.048 --> 00:15:57.710
thought was in Canto XIX.
 

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.820
It's not, we'll get to that,
we'll find it.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.740
There are a number of these
geometrical terms.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:12.272
However, the most important
thing here in Canto XIX is that

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:19.254
as soon as he enters the heaven
of geometry now we encounter in

00:16:19.254 --> 00:16:24.096
Canto XVIII,
we come across a plane,

00:16:24.096 --> 00:16:30.195
a divine spectacle,
it's a sort of--the heavens are

00:16:30.195 --> 00:16:36.936
a sacred theatre where God will
go on speaking to human beings

00:16:36.936 --> 00:16:43.404
by using to us on Earth--
by using the souls of the

00:16:43.404 --> 00:16:44.620
blessed.
 

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.952
This is the passage,
"I saw,"

00:16:48.952 --> 00:16:53.168
Canto XVIII line 70 and
following,

00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:56.802
"I saw in that torch of
Jove the sparkling of the love

00:16:56.802 --> 00:17:00.470
that was there,
trace out our speech to my eyes;

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.649
and as birds risen from a
river-bank,

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:05.769
as if rejoicing together over
their pasture,

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:08.730
make of themselves,
now a round flock,"

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.210
that's a geometric image for
you,

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.708
"now another shape,
so within the lights holy

00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:18.920
creatures were singing as they
flew and made themselves,

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.401
in the figures they formed,
now D,

00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:26.650
now I,
now L.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.259
First, singing,
they moved to their own notes;

00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:33.226
then, becoming one of these
shapes, they paused for a little

00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:34.838
and were silent."
 

00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:39.489
Within the heaven of geometry,
even the letters of the

00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:44.535
alphabet draw geometrical lines,
the semi-circle of D,

00:17:44.535 --> 00:17:48.578
the two--the perpendicular line
of the L,

00:17:48.578 --> 00:17:51.210
and the perpendicular line of
the I,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.813
we are--we really discover that
the beauty of geometry underlies

00:17:56.813 --> 00:18:00.460
the rigor of the alphabet so to
speak,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.163
but more importantly,
we discover that these souls

00:18:04.163 --> 00:18:08.472
that dispose themselves in
letters are really God's way of

00:18:08.472 --> 00:18:09.910
speaking to us.
 

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.563
The language that Dante--that
God uses is the language of

00:18:14.563 --> 00:18:15.808
human beings.
 

00:18:15.808 --> 00:18:20.029
We are the syllables,
we are the letters disposed in

00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:24.500
order to convey this--whatever
God's message may be.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.692
"They showed themselves,
then, in five times seven

00:18:27.692 --> 00:18:30.800
vowels and consonants,
and I noted them severally,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.829
and what they seemed to me to
mean.

00:18:32.829 --> 00:18:35.029
DILIGITE IUSTITIAM."
 

00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:40.163
They spell out a line taken
from the book--a verse from the

00:18:40.163 --> 00:18:43.220
Book of Wisdom;
love, justice,

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.980
diligite iustitiam,
you who judge the Earth.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:54.454
That's another reference to the
actual ultimate measurement of

00:18:54.454 --> 00:18:56.430
geometry, the Earth.
 

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:01.356
That's the meaning of geometry,
the measuring of the Earth,

00:19:01.356 --> 00:19:05.775
so geography in a certain way
is part of the world of

00:19:05.775 --> 00:19:06.880
geometry.
 

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.288
Then Dante goes on describing a
metamorphosis,

00:19:10.288 --> 00:19:13.536
how "in the M of
the fifth word they kept their

00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:15.665
order,
so that Jupiter seemed there

00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:19.080
silver pricked out with gold;
and I saw other lights descend

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.922
on the very summit of the
M and settle there,

00:19:21.922 --> 00:19:24.540
singing, I think,
of the good that draws them to

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.210
itself.
 

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.528
Then, as when burning logs are
struck rise innumerable sparks,

00:19:29.528 --> 00:19:32.500
from which the foolish are
accustomed to make auguries,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.897
so more than a thousand lights
appeared to rise again from

00:19:35.897 --> 00:19:38.681
there and to mount,
some much, some little,

00:19:38.681 --> 00:19:41.240
as the Sun that kindles them
appointed;

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.558
and when each had settled in
its place,"

00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:42.740
etc.
 

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.417
I know that some of you are
working on the aesthetics of

00:19:46.417 --> 00:19:49.324
colors;
I would point out this scene to

00:19:49.324 --> 00:19:52.000
you and the complications of
color.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.808
The white of Jupiter,
the gold of the letters,

00:19:54.808 --> 00:20:01.450
the red of the flames,
there is a kind of chromatic--

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:06.250
a deployment of chromatic
elements within this grand

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.380
spectacle.
 

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:13.135
Dante is indicating directly
and indirectly this chromatic

00:20:13.135 --> 00:20:17.452
symbolism,
so this is what we--the way the

00:20:17.452 --> 00:20:21.519
heavens speak to us on Earth and
to the--

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:27.611
and the rulers of the Earth and
then Dante goes on in the next

00:20:27.611 --> 00:20:32.339
Canto XIX,
wondering what is this idea of

00:20:32.339 --> 00:20:33.369
justice.
 

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:35.309
What does it mean?
 

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:44.748
He'll ask, Canto XIX,
line 28, "I know well that

00:20:44.748 --> 00:20:50.228
though the Divine Justice is
mirrored in another realm of

00:20:50.228 --> 00:20:54.730
heaven yours apprehends it
without a veil.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.065
You know with what intentness I
am prepared to listen,

00:20:59.065 --> 00:21:03.891
you know what is that doubt
which is old a fast in me."

00:21:03.891 --> 00:21:07.923
He's hungry;
Dante's hungry to know what

00:21:07.923 --> 00:21:09.838
Divine Justice is.
 

00:21:09.838 --> 00:21:19.920
What we hear is the bird,
the eagle goes on saying,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.907
"He that turned His
compass,"

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:26.256
that's God,
that's the geometer,

00:21:26.256 --> 00:21:31.759
an image that clearly echoes
two biblical texts.

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:35.708
One is of Job 38,
a famous passage,

00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:38.380
some of you may know.
 

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.318
Dante returns to it repeatedly.
 

00:21:40.318 --> 00:21:44.541
"Where were you when I
drew the boundaries of the

00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:47.650
Earth," that's the
geometrical,

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:57.157
the matrix so to speak,
of this metaphor of God the

00:21:57.157 --> 00:21:59.250
geometer.
 

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:05.007
And the other one is in the
Book of Wisdom that goes on

00:22:05.007 --> 00:22:09.163
talking about,
"I was there with him and

00:22:09.163 --> 00:22:13.695
I was His delight when He was
drawing the circle around the

00:22:13.695 --> 00:22:14.788
deep."
 

00:22:14.788 --> 00:22:20.074
Those are two biblical passages
that insist on this-- both the

00:22:20.074 --> 00:22:22.759
geometric and then aesthetic.
 

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:27.299
A theatre, the idea that
through the shapes of the world

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:32.006
are really the representations
of this perfection of God's

00:22:32.006 --> 00:22:33.078
geometry.
 

00:22:33.078 --> 00:22:36.098
They are two metaphors that
Dante goes on deploying but

00:22:36.098 --> 00:22:39.118
let's see what the substance of
the argument now is.

00:22:39.118 --> 00:22:41.474
"He that turned his
compass,"

00:22:41.474 --> 00:22:45.069
we understand why he uses the
word compass and the image of

00:22:45.069 --> 00:22:46.930
the compass, that's clear.
 

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.029
"Not remain in infinite
excess,"

00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:53.886
that's to me another
geometrical language though the

00:22:53.886 --> 00:22:58.575
two words are slightly redundant
because excess means something

00:22:58.575 --> 00:23:00.920
which is measure or less.
 

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:07.108
The language of measure,
the language of accounting,

00:23:07.108 --> 00:23:11.288
and the language of limits is
set against this idea of

00:23:11.288 --> 00:23:15.253
something not finite,
something that escapes the

00:23:15.253 --> 00:23:19.058
logic of geometry,
the logic of measurement,

00:23:19.058 --> 00:23:21.180
an infinite and excess.
 

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.105
In fact, I find the phrase
deliberately redundant,

00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:29.673
it's not only infinite but it's
also excessive idea of the

00:23:29.673 --> 00:23:32.640
infinite to drive the point
home;

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.438
"and manifest,
could not make His Power to be

00:23:36.438 --> 00:23:39.848
so impressed on that whole
universe."

00:23:39.848 --> 00:23:43.824
Even the word universe is--as
much as a poetic term we speak

00:23:43.824 --> 00:23:47.596
of verse in poetry and I wonder
how many of you have ever

00:23:47.596 --> 00:23:51.480
wondered whether that stuff--
that word comes from?

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.009
It comes from geometry because
it implies a turning.

00:23:54.009 --> 00:23:56.450
You come to the end of the line
and you turn,

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.167
and you draw a geometrical
figure, and so does the

00:23:59.167 --> 00:23:59.890
universe.
 

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.483
It's one turning,
it's the sphere,

00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:06.886
you can have hemispheres but
the two hemispheres make the

00:24:06.886 --> 00:24:07.910
universe.
 

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.846
These are all,
as you see--I hope you enjoy

00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:16.160
them as I enjoy them telling you
about this.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.185
"And, in proof of this,
the first proud spirit,"

00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:23.153
Lucifer,
now that's geometry of the

00:24:23.153 --> 00:24:28.230
soul, the first proud spirit who
was--

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.919
as you know Dante connects
pride and geometry or

00:24:31.919 --> 00:24:34.509
perspective, as we said before.
 

00:24:34.509 --> 00:24:38.538
"The first proud spirit,
who was in the highest of all

00:24:38.538 --> 00:24:42.500
creatures, fair and ripe,"
what a great adjective.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:50.509
Lucifer falls unripe because
grace implies ripeness.

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:55.382
The idea that you are ripe when
you have been touched by grace,

00:24:55.382 --> 00:24:59.782
ripeness is all one could say
using another--referring to

00:24:59.782 --> 00:25:02.220
another text,
not by Dante.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.509
"Through not waiting for
light," that's Lucifer,

00:25:05.509 --> 00:25:08.810
"from which it is plain
that every lesser nature is too

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.609
scant a vessel for that good
which has no limit and

00:25:11.609 --> 00:25:13.960
measures,"
I'm not going indicate that

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.308
anymore,
"itself by itself.

00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:19.327
Thus our vision,
which must needs be one of the

00:25:19.327 --> 00:25:22.608
rays of the Mind of which all
things are full,

00:25:22.608 --> 00:25:24.988
cannot by its nature be of such
power that it should not

00:25:24.988 --> 00:25:27.670
perceive its origin to be far
beyond all that appears to it.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.470
Therefore,"
and that seems to be the

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.474
essence,
the brunt of the argument,

00:25:35.474 --> 00:25:39.492
"the sight that is granted
to your world penetrates within

00:25:39.492 --> 00:25:42.538
the Eternal Justice as the eye
into the sea;

00:25:42.538 --> 00:25:46.166
for though from the shore it
sees the bottom,

00:25:46.166 --> 00:25:51.030
in the open sea it does not,
and yet the bottom is there but

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.670
the depth conceals it."
 

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:58.259
The idea that we can see
justice only when we have a very

00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:01.818
superficial,
we see just as we see the

00:26:01.818 --> 00:26:06.200
bottom of the sea when we are
near the shore,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.528
only when we have a superficial
understanding of--

00:26:10.528 --> 00:26:13.528
do we see the bottom otherwise
we don't.

00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:19.983
God's justice is as
imponderable and unfathomable as

00:26:19.983 --> 00:26:26.440
the sea floor can be out
in--away from the shore.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.637
"There is no light there
but that which comes from the

00:26:28.637 --> 00:26:30.230
clear," and so on and the
changes--

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:35.051
then Dante complicates the
issue a little bit and he really

00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:37.380
asks where is the justice.
 

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.891
Is justice limited to a place,
to a continent,

00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:47.805
to the economy of Christian
Europe, and how is it related to

00:26:47.805 --> 00:26:49.509
other places?
 

00:26:49.509 --> 00:26:54.230
We have a notion of what
nowadays we call alterity;

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.280
you must have heard that term,
"the other,"

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.690
the idea of the other.
 

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.868
In the Middle Ages,
by the way, it was not alien to

00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:03.650
this thought of the other.
 

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:10.483
I can give you a few titles of
Aquinas writing a track against

00:27:10.483 --> 00:27:15.690
the errors of the Greeks;
that's a sense of idleness.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.460
Establishing,
that is to say differences,

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.961
or Aquinas writing a
suma against the

00:27:20.961 --> 00:27:23.491
Gentiles,
the pagans who usually--who

00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:26.480
actually were the philosophers
of the time.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.047
Those who do not have excess or
exceed or want to exceed to

00:27:31.047 --> 00:27:32.150
Revelations.
 

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.848
They have an idea of otherness
and the idea of otherness is

00:27:34.848 --> 00:27:37.548
always that of acknowledging
that particular difference.

00:27:37.548 --> 00:27:40.063
I do not see,
at this point yet,

00:27:40.063 --> 00:27:44.846
any substantial deviation on
the part of Dante from the myth

00:27:44.846 --> 00:27:48.088
and the examples of the heroic
life.

00:27:48.088 --> 00:27:51.516
The examples of the heroic life
are those who literally

00:27:51.516 --> 00:27:54.972
establish boundaries,
who within those boundaries

00:27:54.972 --> 00:27:59.200
manage to live according to the
fullness of their virtues.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.057
That's the heroic life and
that's really the boundary that

00:28:02.057 --> 00:28:02.910
he establishes.
 

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.490
Now Dante asks what is that
boundary.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.962
I understand that Divine
Justice is impenetrable but then

00:28:11.962 --> 00:28:17.338
he asks this extraordinary
question, what is a place?

00:28:17.338 --> 00:28:21.410
This was a--a man is born at
the bank of the Indus,

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.864
line 72, I think this is the
most complex and the most

00:28:25.864 --> 00:28:30.150
extraordinary question in the
whole of the Divine

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:35.950
Comedy from the point of the
awareness of let's say alterity.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.987
"A man is born on the bank
of Indus,"

00:28:39.987 --> 00:28:43.097
Asia,
"and none is there to

00:28:43.097 --> 00:28:46.259
speak,
or read, or write of Christ,

00:28:46.259 --> 00:28:51.531
and all his desires and doings
are good so far as human reason

00:28:51.531 --> 00:28:55.470
sees,
without sin in life or speech.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.900
He dies unbaptized and without
faith.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.318
Where is this justice that
condemns him?

00:29:03.318 --> 00:29:07.048
Where is his fault if he does
not believe?

00:29:07.048 --> 00:29:11.497
Now, who art thou that wouldst
sit upon the bench and judge a

00:29:11.497 --> 00:29:15.130
thousand miles away,"
more geometry here,

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:20.130
more space, more distance comes
to be not only one of depth,

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.752
now one of huge distances in
space "with a site short of

00:29:24.752 --> 00:29:25.910
a span."
 

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.444
The span, by the way,
it's a great--it's a

00:29:29.444 --> 00:29:32.548
measurement, a geometric term
too.

00:29:32.548 --> 00:29:36.151
That's the span,
the distance that goes from the

00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:40.058
tip of the thumb to the tip of
the little finger.

00:29:40.058 --> 00:29:43.989
This is technically Italian,
spanna and the English

00:29:43.989 --> 00:29:45.920
is span, it comes from it.
 

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.320
"Assuredly,
for him that would reason it

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.762
out with me,
if the Scriptures were not set

00:29:50.762 --> 00:29:53.794
over you there would be abundant
room for question,"

00:29:53.794 --> 00:29:56.880
and then he goes on talking and
as the storks circle,

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:03.557
and Dante's clearly circling
of--himself over these issues

00:30:03.557 --> 00:30:09.588
and we have a return to Europe,
the whole of Europe now appears.

00:30:09.588 --> 00:30:16.910
The whole of canto's [line]
100 until the end;

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.490
let me just read this passage
where,

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:23.125
the eagle, the Roman symbol,
Dante goes out of the way to

00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:25.276
say,
"When these shining fires

00:30:25.276 --> 00:30:29.653
of the Holy Ghost had paused,
still in the sign that made the

00:30:29.653 --> 00:30:33.580
Romans reverend to the world,
it began again,"

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.680
with allusions therefore to the
Romans as if to--

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.703
as a kind of idea,
Rome to Dante has become an

00:30:40.703 --> 00:30:44.170
idea,
an idea of universality.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.239
"To this kingdom none ever
rose who did not believe in

00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:52.380
Christ, either before or after
He was nailed to the tree.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.476
But note, many cry
Christ,

00:30:54.476 --> 00:30:55.588
Christ !
 

00:30:55.588 --> 00:30:59.761
who shall be far less near to
Him at the Judgment than such as

00:30:59.761 --> 00:31:02.838
know not Christ,
and such Christians."

00:31:02.838 --> 00:31:07.160
The Ethiopians,
Africa is being mentioned,

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.248
"shall condemn when the
two companies are parted…

00:31:10.248 --> 00:31:12.720
What can the Persians,"
Asia once again,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.950
the three continents are going
to be--

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.148
there are divisions of belief
now and these divisions of

00:31:19.148 --> 00:31:23.347
belief seem to lose all
consistency because you may be a

00:31:23.347 --> 00:31:27.700
European and there is a moral
alterity within Europe.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.849
Alterity is not just a question
of geographic disposition.

00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:36.213
It's not part of the economy;
someone who is a Persian is

00:31:36.213 --> 00:31:38.875
other me;
it is, but there is in terms of

00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:41.673
the moral life,
clearly there is an alterity

00:31:41.673 --> 00:31:42.779
within Europe.
 

00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:46.019
In fact Dante does not--he
starts with a Kingdom of Prague,

00:31:46.019 --> 00:31:49.654
lines 118, "Albert…
by which the Kingdom [of

00:31:49.654 --> 00:31:52.032
Prague]
shall be made desolate,"

00:31:52.032 --> 00:31:54.598
and then to France,
then shall be the seen the

00:31:54.598 --> 00:31:55.730
misery brought on this."
 

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.173
Count all the countries;
by the way, he seems to know

00:31:58.173 --> 00:32:00.238
the history of,
"on the Seine from the

00:32:00.238 --> 00:32:02.767
debasement of the currency by
him that shall die from the

00:32:02.767 --> 00:32:03.670
charge of a boar.
 

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.371
There shall be seen the pride
that makes men thirst and so

00:32:07.371 --> 00:32:10.439
maddens the Scot,
and the Englishman that neither

00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:12.380
can keep within his
bounds."

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.913
There is a history of violence
that transgresses also

00:32:15.913 --> 00:32:19.855
boundaries, and that can be
violence, and I will give you a

00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:21.759
little story about that.
 

00:32:21.759 --> 00:32:25.095
"It will show the
wantonness and soft living of

00:32:25.095 --> 00:32:27.972
him of Spain,
and of him of Bohemia who never

00:32:27.972 --> 00:32:29.868
knew worth nor sought it.
 

00:32:29.868 --> 00:32:32.983
It will show for the Cripple of
Jerusalem his goodness marked

00:32:32.983 --> 00:32:35.474
with an I,
while an M will mark the

00:32:35.474 --> 00:32:36.150
opposite.
 

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.204
It will show the avarice and
cowardice of him that holds the

00:32:39.204 --> 00:32:41.068
island of the fire,"
Sicily,

00:32:41.068 --> 00:32:44.348
"where Anchises ended his
long life;

00:32:44.348 --> 00:32:47.452
and to make plain his
insignificance his records shall

00:32:47.452 --> 00:32:50.788
be in contractions that will
note much in little space;

00:32:50.788 --> 00:32:54.173
and manifest to all shall be
the foul deeds of his uncle and

00:32:54.173 --> 00:32:57.557
his brother, by whom a lineage
so illustrious and two crowns

00:32:57.557 --> 00:33:01.285
have been dishonoured;
and he of Portugal and he of

00:33:01.285 --> 00:33:05.152
Norway shall be known there,
and he of Russia,"

00:33:05.152 --> 00:33:08.458
meaning literally Russia,
"who to his own hurt has

00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:09.818
been the coin of Venice.
 

00:33:09.818 --> 00:33:12.603
'Oh happy Hungary,"
the irony is heavy,

00:33:12.603 --> 00:33:15.710
"if she no longer let
herself be wronged!

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.776
And happy Navarre,
if she arm herself with the

00:33:18.776 --> 00:33:20.818
mountains that surround her!
 

00:33:20.818 --> 00:33:23.808
And, for earnest of this,
all men shall know that Nicosia

00:33:23.808 --> 00:33:26.798
and Famagosta lament and
complain of their own beast,

00:33:26.798 --> 00:33:28.430
which keeps its place beside
the rest.'"

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.917
The whole of Europe,
this is now the history of

00:33:30.917 --> 00:33:33.200
Europe,
in a way that Dante has given

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.115
the history of the empire,
Roman Empire,

00:33:36.115 --> 00:33:40.776
but this is the history of
Europe and a history of

00:33:40.776 --> 00:33:44.200
desolation and moral
dereliction.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:51.348
These are the terms of--what is
here and what is there?

00:33:51.348 --> 00:33:53.578
What is within an economy of
redemption?

00:33:53.578 --> 00:33:56.048
What is not out of the economy
of redemption?

00:33:56.048 --> 00:34:00.787
This is exactly the question
that Dante asks and the answer

00:34:00.787 --> 00:34:02.828
is that we do not know.
 

00:34:02.828 --> 00:34:08.789
We do not know how this
salvation is going to work out.

00:34:08.789 --> 00:34:13.050
No one can claim,
therefore, to decide what exact

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:18.110
moral boundaries can exist
between a place and another.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:24.449
That seems to be the idea that
he tempers therefore the notion,

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:26.356
on the one hand,
the idea of boundaries and on

00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:29.949
the other hand,
there is also this notion that

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:35.235
boundaries are political but
they are not nor can they be

00:34:35.235 --> 00:34:39.010
thought of as being moral
boundaries;

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:42.860
so he distinguishes the two
issues.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.949
What is his answer?
 

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.239
What is he trying to say?
 

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:48.027
Before I try to tell you about
this, let me tell you about a

00:34:48.027 --> 00:34:50.626
little text that has nothing to
do with the Middle Ages,

00:34:50.626 --> 00:34:52.280
but I'm sure you know the text.
 

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.869
It's that little story that
Herodotus,

00:34:55.869 --> 00:35:00.780
who is a great Greek historian,
tells this story in the

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.199
Histories,
in the year before the Greeks

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:09.768
are getting ready to invade
Egypt, going to Egypt.

00:35:09.768 --> 00:35:15.630
He really writes the story to
warn them about what the dangers

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:21.492
that they might be surprised by
or the dangers wherever you go

00:35:21.492 --> 00:35:26.489
across boundaries that-- and
violate boundaries.

00:35:26.489 --> 00:35:29.639
It's really an argument in
favor of boundaries.

00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:34.059
And he tells the story of a
king, the King of Egypt,

00:35:34.059 --> 00:35:37.730
Calloderus, I think his name is
who was,

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:43.010
who not a very sharp man,
a very bright man,

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.329
not only was he not a very
bright man,

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:47.983
he also had a very beautiful
wife and he was so taken with

00:35:47.983 --> 00:35:52.882
the beauty of his wife that he
wanted everybody to know about

00:35:52.882 --> 00:35:57.768
it but he can't tell everybody;
but he tells his advisor and

00:35:57.768 --> 00:36:00.449
his advisor was a very prudent
man,

00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:02.695
says, "sire,
your majesty I don't want to

00:36:02.695 --> 00:36:04.891
know, I believe you,
don't tell me more about

00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:05.639
this."
 

00:36:05.639 --> 00:36:08.547
"But you've got to know,
you've got to hear me,

00:36:08.547 --> 00:36:11.855
because you know not only you
got hear me I want you to see

00:36:11.855 --> 00:36:13.679
the naked beauty of my wife.
 

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:17.728
It's beyond belief and I want
you to see it because human

00:36:17.728 --> 00:36:21.777
beings tend to trust their eyes
more than what they hear,

00:36:21.777 --> 00:36:24.018
more than their ears."
 

00:36:24.018 --> 00:36:28.518
We don't really believe what we
hear, but what we see is direct

00:36:28.518 --> 00:36:31.059
and we want to have access to
it.

00:36:31.059 --> 00:36:35.170
The counselor very prudently
says,

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.487
"no sire,
this is really too much

00:36:36.487 --> 00:36:38.467
trouble,
I cannot disobey you but you

00:36:38.467 --> 00:36:40.679
are forcing me to really insist
that--

00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:43.509
I believe you completely,
you can go on telling me about

00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:45.440
her beauty,
I don't want to see it."

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.519
"No, I'm arranging
this" and he contrives a

00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:49.349
little plot.
 

00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:53.860
The wife has to go bathing in a
room next to the bedroom.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:58.050
He, the King,
leaves the door ajar,

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.550
open for her to come in the
bedroom door,

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.170
and so while she's away he
allows the counselor to hide in

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:11.130
the shadows of the room,
in a little corner.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.817
The queen comes in,
undresses, the counselor sees

00:37:15.817 --> 00:37:21.969
her naked and very quickly walks
out, hoping silently and hoping

00:37:21.969 --> 00:37:24.510
not to have been seen.
 

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:30.541
The morning after the queen was
a sharp queen calls him into her

00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:33.384
office and says,
"I saw you,

00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:36.010
tell me what you were doing
there."

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:42.215
The counselor has no choice but
saying, "your majesty the

00:37:42.215 --> 00:37:46.081
king, your husband,
asked me to come in

00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:47.710
there."
 

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:51.074
The queen says,
"I imagined that that's

00:37:51.074 --> 00:37:56.003
really what happened but at this
point one of you two is one too

00:37:56.003 --> 00:37:57.489
much--too many.
 

00:37:57.489 --> 00:38:01.420
One of you--either you kill the
king or you kill yourself.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.472
The idea that I have been
ashamed and been seen naked by

00:38:06.472 --> 00:38:09.780
two men is unbearable to
me."

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:16.914
And the counselor does what I'm
sure all of you would do,

00:38:16.914 --> 00:38:19.590
he became the king.
 

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.465
By the way, Herodotus goes on
even saying, that he lived a

00:38:23.465 --> 00:38:26.775
very undistinguished life;
it was not a big deal,

00:38:26.775 --> 00:38:30.550
but he's warning,
Herodotus is really warning us

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:34.650
to understand that there is
always a limit to--

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:38.980
that we have to set up and
protect between what we say me,

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.768
or mine, I, and what I say you,
this is the language that Dante

00:38:42.768 --> 00:38:44.969
uses at the beginning of Canto
XX.

00:38:44.969 --> 00:38:48.813
They say "I and mine"
when they mean "we and

00:38:48.813 --> 00:38:52.177
our";
this is a very thin line that

00:38:52.177 --> 00:38:53.949
has to be observed.
 

00:38:53.949 --> 00:38:57.043
The king, of course,
just to finish that little

00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:59.030
story,
the king was a fool,

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:02.335
he had no prudence,
he had no sense of the

00:39:02.335 --> 00:39:07.230
difference between the private
life and the public needs.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.376
He had no idea that there are
things that you keep to yourself

00:39:10.376 --> 00:39:12.130
and you don't share with others.
 

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:17.090
One can go on complicating the
problem but the issue is that he

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.690
understood limits.
 

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:23.221
You are going on into another
man's country you have to act as

00:39:23.221 --> 00:39:26.489
if you don't have to go too deep
into it,

00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:28.809
and you don't have to try to
violate its--

00:39:28.809 --> 00:39:34.150
a country's a woman's nakedness
meaning the essential--

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.929
the private sense of oneself.
 

00:39:36.929 --> 00:39:41.989
I do not know that Dante would
really agree with Herodotus in

00:39:41.989 --> 00:39:45.485
these cantos,
but what he has been doing is

00:39:45.485 --> 00:39:49.260
literally setting up a needed
cultural difference.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:53.356
Somehow there is a--they exist,
cultural differences,

00:39:53.356 --> 00:39:58.081
and at the same time allow for
a kind of moral circulation of

00:39:58.081 --> 00:39:58.869
ideas.
 

00:39:58.869 --> 00:40:02.728
Let me put in general medieval
terms to tell you what I think

00:40:02.728 --> 00:40:05.429
he has been doing because the
argument--

00:40:05.429 --> 00:40:09.369
when he makes this argument a
man is born on the river of the

00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:12.271
Indus,
he does not know anything about

00:40:12.271 --> 00:40:16.188
Christian faith and baptism,
dies, why should he be

00:40:16.188 --> 00:40:17.409
condemned, etc.
 

00:40:17.409 --> 00:40:20.856
He has been living decorously
and rationally,

00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:23.130
why should he be not saved?
 

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.059
That's the question he asks.
 

00:40:25.059 --> 00:40:29.764
What he is taking on there
would seem to be what we call,

00:40:29.764 --> 00:40:34.050
in medieval terms,
a Pelagian, a Pelagian stance.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.360
You know now,
I think I have said before,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.985
but let me just repeat this,
Pelagian is an adjective that

00:40:40.985 --> 00:40:44.039
comes from the name of a British
monk of the--

00:40:44.039 --> 00:40:45.628
roughly the time of St.
 

00:40:45.628 --> 00:40:48.389
Augustine, the fifth century
Pelagius,

00:40:48.389 --> 00:40:51.690
who really maintained that by
the exercise of--

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.516
through works,
through good works human

00:40:54.516 --> 00:40:58.023
beings,
living according to principles

00:40:58.023 --> 00:41:01.159
of nature,
human beings can be saved.

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:04.132
It would seem almost that
Dante's taking that position

00:41:04.132 --> 00:41:06.114
to--
a position by the way which he

00:41:06.114 --> 00:41:09.072
probably even held in the
philosophical text called the

00:41:09.072 --> 00:41:10.059
Banquet.
 

00:41:10.059 --> 00:41:13.110
That was one of--it's one of
either--

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:18.146
I don't agree with that but
it's--there seems to be such an

00:41:18.146 --> 00:41:23.532
emphasis on the ability of human
beings to live rationally that

00:41:23.532 --> 00:41:28.483
the demands of grace and the
demands of faith are somewhat

00:41:28.483 --> 00:41:31.349
bracketed and a little dim.
 

00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:33.170
Nonetheless,
I think that they are there,

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.130
only that he is talking as a
philosopher.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:39.126
The issue is this--that Dante
here is asking for a

00:41:39.126 --> 00:41:42.715
conversation between philosophy
and theology,

00:41:42.715 --> 00:41:45.000
within reason and faith.
 

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.190
In the sense that,
he really understands that

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:55.284
philosophy without theology ends
up in a sort of labyrinth of its

00:41:55.284 --> 00:41:59.380
own constructions and may lose
the way.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.557
In theology,
without philosophy,

00:42:02.557 --> 00:42:08.094
may end up in mere opinion
which has no validity at all

00:42:08.094 --> 00:42:13.630
on--for people who believe in
the power of reason.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:17.701
Now, to connect it with the
previous cantos,

00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:23.099
I think that Dante has been
literally extending this whole

00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:26.130
problem about what exile is.
 

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:31.340
An exile, which does not mean
the random movement,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:38.519
but always a kind of--a sense
of the problematical qualities

00:42:38.519 --> 00:42:45.945
of a place in the world and the
relationship that we have with

00:42:45.945 --> 00:42:49.840
ourselves and our own ideas.
 

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.820
I know that this is starting to
get--

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:56.382
that I--it has taken me away
from the other cantos but let me

00:42:56.382 --> 00:43:00.641
just read XXI and the cantos and
I just want to turn very

00:43:00.641 --> 00:43:04.572
briefly--
I don't think that XXI and XXII

00:43:04.572 --> 00:43:07.989
which are cantos where Dante
meets.

00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:12.840
It's the Sphere of Saturn,
which as you know,

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.480
is the heaven of contemplation.
 

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:22.494
The word Saturn--the myth of
Saturn is the myth of time

00:43:22.494 --> 00:43:28.510
devouring everything that it
engenders that's what--

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.949
remember that time is the first
cannibal of history,

00:43:31.949 --> 00:43:33.849
eating up what it produces.
 

00:43:33.849 --> 00:43:36.860
This is the minutes that are
just taken in.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.380
It's--the name seems to come
from the saturation of time.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:45.447
Dante is coming to--this is the
last planet and it's also the

00:43:45.447 --> 00:43:48.835
heaven of astronomy,
so he's forcing on us the idea

00:43:48.835 --> 00:43:50.260
of contemplation.
 

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.956
Here he finds the
contemplatives and among them

00:43:53.956 --> 00:43:58.539
there is the soul of a founder
by the name of Benedict.

00:43:58.539 --> 00:44:02.639
The first from the
contemplative order.

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:06.219
The word contemplation really
implies two things if you ask

00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:08.318
"what is a
contemplation"

00:44:08.318 --> 00:44:11.775
because there is always a
debate as to whether Dante is a

00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:13.697
mystic,
or he's not a mystic,

00:44:13.697 --> 00:44:16.369
I think that if there is
anything that he has it's--

00:44:16.369 --> 00:44:19.889
he's a contemplative in the
true sense of the word.

00:44:19.889 --> 00:44:23.648
The word contemplation
translates the Greek theory

00:44:23.648 --> 00:44:28.559
which is really the turning of
the mind toward the essentials;

00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:31.121
theory, a contemplation.
 

00:44:31.121 --> 00:44:35.070
The word comes from
templum,

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.989
contemplation which is,
as you know,

00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:42.215
the Latin word for temple,
but also from the Latin word

00:44:42.215 --> 00:44:45.659
for tempus,
they are the same word.

00:44:45.659 --> 00:44:50.224
The word for temple and the
word for time have the same

00:44:50.224 --> 00:44:52.838
origin,
and they both come from the

00:44:52.838 --> 00:44:56.824
Greek word called temno,
the Greek work is temno,

00:44:56.824 --> 00:44:58.710
which means "to cut."
 

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:03.876
Saturn, time, with a side cuts;
the contemplatives are those

00:45:03.876 --> 00:45:07.360
who cut a space of time and
privilege it,

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.300
or a space in place,
and cut it off from the flow of

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:18.112
history and the flow of profane
place and make it the sort of

00:45:18.112 --> 00:45:23.730
ground for turning the minds to
the consideration of higher

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.989
things.
 

00:45:24.989 --> 00:45:28.469
This is the point that Dante is
driving.

00:45:28.469 --> 00:45:32.632
He is going to discuss the
degeneracy of the order but I

00:45:32.632 --> 00:45:37.099
want to really end with you and
I really meant to talk about

00:45:37.099 --> 00:45:41.869
this final image at the end of
Canto XXII where Dante now--

00:45:41.869 --> 00:45:46.045
has really reached the
periphery of the planetary

00:45:46.045 --> 00:45:49.318
system;
now he will go into the stars,

00:45:49.318 --> 00:45:51.889
the heaven of the fixed stars.
 

00:45:51.889 --> 00:45:55.469
We have a little bit of time so
I can go slow here.

00:45:55.469 --> 00:46:03.969
Lines--Canto XXII,
lines, let's say 126;

00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:07.175
this is Beatrice speaking,
"'Thou art so near to the

00:46:07.175 --> 00:46:09.349
final blessedness,' Beatrice
began,

00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:13.550
'that thou must have thine eyes
clear and keen."

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:20.760
That's--Dante's--he will deploy
this language of visionariness,

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:26.052
and the language of
visionariness will start with

00:46:26.052 --> 00:46:32.891
the emphasis on purifying one's
and refining one's own eyes and

00:46:32.891 --> 00:46:35.980
one's physical eyesight.
 

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:39.342
"Therefore,
before you go farther into it,

00:46:39.342 --> 00:46:40.659
look down."
 

00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:45.755
Beatrice, it's one of the two
invitations by Beatrice now to

00:46:45.755 --> 00:46:49.130
turn back--
to turn the eyes back and have

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:52.771
a contemplation,
and Dante will contemplate so

00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:57.079
to speak the Earth,
not up where the heavens turn.

00:46:57.079 --> 00:46:59.838
"Therefore,
before you go farther into it

00:46:59.838 --> 00:47:03.579
to look down and see how much of
the universe I've already put

00:47:03.579 --> 00:47:06.934
beneath thy feet,
so that with all fulness of joy

00:47:06.934 --> 00:47:10.817
thy heart may present itself to
the triumphal host that comes

00:47:10.817 --> 00:47:13.469
rejoicing through this rounded
ether.'

00:47:13.469 --> 00:47:17.411
With my sight,"
Dante now is engaged in this

00:47:17.411 --> 00:47:20.860
retrospective glance down to the
Earth,

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.699
"I returned through every
one of the seven spheres,

00:47:23.699 --> 00:47:27.230
and I saw this globe such that
I smiled,"

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.722
our Earth,
"at its paltry

00:47:29.722 --> 00:47:31.039
semblance."
 

00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:37.929
The perspective is that of
space.

00:47:37.929 --> 00:47:41.168
I wouldn't call it infinite
space but a vast distance of

00:47:41.168 --> 00:47:41.639
space.
 

00:47:41.639 --> 00:47:44.835
I don't call it infinite space
because Dante's notion of the

00:47:44.835 --> 00:47:46.840
universe is not that it's
infinite.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:54.791
Dante has the notion of the
universe as a bounded but vast

00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:58.139
connect--vast enclave.
 

00:47:58.139 --> 00:48:00.710
It's really like a book,
that's the image that he uses.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.527
"And that judgment which
holds it for least,

00:48:03.527 --> 00:48:06.346
I approve as best,
and he whose thought is on the

00:48:06.346 --> 00:48:08.929
other things may rightly be
called just.

00:48:08.929 --> 00:48:12.567
I saw Latonia's daughter,"
the Moon, "growing,

00:48:12.567 --> 00:48:16.668
without that shadow for which I
once believed her to be rare or

00:48:16.668 --> 00:48:18.969
dense;
thy son's aspect,

00:48:18.969 --> 00:48:23.827
Hyperion, I endured there,
and I saw how Maia and Dione

00:48:23.827 --> 00:48:27.449
move in their circles,"
meaning Mercury,

00:48:27.449 --> 00:48:30.300
"near him;
from thence appeared to me the

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.367
tempering of Jove,
between his father and his son,

00:48:33.367 --> 00:48:36.675
and from thence the changes
were clear to me which they make

00:48:36.675 --> 00:48:40.123
in their positions;
and all seven showed me what is

00:48:40.123 --> 00:48:44.195
their magnitude and what their
speed, and at what distance

00:48:44.195 --> 00:48:45.909
their stations."
 

00:48:45.909 --> 00:48:49.730
We have an astronomy here,
the heaven of astronomy,

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:53.099
but we have an astronomy which
is indicated mythically,

00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:57.306
and not only mythically but
also through a process of

00:48:57.306 --> 00:49:01.452
affiliation;
it's the daughter of Latonia,

00:49:01.452 --> 00:49:05.735
the son of Hyperion,
a process of affiliation,

00:49:05.735 --> 00:49:10.686
it's really as if the universe
itself has followed the logic of

00:49:10.686 --> 00:49:13.719
generation of production as
being--

00:49:13.719 --> 00:49:19.599
producing and reproducing
itself and then he continues,

00:49:19.599 --> 00:49:22.289
Dante goes back to looking at
the Earth.

00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:26.244
"All seven showed to me
what is the magnitude and what

00:49:26.244 --> 00:49:29.789
their speed, and at what
distances their stations.

00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:33.942
The little threshing-floor that
makes us so fierce all appeared

00:49:33.942 --> 00:49:36.085
to me from hills to
river-mouths,

00:49:36.085 --> 00:49:39.300
while I was wheeling with the
eternal Twins.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.829
Then to the fair eyes I turned
my eyes again."

00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:48.300
I want to draw your attention
to line 151,

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.032
where Dante says,
"The little

00:49:50.032 --> 00:49:53.289
threshing-floor that makes us so
fierce all appeared to me,

00:49:53.289 --> 00:49:59.070
l'aiuola che ci fa tanto
feroci."

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.650
"Ci fa,"
look at that line,

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.789
look at it, "to me from
little hills,

00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:06.713
to little mountains while I was
wheeling with the eternal

00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:07.550
Twins."
 

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:15.987
Dante, in many ways has now--
that's part of his view of

00:50:15.987 --> 00:50:17.829
astronomy.
 

00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:22.000
He's giving his horoscope
indirectly here.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.682
This idea of the Twins being
the sign under which he was

00:50:27.682 --> 00:50:29.989
born,
it doesn't really imply any

00:50:29.989 --> 00:50:33.795
astrological lapse on his part,
it's now that he can be free

00:50:33.795 --> 00:50:36.860
and he has determined the
limitations of--

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.672
astrological determinations he
can go on alluding to his birth

00:50:40.672 --> 00:50:41.110
sign.
 

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:45.394
I want to draw--I just want to
draw the attention to this whole

00:50:45.394 --> 00:50:49.266
point about the "ci"
where Dante says "the

00:50:49.266 --> 00:50:52.860
little threshing-floor that
makes us so fierce,"

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:58.130
because for all its distance,
Dante says, distance as it can

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:03.226
be--for all the distance which
is implied by this poetic

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:06.663
fiction,
he's distant from the Earth as

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:07.670
he ever was.
 

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:11.592
This pronoun,
ci, us,

00:51:11.592 --> 00:51:17.840
the pronoun strains to have it
both ways;

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.130
on the one hand Dante asserts
distance,

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:27.460
the claim of a perspective of
eternity on the world and--

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:31.429
but he does not,
that's the other way,

00:51:31.429 --> 00:51:38.597
he does not want to surrender
his place in time and in

00:51:38.597 --> 00:51:39.949
history.
 

00:51:39.949 --> 00:51:44.871
He is part of us so at the end
of all this great gyration

00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:49.681
through the universe,
Dante again claims and reclaims

00:51:49.681 --> 00:51:54.737
for himself a place with us in
the world of history and the

00:51:54.737 --> 00:51:56.219
world of time.
 

00:51:56.219 --> 00:52:00.704
The synthesis of the two,
the claim of eternity and the

00:52:00.704 --> 00:52:05.936
sense of contingency of the self
in time is the ultimate goal of

00:52:05.936 --> 00:52:11.094
the poem,
and the ultimate goal of the

00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:12.380
journey.
 

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:15.217
That for Dante will be,
as we shall see maybe next

00:52:15.217 --> 00:52:17.710
week, the very vision of the
incarnation.

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:21.465
The two--the idea where these
two, this structure,

00:52:21.465 --> 00:52:25.835
the immutable structure of
history and the process of time

00:52:25.835 --> 00:52:27.599
will come together.
 

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:31.780
Let me stop here and see if
there are questions that I

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.963
would--about some of these
issues that I raised that I

00:52:35.963 --> 00:52:38.409
would welcome them,
please.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:18.351
The passage,
by the way, may be we should

00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:21.240
even--
the passage about where Dante

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:25.829
talks about his own horoscope
was given a little bit earlier,

00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:30.179
line 112 of Canto XXII,
where Dante says,

00:53:30.179 --> 00:53:33.358
"O glorious stars,
O light pregnant with mighty

00:53:33.358 --> 00:53:36.012
power,
from which I acknowledge all my

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:37.648
genius,
whatever it be,

00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:40.389
with you was born and with you
hidden,

00:53:40.389 --> 00:53:44.090
he that is the father of each
mortal life when I first tasted

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:46.717
the Tuscan air;
and after, when grace was

00:53:46.717 --> 00:53:50.503
granted me to enter into the
high wheel that bears you round,

00:53:50.503 --> 00:53:52.650
your region was assigned to me.
 

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:56.697
To you my soul now sighs
devoutly that it may gain

00:53:56.697 --> 00:54:01.570
strength for the hard task that
draws it to itself."

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:05.735
This is the--Dante abolishes
the differences between

00:54:05.735 --> 00:54:07.860
astronomy and astrology.
 

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.418
From this point of view he
belongs fully to his time where

00:54:11.418 --> 00:54:14.614
there is no intrinsic--
we think of them as

00:54:14.614 --> 00:54:17.369
astrologists,
of superstition,

00:54:17.369 --> 00:54:23.449
and astronomy is the science
that was not the case for Dante.

00:54:23.449 --> 00:54:33.967
Another little detail since I'm
introducing the question of

00:54:33.967 --> 00:54:43.760
visionariness now in
cantos--with the contemplation.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.798
Let me just mention this
initial image to give you an

00:54:48.798 --> 00:54:51.610
idea of how Dante proceeds.
 

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:56.768
The initial image at Canto XXI
of--the very beginning of Canto

00:54:56.768 --> 00:54:59.092
XXI,
Dante is in the sphere of

00:54:59.092 --> 00:55:03.320
Saturn where the contemplatives
are and he sees the ladder,

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:07.643
the ladder of ascent but before
we get there this is the

00:55:07.643 --> 00:55:10.315
passage,
"Already my eyes were

00:55:10.315 --> 00:55:13.565
fixed on the face of my Lady,
and within my mind,

00:55:13.565 --> 00:55:16.219
which was withdrawn from every
other thought;

00:55:16.219 --> 00:55:20.981
and she did not smile,
but 'Were I to smile' she began

00:55:20.981 --> 00:55:26.460
to me, 'thou wouldst become like
Semele when she was turned to

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.313
ashes;
for my beauty,

00:55:28.313 --> 00:55:32.268
which thou hast seen kindle
more the higher we climb by the

00:55:32.268 --> 00:55:36.842
stairs of the eternal palace,
is so shining that if it were

00:55:36.842 --> 00:55:41.327
not tempered thy mortal powers
in its blaze would be as a

00:55:41.327 --> 00:55:43.969
branch split by a thunderbolt.
 

00:55:43.969 --> 00:55:47.572
We have risen to the seventh
splendour, which beneath the

00:55:47.572 --> 00:55:51.820
breast of the burning Lion rays
down now mingled with its power.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.753
Set thy mind behind thine eyes
and make of them mirrors to the

00:55:55.753 --> 00:55:59.429
shape which in this mirror will
appear to thee.'"

00:55:59.429 --> 00:56:04.349
This is an extraordinary image,
the image of the myth of

00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:09.000
Semele, the young woman who fell
in love with God.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.878
That would seem to be,
of course, an extraordinary

00:56:13.878 --> 00:56:15.670
spiritual story.
 

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:18.590
Ovid tells it as a very carnal
story,

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:23.413
she wants to love Jupiter,
and Jupiter will agree to love

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:29.798
Semele back on one condition,
that she never ask the god to

00:56:29.798 --> 00:56:34.179
show himself forth for what he
is.

00:56:34.179 --> 00:56:38.000
She has to accept his--the
god's disguises.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.612
A variant, if you wish,
of what later will appear with

00:56:41.612 --> 00:56:44.994
Apuleius,
the idea of Eros and Psyche,

00:56:44.994 --> 00:56:49.360
you remember the love of--
the relationship with the mind

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:49.989
and love.
 

00:56:49.989 --> 00:56:54.862
Love does not want to be seen
for what it is,

00:56:54.862 --> 00:57:00.840
and always Simulacra and
deceptive figures to cover its

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.170
essence.
 

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.090
This is the same thing that
he's asking,

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:08.458
that Dante's recalling,
and of course what happens in

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:13.097
Ovid is that Semele,
in love, and because of love,

00:57:13.097 --> 00:57:17.682
love impels curiosity,
she wants Jupiter to show

00:57:17.682 --> 00:57:23.347
himself forth for what he is,
mindless of the danger that

00:57:23.347 --> 00:57:27.639
Jupiter had predicted this would
befall--

00:57:27.639 --> 00:57:31.018
and the danger of the death
that would befall her.

00:57:31.018 --> 00:57:34.614
In fact, he shows himself and
she cannot bear the

00:57:34.614 --> 00:57:39.106
extraordinary beauty of the god
and gets destroyed and turned

00:57:39.106 --> 00:57:40.230
into ashes.
 

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:43.349
That's the myth that Dante is
recalling,

00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:46.219
so that the inevitable question
for us is,

00:57:46.219 --> 00:57:50.884
why would Dante recall this
story here at the beginning of

00:57:50.884 --> 00:57:53.340
the cantos on contemplation.
 

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:58.211
The answer that I could give
you is that Dante does so

00:57:58.211 --> 00:58:03.360
because he's aware of the
dangers of visionary claims.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.929
This is--if you read the Bible,
for instance,

00:58:06.929 --> 00:58:10.407
you do know that there is a
tradition in the Bible among the

00:58:10.407 --> 00:58:13.262
Jews to turn their back,
for instance,

00:58:13.262 --> 00:58:17.929
to even the passing of what is
viewed as holy,

00:58:17.929 --> 00:58:21.469
to be the Holy Arc,
or they cover themselves in--

00:58:21.469 --> 00:58:28.010
because of the wisdom or the
tradition of not seeing,

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:32.789
or never trying to have mixed
the profane and the sacred,

00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:35.920
that of the sense of the danger
that would befall the--

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:41.449
those who are in the space
of--the profane space,

00:58:41.449 --> 00:58:43.510
they were outside of the
sanctuary.

00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:48.856
Dante is making this--or
Beatrice is telling him that he

00:58:48.856 --> 00:58:54.010
has to endure the limitations of
his human nature,

00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:58.342
and that his human nature,
the trait of his mortality

00:58:58.342 --> 00:59:03.340
which is that of seeing through
images and through ubiquitous

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.590
cannot yet be given up.
 

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:10.090
He does this as he enters the
heaven of the contemplatives,

00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:14.510
who they themselves were
longing and desiring to see God,

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:20.483
but accepted this longing as
the sign of God's presence and

00:59:20.483 --> 00:59:22.030
gift to them.
 

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:25.476
This is an extraordinary
passage in terms of what Dante

00:59:25.476 --> 00:59:29.117
thinks of contemplation and
clearly the danger of thinking

00:59:29.117 --> 00:59:32.501
of contemplation as the
condition that would allow and

00:59:32.501 --> 00:59:34.800
bring about the vision of God.
 

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.847
Such a vision,
Dante is saying,

00:59:36.847 --> 00:59:40.739
is not going to be possible
while we are here on Earth.

00:59:40.739 --> 00:59:46.838
This is the--a number of
ambiguities about this problem

00:59:46.838 --> 00:59:53.503
and then we could also mention
why Benedict--why is Benedict

00:59:53.503 --> 00:59:54.518
here?
 

00:59:54.518 --> 00:59:58.880
The figure that appears in
Canto XXII as the example of--

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.880
first of all he is the founder,
as I said,

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.788
of the life of contemplation,
but a life of contemplation

01:00:06.788 --> 01:00:10.820
that appears as the danger of
contemplation;

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:15.893
of course, Dante goes on
talking about the decadence of

01:00:15.893 --> 01:00:20.106
the contemplative order,
which is by the way,

01:00:20.106 --> 01:00:23.429
quite true and what--
that which occasions

01:00:23.429 --> 01:00:27.349
historically the foundation of
the mendicant orders.

01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:30.525
Those Franciscans and
Dominicans whom we already have

01:00:30.525 --> 01:00:34.313
encountered who want to be part
of the world and roam around in

01:00:34.313 --> 01:00:37.108
the world,
but the danger of the

01:00:37.108 --> 01:00:42.030
contemplation though is that
they can bypass and drive a

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:47.400
wedge between the contemplative
life and the active life.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:52.161
The ideal of Benedict has been
betrayed because what he wants

01:00:52.161 --> 01:00:55.099
is an action and a life of
action,

01:00:55.099 --> 01:00:59.045
the life of contemplative
prayer, so that's one of the

01:00:59.045 --> 01:01:02.469
causes of the degeneracy that
Dante pursues.

01:01:02.469 --> 01:01:06.889
With that we enter the world
of--now where Dante returns and

01:01:06.889 --> 01:01:11.460
this is what we are going to do
next time to what I call basic

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.210
words.
 

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:16.909
Somehow the whole compass of
knowledge,

01:01:16.909 --> 01:01:20.989
the whole idea of geography and
spiritual geography,

01:01:20.989 --> 01:01:25.000
the whole idea of how--of what
triggers the writing of a poem,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.751
that has been taken care of,
or at least Dante seems to have

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:32.630
been phasing and delivering to
us his particular understanding

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.030
of these problems.
 

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.130
Now the question is,
with all of this in mind,

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:41.690
what is the meaning of the
basic words we use,

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:44.617
and the basic words we use,
and that's what we are going to

01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:48.682
talk about next time,
are going to be love,

01:01:48.682 --> 01:01:52.976
hope, and faith,
what we call the three

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:54.739
theological virtues.
 

01:01:54.739 --> 01:01:58.409
They are basic words because
there is no such a thing as a

01:01:58.409 --> 01:02:01.630
life without trust,
or the difficulties of the life

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:02.789
without trust.
 

01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:06.369
There is no possibility of a
life without hope and certainly

01:02:06.369 --> 01:02:09.889
that which for Dante remains the
biggest mystery of all;

01:02:09.889 --> 01:02:12.550
there is never the possibility
of thinking about a life or

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:13.250
without love.
 

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.860
It becomes a mystery because he
can define the other two words;

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:21.059
he never-- he escapes the
responsibly of defining love.

01:02:21.059 --> 01:02:25.829
It is as if that were really
the biggest mystery throughout

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:29.860
the Divine Comedy and in
his experience.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:40.186
Let me see if there are some
questions now that I have thrown

01:02:40.186 --> 01:02:49.307
a lot--put a lot of chestnuts on
the fire as we say so

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:51.889
let's--yes.
 

01:02:51.889 --> 01:02:55.606
Student: In one of your
earlier lectures you were

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:59.663
talking about the whole comedy
that it was a physical journey

01:02:59.663 --> 01:03:02.300
and in hell we could see that
was--

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.931
he emphasized his weight and
the Earth and smells of things

01:03:06.931 --> 01:03:09.764
and so forth,
and now that we're in

01:03:09.764 --> 01:03:13.099
Paradise it's more vision
and light,

01:03:13.099 --> 01:03:17.485
and color, and is he trying to
characterize God or God's

01:03:17.485 --> 01:03:22.030
relation to Earth somehow by
contrasting them that way?

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:26.257
Prof: The question is
that in the previous lectures I

01:03:26.257 --> 01:03:31.244
discussed--
would talk of hell as the place

01:03:31.244 --> 01:03:36.396
where the smells,
the concrete particulars of the

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:41.130
Earth would be mentioned and it
would be part of Dante's

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:44.829
warehouse in the representation
of hell.

01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:46.746
Now that we are talking--we are
entering the world of

01:03:46.746 --> 01:03:48.184
Paradise,
we have been discussing

01:03:48.184 --> 01:03:51.889
Paradise,
Dante seems to separate himself

01:03:51.889 --> 01:03:57.271
from the aesthetics,
the sensual aspects of hell and

01:03:57.271 --> 01:04:00.318
talk more--
which is still sensual though,

01:04:00.318 --> 01:04:05.369
colors,
light, colors and visionariness.

01:04:05.369 --> 01:04:10.494
Then the question becomes does
this mean that Dante is clearly

01:04:10.494 --> 01:04:15.364
finding a distinction between
Earth and Heaven that this is

01:04:15.364 --> 01:04:19.480
really the--
am I rephrasing it accurately?

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.320
Student:  Yes.
 

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.786
Is he trying to--I mean,
because clearly it's not that

01:04:23.786 --> 01:04:27.971
he's trying to separate God from
physical reality because what we

01:04:27.971 --> 01:04:31.960
see and colors are still very
physical descriptions so what is

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.250
the distinction between them?
 

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:39.592
Prof: Yeah well I--
the answer would be this,

01:04:39.592 --> 01:04:45.043
that in Paradise you do
have a lot of what we call

01:04:45.043 --> 01:04:49.501
earthly experiences,
that's the only way he can

01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:53.579
really understand anything about
Paradise.

01:04:53.579 --> 01:04:56.474
There are dances,
there are songs,

01:04:56.474 --> 01:05:00.510
you do have--there are games
that they play.

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:05.505
You do have the language of
playfulness in the forms of

01:05:05.505 --> 01:05:06.800
simulations.
 

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.639
Simulation is very--it's a form
of game,

01:05:10.639 --> 01:05:15.050
it's a reduction of the world
to unseriousness,

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:19.108
the game, the play,
and in the form of the

01:05:19.108 --> 01:05:22.795
degradation of,
the noble idea of play because

01:05:22.795 --> 01:05:24.871
play is--
see these things are all very

01:05:24.871 --> 01:05:25.469
ambivalent.
 

01:05:25.469 --> 01:05:29.349
We are dealing with the same
reality only seen from different

01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:31.652
perspective,
and I mention play because

01:05:31.652 --> 01:05:33.500
Paradise is all about
play,

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:39.289
it's about playing,
about the dance of the stars,

01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:42.469
about the spectacle,
the theatre which he just--

01:05:42.469 --> 01:05:47.090
Dante has just seen a little
performance put out for him.

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:50.119
Can you imagine the dance of
the stars that go on?

01:05:50.119 --> 01:05:56.119
It's like seeing the spectacle
of the Olympics in China;

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:59.981
they go on with distribution of
shapes and forms,

01:05:59.981 --> 01:06:02.635
that is play,
it's aesthetics so I

01:06:02.635 --> 01:06:07.139
don't--there is no difference
there between the two.

01:06:07.139 --> 01:06:09.699
I don't see a difference there.
 

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.699
Of course that has nothing to
do, whatever he is seeing in

01:06:12.699 --> 01:06:15.068
Paradise,
has really nothing to do with

01:06:15.068 --> 01:06:17.070
the understanding of the
divinity.

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:18.969
I am not even--I haven't
decided yet,

01:06:18.969 --> 01:06:22.936
not for any reason but because
there may not really be time and

01:06:22.936 --> 01:06:26.181
I could--
I wouldn't be doing justice to

01:06:26.181 --> 01:06:28.809
the difficulty of the problem.
 

01:06:28.809 --> 01:06:32.300
I haven't decided whether to
discuss the whole--

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.630
the cosmology of
Paradise,

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:39.000
of the universe that appears in
Canto XXIX of Paradise

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.860
where Dante goes on talking
about two universes,

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:45.461
for instance,
so there is the physical

01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:49.400
universe that somehow he has
traversed only to understand

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.851
that when he goes there,
there is another universe which

01:06:52.851 --> 01:06:55.538
is completely spiritual and it's
not the platonic idea of an

01:06:55.538 --> 01:06:58.155
inverted--
you know Plato has this idea of

01:06:58.155 --> 01:07:01.103
an inverted cosmos,
but we are in the world which

01:07:01.103 --> 01:07:03.454
is really the projection,
a projection,

01:07:03.454 --> 01:07:08.197
an unreal projection,
projection meaning a shadow of

01:07:08.197 --> 01:07:10.000
the real cosmos.
 

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.128
It's not really that there are
two adjacent cosmos,

01:07:13.128 --> 01:07:16.630
both very real and that's
the--where we live and where we

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:20.690
don't live;
beyond that as really a speck

01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:22.518
of sand he says.
 

01:07:22.518 --> 01:07:29.041
There is a light that clearly
is the light from which whole or

01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:33.532
creation emanates,
so God remains forever a

01:07:33.532 --> 01:07:35.349
transcendent.
 

01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:39.989
What Dante does see at the end
is he sees this image in--

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:43.018
his own image in the plural,
our image,

01:07:43.018 --> 01:07:48.123
which to me implies the idea
that as Christians read the

01:07:48.123 --> 01:07:51.650
whole notion of Genesis is that
in--

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:56.719
since we are shaped in God's
image there is our image in God.

01:07:56.719 --> 01:08:00.650
There is a human component in
God, so that's all he sees;

01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:05.862
he sees maybe the incarnation
but it's--all of that is all

01:08:05.862 --> 01:08:10.253
wrapped in a kind of
extraordinary and deliberate

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.179
fogginess of representation.
 

01:08:13.179 --> 01:08:18.479
The paradise that he describes
is not the paradise of sensual

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:21.779
delights,
of the Qu'ran for instance,

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:25.180
but there's a lot of game and
play and--

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:30.543
the stars, the amorous
discourse of paradise engages

01:08:30.543 --> 01:08:33.698
and involves even the stars.
 

01:08:33.698 --> 01:08:37.904
They go on wooing each other,
it's as if literally the whole

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:42.039
cosmos is involved in this
extraordinary dance of love that

01:08:42.039 --> 01:08:46.502
keeps it together,
makes it cohere as opposed to

01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:52.048
say Lucretius' idea of an
anarchic universe forever on the

01:08:52.048 --> 01:08:54.578
verge of falling apart.
 

01:08:54.578 --> 01:08:58.750
These are the real models of
the cosmos.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.229
Let's call it Lucretius and
Virgil,

01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:08.520
Epicurus and Plato,
this is Dante and heavy,

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.569
the heavy traditionalist,
it's very heavy the tradition

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:12.529
of materialism.
 

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:18.235
The spiritual tradition is very
small in comparison to the

01:09:18.235 --> 01:09:23.769
heaviness of the physical,
of the scholars of physics who

01:09:23.769 --> 01:09:27.448
want to see the cosmos in
physical terms.

01:09:27.448 --> 01:09:31.960
But Dante opposes it and
somehow he finds a kind of--

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.586
that's what the
universe--that's what keeps the

01:09:34.586 --> 01:09:38.127
universe together is really love
and that's what we're going to

01:09:38.127 --> 01:09:38.868
find out.
 

01:09:38.868 --> 01:09:40.880
That I will read,
the rest I don't know.

01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:45.979
Other questions?
 

01:09:45.979 --> 01:09:47.140
Please.
 

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.648
Student:  When Beatrice
is wanting Dante not to look

01:09:50.648 --> 01:09:54.217
directly at her face because he
might become like Semele and

01:09:54.217 --> 01:09:58.051
just turn to ashes,
do you think Dante is trying to

01:09:58.051 --> 01:10:02.585
elude back to Medusa and the
danger of just looking directly

01:10:02.585 --> 01:10:07.041
into the face of something so
powerful and being reduced to

01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:09.500
something that isn't human?
 

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.622
I was reading that and she
said, "Set thy mind behind

01:10:12.622 --> 01:10:15.692
thine eyes and make of them
mirrors to the shape which in

01:10:15.692 --> 01:10:18.542
this mirror will appear to
thee," as if like the

01:10:18.542 --> 01:10:20.603
mirror,
so the mirror is like the eyes

01:10:20.603 --> 01:10:22.886
like the intermediary just like
the shield that is the

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.310
intermediary for maybe Medusa.
 

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:25.640
Prof: Very good.
 

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.890
The question--let me just
recall the question.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:33.641
The image of Beatrice as
Semele, whose smile could

01:10:33.641 --> 01:10:40.802
potentially destroy the lover,
the pilgrim who were to look at

01:10:40.802 --> 01:10:43.500
her face;
the question is,

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.060
is that supposed to be a sort
of,

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:51.391
let's call it palinodic
variant, a version of the scene

01:10:51.391 --> 01:10:56.447
of Medusa in Inferno IX,
who threatened also,

01:10:56.447 --> 01:11:00.610
in that case the pilgrim,
with petrification,

01:11:00.610 --> 01:11:05.740
with a turning into stone,
the intellect would petrify,

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:10.907
that's really the allegory and
there of course in the canto of

01:11:10.907 --> 01:11:14.210
Medusa there was always the
shield,

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:17.500
the shield of poetry,
the shield of Perseus,

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:21.863
and the answer is yes
absolutely, this is exactly what

01:11:21.863 --> 01:11:23.100
is happening.
 

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.612
I think that this is--if you
are thinking as I think you are

01:11:27.612 --> 01:11:31.590
of writing about--are you
thinking of writing--no.

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:34.380
About Medusa? No.
 

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.300
Student:  I was just
&gt;.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.608
Prof: Okay,
well if you're thinking about

01:11:37.608 --> 01:11:40.359
writing about Medusa I think
that you are absolutely--

01:11:40.359 --> 01:11:43.198
you would--the two scenes you
would be absolutely correct.

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:47.578
The story of Medusa is--what is
interesting--

01:11:47.578 --> 01:11:49.630
the story of Medusa is the
story of--

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:52.510
we could view it--we viewed it,
as you remember,

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:55.130
the temptation of looking at
the past,

01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:58.113
a way of Orpheus,
a turning--Dante who casts

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:00.920
himself as Orpheus,
Orpheus, you know,

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.903
who is told not to look back
and yet Orpheus stands for a

01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:08.722
sort of impatience,
a kind of skepticism about the

01:12:08.722 --> 01:12:11.078
injunction,
the fear that Eurydice may not

01:12:11.078 --> 01:12:13.722
really be following him,
he turns and loses her,

01:12:13.722 --> 01:12:16.569
some modern mythographers even
see that look.

01:12:16.569 --> 01:12:19.220
I'm thinking about a man by the
name of Blanchaux,

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:22.810
he really wanted to lose
Eurydice because he saw--

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:23.890
because this way he could write
poetry,

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:27.698
so that poetry can become the
perpetual voice of absence.

01:12:27.698 --> 01:12:32.042
Dante does not go that far but
it's clear that it's time to--a

01:12:32.042 --> 01:12:34.250
poetic experience of his own.
 

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:39.078
The interesting thing about
what you are saying and we could

01:12:39.078 --> 01:12:43.091
go into that maybe in a
conversation later because

01:12:43.091 --> 01:12:45.585
it's--
it would take me too far,

01:12:45.585 --> 01:12:49.947
is that this enigmatic--
the double face of Beatrice

01:12:49.947 --> 01:12:53.729
comes to the fore here that she
has--

01:12:53.729 --> 01:13:00.256
she was confronting the siren
and threatens against the siren

01:13:00.256 --> 01:13:07.109
and now she also appears as the
sorcery and danger of beauty.

01:13:07.109 --> 01:13:10.060
Beauty that is that which
was--the language here is

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:12.997
beauty,
beauty which can--which we

01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:18.323
hunger after and yet it's that
which can destroy us and this

01:13:18.323 --> 01:13:24.332
seems to me to be--
I put that in the consciousness

01:13:24.332 --> 01:13:27.759
of Dante's--
of the contemplatives that

01:13:27.759 --> 01:13:30.908
Dante represents,
this doubleness that you're

01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:33.899
wrong to see and yet you may not
have to--

01:13:33.899 --> 01:13:37.545
you are better off in not
seeing, but it's true that it

01:13:37.545 --> 01:13:41.460
appears also with the ambiguity
of beauty and the beauty of

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.551
Beatrice that it would be true.
 

01:13:43.551 --> 01:13:44.158
Yes.
 

01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:47.104
Student:  So if the
mirror is sort of like the

01:13:47.104 --> 01:13:49.198
intermediary just like the
shield,

01:13:49.198 --> 01:13:53.456
what role does vision and the
eyes play in mediating between

01:13:53.456 --> 01:13:57.640
what you see in the world and
the mind that it protects?

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.716
Prof: Well Dante
will--is now slowly preparing

01:14:01.716 --> 01:14:06.106
for this final vision and it's
going to have intermediate

01:14:06.106 --> 01:14:06.970
stages.
 

01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:12.069
When he will see,
at the end he will see not God;

01:14:12.069 --> 01:14:18.140
he will see his own image
within the beatific vision.

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.618
This is how far he will go,
not only that,

01:14:21.618 --> 01:14:26.286
he will go also--there is an
eclipse of the inner eye of

01:14:26.286 --> 01:14:27.220
memory.
 

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:31.564
Memory is thought of as being
the inner eye of the

01:14:31.564 --> 01:14:36.618
imagination, that's the
classical definition of memory.

01:14:36.618 --> 01:14:38.689
That too will be completely
eclipsed,

01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:42.009
he will forget,
so that at the end of all of

01:14:42.009 --> 01:14:46.563
these experiences we are ending
up with forgetfulness with a

01:14:46.563 --> 01:14:48.569
fall from that vision.
 

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:51.381
I don't know that I'm answering
exactly your question but I

01:14:51.381 --> 01:14:53.570
don't know that I--
I haven't understood what you

01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:58.170
really want to know,
what you're really asking so--

01:14:58.170 --> 01:14:59.668
Student:  I guess I'm
just asking more about the role

01:14:59.668 --> 01:15:00.659
of vision like it makes more
sense--

01:15:00.659 --> 01:15:02.920
Prof: Vision-- okay.
 

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.282
Student:  Yeah,
just like I'm--is the eye

01:15:06.282 --> 01:15:10.573
supposed to be an intermediary
or a protection of the mind to

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:14.746
let you think or--
Prof: The eye--what is

01:15:14.746 --> 01:15:20.060
the eye, is it the intermediary
or an extension of the mind?

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.068
That's really what the eye is,
but the vision that he will

01:15:23.068 --> 01:15:25.390
have is not going to be a
physical vision.

01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:29.600
It cannot be a physical vision;
it has to be a spiritual vision

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.750
and so there are the limitations
of the eye.

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:36.368
Let me leave it at that.
 

01:15:36.368 --> 01:15:38.590
Okay, thank you,
see you next time.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.217
Prof: We're going to
look at XXVII,

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:07.080
XXVIII and XXIX today of
Paradise,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.590
three cantos that,
really, I think,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.696
Dante constructs together and
where Dante puts forth this

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:25.239
theory of creation and cosmology
which are not quite the same

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.330
thing.
 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.456
A theory of Beatrice that's
explaining the shape of the

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:34.430
cosmos, it's very difficult in
these three cantos.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.000
It's done in such a way that
they are two different things,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.458
it would seem,
creation and a physical

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:47.512
description of the cosmos which
we call cosmology and they are

00:00:47.512 --> 00:00:51.500
because Dante's dealing with two
forms of the universe,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.180
a spiritual one and a physical
one.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.603
Now we're going to show all of
this as we go over the three

00:00:58.603 --> 00:00:59.290
cantos.
 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.626
I would like to argue that in
effect they are not quite the

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:08.860
same thing but not really all
that distinct.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.349
There is a very tedious line
separating the two of them.

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:17.640
Where are we first of all in
space?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.840
We are somewhere in space,
Dante has gone past now,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.170
the heaven of the fixed stars,
with the examination of the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.519
three words,
the three terms,

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:36.489
the foundations of things that
we experience as trust,

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:39.540
or we experience as existential
hope,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.550
or a love that if you combine
it is always--

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.617
implies always--not in Canto
XXVI but in possibilities of

00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:51.056
betrayal,
uncertainty,

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:58.495
so it combines both faith and
hope in a very problematical

00:01:58.495 --> 00:01:59.410
way.
 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:07.620
Canto XXVII Dante continues
with--in the afterglow of the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.008
fixed stars,
and the canto just to give you

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.508
an idea about what formally is
happening here,

00:02:15.508 --> 00:02:20.982
the first part of the canto
really looks back formerly at

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:24.110
Canto XXVII of Inferno.
 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.750
There is clearly a parallel
between the two cantos.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.876
Here Dante--you remember what
he does, he meets St.

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:36.663
Peter actually who has been
examining him but now after the

00:02:36.663 --> 00:02:41.121
examination of the three
theological virtues he goes on

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:46.789
in a prophetic denunciation,
he denounces the collusion

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:51.045
between his place,
he says "my place,"

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.830
it's the papacy,
the place instituted

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.479
by--because of him he's the
Peter,

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.220
he's the stone,
and his successors.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.020
That's the way it says,
so the canto literally looks

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.026
backwards and a parallel with--
you may have a number of

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:10.508
parallels with Inferno
XIX where Dante meets,

00:03:10.508 --> 00:03:15.008
you remember,
the popes who are turned upside

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:19.671
down and the flames--
the kind of--the parody of the

00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:23.680
Pentecostal fires out on the
plants of their feet,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.703
but this is more clearly a
reference to Canto XXVII of

00:03:26.703 --> 00:03:30.298
Inferno,
where this is the very

00:03:30.298 --> 00:03:34.557
beginning, this is--
there is a hymn Canto XXVII,

00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:39.514
"Glory be to the Father,
the Son, etc.,"

00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:48.378
and then lines 40 and following
we have this great attack,

00:03:48.378 --> 00:03:50.169
"It was not our
meaning,"

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.327
line 45,
"that on the right hand of

00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:55.381
our successors should sit one
part of Christ's people and the

00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:58.285
other on the left;
nor that the keys which were

00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:02.020
committed to me should become
the device on a standard for

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.167
warfare on the baptized;
nor that I should be the figure

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:10.308
on a seal for sold and lying
favours, for which I often

00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:13.068
redden and flash with
fire."

00:04:13.068 --> 00:04:15.568
This is the fire of prophecy
without a doubt,

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:19.023
but it's also,
retrospectively,

00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:24.319
a reference to the attack
against Boniface,

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.410
who in Canto XXVII of
Inferno,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.569
is shown as he is in colluding
with the Guido da Montefeltro.

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.254
You remember,
so there is a clear--it's a

00:04:36.254 --> 00:04:38.940
clear symmetry between the two
cantos.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.639
I will hasten to add that Canto
XXVII is also--

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.639
has a kind of chiastic
structure because at one point,

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.519
just to give you this is a
formal description of what's

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:55.757
happening here,
a little later after this

00:04:55.757 --> 00:04:57.579
outburst by Peter,
 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.800
Beatrice and the pilgrim move
onto the next heaven,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.250
which is around line 75 and
following.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.913
The next heaven is the
so-called crystalline heaven

00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:16.819
which is still material.
 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.509
He's at the boundary of the
material universe.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.660
It's still material but it's
very, exactly crystal-like;

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.639
it's a very thin materiality,
almost but not quite spiritual.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.060
It's also called the primum
mobile because it's here;

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.949
this is the technical term that
they give.

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.627
It's here, in this heaven,
that we have problems of

00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:45.399
origins, the origin of time,
the origin of space.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:49.115
Dante goes on giving
this--Beatrice goes on giving

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:54.120
this cosmological description of
the universe in material terms.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.470
Here, to continue with the
formal,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.110
the issue of form now,
at one point Beatrice says,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.220
"wait look behind you so
that you can have an idea,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.449
you can measure the enormous
distance you have traveled from

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:12.740
the Earth."
 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.829
He's at the boundary of the
material cosmos.

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:17.839
You might say,
well he's at the edge of the

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.420
cosmos; he's going to fall off.
 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.872
That was always one of the
objections about the idea of the

00:06:22.872 --> 00:06:24.480
finiteness of the cosmos.
 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.963
Believe it or not in the
seventeenth century they would

00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:29.629
never really fall off because
the universe is a sphere,

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.410
so the only place he has to go
to is back,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.192
there's no literally edge,
every point is the edge and

00:06:37.192 --> 00:06:40.690
every point is in a continuous
spherical curve.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.180
Anyway, from the point of view,
he's arriving there so she

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.793
says,
look back and what does he see,

00:06:46.793 --> 00:06:49.752
and this is the line,
"From the time when I

00:06:49.752 --> 00:06:52.952
had," this is XXVII,
line 75, "From the time

00:06:52.952 --> 00:06:56.603
when I had looked before I saw
that I had moved through the

00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:59.310
whole arc,"
that's the language of this

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.279
sphere,
an arc, circle,

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.810
an arc just gives you an idea
of sphericity,

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.870
"from the middle to the
end of the first clime,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.639
so that I saw on the one hand,
beyond Cadiz,

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.370
the mad track of Ulysses."
 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.019
He pinpoints that little place
where Ulysses trespassed the

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:25.007
boundaries of the world--
of the Euclidian space he

00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:29.630
had--for which he has been
damned in Canto XXVI of

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.329
Inferno.
 

00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:35.524
This is what we call a
chiasmus, in other words XXVI

00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:40.540
and XXVII--we do see that XXVI
that are an allusion to Ulysses

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.610
and Adam.
 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:47.274
We talked about these figures
and here in XXVII of

00:07:47.274 --> 00:07:51.865
Hell,
there is Boniface and then in

00:07:51.865 --> 00:07:55.610
Paradise XXVII there is
this,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:01.348
and there is also a kind
of--this is Ulysses so there's a

00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:06.711
sort of chiastic structure;
XXVII of Paradise refers

00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:11.187
to really VI of Paradise
and refers also to XXVII of

00:08:11.187 --> 00:08:14.660
Inferno and XXVI of
Inferno.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.560
The question is,
why does Dante pinpoint once

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.980
again Ulysses?
 

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.055
He sees at the west the point
which Ulysses had trespassed and

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:29.050
he calls it the mad track,
"the mad track of

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.550
Ulysses."
 

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.097
Clearly, Ulysses is still part
of this fascination that--it

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:39.961
exerts an incredible fascination
on the imagination of the poet

00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:41.529
and the pilgrim.
 

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:46.860
Am I like Ulysses or am I going
to be lost now like Ulysses,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.200
but at the same time,
it's a way of hinting at how

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.918
much he has exceeded Ulysses'
adventure.

00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:58.570
Ulysses only went past the
Pillars of Hercules;

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.649
he, Dante, is now at the outer
most boundary of the visible

00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:07.460
physical universe,
so there's a way in which there

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.399
is a little bit of detachment
and yet a constant fascination.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:14.850
We tried to explain why he is
so fascinated with Ulysses.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.013
At the other end he also sees,
"and on the other nearly

00:09:19.013 --> 00:09:23.177
to the shore where Europa made
herself a sweet burden,"

00:09:23.177 --> 00:09:27.129
this is really the eastern part
of the known world,

00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:32.690
Europe, the rape of Europe by
Jupiter so that we really have

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:38.440
an erotic transgression and an
intellectual transgression,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.538
as if the two are now once
again are involved in this--

00:09:42.538 --> 00:09:46.567
in Dante's vision as if he's
now coming to the point where

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:49.889
knowledge and desire really have
to coincide.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:54.546
He's coming to the point where
the beautiful and the good are

00:09:54.546 --> 00:09:57.743
one,
at the point where all of the

00:09:57.743 --> 00:10:03.417
great countries and distinctions
that we have been pursuing all

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:07.169
along nearly have to go on
converging.

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.700
Let me continue with this idea.
 

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.028
This is--before I go on with
what happens in the canto.

00:10:15.028 --> 00:10:19.687
Dante then moves into the
primum mobile,

00:10:19.687 --> 00:10:24.548
which is the place where I
continue with this.

00:10:24.548 --> 00:10:30.173
He goes on line 100,
they go into "the swiftest

00:10:30.173 --> 00:10:34.695
part of heaven,"
that's the primum

00:10:34.695 --> 00:10:36.350
mobile.
 

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.860
All motion begins from here.
 

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.388
Dante is moving from what would
seem to be an ethical--the

00:10:42.388 --> 00:10:44.851
ethical scene,
the denunciation,

00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:49.379
Peter's denunciation of the
abuses within the Church.

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:53.921
That's done in a prophetic tone
but also from a tone of ethical,

00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:55.580
the ethical language.
 

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.706
He goes into the so-called
primum mobile which

00:11:00.706 --> 00:11:04.649
actually is the heaven of
metaphysics.

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:06.379
I have been telling you about
the grammar,

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:09.965
rhetoric, music,
geometry, this is what we call

00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:13.940
the heaven of metaphysics and
you know what that is,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.720
right?
 

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.330
You understand what metaphysics
means?

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.014
Dante refers to it as they did
refer to it, Aristotle refers to

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:23.558
as the first philosophy.
 

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:29.062
They called it first because it
reigns--it rules supreme among

00:11:29.062 --> 00:11:32.308
all the arts and all the
sciences.

00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:34.110
It's the most important of the
sciences.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.870
It's the point of arrival of
all the sciences and it's called

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.961
first philosophy because it
explains also questions of

00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:47.674
origins,
and you see the language of

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.313
origins here,
the origin of time,

00:11:49.313 --> 00:11:51.091
the origin of space,
creation itself,

00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:54.091
the beginning of the world,
causes, foundations,

00:11:54.091 --> 00:11:57.097
these are the--
this is the great Rome that

00:11:57.097 --> 00:11:58.629
metaphysics discusses.
 

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:01.402
Dante, the interesting thing is
that in the Middle Ages,

00:12:01.402 --> 00:12:03.570
and Dante has to connect it
with physics.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.678
Physics is as--metaphysics
really go hand in hand,

00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:08.557
one tries to give the
explanation of the physical

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:10.659
world,
and metaphysics the

00:12:10.659 --> 00:12:13.240
theoretical, general rules.
 

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.278
In fact, and this you
probably--I should mention this.

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:22.686
There are people who believe
that metaphysics was not a term

00:12:22.686 --> 00:12:27.360
that really indicated anything
really different,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.658
completely different from the
knowledge that physics provides.

00:12:31.658 --> 00:12:34.522
They would say that
was--metaphysics was called

00:12:34.522 --> 00:12:38.504
metaphysics because it--the book
was placed on the shelf a little

00:12:38.504 --> 00:12:40.620
bit after the book on physics.
 

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.418
You see what I mean?
 

00:12:41.418 --> 00:12:45.947
It was really more a way of
defining the place of the book

00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:51.278
on the library so to speak,
probably, but it was known as

00:12:51.278 --> 00:12:53.673
that,
but it's probably more of a

00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:55.418
fiction than anything else.
 

00:12:55.418 --> 00:12:59.931
The fact is that there is such
a science for Dante that deals

00:12:59.931 --> 00:13:02.788
with causes, origins,
beginnings, time,

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:03.389
etc.
 

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:07.519
One of the things that here we
have it's that Dante--

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:10.600
that Beatrice starts describing
line 100,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.227
"'The nature of the
universe,"

00:13:12.227 --> 00:13:13.690
here she placed the
cosmologies,

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.717
"which holds the center
still and moves all else around

00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:20.524
it,
begins here,'"

00:13:20.524 --> 00:13:22.908
so this is already the
beginning,

00:13:22.908 --> 00:13:24.700
literally the language of
beginnings.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.759
Here begins motion.
 

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:32.702
Dante stands at the boundary of
the physical universe and now

00:13:32.702 --> 00:13:35.668
she gives and explanation of
this.

00:13:35.668 --> 00:13:37.330
She just said he's at the
boundary,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.980
"And this heaven has no
other where,"

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.250
place,
"but the Divine Mind."

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:50.687
The real beginning,
the real universe is in God's

00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:53.962
mind,
so he distinguishes two worlds,

00:13:53.962 --> 00:13:57.659
the physical world we see and
the spiritual world,

00:13:57.659 --> 00:13:58.860
which is in God's mind.
 

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:04.647
In a way, and just to make it
very simple, Dante is journeying

00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:06.830
into the mind of God.
 

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.120
There is one man who had
written a text,

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.581
Bonaventure,
whom you have seen--whom you

00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:16.995
have met before and he wrote
this book called The

00:14:16.995 --> 00:14:20.370
Itinerary of The Mind into
God.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.225
This is a way of trying to
explore, to enter,

00:14:24.225 --> 00:14:27.379
mystically enter,
the mind of God.

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:29.620
Dante doesn't do it in a
mystical way.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.158
He tries to understand what's
beyond the physical world.

00:14:34.158 --> 00:14:37.734
To give a description of this
universe this is the term that

00:14:37.734 --> 00:14:40.460
keeps reappearing in the next
three cantos.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.379
"Light and love enclose it
in a circle,

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:47.398
as it does the others,
and of the girding He that

00:14:47.398 --> 00:14:50.038
girds it is the soul
Intelligence."

00:14:50.038 --> 00:14:55.409
This primum mobile,
it really is a kind of curve

00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:59.190
that wraps up all the other
heavens.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.167
We have seen--this is the ninth
heaven, all the other heavens

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:06.748
have been--are enwrapped within
it, but it's not only a

00:15:06.748 --> 00:15:09.426
boundary;
Dante views it as also the

00:15:09.426 --> 00:15:13.129
beginning, the threshold for the
spiritual universe.

00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:17.558
It's both the boundary of the
physical world and it's always

00:15:17.558 --> 00:15:22.460
also the--
so it goes like this,

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.815
this is the Earth,
and growing,

00:15:27.815 --> 00:15:35.541
and then we come to the ninth
this becomes at the same time a

00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:40.950
kind of convex and concave semi
circle.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.861
I have, believe it or not,
a shape of what I think is

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.269
Dante's cosmos and here it is.
 

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:49.700
This is--I'm going to pass it
around.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.519
This is a shell but it's
actually really made and found.

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:58.549
This would be the--pass it
around here and then I'll

00:15:58.549 --> 00:16:03.951
explain--
they're all spirals really like

00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:06.841
the--
since Dante thinks of the

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:11.028
cosmos as a book and we would
call it a cosmobook,

00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:17.230
that's a neology that I coin
here, a kind of cosmobook.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.528
The book in the shape of a
cosmos, it's really a parchment

00:16:21.528 --> 00:16:23.490
rolled up within itself.
 

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:29.075
You know what parchments are in
medieval and classical ideas of

00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:32.769
the production,
the material production of

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:33.668
books?
 

00:16:33.668 --> 00:16:38.331
We have the ancient parchments
which are all rolled up

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:43.519
like--the term is around a stick
and then held together by a

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:46.509
ring, that's really the shape.
 

00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:50.341
It's a sort of a production of
books that in the history of the

00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:53.740
book is later replaced around
the fourth century A.D.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.272
by the so called codex which we
have for instance even in the

00:16:57.272 --> 00:16:57.918
Beinecke.
 

00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:04.076
A codex has--it's made of
quartos, it's made of folios and

00:17:04.076 --> 00:17:10.340
divided like a book today made
of--it would have quartos or

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.528
folios.
 

00:17:11.528 --> 00:17:13.538
If you go and see the
Shakespeare's--

00:17:13.538 --> 00:17:18.880
the folios of Shakespeare in
the Elizabethan Club,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.964
for instance,
if they let you go in or you

00:17:20.964 --> 00:17:24.766
belong there,
take a look and see what the

00:17:24.766 --> 00:17:26.578
codex really is.
 

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:29.190
Dante seems to be combining the
two forms.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:33.186
Anyway, you have an idea here
of what the shape that I'm

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:35.440
trying to describe to you is.
 

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.892
They are a kind of,
if you wish,

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:43.476
they are spirals,
one following the other,

00:17:43.476 --> 00:17:49.269
and next to it there is going
to be a spiritual universe,

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:51.710
another universe which we'll
come to in a moment.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.670
This is the first description
that she's giving.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.250
The idea of the sphericity of
space,

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.284
that's one thing,
the space is spherical and has

00:18:01.284 --> 00:18:06.519
as the primum mobile as a
boundary and now we have--

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:10.130
Beatrice goes on explaining,
"Its motion is not

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.740
determined by another's,"
this is line 112,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.160
"but from it the rest have
their measures."

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.548
Everything begins here.
 

00:18:18.548 --> 00:18:21.830
This is the physical beginning
of the universe which we

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.660
inhabit, "even as ten from
the half and the fifth."

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.791
In other words,
it's as sure as it is that two

00:18:28.791 --> 00:18:33.038
plus five make ten and "how
time should have its roots in

00:18:33.038 --> 00:18:36.240
that vessel and in the others
its leaves,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.470
may not be plain to thee."
 

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:43.451
Even time begins here;
time is understood then by

00:18:43.451 --> 00:18:44.088
Dante.
 

00:18:44.088 --> 00:18:50.555
Do you see what the--there is a
kind of a tree growing from a

00:18:50.555 --> 00:18:53.680
part, the part of eternity.
 

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.934
He does not understand time in
a linear way,

00:18:57.934 --> 00:19:03.674
there was a beginning and an
end, and it's not the wheel of

00:19:03.674 --> 00:19:07.038
time or the wheel of becoming.
 

00:19:07.038 --> 00:19:09.621
You may have heard this,
have you heard this description

00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:12.529
about the wheel of becoming in
which this is a platonic idea of

00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:15.058
time,
where all things are contained?

00:19:15.058 --> 00:19:19.170
Dante thinks of the tree,
of time as a tree,

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:24.186
the roots of which are in the
pot of eternity and the foliages

00:19:24.186 --> 00:19:27.018
are in--
reach us--reach into our own

00:19:27.018 --> 00:19:27.519
world.
 

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:31.338
We are in the shadow of the
tree of time.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:36.410
We only see leaves that will
fall because this idea of the

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.788
dispersion and the falling of
time,

00:19:39.788 --> 00:19:44.556
the passing of time,
so this is the definition of

00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:46.940
what happens in XXVII.
 

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.058
She continues after a while
with this--

00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:56.307
about once again the language
of covetousness and moral

00:19:56.307 --> 00:20:02.903
language about what happens in
the world and we move on to

00:20:02.903 --> 00:20:04.868
Canto XXVIII.
 

00:20:04.868 --> 00:20:08.520
Let me tell you I have not
forgotten that we ought to talk

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.700
about Ulysses in a little while.
 

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:18.146
Now it continues with,
XXVIII deals with the angelic

00:20:18.146 --> 00:20:19.900
hierarchy.
 

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.371
We are now still in the
primum mobile but Dante

00:20:24.371 --> 00:20:28.673
starts seeing into the other
universe, the spiritual

00:20:28.673 --> 00:20:29.769
universe.
 

00:20:29.769 --> 00:20:34.730
He sees a universe which is
adjacent to the physical

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.328
universe with--inhabited by
angels.

00:20:38.328 --> 00:20:43.150
The corresponding part that you
have the nine planets,

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.297
the seven planets plus the
fixed stars and the crystalline

00:20:46.297 --> 00:20:48.502
heaven,
and now you have the nine

00:20:48.502 --> 00:20:51.611
orders of angels,
and Beatrice will go on

00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:54.750
describing the three triads of
angels;

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:58.395
angels, archangels,
thrones, this is the language

00:20:58.395 --> 00:21:02.060
that comes from the Bible,
the Old Testament comes from

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.443
Babylonian,
apparently in Persian sources,

00:21:05.443 --> 00:21:10.763
apocalyptic sources and would
not seem to be really terribly

00:21:10.763 --> 00:21:13.740
different from that tradition.
 

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.954
Here, we have also another;
this whole description of the

00:21:18.954 --> 00:21:23.773
angelic order continues,
line 12 let me just focus on

00:21:23.773 --> 00:21:26.626
this a bit,
"And when I turned again

00:21:26.626 --> 00:21:29.747
and mine were met by what
appears in that revolving sphere

00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:32.319
to one that looks intently on
its circling,

00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:37.568
I saw a point," distance,
so we are at the boundary of

00:21:37.568 --> 00:21:40.852
the universe;
another universe emerges into

00:21:40.852 --> 00:21:46.246
view and Dante only sees "a
point which radiated a light so

00:21:46.246 --> 00:21:50.784
keen that the eye in which it
burns must close for its

00:21:50.784 --> 00:21:53.009
piercing power."
 

00:21:53.009 --> 00:21:56.394
Once again, a series of
revolving spheres,

00:21:56.394 --> 00:22:00.276
this universe is not the
projection of the other

00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:04.798
universe;
they are separate and adjacent.

00:22:04.798 --> 00:22:10.243
They are two hemispheres and
this is what happens in Canto

00:22:10.243 --> 00:22:15.880
XXVIII and we go to Canto XXIX,
and I ask you to see how the

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.650
whole argument continues.
 

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:24.180
Beatrice has been explaining
breathlessly the whole question

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.632
of angelic hierarchy,
and by the end of Canto XXVIII

00:22:29.632 --> 00:22:32.397
he sees--
she even mentions that the

00:22:32.397 --> 00:22:36.450
order--actually it's Dante here
who mentions that the order--

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.690
his ordering of angels,
the hierarchy,

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.750
is very different from the one
of the pseudo Dionysius,

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.788
line 130 where he says,
"These orders all gaze

00:22:45.788 --> 00:22:49.432
above and so prevail below that
all are drawn and all draw to

00:22:49.432 --> 00:22:49.920
God.
 

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.468
And Dionysius set himself with
such zeal to contemplate,"

00:22:53.468 --> 00:22:56.550
this is the pseudo Dionysius
who had written about the

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.698
angelic hierarchy,
and Dante goes on to say that

00:22:59.698 --> 00:23:02.988
he differs from him,
that he just--his idea of

00:23:02.988 --> 00:23:07.440
angels is a little different
from his and Pope Gregory's.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.309
A statement of his own
intellectual independence,

00:23:11.309 --> 00:23:15.260
both in terms of the theologian
and in terms of an

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.598
ecclesiastical authority.
 

00:23:17.598 --> 00:23:23.680
And then Beatrice finishes the
description of this hierarchy,

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.250
meaning the sacred order,
that's what the Greek word

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.865
means,
the sacred order of angelic

00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:34.078
intelligences.
 

00:23:34.078 --> 00:23:38.650
Their function is to impart
motion to the spheres;

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:43.548
their function is to move
between the divinity and human

00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:46.326
beings,
they are the messengers,

00:23:46.326 --> 00:23:50.414
they keep the spiritual
entities and they keep moving

00:23:50.414 --> 00:23:55.288
between God and human beings and
then we go to Canto XXIX where

00:23:55.288 --> 00:24:00.403
now the language of cosmology,
about the order of the cosmos

00:24:00.403 --> 00:24:04.788
becomes creation,
and I want to show this to you.

00:24:04.788 --> 00:24:08.377
However, this shift to the
language of creation is

00:24:08.377 --> 00:24:12.038
conducted in an extraordinarily
interesting way.

00:24:12.038 --> 00:24:15.968
Dante wants to say that
Beatrice has been talking

00:24:15.968 --> 00:24:19.317
nonstop about--
with probably a touch of

00:24:19.317 --> 00:24:22.500
playfulness about the angelic
orders,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.230
and then she moves almost like,
without catching her breath,

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:30.519
talking about creation,
Canto XXIX.

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:36.118
But look how this shift from
the order of angels to the order

00:24:36.118 --> 00:24:38.640
of creation is described.
 

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.598
This is the beginning of Canto
XXIX,

00:24:40.598 --> 00:24:43.848
"When the two children of
Latona,

00:24:43.848 --> 00:24:47.009
covered by the Ram and by the
Scales,

00:24:47.009 --> 00:24:50.910
both at once make a belt of the
horizon,

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:55.876
as long as from the moment when
the zenith holds them balanced

00:24:55.876 --> 00:24:59.529
till the one and the other,
changing hemispheres,

00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:01.490
are unbalanced from that
girdle,

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.007
for so long,
have face illumined with a

00:25:05.007 --> 00:25:07.555
smile,
Beatrice kept silence,

00:25:07.555 --> 00:25:12.000
looking fixedly at the point
that had overcome me."

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.338
What an extraordinary image.
 

00:25:14.338 --> 00:25:16.729
Let's read it again so we make
sure that we understand it

00:25:16.729 --> 00:25:18.650
because I'm not sure that it's
very clear,

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.750
though I think it's--I can make
it clear but let's look at this

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.410
again.
 

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.178
"When the two children of
Latona,"

00:25:26.178 --> 00:25:28.769
meaning the Sun and the Moon,
that's really what he's saying.

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:33.461
He has to describe the fact
that Beatrice seems not to have

00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:37.587
kept quiet that she went
endlessly from one thing to

00:25:37.587 --> 00:25:40.279
another,
that's what I call the

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:42.740
playfulness of Dante's thinking.
 

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:48.010
He's saying that there was,
this is the image that he uses,

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.374
is when the children of Latona,
Apollo and Diana,

00:25:52.374 --> 00:25:56.009
you know that,
the Sun and the Moon.

00:25:56.009 --> 00:25:58.729
We're in the universe
of--though Dante is using

00:25:58.729 --> 00:26:01.507
mythical language,
look at the language first of

00:26:01.507 --> 00:26:01.980
all.
 

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.470
The two children of Latona,
myth;

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.679
"Covered by the Ram and
the Scales,"

00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:09.045
science,
"Both at once make a belt

00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:11.904
of the horizon,"
an Arabic word meaning the

00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:15.430
boundary of the heavens,
so science, scientific language.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.964
"As long as from that
moment when the zenith,"

00:26:17.964 --> 00:26:18.980
scientific language.
 

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.750
The mixture and balancing of
science and myth,

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.009
but also a way of talking about
the--

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:32.464
a balance that is as vanishing
and as fleeting as it could ever

00:26:32.464 --> 00:26:34.858
be, that's the point.
 

00:26:34.858 --> 00:26:38.779
That there was silence but he
could almost not even tell that

00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:41.460
there was a break in Beatrice's
speech.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.701
This is what he is saying,
when the two children of

00:26:45.701 --> 00:26:52.772
Latona,
the Sun or Apollo and the Moon,

00:26:52.772 --> 00:26:55.693
Diana,
along the horizon,

00:26:55.693 --> 00:26:59.270
they seem to be aligned
together and they are held

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.170
together by the zenith.
 

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.191
This is the zenith,
the highest point as opposed to

00:27:04.191 --> 00:27:05.338
the nadir, right?
 

00:27:05.338 --> 00:27:09.690
This is the balance that he's
describing.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:14.650
They are kept in a balance
here, in a rare equilibrium,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.795
when they appear,
seemed to be aligned together

00:27:17.795 --> 00:27:21.829
and that balance and equilibrium
is quickly disappearing.

00:27:21.829 --> 00:27:23.460
What is he saying?
 

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:27.920
He's saying that she almost
didn't stop speaking and then

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.538
she began, then she goes on with
the theory of creation.

00:27:32.538 --> 00:27:35.318
"I tell,
not ask, what you wouldst hear;

00:27:35.318 --> 00:27:38.355
for I have seen it there where
every ubi and every

00:27:38.355 --> 00:27:40.578
quando is centred,"
place,

00:27:40.578 --> 00:27:42.740
I have seen at a point where
place,

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.940
space, and time coincide.
 

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.598
"Not to gain any good for
Himself,

00:27:47.598 --> 00:27:50.279
which cannot be,
but that His splendour,

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:52.167
shining back,
might say,"

00:27:52.167 --> 00:27:54.096
I stay,
"Subsisto--in His

00:27:54.096 --> 00:27:55.269
eternity,
beyond time,

00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:58.240
beyond every other bound,
as it pleased Him,

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.500
the Eternal Love revealed
Himself in new loves."

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.493
I have to correct my good
friend, dear old friend

00:28:07.493 --> 00:28:13.009
Sinclair, because actually Dante
does not say that.

00:28:13.009 --> 00:28:18.900
He says that love,
the eternal love,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.470
actually the language which he
uses I don't know--

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.526
I hope your other
translations--those of you who

00:28:23.526 --> 00:28:25.190
use other translations are
luckier,

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:30.058
"opened itself in new
loves," opened itself.

00:28:30.058 --> 00:28:36.230
I take this to be a sexual
language as it can be found,

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:42.400
a new love engendered,
opened itself into new loves.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.413
Then it in fact continues,
"Nor, before,

00:28:45.413 --> 00:28:49.135
did He lie as it were inert;
for until God's moving upon

00:28:49.135 --> 00:28:52.282
these waters there was no
'before' or 'after.'"

00:28:52.282 --> 00:28:55.430
Before God's creation the
language is biblical,

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.653
from Genesis,
there was no before or nor

00:28:57.653 --> 00:28:58.108
after.
 

00:28:58.108 --> 00:29:00.672
In the physics,
this is an allusion to

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:04.066
Aristotle's physics,
where Aristotle has to define

00:29:04.066 --> 00:29:06.690
time;
he says it's the measure,

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:10.848
we speak of time when there is
a before and an after,

00:29:10.848 --> 00:29:13.970
because this is really what
time is.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:19.730
The measure of motion in regard
to a before and an after;

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.731
Dante says that before this
time of creation there was no

00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:23.430
such thing.
 

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:28.650
It could not be distinguished
before in terms of time,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.318
there was no such a thing as
before and after,

00:29:30.318 --> 00:29:33.057
and then he goes on just to
continue with this sexual

00:29:33.057 --> 00:29:35.345
metaphor,
"Form and matter,

00:29:35.345 --> 00:29:38.785
united and separate,
came into being that had no

00:29:38.785 --> 00:29:40.680
defect,
like three arrows from a

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.088
three-stringed bow."
 

00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:45.538
The question of creation as a
coming together of form and

00:29:45.538 --> 00:29:48.250
matter is here described as a
conjunction.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:51.726
It's the language of creation
takes place as an act of love,

00:29:51.726 --> 00:29:54.259
that's the first thing
Beatrice's saying.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:57.961
Creation comes through as
passion, a love passion,

00:29:57.961 --> 00:30:02.038
it's an opening up in--love
opening up in new loves.

00:30:02.038 --> 00:30:05.671
It's as physical,
the language of creation,

00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:10.770
as it could ever be in terms of
the natural, the language of

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.230
natural production and
reproduction.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.730
This is the context of what she
is saying, before and after.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:22.775
It is as if to have a creation,
creation is that which

00:30:22.775 --> 00:30:28.486
introduces the possibility of
distinguishing between a before

00:30:28.486 --> 00:30:32.846
and an after,
introduces a difference,

00:30:32.846 --> 00:30:37.368
that's what the language of
Beatrice is.

00:30:37.368 --> 00:30:40.390
Let me go back to the image
with which we started.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:48.009
Dante is wondering whether or
not there was any break in

00:30:48.009 --> 00:30:50.779
Beatrice's speech.
 

00:30:50.779 --> 00:30:55.222
He says if there was a break,
it was so fleeting as happens

00:30:55.222 --> 00:30:59.438
with whenever the Sun and the
Moon along the line of the

00:30:59.438 --> 00:31:03.448
horizon are going to be--
are aligned together and this

00:31:03.448 --> 00:31:07.025
is if they are balanced and are
held together by the zenith

00:31:07.025 --> 00:31:07.578
above.
 

00:31:07.578 --> 00:31:11.130
That is such a fleeting moment
in the alignment of the stars.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.690
Why this metaphor?
 

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:18.502
Not only he's saying that but I
think there is also an allusion

00:31:18.502 --> 00:31:20.910
to Francesca here in Canto V.
 

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.380
Did you catch it?
 

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.967
Where he says,
"for so long her face

00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:28.594
illumined with a smile,
Beatrice kept silence,"

00:31:28.594 --> 00:31:32.817
she just kept on talking,
"looking fixedly at the

00:31:32.817 --> 00:31:35.670
point that had overcome
me."

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:40.539
The point that had overcome me
is clearly an allusion to--not

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:45.085
only a point was that that
overcame us, Francesca says in

00:31:45.085 --> 00:31:46.058
Canto V.
 

00:31:46.058 --> 00:31:49.460
That's all, so there's an
illusion to Francesca.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.106
The question that I have to
answer that I raised with you is

00:31:53.106 --> 00:31:56.877
why is Dante mentioning these
two infernal figures and framing

00:31:56.877 --> 00:31:59.660
his discussion on cosmology of
creation,

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.890
first of all by talking about
Ulysses and now talking about,

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.720
or alluding to,
not even mentioning,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.548
but alluding to Francesca.
 

00:32:07.548 --> 00:32:11.450
Why this one who wants to
transgress and trespass the

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.750
boundaries of the world in order
to know,

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:19.611
the other one who transgresses
the norms of what is allowed

00:32:19.611 --> 00:32:21.118
because of love.
 

00:32:21.118 --> 00:32:25.128
Knowledge and love somehow come
into play but they are in the

00:32:25.128 --> 00:32:26.798
Inferno version.
 

00:32:26.798 --> 00:32:29.019
What is he saying though with
this image?

00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:33.949
Why has he talked about
Francesca, the Sun and the Moon

00:32:33.949 --> 00:32:38.240
align briefly,
what do you think he's saying?

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.597
It's not a rhetorical question;
let me just--why do you think

00:32:43.597 --> 00:32:45.618
he would use this kind of
language?

00:32:45.618 --> 00:32:48.048
Immediately,
after Beatrice goes on

00:32:48.048 --> 00:32:51.980
explaining the creation of the
world and the distinction

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.410
between a before and an after.
 

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.619
Why this metaphor?
 

00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:57.829
Why this long paragraph?
 

00:32:57.829 --> 00:33:03.880
This image here, anybody?
 

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.900
I think that Dante's asking
right here,

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:14.212
is it possible to localize a
break and he's saying it is as

00:33:14.212 --> 00:33:19.800
when we speak that things seem
to be continuous and just as in

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:25.298
every syllable between a sound
and another there is always an

00:33:25.298 --> 00:33:30.519
interval so there was in the
language of Beatrice,

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:34.098
and that's what to him is the
idea of creation.

00:33:34.098 --> 00:33:37.567
It seems to be--there is--the
opposite of creation would be

00:33:37.567 --> 00:33:40.795
the eternity of the world,
something which would be the

00:33:40.795 --> 00:33:44.332
universe is eternal;
it has no beginning and no

00:33:44.332 --> 00:33:45.950
identifiable break.
 

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.980
How can you tell?
 

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:52.838
If the universe is eternal you
have no differences inside it.

00:33:52.838 --> 00:33:57.794
Dante wants to say it seems to
be a continuous--the universe

00:33:57.794 --> 00:34:01.068
seems to have a continuous
extension.

00:34:01.068 --> 00:34:05.480
Without time a kind of
eternity, it goes on and on,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.690
and yet it's as when we speak
that you can identify the break,

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:15.690
there was however minute there
was a break between Beatrice's

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:20.442
exposition about the angelic
orders and now the exposition

00:34:20.442 --> 00:34:24.610
that she goes into about the--
about creation.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:28.097
Why then, the other two
metaphors, now it's time to

00:34:28.097 --> 00:34:31.722
answer that question,
why talking through Ulysses and

00:34:31.722 --> 00:34:32.699
Francesca?
 

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:34.670
Why evoke those two images?
 

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:40.170
I wish we could--I have to keep
that hanging awhile so it can

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:44.938
become a little bit more
compelling what I'm going to

00:34:44.938 --> 00:34:46.130
tell you.
 

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.326
With it order,
"And as a ray

00:34:49.326 --> 00:34:53.322
shines,"
Beatrice is continuing with

00:34:53.322 --> 00:34:57.349
form and matter,
united and separate,

00:34:57.349 --> 00:35:01.780
this is conjoined and pure,
pure and conjoined.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.876
She says, "as a ray shines
into glass or amber or crystal

00:35:04.876 --> 00:35:07.619
so that from its coming to its
completeness there is no

00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:09.952
interval,
so the threefold creation

00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:14.041
flashed into being from its Lord
all at once without distinction

00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:15.340
in its beginning.
 

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.126
With it, order was created and
ordained for the spirits,

00:35:19.126 --> 00:35:22.704
and these were the summit of
the universe in whom was

00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:25.121
produced pure act;
pure potency,"

00:35:25.121 --> 00:35:25.929
and so on."
 

00:35:25.929 --> 00:35:30.059
The idea is that there is a
universe of creation,

00:35:30.059 --> 00:35:34.429
the universe of creation which
seems to be very much like the

00:35:34.429 --> 00:35:38.929
physical world,
it's described in physical

00:35:38.929 --> 00:35:44.449
terms, the terms of the Moon and
sexuality,

00:35:44.449 --> 00:35:47.400
the cosmological language and
scientific terms,

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.099
and yet there is some kind of
difference that is introduced.

00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:54.739
Without creation we would not
have differences,

00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:57.840
we would not even have origins
that is the language.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.340
Now, why those two figures?
 

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:05.610
Why Ulysses and Francesca?
 

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.260
Ulysses, I think that what
Dante is doing,

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:14.690
finally is allowing us to see
what the world of Inferno

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.650
has to be seen as.
 

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.358
The world of Inferno
that we only saw as a world of

00:36:20.358 --> 00:36:24.155
rejected,
as a world of evil and horror,

00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:29.382
all of a sudden is now
retrieved as the best exemplar

00:36:29.382 --> 00:36:34.809
of what we may come to know of
the spiritual world.

00:36:34.809 --> 00:36:40.054
It is almost an imaginative
redemption that Dante goes into

00:36:40.054 --> 00:36:42.949
about the actual idea of hell.
 

00:36:42.949 --> 00:36:47.052
He's implying,
and that could become in many

00:36:47.052 --> 00:36:49.931
ways heretical,
but I hope to show you that it

00:36:49.931 --> 00:36:53.090
is not,
that the universe as it goes

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:57.409
back--as one goes back to the
beginnings,

00:36:57.409 --> 00:37:02.974
clearly the journey to the
beginnings has to be seen as

00:37:02.974 --> 00:37:07.510
redemption of order has been
falling away.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:11.210
Let me just say it in a
slightly less tortuous way.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:16.228
There can be no redemption
unless it implies that the whole

00:37:16.228 --> 00:37:19.429
of evil is overcome and
destroyed,

00:37:19.429 --> 00:37:24.038
so that even the world of hell
now appears all of a sudden as

00:37:24.038 --> 00:37:28.494
part of what we get to know
about the ultimate structure of

00:37:28.494 --> 00:37:29.800
the universe.
 

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.809
This seems to me to be the real
lesson,

00:37:34.809 --> 00:37:39.029
the underlying and powerful
message that Dante is sending

00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:43.400
through these three cantos in
the heaven of metaphysics.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.842
Let me stop here before I move
into the next canto,

00:37:46.842 --> 00:37:50.697
Canto XXX and see if there
are--let me take the questions

00:37:50.697 --> 00:37:53.590
now before we go on to the next
canto.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:58.690
I could go back maybe and try
to redo what I have been saying

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.331
because it's--
but let me see if there are

00:38:01.331 --> 00:38:03.280
some questions and then we can
do that,

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:03.869
please.
 

00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:05.731
Student:  Are you
suggesting

00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:07.210
&gt;
 

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:15.028
of the entire world creation is
redeemable including those

00:38:15.028 --> 00:38:18.869
&gt;?
 

00:38:18.869 --> 00:38:20.090
Prof: He never says that.
 

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.929
Let me be very, very clear.
 

00:38:22.929 --> 00:38:25.320
He never says it anywhere.
 

00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:31.150
There is never an indication
thematically,

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:35.101
there is everything else that I
have said I could find

00:38:35.101 --> 00:38:39.606
counterparts in a thematic,
thematized, in the sense that

00:38:39.606 --> 00:38:44.610
it becomes part of a conscious
articulation on the part of her;

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.612
he knows and he thematizes,
he makes it a theme clear,

00:38:48.612 --> 00:38:50.199
he never says that.
 

00:38:50.199 --> 00:38:56.186
But there are two implications
though that I'm drawing on in

00:38:56.186 --> 00:39:01.260
order to be able to make that
kind of statement.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:07.480
The first is the very idea of
the cosmos as a sphere,

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.639
and the idea of the cosmos as a
sphere,

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:14.612
it really means that wherever
you are going and you are going

00:39:14.612 --> 00:39:17.440
toward God,
then you are going back to the

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.755
beginning,
everything else can go back to

00:39:19.755 --> 00:39:21.829
the beginning because that's the
form,

00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:23.110
the shape of the cosmos.
 

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.822
I'm drawing out the implication
about this understanding of the

00:39:27.822 --> 00:39:28.659
universe.
 

00:39:28.659 --> 00:39:32.961
The other reason is that there
is such a thing as a redemption

00:39:32.961 --> 00:39:35.657
and Dante's--
we didn't read the canto,

00:39:35.657 --> 00:39:39.329
Canto VII of Paradise is
focused on redemption,

00:39:39.329 --> 00:39:43.090
a new beginning,
that's what redemption means.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.675
Redemption means that the
cosmos can go back to its

00:39:46.675 --> 00:39:50.190
beginning and be restored in its
original form.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:54.284
If this is true,
it could very well be that from

00:39:54.284 --> 00:39:59.422
the point of view of the poem,
Lucifer is always going to be

00:39:59.422 --> 00:40:01.949
stuck in his ice forever.
 

00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:04.869
There's no hint that he can
move even.

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:09.168
Francesca is always moving
around in vicious circles,

00:40:09.168 --> 00:40:13.550
remembering and then lost in
the labyrinth of time.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:16.710
To her, she literally moves in
time;

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:20.978
memory--cannot think about the
past without being moved by it

00:40:20.978 --> 00:40:23.610
and must move constantly around
it.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:27.018
Ulysses gets lost who knows
where,

00:40:27.018 --> 00:40:31.309
there is nowhere for him,
he has no sense of a place,

00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:35.969
even from this point of view I
can go on understanding that in

00:40:35.969 --> 00:40:40.586
a canto where a place matters,
Ulysses never had a sense of

00:40:40.586 --> 00:40:44.418
belonging anywhere,
that's the utter dislocation

00:40:44.418 --> 00:40:47.342
and a kind of--
he doesn't have a family that

00:40:47.342 --> 00:40:48.871
holds him back,
the children,

00:40:48.871 --> 00:40:50.280
the kingdom,
Ithaca, anything,

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.000
he just goes on moving.
 

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.480
That is the overt sense of the
poem,

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.768
but there is this theology of
redemption,

00:40:58.768 --> 00:41:03.494
and I'm wondering whether
theology of redemption does not

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:08.639
entail necessarily that there is
a return to the beginning.

00:41:08.639 --> 00:41:12.369
Before I go on though with
restatements of this--

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:18.480
I want to ask you to--because I
think it's one of the--

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.340
a technique that Dante uses
which is really extraordinary,

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.469
can you go to the beginning of
canto--

00:41:24.469 --> 00:41:32.869
the famous image of Latona when
the two children of Latona--

00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:36.467
beginning of Canto XXIX,
I really would like to ask you

00:41:36.467 --> 00:41:39.000
to look at the Italian a little
bit.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.045
I'm not going to read it,
I'm not going to ask you to

00:41:43.045 --> 00:41:48.179
read, I'm only going to ask you
to look, I won't read it though.

00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:51.659
At the first word,
quando right?

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:55.449
You all see that,
and look at line--

00:41:55.449 --> 00:41:59.478
that's really the proem,
what we call rhetorically the

00:41:59.478 --> 00:42:02.623
prosthesis of the canto,
the beginning of the canto,

00:42:02.623 --> 00:42:03.880
the introduction of the canto.
 

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.653
Go to line 12,
the last word,

00:42:06.653 --> 00:42:08.239
quando.
 

00:42:08.239 --> 00:42:14.804
Go to the first--back to the
first line, the last word in

00:42:14.804 --> 00:42:17.150
that line, Latona.
 

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.280
He says, "of Latona."
 

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.340
The first two letters
"la"

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.380
go back to canto--
to line 12, the first two

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.679
letters "la,"
draw this--

00:42:29.679 --> 00:42:32.829
that's a chiasmus,
draw the lines together,

00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:37.119
and they will meet exactly at
the word hemisphere,

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:40.329
emisfero,
that's the center.

00:42:40.329 --> 00:42:44.239
That's the--hemisphere means
that they are--it's

00:42:44.239 --> 00:42:48.565
half--hemi--the Greek is
the two half spheres,

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:52.809
the universe is two half
spheres composing one.

00:42:52.809 --> 00:42:59.010
I think Dante's placing us at a
cosmic crossroads.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:02.956
He is locating us,
he's telling us where we are

00:43:02.956 --> 00:43:06.833
first of all,
but he's also telling us that

00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:12.190
this universe has a kind of very
occult and very secret laws.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:16.039
The poem has these secret laws
that regulate it.

00:43:16.039 --> 00:43:23.644
I'm really arguing then that
there is this subtext that is if

00:43:23.644 --> 00:43:31.123
a radical redemptive theology
would only entail the absolute

00:43:31.123 --> 00:43:37.083
purification of evil,
so that the universe will have

00:43:37.083 --> 00:43:41.969
to really go back to this kind
of Pythagorean purity,

00:43:41.969 --> 00:43:45.000
but without the phases and
descents.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.871
These are--you know what I mean
all of you, this Pythagorean

00:43:49.871 --> 00:43:54.414
idea that the life of the
universe stretches for 360,000

00:43:54.414 --> 00:43:55.239
years.
 

00:43:55.239 --> 00:43:56.530
Did you ever hear about that?
 

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:01.528
360,000 years which are really
like the days of the year,

00:44:01.528 --> 00:44:07.090
the 365 I think we have;
360,000 years.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.724
Every 360,000 years the
universe rotates and goes back

00:44:10.724 --> 00:44:13.329
to its point of origin and then
it--

00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:15.760
decadence starts again,
the age of gold,

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.889
the age of silver,
the age of iron,

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:21.789
the age of paper we would call
it now.

00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:26.259
It goes back to its origin,
that's not the way Dante

00:44:26.259 --> 00:44:29.940
understands the movement of the
cosmos,

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:36.387
but he does understand the--he
does present this redemptive

00:44:36.387 --> 00:44:43.389
event that makes the universe
return to its pristine purity,

00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:45.760
that's why I made that
statement.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.164
Any other points before I go
back because I really think I

00:44:50.164 --> 00:44:53.179
should say all of what I said
before.

00:44:53.179 --> 00:44:57.018
Any other questions so I can
help clarify these various

00:44:57.018 --> 00:44:57.659
points?
 

00:44:57.659 --> 00:44:59.699
Yes.
 

00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:02.010
Student:  What is the
redemptive event?

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:02.860
Prof: I'm sorry.
 

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.199
Student:  What is the
redemptive event?

00:45:04.199 --> 00:45:05.539
Prof: The incarnation.
 

00:45:05.539 --> 00:45:09.894
The incarnation is the
redemptive event that allows--it

00:45:09.894 --> 00:45:12.880
means what is the redemptive
event?

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.248
The incarnation,
I call it redemptive event that

00:45:16.248 --> 00:45:19.110
would make the--
a new creation,

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:24.869
a new Adam has come into the
world and that new Adam,

00:45:24.869 --> 00:45:30.663
through the sacrifice,
his sacrifice through the gift

00:45:30.663 --> 00:45:33.643
God gave--
allowed the incarnation because

00:45:33.643 --> 00:45:36.190
human beings on their own would
not be capable.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.480
That's the theology of
redemption.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.184
Human beings on their own would
not be able to save and redeem

00:45:43.184 --> 00:45:46.809
themselves so that an
intervention from God,

00:45:46.809 --> 00:45:51.117
through his son,
was made inevitable in order to

00:45:51.117 --> 00:45:55.974
reconstruct and in order to
bring out and produce that

00:45:55.974 --> 00:45:59.000
original order of the cosmos.
 

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.949
If that is true,
and it is true,

00:46:00.949 --> 00:46:04.409
and you only have to look at
everywhere in the poem,

00:46:04.409 --> 00:46:06.635
but Canto VII of
Paradise,

00:46:06.635 --> 00:46:10.391
that's really where it is an
annunciation of this whole

00:46:10.391 --> 00:46:14.239
theory in the terms of--
for those of you who are,

00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:18.313
Anselm, etc.,
then that implies that there

00:46:18.313 --> 00:46:23.760
must be some kind of general
remaking of the world.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.289
That's what I think the
idea--but nonetheless this

00:46:27.289 --> 00:46:31.541
should not obscure the fact that
there is a kind of a paired

00:46:31.541 --> 00:46:35.286
juxtaposition between the
physical description of the

00:46:35.286 --> 00:46:39.250
world and the spiritual
description of the world.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.539
There are two hemispheres and
yet they are connected;

00:46:42.539 --> 00:46:44.865
the spiritual,
the creation,

00:46:44.865 --> 00:46:49.777
the experience of creation is
really the way of positing a

00:46:49.777 --> 00:46:54.000
distinctionary difference into
the universe--

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.590
into the theory that the world
is eternal.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:02.739
They are two conceptions that,
operative in the Middle Ages,

00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:06.260
and they are really represented
by--

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:11.248
one is by Aquinas who is a
theologian but he is also a

00:47:11.248 --> 00:47:13.440
philosopher,
and in fact,

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.757
he could be called as the
writer who wants to make a

00:47:16.757 --> 00:47:18.449
philosophical theology.
 

00:47:18.449 --> 00:47:23.670
He argues, he's known for the
famous Suma;

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:27.300
he wrote a track called Suma
Against the Gentiles,

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:32.550
not the Suma of Theology
but Summa Contra Gentiles

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:36.719
where he argues that the
eternity of the world,

00:47:36.719 --> 00:47:39.070
the theory of the eternity of
the world,

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.820
that is to say there is no
creation,

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.699
he says could be
philosophically demonstrated.

00:47:44.699 --> 00:47:49.130
It could also be
philosophically repudiated.

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:54.096
Philosophy can argue one side
of it, and he goes on arguing

00:47:54.096 --> 00:47:58.891
that there is no way of thinking
of--the usual questions,

00:47:58.891 --> 00:48:01.289
who created the Creator?
 

00:48:01.289 --> 00:48:04.570
That kind of--the oldest,
these objections.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:10.163
However, there is a view of
creation which is allowed and

00:48:10.163 --> 00:48:13.860
it's possible on account of
faith,

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.949
but it also allows for the
thought of freedom,

00:48:17.949 --> 00:48:21.639
origins, beginnings, etc.
 

00:48:21.639 --> 00:48:25.574
Bonaventure picks up some of
these ideas, the ideas debated

00:48:25.574 --> 00:48:29.510
in Paris in the thirteenth
century around 1270 in Paris.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:32.449
Both of them are teachers at
the university.

00:48:32.449 --> 00:48:35.027
Bonaventure says no,
this is untenable,

00:48:35.027 --> 00:48:37.739
the idea of the eternity of the
world.

00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:41.557
It is absolutely untenable,
because if the world were

00:48:41.557 --> 00:48:45.010
eternal then we really would
have no way of--

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.864
no real succession of
generations, there would be

00:48:48.864 --> 00:48:52.800
endless people who have been
living before us,

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.760
there's no evidence for this,
it would be endless forms of--

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.110
he holds, and he upholds the
idea of creation.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:04.650
Dante intervenes into this
debate and says,

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:09.126
that it is effectively the
physical world and the spiritual

00:49:09.126 --> 00:49:13.797
world are really one continuous,
they're one complimentary to

00:49:13.797 --> 00:49:16.431
the other,
and yet there is a difference

00:49:16.431 --> 00:49:19.603
between them,
and the difference between them

00:49:19.603 --> 00:49:23.800
is the difference that he can
find in Beatrice's speech,

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.679
that little point of time,
that little intrusion of time

00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:31.699
that distinguishes between one
sound and another sound.

00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:35.083
The spiritual universe
originates in the world of

00:49:35.083 --> 00:49:38.679
nature as a natural production
and reproduction,

00:49:38.679 --> 00:49:42.833
all of God's love and the
physical world in exactly the

00:49:42.833 --> 00:49:43.679
same way.
 

00:49:43.679 --> 00:49:46.179
There is a kind of symmetry.
 

00:49:46.179 --> 00:49:49.679
This is not Plato's inverted
universe.

00:49:49.679 --> 00:49:53.574
The physical world is not
Plato's inverted world,

00:49:53.574 --> 00:49:55.360
it's adjacent to it.
 

00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:00.918
It is as if Dante discovers
that there are more dimensions

00:50:00.918 --> 00:50:06.768
to the world that we see than
what medieval cosmologists,

00:50:06.768 --> 00:50:09.750
or classical cosmologists had
imagined.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:12.956
Interestingly enough,
and I don't say this is a proof

00:50:12.956 --> 00:50:15.300
for any of what I have said at
all,

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:18.260
but there's a famous
nineteenth-century mathematician

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:21.179
by the name of Riemann,
a German mathematician.

00:50:21.179 --> 00:50:24.822
I don't know how many of you
studied history of science,

00:50:24.822 --> 00:50:28.532
he was--he's known among other
things for having been the

00:50:28.532 --> 00:50:31.050
mathematics professor of
Einstein.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:35.552
Well he went on with a team of
his students studying these

00:50:35.552 --> 00:50:39.898
cantos of the Divine
Comedy to find evidence that

00:50:39.898 --> 00:50:44.639
in fact Dante had already a
theory of fourth dimension,

00:50:44.639 --> 00:50:47.023
that there is the universe that
we see and then there is another

00:50:47.023 --> 00:50:47.440
universe.
 

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.929
It is almost as if the folds of
books,

00:50:50.929 --> 00:50:55.179
the folds of the parchments are
exactly giving an idea--

00:50:55.179 --> 00:50:58.717
that's Riemann's,
not me, an idea about what the

00:50:58.717 --> 00:51:01.880
actual structure of the universe
may be.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.449
Having said this,
don't forget to turn back to me

00:51:05.449 --> 00:51:09.840
my shell, the emblem of what I
take very good--thank you.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.773
Let me see if there are some
questions because I--we can go

00:51:13.773 --> 00:51:16.760
on now talking about some of
these issues.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.190
Please.
 

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:22.744
Student:  I'm still not
quite clear as to how in

00:51:22.744 --> 00:51:27.467
reference to Ulysses and
Francesca in these cantos relate

00:51:27.467 --> 00:51:32.527
Beatrice's description of the
universe and redemption back to

00:51:32.527 --> 00:51:36.914
Inferno and how the
redemption of the universe

00:51:36.914 --> 00:51:42.650
necessarily implicates including
Inferno as well as--

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:46.601
Prof: Excellent question
and I really welcome your

00:51:46.601 --> 00:51:47.518
skepticism.
 

00:51:47.518 --> 00:51:52.324
The question is about how
exactly do the figures of

00:51:52.324 --> 00:51:58.090
Ulysses and Francesca shed light
on what's happening here?

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:04.034
Is it really tenable that
Dante's implying that

00:52:04.034 --> 00:52:10.237
those--that the sinners are
going to be redeemed,

00:52:10.237 --> 00:52:11.530
saved?
 

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.190
More or less that's--
Student:  Yeah and why?

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:19.510
Why they're brought up--how
they fit into that explanation?

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:23.489
Prof: Good,
I figure that's a crucial

00:52:23.489 --> 00:52:24.230
issue.
 

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:29.592
It's interesting that Dante
should look at Ulysses and bring

00:52:29.592 --> 00:52:33.320
up the image of Ulysses in Canto
XXVII.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.072
I find it interesting in
that--and Dante,

00:52:36.072 --> 00:52:39.239
one can say,
Dante is really unlike Ulysses.

00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:43.092
Now he probably realizes how
different he is from Ulysses

00:52:43.092 --> 00:52:47.681
because Ulysses went to--
he's implying how risky his own

00:52:47.681 --> 00:52:51.650
enterprise may be which we have
seen before.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:55.739
Ulysses was brought up in this
journey in canto--

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.949
with the meeting with the dream
of a siren was--

00:52:57.949 --> 00:53:02.139
happened even before indirectly
many of the--

00:53:02.139 --> 00:53:06.257
in some other cases XXVI,
in Canto I of Inferno

00:53:06.257 --> 00:53:09.193
even,
and maybe we could just stop

00:53:09.193 --> 00:53:12.585
there and say well,
Dante's still--that's a kind of

00:53:12.585 --> 00:53:14.030
retrospective fascination.
 

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:20.231
He's looking back and
pinpointing that tragic moment

00:53:20.231 --> 00:53:24.280
because--
he calls it the mad track of

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.226
Ulysses,
the madness implies that

00:53:27.226 --> 00:53:30.440
he--this man had violated the
limits,

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.639
own limits, including the
limits of reason in his rational

00:53:34.639 --> 00:53:37.641
pursuit,
philosophical investigation of

00:53:37.641 --> 00:53:40.663
the world,
the scientific--he wants to go

00:53:40.663 --> 00:53:43.052
into the--
unpeopled world to have

00:53:43.052 --> 00:53:45.983
experience,
that's the key word for him and

00:53:45.983 --> 00:53:49.510
yet that madness implies that he
had been delirious,

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:52.860
had been going off the track.
 

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:57.210
Dante maybe that too,
but maybe not,

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.380
maybe I'm really a little safer
now,

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.300
I'm in the hands of Beatrice,
she's guiding me,

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:06.635
a way of trusting Beatrice so
we could say that that is all

00:54:06.635 --> 00:54:11.268
true and therefore I could even
see an element of relief on the

00:54:11.268 --> 00:54:13.730
part of Dante,
we would even catch that.

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:19.045
The relief is that his own
adventure diminishes the epic,

00:54:19.045 --> 00:54:23.413
the Greek epic hero,
he really did very little,

00:54:23.413 --> 00:54:27.969
he just went beyond the Pillars
of Hercules.

00:54:27.969 --> 00:54:29.579
That's all, we could stop there.
 

00:54:29.579 --> 00:54:32.322
It happens though,
retrospectively,

00:54:32.322 --> 00:54:36.597
we can see the story of Ulysses
as also the story of a

00:54:36.597 --> 00:54:38.050
metaphysician.
 

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:41.639
Dante is in the heaven of
metaphysics, in what way is he

00:54:41.639 --> 00:54:44.969
in the place of--what does
metaphysics deal with?

00:54:44.969 --> 00:54:48.380
It deals with place,
deals with time,

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.349
and then we can understand why
Ulysses in Canto XXVI,

00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:56.407
he seems to be going from place
to place is the metaphor that

00:54:56.407 --> 00:54:58.429
distinguishes Ulysses.
 

00:54:58.429 --> 00:55:01.530
Then Dante says,
he's a failed metaphysician,

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.753
but we understand that he
really was going to the

00:55:03.753 --> 00:55:05.960
absolute,
he really was trying to go

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.690
where I'm going and there is
nothing else.

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:09.599
We stop there.
 

00:55:09.599 --> 00:55:13.739
We go to Beatrice,
Dante meets--is talking to--

00:55:13.739 --> 00:55:19.878
is listening to Beatrice in
Canto XXIX and he's trying to

00:55:19.878 --> 00:55:25.800
figure out if it's possible to
think of a beginning.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.114
How do things--you have the
eternity of forms and you have

00:55:31.114 --> 00:55:35.463
the eternity of matter,
it's very difficult to know how

00:55:35.463 --> 00:55:38.998
you could really distinguish
anything that was before from

00:55:38.998 --> 00:55:41.764
what goes after,
there is no such a thing as a

00:55:41.764 --> 00:55:42.869
before and an after.
 

00:55:42.869 --> 00:55:46.530
He tries to localize time,
that's really the problem.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:53.105
To localize time he says that
he really--Beatrice looked and

00:55:53.105 --> 00:56:00.237
reminded him of the point--there
was a point of joy that overcame

00:56:00.237 --> 00:56:01.130
him.
 

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:04.327
Maybe he's alluding,
because the language is that of

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:06.210
Francesca, so why Francesca?
 

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.903
Let me just explain it at one
point, maybe he's alluding to a

00:56:09.903 --> 00:56:12.489
kiss the two of them--that he
remembers.

00:56:12.489 --> 00:56:15.639
It's sort of very spiritualized
the context;

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:18.434
Dante's never vulgar,
maybe he's just alluding to a

00:56:18.434 --> 00:56:21.554
kiss they had been exchanging,
or maybe the will,

00:56:21.554 --> 00:56:24.739
the desire, the longing to have
a kiss now,

00:56:24.739 --> 00:56:26.179
exchange a kiss with her.
 

00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:29.418
One thing is clear,
that he's thinking of Francesca

00:56:29.418 --> 00:56:33.369
as also a kind of metaphysician
because that's what we are.

00:56:33.369 --> 00:56:36.159
What is the metaphysics of
Francesca?

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:38.471
Metaphysics of desire,
first of all,

00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:42.500
a desire that--what does it
mean the metaphysics of desire?

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:46.541
Desire by its own definition is
metaphysical in the sense that

00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:50.253
it's always moving beyond the
objects it gains because it

00:56:50.253 --> 00:56:52.440
burns up the various objects.
 

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.619
Today I want this book,
then I want another book,

00:56:54.619 --> 00:56:56.659
and then I want the car,
and then I want the library,

00:56:56.659 --> 00:57:00.528
etc., that's the infinite
movement of desire which is what

00:57:00.528 --> 00:57:04.090
we call metaphysics of desire,
so she's a metaphysician.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.570
Not only she's as
metaphysician,

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:10.489
she lives in time,
so she's a complimentary figure

00:57:10.489 --> 00:57:11.690
to Ulysses.
 

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.840
Ulysses is, you remember,
is &gt;

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:19.012
Cauta, I left behind me Seville
and then I, etc.,

00:57:19.012 --> 00:57:19.659
etc.
 

00:57:19.659 --> 00:57:23.418
Now, Francesca instead says how
difficult it is to remember the

00:57:23.418 --> 00:57:24.570
joys of the past.
 

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:28.199
I remember I was reading,
that day I began reading,

00:57:28.199 --> 00:57:31.519
that day I stopped reading,
only a point was that that

00:57:31.519 --> 00:57:35.349
overcame at that point of time,
a point of the book, etc.

00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:38.867
Maybe Dante's really saying she
too is another failed

00:57:38.867 --> 00:57:39.949
metaphysician.
 

00:57:39.949 --> 00:57:44.423
They would like to be where I
am now, both Francesca and

00:57:44.423 --> 00:57:49.550
Ulysses, so we are bringing them
to the place where Dante is.

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:54.510
Now, they are looking for the
same thing he is having now,

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:56.809
a conjunction of time and
eternity,

00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:59.739
space and time,
ubi and quando,

00:57:59.739 --> 00:58:02.610
to see the point where all
things cohere.

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:05.449
That's exactly where he is
looking.

00:58:05.449 --> 00:58:07.750
How do I make things cohere?
 

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:12.465
Of course it's possible to
think--one way of thinking of

00:58:12.465 --> 00:58:17.782
Paradise and the joy of
the blessed is to go on thinking

00:58:17.782 --> 00:58:20.913
that my joy--
suppose that I were saved,

00:58:20.913 --> 00:58:22.780
a very unlikely proposition.
 

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:28.340
My joy, it's possible to argue,
is increased by--

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.679
it's sadistic,
the view of those who are

00:58:30.679 --> 00:58:34.155
suffering,
mercifully, I am saying that to

00:58:34.155 --> 00:58:39.375
me it's the most improbable form
of beatitude but it's likely

00:58:39.375 --> 00:58:45.030
that seeing someone downtrodden
and punished right like that,

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:48.300
could be that Dante is saying,
how lucky I am that I'm neither

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.500
like Ulysses nor like really
Francesca.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:53.460
I don't think that that's Dante
though.

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:58.309
He's talking about cosmology
and creation,

00:58:58.309 --> 00:59:02.231
the order of everything,
how this order is an order of

00:59:02.231 --> 00:59:06.300
love and now he's coming to know
this order of love,

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.679
because now knowledge is love
and love is knowledge.

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:14.485
I think that by the allusion to
them he's also saying that here

00:59:14.485 --> 00:59:18.737
on earth you can grant me that,
that's what I said before,

00:59:18.737 --> 00:59:21.847
and I think that I'm not
pushing it to the point of

00:59:21.847 --> 00:59:23.030
unbelievability.
 

00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:24.710
The whole argument becomes
unbelievable,

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:27.909
I can stay here and say,
well now--what he's really

00:59:27.909 --> 00:59:31.559
saying is that I am here and I
see how things go here,

00:59:31.559 --> 00:59:34.409
but I know that sinful people
on Earth,

00:59:34.409 --> 00:59:37.710
those of us who live in the
shadows of time,

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:42.389
this tree and we're under the
leaves of time,

00:59:42.389 --> 00:59:48.280
then I know that in a sinful
way they were trying to do and

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:52.650
know what I now have come to do
and know.

00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:55.074
I could stop here and say well
we're all happy,

00:59:55.074 --> 00:59:57.762
there's no argument,
I think that that makes logical

00:59:57.762 --> 00:59:58.289
sense.
 

00:59:58.289 --> 01:00:02.920
I can push it to the point of
absurdity,

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.978
to say look maybe if this is
true, he's also saying not only

01:00:07.978 --> 01:00:11.554
that they in a shadowy way,
in a dim way,

01:00:11.554 --> 01:00:16.119
were anticipating the real
happiness in the sinful modes,

01:00:16.119 --> 01:00:19.554
the sinners,
but that maybe they too if you

01:00:19.554 --> 01:00:23.668
move out of this text--
as you know this is not said in

01:00:23.668 --> 01:00:27.929
the text that they too will be--
are going to be taken and

01:00:27.929 --> 01:00:33.039
placed into the bosom of Abraham
where all the blessed dwell.

01:00:33.039 --> 01:00:37.099
Maybe too this is--is it my
wishful thinking?

01:00:37.099 --> 01:00:40.161
I grant you,
it's probably wishful thinking

01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:44.606
but I do have the theology of
redemption behind me that stands

01:00:44.606 --> 01:00:48.690
as uttered by Dante in Canto VII
of Paradise.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:53.960
I restated the whole thing in
two minutes, that's not bad.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.070
Thank you.
 

01:00:55.070 --> 01:01:00.110
Other questions before we go
back to--please.

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:02.320
Student:  Can you
comment on the presence of

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.239
Francesca, also in light of this
sexual language that comes out?

01:01:05.239 --> 01:01:09.411
Prof: Yes,
can I comment about Francesca

01:01:09.411 --> 01:01:14.581
in the fact that there is--the
creation is given in sexual

01:01:14.581 --> 01:01:15.489
terms.
 

01:01:15.489 --> 01:01:21.380
That this is love that opens
itself--opens itself to new

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.309
loves and so on.
 

01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:29.891
I cannot help but play a little
bit of an etymological game too,

01:01:29.891 --> 01:01:36.056
by the way, because this is the
world of origins and I don't

01:01:36.056 --> 01:01:38.250
want to lose you.
 

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:41.059
I know there is only one class
but I don't want to lose you.

01:01:41.059 --> 01:01:44.268
Of course the only--the way in
which Dante's conveying all

01:01:44.268 --> 01:01:47.139
these senses is by playing with
the etymologies,

01:01:47.139 --> 01:01:51.170
because etymology is the
science of the origin of words,

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.329
so let me give you only one.
 

01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:56.719
I corrected my good friend
Sinclair,

01:01:56.719 --> 01:01:59.418
inseparable from me,
I mean, I'm never going to

01:01:59.418 --> 01:02:01.192
betray him,
but I have to correct him

01:02:01.192 --> 01:02:02.565
because he says
"revealed,"

01:02:02.565 --> 01:02:03.480
that's what he means.
 

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.849
The eternal love revealed
itself a new love.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:13.525
He is missing the whole sexual
language which is exactly the

01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:15.449
reason, thank you.
 

01:02:15.449 --> 01:02:20.068
That's exactly the reason why I
think that Francesca too can

01:02:20.068 --> 01:02:23.750
arguably be saved,
that's exactly the reason.

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:28.329
The term he uses is
aperse,

01:02:28.329 --> 01:02:31.038
from the Italian,
in Italian we call it

01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:34.514
aprire,
very close to in English we

01:02:34.514 --> 01:02:39.423
have the word April,
by the way, as an opening of

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:40.300
spring.
 

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.760
Just to give you a sense of
etymology,

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:49.416
it comes from aperire
Latin which really means to

01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:53.268
generate,
to bring to light,

01:02:53.268 --> 01:02:59.268
as a woman brings a birth to
light and life.

01:02:59.268 --> 01:03:02.186
That's really the word,
that's the meaning of the word,

01:03:02.186 --> 01:03:04.940
so it's as sexual and as
productive as it can be.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:08.385
Before I go back though to your
question about how is Dante

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:11.679
going to--
what Dante is saying is that

01:03:11.679 --> 01:03:16.134
creation is the sexual process,
the sexual experience,

01:03:16.134 --> 01:03:18.900
which is exactly what Francesca
also did,

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.980
breaking the law undoubtedly.
 

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.969
She is in hell,
is she going to be in hell?

01:03:24.969 --> 01:03:28.440
Are we going to understand that
there is a possible continuity

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.684
between what she did in a
physical sense and what Dante is

01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:33.449
doing in a spiritual sense?
 

01:03:33.449 --> 01:03:37.673
This is the whole point of the
discussion on cosmology and

01:03:37.673 --> 01:03:38.489
creation.
 

01:03:38.489 --> 01:03:41.184
That there is some kind of
continuity between the two

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.480
modes;
not quite the same thing;

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:46.579
of course, creation is a
different order of experience.

01:03:46.579 --> 01:03:50.655
There is a very thin line,
it's like a little breath

01:03:50.655 --> 01:03:55.452
of--breath that Francesca can
release at sea--or Beatrice who

01:03:55.452 --> 01:03:57.849
goes on talking endlessly.
 

01:03:57.849 --> 01:04:01.639
She too, that's the difference
between the two,

01:04:01.639 --> 01:04:03.679
so between the language of
sexuality,

01:04:03.679 --> 01:04:05.800
of physicality in
Inferno,

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.387
and the language of
spirituality here in

01:04:08.387 --> 01:04:11.505
Paradise,
the line that is continuing

01:04:11.505 --> 01:04:15.146
between them and there is a
little difference but there is

01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:17.639
also a possibility of a
continuity,

01:04:17.639 --> 01:04:22.672
that's really exactly the
argument that I would make about

01:04:22.672 --> 01:04:23.289
that.
 

01:04:23.289 --> 01:04:27.882
Let me though tell you more,
in a historical way,

01:04:27.882 --> 01:04:32.858
so that if you don't agree with
what I said so be it,

01:04:32.858 --> 01:04:34.389
don't worry.
 

01:04:34.389 --> 01:04:39.413
I don't agree with it
completely on my own but I think

01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:44.246
that this--that's a radical
reading of the notion of

01:04:44.246 --> 01:04:47.659
cosmology and creation in Dante.
 

01:04:47.659 --> 01:04:50.219
Let me tell you something else
historically.

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:54.268
Where is Dante taking these
ideas from?

01:04:54.268 --> 01:04:58.300
Whenever you read commentaries
on Dante,

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:02.259
and I hope that some of you
will go on reading and reading

01:05:02.259 --> 01:05:05.721
also scholars,
thank you, critics--I see that

01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:10.510
nodding is just--
my heart it just gladdens when

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.880
I see that.
 

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.465
They all tell you--and I
indicated that too that Dante is

01:05:15.465 --> 01:05:19.820
some kind of an Aristotelian and
I was talking about metaphysics,

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.739
how Aristotle calls it first
philosophy,

01:05:23.739 --> 01:05:25.280
Aristotelian terms.
 

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.070
They never tell you where the
actual sources of Dante are.

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:36.355
The sources of Dante about
cosmology and cosmography are

01:05:36.355 --> 01:05:38.869
really neo-platonic.
 

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:43.920
The idea of creation,
especially one text that I have

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.197
to mention,
this guy who writes the

01:05:47.197 --> 01:05:51.782
Cosmographia called a
twelfth-century man Bernard

01:05:51.782 --> 01:05:54.882
Sylvester,
a Frenchman,

01:05:54.882 --> 01:06:03.099
Bernard Sylvester who writes
Cosmographia,

01:06:03.099 --> 01:06:08.429
twelfth century known as the
author of School of Chartres.

01:06:08.429 --> 01:06:11.780
By the way this text were
available to Dante,

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:16.809
we have a text of this man,
Cosmographia,

01:06:16.809 --> 01:06:19.018
one copy only because a
Florentine,

01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:23.480
later--he had it in Florence,
by the name of Boccaccio,

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.344
some of you know very well,
he copied it down and

01:06:26.344 --> 01:06:27.539
transmitted to us.
 

01:06:27.539 --> 01:06:31.150
We know his handwriting because
we have his texts so we know,

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:35.940
this is 1340,
Dante of course wrote about

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.125
1302,
but clearly that text was

01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:38.909
available then.
 

01:06:38.909 --> 01:06:42.163
In this text,
Bernard gives an idea of

01:06:42.163 --> 01:06:46.559
creation and cosmological ideas,
physical ideas.

01:06:46.559 --> 01:06:49.306
They had been reading the
Timaeus in France and

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:51.949
they were always surprised and
wondering what is the

01:06:51.949 --> 01:06:54.949
difference,
how can we go on having Plato

01:06:54.949 --> 01:06:59.739
say one thing about creation and
Genesis saying something else?

01:06:59.739 --> 01:07:04.360
How are we going to connect
these two forms,

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:09.409
these two sources of tradition
and authority?

01:07:09.409 --> 01:07:16.291
They argue, he goes on talking
about the idea of a pre-existing

01:07:16.291 --> 01:07:18.289
world of matter.
 

01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:24.125
The natural world and a
malignant materiality and how

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:29.960
this malignant materiality is
subdued into shape,

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.929
and the subduing into shape is
always sexual language.

01:07:34.929 --> 01:07:38.579
Matura is that which
produces,

01:07:38.579 --> 01:07:43.289
generates, this is the text
that I believe stands behind

01:07:43.289 --> 01:07:48.768
Dante's physical explanation of
a universe which is physical,

01:07:48.768 --> 01:07:52.289
but at the same time it is not
just physical.

01:07:52.289 --> 01:07:56.199
It is also a theory of creation
and it's the theory of creation

01:07:56.199 --> 01:07:58.659
that has unpredictable
possibilities.

01:07:58.659 --> 01:08:01.250
This tells you that things can
be renewed.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:04.362
If you stay within the
bound--you see how he criticizes

01:08:04.362 --> 01:08:06.610
the physical conception of the
world.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:09.454
If you stay within those
boundaries you can't expect

01:08:09.454 --> 01:08:11.909
anything other than what you
already have.

01:08:11.909 --> 01:08:15.405
You cannot expect anymore evil
or any less evil than what you

01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:16.630
already experience.
 

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:20.149
The only idea,
the way in which human beings

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:24.856
can think about renewal,
can think about change or

01:08:24.856 --> 01:08:30.850
freedom, or origins is only
within the context of creation.

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:34.680
That's exactly Dante's argument
and that's the profound

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.440
justification for the
distinction between one order of

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:42.060
experience and a different order
of experience.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.640
But if this is true,
and it is true for Dante,

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.210
then I have to take also
seriously this idea of--

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:52.873
this central event of
redemption, which now we

01:08:52.873 --> 01:08:57.189
understand what he takes that to
mean: the moment,

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:59.788
the experience of the
incarnation.

01:08:59.788 --> 01:09:03.698
This is exactly--it follows--if
he has to--

01:09:03.698 --> 01:09:05.859
if he believes that there is
such a thing as--

01:09:05.859 --> 01:09:09.194
and he does--creation then he
has to believe that there is

01:09:09.194 --> 01:09:13.328
also the idea of recreation,
a second creation because the

01:09:13.328 --> 01:09:18.130
first creation clearly didn't
work out all that well so there

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.449
is this other possibility.
 

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.538
Please.
 

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:31.390
Student:  I have the
sense that in these lines at the

01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:34.720
beginning of XXIX that we've
been talking about,

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.911
that Dante is very aware of
being on theological thin ice or

01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:44.689
skating close to the danger
line,

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:53.626
but the idea is the divine love
spills over out into a created

01:09:53.626 --> 01:09:59.779
world so that it can be
reflected back,

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:05.135
endured, and loved in return in
the way that Paolo and Francesca

01:10:05.135 --> 01:10:06.750
loved each other.
 

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:14.341
That's not far from the thought
that before creation God has

01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:22.447
everything but is still a little
lonely and that suggests a kind

01:10:22.447 --> 01:10:27.127
of imperfection,
or at least incompleteness,

01:10:27.127 --> 01:10:29.399
but how can God be incomplete?
 

01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:36.609
Dante begins this passage by
saying, not to acquire new

01:10:36.609 --> 01:10:39.896
goodness for himself;
this is the

01:10:39.896 --> 01:10:40.409
&gt;
 

01:10:40.409 --> 01:10:41.880
translation, which cannot be.
 

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.118
Prof: That's perfect.
 

01:10:43.118 --> 01:10:49.720
Student:  That he wants
to announce before he offers his

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:55.895
neo-platonic vision of the
relationship of--that God had to

01:10:55.895 --> 01:10:57.279
creation.
 

01:10:57.279 --> 01:11:03.033
He wants to signal his
orthodoxy to doubters who might

01:11:03.033 --> 01:11:09.548
hear in this something which is
less than perfectly Christian

01:11:09.548 --> 01:11:16.171
because it comes close to the
idea of a needy God or a God who

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:21.710
in the way that every lover
needs something,

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:26.140
and other to love in return,
is in a predicament and

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:31.092
creation is the solution to the
predicament that God is in

01:11:31.092 --> 01:11:33.698
before the world was made.
 

01:11:33.698 --> 01:11:38.551
Prof: Okay,
the question is that--well,

01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:44.590
the question is more of a
comment by the maestro here.

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:49.667
The comment is that Dante at
the beginning of Canto XXIX

01:11:49.667 --> 01:11:53.359
seems to be on a theologically
risky,

01:11:53.359 --> 01:11:56.305
on thin ice,
I am quoting,

01:11:56.305 --> 01:12:00.430
because the notion of a God
who--

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:05.948
that Dante is really trying to
save his skin,

01:12:05.948 --> 01:12:11.434
as it were, by claiming a kind
of theological orthodoxy when he

01:12:11.434 --> 01:12:16.564
actually knows that the very
notion of creation whereby God

01:12:16.564 --> 01:12:21.939
opens up into new loves,
it seems to imply that before

01:12:21.939 --> 01:12:27.170
creation God was a lonely guy
looking for a partner,

01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:30.670
some kind of Adam,
Adam in the garden replaces all

01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:31.170
that.
 

01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:32.890
That's really the question.
 

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:36.403
I think that's a very
interesting idea,

01:12:36.403 --> 01:12:41.671
of course, but I have to--I
will respond not entirely in a

01:12:41.671 --> 01:12:46.479
funny way, but I hope it will
come out as funny.

01:12:46.479 --> 01:12:50.085
It's really the question that
St.

01:12:50.085 --> 01:12:54.930
Augustine asks in the
Confessions.

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:58.453
There are always those people
who wonder, because that's

01:12:58.453 --> 01:13:01.657
really what the question is,
what did God do before

01:13:01.657 --> 01:13:02.488
creation?
 

01:13:02.488 --> 01:13:02.782
St.
 

01:13:02.782 --> 01:13:07.462
Augustine responds:
he was busy preparing hell to

01:13:07.462 --> 01:13:12.144
people like you who ask these
kinds of questions,

01:13:12.144 --> 01:13:14.680
and think--that's it.
 

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:21.149
The more seriously idea is that
indeed creation implies,

01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:23.408
I mean that's a response that I
would offer,

01:13:23.408 --> 01:13:29.097
creation implies a beginning
but this creation has been going

01:13:29.097 --> 01:13:34.976
on forever and that the idea of
the Trinitarian God is really a

01:13:34.976 --> 01:13:38.578
response to this problem you
have.

01:13:38.578 --> 01:13:41.399
You obviously are,
I think, it's not obvious but

01:13:41.399 --> 01:13:43.939
you--
to me it's not obvious I think

01:13:43.939 --> 01:13:47.970
that you are appealing to a
different theological paradigm

01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:52.069
of where the unity of God can be
the loneliness of God.

01:13:52.069 --> 01:13:56.962
The Christian reading of that
unity is that there is always a

01:13:56.962 --> 01:14:01.447
productive, an internal life of
love that always goes on

01:14:01.447 --> 01:14:03.158
producing itself.
 

01:14:03.158 --> 01:14:06.844
On that note of theological
grandeur, I thank you and I say

01:14:06.844 --> 01:14:08.560
thank you, we'll see you.
 

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.329
Have a good Thanksgiving.

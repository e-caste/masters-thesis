00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.157
.
 

00:00:02.157 --> 00:00:05.702
Prof: I dropped a
bombshell end of last class

00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:09.118
telling you that all the
geometric optics I taught you

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:12.681
has to be revised,
and before letting you go for

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:16.450
lunch I said you've got to tell
me why I would do that.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.480
Student:
 Experiments.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.655
.
 

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:19.589
Prof:  Yes,
somebody said it's the

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.050
experiments, and that's what I
want you to remember.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.469
That's the only way things
change in physics is experiments

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.240
tell you something's wrong with
your theory,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.767
and in the end if your theory
doesn't agree with the

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:34.810
experiment it's over.
 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.490
And conversely,
if you're a newcomer unknown to

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.290
anybody, make predictions and
they agree with experiment then

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.130
you're a rock star.
 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.330
Everything is based on
experiment.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.990
That's the only way we change
our mind.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.899
Now you might say,
"Why do you keep doing

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:53.740
this to us?
 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.030
We believe you.
 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.410
We write everything down.
 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.100
We do the problems and then you
say, 'Oh, these guys are wrong.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.740
Here's a better theory,' what's
going on?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.760
Are people really wrong?"
 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.546
So I have to be very careful
when I say people are wrong

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:10.688
because the news leaks to the
press and the media will say,

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:13.530
"Physicists think they're
always wrong."

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.939
In fact, I've gone on record
here saying, "We're always

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:17.750
wrong."
 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.730
What I mean by that is no
matter how many laws we find one

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.293
day you will find some new
experiments which are not

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.250
explained by these laws.
 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.438
That's not really bad news.
 

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:31.766
That's what keeps us in
business because we want to find

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.550
something that doesn't fit
anything we know.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.849
For example,
Newtonian mechanics in some

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.974
sense is wrong because it
doesn't work when velocities

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:43.977
approach the speed of light,
but it's not wrong in the sense

00:01:43.977 --> 00:01:47.959
that the predictions it made in
its proper domain do not work

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:48.690
anymore.
 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.619
It was supposed to work in a
limited range of experimental

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.390
observations.
 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.163
If you push the limit,
if you build accelerators that

00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:58.203
send particles at very high
speeds you may find they don't

00:01:58.203 --> 00:01:59.750
obey Newtonian mechanics.
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.060
Then you get Einstein's special
theory.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.620
Now if you have a special
theory like Einstein,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.740
or a new theory that overthrows
the old theory,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.955
and it explains new phenomena,
there is still one extra

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:16.050
requirement.
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.699
Can you guess what that might
be with a new theory?

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.408
One thing we demand of every
new theory, yes?

00:02:25.408 --> 00:02:26.776
Student:
 That part of it

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:27.930
coincides with the old theory?
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.095
.
 

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:29.340
Prof:  Very good.
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.203
If you go back to the old
experiments, which are explained

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:36.253
by the old theory,
well your new theory should

00:02:36.253 --> 00:02:38.220
continue to explain that.
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.340
In fact the new theory,
when it's a good one,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.501
will tell you why for hundreds
of years people fell for the old

00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.318
theory and then it'll also do
new stuff.

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:50.782
If you do new stuff and it
doesn't fit the old stuff that's

00:02:50.782 --> 00:02:51.440
not good.
 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.960
So relativity is just like that.
 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.877
It works for all velocities up
to the speed of light,

00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:59.301
but if you let v/c go to
zero then you will finally get

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:00.930
back Newtonian mechanics.
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.968
Similarly, quantum mechanics
works for very,

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:06.479
very tiny objects,
the atomic scale,

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.705
but when you apply it to big
things you'll find that the

00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:11.639
world begins to look Newtonian.
 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.352
Similarly, the end of geometric
optics came from a series of

00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:19.147
experiments,
and I will tell you why we

00:03:19.147 --> 00:03:22.406
didn't realize there was
something wrong with it for a

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:22.960
while.
 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.188
So here's an experiment you
could do.

00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:30.544
Here a screen and there's some
light coming from here,

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:34.990
and there's a hole,
and behind this screen is

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.910
another screen.
 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.833
So I'm not good at drawing,
so you should imagine this is

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.913
coming out of the blackboard,
and the ray of light is coming

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:43.280
in.
 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.889
It'll form a shadow.
 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.860
I happen to have in mind a
circular hole here.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.530
It'll form a disc shape exactly
like that.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.015
And another thing,
but you will find that as you

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:03.688
shrink this, make it smaller and
smaller, suddenly that won't be

00:04:03.688 --> 00:04:04.949
true anymore.
 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.306
You will find that the light
spreads out like that to bigger

00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:10.710
and bigger areas.
 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.961
So it's no longer forming the
geometric image of this

00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:14.650
aperture.
 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.624
It's fanning out,
so it's not going to come from

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.399
geometrical optics.
 

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.870
That's one experiment where
something goes wrong.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.545
There's a more dramatic
experiment which really puts the

00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:32.627
nail on all kinds of ray
theories, and that's the

00:04:32.627 --> 00:04:35.860
experiment involving
interference.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.939
So you take a partition with
two holes in it,

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:50.230
and you send light from here,
and you put a screen behind.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.050
Are you guys with me?
 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.810
This is a cross section of a
plate coming out of the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.769
blackboard.
 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:58.000
It's got only two holes in it.
 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.050
Or here's a better way to think
about it.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.310
This is the top view of an
experiment.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.569
I'm looking down at my lab from
the top.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.163
There's a wall with two holes
in it, and there's the back

00:05:08.163 --> 00:05:10.860
wall, and the light is coming
from here.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.574
If I close this hole what we
will find typically--let me make

00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:17.050
them slightly bigger to make my
point.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.819
You'll find some light.
 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:21.769
I didn't draw it properly.
 

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:28.639
Most of the brightest areas
will be in front of this hole.

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.350
So let's see.
 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.009
It'll tend to be big here and
kind of fall off.

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:40.762
Now if you block the other one
and you shine light here you get

00:05:40.762 --> 00:05:43.160
something like that.
 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.410
It's like two windows in the
room.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.860
You've got one window,
you get some sunlight.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.920
You've got another one you get
another sunlight.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.132
Now the question is if you open
both of them our expectation is

00:05:52.132 --> 00:05:54.920
that there is some energy coming
here,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.336
some energy coming here,
and if you open both you should

00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:03.055
get the sum of the two energies,
which I'm assuming this is the

00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:06.278
sum of these two graphs plotted
here.

00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:07.870
By the way, do you know how I'm
plotting this?

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.990
I hope you understand that this
graph really means that distance

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.730
is proportional to how bright
this point is.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.312
See, normally you're used to
drawing graphs like this as a

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:22.677
function of distance,
but I've turned it around so

00:06:22.677 --> 00:06:27.476
that that is the graph of the
brightness at different points

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:28.860
on the screen.
 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.139
That's what you expect.
 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.636
You open two windows you get
the light equal to the sum of

00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:34.250
the two.
 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.392
For example,
if you're feeling warm it'll be

00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:41.632
warmer in this region because
you're getting light from two

00:06:41.632 --> 00:06:42.509
sources.
 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.559
But this experiment also gives
you different results under

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:49.420
certain conditions.
 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.920
I'll tell you what the
conditions are.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.319
What you find then if one slid
open it looks like that.

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.502
If the other slid open it looks
like that, but with both open it

00:07:02.502 --> 00:07:04.269
looks like this.
 

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:06.939
That's called interference.
 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:12.680
The main point to notice is
there are some places,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.952
like right here,
where you get less light with

00:07:17.952 --> 00:07:21.350
one more slid open,
okay?

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.310
And more light with only one
open, less light with two open.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.339
In fact, you can arrange it so
this is really zero.

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:32.990
I mean, it can come all the way
down here.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.367
In other words that's the point
on the screen which used to be

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:37.920
bright with one slit open.
 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.180
You open the second one that
point becomes dark.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.959
That means if you're warm
there, and you tell somebody,

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:46.810
"Hey, this is good,
open another window,"

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.350
suddenly you get nothing.
 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.440
That happens.
 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.225
So when did people realize this
is what happens,

00:07:55.225 --> 00:08:01.639
and why did people fall for the
other graph that looks like this

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.759
before?
 

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.550
The answer is this.
 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.512
In order to see this phenomenon
in which it instead of being a

00:08:09.512 --> 00:08:12.930
shadow like this you get a huge
spread,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.500
or instead of being simply the
sum of these two featureless

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.672
graphs it starts oscillating,
and a certain condition has to

00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:21.699
be satisfied.
 

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:24.730
The condition is the following.
 

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.050
This light, if it has a
wavelength λ,

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:35.409
the λ, if it is much,
much smaller than any distance

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:42.019
in the problem then you get
geometrical optics.

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:46.589
So in this example if this slit
is thousand times the wavelength

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:50.303
of light then the shadow,
in fact, will be geometrical,

00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:53.321
but as you make the slit
smaller and smaller until it

00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:56.513
becomes comparable to the
wavelength then you'll find it

00:08:56.513 --> 00:08:57.788
begin to fan out.
 

00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:01.721
Similarly here,
if this distance between the

00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:04.528
two slits,
d, is much,

00:09:04.528 --> 00:09:09.570
much bigger than the wavelength
and each slit is much,

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.142
much bigger than the
wavelength, then you will find

00:09:13.142 --> 00:09:17.000
that you don't see any of this
interference effects.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.662
Because what happens is
interference effects are always

00:09:20.662 --> 00:09:24.190
there, but they oscillate like
mad on that screen.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:29.931
Suppose it oscillates like
this, and this could be 10,000

00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:34.716
oscillations per centimeter,
and your eye is able to look at

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:36.529
it only one millimeter at a
time,

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:40.009
then you're averaging over a
region and you only find the

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:41.500
average of this graph.
 

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.710
That looks like what you got
without interference.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.950
So in order to see interference
you need to make your apparatus

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.644
probe the physics at a distance
scale comparable to the

00:09:53.644 --> 00:09:54.669
wavelength.
 

00:09:54.669 --> 00:09:55.740
So that's the answer.
 

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.274
We will see all the details,
but it'll turnout that if you

00:09:59.274 --> 00:10:01.570
look at light using any
equipment,

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.548
maybe hole in the wall,
two holes in the wall,

00:10:03.548 --> 00:10:07.221
whatever, whose dimensions are
much bigger than the wavelength

00:10:07.221 --> 00:10:09.870
you will not see the wave theory
of light.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.158
You'll be able to get away with
the geometric theory.

00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:18.145
But once you probe light at
length comparable to wavelength

00:10:18.145 --> 00:10:20.690
all these funny things will
happen.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.017
That's why people didn't
realize all these things about

00:10:24.017 --> 00:10:24.509
light.
 

00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:27.240
For example,
the wavelength of light,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.746
typical light,
is 5,000 angstroms,

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:36.778
or 500 nanometers,
that is 500�10^(-9),

00:10:36.778 --> 00:10:40.750
or 5�10^(-7) meters.
 

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:45.410
That means if you forget the 5
there are 10 million

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.418
oscillations of the wave within
1 meter,

00:10:49.418 --> 00:10:52.928
so if you have an instrument
that can pick up that kind of

00:10:52.928 --> 00:10:56.070
fine features then you will see
the wave nature,

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.110
but normally you won't.
 

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.878
So it's only when people probed
light with very,

00:11:00.878 --> 00:11:04.528
very tiny holes placed very
close to each other they saw it.

00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:07.769
The second important thing to
remember is the following.

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:13.666
Even if you made the holes very
small, and if you shine white

00:11:13.666 --> 00:11:17.892
light on this,
you will not see any of these

00:11:17.892 --> 00:11:19.169
patterns.
 

00:11:19.169 --> 00:11:20.789
Why is that?
 

00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:21.528
Can you guess?
 

00:11:21.528 --> 00:11:24.778
I'm going to tell you
everything, but can you guess

00:11:24.778 --> 00:11:25.169
why?
 

00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:26.620
Yes?
 

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.840
You have a guess?
 

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.363
Student:
 Because they're white

00:11:29.363 --> 00:11:29.639
light.
 

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:29.811
.
 

00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:31.230
Prof:  That's
right.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.048
White light is made of many
colors and many wavelengths,

00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:37.279
so each wavelength will form
its own pattern,

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.985
but the maximum and minimum of
one guy won't coincide with that

00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:40.639
of the other.
 

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:44.077
So where this one wants a
maximum that'll want a minimum,

00:11:44.077 --> 00:11:45.490
it'll get washed out.
 

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.280
So in order to see this effect
you need monochromatic light

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.484
sent by a source which is
sending it at a definite

00:11:52.484 --> 00:11:54.379
frequency and wavelength.
 

00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:58.458
And these are all things you
have to get right before you

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:00.278
will see these effects.
 

00:12:00.278 --> 00:12:06.605
Okay, so now let's ask
ourselves, what is the nature of

00:12:06.605 --> 00:12:13.754
waves or what is the nature of
light that produces these funny

00:12:13.754 --> 00:12:15.158
effects?
 

00:12:15.158 --> 00:12:19.460
Light, as you know,
obeys a wave equation.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.525
Let me call ψ
as whatever it is that's doing

00:12:23.525 --> 00:12:27.158
the oscillations,
generic name is ψ.

00:12:27.158 --> 00:12:32.033
For example,
ψ can be the height of this

00:12:32.033 --> 00:12:34.980
string that's vibrating.
 

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.423
If the string is doing this
from equilibrium ψ

00:12:39.423 --> 00:12:42.690
is the deviation from
equilibrium.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:50.105
ψ can be E or
B in the electromagnetic

00:12:50.105 --> 00:12:51.048
case.
 

00:12:51.048 --> 00:12:57.148
ψ can be the height of
water in a lake above some

00:12:57.148 --> 00:12:59.259
reference level.
 

00:12:59.259 --> 00:13:02.888
That's the reference level,
and the water does some

00:13:02.888 --> 00:13:06.081
oscillations,
ψ is the deviation from the

00:13:06.081 --> 00:13:06.879
normal.
 

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:10.582
In the case of a sound wave,
as you know sound wave is

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:12.610
deviations in air pressure.
 

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.139
Again, this graph would stand
for the normal air pressure,

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:18.304
ambient air pressure,
and when you talk you make some

00:13:18.304 --> 00:13:21.350
oscillations in the density or
in the pressure,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.220
and there's the deviation in
pressure.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.668
So I'm going to call ψ
as any one of these things.

00:13:26.668 --> 00:13:30.210
It's something that's
oscillating in the wave.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.210
And all these ψ's obey the
wave equation.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:41.450
The wave equation looks like
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2) minus 1

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:48.178
over the velocity
d^(2)ψ/dt^(2) = 0.

00:13:48.178 --> 00:13:50.779
The context is different but
the equation's the same.

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:53.269
The velocity will vary from
problem to problem.

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:55.519
So I'm going to give a short
name for this.

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:58.509
I'm going to all it box ψ
= 0.

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:00.220
Turns out it's not a crazy
notation.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.889
A lot of people actually use
that.

00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:06.058
Do you know why they draw the
box?

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:08.942
This is for people who have
done somewhat more advanced

00:14:08.942 --> 00:14:09.690
mathematics.
 

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.543
There's something called del
squared which stands for the

00:14:12.543 --> 00:14:14.379
three spatial derivatives
squared.

00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:18.750
This has got the fourth one so
you use the box.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.070
Anyway, it just means I'm tired
of writing this.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.309
This stands exactly for this.
 

00:14:24.309 --> 00:14:26.470
That's the main point.
 

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.245
Now when the wave obeys the
wave equation there's a very,

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.000
very important property.
 

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.678
The important property is it's
a linear equation.

00:14:37.678 --> 00:14:41.702
It's a linear equation which
means if you multiply ψ

00:14:41.702 --> 00:14:45.360
by a number it also satisfies
the wave equation.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.173
Because if I multiply by number
3 I can take the 3 inside all

00:14:50.173 --> 00:14:53.384
the derivatives,
and I find 3 times ψ

00:14:53.384 --> 00:14:55.230
is also a solution.
 

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.806
Another important property is
that if someone gives you a

00:14:59.806 --> 00:15:02.830
solution called
ψ_1,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.477
another person gives you
another solution to the wave

00:15:05.477 --> 00:15:08.227
equation which is some other
function of x and t called

00:15:08.227 --> 00:15:11.320
ψ_2,
then you can check that if you

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.009
take any number times
ψ_1,

00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:16.110
and any number times
ψ_2,

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.778
and add this,
you will find box of

00:15:19.778 --> 00:15:25.340
aψ_1
bψ_2 is also 0.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.879
You understand why?
 

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:29.750
When the derivatives come it
doesn't care about a.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.538
It's a constant.
 

00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:32.418
Box of ψ_1 will
vanish and the box of

00:15:32.418 --> 00:15:33.620
ψ_2 will vanish.
 

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.759
The whole thing will vanish.
 

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:38.038
But the important property is
you can take two solutions,

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:39.529
ψ_1 and
ψ_2,

00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:41.470
multiply each one a number you
like,

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:47.620
a constant, and add them,
that's also a solution.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.342
That's the principle of
superposition,

00:15:50.342 --> 00:15:54.317
and its origin is in the fact
that the underlying ψ

00:15:54.317 --> 00:15:56.379
obeys a linear equation.
 

00:15:56.379 --> 00:15:57.980
It's very important that it's
linear.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.017
I've told you many times if you
have something like that plus

00:16:01.017 --> 00:16:03.952
ψ^(2) = 0 you can verify
that if ψ_1 is a

00:16:03.952 --> 00:16:06.940
solution and ψ_2
is a solution if you add them

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.610
you will get
ψ_1^(2)

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.298
ψ_2^(2),
but that is not the same as

00:16:11.298 --> 00:16:13.830
ψ_1 ψ_2
the whole thing squared.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.110
So for nonlinear equations you
cannot add the solutions.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:22.278
These are linear because they
involve the first part of ψ.

00:16:22.278 --> 00:16:28.181
Okay, now what that means is
first of all ψ

00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:32.028
can be positive or negative.
 

00:16:32.028 --> 00:16:34.476
What if someone tried to prove
to you that ψ

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:35.570
is always positive?
 

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.799
How will you shoot that person
down?

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.740
Do you know?
 

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.428
Yes?
 

00:16:41.428 --> 00:16:42.203
Student:
 Well,

00:16:42.203 --> 00:16:43.090
if the constant is negative 1.
 

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:43.200
.
 

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.000
Prof: Very good.
 

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.485
If the constant is negative 1
then minus ψ

00:16:46.485 --> 00:16:49.523
is also a solution so no one
can ever convince you ψ

00:16:49.523 --> 00:16:51.178
should always be positive.
 

00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:53.690
Well, if ψ
can be positive and negative,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.908
which means generally it can go
up and down in sign,

00:16:56.908 --> 00:17:00.644
it cannot stand for things
which are always positive such

00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:02.580
as the brightness of light.
 

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.910
The brightness of light is
always positive.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.660
The worst think you can have is
no light.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.720
You cannot have negative
brightness.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.412
Therefore, in the electric
field the brightness is not

00:17:13.412 --> 00:17:16.623
measured by the electric field,
the one that oscillates,

00:17:16.623 --> 00:17:19.220
but by something quadratic in
the field,

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.028
and that's called the intensity.
 

00:17:21.028 --> 00:17:25.246
The intensity is proportional
to square of whatever is

00:17:25.246 --> 00:17:26.358
oscillating.
 

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:30.781
It is the measure of energy
contained in the wave or

00:17:30.781 --> 00:17:31.910
brightness.
 

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.175
Intensity being positive
definite has some chance of

00:17:35.175 --> 00:17:39.019
being a description of something
that's positive definite.

00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:44.417
Not only does it have a chance
that happens to be the case,

00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:45.068
okay?
 

00:17:45.068 --> 00:17:48.811
See, in all these problems it's
the square of the function that

00:17:48.811 --> 00:17:51.890
stands for something like
brightness, something like

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.519
energy per unit second.
 

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:55.890
They're all given by the square.
 

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.938
So the important thing to
notice is that when you have one

00:17:59.938 --> 00:18:03.347
source producing some light,
and a second source producing

00:18:03.347 --> 00:18:05.829
some light,
and you turn them both on,

00:18:05.829 --> 00:18:09.934
together they'll produce a
field which is the sum of the

00:18:09.934 --> 00:18:10.980
two fields.
 

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.915
What you can add is the ψ,
which in this case happens to

00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:15.210
be E or B.
 

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.960
You cannot add the intensities.
 

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.910
No one told you the intensities
are additive.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.546
The correct process is if
ψ_1 has an

00:18:24.546 --> 00:18:27.836
intensity I_1,
let me call it

00:18:27.836 --> 00:18:30.903
ψ_1^(2),
and ψ_2 has an

00:18:30.903 --> 00:18:33.281
intensity I_2
which is

00:18:33.281 --> 00:18:37.193
ψ_2^(2),
then if you put the two waves

00:18:37.193 --> 00:18:41.288
together by producing them due
to the two sources,

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:45.357
I_1 2 is
(ψ_1 

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:47.670
ψ_2)^(2).
 

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.436
That, you see,
has got a ψ_1^(2)

00:18:51.436 --> 00:18:56.124
and a ψ_2^(2)
2ψ_1ψ_2

00:18:56.124 --> 00:19:01.063
which is I_1
I_2  something

00:19:01.063 --> 00:19:03.910
which is indefinite in sign.
 

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:04.779
This can be positive.
 

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:05.490
This can be negative.
 

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.140
This can be 0.
 

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.057
So I_1 2 is
not equal to I_1 

00:19:11.057 --> 00:19:12.410
I_2.
 

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:18.194
It's got the extra stuff,
and that's going to be the

00:19:18.194 --> 00:19:22.618
origin of all the things we see
here.

00:19:22.618 --> 00:19:25.578
So it turns out for waves
there's two levels as which

00:19:25.578 --> 00:19:26.490
things happen.
 

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.171
There's a thing that actually
oscillates and then you have to

00:19:30.171 --> 00:19:33.974
square it to get things that you
normally associate with energy

00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:35.078
or brightness.
 

00:19:35.078 --> 00:19:39.267
And the additive law applies to
the things that oscillates and

00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:40.640
not to its square.
 

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.355
This is the reason why if
you've got two sources each one

00:19:44.355 --> 00:19:48.269
of it produces a positive
intensity I_1.

00:19:48.269 --> 00:19:50.851
When you turn them both on the
answer is not I_1 

00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:53.118
I_2,
but this cross term,

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:57.190
and the cross term can come and
neutralize these and make it

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.880
vanish.
 

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:03.295
That's why the experiment when
you open a second hole some

00:20:03.295 --> 00:20:07.190
places can become darker than
they are.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.548
Now later on,
I mean, not later on,

00:20:10.548 --> 00:20:16.182
later this week when we start
quantum mechanics we'll deal

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:18.058
with the ψ.
 

00:20:18.058 --> 00:20:24.348
That's called the wave function
in quantum mechanics.

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:26.160
Now that's a very bizarre
object.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.970
I don't want to even talk about
it now.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.951
Let me just say that it's
something which is intrinsically

00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:33.650
complex.
 

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.721
See, normally for
electromagnetic waves or

00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:39.941
harmonic oscillator if you've
got x =

00:20:39.941 --> 00:20:44.211
Acosωt we're
used to taking x =

00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:49.078
Ae^(iωt) then
taking the real part at the end.

00:20:49.078 --> 00:20:50.818
That everyone knows x is
real.

00:20:50.818 --> 00:20:53.632
You bring the complex
exponential because it makes it

00:20:53.632 --> 00:20:55.578
easier to solve certain
equations.

00:20:55.578 --> 00:20:59.420
But in quantum mechanics all of
ψ, real part and imaginary

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.119
part together are needed.
 

00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:04.848
It is, by nature, complex.
 

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:07.111
In fact the equations of
quantum mechanism,

00:21:07.111 --> 00:21:09.963
the analog of Newton's Laws,
or the analog of the wave

00:21:09.963 --> 00:21:12.278
equation will have an i
in them.

00:21:12.278 --> 00:21:15.544
There's an i in the
equation for ψ,

00:21:15.544 --> 00:21:17.720
so you cannot get rid of it.
 

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.560
So in those cases what you want
to think about the analog of

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.058
intensity cannot be ψ^(2),
because ψ^(2),

00:21:26.058 --> 00:21:29.657
if you really mean by ψ^(2)
the real part of ψ

00:21:29.657 --> 00:21:32.442
i times the imaginary
part of ψ

00:21:32.442 --> 00:21:35.558
whole thing squared,
you see that is

00:21:35.558 --> 00:21:40.762
ψ_real^(2) -
ψ_imaginary^(2)

00:21:40.762 --> 00:21:44.452
2iψ_real
ψ_

00:21:44.452 --> 00:21:46.440
imaginary.
 

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.259
What's wrong with this?
 

00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:51.483
If you want this to stand for
something positive definite this

00:21:51.483 --> 00:21:52.700
is definitely not it.
 

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.108
Can you see that?
 

00:21:54.108 --> 00:21:58.654
In the simple case where ψ
is purely imaginary you see

00:21:58.654 --> 00:22:01.443
it's negative,
but neither positive,

00:22:01.443 --> 00:22:02.880
not even real.
 

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.730
So you must know what I should
do in the case where ψ

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.579
is intrinsically complex to
define something positive.

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:15.140
Any guess on what it is?
 

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.180
Yes?
 

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.740
Student:
 Take the ________.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:17.851
.
 

00:22:17.851 --> 00:22:19.519
Prof:  Could take
the absolute value of ψ,

00:22:19.519 --> 00:22:25.710
or another way to say that is
you want to take ψ*ψ.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.692
But anyway, I'm doing some of
this today because I want you to

00:22:29.692 --> 00:22:32.109
be on top of this before
Wednesday.

00:22:32.109 --> 00:22:33.660
I've given you enough warning.
 

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.318
I ruined your spring break by
sending you notes on complex

00:22:37.318 --> 00:22:39.308
numbers so you can read them.
 

00:22:39.308 --> 00:22:41.707
If you know it already it's
fine, but you should be able to

00:22:41.707 --> 00:22:43.318
understand the meaning of real
part,

00:22:43.318 --> 00:22:45.598
imaginary part,
absolute value squared,

00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:47.420
things like
E_Iθ,

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:47.960
okay?
 

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.420
That's going to be used a lot.
 

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.204
By anyway, if I take
ψ*ψ that becomes

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:56.003
ψ_real i
times ψ_imaginary

00:22:56.003 --> 00:22:58.663
times ψ_real -
i times

00:22:58.663 --> 00:23:00.690
ψ_imaginary.
 

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.828
And if you do the whole thing
you will find it's

00:23:02.828 --> 00:23:05.470
ψ_real^(2 )
ψ_imaginary^(2).

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:10.480
That's, of course,
never negative.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.412
So when you do complex waves
they will also obey the

00:23:13.412 --> 00:23:15.538
superposition principle for
ψ,

00:23:15.538 --> 00:23:18.420
but the analog of intensity,
which is the positive definite

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.180
number you extract from ψ,
will be that.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.548
You can also write this as
absolute value ψ^(2).

00:23:25.548 --> 00:23:27.818
When you do complex don't
forget absolute value.

00:23:27.818 --> 00:23:29.878
When you do real either you can
square the ψ

00:23:29.878 --> 00:23:31.500
or you can take the absolute
value.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.328
It doesn't make any difference.
 

00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:37.486
For the real function the
simple squared and the absolute

00:23:37.486 --> 00:23:40.009
value squared are both the same.
 

00:23:40.009 --> 00:23:45.086
All right, so now I'm going to
start with trying to understand

00:23:45.086 --> 00:23:49.000
interference of waves by doing
the following.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.558
Usually you get interference
when two people are sending you

00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:54.410
a signal.
 

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.595
One person is sending you a
signal ψ_1 and the

00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:01.150
signal may be traveling in
space,

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.772
but I want you to sit at once
place and just register what's

00:24:04.772 --> 00:24:06.368
coming to where you are.
 

00:24:06.368 --> 00:24:08.348
For example,
you could be in one part of a

00:24:08.348 --> 00:24:11.102
lake and someone is rocking the
boat there and sending out

00:24:11.102 --> 00:24:13.257
ripples,
the ripples come to where you

00:24:13.257 --> 00:24:15.098
are, and let's say it's
periodic,

00:24:15.098 --> 00:24:19.758
and at the location where you
are let it be of the form

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:22.259
Acosωt.
 

00:24:22.259 --> 00:24:25.196
So A is the amplitude
and ω is the angular

00:24:25.196 --> 00:24:25.848
frequency.
 

00:24:25.848 --> 00:24:28.682
If you like,
it's 2Π times f where

00:24:28.682 --> 00:24:30.990
f is the normal
frequency.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.180
Then another wave is coming
towards you.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.655
It is
Acosωt,

00:24:38.655 --> 00:24:43.220
but it comes at a different
phase Φ.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.022
Now the phase Φ,
if you've got only a single

00:24:46.022 --> 00:24:48.170
wave you can choose Φ
to be 0.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.625
Because Φ
is--what does Φ

00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:51.009
do?
 

00:24:51.009 --> 00:24:55.019
cosωt likes to
have a maximum of t = 0,

00:24:55.019 --> 00:24:57.351
cos(ωt
Φ) has a

00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:58.750
maximum somewhat earlier.
 

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.161
You can always reset your clock
so that whenever it hits a

00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:05.871
maximum you press your clock and
set it to 0 you can get rid of

00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:06.470
Φ.
 

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.130
But you cannot get rid of Φ
from two wave functions.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.516
You cannot choose them both to
have their maximum at the same

00:25:13.516 --> 00:25:14.588
time because they're not.
 

00:25:14.588 --> 00:25:19.288
In fact this fellow goes like
this.

00:25:19.288 --> 00:25:24.321
This one has got an extra lead
on it, so it'll sort of start

00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:24.920
here.
 

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.338
So it'll go like this.
 

00:25:28.338 --> 00:25:32.255
If you went backward it'll have
its maximum at some negative

00:25:32.255 --> 00:25:32.720
time.
 

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.423
So what we want to do is to add
these two signals to get

00:25:36.423 --> 00:25:39.049
ψ_1 
ψ_2.

00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:40.220
Think of this as water waves.
 

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.608
That's the best example.
 

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:46.059
Okay, someone shaking the
water, ripples are coming out.

00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:47.720
They're coming to where you are.
 

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.700
With only the first vibrator
sending the waves you get this.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.930
With the second one you get
this.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.548
But now if both are doing it
then this is what you will get.

00:25:55.548 --> 00:26:00.923
And the height of the water
will actually be simply the sum

00:26:00.923 --> 00:26:02.869
of the two heights.
 

00:26:02.869 --> 00:26:04.788
It's not obvious but true, okay?
 

00:26:04.788 --> 00:26:08.178
If you agitate the water with
one source and it produces the

00:26:08.178 --> 00:26:10.019
height here,
and with the second one that

00:26:10.019 --> 00:26:12.182
produces another height,
if you do both it's not

00:26:12.182 --> 00:26:14.358
obvious, it's not a logical
necessity,

00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:18.531
but it's a fact that the height
of the water at any point will

00:26:18.531 --> 00:26:20.789
simply be the sum of these two.
 

00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:22.890
So you've got to add these guys.
 

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:28.226
So you do that you get
Acosωt

00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:34.007
Acos(ωt
Φ). Now

00:26:34.007 --> 00:26:40.788
you've got to go back to your
trig identities and remember the

00:26:40.788 --> 00:26:45.011
following: cosine α
cosine β

00:26:45.011 --> 00:26:50.460
is twice cosine α
β over 2 times cosine

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.240
α - β
over 2.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.912
If you've got a formula like
this, of which there are

00:26:56.912 --> 00:26:59.173
numerous ones,
and if you have any doubts you

00:26:59.173 --> 00:27:00.868
can check some special cases.
 

00:27:00.868 --> 00:27:03.720
For example,
if α is equal to β

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.335
I want to get cos α
cos α or twice cosine

00:27:07.335 --> 00:27:08.170
α.
 

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.651
On the right hand side I get
twice cosine α

00:27:11.651 --> 00:27:14.405
α over 2,
which is cosine α

00:27:14.405 --> 00:27:16.798
times cosine of 0 which is 1.
 

00:27:16.798 --> 00:27:19.632
Now it doesn't prove it's the
right formula,

00:27:19.632 --> 00:27:23.583
but it will tell you that if it
is wrong in some way then you

00:27:23.583 --> 00:27:24.440
can tell.
 

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.500
Anyway, this is the right
formula applied to this problem.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:34.625
If I apply it to this problem,
I get twice cosine ψ

00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:40.346
over 2,
I'm sorry, 2A cosine

00:27:40.346 --> 00:27:50.200
ψ over 2 times cosine
ωt Φ/2.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.990
This is just plugging in.
 

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:57.598
It is an example.
 

00:27:57.598 --> 00:28:02.833
This whole thing looks like a
pre-factor, doesn't depend on

00:28:02.833 --> 00:28:05.630
time and this is oscillating.
 

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:11.671
So this is a problem which
looks like some amplitude cosine

00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:13.650
ωt Φ/2.
 

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:19.390
The amplitude Ã
is 2A cosine Φ/2.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:24.058
And if I want the amplitude to
be always positive I will take

00:28:24.058 --> 00:28:27.950
it to mean the absolute value of
cosine Φ/2.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.608
So here's the answer, guys.
 

00:28:29.608 --> 00:28:32.288
When you add these two
waves--if you draw the pictures

00:28:32.288 --> 00:28:35.118
it's kind of confusing,
but this is the simple answer.

00:28:35.118 --> 00:28:39.884
It says the total will be a new
wave whose amplitude is

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.118
Ã.
 

00:28:41.118 --> 00:28:45.605
Ã can be as big as
2A, or it can be as small

00:28:45.605 --> 00:28:48.618
as 0 depending on what the
cosine does.

00:28:48.618 --> 00:28:51.173
And then it will also not be in
step with this guy,

00:28:51.173 --> 00:28:54.240
not in step with this guy,
it'll be half way between them.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.990
Its phase will be Φ/2.
 

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.618
Now let's check the formula in
a couple of special cases.

00:29:02.618 --> 00:29:06.730
If Φ is equal to 0 that
means the two signals are

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:07.680
identical.
 

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.592
We don't need any fancy stuff
to know the answer is

00:29:10.592 --> 00:29:12.338
2Acosωt.
 

00:29:12.338 --> 00:29:14.892
If Φ is equal to 0,
that's

00:29:14.892 --> 00:29:19.557
Acosωt,
cos 0 is 1 and you get the

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:20.788
2A.
 

00:29:20.788 --> 00:29:24.662
The one other case you can do
very easily in your head is when

00:29:24.662 --> 00:29:26.250
Φ is equal to Π.
 

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:30.858
If Φ is equal to Π
cosine of ωt  Π

00:29:30.858 --> 00:29:34.068
is just minus cosine
ωt.

00:29:34.068 --> 00:29:38.058
That means this wave starts
like this.

00:29:38.058 --> 00:29:40.941
Wherever this is going up this
is going, I'm sorry,

00:29:40.941 --> 00:29:42.440
it starts like this one.
 

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.106
So when that one is doing this,
this will do that and it'll

00:29:45.106 --> 00:29:46.348
always be opposite to it.
 

00:29:46.348 --> 00:29:49.848
If you add them you'll get
identically 0.

00:29:49.848 --> 00:29:54.077
Anyway, they are the two
extreme cases where you can

00:29:54.077 --> 00:29:55.818
check your formula.
 

00:29:55.818 --> 00:29:58.755
So this is the only formula you
will need, so you should get

00:29:58.755 --> 00:29:59.848
that into your head.
 

00:29:59.848 --> 00:30:02.702
There is some natural frequency
ω and the phase is

00:30:02.702 --> 00:30:05.660
increasing at the rate ω
so it's ωt.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.210
The other guy has shifted by
phase Φ.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:12.950
Their sum has a new amplitude
and a new phase.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.261
I'm doing a special case where
the two waves have the same

00:30:16.261 --> 00:30:16.960
amplitude.
 

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:23.220
If they're different amplitudes
it becomes more messy,

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.410
but that's not necessary.
 

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:30.901
So I'm going to do this once
more, but with complex numbers,

00:30:30.901 --> 00:30:35.240
because I want you guys to get
used to complex numbers.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.063
And I think the only way you're
going to get used to anything is

00:30:38.063 --> 00:30:39.048
if you use it a lot.
 

00:30:39.048 --> 00:30:41.890
You can sit down and read it at
bedtime.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.009
It may help you go to sleep,
but it doesn't do any good.

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:47.912
So I'm going to keep using the
complex numbers,

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:51.382
because starting Wednesday
we're going to be doing a lot

00:30:51.382 --> 00:30:51.950
more.
 

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.828
But you don't need very fancy
complex numbers.

00:30:53.828 --> 00:30:56.259
It's at the level that I'm
doing now.

00:30:56.259 --> 00:31:03.118
So let us now do exactly this
addition using complex numbers.

00:31:03.118 --> 00:31:07.211
So let's take one single wave
first, ψ_1 =

00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:09.368
Acosωt.
 

00:31:09.368 --> 00:31:16.452
We agree there's no complex
number here, but let's write it

00:31:16.452 --> 00:31:21.950
as the real part
Re(Ae^(iωt)).

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:26.857
Now you remember the complex
number is z = mod

00:31:26.857 --> 00:31:30.538
ze^(iθ) looks like
this.

00:31:30.538 --> 00:31:34.442
It's got a length equal to mod
z and there's an angle

00:31:34.442 --> 00:31:35.700
equal to θ.
 

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.108
That's the complex number
z.

00:31:37.108 --> 00:31:40.058
If you want you can think of it
as that.

00:31:40.058 --> 00:31:45.509
It starts at the origin and
terminates at the point

00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:46.710
z.
 

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:52.852
Its real part is really this
one, this mod z cosine

00:31:52.852 --> 00:31:53.930
θ.
 

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.932
The imaginary part is mod
z sine θ,

00:31:55.932 --> 00:31:57.170
but I just want the cosine.
 

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.069
It's the real part of this guy.
 

00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:00.970
So what does this look like?
 

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.380
Well, let me draw you a picture
here.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.640
This looks like this.
 

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.001
It's got length A and
the angle is ωt,

00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:14.328
and as time goes by it goes
round and round.

00:32:14.328 --> 00:32:21.519
So at any future time it'll be
on this circle.

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:25.596
At this instant its real part
is just this one,

00:32:25.596 --> 00:32:28.608
A cosine
ωt.

00:32:28.608 --> 00:32:31.778
So if you like,
the complex number has fixed

00:32:31.778 --> 00:32:35.170
magnitude, goes round and round
in a circle.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.230
The real part of it has got a
maximum of A here,

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:43.420
a 0 there, and -A,
and that'll be the cosine,

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.270
because the horizontal part of
this is A cosine

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.240
ωt.
 

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.852
So we can keep track of the
thing we're interested in by

00:32:50.852 --> 00:32:54.990
letting this vector rotate in a
circle by looking at a shadow on

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.828
the x-axis,
okay?

00:32:56.828 --> 00:32:58.593
If you have some light shining
from here you ask,

00:32:58.593 --> 00:32:59.990
"What image does it
cast?"

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.259
Well, it comes there.
 

00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:07.718
So for a single complex number
it's not very useful,

00:33:07.718 --> 00:33:11.108
but now let me bring in a
second complex number.

00:33:11.108 --> 00:33:17.166
Let's bring in a second complex
number, so I'll draw a new

00:33:17.166 --> 00:33:20.250
figure for the two of them.
 

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.750
So you should understand this
is a dynamic situation.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.759
This is not a fixed vector.
 

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:29.250
As t increases this is
constantly rotating,

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:29.750
okay?
 

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.832
And as it rotates if you follow
the shadow on the x-axis

00:33:32.832 --> 00:33:35.170
you get the real part,
which is our function.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:39.542
Now if you've got a second
function, so let me take a

00:33:39.542 --> 00:33:44.252
circle of radius A,
and here's the first guy who's

00:33:44.252 --> 00:33:46.440
angle ωt.
 

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.547
The second one is also on that
circle, but you've got an extra

00:33:51.547 --> 00:33:52.720
angle Φ.
 

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.338
You follow that?
 

00:33:54.338 --> 00:33:57.640
So this ψ_1 this
is ψ_2,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.295
actual ψ
is actually the real part of

00:33:59.295 --> 00:34:01.903
these two guys,
but I'm going to work with the

00:34:01.903 --> 00:34:03.269
complex number first.
 

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:06.970
We all remember in the end to
take the real part.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:10.027
And I'm using the fact that the
real part of ψ_1

00:34:10.027 --> 00:34:12.934
ψ_2 is the real
part of ψ_1 the

00:34:12.934 --> 00:34:14.690
real part of ψ_2.
 

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.425
Therefore if you want to add
two real waves you can add the

00:34:17.425 --> 00:34:19.500
complex waves and then take the
real part.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.539
You can take it before or you
can take it after.

00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:25.262
Our philosophy is going to be
to add the vectors first then

00:34:25.262 --> 00:34:26.610
take the real part.
 

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:30.663
I want you to think about,
what is the sum of these two

00:34:30.663 --> 00:34:32.090
guys going to do?
 

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:37.489
As usual I'll give you a few
seconds to think about it,

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:38.190
okay?
 

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:43.730
By vector addition you do this
parallelogram.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:48.215
You draw one copy of this here
and one copy of that here,

00:34:48.215 --> 00:34:50.460
and you join this to that.
 

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:56.019
That line is ψ_1
ψ_2,

00:34:56.019 --> 00:35:02.739
so their sum would rotate on
that circle, but let's look at

00:35:02.739 --> 00:35:04.130
the sum.
 

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.469
What's this angle here?
 

00:35:07.469 --> 00:35:11.581
You can tell from the
similarity of this parallelogram

00:35:11.581 --> 00:35:15.052
that that angle is Φ/2,
because the angle Φ

00:35:15.052 --> 00:35:17.784
between them is split evenly
between the diagonal of the

00:35:17.784 --> 00:35:18.630
parallelogram.
 

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:22.952
So you already tell that the
new wave, which is obtained by

00:35:22.952 --> 00:35:26.231
adding these two,
when this guy rotates we'll

00:35:26.231 --> 00:35:28.320
have a phase of Φ/2.
 

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.690
And what's its amplitude?
 

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.063
That we're asking,
what's the length of the

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:33.929
diagonal of this parallelogram?
 

00:35:33.929 --> 00:35:38.355
Then you use whatever theorem,
and to say Ã^(2)

00:35:38.355 --> 00:35:42.951
is the square of one guy,
square of the other guy 2 times

00:35:42.951 --> 00:35:47.523
length of A length of
A cosine of the angle

00:35:47.523 --> 00:35:48.829
between them.
 

00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:54.030
I mean, cosine of this angle,
Φ.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:36:01.268
So this becomes 2A
squared times 1 cosine Φ.

00:36:01.268 --> 00:36:07.257
Now I remind you of another
trigonometry identity that 1

00:36:07.257 --> 00:36:12.809
cosine Φ is 2 times cosine
squared θ/2.

00:36:12.809 --> 00:36:14.969
That is Ã^(2).
 

00:36:14.969 --> 00:36:21.306
Then for Ã if you
take the square root of this

00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:25.389
it's 2A times cosine
Φ/2.

00:36:25.389 --> 00:36:28.865
So we just reproduced the
answer, but I want you to

00:36:28.865 --> 00:36:33.246
understand that the sum of these
two complex numbers is a number

00:36:33.246 --> 00:36:35.960
of length 2A cosine
Φ/2.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.510
It goes around at the same
ω, but it is shifted.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:44.829
Its phase is half way between
the phase of the two waves.

00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:49.072
That half comes because in a
parallelogram the diagonal will

00:36:49.072 --> 00:36:50.869
bisect the angle Φ.
 

00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:54.559
So this answer is the same as
what we got from trigonometry.

00:36:54.559 --> 00:36:55.768
It's not going to give you
anything new,

00:36:55.768 --> 00:36:59.204
but it's helpful to think of
our actual ψ_1 

00:36:59.204 --> 00:37:01.172
ψ_2,
if you like,

00:37:01.172 --> 00:37:03.925
is the real part,
which is the projection on the

00:37:03.925 --> 00:37:07.536
x-axis,
but it's a lot easier to add

00:37:07.536 --> 00:37:11.880
these arrows than to add the
real parts.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.702
Okay, now I'm going to do the
last part of it one more way,

00:37:16.702 --> 00:37:19.030
so once more with feeling.
 

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.690
So let me do that,
ψ_1 

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.170
ψ_2.
 

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.820
This is when I'm not going to
draw any pictures.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.530
Some people like to draw
pictures.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.579
Some people like to do the
algebra.

00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:33.077
So I'm one of these algebra
types because when they draw a

00:37:33.077 --> 00:37:35.409
picture I don't understand
anything.

00:37:35.409 --> 00:37:37.259
So for fellows like me
ψ_1 

00:37:37.259 --> 00:37:38.969
ψ_2 looks like
this,

00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:42.590
ψ_1 is
Ae^(Iωt),

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.061
ψ_2 is
Ae^(Iωt

00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:53.010
)^(Φ),
which I can write like this.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:38:02.639
So let's write it as a common
Ae^(iωt) times 1

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:07.619
e^(i)^(Φ).
 

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:11.010
This much, I think,
is automatic.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:14.793
Your spinal cord can do this
calculation, but the next move

00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:18.119
requires a little bit of
planning and we do this.

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:23.280
Ae^(iωt) I'm going
to pull half the phase of that

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.088
e^(i)^(Φ)
^(/2) times

00:38:27.088 --> 00:38:30.980
e^(i)^(Φ)
^(/2) e^(

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.449
i)^(Φ)
^(/2).

00:38:34.449 --> 00:38:37.471
You can see if I open all the
brackets this goes back to being

00:38:37.471 --> 00:38:37.670
1.
 

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.030
This goes back to being
e^(i)^(Φ).

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:44.789
The reason I do this is that I
want everybody to know this is a

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:47.280
famous combination,
e^(i)^

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.586
(θ)
e^(-i)^(θ) is

00:38:49.586 --> 00:38:54.130
twice cosine θ,
so twice cosine Φ/2.

00:38:54.130 --> 00:39:02.387
So the sum of all these complex
numbers became 2A cosine

00:39:02.387 --> 00:39:08.382
Φ/2 times e^(iωt
)^(Φ)

00:39:08.382 --> 00:39:11.179
^(/2).
 

00:39:11.179 --> 00:39:15.030
You can see that this is the
amplitude.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:20.293
This is the length of the
vector, and this is angle by

00:39:20.293 --> 00:39:22.480
which it's rotating.
 

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.469
Can you see that?
 

00:39:24.469 --> 00:39:28.480
That's like mod ψ_1
 ψ_2,

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.643
and there's the i times
whatever the phase of

00:39:31.643 --> 00:39:34.250
ψ_1 
ψ_2 is.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:37.425
There are many ways to do this,
but having done it three ways

00:39:37.425 --> 00:39:39.650
you should at least remember the
answer.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:43.670
When you add two waves both at
the same frequency ω,

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:45.900
with a relative phase between
them,

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.632
their sum oscillates at the
same frequency with the phase

00:39:50.632 --> 00:39:55.704
half way between the two with an
amplitude which is 2A

00:39:55.704 --> 00:39:57.309
cosine Φ/2.
 

00:39:57.309 --> 00:40:05.934
Now I'm going to start applying
this result to a variety of

00:40:05.934 --> 00:40:07.570
problems.
 

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.400
The problem I'm going to do is
the following.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.590
I'm going to take--let me start
fresh here.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:19.969
Now I'm going to do the
interference problem.

00:40:19.969 --> 00:40:29.759
For interference you take these
two slits and some wave come

00:40:29.759 --> 00:40:31.750
from here.
 

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.530
It hits the two slits.
 

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.876
Now here's some part of physics
that I'm just going to tell you

00:40:37.876 --> 00:40:39.010
without proving it.
 

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:40.938
I hate doing that,
but once in a while we have to

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:41.340
do that.
 

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.039
I can only appeal to you sense
of logic.

00:40:44.039 --> 00:40:48.751
That is the assumption that if
you look at this wall which is

00:40:48.751 --> 00:40:52.518
completely covered except for
two tiny holes,

00:40:52.518 --> 00:40:56.170
let's say, then any light on
the back,

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.815
on the other side,
will be in the form of two

00:40:58.815 --> 00:41:01.963
glowing objects,
and with the two holes in the

00:41:01.963 --> 00:41:04.590
wall will act like two light
sources.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:05.739
That's how it works,
for example.

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:08.076
You open the window,
the window looks like a source

00:41:08.076 --> 00:41:08.590
of light.
 

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.349
It's coming from somewhere,
but to the people inside the

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:14.309
room that a source of light and
that's a source of light.

00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:16.800
And if the things are very
close to each other,

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.230
this hole, or very small it'll
look like a point source of

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:23.943
light,
and for the point source of

00:41:23.943 --> 00:41:28.639
light the waves will emanate
like this with that as a center,

00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:31.719
and another set of waves with
this at the center,

00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:36.380
and the two will be in sync
because this wave front hits

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.840
them both at the same time.
 

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:44.132
And I'm going to sit somewhere
here, and I'm going to measure

00:41:44.132 --> 00:41:45.719
what's going on.
 

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:47.159
So you imagine this is water
waves.

00:41:47.159 --> 00:41:49.050
This is a top view of the water
wave.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.018
This is a crest and there's a
trough in between,

00:41:51.018 --> 00:41:52.583
another crest,
another trough,

00:41:52.583 --> 00:41:55.467
another crest,
and I'm sitting here and these

00:41:55.467 --> 00:41:58.869
wave are going by,
so two waves will come to me.

00:41:58.869 --> 00:42:03.170
One will come from here,
and one will come from there.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.199
Let that distance be r.
 

00:42:05.199 --> 00:42:10.599
Let that distance be r
δ.

00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:13.039
So I am sitting here.
 

00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:16.358
So the water here will be
bobbing up and down by an amount

00:42:16.358 --> 00:42:19.911
equal to what this guy tells me
to do plus what that guy tells

00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:20.670
me to do.
 

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.322
So I'm only asking you,
"What is the amplitude of

00:42:24.322 --> 00:42:28.460
vibrations of the water here
with both of them open?"

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.639
Well, you've done it many,
many times.

00:42:30.639 --> 00:42:36.304
If the first one sends a signal
Acos(kr -

00:42:36.304 --> 00:42:40.779
ωt),
by the way, you have seen waves

00:42:40.779 --> 00:42:44.974
in one dimension whether it's
cos or sine of kx -

00:42:44.974 --> 00:42:46.289
ωt.
 

00:42:46.289 --> 00:42:51.309
That's the wave in which the
fronts look like this.

00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:54.309
When you advance the next the
lines of constant phase or

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:56.710
maximum of the cosine are lines
like this.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.960
But this is not a plane wave
it's a circular wave.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.681
It spreads out in all
directions, and the points of

00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:06.809
constant phase are circles,
if you like.

00:43:06.809 --> 00:43:09.514
See, here if x is a
constant you get a certain

00:43:09.514 --> 00:43:12.634
phase, and as you vary x
at a given instant you'll get

00:43:12.634 --> 00:43:14.090
the various maxima here.
 

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.860
Here things depend on r.
 

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.177
At a given r the phase
is constant, so if the cosine is

00:43:19.177 --> 00:43:22.548
maximized at one value of r
it's maximized at all values

00:43:22.548 --> 00:43:23.420
of r.
 

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.898
So all the crests will lie on
that semicircle on this side,

00:43:27.898 --> 00:43:31.760
and all the troughs will be
half way in between.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.331
And I remind you that k
is related to the family of

00:43:37.331 --> 00:43:41.730
wavelength by this formula,
2Π/λ.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.039
You see that?
 

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:45.938
If this k was
2Π/λ,

00:43:45.938 --> 00:43:49.750
kr looks like
2Πr/λ.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.010
What that tells you is if to
any given r you add a

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:56.385
λ it doesn't make a
difference because you're adding

00:43:56.385 --> 00:43:58.889
a 2Π to that trigonometric
function.

00:43:58.889 --> 00:44:01.829
That's the relation between
k and λ,

00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:02.789
it's inverted.
 

00:44:02.789 --> 00:44:05.730
Okay, that is ψ_1.
 

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:11.972
ψ_2 has got the
same amplitude cosine kr

00:44:11.972 --> 00:44:16.989
kδ - ωt because
this path,

00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:19.340
I'm assuming is longer by an
amount δ,

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:23.483
so the r measured from
this hole is going to be

00:44:23.483 --> 00:44:24.969
r δ.
 

00:44:24.969 --> 00:44:26.429
So what happens when you add
them?

00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:28.610
It's the same trick we have
done many times.

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:32.474
All you have to do is identify
kδ

00:44:32.474 --> 00:44:34.449
as this number Φ.
 

00:44:34.449 --> 00:44:37.250
That's the phase difference
between the two.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:40.927
And that's the phase difference
because even though these

00:44:40.927 --> 00:44:44.541
apertures are acting as
synchronized sources of waves it

00:44:44.541 --> 00:44:48.416
takes this wave somewhat longer
to get to my point than this

00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:53.952
one,
so there is a delay and that's

00:44:53.952 --> 00:45:00.050
why it arrives with some shift
Φ.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.619
Yes?
 

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:03.780
So what's the amplitude here?
 

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.489
Well, we don't have to do this
over and over again.

00:45:05.489 --> 00:45:12.010
I already told you
Ã is 2A

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:19.949
cosine of Φ/2 becomes cosine
of kδ/2.

00:45:19.949 --> 00:45:23.559
So when is the amplitude big
and when is the amplitude zero?

00:45:23.559 --> 00:45:25.780
That's what we're asking.
 

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.110
If you go along the
perpendicular bisector here you

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:35.307
can see by symmetry that two
r's are equal and δ

00:45:35.307 --> 00:45:39.119
is 0 then amplitude is 2 times
A.

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:42.056
So here the two waves are
completely in step and they give

00:45:42.056 --> 00:45:43.809
you a wave of double the height.
 

00:45:43.809 --> 00:45:46.976
And double the height means
four times the intensity because

00:45:46.976 --> 00:45:49.929
intensity is proportional to
square of the amplitude.

00:45:49.929 --> 00:45:53.579
So this point will have an
amplitude which is 2A.

00:45:53.579 --> 00:45:59.380
I'm just going to draw that
part there, but now let's go to

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:04.880
another place here where
kδ/2 is Π/2.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.849
Well, cosine Π/2 is 0.
 

00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:13.744
At that point the amplitude
will vanish, and then you will

00:46:13.744 --> 00:46:17.260
get no vibration of water there.
 

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.989
Let's understand precisely why
that is true.

00:46:19.989 --> 00:46:25.793
So kδ/2,
k is 2Π/λ

00:46:25.793 --> 00:46:32.586
times δ/2 is Π/2
canceling the 2 with the 2 the

00:46:32.586 --> 00:46:36.539
Π with the Π
I find δ

00:46:36.539 --> 00:46:39.010
is λ/2.
 

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:42.978
That means this second wave has
to travel a distance half a

00:46:42.978 --> 00:46:45.510
wavelength more than the first
one.

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:46.780
I think you can see what that
means.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.849
I mean, here's a wave going
along.

00:46:48.849 --> 00:46:51.925
If that guy hits there and
you're half a wavelength behind

00:46:51.925 --> 00:46:53.329
this guy will hit there.
 

00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:56.103
When you go a half a wavelength
in a wave you're doing exactly

00:46:56.103 --> 00:46:57.969
the opposite of what you're
doing here.

00:46:57.969 --> 00:47:00.329
At every instant you can take
any wave you want,

00:47:00.329 --> 00:47:04.222
take a flash photograph,
go to some point and go half a

00:47:04.222 --> 00:47:07.969
wavelength you'll find you're
doing minus of that.

00:47:07.969 --> 00:47:11.039
Because half a wavelength adds
the phase of Π

00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:14.306
to the cosine or sine,
and sine when you add a Π

00:47:14.306 --> 00:47:15.940
goes to minus itself.
 

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.070
So that's why you get
destructive interference here

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:23.139
because the signal from this one
is telling the water to go up.

00:47:23.139 --> 00:47:25.815
The signal from that one is
telling the water to go down so

00:47:25.815 --> 00:47:26.969
it doesn't do anything.
 

00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:29.068
A little later the first one
says go down,

00:47:29.068 --> 00:47:31.630
second one says go up then also
nothing happens.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:35.550
So you can get two signals that
can actually cancel each other.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:39.840
That's the property of waves.
 

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.150
It's not the property of
intensity.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.409
You might naively think,
"Hey, this used to be

00:47:44.409 --> 00:47:45.900
bright without the second slit.
 

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.920
It used to be bright without
the first slit.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.108
Maybe with both it'll be twice
as bright,"

00:47:50.108 --> 00:47:52.679
and that's wrong because what
adds is not intensity.

00:47:52.679 --> 00:47:56.150
What adds is the amplitude,
the wave is the function ψ,

00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:00.432
and ψ being positive or
negative has the possibility of

00:48:00.432 --> 00:48:03.239
getting canceled by a second
source.

00:48:03.239 --> 00:48:06.574
So one source can cancel
another source in ψ

00:48:06.574 --> 00:48:09.059
and therefore kill the
intensity.

00:48:09.059 --> 00:48:12.052
That's why if you now plot this
graph you'll get a minimum here,

00:48:12.052 --> 00:48:14.143
you'll get a maximum there,
and minimum here,

00:48:14.143 --> 00:48:15.190
and maximum there.
 

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:17.307
So, where are the places where
you get a maximum,

00:48:17.307 --> 00:48:19.559
and where are the places where
you get a minimum?

00:48:19.559 --> 00:48:21.920
So let's write that down.
 

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.181
You remember the
Ã was 2A

00:48:26.181 --> 00:48:28.739
cosine kδ/2.
 

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:32.449
Therefore, Ã is
equal to 2A whenever this

00:48:32.449 --> 00:48:35.125
cosine, I mean,
let's take the absolute value

00:48:35.125 --> 00:48:36.949
of this for the amplitude.
 

00:48:36.949 --> 00:48:43.030
Whenever kδ/2 is
equal to Π,

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:50.512
equal to 3Π plus or minus,
plus or minus 5Π

00:48:50.512 --> 00:49:00.356
and so on that means
2Πδ/λ

00:49:00.356 --> 00:49:06.635
is equal to Π--
let me see.

00:49:06.635 --> 00:49:10.230
I'm doing something wrong here.
 

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:14.510
I'm trying to ask,
when is it a maximum?

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:19.556
The maximum is when this angle
is either 0 or Π,

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:23.494
that's right,
so why am I getting half a

00:49:23.494 --> 00:49:28.340
wavelength is what I'm trying to
understand.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:33.909
Okay, delta over 2.
 

00:49:33.909 --> 00:49:42.659
So this is 2Π/λ
times δ/2 = 0.

00:49:42.659 --> 00:49:43.099
Oh, I'm sorry.
 

00:49:43.099 --> 00:49:44.599
I know what I did wrong.
 

00:49:44.599 --> 00:49:46.820
This whole thing has to be 0.
 

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:47.960
That's good.
 

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.429
That means δ is 0.
 

00:49:49.429 --> 00:49:52.699
What's the next time it'll be a
maximum?

00:49:52.699 --> 00:49:56.829
When this whole thing is equal
to Π, so let me see what I

00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:57.880
get for that.
 

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:03.059
These two cancel and I get
δ is equal to λ.

00:50:03.059 --> 00:50:04.746
Can you see that,
2 cancels 2,

00:50:04.746 --> 00:50:06.679
Π cancels Π,
δ equals λ,

00:50:06.679 --> 00:50:08.420
so you can have δ
equal to 0,

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:11.880
λ plus or minus,
plus or minus.

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:15.260
They're all going to be bright
if you're talking about light.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:20.449
They're going to be huge waves
if you're talking about water.

00:50:20.449 --> 00:50:24.150
On the other hand if this is
equal to Π/2,

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:27.730
3Π/2 etcetera,
plus or minus,

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:32.197
then there's going to be dark,
that means that δ

00:50:32.197 --> 00:50:38.150
is equal to λ/2,
3λ/2 etcetera.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:43.376
So there will be bright and
dark, and bright and dark

00:50:43.376 --> 00:50:45.789
fringes on the screen.
 

00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:49.842
If you go to the screen here
the midpoint will be bright,

00:50:49.842 --> 00:50:53.750
but it'll be oscillating like
that many, many times.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.869
This was the experiment that
was done by Young.

00:50:56.869 --> 00:51:02.971
Young did the experiment with
light and showed that it has an

00:51:02.971 --> 00:51:05.309
interference pattern.
 

00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:08.460
He did not know what light was.
 

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.081
He did not produce
electromagnetic waves,

00:51:10.081 --> 00:51:11.460
but you don't need to know
that.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.150
You shine the light,
you get the dark and bright,

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:16.083
and dark and bright,
and I will tell you in a minute

00:51:16.083 --> 00:51:19.710
how we can find the wavelength
of light from this experiment.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.409
You can probably guess,
but I'll do that in a minute.

00:51:22.409 --> 00:51:26.110
He got the wavelength of light,
but he didn't know what it is

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:29.070
that was vibrating,
but he got the wavelength.

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:34.309
So let's ask ourselves exactly
where on this screen I will get

00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:37.659
dark and bright,
and dark and bright.

00:51:37.659 --> 00:51:41.280
So for that you've got to do a
little more geometry now.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:46.849
So let's do that geometry here.
 

00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:51.210
So here is the double slit.
 

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:53.679
I want to go in some direction.
 

00:51:53.679 --> 00:51:57.224
I'm assuming the screen is so
far away that the rays can be

00:51:57.224 --> 00:51:58.570
treated as parallel.
 

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:03.086
And I want to go at an angle
theta so that these lengths are

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:03.699
equal.
 

00:52:03.699 --> 00:52:09.541
This is the extra length delta
here, and this is the distance

00:52:09.541 --> 00:52:11.880
between the two slits.
 

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:17.360
So you can see delta is equal
to dsinθ,

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.324
because this angle θ
between the horizontal and the

00:52:20.324 --> 00:52:23.130
ray is the same as the
perpendicular of the horizontal

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:25.090
and the perpendicular to the
ray.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.059
It's at that angle.
 

00:52:27.059 --> 00:52:30.340
So dsinθ is
δ,

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:36.233
and that had to be equal to
either 0 or an integer multiple

00:52:36.233 --> 00:52:41.804
of λ for a maximum,
or equal to plus or minus

00:52:41.804 --> 00:52:47.603
λ/2,
plus or minus 3λ

00:52:47.603 --> 00:52:55.119
over 2 half wavelengths for a
minimum.

00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:57.420
Can you imagine doing this
calculation?

00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.297
If someone says,
"Here is light of some

00:52:59.297 --> 00:53:02.092
wavelength,
5,000 angstroms or 500

00:53:02.092 --> 00:53:07.349
nanometers, the slits are
separated by some microns or

00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:11.018
whatever,"
then you can say,

00:53:11.018 --> 00:53:15.373
"What's the angle θ
at which I will get a maximum

00:53:15.373 --> 00:53:16.480
or a minimum?
 

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.750
Well, you can already do this
calculation.

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.672
If you wanted the first maximum
you said

00:53:20.672 --> 00:53:23.039
dsinθ equal
to wavelength.

00:53:23.039 --> 00:53:25.733
You solve for sine θ
and look at a calculator,

00:53:25.733 --> 00:53:27.369
it'll tell you what theta is.
 

00:53:27.369 --> 00:53:29.788
Then you can go and see,
"Maybe I can get two

00:53:29.788 --> 00:53:31.762
lambda,"
then that can also give you

00:53:31.762 --> 00:53:32.750
another θ.
 

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:36.012
But remember,
it cannot go on forever because

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:39.751
at some point sine theta,
which will be some multiple of

00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:42.079
λ/d where m is an
integer,

00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:44.530
if it's bigger than 1 no luck.
 

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:47.739
Sine theta cannot be bigger
than 1.

00:53:47.739 --> 00:53:53.768
So you'll get some number of
this maxima then it'll stop.

00:53:53.768 --> 00:53:57.494
That's because if you've got
two signals coming from here to

00:53:57.494 --> 00:54:00.840
here only if you go in this
direction will you get the

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.481
maximum phase,
the maximum path difference if

00:54:03.481 --> 00:54:06.047
you go straight up,
and if that's not enough to be

00:54:06.047 --> 00:54:08.590
some multiple of λ
there's no use going any

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:11.289
further because theta you can
get is 90 degrees,

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:14.373
and the biggest path length you
can get is then the space

00:54:14.373 --> 00:54:17.695
between the slits d,
and your multiple wavelength

00:54:17.695 --> 00:54:19.309
should fit into that.
 

00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:22.902
So I hope all of you understand
this very simple experiment,

00:54:22.902 --> 00:54:24.670
the double slit experiment.
 

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:26.699
So light comes from the left.
 

00:54:26.699 --> 00:54:29.018
These two points act like
sources of light.

00:54:29.018 --> 00:54:31.539
They send out spherical or
circular waves.

00:54:31.539 --> 00:54:35.748
You go to a screen far away and
you add the contribution from

00:54:35.748 --> 00:54:36.449
the two.
 

00:54:36.449 --> 00:54:39.594
If this and that differ in the
path length by an integer number

00:54:39.594 --> 00:54:41.369
of wavelengths it doesn't
matter.

00:54:41.369 --> 00:54:43.639
They will arrive in step.
 

00:54:43.639 --> 00:54:45.871
I mean, the ninety-sixth
maximum will come when the

00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:48.460
ninety-fifth one from this one
comes, but we don't care.

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.389
A maximum is a maximum.
 

00:54:50.389 --> 00:54:55.552
If they differ by half a
wavelength or three halves

00:54:55.552 --> 00:55:01.335
wavelengths then they will
cancel, and what I said on the

00:55:01.335 --> 00:55:04.639
top also goes on the bottom.
 

00:55:04.639 --> 00:55:09.079
Now sometimes there is a little
extra geometry you can do which

00:55:09.079 --> 00:55:10.440
is the following.
 

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.909
This may be some homework
problem.

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:19.548
If you put a screen here at the
distance L and the

00:55:19.548 --> 00:55:25.148
patterns look like this,
this is the central maximum,

00:55:25.148 --> 00:55:27.838
and I ask you,
"Where is the central

00:55:27.838 --> 00:55:29.920
minimum measured from
here," well,

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.320
you call that distance as
y.

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.211
Then you see y/L is
tanθ and

00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:41.099
θ should be such
that dsinθ

00:55:41.099 --> 00:55:42.590
is λ/2.
 

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:44.150
Are you with me?
 

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:46.320
You find the directions of
minima.

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.155
Once you find the found the
direction of a maximum or a

00:55:49.155 --> 00:55:51.782
minimum it is simple
trigonometry to find that if a

00:55:51.782 --> 00:55:54.985
screen is L meters away
how much do you have to move in

00:55:54.985 --> 00:55:56.510
the vertical direction.
 

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:57.820
That's very easy trig.
 

00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.289
You can calculate and you can
predict.

00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:03.418
That's what Young did because
he knew the distance between the

00:56:03.418 --> 00:56:05.179
maximum and the minimum.
 

00:56:05.179 --> 00:56:07.059
He knew how far the screens
were.

00:56:07.059 --> 00:56:09.159
He knew the slit separation.
 

00:56:09.159 --> 00:56:14.027
All he did not know was the
wavelength and he got the

00:56:14.027 --> 00:56:19.268
wavelength without knowing what
the waves are made of.

00:56:19.268 --> 00:56:24.969
Now you can see why you got
fooled in the old days.

00:56:24.969 --> 00:56:32.909
If y/L is--so let's make an
estimation of how far apart

00:56:32.909 --> 00:56:39.380
these maxima and minima are in
this graph.

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:44.492
Since they repeat let me just
take the first minimum,

00:56:44.492 --> 00:56:49.309
and that's a rough measure of
the oscillations.

00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:51.579
How far apart are these maxima
and minima?

00:56:51.579 --> 00:56:57.378
Well, the first one occurs when
dsinθ is

00:56:57.378 --> 00:57:01.186
equal to λ/2,
or sinθ,

00:57:01.186 --> 00:57:05.239
which is roughly going to be
θ for small angles is

00:57:05.239 --> 00:57:06.860
λ/2d.
 

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:10.204
Now if you pick any λ
you like, visible light is

00:57:10.204 --> 00:57:11.320
5,000 angstroms.
 

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:16.849
That is 5000�10^(-8
)centimeters.

00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:22.099
And suppose your screen is 1
centimeter away?

00:57:22.099 --> 00:57:31.380
Then you get 5�10^(-3).
 

00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.809
So it's roughly one-thousandth
of a radian is the difference

00:57:34.809 --> 00:57:37.018
between the maximum and the
minimum.

00:57:37.018 --> 00:57:42.338
The interference pattern,
even though I've shown it this

00:57:42.338 --> 00:57:47.268
way here, actually oscillates
very, very rapidly.

00:57:47.268 --> 00:57:49.885
Okay, the angle of difference
between the maximum and a

00:57:49.885 --> 00:57:52.646
minimum and a maximum and a
minimum is one-thousandth of a

00:57:52.646 --> 00:57:53.179
radian.
 

00:57:53.179 --> 00:57:57.545
So even if you go a centimeter
away you will find that your

00:57:57.545 --> 00:58:01.612
probes, like your eyeball,
if your eyeball is this big,

00:58:01.612 --> 00:58:02.289
okay?
 

00:58:02.289 --> 00:58:04.690
It's going to pick up so many
of these waves at one time.

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:08.820
It cannot tell the maximum and
minimum.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.376
That's why we think there is no
interference because you only

00:58:12.376 --> 00:58:13.860
pick the average value.
 

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:22.210
That's why you have to do very
careful measurements.

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:35.190
Okay, so that is double slit.
 

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:39.351
Okay, here's another thing
which will be very useful for

00:58:39.351 --> 00:58:43.590
people who are doing biology,
or maybe even chemistry.

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:47.940
Let's call it diffraction
grading.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:51.963
In a diffraction grading you
take a piece of opaque glass

00:58:51.963 --> 00:58:56.130
covered with black soot then you
draw fine lines on it,

00:58:56.130 --> 00:59:00.309
evenly spaced lines so that the
effect is the following.

00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:05.030
This whole thing is dark except
you've made some tiny places

00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:09.349
where light can come through
like that, and the light's

00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:11.030
coming like this.
 

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.610
Are you with me?
 

00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:16.349
This is my solid screen with a
few places through which light

00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:20.380
can come, and every one of them
becomes a source.

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.518
It's like a double slit
experiment except you've got

00:59:23.518 --> 00:59:25.797
million of lines,
and you want to ask,

00:59:25.797 --> 00:59:27.889
"What will they do?"
 

00:59:27.889 --> 00:59:31.302
In the forward direction if you
put an object,

00:59:31.302 --> 00:59:35.550
if you put a screen very far
away that's roughly infinity

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:38.659
they all take the same path
distance.

00:59:38.659 --> 00:59:40.400
They all go to the same
distance.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.860
Therefore they will all be in
step.

00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:46.438
So in the forward direction you
will get a big maximum,

00:59:46.438 --> 00:59:50.282
because for every color the
path is the same in the forward

00:59:50.282 --> 00:59:51.210
direction.
 

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:54.391
But think of another direction
which is not the forward

00:59:54.391 --> 00:59:55.099
direction.
 

00:59:55.099 --> 00:59:58.630
It's some other angle.
 

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:01.971
Then this guy and this guy are
out of step by an amount

01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:02.590
δ.
 

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:04.860
This guy and this guy are out
of step by an amount δ.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.900
This guy and this guy are out
of step by 2δ,

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.210
so all the sources add up at
face difference of δ,

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.530
2δ, 3δ,
4δ and so on.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.659
And suppose you want them all
to be still coherent.

01:00:16.659 --> 01:00:19.559
What will you require?
 

01:00:19.559 --> 01:00:26.144
What will ensure that all those
things are coherent in a certain

01:00:26.144 --> 01:00:27.400
direction?
 

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.090
Any guess on what δ
should be?

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:30.760
Yep?
 

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.440
Student:  It's equal to
the wavelength.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.891
Prof: If δ
is equal to the wavelength this

01:00:34.891 --> 01:00:36.800
guy and this guy are a
wavelength apart.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.376
We already know they are in
step from the double slit

01:00:39.376 --> 01:00:40.018
experiment.
 

01:00:40.018 --> 01:00:42.409
This guy and this guy are a
wavelength apart.

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:44.440
This guy and this guy are two
wavelengths apart.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.489
That is just fine.
 

01:00:46.489 --> 01:00:50.380
Therefore if you pick a
direction in which that delta is

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.411
either a wavelength or an
integer multiple of a wavelength

01:00:54.411 --> 01:00:57.170
all the things will add
coherently.

01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:01.244
Therefore the favorable
direction for a bright maximum

01:01:01.244 --> 01:01:02.681
satisfy,
again,

01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:06.916
dsinθ =
mλ

01:01:06.916 --> 01:01:12.039
where m can be 0 plus or minus
1 plus or minus 2.

01:01:12.039 --> 01:01:16.159
These are the maximum.
 

01:01:16.159 --> 01:01:20.447
Except here in the forward
direction where θ

01:01:20.447 --> 01:01:23.949
is equal to 0--okay,
here's the point.

01:01:23.949 --> 01:01:26.929
Let us find the first maximum
away from the center.

01:01:26.929 --> 01:01:30.900
The center is not even counted,
center being white.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.541
All the colors will come to the
forward direction and you will

01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:38.005
get a big bright area here,
but look at what happens to the

01:01:38.005 --> 01:01:39.260
different colors.
 

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.880
This condition,
let's take m = 1,

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.500
dsinθ =
λ.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.802
Whose λ
are we talking about,

01:01:46.802 --> 01:01:47.329
right?
 

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.960
Red light is one λ,
blue light's another λ.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.855
So each one will pick a
different λ,

01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:56.992
each one will pick a different
direction for this first order

01:01:56.992 --> 01:01:57.820
maximum.
 

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.110
So that means the white light,
when it comes in this

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:03.949
direction, will be split into
many colors.

01:02:03.949 --> 01:02:08.284
It is just that they all shrink
to one line here in the center,

01:02:08.284 --> 01:02:11.289
but any other place the lines
will split.

01:02:11.289 --> 01:02:14.550
That's because λ
depends on the color;

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:17.628
d is, of course,
the spacing between these

01:02:17.628 --> 01:02:20.856
little lines on the grating,
so sine θ

01:02:20.856 --> 01:02:23.110
is a function of λ.
 

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:24.239
So it acts like a prism.
 

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:26.059
It splits the colors.
 

01:02:26.059 --> 01:02:30.139
So this is called the first
order maximum.

01:02:30.139 --> 01:02:32.650
Between this and that will be a
minimum.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:33.820
Then there'll be another
minimum.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:34.768
Then there's a maximum.
 

01:02:34.768 --> 01:02:38.300
It's harder to calculate the
minimum, very easy to calculate

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.139
the maximum.
 

01:02:39.139 --> 01:02:40.579
So it's easy to calculate the
maximum.

01:02:40.579 --> 01:02:42.219
That's when everybody has to
add.

01:02:42.219 --> 01:02:46.018
Minimum is more complicated
because everybody has to cancel.

01:02:46.018 --> 01:02:48.168
You've got to add the little
arrows in different directions

01:02:48.168 --> 01:02:49.170
and ask when they cancel.
 

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.695
You can do it,
but it's a little more

01:02:50.695 --> 01:02:51.289
complicated.
 

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:54.550
But we can sort of imagine that
between the maxima would lie the

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:56.619
minima, but the colors will get
split.

01:02:56.619 --> 01:03:00.369
That's important.
 

01:03:00.369 --> 01:03:03.889
So this is how people find out.
 

01:03:03.889 --> 01:03:07.420
So if you send white light it
will split into all the colors.

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:10.972
If you look at white light
coming from the sun you'll find

01:03:10.972 --> 01:03:14.836
some colors are missing because
what happens is hydrogen in the

01:03:14.836 --> 01:03:18.577
surface of the sun will absorb
some of the colors because its

01:03:18.577 --> 01:03:20.824
atomic--
its atom likes to absorb light

01:03:20.824 --> 01:03:21.739
at a certain color.
 

01:03:21.739 --> 01:03:25.480
That color is missing,
missing in the spectrum.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.800
So in this whole area you'll
have a little cavity.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.257
Somebody is missing and you can
easily tell from the wavelength

01:03:32.257 --> 01:03:35.349
that it's some emission line of
hydrogen.

01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:38.239
That tells you the sun contains
hydrogen.

01:03:38.239 --> 01:03:40.467
That's how people know what
elements are sitting on

01:03:40.467 --> 01:03:41.360
different planets.
 

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.070
How does anybody know what
they're made of?

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.661
It was not at all clear in the
ancient days that stars and

01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:50.309
planets are made of the same
thing you are,

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.940
right?
 

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.989
People thought moon was made of
cheese.

01:03:52.989 --> 01:03:55.840
Well, that's pretty much the
same thing that you are,

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.320
but something else,
okay?

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:57.940
But they didn't know.
 

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:00.510
They thought that heavenly
bodies and earthly bodies,

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:03.971
but now we find it's the same
elements because you can find

01:04:03.971 --> 01:04:07.132
the spectra lines either by
their presence or by their

01:04:07.132 --> 01:04:07.849
absence.
 

01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:12.070
So this is the kind of
spectroscopy you do.

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:16.789
Okay, now I'm going to do one
other thing which is extremely

01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:17.750
important.
 

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:22.307
That is to explain why when
light comes through a hole of

01:04:22.307 --> 01:04:27.436
some size d instead of forming a
shadow like this it spreads out

01:04:27.436 --> 01:04:30.530
a lot into something much
broader.

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:31.920
So let's understand that, okay?
 

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.969
Here is light coming in.
 

01:04:35.969 --> 01:04:40.119
Now what you can do is this
aperture is going to be bright.

01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:42.518
When you see it from this side
it'll be glowing.

01:04:42.518 --> 01:04:48.829
So let's treat every point of
it as a source of light.

01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:52.190
In the forward direction
everybody's in step,

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:56.934
but if you go off at some angle
they're not in step because you

01:04:56.934 --> 01:04:59.920
can see this guy is behind that
guy,

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.289
and that guy's behind by that
amount.

01:05:01.289 --> 01:05:05.909
Each one is somewhat behind the
leader.

01:05:05.909 --> 01:05:11.239
Now my claim that if this
number here is λ,

01:05:11.239 --> 01:05:14.719
what do you think will happen?
 

01:05:14.719 --> 01:05:18.976
In that direction if that
spacing is λ

01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:23.329
is that going to be a maximum
or a minimum?

01:05:23.329 --> 01:05:25.119
Anybody want to guess?
 

01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:27.090
Pardon me?
 

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:27.929
Yes?
 

01:05:27.929 --> 01:05:28.719
Student:  Minimum.
 

01:05:28.719 --> 01:05:30.739
Prof: And on what do you
base that?

01:05:30.739 --> 01:05:36.650
Student:  Because the
λ/2 ________ the minimum,

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:37.440
and...
 

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.659
Prof: But this thing is
λ.

01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:42.538
Usually λ
between two holes was

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:45.340
considered good,
but now it's bad.

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.867
The reason is that it's just
not the top guy and the bottom

01:05:47.867 --> 01:05:48.130
guy.
 

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:51.110
It's all these little guys in
between.

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:54.804
So if this and that differ by
λ, by similar triangles,

01:05:54.804 --> 01:05:56.960
you see that's λ
over two?

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.376
So this fellow will cancel that
fellow, and the second guy will

01:06:01.376 --> 01:06:04.440
be canceled by the second guy
from below.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.329
So when the whole phase shift
is λ,

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:07.880
or the path difference is
λ,

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.445
you can pair the points into
two at a time each differing by

01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:14.650
λ/2 and we know they will
separately cancel.

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:17.905
So for a single slit the
fraction

01:06:17.905 --> 01:06:24.110
dsinθ =
λ is the first minimum,

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:26.177
and after that some funny
things happen which are

01:06:26.177 --> 01:06:30.762
negligible,
but the light spreads out to

01:06:30.762 --> 01:06:32.469
that angle.
 

01:06:32.469 --> 01:06:35.949
And this is the diffraction of
light by an opening.

01:06:35.949 --> 01:06:36.730
And let's look at it.
 

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:41.550
Sine θ
is λ/d.

01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:46.420
Suppose λ
is 10^(-4) and d is 1?

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.675
Sine θ
= theta 10^(-4) that means the

01:06:49.675 --> 01:06:53.860
angular spread is 1 over
ten-thousandth of a radian.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.659
That's the extent to which
light won't go straight.

01:06:56.659 --> 01:06:58.592
It'll spread out,
but the spread is 1 over

01:06:58.592 --> 01:06:59.960
ten-thousandth of a radian.
 

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.250
It's very small.
 

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:05.519
But take a case where λ
and d become comparable,

01:07:05.519 --> 01:07:12.010
maybe d is equal to 2λ,
then sine θ is one-half.

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:13.710
That's 30 degrees.
 

01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:16.510
It's already beginning to
spread out.

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:19.996
That's why I said earlier that
if you want to see the effect of

01:07:19.996 --> 01:07:23.260
wave optics you need to have the
length in the problem,

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.996
which is the size of the hole,
and the wavelength in the

01:07:25.996 --> 01:07:27.739
problem comparable to each
other.

01:07:27.739 --> 01:07:30.831
If the wavelength is much
smaller than the dimensions of

01:07:30.831 --> 01:07:33.980
your experiment you can get away
with the ray optics,

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:38.590
and you need wave optics only
when the condition is not met.

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:41.858
So I remind you one more time
why people thought ray optics

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:42.480
was good.
 

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.250
They were not able to produce
slits which are this narrow.

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.719
Most slits you produce by
drilling a hole with your

01:07:47.719 --> 01:07:50.485
electric drill will be many,
many times the wavelength of

01:07:50.485 --> 01:07:50.980
light.
 

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:54.201
That means its angular spread
will be slightly non-zero,

01:07:54.201 --> 01:07:57.481
but instead of a shadow that
big you'll get a shadow that

01:07:57.481 --> 01:07:57.949
big.
 

01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:59.099
You won't know.
 

01:07:59.099 --> 01:08:01.079
Similarly the interference
pattern,

01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:05.137
the interference pattern for
microscopic separations between

01:08:05.137 --> 01:08:09.331
the slits will be so tight that
your eye cannot detect it even

01:08:09.331 --> 01:08:13.083
if you use light of one color,
and if you use light of many

01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:15.769
colors it'll wash out anyway
because each lambda likes to

01:08:15.769 --> 01:08:19.672
peak at a different angle,
so different colors would wipe

01:08:19.672 --> 01:08:20.328
it out.
 

01:08:20.328 --> 01:08:23.539
So I wanted to let you know why
it is that people believed in

01:08:23.539 --> 01:08:26.483
geometric optics in the
beginning because they didn't do

01:08:26.483 --> 01:08:27.340
experiments.
 

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.250
This is why every theory will
fall.

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:31.600
One day somebody has the
technology to produce slits

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.832
which are very,
very near and to get light

01:08:33.832 --> 01:08:36.801
which is very pure of a definite
color then you will see

01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:37.720
something new.
 

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.010
Then you've got to figure out
what it is.

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:41.954
But when Young did the
experiment and saw the

01:08:41.954 --> 01:08:44.520
interference they knew right
away it's waves because people

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.742
had played with water waves,
and they knew with water waves

01:08:48.742 --> 01:08:51.689
that you can have interference.
 

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:56.189
Okay, here's another thing you
can do.

01:08:56.189 --> 01:09:00.868
Here is a bunch of atoms at the
surface of some metal.

01:09:00.868 --> 01:09:06.970
Metal's down here,
and I'm shining light.

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.829
You know how reflection works?
 

01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:10.279
The light hits the atom.
 

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.609
Atom absorbs the light and it
reemits the light.

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:14.920
That's what reflection is.
 

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.819
You don't just bounce off.
 

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.609
You get absorbed and get
reemitted.

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:23.000
Now the problem is if you
reemit you reemit in all

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:23.899
directions.
 

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:26.390
You don't just reemit in one
direction.

01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:30.355
The question you can ask is,
why is it that i = r for

01:09:30.355 --> 01:09:31.229
reflection?
 

01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:34.239
That's what I want to explain
to you.

01:09:34.239 --> 01:09:35.880
So this guy emits something.
 

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.229
There's a wave emanating from
this.

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:39.979
This guy emits something,
wave emanating from that.

01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:46.538
So let's take two rays going
off in some direction.

01:09:46.538 --> 01:09:52.105
And let's just ask when these
two guys will be in step in

01:09:52.105 --> 01:09:54.890
terms of the emitted wave.
 

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:57.949
So you see the light signal is
coming from here.

01:09:57.949 --> 01:10:00.140
It hits this one first.
 

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.939
Are you with me?
 

01:10:01.939 --> 01:10:03.420
So this emits right way.
 

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.729
Its signal has started taking
off in the final direction.

01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:09.689
This guy is delayed because it
hasn't hit this,

01:10:09.689 --> 01:10:13.936
but once they start moving
toward the eye this is closer

01:10:13.936 --> 01:10:16.742
than this one,
so you see this one and that

01:10:16.742 --> 01:10:19.140
one, if you want to make a real
comparison--

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.408
well, this is bad picture.
 

01:10:20.408 --> 01:10:23.462
Let me draw you another picture
where there's a good competition

01:10:23.462 --> 01:10:24.189
between them.
 

01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:25.840
So let's see.
 

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.341
Suppose I had a really bad idea
and I thought they reflect like

01:10:30.341 --> 01:10:30.850
this.
 

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:32.470
I'll show you that won't work.
 

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:34.380
That's all I want to do.
 

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.006
You see what you should do is
draw perpendicular here and

01:10:39.006 --> 01:10:42.643
that's the extra distance this
has to travel,

01:10:42.643 --> 01:10:43.470
right?
 

01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:45.363
And you will draw a
perpendicular here and let's

01:10:45.363 --> 01:10:47.658
see, what's the extra distance
the other has to travel?

01:10:47.658 --> 01:10:50.600
It has to travel that extra
distance.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:54.033
So if you draw those two angles
you will find--let's see which

01:10:54.033 --> 01:10:55.328
angle I want to take.
 

01:10:55.328 --> 01:10:58.270
If you call this alpha you'll
find d cosine

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:01.868
α_1 is d
cosine α_2 or

01:11:01.868 --> 01:11:04.630
α_1 =
α_2.

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:08.010
That means I = r.
 

01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:08.788
You see that?
 

01:11:08.788 --> 01:11:11.479
Maybe I should repeat the
picture here so everybody can

01:11:11.479 --> 01:11:11.779
see.
 

01:11:11.779 --> 01:11:15.460
I just need two of them.
 

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.948
So one let me draw like this.
 

01:11:17.948 --> 01:11:23.149
Let me draw the second at what
is definitely not i = r.

01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:27.440
So here I'm saying draw that
perpendicular and draw that

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.689
perpendicular.
 

01:11:28.689 --> 01:11:32.011
Starting from infinity these
two have the same length,

01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:34.078
those two have the same length.
 

01:11:34.078 --> 01:11:36.560
This is an extra length
traveled by this guy.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.795
That's the extra length
traveled by that guy,

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:40.310
okay?
 

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:43.085
So if you call that angle
alpha, you call that angle

01:11:43.085 --> 01:11:45.694
β,
and if this is d,

01:11:45.694 --> 01:11:49.046
you can see that d
cosine α

01:11:49.046 --> 01:11:54.380
must be d cosine β
or α should be β.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.760
That is a very interesting
result.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.260
It tells you why i = r
is true.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.296
See, if light is made up of
particles that bounce off a wall

01:12:02.296 --> 01:12:05.280
and ricochet with i = r
you can understand that from

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.618
conservation momentum.
 

01:12:06.618 --> 01:12:09.900
But light is a wave and when
the atoms absorb light they emit

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.743
in all directions,
but only in this direction will

01:12:12.743 --> 01:12:15.966
everybody be in step because
once I made sure these two guys

01:12:15.966 --> 01:12:19.300
are in step you can repeat it
for these two and those two.

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:24.728
You'll find that's the
direction in which every single

01:12:24.728 --> 01:12:26.470
guy is in step.
 

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:29.404
So i = r is the
direction in which the

01:12:29.404 --> 01:12:33.340
re-radiated light arrives in
step in only one direction,

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.163
and that's the direction with
the angle of incidence is the

01:12:36.163 --> 01:12:37.430
angle of the reflection.
 

01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:40.578
You understand why there is a
difference?

01:12:40.578 --> 01:12:44.542
Okay, one last thing I should
mention, because I've given a

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:47.755
problem for you,
and I just want to tell you one

01:12:47.755 --> 01:12:49.600
trick you may not know.
 

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.250
And you can read up.
 

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.590
The book is very good in that.
 

01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:58.010
If you've got some oil slick on
a rainy day, there's water here.

01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:00.130
This is an oil slick.
 

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:02.090
You see all kind of colors in
the oil slick?

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:04.340
This is to explain why it is.
 

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:09.195
So white light comes or any
light comes, bounces off the top

01:13:09.195 --> 01:13:10.020
surface.
 

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.350
The light also bounces off the
bottom surface.

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:19.310
And the sum of those two hit
your eye.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:23.206
Suppose you want to arrange it
so that blue light cancels out

01:13:23.206 --> 01:13:24.310
in the process?
 

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:27.399
What will it take to cancel?
 

01:13:27.399 --> 01:13:30.592
I claim first of all the
wavelength in this medium is

01:13:30.592 --> 01:13:32.189
n times the wave.
 

01:13:32.189 --> 01:13:34.800
It's λ/n.
 

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.543
If this is the wavelength here
the wavelength in a medium of

01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:39.729
refractive and n is
λ/n.

01:13:39.729 --> 01:13:43.194
If this whole thing is equal to
a full wavelength,

01:13:43.194 --> 01:13:46.729
this round trip,
I claim you'll get a dark spot.

01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:49.720
You may think that's wrong
because this guy's gone an extra

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.649
full wavelength.
 

01:13:50.649 --> 01:13:53.868
That should be additive,
but it turns out that when

01:13:53.868 --> 01:13:57.601
light bounces off in going from
a rare to a dense medium it

01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:59.470
changes by an extra Π.
 

01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:02.939
At the other end when it goes
from dense to rare it doesn't.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:06.609
So you have to add an extra
Π to everything you thought.

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.762
Then you will find out that
when this extra round trip is

01:14:09.762 --> 01:14:12.859
the full wavelength you get
destructive interference.

01:14:12.859 --> 01:14:15.422
So if that occurs for a
wavelength for blue light you

01:14:15.422 --> 01:14:18.182
take blue light out of white
light you get some yellowish

01:14:18.182 --> 01:14:19.118
greenish color.
 

01:14:19.118 --> 01:14:22.640
That's what you see in the oil
slick.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.368
And if the oil slick thickness
varies different colors will be

01:14:25.368 --> 01:14:27.158
missing from white at different
point.

01:14:27.158 --> 01:14:30.208
That's why you see all kinds of
different colors in the oil

01:14:30.208 --> 01:14:30.630
slick.
 

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:32.721
So I agree I didn't do a good
job of this one,

01:14:32.721 --> 01:14:34.488
but this is the easiest thing
to me.

01:14:34.488 --> 01:14:36.930
The only thing to do,
when you do your homework,

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:40.389
if you didn't read the section
don't forget there's an extra

01:14:40.389 --> 01:14:43.027
factor of Π
in the phase shift when you hit

01:14:43.027 --> 01:14:44.199
the hard medium.
 

01:14:44.199 --> 01:14:49.000

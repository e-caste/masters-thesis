00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.985
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time we ended with the

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:09.002
following puzzle or question.
If we say that to be a person

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:13.245
is to be a P-functioning
body, it seems then as though we

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:17.420
have to conclude that when
you're not P-functioning,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.835
you're dead.
That is, you're dead as a

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:22.506
person.
Previously, we distinguished

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:25.150
between the death of my body and
my death as a person;

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.040
let's focus on my death as a
person.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.737
If I'm not
P-functioning,

00:00:30.737 --> 00:00:32.600
do we have to then say I'm
dead?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.274
Well, that may seem to be the
most natural way to define

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:39.280
death, but it's not an
acceptable approach.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.189
Because it would follow then,
that when I'm asleep,

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.389
I'm dead.
Well, not during those times,

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:49.360
perhaps, when I'm dreaming
while I'm asleep.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.713
But think of the various
periods during the night in

00:00:52.713 --> 00:00:55.870
which you are in a deep,
deep dreamless sleep.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.720
You're not thinking.
You're not planning.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.791
You're not communicating.
Let's just suppose,

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:03.506
as seems likely,
that none of the

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:08.086
P-functioning is
occurring, at some point during

00:01:08.086 --> 00:01:10.911
sleep.
Should we say then that you're

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:13.395
dead?
Well, that's clearly not the

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:16.594
right thing to say.
So we need to revise our

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:20.760
account of what it is on the
physicalist picture to say that

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.060
you're dead.
What is it to be dead?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.250
It can't just be a matter of
not P-functioning.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.545
Well, one possibility would be
to say, the question is not

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:31.799
whether you are
P-functioning.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.522
It's okay if you're not
P-functioning,

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:39.075
as long as your not
P-functioning is

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:42.126
temporary.
If you will P-function

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:45.667
again, if you have been
P-functioning in the past

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.500
and you will be
P-functioning again in

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.174
the future,
P-functioning for person

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:53.987
functioning, you will be
P-functioning again in

00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:57.180
the future,
then you're not dead.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.960
Well, that's at least an
improvement, because then we

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.262
say, look, while you're asleep,
even though there's no

00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:03.447
P-functioning going on,
the lack of

00:02:03.447 --> 00:02:05.420
P-functioning is
temporary,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.768
so you're still alive.
But I think that won't quite do

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:14.431
either.
Let's suppose that come

00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:19.669
Judgment Day,
God will resurrect the dead.

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:23.076
And let's just suppose the
correct theory of personal

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:27.204
identity is such as to put aside
any worries we might have along

00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:29.824
with van Inwagen,
that we discussed previously,

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:31.970
as to whether or not on
resurrection day that would

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.010
really be you or not.
Suppose it would be you.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.800
So God will resurrect the dead.
Judgment Day comes.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.913
The dead are resurrected.
Well, now they're

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:47.110
P-functioning.
So it turns out that during

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.085
that period in which they were
dead, they were only temporarily

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:55.145
not P-functioning.
But if death means permanent

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:57.815
cessation of
P-functioning,

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:02.669
then it turns out the dead
weren't really dead after all.

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.599
They were only temporarily not
P-functioning,

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.990
just like we are temporarily
not P-functioning when

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.079
we're asleep.
Well, that doesn't seem right

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.819
either.
On Judgment Day,

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.744
God resurrects the dead.
It's not that He simply wakes

00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:23.419
up those in a deep,
deep sleep.

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.539
So the proposal that death is a
matter of permanent cessation of

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.789
P-functioning versus
temporary,

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.849
that doesn't seem like it's
going to do the trick.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.680
But what else do we have up our
sleeves?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.620
Here's a different proposal
that I think is probably closer

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.364
to the right account.
We might say,

00:03:44.364 --> 00:03:47.441
look, while you're asleep,
it's true that you're not

00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:49.807
P-functioning.
For example,

00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:53.250
you're not doing your
multiplication tables.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.902
But although you are not
engaged in P-functioning,

00:03:57.902 --> 00:04:03.219
it does seem true to say that
you still can P-function.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.090
You still could do your
multiplication tables.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.567
Although it's not true that you
are speaking French--let's

00:04:10.567 --> 00:04:14.227
suppose that you know how to
speak French--it's still true of

00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:18.070
you while you're asleep that you
can or could speak French.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.975
How do we know this?
Well, all we have to do is just

00:04:21.975 --> 00:04:25.207
wake you up.
We wake you up and we say,

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:28.040
"Hey John, what's three times
three?"

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.209
And after you stop swearing at
us, you say, "Well,

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:33.391
it's nine."
Or we say, "Linda,

00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:36.970
hey, conjugate such and such a
verb in French."

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.424
And you can conjugate it.
Even though you were not

00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:45.430
engaged in P-functioning
while you were asleep,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.332
it's still true that while you
were asleep, you had the ability

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:54.759
to engage in
P-functioning.

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:00.069
Abilities aren't always
actualized.

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.530
Your P-functioning is
actualized now,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.589
because you're engaged in
thought,

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:09.680
but you don't lose the ability
to think during those moments

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.084
when you're not thinking.
Suppose we say then that to be

00:05:15.084 --> 00:05:19.490
alive as a person is to be able
to engage in

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.634
P-functioning.
And to be dead then,

00:05:23.634 --> 00:05:27.930
is to be unable to engage in
P-functioning.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.329
Why are you unable?
Well, presumably because

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:37.323
whatever cognitive structures it
takes in your brain to

00:05:37.323 --> 00:05:41.670
underwrite the ability to
P-function,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.734
those cognitive structures have
been broken, so they no longer

00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:50.888
work.
It's--When you're dead,

00:05:50.888 --> 00:05:54.959
your brain is broken.
It's not just that you're not

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.694
engaged in P-functioning,
you're no longer able to

00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:02.090
engage in P-functioning.
That, at least,

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.139
seems to handle the case of
sleep properly.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.065
Although you're not engaged in
P-functioning,

00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:11.360
you're able to,
so you're still alive.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.550
Take the dead who will be
resurrected on Judgment Day.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.419
Although they will be engaged
in P-functioning later

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.222
on, it's not true right now that
they can engage in

00:06:23.222 --> 00:06:27.459
P-functioning.
Their bodies and brains are

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:33.329
broken until God fixes them.
So they're dead.

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:35.663
All right, that seems to give
the right answer and,

00:06:35.663 --> 00:06:38.323
in fact, it gives us some
guidance how to think about some

00:06:38.323 --> 00:06:42.580
other puzzling cases.
Take somebody who is in a coma,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.269
not engaged in
P-functioning.

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:49.779
Their body, let's stipulate,
is still alive.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.065
Their heart's still beating,
the lungs are still breathing

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:55.217
and so forth.
But we wonder,

00:06:55.217 --> 00:06:58.990
is the person still alive?
Does the person still exist?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.210
Well, they're not engaged in
P-functioning.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.589
That's pretty clear.
We want to know,

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.680
can they engage in
P-functioning?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.133
Now, at this point we'd want to
know more about the underlying

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:24.230
mechanics about what's gone on
in the case of the coma.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.839
If the following is the right
description, then we perhaps

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:32.744
should say they're still alive.
Look, when somebody's asleep,

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:37.693
we need to do something to,
in effect, wake them up,

00:07:37.693 --> 00:07:42.060
something to turn the
functioning back on.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.685
The cognitive structures are
still there, but the on-off

00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:51.252
switch is switched to off.
Perhaps that's what it's like

00:07:51.252 --> 00:07:55.296
when somebody's in a coma,
or perhaps at least certain

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:59.138
types of comas.
Of course, to turn the on-off

00:07:59.138 --> 00:08:03.139
switch on is harder when
somebody's in a coma.

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:07.560
It's a bit more--to continue
with the metaphor of the on-of

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.675
switch--as though not only is
the switch turned to off,

00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:16.646
there's a lock on the switch.
And so we can't turn the switch

00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:20.638
on in the normal way.
Pushing the person in the coma

00:08:20.638 --> 00:08:24.459
and saying, "Wake up,
Jimmy" doesn't do the trick.

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:28.483
But for all that,
although the on-off switch may

00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:32.164
be stuck in off,
if the underlying cognitive

00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:37.899
structures of the brain are such
as to still make it true that,

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:42.375
flip the on switch back to on
and the person can still engage

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:45.059
in cognitive
P-functioning,

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:49.270
maybe the right thing to say is
the person's still alive.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.112
Coma case two.
I'm not sure whether this

00:08:52.112 --> 00:08:54.621
really should be called a coma.
I don't know the biological and

00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:57.889
medical details.
But imagine that what's gone on

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:02.494
is there's been decay of the
brain structures that underwrite

00:09:02.494 --> 00:09:07.164
the cognitive functioning.
So now it's not just that the

00:09:07.164 --> 00:09:12.138
on-off switch is stuck in off,
the brain's no longer capable

00:09:12.138 --> 00:09:16.860
of engaging in these higher
order P-functions.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.495
This might be a persistent
vegetative state with no

00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:26.129
possibility of turning it on,
even in principle.

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:30.232
Of such a person we might say,
they're no longer capable of

00:09:30.232 --> 00:09:33.525
P-functioning.
And then perhaps the right

00:09:33.525 --> 00:09:36.278
thing to say is the person no
longer exists,

00:09:36.278 --> 00:09:39.801
so they no longer exist as a
person, even if the body is

00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:42.919
still alive.
So far, so good.

00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:46.639
Here's a harder case to think
about.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:53.724
Suppose we put somebody in a
state of suspended animation,

00:09:53.724 --> 00:10:01.058
cool their body down so that
the various metabolic processes

00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:06.070
come to an end.
They stop.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.185
As I'm sure you know,
we're able, with various lower

00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:12.790
organisms, to put them in a
state of suspended animation and

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.040
then,
the amazing thing is,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.061
if you heat them back up again
properly, they start functioning

00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:24.595
again.
Now, we can't do that yet with

00:10:24.595 --> 00:10:28.652
humans.
But it doesn't jump out at us,

00:10:28.652 --> 00:10:33.519
at least, that that should be
an impossibility.

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:38.440
So suppose we eventually learn
how to do this with humans.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.397
And now, suppose we take Larry
and put him in a state of

00:10:43.397 --> 00:10:47.059
suspended animation.
Is he dead?

00:10:47.059 --> 00:10:52.320
Well, most of us don't feel
comfortable saying that he's

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.026
dead.
Just like we don't feel

00:10:54.026 --> 00:10:56.774
comfortable saying that the--I
suppose we could do this with a

00:10:56.774 --> 00:10:58.276
fruit fly.
I don't know whether we can or

00:10:58.276 --> 00:10:59.879
can't.
Suppose we can.

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:01.620
Suppose we do it with a fruit
fly.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.480
We don't feel comfortable
saying the fruit fly's dead.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.629
Rather, it's in a state of
suspended animation.

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:09.315
Well, similarly then,
perhaps we wouldn't want to say

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:13.917
that Larry is dead.
And the "brokenness" account of

00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:18.570
death allows us to say Larry's
not dead.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.017
The structures in the brain
which would underwrite the

00:11:23.017 --> 00:11:26.458
ability to engage in
P-functioning,

00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:30.570
they're not destroyed by
suspended animation.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.200
So perhaps in the relevant
sense, the person can still

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.900
engage in P-functioning,
so they're not dead.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.539
Good enough.
On the other hand,

00:11:41.539 --> 00:11:46.299
it doesn't seem so plausible,
it doesn't seem intuitively

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:49.360
right, to say that they're
alive.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.970
Is Larry alive when he's in a
state of suspended animation?

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.201
No.
It seems like he's not alive

00:11:55.201 --> 00:11:56.685
either.
Now that's a bit puzzling,

00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.085
right?
It's as though we

00:11:58.085 --> 00:12:00.316
need--Normally,
we think that look,

00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:02.809
either you're alive or you're
dead.

00:12:02.809 --> 00:12:06.509
The two possibilities exhaust
the possibilities.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:11.886
But thinking about suspended
animation suggests that we may

00:12:11.886 --> 00:12:17.355
actually need a third category,
suspended--neither alive nor

00:12:17.355 --> 00:12:19.330
dead.
Well, all right,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.321
if we do introduce a third
possibility--I'm not sure this

00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.522
is the right thing.
It's not clear what's the right

00:12:26.522 --> 00:12:29.049
or best thing to say about
suspended animation.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:31.440
But at least that doesn't seem
like an unattractive

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.706
possibility.
If there are three

00:12:33.706 --> 00:12:37.787
possibilities--dead,
alive, or suspended--to be

00:12:37.787 --> 00:12:42.399
dead, we could still say you've
got to be broken,

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:44.260
incapable of
P-functioning.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.289
Suspended isn't broken.
It's just suspended.

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:56.159
But then what do you need to be
alive?

00:12:56.159 --> 00:12:59.312
In addition to not being
broken, what do you need to be

00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:01.511
alive?
Well, the initially tempting

00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:05.345
thing to say is not only aren't
you broken, but you're actually

00:13:05.345 --> 00:13:08.462
engaged in P-functioning.
But if we say that,

00:13:08.462 --> 00:13:11.318
then we're back to saying that
somebody who's asleep isn't

00:13:11.318 --> 00:13:13.870
really alive.
That doesn't seem right either.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:19.665
So we need some account to
distinguish between suspended

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:23.879
animation and out and out being
alive.

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:26.320
And I'm not quite sure how to
draw that line.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.500
So I'll leave that to you as a
puzzle to work on on your own.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.899
That puzzle aside,
it seems to me that once we

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:41.886
become physicalists,
there's nothing especially deep

00:13:41.886 --> 00:13:48.571
or mysterious about death.
The body is able to function in

00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:52.451
a variety of ways.
When some of those lower

00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:56.009
biological functions are
occurring, the body's alive.

00:13:56.009 --> 00:14:00.306
When all goes well,
the body is also capable of

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:05.630
engaging in higher order
personal P-functioning.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:10.995
And then you've got a person.
The body begins to break,

00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:13.909
you get the loss of
P-functioning.

00:14:13.909 --> 00:14:16.278
At that point,
you no longer exist as a

00:14:16.278 --> 00:14:20.034
person.
When the body breaks some more,

00:14:20.034 --> 00:14:25.600
you get the loss of biological
or B-functioning,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.134
and then the body dies.
There's nothing especially

00:14:30.134 --> 00:14:33.916
mysterious about death,
although there may be a lot of

00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:37.840
details to work out from a
scientific point of view.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.193
What are the particular
processes that underwrite

00:14:41.193 --> 00:14:45.130
biological functioning?
What are the particular

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.511
processes that underwrite
personality or person

00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:54.387
functioning?
Still, there are a couple of

00:14:54.387 --> 00:15:00.789
claims about death that get made
frequently enough,

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:04.780
about death being mysterious in
one way or another,

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.649
that I want--or special or
unique--that I want to focus on.

00:15:09.649 --> 00:15:12.827
In effect, from the physicalist
point of view,

00:15:12.827 --> 00:15:16.640
although death is unique
because it comes at the end of

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.029
this lifetime of various sorts
of functions,

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:25.519
there's nothing especially
puzzling, nothing especially

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:31.618
mysterious, nothing especially
unusual or hard to grasp about

00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:34.089
it.
But there are a handful of

00:15:34.089 --> 00:15:37.811
claims that people make about
death suggesting that they

00:15:37.811 --> 00:15:40.913
think,
and they think we all think,

00:15:40.913 --> 00:15:46.080
that death is mysterious or
unique or hard to comprehend.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.870
I want to examine a couple of
these.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.914
One of them I'll get to later;
if not later today,

00:15:50.914 --> 00:15:54.847
then next lecture.
Sometimes people say that we

00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:59.029
die alone or everybody
dies alone.

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:02.640
And this is something--This is
supposed to express some deep

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.700
insight into the nature and
uniqueness of death.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.366
So although we're able to eat
meals together,

00:16:09.366 --> 00:16:13.866
we're able to go on vacations
together and take classes

00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:17.775
together,
death is something we all have

00:16:17.775 --> 00:16:20.750
to do by ourselves.
That's the claim.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.983
We all die alone.
That's a claim I'll come back

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:27.166
to.
What I want to look at first is

00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:31.118
the suggestion that somehow,
at some level,

00:16:31.118 --> 00:16:36.200
nobody really believes they're
going to die at all.

00:16:39.539 --> 00:16:44.987
Now, having distinguished
between what we've called the

00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:49.830
death of the body and the death
of the person,

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.223
the question whether or not
you're going to die needs to be

00:16:53.223 --> 00:16:55.306
distinguished.
The question whether or not you

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.340
believe you're going to die
needs to be distinguished.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.198
If somebody says,
"You know, nobody really

00:16:59.198 --> 00:17:01.781
believes they're going to die,"
they could mean one of two

00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:04.989
things.
They could mean nobody really

00:17:04.989 --> 00:17:09.847
believes they're going to cease
to exist as a person,

00:17:09.847 --> 00:17:14.175
first possibility.
Second possible claim,

00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:20.519
nobody really believes they're
going to undergo the death of

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:25.880
their bodies.
Let's take these in turn.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.887
Is there any good reason to
believe that we don't believe

00:17:30.887 --> 00:17:35.270
that we're going to cease to
exist as a person?

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.833
Well, the most common argument
for this claim I think takes the

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:49.997
following form.
People sometimes say,

00:17:49.997 --> 00:17:54.968
since it's impossible to
picture being dead,

00:17:54.968 --> 00:17:59.940
it's impossible to picture
being dead--,

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.298
That is to say,
it's impossible to picture your

00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:04.126
own being dead.
Each one of us has to think

00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:06.286
about this from the first person
perspective or something like

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.204
that.
Think about your dying,

00:18:08.204 --> 00:18:11.970
your being dead--Since that's
impossible to picture,

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:17.193
that's impossible to imagine,
nobody believes in the

00:18:17.193 --> 00:18:21.289
possibility that they're going
to die,

00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:24.920
that they're going to cease to
exist.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:32.049
The idea seems to be that you
can't believe in possibilities

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:36.400
that you can't picture or
imagine.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.411
Now, that hypothesis,
that thesis,

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:42.970
that assumption,
could be challenged.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:47.925
I think probably we shouldn't
believe the theory of belief

00:18:47.925 --> 00:18:52.359
which says that in order to
believe in something,

00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:56.240
you've got to be able to
picture it or believe it.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.289
But let's grant that assumption
for the sake of argument.

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:06.433
Let's suppose that in order to
believe in something,

00:19:06.433 --> 00:19:08.030
you've got to be able to
picture it.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.047
What then?
How do we get from there to the

00:19:11.047 --> 00:19:15.095
conclusion that I can't believe
that I'm going to die,

00:19:15.095 --> 00:19:18.380
I'm going to cease to exist as
a person?

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.446
Well, the thought,
of course, is I can't picture

00:19:22.446 --> 00:19:26.726
or imagine my death.
I can't picture or imagine my

00:19:26.726 --> 00:19:28.690
being dead.
It's important here to draw

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.800
some distinctions.
I can certainly picture being

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.964
ill.
There I am on my deathbed dying

00:19:35.964 --> 00:19:39.119
of cancer, growing weaker and
weaker.

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:44.269
I can perhaps even picture the
moment of my death.

00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:47.950
I've said goodbye to my family
and friends.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.849
I've the--Everything's growing
greyer and dimmer.

00:19:51.849 --> 00:19:55.440
It's growing harder and harder
to concentrate.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.256
And then, well,
and then there is no "and

00:19:58.256 --> 00:19:59.931
more."
The claim, however,

00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:02.740
is not that I can't picture
being ill or dying.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:08.652
The claim's got to be,
I can't picture being

00:20:08.652 --> 00:20:10.450
dead.
Well, try it.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:17.299
Try to picture being dead.
What's it like to be dead?

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:21.799
Sometimes people claim it's a
mystery.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:26.551
We don't know what it's like to
be dead, because every time we

00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:28.810
try to imagine it,
we fail.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:35.941
We don't do a very good job.
I'm inclined to think that that

00:20:35.941 --> 00:20:41.089
way of thinking about the
question is really confused.

00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:46.667
You set yourself the goal of
trying to put yourself in the

00:20:46.667 --> 00:20:52.049
situation imaginatively of what
it's like to be dead.

00:20:52.049 --> 00:20:57.387
So I start by trying to strip
off the parts of my conscious

00:20:57.387 --> 00:21:01.620
life that I know I won't have
when I'm dead.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.890
I won't hear anything.
I won't see anything.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:11.490
I won't think anything.
And you try to imagine what

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:18.089
it's like to not think or feel
or hear or see.

00:21:18.089 --> 00:21:20.460
And you don't do a very good
job of it.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.024
So you throw your hands up and
you say, "Oh,

00:21:23.024 --> 00:21:25.350
I guess I don't know what it's
like."

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:30.900
So it must be a mystery.
It's not a mystery at all.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:36.808
Suppose I ask,
"What's it like to be this cell

00:21:36.808 --> 00:21:39.273
phone?"
The answer is,

00:21:39.273 --> 00:21:44.409
"It's not like anything," where
that doesn't mean there's

00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:48.720
something that it's like to be a
cell phone,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.590
but different from being
anything else.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.621
So it's not like anything else;
it's a special way of

00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:59.660
feeling or experiencing.
No.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:04.460
Cell phones don't have any
experience at all.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:10.400
There is nothing that
it's like on the inside to be a

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.099
cell phone.
Imagine that I try to ask

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:15.880
myself, "What's it like to be my
ball point pen?"

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.713
And I try to imagine,
well, first,

00:22:17.713 --> 00:22:19.601
imagine being really,
really stiff,

00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:22.990
because you're not flexible
when you're a ball point pen.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.524
You can't move.
And imagine being really,

00:22:25.524 --> 00:22:27.885
really bored,
because you don't have any

00:22:27.885 --> 00:22:30.089
thoughts or interests.
No.

00:22:30.089 --> 00:22:35.747
That's completely the wrong way
to go about thinking what it's

00:22:35.747 --> 00:22:40.477
like to be a ball point pen.
There's nothing that

00:22:40.477 --> 00:22:42.930
it's like to be a ball point
pen.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:48.099
There's nothing to describe,
nothing to imagine.

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:54.279
No mystery about what it's like
to be a ball point pen.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:59.730
No mystery about what it's like
to be a cell phone.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.762
Well, similarly then,
I put it to you,

00:23:03.762 --> 00:23:09.540
there's no mystery about what
it's like to be dead.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.935
It isn't like anything.
What I don't mean,

00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:16.142
"Oh, it's like something,
but different from everything

00:23:16.142 --> 00:23:19.621
else."
I mean, there is nothing there

00:23:19.621 --> 00:23:22.937
to describe.
When you're dead,

00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:29.420
there's nothing happening on
the inside to be imagined.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:35.152
Well, should we conclude
therefore, given that we've got

00:23:35.152 --> 00:23:40.779
the premise, "If you can't
picture it or imagine it,

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:43.839
then you can't believe in it,"
since I've just said,

00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:46.059
look, you can't imagine being
dead,

00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:48.777
but that's not due to any
failure of imagination,

00:23:48.777 --> 00:23:52.230
that's because there's nothing
there to imagine or picture.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.094
Still, granted the premise,
if you can't picture it or

00:23:55.094 --> 00:23:58.230
imagine it, you can't believe in
it--Should we conclude,

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:04.190
therefore, that you can't
believe you're going to be dead?

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.759
No.
We shouldn't conclude that.

00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:13.748
After all, not only is it true
that you can't picture from the

00:24:13.748 --> 00:24:16.609
inside what it's like to be
dead,

00:24:16.609 --> 00:24:22.548
you can't picture from the
inside what it's like to be in

00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:27.201
dreamless sleep.
There is nothing that it's like

00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:31.053
to be in dreamless sleep.
When you're in dreamless sleep,

00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:34.349
you're not imagining or
experiencing anything.

00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:39.395
Similarly, it's not possible to
picture or imagine what it's

00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:44.012
like to have fainted and be
completely unconscious with

00:24:44.012 --> 00:24:46.920
nothing happening cognitively.

00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:51.769
There's nothing to picture or
imagine.

00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:55.493
Well, should we conclude,
therefore, so nobody really

00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:58.930
believes that they're ever in
dreamless sleep?

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.700
Well, that would be silly.
Of course you believe that at

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.661
times you're in dreamless sleep.
Should we say of somebody who's

00:25:06.661 --> 00:25:09.645
fainted or knows that they're
subject to fainting spells,

00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:12.310
they never actually believe
that they pass out?

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:17.299
That would be silly.
Of course, they believe they

00:25:17.299 --> 00:25:20.776
pass out.
From the mere fact that they

00:25:20.776 --> 00:25:25.033
can't picture it from the
inside, it doesn't follow that

00:25:25.033 --> 00:25:28.980
nobody believes they're ever in
dreamless sleep.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.435
From the mere fact that they
can't picture from the inside

00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:35.710
what it's like to have fainted
and not yet woken up,

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.660
it doesn't mean that nobody
believes that they ever faint.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:44.649
From the mere fact that you
can't picture from the inside

00:25:44.649 --> 00:25:49.550
what it's like to be dead,
it doesn't follow that nobody

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.980
believes they're going to die.
But didn't I start off by

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.117
saying I was going to grant the
person who is making this

00:25:57.117 --> 00:25:59.750
argument that in order to
believe something,

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.569
you've got to be able to
picture it?

00:26:01.569 --> 00:26:05.123
And haven't I just said,
"Look, you can't picture being

00:26:05.123 --> 00:26:07.029
dead"?
So aren't I taking it back?

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:09.489
Since I say you can believe
you're going to die,

00:26:09.489 --> 00:26:11.740
yet you can't picture it from
the inside.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.981
Haven't I taken back the
assumption that in order to

00:26:13.981 --> 00:26:16.180
believe it, you've got to be
able to picture it?

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.995
Not quite.
Although I am skeptical about

00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:21.719
that claim, I am going to
continue giving it to the person

00:26:21.719 --> 00:26:25.173
who makes this argument,
because I'm not so prepared to

00:26:25.173 --> 00:26:28.130
admit that you can't picture
being dead.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.859
You can picture being dead,
all right.

00:26:30.859 --> 00:26:36.490
You just can't picture it from
the inside.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.349
You can picture it from the
outside.

00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:45.450
I can picture being in
dreamless sleep quite easily.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.102
I'm doing it right now.
I've got a little mental image

00:26:50.102 --> 00:26:54.980
of my body lying in bed asleep,
dreamlessly.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.435
I can picture fainting,
or having fainted,

00:26:58.435 --> 00:27:02.768
quite easily.
Picture my body lying on the

00:27:02.768 --> 00:27:09.102
ground unconscious.
I can picture my being dead

00:27:09.102 --> 00:27:15.059
quite easily.
It's a little mental picture of

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:20.948
my body in a coffin.
No functioning occurring in my

00:27:20.948 --> 00:27:23.736
body.
So even if it were true that

00:27:23.736 --> 00:27:27.988
belief requires picturing,
and even if were true that you

00:27:27.988 --> 00:27:31.329
can't picture being dead from
the inside,

00:27:31.329 --> 00:27:34.644
it wouldn't follow that you
can't believe you're going to

00:27:34.644 --> 00:27:37.360
die.
All you have to do is picture

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.690
it from the outside.
We're done.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:45.590
So I conclude,
of course you can and do

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:50.615
believe you're going to die.
But at this point,

00:27:50.615 --> 00:27:54.210
the person making the argument
has a possible response.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.569
And it's a quite common
response.

00:27:56.569 --> 00:27:59.209
He says, "Look,
I try to picture the

00:27:59.209 --> 00:28:03.356
world--admittedly from the
outside--I try to picture the

00:28:03.356 --> 00:28:07.730
world in which I don't exist,
I'm no longer conscious.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.654
I'm no longer a person,
no longer experiencing

00:28:10.654 --> 00:28:12.630
anything.
I try to picture that world.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.720
I picture, for example,
seeing my funeral.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:25.270
And yet, when I try to do that,
I'm observing it.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:31.870
I'm watching the funeral.
I'm seeing the funeral.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:36.504
Consequently, I'm thinking.
So I haven't really imagined

00:28:36.504 --> 00:28:41.867
the world in which I no longer
exist, a world in which I'm

00:28:41.867 --> 00:28:45.009
dead,
a world in which I'm incapable

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:50.975
of thought and observation.
I've smuggled myself back in as

00:28:50.975 --> 00:28:57.508
the observer of the funeral."
Every time I try to picture

00:28:57.508 --> 00:29:02.157
myself being dead,
I smuggle myself back in,

00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:06.589
conscious and existing as a
person, hence,

00:29:06.589 --> 00:29:12.723
not dead as a person.
Maybe my body--I'm imagining my

00:29:12.723 --> 00:29:18.192
body dead, but I'm not imagining
myself, the person,

00:29:18.192 --> 00:29:21.087
dead.
From which it follows,

00:29:21.087 --> 00:29:25.255
the argument goes,
that I don't really believe

00:29:25.255 --> 00:29:29.763
I'll ever be dead.
Because when I try to imagine a

00:29:29.763 --> 00:29:33.980
world in which I'm dead,
I smuggle myself back in.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.519
This argument shows up in
various places.

00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:43.413
Let me mention,
let me quote one case of it,

00:29:43.413 --> 00:29:45.722
Freud.
Freud says, this is,

00:29:45.722 --> 00:29:48.936
I'm quoting from one of the
Walter Kaufman essays that

00:29:48.936 --> 00:29:51.180
you'll be reading,
called "Death."

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.529
He quotes Freud.
Freud says, 

00:29:53.529 --> 00:29:56.954
After all,
one's own death is beyond

00:29:56.954 --> 00:30:02.133
imagining, and whenever we try
to imagine it we can see that we

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:07.264
really survive as spectators.
Thus, the dictum could be dared

00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:11.707
in the psychoanalytic school:
at bottom, nobody believes in

00:30:11.707 --> 00:30:14.992
his own death.
Or, and this is the same:

00:30:14.992 --> 00:30:18.957
in his unconscious,
every one of us is convinced of

00:30:18.957 --> 00:30:23.349
his immortality.
All right, there's Freud.

00:30:23.349 --> 00:30:26.068
Basically, just running the
argument I've just sketched for

00:30:26.068 --> 00:30:28.672
you.
When you try to imagine your

00:30:28.672 --> 00:30:33.400
being dead, you smuggle yourself
back in as a spectator.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.912
And so, Freud concludes,
at some level none of us really

00:30:38.912 --> 00:30:43.747
believes we're going to die.
I want to say,

00:30:43.747 --> 00:30:49.619
I think that argument's a
horrible argument.

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:54.866
How many of you believe that
there are meetings that take

00:30:54.866 --> 00:30:59.132
place without you?
Suppose you're a member of some

00:30:59.132 --> 00:31:03.531
club and there's a meeting this
afternoon and you won't be

00:31:03.531 --> 00:31:07.390
there, because you've got to be
someplace else.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.959
So you ask yourself,
"Do I believe that meeting's

00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:12.943
going to take place without me?"
At first glance,

00:31:12.943 --> 00:31:16.142
it looks like you do,
but here's the Freudian

00:31:16.142 --> 00:31:19.049
argument that shows you don't
really.

00:31:19.049 --> 00:31:23.295
Try to imagine,
try to picture that meeting

00:31:23.295 --> 00:31:26.696
without you.
Well, when you do picture it,

00:31:26.696 --> 00:31:29.299
there's that room in your
mind's eye.

00:31:29.299 --> 00:31:32.086
You've got a little picture of
people sitting around the table

00:31:32.086 --> 00:31:34.279
perhaps, discussing the business
of your club.

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:43.500
Uh-oh, I've smuggled myself in
as a spectator.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.784
If, like you--,
I think most of us picture

00:31:46.784 --> 00:31:50.949
these things up from a
perspective in a corner of the

00:31:50.949 --> 00:31:53.503
room,
up on the wall,

00:31:53.503 --> 00:31:58.759
looking down,
kind of a fly's perspective.

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:01.490
All right, I've smuggled myself
in as a spectator.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.029
I'm actually in the room after
all.

00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:07.260
So I haven't really pictured
the meeting taking place without

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.121
me.
So I guess I don't really

00:32:09.121 --> 00:32:12.559
believe the meeting's going to
take place without me.

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.772
If Freud's argument for death,
that is to say,

00:32:14.772 --> 00:32:16.740
none of us believe we're going
to die,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.660
was any good,
the argument that none of us

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:24.218
believe meetings ever take place
without us would have to work as

00:32:24.218 --> 00:32:26.410
well.
But that's silly.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.544
It's clear that we all do
believe in the possibility,

00:32:30.544 --> 00:32:34.757
indeed, more than a mere
possibility, the actuality of

00:32:34.757 --> 00:32:41.135
meetings that occur without us.
Even though when I imagine that

00:32:41.135 --> 00:32:47.167
meeting, I'm in some sense,
smuggling myself in as an

00:32:47.167 --> 00:32:51.047
observer.
From which I think it follows

00:32:51.047 --> 00:32:55.507
that the mere fact that I've
smuggled myself in as an

00:32:55.507 --> 00:33:00.224
observer doesn't mean that I
don't really believe in the

00:33:00.224 --> 00:33:04.769
possibility that I'm observing
in my mind's eye.

00:33:04.769 --> 00:33:09.018
I can believe in the existence
of a meeting that takes place,

00:33:09.018 --> 00:33:13.266
even though I smuggle myself in
as an observer when I picture

00:33:13.266 --> 00:33:16.237
that meeting.
I can believe in the

00:33:16.237 --> 00:33:21.715
possibility of a world without
me, even though I smuggle myself

00:33:21.715 --> 00:33:26.839
in as an observer when I picture
that world without me.

00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:29.984
Freud's mistake,
and it's--although I'm picking

00:33:29.984 --> 00:33:34.359
on Freud, it's not only Freud
that runs this sort of argument.

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:36.470
One comes across it
periodically.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.342
Within the last year,
a member of our law school here

00:33:40.342 --> 00:33:44.661
put forward this very argument
and said he thought it was a

00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:46.829
good one.
So people think the argument's

00:33:46.829 --> 00:33:49.221
a good one.
It strikes me as it's got to be

00:33:49.221 --> 00:33:50.955
a bad one.
The confusion,

00:33:50.955 --> 00:33:55.177
the mistake I think people are
making when they make this

00:33:55.177 --> 00:33:59.400
argument, the mistake I think
they're making is this.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.652
It's one thing to ask yourself,
what's the content of the

00:34:04.652 --> 00:34:07.258
picture?
It's another thing to ask,

00:34:07.258 --> 00:34:10.340
when you look at the picture,
are you existing?

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.940
Are you looking at the picture
from a certain point of view?

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:20.000
Suppose I hold up a photograph
of a beach with nobody on it.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.200
All right, am I in that beach,
as pictured in that photograph?

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.689
Of course not.
But as I look at it,

00:34:28.689 --> 00:34:33.894
whether in reality or in my
mind's eye, I'm looking at it

00:34:33.894 --> 00:34:37.995
from a perspective.
As I think about it,

00:34:37.995 --> 00:34:44.060
I'm viewing the beach from a
point of view which may well be

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:48.583
on the beach,
if somebody draws a painting of

00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:51.429
a beach.
But for all that,

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:56.224
that doesn't mean that within
the picture of the beach,

00:34:56.224 --> 00:35:00.724
I'm in the beach.
Looking at a picture doesn't

00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:04.130
mean you're in the
picture.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.327
Viewing the meeting from a
point of view,

00:35:08.327 --> 00:35:12.210
doesn't mean you're in the
meeting.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:17.251
Viewing the world without you
from a point of view,

00:35:17.251 --> 00:35:20.780
doesn't mean you're in the
world.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.605
So although of course it's
true, when I imagine these

00:35:24.605 --> 00:35:29.020
various possibilities without
me, I'm thinking about them.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.732
I'm observing them.
And I'm observing them from a

00:35:32.732 --> 00:35:36.739
particular perspective,
from a particular standpoint.

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:41.032
For all that,
I'm not in the picture

00:35:41.032 --> 00:35:46.141
that I'm thinking about.
So I think the Freudian

00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:51.801
argument just fails.
Now, maybe there's some other

00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:59.234
reason to believe the claim that
nobody believes they will cease

00:35:59.234 --> 00:36:02.431
to exist.
But if there is another

00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:05.917
argument for that claim,
I'm eager to hear it,

00:36:05.917 --> 00:36:08.551
because this argument,
at any rate,

00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:12.367
seems to me to be unsuccessful.
Now, at the start,

00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:15.562
I distinguished two claims
people might have in mind when

00:36:15.562 --> 00:36:18.530
they say, "Nobody believes
they're going to die."

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.541
The first possibility was the
claim was, nobody believes that

00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:25.349
they'll ever cease to exist as a
person.

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:30.127
And I've just explained why at
least the most familiar argument

00:36:30.127 --> 00:36:33.210
for that claim,
I think, doesn't work.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.570
The second possible
interpretation was this.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.639
Nobody believes their body is
going to die.

00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:44.283
That is, the more familiar
humdrum event of death where

00:36:44.283 --> 00:36:48.533
your body ceases functioning and
you end up having a corpse that

00:36:48.533 --> 00:36:52.929
gets buried and so forth.
Sometimes it's suggested that

00:36:52.929 --> 00:36:56.219
nobody believes that either.
Of course, often,

00:36:56.219 --> 00:36:58.719
I think, people run together
these two questions.

00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:00.872
When they say you don't believe
you're going to die,

00:37:00.872 --> 00:37:02.602
do you mean,
you don't believe your body's

00:37:02.602 --> 00:37:05.074
going to die?
or you don't believe you're

00:37:05.074 --> 00:37:07.480
going to cease to exist as a
person?

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.009
Maybe when people make the
claim, it's not clear which of

00:37:10.009 --> 00:37:11.590
these things they've got in
mind.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.967
But let's, at least,
try to now focus on the second

00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:17.093
question.
Could it be true,

00:37:17.093 --> 00:37:20.835
is there any good reason to
believe it is true,

00:37:20.835 --> 00:37:25.880
that nobody believes they're
going to undergo bodily death?

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.059
Now, after all,
even if you believe that,

00:37:29.059 --> 00:37:33.351
well, your soul will go to
heaven so you won't cease to

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:37.386
exist as a person,
you might still believe that

00:37:37.386 --> 00:37:40.165
your body will die.
Most of us presumably do

00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:43.692
believe our bodies will die.
At least, that's how it seems

00:37:43.692 --> 00:37:45.954
to me.
So it's a bit odd to suggest,

00:37:45.954 --> 00:37:48.660
as it nonetheless does get
suggested, that no,

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.366
no, at some level,
people don't really believe

00:37:51.366 --> 00:37:56.164
they're going to die.
Let me point out just how odd a

00:37:56.164 --> 00:38:00.250
claim that is.
Because people do all sorts of

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:05.123
behaviors which become very,
very hard to interpret if they

00:38:05.123 --> 00:38:09.659
don't really believe their
bodies are going to die.

00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:13.763
People, for example,
take out life insurance so

00:38:13.763 --> 00:38:18.579
that--well, here's what seems to
be the explanation.

00:38:18.579 --> 00:38:21.466
They believe that there's a
decent chance that they will die

00:38:21.466 --> 00:38:24.657
within a certain period of time.
And so, if that happens,

00:38:24.657 --> 00:38:28.539
they want their children and
family members to be cared for.

00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:32.002
If you didn't really believe
you were going to die,

00:38:32.002 --> 00:38:35.880
that is undergo bodily death,
why would you take out life

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.079
insurance?
People write wills.

00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:42.550
"Here's what you should do with
my estate after I die."

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.656
If you didn't really believe
that your body was going to die,

00:38:46.656 --> 00:38:49.599
why would you ever bother
writing a will?

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:53.650
Since many people write wills,
many people take out life

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:58.068
insurance, it seems as though
the natural thing to suggest is

00:38:58.068 --> 00:39:00.718
that many,
or at least perhaps most,

00:39:00.718 --> 00:39:04.020
at least many people believe
they're going to die.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:09.881
Why would we think otherwise?
Well, the reason for thinking

00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:13.312
otherwise, the reason for not
being utterly dismissive of this

00:39:13.312 --> 00:39:17.012
suggestion,
is that when people get ill,

00:39:17.012 --> 00:39:21.692
terminally ill,
it often seems to take them by

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:25.418
surprise.
So I've been having you read

00:39:25.418 --> 00:39:28.780
Tolstoy's novella,
The Death of Ivan

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.894
Ilyich.
Ivan Ilyich falls,

00:39:31.894 --> 00:39:36.280
he hurts himself.
The injury doesn't get better.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.630
He gets worse and worse and
eventually it kills him.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:48.197
The astonishing thing is that
Ivan Ilyich is shocked to

00:39:48.197 --> 00:39:54.013
discover that he's mortal.
And of course,

00:39:54.013 --> 00:39:57.935
what Tolstoy is trying to
convince us of,

00:39:57.935 --> 00:40:03.675
what he's trying to argue,
by illustrating the claim,

00:40:03.675 --> 00:40:09.913
I take it, that Tolstoy is
making, is that most of us are

00:40:09.913 --> 00:40:16.277
actually in Ivan Ilyich's boat.
We give lip service to the

00:40:16.277 --> 00:40:21.035
claim that we're going to die,
but at some level,

00:40:21.035 --> 00:40:25.067
we don't really believe it.
And notice again,

00:40:25.067 --> 00:40:28.489
just to emphasize the point,
the relevant lack of belief

00:40:28.489 --> 00:40:31.289
here has to do with the death of
the body.

00:40:31.289 --> 00:40:34.110
That's the thing that Ivan
Ilyich is skeptical about.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:38.300
Is his body going to die?
Is he mortal in that sense?

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:44.730
This is what takes him aback,
to discover that he's mortal.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.665
For all we know,
Ivan Ilyich still believes in

00:40:46.665 --> 00:40:49.159
souls, believes he's going to go
to heaven and so forth.

00:40:49.159 --> 00:40:54.000
So it's not his death as a
person that he's puzzled by.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.019
He may not think he's going to
die as a person.

00:40:56.019 --> 00:40:59.902
It's his bodily death that
surprises him,

00:40:59.902 --> 00:41:03.980
his bodily mortality that
surprises him.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:08.943
Tolstoy draws a highly
realistic and believable

00:41:08.943 --> 00:41:15.202
portrait of somebody who is
surprised to discover that he's

00:41:15.202 --> 00:41:17.301
mortal.
As he puts it,

00:41:17.301 --> 00:41:21.077
there's a famous syllogism that
people learn in their logic

00:41:21.077 --> 00:41:24.900
classes from Aristotle.
All men are mortal.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.019
Socrates is a man,
so Socrates is mortal.

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:31.909
Ivan Ilyich says,
"Yes, yes, I knew that.

00:41:31.909 --> 00:41:36.840
But what did that have to do
with me?"

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.880
Well, it may be a kind of
irrationality.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.730
It may be a kind of failure to
conduct the logic.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:49.218
But we're not asking,
is it rational or irrational to

00:41:49.218 --> 00:41:52.170
not believe that your body's
going to die,

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:56.090
we're simply asking,
noting the fact that,

00:41:56.090 --> 00:42:02.114
there to seem to be cases where
people are surprised to discover

00:42:02.114 --> 00:42:06.052
that they're mortal.
Now, for all that,

00:42:06.052 --> 00:42:10.340
notice, I presume that Ivan
Ilyich had a will.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.000
And for all I know,
Ivan Ilyich had life insurance.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.376
So we're in the peculiar
situation where on the one hand,

00:42:18.376 --> 00:42:23.300
some of Ivan Ilyich's behaviors
indicate that he believed he was

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.500
mortal,
that his body was going to die.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:32.427
And yet, the shock and surprise
that faces, that overcomes him

00:42:32.427 --> 00:42:36.800
when he actually has to face his
mortality,

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.329
strongly suggests that he's
reporting correctly.

00:42:40.329 --> 00:42:44.220
He didn't believe he was going
to die.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.814
How could that be?
There's a kind of puzzle there

00:42:47.814 --> 00:42:50.566
as to--even if,
before we move to the question,

00:42:50.566 --> 00:42:52.840
how widespread are cases like
this?

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:59.800
there's a puzzle as to how are
we even to understand this case?

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:04.083
We need to distinguish perhaps
between what he consciously

00:43:04.083 --> 00:43:07.539
believes and what he
unconsciously believes.

00:43:07.539 --> 00:43:10.975
Maybe at the conscious level he
believed he was mortal,

00:43:10.975 --> 00:43:14.730
but at the unconscious level he
believed he was immortal.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:18.760
Or maybe we need to distinguish
between those things he gives a

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.074
kind of lip service to,
versus those things he truly

00:43:22.074 --> 00:43:25.500
and fundamentally believes.
Maybe he gives lip service to

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.733
the claim that he was mortal.
If you would have asked him

00:43:27.733 --> 00:43:29.060
"Are you mortal?"
he would have said "Oh,

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.253
of course I am."
And he buys life insurance

00:43:31.253 --> 00:43:33.961
accordingly.
But does he thoroughly and

00:43:33.961 --> 00:43:37.270
truly and fundamentally believe
he's mortal?

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:41.438
Perhaps not.
We need some such distinction

00:43:41.438 --> 00:43:44.880
if we're going to make sense of
Ivan Ilyich.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.090
Well, let's suppose we've done
it.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.245
Still have to ask,
not, are there are ever cases

00:43:50.245 --> 00:43:53.670
of people who don't believe
they're going to die?

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.781
but rather, is there any good
reason to think that we're all

00:43:57.781 --> 00:44:00.429
or most of us are in that
situation,

00:44:00.429 --> 00:44:03.327
are in that state of belief
where, although we give lip

00:44:03.327 --> 00:44:05.849
service to the claim that we're
going to die,

00:44:05.849 --> 00:44:09.423
is there any good reason to
believe that fundamentally we

00:44:09.423 --> 00:44:13.530
don't actually believe it?
That's the question we have to

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:14.796
turn to next time.

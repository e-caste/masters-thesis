00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.290
Prof: So today we're
going to engage Modernism.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.439
We're going to be talking
principally about the music of

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.470
Igor Stravinsky.
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.460
I should also mention Arnold
Schoenberg.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.316
Just as Verdi and Wagner were
the principal composers of opera

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:20.097
in the nineteenth century,
so Schoenberg and Stravinsky

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.987
were the principal proponents--
not only of instrumental music,

00:00:23.987 --> 00:00:26.647
but some vocal music--
in the first half of the

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:27.810
twentieth century.
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.974
So we want to keep them
carefully positioned on our

00:00:30.974 --> 00:00:32.240
radar screen here.
 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.954
Igor Stravinsky,
of course, was a Russian

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:36.379
composer, born in St.
 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.330
Petersburg.
 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.410
You have the dates up there on
the board, I'm sure.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.340
He studied with Nikolai
Rimsky-Korsakov,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.540
who wrote one famous piece,
Scheherazade--

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.130
which I used to hear all the
time as a kid--

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.570
and then caught the eye of
Sergei Diaghilev.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.180
Serge Diaghilev was an
impresario.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.920
What's an impresario?
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.350
Who can tell me what an
impresario is?

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.049
It's a fancy word for--Thaddeus.
 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.629
Student: A producer.
 

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:06.920
Prof: A producer. Okay.
 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.200
Think of the Broadway show
"The Producers."

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.828
He's simply a producer.
 

00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:16.695
And what Diaghilev was
producing and importing into

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:21.659
Paris from Russia was Modernist
art from Russia--

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.330
Modernist painting,
Modernist ballet,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.239
Modernist art music,
and Modernist opera.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:31.331
So that's what we want to keep
in mind with regard to Sergei

00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:31.959
Diaghilev.
 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.180
And for Diaghilev,
Stravinsky composed,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.700
early in his career,
three important ballet scores,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.285
and you have those titles up on
the board there:

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:43.727
Firebird with its date--
what?

00:01:43.727 --> 00:01:50.263
1909--Petrushka,
1911, and then The Rite of

00:01:50.263 --> 00:01:53.030
Spring in 1913.
 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.235
Now, the first of these ballets
to really show a heavy Modernist

00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:02.365
content is not so much
Firebird but more the

00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:06.159
second of this troika here,
Petrushka.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.639
It's modern because of the new
approach to rhythm.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.536
In the Romantic music that we
have been listening to,

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:18.507
we would hear these long,
somewhat amorphous melodies,

00:02:18.507 --> 00:02:21.280
amorphous in terms of the
rhythm.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.598
But now here with the advent of
Modernism in the twentieth

00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:29.538
century we get a much more
driving type of rhythm.

00:02:29.538 --> 00:02:32.601
It almost in some ways goes
back to the driving rhythms of

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:35.180
the Baroque except with one
major difference,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.830
and that is that these modern
rhythms are highly irregular.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.740
What we get oftentimes are
irregular meters.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.240
What would you imagine an
irregular meter is?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.050
Anyone want to field that one,
irregular meters?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.036
Well, simply said,
it's not a succession of

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:53.637
two-four,
two-four, two-four,

00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:56.146
two-four or three-four,
three-four, but two-four,

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:58.123
five-four,
four-four, two-four,

00:02:58.123 --> 00:03:00.240
six-four, three-eight,
and so on.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.348
Each measure can have a
different meter.

00:03:03.348 --> 00:03:05.252
In addition,
we also have this phenomenon

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:08.201
called polymeters in which you
could assign to your clarinet to

00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:11.199
play in three- four and your
bassoon to play in four-four,

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.878
and maybe your violins in
seven-eight.

00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:16.465
So as a result,
you get something of a

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:21.990
disjunctive, rhythmic texture
here, disjointed rhythms.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.798
And the second aspect of this
approach to Modernism has

00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:30.449
something to do with the
orchestration.

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.279
There's a great deal more
emphasis now on percussive

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:35.030
effects.
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.549
New instruments are added to
the orchestra,

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.739
instruments called the
xylophone, the glockenspiel,

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.080
the celesta.
 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.651
And if you want to see a
picture of some of these you

00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:48.729
could open your textbook at some
point--

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.508
just write this in your
notes--see figure--

00:03:51.508 --> 00:03:54.370
I think I wrote it down
here--figure ten--

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.224
no, excuse me--five,
number ten, chapter five,

00:03:57.224 --> 00:03:58.050
number ten.
 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.598
You can see some of these
percussion instruments,

00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:03.343
but basically they're just
either sticks or pieces of metal

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:08.247
bars that you beat with sticks,
or, in the case of the celesta,

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:10.870
you activate with a keyboard.
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.670
So we've got these two things
here: driving but irregular

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.879
rhythms and we also have this
new approach to orchestration.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:23.317
So let's listen to a bit now of
Igor Stravinsky's ballet of

00:04:23.317 --> 00:04:25.230
1911, Petrushka.
 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:34.360
&gt;
 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.579
Can you conduct this?
 

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:59.199
&gt;
 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.600
Jacob and I were fooling around
with this in the background,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.500
trying to figure out what these
meters were,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.680
see if we could pick up these
different changes,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.050
but they are as--and how'd we
do?

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.069
Not well.
 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.639
Jacob says we did not do well.
 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.855
Because without the score,
it's difficult to anticipate

00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:17.000
which meter is going to come
next.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.480
And you heard the intense
percussive effects there.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.084
But Stravinsky's most radical
statement of Modernism occurs

00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:26.074
not here in
"Petrushka"

00:05:26.074 --> 00:05:29.370
but two years later in The
Rite of Spring.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.036
It premiered in Paris in May of
1913, and it's become something

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:39.514
of a cultural icon,
this whole idea of the Rite

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:41.160
of Spring.
 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.535
Indeed I have this book,
and I've had it for quite a

00:05:44.535 --> 00:05:47.910
while, Rites of Spring by
Modris Eksteins.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.045
It's often required reading in
the history department here,

00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:52.019
history program.
 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.869
Has anybody ever run into this,
been asked to read anything by

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:55.709
Modris Eksteins?
 

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:59.245
Well, the subtitle is here:
The Great War and the Birth

00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:02.437
of the Modern Age,
but it's not accidental

00:06:02.437 --> 00:06:06.281
that he is playing off of this
title of a ballet of Igor

00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:08.651
Stravinsky,
because the ballet of

00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:10.980
Stravinsky was a kind of
watershed,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.569
a touchstone,
the benchmark from which

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.807
Modernism can be calculated and
against which it can be

00:06:19.807 --> 00:06:21.069
measured.
 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.625
So when the audience arrived
there at the Theatre

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:29.019
Champs-Elysees in Paris--and
that theatre still is there.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:32.940
You can walk down the Avenue
Montagne--it's where Hermes is

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.779
and Gucci and all of these fancy
stores;

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.649
it's there in Paris--and go in
and still hear concerts there.

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.016
I've heard concerts in the
Theatre Champs-Elysees so

00:06:41.016 --> 00:06:42.240
you can still do that today.
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.202
It's still functioning.
 

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.129
It's one of the major concert
halls in Paris.

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.389
So, in any event,
May 1913, the audience arrives.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.940
They are there to hear a
Russian ballet.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.170
What kind of music do they
expect to hear?

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.009
Well, let's listen to what they
were expecting to hear.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:03.160
&gt;
 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.350
So whose music is this?
 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.040
Student: Tchaikovsky.
 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.319
Prof: Tchaikovsky.
 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.740
Anybody--Leah,
you know the title of it?

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.946
"Swan Lake,"
so lots of tutus and pas de

00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:16.290
deux up there and moving
around.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.600
So this is what they thought
Russian ballet was.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.879
So they arrive and take their
seats.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.569
The lights go down.
 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.956
Everybody is properly dressed
for this particular occasion and

00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:36.050
here is the kind of music that
they hear.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:57.790
&gt;
 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.009
So that's a radically new
sound, a radically new approach

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:04.490
to modern art,
and indeed, once again,

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.697
if you ask,
generally, cultural historians

00:08:06.697 --> 00:08:09.398
to put their finger on the
moment that constitutes the

00:08:09.398 --> 00:08:12.505
beginning of Modernism it would
probably be this moment of the

00:08:12.505 --> 00:08:14.850
performance of The Rite of
Spring.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.689
How did Stravinsky create these
radically new sounds?

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:21.139
Well, he did so in a couple of
ways.

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:28.420
We've been talking before about
this idea of irregular meters.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.410
Let's see how these play out.
 

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.120
The music that you were just
listening to--

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.879
not the pitches but the
durations--are up here on the

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:37.395
board,
and they're all,

00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:39.129
as you can see,
quarter notes,

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:41.539
but they are grouped in
different sorts of ways,

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.928
grouped by these accents.
 

00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:46.788
So I've asked Jacob--Jacob's up
here--to grab his viola now.

00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:49.903
He's going to come over and
play the sequence for us

00:08:49.903 --> 00:08:53.017
following the accents,
and then he will be joined by

00:08:53.017 --> 00:08:54.299
our guest artist.
 

00:08:54.299 --> 00:09:00.740
 
 

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:08.909
&gt;
 

00:09:08.909 --> 00:09:12.178
Okay. So that's the way it goes.
 

00:09:12.178 --> 00:09:14.701
That's all the violin--or the
violist or violinist,

00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:15.759
all the strings do.
 

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:17.788
Let's do that one more time
with our guest artist.

00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:20.210
We're going to add percussion
now.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:36.990
&gt;
 

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.629
Ah, what a virtuoso duo.
 

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:40.200
&gt;
 

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.320
Okay.
 

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.980
So that was--Jacob,
don't go away completely here.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.857
One other point:
watch Jacob's hand when he is

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:52.690
doing this.
 

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.070
This is not the way string
players normally play.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.453
He's doing something
extraordinary here and it tells

00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:03.150
us--we don't hear--when you play
Tchaikovsky

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.956
&gt;
 

00:10:04.956 --> 00:10:08.740
, but that ain't what he's
playing now.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.460
&gt;
 

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.490
Okay. So what's he doing?
 

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.720
He's playing all with--
Student: Down bows.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.354
Prof: Down bows,
everything down bow,

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:26.509
and that's counterintuitive to
your normal string teaching.

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:29.509
So we've taken these string
instruments and instead of using

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:32.846
them as these warm,
vibrato-filled communicators

00:10:32.846 --> 00:10:35.267
we're--
in the string family we're sort

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:38.149
of turning them in now to
percussion instruments.

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:39.379
That's a very percussive effect.
 

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:43.158
So not only do we have new
percussion instruments;

00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:47.360
we have percussive effects with
the existing instruments.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.996
And perhaps most important here
is the chord,

00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:55.129
the music that Stravinsky is
setting forth here.

00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:57.059
It's an odd chord.
 

00:10:57.059 --> 00:10:58.600
It's an odd occurrence.
 

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.486
What he's got here is a
perfectly innocuous E major

00:11:02.486 --> 00:11:03.110
triad.
 

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.419
&gt;
 

00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:06.039
I'll put it down here an octave.
 

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:07.509
&gt;
 

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:10.524
And then on top of it he's got
a seventh chord starting on

00:11:10.524 --> 00:11:11.000
E-flat.
 

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.250
&gt;
 

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.320
And either--each of those--each
&gt;

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.009
by itself is rather consonant,
but you put the two of them

00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:25.220
together &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.405
So this is a good example of
another way that Modernism in

00:11:28.405 --> 00:11:30.809
music is created,
and that's for the use of,

00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:32.600
very obviously,
a polychord.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.690
Interesting point.
 

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.379
I'm going to go to some slides
now because it's exactly at this

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:42.128
time in the history of art that
painters started doing this same

00:11:42.128 --> 00:11:43.200
kind of thing.
 

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.019
So we're going to go to the
first slide here.

00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:46.288
Who painted this, please?
 

00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:47.548
Student:
&gt;

00:11:47.548 --> 00:11:49.654
Prof: Nice and loud.
 

00:11:49.654 --> 00:11:51.450
I hear it in the back.
 

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:51.960
Student: Picasso.
 

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.730
Prof: Picasso. Okay.
 

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.950
"Three Musicians"
by Pablo Picasso.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.559
And what we have here is sort
of one musician kind of out of

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:03.174
phase with himself--
one musician and then another

00:12:03.174 --> 00:12:06.899
musician slightly in an
irregular position against that.

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:11.450
Next type of slide here:
This is Georges Braque,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.173
"Woman with Violin,"
a little bit difficult to see

00:12:16.173 --> 00:12:20.578
the woman there in the context
of this highly fragmented

00:12:20.578 --> 00:12:21.460
violin.
 

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.879
Now we're going to go on to
Juan Gris' "Violin"

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:30.301
and now we're going to go on to
a slide taken from a book

00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:33.379
published in 1916by Albert
Gleizes.

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:44.139
 
 

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.480
But we can see the point here.
 

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.178
Off to the left we have just a
square.

00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:53.210
And that square then is being
rotated against itself.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.440
It's being rotated
itself--against itself in

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.826
another position,
rotated itself in yet another

00:12:57.826 --> 00:13:00.678
position, and that's all these
musicians are doing.

00:13:00.678 --> 00:13:03.910
They're taking one triad and
then taking the triad right next

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.250
to each other so the triads are
slightly out of phase with each

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.788
other.
 

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:12.070
And ultimately it produces a
rather dissonant configuration.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.405
Okay.
 

00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:25.700
That's all we need here by way
of the slides.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.157
Well, the premiere of The
Rite of Spring was just as

00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:31.720
dissonant as some of these
paintings are.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.750
Indeed, it caused a scandal.
 

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.038
It caused a riot.
 

00:13:35.038 --> 00:13:39.019
It created the most infamous--I
guess--

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:44.080
riot in the history of music,
and we have,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.961
fortunately,
and they are contained here in

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:50.048
Modris Eksteins's book among
other places,

00:13:50.048 --> 00:13:52.715
some primary source
accounts--people who were there

00:13:52.715 --> 00:13:56.019
at the time telling what it was
like to be at this premiere.

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:57.928
So here are a couple of direct
quotes.

00:13:57.928 --> 00:14:02.044
"Then ensued a battery of
screams countered by a foil of

00:14:02.044 --> 00:14:02.799
applause.
 

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:04.918
We warred over art."
 

00:14:04.918 --> 00:14:07.000
I like that:
"warred over art."

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.120
"Or what some thought was
art but others didn't.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.458
About forty of the protesters
were forced out of the theater

00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:15.724
by the police,
but that did not quell the

00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:16.629
disturbance.
 

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:19.711
The lights in the auditorium
were turned fully on,

00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:23.232
but that did not still the
disjointed ravings of a mob of

00:14:23.232 --> 00:14:25.120
angry men and women."
 

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.125
End quote.
 

00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:29.450
And here's another direct
quote.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.580
"I was sitting in a box in
which I had rented one seat.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.467
Three ladies sat in front of me
and a young man occupied the

00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:36.350
place behind me.
 

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.698
He stood up during the course
of the ballet to see more

00:14:39.698 --> 00:14:40.320
clearly.
 

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.259
The intense excitement under
which he was laboring,

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:45.288
thanks to the potent force of
the music,

00:14:45.288 --> 00:14:50.129
portrayed itself presently when
he began to beat rhythmically

00:14:50.129 --> 00:14:53.759
with his fists on the top of my
head."

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:54.621
&gt;
 

00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:55.450
&gt;
 

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.788
End quote.
 

00:14:56.788 --> 00:14:59.851
Well, what is it,
again, specifically in this

00:14:59.851 --> 00:15:03.750
music of Stravinsky that causes
this kind of reaction?

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.720
Let me list for you--let me
enumerate five things here.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.500
One: heavy dissonance.
 

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.259
We just heard some of that,
&gt;

00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:14.519
that kind of sound,
almost a cluster-type

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:17.299
dissonance,
heavy dissonance created by

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:21.650
polychords in which we have
triads and these triads are only

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.200
a half step apart.
 

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.870
The roots are only a half step
apart.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.250
So one: heavy dissonance.
 

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.447
Two: much greater reliance on
percussion: tympani,

00:15:29.447 --> 00:15:32.320
glockenspiel,
celesta, that sort of thing.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.583
Three: as we saw with Jacob,
the use of stringed instruments

00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:40.346
as percussion instruments,
so a new use of these

00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:43.628
traditional instruments,
and even the piano,

00:15:43.628 --> 00:15:45.360
this banging on the piano.
 

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.360
The percussion--the piano is
technically a percussion

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.190
instrument but it's a
particularly lyrical one.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.820
Well, it's not so lyrically
used here in the modern idiom.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.519
Number four:
an increased use of woodwinds.

00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:00.678
The strings fall into the
background.

00:16:00.678 --> 00:16:03.802
The woodwinds with their
potentially bright,

00:16:03.802 --> 00:16:06.490
brittle sound are now
foregrounded.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:11.158
And fifth: this idea of rhythm,
driving rhythms,

00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:16.791
yes, but irregular rhythms and
polymeters and irregular meters

00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:21.129
all creating this kind of
disjunctive effect.

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:24.128
So let's listen now to a
passage out of Stravinsky's

00:16:24.128 --> 00:16:25.539
Rite of Spring.
 

00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:26.240
You heard one of them.
 

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.993
Let's listen to another one in
which all five of these elements

00:16:30.993 --> 00:16:32.220
sound at once.
 

00:16:32.220 --> 00:17:14.279
&gt;
 

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:15.930
So what do you think?
 

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.098
Do you like that music?
 

00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:20.490
Brian, you've been a good
student here.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.910
You've shown up virtually every
lecture.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:22.700
I see you out there.
 

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.009
What do you think of this?
 

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:26.162
Is this--
Student: Well,

00:17:26.162 --> 00:17:27.920
it's different--
Prof: It's different?

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.118
Student: Different than
the Mozart, more fast paced.

00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:33.368
Prof: More fast paced,
more sort of upbeat,

00:17:33.368 --> 00:17:34.930
kind of like a slap in the
face.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.759
Who doesn't like it?
 

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:37.521
End--okay.
 

00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:40.190
Caroline, honest person out
there.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.019
She doesn't like it.
 

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:43.048
At the end of the day,
are you going to go home when

00:17:43.048 --> 00:17:44.759
it's time to relax and put on
this music?

00:17:44.759 --> 00:17:46.859
Probably not.
 

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:49.618
Do I like this music?
 

00:17:49.618 --> 00:17:51.630
Yeah, I really do like this
music.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.837
I love this music but I've
heard it a lot,

00:17:54.837 --> 00:17:58.358
and when I first heard it I
didn't like it.

00:17:58.358 --> 00:17:59.924
It's one of these things like
sort of aural spinach or

00:17:59.924 --> 00:18:00.250
whatever.
 

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.765
You've got to really get used
to it over the years,

00:18:02.765 --> 00:18:05.078
mushrooms or whatever it might
happen to be.

00:18:05.078 --> 00:18:07.923
I first heard this piece in
nineteen sixty-seven,

00:18:07.923 --> 00:18:08.990
when I was a TA.
 

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.923
I had to teach it and I didn't
really know it,

00:18:11.923 --> 00:18:15.835
and then I had the honor and
pleasure of hearing it performed

00:18:15.835 --> 00:18:17.528
live in Paris in 1970.
 

00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:20.999
And it was really an epiphany
because I was sitting there--I

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:22.470
remember it distinctly.
 

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.832
It was in a boxing arena,
of all places,

00:18:24.832 --> 00:18:28.346
but they had an elevated stage
and the dancers came out and

00:18:28.346 --> 00:18:30.709
they started going
&gt;

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:33.678
, that kind of thing,
and the whole arena began to

00:18:33.678 --> 00:18:35.920
shake and I said,
"Whoa.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.630
I now understand. I get it.
 

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.108
It's not just the music.
 

00:18:39.108 --> 00:18:41.970
Music is just part of this
total artistic experience.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.835
It's a kind of sympathetic
vibration in conjunction with

00:18:45.835 --> 00:18:50.053
the kinetic experience of the
dance that really brings all of

00:18:50.053 --> 00:18:51.670
this to life."
 

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.506
So music here is just a kind of
catalyst for the ballet and to

00:18:55.506 --> 00:18:58.838
really begin to appreciate
something such as this,

00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:00.808
Stravinsky's approach to
Modernism,

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:04.508
we've kind of--we do,
in fact--have to see it to

00:19:04.508 --> 00:19:06.240
experience it fully.
 

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.108
And that's really what we're
going to do here next.

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:12.868
We're going to do that in
section starting today.

00:19:12.868 --> 00:19:16.375
We have a wonderful video for
you of the reconstruction of

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:19.082
The Rite of Spring
because the initial

00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:22.212
choreography,
which is an important part of

00:19:22.212 --> 00:19:23.328
this, was lost.
 

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:26.509
So a woman choreographer came
along,

00:19:26.509 --> 00:19:29.106
Millicent Hodson,
and she reconstructed all the

00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:32.663
choreography for this dance and
then they filmed it so this is a

00:19:32.663 --> 00:19:34.808
wonderful opportunity to see
this.

00:19:34.808 --> 00:19:38.548
We'll be talking about this in
section starting today.

00:19:38.548 --> 00:19:38.962
Okay.
 

00:19:38.962 --> 00:19:43.761
We're finished with our brief
introduction to Modernism and

00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:46.990
where do we stand now in our
course?

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.779
Well, obviously we're pretty
much at the end of it.

00:19:50.779 --> 00:19:54.079
What do you have to do--what
remains for you to do?

00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:57.140
Zach, what do you got to do?
 

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.328
Student: My last paper.
 

00:19:58.328 --> 00:19:59.779
Prof: You got to do your
last paper.

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:01.849
Each TA will assign that last
paper.

00:20:01.849 --> 00:20:03.038
What else do you have to do?
 

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:04.828
Student: Prepare for the
final exam.

00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:05.548
Prof: Prepare for the
final exam.

00:20:05.548 --> 00:20:07.298
We will be sending you a prep
sheet.

00:20:07.298 --> 00:20:10.232
The final exam I believe is
Wednesday, the seventeenth,

00:20:10.232 --> 00:20:10.940
at two p.m.
 

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.269
and will be in this room.
 

00:20:12.269 --> 00:20:14.250
Other things?
 

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.720
Student:
&gt;

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.171
Prof: Yeah,
the last six Listening

00:20:17.171 --> 00:20:18.660
Exercises, and I think that's
about it.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.500
And, of course,
in addition there's a review

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.463
section that I and one or two of
the TAs will be doing a week

00:20:25.463 --> 00:20:27.710
from today right back in here.
 

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.869
So is that the end of today?
 

00:20:29.869 --> 00:20:31.900
No, that's not the end of today.
 

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:37.269
We have a good half hour left
and I'd like to work just with

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:39.910
one piece and one composer.
 

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.176
At the end of the course,
I like to do a piece that's

00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:44.558
really--that I love.
 

00:20:44.558 --> 00:20:47.170
It doesn't really teach you
much of anything.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.598
It's an odd sensation.
 

00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:52.813
Oftentimes there are really
lovely pieces that I would like

00:20:52.813 --> 00:20:56.082
to incorporate in the textbook
and in this program generally

00:20:56.082 --> 00:20:59.740
but I can't do it because they
don't really teach us anything.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.238
We were listening to one in
section, this intro music,

00:21:04.238 --> 00:21:07.038
the other day by Samuel Barber.
 

00:21:07.038 --> 00:21:11.040
Anybody know who wrote a famous
piece--or what the name of that

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.299
famous piece by Samuel Barber
is?

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:16.368
Thaddeus, Elizabeth, Raoul.
 

00:21:16.368 --> 00:21:17.348
Student: "The
Adagio"

00:21:17.348 --> 00:21:19.896
Prof: "The Adagio
of--for Strings"

00:21:19.896 --> 00:21:22.190
by Samuel Barber,
American--it's beautiful.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.174
We should--everybody should
download it for ninety-nine

00:21:24.174 --> 00:21:24.470
cents.
 

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.467
It's just gorgeous,
but we don't really learn

00:21:26.467 --> 00:21:27.328
anything from it.
 

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:30.753
Well, this is a piece that
we--we're about to hear that we

00:21:30.753 --> 00:21:34.478
will learn only really one thing
about, and that is the idea of

00:21:34.478 --> 00:21:35.858
an orchestral Lied.
 

00:21:35.858 --> 00:21:39.282
So I'm going to go back to one
of my favorite composers and

00:21:39.282 --> 00:21:40.700
that is Gustav Mahler.
 

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.435
We talked a little bit about
Gustav Mahler when we had our

00:21:44.435 --> 00:21:47.910
lecture on the symphony in the
nineteenth century,

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:52.019
and we said that Mahler was of
Jewish descent,

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:55.150
from what is now a portion of
the Czech Republic,

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.660
who came in to Vienna to study
music.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.202
He started as a pianist,
became a conductor,

00:22:00.202 --> 00:22:03.278
and basically he earned his
living as a conductor.

00:22:03.278 --> 00:22:06.644
He got small-time jobs out in
the provinces and then

00:22:06.644 --> 00:22:09.548
ultimately worked his way back
to Vienna,

00:22:09.548 --> 00:22:13.190
where he became the conductor
of the Staatsoper in

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.805
Vienna,
and if you ever go to

00:22:14.805 --> 00:22:16.690
Vienna--and you should all go to
Vienna.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.509
It's an incredibly musical city.
 

00:22:18.509 --> 00:22:21.490
Everywhere you go you see these
silhouettes of Mozart.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.788
It is so cool.
 

00:22:22.788 --> 00:22:26.182
So you have to go to--you can't
walk a block without seeing

00:22:26.182 --> 00:22:26.710
Mozart.
 

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.900
It's to die for.
 

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.614
So there we are on the
Ringstrasse with the

00:22:30.614 --> 00:22:34.125
great Staatsoper,
and this is where Gustav Mahler

00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:38.065
conducted and it's still there,
but Mahler was a difficult

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.858
person to get along with.
 

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:43.190
I suppose oftentimes great
artists are, geniuses are.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.796
They tend to be
self-referential and maybe

00:22:45.796 --> 00:22:49.608
rightly so, but in any event,
he was an orchestral tyrant.

00:22:49.608 --> 00:22:52.473
His players didn't like playing
for them, and after ten years

00:22:52.473 --> 00:22:54.048
they didn't renew his contract.
 

00:22:54.048 --> 00:22:56.318
In effect, he was fired in
Vienna but,

00:22:56.318 --> 00:23:00.118
as good fortune had it,
he was able--

00:23:00.118 --> 00:23:03.246
or at that time there was an
opening in New York City so he

00:23:03.246 --> 00:23:06.480
comes to New York to conduct
first the Metropolitan Opera and

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.715
then a year or so later he took
on what was to become the New

00:23:09.715 --> 00:23:11.009
York Philharmonic.
 

00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:13.336
So there he is,
the principal conductor,

00:23:13.336 --> 00:23:14.710
now in New York City.
 

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:22.778
Interestingly enough,
on two occasions Mahler came to

00:23:22.778 --> 00:23:24.640
New Haven.
 

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.098
He came to New Haven.
 

00:23:26.098 --> 00:23:30.874
He brought--first was in 1910,
he brought the New York

00:23:30.874 --> 00:23:35.828
Philharmonic to New Haven and
where did they perform?

00:23:35.828 --> 00:23:39.880
Where would you imagine they'd
perform?

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.559
Woolsey Hall. Okay?
 

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:43.788
Woolsey Hall.
 

00:23:43.788 --> 00:23:47.150
Woolsey Hall was built for
Gustav Mahler.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:47.384
No.
 

00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:51.307
That's not really true,
but it gets across a point:

00:23:51.307 --> 00:23:55.699
that Woolsey Hall was built to
be a concert hall for what

00:23:55.699 --> 00:24:00.011
Gustav Mahler represented,
which was the apotheosis,

00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:02.917
the ultimate flourishing,
although they didn't know it

00:24:02.917 --> 00:24:05.614
was the ultimate at the time,
of this great instrument,

00:24:05.614 --> 00:24:08.490
which was the
nineteenth-century orchestra.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.288
So Mahler brings the New York
Philharmonic to Woolsey Hall.

00:24:12.288 --> 00:24:15.432
The next time you're in Woolsey
Hall, think of Gustav Mahler

00:24:15.432 --> 00:24:17.190
standing on those boards there.
 

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:22.153
And, as good luck would have it
again, the concert was reviewed

00:24:22.153 --> 00:24:25.836
in of all places,
as you can see by the handout

00:24:25.836 --> 00:24:28.480
for today, The Yale Daily.
 

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.308
How about that?
 

00:24:29.308 --> 00:24:31.304
The Yale Daily
&gt;

00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:33.019
reviews Gustav Mahler,
astonishing.

00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:34.730
Okay, astonishing.
 

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.656
And I didn't--darn it--I didn't
bring my glasses today,

00:24:38.656 --> 00:24:43.166
but you can sort of look at the
review there and it talks about

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:44.549
the repertoire.
 

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:46.838
What did he perform?
 

00:24:46.838 --> 00:24:48.625
First of all,
they slightly misspelled his

00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:48.930
name.
 

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.452
There's no "e"
on Gustav in the way he spelled

00:24:51.452 --> 00:24:53.150
it, but that doesn't really
matter.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:58.012
What did they perform at this
concert conducted by Mahler in

00:24:58.012 --> 00:24:59.250
Woolsey Hall?
 

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.808
What's it say there? Elizabeth.
 

00:25:01.808 --> 00:25:03.470
Student: Symphonie
fantastique--

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.840
Prof: Okay,
Symphonie fantastique,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.848
the basis of what?
 

00:25:06.848 --> 00:25:10.751
Your Listening Exercise 34.
 

00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:11.618
Okay?
 

00:25:11.618 --> 00:25:13.914
So that was one of the big
pieces, the ones that you have

00:25:13.914 --> 00:25:14.529
just engaged.
 

00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:15.839
What else, please?
 

00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:17.420
Student: Bach's suites.
 

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.117
Prof: Okay.
 

00:25:18.117 --> 00:25:19.009
Bach orchestral suite.
 

00:25:19.009 --> 00:25:20.079
It doesn't say which one.
 

00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:20.950
It doesn't matter.
 

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.230
What else?
 

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.900
Student: Strauss's
&gt;

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.720
Prof: Yeah. That's good.
 

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.348
Till Eulenspiegel's Merry
Pranks.

00:25:28.348 --> 00:25:30.759
That's another one of these
tone poems,

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:32.971
like Zarathusta, and
like Death and

00:25:32.971 --> 00:25:37.715
Transfiguration, by Strauss,
and there was also a pianist

00:25:37.715 --> 00:25:40.363
there,
and what did she perform,

00:25:40.363 --> 00:25:41.440
Olga Samaroff?
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.460
Student: Grieg
&gt;

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.279
Prof: Yeah,
the Grieg Piano Concerto.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:50.471
But no music by Mahler,
because in his day Mahler was

00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:55.761
thought to really be more of a
conductor than he was a

00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:57.058
composer.
 

00:25:57.058 --> 00:25:58.769
We'll come back to that point
in a minute.

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:03.476
The second time that Mahler
came to New Haven was the next

00:26:03.476 --> 00:26:04.548
year, 1911.
 

00:26:04.548 --> 00:26:08.509
He went to what was then called
New Haven Hospital.

00:26:08.509 --> 00:26:08.837
Why?
 

00:26:08.837 --> 00:26:11.630
Because he had a heart
condition.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.924
And I gather--and we have in
our midst today a specialist who

00:26:15.924 --> 00:26:18.858
can talk to this more directly
than I--

00:26:18.858 --> 00:26:22.038
a streptococcal infection,
a lingering streptococcal

00:26:22.038 --> 00:26:25.715
infection in the area of the
heart that had greatly weakened

00:26:25.715 --> 00:26:29.269
his heart so the doctors at
Yale-New Haven Hospital--

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:30.884
New Haven Hospital said,
"There's really nothing we

00:26:30.884 --> 00:26:31.558
can do for you."
 

00:26:31.558 --> 00:26:35.009
He goes back to New York,
goes immediately back to Vienna

00:26:35.009 --> 00:26:38.400
and he dies within six weeks of
this heart condition.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.375
And we have--and I'm delighted
to say Dr. James Hines has

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:42.970
been with us all semester.
 

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.349
Jim, thank you for your
attendance--a cardiologist.

00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:47.420
He has been here.
 

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.554
You may have thought that this
was just accidental,

00:26:49.554 --> 00:26:51.390
but in case--I was thinking
this morning.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.205
We've never told you that we
had--if your heart begins to

00:26:54.205 --> 00:26:57.273
palpitate when you're listening
to all this really great music

00:26:57.273 --> 00:26:59.838
and you become aphasic or
something like that,

00:26:59.838 --> 00:27:02.748
we have an attendant here ready
to serve you in the form of

00:27:02.748 --> 00:27:03.450
Dr. Hines.
 

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.352
So you've been in good hands
all along and thank you,

00:27:06.352 --> 00:27:07.578
Jim, for being here.
 

00:27:07.578 --> 00:27:13.597
So let's take a look at some of
the things that Gustav Mahler

00:27:13.597 --> 00:27:18.112
composed here,
and I think we've got a list up

00:27:18.112 --> 00:27:19.415
on the board.
 

00:27:19.415 --> 00:27:20.420
Okay.
 

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.519
Symphonies: nine symphonies.
 

00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:25.768
Why is it that everybody
composes nine symphonies and

00:27:25.768 --> 00:27:28.079
then they die--
&gt;

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:29.079
--stop at eight.
 

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:29.578
No.
 

00:27:29.578 --> 00:27:33.048
He composed also nine
symphonies.

00:27:33.048 --> 00:27:36.201
He composed nine symphonies and
if you like Mahler,

00:27:36.201 --> 00:27:39.856
and I hope you will come to
like Mahler, I think there's an

00:27:39.856 --> 00:27:42.190
entry path into these
symphonies.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:43.740
Start with number four.
 

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.200
It's the most user friendly,
then number one.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.542
We played two tracks out of
number one in that symphony

00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:52.640
lecture so you know that it's a
great piece too.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.386
Then Symphony number five,
which is worth the price of

00:27:56.386 --> 00:27:59.851
admission, really,
if for no other reason than the

00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:01.690
middle movement there.
 

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.630
That Adagietto is just
so heartbreakingly beautiful

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.538
that no one would want to miss
it,

00:28:06.538 --> 00:28:09.940
and then ultimately a little
bit more challenging symphonies,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.910
bigger symphonies:
number eight and number nine.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.500
Mahler also wrote,
as you can see up there,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.808
two collections of songs.
 

00:28:18.808 --> 00:28:22.890
They're called orchestral
Lieder.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.450
We have this orchestral Lied.
 

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.380
It simply means orchestral song.
 

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.220
We've had the Lied before in
our course.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.960
Where?
 

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.818
Indeed, what was the name of
the Lied that we worked with?

00:28:37.818 --> 00:28:45.049
Composer's name,
the name of the piece?

00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:47.740
Hm?
 

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.210
Student:
&gt;

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.599
Prof: Okay. That's it.
 

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:55.828
What was the name of the piece?
 

00:28:55.828 --> 00:28:56.788
Student:
&gt;

00:28:56.788 --> 00:28:57.662
Prof: "The Elf
King." Thank you,

00:28:57.662 --> 00:28:57.880
Frederick.
 

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.470
And who was the composer?
 

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.400
Student:
&gt;

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.997
Prof: Franz Schubert.
 

00:29:01.997 --> 00:29:02.338
Okay.
 

00:29:02.338 --> 00:29:05.898
So we've had a--that's a Lied
for piano but now we have a Lied

00:29:05.898 --> 00:29:08.932
for voice and orchestra,
so it tends to be bigger and

00:29:08.932 --> 00:29:10.099
more flamboyant.
 

00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:11.298
This is a new genre.
 

00:29:11.298 --> 00:29:14.652
It's longer,
it's more colorful,

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:20.598
yet it features a single voice
singing a single text.

00:29:20.598 --> 00:29:24.494
So we're going to focus
on--now--on one of Gustav

00:29:24.494 --> 00:29:28.876
Mahler's orchestral Lieds,
and it's talked about in the

00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:32.608
textbook there right before
Impressionism.

00:29:32.608 --> 00:29:34.779
No Listening Exercise on it
and, as I say,

00:29:34.779 --> 00:29:38.477
it's in there just because I
think it's a drop-dead beautiful

00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:42.050
piece and I want to try to
proselytize a bit with regard to

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.269
Mahler's music so it has a text.
 

00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:45.220
Here's the text.
 

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.710
The text is by romantic German
poet Friedrich Ruckert.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:54.664
We're now talking about
"Ich bin der Welt abhanden

00:29:54.664 --> 00:29:59.517
gekommen"
by Friedrich Ruckert as set in

00:29:59.517 --> 00:30:04.480
this collection of five songs
about 1902.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.578
And let's take a look at the
German here just for a moment,

00:30:07.578 --> 00:30:09.875
"Ich bin der Welt abhanden
gekommen,"

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:12.368
"I've become detached from
the world."

00:30:12.368 --> 00:30:16.660
And I thought it'd be nice to
hear a German speaker,

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.009
or somebody that speaks pretty
good German,

00:30:19.009 --> 00:30:21.740
tackle this text so I've asked
a student,

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.118
David Narotsky to stand up,
if you would.

00:30:25.118 --> 00:30:27.876
David's applying to med school.
 

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:28.500
Right?
 

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.990
You're going around for all
kinds of med school interviews

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.700
but here he's putting on his
German hat for us this morning.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.328
So read the first strophe,
please, David.

00:30:36.328 --> 00:30:46.200
Student: &lt;&lt;speaks
German&gt;&gt;

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.284
Prof: Okay.
 

00:30:47.284 --> 00:30:50.839
Let's cut to the last one and a
little bit more slowly and a

00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:52.828
little--because it slows down.
 

00:30:52.828 --> 00:30:54.940
So let's read it a little more
slowly.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:31:06.410
Student: &lt;&lt;speaks
German&gt;&gt;

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.166
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:07.166 --> 00:31:07.420
Great.
 

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.220
Thanks very much.
 

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.170
So, as you can see here,
this is, in a sense,

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:16.185
old person's music in that this
is an individual that has become

00:31:16.185 --> 00:31:20.067
disenchanted--
is exhausted from the trials

00:31:20.067 --> 00:31:23.048
and tribulations of this world.
 

00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:25.614
There's that sense of "Ich
bin der Welt abhanden

00:31:25.614 --> 00:31:27.784
gekommen,"
I've become detached from the

00:31:27.784 --> 00:31:30.692
world and if you don't see much
of me anymore I don't really

00:31:30.692 --> 00:31:33.827
care because,
as it says in the last strophe,

00:31:33.827 --> 00:31:37.363
"Ich bin gestorben dem
Weltgetümmel,"

00:31:37.363 --> 00:31:40.690
I'm dead to the tumult I guess
of the world,

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.256
"und ruh' in einem stillen
Gebiet,"

00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:47.164
and I rest now in a still land,
"ich leb' allein,"

00:31:47.164 --> 00:31:49.573
I'm living alone in my
heaven,"

00:31:49.573 --> 00:31:52.859
"in meinem Lieben,
in meinem Lied,"

00:31:52.859 --> 00:31:56.809
and there it's an interesting
play of the word Lied because

00:31:56.809 --> 00:31:58.650
it's not so much a song.
 

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.625
This is a metaphor for all of
his music so this is an

00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:06.675
individual that has become
detached from the world and

00:32:06.675 --> 00:32:10.269
simply wants to live in the
world of music.

00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:12.220
So let's listen to a bit of it
now.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.608
And it starts out with an
English horn.

00:32:18.608 --> 00:32:21.162
Somebody tell us,
review for us,

00:32:21.162 --> 00:32:25.195
what an English horn is--talked
about this before.

00:32:25.195 --> 00:32:26.019
Jerry.
 

00:32:26.019 --> 00:32:28.230
Student:
&gt;

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.858
Prof: A lower oboe.
 

00:32:29.858 --> 00:32:31.050
That's right,
a lower oboe,

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.838
and it sounds a little bit
mournful,

00:32:32.838 --> 00:32:35.098
sounds a little bit nostalgic
here,

00:32:35.098 --> 00:32:38.667
so we hear a lovely harp
underneath and then the English

00:32:38.667 --> 00:32:42.625
horn will start with just one
phrase and then that phrase will

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:43.210
grow.
 

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:46.211
It's kind of a cell or a motive
growing into a longer melody as

00:32:46.211 --> 00:32:48.440
we discussed in the beginning of
the course.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:33:53.588
 
 

00:33:53.588 --> 00:33:56.758
It's an interesting song in
that--I'm going to vamp here

00:33:56.758 --> 00:33:57.910
just for a moment.
 

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:01.627
It starts out with the harp
underneath and the English horn,

00:34:01.627 --> 00:34:05.410
and it's a movement in which
there is no brass whatsoever.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.110
So I believe we have it set up
now.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.735
It's not to be an exciting
movement, much more of a

00:34:10.735 --> 00:34:11.889
reflective movement.
 

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:47.969
&gt;
 

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:59.090
Passes off the melody to a
clarinet &lt;&lt;music

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:03.030
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.349
and then the voice will come in.
 

00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:16.699
&gt;
 

00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:16.949
Okay.
 

00:35:16.949 --> 00:35:18.500
We're going to pause it there.
 

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:23.309
Then we will go on to a little
bit of material from the climax

00:35:23.309 --> 00:35:26.780
of the song just by way of a
preview here.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.650
We're going to go on now to
4'47",

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:33.567
if you will,
where he works up to a peak on

00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:36.398
this text,
"Ich leb' allein in meinem

00:35:36.398 --> 00:35:37.693
Himmel,
in meinem Lieben,

00:35:37.693 --> 00:35:38.760
in meinem Lied."
 

00:35:38.760 --> 00:36:33.170
&gt;
 

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:43.010
A little bit of dissonance,
&gt;

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:48.175
back to the tonic,
English horn comes back in,

00:36:48.175 --> 00:36:50.929
builds out the melody.
 

00:36:50.929 --> 00:37:12.119
&gt;
 

00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:12.380
Okay.
 

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.351
Now we're going to pause it
here because there's one other

00:37:15.351 --> 00:37:18.164
small point that I want to make
and that has to do with

00:37:18.164 --> 00:37:19.989
a--what's called a suspension.
 

00:37:19.989 --> 00:37:24.166
A suspension is something that
composers set up in music to

00:37:24.166 --> 00:37:27.119
sort of make us feel a
particular way,

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:30.697
and they'll start with this by
having a note be consonant

00:37:30.697 --> 00:37:32.550
&gt;
 

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.806
and then having--moving the
harmony underneath of it

00:37:34.806 --> 00:37:36.090
&gt;
 

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.268
to a dissonance and then
&gt;

00:37:39.268 --> 00:37:46.027
resolving it to a consonant
like that or maybe &lt;&lt;plays

00:37:46.027 --> 00:37:47.860
piano&gt;&gt;.
 

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.550
And the longer they sit on the
dissonance, the more feeling,

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.239
I think, is communicated.
 

00:37:53.239 --> 00:37:56.003
And here at the end of the
Romantic period it tends to

00:37:56.003 --> 00:37:58.820
be--they tend to sit on these
dissonances inside of the

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.960
suspension for a long period of
time.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.007
So we're about to hear--We're
about to hear the strings go up

00:38:05.007 --> 00:38:08.922
and play a suspension and then
the English horn will do the

00:38:08.922 --> 00:38:09.530
same.
 

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:20.119
There it is &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;.

00:38:20.119 --> 00:38:27.786
Now the English horn will
suspend, &lt;&lt;music

00:38:27.786 --> 00:38:30.559
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:38:30.559 --> 00:38:40.949
dissonance &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;.

00:38:40.949 --> 00:38:43.159
Okay. So that's the piece.
 

00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:45.373
Now we're going to do something
we've only done on one other

00:38:45.373 --> 00:38:47.664
occasion in the class and that
is to listen to the whole piece

00:38:47.664 --> 00:38:48.639
from beginning to end.
 

00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:51.579
I'd like to do this and it may
be a little hokey I guess,

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:52.840
but it doesn't matter.
 

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.900
I'm going to turn off all the
lights here as best I can,

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.989
and I do this because it gives
you a sense,

00:38:57.989 --> 00:39:01.250
sometimes, of what--at least
how I engage music oftentimes--

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.309
what does it do for us?
 

00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:05.070
Well, we've talked before at
the beginning.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.340
It allows us to kind of relax,
center our attention.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.219
You're under a lot of stress at
the moment.

00:39:10.219 --> 00:39:13.800
This is the sort of climax,
crunch time,

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.155
in the academic world so this
is an opportunity to kind of

00:39:17.155 --> 00:39:19.885
tune everything out,
maybe go inside of your own

00:39:19.885 --> 00:39:22.686
Gebiet here,
your own musical territory,

00:39:22.686 --> 00:39:25.780
and maybe think of things in
the past,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.956
music as a creator of
nostalgia, think of things that

00:39:28.956 --> 00:39:31.628
might be,
music giving us a vision

00:39:31.628 --> 00:39:35.378
perhaps of a better world,
whatever you'd like--whatever

00:39:35.378 --> 00:39:38.590
spin you want to put on this,
but we're going to be--each of

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.780
us is now going to go into our
own zone here for about seven

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.429
minutes as we listen to this
orchestral Lied,

00:39:44.429 --> 00:39:47.507
"Ich bin der Welt abhanden
gekommen,"

00:39:47.507 --> 00:39:48.780
by Gustav Mahler.
 

00:39:48.780 --> 00:46:43.579
&gt;
 

00:46:43.579 --> 00:46:43.840
Okay.
 

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.711
So that's our last piece of
music for Listening to Music

00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:47.130
here.
 

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.898
Now I'm going to tell you what
this class was really about.

00:46:48.898 --> 00:46:49.630
&gt;
 

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.889
It wasn't about listening to
music.

00:46:51.889 --> 00:46:56.309
It was about saving classical
music.

00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:57.059
Why?
 

00:46:57.059 --> 00:46:59.510
Why would we want to save
classical music?

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:02.050
We could spend hours discussing
that.

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:06.835
We would want to save it,
arguably, because it is one of

00:47:06.835 --> 00:47:10.840
the things that we value in
Western culture.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.690
What do we value?
 

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:12.840
I was thinking about this,
this morning.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.380
We've got--we just had a big
election.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.750
Right? We value democracy.
 

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.389
We value religious freedom.
 

00:47:18.389 --> 00:47:22.050
We value equality of the sexes,
of gender.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:22.840
What else?
 

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.519
Due process under the law.
 

00:47:24.519 --> 00:47:25.768
We value Shakespeare.
 

00:47:25.768 --> 00:47:29.644
We value Leonardo da Vinci and
the symphonies of Mozart for

00:47:29.644 --> 00:47:31.976
example,
and these are very important

00:47:31.976 --> 00:47:35.625
things and I think they're worth
fighting for and worth trying to

00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:36.309
preserve.
 

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:39.329
Recently, somebody gave the
School of Music how much money?

00:47:39.329 --> 00:47:43.739
One hundred million dollars to
keep classical music alive.

00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:44.699
That's a lot of money.
 

00:47:44.699 --> 00:47:47.110
I've done my part,
showed up here every day,

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.570
haven't missed a minute.
 

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.239
Now it's time for you to do
your part.

00:47:51.239 --> 00:47:52.268
What's your part?
 

00:47:52.268 --> 00:47:54.340
You have to do the following
kinds of things.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:59.365
You have to continue to buy CDs
and download classical music off

00:47:59.365 --> 00:48:01.760
of iTunes or whatever it is.
 

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.019
Don't steal that stuff.
 

00:48:03.019 --> 00:48:03.949
Why?
 

00:48:03.949 --> 00:48:06.070
If you take that stuff for
nothing, what are you doing?

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:10.460
You're taking the livelihood
away from Jacob and Santana and

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:13.960
Lynda here, just the livelihood
of musicians.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.710
They've put their labor into it
and you're taking it for

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:16.030
nothing.
 

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:17.119
So download these things.
 

00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:18.000
It doesn't cost all that much.
 

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.599
Two: get involved.
 

00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:21.108
Get involved in informal
singing groups,

00:48:21.108 --> 00:48:23.199
keep your piano lessons,
if you've ever had those kinds

00:48:23.199 --> 00:48:24.708
of things going on,
local choral groups,

00:48:24.708 --> 00:48:25.289
whatever.
 

00:48:25.289 --> 00:48:26.130
You get out of Yale.
 

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:26.929
What do you do?
 

00:48:26.929 --> 00:48:29.226
Get on the boards of these
artistic institutions,

00:48:29.226 --> 00:48:31.427
your local symphony,
your local choral society,

00:48:31.427 --> 00:48:33.820
opera company,
Neighborhood Music School here.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.230
Get on the board of that and
help them, those sorts of folks.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:41.452
Most important,
give music lessons to your

00:48:41.452 --> 00:48:44.438
children, adopted or natural.
 

00:48:44.438 --> 00:48:45.159
Why?
 

00:48:45.159 --> 00:48:47.858
Teaches them hard work,
teaches them to think

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:50.396
sequentially,
teaches them various forms of

00:48:50.396 --> 00:48:53.878
quantitative reasoning,
teaches them also to be

00:48:53.878 --> 00:48:59.739
disciplined and teaches them to
have a pride in the work product

00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:02.809
that they ultimately generate.
 

00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:05.159
So these are the kinds of
things that you can do.

00:49:05.159 --> 00:49:06.699
I thank you for your attention.
 

00:49:06.699 --> 00:49:09.208
I thank you--I thank the TAs
for doing such a wonderful--and

00:49:09.208 --> 00:49:10.570
we've had great TAs this year.
 

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:17.110
And so I will end by quoting
here Gustav Mahler once again,

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:18.510
to share with you "meinem
Lieben,

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:20.739
und meinem Lied,"
because it really is.

00:49:20.739 --> 00:49:22.059
Thanks very much.
 

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:29.000

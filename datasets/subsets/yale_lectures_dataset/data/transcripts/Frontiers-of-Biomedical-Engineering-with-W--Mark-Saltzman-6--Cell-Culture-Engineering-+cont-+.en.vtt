00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.146
Professor Mark Saltzman:
Okay, today we're going to

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.922
continue our discussion of
cellular principles and lead

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:22.007
into cell culture technology
which will be the subject of the

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.132
section meeting this afternoon,
so just to remind you about the

00:00:26.132 --> 00:00:30.520
sections.
We've been reading Chapter 5.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.042
We talked last time about some
of the basic properties of

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:41.762
cells, their basic architecture
and what ways cells are the

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:44.754
same,
in what ways cells from

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:50.611
animals, including humans differ
from simpler microorganisms like

00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:54.527
bacteria.
Then we talked a little bit

00:00:54.527 --> 00:01:00.369
about the sort of physics of
what holds cells together to

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:06.340
form a collection of cells,
a tissue and to make up the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.922
structure of our body.
Today we want to talk in more

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:15.545
detail about the question of how
can cells--if they're the same

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:19.049
and they have the same kind of
construction,

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.728
and they all contain the same
genetic material--how can they

00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:28.249
develop into a multi cellular
organism that has cells that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:32.372
differ so greatly in
function--that differ as much as

00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:36.972
the cells in our brain differ
from the cells of our skin or

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:39.629
our liver,
or our blood.

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:43.294
What are the sort of basic
principles that lead to these

00:01:43.294 --> 00:01:47.420
differences between cells?
To start out I'm going to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.630
go back to the thinking about
development a little bit,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.840
embryonic development,
and show you a picture here.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.409
This is a picture of the female
reproductive tract.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.633
This is the uterus down here,
sort of half of it is shown

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.801
with the uterine wall,
the fallopian tubes,

00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:12.334
and the ovaries.
You know that the ovary

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:19.544
produces an egg.
An egg is an example of a germ

00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:23.064
cell.
Has only half of the diploid

00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:28.384
chromosomal content that most of
the cells, which are called

00:02:28.384 --> 00:02:34.048
somatic cells in our body have.
Germ line cells sperm and egg

00:02:34.048 --> 00:02:39.424
are produced by the process of
myosis, and that's reviewed in

00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:42.678
the book,
where it's a special kind of

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:47.036
cell division that results in
the reduction of chromosome

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:51.705
number from two copies of each
chromosome down to one copy of

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:55.747
each chromosome.
The other germ line cell is the

00:02:55.747 --> 00:02:59.652
sperm cell.
Fertilization of these two

00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:05.596
- where these two cells join
occurs in the distal part of the

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:09.448
fallopian tube.
The result of fertilization now

00:03:09.448 --> 00:03:13.319
is a new cell that is the union
of the sperm and the egg,

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.314
and it's called the zygote and
it contains the diploid number

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:20.500
of chromosomes,
genes.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.110
One copy of the chromosome
comes from the egg and one copy

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.656
of each chromosome comes from
the sperm, so this you know

00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:29.443
about.
This one cell,

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:34.554
this one fertilized cell which
is unique because it's the - its

00:03:34.554 --> 00:03:39.088
chromosome contains the
combination of the sperm and the

00:03:39.088 --> 00:03:42.200
egg,
develops into an embryo and

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.449
then on birth develops into a
human.

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:52.560
Each of us has something like
10^(14) cells.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.299
We talked about last time that
part of the process of going

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.203
from this single cell to multi
cellular many celled organisms

00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:06.236
like we are is cell division.
The cell divides,

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:08.515
and divides,
and divides many,

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:12.523
many times and that's one of
the signature events of

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.509
embryogenesis until we have
many,

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.490
many cells that make up our
bodies.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.512
In that process,
cells become different in ways

00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:23.750
that appear to be highly
organized.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.448
We have tissues like the brain
which are assembled to do

00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:33.403
functions that are different
from any other groups of cells

00:04:33.403 --> 00:04:36.828
in the body.
They work in concert and they

00:04:36.828 --> 00:04:40.520
all have similarities,
the same with all of our other

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.940
organs.
So how does that happen?

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.604
Well, it really happens
throughout development and it

00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:50.705
happens from the first stages.
In fact, there are differences

00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:54.335
that can be detected upon the
first cell division where this

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.350
zygote divides through the
process of mitosis.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.629
We talked about mitosis last
time;

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.199
it's described more completely
in the chapter,

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.370
where two cells are formed from
one.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.329
Now, these cells have some
differences.

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:11.621
If you could look at these
cells you could find differences

00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:14.802
between them,
there are chemical differences

00:05:14.802 --> 00:05:17.910
in the content of each of these
cells.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.048
If mitosis occurs the way that
it's supposed to,

00:05:21.048 --> 00:05:24.519
the DNA that's in each of these
cells is the same.

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:29.378
That's one of the properties of
mitosis, that the DNA gets

00:05:29.378 --> 00:05:34.577
completely duplicated during the
S phase, during DNA synthesis

00:05:34.577 --> 00:05:37.144
phase.
How could these cells be

00:05:37.144 --> 00:05:39.959
different then,
if they contain the same DNA?

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.190
What's a physical mechanism
that could lead to differences

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.930
between these two cells at this
very early stage of development?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.820
Any ideas?

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.267
If the DNA is synthesized
exactly correctly,

00:05:56.267 --> 00:06:00.303
so each one gets the right
copies of DNA,

00:06:00.303 --> 00:06:04.540
what other differences could
there be?

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.322
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:06.360
Mark Saltzman The size of
the cells could be different;

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.504
maybe mitosis is asymmetrical
in some way so that one of the

00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:11.850
cells ends up being bigger than
the other.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.780
How could size affect the life
of the cell?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.329
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:25.846
Mark Saltzman Different
amount of metabolic activity

00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:27.639
because one has a greater volume
of cytoplasm than the other,

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.188
for example,
so these are exactly the right

00:06:30.188 --> 00:06:33.525
kinds of ideas.
There could be differences in

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:38.295
the physics of cell division,
this process of separating into

00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:42.588
two cells such that even though
they both have the same

00:06:42.588 --> 00:06:45.443
chromosomes,
they both have the same DNA

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:48.506
content, maybe one of the cells
entraps something that's

00:06:48.506 --> 00:06:52.360
different than the other cells.
That difference could have

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.759
been generated during the
process of fertilization.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:01.145
The sperm - say this is the one
sperm cell that's able to inject

00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:05.078
its DNA into the egg,
well then this cell has a

00:07:05.078 --> 00:07:07.939
polarity.
Now, the top is different from

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:11.437
the bottom because the sperm
came in this side physically and

00:07:11.437 --> 00:07:14.507
not the other side.
Remember that these cells are

00:07:14.507 --> 00:07:17.773
relatively large compared to
bacteria and so diffusion

00:07:17.773 --> 00:07:21.040
doesn't occur very quickly over
this length scale.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.231
In the time it takes for one
cell division to occur,

00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:29.668
it could be that this cell
entraps a different chemical

00:07:29.668 --> 00:07:33.860
composition of the cytoplasm
then this entraps,

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.979
and that's a well known concept.
The only important thing to

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.295
realize about that is that these
differences start to occur very

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.134
early in development.
Once you have a difference that

00:07:46.134 --> 00:07:50.592
occurs, two cells or difference,
those differences can propagate

00:07:50.592 --> 00:07:55.301
as the cells continue to divide.
What's shown in this

00:07:55.301 --> 00:08:00.972
diagram is the progress of the
developing embryo as it travels

00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:04.319
in time, down the fallopian
tube.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:08.180
There's one division,
here it shows it at the 16 cell

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.818
stage and then here,
and this transformation as it

00:08:11.818 --> 00:08:15.160
goes from 16 cells to more like
64 cells.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.273
There's a change in sort of the
shape of the overall embryo as

00:08:20.273 --> 00:08:23.365
well.
It's no longer just a round

00:08:23.365 --> 00:08:28.189
spherical mass of cells,
but it has some structure.

00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:32.241
There's a cluster of cells
here, there's a sheet of cells

00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:36.294
that forms an outer lining,
and what is most noticeable is

00:08:36.294 --> 00:08:40.399
this cavity, this fluid filled
cavity which begins to develop.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:44.694
Well, this stage of
development is called the

00:08:44.694 --> 00:08:49.704
blastocyst and it's at this
stage late in this blastocyst

00:08:49.704 --> 00:08:55.610
stage that the developing embryo
implants in the uterine wall,

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.524
and there begins to form an
interface with the mother so

00:09:00.524 --> 00:09:05.350
that it can be nourished during
further development.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.707
The cells of this surrounding
sheet have become different in

00:09:10.707 --> 00:09:15.792
some way and they develop into
the placenta and the extra

00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:19.675
embryonic tissues.
The cells of this cluster

00:09:19.675 --> 00:09:23.898
inside next to the fluid filled
cavity is a region of the

00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:26.990
blastocyst called the inner cell
mass.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:32.137
It's this group of cells,
this subset of cells from the

00:09:32.137 --> 00:09:37.475
developing embryo that become
the embryo, that become the

00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:42.507
organism, become the human.
We're going to talk as we

00:09:42.507 --> 00:09:46.806
go through about the concept of
stem cells and how stem cells

00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:50.961
are related to development and
what's so special about stem

00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:53.040
cells.
We're going to talk about

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.151
different kinds of stem cells.
One of the differences in stem

00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:02.007
cell populations that you will
hear about is you hear about

00:10:02.007 --> 00:10:07.029
embryonic stem cells and you
hear about adult stem cells.

00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:09.305
Those are obvious what the
differences are,

00:10:09.305 --> 00:10:11.960
embryonic stem cells are
derived from embryos .

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.599
It's this - its cells in this
region here, this inner cell

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:20.750
mass that that's the source of
embryonic stem cells,

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.679
cells from inner cell mass
here.

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:27.428
Adult stem cells are acquired
in some fashion from an adult

00:10:27.428 --> 00:10:30.494
organism.
During development now this

00:10:30.494 --> 00:10:35.169
blastocyst has become implanted.
These cells around the outside

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:37.484
form the interface,
the placenta,

00:10:37.484 --> 00:10:41.461
where the maternal blood
circulation meets the embryonic

00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:45.729
circulation and nutrients are
passed back and forth that way

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:49.490
in a very highly regulated and
important way.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.542
This inner cell mass develops
into the embryo,

00:10:52.542 --> 00:10:56.340
which this here shown at a
later stage is beginning to be

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.409
clear that it's becoming an
organism that looks like us.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:04.172
There's a region that looks the
head, and a region that looks

00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:07.575
more like the tail.
You can see this region here is

00:11:07.575 --> 00:11:10.669
going to develop into one of the
upper limbs,

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:14.852
the arms here and the back is
different from the front,

00:11:14.852 --> 00:11:18.259
the spinal cord is developing
in the back,

00:11:18.259 --> 00:11:21.758
whereas, the structures that
become our intestinal tract is

00:11:21.758 --> 00:11:25.928
developing on the other surface.
Different kinds of polarity

00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:29.065
form, there's a head,
and there's a tail,

00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:31.497
there's a back,
there's a front,

00:11:31.497 --> 00:11:35.419
there's a left side and there's
a right side.

00:11:35.419 --> 00:11:40.199
This is one of the kinds of
differences that develop - that

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:45.062
happens during development and
cells somehow know where they

00:11:45.062 --> 00:11:49.430
are within this developing
asymmetrical organism.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.319
How does that happen?
It happens through a very

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:06.328
regulated, coordinated slow
process of what is called

00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:12.103
differentiation.
Cells move from a state of

00:12:12.103 --> 00:12:19.519
limited differentiation to a
state of more differentiation.

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:24.399
The zygote or this fertilized
egg is a completely

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:28.736
undifferentiated cell.
We'll talk about another word

00:12:28.736 --> 00:12:31.743
for this later,
but it's a cell that's going to

00:12:31.743 --> 00:12:34.490
give rise to all the cells of
our body.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:40.075
As division happens and the
developing organism acquires

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:44.522
more and more cells,
individual cells become

00:12:44.522 --> 00:12:48.852
differentiated,
they become more and more like

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:53.657
their final mature form.
Cells that are within the

00:12:53.657 --> 00:12:58.779
region that becomes the nervous
system become less like the

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:02.929
zygote and more like the cells
of our brain,

00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:06.220
neurons and glia,
and cells of the mature brain.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.260
The same way cells that form
the limb become more like muscle

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.377
cells or skin cells,
or the structures that become

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:19.328
the limb.
Well, that process occurs in a

00:13:19.328 --> 00:13:25.330
series of steps and one of those
kinds of steps is shown here.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.754
And this diagram shows what
I simply labeled as a stem cell,

00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:31.745
so I'm not referring to any
particular kind of stem cell

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:34.265
now,
but just a cell that has the

00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:37.737
stem cell character.
What does that mean to have the

00:13:37.737 --> 00:13:40.670
stem cell character?
It means that if I took this

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.010
cell and isolated and watched
it, I'd notice that it had a

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.612
couple of characteristics.
One is that it's capable of

00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:50.429
something called asymmetrical
division.

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:53.759
We talked about division last
time.

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:58.949
We talked about the parent cell
forming two identical daughter

00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:02.273
cells.
An asymmetrical division is not

00:14:02.273 --> 00:14:07.218
like that, it's when a parent
cell forms two cells that are

00:14:07.218 --> 00:14:11.634
different in some way.
That difference has functional

00:14:11.634 --> 00:14:15.670
consequences for the daughter
cells in that one of the

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.630
daughter cells becomes what's
called here a committed

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.196
progenitor cell.
It's no longer a stem cell but

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.360
it's a progenitor cell.
A progenitor cell,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.247
the definition,
it just means it can generate

00:14:30.247 --> 00:14:35.460
the cells that are typical of
that tissue or that organ,

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:41.929
so it's capable of becoming
these mature classes of cells.

00:14:41.929 --> 00:14:44.753
We'll talk more about this
in the context of the brain,

00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:47.480
but if we were talking about a
stem cell in the brain,

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.173
then the result of this
asymmetrical division would be a

00:14:51.173 --> 00:14:55.270
committed progenitor cell that's
capable of forming cells that

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.502
are the cell types found in the
brain and not cells that are the

00:14:59.502 --> 00:15:03.361
cell types found in the liver,
or the kidney,

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:06.039
or the spleen,
or muscle.

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:10.052
One result of this asymmetrical
division is a committed

00:15:10.052 --> 00:15:13.448
progenitor cell.
The result is a cell that's

00:15:13.448 --> 00:15:18.098
very similar but it is - very
similar to the progenitor cell -

00:15:18.098 --> 00:15:23.192
but it's exactly the stem cell.
So this stem cell division

00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:28.870
leads to another stem cell as
well as a committed progenitor

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.378
cell.
Now, the differences here may

00:15:31.378 --> 00:15:35.033
be subtle in terms of chemical
composition or if you put these

00:15:35.033 --> 00:15:38.450
cells under a microscope and
looked at their analysis.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.848
In terms of function they're
very important because this stem

00:15:42.848 --> 00:15:47.173
cell which is produced goes back
into the population of stem

00:15:47.173 --> 00:15:51.644
cells and is able to repeat this
process to form new committed

00:15:51.644 --> 00:15:55.309
progenitor cells and to form new
stem cells.

00:15:55.309 --> 00:16:01.090
That's important because one of
the attributes of stem cells is

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:06.311
that they remain at their site
and capable of reproducing

00:16:06.311 --> 00:16:09.141
themselves.
This process is called

00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:12.005
self-renewal,
so that's one important process

00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:14.998
of property stem cells,
that they're capable of

00:16:14.998 --> 00:16:18.365
self-renewal.
The other one is a committed

00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:23.226
progenitor cell that now somehow
has been changed in such a way

00:16:23.226 --> 00:16:27.852
that it's going to mature and
develop into non-stem cells or

00:16:27.852 --> 00:16:30.910
the cells that make up our
bodies,

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.275
somatic cells.
Now, what could these

00:16:33.275 --> 00:16:35.673
differences be?
They're not chromosomal

00:16:35.673 --> 00:16:39.580
differences because this is the
ordinary process of mitosis.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.106
So presumably,
these two cells have exactly

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:44.994
the same DNA content,
but something's been passed

00:16:44.994 --> 00:16:48.984
onto this one that wasn't there.
This is one of the very

00:16:48.984 --> 00:16:53.504
important areas that still is
not completely understood in

00:16:53.504 --> 00:16:56.774
stem cell biology.
What is the difference that's

00:16:56.774 --> 00:16:59.320
generated during an asymmetric
cell division?

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.389
There are types of changes that
are known.

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:06.874
Some of them are changes in the
- not the sequence of DNA,

00:17:06.874 --> 00:17:11.673
not the sequence of nucleotides
in the DNA - but the chemistry

00:17:11.673 --> 00:17:16.630
of DNA around that the way that
it's packed into a nucleus.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.583
So the access that a cell has
to certain kinds of genes,

00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:23.099
or chemical modifications of
DNA,

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.737
not chemical modifications that
change the base pairs,

00:17:26.737 --> 00:17:30.697
that would be a mutation.
That can happen but that's

00:17:30.697 --> 00:17:35.479
abnormal, but changes in maybe
the chemistry of the backbone

00:17:35.479 --> 00:17:38.640
that holds the nucleotides
together.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.226
In some cases that backbone
gets methylated and those

00:17:42.226 --> 00:17:45.605
regions of the DNA that are
methylated get treated

00:17:45.605 --> 00:17:49.329
differently by the cell than
unmethylated regions.

00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:52.511
You go on and you study
developmental biology or

00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:55.443
molecular biology,
you'll learn more about these

00:17:55.443 --> 00:17:57.753
things.
For our purpose just - these

00:17:57.753 --> 00:18:00.190
are the kinds of changes that
can happen.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.835
Or it can the kind of change we
talked about before,

00:18:02.835 --> 00:18:06.050
where during division there are
some chemicals that are trapped

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.970
in one cell and not in the
other,

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.852
and that could lead to a
difference we already talked

00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:14.288
about.
Or it could be not having to do

00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:17.786
with the cells themselves but
maybe the environment that the

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:21.442
cell finds itself in.
We talked last time about

00:18:21.442 --> 00:18:26.889
extracellular matrix and this
complex protein-carbohydrate gel

00:18:26.889 --> 00:18:32.094
that surrounds all cells.
Cell division takes place

00:18:32.094 --> 00:18:36.366
within an organism.
We'll talk in a minute about

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:41.438
stem cells that are involved in
generation of blood and they

00:18:41.438 --> 00:18:45.220
develop and they live in the
bone marrow.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.658
Well, what if this division
takes place in an environment

00:18:48.658 --> 00:18:52.526
where there's one kind of extra
cellular matrix here and another

00:18:52.526 --> 00:18:54.859
kind of extracellular matrix
here?

00:18:54.859 --> 00:18:58.074
Then this cell is going to
experience something different

00:18:58.074 --> 00:19:00.944
from this cell.
It could be those differences

00:19:00.944 --> 00:19:04.798
that they experience in their
extracellular environment that

00:19:04.798 --> 00:19:08.260
lead to their choice to either
self-renew or to become

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.240
committed.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:16.195
So that's asymmetrical
division and that's a property

00:19:16.195 --> 00:19:18.851
of stem cells.
The other property is that

00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:23.289
these committed progenitor cells
that are formed can turn into

00:19:23.289 --> 00:19:27.000
something, can turn into more
mature cell types.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.840
That process of maturation is
called differentiation.

00:19:34.819 --> 00:19:36.888
We'll talk more about that and
I've already said something

00:19:36.888 --> 00:19:37.360
about that.

00:19:41.069 --> 00:19:44.792
A capability for asymmetric
division and the production of

00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:47.665
cells that become
differentiating more mature

00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:50.670
cells, those are properties of
stem cells.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.370
Another concept that's
important in thinking about stem

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.203
cells is potential.
Potential refers to what it

00:19:58.203 --> 00:20:03.559
sounds like, 'what potential
does this committed progenitor

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:06.435
cell have?
' 'What potential does this

00:20:06.435 --> 00:20:09.718
stem cell have?'
Well, one way to think about is

00:20:09.718 --> 00:20:13.671
that upon this first division,
this asymmetric division,

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:17.839
this committed progenitor cell
has lost some potential.

00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:22.194
It's no longer capable of
self-renewal to form another

00:20:22.194 --> 00:20:25.051
stem cell.
It's gone down a path towards

00:20:25.051 --> 00:20:28.150
maturation that's very difficult
to go back up.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.990
So there's a loss of potential
in this division.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.203
This stem cell which is
reproduced still has the

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:43.029
potential to undergo asymmetric
division but this one does not.

00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:47.525
One sort of,
might be kind of simple minded,

00:20:47.525 --> 00:20:52.786
but one way to think about
potential is with the kind of

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:58.716
potential that we all experience
as we develop from newborns to

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:02.816
adults,
that a newborn child has lots

00:21:02.816 --> 00:21:06.720
of different potential.
It doesn't have every

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.119
potential, it's a boy or a girl,
it's not going to go back,

00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:15.253
but it has lots of potential in
that eventually when it becomes

00:21:15.253 --> 00:21:17.720
an adult it could become a
cellist,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.194
or a biologist,
or an auto mechanic,

00:21:20.194 --> 00:21:24.083
or a biomedical engineer,
all those potentials are still

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:26.222
there.
As you develop,

00:21:26.222 --> 00:21:30.999
as you're educated,
you retain all those potentials

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:36.921
for a certain point and then you
make choices and you lose some

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:41.317
of those potentials.
I'm unlikely to become a

00:21:41.317 --> 00:21:45.994
concert cellist at this point.
It's not impossible but it's

00:21:45.994 --> 00:21:49.745
pretty unlikely.
I've probably lost my potential

00:21:49.745 --> 00:21:54.113
to be an outstanding cellist.
You all could still do that if

00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:57.124
you decide too,
but it's going to be harder for

00:21:57.124 --> 00:22:00.789
you than if you would have
started when you were ten,

00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:05.410
so you're losing some potential
around - along the way.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.664
You're in the process of
becoming more mature,

00:22:08.664 --> 00:22:12.859
more differentiated and you're
losing potential at the same

00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:15.185
time.
The same thing with these

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:18.420
cells here, as these cells
undergo continual divisions,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.307
they're changing in ways that
make them mature,

00:22:21.307 --> 00:22:24.759
that make them more like the
mature cells of the nervous

00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:26.092
system,
for example,

00:22:26.092 --> 00:22:28.823
if that's where they end up
being but they're losing

00:22:28.823 --> 00:22:32.089
potential as they go through
that differentiation process.

00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:36.815
Now, one of the great hopes of
modern biology is that we can

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:40.819
figure out how to reverse that
process in cells.

00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:45.863
How we could take cells that
are differentiated to some

00:22:45.863 --> 00:22:49.599
extent and make them
de-differentiate,

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:53.965
to go back in the process of
differentiation so that they

00:22:53.965 --> 00:22:57.400
gain more potential.
Why would that be useful?

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.035
Well, it would be useful
because if I could take cells

00:23:01.035 --> 00:23:04.121
from the skin,
find stem cells in the skin and

00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:08.099
then de-differentiate them so
that they were now capable of

00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:10.925
becoming liver,
or brain, or things that

00:23:10.925 --> 00:23:13.696
they're not going to become in
their normal site,

00:23:13.696 --> 00:23:16.930
then that could be a very
powerful tool for medicine.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:21.556
So far our ability to
de-differentiate cells or find

00:23:21.556 --> 00:23:26.279
out how to do that is limited.
Does this make sense?

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:29.983
What is actually changing
during this process of

00:23:29.983 --> 00:23:32.961
differentiation?
What's the difference between

00:23:32.961 --> 00:23:36.017
this cell which I call a
committed progenitor cell and

00:23:36.017 --> 00:23:38.265
its offspring,
and the offspring of that

00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:40.950
offspring.
It goes - going through this

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.917
process of amplifying divisions,
every division increasing the

00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:48.688
number of cells by a factor of
two and these cells becoming

00:23:48.688 --> 00:23:51.289
more differentiated around the
way.

00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:53.597
I've shown the differences here
in terms of shape,

00:23:53.597 --> 00:23:56.234
these are shaped liked octagons
and these are shaped like

00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:58.689
squares,
but if I looked at these cells,

00:23:58.689 --> 00:24:01.980
what would I find that's really
different about them?

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.930
What's different from an
immature cell and a mature cell?

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.420
Well, it's not the DNA;
they all have the same DNA.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.128
There might be these,
what are called epigenetic

00:24:13.128 --> 00:24:16.528
differences that I mentioned
changes in the structure around

00:24:16.528 --> 00:24:18.802
DNA,
and those changes lead to

00:24:18.802 --> 00:24:22.718
differences in which fraction of
the total genes in the

00:24:22.718 --> 00:24:26.779
chromosomes are being expressed
by a particular cell.

00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:31.771
This is what makes cells
different, the number and

00:24:31.771 --> 00:24:36.049
quantity of the genes that they
express.

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:39.875
Out of all the genes that are
on the human genome which

00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:42.779
fraction is this particular cell
using,

00:24:42.779 --> 00:24:46.312
which fraction is it expressing
determines what proteins are

00:24:46.312 --> 00:24:50.118
present in the cell,
determines what work or what

00:24:50.118 --> 00:24:53.230
activities the cell can engage
in.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:25:00.512
What's changing along here is
the - what's changing along this

00:25:00.512 --> 00:25:06.960
pathway is the expression
pattern of genes in cells.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.489
Let me make this a little
bit more explicit by talking

00:25:10.489 --> 00:25:12.779
about the process of
hematopoiesis.

00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:18.160
Hematopoiesis is the process of
generating new blood cells.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:26.019
Hemato means blood and poiesis
means generation or formation.

00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:29.379
You know probably that within
your bone marrows there's

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:32.427
populations of cells,
there are different kinds of

00:25:32.427 --> 00:25:35.968
cells within the bone marrow.
Some of them have the

00:25:35.968 --> 00:25:40.432
capability of becoming red blood
cells which carry oxygen in the

00:25:40.432 --> 00:25:42.404
blood.
Some of them have the

00:25:42.404 --> 00:25:45.900
capability of becoming white
blood cells, or leukocytes,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.759
of which there are many
different subsets.

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:53.545
Some are called neutrophils and
those are responsible for

00:25:53.545 --> 00:25:57.618
fighting infection.
Some are called lymphocytes,

00:25:57.618 --> 00:26:00.059
B-lymphocytes,
T-lymphocytes.

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:03.361
We're going to talk about those
in more detail in a couple of

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:06.607
weeks when we talk about the
immune system because these are

00:26:06.607 --> 00:26:09.633
the cells that perform and
regulate the functions of our

00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:12.329
immune system that protect us
from disease.

00:26:12.329 --> 00:26:16.994
Some form what are called
megakaryocytes which become

00:26:16.994 --> 00:26:21.299
platelets, which are responsible
for clotting,

00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:26.233
for forming a barrier if your
circulatory system gets injured

00:26:26.233 --> 00:26:30.134
so you don't bleed.
All these cells come from

00:26:30.134 --> 00:26:34.484
the bone marrow and biologists
have traced the formation of

00:26:34.484 --> 00:26:38.893
these cells in great detail.
In fact, of all the systems of

00:26:38.893 --> 00:26:42.574
cellular differentiation that
are known in our bodies,

00:26:42.574 --> 00:26:45.630
probably hematopoiesis is the
best known.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.770
It was the first place where
the concept of stem cells was

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:54.273
developed, in that if one looks
carefully one can find immature

00:26:54.273 --> 00:26:58.716
cells in the bone marrow.
If you isolate those immature

00:26:58.716 --> 00:27:02.502
cells, some of them are less
mature than others,

00:27:02.502 --> 00:27:06.369
some of them have more
potential than others.

00:27:06.369 --> 00:27:09.474
For example,
if I isolated this one called

00:27:09.474 --> 00:27:12.805
the myeloid cell,
it's capable of forming red

00:27:12.805 --> 00:27:16.440
blood cells, megakaryocytes and
neutrophils.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.684
It's capable of forming all
these different cells but it's

00:27:19.684 --> 00:27:21.789
not capable of forming
lymphocytes.

00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:27.279
Another stem cell called the
lymphoid stem cell is capable of

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:32.622
forming the B and T lymphocytes.
Through many decades of

00:27:32.622 --> 00:27:37.667
study, biologists have teased
out certain populations of cells

00:27:37.667 --> 00:27:42.712
within the bone marrow that are
capable of reproducing subsets

00:27:42.712 --> 00:27:43.870
of cells.

00:27:50.019 --> 00:27:54.541
Now, in the process of doing
that they found some very rare

00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:58.828
stem cells that are called
pluripotent, pluri just means

00:27:58.828 --> 00:28:02.566
many potencies.
Pluripotent stem cells that are

00:28:02.566 --> 00:28:06.423
capable of self-renewal to
generate themselves and are

00:28:06.423 --> 00:28:10.789
capable of dividing into both
bioloid and lymphoid progenitor

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:13.282
cells.
This is an example of that

00:28:13.282 --> 00:28:17.487
asymmetric division.
This pluripotent stem cell is

00:28:17.487 --> 00:28:22.771
able to self-renew and it's able
- generating committed

00:28:22.771 --> 00:28:28.740
progenitors of either the
myeloid or the lymphoid lineage.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.334
So if I got these two cells
they would be less - they would

00:28:32.334 --> 00:28:35.738
have less potential than these.
Why is it so hard to find

00:28:35.738 --> 00:28:37.724
stem cells?
I mentioned that this process

00:28:37.724 --> 00:28:40.279
has taken many decades and lots
of people studying.

00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:46.498
Why has it been so hard and why
does it continue to be difficult

00:28:46.498 --> 00:28:51.730
to identify these pluripotent
cells within tissues?

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:56.155
Well, one reason is that
they're present in very small

00:28:56.155 --> 00:28:59.330
numbers.
Of a million cells in the bone

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.529
marrow there might only be one
of these.

00:29:02.529 --> 00:29:06.614
This might be 1 in
100,000,000,000 or something

00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:09.881
like that;
don't write down the numbers

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:12.869
I'm just using that for
illustration.

00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:16.372
These cells are rare and so
it's been hard to identify them,

00:29:16.372 --> 00:29:19.568
that's part of it.
The other part of it is how do

00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:22.630
you identify them?
How do I know when I've got

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.323
this one or this one?
In this diagram I'm showing you

00:29:25.323 --> 00:29:27.789
it's easy to tell because some
are yellow, and some are pink,

00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:30.781
and some are blue but that's
not the way they come out of the

00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:33.268
bone marrow.
They're not color-coded,

00:29:33.268 --> 00:29:36.440
so how you do you find them?
How do you think?

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.486
If you were searching for
unique populations of cells

00:29:40.486 --> 00:29:44.999
within the bone marrow what
tools would you use to look for

00:29:44.999 --> 00:29:48.635
them?
How would you search for these

00:29:48.635 --> 00:29:50.713
cells?
Well, one way would be to

00:29:50.713 --> 00:29:53.889
isolate individual cells and
culture them outside the body

00:29:53.889 --> 00:29:56.554
and see what they become.
That would be a very

00:29:56.554 --> 00:29:59.921
straightforward functional way
to do it, but you could imagine

00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:03.344
that that's very labor intensive
because you've got to separate

00:30:03.344 --> 00:30:07.262
each individual cell,
and you've got to nurture it

00:30:07.262 --> 00:30:11.430
and then keep track and study
what it becomes.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.380
That turns out to be one really
important way that they do it.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.048
The other way that they
define - or find stem cells is

00:30:19.048 --> 00:30:23.962
that over the years of studying
them we've begun to recognize

00:30:23.962 --> 00:30:28.761
some of the proteins,
the specific proteins that are

00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:32.430
produced by these characteristic
cells.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.733
This cell here,
which is indicated green,

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:39.779
is different than this cell
that's colored red.

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:44.166
The difference - the real
difference is in what genes its

00:30:44.166 --> 00:30:49.022
expressing of the total number
of genes in the human genome and

00:30:49.022 --> 00:30:53.565
therefore if it's expressing
these unique - this unique set

00:30:53.565 --> 00:30:56.609
of genes.
If I could find the unique set

00:30:56.609 --> 00:31:00.098
of proteins that correspond to
those genes I could define

00:31:00.098 --> 00:31:04.084
chemically what the cell is.
It turns out that one of

00:31:04.084 --> 00:31:08.193
the places that's been very
fruitful to look for proteins

00:31:08.193 --> 00:31:12.302
that differ between cell
populations is on the surface of

00:31:12.302 --> 00:31:14.550
the cell.
We talked about the cell

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.550
membrane, the plasma membrane
separating the inside form the

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.702
outside.
I mentioned a little bit that

00:31:19.702 --> 00:31:22.723
this membrane is not just lipid
bilayer but there's also

00:31:22.723 --> 00:31:25.359
proteins that are inserted into
the membrane.

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:28.850
These proteins have functions
that are essential for life of

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.104
the cell, they transport
molecules back and forth across

00:31:32.104 --> 00:31:34.335
the membrane.
They also allow their

00:31:34.335 --> 00:31:37.894
populations of proteins on the
surface of each cell that allow

00:31:37.894 --> 00:31:40.170
it to interact with its
environment,

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:44.962
they're receptors and cell
adhesion receptors like I talked

00:31:44.962 --> 00:31:48.104
about last time.
The kinds of proteins that sit

00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:50.806
on a cell surface and form
adhesion junctions with

00:31:50.806 --> 00:31:53.342
neighboring cells,
that's one class of cells on

00:31:53.342 --> 00:31:56.370
the surface.
There are - that's one class of

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.730
proteins on the surface I'm
sorry.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.597
There are proteins that are
responsible for receiving

00:32:02.597 --> 00:32:06.027
signals, chemical signals.
There are proteins,

00:32:06.027 --> 00:32:08.864
for example,
on the surface of some cells

00:32:08.864 --> 00:32:13.119
that bind insulin and respond to
the presence of insulin.

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:16.975
We're going to talk more about
these kinds of molecules on the

00:32:16.975 --> 00:32:19.421
surface next week.
For now, just know that

00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:21.888
different kinds of cells,
one of the ways they're

00:32:21.888 --> 00:32:24.766
different is that they express
different proteins and the

00:32:24.766 --> 00:32:27.746
population of proteins on the
surface of different cells is

00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:30.576
different.
We've learned how to

00:32:30.576 --> 00:32:35.223
identify and catalog cells
according to the composition of

00:32:35.223 --> 00:32:39.951
proteins on the surface and
those proteins that distinguish

00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:43.619
a cell are often called marker
proteins.

00:32:43.619 --> 00:32:48.812
They're given names,
and we're able to - often the

00:32:48.812 --> 00:32:54.005
names are confusing,
if you look in the literature

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:58.880
you'll find proteins that are
called CD44,

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.479
CD3, these are differentiation
- cluster differentiation

00:33:02.479 --> 00:33:06.537
antigens is what CD stands for
but it really means a particular

00:33:06.537 --> 00:33:10.660
protein which is present on this
cell but not on that cell.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:17.636
So I can use the presence of
those to identify cell

00:33:17.636 --> 00:33:20.884
populations.
One reason it's been harder

00:33:20.884 --> 00:33:22.890
to identify stem cells is that
they're so rare;

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.079
the other reason is that it's
hard to identify the

00:33:26.079 --> 00:33:30.049
characteristics of them and it's
taken many years to work this

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:34.949
out.
In the matopoetic system it's

00:33:34.949 --> 00:33:40.245
the most well known.
In fact, it's so well known now

00:33:40.245 --> 00:33:44.359
that we've identified proteins
that stimulate the development

00:33:44.359 --> 00:33:49.005
of cells along certain pathways.
I talked about one of them a

00:33:49.005 --> 00:33:51.892
couple of weeks ago,
the protein epo,

00:33:51.892 --> 00:33:56.864
erythropoietin called epo is a
naturally occurring protein that

00:33:56.864 --> 00:34:01.435
is in the bone marrow and it
stimulates the development of

00:34:01.435 --> 00:34:05.388
red blood cells.
So it stimulates these myeloid

00:34:05.388 --> 00:34:07.990
cells to develop along this
pathway.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:13.130
It's a protein that's produced
by other cells in the body and

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:17.757
when it's enriched in a certain
area it stimulates more

00:34:17.757 --> 00:34:22.395
production of red blood cells.
Because we've learned about

00:34:22.395 --> 00:34:26.356
that biology we've been able to
make erythropoietin outside the

00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:30.018
body and use it as a drug.
It can be used - given to

00:34:30.018 --> 00:34:34.070
people to - who have certain
kinds of anemia to stimulate

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.760
blood cell production in a
specific kind of way.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.123
There's lots of these so called
signaling proteins that have

00:34:42.123 --> 00:34:46.138
been identified now.
These signaling proteins play

00:34:46.138 --> 00:34:50.914
important roles in determining
how many cells differentiate

00:34:50.914 --> 00:34:55.607
down particular pathways and
they turn out also to be very

00:34:55.607 --> 00:34:59.890
useful for treating diseases of
those pathways.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.132
This pluripotent stem cell
from bone marrow is an example

00:35:11.132 --> 00:35:14.040
of a stem cell,
an adult stem cell,

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.829
a stem cell that could be
identified from the blood.

00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:22.677
Different than the embryonic
stem cell we talked about

00:35:22.677 --> 00:35:26.380
before, so it's an example of an
adult stem cell.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.179
It's also an example of a
tissue specific stem cell.

00:35:30.179 --> 00:35:35.270
Those stem cells from the blood
are capable of becoming all

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:39.577
those cells in the blood.
They're not capable of becoming

00:35:39.577 --> 00:35:43.962
other kinds of cells in general.
Now, you'll hear reports in

00:35:43.962 --> 00:35:47.257
the literature,
you'll look in the newspaper,

00:35:47.257 --> 00:35:51.077
you'll hear about scientists
that have found ways to

00:35:51.077 --> 00:35:55.095
trans-differentiate cells,
that is move them from one

00:35:55.095 --> 00:35:58.157
pathway to the other.
To find stem cells that they

00:35:58.157 --> 00:36:00.829
can move from one kind of
pathway to another.

00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:04.349
That's been looking at - blood
stem cells has been a very

00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:08.267
fruitful way to look for that.
There are some ways that you

00:36:08.267 --> 00:36:11.742
can take stem cells that
normally would only produce

00:36:11.742 --> 00:36:14.739
blood cells and maintain them in
culture,

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:17.335
expose them to certain regimens
of chemicals,

00:36:17.335 --> 00:36:20.521
do certain manipulations on
these cells and they become

00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:23.975
capable of producing liver,
for example,

00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:28.687
or brain, or muscle.
That's a lot of the literature

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:32.174
of stem cells that you'll read
about, taking a particular

00:36:32.174 --> 00:36:35.536
source of stem cell and
nurturing it in such a way that

00:36:35.536 --> 00:36:39.147
it gains potentials that it
didn't have necessarily when it

00:36:39.147 --> 00:36:42.966
was in the body,
or exploiting those potentials

00:36:42.966 --> 00:36:45.989
that it wouldn't necessarily
express.

00:36:45.989 --> 00:36:53.820
That's a lot of what stem cell
biology is like - is about.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.681
This diagram here sort of
allows me to walk you through

00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:03.794
some of the terminology of this
stem cell development and talk

00:37:03.794 --> 00:37:07.607
about these concepts.
Again, in the context of a

00:37:07.607 --> 00:37:10.909
specific tissue site,
in this case it's the nervous

00:37:10.909 --> 00:37:13.117
system.
We started the discussion

00:37:13.117 --> 00:37:16.090
talking about the zygote or the
fertilized egg.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:20.948
There's only one source for
that, there's only one source of

00:37:20.948 --> 00:37:25.133
that fertilized egg.
It's not self-renewing,

00:37:25.133 --> 00:37:31.222
in that division of the zygote
results in two daughter cells

00:37:31.222 --> 00:37:36.898
that are no longer the zygote
anymore, they're down some

00:37:36.898 --> 00:37:40.093
pathway.
One way of referring to this

00:37:40.093 --> 00:37:43.204
cell is in terms of its
potential and the zygote

00:37:43.204 --> 00:37:47.308
obviously has the potential of
becoming all of the cells of our

00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:49.055
body.
That's where they all come

00:37:49.055 --> 00:37:50.599
from, they all come from the
zygote.

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:55.480
The word for that is
totipotent, totally potent.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.395
It has the capability of
becoming any kind of cell within

00:37:58.395 --> 00:38:00.530
the body, in fact,
that's what it does.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.570
Further down the line,
for example,

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.929
in the blastocyst I talked
about before,

00:38:06.929 --> 00:38:11.148
we could obtain cells from this
inner cell mass or this cluster

00:38:11.148 --> 00:38:13.530
of cells that becomes the
embryo.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.809
Those are called embryonic stem
cells, they are self-renewing,

00:38:17.809 --> 00:38:21.107
and they are pluripotent,
meaning they have many

00:38:21.107 --> 00:38:24.367
potencies.
That's why people are so

00:38:24.367 --> 00:38:29.683
excited about embryonic stem
cells because in nature they

00:38:29.683 --> 00:38:33.099
become all the cells of the
body.

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:38.239
If we understood them well
enough we could potentially make

00:38:38.239 --> 00:38:43.643
any particular kind of cell in
the body from those pluripotent

00:38:43.643 --> 00:38:46.171
cells.
They're controversial,

00:38:46.171 --> 00:38:50.423
I think for obvious reasons,
because you have to sacrifice

00:38:50.423 --> 00:38:56.798
an embryo in order to get them.
Further down this line here

00:38:56.798 --> 00:39:03.360
are embryonic - or let's say
adult brain stem cells.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.943
These are cells that I - that
were obtained either from a more

00:39:07.943 --> 00:39:11.400
developed embryo,
past the blastocyst stage.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.396
For example,
that embryo that I showed on

00:39:13.396 --> 00:39:16.291
one of the first slides where
there's clearly a head region

00:39:16.291 --> 00:39:19.063
and a tail region.
Now I isolated these cells

00:39:19.063 --> 00:39:22.797
maybe from the head region of
the embryo, the region that's

00:39:22.797 --> 00:39:26.555
going to develop into the brain,
so that would be a good place

00:39:26.555 --> 00:39:29.772
to look if you wanted cells that
were going to develop into the

00:39:29.772 --> 00:39:32.559
brain.
They're capable of self-renewal.

00:39:32.559 --> 00:39:36.117
They're not quite as potent as
the cells from earlier because

00:39:36.117 --> 00:39:38.369
they've now differentiated
somewhat.

00:39:38.369 --> 00:39:41.731
They might be capable of
forming all of the cells of the

00:39:41.731 --> 00:39:44.227
nervous system;
they might still have some

00:39:44.227 --> 00:39:47.692
potency to form other things
that are similar to the nervous

00:39:47.692 --> 00:39:50.105
system.
Maybe they could make skin,

00:39:50.105 --> 00:39:53.892
maybe they could make other
kinds of cells if you treated

00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:56.975
them the right way.
So they've lost some

00:39:56.975 --> 00:40:00.645
capabilities but not many,
and these are called

00:40:00.645 --> 00:40:04.311
multipotent stem cells.
They still have broad potential

00:40:04.311 --> 00:40:07.650
and they're self-renewing and so
there's much interest in those.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.356
Easiest to find them in embryos
but sometimes they can be found

00:40:11.356 --> 00:40:15.023
in adult organisms as well.
If you go to the right region

00:40:15.023 --> 00:40:19.156
of an adult brain you might be
able to find cells like this but

00:40:19.156 --> 00:40:22.916
it's more difficult.
As we've found cells from adult

00:40:22.916 --> 00:40:26.937
organisms that seem to be
multipotential and studied them

00:40:26.937 --> 00:40:31.029
more carefully,
some of their potentials turn

00:40:31.029 --> 00:40:35.469
out to be lost,
they're not exactly the same.

00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:38.694
Further down the line here,
if we looked in the adult brain

00:40:38.694 --> 00:40:41.919
or spinal cord and other regions
we'd find committed progenitor

00:40:41.919 --> 00:40:45.003
cells.
These are cells that are

00:40:45.003 --> 00:40:48.849
committed to become nervous
tissue.

00:40:48.849 --> 00:40:53.412
They might self-renew they
might not, they have much more

00:40:53.412 --> 00:40:57.552
limited potential than before.
You're starting to see the

00:40:57.552 --> 00:41:00.913
pattern as I move further and
further away from the embryo

00:41:00.913 --> 00:41:03.920
from less differentiated to more
differentiated,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.236
from non-specific regions to
more specific regions,

00:41:08.236 --> 00:41:13.242
I'm getting cells that are
easier to obtain because you can

00:41:13.242 --> 00:41:18.163
obtain them from adult sources
but their potential as stem

00:41:18.163 --> 00:41:22.366
cells is more limited.
There are a couple of

00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:26.367
tissues that are of particular
interest to scientists and

00:41:26.367 --> 00:41:29.940
clinicians now and bone marrow
is one of those.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.060
There's a lot of interest in
bone marrow and the stem cells

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.290
that come from bone marrow and
there's a couple of reasons for

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.038
this.
One is because we understand

00:41:36.038 --> 00:41:39.028
the bone marrow system so much
better than we understand all

00:41:39.028 --> 00:41:42.573
the other stem cell systems.
The other is that it's possible

00:41:42.573 --> 00:41:45.820
to get stem cells from patients,
from bone marrow.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.775
You can collect bone marrow,
it's not a procedure that you

00:41:48.775 --> 00:41:51.663
would want to do.
It involves putting a needle,

00:41:51.663 --> 00:41:55.404
a fairly large needle into
usually one of the pelvic bones

00:41:55.404 --> 00:41:59.014
and collecting marrow from -
which is tissue that's deep

00:41:59.014 --> 00:42:02.382
inside those bones.
It's not as easy as getting

00:42:02.382 --> 00:42:05.900
your blood drawn if you give
blood to the Red Cross,

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.664
for example,
but it can be done very safely

00:42:08.664 --> 00:42:12.613
and wouldn't it be great if we
could identify stem cells that

00:42:12.613 --> 00:42:16.563
were multipotent from that bone
marrow because you could find

00:42:16.563 --> 00:42:20.380
them potentially for - if I
needed a treatment that could -

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.527
if I had some ailment that could
be treated with stem cells then

00:42:24.527 --> 00:42:28.411
you could get my own - I could
get my own stem cells and use

00:42:28.411 --> 00:42:31.728
them.
Or maybe I could donate bone

00:42:31.728 --> 00:42:36.202
marrow and those stem cells
could be given to other people

00:42:36.202 --> 00:42:40.677
in the same way that blood can
be given to other people by

00:42:40.677 --> 00:42:45.230
matching and making sure that
immunologically my cells were

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.651
compatible with you;
there's a lot of interest in

00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:50.588
that.
There's a lot of interest

00:42:50.588 --> 00:42:54.135
in obtaining stem cells from the
blood of the umbilical cord on

00:42:54.135 --> 00:42:57.126
birth.
It turns out that blood within

00:42:57.126 --> 00:43:01.832
the umbilical cord is also a
rich source of stem cells and

00:43:01.832 --> 00:43:05.300
again specific to a particular
patient.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.921
There are services now,
we don't know yet how to get

00:43:07.921 --> 00:43:10.850
those stem cells out of cord
blood and how to use them for

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.190
therapies,
but it's reasonable to think

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.679
that we might know about this in
30 years.

00:43:15.679 --> 00:43:20.165
So some parents now are
choosing to save the cord blood,

00:43:20.165 --> 00:43:23.753
have it frozen,
locked away somewhere just in

00:43:23.753 --> 00:43:27.750
case its useful to their child
later in life.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.851
I'm not endorsing that I'm just
saying that that's something

00:43:30.851 --> 00:43:34.222
that can be done now.
I digressed a little from

00:43:34.222 --> 00:43:38.623
this diagram but I think you've
gotten the picture that as I

00:43:38.623 --> 00:43:42.890
move to more adult organisms,
as I move to more specific

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.276
regions of the brain,
for example,

00:43:45.276 --> 00:43:49.760
I can still find progenitor
cells that have some potential.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.526
It's harder to find,
they're more limited numbers,

00:43:53.526 --> 00:43:57.061
and in general,
more difficult until eventually

00:43:57.061 --> 00:44:01.519
down this pathway you have fully
differentiated cells,

00:44:01.519 --> 00:44:05.733
cells that are fully mature and
performing the function of the

00:44:05.733 --> 00:44:08.652
mature organ.
The two largest populations of

00:44:08.652 --> 00:44:12.228
cells within the brain are
neurons, the ones that actually

00:44:12.228 --> 00:44:15.741
transmit electrical activity and
responsible for the main

00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:19.130
functions we think of when we
think of the brain,

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:22.800
and supporting cells called
glia, which are responsible for

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.597
sort of creating the right sort
of environment for neurons to

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:27.420
function.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:34.960
I wanted to talk about one
last concept and this is one the

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.911
boxes from Chapter 5 and you've
already been using this in your

00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:41.853
homework.
I just wanted to talk about one

00:44:41.853 --> 00:44:45.739
last concept and that has to do
with cell proliferation.

00:44:45.739 --> 00:44:50.869
We've been talking about single
cell or some subset of cells and

00:44:50.869 --> 00:44:56.079
propagating them so that you get
a larger population of cells.

00:44:56.079 --> 00:44:58.389
Of course this happens all the
time in the body.

00:44:58.389 --> 00:45:00.831
There are cells within your
body that are always in the

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:02.820
process of division and forming
new cells,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.349
and sometimes this is for a
tissue where cells only have a

00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:10.357
finite lifetime.
The red blood cells that carry

00:45:10.357 --> 00:45:13.355
oxygen only live within your
circulation for about a month

00:45:13.355 --> 00:45:16.352
and so you have to continually
be replacing cells that are

00:45:16.352 --> 00:45:19.349
dying and so there are cells
that are proliferating.

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:23.320
Cell proliferation is a
huge issue in cell culture.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:29.063
One of the main things that we
use cell culture or maintenance

00:45:29.063 --> 00:45:35.090
of cells outside the body for is
to make more copies of cells.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:38.081
One of the purposes of cell
culture is to make many,

00:45:38.081 --> 00:45:41.013
many more cells under
controlled conditions where I

00:45:41.013 --> 00:45:43.360
can understand what those cells
are.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.399
So, in general,
when cells are proliferating

00:45:46.399 --> 00:45:50.500
they're dividing and they're
dividing at a regular rate.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.450
What that means is that one way
to describe that mathematically

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:57.351
is shown here.
If X is the number of

00:45:57.351 --> 00:46:01.250
cells, then the rate of change
of X, dX/dt,

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:05.584
the rate of change of the cell
population, how fast division is

00:46:05.584 --> 00:46:09.430
taking is proportional to the
number of cells I have.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:13.256
This makes sense;
the rate at which the cell

00:46:13.256 --> 00:46:16.864
population is growing,
the derivative dX/dt,

00:46:16.864 --> 00:46:20.400
is proportional to the number
of cells I have.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.761
The more cells I have the
faster they can grow,

00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:28.350
fewer cells grows more slowly.
This is an example of an

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:33.174
exponential growth process and
you're familiar with processes

00:46:33.174 --> 00:46:36.146
like these.
If you solve this differential

00:46:36.146 --> 00:46:39.285
equation, which you don't need
to do for the course,

00:46:39.285 --> 00:46:42.170
but I show it here;
some of you will understand

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.570
immediately where this comes
from, that means that the number

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.573
of cells I have at any
particular time is equal to the

00:46:48.573 --> 00:46:51.690
number of cells that I have at
some starting time,

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:56.176
times e to the power,
µ here,

00:46:56.176 --> 00:47:00.942
where - and it should be
µt--looks like

00:47:00.942 --> 00:47:06.099
there's a typo in the book,
you can't see it here,

00:47:06.099 --> 00:47:12.160
maybe, so e^(µt)
or this constant times time.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.119
This constant µ
which is the

00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:18.077
proportionality constant between
the number of cells and the rate

00:47:18.077 --> 00:47:20.712
of growth is a constant that
characterizes how fast a cell

00:47:20.712 --> 00:47:23.689
population is growing.
Some will be growing very

00:47:23.689 --> 00:47:26.594
rapidly, some will be growing
less rapidly,

00:47:26.594 --> 00:47:30.605
and what this equation shows
you here is how to relate that

00:47:30.605 --> 00:47:34.761
growth constant µ
or that rate of growth the

00:47:34.761 --> 00:47:37.868
doubling time of cells.
How long does it take for the

00:47:37.868 --> 00:47:41.036
population of cells to double?
One of the interesting

00:47:41.036 --> 00:47:45.381
properties of cells that are in
exponential growth is that the

00:47:45.381 --> 00:47:49.797
time to increase the cell number
by a factor of 2 is always the

00:47:49.797 --> 00:47:52.470
same.
That makes sense if you think

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:55.242
about this process of cell
multiplication,

00:47:55.242 --> 00:47:58.960
that I have one cell it becomes
2 cells in a minute,

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.939
it could become 4 cells in
another minute,

00:48:02.939 --> 00:48:08.278
it could become 8 cells in
another minute and that's all

00:48:08.278 --> 00:48:12.840
that this set of equations is
representing.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.010
Questions about that?

00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:19.000
Good, I'll see you in section
this afternoon.

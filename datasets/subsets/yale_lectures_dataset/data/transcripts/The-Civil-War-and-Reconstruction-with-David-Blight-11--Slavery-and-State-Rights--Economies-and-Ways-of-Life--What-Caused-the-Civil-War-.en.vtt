00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.710
Professor David Blight:
So what caused the Civil War?

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:14.120
Somebody said "slavery."
Can I hear a "states' rights?"

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.660
Can I hear a "conflicting
civilizations?"

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.840
Can I hear "unctuous fury?"
Can I hear "fanaticism?"

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.390
Can I hear "fear?"
Can I hear "stupidity?"

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.880
Can I hear "Goddamn Yankees?"

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.596
Or Jefferson Davis may have
captured the kind of toxin that

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:48.260
was in the air,
around southern secession,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.031
in late 1860 and into this
"distracted, sad year," as

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:57.250
Whitman called it,
of 1861.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.565
Jefferson Davis,
soon to be the first

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:03.038
president--only president--of
the Confederate States of

00:01:03.038 --> 00:01:06.986
America;
senator--former senator--from

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:11.430
Mississippi;
former commandant of West Point;

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.070
former Secretary of War.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.365
He tried to capture what the
South was doing with secession

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:21.989
with a certain dignified reserve
here.

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:26.831
This is at the very end of
1860, before Mississippi had

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:32.227
seceded, but it's not far away.
He said, the South now,

00:01:32.227 --> 00:01:36.360
quote, "is confronted by a
common foe.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.531
The South should,
by the instinct of

00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.340
self-preservation,
be united.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.828
The recent declarations of the
candidate and leaders of the

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:50.609
black Republican Party,"
--and southerners made

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.192
no--missed no opportunity to
rename the Republican Party a

00:01:55.192 --> 00:02:01.430
thousand times,
"the Black Republican Party."

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.201
At any rate,
"The recent declaration of the

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:07.831
candidate and leaders of the
Black Republican Party must

00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:11.330
suffice to convince many who
have formerly doubted the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.629
purpose to attack the
institution of slavery in the

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.971
states.
The undying opposition to

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.299
slavery in the United States
means war upon it,

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.780
where it is,
not where it is not."

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.450
That is, the Republicans did
not simply oppose slavery in the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.810
territories, they opposed
slavery in the slave states,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.379
and they would not stop until
they had obliterated it.

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.189
"And the time is at hand when
the great battle is to be fought

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.683
between the defenders of the
constitutional government and

00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:54.220
the votaries of mob rule,
fanaticism and anarchy."

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.794
Yes.
Davis seemed to think a little

00:02:59.794 --> 00:03:02.817
bit was at stake,
for the South,

00:03:02.817 --> 00:03:07.151
in 1861.
However, after the war,

00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:14.242
Jefferson Davis wrote what is
probably the longest,

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:19.553
most turgid,
belabored, 1200 page defense of

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:25.510
a failed political revolution in
the history of language.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:33.446
1,279 pages is his memoir,
entitled The Rise and Fall

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:36.349
of the Confederate
Government.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.595
And by the time he wrote that,
or published it,

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:44.009
in 1882, he was arguing
everywhere,

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:48.200
on storied, famous,
legendary tours of the South,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.740
the war had absolutely nothing
to do with slavery.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.334
Listen to just one passage of
that 1200 page defense of his

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:04.979
Constitutional Movement.
"Slavery," said Jeff Davis,

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:10.756
by 1882, "was in no wise the
cause of the conflict but only

00:04:10.756 --> 00:04:13.255
an incident.
Generally

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:19.179
African-American"--excuse
me--"Generally Africans were

00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:23.649
born the slaves of barbarian
masters,

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:27.341
untaught in all the useful arts
and occupations,

00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:32.279
reared in heathen darkness,
and sold by heathen masters.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:37.206
They were transferred to shores
enlightened by the rays of

00:04:37.206 --> 00:04:41.730
Christianity."
Now he goes on, and I quote him.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.488
Blacks, said Jeff Davis,
had been, quote,

00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:50.365
"put to servitude,
trained in the gentle arts of

00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:52.629
peace and order and
civilization.

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.682
They increased from a few
unprofitable savages to millions

00:04:56.682 --> 00:05:01.197
of efficient Christian laborers.
Their servile instincts

00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:06.304
rendered them contented with
their lot, and their patient

00:05:06.304 --> 00:05:12.050
toil blessed the land of their
abode with unmeasured riches.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.111
Their strong local and personal
attachments secured faithful

00:05:15.111 --> 00:05:18.383
service.
Never was there happier

00:05:18.383 --> 00:05:24.009
dependents of labor and capital
on each other.

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.920
The tempter came,
like the Serpent of Eden,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.389
and decoyed them with the magic
word, freedom.

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.888
He put arms in their hands and
trained their humble but

00:05:36.888 --> 00:05:41.470
emotional natures to deeds of
violence and bloodshed,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.389
and sent them out to devastate
their benefactors."

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.144
Now I could go on and on with
this particular,

00:05:50.144 --> 00:05:54.238
incredible passage.
What you have there in that

00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:59.543
1882 passage is the core,
the life blood of the Lost

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:01.520
Cause tradition.

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.956
In 1861--and you've read
Charles Dew's book on this--in

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:13.960
1861 southern leadership,
at least until after Fort

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.670
Sumter, argued every day and
every way that they were about

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.298
the business of preserving a
slave society--a civilization

00:06:23.298 --> 00:06:28.161
based on slave labor,
a racial system ordered by

00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:35.040
slavery--now threatened by these
anti-slavery black Republicans.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.668
In the wake of the Civil War,
however, so much energy will be

00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:44.139
exercised, not only by
southerners,

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:50.577
over time, to try to convince
the American people and the rest

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:56.170
of the world that this event was
not about slavery.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.493
In a speech in 1878--like many
other speeches he gave in the

00:07:00.493 --> 00:07:04.010
last third of his
life--Frederick Douglass was at

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.335
that point,
1878, already fed up with Lost

00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:13.819
Cause arguments about what the
war had been about.

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.796
He was also already,
early in the process,

00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:20.862
fed up with the ways in which
Americans were beginning to

00:07:20.862 --> 00:07:25.209
reconcile this bloody,
terrible conflict around the

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:30.128
mutual valor of soldiers,
and in his view forgetting what

00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:34.959
the whole terrible thing might
have even been about.

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:39.282
And at the end of a magnificent
speech he gave at a veterans

00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:42.579
reunion he said this:
"The Civil War"--this is

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:46.901
Frederick Douglass--"was not a
fight between rapacious birds

00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:51.356
and ferocious beasts,
a mere display of brute courage

00:07:51.356 --> 00:07:54.631
and endurance,
it was a war between men of

00:07:54.631 --> 00:07:57.161
thought,
as well as of action,

00:07:57.161 --> 00:08:00.541
and in dead earnest for
something beyond the

00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:01.800
battlefield."

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:10.704
He went on and on and on then
to declare that the war had been

00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:15.090
about ideas, and he described
the difference between those

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.071
ideas,
as he put it,

00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:21.545
was the difference between,
quote, "barbarism and

00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:23.130
civilization."

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.889
Now, I'm going to spend this
lecture just reflecting with you

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:34.968
on, first, secession,
because I left you hanging in

00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:39.700
the air about the various
explanations of secession,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.559
interpretations over time;
and I want to re-visit that at

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.316
least briefly.
And then I want to take you

00:08:46.316 --> 00:08:50.857
through a little quick survey of
the interpretations of Civil War

00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:54.533
causation over time.
It's fascinating to understand

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:57.394
how in the past,
now nearly a century and a

00:08:57.394 --> 00:09:00.884
half,
Americans have gone through

00:09:00.884 --> 00:09:04.919
this topsy-turvy,
twisting inside out,

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:09.390
changing view of what caused
that war.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.610
But back to secession.
I left off with saying I was

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.009
going to offer you five
different explanations.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:19.416
I don't think they're all
equal, necessarily,

00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:23.551
but they're there.
In some ways they kind of fold

00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:27.418
into one another.
And I'd already talked about

00:09:27.418 --> 00:09:32.039
how the preservation of slavery,
a slave society,

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:35.872
a society ordered by slave
labor and so forth,

00:09:35.872 --> 00:09:39.279
was a principle,
if not the principle,

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:42.937
purpose of this secession
movement, at least in the Deep

00:09:42.937 --> 00:09:45.965
South, where it succeeded.
Remember now,

00:09:45.965 --> 00:09:50.896
there are still eight slave
states that have not seceded

00:09:50.896 --> 00:09:54.425
from the Union.
As of March 1861,

00:09:54.425 --> 00:10:00.510
when Lincoln was to be
inaugurated, the majority of the

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.919
slave states are still in the
Union, not out;

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:08.345
only South Carolina over to
Texas, the

00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:12.277
whatever-color-that-is of the
Deep South, was the Confederate

00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:16.195
States of America.
Had it remained only those

00:10:16.195 --> 00:10:20.765
seven states it's hard to
imagine exactly how the

00:10:20.765 --> 00:10:25.049
Confederacy would've mounted a
war effort,

00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:30.447
conducted and created a foreign
policy, and managed if the

00:10:30.447 --> 00:10:35.939
Lincoln government decides on
war--or coercion as the South

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:40.957
will call it--it's hard to
imagine how the Confederacy

00:10:40.957 --> 00:10:45.309
would've survived,
as long as it did.

00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:48.248
The four states that will join
it--we'll come to this on

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:50.972
Thursday--do not secede,
of course, until after Fort

00:10:50.972 --> 00:10:53.456
Sumter.
Virginia, North Carolina,

00:10:53.456 --> 00:10:57.248
Tennessee, and Arkansas,
in their initial secession

00:10:57.248 --> 00:11:02.061
legislatures or conventions,
either did not--chose not to

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:06.896
vote, or voted secession down,
which Virginia decisively

00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:11.691
did--before Fort Sumter.
And it's only after the firing

00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:15.970
on Fort Sumter in April of '61
that Virginia will vote

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.020
secession;
and it's crucial,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.432
of course, given it's--that
it's Virginia,

00:11:20.432 --> 00:11:24.503
and the size of Virginia,
the significance and symbolism

00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:28.542
and power of Virginia,
the geographical location of

00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:32.086
Virginia and so on.
A second explanation of

00:11:32.086 --> 00:11:36.310
secession though is what I would
call the fear thesis;

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.767
fear of many kinds.
And now this is,

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:42.756
now, of course,
deeply related to the first

00:11:42.756 --> 00:11:45.455
explanation of preserving a
slave society but in some ways

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.664
this was a racial fear as well.
If you look into those

00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:52.289
secession conventions,
and if you look deeply into all

00:11:52.289 --> 00:11:56.324
those quotations in Charles
Dew's book--and he loads them on

00:11:56.324 --> 00:12:00.496
you doesn't he?--there's an even
more immediate kind of racial

00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:03.299
fear among southern
secessionists,

00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:06.755
that they live on the potential
of a racial powder keg,

00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:10.019
of the potential of slave
insurrection over time,

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:17.843
especially if the South and if
slavery continues to shrink

00:12:17.843 --> 00:12:22.071
within itself.
There's the phrase they kept

00:12:22.071 --> 00:12:25.916
returning to in Abraham
Lincoln's House Divided Speech

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:28.679
from 1858.
They never let him forget it,

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:31.377
that he and the Republican
Party, they said,

00:12:31.377 --> 00:12:34.953
were going to put slavery on a,
quote, "course of ultimate

00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:37.700
extinction."
That's fairly clear isn't it?

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.398
"We're going to make your
system extinct--how do you like

00:12:42.398 --> 00:12:46.590
that?"
"Oh, not a problem."

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:52.509
Fear of the radicalism,
now of John Brown.

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:56.260
John Brown had sort of made
this equation,

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:01.840
that had always been there in
the southern mind in vague ways,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.547
explicit.
If the Republican Party in the

00:13:05.547 --> 00:13:10.415
North had succeeded in selling
this slogan of a slave-power

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:13.386
conspiracy,
well southerners now,

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:16.722
the planter class and the
secessionists,

00:13:16.722 --> 00:13:21.286
are very successful,
especially in the wake of John

00:13:21.286 --> 00:13:24.489
Brown's raid,
of selling a mutual or a

00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:28.559
counter-conspiracy theory.
And that conspiracy simply is

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:31.588
"abolition emissaries."
There are lots of labels it

00:13:31.588 --> 00:13:35.065
goes by but the idea that if the
Republican politicians

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:38.994
themselves aren't going to lead
bands into the South to attack

00:13:38.994 --> 00:13:42.967
the South,
they will end up nevertheless

00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:48.775
politically stimulating more and
more John Browns to make

00:13:48.775 --> 00:13:54.095
visitations on the South.
All over the rhetoric of

00:13:54.095 --> 00:13:59.931
secession you find the language
of--or the word frankly--of

00:13:59.931 --> 00:14:03.659
submission;
submission, we will not submit

00:14:03.659 --> 00:14:06.553
and so on.
Let me give you just one

00:14:06.553 --> 00:14:07.320
example.

00:14:11.009 --> 00:14:12.114
In Charleston,
South Carolina,

00:14:12.114 --> 00:14:14.476
the editor of its most radical
newspaper, its most secessionist

00:14:14.476 --> 00:14:17.212
newspaper,
was a man named Robert Rhett,

00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:20.250
the Charleston
Courier--I'm sorry,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.806
the Charleston Mercury
is what he edited--and he ran a

00:14:24.806 --> 00:14:28.299
series of articles under the
heading the,

00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:33.559
quote, "Terrors of Submission,"
during the secession winter.

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:37.094
And in one of those pieces
Robert Rhett wrote,

00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:40.315
and I quote:
"If the South once submits to

00:14:40.315 --> 00:14:44.949
the rule of abolitionists by the
general government there is

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:49.820
probably an end of all peaceful
separation of the Union.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:55.547
We can only escape the ruin
they meditate for the South by

00:14:55.547 --> 00:14:58.387
war.
The ruin of the South by the

00:14:58.387 --> 00:15:03.101
emancipation of her slaves is
not like the ruin of any other

00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:05.844
people.
It is not a mere loss of

00:15:05.844 --> 00:15:09.570
liberty, but it is a loss of
liberty, property,

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.810
home, country,
everything that makes life

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.350
worth living."

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.769
Rhett was full of some unctuous
fury, without a doubt.

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:27.575
There were southern
secessionists who absolutely

00:15:27.575 --> 00:15:31.785
believed that even any
discussion of slavery's future

00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:36.040
in the U.S.
Congress should be suppressed,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:42.122
that they would no longer live
in a union that even discussed

00:15:42.122 --> 00:15:46.379
what to do about the future of
slavery.

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:52.084
And I would say there's not
only a kind of racial fear,

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:57.259
a fear of loss of slavery by
the planter class,

00:15:57.259 --> 00:16:00.762
but there's a certain kind of
political fear going on as well,

00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:03.919
and that is the fear that
southern polls now had--they'd

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:06.750
had this for years,
hadn't they?

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:11.858
The fear was the growing,
or the growth now for them of a

00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:15.697
kind of minority status,
that that Republican Party in

00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:18.684
the North now had the potential,
given the population of the

00:16:18.684 --> 00:16:20.015
North,
this sectional,

00:16:20.015 --> 00:16:22.699
anti-slavery party,
had the potential to really

00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:25.150
take over the House of
Representatives,

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.846
in huge numbers.
Then you get Lincoln in the

00:16:27.846 --> 00:16:29.979
White House for four years--and
what if you get him for

00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:31.559
eight?--and he appoints the next
two,

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:34.372
three, four,
five members of the Supreme

00:16:34.372 --> 00:16:36.022
Court.
And he can control the

00:16:36.022 --> 00:16:38.898
diplomatic corps around the
world, and even more importantly

00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:41.529
he can control patronage of the
post office system,

00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:43.810
which in those years,
believe it or not,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.392
was very powerful;
nobody gives a hoot about who

00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:51.470
runs the post offices now but
boy they did then.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.570
And what was at stake?
And we can see this all over

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.544
their letters and their diaries,
their speeches in secession

00:16:58.544 --> 00:17:01.669
conventions,
was a loss ultimately for the

00:17:01.669 --> 00:17:06.652
slaveholding class of what James
Roark and other scholars have

00:17:06.652 --> 00:17:11.859
called "planter control."
So to say secession is about

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:16.863
slavery is accurate,
but there are layers beneath

00:17:16.863 --> 00:17:21.660
it, in what I'd call a kind of
fear thesis.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.790
A third explanation is what we
might call--or a motivation for

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.650
southern secession--we might
call southern nationalism,

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.973
a sense of southern unity,
a dream for some southern

00:17:33.973 --> 00:17:38.636
secessionists--they were a
minority surely over time and

00:17:38.636 --> 00:17:43.187
they're even a minority,
I think, in the midst of the

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:48.009
secession crisis--but a dream
over time of a southern nation,

00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:51.906
an independence,
of developing their own

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:57.301
boundaries and their own
potential expansionist foreign

00:17:57.301 --> 00:18:00.661
policy,
where they would no longer ever

00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:04.599
be dependent on the United
States Federal Government,

00:18:04.599 --> 00:18:07.700
on one compromise after another
with northerners.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.481
And now to many southern
secessionists it would be

00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:15.572
compromises with people they
couldn't even conceive of

00:18:15.572 --> 00:18:18.615
compromising with,
these free soil,

00:18:18.615 --> 00:18:20.885
anti-slavery,
they believed,

00:18:20.885 --> 00:18:23.240
abolitionist Republicans.

00:18:27.009 --> 00:18:28.778
These southern nationalists
were led by people like Edmund

00:18:28.778 --> 00:18:31.077
Ruffin of Virginia,
William Lowndes Yancey of

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:34.371
Georgia, Robert Rhett of South
Carolina, James D.B.

00:18:34.371 --> 00:18:37.402
DeBow, who published the
DeBow's Review,

00:18:37.402 --> 00:18:41.289
a very important southern
magazine out of New Orleans.

00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:45.279
It was a vision now of an
independent southern nation.

00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:49.977
In fact, Edmund Ruffin was so
determined to try to gather the

00:18:49.977 --> 00:18:54.362
spirit of an independent
southern nation that in the wake

00:18:54.362 --> 00:18:58.748
of John Brown's raid,
he got himself to Harpers Ferry

00:18:58.748 --> 00:19:03.369
and managed to collect 15 or 20
of Old John Brown's pikes;

00:19:03.369 --> 00:19:05.899
you know, these spear things
that John Brown was going to

00:19:05.899 --> 00:19:07.569
give to slaves after his
rebellion.

00:19:07.569 --> 00:19:13.934
And Ruffin sent one of those
pikes to the governor of every

00:19:13.934 --> 00:19:18.900
southern state.
These people were into

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.410
symbolism.
Now, it's interesting that this

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.319
sense of a southern nationalism,
if you like,

00:19:25.319 --> 00:19:27.668
was born more,
I would argue,

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:32.197
of fear of an enemy than it
actually was of any kind of

00:19:32.197 --> 00:19:35.720
planned vision of an organized
nation.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.613
As numerous,
brilliant scholars of southern

00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:42.816
nationalism, from Drew Faust to
John McCardell and others have

00:19:42.816 --> 00:19:46.880
argued--and I will come back to
this in a couple of weeks--a

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.670
southern nation did come out of
this confederacy,

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.274
but it was born almost
overnight, and not by a lot of

00:19:54.274 --> 00:19:57.745
long-term planning.
It was born more in resentment

00:19:57.745 --> 00:20:01.643
and defensiveness of knowing
what they were against and who

00:20:01.643 --> 00:20:05.809
their enemy might be than it was
actually born of a thought-out

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:07.960
plan of what they were for.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.206
And it's also-- there was also
a theory at the root of this

00:20:18.206 --> 00:20:21.145
kind of southern nationalist,
fledgling as it was in the

00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:23.720
Secession Crisis,
that--and it's right there in

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.204
the secession debates.
It's rooted in the shrinking

00:20:27.204 --> 00:20:30.257
south theory,
it's rooted in the desire to

00:20:30.257 --> 00:20:34.651
preserve a slave society--but
it's the idea that the South's

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:39.640
ultimate welfare would be better
outside of the union than in,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:46.059
requiring a certain thinking
about how to create a new

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:48.989
nation.
A fourth possible explanation--

00:20:48.989 --> 00:20:52.550
though I wouldn't hang too many
hats on this one because it's

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.424
rather vague;
it used to have a lot of

00:20:56.424 --> 00:21:03.980
purchase among historians--is
what we might call agrarianism,

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:08.457
the agrarian thesis,
the idea of King Cotton

00:21:08.457 --> 00:21:12.309
ideology, or King Cotton
diplomacy,

00:21:12.309 --> 00:21:18.785
or put more deeply,
a kind of Jeffersonian yeoman

00:21:18.785 --> 00:21:23.271
idealism.
This is the vague theory that

00:21:23.271 --> 00:21:28.446
secession was to protect an
agrarian, agricultural,

00:21:28.446 --> 00:21:32.596
planter civilization.
That the South was

00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:36.763
ultimately--they liked to think
of themselves,

00:21:36.763 --> 00:21:42.040
even the leadership--as a
people or a republic of farmers,

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.256
small farmers.
Now the majority of them were

00:21:45.256 --> 00:21:47.435
small farmers.
The real South,

00:21:47.435 --> 00:21:51.712
this argument was,
was not in the slave owning

00:21:51.712 --> 00:21:55.799
master class but in the men of
the soil,

00:21:55.799 --> 00:21:59.980
protecting a way of life
against all that ignoble,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.140
go-getter, money grubbing,
Yankee individualism.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.603
And there's something to this.
You can find these arguments

00:22:08.603 --> 00:22:11.579
all over the secession debates
as well.

00:22:11.579 --> 00:22:17.441
"Separate from those New
Yorkers, they're going to take

00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:21.461
your wallet;"
or as the saying went,

00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:26.680
you could hit a Yankee,
he wouldn't hit you back,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.747
but he would sue you.
This had a real vogue back

00:22:30.747 --> 00:22:33.549
in--this interpretation--back in
the 1920s, '30s,

00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:39.011
'40s, even into the 1950s and
beyond, among historians like

00:22:39.011 --> 00:22:42.521
Frank Owsley and others.
And its spirit,

00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:45.280
if you like,
is there in the Confederate

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.818
Anthem--not Dixie,
but the other Confederate

00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:51.720
Anthem, the Bonnie Blue
Flag.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.845
You don't hear that as much,
but there's a verse in

00:22:54.845 --> 00:22:58.720
Bonnie Blue Flag that the
soldiers sang all the time.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.049
It goes like this,
and listen for its ironies:

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:09.497
"We are a band of brothers,
native to the soil,

00:23:09.497 --> 00:23:16.130
fighting for the property we
gained by honest toil."

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:20.700
Whose honest toil?
Property.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:26.260
Well, for a yeoman farmer that
lyric made good sense.

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:33.009
And fifth, you can also argue
that secession is deeply rooted

00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:37.504
in some--some have argued this;
certainly Bertram Wyatt-Brown

00:23:37.504 --> 00:23:43.094
has and others--is rooted in
this notion of a tradition of

00:23:43.094 --> 00:23:46.825
southern honor.
The thesis that at the heart of

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:49.424
the southern planter class,
in particular,

00:23:49.424 --> 00:23:53.395
at the heart of their cohesion,
their self-understanding,

00:23:53.395 --> 00:23:56.881
and their worldview,
was a set of values by which

00:23:56.881 --> 00:23:58.845
men,
especially planters,

00:23:58.845 --> 00:24:02.267
defined themselves,
and therefore their society,

00:24:02.267 --> 00:24:06.125
and when those values were
threatened they circled the

00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:07.800
wagons in defense.

00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:13.762
And these were the manly
virtues, the argument went,

00:24:13.762 --> 00:24:16.564
of honesty, trustworthiness,
entitlement,

00:24:16.564 --> 00:24:20.842
social rank,
the willingness to defend one's

00:24:20.842 --> 00:24:23.329
honor, blood,
lineage,

00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:30.497
family, and especially home or
homeland, to defend one's

00:24:30.497 --> 00:24:37.404
community against not only
invasion but also insult or

00:24:37.404 --> 00:24:43.250
humiliation;
to save face in the presence of

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.890
one's critics,
one's enemies.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:53.196
Nothing could be worse,
said the honor code,

00:24:53.196 --> 00:25:00.415
than public humiliation.
Disputes to the man of southern

00:25:00.415 --> 00:25:05.029
honor were personal,
not a matter of law.

00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:07.097
And there comes a time,
the argument went,

00:25:07.097 --> 00:25:10.123
when to hell with the Supreme
Court, to hell with compromises

00:25:10.123 --> 00:25:17.339
in congress;
"this is personal," they said.

00:25:17.339 --> 00:25:22.079
Now, this one's hard to throw
darts at and make it stick.

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:26.540
You can see the language in the
secession movement--"we must

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.170
defend our honor,
we must defend our society."

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.087
When is the southern
secessionist planter speaking

00:25:33.087 --> 00:25:36.421
from honor, and when is he
speaking from the preservation

00:25:36.421 --> 00:25:39.517
of the slave society,
and when is he speaking from

00:25:39.517 --> 00:25:43.373
his sense of agrarianism?
When is he speaking from a

00:25:43.373 --> 00:25:48.009
vision of an independent
southern national future,

00:25:48.009 --> 00:25:51.102
is never easy to know,
but you can hear it in a James

00:25:51.102 --> 00:25:53.659
Jones, for example,
a leading South Carolina

00:25:53.659 --> 00:25:56.870
secessionist in the South
Carolina Secession Convention

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.259
who got up at the end of the
arguments and he said,

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:06.221
well folks, quote,
"If we fail we have saved our

00:26:06.221 --> 00:26:12.150
honor and lost nothing."
Now, think of the logic there.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.982
Of course he doesn't really
know precisely yet what they're

00:26:14.982 --> 00:26:18.665
going to fail at.
If a whole civilization goes

00:26:18.665 --> 00:26:22.996
down in ashes,
if a society will be destroyed

00:26:22.996 --> 00:26:26.540
at its root, you've lost
nothing.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.352
Some of these same guys who
were so caught up in defense of

00:26:38.352 --> 00:26:41.400
honor, of course,
loved Shakespeare.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.804
They especially loved plays
like Henry IV,

00:26:46.804 --> 00:26:54.009
when Prince Harry is lecturing
his soldiers to die with honor,

00:26:54.009 --> 00:26:59.250
because if you die with honor
you've lost nothing.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:05.556
Now, in your more modern
sensibilities life usually

00:27:05.556 --> 00:27:12.118
doesn't equate with nothing.
But mix all those explanations

00:27:12.118 --> 00:27:17.954
up together and fold in a little
ambiguity, and you can begin to

00:27:17.954 --> 00:27:22.238
explain secession.
A final parting word though,

00:27:22.238 --> 00:27:25.580
did the South have the right to
secede?

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:33.141
Let's just have a show of
hands, just to show,

00:27:33.141 --> 00:27:36.174
just a poll,
did the southern states have

00:27:36.174 --> 00:27:42.070
the right to secede in 1861?
Yes?

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:47.800
All right.
No?

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.890
Bunch of Yankees.
[Laughter] Not sure?

00:27:52.890 --> 00:28:00.021
You people are honest because
this is a constitutional theory

00:28:00.021 --> 00:28:04.299
that is very old and never
ending.

00:28:04.299 --> 00:28:06.542
But not sure,
down here in the front--a

00:28:06.542 --> 00:28:12.039
teaching assistant is not sure.
So, and he's remaining not sure.

00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:17.859
David Huyssen is a prophet of
ambiguity.

00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:20.312
You got to watch him,
he burns question marks on your

00:28:20.312 --> 00:28:22.009
front porch if you're not
careful.

00:28:22.009 --> 00:28:27.334
[Laughter]
I usually save that joke for

00:28:27.334 --> 00:28:32.940
Unitarians, but I--anyway,
never mind.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:39.274
Okay, sorry, sorry.
[Laughter]

00:28:39.274 --> 00:28:44.207
Very quickly though,
in 1861, of course,

00:28:44.207 --> 00:28:49.519
people had to make huge
decisions here,

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:54.054
not the least of which was
Lincoln and his circle of

00:28:54.054 --> 00:28:59.597
Republican advisors.
But Lincoln was very clear on

00:28:59.597 --> 00:29:02.586
this.
We're going to come back on

00:29:02.586 --> 00:29:07.494
Thursday to this whole question
of what Lincoln's policy was

00:29:07.494 --> 00:29:12.402
there in April 1861 and why he
moved with some force against

00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:14.754
the South.
But first of all,

00:29:14.754 --> 00:29:17.547
Lincoln's view,
and the nationalist unionist

00:29:17.547 --> 00:29:20.339
view of secession,
was essentially this.

00:29:20.339 --> 00:29:26.120
And you can read this closely
in your Lincoln Reader,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.661
in many places.
But it was basically that the

00:29:29.661 --> 00:29:32.394
Union of the United States,
so the argument went,

00:29:32.394 --> 00:29:34.900
was created by the people not
the states.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.316
Now I know this gets a little
bit like constitutional

00:29:38.316 --> 00:29:40.944
hairsplitting,
but a lot of hairs were at

00:29:40.944 --> 00:29:43.599
stake here.
So you had to split some of

00:29:43.599 --> 00:29:45.159
them.
The Union was created,

00:29:45.159 --> 00:29:46.944
said this argument,
by the people,

00:29:46.944 --> 00:29:50.748
not by the states.
The Union was therefore older

00:29:50.748 --> 00:29:55.902
than those states that agreed to
join it, in the American

00:29:55.902 --> 00:29:59.859
Revolution and in the U.S.
Constitution.

00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:04.108
"We the people in order to form
a more perfect union," some

00:30:04.108 --> 00:30:07.477
unionists argued,
meant secession really is not

00:30:07.477 --> 00:30:10.197
possible.
There was the practical

00:30:10.197 --> 00:30:14.227
argument against secession.
A Union cannot survive,

00:30:14.227 --> 00:30:17.899
the argument went,
if it can be broken at will

00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:22.984
whenever someone gets upset.
I don't like this law and that

00:30:22.984 --> 00:30:24.888
law;
well I like these but I don't

00:30:24.888 --> 00:30:27.992
like those;
I will nullify those and not

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:31.567
participate.
Hum, the argument is,

00:30:31.567 --> 00:30:37.440
that's not a good practical way
to run a republic.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.103
And some unionists--and Lincoln
was of course brilliant at this,

00:30:41.103 --> 00:30:44.230
eventually,
as you read his speeches--would

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:48.282
argue against secession from a
position--sort of civil

00:30:48.282 --> 00:30:52.769
religion,
of almost mysticism.

00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:56.119
What did Lincoln refer to at
the end of that first inaugural?

00:30:56.119 --> 00:31:01.542
That magnificent phrase about
the "mystic chords of memory,

00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:05.282
from every battlefield and
patriot grave,

00:31:05.282 --> 00:31:09.490
would yet swell the chorus of
the Union."

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:17.420
That's about music and memory,
not about the Constitution.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.385
Unionists would invoke the
fathers, just like the

00:31:21.385 --> 00:31:24.029
secessionists will,
of course,

00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:27.462
and those fathers of the
Constitution and the American

00:31:27.462 --> 00:31:32.289
Republic, they would argue,
were nationalist.

00:31:32.289 --> 00:31:35.006
They wanted a more perfect
Union, out of a Union that

00:31:35.006 --> 00:31:38.866
wasn't at all perfect.
And sometimes they would even

00:31:38.866 --> 00:31:42.731
directly invoke Chief Justice
John Marshall,

00:31:42.731 --> 00:31:45.473
the Virginian,
the first great Chief Justice

00:31:45.473 --> 00:31:47.650
of the Supreme Court for
twenty-five, thirty years,

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.313
and the forging of that
institution of the Supreme Court

00:31:52.313 --> 00:31:57.570
into a national institution of
cohesion and a certain power.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.826
Now, the states' rightists,
the secessionists,

00:32:06.826 --> 00:32:10.109
of course, will argue,
"no; no."

00:32:10.109 --> 00:32:12.427
They will say,
constitutionally,

00:32:12.427 --> 00:32:16.089
the Union, they will argue,
is a federal union;

00:32:16.089 --> 00:32:19.513
federal in the sense that it
was a compact,

00:32:19.513 --> 00:32:23.833
a contract between its
founders, and the founders were

00:32:23.833 --> 00:32:26.849
the states that chose to join
it.

00:32:26.849 --> 00:32:31.049
And they will argue that states
voted.

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:35.603
In the Continental Congress
states voted on the Articles of

00:32:35.603 --> 00:32:38.823
Confederation,
states voted to approve the

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:41.099
U.S.
Constitution or not.

00:32:41.099 --> 00:32:46.799
States voted to ratify the
Constitution and so on.

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:49.299
Then they will go to the
Reserve Clause of the

00:32:49.299 --> 00:32:52.576
Constitution--all powers not
given to the Federal Government

00:32:52.576 --> 00:32:55.248
in the Constitution,
in Congress,

00:32:55.248 --> 00:32:59.599
are, quote, "reserved for the
states."

00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:04.211
That beautiful,
wonderful, tortured and

00:33:04.211 --> 00:33:08.823
ambiguous, but,
in some ways brilliant,

00:33:08.823 --> 00:33:15.579
provision of the Constitution.
They will go to the language of

00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:18.806
experiment in republicanism.
They will say the American

00:33:18.806 --> 00:33:21.448
Republic has been an experiment;
it's been a fascinating,

00:33:21.448 --> 00:33:24.230
wonderful, world historical
experiment.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.814
But you know what they'll say?
It's just failed,

00:33:26.814 --> 00:33:30.558
and let us show you the reasons
why and the way,

00:33:30.558 --> 00:33:37.039
and let us go in peace;
it is our right.

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:40.440
They will argue for the right
of secession,

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.055
based on essentially the notion
of a contractual theory of

00:33:45.055 --> 00:33:50.074
government,
and that a contract in this

00:33:50.074 --> 00:33:55.569
sense, they will argue,
can be broken.

00:33:55.569 --> 00:34:00.166
Now as Allan Nevins once said,
secession though,

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:05.936
after all the constitutional
historians and the lawyers have

00:34:05.936 --> 00:34:12.088
worked it though,
is a matter of power,

00:34:12.088 --> 00:34:20.480
and as Nevins said,
who has the most guns.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.769
I'll leave that hanging for a
moment.

00:34:21.769 --> 00:34:24.307
We'll come back to secession in
the wake of Fort Sumter and the

00:34:24.307 --> 00:34:25.739
beginning of the war on
Thursday.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:30.393
But let me take you through a
quick survey of what historians

00:34:30.393 --> 00:34:33.340
have done with this story over
time.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.520
I love this kind of stuff,
the historiographical debates

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:44.171
of historians is probably why
some of use become historians--

00:34:44.171 --> 00:34:48.062
we like the arguments.
Before I leave states' rights

00:34:48.062 --> 00:34:51.095
though, it's of course a theory
that's not going to at all die

00:34:51.095 --> 00:34:54.230
in the Civil War.
Secession may have died;

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:58.559
well maybe, never say never,
who knows?

00:34:58.559 --> 00:35:06.715
Kosovo just seceded from Serbia
and Russia is making a big stink

00:35:06.715 --> 00:35:09.746
over it.
And I was listening to a

00:35:09.746 --> 00:35:14.014
Canadian radio station last
night--don't ask me why but it's

00:35:14.014 --> 00:35:18.137
what comes on right after NPR
goes off [laughter]--and the

00:35:18.137 --> 00:35:22.405
Quebecois in Quebec are using
the Kosovo model now to rev up

00:35:22.405 --> 00:35:27.180
once again the possibility of
Quebec secession from Canada.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.320
So watch out;
got to follow this.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.135
And there's always threats
after some of our elections,

00:35:35.135 --> 00:35:38.880
somebody's deciding they want
to secede,

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.159
which usually means they just
want to move to New Zealand;

00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:43.809
but New Zealand has strong
immigration laws,

00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:46.300
so don't even think it.
[Laughter]

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.670
States' rights is a theory,
I'm going to argue,

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:55.230
a theory of the proper
relations of the levels of

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.498
government,
how power is distributed

00:35:58.498 --> 00:36:01.119
between those levels of
government.

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:08.139
It is a theory of the nature of
federalism.

00:36:08.139 --> 00:36:11.438
But--and I think this is the
crucial point and you can argue

00:36:11.438 --> 00:36:15.659
this, we can argue this forever,
and we probably will if we're

00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:20.460
Americans--but I would argue
that the significance of states'

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:25.099
rights is always and everywhere
in the cause to which it is

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:29.000
employed.
States' rights for what?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.019
A state's right to do what?
In the interest of what?

00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:39.437
Now throughout our history some
things have happened first in

00:36:39.437 --> 00:36:42.477
states.
Women's suffrage happened in

00:36:42.477 --> 00:36:46.178
states first,
and then grew over time into

00:36:46.178 --> 00:36:50.240
finally a federal right to vote
for women.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.975
There are many other cases.
States' rights is not always a

00:36:54.975 --> 00:36:57.429
conservative or reactionary
idea.

00:36:57.429 --> 00:37:00.710
It is sometimes a progressive
idea.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:05.118
One might believe in more local
state control--but to what end,

00:37:05.118 --> 00:37:07.891
for what purpose,
to advance what issue,

00:37:07.891 --> 00:37:12.760
cause, what principle?
Just make your list of issues.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:20.044
And where would you start
first, for stem cell research,

00:37:20.044 --> 00:37:24.680
for gay marriage,
for or against?

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:30.486
Where did the right begin?
School curriculums,

00:37:30.486 --> 00:37:35.011
the right to vote,
women's economic rights,

00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:39.967
reproductive freedom,
collective bargaining for

00:37:39.967 --> 00:37:44.000
unions;
and on and on and on.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.676
Old-age pensions began first in
some states in the progressive

00:37:48.676 --> 00:37:52.739
era, before we ever had a
national Social Security.

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:57.849
The Civil War didn't eliminate
states' rights.

00:37:57.849 --> 00:38:03.040
It has this sloganeering power
to it that never gets much

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.010
analysis.
Well all right.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:12.552
Now, somewhere on this outline
I listed--Well,

00:38:12.552 --> 00:38:19.073
in the wake of the Civil War,
of course, and for that

00:38:19.073 --> 00:38:24.500
generation, there were unionist
and confederate blame laying,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.811
interpretations of the war.
It's a fascinating collection

00:38:27.811 --> 00:38:32.322
of writing, there's a lot of it.
Much of it is score settling,

00:38:32.322 --> 00:38:37.250
of course, it's vindication on
the part of southerners,

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.802
it's the forging of this Lost
Cause tradition--and I'll speak

00:38:39.802 --> 00:38:42.099
a lot more about that at the
very end of the course,

00:38:42.099 --> 00:38:47.702
because the lost cause became
an elaborate ideology over time,

00:38:47.702 --> 00:38:52.360
especially a racial ideology.
A lot of the debate among the

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.169
generation that fought the war
over what had caused it got all

00:38:56.169 --> 00:38:59.683
caught up in labeling.
Was the war "The War of the

00:38:59.683 --> 00:39:02.868
Rebellion," which was the
official, northern,

00:39:02.868 --> 00:39:05.980
federal definition and label of
the war?

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.164
This was not called the
American Civil War by the

00:39:08.164 --> 00:39:10.302
Federal Government,
it was called the War of the

00:39:10.302 --> 00:39:12.668
Rebellion.
If you go out and look at Civil

00:39:12.668 --> 00:39:16.070
War monuments on battlefields,
put up in the 1880s and '90s,

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.494
it's called the War of the
Rebellion, if it's a Union

00:39:20.494 --> 00:39:22.304
monument.
In the south,

00:39:22.304 --> 00:39:25.670
it was early called "The War
Between the States."

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.969
It was sometimes called "The
War for Southern Independence."

00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:32.519
It was sometimes called "The
War of Northern Aggression;"

00:39:32.519 --> 00:39:35.750
that sometimes is used now as a
euphemism.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.672
My favorite label,
and it wasn't just southern,

00:39:38.672 --> 00:39:42.292
but by the 1890s and turn of
the twentieth century a label

00:39:42.292 --> 00:39:45.913
that got into the press and
people loved it as a throwaway

00:39:45.913 --> 00:39:48.836
joke line,
was, quote, "the late

00:39:48.836 --> 00:39:51.174
unpleasantness."
[Laughter]

00:39:51.174 --> 00:39:55.462
You want to start dissolving
conflict--we had some late

00:39:55.462 --> 00:39:59.591
unpleasantness here and
slaughtered all these people,

00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:03.603
but never mind.
Now, I'll pass on examples of

00:40:03.603 --> 00:40:08.700
this unionist and confederate
tradition and perhaps we'll just

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.210
re-visit this at the end of the
course,

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.980
because that's perhaps where it
belongs anyway.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.696
But by the late nineteenth
century, the 1890s to be exact,

00:40:18.696 --> 00:40:21.239
and into the early twentieth
century,

00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:24.730
one historian,
named James Ford Rhodes,

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:30.150
and this kind of nationalist
tradition in which he wrote,

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:35.165
had a tremendous impact on the
way the vast majority of

00:40:35.165 --> 00:40:40.460
Americans would come to
understand Civil War causation.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:48.039
Rhodes was a gifted amateur,
a gentlemen scholar.

00:40:48.039 --> 00:40:51.579
He was born in Cleveland,
Ohio in 1848.

00:40:51.579 --> 00:40:54.428
So he was a boy and a teenager
during the Civil War,

00:40:54.428 --> 00:40:58.501
but too young to have fought.
But he grew up helplessly

00:40:58.501 --> 00:41:02.902
fascinated with this event that
forged his life,

00:41:02.902 --> 00:41:05.519
his world.
He was very wealthy.

00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:10.141
He retired to Beacon Hill in
Boston, and between 1893 and

00:41:10.141 --> 00:41:14.986
1907, a fourteen-year period,
he published his seven volumes,

00:41:14.986 --> 00:41:19.042
a series called History of
the United States from the

00:41:19.042 --> 00:41:22.553
Compromise of 1850.
They didn't worry about boring

00:41:22.553 --> 00:41:24.360
titles in the nineteenth
century.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.443
That title would never fly
though a publisher today,

00:41:26.443 --> 00:41:31.369
but that's what it was called.
Seven volumes Rhodes wrote.

00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:34.807
Now, on the one hand Rhodes
said the Civil War was

00:41:34.807 --> 00:41:37.753
caused--he developed the sole
cause theory,

00:41:37.753 --> 00:41:40.700
and he said the sole cause is
slavery;

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.601
make no mistake, it's slavery.
But it's what Rhodes did with

00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:48.494
this that is really important,
and it is still alive and well

00:41:48.494 --> 00:41:51.090
in our culture and you can't
kill it.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:55.904
He said the war was caused by
slavery, it was an irrepressible

00:41:55.904 --> 00:41:59.849
conflict, but he focused on
slavery as a system,

00:41:59.849 --> 00:42:05.064
on cotton and the cotton gin,
not upon any moral element to

00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:08.659
the story of slavery and/or
abolition.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:11.857
Slavery was a national curse,
he called it,

00:42:11.857 --> 00:42:16.591
never a national crime.
Slavery was a broad force,

00:42:16.591 --> 00:42:22.145
almost like climate,
it was almost like bad weather,

00:42:22.145 --> 00:42:26.719
and no one is to blame for bad
weather.

00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:29.575
Southerners deserved,
in Rhodes' view,

00:42:29.575 --> 00:42:32.718
sympathy and not censure.
Slaveholders,

00:42:32.718 --> 00:42:37.682
he argued, should be absolved
because they were themselves the

00:42:37.682 --> 00:42:41.752
victims of this system and
therefore the victims of

00:42:41.752 --> 00:42:46.685
history--a tragic lot,
destined to try to preserve a

00:42:46.685 --> 00:42:51.780
civilization that the world was
beginning to pass by.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.535
He greatly admired antebellum
southern society and

00:42:55.535 --> 00:42:58.907
civilization,
and there's a certain nostalgia

00:42:58.907 --> 00:43:02.280
in Rhodes' work for my God what
we lost,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:07.053
in the great planters world.
He rose Robert E.

00:43:07.053 --> 00:43:11.000
Lee to the status of national
hero;

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.541
he didn't do it alone,
there were a lot of people

00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:17.935
helping him with that by
1900--that's Robert E.

00:43:17.935 --> 00:43:21.698
Lee who led the Confederate
armies to national hero,

00:43:21.698 --> 00:43:24.650
I just thought I'd point that
out.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.590
I was in Richmond two weeks ago
giving a lecture.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.159
A woman came up afterward from
New York or Boston,

00:43:32.159 --> 00:43:36.093
born and raised in the North,
and she has just moved to

00:43:36.093 --> 00:43:38.800
Richmond.
Oh, she's just full of

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.559
enthusiasm and she's the
cultural attaché

00:43:42.559 --> 00:43:46.880
director or something for the
city of Richmond now.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.505
And I was speaking at this new
museum about the Civil War and

00:43:49.505 --> 00:43:52.173
she came up to me and she said,
"I want to know what you think

00:43:52.173 --> 00:43:54.711
of my idea.
I think the first thing we need

00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:58.110
to do in Richmond is just tear
down all those Confederate

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.960
monuments."
I said, "Oh."

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.789
Oh dear.
[Laughter] Oh dear.

00:44:04.789 --> 00:44:06.860
I didn't even know what to tell
her.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.988
She said, "If they can just
take down that Robert E.

00:44:08.988 --> 00:44:11.200
Lee statue and then that
Stonewall Jackson statute.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.023
Just take them down.
Wouldn't everything be all

00:44:14.023 --> 00:44:15.797
right?"
I went over in the bookstore,

00:44:15.797 --> 00:44:18.271
I got her a copy of Race and
Reunion, this book I did on

00:44:18.271 --> 00:44:20.829
Civil War memory,
and I said, "Here ma'am,

00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:23.484
just start here."
[Laughter]

00:44:23.484 --> 00:44:31.225
According to James Ford Rhodes
both sides had fought nobly,

00:44:31.225 --> 00:44:38.462
both sides had fought well.
There was to be no blame,

00:44:38.462 --> 00:44:46.349
in this historical verdict of
seven volumes and something like

00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:51.909
3000-and-some pages,
in Rhodes' history.

00:44:51.909 --> 00:44:56.469
Now, this put in place--and
I'll leave it there--a kind of

00:44:56.469 --> 00:45:00.888
nationalist, reconciliationist,
quasi-scholarly,

00:45:00.888 --> 00:45:06.668
popular historical tradition
through which most other

00:45:06.668 --> 00:45:13.782
interpretations of the Civil War
causation would now have to pass

00:45:13.782 --> 00:45:19.590
or breathe or move.
And then came Charles Beard and

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:24.250
Mary Beard, by the
1930s--early--in the '20s.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:27.890
How to sum up Beard.
Charles Beard,

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:30.972
the great progressive
historian, so-called--and by

00:45:30.972 --> 00:45:34.116
that label we mean those
historians who came of age

00:45:34.116 --> 00:45:37.010
around the turn of the twentieth
century,

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:39.534
first decade or two of the
twentieth century,

00:45:39.534 --> 00:45:41.830
and were still writing into the
1950s;

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:46.602
some of them even into the '60s.
They tended to see the

00:45:46.602 --> 00:45:52.270
world--especially by the
1930s--they tended to see the

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:57.510
world through a frame of the
Great Depression.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.989
Well the frame of World War One
and then a frame of the Crash of

00:46:01.989 --> 00:46:05.829
'29, and the worldwide Great
Depression of the '30s.

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:11.017
They tended to see history as
essentially a story of

00:46:11.017 --> 00:46:16.510
economics, essentially a story
of capital and labor,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.807
of wealth as an engine,
or the pursuit of it as an

00:46:21.807 --> 00:46:25.577
engine of history.
Charles Beard wrote a great

00:46:25.577 --> 00:46:29.210
book, in many ways--we now can
look at it and see all kinds of

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:32.545
holes in it--a book called
The Economic Interpretation

00:46:32.545 --> 00:46:37.824
of the American Civil War.
He saw the South and the North

00:46:37.824 --> 00:46:42.829
as essentially two
economies--two civilizations,

00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:46.765
two economies.
There are rarely any people in

00:46:46.765 --> 00:46:49.669
Charles Beard's work,
there are economies,

00:46:49.669 --> 00:46:53.070
there are systems,
there are economic forces;

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:56.924
there's cotton and free labor,
and there's shipping and

00:46:56.924 --> 00:47:00.636
merchants in the North,
and there are planters in the

00:47:00.636 --> 00:47:03.191
South.
There's the telegraph spreading

00:47:03.191 --> 00:47:07.333
across the North.
There are canals and there are

00:47:07.333 --> 00:47:12.441
railroads.
And in his interpretation the

00:47:12.441 --> 00:47:19.581
South rebelled to try to
preserve its economic way of

00:47:19.581 --> 00:47:23.220
life.
And ultimately the Civil War,

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.636
in Beard's view,
wasn't really about any

00:47:26.636 --> 00:47:31.443
particular ideology--that is,
any racial ideology or any

00:47:31.443 --> 00:47:35.758
pre-slavery or anti-slavery
ideology--it was two economic

00:47:35.758 --> 00:47:39.380
systems living together in the
same society,

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:43.320
the same nation,
and coming into conflict with

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:49.815
one another in insolvable ways;
forces meeting at a crossroads

00:47:49.815 --> 00:47:54.639
and they had to clash.
Beard is laden with

00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:58.432
inevitability,
as any great economic

00:47:58.432 --> 00:48:03.733
determinist usually is.
He called the American Civil

00:48:03.733 --> 00:48:06.749
War, famously,
the "Second American

00:48:06.749 --> 00:48:10.573
Revolution."
But by that he didn't mean what

00:48:10.573 --> 00:48:15.561
Bruce Levine and Eric Foner and
other, many other historians of

00:48:15.561 --> 00:48:19.986
well my generation and the
generation before have called

00:48:19.986 --> 00:48:21.865
it,
when we've called it a second

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:25.579
American Revolution.
What Beard meant by that is a

00:48:25.579 --> 00:48:31.218
kind of great dividing line
between an agricultural era and

00:48:31.218 --> 00:48:33.260
an industrial era.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.980
All right, my clock says I'm
running out of time.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:45.585
I'm going to leave you hanging
on this limb of wondering what

00:48:45.585 --> 00:48:49.510
the "needless war school" people
argued.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:53.489
They thought it was needless,
actually.

00:48:53.489 --> 00:49:01.130
But I want to end with this,
as a lead-in to Thursday.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:05.240
Walt Whitman wrote a poem about
this year.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.793
He called it "1861."
And here are just a few lines

00:49:09.793 --> 00:49:12.614
of it, to give you a sense--I
think Whitman,

00:49:12.614 --> 00:49:17.523
as no one else could,
captured what was in the heads

00:49:17.523 --> 00:49:23.255
of northerners and southerners.
"Arm'd year--year of the

00:49:23.255 --> 00:49:28.786
struggle, No dainty rhymes or
sentimental love verses for you,

00:49:28.786 --> 00:49:33.479
oh terrible year.
Not you as some pale poetling

00:49:33.479 --> 00:49:37.550
seated at a desk lisping
cadenzas piano.

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:42.039
But as a strong man erect,
clothed in blue clothes,

00:49:42.039 --> 00:49:46.260
advancing, carrying a rifle on
your shoulder,

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.958
With well-gristled body and
sunburnt face and hands,

00:49:49.958 --> 00:49:52.860
with a knife in the belt at
your side.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.841
As I heard you shouting loud,
your sonorous voice,

00:49:56.841 --> 00:50:02.384
ringing across the continent.
Year, that suddenly sang by the

00:50:02.384 --> 00:50:05.800
mouths of the round-lipp'd
cannon.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:10.679
I repeat you,
hurrying, crashing,

00:50:10.679 --> 00:50:18.000
sad, distracted,
year." See you Thursday.

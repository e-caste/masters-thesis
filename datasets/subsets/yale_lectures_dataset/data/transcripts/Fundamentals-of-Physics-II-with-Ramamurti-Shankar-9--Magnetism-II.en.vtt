00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.850
Prof: Okay,
well I want to start by

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.109
cleaning up a little bit of
stuff done near the end of last

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:09.770
time.
 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.960
So I told you the whole thing
with magnetism is going to

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.076
contain two parts,
just like with electricity,

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:23.949
namely how do things react to a
magnetic field and how do things

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.560
produce a magnetic field?
 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.758
Just like the electric charges,
electric charges produce

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:32.840
electric fields and electric
charges react to electric

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.480
fields.
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.890
So the first part is very easy
for magnetism.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.749
The force of magnetism on a
charge q depends on its

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:46.780
velocity, because if it doesn't
move, it doesn't feel it.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.355
And it depends on the magnetic
field, which I will denote by

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:50.360
some symbol B.
 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.592
Then you can ask yourself,
"How am I going to get a

00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:55.590
vector out of two vectors?"
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.815
namely the velocity and
B, and a natural

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:01.130
candidate is the cross product.
 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.180
Now that doesn't mean that's
the right answer.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.706
For example,
I can multiply this by the

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:11.563
absolute value of velocity
squared and that will still be a

00:01:11.563 --> 00:01:14.290
vector, because that's just a
scalar.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.391
Anyway, ignore that,
because that's not what

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:16.879
happens.
 

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.970
Nature is very kind and it's
just

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.540
v x B.
 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.486
And you got to know how to do
the cross products,

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:24.769
okay?
 

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:27.890
There are two rules you're
going to use all the time.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.406
One is the cross product,
which is for me the screwdriver

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:33.218
rule,
that if you've got a vector

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.349
v and you've got a vector
B,

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.491
you turn the screwdriver from
v to B and the way

00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:43.090
it comes out is the direction of
the cross product.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.940
So everyone's doing that.
 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.560
You can also do it with your
hand.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.550
Have you seen all the rap guys?
 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.376
They're all computing cross
products, because there turns

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:54.950
out to be a right hand rule and
a left hand rule.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.410
So you can do that,
or you can do this.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.980
Another one is whenever there's
a current or something,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.299
you don't know which way the
magnetic field is going,

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.040
you're supposed to wrap your
hands around the current.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.450
Now don't do this at home.
 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.777
Wrap it around the current,
and the thumb points the

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:12.408
direction of the field.
 

00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:14.764
So whenever you have doubts
about which way something is

00:02:14.764 --> 00:02:16.322
going,
if you see something looping

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:18.447
around,
wrap your four fingers around

00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:20.364
that loop,
and thumb will point in the

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:21.470
direction of the answer.
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.055
I've been using it a lot
without spelling it out for you,

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:28.577
but you should know at least
the technical definition of

00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:29.729
cross product.
 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.663
Another thing is,
I didn't tell you anything

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:33.620
about units.
 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.830
So B is measured in
Tesla, and the meaning of a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.827
Tesla is that if you have a 1
coulomb charge moving at 1 meter

00:02:44.827 --> 00:02:48.241
per second,
perpendicular to the magnetic

00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:51.816
field B of 1 tesla,
it will experience a force of 1

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.280
Newton.
 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.180
That's it.
 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.188
So Tesla is cooked up so that
in the mks units that we use,

00:02:58.188 --> 00:03:02.592
if you put in the numbers,
you will get the force in

00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:03.628
Newtons.
 

00:03:03.628 --> 00:03:06.901
Then I said from this
microscopic description of what

00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:11.191
happens to a single charge,
you can go to a piece of wire

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:15.580
carrying some current and take a
segment dl,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.470
and the current is I
going through the loop.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.675
The force, which I write as
dF, meaning an

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:26.968
infinitesimal force on an
infinitesimal segment is

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:29.158
dl x B.
 

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:31.347
So if you stick a wire in a
magnetic field,

00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:34.367
different parts of the wire
have current going in different

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:35.150
directions.
 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.051
I'm taking a tiny section,
dl, and in that tiny

00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:44.030
section, I'm computing the cross
product.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.139
That's going to be the force.
 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.353
For example,
if at this location the

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:53.860
magnetic field points that way,
then the force will be coming

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.788
out of the board.
 

00:03:55.788 --> 00:03:59.913
So this is the first half,
and I tried to do a problem

00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:01.080
near the end.
 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.926
Let me repeat that,
because I sort of switched

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.699
coordinates in the middle.
 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.289
So I wanted to do this problem.
 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.389
There's a wire.
 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.139
This is a semicircle.
 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.758
I'm not worried about this
portion and this portion.

00:04:15.758 --> 00:04:21.264
I just want to know,
what is the force on this

00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:23.100
segment here?
 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.759
Which way is it going to act?
 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.170
So B is like this.
 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.273
First of all,
you can tell,

00:04:28.273 --> 00:04:30.649
the force is going to be in or
out of the blackboard,

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:33.779
because if B is in the
plane of the blackboard,

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.033
I mean, velocity of the current
is in the plane of the

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:37.577
blackboard,
B is in the plane,

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:39.589
cross product will be
perpendicular to two of them,

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:41.149
will come out.
 

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:43.747
You've just got to figure out,
is it coming out or is it going

00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:43.959
in?
 

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.029
So take a segment here,
if you like.

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.930
That's a segment dl,
and here is the B.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.084
Turn a screwdriver from
dl to B,

00:04:55.084 --> 00:04:57.610
it's coming out of the
blackboard.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.894
B is assumed to be
uniform and in the plane of the

00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:02.889
blackboard.
 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.459
So let's now compute the
contribution from this segment.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:10.601
The contribution from this
segment is going to be--I'm

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:13.982
going to ignore the vector
nature, because it's coming out

00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:14.990
of the board.
 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.579
I already know that.
 

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:21.464
So there is the current,
then there is the dl,

00:05:21.464 --> 00:05:26.538
then there is the B,
and there's the sine of the

00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:30.110
angle, which means these two
guys.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.060
I claim that that is the same
as this angle here.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.069
This is an ancient trick.
 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.370
The ancient trick says if the
angle between two lines is

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.017
θ,
then the angle between the

00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:48.319
perpendicular to the two lines
is also θ.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.740
So the two lines are this and
this and the perpendiculars to

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.656
them,
this guy's perpendicular to

00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:57.779
this one and the tangent vector
is perpendicular to the radius.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.420
So that's the same angle
θ.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.379
So that sinθ is
this one.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:09.516
So the total force will be
IB--and what is

00:06:09.516 --> 00:06:10.800
dl?
 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.711
The segment length dl is
just R times

00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:17.480
dθ.
 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.612
So you've got sinθ
dθ integral from 0

00:06:22.612 --> 00:06:23.439
to Π.
 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:26.430
The reason I repeated this is
that normally we measure theta

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.459
like that, but there's nothing
sacred.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:29.889
You can measure it any way you
like.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.685
If you measure it this way,
it's increasing in this

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:37.709
direction, you should go from 0
here to Π there.

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:39.529
So integral of sine is -cosine.
 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:49.319
You do all the limits,
you get 2IBR.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.521
By the way, it's very useful to
know a quick rule,

00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:55.723
is that the force on a segment,
where everybody is

00:06:55.723 --> 00:06:58.730
perpendicular to everybody,
is BLl.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.386
Segment of length L
carrying current I in a

00:07:01.386 --> 00:07:02.620
magnetic field B.
 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.290
If B and I are
all perpendicular,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.379
then the force is just
BIL.

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:13.220
So if you look at it that way,
it looks like B times

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.860
I times 2R,
2R being this length.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.377
In other words,
if the current,

00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:23.209
instead of going around like
this, had gone straight from

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.980
here to here,
it would have a length

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.790
2R.
 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.990
B is this way,
perpendicular.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.420
Take the cross product,
you will get the same force.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.269
In other words,
the force on the curved segment

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:37.740
between two points is the same
as the force on a straight

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.910
segment joining the two points.
 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.160
This happens to be universally
true in a uniform field.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.456
In other words,
even if the wire did this,

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:49.110
don't bother to find the force.
 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.540
It's just simply the force on
that segment.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.279
Now you will prove that in your
homework.

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:58.779
It's not obvious,
but I don't want to tell you

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.670
exactly why, but that's
something you can prove.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.278
So that was one line segment.
 

00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:12.240
But then I started taking a
loop.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.555
So here is the loop,
and let's say the magnetic

00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:20.240
field is going up like this and
the loop is oriented like this.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.196
It's carrying a current
I in the sense shown

00:08:25.196 --> 00:08:25.889
here.
 

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:28.709
So what are the forces on the
four sides.

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:31.889
B is this way.
 

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:35.360
Dl or I is this
way, and B is up.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.586
If you turn a screwdriver from
there to B,

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:41.408
you will find this force here
is like that,

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:43.559
and this force is like that.
 

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.678
Both are horizontal forces.
 

00:08:45.678 --> 00:08:49.370
There's a force on this side
and a force on that side,

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.529
which are equal and opposite.
 

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:53.558
Yes?
 

00:08:53.558 --> 00:08:58.508
Student:  What are the
forces on _________ B

00:08:58.508 --> 00:09:01.200
inside and outside the force?
 

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.110
Prof: They are
perpendicular.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.818
I will show you a side view
where you will see exactly how

00:09:05.818 --> 00:09:06.769
they are pointing.
 

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:09.610
At the moment,
this is limited by my artistic

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.484
skills, but I will show you in a
moment a side view that will

00:09:13.484 --> 00:09:14.970
make it very clear.
 

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.094
But it should be clear right
now, the total force on this

00:09:18.094 --> 00:09:20.408
loop is 0,
because it's a uniform magnetic

00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:22.360
field,
if there's a current going this

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.932
way,
there's the same current going

00:09:23.932 --> 00:09:26.350
the opposite way for the same
length in the same field,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.158
so those forces will cancel.
 

00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:30.860
So the loop doesn't feel a net
force.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.311
But it feels a net torque,
which I think you can imagine,

00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:40.320
is trying to straighten this
loop out and make it horizontal.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.465
And if you want to see the
torque, look at the loop from

00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:46.500
this end, from this edge.
 

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.288
It looks like this.
 

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:53.288
That's the loop and that's the
B field.

00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:58.875
And that's the normal to the
loop or the area vector of the

00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:01.090
loop looks like that.
 

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:07.604
So the force looks like this
here and looks like that in the

00:10:07.604 --> 00:10:09.149
top section.
 

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:15.264
So let us say this length is
l and this width

00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:16.740
is w.
 

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.330
Then the force on this segment
is BlI,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:25.094
I told you that,
and this force is also

00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:30.368
BlI,
and that is w and this

00:10:30.368 --> 00:10:34.980
angle and this angle are both
theta,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:44.470
then the torque =
BlIwsinθ.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.212
I hope you understand why it's
wsinθ,

00:10:47.212 --> 00:10:48.928
because
wsinθ is

00:10:48.928 --> 00:10:49.808
that distance.
 

00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:51.210
By the way, when you compute
torques,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.645
you can find the torque around
this point or torque around that

00:10:53.645 --> 00:10:55.586
point,
it doesn't matter around which

00:10:55.586 --> 00:10:57.865
point,
as long as the forces add up to

00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:00.080
0, and finding it around this
point.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.849
If you like,
you can find the torque around

00:11:01.849 --> 00:11:03.282
the midpoint,
then this will give a

00:11:03.282 --> 00:11:04.798
contribution,
that will give an equal

00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:05.600
contribution.
 

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.485
You will add them,
but no matter what you do,

00:11:08.485 --> 00:11:10.649
you will get
wsinθ

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:12.419
times either force.
 

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:14.528
So that's the torque.
 

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:17.554
But whenever we see a sine
theta and a lot of vectors,

00:11:17.554 --> 00:11:20.009
we know we're looking at a
cross product.

00:11:20.009 --> 00:11:23.096
And the cross product,
the vector formula for tau,

00:11:23.096 --> 00:11:27.412
is going to be written as
μ x B,

00:11:27.412 --> 00:11:33.957
and μ is a quantity
which is area vector times the

00:11:33.957 --> 00:11:39.755
current,
because l times w

00:11:39.755 --> 00:11:41.629
is the area.
 

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:42.298
Right?
 

00:11:42.298 --> 00:11:45.855
The area of the loop which
points perpendicular to that has

00:11:45.855 --> 00:11:48.918
a value equal to l
times w.

00:11:48.918 --> 00:11:50.740
so l times
w is area,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.408
so I times area is
called the magnetic moment,

00:11:53.408 --> 00:12:00.275
and that times B times
sinθ is the cross

00:12:00.275 --> 00:12:01.440
product.
 

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.684
So what you notice is that the
torque will turn it till

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:09.600
μ x B is 0.
 

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.349
That will occur when
μ and B are

00:12:12.349 --> 00:12:14.009
parallel, or anti-parallel.
 

00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:15.798
There are the only two options.
 

00:12:15.798 --> 00:12:18.077
When they are the parallel,
the area vector's along

00:12:18.077 --> 00:12:18.580
B.
 

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.456
When they're anti-parallel,
the area vector's exactly

00:12:21.456 --> 00:12:22.730
opposite to B.
 

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.320
And they are the two
equilibrium positions.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.509
But one is the point of maximum
energy;

00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:32.100
one is the point of minimum
energy, just like with the

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.320
electric dipole.
 

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.494
Once you have a torque like
this, you can find the potential

00:12:37.494 --> 00:12:41.101
energy and you can show the
potential energy is just

00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:45.011
-μBcosθ,
which is

00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:49.779
-μ⋅B.
 

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:50.105
Right?
 

00:12:50.105 --> 00:12:52.009
The integral of
sinθ is

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:56.441
-cosθ,
so basically the point I'm

00:12:56.441 --> 00:13:00.113
making is,
this loop would like to have

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:03.889
its area vector parallel to the
magnetic field.

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:05.820
That's what you've got to
understand.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.423
It will align itself so that
the most amount of magnetic

00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:11.259
field lines go through it.
 

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:14.144
So one way is to be parallel to
it, the other is to be

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:16.431
anti-parallel,
and they don't have the same

00:13:16.431 --> 00:13:17.028
energy.
 

00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:20.763
The energy looks like this,
- cosine theta means it looks

00:13:20.763 --> 00:13:23.230
like that as the function of
theta.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:27.009
Theta = 0 is the best and theta
= pi is the worst.

00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:30.788
If you keep it here,
it's a stable equilibrium.

00:13:30.788 --> 00:13:32.717
If the loop is perturbed a
little, little bit,

00:13:32.717 --> 00:13:34.090
it will rattle back and forth.
 

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.764
If you keep it there,
it's like being on the top of a

00:13:37.764 --> 00:13:38.259
hill.
 

00:13:38.259 --> 00:13:40.235
If you perturb it,
it will come all the way down

00:13:40.235 --> 00:13:44.440
the other side;
it will flip over.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.070
So this loop is really like a
tiny compass needle.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.450
If this B field were due
to the earth,

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.279
then the normal to the area
vector,

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:57.140
if you can put a little--you
could take a plane and you paint

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.573
a little arrow on top of it,
the arrow will line up with the

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:03.100
magnetic field.
 

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:08.501
All right, so you should
remember then that this is

00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:11.419
called a magnetic dipole.
 

00:14:11.419 --> 00:14:12.350
Why?
 

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.394
Because we studied the electric
dipole in which if you got a

00:14:15.394 --> 00:14:19.636
plus charge and a minus charge,
and you got an electric field

00:14:19.636 --> 00:14:24.440
E and the torque on it
was p x E,

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:31.562
where the magnitude of p
is the charge times the distance

00:14:31.562 --> 00:14:33.259
between them.
 

00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:36.533
And a dipole would also align
itself with the electric field,

00:14:36.533 --> 00:14:39.808
with the charge along E
and the - charge down here.

00:14:39.808 --> 00:14:43.038
The other configuration was
exactly anti-parallel,

00:14:43.038 --> 00:14:45.509
but that's the configuration of
highest energy,

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:51.600
and the energy again was
-p⋅E.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.849
So a current loop is like an
electric dipole,

00:14:54.849 --> 00:14:57.360
except it's the magnetic
dipole.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.961
It is to the magnetic field
what the electric dipole is to

00:15:00.961 --> 00:15:03.870
the electric field,
with one big difference.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.788
If you look at an electric
dipole, it really has a charge

00:15:07.788 --> 00:15:10.100
and a - charge at the two ends.
 

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:15.777
A magnetic dipole,
like a current loop here,

00:15:15.777 --> 00:15:21.720
doesn't have a and - magnetic
charge there.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.523
It's as if there is a and -
magnetic charge,

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:26.870
but there are no magnetic
charges.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.263
There are no isolated magnetic
charges that produce magnetic

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:33.600
fields the way electric charges
produce electric fields.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.330
If you had a magnetic monopole,
it will produce a radially

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.620
outgoing field,
like 1/r^(2),

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.649
but there is no such thing.
 

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.269
But there is something that
looks like a magnetic dipole.

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:46.538
In other words,
if this was a magnetic charge,

00:15:46.538 --> 00:15:49.596
that was a - magnetic charge,
then they would feel a magnetic

00:15:49.596 --> 00:15:52.908
field and they would obviously
line up with the magnetic field.

00:15:52.908 --> 00:15:57.509
The dipole will line up with
the field.

00:15:57.509 --> 00:16:01.379
Now it turns out you can get
some money out of this.

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:03.820
You can build a device.
 

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:11.711
The device I'm going to build
is an electric motor,

00:16:11.711 --> 00:16:20.077
because you can take a bar
magnet or any other magnet,

00:16:20.077 --> 00:16:26.548
with some magnetic field coming
here.

00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:29.009
This is the other end of the
magnet.

00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:35.658
You put a current loop here.
 

00:16:35.658 --> 00:16:39.779
Here are some wires coming out
of the current loop.

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:43.610
If you drive a current through
it, then let's see,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.893
if I drive the current like
this, the magnetic moment looks

00:16:46.893 --> 00:16:48.866
like that,
and the magnetic field,

00:16:48.866 --> 00:16:50.320
B, looks like this.
 

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.059
So it will flip till μ
aligns with B.

00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:55.158
Do you understand?
 

00:16:55.158 --> 00:16:59.998
It will flip so that the plane
of the loop is perpendicular to

00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:03.408
the field lines,
or parallel to this or that

00:17:03.408 --> 00:17:05.630
face of the two magnets.
 

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.172
But to do that,
of course, you have to drive

00:17:07.172 --> 00:17:07.710
some current.
 

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.538
So I take this current,
a source of current,

00:17:11.538 --> 00:17:14.118
and I connect it like that.
 

00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:19.589
Now, do you have any problem
with this invention?

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:20.140
Yes?
 

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.019
What's your problem?
 

00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:24.170
Student:  It will only
go until new aligned with

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.769
B, and then it will stop.
 

00:17:26.769 --> 00:17:27.630
Prof: That's right.
 

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.858
It's not going to run very long.
 

00:17:29.858 --> 00:17:32.910
It's going to flip till it
lines up and that's the end.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.480
And if it's already lined up,
it won't even do that.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.619
So this is not going to sell.
 

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:39.130
So what do you have to do?
 

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.630
You guys might know what you
have to do.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.920
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.980
AC?
 

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.598
Prof: AC?
 

00:17:47.598 --> 00:17:53.815
Suppose you only have a DC
voltage, what are you going to

00:17:53.815 --> 00:17:54.368
do?
 

00:17:54.368 --> 00:18:01.079
Suppose you're very quick with
your hands, what will you do?

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.009
Pardon me?
 

00:18:02.009 --> 00:18:03.480
Student:  Switch the
magnets.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.930
Prof: Okay, two things.
 

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.490
One is, switch the magnet.
 

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.527
You can also switch the wires
of the terminal,

00:18:09.527 --> 00:18:09.890
right?
 

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.808
You can keep doing this and you
can keep reversing the current.

00:18:12.808 --> 00:18:15.540
Every time this guy thinks it's
found happiness,

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.460
you say no, and turn it around.
 

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.788
And you go the other end,
you do it again.

00:18:19.788 --> 00:18:22.191
But that means you can never
leave this motor and go

00:18:22.191 --> 00:18:22.710
anywhere.
 

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.579
It's high maintenance.
 

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:26.848
So here is a very clever device.
 

00:18:26.848 --> 00:18:29.866
If you haven't thought about it
or if you don't know the answer,

00:18:29.866 --> 00:18:31.880
you'll be very impressed the
way--I was.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.968
Because that's the gap between
pure science and applied

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:35.539
science.
 

00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:37.539
It makes all the difference.
 

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:39.759
Here's what they did.
 

00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:47.858
These two wires feed into two
semicircular pieces of metal.

00:18:47.858 --> 00:18:50.588
Imagine that comes there,
that comes there.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.670
I've just blown it up for your
view.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.374
Then the battery is connected
like this, not with a hard wire,

00:18:57.374 --> 00:18:59.920
but with a spring loaded brush.
 

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.390
There's a brush here,
there's a spring holding it.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.364
So these brushes make contact
with these two metallic

00:19:06.364 --> 00:19:09.421
hemispheres, if you like,
semi cylinders,

00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:12.250
with them connected to this
wire.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.480
Now you can see what happens.
 

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.775
As the coil spins,
as shown here,

00:19:15.775 --> 00:19:20.077
the terminal is connected to
the top guy, the - to the bottom

00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:23.880
guy, so the current goes like
this and comes out.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.708
But half a revolution later,
this guy will be touching this

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:31.666
one, that guy will be touching
this one, and the current will

00:19:31.666 --> 00:19:32.460
reverse.
 

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.821
So the current reverses
automatically because you have

00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:39.501
this split circle and you have
the top half and bottom half

00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:41.472
split,
and then the current enters

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:43.358
this metallic part and goes like
this,

00:19:43.358 --> 00:19:45.549
and then later on goes the
other way.

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:47.710
That will keep running.
 

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.920
Also, in real life what happens
is,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:56.640
once it flips over,
in a real system,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.048
made up of real coils,
once it comes to equilibrium,

00:19:59.048 --> 00:20:03.519
it won't stop there,
even without the reversal.

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:07.644
It will go oscillating,
because it's got some moment of

00:20:07.644 --> 00:20:08.410
inertia.
 

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.476
You just cannot lose your
potential energy and have

00:20:10.476 --> 00:20:11.509
nothing to show for it.
 

00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:13.701
So what will happen is,
it will overshoot its goal a

00:20:13.701 --> 00:20:16.538
little bit, and then it will get
carried away to the other side.

00:20:16.538 --> 00:20:20.568
Then it will keep going round
and round.

00:20:20.568 --> 00:20:24.288
Okay, so that is an application
of the torque.

00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:26.278
That is for a DC motor and
you're quite right.

00:20:26.278 --> 00:20:28.732
If you have an AC motor,
then you put an alternating

00:20:28.732 --> 00:20:31.647
current supply,
but then you'll have to make

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:35.743
sure that the frequency of the
current supply will be the

00:20:35.743 --> 00:20:37.720
frequency of this motor.
 

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.009
Okay, so let's leave this board
here, because this is the end of

00:20:41.009 --> 00:20:41.740
one section.
 

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.558
You have to know where you
stand.

00:20:44.558 --> 00:20:46.779
We have done the first part of
magnetism,

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:51.269
which is, what are the forces
and what are the torques on

00:20:51.269 --> 00:20:54.960
either moving charges or
electric currents,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.480
in some simple situations?
 

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.165
Now we are going to come to the
more interesting part,

00:21:01.165 --> 00:21:04.922
also the more difficult part,
which is, how do currents

00:21:04.922 --> 00:21:06.868
produce magnetic fields?
 

00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:09.720
Now we're going to the cause of
the magnetic field.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.598
At the end, everything is
produced by charges,

00:21:13.598 --> 00:21:16.618
microscopic charges,
but the formula for that is

00:21:16.618 --> 00:21:20.344
quite difficult to calculate
because if you look at all the

00:21:20.344 --> 00:21:22.333
charges,
and they're moving around

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:25.648
producing magnetic field,
the field at any one location,

00:21:25.648 --> 00:21:28.269
because of the delay of
interaction,

00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:31.788
depends on what they were doing
at various times in the past.

00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:34.816
Just like electric fields are
also difficult to calculate if

00:21:34.816 --> 00:21:37.740
charges are moving because of
the relativistic theory that

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.868
says you cannot communicate
instantly with another place.

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:44.419
You can only do it at the speed
of light, so the field here

00:21:44.419 --> 00:21:47.785
depends on what was going on
earlier for the more remote

00:21:47.785 --> 00:21:48.519
charges.
 

00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:51.545
But in electrostatics,
we beat the problem by saying,

00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:54.279
"Look, none of these
charges ever moved.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:56.068
They've been there
forever."

00:21:56.068 --> 00:21:59.200
Then where they are now is
where they were before and we

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.680
can calculate the field.
 

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.244
The analogous thing for
magnetism is to say that if you

00:22:05.244 --> 00:22:09.048
have currents and the currents
are steady,

00:22:09.048 --> 00:22:14.067
then it's a case where the
magnetic field is also going to

00:22:14.067 --> 00:22:15.298
be constant.
 

00:22:15.298 --> 00:22:18.150
Remember, a steady current
doesn't mean there's no motion.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.327
It means the motion of these
charges round and round the loop

00:22:21.327 --> 00:22:22.069
is constant.
 

00:22:22.069 --> 00:22:24.420
It's not changing with time.
 

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.542
Do not confuse a steady current
with a single particle moving at

00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:31.170
a steady velocity.
 

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.869
That is not a steady current.
 

00:22:33.869 --> 00:22:36.710
You see the difference?
 

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.904
Because if you sit at any one
point in a wire in a closed

00:22:39.904 --> 00:22:42.130
loop, the current is always the
same.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.167
If you have the instrument,
called the ammeter,

00:22:44.167 --> 00:22:46.516
that reads the current,
you can put it where you like,

00:22:46.516 --> 00:22:47.890
you'll get the same answer.
 

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.243
But if a single charge is
carrying the current,

00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:53.108
there's a current here,
there's nothing anywhere else.

00:22:53.108 --> 00:22:57.328
There's a current only where
there is a charge.

00:22:57.328 --> 00:23:00.240
So it's like saying that when I
go on the freeway at 40 miles an

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.659
hour,
I do not myself constitute

00:23:02.659 --> 00:23:05.400
steady traffic,
because there is no traffic

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.230
where I am not.
 

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.670
It's the traffic with me now.
 

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.410
When I'm over there,
there's traffic there.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.464
What we mean by steady traffic
is cars are flowing constantly

00:23:13.464 --> 00:23:16.710
so at any instant,
every place looks the same.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.086
So a steady current is what
we're talking about,

00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:22.960
not a charge going at steady
velocity.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.816
So the question is,
what is the magnetic field

00:23:27.816 --> 00:23:33.858
produced by a tiny piece of
current sitting somewhere?

00:23:33.858 --> 00:23:36.651
This is a piece of current,
I times dl

00:23:36.651 --> 00:23:37.710
, do you understand?
 

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.029
You cannot have an isolated
piece of wire.

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:43.496
It's part of a bigger loop,
but I'm focusing on a tiny

00:23:43.496 --> 00:23:44.150
section.
 

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:52.380
And let us say it is located at
r'.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:58.318
Let's draw a picture so you
guys can see anything.

00:23:58.318 --> 00:24:03.522
I go to the point r',
and there I catch a piece of

00:24:03.522 --> 00:24:05.940
wire carrying a current.
 

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.450
The current is I,
the segment is called

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:09.509
dl.
 

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:12.950
I want the field at the point
r.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.720
There's nothing here.
 

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:21.692
I just want the field here,
and this vector separating them

00:24:21.692 --> 00:24:25.130
is r −
r'.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:33.009
So every segment of wire will
produce a little magnetic field,

00:24:33.009 --> 00:24:34.558
dB.
 

00:24:34.558 --> 00:24:37.809
And it's going to depend on the
orientation of the segment,

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:41.284
the current it carries and the
separation between where you are

00:24:41.284 --> 00:24:42.910
and where the current is.
 

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:49.130
And this is called the law of
Biot and Savart.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.772
It says the answer is
μ_0 over

00:24:52.772 --> 00:24:55.450
4Π times I
times

00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:00.584
dl x
e_rr`,

00:25:00.584 --> 00:25:04.970
divided by r −
r' squared.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.150
So let's take a minute to
understand this.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.707
μ_0/4Π,
like

00:25:10.707 --> 00:25:16.403
1/4Πε_0 is
a number whose value happens to

00:25:16.403 --> 00:25:20.078
be 10^(-7) in the units we are
using.

00:25:20.078 --> 00:25:23.057
That number is cooked up so
that if you've got 1 ampere here

00:25:23.057 --> 00:25:25.528
and 1 meter here and 10 meters
here and so on,

00:25:25.528 --> 00:25:30.368
you crank out all the numbers,
the field comes out in Tesla.

00:25:30.368 --> 00:25:32.420
So whenever you pick a system
of units,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.009
this has all the factors that
control the problem,

00:25:35.009 --> 00:25:37.674
you have to put a number in
front so that with all these

00:25:37.674 --> 00:25:40.886
measured in standard units,
this comes out in standard

00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:44.200
units and that number is
μ_0/4Π.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.328
That happens to be 10^(-7).
 

00:25:46.328 --> 00:25:51.326
r −r' is the separation
vector between where the current

00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:53.210
is and where you are.
 

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.680
I is the current flowing in
that circuit.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:03.031
And e_rr` is
the unit vector from r'

00:26:03.031 --> 00:26:04.538
to r.
 

00:26:04.538 --> 00:26:06.801
You can call it
e_rr` or

00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:09.855
e_r'r ,
as long as you know it is from

00:26:09.855 --> 00:26:11.440
the cause to the effect.
 

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.470
That's the formula.
 

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.279
That is a nasty formula,
because unlike Coulomb's

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:19.900
law--see, why is it more nasty?
 

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.058
Have you thought about it?
 

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:25.618
Why is it so much harder now
than for Coulomb?

00:26:25.618 --> 00:26:29.520
Remember, Coulomb's law was
just the unit vector divided by

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.528
r^(2).
 

00:26:30.528 --> 00:26:34.750
Why are we having all of these
nasty cross products here?

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.548
Yes?
 

00:26:35.548 --> 00:26:38.259
Student: 
&gt;

00:26:38.259 --> 00:26:40.598
Prof: What's making it?
 

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:42.380
What's bringing in all the
extra vectors?

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.185
Student:  The magnetic
field can never be worked

00:26:46.185 --> 00:26:48.088
&gt;
 

00:26:48.088 --> 00:26:50.325
Prof: Right,
but what's the cause of the

00:26:50.325 --> 00:26:53.289
magnetic field compared to the
cause of the electric field?

00:26:53.289 --> 00:26:54.140
Yes?
 

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.029
Student:  Moving charges.
 

00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:57.540
Prof: Right,
but the electric field is a

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.358
point charge.
 

00:26:58.358 --> 00:27:00.910
There is no vector associated
with that point charge.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:01.670
It's just sitting there.
 

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.190
The only vector you've got is
from the charge to the location.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.838
The current,
on the other hand,

00:27:06.838 --> 00:27:10.140
has got its own direction,
nothing to do with where it is.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.269
It's the way the little wire is
going at that point.

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:16.541
It's the presence of the extra
vector and separation vector

00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:20.040
that gives you a chance to form
yet another vector by combining

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.170
the two of them.
 

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.920
That's where you get these
cross products.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.838
But anyway, that's how nature
is.

00:27:24.838 --> 00:27:27.031
That's what happens,
so we've just got to say what

00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:27.390
it is.
 

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.895
So you've got to take this and
learn how to use it,

00:27:30.895 --> 00:27:32.858
so that's what we will do.
 

00:27:32.858 --> 00:27:39.702
So the first application of
this is going to be the field of

00:27:39.702 --> 00:27:44.690
a little circular loop of some
radius r,

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.134
and I'm going to find the field
at a distance z on the

00:27:49.134 --> 00:27:50.318
z axis.
 

00:27:50.318 --> 00:27:52.410
Say the loop is in the
xy plane.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:58.368
I want the field here.
 

00:27:58.368 --> 00:28:01.772
So what you will have to
do--think about what you have to

00:28:01.772 --> 00:28:02.318
do now.
 

00:28:02.318 --> 00:28:04.516
You've got this formula,
but what do you think you will

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:04.720
do?
 

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:10.750
The current here is I.
 

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.348
You guys have a game plan,
at least in principle?

00:28:14.348 --> 00:28:21.108
What will it take to calculate
the B field?

00:28:21.108 --> 00:28:23.029
Anybody from this wing has an
idea?

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.818
Yes?
 

00:28:23.818 --> 00:28:27.785
Student:  Find the field
due to a point charge on the

00:28:27.785 --> 00:28:30.998
circle and then you integrate--
Prof: He said find a

00:28:30.998 --> 00:28:32.650
field due to a point charge and
then integrate.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.430
Except for one thing,
you are right.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.619
Student: 
&gt;

00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:36.269
Prof: That's right.
 

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:41.950
Take a tiny line segment,
dl, here.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.348
Join at that point,
take the cross product.

00:28:44.348 --> 00:28:47.174
That's a vector you've got to
add to all the vectors coming

00:28:47.174 --> 00:28:48.930
from all the points in the
circle.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.039
That's your answer.
 

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:53.680
So I'm going to show you.
 

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.837
First of all,
is it clear to you that by the

00:28:55.837 --> 00:28:58.548
fact that the problem is
symmetric under rotations,

00:28:58.548 --> 00:29:02.285
with respect to this axis,
I can pick any one point and

00:29:02.285 --> 00:29:06.434
whatever it does can be used to
deduce what other points will

00:29:06.434 --> 00:29:06.920
do.
 

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.250
They're all in the same footing.
 

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.308
I want you to take this point
and this point for a minute.

00:29:12.308 --> 00:29:15.529
Here the current is coming out
of the blackboard,

00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:19.019
and here the current is going
into the blackboard.

00:29:19.019 --> 00:29:20.548
Are you with me now?
 

00:29:20.548 --> 00:29:23.416
The loop is half behind the
blackboard, half in front of the

00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:25.068
blackboard, and I slice it here.
 

00:29:25.068 --> 00:29:27.630
I just look at this guy and see
what it does.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.019
There's an element dl,
if you want,

00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:32.118
coming out of the blackboard
here.

00:29:32.118 --> 00:29:36.180
And the separation vector is
this one.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.088
If you take the cross product
of that vector with that vector,

00:29:40.088 --> 00:29:41.868
you've got to think about where
it will be,

00:29:41.868 --> 00:29:45.118
and it's got to be
perpendicular to this vector,

00:29:45.118 --> 00:29:47.250
therefore in the plane of the
blackboard.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.818
And it's got to be
perpendicular to this vector.

00:29:48.818 --> 00:29:53.974
And if you do your signs right,
it will give you magnetic

00:29:53.974 --> 00:29:58.210
contribution dB that
looks like that.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.730
But you know that the part of
dB that's going to

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.705
survive is the component here,
because this guy will produce a

00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:07.009
field like this.
 

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:09.828
And by symmetry,
they will have the same angle,

00:30:09.828 --> 00:30:12.709
so you only have to keep the
z component,

00:30:12.709 --> 00:30:15.098
not the one in the xy
plane.

00:30:15.098 --> 00:30:18.278
Because for every element I
find here, I can find a

00:30:18.278 --> 00:30:21.519
compensating one on the other
side of the circle.

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:26.170
So therefore,
dB along the z

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:30.143
direction is
μ_0I/

00:30:30.143 --> 00:30:36.282
4Π times the
segment coming out of the

00:30:36.282 --> 00:30:38.210
blackboard.
 

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.368
What about the
sinθ?

00:30:39.368 --> 00:30:42.029
Sine theta, here's where you've
got to be very careful.

00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:48.884
What do you think the
sinθ is between the

00:30:48.884 --> 00:30:55.608
segment coming out of the
blackboard and this guy?

00:30:55.608 --> 00:30:58.096
What's the angle between a line
that lies in the plane of the

00:30:58.096 --> 00:31:00.420
blackboard, and the line coming
out of the blackboard?

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.089
Student:  Ninety.
 

00:31:02.089 --> 00:31:02.769
Prof: Ninety.
 

00:31:02.769 --> 00:31:04.700
Don't be fooled by anything
else.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.365
Anything coming out of the
blackboard is orthogonal to

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:09.480
anything in the plane of the
blackboard.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.821
The wire is coming out of the
blackboard, this vector's in the

00:31:11.821 --> 00:31:12.130
plane.
 

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.950
There's no sine thetas to worry
about.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.346
But you've got to divide by the
square of the distance,

00:31:19.346 --> 00:31:23.579
and the square of the distance
happens to be z^(2)

00:31:23.579 --> 00:31:24.720
R^(2).
 

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.640
That's the square of the
distance.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.940
That will give you this part,
but I want that part.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.358
So that's cosine of this angle
α.

00:31:35.358 --> 00:31:38.440
Now let's see where I can get
the same cosine.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.109
The angle between two lines is
the same as the angle between

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:45.221
the perpendiculars,
so that guy is perpendicular to

00:31:45.221 --> 00:31:46.029
this guy.
 

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:49.465
This guy is perpendicular to
that guy, so that will also be

00:31:49.465 --> 00:31:49.940
alpha.
 

00:31:49.940 --> 00:32:01.464
And cosine α
will be R divided by z^(2)

00:32:01.464 --> 00:32:06.858
R^(2), ½.
 

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.920
So the sinθ didn't
come because of a

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.680
sinθ in the cross
product.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.955
This factor,
it came because you want the

00:32:13.955 --> 00:32:17.970
projection of this vector up the
z axis.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.978
We are not done,
because this is a contribution

00:32:19.978 --> 00:32:22.250
from a tiny link dl coming out
of the blackboard,

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:25.382
but notice the contribution is
independent of where you are on

00:32:25.382 --> 00:32:26.048
the circle.
 

00:32:26.048 --> 00:32:29.220
Everything makes a contribution
up the z axis.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.213
Each one makes a contribution
dl, so if you add up all

00:32:32.213 --> 00:32:34.509
of these, there's nothing to
integrate here.

00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:35.750
That's what I want you to
notice.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.160
z and R are fixed.
 

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.654
You've just got to integrate
dl, which will be

00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:41.730
2ΠR.
 

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:47.338
So I get μ_0
I/2ΠR squared,

00:32:47.338 --> 00:32:57.700
divided by 4Π,
divided by z^(2) R^(2)

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.980
to the power 3/2.
 

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.740
That is the magnetic field here.
 

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:12.880
So along the axis,
it will go like this.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:17.358
And what is it at the center of
the loop?

00:33:17.358 --> 00:33:18.838
That's a useful formula to
remember.

00:33:18.838 --> 00:33:23.538
At the center,
you put z = 0,

00:33:23.538 --> 00:33:26.964
you get
μ_0I times

00:33:26.964 --> 00:33:33.288
2ΠR^(2),
divided by 4ΠR^(3).

00:33:33.288 --> 00:33:41.973
That gives me
μ_0I/2R

00:33:41.973 --> 00:33:44.868
Tesla.
 

00:33:44.868 --> 00:33:47.358
And it's going to be pointing
straight up.

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:52.195
And if you go down here,
you will find it looks like

00:33:52.195 --> 00:33:52.858
this.
 

00:33:52.858 --> 00:33:55.361
Now if you want to find the
field somewhere else,

00:33:55.361 --> 00:33:57.705
it's a lot of work,
because you don't have the

00:33:57.705 --> 00:34:00.259
symmetries, but I will tell you
what you get.

00:34:00.259 --> 00:34:05.935
You will get these lines that
look exactly like--I'm not

00:34:05.935 --> 00:34:11.510
showing you the other half,
but that looks the same.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:16.780
Now that is supposed to remind
you again of a dipole.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.655
In fact, if you go to very,
very long distances,

00:34:20.655 --> 00:34:25.849
when z goes to infinity,
what does B look like?

00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:32.608
You go to the formula and let
z go to infinity,

00:34:32.608 --> 00:34:38.219
you will get--maybe I'll do it
again here.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:45.155
z goes to infinity,
B goes to

00:34:45.155 --> 00:34:51.429
μ_0
IΠR^(2),

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:59.940
divided by 2Πz^(3).
 

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.929
I'll tell you why I don't
cancel the pi's.

00:35:01.929 --> 00:35:06.474
I know you guys are dying to do
that, but ΠR^(2) times

00:35:06.474 --> 00:35:09.650
I is the dipole moment of
the loop.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.139
Remember, it's the area times
the current.

00:35:13.139 --> 00:35:17.250
So ignoring all the factors,
it looks like the dipole moment

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.289
divided by the distance cubed,
that's exactly how the field

00:35:21.289 --> 00:35:23.518
went for an electric dipole.
 

00:35:23.518 --> 00:35:26.760
So the magnetic dipole and
electric dipole are,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.960
again, similar.
 

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.679
So they're similar in two ways.
 

00:35:30.679 --> 00:35:33.827
Just like the electric dipole
aligns with the electric field,

00:35:33.827 --> 00:35:36.610
the magnetic dipole aligns with
the magnetic field.

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.360
That's the first thing.
 

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.030
The field of an electric dipole
has got these little circles

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.391
going out and the field of a
magnetic dipole also looks

00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:46.760
exactly like that.
 

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.277
The only difference is,
if you go into an electric

00:35:49.277 --> 00:35:52.309
dipole, you'll find two guys,
and -, producing the field.

00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:54.557
If you go into a magnetic
dipole, you'll find nothing at

00:35:54.557 --> 00:35:55.090
the center.
 

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.000
You'll just find a loop.
 

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.110
So nature gives us magnetic
dipoles, but not magnetic

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.289
monopoles.
 

00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:05.820
That doesn't mean they're not
there.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.409
People have been looking for
them.

00:36:07.409 --> 00:36:11.126
They've been spotted once,
but it's not been spotted

00:36:11.126 --> 00:36:11.710
again.
 

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.702
It could be because they're
very rare, and they're very

00:36:13.702 --> 00:36:15.880
heavy and they're very hard to
measure, or maybe they're not

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.250
there.
 

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.139
We don't know.
 

00:36:17.139 --> 00:36:21.130
But we don't see them the way
we see electric charges to be

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.369
sure they exist.
 

00:36:22.369 --> 00:36:29.494
Okay, now suppose I take one
coil and put under it a second

00:36:29.494 --> 00:36:37.358
coil and a third coil and I join
them all up and wrap them around

00:36:37.358 --> 00:36:44.527
some little cardboard tube,
you can imagine then these

00:36:44.527 --> 00:36:51.380
fields will all add up and
you'll get a field that looks

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.000
like this.
 

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:03.664
That looks exactly like a
magnetic field around a bar

00:37:03.664 --> 00:37:05.510
magnet.
 

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:06.230
Can you see that?
 

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.730
You saw the field due to one.
 

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.239
You can stack them up and then
you can compare the field.

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:17.871
As far as a compass needle is
concerned, if you put it here or

00:37:17.871 --> 00:37:21.460
there, it behaves the same way.
 

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.010
So now we have a question.
 

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.768
Here is a magnetic effect due
to current carrying loop,

00:37:27.768 --> 00:37:29.230
or due to currents.
 

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.949
Here is a magnetic effect due
to no currents.

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:34.960
Your magnet's not connected to
anything, so you have an option.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.574
Either you can say that's a new
kind of magnetism produced by

00:37:38.574 --> 00:37:40.396
god knows what,
or you can say,

00:37:40.396 --> 00:37:43.052
"I believe that everything
is coming from electric

00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:45.018
currents,"
and the question is,

00:37:45.018 --> 00:37:48.909
where are the currents in this
guy?

00:37:48.909 --> 00:37:58.579
Do you know where the currents
are in a bar magnet?

00:37:58.579 --> 00:38:02.139
No?
 

00:38:02.139 --> 00:38:04.349
Okay, let me give you a hint.
 

00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:08.518
It comes from the atomic theory
of materials.

00:38:08.518 --> 00:38:09.920
Don't think of this as a lump
of something.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.590
Yes?
 

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.900
Student:  The electrons.
 

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.030
Prof: That's right.
 

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:16.307
You know the atom has got
electrons going around,

00:38:16.307 --> 00:38:18.630
and every electron is a
current.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:25.284
Now you can ask,
let's put one electron here

00:38:25.284 --> 00:38:32.559
going like that,
then put another electron going

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:39.989
like that, another electron
going like that.

00:38:39.989 --> 00:38:41.650
What do you think they all do
together?

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.514
Suppose I've got nine electrons
in the plane of the blackboard

00:38:44.514 --> 00:38:45.969
all going around their atoms.
 

00:38:45.969 --> 00:38:48.512
You can see that in the region
between the atoms,

00:38:48.512 --> 00:38:50.260
they go in opposite directions.
 

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.139
This guy's going like that,
this guy's coming like this.

00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:54.610
They cancel.
 

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.900
The only thing that doesn't
cancel is along the perimeter.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.590
Everybody--what are these guys
doing?

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.230
Here we go.
 

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.949
Sorry.
 

00:39:04.949 --> 00:39:09.420
Yes, they do this.
 

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.336
It's a physical fact that when
many orbits are put next to each

00:39:13.336 --> 00:39:16.876
other, they cancel on the
interior and give you something

00:39:16.876 --> 00:39:18.139
on the boundary.
 

00:39:18.139 --> 00:39:21.195
So even though each atom is a
very tiny loop,

00:39:21.195 --> 00:39:24.530
if you've got 10^(23) atoms,
they can look like a

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:25.989
microscopic loop.
 

00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:28.418
Now that is just a two
dimensional loop,

00:39:28.418 --> 00:39:31.219
but you can take a solid,
a magnetic solid.

00:39:31.219 --> 00:39:34.010
It's go these little orbits
here.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:38.719
In every layer it's got orbits,
and each one is like a current.

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:43.393
So magnetic material is like
having a sheet of current,

00:39:43.393 --> 00:39:47.809
and of course that will produce
a magnetic field.

00:39:47.809 --> 00:39:50.476
There are a lot of subtleties,
but this is roughly what

00:39:50.476 --> 00:39:50.969
happens.
 

00:39:50.969 --> 00:39:53.750
This is how you get magnetism.
 

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:54.800
There are some questions.
 

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.119
One of them is,
why isn't everything magnetic?

00:39:58.119 --> 00:40:00.059
Why not this guy?
 

00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:03.690
It's got electrons, right?
 

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.952
Why aren't they lined up,
and which way should they line

00:40:06.952 --> 00:40:07.250
up?
 

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.789
Which way should the magnet
point?

00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:12.429
So the answer is,
many materials may contain

00:40:12.429 --> 00:40:15.989
equal number of electrons going
in opposite directions,

00:40:15.989 --> 00:40:18.170
so that some are going one way,
some are going the other way,

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.992
and for that reason,
each atom may cancel itself

00:40:21.992 --> 00:40:22.480
out.
 

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.699
Another possibility is,
every atom may have one net

00:40:25.699 --> 00:40:29.050
uncancelled electrons,
but the plane of the orbit for

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.789
each atom is different.
 

00:40:30.789 --> 00:40:33.155
Some are rotating in this
plane, some are rotating in that

00:40:33.155 --> 00:40:35.307
plane,
so there are little magnetic

00:40:35.307 --> 00:40:38.927
moment vectors pointing in
random directions and not lined

00:40:38.927 --> 00:40:39.309
up.
 

00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:42.460
And that happens because of
thermal agitation.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.559
Things like to jiggle when you
heat them.

00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:48.246
But when you cool them,
they can all line up and you

00:40:48.246 --> 00:40:51.210
suddenly find the material is
magnetic.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:55.032
So if you take a regular bar
magnet in your fridge and you

00:40:55.032 --> 00:40:58.452
put it on a hotplate for a
while, and you remove it,

00:40:58.452 --> 00:41:00.800
you'll find it's less magnetic.
 

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.735
So it's magnetic because you
caused these guys to jiggle

00:41:03.735 --> 00:41:04.110
more.
 

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.699
And beyond a temperature called
curie temperature,

00:41:06.699 --> 00:41:10.007
which depends on the material,
the jiggling will be so intense

00:41:10.007 --> 00:41:13.085
that magnetism is destroyed,
not atom by atom,

00:41:13.085 --> 00:41:18.096
but because they're no longer
able to act together and produce

00:41:18.096 --> 00:41:20.150
a net magnetic moment.
 

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:23.599
Then you can also take
materials in which every atom

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:27.728
has an electron that's willing
to line up, but they don't know

00:41:27.728 --> 00:41:29.420
which way to line up.
 

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.429
They can line up in any way
they like,

00:41:31.429 --> 00:41:34.079
but then if you put them in a
strong magnetic field,

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:36.817
then because every dipole likes
to line up with a magnetic

00:41:36.817 --> 00:41:39.128
field,
atomic moments line up with the

00:41:39.128 --> 00:41:40.099
magnetic field.
 

00:41:40.099 --> 00:41:43.007
And even if you take off the
magnetic field,

00:41:43.007 --> 00:41:44.969
the dipoles remain aligned.
 

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:48.119
Do you know why they remain
aligned?

00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:51.514
Because they are producing
their own magnetic field which

00:41:51.514 --> 00:41:52.849
keeps them in place.
 

00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:55.670
That's called a self consistent
solution.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.211
So the magnets,
if they all agree,

00:41:57.211 --> 00:41:58.952
"Hey,
let's line up,"

00:41:58.952 --> 00:42:01.329
can actually make it a stable
situation,

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:05.143
because when they do line up,
they produce their own magnetic

00:42:05.143 --> 00:42:07.750
field which encourages them to
line up.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.090
These are all interesting
things in magnetism,

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:15.655
but the starting point always
is to find out how to take these

00:42:15.655 --> 00:42:19.670
microscopic moments and make
them line up.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:25.239
So now I'm going to do--so this
is at least an explanation of

00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:29.393
why bar magnets are magnetic,
because they are really

00:42:29.393 --> 00:42:33.121
circulating currents,
and it's no different from this

00:42:33.121 --> 00:42:33.860
current.
 

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:42.012
Okay, now I'm going to find the
magnetic field for a very

00:42:42.012 --> 00:42:48.128
classic problem,
and that's the field of an

00:42:48.128 --> 00:42:50.750
infinite wire.
 

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:55.313
So here is the infinite wire
and we want to find the field it

00:42:55.313 --> 00:42:56.150
produces.
 

00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:05.275
You take a point here,
and let's take some segment of

00:43:05.275 --> 00:43:08.610
length dx.
 

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:15.398
And this is the separation
vector, and we want to find the

00:43:15.398 --> 00:43:19.449
field due to--dl is here.
 

00:43:19.449 --> 00:43:21.289
Now do the cross product.
 

00:43:21.289 --> 00:43:26.230
Turn screwdriver from dl
to R, it comes out of the

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.250
blackboard.
 

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:31.215
So this little guy makes a
contribution that comes out of

00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:32.420
the blackboard.
 

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.606
In fact, you can check that,
as you go along the line,

00:43:35.606 --> 00:43:39.335
everything acts in the same way
and makes a contribution coming

00:43:39.335 --> 00:43:40.900
out of the blackboard.
 

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.529
So what you can imagine is that
I just happened to slice it in

00:43:44.529 --> 00:43:48.039
this plane, but the real picture
is, the field lines will go

00:43:48.039 --> 00:43:49.230
around the wire.
 

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.250
Right now they're coming out of
the blackboard.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.617
Down here they're going into
the blackboard,

00:43:53.617 --> 00:43:55.820
and they are orbiting around
the wire.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.804
If you look at the wire from
the end, then the current is

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:01.300
coming towards you.
 

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.079
The field lines will look like
this.

00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:07.427
And what we're trying to
calculate is how strong is that

00:44:07.427 --> 00:44:08.059
field?
 

00:44:08.059 --> 00:44:12.876
So you go back to the famous
law, dB =

00:44:12.876 --> 00:44:18.349
μ_0I/4Π
times dl,

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:28.150
which is just dx,
divided by x^(2) a^(2).

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:34.280
Let's say the distance is
a.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.199
Then you need the sine of the
angle between the separation

00:44:38.199 --> 00:44:42.760
vector of the segment,
and the sine of the angle,

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:48.989
sinθ, is a divided
by square root of x^(2)

00:44:48.989 --> 00:44:50.409
a^(2).
 

00:44:50.409 --> 00:44:58.592
Then the integral of dB
is the integral of all these

00:44:58.592 --> 00:44:59.579
guys.
 

00:44:59.579 --> 00:45:04.067
Now you can guess what the
final answer is going to look

00:45:04.067 --> 00:45:07.250
like, just from dimensional
analysis.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.309
dx is a length,
a is a length.

00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:11.340
There are two lengths on the
top.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.840
The bottom there are three
powers of length,

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.239
an x^(2) or a^(2)
from this one,

00:45:15.239 --> 00:45:16.969
and the square root of a length
squared,

00:45:16.969 --> 00:45:18.460
which is another length.
 

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.409
You see that?
 

00:45:19.409 --> 00:45:22.039
Two powers of length at the
top, three in the bottom.

00:45:22.039 --> 00:45:24.914
The answer has to,
in the end, have dimensions of

00:45:24.914 --> 00:45:27.550
1 over length,
and the only length in town is

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:27.909
a.
 

00:45:27.909 --> 00:45:32.590
So you know it's going to look
like μ_0I/a.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:35.690
But then it could be half of
a, or 10 times a.

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:40.675
If you do that integral,
you'll find it's over

00:45:40.675 --> 00:45:42.449
2Πa.
 

00:45:42.449 --> 00:45:45.121
And I'm not doing the integral,
because we have seen this

00:45:45.121 --> 00:45:45.980
integral before.
 

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.639
dx over x^(2)
a^(2), to the 3/2.

00:45:48.639 --> 00:45:51.876
You make the tangent
substitution and then get secant

00:45:51.876 --> 00:45:53.309
this and secant that.
 

00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:55.990
So I don't want to do that
integral again,

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:59.130
but the answer is
μ_0I/2a.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:03.789
so the magnetic field from an
infinite wire falls from a

00:46:03.789 --> 00:46:06.500
distance like 1 over a.
 

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.268
Very much like the electric
problem.

00:46:08.268 --> 00:46:11.036
Even though single electric
charge produces a field that

00:46:11.036 --> 00:46:12.900
goes like 1 over r
squared,

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.782
if you remember,
infinite line produces a field

00:46:15.782 --> 00:46:17.849
that goes like 1 over r.
 

00:46:17.849 --> 00:46:20.061
Similarly, even though
elemental wire has a

00:46:20.061 --> 00:46:22.960
contribution that goes like 1
over distance squared,

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.199
when integrated over an
infinite line,

00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:27.530
the final field goes like
a,

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:33.317
1 over a,
where a is the distance

00:46:33.317 --> 00:46:36.840
from the axis of the wire.
 

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.121
For a homework problem,
I want you to notice that in

00:46:40.121 --> 00:46:42.440
this integral from - to
infinity,

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:47.170
the segment for the axis,
the segment for the - axis make

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:49.030
equal contributions.
 

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:51.440
In other words,
if you take this to be origin,

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.762
that segment and that segment
contribute equally to the field

00:46:54.762 --> 00:46:57.804
at any point,
because it's an even function

00:46:57.804 --> 00:46:58.768
of x.
 

00:46:58.768 --> 00:47:02.050
You will find it useful when
you do the problem set.

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:06.291
Okay, so here is an interesting
result, μ_0

00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:07.389
I/2Πa.
 

00:47:07.389 --> 00:47:10.199
Now that's going to explain a
few things.

00:47:10.199 --> 00:47:14.141
So here is a wire and I told
you long back when we started

00:47:14.141 --> 00:47:16.599
magnetism,
I said, if you put a test

00:47:16.599 --> 00:47:18.909
charge here and it moves like
this,

00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:22.460
it's attracted to the wire.
 

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.070
Now we can understand their
attraction.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:29.452
We understand the attraction as
follows - look at the thing from

00:47:29.452 --> 00:47:31.677
end on,
the current is coming--what do

00:47:31.677 --> 00:47:34.768
you think the direction of the
magnetic field here is?

00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:37.934
Again, you put your thumbs
around this one,

00:47:37.934 --> 00:47:41.099
it's curling,
therefore it's going into the

00:47:41.099 --> 00:47:45.469
blackboard here and coming out
of the blackboard here.

00:47:45.469 --> 00:47:50.313
That is the azimuthal magnetic
field seen from the plane of the

00:47:50.313 --> 00:47:51.329
blackboard.
 

00:47:51.329 --> 00:47:54.400
You've got this guy going to
velocity v here.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.556
Take the cross product of
v with somebody going

00:47:58.556 --> 00:48:02.242
into the blackboard,
you'll find you get a force

00:48:02.242 --> 00:48:03.889
towards the wire.
 

00:48:03.889 --> 00:48:06.867
That's why the charged particle
going along the current is

00:48:06.867 --> 00:48:09.739
attracted to the current,
if it's positively charged.

00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:13.266
If it's going in the opposite
direction, if you reverse the

00:48:13.266 --> 00:48:15.760
velocity, you will get the
opposite force,

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.010
so it will go away from the
wire.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.922
Finally, I want to mention the
experiment that people did

00:48:20.922 --> 00:48:23.990
before any of this which is to
notice that if you've got two

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:25.599
currents,
l_1 and

00:48:25.599 --> 00:48:28.831
l_2,
they attract each other if they

00:48:28.831 --> 00:48:32.980
are parallel and they repel if
they're anti-parallel.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.041
So if you went and asked
yourself, "How am I going

00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:39.215
to find the force that's
attractive when they're parallel

00:48:39.215 --> 00:48:41.199
or they're anti-parallel?"
 

00:48:41.199 --> 00:48:43.452
you can think of all kinds of
simple rules,

00:48:43.452 --> 00:48:46.780
maybe involving this current
vector and that current vector.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.603
But the correct answer is a
pretty complicated series of

00:48:50.603 --> 00:48:53.940
cross products on why these two
wires attract.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.010
Let me tell you why they
attract.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:57.809
I think you can see yourself.
 

00:48:57.809 --> 00:49:01.389
Take the force on this guy due
to I_1.

00:49:01.389 --> 00:49:06.364
It produces a field that looks
like this there and looks like

00:49:06.364 --> 00:49:07.360
that here.
 

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.025
So just like the single charge
here, this experiences a force

00:49:12.025 --> 00:49:15.369
towards the other wire,
every part of it.

00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:20.059
So the force that current 2
feels due to current 1 is

00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:24.389
μ_0I
_1/2Πa,

00:49:24.389 --> 00:49:26.489
where a is the distance between
them.

00:49:26.489 --> 00:49:30.768
That is my B.
 

00:49:30.768 --> 00:49:32.960
I, and that's my
l.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.340
If l_2
is the length of this wire.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.302
I'm just using the formula
BIl I told you

00:49:39.302 --> 00:49:39.889
about.
 

00:49:39.889 --> 00:49:42.581
So the B is the B
due to the first wire,

00:49:42.581 --> 00:49:45.525
I is the current of the
second wire, l is the

00:49:45.525 --> 00:49:47.050
length of the second wire.
 

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.454
So if you took an infinite
second wire, you're going to get

00:49:49.454 --> 00:49:51.815
nonsense, because you'll get
infinity as the force between

00:49:51.815 --> 00:49:52.768
two infinite wires.
 

00:49:52.768 --> 00:49:55.380
So it's more common to take the
force.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.539
Let me drop the arrow on this,
because I'm looking at the

00:49:58.539 --> 00:50:00.119
magnitude per unit length.
 

00:50:00.119 --> 00:50:05.463
Then it is just this,
μ_0I

00:50:05.463 --> 00:50:12.110
_1I_2
over 2Πa.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:13.677
And the current,
you know, is measured in

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:16.072
amperes,
which means if you took 1

00:50:16.072 --> 00:50:19.840
ampere in this wire and 1 ampere
in that wire,

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.096
and they were 1 meter apart,
the force between them will be

00:50:23.096 --> 00:50:27.764
μ_0/2Π,
which will be 2 times 10^(-7)

00:50:27.764 --> 00:50:30.190
newtons per unit length.
 

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:32.204
In other words,
if you're all holding this wire

00:50:32.204 --> 00:50:34.896
from running off to that wire,
and you are given 1 meter of

00:50:34.896 --> 00:50:39.148
the wire to take care of,
you will have to exert that

00:50:39.148 --> 00:50:39.940
force.
 

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.675
So attraction between wires in
the end has an explanation,

00:50:43.675 --> 00:50:45.510
but it's very complicated.
 

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:49.500
It does not simply involve the
two current directions.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.853
The first current,
through a series of cross

00:50:51.853 --> 00:50:54.226
products,
produces a magnetic field

00:50:54.226 --> 00:50:57.835
perpendicular to this wire,
and another cross product of

00:50:57.835 --> 00:51:01.413
that perpendicular field and the
current here gives you another

00:51:01.413 --> 00:51:03.780
vector which is the attraction
vector.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.840
So the force of attraction,
whereas force of attraction

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.597
between two charges is simply
q_1

00:51:07.597 --> 00:51:09.429
q_2 over r
squared,

00:51:09.429 --> 00:51:11.289
force of attraction between two
wires,

00:51:11.289 --> 00:51:13.159
even though it has a simple
formula,

00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:16.449
comes in the end from a whole
bunch of cross products.

00:51:16.449 --> 00:51:28.050
That's what you have to know.
 

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:45.166
All right, so now I'm going to
do a very basic result called

00:51:45.166 --> 00:51:49.518
Ampere's law.
 

00:51:49.518 --> 00:51:53.900
Ampere's law says the following
- look at the current coming

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.940
towards you.
 

00:51:54.940 --> 00:52:00.469
The field lines go like this.
 

00:52:00.469 --> 00:52:04.289
Let me call that angle Φ.
 

00:52:04.289 --> 00:52:08.655
Then the magnetic field is a
unit vector in the Φ

00:52:08.655 --> 00:52:12.601
direction times
μ_0I divided

00:52:12.601 --> 00:52:16.710
by 2Πr,
where r is the distance.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:18.639
This is the wire, okay?
 

00:52:18.639 --> 00:52:21.650
And I am looking at various
circles.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:25.639
This is the circle of radius
r. Here is what B

00:52:25.639 --> 00:52:26.518
looks like.
 

00:52:26.518 --> 00:52:30.235
So B is circulating
around the wire,

00:52:30.235 --> 00:52:32.980
very different from E.
 

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.989
E emanates from charges,
but has no circulation.

00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:41.389
Its line integral on a closed
loop is 0, electrostatically.

00:52:41.389 --> 00:52:43.420
The magnetic field is just the
opposite.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.427
It's always going around in
circles and therefore has a line

00:52:46.427 --> 00:52:48.389
integral,
and I will mention later on

00:52:48.389 --> 00:52:51.811
that it has no surface integral,
because Bs don't start

00:52:51.811 --> 00:52:52.880
and end anywhere.
 

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.588
The lines of B,
therefore if you took any

00:52:55.588 --> 00:52:58.182
surface, whatever line comes in
has to go out,

00:52:58.182 --> 00:52:59.739
because it cannot stop.
 

00:52:59.739 --> 00:53:03.494
I'll come to that in a minute,
but let's look at the line

00:53:03.494 --> 00:53:06.110
integral of B around a
circle.

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:11.800
B⋅dr
around a circle.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:17.500
So on a circle,
take a section of a circle.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.039
So here is my portion of a
circle.

00:53:22.039 --> 00:53:26.463
dR =
rdΦ times unit

00:53:26.463 --> 00:53:29.550
vector in the phi direction.
 

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.139
Do you agree with that?
 

00:53:31.139 --> 00:53:33.811
The tangent vector to the
circle, a tiny little guy,

00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:36.380
has length r times
dΦ.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.371
r is this one,
and points in the direction of

00:53:39.371 --> 00:53:41.659
the unit vector in the phi
direction.

00:53:41.659 --> 00:53:44.518
So
e_Φ

00:53:44.518 --> 00:53:46.860
is unit vector like that.
 

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:50.579
B is already this.
 

00:53:50.579 --> 00:54:00.438
Therefore B⋅e
_rdr looks

00:54:00.438 --> 00:54:06.119
like
μ_0I/2Π

00:54:06.119 --> 00:54:09.630
times integral...
 

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.896
because the dot product of the
two vectors, because they're

00:54:12.896 --> 00:54:15.373
both azimuthal,
is simply the product of this

00:54:15.373 --> 00:54:16.670
guy times that guy.
 

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.518
I'm sorry.
 

00:54:18.518 --> 00:54:27.219
Please change this R to
little r.

00:54:27.219 --> 00:54:30.847
In other words,
I want that distance to be

00:54:30.847 --> 00:54:32.440
little r.
 

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.409
You can also use big R.
 

00:54:33.409 --> 00:54:35.981
It's going to cancel out,
but I'm not taking a fixed

00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:36.889
length r.
 

00:54:36.889 --> 00:54:38.916
I'm taking r to be
variable, so I want to use

00:54:38.916 --> 00:54:39.909
little r for it.
 

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:41.719
So rdΦ is the
length.

00:54:41.719 --> 00:54:45.601
The point to notice is that the
field goes like 1 over r,

00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:47.820
the arc length goes like
r.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.320
So they cancel.
 

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.949
Integral of
dΦ is

00:54:51.949 --> 00:54:55.820
2Π and I get
μ_0I.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.038
So the line integral of the
magnetic field are on a closed

00:55:00.038 --> 00:55:02.860
loop,
penetrated by a current,

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:08.527
= μ_0 times
the current coming out of that

00:55:08.527 --> 00:55:09.550
surface.
 

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:12.030
Independent of the radius of
the circle.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:14.885
You can take a small circle,
you can take a big circle,

00:55:14.885 --> 00:55:16.630
you always get the same answer.
 

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.313
Because if you take a big
circle, you've got a big

00:55:19.313 --> 00:55:21.449
circumference growing like
r,

00:55:21.449 --> 00:55:25.579
but the field goes like 1 over
r and the effects cancel.

00:55:25.579 --> 00:55:30.659
This remind you of something
you've seen before?

00:55:30.659 --> 00:55:31.489
Which one?
 

00:55:31.489 --> 00:55:32.820
Student:  The plane.
 

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.719
Prof: No,
where these things cancel.

00:55:35.719 --> 00:55:36.550
Pardon me?
 

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:42.530
Student:  Gauss's law
_______________.

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:44.079
Prof: Like Gauss's law,
you mean?

00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:44.829
Student:  Yes.
 

00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:45.856
Prof: Yes,
Gauss's law,

00:55:45.856 --> 00:55:48.867
where you took a single charge,
the surface integral of E

00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:51.969
was independent of the size
of the sphere,

00:55:51.969 --> 00:55:54.980
because the field went like 1
over r^(2).

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.097
Area of the sphere went like
r^(2),

00:55:57.097 --> 00:55:59.989
and surface integral just said
it's equal to the q

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:00.920
that's inside.
 

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.769
Then of course we found it's
true, even if the shape is not

00:56:03.769 --> 00:56:04.360
spherical.
 

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:07.478
Again, we find here,
first you take a circle and you

00:56:07.478 --> 00:56:11.210
find the answer is independent
of the radius of the circle.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:15.648
Then I'm going to show you that
the answer is independent,

00:56:15.648 --> 00:56:18.139
even of the shape of the loop.
 

00:56:18.139 --> 00:56:22.110
So let the current be here.
 

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:28.050
So take a loop like that.
 

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:35.900
So take a portion of that loop,
this portion here.

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:41.849
It's got a radial part and a
tangential part.

00:56:41.849 --> 00:56:46.987
So you can see the dr of
the loop is dr times

00:56:46.987 --> 00:56:51.152
e_r
rdΦ times

00:56:51.152 --> 00:56:54.429
e_
Φ.

00:56:54.429 --> 00:56:56.018
Let me blow this up for you if
you like.

00:56:56.018 --> 00:57:01.092
So that is that segment there,
dr, and that's got an

00:57:01.092 --> 00:57:03.980
angular part and a radial part.
 

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:08.059
The radial part is length
dr, the angular part is

00:57:08.059 --> 00:57:10.360
length rdΦ.
 

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.659
So integrating along that
curve, which I can approximate

00:57:13.659 --> 00:57:16.931
by a straight line,
I can break up that elemental

00:57:16.931 --> 00:57:20.500
vector dr into the tiny portion
in the angular one,

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.340
tiny portion in the radial one.
 

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:27.534
But B =
μ_0I/2Πr

00:57:27.534 --> 00:57:32.268
times e_
Φ.

00:57:32.268 --> 00:57:35.050
So when you take
B⋅dr,

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:36.188
e_r
⋅

00:57:36.188 --> 00:57:37.360
e_Φ is
0,

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.559
because they are perpendicular
vectors.

00:57:39.559 --> 00:57:46.846
All you get then is
B⋅dr

00:57:46.846 --> 00:57:53.538
will be μ_0I
over 2Π

00:57:53.538 --> 00:57:56.809
dΦ.
 

00:57:56.809 --> 00:58:01.827
So the line integral of B
receives the contribution

00:58:01.827 --> 00:58:07.373
equal to simply the angle of the
two rays that bound this little

00:58:07.373 --> 00:58:08.429
segment.
 

00:58:08.429 --> 00:58:10.889
Then you can see if you go
around the whole loop,

00:58:10.889 --> 00:58:14.346
you will just add up all the
dΦ's and you

00:58:14.346 --> 00:58:16.550
will get 2Π and you
will get

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:18.280
μ_0I.
 

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.025
So the answer is true,
even if it is not a circle,

00:58:22.025 --> 00:58:25.846
as long as it is a closed loop,
enclosing the wire,

00:58:25.846 --> 00:58:29.210
the answer is equal to current
enclosed.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:41.110
What if you took a loop here
and the current's actually here?

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:44.731
There's no current going out of
this guy, so we'd better get 0

00:58:44.731 --> 00:58:46.809
for that and we want to know
why.

00:58:46.809 --> 00:58:49.469
You'll get 0 because if you do
the same formula,

00:58:49.469 --> 00:58:50.909
it will give you integral of
dΦ,

00:58:50.909 --> 00:58:54.780
but notice if you go round here
and come back all the way here,

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.190
the change in Φ is 0.
 

00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:58.268
Can you see that?
 

00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:02.163
In any loop bounded by some
lines, the range of Φ

00:59:02.163 --> 00:59:04.710
as you follow it goes back to
0.

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:08.969
Whereas if you encircle the
origin, then Φ

00:59:08.969 --> 00:59:10.768
changes by 2Π.
 

00:59:10.768 --> 00:59:13.871
So if you take a point here and
you go around in a loop,

00:59:13.871 --> 00:59:15.789
you come back to the same
Φ.

00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:18.393
If you take a point here and
you go around,

00:59:18.393 --> 00:59:19.820
phi goes up by 2Π.
 

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.204
That's why a loop not enclosing
a current will get 0

00:59:23.204 --> 00:59:24.199
contribution.
 

00:59:24.199 --> 00:59:28.639
A loop enclosing a current will
get μ_0I.

00:59:28.639 --> 00:59:32.835
And finally,
by superposition,

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:40.360
if you've got many,
many wires coming out of this.

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.869
Some are going in,
some are coming out,

00:59:41.869 --> 00:59:43.980
some are going in,
some are coming out,

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:49.646
then integral of
B⋅dr =

00:59:49.646 --> 00:59:55.550
μ_0 times sum of
all the currents,

00:59:55.550 --> 01:00:16.130
I_j penetrates
the surface bounded by the loop.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:19.250
That's because B is made
up of B due to this guy,

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:22.300
that guy, that guy,
but the integral of the total

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.780
B is the individual
integrals.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.119
Each one gives you its own
current.

01:00:27.119 --> 01:00:31.030
So superposition is a great and
powerful result.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:33.652
If you can do anything for one
charge or one current,

01:00:33.652 --> 01:00:35.719
you're able to add everything
together.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:50.960
So this is called the law of
Ampere.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.094
Now I might as well tell you,
the surface integral of

01:00:57.094 --> 01:01:02.639
B on any closed surface
is actually 0.

01:01:02.639 --> 01:01:07.286
Because if you took electric
charges, they've got lines

01:01:07.286 --> 01:01:09.869
coming out like this,
right?

01:01:09.869 --> 01:01:13.458
And if you took a surface,
you get some contribution from

01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:17.239
the dot product of the field
vector with the area vector.

01:01:17.239 --> 01:01:19.920
Magnetic lines never end
anywhere.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.829
They always close.
 

01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:26.389
So take whatever surface you
want, any line that enters it

01:01:26.389 --> 01:01:30.630
will also leave it,
because there's nowhere to end.

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:34.244
Had there been magnetic
charges, magnetic monopoles,

01:01:34.244 --> 01:01:38.355
lines will either come out of
the monopole or collapse into

01:01:38.355 --> 01:01:39.559
the monopole.
 

01:01:39.559 --> 01:01:42.688
Then the surface integral of
B will count the magnetic

01:01:42.688 --> 01:01:43.210
charges.
 

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:44.679
But we have not found any.
 

01:01:44.679 --> 01:01:46.994
So as of now,
the surface integral of

01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:49.757
B is 0,
the line integral of B

01:01:49.757 --> 01:01:52.329
is the current trapped by that
loop.

01:01:52.329 --> 01:01:52.860
Do you understand?
 

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:57.784
You take that loop and you draw
a plane with that loop as a

01:01:57.784 --> 01:01:58.719
boundary.
 

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:02.476
Then any current coming out of
that is going to be equal to the

01:02:02.476 --> 01:02:04.719
line integral up to this factor
mu.

01:02:04.719 --> 01:02:07.090
For the electric field,
just for comparison,

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:12.027
the line integral of the
electric field is 0 and the

01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:17.351
surface integral of the electric
field = the charge over

01:02:17.351 --> 01:02:19.869
ε_0.
 

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.829
So here is this one integral.
 

01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:25.485
Let me write it here,
B⋅dr

01:02:25.485 --> 01:02:29.500
= μ_0 times all the
currents crossing it.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:34.860
So it's very useful for you to
write these 4 mathematical

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.010
equations.
 

01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:47.619
These are called the integral
form of the Maxwell equations,

01:02:47.619 --> 01:02:50.851
namely, it's the relation
between electric and magnetic

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:54.143
fields written in terms of the
integrals of electric and

01:02:54.143 --> 01:02:55.340
magnetic fields.
 

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.208
There's something called the
differential form of the

01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:58.610
magnetic field which is more
useful,

01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:06.561
which requires more mathematics
than we have done in this

01:03:06.561 --> 01:03:07.840
course.
 

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.514
But this is all for the case of
electrostatics and

01:03:11.514 --> 01:03:14.440
magnetostatics,
very, very important.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.059
All the currents have to be
constant;

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:19.260
all the charges have to be
fixed.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:25.059
Only then is this true.
 

01:03:25.059 --> 01:03:28.103
It turns out this is all you
really need to determine

01:03:28.103 --> 01:03:29.920
electric and magnetic fields.
 

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.952
Suppose someone comes to you
and says, "I'm going to

01:03:32.952 --> 01:03:34.469
give you all the currents.
 

01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:37.139
I'm going to give you all the
charges.

01:03:37.139 --> 01:03:39.619
Can you find E and
B?"

01:03:39.619 --> 01:03:41.230
It's a mathematical problem.
 

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:44.512
The mathematical statement is
you know the line integral of

01:03:44.512 --> 01:03:47.967
either field around any loop and
you know the surface integral

01:03:47.967 --> 01:03:49.268
around any surface.
 

01:03:49.268 --> 01:03:52.469
It turns out that's all you
need.

01:03:52.469 --> 01:03:55.422
The line and surface integrals
are known for every possible

01:03:55.422 --> 01:03:58.630
loop and every possible surface,
then the solution is unique.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:03.447
That's why this is all you
really need to do any problem in

01:04:03.447 --> 01:04:04.860
magnetostatics.
 

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.132
Because you might think,
maybe this guy's going to write

01:04:07.132 --> 01:04:08.000
two more equations.
 

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.179
I'm saying mathematically,
this is complete.

01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:13.860
On the other hand,
if I stopped at one of them,

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:16.820
except for the electric field,
if all I told you was this one,

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:23.219
then mathematically it's not
enough to solve the problem.

01:04:23.219 --> 01:04:29.313
Okay, so I'm going to use
Ampere's law the way I used

01:04:29.313 --> 01:04:35.289
Gauss's law to show you some
simple applications.

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:39.737
Suppose someone gives you an
infinite wire and says,

01:04:39.737 --> 01:04:43.139
"Find the field around
it."

01:04:43.139 --> 01:04:46.744
Now you can do that nasty
integral which I did on the top

01:04:46.744 --> 01:04:49.768
right corner,
but now we don't have to do it.

01:04:49.768 --> 01:04:55.079
Because you will argue by
symmetry that the field here

01:04:55.079 --> 01:05:00.989
cannot be pointing to the left
or pointing to the right,

01:05:00.989 --> 01:05:03.902
should lie in the plane,
because there's no reason to

01:05:03.902 --> 01:05:05.469
bias one way or the other.
 

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:08.639
And in the plane perpendicular
to it, the field should be

01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:12.094
invariant when you rotate the
wire, because the wire looks the

01:05:12.094 --> 01:05:13.679
same when you rotate it.
 

01:05:13.679 --> 01:05:16.681
So the only possible things I
can think of are,

01:05:16.681 --> 01:05:20.271
the field can look like this,
or the field can look like

01:05:20.271 --> 01:05:20.860
this.
 

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:24.601
They both have the property
that when you rotate the wire,

01:05:24.601 --> 01:05:25.980
they look the same.
 

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.710
But you can rule this one out.
 

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:31.867
One way to rule it out is to
say that if all the magnetic

01:05:31.867 --> 01:05:35.137
field lines end on the wire,
there must be magnetic charges

01:05:35.137 --> 01:05:36.659
and we don't have them.
 

01:05:36.659 --> 01:05:39.099
Another way which is more
subtle is to say,

01:05:39.099 --> 01:05:42.750
if this was the field
configuration for this current,

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:46.862
if I reverse the current,
everything should reverse and

01:05:46.862 --> 01:05:49.530
the lines should go outwards
now.

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:52.081
On the other hand,
if I took this infinite wire

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:54.690
and I rotated it like that
around this axis,

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.789
the current will point the
other way,

01:05:56.789 --> 01:06:00.690
but the field lines would still
keep going radially in.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:04.235
That means if I took that
current and I flipped it around,

01:06:04.235 --> 01:06:07.780
the field lines still go the
center, but I has become - I,

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.710
so that rules this one out.
 

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:13.409
But you can easily satisfy
yourself with this configuration

01:06:13.409 --> 01:06:16.920
of circling things will satisfy
all the requirements.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.760
So I know the field is
azimuthal, goes around the wire.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.472
I know it depends only on the
distance from the wire and not

01:06:23.472 --> 01:06:26.737
where I am in the circle,
therefore I look at the wire

01:06:26.737 --> 01:06:30.762
end on and I know that there's a
field here in the angular

01:06:30.762 --> 01:06:31.679
direction.
 

01:06:31.679 --> 01:06:35.923
I also know the line integral
of B⋅dr

01:06:35.923 --> 01:06:38.340
= μ_0I.
 

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.969
This is like Gauss's law.
 

01:06:39.969 --> 01:06:42.630
You cannot find from it
B separately,

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.978
except in the lucky case where
B⋅dr

01:06:45.978 --> 01:06:48.610
is a constant over the
entire circle,

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:52.177
which it is in this case,
because it's simply B

01:06:52.177 --> 01:06:53.659
times 2Πr.
 

01:06:53.659 --> 01:06:56.438
If B is azimuthal,
which I've argued for,

01:06:56.438 --> 01:06:59.394
the line integral is B
times 2Πr =

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:01.110
μ_0I.
 

01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:08.018
That means B = μ_0
I/2Πr.

01:07:08.018 --> 01:07:11.414
So what I'm telling you is just
like Gauss's law,

01:07:11.414 --> 01:07:13.820
will only give you one
equation.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:18.996
If you told me to find the
field due to an arbitrary

01:07:18.996 --> 01:07:23.362
distribution of currents,
I can still write this true

01:07:23.362 --> 01:07:26.507
statement,
but I cannot deduce from it the

01:07:26.507 --> 01:07:28.018
value of B.
 

01:07:28.018 --> 01:07:30.170
But if it's due to this
infinite wire and you've got

01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:32.574
enough symmetries and the only
thing you don't know is the

01:07:32.574 --> 01:07:34.599
magnitude of B as you
vary r,

01:07:34.599 --> 01:07:36.429
then on a contour of fixed
r,

01:07:36.429 --> 01:07:37.699
there's only one unknown,
which is,

01:07:37.699 --> 01:07:40.648
how big is B as a
function of r in the

01:07:40.648 --> 01:07:41.920
azimuthal direction.
 

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.530
Then the one number you get
from this one equation.

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:52.559
Now here's another variation of
that problem.

01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:56.969
They all have analogs in
electrostatics.

01:07:56.969 --> 01:08:03.583
Imagine that I have a solid
cable carrying current I,

01:08:03.583 --> 01:08:07.059
coming out of the blackboard.
 

01:08:07.059 --> 01:08:11.780
And let's say this cable has
radius R.

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:17.310
Then I want the magnetic field
here.

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:20.091
Now the real problem is much
more difficult than before,

01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:23.380
because there you had a single
line, you could do the integral.

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.538
If you have a blob,
a cylindrical blob,

01:08:25.538 --> 01:08:28.836
you do all the dl cross
r's for everything is

01:08:28.836 --> 01:08:30.939
going to be very,
very difficult.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:35.220
But now we're going to argue by
symmetry that this one should

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:39.359
also have necessarily fields
that go around in circles,

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:42.220
with a uniform strength on a
circle of given radius.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:46.154
Then you conclude then that
2Πr times B =

01:08:46.154 --> 01:08:48.020
μ_0I.
 

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:54.158
Therefore B =
μ_0I divided

01:08:54.158 --> 01:08:59.176
by 2Πr,
which is exactly the field you

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:03.960
would get from a point wire
carrying all the current.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.439
Again, this should remind you
of Gauss's law,

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:10.101
but if you have a ball of
charge, the field due to it

01:09:10.101 --> 01:09:14.538
looks like the field of a point
charge sitting at its center.

01:09:14.538 --> 01:09:17.328
Likewise the field of a uniform
distribution,

01:09:17.328 --> 01:09:19.779
a tube of current coming
towards you,

01:09:19.779 --> 01:09:23.729
outside this tube looks like
it's all coming from the center,

01:09:23.729 --> 01:09:27.228
because that's what it will
look like if the entire current

01:09:27.228 --> 01:09:29.279
were concentrated on the center.
 

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:31.430
But you will see the difference
now.

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:36.270
If you go inside this and ask,
what's the magnetic field on a

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:40.149
circle lying inside this,
then again you can say

01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:44.270
2Πr times B =
μ_0 times the

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:47.289
current that's enclosed by that
loop,

01:09:47.289 --> 01:09:49.390
not the entire current.
 

01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:54.217
And I think by now you guys
should know, that will be this

01:09:54.217 --> 01:09:56.930
fraction of the total current.
 

01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:00.036
Or if you want to see the
details, you can put a pi there

01:10:00.036 --> 01:10:01.590
and you can put a pi here.
 

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:04.003
I/ΠR^(2) is
the current density and

01:10:04.003 --> 01:10:06.038
ΠR^(2) is the area of
this guy.

01:10:06.038 --> 01:10:09.246
But by now you guys should know
that things scale like distance

01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:11.159
squared if you're looking at
areas.

01:10:11.159 --> 01:10:12.470
So what does that tell me now?
 

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:15.641
It's
μ_0Ir^(2)

01:10:15.641 --> 01:10:17.948
over big R^(2).
 

01:10:17.948 --> 01:10:21.479
So for B,
it looks like

01:10:21.479 --> 01:10:28.538
μ_0Ir
divided by 2ΠR^(2),

01:10:28.538 --> 01:10:31.270
with r less than or
equal to R.

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:34.530
And this is the formula for
r bigger than or equal to

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.140
R.
 

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:41.630
And you can test the formula
when little r = R.

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:42.520
That's correct.
 

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.970
Little r = R, they agree.
 

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:51.662
Therefore the magnetic field as
a function of r grows

01:10:51.662 --> 01:10:56.680
inside the cylinder and then
decays as 1/r.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.537
All this should be familiar to
you if you still remember

01:10:59.537 --> 01:11:01.408
similar problems from Gauss's
law.

01:11:01.408 --> 01:11:03.988
If you've got a ball of charge,
the electric charge grows

01:11:03.988 --> 01:11:05.828
linearly when you're inside the
ball,

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:08.320
because as you grow,
you're enclosing more and more

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.103
charge,
which is growing like

01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:12.554
r^(3),
but the sphere is growing like

01:11:12.554 --> 01:11:13.270
r^(2).
 

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:16.198
So it grows like r,
but once you cross the sphere,

01:11:16.198 --> 01:11:18.189
you go to bigger and bigger
spheres,

01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:20.430
you're not enclosing more
charge, but the sphere for

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:23.689
Gauss's law is getting bigger,
so it falls like 1/r^(2).

01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:27.291
Similarly here,
it falls like 1/r when

01:11:27.291 --> 01:11:31.466
you're outside the cylinder,
and grows linearly with

01:11:31.466 --> 01:11:35.149
r when you're inside the
cylinder.

01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:39.560
Now there are a couple of other
miscellaneous applications which

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.100
I will do next time.
 

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:46.000

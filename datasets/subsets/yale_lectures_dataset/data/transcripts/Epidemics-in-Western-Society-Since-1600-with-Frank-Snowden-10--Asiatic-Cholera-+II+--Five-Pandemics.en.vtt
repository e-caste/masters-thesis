00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.000
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.330
We can continue with our
subject of Asiatic cholera.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.814
And I thought we could perhaps
frame that discussion by

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:18.298
reminding you that in the 1990s
the Nobel Prize winning

00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:21.699
microbiologist,
Joseph Lederer,

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.900
coined a term,
"emerging diseases."

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.330
He used it to describe
infectious diseases that are

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.604
previously unknown,
at least as sources of human

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:37.683
infection,
and emerge, as it were,

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:41.580
for the first time to infect
human beings.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.035
These are diseases--in our own
day we can think of Ebola or

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:50.233
Lyme's disease,
SARS, or of course,

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:53.150
most importantly,
HIV/AIDS.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.880
Often the press--which seems,
I would argue,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.219
to suffer chronically from
historical amnesia--

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.567
it often treats the appearance
of new infections as something

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:12.912
unprecedented,
unnatural, that never happened

00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:14.010
before.
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.239
But the reality is that Charles
Darwin was correct.

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:22.833
We live in the midst of a
constantly evolving microbial

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:28.277
world in which the microbes have
an inherent advantage because of

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:31.510
the frequency of their
mutations,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.110
and the extremely brief length
of a microbial generation,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.379
compared with a human one.
 

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:44.560
So, new diseases have always
been emerging and appearing.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.000
And Asiatic cholera is a good
example of what we might--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.456
though let's be mindful,
it would be historically

00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:55.808
anachronistic--
we might call it a great

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:59.709
emerging disease of the
nineteenth century.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.828
There is a scholarly debate on
whether cholera had long existed

00:02:05.828 --> 00:02:11.257
on the Indian subcontinent,
and whether it went back for

00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:13.330
centuries or not.
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.000
It clearly, by the early
nineteenth century,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.210
had an endemic home on the
Indian subcontinent,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.890
and particularly the area here
in the delta of the Ganges and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.580
Brahmaputra Rivers.
 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.068
That's that area.
 

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:39.250
There are accounts of diseases
in various writings that are

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.520
suggestive of cholera well
before the nineteenth century.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.840
But that particular debate is
exotic for our purposes,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.306
and what we want to know is
that by the early nineteenth

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:57.530
century it was endemic in the
Indian subcontinent.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.788
But it was unknown elsewhere in
the world,

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:05.519
until it burst into a major
epidemic in 1817 that then

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.158
escaped India and began its
devastating international

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:14.217
career,
reaching Europe for the first

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:15.658
time in 1830.
 

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:20.240
Cholera for the nineteenth
century was something new,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.438
something never before
experienced,

00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:28.754
and that helps to explain a
good part of the reaction to the

00:03:28.754 --> 00:03:32.990
populations that were first
afflicted by it,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.514
as the "great
cholera,"

00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:41.690
we should remember,
was the great feared disease of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.818
the nineteenth century.
 

00:03:43.818 --> 00:03:47.542
We've already seen that plague
was the most dreaded disease,

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:50.949
from the fourteenth century
through the seventeenth.

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.404
And we know that smallpox
succeeded it in that role in the

00:03:55.404 --> 00:03:56.419
eighteenth.
 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.448
Cholera, though not the great
killer of the nineteenth

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.639
century, was the most feared
affliction.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.082
It was feared for a number of
reasons: its extremely sudden

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:12.294
appearance;
its exotic and unfamiliar

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:16.002
character;
the agonizing and gruesome

00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:21.060
nature of its symptoms;
its high case fatality rate;

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.608
and its predilection for adults
in the prime of life,

00:04:25.608 --> 00:04:27.620
rather than children.
 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.767
It's revealing that a great
deal of the discussion

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:33.660
surrounding the early
experiences with cholera

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.129
revolved around the question of
whether this was,

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.819
in fact, the return of the
plague.

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.129
Some of the names that were
given to cholera capture the

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.620
fear it inspired.
 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.470
It was known in all kinds of
ways.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.952
If you read the medical
journals of the nineteenth

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:52.548
century,
and the press,

00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:55.519
you see it was called Asiatic
cholera,

00:04:55.519 --> 00:05:00.245
cholera morbus,
perhaps very scaringly

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:04.778
cholera asphyxia;
it was known as "the

00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:07.283
gypsy," "the
monster,"

00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:10.971
"blue cholera"
and "King Cholera,"

00:05:10.971 --> 00:05:13.129
among other names as well.
 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.136
Now, since the nineteenth
century was an era of acute

00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:20.196
social tensions,
it was, as you all know,

00:05:20.196 --> 00:05:22.589
marked by a series of
revolutions,

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.173
and is often dubbed the
rebellious century for that

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:26.819
reason.
 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.439
You know about the revolutions
of 1830,

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.850
the revolutionary wave of 1848
to 1849,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.584
across the continent,
when there were something like

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:40.879
fifty revolutions within a
two-year period.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.699
Italian independence,
the Paris Commune.

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.050
One could go on.
 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.285
But due to the fact that
cholera frequently accompanied

00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:53.069
those events,
and indisputably did heighten

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.766
social and political tensions,
it used to be common to

00:05:57.766 --> 00:06:02.661
speculate about whether the
passage of cholera across Europe

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:07.805
was itself a contributory factor
in the coming of revolutionary

00:06:07.805 --> 00:06:09.050
outbursts.
 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.899
By now it's pretty clear that
the causal chain actually worked

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:15.730
the other way around.
 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.279
In other words,
the outbreak of revolution,

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.759
war and social order created
conditions for cholera to

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:24.689
thrive.
 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.425
Cholera moved,
I would argue,

00:06:27.425 --> 00:06:32.800
in the wake of revolution,
rather than triggering it.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.483
So, cholera,
if it didn't cause the

00:06:35.483 --> 00:06:39.430
revolutions that marked the
nineteenth century--

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.552
there has been in recent
literature a swing of the

00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:44.910
pendulum in a different
direction,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.639
with a view sometimes expressed
that cholera was dramatic,

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.166
yes, but not a lasting
influence on the history of the

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:55.940
West after all.
 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.310
Some would say that it was
dramatic,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.778
that it led to all sorts of
short-term sound and fury,

00:07:02.778 --> 00:07:05.709
but in the long-term,
that argument runs,

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:10.098
its legacy was small,
and clearly nowhere near the

00:07:10.098 --> 00:07:14.040
order of magnitude of plague and
smallpox.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.910
Well, we'll be deciding among
those conflicting views.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.459
But before we can assess them
properly,

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:26.300
we should look in our usual way
at the etiology of cholera,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.230
at its epidemiology,
its symptoms and its course in

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.220
European and North American
history.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.790
Then we'll be in a better
position to judge its impact.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:43.221
There were seven pandemics of
Asiatic cholera,

00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:49.620
the first in 1817 to '23,
which was an Asian event.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.072
The second pandemic was in the
1830s and affected Asia,

00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:58.690
but also Europe for the first
time, and North America.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:04.627
The third pandemic of 1846 to
'62, afflicting Asia,

00:08:04.627 --> 00:08:08.189
Europe, again North America.
 

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:12.310
The fourth pandemic,
from '65 to '75,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.829
again it was global.
 

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:18.310
The fifth pandemic,
from 1881 to '96,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.889
mainly a matter of Asia and
Europe.

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:28.247
The sixth pandemic of 1899 to
'23, again primarily an Asian

00:08:28.247 --> 00:08:30.550
and European event.
 

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.168
And then the seventh pandemic,
from 1960 onward,

00:08:35.168 --> 00:08:40.178
that went through Asia,
South America and Africa.

00:08:40.178 --> 00:08:43.830
The last pandemic,
however, has been milder and

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.859
less virulent,
with a new biotype,

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:51.542
the El Tor, which is less
dramatic and less fatal than

00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:55.173
classic cholera,
which is our subject,

00:08:55.173 --> 00:09:00.144
and which was the form of
cholera from the first pandemic

00:09:00.144 --> 00:09:02.009
through the sixth.
 

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:05.586
The endemic home of cholera,
as I've said,

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:09.163
was the Indian subcontinent,
in the delta,

00:09:09.163 --> 00:09:12.480
the Ganges and Brahmaputra
Rivers.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.971
And it was confined there until
a number of developments enabled

00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.278
it to spread.
 

00:09:19.278 --> 00:09:23.706
The bacterium that causes
cholera is extremely delicate

00:09:23.706 --> 00:09:26.250
and doesn't travel so easily.
 

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.630
So, it required a number of
factors that enabled the disease

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.269
to move beyond its original area
of endemicity.

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:36.480
What were some of those?
 

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.940
One was colonialism itself,
which meant large-scale troop

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:50.322
movements and increasing contact
between the subcontinent and the

00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:52.399
outside world.
 

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:58.030
The increase in trade did the
same thing in terms of

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.350
increasing contact.
 

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.172
Then there was the transport
revolution, which was very

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:03.798
important.
 

00:10:03.798 --> 00:10:07.611
Because, as I said,
cholera doesn't travel so well

00:10:07.611 --> 00:10:12.149
over extended periods of time,
and it was the railroad,

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:15.076
the steamship and,
later in the century,

00:10:15.076 --> 00:10:18.451
the Suez Canal,
that radically reduced the

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:23.203
traveling time from the
subcontinent to other parts of

00:10:23.203 --> 00:10:24.370
the world.
 

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:29.107
Another major factor was
religious pilgrimages and fairs

00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:32.210
in the Indian subcontinent
itself.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.558
And very most especially,
from the European perspective,

00:10:37.558 --> 00:10:43.006
a very important factor was the
Hajj, the voyage of pious

00:10:43.006 --> 00:10:45.048
Muslims to Mecca.
 

00:10:45.048 --> 00:10:49.695
Now, that cholera afflicted
Europe and North America in the

00:10:49.695 --> 00:10:54.259
nineteenth century wasn't
therefore a matter of chance.

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:59.552
Epidemic diseases exploit
features of societies that are

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:04.460
social, political and economic
and environmental.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.488
Cholera is spread,
as we'll see,

00:11:07.488 --> 00:11:11.200
exclusively by the oral fecal
route;

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:19.830
that is, it's ingested by food
and water contaminated by feces.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.947
And it requires,
therefore--it clearly is among

00:11:23.947 --> 00:11:27.126
the diseases,
certainly that we've examined

00:11:27.126 --> 00:11:29.647
so far,
cholera is clearly different

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:34.308
from plague and smallpox in that
it's much more a social disease;

00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:38.759
that is to say,
a disease that has a clear

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:44.946
predilection for poverty and for
pathologies of social and

00:11:44.946 --> 00:11:46.899
economic life.
 

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:53.413
Cholera thrived on chaotic,
rapid, unplanned urbanization,

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:57.871
with its overcrowding and
teeming slums,

00:11:57.871 --> 00:12:02.330
with inadequate and insecure
water.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.080
This continues to be true with
cholera in our own day.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:14.105
It thrives on substandard
housing, on inadequate and

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:17.000
inappropriate diet.
 

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.600
It has a predilection for port
cities, which are usually the

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.940
first places to be affected.
 

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.470
This reminds us perhaps of
plague a little bit.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.051
Places in Europe,
like Marseilles,

00:12:30.051 --> 00:12:33.884
Hamburg, Valencia,
Naples were among the first and

00:12:33.884 --> 00:12:36.700
most frequently to be afflicted.
 

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:42.563
Cholera thrives also on filth
and the absence of sewage

00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:43.649
systems.
 

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:49.570
Cholera is, among many things,
a disease of poverty.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.017
Cholera also had a pronounced
predilection for the poor,

00:12:54.017 --> 00:12:55.230
as I've said.
 

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.798
And in that way it exacerbated
social tensions.

00:12:59.798 --> 00:13:03.173
Cholera, as I said,
was associated with

00:13:03.173 --> 00:13:08.500
revolutions, though it followed
rather than provoked them.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.320
You can see that in the revolt
in Poland in 1830,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.873
the revolutions of 1848 to '49,
when cholera is often part of

00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:22.778
the movement of troops to
repress the revolutions,

00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:25.830
rather than being a factor in
their cause.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:31.486
It was conditioned by the 1860s
war between Austria and Prussia

00:13:31.486 --> 00:13:32.399
as well.
 

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:35.029
Well, what about the disease
itself?

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:39.960
The pathogen is this,
the Vibrio cholerae,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.378
which was discovered by Robert
Koch in 1883,

00:13:44.378 --> 00:13:49.720
helping to establish the germ
theory of disease.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.625
Now, this--we'll note the
flagellum or tail of the

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:57.030
Vibrio,
that plays an important role in

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.410
the human gut,
and we'll talk about that in a

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.028
moment.
 

00:14:01.028 --> 00:14:05.755
Its transmission you know
pretty well because of your

00:14:05.755 --> 00:14:09.210
reading for this week of John
Snow,

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.086
On the Mode of Communication
of Cholera. You know that

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:18.720
this is one of the foundational
texts of epidemiology,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.775
where he did a brilliant
epidemiological job of detective

00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:28.110
work by finding the famous Broad
Street pump--

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.697
that the people who drank the
water from that particular pump

00:14:32.697 --> 00:14:37.284
were the ones who fell ill and
took the disease back to their

00:14:37.284 --> 00:14:38.048
homes.
 

00:14:38.048 --> 00:14:44.027
Snow did a good job of
establishing that cholera then

00:14:44.027 --> 00:14:48.048
was ingested in water,
primarily;

00:14:48.048 --> 00:14:51.147
although it was also
demonstrated later that

00:14:51.147 --> 00:14:55.614
shellfish and vegetables--that
is food--contaminated with fecal

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:57.918
matter can also play a role.
 

00:14:57.918 --> 00:15:04.936
This was--that's John Snow--and
this is the famous Broad Street

00:15:04.936 --> 00:15:12.177
pump that made such an important
moment in the history of medical

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:15.460
science and epidemiology.
 

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.158
Though it's important to
remember that--

00:15:18.158 --> 00:15:21.611
it may seem odd to you as you
read this book and look at all

00:15:21.611 --> 00:15:24.802
of Snow's evidence--
to remember that in fact it

00:15:24.802 --> 00:15:28.750
failed to convince the medical
profession at the time,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.870
by and large.
 

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.696
There was a big debate about
whether cholera was contagious

00:15:33.696 --> 00:15:34.288
or not.
 

00:15:34.288 --> 00:15:37.982
We'll be coming back to that
debate and the reasons for and

00:15:37.982 --> 00:15:38.620
against.
 

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.652
But one of the things was that
John Snow was unable to

00:15:42.652 --> 00:15:45.240
demonstrate an actual mechanism.
 

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.059
There was something in the
water, but he wasn't able to

00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:52.808
establish what it was,
and therefore he didn't provide

00:15:52.808 --> 00:15:54.720
a convincing mechanism.
 

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.542
And for people who thought that
probably it was some chemical

00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:01.121
factor,
if it was anything--that Snow's

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:04.630
biggest chance of making an
argument was that it would be

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.009
something chemical.
 

00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:08.798
Well, if so--and remember this
was London--

00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:12.980
if there was some sort of
chemical in the River Thames,

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.899
surely it would be infinitely
diluted,

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:20.149
and so how would it be possible
that this chemical substance,

00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:23.830
if that's what it was,
was spreading the disease?

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.907
So, there was a big debate
about whether Snow was actually

00:16:27.907 --> 00:16:28.480
right.
 

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.999
It was proved later in the
century conclusively that he

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:32.389
was.
 

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:36.849
But it's important to realize
that for a long time his writing

00:16:36.849 --> 00:16:40.722
was very far from convincing the
international medical

00:16:40.722 --> 00:16:41.820
profession.
 

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:47.070
That didn't happen until the
1880s and 1890s.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.741
Well, what were some of the
factors in the transmission of

00:16:50.741 --> 00:16:52.158
cholera in the West?
 

00:16:52.158 --> 00:16:55.620
We've talked about trade and
the transport revolution.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.080
We've talked about pilgrimages.
 

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.842
We've talked about the
strategic role of seaports,

00:17:02.842 --> 00:17:06.068
where once again,
as in the case of plague,

00:17:06.068 --> 00:17:07.990
it would be imported.
 

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:14.160
The bacterium would gain access
to the municipal water supply,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.868
and there would also be the
danger of swimming,

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:22.470
or of eating shellfish that fed
on sewage,

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.450
especially if the custom was to
eat it raw.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:31.306
The disease would then spread
along inland transportation

00:17:31.306 --> 00:17:32.259
networks.
 

00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:37.407
We've said too that cholera was
a disease of urbanization,

00:17:37.407 --> 00:17:40.931
and of a defective urban
infrastructure,

00:17:40.931 --> 00:17:43.368
without sewage systems.
 

00:17:43.368 --> 00:17:45.940
And remember,
in the nineteenth century,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.809
waste in European cities was
predominantly thrown into the

00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:54.684
streets,
where there would be a seepage

00:17:54.684 --> 00:18:00.077
downward into tank wells;
that people would then drink

00:18:00.077 --> 00:18:03.740
the water and its bacterial
bounty.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.913
Remember, too,
that that many of the cities of

00:18:06.913 --> 00:18:09.191
Europe--
Naples, that you're reading

00:18:09.191 --> 00:18:12.740
about, but Paris too,
and many others--were

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:18.385
surrounded by vegetable gardens,
and the vegetables would be

00:18:18.385 --> 00:18:22.519
brought into the city and
consumed by the population.

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.858
But in the growing of the
vegetables,

00:18:25.858 --> 00:18:30.210
use was made of urban sewage,
which was collected and

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.980
transported to the vegetable
gardens outside the city,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.548
and then the sewage was used as
fertilizer--

00:18:38.548 --> 00:18:42.279
it was good not to waste
anything--and the plants then

00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:46.080
grew in human sewage,
and then the vegetables were

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.740
brought back to town.
 

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.097
So, we have a wonderful way for
the bacterium to make an

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:57.250
excellent roundtrip between the
hinterland and the city itself.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.473
This was the practice of sewage
farming, which was extensive

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.048
throughout the West.
 

00:19:03.048 --> 00:19:07.788
And there was a good trick that
market farmers knew very well,

00:19:07.788 --> 00:19:10.847
market gardeners,
which was that if you had an

00:19:10.847 --> 00:19:13.708
open sewer--
and there were many--if you

00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:17.410
dipped your head of lettuce,
on the way to market,

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.657
into the sewer,
then the ammonia from human

00:19:20.657 --> 00:19:23.940
urine would make the vegetables
look fresh,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.358
for sale in the market.
 

00:19:25.358 --> 00:19:29.068
So that was a good little trick
that you might want to remember.

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:33.362
In any case,
overcrowding was also another

00:19:33.362 --> 00:19:36.190
important factor in this.
 

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.890
And I just want you to remember
housing conditions.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.553
These are the fondachi
in Naples that you've been

00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:45.910
reading about.
 

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.577
And you can see that this is a
place, if you use your

00:19:49.577 --> 00:19:54.019
imagination, that's a wonderful
place for a cholera epidemic.

00:19:54.019 --> 00:20:01.930
Not only the fact of lack of
sewage and wells,

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.490
but the fact that it's really
dark,

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.548
and it's overcrowded,
and people, lots of people,

00:20:08.548 --> 00:20:12.690
live in a single room,
and that single room is used as

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.578
the sickroom,
the sleeping room.

00:20:15.578 --> 00:20:20.105
It's a place also where food
supplies are stored,

00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:24.818
and with little opportunity to
have clean hands.

00:20:24.818 --> 00:20:31.625
And remember that the Vibrio
cholerae is spread through

00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:33.298
fecal matter.
 

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:37.000
But the point is that in these
conditions,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.308
and in the dark,
it's very difficult to see,

00:20:40.308 --> 00:20:45.112
and therefore it's difficult to
know when contamination was

00:20:45.112 --> 00:20:47.098
actually taking place.
 

00:20:47.098 --> 00:20:51.526
Or, moving from Naples--these
are streets in Nottingham,

00:20:51.526 --> 00:20:55.872
in England, where cholera also
caused a couple of major

00:20:55.872 --> 00:20:58.690
epidemics, for similar reasons.
 

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.480
And the waste matter was simply
hurled into streets like this.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.190
And in the center of the street
would be the gutter,

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.098
which would carry human waste
as well.

00:21:09.098 --> 00:21:15.442
Another source of contamination
is flies, which carry the

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:18.838
cholera bacterium with them.
 

00:21:18.838 --> 00:21:23.269
The clothing of victims--that
is, the bed linen,

00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:27.912
the mattresses and so
forth--were also sources of

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:31.502
infection,
and laundresses were people who

00:21:31.502 --> 00:21:34.588
were particularly likely to fall
victim.

00:21:34.588 --> 00:21:38.550
And remember that cholera
spread also by asymptomatic

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.390
carriers.
 

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.910
It was possible to be
spreading- shedding the

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:48.019
bacterium without exhibiting
symptoms.

00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:51.779
Well, how was the--what were
the symptoms of cholera?

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:55.068
And that I'm going to argue,
the symptoms,

00:21:55.068 --> 00:21:58.351
the symptomatology,
is an important factor in the

00:21:58.351 --> 00:22:01.358
social response to this dreadful
disease,

00:22:01.358 --> 00:22:05.607
and it's captured by such terms
as "blue cholera,"

00:22:05.607 --> 00:22:09.930
"cholera asphyxia,"
and "the monster."

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:15.234
This is a picture of a
representation of a cholera

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:20.540
victim in the agony of the
disease, and this is an

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:25.630
imaginative idea of how
overwhelming it is.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:32.173
This is a cholera patient about
to be overwhelmed by the disease

00:22:32.173 --> 00:22:33.108
itself.
 

00:22:33.108 --> 00:22:40.118
Well, the bodily defenses
against cholera are numerous.

00:22:40.118 --> 00:22:45.858
The saliva in the mouth was an
important defense.

00:22:45.858 --> 00:22:51.601
The digestive juices of the
stomach are acidic and tend to

00:22:51.601 --> 00:22:55.630
kill the bacterium when it's
ingested.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:01.625
So, it's quite possible to
ingest cholera bacteria without

00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:05.730
falling victim to the disease
itself.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.983
But there are a number of
important variables that

00:23:09.983 --> 00:23:12.588
condition what happens next.
 

00:23:12.588 --> 00:23:18.601
One would be how great-
extensive the infective dose

00:23:18.601 --> 00:23:27.528
actually was;
how much did you swallow?

00:23:27.528 --> 00:23:32.949
The diet that you're living on
is important because such foods

00:23:32.949 --> 00:23:35.349
that the poor,
in particular,

00:23:35.349 --> 00:23:39.282
lived on in European cities,
as ripe and overripe fruit and

00:23:39.282 --> 00:23:41.260
vegetables--
in other words,

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.301
the poor were likely to buy
goods that were beginning to

00:23:45.301 --> 00:23:49.529
degenerate and deteriorate,
because they'd be marked down

00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:52.554
in price,
and those would be the goods

00:23:52.554 --> 00:23:54.920
that the poor would live on.
 

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.240
And this meant that they often
suffered from dire real

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.114
illnesses,
and those reduced the digestive

00:24:03.114 --> 00:24:05.951
time,
and therefore deprived the

00:24:05.951 --> 00:24:10.525
stomach of its defensive
capacity to protect you by the

00:24:10.525 --> 00:24:13.490
acidity of the digestive juices.
 

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.818
And the consumption of raw
fruit, for example,

00:24:16.818 --> 00:24:20.519
would be especially common in
the summer months.

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:24.561
Another factor would be the
general health of the person who

00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:26.548
was exposed to the disease.
 

00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:31.164
Let's suppose that you've eaten
a very large infective dose,

00:24:31.164 --> 00:24:34.840
and it passes successfully
through your stomach,

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.109
into the small intestine.
 

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:39.660
What happens next?
 

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.230
Well, there's an incubation
period.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.338
It can be as short as a few
hours.

00:24:45.338 --> 00:24:51.017
And this too was important in
the social history of cholera,

00:24:51.017 --> 00:24:54.288
and could last up to three
days.

00:24:54.288 --> 00:24:58.588
The site of infection is the
small intestine.

00:24:58.588 --> 00:25:03.152
There the flagellum,
at the tail of the bacterium,

00:25:03.152 --> 00:25:07.063
that we've seen,
propels the Vibrio,

00:25:07.063 --> 00:25:11.720
and it attaches itself to the
intestinal wall.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:18.931
Ironically, there the immune
system of the body is usually

00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:23.358
capable of killing the
bacterium.

00:25:23.358 --> 00:25:28.698
But when it--as the bacterium
dies, it releases a very

00:25:28.698 --> 00:25:31.720
powerful toxin,
an enterotoxin,

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.160
that's one of the most powerful
poisons in nature.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.982
And its effect on the
intestinal wall is to cause it

00:25:41.982 --> 00:25:46.501
to work in reverse;
that is, to drain fluid from

00:25:46.501 --> 00:25:52.108
the bloodstream into the bowel,
and from there it's expelled.

00:25:52.108 --> 00:25:56.670
So, the mechanism by which
cholera kills first of all,

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:01.420
and predominantly,
is a sort of hemorrhaging to

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.365
death,
in which the blood serum loses

00:26:05.365 --> 00:26:09.896
its fluidly massively--
liters can be expelled in a

00:26:09.896 --> 00:26:13.595
matter of a few hours--
and the patient hemorrhages to

00:26:13.595 --> 00:26:16.930
death,
in effect, losing its blood

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:22.948
plasma and excreting what are
called the famous rice-water

00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:27.217
stools,
and the patient goes into

00:26:27.217 --> 00:26:29.578
hypovolemic shock.
 

00:26:29.578 --> 00:26:34.604
Nineteenth-century physicians
said--this is no longer a

00:26:34.604 --> 00:26:40.000
fashionable term today--but they
described cholera as going

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.700
through two major stages.
 

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:47.807
The first was called the algid
stage, which was the time of

00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:51.948
high drama and terror,
which had a sudden onset,

00:26:51.948 --> 00:26:53.710
without warning.
 

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.565
This was part of the social
tensions that were generated by

00:26:57.565 --> 00:26:58.230
cholera.
 

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:02.234
In other words,
you could be seized suddenly

00:27:02.234 --> 00:27:07.078
with this dreadful disease out
in a public place--

00:27:07.078 --> 00:27:10.490
on a tram, in a marketplace,
in the streets itself--

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.230
where you would fall down and
start writhing,

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:18.019
vomiting and excreting
rice-water stools.

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:22.868
This was part of the high drama
of the disease.

00:27:22.868 --> 00:27:27.486
And the algid state would last,
if you survived,

00:27:27.486 --> 00:27:31.710
normally from eight to
twenty-four hours.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:36.426
As a patient,
you would lose--progressively

00:27:36.426 --> 00:27:42.828
your pulse would become fainter,
or even almost absent.

00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:48.858
The body would turn cold and
would have a livid appearance.

00:27:48.858 --> 00:27:51.945
It looked, within a few
hours--and this was another of

00:27:51.945 --> 00:27:54.450
the frightening aspects of this
disease--

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.613
within a few hours,
someone who had been healthy

00:27:57.613 --> 00:28:00.597
that morning,
by the afternoon looked

00:28:00.597 --> 00:28:04.342
cadaverized,
like a person who had been

00:28:04.342 --> 00:28:09.009
wasting away from a long-term
wasting illness.

00:28:09.009 --> 00:28:11.798
The breath would turn cold.
 

00:28:11.798 --> 00:28:15.068
The hands would look like
dishwater hands.

00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:18.998
And very distressing,
there would be a very severe

00:28:18.998 --> 00:28:22.010
cramping;
terrible cramps,

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:27.740
terrible abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.532
And the blood
itself--physicians who were

00:28:30.532 --> 00:28:34.374
trying to treat patients by
bloodletting rapidly noticed

00:28:34.374 --> 00:28:39.891
that the blood itself,
deprived of its liquid content,

00:28:39.891 --> 00:28:46.920
was transformed into a black
tar that refused to circulate.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.912
This could lead to heart
failure, to a terrible thirst

00:28:51.912 --> 00:28:54.548
that the patient suffered.
 

00:28:54.548 --> 00:28:58.683
And because the blood is no
longer providing adequate

00:28:58.683 --> 00:29:02.386
oxygen,
the patient suffers--has the

00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:11.061
sense of asphyxiating,
a terrible effort to gasping

00:29:11.061 --> 00:29:13.048
for air.
 

00:29:13.048 --> 00:29:16.558
Those are a couple of pictures
of contemporary--

00:29:16.558 --> 00:29:22.118
I said cholera is still with
us, and so I just wanted to show

00:29:22.118 --> 00:29:29.520
you a picture of a patient,
or another, a child patient

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.720
today.
 

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.843
In any case,
if the patient survived the

00:29:34.843 --> 00:29:38.066
algid stage,
there was then the second

00:29:38.066 --> 00:29:41.994
stage, that nineteenth-century
physicians called the reaction

00:29:41.994 --> 00:29:45.638
stage,
that might last four or five

00:29:45.638 --> 00:29:46.279
days.
 

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:50.170
The prognosis isn't really
better, but the symptoms are.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.650
At this time the cold body
becomes warmer.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.788
There's a fever usually.
 

00:29:56.788 --> 00:30:01.980
The patient suffers terrible
headache and is often delirious.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.442
The problem is that there were
terrible complications that

00:30:06.442 --> 00:30:09.730
overtook patients in the
reaction stage.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.348
Pneumonia was a frequent
complication.

00:30:13.348 --> 00:30:18.200
So was kidney failure,
uremia, gangrene of the

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.968
extremities;
the ears, the nose,

00:30:21.968 --> 00:30:25.058
fingers, toes,
the penis.

00:30:25.058 --> 00:30:29.923
And there was a case fatality
rate then, from Asiatic cholera

00:30:29.923 --> 00:30:33.896
in the nineteenth century,
of something like fifty

00:30:33.896 --> 00:30:34.868
percent.
 

00:30:34.868 --> 00:30:39.770
Today, as we said last time,
there is an effective oral

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.674
rehydration therapy,
and the death rate with

00:30:43.674 --> 00:30:47.759
treatment is less than two
percent today.

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:51.078
That's partly because of the
effectiveness of the treatment,

00:30:51.078 --> 00:30:55.359
and partly because the El Tor
biotype is less virulent than

00:30:55.359 --> 00:31:00.660
classic Vibrio cholerae,
of the first six pandemics.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.815
In any case,
then, what were the effects on

00:31:04.815 --> 00:31:10.355
a community, on a society,
of an invasion of a disease of

00:31:10.355 --> 00:31:11.740
this type?
 

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:17.509
Was this the return of the
plague, as people speculated?

00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:21.943
This disease seemed a little
bit to resemble that,

00:31:21.943 --> 00:31:27.373
in terms of the terror that it
inspired, and the social chaos

00:31:27.373 --> 00:31:30.358
it caused during an outbreak.
 

00:31:30.358 --> 00:31:34.480
Now, an outbreak--let's imagine
a nineteenth-century city.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.377
You can pick your own,
let it be London or Paris,

00:31:39.377 --> 00:31:41.420
or perhaps Naples.
 

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.640
The outbreak would tend to
begin with what the

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.423
nineteenth-century medical
community termed sporadic

00:31:50.423 --> 00:31:51.548
cholera.
 

00:31:51.548 --> 00:31:56.200
By that they meant a small
trickle of cases.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.615
These would be transmitted in a
neighborhood,

00:31:59.615 --> 00:32:01.170
a family, a house.
 

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.692
The transmission might be by
contaminated clothing or bed

00:32:05.692 --> 00:32:07.866
linen,
contaminated food,

00:32:07.866 --> 00:32:12.770
hand to mouth transmission from
tending a patient and then not

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.460
washing the hands.
 

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:20.338
Let me give you an example from
Venice in 1885.

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:23.994
There was a particularly
persistent outbreak,

00:32:23.994 --> 00:32:27.898
in a single street,
before the disease became an

00:32:27.898 --> 00:32:30.890
epidemic in the city as a whole.
 

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.722
And what happened was that this
was traced to a single

00:32:35.722 --> 00:32:39.622
restaurant,
and the proprietor was a lovely

00:32:39.622 --> 00:32:44.866
lady who happened to be tending
to her own infant child who was

00:32:44.866 --> 00:32:48.588
sick with cholera in an upstairs
bedroom.

00:32:48.588 --> 00:32:52.942
She would go upstairs and tend
to him, and then she would go

00:32:52.942 --> 00:32:56.041
back downstairs,
without washing her hands,

00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:58.920
and prepare food for her
clientele.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:04.218
And that was how the disease
was spread in a single street,

00:33:04.218 --> 00:33:05.680
for some time.
 

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.078
Now, in fortunate instances,
the disease,

00:33:10.078 --> 00:33:12.978
this outbreak,
this so-called sporadic

00:33:12.978 --> 00:33:15.637
cholera,
would just fade away,

00:33:15.637 --> 00:33:20.519
and the community would escape
a large-scale misfortune.

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:24.144
But if the Vibrio gained
access to the city's water

00:33:24.144 --> 00:33:27.299
supply,
then the disease would flare up

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:30.819
with epidemic force,
and this would be what the

00:33:30.819 --> 00:33:34.280
nineteenth century health
authorities called epidemic

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.180
cholera,
instead of sporadic.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.079
And if you made a graph of
cases and deaths,

00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:46.068
there'd be a sudden spike in
mortality and morbidity.

00:33:46.068 --> 00:33:50.147
Well, what would be the likely
magnitude of the disaster that

00:33:50.147 --> 00:33:53.682
would follow if,
let us say, a major European

00:33:53.682 --> 00:33:57.930
city had its water supply
contaminated with cholera?

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:03.172
The order of magnitude would be
different from that of the

00:34:03.172 --> 00:34:04.000
plague.
 

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.702
Cholera was never responsible
for the kind of demographic

00:34:08.702 --> 00:34:12.815
catastrophe that Europe
experienced with the Black

00:34:12.815 --> 00:34:17.148
Death,
or later invasions of bubonic

00:34:17.148 --> 00:34:18.090
plague.
 

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.711
In the nineteenth century,
Europe experienced a major

00:34:22.711 --> 00:34:26.889
population growth,
and cholera had little impact

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.380
on the population surge.
 

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:34.324
Let's take again the example of
Naples, a city famous for its

00:34:34.324 --> 00:34:37.619
overcrowding,
its filth and its recurring

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:40.340
epidemics of Asiatic cholera.
 

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:45.887
Let's compare it also with an
earlier experience of bubonic

00:34:45.887 --> 00:34:46.750
plague.
 

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:53.340
Naples experienced a terrible
epidemic of plague in 1656.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:58.284
At that time the city had about
a population numbering perhaps

00:34:58.284 --> 00:35:00.230
half-a-million people.
 

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:05.141
The state wasn't very good at
knowing exactly how many people

00:35:05.141 --> 00:35:08.402
lived in the city,
and its statistics for

00:35:08.402 --> 00:35:12.119
mortality are also to be taken
with a grain of salt.

00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:16.898
But there were estimates that
as many as 300,000 people died

00:35:16.898 --> 00:35:20.139
of bubonic plague in that single
year.

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:25.260
Let's compare that with cholera
in 1837.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:30.423
I choose 1837 because that was
the worst epidemic of cholera

00:35:30.423 --> 00:35:32.699
that Naples experienced.
 

00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:37.956
The population at that time was
still round about half-a-million

00:35:37.956 --> 00:35:42.045
people, but in this worst year
of Asiatic cholera,

00:35:42.045 --> 00:35:44.800
about 12,000 people perished.
 

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.869
Now, I don't--after our
experience of bubonic plague--I

00:35:50.869 --> 00:35:56.489
don't want that to be a basis
for insensitivity.

00:35:56.489 --> 00:36:01.880
This epidemic in which 12,000
people died is a major disaster,

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.170
but it didn't have the same
long-term cultural,

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:11.554
philosophical and religious
impact that the plague earlier

00:36:11.554 --> 00:36:14.750
had,
and it didn't seem to convince

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:19.170
people that the end of the world
had possibly arrived.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.139
So, cholera,
compared with plague,

00:36:22.139 --> 00:36:23.849
is less virulent.
 

00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:27.920
The bodily defenses of healthy
adults are often effective.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.195
And it doesn't have those
efficient vectors,

00:36:31.195 --> 00:36:34.320
rats and fleas,
that enabled the plague to

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.920
reach every home.
 

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.773
Also, unlike the plague,
cholera didn't endure for five

00:36:40.773 --> 00:36:44.369
centuries, returning every
generation.

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:48.670
Cholera first invaded Europe in
the 1830s,

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:53.391
and by the 1860s the history of
cholera in the industrially

00:36:53.391 --> 00:36:57.869
advanced nations of Northern
Europe was largely over.

00:36:57.869 --> 00:37:04.483
And for Western Europe as a
whole, the 1890s mostly marked

00:37:04.483 --> 00:37:08.429
the end, and 1911 certainly did.
 

00:37:08.429 --> 00:37:13.112
So, cholera had only six
pandemic waves that ever invaded

00:37:13.112 --> 00:37:15.664
Europe,
and each wave was less

00:37:15.664 --> 00:37:20.262
widespread and claimed fewer
victims than the ones preceding

00:37:20.262 --> 00:37:20.730
it.
 

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:25.447
That's a very different history
than the history of bubonic

00:37:25.447 --> 00:37:26.179
plague.
 

00:37:26.179 --> 00:37:29.260
How long would an epidemic last?
 

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.570
It would normally last,
in a great European city,

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:38.420
for the length of the warm
summer and perhaps the early

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.230
fall.
 

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:44.592
It would then recede and fade
away with the onset of cool

00:37:44.592 --> 00:37:45.550
weather.
 

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.940
Now, why would it fade away?
 

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.516
Well, Robert Koch,
who discovered the Vibrio

00:37:51.516 --> 00:37:55.057
cholerae,
said himself that this was

00:37:55.057 --> 00:37:58.652
something,
a question to which he couldn't

00:37:58.652 --> 00:38:00.940
give a satisfactory answer.
 

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.139
He said that this was one of
the great cholera mysteries,

00:38:05.139 --> 00:38:06.489
as he called it.
 

00:38:06.489 --> 00:38:10.331
But we can speculate with
regard to certain factors that

00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:11.518
seem important.
 

00:38:11.518 --> 00:38:14.510
One would be a change in
weather.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:22.099
Cold dry weather is hard on the
delicate Vibrio cholerae.

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:26.197
Like plague,
cholera too in Europe had a

00:38:26.197 --> 00:38:29.349
very pronounced seasonality.
 

00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:33.280
It struck during the warm
months.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.931
Another factor is that after
the disease had struck those

00:38:36.931 --> 00:38:40.909
people who were most at risk
because of their occupations,

00:38:40.909 --> 00:38:44.447
and their personal
susceptibility and their living

00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:48.101
conditions,
the epidemic was then like a

00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:50.840
fire that ran short of fuel.
 

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.945
It ran short of people who were
most susceptible and at high

00:38:56.945 --> 00:38:57.670
risk.
 

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.849
And then communities,
also--and this was probably

00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:03.280
important--
adopted measures of

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.588
self-defense,
and those too helped to cut

00:39:06.588 --> 00:39:10.789
short the outbreak,
especially later in the century

00:39:10.789 --> 00:39:13.760
when the disease was better
understood.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:20.485
It's now known too that the
cholera can survive in a spore

00:39:20.485 --> 00:39:24.195
form,
in algae blooms offshore of the

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:28.577
great port cities,
and so there is a possibility

00:39:28.577 --> 00:39:33.144
too that the disease was
re-imported from the waters

00:39:33.144 --> 00:39:34.219
offshore.
 

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:38.333
In any case,
what were the reactions to

00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:41.039
cholera in a community?
 

00:39:41.039 --> 00:39:46.952
Here there was an analogy,
possibly with plague,

00:39:46.952 --> 00:39:52.989
in that cholera too generated
terror and fear.

00:39:52.989 --> 00:39:58.579
This is partly because of the
agonizing nature of the symptoms

00:39:58.579 --> 00:40:00.230
of this disease.
 

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:05.315
And the fact was that the
symptoms of cholera suggested

00:40:05.315 --> 00:40:10.965
were analogous to something that
people were already familiar

00:40:10.965 --> 00:40:13.980
with, and that is poisoning.
 

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:20.257
The symptoms of cholera had
symptoms that resembled someone

00:40:20.257 --> 00:40:26.210
who had taken strychnine,
for example--rat poisoning.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:31.389
And, so, people were suspicious
that perhaps this might be a

00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:34.639
crime, rather than a natural
event.

00:40:34.639 --> 00:40:40.974
Let me show you some images
that convey the sense of terror

00:40:40.974 --> 00:40:44.360
that people felt at the time.
 

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:49.788
This is King Cholera;
we've said that's one of the

00:40:49.788 --> 00:40:52.849
terms that it was associated
with.

00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:56.599
And you can see King Cholera
astride the globe.

00:40:56.599 --> 00:41:01.809
This is clearly a sense of its
pandemicity.

00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:06.556
Or we can look at--this is New
York City, with cholera

00:41:06.556 --> 00:41:07.809
approaching.
 

00:41:07.809 --> 00:41:12.880
And again you can see the kind
of terror that was associated

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.739
with it.
 

00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:19.085
Or let's look as well--and you
can see cholera striding over

00:41:19.085 --> 00:41:21.349
the defensive bulwarks.
 

00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:25.635
Those are the kinds of--this is
clearly one of the early

00:41:25.635 --> 00:41:28.418
pandemics,
and what you can see is the

00:41:28.418 --> 00:41:32.219
attempt to control this disease
with the plague measures.

00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:35.148
You can see the troops,
sanitary cordons and all the

00:41:35.148 --> 00:41:37.904
rest, trying to keep out
"the monster,"

00:41:37.904 --> 00:41:39.110
as it was called.
 

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:43.614
But those in fact turned out,
for reasons we'll be coming to,

00:41:43.614 --> 00:41:47.367
to be entirely ineffective in
dealing with cholera,

00:41:47.367 --> 00:41:49.018
unlike the plague.
 

00:41:49.018 --> 00:41:53.389
Or we can see--and here the
analogy in people's minds that

00:41:53.389 --> 00:41:57.300
this might be the return of the
plague is clear,

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.489
because here we can see the
Grim Reaper,

00:42:00.489 --> 00:42:03.605
with his scythe,
mowing down the whole

00:42:03.605 --> 00:42:04.699
population.
 

00:42:04.699 --> 00:42:08.735
Or here we can see,
once again in the nineteenth

00:42:08.735 --> 00:42:10.969
century, a revival here.
 

00:42:10.969 --> 00:42:18.364
This is the danse
macabre, with death calling

00:42:18.364 --> 00:42:19.670
people.
 

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.420
And there you can see again the
Danse Macabre.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:30.070
Here's the invitation of death
to come dance.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:34.793
So, those are sorts of graphic
illustrations of the kind of

00:42:34.793 --> 00:42:37.400
fear that this disease caused.
 

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.590
Well it also caused
scapegoating.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:49.514
Imagine, for example--let's go
back to the first arrival of

00:42:49.514 --> 00:42:52.260
cholera in the 1830s.
 

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.170
In 1830, let's think of the
Russian Empire.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.253
When cholera struck St.
 

00:42:58.253 --> 00:43:02.690
Petersburg in 1830,
at that time Russia was at war

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.342
with Poland,
and Russians believed at the

00:43:06.342 --> 00:43:11.139
time that the disease was an act
of terror by Polish agents.

00:43:11.139 --> 00:43:15.050
So cholera gave rise to
manhunts or witch-hunts,

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.880
find--the search for
scapegoats.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.793
Foreigners, gypsies,
someone newly arriving in town

00:43:21.793 --> 00:43:26.019
could be suspicious and
therefore could be set upon and

00:43:26.019 --> 00:43:28.289
attacked, as a scapegoat.
 

00:43:28.289 --> 00:43:31.130
Cholera also led,
because of its fear,

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.945
to mass flight,
and some cities experienced

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:39.469
almost Biblical exoduses,
with tens-of-thousands of

00:43:39.469 --> 00:43:43.429
people evacuating cities in fear
for their lives.

00:43:43.429 --> 00:43:47.596
And just as in Defoe's account,
it was the wealthier classes

00:43:47.596 --> 00:43:51.833
who could afford the journey and
had somewhere to go who went

00:43:51.833 --> 00:43:52.539
first.
 

00:43:52.539 --> 00:43:57.018
A consequence would be that the
administration and public

00:43:57.018 --> 00:44:00.699
services, in the city that was
being evacuated,

00:44:00.699 --> 00:44:02.139
were in chaos.
 

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:03.860
Businesses shut down.
 

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.960
There was mass unemployment.
 

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.789
There was hunger and shortages
of all kinds.

00:44:09.789 --> 00:44:15.010
There was also a new strain on
class relationships.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.181
Cholera was a class disease,
I would argue,

00:44:18.181 --> 00:44:22.262
in that it caused a sharply
unequal burden of death and

00:44:22.262 --> 00:44:23.320
suffering.
 

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.619
Unlike plague,
unlike smallpox,

00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:30.469
cholera primarily chose the
poor.

00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:33.768
Now, there are reasons,
in terms of risk factors,

00:44:33.768 --> 00:44:35.900
that explain that difference.
 

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.266
There was normally by this time
a pattern of housing

00:44:39.266 --> 00:44:41.864
segregation;
that is to say,

00:44:41.864 --> 00:44:48.449
the poor and the wealthy didn't
live next to one another,

00:44:48.449 --> 00:44:50.929
and the poor suffered from
overcrowding,

00:44:50.929 --> 00:44:53.652
filth, poor diet,
lack of light,

00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:58.920
and the wells they drank from
were not the same as those used

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.590
by the wealthy.
 

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:05.152
A good example of this
difference, and one that caused

00:45:05.152 --> 00:45:07.219
sinister speculations.
 

00:45:07.219 --> 00:45:09.980
In time of plague,
as you know,

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.579
those who tended the plague
victims--physicians and

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:19.179
priests--perished in
unimaginable proportions.

00:45:19.179 --> 00:45:22.250
During the time of cholera,
however,

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:27.630
doctors and priests moved among
the most sordid slums,

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.960
and yet mysteriously they
managed to stay healthy,

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.617
for the most part,
while those around them fell

00:45:35.617 --> 00:45:36.809
ill and died.
 

00:45:36.809 --> 00:45:39.679
There are good epidemiological
reasons for this.

00:45:39.679 --> 00:45:43.480
Doctors didn't eat and sleep in
the sickrooms,

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.000
as the poor did.
 

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.670
They had better diets.
 

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.929
They washed their hands.
 

00:45:47.929 --> 00:45:50.539
They drank different water.
 

00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:55.179
But to the urban poor,
the immunity of the wealthier

00:45:55.179 --> 00:45:58.090
classes was highly suspicious.
 

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:01.719
It suggested to some the idea
of poisoning;

00:46:01.719 --> 00:46:05.668
particularly since the poor in
the nineteenth century weren't

00:46:05.668 --> 00:46:06.590
medicalized.
 

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:09.222
That is to say,
they had little contact and

00:46:09.222 --> 00:46:11.480
experience with medical
attention.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.235
And, so, an effect,
during the cholera years,

00:46:15.235 --> 00:46:17.030
was often violence.
 

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.489
There were assaults on doctors.
 

00:46:19.489 --> 00:46:25.070
In some places crowds invaded
hospitals and lazarettos.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.500
And the suspicions weren't all
in one direction.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.090
The wealthy,
at this time in the nineteenth

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.543
century,
had a fear of those they called

00:46:33.543 --> 00:46:35.431
the "dangerous
classes,"

00:46:35.431 --> 00:46:38.809
and they were thinking of the
dangerous classes as dangerous

00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:41.840
politically--
this was the rebellious

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.280
century--dangerous morally and
in religious terms.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.409
But also they now seemed to be
dangerous medically.

00:46:51.409 --> 00:46:57.182
And I think this is a factor in
some of the extreme violence

00:46:57.182 --> 00:47:00.510
that one sees in 1848,
for example,

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.250
or in the Paris Commune.
 

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:07.090
There was a strain on social
relationships.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:11.711
Well, what happened in terms of
public policy and organized

00:47:11.711 --> 00:47:12.510
effects?
 

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:17.594
The first thing that happened
was a tendency to revive the

00:47:17.594 --> 00:47:20.539
plague measures,
to contain it.

00:47:20.539 --> 00:47:24.766
Cholera put unprecedented
pressure on authorities to do

00:47:24.766 --> 00:47:28.760
something, to take some sort of
effective action.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.550
And it was then that the states
responded--

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:35.090
first off, Russia,
Austria, Prussia,

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:38.606
for example--by reviving the
plague regulations:

00:47:38.606 --> 00:47:41.449
land-based and maritime
quarantine,

00:47:41.449 --> 00:47:44.000
sanitary cordons, lazarettos.
 

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.699
One can see this in pictures.
 

00:47:45.699 --> 00:47:49.050
This is a cholera lazaretto.
 

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:54.590
Or one can see here is cholera,
the Vibrio arriving,

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:58.289
and you can see that the Board
of Health is trying to stop it,

00:47:58.289 --> 00:48:01.268
and there are sanitary cordons
and all the rest.

00:48:01.268 --> 00:48:04.960
This is a depiction of the
early outbreak.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.443
Or the attempt--this is
familiar to you from time of

00:48:08.443 --> 00:48:13.018
plague--to purify the atmosphere
by burning sulfur and with fire.

00:48:13.018 --> 00:48:16.230
These were--or there were
funeral regulations.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.989
And you can see here again the
people bring out your dead,

00:48:19.989 --> 00:48:25.159
and transporting the victims to
the cemetery for rapid,

00:48:25.159 --> 00:48:28.099
hasty burial,
the funeral regulations.

00:48:28.099 --> 00:48:31.793
The results then were to
maximize terror,

00:48:31.793 --> 00:48:34.840
economic disruption and flight.
 

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.083
The plague regulations against
cholera caused political

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:39.869
effects.
 

00:48:39.869 --> 00:48:42.722
But they were
counter-productive in terms of

00:48:42.722 --> 00:48:45.838
the disease, for they taught a
dangerous lesson,

00:48:45.838 --> 00:48:48.360
that outsiders could be
dangerous.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:52.940
And so we see then,
they don't stop the cholera.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.141
They don't stop the cholera
because they're asymptomatic

00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:58.764
carriers,
because the flight of

00:48:58.764 --> 00:49:02.782
population causes--
trying to escape the plague

00:49:02.782 --> 00:49:05.369
measures disperses the disease.
 

00:49:05.369 --> 00:49:08.755
Because cholera can flow in
rivers and waterways,

00:49:08.755 --> 00:49:12.070
past the troops who are trying
to contain it.

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:15.880
So, the plague measures weren't
effective against cholera.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.039
But I'm going to argue what
were the long-term effects.

00:49:20.039 --> 00:49:24.277
And I'm running rapidly out of
time, but just say that there

00:49:24.277 --> 00:49:27.509
were, I would argue,
not just immediate drama,

00:49:27.509 --> 00:49:29.880
there were long-term effects.
 

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:35.286
Cholera led to a big debate in
the medical profession about

00:49:35.286 --> 00:49:37.989
contagionism,
rapid or not.

00:49:37.989 --> 00:49:41.586
It led to the development of
epidemiology as a medical

00:49:41.586 --> 00:49:42.469
discipline.
 

00:49:42.469 --> 00:49:46.409
It contributed to the coming of
the germ theory of disease.

00:49:46.409 --> 00:49:50.556
In terms of public health,
it led to a new set of measures

00:49:50.556 --> 00:49:53.994
of sanitary improvement,
that we'll be talking about

00:49:53.994 --> 00:49:58.001
next time,
and even to the refitting and

00:49:58.001 --> 00:50:03.862
sanitary revolution in cities,
and even the rebuilding of

00:50:03.862 --> 00:50:08.315
places like Paris and Naples;
although cholera was not the

00:50:08.315 --> 00:50:10.760
only in fact in places like
Paris.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.739
And it caused a mortality
revolution in urban cities.

00:50:15.739 --> 00:50:17.739
We'll be talking more about
that.

00:50:17.739 --> 00:50:22.322
There are reasons then to say
that although cholera caused

00:50:22.322 --> 00:50:25.780
many of the immediate effects of
terror,

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:29.114
like the plague,
it didn't lead to the same kind

00:50:29.114 --> 00:50:31.885
of mortality,
and it didn't have the same

00:50:31.885 --> 00:50:33.340
long-term consequences.
 

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.215
But it did have a number of
long-term consequences that I

00:50:37.215 --> 00:50:39.570
think it's well to bear in mind.
 

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:43.530
This was the great dreaded
disease of the whole of the

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.099
nineteenth century.
 

00:50:45.099 --> 00:50:50.000

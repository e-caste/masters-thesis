00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.012
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:03.012 --> 00:00:06.049
Well, we've seen now how the
early Tudors managed to

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.730
reestablish the authority of the
monarchy;

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.543
how that achievement was
threatened by the succession

00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:15.770
crisis which was looming under
Henry VIII;

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.482
how that problem was met by
actions which further extended

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:26.653
royal authority over the church,
but at the same time,

00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:31.009
of course, introduced a new
form of instability into the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.984
kingdom--
potential conflict over

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:36.300
religion.
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.257
But that wasn't all that was
going on and there were other

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:44.424
sources of instability which
were set in motion at around the

00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:48.660
same time in the second quarter
of the sixteenth century.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.971
What adds additional complexity
to the whole situation is the

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:56.564
fact that there were
simultaneous shifts in some of

00:00:56.564 --> 00:01:00.731
the basic aspects of economic
and social life which in 1500

00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:04.540
would have been more or less
taken for granted.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.307
The problem then had been
political instability,

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:08.780
not social instability.
 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.110
But soon social instability was
to be on the agenda.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.837
And people knew by the 1530s
and 1540s that they lived in

00:01:18.837 --> 00:01:23.849
radically changing times in more
ways than one.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:29.197
The phenomenon of which they
were most acutely aware was

00:01:29.197 --> 00:01:33.186
rising prices,
rising prices for the basic

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:35.519
necessities of life.
 

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:38.801
Prices of goods had been fairly
stable for most of the fifteenth

00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:41.741
and early sixteenth centuries,
but around about the second

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:44.050
decade of the sixteenth century
they began rising.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.980
If you look at your handout,
section one,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.782
you'll find there an index of
prices for what's described as a

00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:59.285
basket of basic consumables,
mostly foodstuffs and other

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.799
essentials of life.
 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.519
You can see from that index,
which stands at around 100 in

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:10.406
1500, how prices rose rapidly in
the course of the sixteenth

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:11.400
century.
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.870
At first it was a modest trend.
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.848
It picked up momentum in the
1530s.

00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:20.808
Price rises were very rapid
indeed in the 1540s and '50s and

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:24.030
they continued to rise more
slowly thereafter.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.522
So, they faced a problem of
inflation, and the causes of

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:32.520
that inflation were complex.
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.779
They're much debated,
but amongst them one of the

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.836
most principal seems to have
been the fact that population

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:43.699
was also growing.
 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:49.524
The pressure was being felt of
increasing numbers of people on

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:54.490
relatively inelastic resources,
forcing up prices.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.128
If you look at section two of
your handout,

00:02:57.128 --> 00:03:00.353
you'll see the best figures
available from demographic

00:03:00.353 --> 00:03:03.395
historians of what the
population of England was at

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:06.680
different points in the earlier
sixteenth century.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.258
The best estimates we have
suggest that in the 1520s about

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.628
2.4 million.
 

00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:18.694
By the 1550s that had risen to
about 3 million,

00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:23.098
by 1570 3.3 million,
and still rising.

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:27.933
The annual rate of increase can
be calculated and it's there on

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:29.650
the right-hand side.
 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.979
In the 1540s about 0.64% per
annum, in the 1560s almost 1%

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:40.090
per annum, 1570s over 1% per
annum.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.330
These are quite rapid rates of
increase for a preindustrial

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.729
population.
 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.055
In fact, that kind of rate of
population increase was not

00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:54.616
matched again in England until
the late eighteenth century at

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:57.229
the height of the Industrial
Revolution.

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.550
So the population was rising.
 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.669
Now explaining why that was so
is far from easy,

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.613
but in all likelihood it was to
do with a fall in death rates in

00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:13.400
the early sixteenth century in a
population which had a fairly

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.029
high fertility rate and high
propensity to grow if it wasn't

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.620
culled by severe mortality.
 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.307
So death rates,
still high by our standards,

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:25.620
seem to have been falling
somewhat.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.204
If you're interested in that
kind of historical demography

00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:30.970
and would like to pursue the
issue of population dynamics,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.540
then I'd be happy to advise you
on more detailed reading.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.850
But for the moment it's enough
to just register the essential

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.110
facts: prices are rising;
population is rising;

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.139
the two are probably connected.
 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.653
What I want to focus on today
is the fallout from all of that:

00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:54.944
some of the stresses in society
which were produced by this

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:58.940
dynamic of population growth and
price inflation,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.759
how it impacted on different
groups in society.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.935
And one can start at the top
with the landlords,

00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:11.899
gentlemen, noblemen,
the monarchy.

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:14.060
In most cases the bulk of
landlords' incomes,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.814
as you know,
came from rents and they needed

00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:19.827
that income to sustain the
lifestyles which were

00:05:19.827 --> 00:05:22.839
appropriate to their station as
gentlemen,

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.540
to sustain their magnificence.
 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.290
In that situation their biggest
problem as the sixteenth century

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.129
went on was rising prices but an
inflexible income.

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.319
At worst many of them had
tenants who enjoyed fixed rents;

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.379
they'd been granted fixed rents
at some point in the past.

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.699
At best they were in a position
to periodically modify the rents

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.471
they got for their lands,
but they were still relatively

00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:53.500
inflexible.
 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.153
Land was often granted for long
periods of time on a fixed

00:05:57.153 --> 00:05:58.819
agreement for that term.
 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.250
It might be twenty,
thirty years.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.490
Land was also let according to
customs,

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.100
as you know,
which had been established in

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.858
particular areas which might
inhibit the landlords' capacity

00:06:09.858 --> 00:06:11.769
to adjust the rent levels.
 

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:18.860
That's very bad news when
prices are rising.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.430
So, how did these people cope?
 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.435
For the most part landlords
coped by gradually trying to

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:29.370
alter the terms on which they
granted their land to the

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.389
peasantry.
 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.307
They tried to let it for
shorter leases which they could

00:06:34.307 --> 00:06:37.653
renegotiate more often,
try to get the lease down to

00:06:37.653 --> 00:06:39.833
seven years,
ten years or whatever rather

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:42.680
than ninety,
which had been quite common in

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.389
the past.
 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.000
They also tried to change local
customs regarding what kind of

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.310
fine or down payment they could
get when they let land.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.569
For example,
on the estates of the Herbert

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.077
family,
which were located in Wiltshire

00:06:58.077 --> 00:07:01.937
in the southwest,
in the first half of the

00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:06.802
sixteenth century they managed
to roughly double the fines

00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:12.350
which they were getting when a
new tenant took land from them.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.918
Well, it was only possible for
landlords to squeeze their

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:20.060
tenants a little harder in that
way because land was in demand.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.163
The rise in population,
rise in population for the

00:07:23.163 --> 00:07:25.569
first time in a century and a
half,

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:28.672
meant that there was demand for
land in a way that hadn't really

00:07:28.672 --> 00:07:30.740
been known since the fourteenth
century.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.975
There's a lot of evidence of
people nibbling at wasteland,

00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:38.021
forest land,
moor land, bringing land into

00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:39.209
cultivation.
 

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.930
In the Forest of Inglewood for
example,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.069
which was located up in the
northwest of England,

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:46.742
up here, there was a survey
made of illegal 'encroachments'

00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:49.615
in the forest,
people cutting out a little

00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:53.209
piece of land for themselves
where they could squat,

00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:58.456
and it revealed that over a
period of twenty or thirty years

00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:04.060
almost 200 encroachments had
been made into the forest there.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.480
So pressure on the land.
 

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.706
And inevitably also as the
population rose the size of the

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:14.189
wholly landless population rose
too.

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:18.870
There were more young people
surviving to adulthood for whom

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.759
there was no inheritance,
no place on the land.

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:24.468
Now those shifting
circumstances,

00:08:24.468 --> 00:08:27.932
the pressures on landlords,
the pressures that they'd pass

00:08:27.932 --> 00:08:31.127
on to their tenants,
the pressure of population

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:35.418
growth, helped to explain the
emergence in the early sixteenth

00:08:35.418 --> 00:08:39.426
century of some quite severe
tensions in the relationships

00:08:39.426 --> 00:08:42.240
between landlords and farm
tenants.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.626
Tensions in particular over
customs and the emergence of one

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:55.340
particular cardinal grievance,
the grievance of 'enclosure'.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.320
Now as I've explained earlier,
in some areas of the kingdom

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.128
agriculture had never been
practiced in great open fields

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:09.678
but had been practiced already
on enclosed farms.

00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:12.527
Before 1500,
in the areas where there

00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:16.480
was--there were--open fields,
some of them had been

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.990
reorganized by enclosing them to
make sheep pastures.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.070
This was done by landlords who
were short of tenants.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.339
They found that doing that was
a good way of keeping their land

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:30.929
in production,
although a low-intensity

00:09:30.929 --> 00:09:33.664
production,
when otherwise it might go

00:09:33.664 --> 00:09:36.158
vacant or might be unprofitable.
 

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:39.307
Wool was in demand from the
cloth industry so they went over

00:09:39.307 --> 00:09:40.908
to a kind of sheep ranching.
 

00:09:40.908 --> 00:09:44.928
At the time that wasn't
particularly controversial,

00:09:44.928 --> 00:09:50.725
but after the 1510s steps to
enclose land which had formerly

00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:54.950
been open became much more
controversial.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.413
In the Midlands,
which was a major

00:09:57.413 --> 00:10:01.956
wool-supplying area,
many landlords withdrew land

00:10:01.956 --> 00:10:07.409
from the plow to turn it into
sheep ranches despite the

00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:11.450
growing demand from tenants for
land.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.890
Some landlords also took in and
enclosed for their own use land

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.118
which had formerly been the
common pastureland of particular

00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:21.048
villages.
 

00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:24.388
Thereby they reduced the area
of common pasture available to

00:10:24.388 --> 00:10:27.570
their tenants,
which was a further grievance,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.714
especially since common land
was particularly valuable in

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.860
conditions of land hunger.
 

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.230
Well, these changing conditions
meant that enclosure,

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.325
which had previously been
merely a tactic you could adopt

00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:43.434
on your estate,
became a quite significant

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:46.690
grievance in many areas of the
kingdom.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:51.522
It seemed to many people a very
visible sign of the changing

00:10:51.522 --> 00:10:55.616
balance of power in rural
society between lords and

00:10:55.616 --> 00:10:56.600
tenants.
 

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.881
Sir Thomas More in his
Utopia refers to the

00:11:00.881 --> 00:11:05.600
phenomenon of sheep eating men
in England at this time,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.009
reflecting that sense of
grievance.

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:14.052
It's for these reasons that
issues of rents and fines and

00:11:14.052 --> 00:11:19.365
customs and common land became a
quite explosive cocktail in

00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:24.678
landlord-tenant relations by the
mid-sixteenth century.

00:11:24.678 --> 00:11:28.210
And there was also a little
more to it than that.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.606
The economic trends and the
population trends of the period

00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:36.549
were gradually producing a
greater differentiation in

00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:39.279
village society amongst tenants.
 

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:43.433
There were those who did quite
well in these circumstances,

00:11:43.433 --> 00:11:46.730
especially the bigger farmers,
the yeomanry.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.200
Quite often they held part of
their land in freehold;

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.940
they were somewhat protected.
 

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.159
Quite often they produced a
large surplus which they could

00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:59.889
market and if prices were rising
they could make bigger profits.

00:11:59.889 --> 00:12:03.360
They were able to pay higher
rents without too much trouble.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.120
They might take on more land to
extend their operations,

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.721
and if they wanted to do that
they were in a far better

00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:14.258
position to compete for
available land than were their

00:12:14.258 --> 00:12:15.658
poorer neighbors.
 

00:12:15.658 --> 00:12:19.174
So this is a period when one
sees the yeomanry becoming

00:12:19.174 --> 00:12:22.625
increasingly differentiated in
their wealth and living

00:12:22.625 --> 00:12:25.360
standards from their poorer
neighbors.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.660
These were people who were able
to benefit from the trends of

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.808
the period.
 

00:12:31.808 --> 00:12:34.440
They showed a lot of ambition
in the way they did that,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.528
and the ambition of those who
were best able to take advantage

00:12:39.528 --> 00:12:42.666
of the trends of the--
this generation,

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:46.783
that ambition is also shown in
response to another economic

00:12:46.783 --> 00:12:50.690
development of the period and
this time it's an economic

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.667
development which wasn't
directly connected to population

00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:59.070
or price trends but was
connected to religious changes.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.533
And I'm thinking of course of
the Dissolution of the

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:09.048
Monasteries and the bringing on
to the market of vast quantities

00:13:09.048 --> 00:13:11.500
of former monastic land.
 

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.754
Some figures relating to this
are there on your handout in

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:16.950
section three.
 

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:23.086
Basically, between 1536 and
1540 about 60% of the land which

00:13:23.086 --> 00:13:29.222
was owned by the church was
transferred to the crown through

00:13:29.222 --> 00:13:33.279
the Dissolution of the
Monasteries.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.450
Many studies have been done of
individual counties.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.946
In the county of Essex,
down here to the east of

00:13:38.946 --> 00:13:42.664
London, for example,
the church had owned about 28%

00:13:42.664 --> 00:13:45.120
of the manors in that county.
 

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.090
By 1540, after the Dissolution
it owned only 2%;

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.870
a massive transfer of land.
 

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.154
Well, these seizures of church
land were probably intended by

00:13:56.154 --> 00:14:00.441
Thomas Cromwell to endow the
crown in perpetuity with massive

00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:04.798
land holdings which would render
it absolutely unchallengeable

00:14:04.798 --> 00:14:09.011
and indeed might even render it
independent of any grants of

00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:11.370
taxation from Parliament.
 

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.484
But if that was Cromwell's
intention it failed to

00:14:15.484 --> 00:14:20.884
materialize, because most of the
monastic land was quite rapidly

00:14:20.884 --> 00:14:23.370
disposed of by the crown.
 

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.750
By the time Henry VIII himself
died in 1547,

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.116
he had already sold something
like two thirds of the monastery

00:14:32.116 --> 00:14:37.009
land which had come in to him,
and still more of this land was

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.990
sold later.
 

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.417
For example,
there's been a study done of

00:14:41.417 --> 00:14:46.644
the whole of Wales which shows
that of the monastic land there

00:14:46.644 --> 00:14:51.528
60% had gone by the death of
Henry in 1547 and by the time

00:14:51.528 --> 00:14:56.754
Elizabeth came to the throne in
1558 75% of the monastery land

00:14:56.754 --> 00:14:59.240
had been disposed of.
 

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.889
Why would the crown dispose of
the land in this kind of way?

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:07.423
Well, basically to pay for wars;
wars which were getting more

00:15:07.423 --> 00:15:11.006
expensive, requiring fortresses,
modern weapons,

00:15:11.006 --> 00:15:12.990
new ships and so forth.
 

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.710
Henry VIII in his last years
engaged in short,

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.990
inconclusive,
utterly futile,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:23.592
assertions of his rights,
as he saw them,

00:15:23.592 --> 00:15:28.533
against France and against
Scotland resulting in wars and

00:15:28.533 --> 00:15:32.942
massive expenditure which
accounted for much of the

00:15:32.942 --> 00:15:34.620
monastic land.
 

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.166
For our purposes today it's
interesting to note the results

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:41.895
of studies which have looked at
the identities of who's buying

00:15:41.895 --> 00:15:43.668
this land from the crown.
 

00:15:43.668 --> 00:15:47.285
Quite a lot went to the heads
of established noble and gentry

00:15:47.285 --> 00:15:50.285
families,
people who were anxious to take

00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:54.618
advantage of this wonderful
opportunity to consolidate their

00:15:54.618 --> 00:15:57.548
estates,
to rationalize the estates and

00:15:57.548 --> 00:16:00.330
so forth,
to build up their holdings in

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.850
particular areas of their
strength.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:07.159
Another group who emerged quite
strongly are people who were the

00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:10.649
youngest sons of such gentry and
noble families,

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:14.118
people who in the normal course
of events would expect most of

00:16:14.118 --> 00:16:17.360
the family's property to pass to
their older brothers,

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.192
but who now had an opportunity
to get in and get some land for

00:16:21.192 --> 00:16:22.009
themselves.
 

00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:23.908
Younger brothers.
 

00:16:23.908 --> 00:16:27.648
They could set up cadet
branches of the family and

00:16:27.648 --> 00:16:32.225
sometimes they did so with the
money which they had generated

00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:34.590
in trade or in professions.
 

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.681
Younger sons were often put
into trade or into professions

00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:43.131
and were able to make the money
which enabled them to return to

00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:46.291
landed society and set
themselves up as minor

00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:47.440
gentlemen.
 

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.230
Another significant group were
upwardly mobile people from the

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.551
middle ranks of society:
yeoman farmers piecing together

00:16:56.551 --> 00:17:01.419
field to field until they could
emerge with a sufficient estate

00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:06.042
to call themselves gentlemen;
people from the towns who had

00:17:06.042 --> 00:17:08.683
no gentry ancestry,
perhaps lawyers,

00:17:08.683 --> 00:17:11.643
perhaps merchants,
prosperous craftsmen and

00:17:11.643 --> 00:17:14.373
tradesmen,
who were able to acquire land

00:17:14.373 --> 00:17:18.910
and its superior social status,
perhaps in some cases on a

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:24.073
level which would again bring
them into the lower ranks of the

00:17:24.073 --> 00:17:24.920
gentry.
 

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.124
So there were customers enough
for this monastic land,

00:17:28.124 --> 00:17:31.450
and to serve their needs there
were many speculators.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:36.898
A lot of the monastic land was
bought by speculators who

00:17:36.898 --> 00:17:38.980
rapidly sold it on.
 

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.833
The overall effects of this was
a kind of feeding frenzy in the

00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:44.930
land market.
 

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.157
It resulted of course not only
in the severe reduction of the

00:17:49.157 --> 00:17:52.470
position of the church as a
great landowner,

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:57.771
but it also resulted ultimately
in a very significant rise in

00:17:57.771 --> 00:18:03.074
both the numbers of those who
called themselves gentlemen and

00:18:03.074 --> 00:18:07.670
in the relative wealth of the
gentry as a whole.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.558
So some people were doing very
well out of all of this,

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:16.000
but of course it's not all
buoyancy.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.064
No process of change of this
kind ever is,

00:18:18.064 --> 00:18:20.580
and so one has to ask,
"who were the losers in

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.890
these processes?"
 

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.548
And there are some large and
quite obvious groups.

00:18:26.548 --> 00:18:30.063
Amongst the losers were the
small farm tenants who couldn't

00:18:30.063 --> 00:18:33.355
easily meet rising rents,
who didn't sell enough on the

00:18:33.355 --> 00:18:36.269
market to produce the profits
which would pay them,

00:18:36.269 --> 00:18:40.509
who were finding it difficult
to make ends meet.

00:18:40.509 --> 00:18:43.630
Then there were those who
were--one could think of as

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.727
would-be farm tenants,
those who might aspire to

00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:50.242
getting a foothold on the land
but found it increasingly

00:18:50.242 --> 00:18:52.798
difficult because rents were
rising,

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:56.700
fines were rising and so forth,
and they couldn't compete with

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.664
the bigger guys in the village
who could take up land that came

00:19:00.664 --> 00:19:02.838
available on the local market.
 

00:19:02.838 --> 00:19:06.766
It could be quite a difficult
time for the young in that

00:19:06.766 --> 00:19:07.480
respect.
 

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.997
But above all there were the
growing numbers of landless

00:19:11.997 --> 00:19:17.089
people in the countryside or in
the towns whose living depended

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:21.607
principally on what they could
earn from wage earning as

00:19:21.607 --> 00:19:26.536
laborers and the rights to use
commons which they might enjoy

00:19:26.536 --> 00:19:29.740
in the places where they lived.
 

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.438
Those who depended on wages
were particularly hard hit by

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:37.269
inflation and despite the fact
that prices were rising,

00:19:37.269 --> 00:19:40.528
squeezing their living
standards, wages rose only

00:19:40.528 --> 00:19:44.667
slowly because the population
was growing and there was plenty

00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:46.230
of labor available.
 

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:51.460
Wages tended to remain pretty
sticky at customary levels for

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.500
long periods of time.
 

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.380
That meant that people's real
wages, the real purchasing power

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.778
of their wages,
was falling.

00:20:00.778 --> 00:20:05.922
And quite close studies of this
have been done and they suggest

00:20:05.922 --> 00:20:10.898
that between 1510 and 1550 the
purchasing power of wages fell

00:20:10.898 --> 00:20:14.298
by about 40% in the south of
England.

00:20:14.298 --> 00:20:17.776
By the 1550s,
they were down 50% and they

00:20:17.776 --> 00:20:23.338
began to recover modestly only
in the later sixteenth century.

00:20:23.338 --> 00:20:28.118
So these were quite hard times
for a lot of people.

00:20:28.118 --> 00:20:31.084
William Harrison,
who wrote a famous description

00:20:31.084 --> 00:20:34.680
of England at the beginning of
the reign of Elizabeth,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.087
described how many of what he
described as the "inferior

00:20:39.087 --> 00:20:42.614
sort of people"
lived principally on what he

00:20:42.614 --> 00:20:47.170
called "white meats":
eggs and cheese and bread.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.445
In times of dearth they were
particularly hard hit and might

00:20:50.445 --> 00:20:53.888
have to live on peas and beans
or even ground acorns which they

00:20:53.888 --> 00:20:55.500
tried to bake into bread.
 

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.911
He added, "I will not say
that this extremity is often

00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:06.683
also found in times of plenty,
but if I should I could easily

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.660
stand my trial."
 

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.910
That's Harrison's ironic
comment on the living standards

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.920
of the poor in his time.
 

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.036
Well, all of this is reflected
in a growing contemporary

00:21:19.036 --> 00:21:21.880
concern with the problem of
poverty.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.065
There had always been poor of
course, but poverty as a major

00:21:26.065 --> 00:21:30.038
social problem hadn't been a
major issue in the fifteenth

00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:30.890
century.
 

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:35.618
It was more a matter of the
poverty that resulted from life

00:21:35.618 --> 00:21:40.430
cycle crises of a small minority
of people: the widowed,

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.690
the aged, the sick,
orphaned children.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.222
These were the ones that
contemporaries referred to as

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:48.805
the "impotent poor,"
those who could not help

00:21:48.805 --> 00:21:51.830
themselves,
those who were poor by

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.430
circumstance beyond their
control.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:00.603
But as the sixteenth century
advanced people began talking

00:22:00.603 --> 00:22:06.140
and writing about poverty in two
worryingly expanded forms.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.269
They first became aware of the
problem of vagrancy,

00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:14.028
the problem of what they called
'rogues and vagabonds',

00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:19.236
homeless people visible on the
streets of the towns or on the

00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:21.578
roads of the countryside.
 

00:22:21.578 --> 00:22:25.486
People like one man who was
arrested by the justices of the

00:22:25.486 --> 00:22:28.180
peace over near the Welsh border
who,

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.710
in the examination which they
took from him,

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.769
told them that he was a person
who dwells no--

00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:38.971
I'm quoting the
examination--who "dwells

00:22:38.971 --> 00:22:43.630
nowhere nor has no abiding but
where he might find work."

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.588
The vagrant looking for work,
moving around the countryside.

00:22:46.588 --> 00:22:49.792
People like this were a much
more common sight as the

00:22:49.792 --> 00:22:51.578
sixteenth century advanced.
 

00:22:51.578 --> 00:22:55.676
It's quite interesting that in
his translation of the New

00:22:55.676 --> 00:23:00.058
Testament William Tyndale,
in trying to describe a scene

00:23:00.058 --> 00:23:04.733
from the Acts of the Apostles
where Saint Paul is attacked by

00:23:04.733 --> 00:23:08.634
a mob in Thessalonica,
translated the Greek word which

00:23:08.634 --> 00:23:11.538
literally means people standing
in the street,

00:23:11.538 --> 00:23:14.400
he translated it as
"vagabonds."

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.906
When Tyndale tried to imagine
people hanging around in the

00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:21.660
street he imagined them as some
of these vagrants who he would

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.058
have seen in the streets of
London.

00:23:24.058 --> 00:23:27.933
So vagrancy,
rogues and vagabonds,

00:23:27.933 --> 00:23:32.630
are emerging as a significant
problem.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.912
On the other hand,
there was the growing problem

00:23:35.912 --> 00:23:39.753
of what they described as the
"laboring poor,"

00:23:39.753 --> 00:23:43.875
people whose whole style of
life was based increasingly on a

00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:47.909
kind of economy of makeshifts,
getting work wherever they

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:48.298
could.
 

00:23:48.298 --> 00:23:51.653
Working, certainly,
but finding it increasingly

00:23:51.653 --> 00:23:53.838
difficult to make ends meet.
 

00:23:53.838 --> 00:23:57.326
The laboring poor,
people who would also fall into

00:23:57.326 --> 00:24:01.308
really severe poverty if they
suffered any misfortune;

00:24:01.308 --> 00:24:05.180
if they couldn't find work,
if there was a depression in

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.782
the cloth industry,
if they fell sick,

00:24:07.782 --> 00:24:08.980
and so forth.
 

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.998
These people were especially
visible in areas where wage

00:24:11.998 --> 00:24:16.489
workers were concentrated,
principally the towns or those

00:24:16.489 --> 00:24:21.997
areas of the countryside where
many people worked in rural

00:24:21.997 --> 00:24:23.349
industries.
 

00:24:23.349 --> 00:24:23.950
Okay then.
 

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.118
Let's just take stock.
 

00:24:27.118 --> 00:24:31.586
By the 1540s,
rising prices and demographic

00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:38.500
growth had seen in some ways a
quickening of economic activity.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:44.480
For some people this brought
new opportunities and indeed

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.828
enhanced prosperity.
 

00:24:46.828 --> 00:24:51.590
But at the same time there was
also a growing sense of tension

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.884
in the relationships between
landlords and their peasant

00:24:55.884 --> 00:24:58.886
tenants,
an emerging problem of land

00:24:58.886 --> 00:25:01.518
hunger,
a growing problem of a wage

00:25:01.518 --> 00:25:05.964
laboring population which was
very vulnerable to poverty on an

00:25:05.964 --> 00:25:07.568
unaccustomed scale.
 

00:25:07.568 --> 00:25:11.000
Now people were aware of these
changes,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.838
they were aware of the
tensions, but from their

00:25:14.838 --> 00:25:19.680
perspective at the time it was
the symptoms of change which

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.519
were more apparent than the
actual causes.

00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:27.234
It was exceedingly difficult
for people in the sixteenth

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:30.680
century to comprehend what was
happening to them.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.279
They didn't keep official
statistics.

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:36.356
The figures which are on your
handout have been calculated by

00:25:36.356 --> 00:25:38.410
historians using a variety of
sources.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.588
Contemporaries didn't have
information of this kind.

00:25:42.588 --> 00:25:47.865
They tended to perceive changes
and emergent problems of this

00:25:47.865 --> 00:25:52.790
kind through their inherited
attitudes, their essentially

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.112
medieval moral philosophy;
a view of the world in which

00:25:57.112 --> 00:26:01.078
economic behavior wasn't treated
as a distinct area of activity,

00:26:01.078 --> 00:26:04.307
a phenomenon to be studied in
itself by the science of

00:26:04.307 --> 00:26:08.887
economics,
they saw it as a branch of

00:26:08.887 --> 00:26:13.259
personal and social morality.
 

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:16.067
The ideal world in their view
was the world of the

00:26:16.067 --> 00:26:18.588
commonwealth,
which I've described to you.

00:26:18.588 --> 00:26:23.020
They saw these problems as
failings in the ideal of the

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.976
commonwealth,
failings which could be

00:26:25.976 --> 00:26:30.078
attributed to the misdeeds of
specific people.

00:26:30.078 --> 00:26:33.842
Well, these ideas not only
persisted throughout the early

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:37.941
sixteenth century but they were
powerfully reemphasized in the

00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:41.568
1540s with the emergence of a
group of moralists,

00:26:41.568 --> 00:26:44.699
most of them Protestant
clergymen, in the reign of

00:26:44.699 --> 00:26:47.540
Edward VI,
who addressed these social and

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.950
economic grievances.
 

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.944
They were known at the time as
the "Commonwealth's

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:57.236
Men" because they talked
constantly about the needs of

00:26:57.236 --> 00:26:58.788
the commonwealth.
 

00:26:58.788 --> 00:27:03.182
Such people also saw the
reformation not simply in terms

00:27:03.182 --> 00:27:07.174
of the jurisdictional
independence of the Church of

00:27:07.174 --> 00:27:11.971
England from the Church of Rome,
or simply in terms of

00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:14.690
fundamental doctrinal changes.
 

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:19.931
They also thought it was an
opportunity for the

00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:26.313
re-moralizing of society,
the revitalization of Christian

00:27:26.313 --> 00:27:28.818
values in society.
 

00:27:28.818 --> 00:27:32.440
They advocated an ideal
Christian commonwealth.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.868
They thought this was the
opportunity to achieve it,

00:27:35.868 --> 00:27:40.887
and yet they saw all around
them evidence of the corruption

00:27:40.887 --> 00:27:46.251
of social relationships by what
they saw as the cardinal sin of

00:27:46.251 --> 00:27:49.509
covetousness,
one of their favorite words,

00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:53.646
covetousness--
greed--and the pernicious idea

00:27:53.646 --> 00:27:58.380
again which they constantly
refer to that,

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:04.259
quote, "every man may do
with his own as he will."

00:28:04.259 --> 00:28:09.021
The motion that every man may
do with his own as he will,

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:13.190
which they regarded as an
unchristian attitude.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.452
In their view,
worldly goods were given by God

00:28:17.452 --> 00:28:23.232
to be handled with stewardship,
with an interest to society as

00:28:23.232 --> 00:28:24.368
a whole.
 

00:28:24.368 --> 00:28:28.118
So their social vision was
essentially conservative.

00:28:28.118 --> 00:28:32.971
They saw change in terms of
social dislocation and moral

00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:34.118
corruption.
 

00:28:34.118 --> 00:28:37.692
They denounced the
representatives of covetousness

00:28:37.692 --> 00:28:39.368
whom they identified.
 

00:28:39.368 --> 00:28:43.680
They spoke for example of
"ungentle gentlemen."

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.499
They attacked what they called
the "caterpillars of the

00:28:47.499 --> 00:28:50.477
commonwealth"
who were eating up its green

00:28:50.477 --> 00:28:51.190
shoots.
 

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:56.038
They attacked what they saw as
exploitation and oppression of

00:28:56.038 --> 00:29:00.805
the poor, and they did all of
this in a language reminiscent

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:03.230
of Old Testament prophets.
 

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.815
R.H. Tawney,
a great historian of these

00:29:05.815 --> 00:29:08.462
changes,
says they used the moral

00:29:08.462 --> 00:29:12.162
rhetoric, in his words,
of "an age that had

00:29:12.162 --> 00:29:14.490
rediscovered the Bible."
 

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.108
Well, it hadn't rediscovered it.
 

00:29:16.108 --> 00:29:20.710
It had discovered it for the
first time in English,

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.008
and as I say,
the language of Jeremiah or

00:29:24.008 --> 00:29:29.038
Isaiah is the kind of language
that they used to denounce what

00:29:29.038 --> 00:29:32.088
they saw as a world out of
joint.

00:29:32.088 --> 00:29:37.048
Well, the pamphlets written by
these people in the 1540s and

00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:42.430
1550s are a quite magnificent
literature of moral indignation.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:47.108
It still has the capacity to
thrill when you read it.

00:29:47.108 --> 00:29:50.478
It indicated also what's been
described by one recent

00:29:50.478 --> 00:29:53.651
historian as a "crisis of
legitimation,"

00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:55.529
a crisis of legitimation.
 

00:29:55.529 --> 00:29:59.897
The world seemed out of joint
in so many ways,

00:29:59.897 --> 00:30:05.140
but response to change also
took a more direct form.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.460
There were not only those who
were appealing for reform,

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.733
for moral reformation,
for people to behave as they

00:30:11.733 --> 00:30:15.582
should,
there were also those who were

00:30:15.582 --> 00:30:21.752
prepared to directly resist
these changes especially in the

00:30:21.752 --> 00:30:23.348
countryside.
 

00:30:23.348 --> 00:30:27.973
From about the 1530s onwards,
researchers working on records

00:30:27.973 --> 00:30:32.834
of local government and on the
courts find that the country was

00:30:32.834 --> 00:30:37.381
increasingly pockmarked with
minor forms of disorder as the

00:30:37.381 --> 00:30:41.614
peasantry of particular
localities resisted initiatives

00:30:41.614 --> 00:30:47.294
on the part of their landlords,
perhaps rioting against the

00:30:47.294 --> 00:30:52.288
enclosing of fields or of common
land and so forth,

00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:56.759
or against changes in their
customs and tenures.

00:30:56.759 --> 00:31:01.275
And such resistance becomes
above all evident in some of the

00:31:01.275 --> 00:31:05.713
great risings of the commons
which took place in the middle

00:31:05.713 --> 00:31:10.548
third of the sixteenth century,
risings which convulsed first

00:31:10.548 --> 00:31:14.205
the north of England and then
the east of England in

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:15.210
particular.
 

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:20.222
The first of these risings was
the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536,

00:31:20.222 --> 00:31:23.700
a rising of much of the north
of England.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.808
This was a complex event.
 

00:31:26.808 --> 00:31:31.080
It combined religious hostility
to the reformation and a desire

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.669
to defend the monasteries,
which had been ordered to be

00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:37.266
dissolved,
with a variety of other

00:31:37.266 --> 00:31:42.181
grievances and in particular
agrarian grievances against the

00:31:42.181 --> 00:31:46.846
enclosing of commons and the
forcing up of entry fines to

00:31:46.846 --> 00:31:47.680
land.
 

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.843
It was described by those who
took part in it as a

00:31:50.843 --> 00:31:54.201
"pilgrimage of grace for
the commonwealth,"

00:31:54.201 --> 00:31:56.588
for the commonwealth as a
whole,

00:31:56.588 --> 00:31:59.660
and those who mustered for the
pilgrimage,

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.000
some 20,000 men,
regarded themselves as

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.868
defending each branch of the
commonwealth.

00:32:06.868 --> 00:32:09.769
They wanted the king to turn
away from his evil counselors,

00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:12.826
they wanted the ancient rights
of the nobility to be properly

00:32:12.826 --> 00:32:15.710
recognized,
they wanted the rights of the

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:19.255
church to be respected and,
as they put in one of their

00:32:19.255 --> 00:32:22.965
statements of grievances,
they also demanded that the

00:32:22.965 --> 00:32:27.380
"commonalty be used as they
should be"--

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:31.298
"the commonality be used
as they should be"--

00:32:31.298 --> 00:32:34.769
particularly in matters
relating to the land.

00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:36.670
So this was a complex event.
 

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.626
It led to the rebel army
eventually mustering near

00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:43.933
Pontefract in South Yorkshire,
having taken the city of York

00:32:43.933 --> 00:32:48.721
where it faced a standoff with
royal troops under the Duke of

00:32:48.721 --> 00:32:49.598
Norfolk.
 

00:32:49.598 --> 00:32:52.038
The Duke negotiated with the
rebels,

00:32:52.038 --> 00:32:55.078
persuaded those gentlemen who
had joined them,

00:32:55.078 --> 00:32:58.723
in particular,
to act as negotiators with the

00:32:58.723 --> 00:33:01.742
crown,
promised that their grievances

00:33:01.742 --> 00:33:05.890
would be met,
and persuaded them to disperse.

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:11.220
The rebels were wrong to trust
Norfolk.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.570
He was already writing to the
crown that he regarded no

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.930
promises made to a rebel as
binding.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:21.060
And when the crown got the
opportunity with the flurry of a

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.263
few more agrarian troubles in
the northwest at the beginning

00:33:25.263 --> 00:33:29.252
of the following year royal
troops went in and suppressed

00:33:29.252 --> 00:33:31.960
them with considerable violence.
 

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.390
Robert Aske,
the leader of the rebels who

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.765
was a lawyer from York,
along with a number of other

00:33:39.765 --> 00:33:44.740
figures, was arrested,
tried and executed for treason.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.422
That was the Pilgrimage of
Grace, probably the biggest

00:33:48.422 --> 00:33:51.480
threat that the Tudor monarchy
ever faced.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.682
Then in 1549 came another
widespread burst of unrest known

00:33:56.682 --> 00:34:01.884
as the "Camping Time,"
because many tenants from

00:34:01.884 --> 00:34:07.544
particular areas were gathering
together in protest and forming

00:34:07.544 --> 00:34:08.639
camps.
 

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.367
These were scattered all over
central, eastern and southern

00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:13.010
England.
 

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:17.159
Many of these camps were
ultimately dispersed.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:20.090
The Earl of Arundel in Sussex
for example,

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:25.518
down towards the south coast,
met the protesting peasants,

00:34:25.518 --> 00:34:30.429
assured them that he would
speak for them on their behalf,

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.719
and persuaded them to disperse.
 

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.835
This was the way that it could
sometimes be handled and Arundel

00:34:35.835 --> 00:34:39.119
kept his word;
he did speak for them.

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:43.503
But one particular rising did
not disperse and that was the

00:34:43.503 --> 00:34:47.056
one in the county of Norfolk led
by Robert Kett,

00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:48.570
a yeoman farmer.
 

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:53.650
Kett's rebels advanced to set
up a camp just outside Norwich,

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.380
on Mousehold Heath outside
Norwich,

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.460
where Kett, who was very well
organized,

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.630
had a supply system to keep
the--to keep his army,

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.280
as it was by then,
well supplied.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.739
He sat under an oak tree on the
heath which was known as the Oak

00:35:09.739 --> 00:35:14.057
of Reformation and there with
his counsel he delivered justice

00:35:14.057 --> 00:35:17.456
to the local farm tenants
against their gentlemen

00:35:17.456 --> 00:35:18.590
landlords.
 

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:23.659
The principal grievances of the
Norfolk rising were agrarian.

00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:28.179
They were protesting against
enhanced rents and against the

00:35:28.179 --> 00:35:31.530
abuses of common land by their
landlords.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:36.443
And they're also remarkable in
that Kett's rebels refused to

00:35:36.443 --> 00:35:37.360
disperse.
 

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.250
Eventually, a royal army was
sent against them.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.342
It consisted mostly of
mercenaries who had been hired

00:35:43.342 --> 00:35:44.829
from Germany and Italy.
 

00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:48.505
They didn't dare use English
troops for fear they would

00:35:48.505 --> 00:35:50.480
sympathize with the rebels.
 

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.916
Kett's army refused to disperse
and went down fighting in a

00:35:54.916 --> 00:35:59.199
battle at Dussindale just
outside the city of Norwich.

00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:04.492
It's been said of these peasant
rebels that they were trying to

00:36:04.492 --> 00:36:09.358
create "a world in which
gentlemen were kept at arm's

00:36:09.358 --> 00:36:10.809
length."
 

00:36:10.809 --> 00:36:14.971
They were trying to preserve
the rights that they had in the

00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:18.778
land in a changing economic
climate which threatened to

00:36:18.778 --> 00:36:21.333
diminish them,
trying to create a world in

00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:23.309
which gentlemen were kept at
arm's length,

00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:26.831
and their statements of
grievances and demands make very

00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:28.239
interesting reading.
 

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:30.380
There's a rich literature on
these rebellions.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:34.135
If anyone's interested in that
for an essay topic,

00:36:34.135 --> 00:36:36.360
I'd be happy to advise you.
 

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:42.059
So in seeking to restore what
was essentially an idealized

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:46.159
vision of stable social
relationships,

00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:51.402
the just commonwealth,
an ideal which they located in

00:36:51.402 --> 00:36:56.014
a past golden age,
both the peasant rebels and the

00:36:56.014 --> 00:37:00.264
literary Commonwealth Men,
the preachers and clergy,

00:37:00.264 --> 00:37:02.500
had a great deal in common.
 

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.380
And together they give perhaps
the most vivid expression,

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.400
literary expression and
practical expression,

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.480
to the sense that many people
had in the mid-sixteenth century

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.813
that the bonds of society,
the bonds of commonwealth,

00:37:17.813 --> 00:37:20.760
were fraying and falling apart.
 

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.047
But neither the Commonwealth's
Men in their books and sermons

00:37:25.047 --> 00:37:29.550
nor the peasant rebels could
turn back the dynamic of change.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:35.329
Moral exhortation or localized
protest by people who couldn't

00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:40.918
face a royal army effectively
were not enough and both were

00:37:40.918 --> 00:37:43.518
swept aside after 1549.
 

00:37:43.518 --> 00:37:47.949
It's one of the nice ironies of
history that the place outside

00:37:47.949 --> 00:37:50.181
Norwich,
now in the suburbs,

00:37:50.181 --> 00:37:54.550
where Kett's rebels were
finally defeated very bloodily--

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:57.958
many were
slaughtered--Dussindale,

00:37:57.958 --> 00:38:01.780
is now the site of a shopping
mall.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.945
So the English peasantry made
their last stand there and it's

00:38:05.945 --> 00:38:09.139
now a shopping mall,
a sort of shrine to modern

00:38:09.139 --> 00:38:10.250
consumerism.
 

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.969
Amongst the murals that
decorate it there's one of

00:38:12.969 --> 00:38:15.909
Robert Kett sitting under the
Tree of Reformation,

00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:21.311
which I hope schoolchildren in
Norwich will all recognize as

00:38:21.311 --> 00:38:24.150
they go about their shopping.
 

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.099
But it wasn't all repression.
 

00:38:26.099 --> 00:38:28.429
There's another side to the
story.

00:38:28.429 --> 00:38:32.547
By 1549, some people in
positions of authority in the

00:38:32.547 --> 00:38:37.378
kingdom were equally concerned
about all of this and they were

00:38:37.378 --> 00:38:42.289
trying to come to grips with
change in an alternative way.

00:38:42.289 --> 00:38:46.735
A striking piece of evidence of
this is a wonderful composition

00:38:46.735 --> 00:38:50.894
written for circulation in
manuscript in 1549 by Sir Thomas

00:38:50.894 --> 00:38:54.838
Smith and entitled The
Discourse of the Commonweal of

00:38:54.838 --> 00:38:56.130
England.
 

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.420
It's a remarkable piece of
writing.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.940
It wasn't published until after
Smith's death,

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.329
and at one time it was actually
attributed to William

00:39:03.329 --> 00:39:05.596
Shakespeare,
but it's now pretty certain

00:39:05.596 --> 00:39:07.989
that it was written by Sir
Thomas Smith.

00:39:07.989 --> 00:39:12.277
He was professor of civil law
at the University of Cambridge

00:39:12.277 --> 00:39:16.492
and a leading member later in
his career of the royal Privy

00:39:16.492 --> 00:39:21.070
Council under Edward VI and
subsequently under Elizabeth I.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:25.570
Smith was trying to think out
the problems of his day,

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.572
not to denounce the moral
failings of particular

00:39:28.572 --> 00:39:32.338
individuals or groups,
but to try to understand what

00:39:32.338 --> 00:39:34.891
was going on,
to try to understand the

00:39:34.891 --> 00:39:38.592
motives and the pressures that
were felt by different people in

00:39:38.592 --> 00:39:39.250
society.
 

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.500
And he did that by having a
discussion.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.909
He wrote a dialog between a
gentleman,

00:39:45.909 --> 00:39:49.099
a husbandman--a peasant,
a craftsman--

00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:52.081
a wage worker,
and a figure called the Doctor

00:39:52.081 --> 00:39:56.353
who is a sort of academic figure
who acts as a kind of moderator

00:39:56.353 --> 00:39:57.980
for this discussion.
 

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.378
He imagines them all sitting
outside a pub discussing the

00:40:01.378 --> 00:40:03.199
affairs of the commonwealth.
 

00:40:03.199 --> 00:40:07.228
It's because of this dialog
form that it was once attributed

00:40:07.228 --> 00:40:08.389
to Shakespeare.
 

00:40:08.389 --> 00:40:11.059
The representatives of the
different groups in The

00:40:11.059 --> 00:40:14.036
Discourse of the Commonweal
put their own perspectives,

00:40:14.036 --> 00:40:15.320
their own grievances.
 

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.291
The different voices of
different interest groups are

00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:18.750
heard.
 

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:22.559
The Doctor who acts as
moderator provides a kind of

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:26.827
disinterested analytical
authority helping to explore the

00:40:26.827 --> 00:40:30.179
underlying causes to propose
solutions,

00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:33.568
to think of ways that the
interests of different groups

00:40:33.568 --> 00:40:34.949
might be reconciled.
 

00:40:34.949 --> 00:40:37.719
So, for example,
when the view is put by the

00:40:37.719 --> 00:40:41.264
gentlemen that all men are free
"to make their most

00:40:41.264 --> 00:40:45.130
advantage of that which is their
own," the phrase--

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.501
well, close to the
phrase--which was always being

00:40:47.501 --> 00:40:49.429
denounced by the Commonwealth's
Men,

00:40:49.429 --> 00:40:53.760
Smith has the Doctor reply not
by denouncing covetousness but

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.360
by saying,
yes, they may,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:01.340
but they "may not abuse
their own...

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.599
to the damage of the
commonweal."

00:41:04.599 --> 00:41:08.791
Good lords should set limits to
the pursuit of individual

00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:10.289
economic interest.
 

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:13.273
In short then,
he's willing to accept the

00:41:13.273 --> 00:41:16.855
simple reality of
self-interested behavior but he

00:41:16.855 --> 00:41:21.182
seeks to prevent abuses or to
channel that behavior in ways

00:41:21.182 --> 00:41:24.913
that it might serve the common
interest through the

00:41:24.913 --> 00:41:27.599
encouragement of enterprise.
 

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:31.630
It's because of that kind of
attitude that Smith has been

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:35.590
described as the father of
political economy and there's

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.389
some justice in that.
 

00:41:37.389 --> 00:41:41.260
But essentially,
putting him in his own time,

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.219
he was in the classical
humanist tradition.

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:48.460
He had great faith in the
positive effects of good

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.568
government as a means of
harmonizing conflicting

00:41:51.568 --> 00:41:54.586
interests,
and that's what he's trying

00:41:54.586 --> 00:41:56.389
essentially to achieve.
 

00:41:56.389 --> 00:42:01.233
Well, Sir Thomas Smith wasn't
alone and he had considerable

00:42:01.233 --> 00:42:05.827
influence upon like-minded
statesmen under Edward VI and

00:42:05.827 --> 00:42:09.920
still more in the early years of
Elizabeth I.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.300
He sat himself in Elizabeth's
council.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.652
He was responsible for drafting
some of the early legislation of

00:42:15.652 --> 00:42:16.610
her parliaments.
 

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:20.889
He was a very close friend of
her chief advisor,

00:42:20.889 --> 00:42:22.710
Sir William Cecil.
 

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:27.300
And it led, this kind of
attitude among Smith and others,

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:31.456
to a kind of dual strategy on
the part of government which is

00:42:31.456 --> 00:42:34.920
gradually emerging in the
mid-sixteenth century.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.369
On the one hand,
they want to stabilize things;

00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:40.954
they want to dampen things down;
they want to re-knit the

00:42:40.954 --> 00:42:43.480
fraying fabric of the
commonwealth.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.992
On the other hand,
they were very aware of the

00:42:46.992 --> 00:42:49.333
need to pursue,
where possible,

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:51.518
orderly economic growth.
 

00:42:51.518 --> 00:42:53.460
And this issued in a number of
statutes,

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.880
which are listed in the last
part of your handout and which

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.289
I'll just briefly mention,
which were intended to be steps

00:43:02.289 --> 00:43:03.710
towards these ends.
 

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:09.451
In 1551, the coinage was
revalued and reissued in an

00:43:09.451 --> 00:43:15.079
attempt to curb the worst
excesses of inflation.

00:43:15.079 --> 00:43:19.833
In 1552, legislation was passed
against abuses in marketing

00:43:19.833 --> 00:43:24.422
again with a view to the
problems occasioned by the price

00:43:24.422 --> 00:43:25.159
rise.
 

00:43:25.159 --> 00:43:27.876
In the 1550s,
the royal courts were made more

00:43:27.876 --> 00:43:30.840
open to hear the grievances of
the peasantry,

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.054
some of whom had not previously
been able to plead in royal

00:43:35.054 --> 00:43:35.710
courts.
 

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.590
In 1563--we're now into the
reign of Elizabeth--

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.659
the Statute of Artificers was
passed,

00:43:41.659 --> 00:43:44.402
the longest single act of
Parliament passed in England

00:43:44.402 --> 00:43:48.144
before the twentieth century,
which went into great detail in

00:43:48.144 --> 00:43:51.576
attempts to regulate
relationships between employers

00:43:51.576 --> 00:43:54.244
and employees;
to lay down rules,

00:43:54.244 --> 00:43:59.246
to introduce for example annual
assessments of wages so that

00:43:59.246 --> 00:44:03.230
wages could be adjusted in line
with prices.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:07.710
In 1563, legislation was passed
to restrict not all forms of

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:12.190
enclosure but those forms of
enclosure which were thought to

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.329
be harmful.
 

00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:17.550
If enclosure was beneficial it
would be permitted.

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:21.061
And in addition they
introduced, on the model of

00:44:21.061 --> 00:44:25.320
experiments which had been
attempted in a number of towns,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.460
forms of relief for the
impotent poor;

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.436
a constructive system of poor
relief which was to operate at

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:36.009
the level of the parish
involving the raising of money

00:44:36.009 --> 00:44:39.650
from local taxation of those who
could afford it,

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:43.597
the "poor rate,"
and the dispersal of that money

00:44:43.597 --> 00:44:45.190
to the impotent poor.
 

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.675
Finally, efforts were made to
encourage economically

00:44:48.675 --> 00:44:52.639
enterprising people who brought
projects to the government:

00:44:52.639 --> 00:44:55.579
the establishment of new trade
routes,

00:44:55.579 --> 00:44:58.329
the encouragement of shipping
and fishing,

00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:01.661
the establishment of new
manufacturing industries which

00:45:01.661 --> 00:45:05.061
might be granted a royal patent,
giving them a monopoly until

00:45:05.061 --> 00:45:07.945
they were established,--
it's the origins of the patent

00:45:07.945 --> 00:45:09.842
system--
the encouragement of

00:45:09.842 --> 00:45:13.730
immigration of skilled
Protestant refugees from abroad,

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:19.172
especially from the Netherlands
where the religious wars were

00:45:19.172 --> 00:45:19.989
raging.
 

00:45:19.989 --> 00:45:23.780
So one mustn't exaggerate the
impact of all of this.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.280
This is the sixteenth century.
 

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.679
Their powers of enforcement
were limited.

00:45:28.679 --> 00:45:32.905
But efforts were being made,
very visible efforts to do

00:45:32.905 --> 00:45:35.409
something about the situation.
 

00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:40.291
And that marked a significant
step forward in the conception

00:45:40.291 --> 00:45:44.099
of the responsibilities of the
Tudor state,

00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:49.134
a broadening of its role,
an increasing presence in

00:45:49.134 --> 00:45:53.101
attempting to shape,
to channel, the economic and

00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:57.514
social developments of the time,
to develop policy to deal with

00:45:57.514 --> 00:46:00.159
the problems that they produced.
 

00:46:00.159 --> 00:46:03.771
And that helped shape the
environment of change as people

00:46:03.771 --> 00:46:07.445
gradually moved from the first
shocks of response to these

00:46:07.445 --> 00:46:10.992
changing features of the
economic and social environment

00:46:10.992 --> 00:46:14.990
and began to enter a period of
transition in the late sixteenth

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:18.989
century towards a more
thoroughly commercial economy,

00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:22.989
which is something I'll touch
on later.

00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:24.849
But for now we need to turn
back again,

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:27.634
having looked at what was
happening in the mid-sixteenth

00:46:27.634 --> 00:46:29.659
century outside the religious
sphere,

00:46:29.659 --> 00:46:34.036
to the issues of the
reformation and the settlement

00:46:34.036 --> 00:46:39.550
which was attempted with the
accession in 1558 of Elizabeth,

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:41.800
and we'll take that up on
Tuesday.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:47.000

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.550
Prof: Okay,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.070
Good morning.
 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.840
I think things are going to
work better today.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.292
I'm optimistic about the audio
equipment and about our slide

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:13.340
material and things such as
that.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.840
All cell phones off and we will
begin.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.917
Don't forget sections start
tonight at seven o'clock and

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:20.770
there's another set at eight
o'clock and then Friday

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.400
afternoon at one thirty and
Monday morning.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.680
We've got that all online for
you.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.148
And you do your work product
and you bring it to sections and

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:31.750
hand it in to your TA in section
each time.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.000
So that's the way this works.
 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.534
I'll be sending you a global
e-mail bringing you up to date

00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:40.520
with some other things later on
this afternoon.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.951
Okay.
 

00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.658
So today we--Actually,
before I get to that,

00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:46.900
any questions from you?
 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.920
Student: Yeah.
 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.941
Is there stuff to do--
Prof: Is there stuff to

00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:54.310
do for section tonight?
 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.874
Yes, but only the stuff that
was assigned,

00:00:56.874 --> 00:01:00.189
the Listening Exercises that
are assigned early on.

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:01.640
It's just one,
nine through 11,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.543
which you've probably had done
for days now so you just bring

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:06.140
that material and hand it in.
 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.219
Others will be assigned tonight.
 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:09.250
This is shopping period.
 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.747
We're started sifting through
things and then we'll get

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:12.209
rolling.
 

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:13.079
Gentleman.
 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:58.900
 
 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.575
Today we're going to come to
what I would call the

00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:03.159
nitty-gritty of the course.
 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.358
We no longer have any
introductory material but we're

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:09.802
going to jump into musical
notation and we're going to be

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:12.508
dealing with things such as half
notes,

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:14.854
quarter notes,
things like that,

00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:19.389
but before we do this I'd like
to say a couple of words about

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.229
musical notation because it
affects how we deal with music,

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.610
how we treat music.
 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:38.500
 
 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.160
Musical notation is a
particularly Western phenomenon,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.348
and when you stop and think
about it only we in the West,

00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:48.402
and by West what I mean is the
United States and Canada and

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:51.412
Western Europe and Russia,
parts of South America,

00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:56.324
only we use musical notation
and we use it principally for

00:02:56.324 --> 00:02:58.220
our high art music.
 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.001
That's not to say that the
Chinese don't have an esoteric

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.782
form of musical notation,
that the Indians do not have an

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:05.669
esoteric form of musical
notation.

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.995
They do, but it doesn't
intersect quite as intensely as

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:13.520
musical notation does in Western
cultures.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.700
Most cultures around the world,
if you stop and think about it,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.188
don't use musical notation.
 

00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:22.244
But we do here with our art
music and that has two

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.318
advantages.
 

00:03:23.318 --> 00:03:25.288
Let's talk about the advantages
first.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:32.252
One, it allows the composer to
specify rather precisely what he

00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:35.818
or she wants,
to sort of write things out in

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:40.292
the form of musical details,
so as the result the creator in

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:45.260
this Western art form takes on
greater importance than the

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.752
creator in other cultures where
the composer so to speak is more

00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:55.895
or less anonymous and perhaps
synonymous with the group as a

00:03:55.895 --> 00:03:57.030
whole.
 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.025
So again the process of
notation allows the composer to

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:04.580
loom larger.
 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.360
And secondly there's another
advantage of notation.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.378
It allows us to preserve the
work of art.

00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:12.890
We can kind of freeze dry this
thing and store it and then

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.649
bring it back to life more or
less exactly as the composer had

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:17.449
intended.
 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.490
But this, if you stop and think
about it, takes the traditional

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.879
balance of things and throws it
out of proportion.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.694
In our art music,
our symphonies,

00:04:27.694 --> 00:04:33.059
concertos, genres of this sort,
the performer is actually much

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:34.730
less important.
 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.220
Let's think of this as
architect and carpenter.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.209
The great architect,
the thinker,

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:42.509
is the composer and the
performer,

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.064
the violinist,
gets this piece of--gets this

00:04:45.064 --> 00:04:48.747
blueprint or black print in the
case of musical notation and is

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.660
expected simply to replicate the
black print.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.117
Well, that's very different
than what happens in other kinds

00:04:56.117 --> 00:04:56.949
of music.
 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.555
Let's talk about pop music for
a second: jazz,

00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:04.000
rock, hip-hop,
blues, that kind of thing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.778
You go over to Toad's Place and
you see the band come out and

00:05:06.778 --> 00:05:09.420
the first thing they do is plunk
this in front of them?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.170
No. That'd be ridiculous.
 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.387
How many of you--I was walking
with a student over to my office

00:05:14.387 --> 00:05:17.399
after lecture the other day to
get some material to him.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:20.865
How many of you play in a rock
band or have ever played in a

00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:21.569
rock band?
 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.459
Okay, a number of you.
 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:28.079
Young lady out there,
did you use musical notation?

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:28.333
No.
 

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:30.694
That would be kind of silly.
 

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:31.370
Right?
 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.670
It's--Okay.
 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.430
So how is it done?
 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.865
Well, it's all done aurally and
we'll talk a little bit more

00:05:37.865 --> 00:05:39.970
about that as we go along.
 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.559
So the composer in the West is
very important,

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.610
more important than the
composer in other cultures.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.500
Other cultures don't use this
type of prescriptive notation.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.649
Here's a thought for you.
 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:55.319
Musical notation was the first
graph in Western culture.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.526
"How could that be?"
 

00:05:56.526 --> 00:05:56.970
you'd say.
 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.449
How could that be?
 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.012
Well, if you go back to the
formation of musical notation

00:06:00.012 --> 00:06:02.209
from the ninth through the
twelfth centuries,

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:06.689
we see that very early on these
two dimensions of music,

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.490
the two axes of music that we
talked about before,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.009
pitch vertically and duration
horizontally,

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.569
are in place and we have these
spots in this grid.

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.149
So musical notation:
the first grid pattern in

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:23.408
Western culture--
but it does lock us in in

00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:28.557
interesting ways that we may--
you perhaps have never

00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:35.370
considered--compared to how
music is made in other cultures.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.089
Let's see how some music is
made in other cultures.

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:43.300
We're going to play here now as
our first excerpt an Adhan,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.639
and what this is is the Islamic
call to worship which is sung

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.000
across the world thousands of
times every day,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.466
and as we listen to this I want
you to think about the vocal

00:06:57.466 --> 00:06:58.829
production here.
 

00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:02.230
What's interesting are all of
the vocal nuances,

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.629
so let's listen to just a bit
of this please.

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:57.839
&gt;
 

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:58.850
Let's stop there.
 

00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.569
Fascinating.
 

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:02.603
What a wonderful sound,
but the beauty of it is all

00:08:02.603 --> 00:08:04.970
between what we would call the
notes.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.952
We would specify a precise
frequency here,

00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:09.226
another one up here,
but what that gentleman was

00:08:09.226 --> 00:08:11.209
singing was all the stuff in
between.

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:14.120
That made it very beautiful,
and there's no way in God's

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.187
earth that we could replicate
that to the Western system of

00:08:17.187 --> 00:08:18.300
musical notation.
 

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.019
Let's take another example.
 

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:22.956
We're going to go to the realm
of Western jazz here and I'm

00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:24.680
going to pick on Chuck Mangione.
 

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.910
Anybody ever heard of Chuck
Mangione?

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.089
Yeah. Okay.
 

00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:29.279
Brian, our tech guy, has.
 

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:30.569
He's an older fellow.
 

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:34.783
He's sort of my age,
and the reason I mention Chuck

00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:39.418
Mangione is that years ago I
went to school with him.

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:41.529
He was a couple of classes
ahead of me at the Eastman

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:42.259
School of Music.
 

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:43.600
I was a fledgling pianist.
 

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.240
He was a very good trumpeter.
 

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.580
Indeed, he was winning Grammys
when he was in his twenties and

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.754
has been recording sort of
esoteric jazz and sometimes more

00:08:51.754 --> 00:08:53.070
pop jazz thereafter.
 

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.210
Now you can go to a Mangione
concert.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.912
He will sometimes play the
Shubert Theater there and

00:08:59.912 --> 00:09:02.350
they'll have two hours of
spectacular jazz,

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.322
but what you won't see,
again, is any sort of music in

00:09:05.322 --> 00:09:06.220
front of them.
 

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.921
So how do these musicians
generate two hours of music with

00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:11.740
no music in front of them?
 

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.870
Does this mean he doesn't read
music?

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.600
Of course not.
 

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.677
You can't get through these
conservatories like Eastman or

00:09:17.677 --> 00:09:20.756
Juilliard or Curtis without
being introduced to an intense

00:09:20.756 --> 00:09:25.480
regimen of musical notation,
but it would get in the way of

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.558
the music.
 

00:09:26.558 --> 00:09:30.408
So let's listen to a track
here, a sax solo,

00:09:30.408 --> 00:09:34.700
and I am going to try to
keep--make some sense out of

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.578
this--
because it gets more and more

00:09:36.578 --> 00:09:38.659
complex--
by following the electric bass

00:09:38.659 --> 00:09:41.038
underneath so let's listen to an
old tape.

00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.840
I used to go to bars in
Rochester and listen to this guy

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.908
and tape his stuff.
 

00:09:44.908 --> 00:09:49.744
So here's Chuck Mangione with
his saxophonist and a saxophone

00:09:49.744 --> 00:09:50.549
cadenza.
 

00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:54.690
It's a wild riff for saxophone.
 

00:09:54.690 --> 00:11:00.409
&gt;
 

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:01.669
That's probably enough.
 

00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:03.330
It gives you an idea.
 

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.570
Now how in the world would you
ever notate that?

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.908
To produce this as a
pre-scripted document that

00:11:08.908 --> 00:11:10.940
anybody else could follow?
 

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.990
It was all improvisatory.
 

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.107
If they tried to notate it,
again, it would take all the

00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:17.659
spirit out, all the heart out of
the music.

00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:18.590
Well, how do they do that?
 

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.077
How do these performers play
such long spans of music without

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:22.950
any notation?
 

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.070
Is it all memorized?
 

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.379
Well, it's not memorized as we
think of it,

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:28.491
and you may have had music
lessons along the way and your

00:11:28.491 --> 00:11:30.460
teacher and your mother said,
"Go memorize your

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:30.909
piece."
 

00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:32.240
It's not memorized like that.
 

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.970
There are certain basic
patterns that they have.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.480
They might say for that sort of
music:, "All right.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.399
We're now going to have a
thirty-two-bar solo.

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.908
We'll be in the key of E-flat.
 

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:43.121
We're going to work through a
one, six, four,

00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:46.038
five, one chord progression
as--We'll come back to that.

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:49.557
We'll sit on the dominant chord
for eight beats and I (Chuck)

00:11:49.557 --> 00:11:52.899
will look over and everybody
else will come back in at the

00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:54.658
end of Chris's solo."
 

00:11:54.658 --> 00:11:58.376
It would be that kind of thing,
kind of head charts,

00:11:58.376 --> 00:12:01.583
general plans,
and within that general plan a

00:12:01.583 --> 00:12:03.990
lot of freedom of expression.
 

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.129
So having said that about
musical notation--

00:12:08.129 --> 00:12:11.308
something about a cautionary
tale about musical notation--

00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:15.201
we should think about how it
affects the way we compose music

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:18.509
in the West and how we perform
music in the West.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:24.075
When you go to a concert of
classical music and the music is

00:12:24.075 --> 00:12:28.320
played and you start to talk,
what happens?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.519
Somebody will go,
"Shh."

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:32.570
Right?
 

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.659
We go to these concerts and we
have to be so quiet.

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:39.279
Why do we have to be quiet?
 

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:41.450
That doesn't sound like much
fun.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.730
Why do we have to be so quiet?
 

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.428
It's because we have these
performers up there that are

00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:49.029
reading this blueprint and
everyone is listening,

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:52.960
basically, to see how
accurately they can reproduce,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.840
revivify, this artistic
artifact.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.639
So that's sort of what's going
on, but it really does

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:03.408
affect how we behave,
even, in a concert.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:06.215
Now if you go to concerts of
other cultures and they are

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:08.839
engaged in their own classical,
not just popular,

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:11.602
but classical music,
Indonesian gamelan music for

00:13:11.602 --> 00:13:13.519
example,
the audience will be there

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:17.092
swaying back and forth,
clapping, applauding with the

00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:20.399
performance with particularly
good solo,

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.690
the same thing with Indian
sitar music,

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.538
that classical tradition.
 

00:13:24.538 --> 00:13:27.957
Oddly, it's much more like
going to a jazz concert where

00:13:27.957 --> 00:13:31.686
the audience is sitting maybe
around tables or something like

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:35.538
that and encouraging and
interacting with the performers,

00:13:35.538 --> 00:13:37.851
but again in those cultures no
notation.

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:41.230
, everybody sits there sort of
mummified, waiting for this

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.779
great work of art to come back
to life.

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.279
It's an interesting thing.
 

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:50.158
And isn't it typical of us in
the West to take something,

00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:54.360
music, which is expression and
feeling and motion and movement,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.571
a response to sound,
and turn it into complex

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:02.235
patterns,
complex patterns that can be

00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:05.919
visualized and rearranged and
analyzed,

00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:08.620
and nowadays even digitalized.
 

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.918
What we've done is take this
spontaneous response to the

00:14:13.918 --> 00:14:18.543
creation of sound,
and bodily movement with sound

00:14:18.543 --> 00:14:20.470
and replaced it.
 

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:26.067
We've replaced the ear and the
heart, the ear and the body,

00:14:26.067 --> 00:14:28.769
with the eye and the mind.
 

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:32.292
Ours a much more visual--it's a
much more analytical--type of

00:14:32.292 --> 00:14:35.168
approach to music and it has its
pros and cons.

00:14:35.168 --> 00:14:39.625
We get great Mahler symphonies
yet we have everybody sitting

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:42.419
there rock-still at these
concerts.

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:43.200
Okay.
 

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.764
Having said that and pointing
out the advantages and

00:14:46.764 --> 00:14:50.331
disadvantages of notation,
let's plunge in then to a

00:14:50.331 --> 00:14:51.798
discussion of it.
 

00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:54.898
I've put on the board up here
the following and we're going to

00:14:54.898 --> 00:14:55.610
review this.
 

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.610
It's simply material found on
page fifteen of your textbook

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.129
but let's review it.
 

00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:04.631
We say this is a beginning
course so we assume no previous

00:15:04.631 --> 00:15:05.370
knowledge.
 

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.303
If you've read through that
material, and you should have

00:15:08.303 --> 00:15:11.028
read through it by now,
you know that we have a value

00:15:11.028 --> 00:15:11.710
in music.
 

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.269
It's called the whole note.
 

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:15.759
What the whole note is,
what all these symbols are,

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:19.875
are simply representations of
duration so we have a symbolic

00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:24.269
language here that's going to
represent the horizontal axis,

00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:26.269
the axis of duration.
 

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:29.970
And this whole note obviously
can be subdivided into two half

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.610
notes and each of the half notes
into two quarter notes,

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.960
each of these quarter notes
into two eighth notes,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.950
and so on.
 

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:42.947
So these are symbols telling us
how long a particular frequency

00:15:42.947 --> 00:15:44.399
is to endure.
 

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:48.515
Similarly, just as we have
symbols for the presence of

00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:52.477
sound and its length,
we have symbols that represent

00:15:52.477 --> 00:15:54.419
the absence of sound.
 

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:56.769
We call those of course, what?
 

00:15:56.769 --> 00:15:58.409
Rests. Okay.
 

00:15:58.409 --> 00:15:59.500
So we're resting over here.
 

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.590
We're not making any music.
 

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:06.158
So we have the notes and their
values and the rests.

00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:11.440
Notice that they're all pretty
much duple in their divisions.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.149
Now here's a question for
you--all duple divisions.

00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:19.600
How do we make--How do we get
triple arrangements in music?

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.970
How do we do that?
 

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.340
Well, we take our basic note
and what do we do to it?

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.019
I bet--I'm sure some of you
know this.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.379
How can we get a half note that
actually equals now three

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:31.340
quarter notes?
 

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.169
What do we do?
 

00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:33.379
Gentleman here.
 

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:34.450
Add a dot.
 

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:40.330
What does that do to this value
specifically in terms of ratios?

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.138
It adds--Okay.
 

00:16:41.138 --> 00:16:44.658
It adds fifty percent or a half
to that and that means instead

00:16:44.658 --> 00:16:47.428
of two quarter notes that we now
have three,

00:16:47.428 --> 00:16:50.534
and we can do the same thing to
any one of these other values

00:16:50.534 --> 00:16:52.827
here,
and that's how we get our

00:16:52.827 --> 00:16:54.480
triple relationships.
 

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.110
Okay?
 

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.072
So those are the basic note
values normally with a duple

00:16:59.072 --> 00:17:03.395
division but we can superimpose
triple by using a dot and the

00:17:03.395 --> 00:17:04.910
absence of sound.
 

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:10.258
Now let's talk for a moment
about the idea of pulse in music

00:17:10.258 --> 00:17:14.700
and the beat in the music and
rhythms in music.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.176
We all know that there is this
thing in music called

00:17:17.176 --> 00:17:19.412
"beat"
and to the extent that popular

00:17:19.412 --> 00:17:21.548
music is more interesting and
that you--

00:17:21.548 --> 00:17:24.570
everybody likes it and will go
dance to it is because it's

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:27.751
really foregrounding beat and
rhythm in an important way that

00:17:27.751 --> 00:17:29.288
classical music does not.
 

00:17:29.288 --> 00:17:33.430
So I've put this idea of the
beat up on the board here.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.250
It's really just a pulse.
 

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.450
It's very much like the human
pulse.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.748
This is the pulse of music,
and music theorists ever since

00:17:40.748 --> 00:17:44.336
the late fifteenth century from
music theory Francinus Gafurius

00:17:44.336 --> 00:17:46.125
on--
we could go all the way back

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:48.869
then--have said that the pulse
in music is basically at the

00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:52.191
same tempo as the human pulse,
which comes out to be about oh,

00:17:52.191 --> 00:17:54.509
we'll say seventy-two beats if
you will,

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:57.048
pulses, per minute.
 

00:17:57.048 --> 00:18:01.315
So we have this pulse,
and it's just kind of out there

00:18:01.315 --> 00:18:04.292
streaming, beat,
&gt;

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.190
, but we don't like
undifferentiated,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.410
disorganized material in the
West.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:15.210
Our psyche says we've got to
bring rational organization to

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:15.789
this.
 

00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:17.000
Ever think about this?
 

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.298
Why do we have this periodicity
when you take history courses?

00:18:21.298 --> 00:18:24.266
Why do we have the Renaissance,
the baroque period,

00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:27.470
the classical period,
the romantic period and so on?

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.178
We have it in music.
 

00:18:28.178 --> 00:18:28.957
We have it in history.
 

00:18:28.957 --> 00:18:30.019
We have it in the fine arts.
 

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:32.048
Why do we have it?
 

00:18:32.048 --> 00:18:36.105
It's simply a convention
established after the fact that

00:18:36.105 --> 00:18:40.679
allows us to organize material
in ways that we can grapple with

00:18:40.679 --> 00:18:42.930
it,
ways that we can understand it.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.095
So in music what has happened
is that we have organized this

00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:51.049
steady stream of beats in ways
that we can understand.

00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:52.420
We organize them.
 

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.383
We subdivide these into units
of two, for example,

00:18:56.383 --> 00:19:00.750
groups of two like this,
or we have an undifferentiated

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.450
stream like this.
 

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.143
I am convinced--even though I'm
sure that the Toyota Motor

00:19:06.143 --> 00:19:08.670
Company didn't organize it this
way--

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.327
I am convinced that on my
automobile when I do not plug in

00:19:13.327 --> 00:19:17.170
my safety belt that there is a
bell ringing,

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.827
"DING, ding,
ding, DING, ding,

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.608
ding."
 

00:19:23.608 --> 00:19:25.750
I don't think they were
thinking of that in terms of

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.380
triple meter.
 

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.598
I think they were just a
succession of dings,

00:19:29.598 --> 00:19:33.240
but I'm hearing it--my mind
wants to hear this organization,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.808
so there's another organization
here of units of three.

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:39.181
As you may know,
there's yet another

00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:43.180
organization where we could
group this in units of four,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.221
but for all intents and
purposes--there are a few

00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:50.414
nuances to it--
four is simply a multiplication

00:19:50.414 --> 00:19:51.220
of two.
 

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.355
So in our course we are only
going to have two types of

00:19:56.355 --> 00:19:58.828
meter, duple and triple.
 

00:19:58.828 --> 00:20:02.130
These organizations,
taking the beat and organizing

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.638
it into groups,
is called superimposing

00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:06.618
meter on the music.
 

00:20:06.618 --> 00:20:11.150
Then we want to indicate that
meter to the performer.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.160
It's a way to tell the
performer how this music is to

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.240
be executed.
 

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.338
So what do we do?
 

00:20:17.338 --> 00:20:21.644
Well, in music the most basic
symbol for the beat is the

00:20:21.644 --> 00:20:22.818
quarter note.
 

00:20:22.818 --> 00:20:25.299
The quarter note usually
carries the beat.

00:20:25.299 --> 00:20:26.220
Okay.
 

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.548
So here we have a series of
groups of two quarter notes.

00:20:31.548 --> 00:20:35.296
We have the convention of music
of writing this symbol

00:20:35.296 --> 00:20:39.326
indicating the beat-carrying
unit of four so I'm writing a

00:20:39.326 --> 00:20:41.730
four underneath each of these.
 

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.457
Then I look up here and say,
"Well, in this duple

00:20:44.457 --> 00:20:47.029
pattern I have two of these
quarter notes."

00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:48.430
So I'm going to write a two out
there.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:54.469
That (4) tells a performer that
the quarter note is carrying the

00:20:54.469 --> 00:20:55.140
beat.
 

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.368
And the 2 says that there'll be
two in each of your units.

00:20:58.368 --> 00:21:01.308
These units we call bars or
measures,

00:21:01.308 --> 00:21:04.230
and just to finish this off
down here,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.089
we would have three quarter
notes, of course,

00:21:07.089 --> 00:21:10.509
in this particular arrangement.
 

00:21:10.509 --> 00:21:11.670
Okay.
 

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:16.909
Now ultimately what happens
with this is that we begin to

00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:22.430
take this stream and organize it
into different patterns.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.449
I can go &gt;
 

00:21:25.449 --> 00:21:30.077
, something like this,
and we would call that a

00:21:30.077 --> 00:21:35.915
rhythm, superimposing longs and
shorts, different patterns,

00:21:35.915 --> 00:21:39.640
patterns that oftentimes
repeat.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.348
The dividing up of this stream
into different patterns,

00:21:44.348 --> 00:21:46.750
often repeating,
of longs and short,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:52.736
is superimposing rhythm over
top of this basic beat which is

00:21:52.736 --> 00:21:56.490
organized in terms of these
meters.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.259
So are there questions about
that?

00:21:58.259 --> 00:22:00.660
Did that seem straightforward
enough?

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.000
Now as you may know--some of
you may have played clarinet in

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.548
a high school band or something
like that,

00:22:06.548 --> 00:22:09.028
neither here nor there if you
did or did not--

00:22:09.028 --> 00:22:13.240
but you may know that there are
other meters out there,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.710
these things called six-eight
(and nine-eight).

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:24.380
I was thinking this morning
&gt;

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.054
four, five, six,
one, two, three,

00:22:26.054 --> 00:22:27.519
four, five, six,
one, two.

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:30.355
Well, that's a beat of
basically a duple meter with a

00:22:30.355 --> 00:22:32.807
triple subdivision,
but we're not getting into

00:22:32.807 --> 00:22:34.390
triple subdivisions here.
 

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.444
In our course the beat is
always going to be a--divided,

00:22:37.444 --> 00:22:40.222
to the extent that it's
divided--always going to be

00:22:40.222 --> 00:22:41.390
divided into two.
 

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.007
We have only so-called simple
meters rather than compound

00:22:46.007 --> 00:22:46.750
meters.
 

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.999
If you want to learn about
compound meters,

00:22:48.999 --> 00:22:51.410
go take music 210 and become a
music major.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.468
That's the kind of thing that
they get into but we're not

00:22:53.468 --> 00:22:54.130
doing that here.
 

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.147
We're interested only really in
two things: One,

00:22:57.147 --> 00:23:00.680
can you differentiate between
duple and triple meter;

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.680
and two, can you recognize some
very basic rhythmic patterns?

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.589
And we'll be doing some of that
today.

00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:09.430
Questions again?
 

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.890
Okay.
 

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:20.690
 
 

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.200
Let me play some music at the
piano.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.539
This is Bulldog.
 

00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:25.130
Isn't this the Yale fight song?
 

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.019
Who wrote this?
 

00:23:27.019 --> 00:23:28.568
Anybody know?
 

00:23:28.568 --> 00:23:31.848
You've probably heard it eight
zillion times at football games.

00:23:31.848 --> 00:23:35.442
It's great--What a wonderful
fight song--Yale was so lucky to

00:23:35.442 --> 00:23:36.338
have this as.
 

00:23:36.338 --> 00:23:39.359
So yes, I think I hear somebody
out there.

00:23:39.359 --> 00:23:40.299
Student: Cole Porter.
 

00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:41.470
Prof: Cole Porter.
 

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.803
Who was Cole Porter,
as I glance through my music

00:23:44.803 --> 00:23:45.289
here?
 

00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:48.099
Oh, phooey. I've lost it.
 

00:23:48.099 --> 00:23:50.470
Who was Cole Porter?
 

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.785
He was a Yale graduate,
class of 1914,

00:23:53.785 --> 00:23:58.086
and unfortunately I seem to
have misplaced--Well,

00:23:58.086 --> 00:24:01.940
I can generate a little bit of
it here.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:31.829
&gt;
 

00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:33.150
Okay.
 

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.396
I was sort of trying to
remember the first page of the

00:24:35.396 --> 00:24:36.328
missing music there.
 

00:24:36.328 --> 00:24:39.000
So is this in duple meter or
triple meter?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.710
&gt;
 

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.929
Huh?
 

00:24:44.929 --> 00:24:47.230
What do you think and how do we
find out?

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.329
Tap your foot.
 

00:24:49.329 --> 00:24:51.069
Did we find any music?
 

00:24:51.069 --> 00:24:52.690
&gt;
 

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.049
Ah, thank you.
 

00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:57.069
Enlightenment from Lynda.
 

00:24:57.069 --> 00:25:05.230
&gt;
 

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.990
What-- What's the key here?
 

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.910
What do you listen to?
 

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.309
How many think it's in duple
meter?

00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:11.250
Raise your hand.
 

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.440
How many think it's in triple
meter?

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.250
Okay.
 

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.538
Almost everybody thinks it's in
duple meter and that's correct.

00:25:16.538 --> 00:25:19.140
Now we worked through this just
a little bit once before.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.490
What is it that tells us that
it's in duple meter?

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.338
It's the bass &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:25:26.338 --> 00:25:30.528
because it's organizing itself
very strongly in duple patterns.

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:32.599
There's one other interesting
thing in here.

00:25:32.599 --> 00:25:33.140
This would be?
 

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.430
Well, let's think through this
in one additional way,

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:40.598
and that is--notice that in
duple meter we have a strong

00:25:40.598 --> 00:25:42.720
beat,
right, "strong, weak,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.192
strong, weak,
strong, weak,

00:25:44.192 --> 00:25:46.683
strong weak"
in that sense or if we have

00:25:46.683 --> 00:25:50.084
triple it would be "strong,
weak, weak, strong,

00:25:50.084 --> 00:25:51.318
weak, weak."
 

00:25:51.318 --> 00:25:55.367
There would be two weak beats
or two unstressed beats between

00:25:55.367 --> 00:25:56.650
each strong beat.
 

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:10.410
We could do this &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.720
and we'd have the "Waltz
of the Bulldog."

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.952
It'd be pretty cool
&gt;

00:26:13.952 --> 00:26:14.470
to see actually.
 

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.788
So there it's--I'm simply
taking the Cole Porter piece and

00:26:17.788 --> 00:26:20.410
throwing in an extra beat in
each measure,

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.970
an unstressed beat in each
measure,

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.328
and it works out pretty well.
 

00:26:24.328 --> 00:26:27.715
Notice--this would be--Harvard
would have had a field day with

00:26:27.715 --> 00:26:30.880
this melody if he--Cole
Porter--had not done one thing.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.557
He makes this really rather
snappy by the use of this kind

00:26:35.557 --> 00:26:36.460
of stuff.
 

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.118
&gt;
 

00:26:39.118 --> 00:26:41.440
We'll come in on
&gt;

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.400
and then it's
&gt;.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.829
What's that a good example of?
 

00:26:47.829 --> 00:26:49.890
Syncopation, yeah.
 

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.944
The term is on the board,
and it's a good example of

00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:53.528
syncopation,
sort of jumping in ahead of

00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:56.337
time, cutting off the beat,
getting in there ahead of time

00:26:56.337 --> 00:26:59.855
and throwing off the metrical
balance for a very short period

00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:00.500
of time.
 

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.150
Okay.
 

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:07.054
So that's a duple meter piece
and what we're trying to do here

00:27:07.054 --> 00:27:11.877
is just hear if we've got one
strong and one weak beat or one

00:27:11.877 --> 00:27:14.288
strong and two weak beats.
 

00:27:14.288 --> 00:27:16.960
How do we--How should we do
this?

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.990
How are you going to do this?
 

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:22.019
Well, I think one thing that's
very helpful is for you to start

00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:25.269
to move, to move around,
to sway, tap your foot.

00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:27.630
Now we can't do this during a
test in here.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.170
It'd be a little bit annoying
but we really have--we really do

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:30.920
have to do this.
 

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.337
Now musicians,
being a bit more uptight

00:27:33.337 --> 00:27:36.018
oftentimes,
classical musicians,

00:27:36.018 --> 00:27:40.846
than other more spirited folks,
have developed this tradition

00:27:40.846 --> 00:27:42.789
of using conducting patterns.
 

00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:43.450
Right?
 

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:47.077
So for duple meter we just go
down, up, down,

00:27:47.077 --> 00:27:47.490
up.
 

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.390
It's kind of--maybe a little
shape over to the right,

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.900
down, up, down,
up, that kind of thing,

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.670
and for triple we do down,
over, up,

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.259
down, over, up, down, over, up.
 

00:27:59.259 --> 00:27:59.650
Okay?
 

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.183
So I'm going to start playing
here and you are going to start

00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:03.950
conducting.
 

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.828
You're going to listen just for
a second and then you're going

00:28:06.828 --> 00:28:09.849
to move and you're going to move
using the conducting pattern.

00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:21.410
&gt;
 

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.798
Okay. Good.
 

00:28:22.798 --> 00:28:26.575
Now I see some of you out there
from--like this,

00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:31.074
not really participating,
and if I can get up here--Think

00:28:31.074 --> 00:28:32.278
about this.
 

00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:32.694
I'm old.
 

00:28:32.694 --> 00:28:35.970
I'm sort of used to thinking of
myself a "White Anglo-Saxon

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.009
Protestant."
 

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:39.210
I have every reason in the
world to be repressed.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:39.358
Right?
 

00:28:39.358 --> 00:28:39.960
&gt;
 

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.808
I could--
&gt;

00:28:40.808 --> 00:28:44.277
This--So if I could be up here
making a fool of myself on a

00:28:44.277 --> 00:28:47.744
daily basis, you guys are much
younger than I and known for

00:28:47.744 --> 00:28:49.240
outrageous behaviors.
 

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.779
You can certainly get in here
and move and flow and go with

00:28:51.779 --> 00:28:52.480
the beat here.
 

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.941
So here we go.
 

00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:53.599
Everybody together.
 

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:55.609
&gt;
 

00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:56.509
Much better.
 

00:28:56.509 --> 00:29:06.150
 
 

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.700
Okay. I'm watching-- Good.
 

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.480
Virtually everyone has got the
downbeat here.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.390
You're not going
&gt;.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.315
You're
going&gt;

00:29:17.315 --> 00:29:20.625
, so there is a sense of
downbeat and we'll come back to

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.190
that in just a moment.
 

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.000
Let's do a triple meter one.
 

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.579
Here we go.
 

00:29:24.579 --> 00:29:34.269
&gt;
 

00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:35.660
Good.
 

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:46.670
 
 

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.588
Excellent. Very good.
 

00:29:48.588 --> 00:29:52.329
Now I'm going to modulate,
&gt;

00:29:52.329 --> 00:29:54.779
go to a different key.
 

00:29:54.779 --> 00:30:01.559
&gt;
 

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:03.539
Can you conduct this?
 

00:30:03.539 --> 00:30:11.500
 
 

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:11.780
Okay.
 

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.390
There's a little confusion here
so let's try to do it together.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.410
Are you ready?
 

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:23.400
&gt;
 

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:23.634
Okay.
 

00:30:23.634 --> 00:30:26.542
Now this gentleman out here is
actually doing it different from

00:30:26.542 --> 00:30:28.701
what I am doing and what most of
you are doing,

00:30:28.701 --> 00:30:29.779
but you know what?
 

00:30:29.779 --> 00:30:31.099
He's doing it correctly.
 

00:30:31.099 --> 00:30:33.150
We're doing it incorrectly.
 

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:41.750
&gt;
 

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.150
What's wrong here?
 

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:48.876
We're off because our
downbeats, our strong pulses,

00:30:48.876 --> 00:30:53.415
always have to come on the
first part of the bar,

00:30:53.415 --> 00:30:54.740
this note.
 

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.900
The first part of the bar is
called the downbeat.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.653
It's the most important thing
and our conducting pattern

00:31:00.653 --> 00:31:04.682
always has to have the downbeat
of the hand in sync with the

00:31:04.682 --> 00:31:08.328
strongest impulse in the music,
the strong.

00:31:08.328 --> 00:31:11.265
The downbeat in the music comes
with the down motion of the

00:31:11.265 --> 00:31:11.618
hand.
 

00:31:11.618 --> 00:31:14.480
So we were getting
&gt;.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.788
Oh, there's the downbeat,
&gt;

00:31:16.788 --> 00:31:20.758
but we were putting that on
two, &gt;

00:31:20.758 --> 00:31:22.779
, and we don't want that.
 

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:25.329
We want &gt;
 

00:31:25.329 --> 00:31:25.890
at that point.
 

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.480
So what do we have here?
 

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.490
What's happening?
 

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.670
Well, there's a little bit of
music before the downbeat.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.900
That's called a pick-up.
 

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.288
Okay?
 

00:31:34.288 --> 00:31:36.690
So we have a little pick-up,
&gt;.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.750
I was thinking of a diver in
the Olympics.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.872
They go out there--They do
these little steps just before

00:31:42.872 --> 00:31:46.553
they spring off of the board,
&gt;

00:31:46.553 --> 00:31:50.233
, kind of gets you,
really landing good and hard on

00:31:50.233 --> 00:31:54.242
that downbeat,
so the downbeat is very

00:31:54.242 --> 00:32:00.240
important to us and we could
conclude this by saying that

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.308
although all music has a
downbeat,

00:32:04.308 --> 00:32:07.470
not all music starts with a
downbeat.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.788
Sometimes when listening to
music you have to wait.

00:32:09.788 --> 00:32:14.395
Listen for a while and your
body almost will start to tell

00:32:14.395 --> 00:32:18.680
you, start to signal to you,
where the downbeat is.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.369
Is it really your body that
will signal this to you?

00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:22.380
I doubt it.
 

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.567
It's your brain up here
processing all of this

00:32:25.567 --> 00:32:26.558
information.
 

00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:29.778
We talked about the auditory
cortex the first section and

00:32:29.778 --> 00:32:33.285
maybe there are other parts of
the brain that are factoring in

00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:36.544
here as well,
but how is it that composers

00:32:36.544 --> 00:32:40.605
send this information to,
let's say, our auditory cortex

00:32:40.605 --> 00:32:40.990
here?
 

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.288
How do they do that?
 

00:32:42.288 --> 00:32:46.623
Well, there are four principal
ways that composers signal to us

00:32:46.623 --> 00:32:49.069
the whereabouts of the down
beat.

00:32:49.069 --> 00:32:49.848
Okay?
 

00:32:49.848 --> 00:32:55.359
So let's review--let's focus on
that just for a moment.

00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:57.930
Okay.
 

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:08.230
Way number one:
That has to do with duration.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:11.630
Notes are simply longer,
held longer.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.170
That's how we have the sense of
where the down beat is.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:46.259
&gt;
 

00:33:46.259 --> 00:33:48.470
You have old Amazin' Grace--I
guess it's a spiritual,

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.809
right?
 

00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:50.950
Beautiful. It's beautiful.
 

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.009
But think about that.
 

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:57.307
&gt;
 

00:33:57.307 --> 00:34:04.368
&gt;
 

00:34:04.368 --> 00:34:07.917
And all of those long notes are
coming on the downbeat so that's

00:34:07.917 --> 00:34:10.340
how we start to hear that as a
downbeat,

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.226
and that's how we know to make
our hand go down at that point

00:34:13.226 --> 00:34:14.190
so that's one way.
 

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.539
Now another way is through
accent,

00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:20.760
and to exemplify this let's
turn to some classical music,

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.791
the music of Mozart,
so here we have Mozart's

00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:26.815
Fortieth Symphony,
his famous G Minor Symphony,

00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:29.630
and we're going to go ahead and
start to play it.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:36.190
 
 

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:57.420
&gt;
 

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.530
Okay. Good.
 

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.199
Several of you were actually
conducting this.

00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:01.269
That's great.
 

00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:01.940
Okay.
 

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.400
This happens to be in duple
meter and that's fine.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.722
That wasn't the question here
but great, you're hearing that

00:35:07.722 --> 00:35:08.849
and I'm delighted.
 

00:35:08.849 --> 00:35:12.021
What Mozart has done here--If
we could get the score up here

00:35:12.021 --> 00:35:15.233
of Mozart's music--
we would see that he has put a

00:35:15.233 --> 00:35:20.820
little arrow over top of--
a wedge--over top of each of

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:26.518
the down beats &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:26.518 --> 00:35:29.315
so that the string player will
really accent those,

00:35:29.315 --> 00:35:32.389
but the string player would be
accenting them anyway.

00:35:32.389 --> 00:35:33.110
Why?
 

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.170
Any violinists in here or
anybody who ever played a string

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.869
instrument?
 

00:35:36.869 --> 00:35:38.550
What are you always told to do?
 

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.460
If you are playing a downbeat
with an up-bow,

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.050
are you in good shape?
 

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.449
No, no, no, no.
 

00:35:44.449 --> 00:35:46.230
Your teacher would not be happy
with that.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.480
Your bowing pattern is probably
backward at that point.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.835
String players are taught,
whether it's cellists going

00:35:51.835 --> 00:35:54.391
this way,
downbeat, or violas and

00:35:54.391 --> 00:35:58.853
violinists coming down this way,
that the downward motion of the

00:35:58.853 --> 00:36:01.699
hand or the pull across,
the strong pull across,

00:36:01.699 --> 00:36:05.360
should come with the downbeat;
that emphasizes the downbeat.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.860
That's how we know the downbeat.
 

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.119
So so far we've had duration
and accent.

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:11.309
Mozart is actually writing
accent into this.

00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:15.219
The third way that we--that
composers signal to us,

00:36:15.219 --> 00:36:19.922
that we pick up almost
intuitively the whereabouts of

00:36:19.922 --> 00:36:22.628
downbeats,
is through patterns of

00:36:22.628 --> 00:36:23.670
accompaniment.
 

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.440
We'll call it range.
 

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:25.885
Okay.
 

00:36:25.885 --> 00:36:29.369
So here's a waltz by Richard
Strauss,

00:36:29.369 --> 00:36:32.739
not to be confused--no,
excuse me, by Johann Strauss,

00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:35.590
not to be confused with Richard
Strauss whom we heard last time.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:48.130
&gt;
 

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:48.739
And so on.
 

00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:51.440
What's important here is the
left hand.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.429
&gt;
 

00:36:55.429 --> 00:36:57.969
That's why we hear a triple
pattern here.

00:36:57.969 --> 00:37:00.900
We're hearing two weak beats,
and the strong beat is always

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.480
in the lower position here so
we're getting low,

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.730
middle, middle,
&gt;

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.068
low, middle,
middle, or it could be

00:37:06.068 --> 00:37:08.313
something as we had the other
day in the Tchaikovsky Piano

00:37:08.313 --> 00:37:09.929
Concerto, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:37:09.929 --> 00:37:12.378
low, middle,
high, low, middle,

00:37:12.378 --> 00:37:16.706
high, but each time the
downbeat seems to be coming in

00:37:16.706 --> 00:37:19.809
association with that lowest
note.

00:37:19.809 --> 00:37:23.905
So range or position here in
the accompaniment can oftentimes

00:37:23.905 --> 00:37:26.090
signal this information to us.
 

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:30.559
And finally,
and most important-- these

00:37:30.559 --> 00:37:35.619
others have been pretty
straightforward--

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:39.885
but what has not been
straightforward is something

00:37:39.885 --> 00:37:44.726
that you might listen to many,
many times and not be aware of,

00:37:44.726 --> 00:37:46.440
and that is chord changes.
 

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.860
We have chords in music.
 

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.679
&gt;
 

00:37:54.679 --> 00:37:57.829
They're these building blocks
that support the melody and they

00:37:57.829 --> 00:38:01.030
have to change for that melody
to be consonant all the time.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.900
But where they change
oftentimes is on the downbeat.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.710
Most frequently,
chord changes come on the

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:11.960
downbeat so composers signal to
us in a fourth way the downbeat

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.949
by means of chord change.
 

00:38:13.949 --> 00:38:18.268
Now we're going to play just a
little bit of pop music--

00:38:18.268 --> 00:38:22.460
a bit of pop music here,
and by playing this you might

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:26.018
think that I think that I'm hip
or with it.

00:38:26.018 --> 00:38:27.570
We're going to play some rock
and roll.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.768
Do I look hip or with it?
 

00:38:30.768 --> 00:38:34.347
Hopelessly out of touch with
popular culture and nobody knows

00:38:34.347 --> 00:38:37.260
this better than I,
and to prove this I have chosen

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.739
a piece because there's a little
story with it.

00:38:39.739 --> 00:38:43.242
I like this piece because it
does something and I've used it

00:38:43.242 --> 00:38:46.067
in previous years,
and I put it on and I would

00:38:46.067 --> 00:38:48.244
announce,
"I'm now going to play out

00:38:48.244 --> 00:38:50.264
of the--
It's an album called

00:38:50.264 --> 00:38:54.989
Document by REM ,"
and put it on and REM and it's

00:38:54.989 --> 00:38:56.250
fine with me.
 

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.257
That's what it says,
"REM,"

00:38:57.257 --> 00:38:59.318
on the printout,
and about two years after I was

00:38:59.318 --> 00:39:01.289
doing this a student came up and
said,

00:39:01.289 --> 00:39:02.894
"Professor Wright,
it's really not

00:39:02.894 --> 00:39:03.909
"Rem.""
 

00:39:03.909 --> 00:39:05.090
Oh, it's not?"
 

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:05.376
Okay.
 

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:08.983
So that's how distant I am from
all of this, but let's listen to

00:39:08.983 --> 00:39:10.130
a little of this.
 

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.429
It's in a straightforward four.
 

00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:16.090
Rock really comes forth not so
much in twos but in fours so

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:19.260
we'll call this a 4/4,
and you can beat a four pattern

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.159
to it or you can beat a two
pattern.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:24.472
It doesn't really matter but
notice that whenever the chords

00:39:24.472 --> 00:39:27.000
are changing they're changing on
down beat.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.440
So let's hear a little bit of
this and then we'll stop so they

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.679
don't sue us for copyright
infringement and then we'll go

00:39:31.679 --> 00:39:33.360
somewhere else and take another
chunk.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:40:04.369
&gt;
 

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:05.289
Okay.
 

00:40:05.289 --> 00:40:07.039
So that's all they're doing
there.

00:40:07.039 --> 00:40:14.672
Every time they're changing
your hand is going down,

00:40:14.672 --> 00:40:23.052
so chord changes may be the
most powerful of all of these

00:40:23.052 --> 00:40:28.739
aspects of where the down beat
is.

00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:30.630
Okay.
 

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.657
I had intended to give you just
a little bit of a rhythmic quiz

00:40:33.657 --> 00:40:35.610
but let's just do one of these
things.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.179
Here's something else we have
to do in here.

00:40:37.179 --> 00:40:41.246
We have to hear a rhythm and
recognize it so we have a series

00:40:41.246 --> 00:40:43.619
of rhythms on the board up
there.

00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:50.329
Please choose a rhythm for
excerpt one, you can choose

00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:55.518
rhythm A which is
&gt;

00:40:55.518 --> 00:41:01.489
or you could choose rhythm B,
&gt;.

00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:02.980
So I'm about to play a piece.
 

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.079
It's by Chopin.
 

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:08.730
Which rhythm is in play here?
 

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.130
Which rhythm am I playing?
 

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:11.929
Is it A or is it B?
 

00:41:11.929 --> 00:41:31.329
&gt;
 

00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:32.289
So what do you think?
 

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.480
How many think A?
 

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.949
How many think B?
 

00:41:34.949 --> 00:41:35.309
Okay.
 

00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:39.389
So that's not too challenging.
 

00:41:39.389 --> 00:41:40.260
We'll be doing some of that.
 

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.567
Then &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:43.340
Chopin is sitting here and he
modulates;

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.599
he changes key.
 

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:45.739
What about this?
 

00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:48.019
Is it--This is number two.
 

00:41:48.019 --> 00:41:48.599
Is it A or B?
 

00:41:48.599 --> 00:42:16.360
&gt;
 

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:16.858
Lovely.
 

00:42:16.858 --> 00:42:19.989
Wasn't it lovely,
a little thing by Chopin?

00:42:19.989 --> 00:42:22.958
How long did it take old Chopin
to think that up,

00:42:22.958 --> 00:42:24.010
do you suppose?
 

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.460
Two seconds?
 

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.920
Three seconds of white-hot
inspiration?

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.349
I'm sixty-four years old and I
haven't had one second of genius

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:33.780
in my entire life.
 

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:34.550
&gt;
 

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.230
This is really depressing.
 

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.639
It's discouraging.
 

00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:39.690
I soldier on but it hasn't come
to me.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.679
You are younger and I'm sure
that your moment of genius is

00:42:42.679 --> 00:42:43.309
out there.
 

00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:46.626
It's really the difference
between perseverance,

00:42:46.626 --> 00:42:50.648
in my case, and genius--pure,
unadulterated genius--in the

00:42:50.648 --> 00:42:51.989
case of Chopin.
 

00:42:51.989 --> 00:42:53.090
What a beautiful melody.
 

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.260
In any event,
the answer is what?

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.820
For two, is it A or B?
 

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:05.369
&gt;
 

00:43:05.369 --> 00:43:06.469
What do you think?
 

00:43:06.469 --> 00:43:09.539
A, yeah, so that's his rhythm,
A there.

00:43:09.539 --> 00:43:10.003
All right.
 

00:43:10.003 --> 00:43:12.050
We're going to end with one
final exercise.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.699
It's a fun piece I think.
 

00:43:13.699 --> 00:43:14.699
It's fun to do.
 

00:43:14.699 --> 00:43:18.559
It's a piece by Maurice Ravel
called Bolero.

00:43:18.559 --> 00:43:20.579
It's a unique piece.
 

00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:24.047
Maurice Ravel was a French
composer writing in the early

00:43:24.047 --> 00:43:25.309
twentieth century.
 

00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:29.135
It's a unique piece because
what he does is take some very

00:43:29.135 --> 00:43:32.827
basic patterns and simply
repeats them over and over and

00:43:32.827 --> 00:43:36.652
over again for about fourteen
and a half minutes depending

00:43:36.652 --> 00:43:40.679
upon the tempo that the
conductor is taking the music.

00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:44.349
So let's listen to a little bit
of this music and I want you,

00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:48.090
maybe as a group,
to tap with your foot,

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.579
your hand, whatever,
just the beat as you hear it.

00:43:50.579 --> 00:43:52.110
You don't have to pay any
attention to this.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:56.047
We'll come to this in just a
moment, but just tap and we'll

00:43:56.047 --> 00:43:59.170
all--maybe eventually all
together the beat.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.239
Here we go.
 

00:44:00.239 --> 00:44:40.250
&gt;
 

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:41.639
Most of you are not tapping.
 

00:44:41.639 --> 00:44:44.070
So everybody start tapping
where you think it is.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:48.429
&gt;
 

00:44:48.429 --> 00:44:50.510
Okay. Good.
 

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:54.059
All right.
 

00:44:54.059 --> 00:44:55.469
Gentleman out here in the
orange shirt.

00:44:55.469 --> 00:44:56.860
I'm going to have you be a
conductor.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.179
You were doing really well and
you were conducting correctly

00:45:00.179 --> 00:45:00.800
early on.
 

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.340
So good.
 

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.670
Here's what we got.
 

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:08.630
Most people have
&gt;.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:14.518
Some people are going
&gt;

00:45:14.518 --> 00:45:17.634
and in this course we would
know whether you're hearing

00:45:17.634 --> 00:45:21.150
duple or triple based on some
other information so don't worry

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.920
about if you're doing
&gt;.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.590
That's a little bit fast for a
beat.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.748
What you're doing there is
actually subdividing the beat

00:45:27.748 --> 00:45:29.161
into two, but don't worry about
that.

00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:29.789
That's fine.
 

00:45:29.789 --> 00:45:32.885
You're doing eighth notes and
the rest of us are doing--other

00:45:32.885 --> 00:45:34.590
people are doing quarter notes.
 

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.072
Okay.
 

00:45:35.072 --> 00:45:38.750
So the beat is
&gt;.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:42.030
Now what music have we been
hearing here?

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.530
Santana, where are you?
 

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:44.900
Okay. Come on up here.
 

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.139
Take a look at this.
 

00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:48.329
Lynda, come on over here and
take a look at this.

00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:51.130
We should have rehearsed this
in advance.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:52.119
We did not do this.
 

00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:55.349
These are two ladies that are
very experienced singers.

00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:57.619
I want you to just stand right
up here, please.

00:45:57.619 --> 00:46:00.010
They have not been forewarned
about this!

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.119
Take a look at this.
 

00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:01.699
&gt;
 

00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:02.860
We're going to do it together.
 

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:03.619
Here we go.
 

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:05.300
You're going to sing that top
melody.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.269
One, ready, go.
 

00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:17.320
&gt;
 

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.306
Okay, and we're just going to
keep--It'll be fine,

00:46:20.306 --> 00:46:23.782
and we're just going to keep
going and once you get to the

00:46:23.782 --> 00:46:26.159
end one then we're going to
repeat.

00:46:26.159 --> 00:46:26.659
Okay?
 

00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:27.670
Here we go.
 

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:28.940
Two, sing.
 

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:39.570
&gt;
 

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:40.809
Okay.
 

00:46:40.809 --> 00:46:43.041
So you're going to keep going
over and over and over like

00:46:43.041 --> 00:46:43.320
that.
 

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.099
I'm going to be this thing here.
 

00:46:45.099 --> 00:46:47.449
Let's just go--This is the
percussion.

00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:51.590
&gt;
 

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.750
Okay?
 

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:53.840
There is no pitch to it.
 

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.760
It is just rhythm.
 

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.550
Up here we have melody and
rhythm.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.929
Here we have just rhythm.
 

00:46:59.929 --> 00:47:05.139
Underneath we have
&gt;.

00:47:05.139 --> 00:47:09.282
We have basically harmony,
but it has a simple rhythm to

00:47:09.282 --> 00:47:09.659
it.
 

00:47:09.659 --> 00:47:11.719
It's a rhythm with a couple of
different patterns.

00:47:11.719 --> 00:47:14.019
You, students,
are going to sing this.

00:47:14.019 --> 00:47:14.369
Okay?
 

00:47:14.369 --> 00:47:14.900
So here we go.
 

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.289
Everybody together, ready, sing.
 

00:47:17.289 --> 00:47:27.268
&gt;
 

00:47:27.268 --> 00:47:27.510
Okay.
 

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.487
So here we're going to go--The
gentleman in the orange shirt--I

00:47:30.487 --> 00:47:33.130
hate to do this to you but we've
got thirty seconds.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.199
Stand up.
 

00:47:34.199 --> 00:47:35.045
You were doing a great job.
 

00:47:35.045 --> 00:47:35.829
&gt;
 

00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:38.657
Stand up and you can--That's
fine.

00:47:38.657 --> 00:47:40.199
You can face me.
 

00:47:40.199 --> 00:47:42.873
We'll coordinate it better this
way, and just conduct this in

00:47:42.873 --> 00:47:43.230
three.
 

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.860
I'll start conducting with you
and then you take over.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.039
Here we go, one, ready, go.
 

00:47:49.039 --> 00:47:56.445
&gt;
 

00:47:56.445 --> 00:48:03.030
&gt;
 

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.690
Okay. Great.
 

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:05.699
This is actually terrific.
 

00:48:05.699 --> 00:48:07.989
We're going to take it to
Hoboken and Sheboygan.

00:48:07.989 --> 00:48:10.920
We're going to play across the
world with this group.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.182
Okay.
 

00:48:11.182 --> 00:48:12.710
Thank you very much,
ladies.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:15.570
The point here--final point and
then I'll let you go.

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:18.429
This is a melody with rhythm.
 

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:19.940
This is pure rhythm.
 

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.699
This is a harmony with a very
simple rhythm here.

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:24.760
Who is playing the beat?
 

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.110
I asked you to conduct the beat
or to tap the beat.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.922
Most people--And everybody was
tapping the beat just fine and

00:48:31.922 --> 00:48:35.420
dandy, but notice up here nobody
is playing the beat.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.159
There's nobody up here that's
playing the beat.

00:48:37.159 --> 00:48:41.501
The brain perceives all of this
complex information and it

00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:45.539
processes it and it extrapolates
from it the beat,

00:48:45.539 --> 00:48:47.771
but again nobody in
music--except the bass drum

00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:50.802
player in a marching band--
nobody in music ever does

00:48:50.802 --> 00:48:53.139
anything except just play the
beat.

00:48:53.139 --> 00:48:54.119
Okay.
 

00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:57.139
So I'll see you starting this
evening in sections.

00:48:57.139 --> 00:49:03.000

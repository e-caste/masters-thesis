00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.590
Prof: The dog ate my
homework;

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.050
you guys will understand what
that means.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.190
We're going to have to postpone
the Rapaczynski case.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.772
I got back from Washington late
last night and got to the office

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:18.900
this morning and the SOM server
was down.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
I actually did some of the
filming and visited their

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.740
offices in Warsaw three years
ago, and I would like to divert

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.280
us a little bit today.
 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.393
I want to talk briefly about
what I've been doing in

00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:43.610
Washington and how it relates to
what we've been doing here.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.911
Then you'll remember,
some weeks ago before the

00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:52.121
midterm,
we had a soft schedule to do

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:58.027
the Mory's Business Plan,
and I brought with me today two

00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:03.703
distinguished colleagues who are
going to help us to understand

00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:07.640
the Mory's business plan as a
challenge.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.049
Chris Getman,
immediately to my right is the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.849
president of the Mory's Board of
Governors and an iconic figure

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.360
at Yale.
 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.730
He has been the owner of how
many Dapper Dan's?

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.170
Chris Getman:
 Handsome Dan's.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.750
Prof: Handsome Dan's,
pardon me.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.989
Four, including the incumbent.
 

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:34.709
Chris Getman:
 Including the incumbent.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.985
Prof: Jonathan Ingham,
now immediately to my right,

00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:42.735
is a former president of the
Yale Club of New York,

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:46.730
Yale College Class of 1964--
Jonathan Ingham:  1965.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.577
Prof: 1965,
and has been one of the

00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:53.120
instrumental players in the
Mory's business plan.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.110
Before I get to that I want to
talk a little about Washington.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.420
I've been down there working
for a company,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.982
but it has brought me into
contact with staff in the Senate

00:02:08.982 --> 00:02:12.647
and the House,
and I thought I'd share a

00:02:12.647 --> 00:02:18.143
little of the texture of that
with you because it relates to

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:21.155
capitalism in--
or at least to American

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:24.938
capitalism,
in an interesting way.

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:32.202
As you know Saturday night at
quarter to midnight the House of

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:39.822
Representatives passed a version
of the Healthcare Reform Bill by

00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:43.990
the margin of 220 yea,
215 nay.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.901
The first thing remarkable
about that number is it adds up

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:53.169
to 435;
very few bills add up to 435.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.585
This one was one where being
absent would be the sort of

00:02:57.585 --> 00:03:02.161
offense which could cost you
your seat in Congress because

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.650
the intensity is that high.
 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.389
The other feature of it,
and I read--

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.128
I can't claim to have read more
than about 20% of the bill,

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:22.068
but the stunning feature of it
is that the fingerprints of

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:29.590
lobbyists are all over it in a
degree that is just--

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.568
it was to me pretty disturbing.
 

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:39.688
I'm reasonably cynical about
how the world works but the

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:44.995
number of cases where the bill
will be going along talking

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:47.750
about one thing,
and then there will be a

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.354
paragraph,
labeled Section 1753,

00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:54.870
and it will require the
services of licensed

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.223
podiatrists,
or it will require a funding

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:08.228
grant to a certain category of
health providers in a region of

00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:11.639
several western states.
 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.569
It's just pockmarked with very
intense lobbying.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.500
Then when you talk to the
staffs of the two parties,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.660
you get two very different
kinds of talk.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.028
Let's leave my politics out of
this.

00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:35.351
Which side do you think would
sound more coherent right now,

00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:39.014
the Republicans or the
Democrats, talking about the

00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:40.480
healthcare bill?
 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:48.129
Have I got a microphone I can
hand somebody?

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:57.079
Who wants to take a shot at
that one?

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:00.802
Student:  I would guess
the Republicans since they

00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:04.459
haven't had to have made
concessions to numerous special

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:06.920
interests to get the bill
passed.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.319
Prof: Terrific,
you nailed it.

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.170
Are you a political science
major?

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.800
Student:  Yes.
 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.430
Prof: Good for you.
 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.812
In Washington this year $2.9
billion dollars--repeat that

00:05:20.812 --> 00:05:26.512
number: $2.9 billion
dollars--was spent on lobbying

00:05:26.512 --> 00:05:29.589
the federal government.
 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:34.970
While compared to the cost of
the healthcare bill,

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.800
that doesn't sound like much,
it's an awful lot of lobbying,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.310
and the majority party on a
bill like this is--

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.250
well how many--let's suppose
they did it as follows:

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.889
Obama brings in fifty wise men
and women from Harvard,

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.615
Yale, Berkeley,
Michigan, Texas,

00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:09.226
and so on and they spend thirty
days working on the best

00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:13.901
possible bill,
to get the most bang for the

00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:18.600
buck for the general public in a
new healthcare plan,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.839
and then he puts it in an
envelope and sends it up to the

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.079
cap--
sends it over to Capitol Hill.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:27.541
About how many votes,
if it were really well done,

00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:29.050
do you suppose it would get?
 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.189
Anyone want to take a guess at
that?

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:34.459
We have historical experience.
 

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:38.980
This is what the Clintons did,
right?

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.004
Nearly two decades ago,
and it got shot full of holes

00:06:43.004 --> 00:06:44.629
immediately, right?
 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:48.819
There was just--there was
virtually no support for it

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.413
because all the defensive
interest groups staked out their

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.293
ground,
no concessions,

00:06:55.293 --> 00:06:57.490
or very few concessions were
made,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.990
and it just sank.
 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.769
Does anybody remember how the
Obama people handled this piece

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:03.838
of legislation?
 

00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:06.600
What did they say to the
Speaker of the House,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.519
Nancy Pelosi?
 

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:12.569
Anybody--do you guys read
newspapers?

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:15.569
Tom, do you have any memory of
this?

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:20.067
Student:  I mean he more
or less gave some broad outlines

00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:23.209
of principles for the bill and
then said,

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.007
"You do it,"
and handed the whole thing over

00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:25.720
to the legislature.
 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.593
Prof: Okay,
so he handed the thing to The

00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:32.908
House of Representatives,
and the lobbying process became

00:07:32.908 --> 00:07:39.144
very intense,
and it is an incredibly

00:07:39.144 --> 00:07:45.802
intricate set of,
not--most of it--an awful lot

00:07:45.802 --> 00:07:51.509
of it is like the earmarks for a
bridge in Alaska,

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:54.759
but it's usually not a bridge
in Alaska,

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.591
it is a podiatrist in an office
spread all the way across the

00:07:58.591 --> 00:07:59.230
country.
 

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:05.884
And I really do believe in
markets, and there is so much in

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:10.701
this bill that would not meet
market tests,

00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:11.850
right?
 

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.512
If you said we're going to
require the service of

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:18.639
podiatrists in a certain aspect
of it,

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.985
and you ask yourself,
well would people sign up for

00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:22.769
that if it were not required by
law?

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:28.110
In an awful lot of cases the
answer is yes of course,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.256
some would sign up for it,
but the amount spent would be

00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:35.500
billions less than if you do it
this way.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.289
Now you all can--I voted for
President Obama and I'm deeply

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:47.480
supportive of his and other
people's goals for the country,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.452
but this bill,
I can't--I really can't stand

00:08:52.452 --> 00:08:53.840
up for it.
 

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.956
Does anybody want to take the
affirmative about why it is

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:03.669
we've just got to get this done?
 

00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:06.360
I promise to be polite.
 

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.605
Okay, well we'll go from
something easy to something more

00:09:11.605 --> 00:09:12.730
difficult.
 

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:18.528
Mory's is--okay let's first
find out how many of you have

00:09:18.528 --> 00:09:21.220
ever set foot in Mory's?
 

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.899
Wow, so we have a whole room
full of experts.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:30.905
Would somebody like to recap
what they think the last year or

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:34.710
two of Mory's existence looked
like?

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:41.730
This could be fun, go for it.
 

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.847
Student:  There was like
a struggle to be much more

00:09:44.847 --> 00:09:46.604
inclusive,
so there were all these

00:09:46.604 --> 00:09:49.240
promotions so you could get a
Mory's membership for $10,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.178
you could come in and get $10
off your,

00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:54.311
like, meal and my friends and I
totally made use of that because

00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:56.149
we like eating everywhere at
Yale,

00:09:56.149 --> 00:09:57.529
around Yale.
 

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:00.178
So we did go a few times,
but we never got a--

00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:02.278
I don't think we ever really
got a Mory's membership,

00:10:02.278 --> 00:10:04.846
things fell through,
and then we never really heard

00:10:04.846 --> 00:10:05.720
about it again.
 

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.840
Prof: It closed on the
19^(th) of December.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.389
Do you want your money back?
 

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:12.889
Student:  No, I'm fine.
 

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:15.629
Prof: Okay.
 

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:21.255
Anybody want to say anything
about what they think the place

00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:26.596
was like from a member or
customer point of view over the

00:10:26.596 --> 00:10:28.980
last couple of years?
 

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.110
Any complaints?
 

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:37.860
We have complaints--did I see a
hand here?

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.529
Here's one back here.
 

00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:42.340
Student:  The food.
 

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.230
Prof: The food.
 

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.000
How was the service?
 

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.169
Student:  Well--
Prof: Mes-a-mes?

00:10:50.169 --> 00:10:51.350
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.466
Prof: Mory's lost a lot
of money in the last two and a

00:10:53.466 --> 00:11:02.308
half years it operated;
roughly speaking $1,000 a day.

00:11:02.308 --> 00:11:10.240
Chris Getman here became its
president after the disaster was

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:18.169
revealed, and has been working
with a group of us to bring it

00:11:18.169 --> 00:11:19.360
back.
 

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:27.677
I thought I would start with
Chris and just get him to

00:11:27.677 --> 00:11:35.840
reflect for a minute on what the
task looks like,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.116
and what we hope to accomplish,
and then we'll talk to

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.375
Jonathan,
and then I'll come back with a

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:42.889
summary of the business plan.
 

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:45.315
Chris Getman:
 Well, let me start by

00:11:45.315 --> 00:11:47.509
saying that the--how does this
work?

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:50.908
Hello?
 

00:11:50.908 --> 00:11:54.649
Prof: It works just like
that.

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:55.788
Chris Getman:  Okay.
 

00:11:55.788 --> 00:12:07.950
The first thing I--like a
Whiffping.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.278
I'll just--can you all hear me
if I talk like this?

00:12:10.278 --> 00:12:15.272
The first thing I did before I
became president was to get Doug

00:12:15.272 --> 00:12:17.928
Rae to agree to join our board.
 

00:12:17.928 --> 00:12:22.469
The second thing I did after I
was president was to close the

00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:24.677
place,
terminate everybody in

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:28.009
management but one person who's
still with us,

00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:29.879
her name is Robin Soltas (sp?)
 

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:35.288
and she's a terrific employee,
and then we had to lay off all

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:36.370
the staff.
 

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:42.980
We were going to run out of
money the middle of January,

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.500
we closed on the 19^(th) of
December,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.730
and actually this is a good
thing because as you said,

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:54.019
Mory's was doomed given the
quality of the food and the

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:55.980
service basically.
 

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.823
That's what makes restaurants
succeed or fail and we were not

00:13:00.823 --> 00:13:03.649
succeeding in that regard at
all.

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:07.714
I think that when we reopen
it's going to be a place where

00:13:07.714 --> 00:13:10.710
you guys are really going to
want to go.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.038
We are reaching out to the
students, if you want your $10

00:13:14.038 --> 00:13:17.370
your back, when we're
profitable, we'll get it to you.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.846
The second thing I did after
that was to get Jonathan to

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:23.798
agree to work with us.
 

00:13:23.798 --> 00:13:29.158
In addition to being a great
guy he's also a form of Whiff,

00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:33.514
and as I think most of you
know, the Whiff's are a very

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:36.418
important constituency of
Mory's,

00:13:36.418 --> 00:13:39.100
along with a lot of others,
the athletic teams,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.399
political affiliations,
and faculty,

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:44.558
etc., but the Whiffs were a big
part of Mory's and the reason a

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:46.700
lot of people go there on Monday
nights.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:53.312
We have formed a committee to
raise money to not only make

00:13:53.312 --> 00:13:57.490
capital improvements to the
club,

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.418
it was pretty run down for
structural improvements,

00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:05.066
goes from the wiring all the
way to getting working

00:14:05.066 --> 00:14:08.690
fireplaces in a couple of the
rooms,

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:14.053
and the cost to do what we hope
to do is going to be something

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:18.100
in the neighborhood of $2.9
million dollars.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:24.912
We're well along the way to do
that and I hope to have good

00:14:24.912 --> 00:14:32.428
news about the fact that we've
reached our goal and can open--

00:14:32.428 --> 00:14:35.489
and we're not going to sign any
long term contracts with

00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:37.155
electricians,
or plumbers,

00:14:37.155 --> 00:14:41.039
or contractors until we know
we'll be able to see the job all

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:42.269
the way through.
 

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:44.009
It's been fun.
 

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:47.327
There's an awful lot of--Mory's
is the largest private club in

00:14:47.327 --> 00:14:49.940
the world because in the old
days there were--

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.893
you were a lifetime member and
it would cost $15 to join for

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.924
life,
and so we have 14,000--or

00:14:56.924 --> 00:15:01.861
probably 13,000 members now;
many of them we don't hear from

00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:05.748
but there's an awful lot of
loyalty and a positive sentiment

00:15:05.748 --> 00:15:10.469
about the club,
and we're very confident that

00:15:10.469 --> 00:15:13.460
this is going to happen.
 

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:19.645
Jonathan Ingham:
 Why Mory's and why Mory's

00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:27.474
as an association as opposed to
an adjunct or some form of open

00:15:27.474 --> 00:15:31.009
house being run by Yale.
 

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:34.529
Let me back up a little bit.
 

00:15:34.529 --> 00:15:37.850
Ten minutes ago,
Doug asked me to come in and

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.700
share some of my thoughts about
Mory's with you,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:49.298
and so this is--I'm talking as
I'm thinking and I'm going to

00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:55.740
try and relate it to the purpose
of this class,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.700
which is capitalism.
 

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:06.950
First of all, why Mory's?
 

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:12.104
I came back to the Yale Bowl
about five or so years ago and I

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:16.280
was watching the Harvard game,
and I was sitting with some of

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.447
my Harvard friends,
and about halfway through the

00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:23.666
game I wasn't having any fun,
and so I said I'm going to go

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:27.528
back to New Haven and just hang
out and see what's going on.

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:32.311
I couldn't find a door that was
unlocked in the entire town of

00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:35.258
New Haven,
and I'm thinking to myself,

00:16:35.258 --> 00:16:38.830
where do people like me go on a
Harvard weekend,

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.044
or any other kind of weekend,
or when I want to show up in

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.820
town there's no place.
 

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.970
I wasn't a member of Mory's
before I got involved with this,

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.370
because back when I was your
age, plus two or three years,

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.350
I didn't have the $25 to--or at
least I didn't think it was a

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.500
good expenditure $25 for a
lifetime membership,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.210
so I kind of ignored it.
 

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:09.028
Then I started going back with
a Whiff alumni group,

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.118
and we would sing on occasion
at Mory's,

00:17:11.118 --> 00:17:13.950
on Monday's when the Whiffs
were somewhere else,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:21.557
and it occurred to me that this
was a place that deserves to be

00:17:21.557 --> 00:17:22.538
alive.
 

00:17:22.538 --> 00:17:27.410
But as I looked around and saw
this place, it clearly didn't

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.630
reflect the needs of the
marketplace.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:35.692
It was basically a place where
old guys go and have meals

00:17:35.692 --> 00:17:37.048
occasionally.
 

00:17:37.048 --> 00:17:45.078
I didn't see any students
there, there was no vibrancy,

00:17:45.078 --> 00:17:48.644
no relevance to the place,
and so then I got involved

00:17:48.644 --> 00:17:53.580
because of these guys,
and the whole concept of what

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:59.470
Mory's should be became
crystallized in my thinking.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:04.006
It belongs because it
represents 150 years of

00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:10.192
experience, all the pictures up
there, all the traditions and

00:18:10.192 --> 00:18:11.118
cups.
 

00:18:11.118 --> 00:18:14.134
Everybody has their own
particular memories about it,

00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:16.685
but collectively,
it is an important part of,

00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:18.598
I think, the Yale experience.
 

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:22.480
And, I think,
sadly, it hasn't been an

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.410
important part of your
collective experience.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:32.098
I think if you do a survey
among the graduate students,

00:18:32.098 --> 00:18:36.874
85% to 90% of them won't
even--or never thought that they

00:18:36.874 --> 00:18:40.368
were eligible for membership to
Mory's.

00:18:40.368 --> 00:18:45.953
I think what we're trying to do
here is to preserve the

00:18:45.953 --> 00:18:52.432
memorable aspects of Mory's,
the iconic nature of the place,

00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:58.872
but also to open it up and make
it a welcoming institution for

00:18:58.872 --> 00:19:01.914
the student body,
both graduates and

00:19:01.914 --> 00:19:02.650
undergraduates.
 

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.204
And by that I mean
having--expanding things like

00:19:05.204 --> 00:19:08.780
singing group nights,
doing things which we found to

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.190
be successful at the Yale Club
in New York,

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:16.170
which was to have poetry
readings, discussions of novels,

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.930
and any kind of thought.
 

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.738
We want to be open to the
student body to be able to say

00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:28.058
come on and let's discuss this
here.

00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:32.361
Then of course we hope that
that sort of activity will spill

00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:36.079
over and include some selling of
drinks and food.

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:37.019
Prof: Terrific.
 

00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:38.469
Jonathan Ingham:
 But basically--let me just

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:39.019
finish one thing.
 

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:44.430
It belongs--run by market
forces, not by Yale.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:50.402
The alumni--the Rose Alumni
House is useless as far as most

00:19:50.402 --> 00:19:54.173
graduates go,
and a Mory's which would be run

00:19:54.173 --> 00:19:57.453
by Yale,
I think would similarly not be

00:19:57.453 --> 00:19:58.318
relevant.
 

00:19:58.318 --> 00:20:01.930
I believe an active,
well-run restaurant,

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.337
bar and lounge,
which is responsive to the

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:08.617
needs of the student body,
is the way to go,

00:20:08.617 --> 00:20:11.890
and that's where I think we're
trying to come out on this deal.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.859
Prof: Okay.
 

00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:14.960
Now let's talk business.
 

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.090
Mory's, in its last year of
operation, did about $900,000 of

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.700
bar and restaurant business.
 

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.646
When I say bar and restaurant
you may be confused by the first

00:20:28.646 --> 00:20:29.329
word.
 

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:32.420
Where's the bar at Mory's?
 

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.309
There is none.
 

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:37.130
Right?
 

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:42.349
It's founded on drinking songs
and it has no bar;

00:20:42.349 --> 00:20:43.940
kind of odd.
 

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.904
It is all about Yale,
and only 7% of Yale's enrolled

00:20:47.904 --> 00:20:49.769
students belong to it.
 

00:20:49.769 --> 00:21:00.234
It is a business with an
absolutely natural market all

00:21:00.234 --> 00:21:02.210
its own.
 

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:06.568
Steven Blumenfeld,
who's a junior in the college,

00:21:06.568 --> 00:21:09.200
was in this course a year ago
when I got started on this,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.913
and he said,
"Why don't we do a

00:21:10.913 --> 00:21:11.650
survey?"
 

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.509
So he did a survey monkey
instrument,

00:21:14.509 --> 00:21:18.459
and got 600 student answers,
and the most interesting thing

00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:22.816
about it was that something over
200 of the 600 thought that they

00:21:22.816 --> 00:21:25.200
were ineligible to join Mory's.
 

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.790
They thought it was
somehow--for all different

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.717
reasons,
but a third of our market just

00:21:31.717 --> 00:21:34.946
thought,
"Can't go there,"

00:21:34.946 --> 00:21:37.588
so that's kind of an issue.
 

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:42.333
Well the--also in the
background the university has

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:48.309
done some focus groups over the
last five years looking for what

00:21:48.309 --> 00:21:53.623
students and a larger Yale
community want in the Broadway

00:21:53.623 --> 00:21:55.900
walk part of town.
 

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.950
What do you think comes up
number one?

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.890
Student:  Bar.
 

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.509
Prof: Bar,
and a specific kind of bar;

00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:05.368
a sports bar.
 

00:22:05.368 --> 00:22:10.940
What we're going to do is in
the back of the building,

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.838
facing away from York Street
toward Morrison Styles,

00:22:15.838 --> 00:22:20.347
toward the retail block,
we're going to put a bar that

00:22:20.347 --> 00:22:24.086
we'll have a walkway,
an indoor walkway into the main

00:22:24.086 --> 00:22:27.461
building,
and it will be a kind of--it'll

00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:31.751
have characteristic Mory's
memorabilia and a Yale

00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:36.286
atmosphere to it,
but there will be plasmas and

00:22:36.286 --> 00:22:41.142
you can watch even such
below-the-salt institutions as

00:22:41.142 --> 00:22:46.730
Michigan and The University of
Southern California on a plasma

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:47.828
screen.
 

00:22:47.828 --> 00:22:57.029
The--and that slots into the
basic bottom line goal.

00:22:57.029 --> 00:23:02.173
Mory's did $900,000 in
business, it had roughly $1.5

00:23:02.173 --> 00:23:07.519
million in expenses last year,
and you do the math.

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:13.380
The average labor cost embodied
in each meal served was $31.50;

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.950
cogitate that for a second.
 

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.592
I didn't say anything about the
cost of the food,

00:23:22.592 --> 00:23:24.109
heat, electricity.
 

00:23:24.109 --> 00:23:28.140
Labor: $31.50--yes.
 

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.763
Student:  I remember you
mentioned in a class earlier

00:23:30.763 --> 00:23:32.942
this year that it was because of
the labor unions,

00:23:32.942 --> 00:23:34.500
and so is that still a problem?
 

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.855
Prof: One of the reasons
we didn't do this a few weeks

00:23:39.855 --> 00:23:44.763
ago is that I can't give a
completely straight answer to

00:23:44.763 --> 00:23:49.224
every question,
and that's one of the questions

00:23:49.224 --> 00:23:52.160
which is very much up in the
air.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.910
If I said it was because of the
union, I misspoke.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.630
The union is--my assessment is
that the problems with the union

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.808
were about a quarter to a third
of what was wrong,

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:06.858
and Chris--you know mostly when
people say,

00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:08.847
"We've got a terrible
labor problem,"

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.618
the first question you have to
ask is,

00:24:10.618 --> 00:24:12.163
"Don't you maybe have a
terrible management

00:24:12.163 --> 00:24:12.690
problem?"
 

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.940
And Mory's had both.
 

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.650
Often the trouble--the contract
was onerous, there's no

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:21.608
question.
 

00:24:21.608 --> 00:24:27.711
The tight work rules,
benefits comparable to General

00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:33.410
Motors;
it was a bad contract.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:38.154
But we have a very cooperative
relationship with Unite here and

00:24:38.154 --> 00:24:40.557
Local 217,
and we're working on a

00:24:40.557 --> 00:24:44.588
constructive agreement that will
include all kinds of things you

00:24:44.588 --> 00:24:47.150
don't usually see in labor
contracts.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.009
This is me speaking,
not an official statement,

00:24:51.009 --> 00:24:56.577
but it is my hope that it will
include an individual incentive

00:24:56.577 --> 00:25:02.328
story where if people work hard
and help us produce profits,

00:25:02.328 --> 00:25:05.298
they'll share in it beyond
their wages,

00:25:05.298 --> 00:25:08.759
and I actually think we might
get to that,

00:25:08.759 --> 00:25:12.130
though nothing to announce but
just an aspiration.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:17.798
Okay so we eventually come up
with a business plan,

00:25:17.798 --> 00:25:22.923
and Mory's has to go from
$900,000 in business to a $1.9

00:25:22.923 --> 00:25:26.378
million,
and much under a $1.9 million

00:25:26.378 --> 00:25:28.390
it isn't going to work.
 

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:34.026
Then you ask yourself how many
restaurants in New Haven make a

00:25:34.026 --> 00:25:37.630
$1.9 million a year in gross
revenue?

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:43.269
Anybody got a guess?
 

00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:47.480
There are MBA's in the room;
you guys are good at guessing.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.880
Igor what do you have?
 

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.618
Student:  How many
restaurants?

00:25:49.618 --> 00:25:52.402
Prof: How many
restaurants make a $1.9 million

00:25:52.402 --> 00:25:53.900
a year gross in New Haven?
 

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.048
Student:  Zero.
 

00:25:56.048 --> 00:25:58.210
Prof: Zero,
you're not too far off.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.640
Richard, what do you have?
 

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.789
Student:  A handful.
 

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:03.180
Prof: A handful.
 

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.578
You nailed it,
two is the answer.

00:26:05.578 --> 00:26:10.807
There are exactly two such
restaurants, and they're both on

00:26:10.807 --> 00:26:15.135
the edge of the campus,
and therefore potentially

00:26:15.135 --> 00:26:17.480
competitors to Mory's.
 

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.430
Can you name them?
 

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.039
Student:  Union League.
 

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.470
Prof: Union League.
 

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.660
Student: 
&gt;

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.930
Prof: Say again.
 

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.049
Student:  Miya's.
 

00:26:29.049 --> 00:26:30.490
Prof: No.
 

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.349
I think I heard the right
answer.

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:34.480
Student:  Zinc.
 

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.144
Prof: Yeah,
and those are guesses on my

00:26:37.144 --> 00:26:37.558
part.
 

00:26:37.558 --> 00:26:40.029
They're rather well educated
guesses.

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:44.519
It's not as if these
restaurants gave me their books,

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:46.680
but they're my guesses.
 

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.108
That's the competitive
standpoint.

00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:57.410
Mory's--what drives the
business?

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:01.170
What's the first driver you
have to think about?

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:05.253
Well the--we all know it has to
do with food,

00:27:05.253 --> 00:27:09.431
drink, service,
quality of experience in every

00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:14.630
way but why don't more people
walk through the door?

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:18.078
Well partly because all those
things are not very good,

00:27:18.078 --> 00:27:21.528
but partly because they don't
think they're invited.

00:27:21.528 --> 00:27:25.134
Because they don't think
they're invited,

00:27:25.134 --> 00:27:28.200
it never occurs to them to
come.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.920
Now what--if you were going
to--let's name a demographic by

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.061
how old they are,
how much money they make,

00:27:38.061 --> 00:27:40.430
and where they live.
 

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:46.396
Who should we think of as the
people who can make Mory's into

00:27:46.396 --> 00:27:49.680
a $1.9 million dollar business?
 

00:27:49.680 --> 00:28:01.500
Yale alumni living in
California?

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:10.656
Okay, hands up for that;
okay so that's not--so the fact

00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:13.778
that Yale has 160,000 living
alumni,

00:28:13.778 --> 00:28:19.009
and that the vast majority of
them have handsome incomes,

00:28:19.009 --> 00:28:22.529
does that solve our problem or
not?

00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:27.377
Not;
is there a subset that might

00:28:27.377 --> 00:28:29.759
help solve our problem?
 

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:32.259
Yes.
 

00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:33.700
Student:  Well,
those within driving distance.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.027
Prof: Okay,
good, it's a thirty mile

00:28:37.027 --> 00:28:39.880
radius, and there are about
7,800.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.257
Yale alumni in a thirty mile
radius, and we're not

00:28:44.257 --> 00:28:46.578
getting--almost nothing.
 

00:28:46.578 --> 00:28:51.757
Can you think of another market
segment that you might want to

00:28:51.757 --> 00:28:53.369
pay attention to?
 

00:28:53.369 --> 00:28:56.769
It's already been mentioned.
 

00:28:56.769 --> 00:28:57.548
Student:  Current
students?

00:28:57.548 --> 00:28:59.894
Prof: Yeah,
I'm holding up a mirror,

00:28:59.894 --> 00:29:00.509
it's you.
 

00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:09.730
Now let's start--may I presume
to start with you?

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:22.078
This is a sales call;
I'd like you to join the

00:29:22.078 --> 00:29:23.480
restaurant.
 

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:28.153
Student:  What does that
entail--or how much do I have to

00:29:28.153 --> 00:29:28.598
pay?
 

00:29:28.598 --> 00:29:30.778
Prof: How much do I have
to pay?

00:29:30.778 --> 00:29:33.650
You have to pay $15--what year
are you?

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.210
Student:  I'm a senior.
 

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.759
Prof: You're a senior.
 

00:29:36.759 --> 00:29:39.192
Well you're not going to get
the best deal,

00:29:39.192 --> 00:29:42.554
because the price is for the
duration of your years at Yale

00:29:42.554 --> 00:29:43.538
as a student.
 

00:29:43.538 --> 00:29:47.741
The price is $15,
and we're going to give you a

00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:50.299
$10 food and drink credit.
 

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:51.279
Are you 21?
 

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:51.430
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:56.619
Prof: Okay,
so a $10 drink and food credit,

00:29:56.619 --> 00:30:02.233
so the net cost to if you like
to either drink or eat,

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:05.730
and we have good stuff is $5.
 

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:10.558
Student:  Do I pay $5
dollars flat?

00:30:10.558 --> 00:30:15.669
Prof: Yeah you're going
to have to write a check for $15

00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:17.069
for the rebate.
 

00:30:17.069 --> 00:30:20.038
Are you going to do it or not?
 

00:30:20.038 --> 00:30:21.944
Student:  I'd have
to--it depends on if other

00:30:21.944 --> 00:30:23.440
people I know are going to do it
also.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.250
Prof: That's a really
good answer.

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:28.670
It depends on if other people I
know are going to do it.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:34.936
I think you're exactly right,
but tell me how you got--what

00:30:34.936 --> 00:30:36.990
are you thinking?
 

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.910
Student:  Well I've
never been to Mory's before,

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.118
and I don't want to just go in
and sit by myself if none--

00:30:43.118 --> 00:30:44.818
no one else I know is going to
be there.

00:30:44.818 --> 00:30:47.460
Prof: That's absolutely
the right answer,

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:53.967
right, because restaurants and
clubs are a so-called network

00:30:53.967 --> 00:30:56.608
good,
and the value of going by

00:30:56.608 --> 00:31:00.338
yourself and sitting in the
corner is not very high.

00:31:00.338 --> 00:31:05.025
It's meant to be friendly,
so there's a huge insight

00:31:05.025 --> 00:31:05.759
there.
 

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:06.960
Let me try a couple more people.
 

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:13.009
Jennifer how about you?
 

00:31:13.009 --> 00:31:18.920
This is a sales call.
 

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.068
You already know the price.
 

00:31:20.068 --> 00:31:21.766
Student:  All right,
well I would want to know what

00:31:21.766 --> 00:31:23.780
kind of food they serve,
because if I have--if I'm a

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.498
picky eater,
maybe I wouldn't even enjoy

00:31:25.498 --> 00:31:27.108
going there because I'm not
twenty-one.

00:31:27.108 --> 00:31:29.086
Prof: Okay,
you're not twenty-one,

00:31:29.086 --> 00:31:30.470
and are you a picky eater?
 

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.630
Student:  For these
purposes yes,

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:33.348
today I am.
 

00:31:33.348 --> 00:31:37.029
Prof: Okay,
what are you--what are your

00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.930
criteria?
 

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.638
Student:  Let's say I'm
a vegan, would I even want to

00:31:41.638 --> 00:31:42.079
join?
 

00:31:42.079 --> 00:31:44.700
Prof: You're a vegan?
 

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.048
The 3/4 pound hamburger that we
plan to serve,

00:31:48.048 --> 00:31:49.390
that's not good.
 

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.460
Student:  No.
 

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.519
Prof: Okay so you're
going to want to have--you don't

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:56.269
insist I--you insist that we
serve only vegan food?

00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:58.813
Student:  No,
but I want to know that if I go

00:31:58.813 --> 00:32:01.155
there I will enjoy my
experience, so if you have

00:32:01.155 --> 00:32:03.598
options that I would eat that
would be great.

00:32:03.598 --> 00:32:08.567
Prof: So vegan options
and we're going to be open a

00:32:08.567 --> 00:32:09.088
lot.
 

00:32:09.088 --> 00:32:11.528
It used to be we were open
thirty-nine hours a week,

00:32:11.528 --> 00:32:14.380
we're going to be open 65.5
hours a week,

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.390
and a lot of that extra time is
pub time,

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.608
where the restaurant will be
closed but the pub will be open,

00:32:20.608 --> 00:32:25.696
and the idea is to come in and
meet your friends for a drink

00:32:25.696 --> 00:32:27.940
and have a vegan burger.
 

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.298
Student:  That sounds
great.

00:32:30.298 --> 00:32:31.328
Prof: Am I getting
anywhere with you on that?

00:32:31.328 --> 00:32:33.318
The vegan burger or that
doesn't--

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:35.096
Student:  Yeah,
and you know most things served

00:32:35.096 --> 00:32:36.470
at a bar are vegan,
so I think I would.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:40.180
Prof: So your--did you
sign up or not?

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.038
Student:  I haven't.
 

00:32:42.038 --> 00:32:44.750
Prof: Still in doubt,
okay, all right.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:55.868
Let's go right here,
so $15 minus $10?

00:32:55.868 --> 00:32:58.490
Student:  Yeah,
I mean, I actually--

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.170
I thoroughly enjoyed going even
before the--

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:06.259
before it shut down but I
never--see I never went to eat,

00:33:06.259 --> 00:33:07.868
was the thing, though.
 

00:33:07.868 --> 00:33:10.537
We always went for cups with a
group of friends or something

00:33:10.537 --> 00:33:12.707
along those lines,
so I'm definitely attracted by

00:33:12.707 --> 00:33:13.250
the bar.
 

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.880
Prof: Do you actually
like cups?

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.732
Student:  It was more
just sort of the experience,

00:33:19.732 --> 00:33:22.278
which was what was being
discussed.

00:33:22.278 --> 00:33:24.601
Prof: I actually think
there's this peculiar thing

00:33:24.601 --> 00:33:25.140
about cups.
 

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:30.278
I know lots of people who do
cups and don't like them,

00:33:30.278 --> 00:33:34.430
and it's--what they're doing,
and it's your point,

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.298
it's the social thing,
it's with your friends.

00:33:36.298 --> 00:33:38.220
Chris, do you claim to like
cups?

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.641
Chris Getman:
 If you put a cup on the

00:33:42.641 --> 00:33:46.961
menu as a drink,
and served it by the glass,

00:33:46.961 --> 00:33:48.670
probably not.
 

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.348
It's the experience,
quite frankly.

00:33:51.348 --> 00:33:53.630
Prof: Yeah,
it is the experience.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.505
Jonathan, I think I remember
that you don't much care for

00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:55.740
them.
 

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.118
Chris Getman:
 And I like to drink.

00:33:58.118 --> 00:34:01.670
Prof: We have that in
common;

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.308
all three of us have that in
common.

00:34:03.308 --> 00:34:09.981
It's a pretty diverse student
market, but it turns out that

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:16.309
the students are the drivers,
the biggest driver for the

00:34:16.309 --> 00:34:18.150
whole thing.
 

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:25.414
The reason is that the ambience
of the place is geriatric,

00:34:25.414 --> 00:34:28.730
and geriatric is boring.
 

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.657
For example,
I got my mother to move into an

00:34:31.657 --> 00:34:34.773
assisted living home a year ago,
and she said,

00:34:34.773 --> 00:34:38.106
"Promise me you'll get me
out of here after a year if I

00:34:38.106 --> 00:34:40.650
hate it,"
and after a year she said,

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.300
"I hate being around these
old people,

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.670
get me out of here,"
and she's out.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:49.217
So we've got to get you
involved to get other people

00:34:49.217 --> 00:34:50.199
involved.
 

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:57.362
Now the faculty are also--it
turns out the faculty are the

00:34:57.362 --> 00:35:05.277
biggest spenders on a per capita
basis at Mory's but we're still

00:35:05.277 --> 00:35:09.938
way short of enough--
what I've talked about now so

00:35:09.938 --> 00:35:11.929
far is about enough to do a
million,

00:35:11.929 --> 00:35:13.920
$1.1 or $1.2 million.
 

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.590
Where else are we going to go
looking for customers?

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:23.269
Anybody got a thought?
 

00:35:23.269 --> 00:35:31.512
In the back--
Student:  Tourists and

00:35:31.512 --> 00:35:36.360
visitors to New Haven.
 

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.581
Prof: Okay,
tourists and visitors,

00:35:40.581 --> 00:35:43.219
what do you think guys?
 

00:35:43.219 --> 00:35:46.199
Jon do you think that'll work
or not?

00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:47.710
Chris Getman:
 Tough in the club model.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.626
Prof: Yeah,
the trouble with that is that

00:35:49.626 --> 00:35:50.239
we're a club.
 

00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:53.139
Now it can be the people who
have reciprocal agreements with

00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:55.300
the Mory's club,
and there are how many clubs

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:55.989
like that?
 

00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:57.735
Jonathan Ingham:
Right now there's only one but

00:35:57.735 --> 00:35:59.219
there are going to be several
when we reopen..

00:35:59.219 --> 00:35:59.813
Prof: Okay.
 

00:35:59.813 --> 00:36:01.394
Jonathan Ingham:
 That's one of the things

00:36:01.394 --> 00:36:02.449
we're going to focus on.
 

00:36:02.449 --> 00:36:05.440
Prof: Okay we,
our--our business plans counts

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.260
on no business from tourists.
 

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.760
Anybody else got a thought?
 

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.289
Student:  Making members
or new members annually,

00:36:15.289 --> 00:36:18.195
so even if they're not actually
coming into the restaurant they

00:36:18.195 --> 00:36:19.650
still pay the membership fee.
 

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.027
Prof: Okay,
turns out that the membership

00:36:23.027 --> 00:36:25.315
dues are--
they're a nice little add on,

00:36:25.315 --> 00:36:28.266
but they're in the neighborhood
of the last couple of hundred

00:36:28.266 --> 00:36:32.563
thousand dollars,
and that's not chicken feed for

00:36:32.563 --> 00:36:36.250
us,
but it's not foundational.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:40.400
In the back--
Student:  One of the

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.090
previous barriers for Mory's was
the perception of exclusivity,

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:49.489
and if you opened up membership
to the larger Yale community,

00:36:49.489 --> 00:36:51.583
broadly defined,
that would open new revenue

00:36:51.583 --> 00:36:53.900
streams,
so not just the students but

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.619
faculty and staff as well.
 

00:36:55.619 --> 00:36:57.659
Prof: Okay that's huge.
 

00:36:57.659 --> 00:36:59.934
First of all,
the entire staff of the

00:36:59.934 --> 00:37:03.916
university becomes eligible for
membership, whatever the rank or

00:37:03.916 --> 00:37:05.179
job description.
 

00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:08.309
Chris Getman:
 That's already been voted

00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.650
on.
 

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:13.090
Prof: Second,
the subway alumni are a very

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.329
important part of any
university.

00:37:16.329 --> 00:37:21.260
Like Notre Dame has about six
million subway alumni,

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.896
people who identify with the
school and do all the stuff and

00:37:25.896 --> 00:37:29.590
never set foot on it in the role
of student,

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:33.199
and Yale has some of that too,
quite a lot of it.

00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:39.706
Where do we go looking for
people who obviously love the

00:37:39.706 --> 00:37:46.925
institution but don't show up on
our record of alumni and such

00:37:46.925 --> 00:37:47.989
like?
 

00:37:47.989 --> 00:37:50.469
Student:  Parents
associations.

00:37:50.469 --> 00:37:52.340
Prof: Say again.
 

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.969
Student:  Like the
parents of the students.

00:37:53.969 --> 00:37:55.389
Prof: Parents?
 

00:37:55.389 --> 00:37:59.280
Yes, student parents are one
segment of subway alumni,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.599
and we think we probably get
400 or 500 of them to join

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:08.760
annually,
and so that's not

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.960
inconsequential.
 

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.489
Student:  Donors to Yale
University.

00:38:14.489 --> 00:38:23.409
Prof: Okay anybody who
has ever given $100 to Yale,

00:38:23.409 --> 00:38:29.199
alumni or not,
is clearly eligible.

00:38:29.199 --> 00:38:31.250
Anybody else you might think of?
 

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.480
Student:  Yale sporting
events.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.409
Prof: Yale sporting
events, very good.

00:38:36.409 --> 00:38:45.179
How would we go about finding
the right list there?

00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:49.320
Student:  A club.
 

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.458
Prof: It's--first of a
club--we're not Joe's Bar &amp;

00:38:52.458 --> 00:38:55.798
Grill,
so we can't sort of walk around

00:38:55.798 --> 00:39:01.260
at halftime at a football game
with a sign come to Mory's.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.952
Student:  Doesn't it
come down to the way you enter a

00:39:02.952 --> 00:39:03.440
sporting event?
 

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.641
If you're affiliated with the
university either just kind of

00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:10.114
take it or get it for free using
your student card or whatever it

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.777
us,
you want to have a list of the

00:39:11.777 --> 00:39:12.760
people that are paying.
 

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.969
Prof: Okay so we want
actual paying customers,

00:39:15.969 --> 00:39:19.610
and the people we would aim at
are season ticket holders.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:24.226
Season ticket holders for Yale
athletics--are there any other

00:39:24.226 --> 00:39:27.150
groups like that you might think
of?

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:34.898
Let's talk about your parents
and not about them being members

00:39:34.898 --> 00:39:38.400
of Mory's,
but what would trigger them to

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.300
be members of Mory's if they
lived near Yale,

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.960
and were not Yale alums?
 

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.690
Want to take a shot at that?
 

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:51.849
Not really, okay that's fine.
 

00:39:51.849 --> 00:40:05.670
These MBA's know it all.
 

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.016
Student:  Well I guess
as parents coming to visit your

00:40:09.016 --> 00:40:11.221
student--
or your son or daughter as a

00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:13.054
student,
you may not necessarily be able

00:40:13.054 --> 00:40:15.340
to spend all the time that
you're on campus with them,

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.621
and you want somewhere you can
go and just kind of kill some

00:40:18.621 --> 00:40:20.179
time while you're waiting.
 

00:40:20.179 --> 00:40:22.760
Prof: Okay,
so that's the parent niche

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.230
again.
 

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:27.550
How about people who have
already shown a propensity to

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.429
spend money in things like
Mory's?

00:40:30.429 --> 00:40:36.000
How about the membership roster
of the New Haven Lawn Club?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.940
How about the membership roster
of the Quinnipiac Club or The

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.393
Graduate's Club,
or The New Haven Country Club,

00:40:43.393 --> 00:40:47.507
or any one of twenty other
comparable clubs in the thirty

00:40:47.507 --> 00:40:48.610
mile circle?
 

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.920
What do you think?
 

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.630
Who's got an intuition one way
or the other about that?

00:40:54.630 --> 00:41:01.659
Let me give you another hint
about that.

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:07.329
The dues at most of those clubs
is measured in the low thousands

00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:08.320
per year.
 

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.820
The dues at Mory's,
no one will pay more than $100

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:18.206
a year for Mory's,
and if you are a member of the

00:41:18.206 --> 00:41:21.356
Lawn Club--
the Lawn Club has food that is

00:41:21.356 --> 00:41:25.070
better than Mory's but a hell of
lot worse than Union League,

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:33.309
and if I came to you and said,
$100/$2,000 I might get you to

00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:41.548
switch clubs but more likely
what I'd get you to do is to add

00:41:41.548 --> 00:41:43.059
Mory's.
 

00:41:43.059 --> 00:41:49.739
Yes, Jim.
 

00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:52.231
Jim Alexander:
 Aren't you leaving out the

00:41:52.231 --> 00:41:55.139
all-important potential drinking
business of the grad and

00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:56.489
professional students?
 

00:41:56.489 --> 00:41:59.036
Prof: We are,
and I should point out to you

00:41:59.036 --> 00:42:01.474
that Jim Alexander,
whom you all know well,

00:42:01.474 --> 00:42:05.376
not just from his Enron days,
is, in eight days from now,

00:42:05.376 --> 00:42:09.210
assuming office as president of
the Lawn Club,

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:12.094
and I was talking about
stealing his members sort of

00:42:12.094 --> 00:42:13.679
just to have fun with him.
 

00:42:13.679 --> 00:42:20.110
Do you think he can keep that
membership list secret from me?

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:25.887
I was president two years ago,
plus there's a membership

00:42:25.887 --> 00:42:29.039
directory that is published.
 

00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:33.750
Now would I want to harm the
Lawn Club?

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:37.548
Not at all, but would I like to
get in on a little of the

00:42:37.548 --> 00:42:38.159
action?
 

00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:39.880
Absolutely.
 

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.862
Now--
Student:  I have a

00:42:42.862 --> 00:42:47.166
question about your--
Prof: Does it follow

00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:49.029
this line of--
Student:  Yeah,

00:42:49.029 --> 00:42:49.820
it's on this line of talking.
 

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.034
Just a criticism,
I guess, are you a bit

00:42:52.034 --> 00:42:55.387
concerned that if you open the
net too broadly to Quinnipiac

00:42:55.387 --> 00:42:57.286
institutions,
Yale Lawn Club,

00:42:57.286 --> 00:43:00.503
etc., that you may be diluting
what was the value of the

00:43:00.503 --> 00:43:03.592
institution in the first place,
which is what we mentioned

00:43:03.592 --> 00:43:05.960
before, which was the history of
being a Yale institution.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.090
Prof: Okay,
that's a good question.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:14.987
Let me--let's turn--let's go
back to Jonathan and Chris about

00:43:14.987 --> 00:43:15.559
that.
 

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:21.878
If we let too many non-blues in
the door, does the value of it

00:43:21.878 --> 00:43:25.090
for the blues begin to erode?
 

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:27.159
Jonathan Ingham:
 I don't think so.

00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:31.739
I don't think you can tell a
Yale graduate from a non-Yale

00:43:31.739 --> 00:43:36.239
graduate quite frankly out in
the general marketplace.

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:42.731
I believe that the nature of
Mory's is going to be self

00:43:42.731 --> 00:43:49.224
selecting and people who are
interested in joining will

00:43:49.224 --> 00:43:51.989
naturally go there.
 

00:43:51.989 --> 00:43:55.190
Those who might not fit what
you consider the mold,

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.072
or even the diluted aspect
probably would say,

00:43:58.072 --> 00:43:59.929
"Who needs it?"
 

00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:02.434
Prof: Okay,
I actually think there is a

00:44:02.434 --> 00:44:04.440
little bit of a dilution
problem,

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.030
and there's a little bit of the
kind of Groucho Marx thing,

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:09.244
where you say,
"I don't want to be a

00:44:09.244 --> 00:44:10.489
member of a club that'll take
me."

00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:14.778
The--but the segment of
students that we think we're

00:44:14.778 --> 00:44:19.320
going to get quite a great
change from that is starting

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.780
from zero are graduate and
professional students.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:28.699
Leslie's a Ph.D candidate in
the political science

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:33.320
department, what are our
prospects with you?

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.474
Student:  I'd say
they're fairly good,

00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:43.045
but you've already pitched it
to me as an upscale version of

00:44:43.045 --> 00:44:43.989
GPSCY.
 

00:44:43.989 --> 00:44:46.393
Chris Getman:
 Is she writing a

00:44:46.393 --> 00:44:47.369
dissertation?
 

00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:49.260
Prof: No.
 

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:55.250
The--one of the things--well
how about MBA's?

00:44:55.250 --> 00:45:00.454
I'm hoping we're going to get
about an 80% response rate from

00:45:00.454 --> 00:45:03.230
MBA's, what do you think guys?
 

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.460
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.614
Prof: What is it--and
other than trying to please me

00:45:09.614 --> 00:45:12.693
at the moment,
what are you going to get out

00:45:12.693 --> 00:45:13.409
of it?
 

00:45:13.409 --> 00:45:19.639
Student:  I think that
for an MBA,

00:45:19.639 --> 00:45:22.184
there's also a lot of benefit
in the connections with other

00:45:22.184 --> 00:45:24.289
alumni that are willing to pay
and come back,

00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:26.559
as far as networking and future
job opportunities,

00:45:26.559 --> 00:45:29.010
and just getting to know people
in specific areas.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.449
Prof: Yeah,
and one more to the back.

00:45:31.449 --> 00:45:35.688
Student:  Also I don't
know of another place aside from

00:45:35.688 --> 00:45:39.860
GPSCY that has a patio where we
can just share a pitcher,

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.407
and I think there's real value
in just being able to have an

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:47.137
anchor institution that's close
to the center of the university

00:45:47.137 --> 00:45:47.800
campus.
 

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:53.800
Prof: Absolutely,
so Chris, we've got five

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:59.052
minutes left,
and I'll actually circle back

00:45:59.052 --> 00:46:06.429
to this later in the course,
but let's hear your pitch.

00:46:06.429 --> 00:46:12.862
Chris is a born salesman;
he is the best fundraiser I've

00:46:12.862 --> 00:46:15.349
ever been close to.
 

00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:21.019
We've raised--what was the
number determined this morning?

00:46:21.019 --> 00:46:22.610
Chris Getman:  $1.7.
 

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:27.422
Prof: $1.7 million
dollars so far and Chris pitch

00:46:27.422 --> 00:46:28.559
this thing.
 

00:46:28.559 --> 00:46:31.885
Chris Getman:
 Well I think--pitch it to

00:46:31.885 --> 00:46:35.152
the students or to--
Prof: Pitch it to

00:46:35.152 --> 00:46:35.820
everyone.
 

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.836
Chris Getman:
 Well what--first of all as

00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:40.413
Doug said right now the food at
Mory's is worse than the Lawn

00:46:40.413 --> 00:46:40.800
Club.
 

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.840
I happen to be a longtime
member of the Lawn Club,

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.594
and I ate there yesterday,
only because I couldn't go to

00:46:48.594 --> 00:46:51.360
Mory's,
but I think that in the future

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.702
the food at Mory's is going to--
this is our hope anyway,

00:46:54.702 --> 00:46:57.471
the food and the service is
going to be something that

00:46:57.471 --> 00:46:59.300
people will want to go back too.
 

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.585
We had a lot of people who
would go there for the first

00:47:02.585 --> 00:47:04.530
time and say,
oh this is so cool,

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.599
because it was a unique place.
 

00:47:06.599 --> 00:47:11.298
But their dining experience,
both food wise and service wise

00:47:11.298 --> 00:47:14.643
was mediocre,
so they didn't become regular

00:47:14.643 --> 00:47:15.760
customers.
 

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.880
So our first hope is that
all--everybody--

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:23.139
the bar in the back we think
with the pub is going to be

00:47:23.139 --> 00:47:27.556
ideal for students and grownups
for that matter and I just

00:47:27.556 --> 00:47:30.809
wanted to add to what Doug was
saying.

00:47:30.809 --> 00:47:34.449
A couple of other groups that
we're going to target are

00:47:34.449 --> 00:47:38.608
subscribers to The Yale Rep,
subscribers to The New Haven

00:47:38.608 --> 00:47:41.885
Symphony Orchestra,
subscribers to Longworth,

00:47:41.885 --> 00:47:44.740
The Schubert,
who are people we feel won't

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.539
really dilute the character of
the place,

00:47:47.539 --> 00:47:54.998
and we're very optimistic that
people are going to think that

00:47:54.998 --> 00:48:00.324
Mory's is a good value,
it's fun, and they're going to

00:48:00.324 --> 00:48:04.139
want to go back there,
and we're very optimistic about

00:48:04.139 --> 00:48:06.210
this $1.9 million in revenue.
 

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.429
I just--I think that's a slam
dunk.

00:48:08.429 --> 00:48:15.239
Prof: We'll be
recruiting a marketing team in

00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:22.849
the spring term to help us hit
the numbers we have to,

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:27.396
with new student enrollments,
and I hope one or two of you

00:48:27.396 --> 00:48:30.349
will take an interest in that
task.

00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:33.983
It's actually a really
interesting set of business

00:48:33.983 --> 00:48:34.800
problems.
 

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:45.880
First let's thank my colleagues.
 

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.728
On Monday next please read the
Goldman Sachs IPO,

00:48:50.728 --> 00:48:55.878
which we'll take apart,
and we'll have the help of a

00:48:55.878 --> 00:48:57.900
Goldman partner.
 

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:03.000

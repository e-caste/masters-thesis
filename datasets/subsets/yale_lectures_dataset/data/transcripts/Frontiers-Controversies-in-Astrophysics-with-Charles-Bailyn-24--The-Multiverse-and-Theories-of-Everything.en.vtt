00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.332
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Just in time for our

00:00:03.332 --> 00:00:05.568
last class, we get this in
yesterday's New York

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.850
Times, and all over the rest
of the media.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.360
"New Planet Could Be
Earth-like."

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.763
You know, every time they get a
new planet, it's always

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.900
Earth-like, but this one might
really be true.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.999
It was found by the standard
Doppler shift method,

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.818
which you guys all remember,
and turns out to be the lowest

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:28.821
mass planet that's been
discovered in that particular

00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:31.177
way.
And so, as a kind of final

00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:34.813
farewell calculation,
I thought we'd check the New

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:39.477
York Times' numbers on this.
You can go back and read the

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:44.482
article for yourself.
The information given there is

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:49.050
that the orbital period is about
13 days.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.500
The distance between the planet
and its star – that's the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.200
semi-major axis – is given as
7 million miles.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.651
These are, of course,
not the world's best set of

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:04.586
units.
The distance to the system is

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:08.959
20 light-years.
That's really close.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.663
Somebody's quoted in the
article as saying,

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:15.269
you know, we could go there.
Not so much.

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:18.887
And I looked up the apparent
magnitude of this star,

00:01:18.887 --> 00:01:21.370
which turns out to be about
10.5.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.580
And so, what can we do with
information of this kind?

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.012
Well, let's first put this into
some kind of sane set of units,

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:33.610
here.
Thirteen days is--let's see.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.580
Three days is--3.5 days would
be 1% of a year.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.960
So, this is,
like, 3 x 10^(-2) of a year.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.311
Seven million miles.
That's something like 10

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:55.230
million kilometers,
10^(7) kilometers,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.527
which is 10^(10) meters.
So, that's something like 7 x

00:02:00.527 --> 00:02:04.281
10^(-2) Astronomical Units.
And you know right away what to

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:05.457
do with that,
or, at least,

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:08.080
you will if you go back in your
notes for a few months.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.771
This is in good units to use
a^(3) = P^(2)

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:13.479
M.
M, then,

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.879
shows up in solar masses.
So let's figure out the mass of

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:24.102
this star.
Let's see, (7 x 10^(-2))^(3) /

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:29.993
(3 x 10^(-2))^(2).
That'll be the mass in solar

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:33.546
masses.
7 x 7 = 50, times 7 is 350,

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:39.793
times 10^(-6) over 10 x 10^(-4)
[(350 x 10^(-8)) / (10 x

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:46.080
10^(-4))].
That's 35 x 10^(-2).

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.850
.35, which is 1/3.
Okay?

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.169
So, this star is 1/3 of the
mass of Sun--perfectly

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.430
respectable mass for a star to
be.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.010
And then--let's see.
Let's do something else.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.920
It's 20 light-years away.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.716
Twenty light years,
that's something like 6

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.058
parsecs.
So, it's really nearby,

00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:19.815
as these things go.
Not that you would want to take

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:22.583
a spaceship and go there or
anything, but it is one of the

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:25.689
closer stars.
And then, we can do this thing.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:30.000
We can figure out the absolute
magnitude of this star.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.490
I've written down the apparent
magnitude.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.190
So, that's that equation.
Let's see.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.634
5 log (6/10).
Let's call that 2 x 3 x

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:51.199
10^(-1), yeah?
That's 6/10 - five.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.104
And then, you know,
this thing about logs,

00:03:53.104 --> 00:03:55.705
if you multiply them inside the
bracket, you can add them

00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:59.818
outside the bracket.
So, this is log of 2,

00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:04.960
plus log of 3,
plus log of 10^(-1).

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.763
Log of 10^(-1) is -1,
and the other two,

00:04:07.763 --> 00:04:10.940
I happen to know.
The log of 2 is .3.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.600
The log of 3 is .5.
Minus one, that's 5 x -.2 = -1.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.100
And so, 10.5 minus the absolute
magnitude would be -1.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.920
Let's see.
How's this going to work?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.130
This has to go over there.
That has to come over here.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.273
Absolute magnitude, 11.5.
Now, you may remember that the

00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:41.350
Sun has a magnitude--an absolute
magnitude of around 5.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.480
So, this is much,
much fainter than the Sun.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.679
That's good,
because it's less massive than

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:49.560
the Sun, and low mass stars get
faint really quickly.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.145
How much fainter?
Well, we know how to do that,

00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:53.620
right?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.973
Let's see, that looks--in the
easiest format,

00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:04.946
it looks like this:
M_star -

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:09.371
M_sun =
b_star /

00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:13.584
b_sun.
This a minus sign out here in

00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:15.199
front?
Yes.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:26.484
So, that's 10^(-2/5 (11.5 -
5)), which is equal to

00:05:26.484 --> 00:05:31.931
10^((-2/5)(6.5)).
All right, what are we going to

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:36.480
do about that?
6.5 over – 65/5 = 13.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:48.320
So, this is 10^(-1.3 x 2).
2.6.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.818
You could work it out.
And that, in turn,

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:54.613
is equal to--remember,
this is b_star

00:05:54.613 --> 00:05:58.336
/ b_sun,
brightness of the star over

00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:04.471
brightness of the Sun.
That's 10^(0.4) x 10^(-3);

00:06:04.471 --> 00:06:12.388
3+; 3 + .4; - 2.6 and that's
– oh, I don't know,

00:06:12.388 --> 00:06:18.689
what, 2.5 at a guess,
times 10^(-3).

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.290
A tiny fraction of the
brightness of the Sun.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.879
Less than 1% as bright as the
Sun.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.270
And this is the importance of
the discovery.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.370
Because it's in a 13-day orbit.
It's really quite close to the

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.590
star.
We figured out how close.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.788
It's 7%.
The distance of the Earth to

00:06:38.788 --> 00:06:42.750
the Sun is this planet from its
star.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.019
But the star is much fainter
too.

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:48.460
And so, if you do the little
calculation, which is quite

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.212
straightforward to do – we
won't do it here – of how much

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.089
energy this planet receives from
its star,

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.879
compared to the amount of
energy that the Earth receives

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.911
from the Sun,
you get almost exactly the same

00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:04.655
answer.
So, here is a planet whose

00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:09.162
surface temperature is likely to
be quite similar to that of

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:11.753
Earth.
Here is a planet where liquid

00:07:11.753 --> 00:07:14.580
water could exist.
Now, we don't actually know

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.449
that much about this planet
except for its mass.

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.316
It's five times the mass of the
Sun--sorry, five times the mass

00:07:20.316 --> 00:07:22.661
of the Earth.
That could be either a big

00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:26.091
Earth or a small Neptune,
and those are quite different

00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:28.398
objects.
And we don't really know what

00:07:28.398 --> 00:07:30.839
category, from that point of
view, it's in.

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.300
It seems unlikely that it would
be a big Earth,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.120
because this is a low-mass
star.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.920
It's also, as it turns out,
a low-metallicity star.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.594
So, it's got only 1/3 the stuff
of the Sun, and it's got less

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:46.879
than 1/2 the frequency of heavy
materials as the Sun.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:50.292
And so, it's hard to imagine it
could build up a rocky planet

00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:53.420
five times bigger than the
Earth, but you never know.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.297
Stranger things than that have
happened, and will probably

00:07:57.297 --> 00:07:59.269
happen again,
in astronomy.

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.500
So, you don't know what will
happen with this one.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.956
There's rumors going around,
I should say,

00:08:03.956 --> 00:08:07.312
that there are even more
entertaining planets going to be

00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:11.069
announced in the next few weeks,
so, keep your eye on the

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:13.838
newspapers.
There may, in fact,

00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:17.391
be more to come.
Okay, so that's the last

00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:20.605
calculation, here.
You just never know when these

00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:22.880
things will show up in the
newspaper.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.004
Okay.
What we're going to do on

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.875
Monday and Tuesday,
we're going to do this double

00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:30.440
strength section--sorry?
Monday and Wednesday.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.195
Thank you.
We decided not to do the

00:08:32.195 --> 00:08:34.210
Tuesday one.
We've got you guys all

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.004
sectioned.
I think there was an email

00:08:36.004 --> 00:08:38.110
yesterday, which told you what
section you're in.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.953
If you have any problems with
that, you know,

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:41.629
make sure we know about it in
advance.

00:08:41.629 --> 00:08:44.911
And later, well,
probably Saturday,

00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:49.639
or so, I will post three pages
of instructions.

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:52.412
You don't have to read them
particularly carefully,

00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:55.462
but I would like you to
download them and print them and

00:08:55.462 --> 00:08:57.679
to bring them with you to the
class.

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:01.050
Let me take you through the
first page of this.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.879
Here we go.
Cosmology: The Game.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:08.059
And let me just take you
through the sequence of play,

00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:10.759
so you know approximately what
will happen.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.370
So, at the start of the game,
everybody gets a role.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.429
You can be a junior or a senior
scientist at one of several

00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:19.950
competing scientific
institutions,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.046
or a member of the review
committee that decides which

00:09:23.046 --> 00:09:25.231
projects to do.
Each of the competing

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.580
institution then proposes a
project and a funding request.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.480
The senior scientist has to
present the case.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.720
The review committee then gets
to decide.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.650
And so, you can't do all of
them.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.389
You can only do some of them.
So, the review committee

00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:42.563
decides what projects to approve
and they give either partial or

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:45.860
a full funding,
and then, they report why they

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.649
have made the decisions they
make.

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:53.835
And then, we tell you what the
results of that scientific

00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:56.059
exploration is.
So, you know,

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:59.159
you go out and you try and find
more supernovae and we tell you

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:02.253
that--I don't know what happens.
Magically, all the supernovae

00:10:02.253 --> 00:10:03.921
have disappeared,
or they're all way,

00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:06.052
way, way too bright,
or whatever it is that the

00:10:06.052 --> 00:10:09.259
answer turns out to be.
And then, you know a little bit

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:11.708
more about the Universe.
At that point,

00:10:11.708 --> 00:10:14.692
the review committee,
which is made up of aging

00:10:14.692 --> 00:10:18.042
pundits, all die off.
The senior scientists are

00:10:18.042 --> 00:10:20.480
promoted to the review
committee.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.481
The junior scientists are
promoted to senior scientists,

00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:26.536
and the review committee are
reborn as junior scientists,

00:10:26.536 --> 00:10:29.067
or something like that.
And so, we sort of cycle

00:10:29.067 --> 00:10:31.186
through all the roles.
And you keep going through

00:10:31.186 --> 00:10:33.611
these cycles until you figure
out what the dark matter and

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:36.379
what the dark energy is.
And then, at the end,

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:40.545
we will sort of debrief,
and decide what the key moment

00:10:40.545 --> 00:10:44.248
of discovery was,
and award a suitable simulation

00:10:44.248 --> 00:10:49.302
of the Nobel Prize.
It was M&amp;Ms last year,

00:10:49.302 --> 00:10:53.009
but we'll see.
So, that's approximately what's

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:55.621
going to happen.
And the key thing is what kind

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:58.943
of projects can you propose?
And the other two pages of this

00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:02.396
handout are going to be a list
of potential projects that you

00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:05.025
can propose.
You can also propose anything

00:11:05.025 --> 00:11:08.129
else you can think of,
and we will invent results on

00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:11.781
the spot for any other kinds of
projects that get approved as

00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:13.861
well.
But I figured it would be a

00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.367
good idea for you to have,
at least, a range of

00:11:16.367 --> 00:11:19.201
possibilities of things you
might consider proposing,

00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:22.257
and why.
So, that will be posted on

00:11:22.257 --> 00:11:24.723
Saturday.
My experience is that in just

00:11:24.723 --> 00:11:26.987
under two hours,
you can figure out all the

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:29.789
secrets of the Universe in this
particular--well,

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:32.491
of a Universe that I design,
which is, you know,

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.330
not as sophisticated,
perhaps,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.990
as the real Universe will turn
out to be.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.290
Okay, procedural questions on
any of that?

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.280
Yes?
Student: So,

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.967
the Universe that we're looking
at isn't going to be like the

00:11:45.967 --> 00:11:48.062
actual Universe as an exercise?
Professor Charles

00:11:48.062 --> 00:11:49.817
Bailyn: Who knows?
Since I don't know what the

00:11:49.817 --> 00:11:51.728
actual Universe is,
it would be a little hard to

00:11:51.728 --> 00:11:53.639
give you the actual Universe as
an exercise.

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:57.030
What I have done is I have
invented a Universe,

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.495
which is consistent with
everything we know now,

00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:03.960
and has many more answers than
we know now.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.875
I would be very,
very fortunate,

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:09.397
indeed, if that turned out to
have anything to do with the

00:12:09.397 --> 00:12:13.504
real Universe.
So, I wish it were true that I

00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:18.080
had those kinds of powers.
But it's possible.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.470
That's the key.
Other questions?

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.952
Okay.
So, last time,

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:28.149
we ended on kind of an
optimistic note.

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:33.153
I had written down this plot,
which was a plot of

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:37.010
Ω_λ versus
Ω_m,

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:42.643
going from 0 to 1 and beyond.
And I put down--I showed you

00:12:42.643 --> 00:12:46.951
the plot of three lines on this
plot, which is the lines

00:12:46.951 --> 00:12:51.730
indicated by different kinds of
cosmological observations.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.661
So, the supernovae,
which we've talked about a lot,

00:12:55.661 --> 00:13:00.379
force you to be on a line
something like that in the plot.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:04.205
So, this is where the
supernovae observation kind of

00:13:04.205 --> 00:13:07.665
forces you to be.
And then, the observations of

00:13:07.665 --> 00:13:11.665
the Cosmic Microwave Background
force the sum of these two

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:14.612
quantities to be one.
And so, you end up with

00:13:14.612 --> 00:13:17.631
something that looks like that
from the Cosmic Microwave

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.354
Background.
And then, by comparing

00:13:20.354 --> 00:13:24.974
simulations of the growth of
clustering to the actual

00:13:24.974 --> 00:13:29.950
clusters of galaxies that we
observe in the Universe,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.720
there turns out to be a third
line, and it looks like this.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:42.190
So, this comes from clustering.
Is that legible?

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.789
Close enough.
Okay.

00:13:45.789 --> 00:13:48.843
And so, the great thing about
this was, if you will recall,

00:13:48.843 --> 00:13:51.843
that there were three different
lines on a two-dimensional

00:13:51.843 --> 00:13:54.283
graph,
and they all cross at the same

00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:56.140
point.
And this constitutes a test of

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.008
the theory, because it is not
necessarily true that if you put

00:13:59.008 --> 00:14:01.923
down three lines at random in a
two-dimensional space that they

00:14:01.923 --> 00:14:03.710
will all cross at the same
point.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.489
And so, the fact that they do
makes you think that something

00:14:07.489 --> 00:14:11.269
about how we understand what's
going on is going pretty much

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:13.783
right.
Because there's no reason for

00:14:13.783 --> 00:14:15.980
these things to cross at a
point.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.988
We predict that they do because
you know they're all measuring

00:14:18.988 --> 00:14:21.059
the same Universe but in
different ways.

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:26.147
And so, the fact that they do
lend some credence to this whole

00:14:26.147 --> 00:14:30.009
wonderful set of stories.
But there's another way of

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:33.167
looking at this plot,
which is to look at what these

00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:35.690
axes are.
What are we actually plotting

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.762
on this plot?
This Ω that shows up is the

00:14:38.762 --> 00:14:42.556
ratio of the density of
something to the critical

00:14:42.556 --> 00:14:46.302
density of the Universe.
So, this axis is,

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:50.570
effectively,
the density of the dark matter.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.984
And this axis,
here, is the density of the

00:14:53.984 --> 00:14:56.548
dark energy.
So, what we are plotting in

00:14:56.548 --> 00:14:59.398
this wonderful plot where
everything works out so nicely

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.611
is the density of something we
don't know anything about versus

00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:05.616
the density of some other thing
that we don't know anything

00:15:05.616 --> 00:15:08.105
about.
And so, in a certain sense,

00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:11.535
the fact that we're
working--regardless of where the

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:14.022
lines are,
the fact that we've got these

00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:17.080
two axes means we don't have any
idea what's going on.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.789
So, that's perhaps the more
pessimistic view.

00:15:21.789 --> 00:15:26.271
And, you know,
thinking about this,

00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:32.070
you get a kind of faint odor of
epicycles.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.594
Remember epicycles?
Epicycles, I talked about in

00:15:35.594 --> 00:15:38.258
the very first class,
your very first lecture of this

00:15:38.258 --> 00:15:40.179
class.
This is the business back in

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:42.474
the Middle Ages,
where they thought the Earth

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:44.559
was still the center of the
Universe,

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:47.824
and they were trying to figure
out what was going on with the

00:15:47.824 --> 00:15:51.071
orbits of the planets.
And they discovered that a

00:15:51.071 --> 00:15:54.730
single circle for each planet
didn't do the job.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.429
It didn't concord with what the
observations were.

00:15:58.429 --> 00:15:59.613
So, they said,
all right, well,

00:15:59.613 --> 00:16:01.505
you know, the Earth's the
center of the Universe,

00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:03.320
and we know everything has to
be a circle.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.440
So, we'll put circles on top of
circles.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.269
And then, they were able to
match the observations.

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:12.140
But then, the observations got
better and they had to have ever

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.950
more complicated circles on top
of circles.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.716
So, let me--so,
that was the story of epicycles

00:16:19.716 --> 00:16:23.151
back in the Middle Ages.
And then, of course,

00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:25.265
what it turned out is that the
idea that the Earth was the

00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:27.487
center of the Universe,
and the idea that everything

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.540
goes in circles is just wrong.
And as soon as you abandon

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.222
those two ideas,
and have the idea that the

00:16:33.222 --> 00:16:35.840
planets go in ellipses around
the Sun,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.990
all of a sudden,
everything gets much simpler

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.075
and it's all explained.
So, what's happening in

00:16:42.075 --> 00:16:44.751
cosmology now?
We're observing the motions of

00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:48.415
galaxies and of objects within
galaxies, like supernovae that

00:16:48.415 --> 00:16:50.972
we can see.
And the first thing we found

00:16:50.972 --> 00:16:54.561
out is that the rotation of
galaxies and other indicators of

00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:57.419
matter aren't in accord with
what we expect,

00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:01.069
so we invent dark matter to
explain the internal motions of

00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:04.201
galaxies and galaxy clusters.
We then discover that the

00:17:04.201 --> 00:17:06.185
external motion,
the motion of these things

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:09.308
through the Universe,
also doesn't accord with what

00:17:09.308 --> 00:17:12.736
we would have expected,
so we invent dark energy in

00:17:12.736 --> 00:17:15.459
order to explain that.
So, we've now,

00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:19.281
in the past twenty-five years,
invented two different,

00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:23.003
but completely imaginary,
as far as we know,

00:17:23.003 --> 00:17:26.980
concepts, to fill 96% of the
Universe with,

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:32.565
to figure out what's going on
with the fact that the motions

00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:36.920
we observe are not the motions
we expect.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.884
How many more?
You know, let's go out and

00:17:39.884 --> 00:17:42.246
measure some more things,
then maybe we'll need dark

00:17:42.246 --> 00:17:45.151
something else.
And dark something else after

00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:47.611
that.
And maybe it needs to change

00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:50.023
with time.
And maybe it needs to magically

00:17:50.023 --> 00:17:52.626
appear halfway through the
history of the Universe,

00:17:52.626 --> 00:17:54.740
or something like that.
Who knows?

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.761
You know, if you keep inventing
these things,

00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:58.920
of course, you can explain
anything you like,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.442
just in exactly the same way
that if you have enough

00:18:01.442 --> 00:18:04.508
epicycles, you can have a model
with the Earth at the center of

00:18:04.508 --> 00:18:07.475
the Universe that explains all
the motions of the planets you

00:18:07.475 --> 00:18:09.456
see.
If you get to just keep

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:12.754
inventing words here,
of course, you can explain the

00:18:12.754 --> 00:18:14.245
Universe.
And, you know,

00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:17.210
what would have happened if
this line didn't come across?

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.000
Supposing that line had been
out there.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.868
What would you have done?
What you would have said is,

00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:22.381
well, of course,
we don't understand dark

00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:25.359
energy.
So, we've just proved that dark

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:29.048
energy varies with time,
or varies spatially,

00:18:29.048 --> 00:18:33.240
or becomes opaque at large
distances, or some other

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.634
quality.
And then, we would have

00:18:35.634 --> 00:18:38.130
rewritten this graph so that
they do cross.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:42.401
That's not very compelling.
And indeed, it has gotten

00:18:42.401 --> 00:18:46.676
sufficiently embarrassing that
there is now just beginning to

00:18:46.676 --> 00:18:51.023
be a feeling that maybe what's
going on is we need new laws of

00:18:51.023 --> 00:18:53.730
physics.
Maybe we're at a moment like

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.910
the end of the sixteenth
century, or the end of the

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.714
nineteenth century,
where the current basic ideas

00:19:00.714 --> 00:19:05.606
that we base our theories of the
Universe on are about to be

00:19:05.606 --> 00:19:08.630
radically transformed.
That's possible.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.576
It's also possible that we'll
wake up three years from now and

00:19:11.576 --> 00:19:14.282
see in the newspaper that
someone has discovered what the

00:19:14.282 --> 00:19:16.519
dark matter is.
And that three years after

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:19.360
that, we will wake up and read
in the newspaper that some

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.354
scientists have developed a good
string theory that entirely

00:19:22.354 --> 00:19:25.450
predicts exactly how the dark
energy is going to behave.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.586
I think, in general,
it's always a good idea to bet

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:33.391
on standard physics,
rather than revolutionary,

00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:36.112
new ideas.
But, if you keep at it for a

00:19:36.112 --> 00:19:38.959
quarter of a century,
as we have, in looking for the

00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:42.140
dark matter, and keep finding
nothing, you got to start to

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.970
wonder.
And indeed, there was a radical

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.013
theory, proposed a few years
back, about the dark matter in

00:19:49.013 --> 00:19:52.079
particular, that there is no
dark matter.

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:54.440
It's just, we don't understand
the laws of gravity.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.575
And so, you know,
we had to modify the laws of

00:19:56.575 --> 00:19:58.710
gravity for very high
gravitational fields.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.369
That turned out to be
relativity.

00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:03.145
And they suggested that you
also need to modify the laws of

00:20:03.145 --> 00:20:05.586
gravity for very low
gravitational fields--the kinds

00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:08.650
of things you feel at the edge
of a galaxy, from the galaxy.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.794
And they figured out how you
would have to do that in order

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:16.724
to explain the orbits of
galaxies without using any dark

00:20:16.724 --> 00:20:19.204
matter.
This is called MOND,

00:20:19.204 --> 00:20:22.000
for Modified Newtonian
Dynamics.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.685
And I don't think that--it's
become clear that that

00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:27.531
particular theory probably isn't
going to go anywhere,

00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:29.759
for various reasons.
It doesn't seem to be

00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:31.928
self-consistent.
But nevertheless,

00:20:31.928 --> 00:20:34.821
this was seriously proposed.
It was also,

00:20:34.821 --> 00:20:36.377
I have to say,
a little philosophically

00:20:36.377 --> 00:20:38.670
dubious, because if you want a
new theory of gravity,

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.589
you don't want to go back to
Newton and start over again.

00:20:41.589 --> 00:20:44.559
You probably want to start with
relativity and move on.

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:47.259
But they made it consistent
with relativity.

00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:50.280
They worked out all the stuff
and it seemed to work okay,

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.084
except, it turns out,
it disagrees with observations,

00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:55.846
also.
But it was a real attempt to

00:20:55.846 --> 00:21:01.130
imagine that these things might
really turn out to be epicycles.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:05.099
And if there isn't progress in
finding out what's going on,

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:09.069
I think we're going to see more
of that as time goes on.

00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:13.913
And it may be that in fifty
years, these things will look

00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:19.188
like what we think about people
who thought that the Earth was

00:21:19.188 --> 00:21:24.680
the center of the Universe.
So, we'll see.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.210
Now, there is one additional
thing that we know about the

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.127
Universe.
In addition to,

00:21:31.127 --> 00:21:34.896
you know, these three lines,
which are kind of the basic

00:21:34.896 --> 00:21:37.500
information that we currently
have.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.168
And that is--so,
here's another fact about the

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:45.800
Universe, kind of an obvious
one.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.637
The fact is that we exist.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be

00:21:50.637 --> 00:21:52.269
having this conversation,
right?

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:55.930
And what does that tell you
about the Universe?

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.942
It tells you the fact that life
exists, and in particular,

00:22:00.942 --> 00:22:05.162
what we grandiosely refer to as
intelligent life,

00:22:05.162 --> 00:22:07.930
exists.
Let's see.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.444
What do you require the
Universe to have if life is

00:22:11.444 --> 00:22:13.960
going to exist?
It needs a couple of things.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.584
We can get into a whole
argument about life as we know

00:22:16.584 --> 00:22:19.705
it, and whether you can make it
out of silicon instead of out of

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:21.564
carbon,
or whether you can have life

00:22:21.564 --> 00:22:24.570
made entirely out of neutrons on
the surface of a neutron star,

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.336
or something like that.
But no matter how you slice it,

00:22:29.336 --> 00:22:32.880
it's got to have some
complexity to it.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.660
You've got to have a lot of
moving parts one way or another.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.970
You have to have information
flowing back and forth.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.477
You can't make a living
creature out of nothing but

00:22:44.477 --> 00:22:47.725
helium atoms.
Helium, you may remember from

00:22:47.725 --> 00:22:50.460
chemistry, is a noble gas.
It doesn't interact.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:54.115
It can't form structures.
And if you had nothing but

00:22:54.115 --> 00:22:57.031
helium, there would certainly be
no life because there would just

00:22:57.031 --> 00:23:00.039
be a bunch of helium atoms that
don't interact with each other.

00:23:00.039 --> 00:23:02.686
If you made the Universe
entirely out of WIMPs,

00:23:02.686 --> 00:23:04.930
Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles,

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.721
that just, kind of,
fly past each other and don't

00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:09.378
pay any attention to each other,
you're not going to have

00:23:09.378 --> 00:23:12.329
anything like life,
because there's no complexity.

00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:18.710
It probably also needs some
time to evolve.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.850
It took a while.
If you start--there's this

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.976
wonderful experiment where you
take a whole bunch of stuff that

00:23:24.976 --> 00:23:27.750
was supposed to be in the oceans
of the early Earth.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.647
And you put it in an atmosphere
of carbon dioxide,

00:23:30.647 --> 00:23:33.189
and you keep sending
electricity through it,

00:23:33.189 --> 00:23:36.971
simulating lightening strikes.
If you keep at that for long

00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:40.830
enough, you can make things that
seem like some of the simpler

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.446
amino acids.
So, you just keep flashing

00:23:43.446 --> 00:23:47.290
lightening at the ocean and you
hope that you eventually--you

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.480
build up life.
Maybe yes, maybe no.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.900
But, certainly it takes a long
time.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.992
And once you have somehow,
magically, out of this process

00:23:54.992 --> 00:23:57.920
of self-replicating viruses or
something like that,

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.736
then, you got to stick around
for a few billion years while

00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:03.650
evolution takes hold and makes
bigger and bigger and more and

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.303
more complex structures.
So, you have to have a certain

00:24:07.303 --> 00:24:11.279
amount of time to allow this
process to go forward.

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:15.734
So, for example,
supposing it were true that

00:24:15.734 --> 00:24:20.500
Ω_λ,
that's the density of the dark

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:26.819
energy, instead of being around
.7, was greater than 100.

00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:29.256
So, the whole Universe is being
pushed apart by this stuff,

00:24:29.256 --> 00:24:31.777
and there's hundreds of times
more of it than there is in the

00:24:31.777 --> 00:24:34.275
current Universe.
You're not going to form any

00:24:34.275 --> 00:24:36.371
structure.
We looked at the formation of

00:24:36.371 --> 00:24:40.067
structure last time.
You just push the Universe

00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:44.632
apart really fast,
and you never get galaxies,

00:24:44.632 --> 00:24:47.296
or stars,
or anything like that,

00:24:47.296 --> 00:24:51.109
because there's too much dark
energy to let them congeal.

00:24:51.109 --> 00:24:54.579
So, push Universe apart--no
structure.

00:24:54.579 --> 00:24:57.556
So, that would be a Universe
that's very unlikely to have any

00:24:57.556 --> 00:24:59.640
kind of complexity and any kind
of life,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.424
because you just take all these
individual particles and push

00:25:02.424 --> 00:25:06.769
them far away from each other.
Supposing it were true that the

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:11.750
density of matter is
significantly less than 10^(-2).

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.674
So, instead of having 1/3 of
the critical density,

00:25:14.674 --> 00:25:17.420
it has less than 1% of the
critical density.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.030
Then, you've got nothing to
form the structures with.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:29.039
And so, the same thing happens.
Also, no structure.

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:33.440
On the other hand,
if the matter density is way up

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.559
in the thousands or the millions
in this kind of scale,

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:41.700
then everything collapses right
away back into a black hole.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.099
And again, there isn't a lot of
structure in a black hole.

00:25:44.099 --> 00:25:49.410
It's one single point in the
center of the event horizon.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.259
So, we have no way of knowing
what these numbers should be.

00:25:53.259 --> 00:25:56.922
But what we do know is that we
are fortunate that they happen

00:25:56.922 --> 00:26:00.646
to be in the relatively narrow
range, because if they weren't,

00:26:00.646 --> 00:26:04.785
we wouldn't exist.
This turns out to be true of

00:26:04.785 --> 00:26:08.931
most of the constants of nature.
For example,

00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:12.480
here's another example:
the Schwarzschild radius.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.890
Remember the Schwarzschild
radius?

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:18.337
The event horizon of a black
hole, given by 2GM /

00:26:18.337 --> 00:26:21.605
c^(2).
Now, supposing you lived in a

00:26:21.605 --> 00:26:25.221
Universe in which G,
the constant of gravity,

00:26:25.221 --> 00:26:29.120
was substantially bigger than
it is in our Universe.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.089
If G were bigger.
And supposing you--in that same

00:26:33.089 --> 00:26:37.418
Universe, c, the speed of
light, were a good deal smaller

00:26:37.418 --> 00:26:40.749
than it is in our Universe.
Just some other--pick some

00:26:40.749 --> 00:26:43.190
other values out of a hat such
that this is true.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:48.182
Then, the Schwarzschild radius
associated with any given mass

00:26:48.182 --> 00:26:50.850
would be bigger,
because both G is

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.583
bigger, c is bigger,
and then, for the same amount

00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:55.307
of mass,
you get a big Schwarzschild

00:26:55.307 --> 00:26:58.031
radius.
So, now, think about what

00:26:58.031 --> 00:27:03.722
happens if the Schwarzschild
radius is bigger than the radius

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:07.163
of a white dwarf.
Then, you never get white

00:27:07.163 --> 00:27:11.163
dwarfs from neutron stars.
All stars evolve when they run

00:27:11.163 --> 00:27:14.820
out of nuclear fuel straight
into black holes.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:23.560
All stars end as black holes.
And the consequence of that is

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.841
that the carbon that is made in
stars is never dispersed into

00:27:26.841 --> 00:27:28.919
the Universe,
and you never end up with

00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:31.378
planets.
Because the next generation of

00:27:31.378 --> 00:27:34.350
stars is still made out of pure
hydrogen and helium,

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.089
just like the first generation
of stars was.

00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:40.196
And you never end up with
enough heavy elements--with any

00:27:40.196 --> 00:27:43.240
heavy elements.
And so, you can't form planets.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:52.007
So, no carbon,
or anything other than hydrogen

00:27:52.007 --> 00:27:56.405
and helium.
And you're not going to make

00:27:56.405 --> 00:27:58.869
life out of hydrogen gas and
helium.

00:27:58.869 --> 00:28:02.179
Now, carbon of course,
this fabulous substance,

00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:04.770
does all this wonderful
chemistry.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.630
It forms rings.
Does all this great stuff.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.585
That's why organic chemistry,
which is the chemistry of

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:14.032
carbon, is more complicated than
the whole rest of all the other

00:28:14.032 --> 00:28:17.480
elements--chemistry of all the
other elements put together.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.428
And so, the properties of
carbon are very,

00:28:20.428 --> 00:28:24.600
very important for allowing
complex structures to exist.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:30.189
So, properties of carbon.
And it turns out that if you

00:28:30.189 --> 00:28:35.791
vary--would disappear,
or not be able to support these

00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:40.759
complex chains and complex
carbon chemistry,

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:44.644
would disappear if the
constants of nature,

00:28:44.644 --> 00:28:48.622
and in particular,
something called the fine

00:28:48.622 --> 00:28:55.240
structure constant,
was even slightly different.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.174
It also turns out you couldn't
make the carbon in the first

00:28:59.174 --> 00:29:02.838
place, because there's a
property of the way the energy

00:29:02.838 --> 00:29:06.569
levels work in an atom that
allows the reaction of three

00:29:06.569 --> 00:29:09.690
helium atoms to fuse into a
carbon atom,

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.155
to occur fast enough for that
reaction to actually take place

00:29:14.155 --> 00:29:18.338
by a substantial amount.
So, it wouldn't take much

00:29:18.338 --> 00:29:22.834
messing around with the
constants of nature to make

00:29:22.834 --> 00:29:27.331
carbon either not exist,
or have different kinds of

00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:30.373
properties.
You know, if carbon turns out

00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:33.359
to be just like iron,
and it just kind of sits there,

00:29:33.359 --> 00:29:36.338
you're, again,
going to have some trouble

00:29:36.338 --> 00:29:39.019
creating any kind of complex
life.

00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:46.339
So, we have this odd situation,
in which it appears that

00:29:46.339 --> 00:29:53.260
drastic, really quite drastic,
fine-tuning of natural

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:58.850
constants is a pre-requisite for
life.

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:05.460
So, not any set of constants
will do.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.115
In fact, if you picked a random
bunch of numbers for all these

00:30:09.115 --> 00:30:12.532
constants, almost certainly,
that would be a Universe with

00:30:12.532 --> 00:30:18.546
no complexity in it at all.
And this gives rise to a set of

00:30:18.546 --> 00:30:23.507
ideas called,
generally, the Anthropic

00:30:23.507 --> 00:30:28.500
Principle,
which is kind of the idea that

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:34.349
the fact that life exists,
and people, in particular,

00:30:34.349 --> 00:30:41.118
is important for understanding
physics--for understanding basic

00:30:41.118 --> 00:30:42.210
physics.

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:54.732
And the way I've just stated
that, you know,

00:30:54.732 --> 00:30:56.299
that seems kind of obvious,
right?

00:30:56.299 --> 00:30:59.059
Of course, it has to be true
that the Universe is such that

00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:00.868
we can exist,
because we know we exist,

00:31:00.868 --> 00:31:03.390
and we're the ones who are
studying the Universe.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:07.700
And so, just in that form,
it's not very interesting.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.751
But the implications of it lead
you in a wide variety of

00:31:12.751 --> 00:31:16.150
different philosophical
directions.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:21.626
So, the question is:
why do all these constants,

00:31:21.626 --> 00:31:25.937
G, c,
λ, what have you,

00:31:25.937 --> 00:31:29.200
have the values they do?

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.023
Okay.
So, as I said,

00:31:36.023 --> 00:31:40.128
there are a wide variety of
different kinds of categories of

00:31:40.128 --> 00:31:44.792
answers to this.
One is that it's just a big

00:31:44.792 --> 00:31:47.950
accident.
You know, whatever it was that

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.470
set these numbers happened to
pick a set of numbers that

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.071
allowed life to exist,
and there's nothing to talk

00:31:54.071 --> 00:31:55.740
about because it's just a
complete accident.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.423
And it could just as easily
have picked out some other

00:31:58.423 --> 00:32:00.839
numbers.
And even though most sets of

00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:03.909
numbers don't allow for the
existence of life,

00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:07.387
the one that's--the set of
numbers that were somehow

00:32:07.387 --> 00:32:10.730
determined by whatever mechanism
determined,

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:14.036
just kind of by accident,
produced a set of numbers that

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:17.735
allows complexity to exist.
Not very satisfying approach

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:20.738
because, among other things,
if that's true,

00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:24.089
your thinking stops dead right
at that point.

00:32:24.089 --> 00:32:27.357
If you can attribute everything
to accident, you know,

00:32:27.357 --> 00:32:32.419
you just go on with your life.
Another, sort of the opposite

00:32:32.419 --> 00:32:37.000
of this, is to say it happened
on purpose.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.401
Life was created,
if you want to use that term,

00:32:40.401 --> 00:32:44.173
or the constants of nature that
allow life to exist,

00:32:44.173 --> 00:32:48.138
are created on purpose.
And there is an obvious

00:32:48.138 --> 00:32:53.017
religious sub-category here,
where you say that there is a

00:32:53.017 --> 00:32:57.809
Creator, a god of some kind,
who did this on purpose.

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:02.559
So, this leads to various kinds
of religious explanations.

00:33:02.559 --> 00:33:08.309
But in more general terms--and
it doesn't have to be religious.

00:33:08.309 --> 00:33:15.323
This is what's called the
Strong Anthropic Principle,

00:33:15.323 --> 00:33:19.910
which says that for some
reason,

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:26.916
be it religion or anything
else, that the Universe must

00:33:26.916 --> 00:33:34.442
have life, or have the set of
constants that allows life to

00:33:34.442 --> 00:33:37.318
exist.
You know, one of the things

00:33:37.318 --> 00:33:40.943
that the physicists are trying
to do is to figure out why these

00:33:40.943 --> 00:33:44.839
numbers have the values they do.
Maybe, it turns out that if you

00:33:44.839 --> 00:33:47.642
finally work out the final
theory of physics and

00:33:47.642 --> 00:33:51.460
everything, that will tell you
what these numbers have to be.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.492
And there's only one choice
that you can't choose randomly

00:33:54.492 --> 00:33:57.018
from these numbers,
that there's some theory that

00:33:57.018 --> 00:33:59.640
underlies, that requires you to
pick certain numbers,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:07.009
and that those numbers in turn
require the existence of life.

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:10.638
And whether or not you
attribute that to religious

00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:14.341
causes, it doesn't make a
difference to the sort of

00:34:14.341 --> 00:34:17.230
structure of this kind of
argument,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.929
that there's only way you could
have made the Universe.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.071
Somebody phrased this,
it might have been Einstein,

00:34:23.071 --> 00:34:24.398
I don't remember,
phrased it as:

00:34:24.398 --> 00:34:26.239
the question is,
did God have a choice?

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.695
Could you have made a
self-consistent Universe with

00:34:29.695 --> 00:34:33.210
some other set of numbers?
Maybe not.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.282
But the version--the approach
to this, which is getting the

00:34:37.282 --> 00:34:41.495
most attention at the moment by
the kinds of people who think

00:34:41.495 --> 00:34:44.420
about these things,
is the concept of the

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.170
multiverse.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.650
Universe is one Universe.
Multiverse is many.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:35:00.424
So, the idea is that there are
many Universes with different

00:35:00.424 --> 00:35:05.300
sets of constants,
sets of numbers.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.827
Numbers and laws.
Well, if that's true,

00:35:09.827 --> 00:35:12.340
then, things are pretty
straightforward.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.563
If you've got 100 jillion
Universes out there,

00:35:15.563 --> 00:35:18.500
and each one has different set
of laws,

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.523
a different manifestation of
the laws of nature,

00:35:21.523 --> 00:35:25.511
then, it's not surprising that
the one we live in happens to be

00:35:25.511 --> 00:35:30.045
conducive for our existence,
because there's a whole bunch

00:35:30.045 --> 00:35:34.570
of other ones out there that
there are no people in.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:39.036
And naturally,
we exist in the one case where

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:41.940
we can.
You know how this works.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.894
It's like going out into a
parking lot, and you see a

00:35:43.894 --> 00:35:45.360
license plate out in the parking
lot.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.050
And the license plate is 308
BJ6, or something like that.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.809
And you say,
gosh, what a coincidence.

00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:55.446
Out of all the license plates
in the Universe,

00:35:55.446 --> 00:35:59.019
that one happens to be sitting
right in front of my office.

00:35:59.019 --> 00:36:00.656
But, of course,
if it was any other license

00:36:00.656 --> 00:36:02.369
plate, you would have said the
same thing.

00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:04.380
And so, that's actually not
surprising.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.249
So, similarly,
if you have a whole lot of

00:36:07.249 --> 00:36:11.697
cars--of Universes in the world,
if you have--there are a whole

00:36:11.697 --> 00:36:14.280
lot of cars in the world,
right?

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.929
There's billions of cars in the
world.

00:36:15.929 --> 00:36:19.560
What are the odds that you get
into the one you own?

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.350
Well, pretty high, right?
Because you're doing it on

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.319
purpose.
Similarly, if there's lots and

00:36:25.319 --> 00:36:27.920
lots of different Universes,
each one with a different set

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.789
of physics,
what are the odds that we exist

00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:36.409
in one that allows us to exist?
Pretty high.

00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:38.804
But the question is,
"Where do all these Universes

00:36:38.804 --> 00:36:43.158
come from?"
And so, how do you generate

00:36:43.158 --> 00:36:48.229
many different Universes?
Why wouldn't you be satisfied

00:36:48.229 --> 00:36:50.130
with just having the one you've
got?

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.657
And so, again,
there are a number of different

00:36:52.657 --> 00:36:53.949
sub-categories,
here.

00:36:53.949 --> 00:37:00.829
There's the one in which you
look beyond the cosmic horizon.

00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:04.087
Now, the cosmic horizon--you
know, if the Universe is 13.7

00:37:04.087 --> 00:37:06.887
billion years old,
we can't see anything more than

00:37:06.887 --> 00:37:09.497
13.7 billion light years away.
And, in fact,

00:37:09.497 --> 00:37:11.859
the further away we look--we
look back in time,

00:37:11.859 --> 00:37:14.734
so, we certainly don't know
anything about what something

00:37:14.734 --> 00:37:17.507
13--what about something 15
billion light years away is

00:37:17.507 --> 00:37:19.902
doing now.
And so, you can imagine that

00:37:19.902 --> 00:37:23.056
there are kind of slow changes
in the constants and laws of

00:37:23.056 --> 00:37:25.379
nature,
and that by the time you're 100

00:37:25.379 --> 00:37:28.880
billion light years away from
us, that part of the Universe,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.187
which is causally disconnected
from our own,

00:37:31.187 --> 00:37:33.869
has some other kind of physics
that is going on.

00:37:33.869 --> 00:37:37.208
And so, you postulate an
infinite Universe of which we

00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:39.350
can only detect ever,
in principle,

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.392
a tiny fraction.
And over there,

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:44.210
somewhere, there's another set
of constants going on.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:48.898
And so, there's another set of
physics far away that we know

00:37:48.898 --> 00:37:53.050
nothing about.
So that's one option.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:58.090
Another option is other
dimensions.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.498
Those of you who have read any
of the popular accounts of

00:38:00.498 --> 00:38:02.820
string theory may be aware that
one of the problems,

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.834
or perhaps, advantages--well,
the computer scientists call

00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:09.300
these features,
of string theory,

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.325
is that you require either nine
or ten, or eleven,

00:38:12.325 --> 00:38:14.980
or perhaps twenty-six spatial
dimensions,

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.610
in order to make it work out.
Then, they do this clever thing

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.800
where they say,
of course, we live in a

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.583
three-dimensional Universe,
but it's really a

00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:23.460
ten-dimensional Universe with
seven dimensions rolled up so

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.457
tight you can't see them.
Kind of a dubious proposition,

00:38:26.457 --> 00:38:29.135
but it works out--it actually
works out quite well,

00:38:29.135 --> 00:38:31.582
mathematically.
But you could imagine that

00:38:31.582 --> 00:38:33.750
you're in a two-dimensional
Universe.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.805
And here's your Universe,
but it's embedded inside some

00:38:36.805 --> 00:38:39.623
additional spatial dimension.
There could be another

00:38:39.623 --> 00:38:42.523
two-dimensional Universe down
here, and you would have no way

00:38:42.523 --> 00:38:45.265
of interacting with it.
And so, you can imagine that

00:38:45.265 --> 00:38:48.289
these extra dimensions that are
being postulated allow the

00:38:48.289 --> 00:38:51.420
existence of many different
three-dimensional Universes,

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.788
kind of, next to each other,
spread out in these higher

00:38:54.788 --> 00:38:57.398
dimensions.
And perhaps they don't all have

00:38:57.398 --> 00:38:59.430
to be three-dimensional
Universes.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.068
They can be other kinds.
I mean, that's another crucial

00:39:02.068 --> 00:39:04.907
number, right--is how many
spatial dimensions your Universe

00:39:04.907 --> 00:39:07.168
has.
And so, one could imagine that

00:39:07.168 --> 00:39:11.197
these kinds of extra dimensions,
talked about quite seriously by

00:39:11.197 --> 00:39:14.720
the strength theorists,
allow the existence of many

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.166
different Universes with
different physical laws to

00:39:18.166 --> 00:39:22.534
choose from.
There's also a kind of

00:39:22.534 --> 00:39:27.749
evolutionary argument.
This is presented in a popular

00:39:27.749 --> 00:39:31.150
book by a guy named Lee Smolin,
which is a wonderful book.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.284
I want you to read it.
His thought is that each

00:39:34.284 --> 00:39:38.510
time--and this came up,
I think, earlier in the class.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.444
Each time you make a black hole
inside the event horizon,

00:39:42.444 --> 00:39:46.899
a new Universe forms.
So, that's one way of doing

00:39:46.899 --> 00:39:53.502
this.
So, new Universes form from old

00:39:53.502 --> 00:40:00.630
ones, from black holes,
or whatever.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:05.476
And supposing you postulate
that each daughter Universe has

00:40:05.476 --> 00:40:10.133
slightly different parameters,
but only slightly different,

00:40:10.133 --> 00:40:13.393
from its parent,
in the way that each of us has

00:40:13.393 --> 00:40:16.440
genetic material that's closely
related,

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.910
but not identical to that of
each of our parents.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:22.958
Well, what happens?
You, then, favor--in the idea

00:40:22.958 --> 00:40:27.999
that you may come out of black
holes-- you favor Universes that

00:40:27.999 --> 00:40:30.520
produce lots of black holes.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:40.895
And so, there's a kind of
survival of the fittest--not

00:40:40.895 --> 00:40:44.510
just for organisms,
but for whole Universes.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.948
If you're the kind of Universe
that produces lots of black

00:40:46.948 --> 00:40:48.960
holes, you're going to have lots
of children.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.769
Then, after this goes on for a
long time, most of the Universes

00:40:52.769 --> 00:40:56.455
in the multiverse will be the
kinds of Universes that produce

00:40:56.455 --> 00:40:59.239
lots of black holes.
How do you make black holes?

00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:02.339
You make the most black holes
by producing lots and lots and

00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:04.900
lots of stars.
Stars are complex objects.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.747
This is the kind of Universe
that you're likely to end up

00:41:07.747 --> 00:41:10.397
with life in.
And so Smolin's argument is

00:41:10.397 --> 00:41:14.730
that because of this survival of
the fittest for Universes as a

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.805
whole,
you're almost guaranteed that

00:41:16.805 --> 00:41:19.995
any particular Universe you pick
out is the kind of Universe that

00:41:19.995 --> 00:41:21.789
will produce lots of black
holes,

00:41:21.789 --> 00:41:23.624
and therefore,
lots of complexity,

00:41:23.624 --> 00:41:25.570
and therefore,
will support life.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.991
And there are various other
versions of this same kind of

00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:31.600
thing.
And this is an attempt to,

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.841
kind of, use the biological
arguments for how you get

00:41:35.841 --> 00:41:38.940
complexity on a cosmological
scale.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.742
There's a difference, of course.
In the case of biology,

00:41:41.742 --> 00:41:44.383
we get to go back and look at
the fossil record,

00:41:44.383 --> 00:41:46.349
and we also understand
genetics,

00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:49.210
so that we know how the small
modifications are created.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.557
I mean, you need a set of
physical laws,

00:41:51.557 --> 00:41:54.747
here, that tell you how
different one Universe is from

00:41:54.747 --> 00:41:56.455
its parents.
And of course,

00:41:56.455 --> 00:41:59.118
that is not something we have
any understanding of,

00:41:59.118 --> 00:42:02.159
or knowledge of.
And this whole multiverse

00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:07.031
concept is now getting a lot of
attention from the people who

00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:10.360
worry about the philosophy of
physics.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.386
And one of the arguments that
people get into over this kind

00:42:14.386 --> 00:42:18.481
of thing, which is kind of an
interesting one--people spend a

00:42:18.481 --> 00:42:22.576
lot of time that--people worry
about this spend a lot of time

00:42:22.576 --> 00:42:25.170
worrying about,
is this science?

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.260
Smolin, by the way,
thinks it is.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.710
He thinks that his idea of
these black holes makes a

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:34.396
testable prediction--namely,
that the current Universe

00:42:34.396 --> 00:42:38.373
should be one that produces the
most number of black holes of

00:42:38.373 --> 00:42:41.493
any possible Universe.
So, if you imagine changing the

00:42:41.493 --> 00:42:44.185
constants of nature and doing a
big simulation of what the

00:42:44.185 --> 00:42:45.980
Universe would look like with
that,

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:51.398
then any other set of constants
of nature would produce fewer

00:42:51.398 --> 00:42:54.829
black holes than this Universe
does.

00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:57.948
I think that's actually
problematic, because most stars

00:42:57.948 --> 00:43:00.489
in our Universe don't produce
black holes.

00:43:00.489 --> 00:43:02.193
So, you can think,
well, tweak it up so that they

00:43:02.193 --> 00:43:04.599
all make black holes.
He then argues that that same

00:43:04.599 --> 00:43:08.053
tweak changes star formation in
such a way that you actually get

00:43:08.053 --> 00:43:10.630
fewer stars to work with in the
first place.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:14.051
Maybe so.
Other people argue that this is

00:43:14.051 --> 00:43:16.784
totally not science,
because as soon as you are

00:43:16.784 --> 00:43:19.219
invoking Universes other than
our own,

00:43:19.219 --> 00:43:22.780
you've left the realm of
science, by definition.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.750
Because, what is the definition
of science?

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:28.593
It's studying our own Universe
in ways that you can actually

00:43:28.593 --> 00:43:29.981
test.
And, by definition,

00:43:29.981 --> 00:43:33.020
if you're talking about another
Universe, it can't be tested.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.550
So, this isn't science.
Other people say, well, look.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:40.584
Supposing you have some kind of
a theory which predicts things

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:43.771
in our own Universe,
which you can observe,

00:43:43.771 --> 00:43:46.888
and also, the same theory
predicts things about the

00:43:46.888 --> 00:43:49.320
multiverse, which you can't
observe.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.902
If you observe the things in
our Universe that you can

00:43:52.902 --> 00:43:54.659
predict correctly,
then,

00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:57.127
that gives you some confidence
that the rest of the theory

00:43:57.127 --> 00:43:59.486
might also be right.
And so, this is a sort of

00:43:59.486 --> 00:44:01.961
intermediate case,
where it's mostly science,

00:44:01.961 --> 00:44:03.625
perhaps.
I have to say,

00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:07.059
I, personally,
think it's the wrong question.

00:44:07.059 --> 00:44:11.120
Because both sides of this
argument presuppose the idea

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.563
that if it's science,
that's good,

00:44:13.563 --> 00:44:17.073
and that if it isn't science,
you shouldn't be talking about

00:44:17.073 --> 00:44:18.150
it.
Right?

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:21.260
I think that's a problematic
point of view.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.999
Just between you,
me, and the video camera back

00:44:23.999 --> 00:44:27.334
there, it's just not true that
things that aren't science

00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:30.728
aren't worth thinking about.
There's plenty of things that

00:44:30.728 --> 00:44:33.090
are worth thinking about that
aren't science.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.286
And my own personal view of
this argument is that this is

00:44:35.286 --> 00:44:37.090
one of them--that this really
isn't science.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.306
But I don't care if it's
science or not,

00:44:39.306 --> 00:44:41.579
because it's still pretty
interesting.

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:46.179
And I think we should also keep
in mind that the border of what

00:44:46.179 --> 00:44:50.928
science is and isn't has evolved
rather quickly over the past 100

00:44:50.928 --> 00:44:53.100
years,
and this ought to be apparent

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.320
from what we've talked about in
this course.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.805
Twenty years ago,
talking about planets around

00:44:57.805 --> 00:45:00.179
other stars was complete science
fiction.

00:45:00.179 --> 00:45:02.598
They did it on Star Trek,
but not in the scientific

00:45:02.598 --> 00:45:03.726
journals.
And this has,

00:45:03.726 --> 00:45:05.743
now, as we saw from the example
this morning,

00:45:05.743 --> 00:45:07.440
changed really,
very dramatically.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.266
Forty years ago,
the idea that you would have

00:45:10.266 --> 00:45:14.697
black holes to actually look at,
that you could pour gas into

00:45:14.697 --> 00:45:18.869
them to see what happens,
was equally unscientific.

00:45:18.869 --> 00:45:21.253
A hundred years ago,
the idea that you could say

00:45:21.253 --> 00:45:23.890
anything scientific about the
Universe as a whole was

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.550
completely preposterous.
That was part of philosophy,

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.107
not part of science.
And yet, over time,

00:45:29.107 --> 00:45:33.647
all of these things have been
kind of assimilated into

00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:36.625
science,
and there's no reason to think

00:45:36.625 --> 00:45:40.628
that the kinds of philosophical
musings about the multiverse

00:45:40.628 --> 00:45:43.293
might not also,
in some way that we can't

00:45:43.293 --> 00:45:45.949
currently understand,
be pulled into science.

00:45:45.949 --> 00:45:49.055
And so, this whole argument
over whether this is science or

00:45:49.055 --> 00:45:50.929
not might be overtaken by
events.

00:45:50.929 --> 00:45:53.101
And events are,
after all, moving pretty

00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:55.350
rapidly these days.
This is a golden age of

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.558
astrophysics because of the
instruments we have,

00:45:57.558 --> 00:46:00.190
the techniques we've developed,
the theories we have.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.828
You know, historians of science
a thousand years from now will

00:46:03.828 --> 00:46:06.573
say, the beginning of the
twenty-first century,

00:46:06.573 --> 00:46:08.840
that's when it was all
discovered.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.009
And so, it's kind of a
privilege for me to play some

00:46:12.009 --> 00:46:15.055
small role in this,
and to have the opportunity to

00:46:15.055 --> 00:46:18.258
talk to you guys about it.
And so, I would say,

00:46:18.258 --> 00:46:21.939
whether or not you've learned
anything interesting about

00:46:21.939 --> 00:46:24.769
astrophysics,
and whether or not you've

00:46:24.769 --> 00:46:28.500
learned anything useful about
the way science works,

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.729
if you've acquired even a
fraction of the enthusiasm that

00:46:32.729 --> 00:46:36.584
I feel for this enterprise,
then, I think our time together

00:46:36.584 --> 00:46:38.409
has been more or less
worthwhile.

00:46:38.409 --> 00:46:40.510
And so, that's all I have to
say.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:46.000
Thank you for your attention,
and we will meet next week.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.258
Professor Donald
Kagan: Peisistratus died in

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:11.817
527 with all his power,
insofar as we know peacefully,

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:18.850
and was succeeded in the
tyranny over Athens by his sons,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.274
by first wife,
Hippeis who was the elder and

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:25.917
Hipparchus.
I think it's proper to think of

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:30.123
Hippeis as the man in charge,
but Hipparchus shared

00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:34.750
considerable amount of his power
and responsibility.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.465
At first it appears that they
ruled in the same way that their

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:46.086
father had, which was to say one
that was moderate and didn't

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:50.490
cause a great deal of opposition
in Athens,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.199
and, of course,
there always was a certain

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.560
amount of opposition.
We should not forger that.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.038
Aristocratic families always
vying for their own power and

00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:05.201
their own position were
uncomfortable very often under

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:09.739
Peisistratus and different ones,
different families got into

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.969
trouble and were driven out,
and our old friends the

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.439
Alcmaeonidae got into trouble
again,

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.830
were banished in the time of
the sons of Peisistratus,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.220
and it was necessary to have a
battle against them,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.950
in which they were defeated and
driven out.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.696
That will play a
significant role in the future

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:38.404
of Athens quite soon.
But I think it's in the year

00:01:38.404 --> 00:01:42.800
514 that a very important event
changes the course of things.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.548
There is a personal quarrel
between the tyrants,

00:01:47.548 --> 00:01:53.366
one of the tyrants actually,
and one of the noble young men,

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:58.849
which results in a plot to kill
both Hippeis and Hipparchus,

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.766
led by two young men who will
become known in Athenian lore as

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:08.625
the tyrannicides,
because in their plot they

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:12.580
succeed in killing the younger
brother Hipparchus,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.883
although they don't get Hippeis.
They themselves are killed and

00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:21.319
the plot fails,
but its significance,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.492
I think,
comes in the fact that it made

00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:28.950
Hippeis thereafter very nervous,
very concerned about his safety

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.639
and about the future of his
regime,

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.544
and the nature of the regime
according to tradition changes

00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:39.841
and it becomes very harsh,
and there are persecutions of

00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:44.581
people, who are suspected of
perhaps plotting or hoping to

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.889
plot against the tyranny,
and that's significant.

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.956
It's a characteristic
event, as I told you early on as

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:53.840
I spoke about tyranny in
general;

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.507
usually in the second and
sometimes if they made it to the

00:02:57.507 --> 00:02:59.759
third, there would be
opposition.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.684
The opposition would make the
rulers nervous,

00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:06.472
the nervous rulers would then
misbehave and create further

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:10.460
opposition and that's the story
as it happens in Athens.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.710
One wrinkle in the Athenian
story is that the Alcmaeonidae,

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.150
who had been expelled from the
city,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.550
always active,
always thinking,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.443
got into a position of a
special favor to the Delphic

00:03:28.443 --> 00:03:32.068
Oracle,
when there was an earthquake

00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:36.400
that badly damaged the temple of
Apollo at Delphi.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.396
The Alcmaeonidae bid for the
contract to rebuild the temple,

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:47.027
and in the doing of that,
they spent some of their own

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:51.140
money to make the temple even
more beautiful than the contract

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.162
required,
which put them in great favor

00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:58.282
with the priests of Delphi,
and they immediately cashed

00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:01.829
this favor in,
in the form of seeking their

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.810
own political advantage.The
story, as Herodotus tells it,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.163
is that their goal was to drive
out Hippeis from Athens and the

00:04:11.163 --> 00:04:15.025
way to do it this time--you
remember they've tried every

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:18.500
trick in the world,
and it hasn't really worked.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.256
The idea now was to turn to the
most powerful military state in

00:04:22.256 --> 00:04:24.620
Greece and use it for their
purposes.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.139
I'm talking of course about
Sparta.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.567
The tale is that whenever the
Spartans sent a message to the

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:35.694
Delphic Oracle asking for the
opportunity to consult the

00:04:35.694 --> 00:04:39.187
Oracle,
the answer that came back was:

00:04:39.187 --> 00:04:43.468
first free the Athenians.
Well, whether that was the

00:04:43.468 --> 00:04:48.162
reason or he had reasons of his
own, the very ambitious King of

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:52.923
Sparta,
King Cleomenes was to undertake

00:04:52.923 --> 00:05:00.800
the job of removing Hippeis from
power in Athens quite soon.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.327
It's in the year 511-10 that
the Spartans under Cleomenes

00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:12.573
will invade Attica,
gain control of the state,

00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:16.769
and remove Hippeis and
withdraw.

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:19.279
But I'll come back to that
story in just a moment.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.146
Let me conclude our
consideration of the Athenian

00:05:24.146 --> 00:05:28.918
tyranny by looking at what were
the achievements and

00:05:28.918 --> 00:05:34.346
consequences of the years of
tyrannical rule--many positive

00:05:34.346 --> 00:05:37.932
elements,
as was so often the case with

00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:41.480
tyranny.
From the economic side this was

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.110
a period of great expansion of
Athenian commerce,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.585
trade, very strong to the east
through the Hellespont and to

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:55.519
the Black Sea,
but also in this period Athens

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:58.459
trades very strongly with the
West.

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:02.710
I mean to say chiefly Sicily
and Italy, and in fact up to

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.430
that point, up to those years
roughly speaking,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.326
Corinthian pottery,
fine Corinthian pottery,

00:06:09.326 --> 00:06:13.300
is dominant in the western
areas and this is no surprise.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.000
That's always been the case for
Corinth.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.741
But by the end of the sixth
century, Athenian pottery has

00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:24.889
actually outstripped it in the
western markets,

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.727
which show you how much this
combination of trade and

00:06:29.727 --> 00:06:34.844
industry was changing the
character of Athens and making

00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:40.427
it wealthier and bringing along
various elements of change in

00:06:40.427 --> 00:06:45.212
their way of life.
Another consequence of the

00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:50.573
tyrannical experience in Athens
was a diminution in the power of

00:06:50.573 --> 00:06:53.687
the aristocracy,
and this again is the general

00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:56.270
story wherever we see tyranny in
the Greek world.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.947
It never erases aristocracy;
you never see the disappearance

00:07:00.947 --> 00:07:03.703
of the distinction between
nobles and commoners,

00:07:03.703 --> 00:07:07.103
and claims to the aristocracy
of birth and descent from the

00:07:07.103 --> 00:07:09.040
gods.
It is always there.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.692
Even in the most democratic of
Greeks states,

00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:17.340
like Athens for instance,
aristocracy doesn't go away.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.567
It's not abolished;
it lives side by side with a

00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:24.100
democratic constitution.
But the domination by the

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.347
aristocracy, the monopoly of all
the powers and influence that

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:31.769
they used to have,
it's not there and that is a

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:34.290
tremendously important
consequence.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.616
So, when the tyranny goes away
and it's necessary to

00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:42.180
reconstruct a new Athenian
constitution,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.637
the answer will not simply be
to return to the old days before

00:07:47.637 --> 00:07:51.237
the tyrants.
Solon had intervened in an

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:56.010
important way and the tyrants
had made their contribution too,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.610
to changes that turned out to
be permanent.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.797
It's also true that under the
tyrants, the local power of the

00:08:04.797 --> 00:08:09.898
noblemen had been reduced and
the power of the government in

00:08:09.898 --> 00:08:13.057
Athens,
which was not dominated by the

00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:16.884
aristocracy, but by the
tyrants--that was a trend and

00:08:16.884 --> 00:08:21.152
one of the issues that would
have to be worked out would be

00:08:21.152 --> 00:08:25.567
what would be the relationship
between the localities outside

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:31.321
of Athens and the city itself.
Localism has been damaged but

00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:35.621
not abolished.
If there are going to be

00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:40.499
new forms of government that
take place, one of the

00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:44.824
consequences,
one of the precursors of that

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:49.970
will be to further strengthen
the center and weaken the

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.724
periphery,
and to continue to strip as

00:08:53.724 --> 00:08:59.220
best one could the influence and
power of the aristocracy,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.996
which was mainly to be felt in
the countryside and to increase

00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:07.520
the power of some other form of
government,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.944
which center would be in Athens.
On the other hand,

00:09:11.944 --> 00:09:15.817
because of the reforms of
Solon, which I remind you

00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:20.000
Peisistratus and his sons
allowed to stay in place,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.602
at least in the formal
sense--therefore every year,

00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:27.732
think about it,
people were elected

00:09:27.732 --> 00:09:31.584
archon,
people where chosen for a

00:09:31.584 --> 00:09:36.150
council, law courts operated,
all of these things not

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:42.294
dominated by the aristocracy,
but really, in the case of the

00:09:42.294 --> 00:09:46.740
magistracies,
wealth was the criterion.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.006
Remember ever since Solon
that people who were not

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:53.950
aristocrats, but were wealthy
also participated in those jobs,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.704
and the council which was open
to three out of the four

00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:01.901
Athenian classes under Solon,
meant that people actually went

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:05.457
to the council chamber,
participated in decisions about

00:10:05.457 --> 00:10:08.395
what was going on.
To be sure they weren't going

00:10:08.395 --> 00:10:11.452
to do anything that the tyrants
didn't want, but ninety to

00:10:11.452 --> 00:10:14.898
ninety five percent of the time,
maybe more, the tyrant didn't

00:10:14.898 --> 00:10:17.657
care, so that they were
getting--this is the point I

00:10:17.657 --> 00:10:21.732
really want to stress.
They were getting experience in

00:10:21.732 --> 00:10:25.990
the business of self government.
When you do that,

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.309
I think the history of the
world shows that once people

00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:34.346
have risen to that state,
where they do participate in

00:10:34.346 --> 00:10:38.003
their own self government,
it's very hard to get them back

00:10:38.003 --> 00:10:40.570
into a state when they don't
anymore.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.960
That's going to be very
difficult to make stick.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.660
Athens has been moved down
the road to self government as a

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.299
consequence, strangely enough,
of the tyranny.

00:10:52.299 --> 00:10:54.376
Just in passing,
I might point out that's not a

00:10:54.376 --> 00:10:57.866
unique phenomenon.
It's very interesting to look

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:03.485
back at the early post-colonial
age in the twentieth century and

00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:08.390
to see that there were real
differences between colonies

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.919
that had been ruled in a--I
don't want to say tyrannical,

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:17.751
but in an absolute way,
such as the Congo or other

00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:21.349
places like that,
as opposed to places that had

00:11:21.349 --> 00:11:24.789
achieved some degree of self
government,

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:28.414
even while they were ruled by
European power,

00:11:28.414 --> 00:11:33.267
the difference was very great.
The same experience that I am

00:11:33.267 --> 00:11:38.007
talking about now that lead to
the capacity and a determination

00:11:38.007 --> 00:11:42.442
to govern oneself was more
likely in places where there had

00:11:42.442 --> 00:11:45.794
been some such thing.
India, of course,

00:11:45.794 --> 00:11:49.428
is a striking example.
Where the Indians had managed

00:11:49.428 --> 00:11:52.882
to achieve some degree of
participation in the government

00:11:52.882 --> 00:11:55.350
of their own state under the
British,

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.258
who in spite of all the
troubles they had,

00:11:58.258 --> 00:12:01.520
have actually produced a
functioning relatively

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.279
democratic government in that
great subcontinent.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.280
Well, that's the sort of thing
I'm talking about.

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:13.594
So, knowing what we now
know, looking backward,

00:12:13.594 --> 00:12:17.376
it's possible to say that it
looks like the tyranny played a

00:12:17.376 --> 00:12:20.837
very important role in the
transition from aristocratic

00:12:20.837 --> 00:12:24.277
government to democracy.
That's not what the tyrants

00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:26.887
intended.
They intended to rule for as

00:12:26.887 --> 00:12:29.812
long as they could,
but it was one of the

00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:34.998
consequences as we will see.
Well, let's turn once again to

00:12:34.998 --> 00:12:40.252
those Alcmaeonidae who had,
as you remember a checkered

00:12:40.252 --> 00:12:44.629
past in Athens and even under
the tyranny,

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:46.570
because they had been driven
out.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.306
Remember Megacles had his deal
with Peisistratus,

00:12:50.306 --> 00:12:54.742
and how Peisistratus had broken
that deal, so he went into

00:12:54.742 --> 00:12:57.755
opposition.
He and the Alcmaeonidae were

00:12:57.755 --> 00:13:01.577
driven out, but they came back,
because we find Cleisthenes

00:13:01.577 --> 00:13:05.562
name on the list of archons,
but then they had been driven

00:13:05.562 --> 00:13:08.139
out again.
In the year 511-10,

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:12.379
Cleisthenes who was leader of
the Alcmaeonidae family,

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:17.179
and political faction was in
exile and was working to get the

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:20.539
Spartans to do the job that was
done.

00:13:20.539 --> 00:13:25.049
So Cleomenes takes his Spartan
army in 510, he drives out the

00:13:25.049 --> 00:13:28.985
tyrants, and then he goes home.
Now, the question that

00:13:28.985 --> 00:13:32.890
confronts the Athenians is what
form of government should we

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.162
have?
Again, there's a whole range of

00:13:36.162 --> 00:13:38.367
possibilities.
Not a whole range,

00:13:38.367 --> 00:13:42.879
there are a few possibilities.
One would be reactionary.

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:46.517
Let's go back to the days
before Solon when the

00:13:46.517 --> 00:13:49.790
aristocracy was everything.
There's certainly,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.221
as we will see where people who
wanted to do something very much

00:13:53.221 --> 00:13:55.133
like that.
On the other hand,

00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:58.470
what are you going to do about
all these people of consequence

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.260
who are wealthy and who have
made it to the top,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.758
but who were not aristocrats?
Then what are you going to do

00:14:04.758 --> 00:14:08.536
about all of these family
farmers of whom there must be

00:14:08.536 --> 00:14:13.013
more now than ever because of my
suggestion that Peisistratus had

00:14:13.013 --> 00:14:17.140
taken away land from some exiled
aristocrats and distributed

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.667
among families,
some of whom were successful on

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:23.744
farms and became hoplite
soldiers and independent

00:14:23.744 --> 00:14:26.272
farmers.
They're not going to enjoy

00:14:26.272 --> 00:14:30.267
being put back to a position
which was worse than they had

00:14:30.267 --> 00:14:33.286
under the tyranny.
Because under the tyranny they

00:14:33.286 --> 00:14:35.914
were sitting on councils,
and participating in these

00:14:35.914 --> 00:14:38.656
things,
sitting in courts and now all

00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:43.418
this was going to be taken away,
if the reactionary aristocracy

00:14:43.418 --> 00:14:46.422
had its way.
That was really what the

00:14:46.422 --> 00:14:50.950
contest was, I think.
Should we continue with the

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:56.155
Solonian Constitution only
without tyrants or should we go

00:14:56.155 --> 00:15:01.283
back to an aristocracy?
The contest for how to decide

00:15:01.283 --> 00:15:05.649
that was done in the usual old
fashioned way.

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:08.595
That is to say,
in the contest for the

00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:11.839
archonship.
The candidates of holding one

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:15.877
view ran against candidates
holding the other view and

00:15:15.877 --> 00:15:19.230
that's where the matter would be
decided.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.862
But they went at it in the old
way that is the decisions were

00:15:23.862 --> 00:15:27.954
being made in the political
clubs that belonged to the

00:15:27.954 --> 00:15:30.310
aristocracy.
In other words,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.493
how we're going to do this was
being fought out among the

00:15:34.493 --> 00:15:37.929
aristocrats, not among the
public at large.

00:15:37.929 --> 00:15:44.007
In that contest Cleisthenes who
stood for the more moderate,

00:15:44.007 --> 00:15:48.540
for the Solonian,
let us say, approach as his

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.940
family had always done,
lost.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:57.120
The winner was a man called
Isagoras, an aristocrat.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.274
They were all aristocrats,
of course, and he engages--I

00:16:03.274 --> 00:16:09.883
should say that this election
takes place after preliminary

00:16:09.883 --> 00:16:16.835
pushing back and forth in the
year 508-7 and his victory means

00:16:16.835 --> 00:16:21.850
a victory for the reactionary
program.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:28.377
One of his first actions is to
establish still another council,

00:16:28.377 --> 00:16:34.799
not the council of four hundred
that Solon had established,

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:40.368
but a new council of three
hundred, and it was only made up

00:16:40.368 --> 00:16:45.490
only of aristocrats.
Second, very interesting and it

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:51.510
turns out to be a very important
change--introduced by Isagoras

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:57.336
was to scrutinize the citizen's
lists and then to remove from

00:16:57.336 --> 00:17:03.259
that list lots and lots of
people who were deemed to be,

00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:06.701
I guess those who were
illegally enrolled in the

00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:09.711
citizen list.
They were now going to

00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:13.315
impose retroactively the
traditional criterion for

00:17:13.315 --> 00:17:17.568
Athenian citizenship.
Is your father an Athenian

00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:20.421
citizen?
But we know that Solon had

00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:24.865
already broken through that by
permitting people to come to

00:17:24.865 --> 00:17:27.700
Athens and to acquire
citizenship,

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.599
if they had the necessary
skills and there surely had been

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:34.608
a fair number of those,
and we are told,

00:17:34.608 --> 00:17:39.558
that the Peisistratids had done
the same thing for pretty much

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:42.544
the same reason.
So, over a couple of

00:17:42.544 --> 00:17:46.879
generations you had foreigners
coming to Athens and acquiring

00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:50.420
Athenian citizenship and
undoubtedly using it,

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:57.118
who are now going to be
disenfranchised and driven from

00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:02.586
the citizen lists.
Now, that made for quite a

00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:06.069
few discontented people in
Athens.

00:18:06.069 --> 00:18:11.206
If you picked a moment after
which Isagoras has accomplished

00:18:11.206 --> 00:18:14.604
these two things,
that is establishing the

00:18:14.604 --> 00:18:17.874
council of 300,
which is obviously going to be

00:18:17.874 --> 00:18:22.281
the governing body in Athens,
an aristocratic council,

00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:27.140
and driven "X" number of people
from the citizen lists,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.167
then all of those people are
going to be very unhappy,

00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:35.498
and very likely they have
friends who are also going to be

00:18:35.498 --> 00:18:39.019
unhappy.
So, you have a situation which

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:43.368
is by now means calm and
settled, but it might have

00:18:43.368 --> 00:18:47.975
settled down as people,
as they usually do when things

00:18:47.975 --> 00:18:51.650
are unavoidable,
when there is no real option.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.529
Nobody's making a different
case;

00:18:53.529 --> 00:18:55.723
they would have just gotten
used to things,

00:18:55.723 --> 00:18:58.897
I suppose.
But now Cleisthenes decides to

00:18:58.897 --> 00:19:02.842
do things different.
He does not accept his defeat

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:05.973
as he would have had to do in
the old days,

00:19:05.973 --> 00:19:09.849
having been defeated in the
aristocratic contest.

00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:14.647
Instead,
in the words of Herodotus,

00:19:14.647 --> 00:19:21.465
prohetaerizetai ton
demon, he brought the people

00:19:21.465 --> 00:19:27.404
into his political faction.
The root of that first word,

00:19:27.404 --> 00:19:31.309
prosetaerizetai,
is hetaera, which means a club,

00:19:31.309 --> 00:19:34.779
a political club,
a collection of companions.

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:38.501
That's the name for these
aristocratic societies and

00:19:38.501 --> 00:19:42.124
Cleisthenes broke the rules.
He went out there beyond the

00:19:42.124 --> 00:19:44.430
aristocratic circle and he
recruited people.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.800
You become part of my political
faction.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.125
Well, why should they?
Because he had a program that

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:56.790
was contrary to the one pursued
by Isagoras.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:05.258
It's one that will result,
when it is successful in the

00:20:05.258 --> 00:20:11.229
establishment of what everybody
pretty much agrees was the first

00:20:11.229 --> 00:20:15.155
Athenian democracy.
The reforms that he

00:20:15.155 --> 00:20:19.406
proposed then--we have to
imagine he actually went around

00:20:19.406 --> 00:20:23.774
and electioneered.
That was not done before that,

00:20:23.774 --> 00:20:28.490
and persuaded people to support
him in his programs,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:32.190
and then he put his programs
through.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.779
Well, where did he put these
programs through?

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:38.619
He surely couldn't have done
that in a council of 300;

00:20:38.619 --> 00:20:41.759
it would never have passed,
and I'm sure he didn't try.

00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:45.003
Instead, he acted,
I think, as though there was no

00:20:45.003 --> 00:20:48.389
council of three hundred.
He did what you would have

00:20:48.389 --> 00:20:51.650
done, if you wanted to propose a
bill prior to that.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:56.576
You would go to the assembly,
whichwas the Solonian assembly,

00:20:56.576 --> 00:20:59.450
which had the right to pass
laws.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:03.062
No doubt, it only passed laws
that the Peisistratids wanted,

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:06.613
but it was not something new.
It was something people were

00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:10.217
accustomed to and he went to the
assembly, and he proposed his

00:21:10.217 --> 00:21:13.471
laws and they were passed.
Well, Isagoras still had

00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:16.003
the whip hand and he wasn't
going to sit still,

00:21:16.003 --> 00:21:21.132
while that took place,
and so using the force at his

00:21:21.132 --> 00:21:26.308
disposal he drove,
which was that of King

00:21:26.308 --> 00:21:31.949
Cleomenes and the Spartans,
who came back again when called

00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:34.608
back.
No doubt, what Cleomenes had in

00:21:34.608 --> 00:21:38.049
mind when he did what he had
done originally,

00:21:38.049 --> 00:21:40.438
that is, driving out the
Peisistratids,

00:21:40.438 --> 00:21:44.084
was the establishment of an
aristocratic republic in Athens

00:21:44.084 --> 00:21:46.410
with his friends being in
charge.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.910
That's what the Spartans
typically would do if they

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.644
could.
So, he was shocked and annoyed,

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:55.590
I'm certain,
when he hears his friends have

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.939
been somehow pushed out of power
and some new fangled kind of a

00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:03.867
government that lets ordinary
people participate has been

00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:06.842
instituted.
So, Cleomenes comes back with

00:22:06.842 --> 00:22:09.439
his forces and drives
Cleisthenes, and we are

00:22:09.439 --> 00:22:13.040
told--this is interesting figure
and I can't promise that it's

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.356
right,
but it does show up in

00:22:16.356 --> 00:22:21.303
Herodotus.
Cleisthenes and seven hundred

00:22:21.303 --> 00:22:28.903
families, who must have been in
his faction, are driven out of

00:22:28.903 --> 00:22:32.060
Attica.
But the people are not

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.699
ready to take that;
they resist,

00:22:34.699 --> 00:22:40.548
and they have numbers on their
side, and they end up shutting

00:22:40.548 --> 00:22:45.519
up Cleomenes and his forces,
which are not many.

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:48.497
We're talking about probably
hundreds of soldiers,

00:22:48.497 --> 00:22:51.414
no more than that,
and we must imagine that there

00:22:51.414 --> 00:22:55.059
are thousands of Athenians out
there who are discontent,

00:22:55.059 --> 00:22:59.016
and so they shut Cleomenes up
on the Acropolis where he had

00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:01.950
run for safety with Isagoras at
his side,

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.329
and finally they cut a deal and
they go home.

00:23:05.329 --> 00:23:11.203
And Cleisthenes and his
supporters, whom I think it fair

00:23:11.203 --> 00:23:16.877
to start calling democrats,
have taken over the city by

00:23:16.877 --> 00:23:20.599
this coup and are ready to go
forward.

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:24.213
Now, this requires that
they establish a new

00:23:24.213 --> 00:23:27.597
constitution,
because they're going to have a

00:23:27.597 --> 00:23:31.980
regime the like of which no one
had ever seen before.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.516
But in trying to understand
this constitution and it's not

00:23:35.516 --> 00:23:38.680
easy--the ancient sources tell
us a lot about it,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.962
but it's not perfectly clear
what's in everybody's mind as

00:23:42.962 --> 00:23:46.484
they do what they do.
Motives and purposes are not

00:23:46.484 --> 00:23:51.071
clear as you'll see in a moment.
But anyway, what I want you to

00:23:51.071 --> 00:23:54.040
fix on is this.
Don't imagine that what's

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.408
taking place here is even
anything like the American

00:23:57.408 --> 00:24:00.380
Constitutional Convention in
Philadelphia,

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.774
where a bunch of delegates have
been selected from here and

00:24:03.774 --> 00:24:07.109
there, and they all sit and
argue with each other over the

00:24:07.109 --> 00:24:10.269
hot summer and finally come up
with various plans.

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:12.539
It's better,
I think, to think,

00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:16.019
if we're using historical
analogies to help us,

00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:20.710
as of course there is nothing
better than that to help us.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:25.545
Think of the French Revolution,
think of the convention where

00:24:25.545 --> 00:24:30.059
the sort of the mass of the
people have gained control of

00:24:30.059 --> 00:24:33.573
the situation,
after driving the king from his

00:24:33.573 --> 00:24:37.366
throne, and after really putting
aside a more aristocratic

00:24:37.366 --> 00:24:42.202
council that came before it,
and they sit down with radical

00:24:42.202 --> 00:24:46.359
people running around,
ready to kill people.

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:50.015
This is the outfit that's going
to end up killing the king and

00:24:50.015 --> 00:24:53.251
his queen, and all the
aristocrats they're going to lay

00:24:53.251 --> 00:24:56.370
their hands on.
In other words,

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:03.500
we are in a revolutionary
situation, and there is force

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:09.325
and terror are in the air,
and everybody is fully aware of

00:25:09.325 --> 00:25:12.349
the danger of this,
that, and the other thing,

00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:16.059
and of some dangers that
probably don't even exist.

00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:19.334
We are in a situation that
resembles civil war,

00:25:19.334 --> 00:25:22.740
that could be on the brink of a
serious civil war,

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.176
and added to that--in other
words, the Athenians,

00:25:26.176 --> 00:25:30.185
who will be sitting in the
assembly passing the laws that

00:25:30.185 --> 00:25:33.980
produce the constitution that
Cleisthenes favors,

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:40.612
are first of all already afraid
that the local aristocrats will

00:25:40.612 --> 00:25:46.553
use force or guile against them.
But on top of that there's been

00:25:46.553 --> 00:25:51.160
two Spartan invasions of Attica
in the last couple of years and

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.172
there's nothing to stop King
Cleomenes from coming back

00:25:55.172 --> 00:25:57.707
again,
because he doesn't like the way

00:25:57.707 --> 00:26:00.539
he's been treated.
In fact, I'd go further;

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:03.719
I'd say there's every reason to
fear that that's going to

00:26:03.719 --> 00:26:06.170
happen.
Again, that's where the analogy

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.737
to the French Revolution works
again, because nothing that

00:26:09.737 --> 00:26:13.430
happens in that most radical
period of the French Revolution

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.334
is understandable.
If you don't know that,

00:26:16.334 --> 00:26:19.964
the French regularly expect
that the kings and emperors of

00:26:19.964 --> 00:26:23.784
Europe will be marching against
them with professional armies

00:26:23.784 --> 00:26:26.439
very soon,
and their fear is absolutely

00:26:26.439 --> 00:26:29.777
justified, and so is the
Athenian fear that the Spartans

00:26:29.777 --> 00:26:33.392
will be coming.
So it's in that hot

00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:38.328
environment, where fear is all
over the place,

00:26:38.328 --> 00:26:44.470
that this new democratic
constitution will be shaped.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:49.202
There's no question that,
I think, the place where it's

00:26:49.202 --> 00:26:53.873
happening is in the assembly.
The assembly sits as you,

00:26:53.873 --> 00:26:57.468
I hope you know,
on a hillside in the middle of

00:26:57.468 --> 00:27:00.301
Athens,
on a hill called the

00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:06.457
pynx and there in the
open air all adult male citizens

00:27:06.457 --> 00:27:11.690
are eligible to participate in
what takes place.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.800
One little point,
I'd also suggest to you,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.351
is what about the people who
have been thrown off the citizen

00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:21.590
lists?
Are they there?

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.900
This is just my reasoning;
we don't have any hard evidence.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.160
My answer is absolutely they
are.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.339
Who is going to tell them not
to?

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:35.910
You show up on the hill,
who's going to kick you off?

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.089
Does Cleisthenes want you
kicked out?

00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:42.668
Hell no, because as we will
see, one of his main planks is

00:27:42.668 --> 00:27:45.640
enrolling those people as
citizens.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.909
So, in fact,
I will bet a lot of money that

00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:50.523
in all the electioneering that
went on about all these

00:27:50.523 --> 00:27:53.290
different things,
they were a group he must have

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.404
targeted and said you've been
unfairly treated by these

00:27:56.404 --> 00:27:58.416
aristocrats.
If I get in power,

00:27:58.416 --> 00:28:02.109
I will see to it that you are
enrolled again as citizens.

00:28:02.109 --> 00:28:05.884
So, all of that is happening,
and people are very excited

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:10.256
about what is going on.
That's the background for these

00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:15.543
rather dry and puzzling details
I'm about to lay on you to try

00:28:15.543 --> 00:28:20.916
to describe what these new laws
were that amounted to some kind

00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:24.907
of a democracy.
The center of them,

00:28:24.907 --> 00:28:30.601
apparently, was reforms of the
tribes, and they are in some

00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:34.373
ways very radical indeed.
As you know,

00:28:34.373 --> 00:28:38.640
these tribes go back before the
birth of history.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.789
Think of any primitive society
you want to;

00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:43.640
it's likely to be divided up
into tribes.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.897
The tribes typically are
alleged to come from some very

00:28:47.897 --> 00:28:51.759
ancient times when gods or
heroes founded them.

00:28:51.759 --> 00:28:54.792
That's certainly true of the
Greek tribes,

00:28:54.792 --> 00:28:58.491
where each tribe is named after
some heroic figure,

00:28:58.491 --> 00:29:01.450
some semi-divine figure in the
past.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.265
So, there are four,
the four traditional Ionian

00:29:04.265 --> 00:29:07.999
tribes, and that's why this is
even more radical than anything

00:29:07.999 --> 00:29:11.926
else.
Cleisthenes' law changes the

00:29:11.926 --> 00:29:18.680
tribal system in Athens from
four tribes to ten tribes,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.139
absolutely brand new things
that have no tradition behind

00:29:22.139 --> 00:29:24.609
them, nothing,
no history or anything.

00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:27.712
Then he has to give names to
these tribes,

00:29:27.712 --> 00:29:31.949
and according to the Greek
practice, these tribes have to

00:29:31.949 --> 00:29:35.430
have some founding hero to be
named after.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:40.040
So, he picks out,
I think I'm right in thinking,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.465
hundred names of heroes and he
assigns them to the ten tribes

00:29:45.465 --> 00:29:48.723
by lot,
and now you suddenly have ten

00:29:48.723 --> 00:29:50.402
new tribes.
Now, I mean,

00:29:50.402 --> 00:29:53.370
if you can try to think
yourself back to a tribal

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.019
society and think about what a
disruptive thing this is.

00:29:57.019 --> 00:30:00.923
All my life I've been a member
of the tribe named after,

00:30:00.923 --> 00:30:05.110
Ion, and so have my ancestors,
and so my other ancestors.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.269
No more.
He's not around anymore;

00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:11.130
there's a new tribe that was
invented that I'm a member of.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:15.440
So, that's a very surprising
thing.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.299
But that's not the end of the
story;

00:30:17.299 --> 00:30:24.000
each tribe now is divided up
into three parts.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.903
The word for a third is
trittys and the plural is

00:30:28.903 --> 00:30:32.470
trittyes,
and here's the point.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:41.173
Each of the tribes has one of
its trittys in and around

00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:48.141
the city of Athens.
It has another one in the

00:30:48.141 --> 00:30:57.354
middle of Athens and it--I'm
sorry, in the middle of Attica

00:30:57.354 --> 00:31:06.250
and the third will be in the
region called the coast,

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:10.777
the Peralia.
So every tribe is

00:31:10.777 --> 00:31:15.045
geographically distributed
across all of Attica,

00:31:15.045 --> 00:31:18.950
in this way that is something
quite new.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:23.285
In the old days we have to
believe that the tribes were

00:31:23.285 --> 00:31:27.300
geographically separated for
regions for tribes.

00:31:33.299 --> 00:31:35.865
The city region,
the coast region,

00:31:35.865 --> 00:31:39.907
and the midland region,
each one of these regions has

00:31:39.907 --> 00:31:44.259
ten trittyes,
one for each of the ten tribes.

00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:50.177
Now, let's take it a step
further, the trittyes

00:31:50.177 --> 00:31:57.099
themselves are formed of units
that are called demes.

00:31:57.099 --> 00:31:59.974
The Greek word for it,
and it's very confusing,

00:31:59.974 --> 00:32:03.337
is demos.
Now, the demos is this

00:32:03.337 --> 00:32:05.960
deme, this political
unit.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.614
It also means a village,
it also means the whole

00:32:10.614 --> 00:32:15.269
Athenian people,
and it also means only the poor

00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:19.079
Athenian people.
So, there you are.

00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:23.157
But in the context that we're
dealing with it here,

00:32:23.157 --> 00:32:27.316
we mean these units that are
geographical and have a

00:32:27.316 --> 00:32:30.824
constitutional function.
There is,

00:32:30.824 --> 00:32:35.345
however, even here a certain
amount of confusion,

00:32:35.345 --> 00:32:39.960
because some of the
demes are actually made

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.160
up of an original village.
They don't mess with that.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.686
A deme is the equivalent
of a--in other words,

00:32:46.686 --> 00:32:49.631
a deme is a deme.
The two different meanings of

00:32:49.631 --> 00:32:52.711
the word deme;
other demes for the

00:32:52.711 --> 00:32:57.470
constitutional purpose are made
up of a number of villages.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.887
So, there would be a lot of
these old demes placed

00:33:00.887 --> 00:33:03.450
into the new constitutional
deme.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:07.647
The idea, however,
is that every trittys

00:33:07.647 --> 00:33:12.210
must be of the same size in
terms of population,

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:17.205
because the whole idea is to
get each tribe to be numerically

00:33:17.205 --> 00:33:20.119
equal and one reason for that
is,

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:24.970
because the tribes will be the
regiments of the Athenian army.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.168
You line up and fight in
your--when you're called to

00:33:28.168 --> 00:33:31.680
fight in the army in accordance
with your deme,

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.948
which is located in the certain
trittys,

00:33:33.948 --> 00:33:38.338
which becomes a regiment.
Your tribe is a regiment of the

00:33:38.338 --> 00:33:41.332
army.
Now, get this straight,

00:33:41.332 --> 00:33:46.047
now the demes are
unequal in population but the

00:33:46.047 --> 00:33:49.250
trittyes have to be
equal,

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.531
so that tells you you have to
have multiple demes in

00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:55.190
some and just one or two or a
few in another.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:11.828
It is also true that the
trittyes are assigned to

00:34:11.828 --> 00:34:15.623
the tribes by lot,
and the thing I want you to

00:34:15.623 --> 00:34:18.622
remember,
and I want to avoid as much

00:34:18.622 --> 00:34:21.934
complication as I can,
is that it doesn't really

00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:25.739
matter to the people who
invented the constitution,

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:30.121
how the demes are assigned to
the trittyes,

00:34:30.121 --> 00:34:34.323
except one scholar has
suggested one motive that

00:34:34.323 --> 00:34:37.989
strikes most of us as very
plausible.

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:42.585
He made a careful study of how
the demes had been

00:34:42.585 --> 00:34:46.428
distributed to the
trittyes and compared

00:34:46.428 --> 00:34:51.860
them with where we know there
were important religious sites.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.342
Greek religion has many
gods and deities and they have

00:34:56.342 --> 00:35:00.626
local characteristics,
because there are legends about

00:35:00.626 --> 00:35:04.800
their having lived on this
earth, at a certain place,

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.035
or done a deed at another place.
So, you have a cave of Pan in

00:35:10.035 --> 00:35:13.619
eastern Attica,
and you have a place where

00:35:13.619 --> 00:35:17.190
Athena did this,
that, and the other thing,

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:21.159
and the point I'm getting at is
these became shrines,

00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:26.131
places where the religion was
exercised in ancient Attica,

00:35:26.131 --> 00:35:29.680
aristocratic Attica.
The aristocrats owned a piece

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.997
of land on which the shrine was,
which meant you had to have

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:35.639
their permission to come onto it
to worship,

00:35:35.639 --> 00:35:38.188
which meant that they would
have predominance,

00:35:38.188 --> 00:35:40.340
power, and influence in these
areas.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:45.944
Well, what this scholar,
David Lewis was his name,

00:35:45.944 --> 00:35:52.806
concluded was that there are
quite a few times when the thing

00:35:52.806 --> 00:36:00.012
is laid out in such a way as to
divide the religious site on the

00:36:00.012 --> 00:36:06.760
aristocrats land from his main
dwelling on that land,

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.315
so the aristocrat is separated
from the place where he has

00:36:11.315 --> 00:36:15.471
religious clout as a way of
dividing up his political

00:36:15.471 --> 00:36:19.503
influence and power.
He reads this as one of the

00:36:19.503 --> 00:36:23.886
ways in which Cleisthenes
attempted to diminish the power

00:36:23.886 --> 00:36:27.800
of the aristocracy through its
local influence.

00:36:31.099 --> 00:36:34.079
Now, this new deme
is very, very important.

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:39.829
It is the basic unit in the
whole system.

00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:41.737
It was meant,
I should say,

00:36:41.737 --> 00:36:44.820
to take the place of the
phratry;

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.299
you remember the brotherhood
that was kernel of the old

00:36:48.299 --> 00:36:50.757
tribal system.
It was meant that the

00:36:50.757 --> 00:36:53.409
deme should be the basic
thing.

00:36:53.409 --> 00:36:56.511
For instance,
one of the most important

00:36:56.511 --> 00:37:00.511
things was that your
citizenship, according to the

00:37:00.511 --> 00:37:04.989
laws of Cleisthenes,
was no longer to be ascertained

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:10.109
by going to your phratry,
but each deme would keep

00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:14.659
an official roll of the citizens
in that deme.

00:37:14.659 --> 00:37:19.086
So, when an Athenian boy is
born, when he reaches a certain

00:37:19.086 --> 00:37:23.969
age, you have to take him to the
deme and register him,

00:37:23.969 --> 00:37:26.929
and now he can be an Athenian
citizen.

00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:31.929
Well, this was one of several
things that we see in

00:37:31.929 --> 00:37:37.929
Cleisthenes' constitution in
which the intention could not be

00:37:37.929 --> 00:37:41.408
carried out.
That is, the phratry,

00:37:41.408 --> 00:37:44.764
and the notion of the
phratry as the core of

00:37:44.764 --> 00:37:47.179
such things, was never
abolished;

00:37:47.179 --> 00:37:50.909
it would have been out of the
question to abolish it.

00:37:50.909 --> 00:37:53.312
It had too many religious
associations,

00:37:53.312 --> 00:37:56.980
and it never really lost its
place in the Athenian mind.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:01.077
Yes, your official enrollment
as a citizen was in the

00:38:01.077 --> 00:38:05.962
deme, but there was still
a tremendous allegiance to the

00:38:05.962 --> 00:38:08.815
phratry,
and the phratry was

00:38:08.815 --> 00:38:13.656
still run by aristocrats.
So, it didn't have its full

00:38:13.656 --> 00:38:17.353
effect.
The deme elected an

00:38:17.353 --> 00:38:20.460
official called a
demarche.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.233
We might call them mayor or
whatever the local official is

00:38:24.233 --> 00:38:28.139
called, select men we say
sometimes still in Connecticut,

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.820
holding to our colonial
traditions.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.097
The deme is also given
religious functions and

00:38:37.097 --> 00:38:39.951
religious rights,
because everybody knows that

00:38:39.951 --> 00:38:43.465
religion still is potent,
even if you're engaged in a

00:38:43.465 --> 00:38:47.190
revolution in Athens at the
beginning of the fifth century.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.239
Here's another thing that they
tried to do.

00:38:55.239 --> 00:38:59.879
Cleisthenes tried with the law,
to change the way in which an

00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:02.739
Athenian was officially
designated.

00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:05.795
It used to be,
before Cleisthenes came along,

00:39:05.795 --> 00:39:11.957
you ask a man who are you.
He would say I am Cleisthenes,

00:39:11.957 --> 00:39:16.667
the son of Megacles.
Just the patronymic,

00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:22.117
just like you bear the name of
your father, unless you chose to

00:39:22.117 --> 00:39:26.208
bear the name of your mother,
which is evidence of how

00:39:26.208 --> 00:39:27.700
un-Athenian you really are.

00:39:31.449 --> 00:39:35.293
So, that's the way it was,
but under the laws of

00:39:35.293 --> 00:39:39.709
Cleisthenes, henceforth,
citizens were to be designated

00:39:39.709 --> 00:39:43.344
not as Cleisthenes,
son of Megacles,

00:39:43.344 --> 00:39:48.935
but as Cleisthenes from
Alopeke, which is to say his

00:39:48.935 --> 00:39:51.952
deme.
He was to be the citizen's

00:39:51.952 --> 00:39:53.370
name and his deme name.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:00.496
People have argued about what
the point of all this was,

00:40:00.496 --> 00:40:04.708
but I think one limited point,
before we get to the full

00:40:04.708 --> 00:40:09.359
story, is simply another way of
cutting down the influence of

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:12.872
birth in the society.
It's a way of damaging the

00:40:12.872 --> 00:40:16.305
aristocratic principle and
asserting in its place--look

00:40:16.305 --> 00:40:20.344
what's really happening here,
that there is something which

00:40:20.344 --> 00:40:24.491
is the polis that has
nothing to do with birth that is

00:40:24.491 --> 00:40:28.570
the part of the legal structure
which is a polis.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.492
It's a whole new concept that's
really creeping in here,

00:40:32.492 --> 00:40:36.700
replacing the old traditional
way of organizing society with

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.193
one that is the work of citizens
coming together and determining

00:40:41.193 --> 00:40:44.260
how they themselves will be
governed.

00:40:48.809 --> 00:40:53.349
Let that be the story of the
tribes for a moment.

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:55.674
Now, here we go with
another council,

00:40:55.674 --> 00:40:58.347
you've heard about the council
of four hundred,

00:40:58.347 --> 00:41:01.370
you've heard about the council
of three hundred.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.071
We can do better than that;
we're going to have the council

00:41:05.071 --> 00:41:08.284
of five hundred.
It will be the council that is

00:41:08.284 --> 00:41:12.463
the democratic council for the
remainder of the history of the

00:41:12.463 --> 00:41:16.302
Athenian democracy,
with the exception of short

00:41:16.302 --> 00:41:20.449
periods of oligarchic rebellion
that remove it,

00:41:20.449 --> 00:41:24.909
but it comes back when the
democracy does.

00:41:24.909 --> 00:41:28.889
That council--let me simply
describe it very briefly.

00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:33.920
It is open to all Athenian
adult male citizens.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:41.018
Membership on the council comes
through some combination of

00:41:41.018 --> 00:41:48.117
allotment and election--the
point of it is that an assembly

00:41:48.117 --> 00:41:54.970
of thousands is not well
equipped to conduct all kinds of

00:41:54.970 --> 00:42:01.580
business that has to be
conducted for the state,

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.697
and even its own business.
You need a smaller group to

00:42:05.697 --> 00:42:09.866
prepare the agenda for a full
assembly meeting,

00:42:09.866 --> 00:42:14.579
and so that was the function of
the five hundred.

00:42:14.579 --> 00:42:18.199
It is, and this is very
important, one of those very

00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:21.226
democratic elements,
the assembly of course was

00:42:21.226 --> 00:42:24.640
totally democratic,
because adult male citizens

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.446
participate if they wish.
But you can easily get around

00:42:28.446 --> 00:42:32.604
that in some degree if you have
a council or little group that

00:42:32.604 --> 00:42:35.740
actually determines what's going
to happen.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:42.436
From the first it wasn't so.
The members of the council had

00:42:42.436 --> 00:42:47.583
to be--I'm sorry,
the council itself was as

00:42:47.583 --> 00:42:53.214
democratic as the assembly.
So, we'll come back to that

00:42:53.214 --> 00:42:56.400
council later on,
but there it is in place.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.696
Another thing that happened,
not in 508-7,

00:42:58.696 --> 00:43:02.170
but a few years down the road,
but still in the same period,

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:07.930
was that by now the army of
Athens, which originally had

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:12.329
been led simply by the
polemarch,

00:43:12.329 --> 00:43:15.756
the archon who was
chosen for the military

00:43:15.756 --> 00:43:19.540
leadership had given way to
generals who commanded the

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:24.095
different tribes.
It used to be that each tribe

00:43:24.095 --> 00:43:29.362
elected its own general,
but in the new system now,

00:43:29.362 --> 00:43:36.210
the entire people elected the
generals for each of the tribes.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.251
In other words,
the ten tribes still had a

00:43:39.251 --> 00:43:42.293
general a piece,
but the entire population

00:43:42.293 --> 00:43:44.469
elected him.
Usually,

00:43:44.469 --> 00:43:48.675
he came from the tribe that he
was asked to command,

00:43:48.675 --> 00:43:51.887
but not always.
Again, you can see what the

00:43:51.887 --> 00:43:55.069
point of this is;
it has the same characteristic

00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:57.639
as so much of what we are
describing.

00:43:57.639 --> 00:44:00.821
It is going to reduce
particularism,

00:44:00.821 --> 00:44:06.092
localism, and make the whole
people, the whole demos

00:44:06.092 --> 00:44:10.546
and their represented
institutions be the decisive

00:44:10.546 --> 00:44:15.244
element in the state.
And that is one of the things

00:44:15.244 --> 00:44:20.043
we'll be getting to right next
to ask ourselves what's going on

00:44:20.043 --> 00:44:24.527
here and why is it happening.
Here, l will tell you what our

00:44:24.527 --> 00:44:28.340
sources say and at the end of
the day we have to make some

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.338
judgments.
Of course,

00:44:30.338 --> 00:44:35.093
generally and I think properly,
the source who gets the most

00:44:35.093 --> 00:44:38.719
credence from scholars today is
Herodotus,

00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:43.113
who is closer to it in time
than, although he's--I should

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:47.349
point out Herodotus is writing
his history sometime,

00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:51.260
and at least he's writing it as
late as the 420s,

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.007
but he himself,
goes back to an earlier part of

00:44:55.007 --> 00:44:59.430
the fifth century.
Therefore, he is in a position

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:04.515
to hear stories from people who
go back even into the sixth

00:45:04.515 --> 00:45:07.092
century,
which makes him theoretically a

00:45:07.092 --> 00:45:09.639
more credible source than people
like Aristotle,

00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:13.736
who I'll be quoting at you,
who lives in the fourth century

00:45:13.736 --> 00:45:17.480
and he's a good whole century
later than Herodotus.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.790
But Herodotus is not,
of course, himself a witness to

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:25.355
any of the facts that he
adduces.Anyway,

00:45:25.355 --> 00:45:30.079
he asks why did Cleisthenes of
Athens do what he did.

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:32.880
And his answer is a pretty
stale one.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.920
He was trying to copy his
ancestor Cleisthenes of Sicyon,

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.871
who also changed the tribes,
you may remember in Sicyon,

00:45:42.871 --> 00:45:47.792
from the old Dorian tribes to
new tribes that designated the

00:45:47.792 --> 00:45:53.129
wrong people like--I mean to say
the Dorians as swine men and ass

00:45:53.129 --> 00:45:56.699
men,
and so on.

00:45:56.699 --> 00:45:59.591
That's why Cleisthenes did it,
and he thought it would be a

00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:02.133
nice thing to do because his
ancestor, his namesake,

00:46:02.133 --> 00:46:05.780
did the same thing.
Well, I don't think we can buy

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.499
that.
We move into a more persuasive

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:12.937
territory I think when we get to
Aristotle, who writes in his

00:46:12.937 --> 00:46:16.858
Politics as follows:
"perhaps a question rather

00:46:16.858 --> 00:46:19.590
arises,"
he's dealing with the whole

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.804
question of citizenship,
"about those who had been

00:46:22.804 --> 00:46:26.869
admitted to citizenship after a
revolution had taken place.

00:46:26.869 --> 00:46:32.067
For instance such a creation of
citizens as that carried out at

00:46:32.067 --> 00:46:36.744
Athens by Cleisthenes,
after the expulsion of the

00:46:36.744 --> 00:46:43.099
tyrants, when he enrolled in his
tribes many resident aliens,

00:46:43.099 --> 00:46:47.521
metics,
who had been foreigners and

00:46:47.521 --> 00:46:50.119
slaves."
So, here's a new story that we

00:46:50.119 --> 00:46:52.802
have to add to the picture,
I mentioned it in passing,

00:46:52.802 --> 00:46:55.284
but it's very important.
One of the things

00:46:55.284 --> 00:46:57.618
Cleisthenes does,
and he has to do it through

00:46:57.618 --> 00:46:59.739
measures passed through the
assembly,

00:46:59.739 --> 00:47:04.047
is to enfranchise the people
who had been thrown off the

00:47:04.047 --> 00:47:05.300
citizen lists.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.985
One thing that you want to do,
and you couldn't have done

00:47:13.985 --> 00:47:17.429
that, given the nature of the
old constitution.

00:47:17.429 --> 00:47:20.746
If you hadn't broken up the old
system of tribes,

00:47:20.746 --> 00:47:22.750
phratres,
and so on,

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.038
and come up with a new one
which would not have the old

00:47:26.038 --> 00:47:29.070
prejudices against it.
So, that's part of the story.

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:33.216
Again, Aristotle or one of his
pupils--there's some dispute

00:47:33.216 --> 00:47:37.147
about the document that is
called the Constitution of

00:47:37.147 --> 00:47:41.129
Athens,
as to whether Aristotle was the

00:47:41.129 --> 00:47:45.539
composer of that piece or one of
his students.

00:47:45.539 --> 00:47:49.544
Anyway, here's what it says,
"with the aim of mixing up the

00:47:49.544 --> 00:47:53.135
population, so that a great
number would share ii the

00:47:53.135 --> 00:47:58.695
citizenship,
they came up with this phrase,

00:47:58.695 --> 00:48:07.309
me phylokrinein, do not
judge according to tribe."

00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:10.695
But it goes beyond tribe,
it really means,

00:48:10.695 --> 00:48:13.750
do not judge on the basis of
birth.

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:19.320
Aristotle says it was
directed against those who

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.579
wanted to check on family
background.

00:48:23.579 --> 00:48:25.916
He goes on to say this new
nomenclature,

00:48:25.916 --> 00:48:29.570
that's what I just mentioned to
you before about your name,

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:34.637
that is, you are not the son of
so and so, but rather you are of

00:48:34.637 --> 00:48:38.622
the deme so and so.
He says, "so that they would

00:48:38.622 --> 00:48:42.521
not by addressing one another by
their father's names and expose

00:48:42.521 --> 00:48:46.278
the newly enrolled citizens,
but would call them by the

00:48:46.278 --> 00:48:50.173
families of the demes."
This passage caused a great

00:48:50.173 --> 00:48:53.642
deal of puzzle and confusion
among scholars who couldn't

00:48:53.642 --> 00:48:56.039
understand what this was all
about,

00:48:56.039 --> 00:48:59.747
and that's I think,
because the topic was mostly

00:48:59.747 --> 00:49:04.710
treated by the British.
But Americans can see this

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:07.101
right away.
The best way to put it is this

00:49:07.101 --> 00:49:08.619
way--of course you wouldn't know
about this.

00:49:08.619 --> 00:49:12.425
You live in a country that is
absolutely pure and without

00:49:12.425 --> 00:49:16.366
prejudice, according to race or
color, or ethnic origins or

00:49:16.366 --> 00:49:18.562
religion;
so you won't know what I'm

00:49:18.562 --> 00:49:22.231
talking about.
But let me pass on from an

00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:27.045
earlier generation,
a darker time in which I

00:49:27.045 --> 00:49:33.428
grew.Suppose you're a man
who came from the Abruzzi in

00:49:33.428 --> 00:49:37.695
Italy,
and your name was Giovanni

00:49:37.695 --> 00:49:41.188
DeStefano.
That was fine in the Abruzzi,

00:49:41.188 --> 00:49:45.375
but in America there were
people that didn't have a high

00:49:45.375 --> 00:49:49.868
opinion of people with such a
name and were likely not to be

00:49:49.868 --> 00:49:53.980
opening their doors or homes to
people like that.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:50:01.100
So, your son instead of calling
himself Giovanni DeStefano

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:06.971
changed his name to John
Stevens, and thereupon,

00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:12.624
everything was okay.
That' the way things were meant

00:50:12.624 --> 00:50:14.901
to be in Athens.
That is to say,

00:50:14.901 --> 00:50:17.473
the idea was if you had a
foreign sounding name,

00:50:17.473 --> 00:50:20.429
and your father would have a
foreign sounding name,

00:50:20.429 --> 00:50:23.440
if he came from a foreign place
when he settled in Attica.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.453
You would be branded in that
way and people who wanted,

00:50:26.453 --> 00:50:30.634
and here it was more specific,
to throw you off the citizen

00:50:30.634 --> 00:50:35.593
lists would know who you were,
but if you took a good solid

00:50:35.593 --> 00:50:39.780
Anglo Athenian name,
why, you'd be all right.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.955
So, I think that is the
explanation and it's all part of

00:50:43.955 --> 00:50:47.426
the same picture.
Taking away the traditional

00:50:47.426 --> 00:50:51.599
influences that would be
anti-democratic and replacing

00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:54.750
them with things that shattered
that,

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:59.757
and taking away the local
powers, anything that smacked of

00:50:59.757 --> 00:51:03.710
the past, you try to erase as
best you can.

00:51:07.489 --> 00:51:10.365
The procedure,
we all agree,

00:51:10.365 --> 00:51:16.650
is by the device that the
Greeks called psephisma.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:22.238
It was a motion passed by the
assembly, and it comes to be the

00:51:22.238 --> 00:51:27.460
standard form of legislation in
the Athenian democracy,

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:31.389
the plural of psephisma
is psephismata.

00:51:31.389 --> 00:51:36.484
Now, the scholar who I was
eluding to a few moments ago

00:51:36.484 --> 00:51:40.349
Lewis, he's got the general
picture right.

00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:43.207
He says we have to understand
all of this was passed on the

00:51:43.207 --> 00:51:45.670
assembly in a mood of great
excitement and fear,

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:51.464
and anger, a revolutionary
situation in which he imagined

00:51:51.464 --> 00:51:54.776
alluding to the revolution in
St.

00:51:54.776 --> 00:51:59.639
Petersburg in 1917,
that they are getting up and

00:51:59.639 --> 00:52:04.400
shouting, "all power to the ten
tribes."

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.802
To those of you who are not in
St.

00:52:06.802 --> 00:52:11.315
Petersburg, they were shouting,
"all power to the Soviets," but

00:52:11.315 --> 00:52:15.260
I think he's wrong.
It wasn't about the ten tribes.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.150
The ten tribes weren't the
issue.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:20.699
I think if they were shouting
and I guess they were,

00:52:20.699 --> 00:52:24.248
they were shouting all power to
the ecclesia,

00:52:24.248 --> 00:52:27.891
to the assembly.
That's where decisions were

00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:32.323
going to be made in the future.
But I do want you to take

00:52:32.323 --> 00:52:36.624
seriously the notion that the
making of such a claim and doing

00:52:36.624 --> 00:52:40.010
so in heated circumstances was
revolutionary,

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:43.856
because without that,
it's inconceivable that what

00:52:43.856 --> 00:52:49.126
happened would have happened.
Now, let me go back to the

00:52:49.126 --> 00:52:52.534
boule;
it was elected by a lot from

00:52:52.534 --> 00:52:56.034
proportional representation in
the demes,

00:52:56.034 --> 00:52:59.474
all Athenians.
The Greek word for preparing

00:52:59.474 --> 00:53:04.134
legislation for an assembly is
probouleusis and such a

00:53:04.134 --> 00:53:09.098
group is probouleutic,
that is, it prepares

00:53:09.098 --> 00:53:13.151
legislation.
The chances are that this

00:53:13.151 --> 00:53:18.814
council was more powerful and
had more independence when it

00:53:18.814 --> 00:53:22.719
was invented,
than it would later on.

00:53:22.719 --> 00:53:25.907
That's just a guess,
but you know you're at the

00:53:25.907 --> 00:53:29.528
beginning of something.
You're still living in a

00:53:29.528 --> 00:53:33.698
society in which class
distinctions are very clear and

00:53:33.698 --> 00:53:36.605
very sharp,
in which the idea of the

00:53:36.605 --> 00:53:41.043
ordinary citizen taking things
into his own hands is new and

00:53:41.043 --> 00:53:43.840
scary.
I think there would have been a

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.738
lot of deference paid to the
individuals who came from the

00:53:47.738 --> 00:53:50.890
higher classes,
and I would guess that they

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:54.234
would have been on the
preliminary list that was

00:53:54.234 --> 00:53:57.650
elected before allotment
selected among them,

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:02.809
and that when they proposed
something to the assembly,

00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:07.775
it would be given greater
influence on what happened

00:54:07.775 --> 00:54:12.691
subsequently than would be true.
When we get down to the

00:54:12.691 --> 00:54:15.932
full scale of Athenian democracy
in the time of Pericles forget

00:54:15.932 --> 00:54:19.354
about it.
The boule is the servant

00:54:19.354 --> 00:54:22.510
of the assembly,
without question.

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.937
If the council sends in a
proposed law in certain

00:54:25.937 --> 00:54:30.435
language, the assembly can vote
it down or they can send it back

00:54:30.435 --> 00:54:34.139
to the boule and say,
no we don't like those words;

00:54:34.139 --> 00:54:36.785
change the words into this
direction, and then send it back

00:54:36.785 --> 00:54:38.658
to us.
That's the way it was in the

00:54:38.658 --> 00:54:42.105
full democracy.
My guess is it wasn't that way

00:54:42.105 --> 00:54:46.013
in the year 505.
I think it probably was meant

00:54:46.013 --> 00:54:50.901
by Cleisthenes to be a bit more
conservative without being,

00:54:50.901 --> 00:54:54.020
of course in any way,
reactionary.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:05.449
Now, what is this all about
in the larger sense?

00:55:05.449 --> 00:55:09.527
Lewis suggests that there's
something here that is personal

00:55:09.527 --> 00:55:12.269
and political and I think he's
right.

00:55:12.269 --> 00:55:17.091
One of the elements that he
suggests is these demes

00:55:17.091 --> 00:55:21.489
were not assigned to
trittyes accidentally,

00:55:21.489 --> 00:55:26.318
as I've suggested already,
but were carefully laid out not

00:55:26.318 --> 00:55:30.977
only to deprive noblemen of
their undue influence but he

00:55:30.977 --> 00:55:35.636
thinks probably to help
Cleisthenes and his Alcmaeonidae

00:55:35.636 --> 00:55:40.634
to have a powerful voice in as
much of Attica as he possibly

00:55:40.634 --> 00:55:43.991
could.
Why in the world would anybody

00:55:43.991 --> 00:55:46.089
doubt that?
That strikes me as

00:55:46.089 --> 00:55:50.187
being--that's what people do
when they have the power to help

00:55:50.187 --> 00:55:53.415
themselves politically they do.
I would guess,

00:55:53.415 --> 00:55:56.390
in other words,
Cleisthenes was thinking of his

00:55:56.390 --> 00:56:00.144
own political position in part.
Again, we don't have hard

00:56:00.144 --> 00:56:02.569
evidence for this,
but just a reasonable

00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:06.010
suggestion.
Now, the other thing is,

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:10.048
we have to, I think,
believe, that this whole

00:56:10.048 --> 00:56:15.647
program of reform was supported
by what we have been referring

00:56:15.647 --> 00:56:18.648
to all along,
the hoplite class,

00:56:18.648 --> 00:56:23.797
these independent farmers.
They are the ones who are most

00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:27.159
numerous.
They are among those who will

00:56:27.159 --> 00:56:31.537
be politically active.
Also, they are of course the

00:56:31.537 --> 00:56:35.888
defense of Athens now,
they have to be taken very

00:56:35.888 --> 00:56:41.418
seriously and they are not about
to allow themselves to be cut

00:56:41.418 --> 00:56:46.312
out or to have their own
influence diminished by things

00:56:46.312 --> 00:56:51.570
that are hanging over from the
days of aristocracy.

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:54.920
So, I think we should think of
this and I think just about

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:58.231
everybody does.
They like to designate this

00:56:58.231 --> 00:57:01.913
Cleisthenic democracy,
this first democracy,

00:57:01.913 --> 00:57:06.365
as a hoplite democracy,
and saying that the hoplites

00:57:06.365 --> 00:57:10.180
were in means that to some
considerable degree,

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:15.090
the poor are out.
The chances are very great;

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:21.426
I would say pretty certain,
that the majority of citizens,

00:57:21.426 --> 00:57:27.540
the majority of Athenian
citizens, were not hoplites.

00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:32.773
They were thetes.
There probably never was a

00:57:32.773 --> 00:57:38.389
time when the hoplites were a
majority even in Athens.

00:57:38.389 --> 00:57:43.054
So, excluding them certainly is
a limit on what you want to call

00:57:43.054 --> 00:57:47.349
democracy, and here's where we
get into sort of the debates

00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:51.512
these days.
Many, many a scholar--now that

00:57:51.512 --> 00:57:57.210
the academy is essentially a
branch of the Politburo will

00:57:57.210 --> 00:58:02.298
want to denigrate ancient
Athenian democracy and to

00:58:02.298 --> 00:58:06.469
suggest it really wasn't
democratic.

00:58:06.469 --> 00:58:08.349
Well, there are twenty million
ways you can do that.

00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:12.389
You can talk about the fact
that it excluded women,

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:16.590
you can talk about the fact
that it--who else does it

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:18.902
exclude?
That it had slaves,

00:58:18.902 --> 00:58:22.011
excluded slaves,
it excluded resident aliens,

00:58:22.011 --> 00:58:26.038
and all those things and then
you can finally point to the

00:58:26.038 --> 00:58:30.419
fact that probably the majority
of the adult male citizens were

00:58:30.419 --> 00:58:34.800
excluded from some important
elements in the democracy,

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.618
although as time passes that
last disappears,

00:58:37.618 --> 00:58:41.013
and you have pretty much
complete participation by the

00:58:41.013 --> 00:58:43.247
poor,
but in Cleisthenes case that's

00:58:43.247 --> 00:58:45.631
not so.
But I think that's to be

00:58:45.631 --> 00:58:48.890
deliberately blind to what's
really happening.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:54.025
What you have is a miracle.
Nothing in the world that we

00:58:54.025 --> 00:58:58.003
know of anywhere,
ever like this has ever been

00:58:58.003 --> 00:59:01.115
seen before.
The reaction of the other

00:59:01.115 --> 00:59:04.329
Greeks as best we can figure out
was horror.

00:59:04.329 --> 00:59:08.302
This is wild and crazy,
the stuff that the Athenians

00:59:08.302 --> 00:59:11.730
are doing, it is radical,
it is dangerous.

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:15.433
We must contain ourselves and
avoid being in touch with them,

00:59:15.433 --> 00:59:18.150
or we should try to finish
those guys off.

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:21.312
Certainly that was the attitude
the Spartans typically had

00:59:21.312 --> 00:59:24.530
towards it, and undoubtedly the
normal Greek government,

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:28.144
which was an oligarchy,
certainly took the same point

00:59:28.144 --> 00:59:30.244
of view.
So, I think you can look at it

00:59:30.244 --> 00:59:32.725
from either direction,
probably should look at it from

00:59:32.725 --> 00:59:35.885
both,
but don't miss the point that

00:59:35.885 --> 00:59:41.360
what's happening here is of this
very special character.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.380
What did they call this
constitution?

00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:46.689
Well, we don't know.
But the chances are great that

00:59:46.689 --> 00:59:49.791
they did not call it democracy.
The word democracy,

00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:53.429
our word democracy comes from
the Greek demokratia,

00:59:53.429 --> 00:59:57.626
which I guess you would want to
translate as something like

00:59:57.626 --> 01:00:00.960
power for the masses,
for the people at large,

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.251
or the people as a whole.
But it was a name that was

01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:07.044
given to the Athenian
constitution by a people who

01:00:07.044 --> 01:00:10.179
didn't like it.
What did they think of

01:00:10.179 --> 01:00:15.142
themselves?
Well, Herodotus refers to this

01:00:15.142 --> 01:00:19.335
regime as one of
eisonomia,

01:00:19.335 --> 01:00:24.660
equality of law,
and I think the thing that's

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:30.170
most important about it is,
equality before the law.

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:35.231
That is, something that wipes
out distinctions among classes

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:39.519
of people on the basis when it
comes to the law.

01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:44.260
Every man who comes before the
law is equal to every other man.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.424
Well, that's a very big change
that no place else in the world

01:00:48.424 --> 01:00:52.179
had, and I think that's not a
bad way to think of it.

01:00:52.179 --> 01:00:57.694
Now, of the principles that
belonged from the first to this

01:00:57.694 --> 01:01:02.052
democracy, and was maybe as
crucial as anything in

01:01:02.052 --> 01:01:07.300
characterizing it was what they
called isegoria,

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:13.207
equality of speech really.
It meant equality of the

01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:16.892
opportunity to address the
political body,

01:01:16.892 --> 01:01:22.541
meaning the assembly.
Every Athenian male from the

01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:29.150
first adult regardless of what
his money rating was,

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:32.640
of his class,
whether he was a thete

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.710
or higher, everyone had the
right to speak in the assembly.

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:41.902
Now, this had been a right that
was limited of course to

01:01:41.902 --> 01:01:45.941
aristocrats in many cities,
or to the wealthy in other

01:01:45.941 --> 01:01:49.691
cities.
But we know from some of the

01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:55.514
poems in the sixth century,
it was prized as the evidence

01:01:55.514 --> 01:02:01.650
that an individual was a free
man as opposed to a slave.

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:05.451
He could get up in the center,
that was the term they used,

01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:08.072
of the town,
meaning wherever the meeting

01:02:08.072 --> 01:02:10.934
place was,
and then speak his mind and

01:02:10.934 --> 01:02:15.183
also try to persuade his fellow
citizens to do as he thought

01:02:15.183 --> 01:02:17.260
best.
We should not take this

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.736
lightly.
In our world,

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:22.643
where we never imagine
ourselves in such a situation,

01:02:22.643 --> 01:02:25.949
it's hard to grasp but actually
to think.

01:02:25.949 --> 01:02:28.775
If I want to I can get out
there during the debate that's

01:02:28.775 --> 01:02:32.889
going to decide what happens.
I can say what I have to say.

01:02:32.889 --> 01:02:39.035
So, freedom of speech is very,
very central to the Athenian

01:02:39.035 --> 01:02:41.790
idea of self government.

01:02:44.889 --> 01:02:50.961
The role of the boule in
place of aristocratic councils

01:02:50.961 --> 01:02:54.762
enhances the democracy.
On the other hand,

01:02:54.762 --> 01:02:58.920
things did not happen that you
might think would happen.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:05.449
Nothing was done in the sphere
of the economy.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:10.179
There was no change in Solonian
classes or privileges.

01:03:10.179 --> 01:03:14.210
You still had to have a certain
amount of money to be elected to

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:17.831
the top things in the state.
The Areopagus was left

01:03:17.831 --> 01:03:21.080
untouched, remaining a
collection of former

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.869
magistrates, all of whom had
been aristocrats.

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:28.043
The phratres,
the homes of aristocracy were

01:03:28.043 --> 01:03:31.716
left intact.
You had this hoplite democracy,

01:03:31.716 --> 01:03:36.090
which was indeed democracy,
but we must imagine,

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:41.108
I think all the evidence would
support this imagination,

01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:45.944
that it was a deferential
democracy in which the lower

01:03:45.944 --> 01:03:51.601
classes still looked up to the
upper classes for leadership and

01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:55.079
guidance,
and they themselves did not

01:03:55.079 --> 01:03:57.969
hold leading positions in the
state.

01:03:57.969 --> 01:04:00.219
I think that's the picture we
have.

01:04:00.219 --> 01:04:05.301
Well, let me turn at last
to one of the most interesting

01:04:05.301 --> 01:04:10.210
features of the constitution
introduced by Cleisthenes;

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:14.346
gives us a picture of how
things worked that we wouldn't

01:04:14.346 --> 01:04:19.195
get any other way.
I'm talking abut the law that

01:04:19.195 --> 01:04:23.656
was passed on ostracism.
Our word ostracism derives from

01:04:23.656 --> 01:04:25.690
it, but it's something quite
different.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:28.818
If somebody says we're going to
ostracize this guy today,

01:04:28.818 --> 01:04:31.780
it means we're not going to
invite him for a drink;

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.210
we're not going to go to his
parties, things like that.

01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:38.117
No this was something far
different and was a central part

01:04:38.117 --> 01:04:41.618
of the political system.
Let me begin by simply

01:04:41.618 --> 01:04:45.517
describing how it worked.
Every year, let us say in the

01:04:45.517 --> 01:04:48.352
month of January,
that's the way the Athenian

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:52.409
calendar would have made it come
out more or less typically,

01:04:52.409 --> 01:04:58.670
a question came up in the
assembly automatically.

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:01.010
Nobody had to move it;
it was an automatic thing.

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:03.920
The question was,
"Shall we have an ostracism

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.482
this year?"
Now, they could debate that

01:05:06.482 --> 01:05:10.140
question, but what they were not
debating was who should we

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.510
ostracize.
That was not at issue.

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:15.320
The only question was,
should we have one this year?

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.969
If a majority said yes,
then they would go on.

01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:21.712
If they majority said no,
that was it,

01:05:21.712 --> 01:05:25.041
no ostracism that year.
But supposing a majority had

01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:29.114
voted for an ostracism,
now we go to roughly the month

01:05:29.114 --> 01:05:33.110
of March and let's go down to
the center of town,

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:35.495
the agora,
which is the marketplace,

01:05:35.495 --> 01:05:38.960
which is the political center
which is where people go to talk

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.115
and all those things.
That's where the action is,

01:05:42.115 --> 01:05:45.650
and for that day and that day
alone, the agora is

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:50.173
fenced off,
and there are ten gates in the

01:05:50.173 --> 01:05:57.179
fences, one for each tribe,
and every citizen who wishes,

01:05:57.179 --> 01:06:03.059
goes with a piece of broken
pottery.

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:07.813
Someone has described it as the
scrap paper of antiquity,

01:06:07.813 --> 01:06:10.699
and with whatever you could
get,

01:06:10.699 --> 01:06:14.000
piece of glass,
crayon, or whatever,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.845
you would simply write the name
of a man that you would like to

01:06:19.845 --> 01:06:24.510
see ostracized that year.
You would go to the gate.

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:27.678
There would be some people at
the gate, who would identify are

01:06:27.678 --> 01:06:30.274
you really a citizen,
where are you coming from and

01:06:30.274 --> 01:06:32.433
all that.
You, then, handed in your

01:06:32.433 --> 01:06:35.579
ostraka and you went
inside the agora,

01:06:35.579 --> 01:06:38.414
where you stayed until the
voting was over so that you

01:06:38.414 --> 01:06:40.340
couldn't come back and vote
again.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:46.210
Now, they were cleverer than
the people of Florida are today.

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:49.530
So, now it's over,
the time has come,

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:54.592
and what they do is they divide
up all the ostraka that

01:06:54.592 --> 01:06:58.256
have been cast.
They don't divide them up I'm

01:06:58.256 --> 01:07:00.576
sorry.
They put them in a big pile and

01:07:00.576 --> 01:07:04.535
count them.
If there are fewer than 6,000

01:07:04.535 --> 01:07:10.586
ballots, nobody gets ostracized.
If there are 6,000 or more,

01:07:10.586 --> 01:07:15.713
now they divide them up into
piles, and the one who gets the

01:07:15.713 --> 01:07:18.570
most votes,
not majority,

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:23.871
just the highest number of
votes plurality,

01:07:23.871 --> 01:07:27.394
he wins.
He gets ostracized.What

01:07:27.394 --> 01:07:31.585
does that mean?
It means that he must leave

01:07:31.585 --> 01:07:37.870
Attica, at a certain distance
from Attica, for ten years.

01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:43.639
That's all.
He has been accused of no crime;

01:07:43.639 --> 01:07:47.640
therefore, he has been
convicted of no crime.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:51.920
Nothing is done to his property;
nothing is done to his family.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.877
At the end of ten years,
he may come back and it's as

01:07:56.877 --> 01:07:59.724
though he never left.
The next day,

01:07:59.724 --> 01:08:02.040
if he wants to,
he can run for public office.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.120
That's all;
that is ostracism.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.692
What's this all about?
What are the purposes of this

01:08:10.692 --> 01:08:13.848
thing?
Well, I think the best way to

01:08:13.848 --> 01:08:19.117
come at this is to tell you a
couple of stories and some

01:08:19.117 --> 01:08:22.100
facts.
The story I guess comes from

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.751
Plutarch's Life of
Aristides,

01:08:24.751 --> 01:08:28.841
who is one of the leading
Athenian figures at the early

01:08:28.841 --> 01:08:33.447
part of the fifth century,
and who in fact was a man who

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:37.079
was ultimately ostracized.
The story goes like this.

01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:41.972
It's ostracism day in Athens,
and some country bumpkin,

01:08:41.972 --> 01:08:46.787
some rube comes walking up,
and he spots Aristides chatting

01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:50.810
with some folks and he goes up
to Aristides and he says,

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:55.070
"excuse me sir I don't know how
to write, would you please write

01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:58.565
a name on this potsherd for me?"
Aristides, of course,

01:08:58.565 --> 01:09:00.558
a gentleman he says,
"certainly sir,

01:09:00.558 --> 01:09:05.369
what name would you like?"
He said, "Aristides please."

01:09:05.369 --> 01:09:08.545
"Oh," he says,
and he writes down Aristides,

01:09:08.545 --> 01:09:12.091
and by the way he said,
"what is it that you have

01:09:12.091 --> 01:09:16.074
against Aristides?"
I should have told you that

01:09:16.074 --> 01:09:19.627
Aristides had earned this
sobriquet,

01:09:19.627 --> 01:09:23.180
the just Aristides,
Aristides the just.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.509
So, the guy says,
"what have you got against

01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:26.846
Aristides?
I have nothing against

01:09:26.846 --> 01:09:28.470
Aristides, I've never seen the
man, don't know him.

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:34.319
I'm just so damn tired of
hearing him called the just."

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:39.788
The point of that story is to
illustrate Plutarch's point is

01:09:39.788 --> 01:09:44.699
that the system of ostracism was
just a piece of silly

01:09:44.699 --> 01:09:49.890
foolishness that you would
associate with democracy,

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:54.231
which just allowed the jealousy
of the ordinary man for superior

01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:56.850
people to determine what's going
on.

01:09:56.850 --> 01:10:01.170
That's the message that
Plutarch gets from that tale.

01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:02.350
Here's another piece of
information;

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:05.308
that's not a tale.
I think it was about 1937,1938

01:10:05.308 --> 01:10:09.310
an American archaeologist was
working up on the north slope of

01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:12.000
the Acropolis and he came upon a
well,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.951
he dug into the well,
and out came 191 inscribed

01:10:17.951 --> 01:10:25.550
potsherds, ostraka with
but one name written on all of

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:29.934
them,
and that name was Themistocles,

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:36.214
who we know was a participant
in a batch of ostraka in

01:10:36.214 --> 01:10:39.805
the 480s,
and careful analysis of the

01:10:39.805 --> 01:10:44.563
handwriting indicated that these
191 ostraka were

01:10:44.563 --> 01:10:47.850
inscribed by 14 hands writing
them.

01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:51.615
Is it beginning to sound
familiar to you guys,

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:54.435
I suppose.
The best guess of everybody who

01:10:54.435 --> 01:10:58.067
studies these things is that we
do not have here the remains of

01:10:58.067 --> 01:11:01.662
a collection of voters,
who voted and had their votes

01:11:01.662 --> 01:11:05.522
counted and then these came,
but rather that these were

01:11:05.522 --> 01:11:08.310
votes that never were cast
actually.

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:13.880
So what's going on here?
Now, I turn from my attempt at

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:18.640
a factual account of what
happened in the past to fiction.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.329
The rest of this is my
imagination.

01:11:21.329 --> 01:11:25.089
We find ourselves down the
middle of Athens,

01:11:25.089 --> 01:11:31.384
the day before the ostracism.
We are in the home of John the

01:11:31.384 --> 01:11:39.029
potter who is a charter member
of the Aristides political club,

01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:45.121
and what they are doing is
sitting about chatting as they

01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:50.560
incise or paint the name onto a
ostrakon,

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:55.202
the name is Themistocles.
Next day, down there outside

01:11:55.202 --> 01:11:59.372
the Agora, various country
bumpkins and others are

01:11:59.372 --> 01:12:03.824
wandering into town.
You step up to one of them and

01:12:03.824 --> 01:12:05.853
say;
perhaps you would like to vote

01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:08.968
in the ostracism today sir?
I can save you the trouble of

01:12:08.968 --> 01:12:11.520
inscribing your ballot,
here's one right now.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.634
I think this is pretty good
evidence that they're talking

01:12:15.634 --> 01:12:18.500
about organized political
activities,

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:26.051
which in fact I think totally
squares with what we know about

01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:30.952
the purpose of ostracism.
I should tell you one other

01:12:30.952 --> 01:12:33.811
thing, that Thucydides himself
says something very important

01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:36.450
about this.
He says, ostracism was brought

01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:39.915
about, because of the fear and
the insecurity that the

01:12:39.915 --> 01:12:42.529
Athenians felt about their
democracy,

01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:46.230
that it was in constant danger,
and that they needed something

01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:48.924
to help them.
That's the context in which he

01:12:48.924 --> 01:12:50.800
used it.
Plutarch, as I say,

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.611
has a more general story,
the envy and jealousy natural

01:12:54.611 --> 01:12:57.316
to democracy.
You must realize that hardly

01:12:57.316 --> 01:13:00.807
anybody who ever wrote anything
in antiquity had a kind word to

01:13:00.807 --> 01:13:04.137
say for democracy;
it's a bad thing from the

01:13:04.137 --> 01:13:08.260
standpoint of most of the
authors of antiquity.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:13.459
But Thucydides was there,
while ostracism was a reality,

01:13:13.459 --> 01:13:18.279
as opposed to Plutarch,
and I'm sure he is right.

01:13:18.279 --> 01:13:20.996
Let's look,
first of all,

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:26.331
at the moment when ostracism
was invented in the time of

01:13:26.331 --> 01:13:30.600
Cleisthenes, before we move
beyond that.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.804
What's the situation?
Cleisthenes and company have

01:13:33.804 --> 01:13:37.313
just brought about this unique,
amazing, and to the rest of the

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:39.859
world dangerous coup
d'état,

01:13:39.859 --> 01:13:43.130
and invented this new wild
crazy kind of government.

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:48.873
They know that the Spartans are
furious and they expect they're

01:13:48.873 --> 01:13:54.180
going to come down anytime.
They also know that in Athens,

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.810
there are people who don't like
this new government.

01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:03.390
Some of them are the heirs to
the old aristocracy.

01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:07.180
Some of them are aristocrats
themselves.

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:12.399
Others were very happy in the
days of the tyranny.

01:14:12.399 --> 01:14:16.765
In fact, there are still
relatives of the tyrants,

01:14:16.765 --> 01:14:20.329
eminent ones,
who are still in Athens.

01:14:20.329 --> 01:14:23.158
In other words,
they have to fear betrayal,

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:27.063
they have to fear internal
hostility, and they have to fear

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:29.689
people who might start a civil
war.

01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:33.804
At the same time as they have
to be afraid of the Spartans

01:14:33.804 --> 01:14:36.054
coming up the road,
and we know,

01:14:36.054 --> 01:14:38.870
because in a few years this is
going to happen,

01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:41.869
they have enemies of other
neighboring states.

01:14:41.869 --> 01:14:44.123
Corinthians,
the Eretrians,

01:14:44.123 --> 01:14:48.369
Boeotians, Thebes,
and others within the next five

01:14:48.369 --> 01:14:53.569
years--they will have invasions
by those people as well.

01:14:53.569 --> 01:14:56.939
That's their situation,
what are they afraid of?

01:14:56.939 --> 01:15:01.494
They are afraid that there will
be treason inside the city,

01:15:01.494 --> 01:15:05.813
which will help invaders or
simply turn the city over to

01:15:05.813 --> 01:15:07.971
them.
Well then, why don't they just

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:10.272
lock these guys up?
Well, in the first place,

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:12.351
they probably haven't done
anything yet,

01:15:12.351 --> 01:15:14.750
and you couldn't make a case
against them.

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.907
On top of which,
you really don't,

01:15:16.907 --> 01:15:20.305
if you're Cleisthenes,
you don't want to treat all of

01:15:20.305 --> 01:15:24.619
these people as though they are
the enemies of the new regime.

01:15:24.619 --> 01:15:27.273
They are, in fact,
natural opponents,

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:31.180
the friends of the tyrants and
the old aristocrats;

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.430
they're on opposite sides of
the argument.

01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:38.351
Why would you want to put them
together by assaulting their

01:15:38.351 --> 01:15:41.824
leaders?
A smarter thing would be to try

01:15:41.824 --> 01:15:46.735
to win over one faction to
support your side at the expense

01:15:46.735 --> 01:15:49.897
of the other.
That is my guess as to what is

01:15:49.897 --> 01:15:52.670
another explanation of what's
happening here.

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:55.210
So, here's another piece of
fiction I want to throw at you.

01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:02.361
I imagine that Cleisthenes
stops by at the house of

01:16:02.361 --> 01:16:07.135
Hipparchus, the son of Karmas,
who is a relative of the

01:16:07.135 --> 01:16:12.613
Peisistratids and who would be
looked to as the leading figure

01:16:12.613 --> 01:16:16.209
in that faction,
and he stops by to see

01:16:16.209 --> 01:16:20.760
Hipparchus, and Hipparchus says,
"hello Cleisthenes,

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.553
say what is this routine,
what is this crazy new law that

01:16:23.553 --> 01:16:25.400
you and your boys just put
through,

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.823
this ostracism law?
I hear in the streets that it's

01:16:29.823 --> 01:16:34.855
aimed at me, as the leader of
the old tyranny faction,

01:16:34.855 --> 01:16:38.093
what is that?"
Cleisthenes I imagine would

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:41.279
say, "Now, where did you get a
crazy idea like that?

01:16:41.279 --> 01:16:44.447
I mean, you're a swell fellow,
I'm only against these terrible

01:16:44.447 --> 01:16:47.069
aristos out there,
and their Spartan lackeys,

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.882
who are going to take away all
the people's rights and I know

01:16:49.882 --> 01:16:51.570
you wouldn't want that to
happen,

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:55.800
that's not like you.
So, of course I can see your

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:00.410
point, I can see you are
alarmed, I can see that people

01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:04.152
might say,
gee those old Peisistratids

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:08.930
might be trying to overthrow
this new democracy,

01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:12.553
and bring themselves back in.
I know Hippeis is over there in

01:17:12.553 --> 01:17:15.886
Persia, supported by the king
and maybe people would think

01:17:15.886 --> 01:17:18.460
you're for bringing him back as
a tyrant.

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:22.337
I knew that would never be in
your mind, but I tell you what

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:25.021
you ought to do,
why don't you come over to my

01:17:25.021 --> 01:17:27.610
side and I'll see to it--you
know I have friends,

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:30.420
I got a lot of friends.
I could do you a favor.

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:35.310
You do me a favor;
I can do you a favor.

01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:38.075
I can see to it that I would
just kill that rumor,

01:17:38.075 --> 01:17:40.220
and everything would be very
happy."

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:44.251
The next day all is well.
I think there's considerable

01:17:44.251 --> 01:17:46.630
evidence.
I don't have time for it

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:50.005
now--not certain,
but evidence suggesting that

01:17:50.005 --> 01:17:54.430
Hipparchus came on board and
became part of a coalition that

01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:57.880
ruled Athens for decades after
that time.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.710
And so, that year there was no
ostracism, because there didn't

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:07.409
have to be an ostracism.
I think that is very important.

01:18:07.409 --> 01:18:12.707
Most years there was no
ostracism, only once in a while,

01:18:12.707 --> 01:18:18.487
and every single person that we
hear ostracized was a leading

01:18:18.487 --> 01:18:22.229
political figure.
Ostracism, in short,

01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:26.443
was meant to be a
constitutional device to work in

01:18:26.443 --> 01:18:30.742
the political realm as a way of
deterring a coup

01:18:30.742 --> 01:18:34.613
d'état,
treason or other forms of

01:18:34.613 --> 01:18:37.208
unrest.
You could only use it as a

01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:40.649
politician if you were the
popular favorite.

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:44.036
If you were confident that the
ostracism would go your way,

01:18:44.036 --> 01:18:46.840
if you held an ostracism and
that wasn't true,

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.165
you might find yourself
traveling a long way from home

01:18:50.165 --> 01:18:53.931
pretty soon, and so that's the
essence of ostracism and we'll

01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:57.821
have a look at it again because
it crops up and is used but not

01:18:57.821 --> 01:19:00.520
for twenty years after it's
invented.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.520
Okay.

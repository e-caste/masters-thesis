00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.571
Prof: So I'm going to
talk about what led up to the

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.844
crisis and how the crisis makes
us realize that the things about

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:10.857
the theory that we've been
learning all semester that ought

00:00:10.857 --> 00:00:14.058
to be slightly different,
and I've been working on a new

00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:16.470
version of the theory for the
last ten years,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.036
what I call the Leverage Cycle,
which I have to say didn't get

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:22.200
very much attention ten years
ago,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.130
but which now seems to be,
I don't know,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.050
it seems to be getting more
attention.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.830
It's almost like life imitated
art, really.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.164
It couldn't have turned out
more like the theory than I

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:38.930
would have expected.
 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.733
So I'm going to tell you the
facts and then try to fit a

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.563
theory to it,
and probably will spill over

00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:48.364
until Thursday,
and I think Thursday I won't

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:50.370
spend that much time finishing.
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.632
I'll have a review class if
anyone's interested for the

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:54.660
whole material.
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.978
And I think when you see the
critique of the theory it might

00:00:56.978 --> 00:00:59.140
help put the theory in a little
bit more perspective.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.713
But anyway, nothing of what I
say these last two days you

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:03.600
should feel is going to be on
the exam.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.599
It's just more information that
you might find interesting.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.601
So we talked last time,
remember, at one of those

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:13.040
special classes about the
sub-prime mortgage market,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.489
and the idea was that you would
pool together a bunch of loans.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.620
These are the--I can do this,
I guess.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.590
You'd pool together a bunch of
individual mortgages like this,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.959
and then you'd put them in a
giant pool,

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.438
and then cut the pool up into a
triple-A bond,

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:30.134
a double-A bond,
a single-A bond,

00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:32.129
a triple-B bond,
and this is the over

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:33.910
collateralization and the
residual.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.599
And I'm not going to go through
the whole structure,

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.447
but suffice it to say that the
idea of this is you take

00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:40.610
individual loans which are very
risky,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.465
after all these are sub-prime
borrowers so everyone knew that

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:46.533
they were risky,
and you create what's supposed

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.769
to be an incredibly safe bond.
 

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:52.931
The definition of triple-A bond
is that it has a 1 in 100 chance

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:56.828
of going bankrupt in 10 years,
of losing any principal in 10

00:01:56.828 --> 00:01:57.489
years.
 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:59.489
That was the definition they
claimed.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.799
I heard a talk about power
failures last night,

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.292
by the way, the power grid
which went out all across from

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:11.508
Cleveland to Manhattan in 2003,
and they said that was an event

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:13.430
that should happen once every 10
years.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.310
And then when you hear what
happened in the event,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.858
someone didn't trim a tree,
and the line sagged into the

00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:21.842
tree,
and so then it shut itself off,

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:24.274
and then the city next door
they had the same problem with

00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:26.830
someone not trimming a tree,
and that line shut off,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.681
and once you have two or three
lines shut off the system

00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:31.080
automatically goes down.
 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.716
It seems like it could happen
much more often than once every

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:34.199
10 years.
 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.280
But anyway, it's the same thing
here.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.101
This is supposed to be once
every 10 years,

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:42.460
1 in 100 chance,
and it happened in a giant way.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.210
So the idea of the triple-A,
so they're supposed to very

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.210
safe because if the first house
defaults,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.116
the first homeowner defaults,
instead of paying back the 100

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:54.527
he owes,
let's say he just stops paying,

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:57.300
and then you throw the guy out
of the house,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.780
but then you get to sell the
house.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.658
The house is there as
collateral for the loan.

00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:03.530
Now, the loan should have been
100.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.788
The house should have been
worth much more than the 100.

00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:07.378
That's why it should have been
collateral.

00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:11.181
So you should have had 120
dollars of the house to sell so

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:15.117
even if the house went down by
33 percent to 80 that's still

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:18.623
only a 20 dollar loss,
or let's say 20 cent loss on

00:03:18.623 --> 00:03:21.604
the dollar loan,
and that 20 cents comes out of

00:03:21.604 --> 00:03:22.860
the triple-B piece.
 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.938
So you notice how many losses
do you have to have if you're

00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:28.979
losing 20 cents on a house?
 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.276
To have 5 dollars worth of
losses you've got to have 25 of

00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:36.006
the 100 houses go down,
and another 25 of the houses

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:38.788
have to go down to lose this
one,

00:03:38.788 --> 00:03:41.110
and then another whole bunch of
them,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.150
35 more to go down.
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.956
So you've got to have like 85
houses going down before you

00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:48.371
touch the triple-A,
because the losses always come

00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:50.440
from the bottom and work their
way up.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.299
So when they made these deals
they thought it was

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.455
inconceivable that you'd have 85
percent of the houses

00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:58.848
defaulting,
or that you'd lose so much more

00:03:58.848 --> 00:04:01.542
than 20 percent on each house
because things like that just

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:02.750
hadn't happened before.
 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.949
And so it seemed like they were
incredibly safe.

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.330
So that was the structure.
 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.736
And the idea,
again, was to take risky

00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:14.510
securities and by securitizing
them create a whole bunch of

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.180
apparently perfectly safe
securities.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.149
Because, as we said,
the goal of most investors is

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.120
to invest in something that's
completely safe,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.524
they don't have to worry about
getting more in one state or

00:04:25.524 --> 00:04:26.519
more in another state.
 

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:30.019
And this seemed like an
ingenious way of turning 1

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.949
trillion dollars of very risky
sub-prime loans into,

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.714
this is 81 percent,
into 800 billion of very safe

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:41.480
bonds and maybe riskier bonds
down below that.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.668
So you could never find 1
trillion dollars worth of people

00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:47.019
willing to lend to sub-prime
borrowers,

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.600
but you didn't have to after
the securitization,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.723
because 800 billion of the
loans to them were by people who

00:04:52.723 --> 00:04:54.610
thought they were perfectly
safe.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.119
You only had the guys buying
these bonds down here who

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:59.440
thought that they were running a
very big risk.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.389
So the whole idea of
securitization,

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:08.110
the whole idea of the American
financial system was to--

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.319
well, let's see what the whole
idea was,

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.509
was to create as many safe
loans as possible.

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.750
So you could put it a little
bit more generally.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.819
I should have had this picture
before.

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:26.639
You could say if the states of
the world--

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.255
if you're here today and you
might have many of these

00:05:29.255 --> 00:05:31.370
different states of the world
tomorrow,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.528
some people know that they're
going to be rich in some states

00:05:34.528 --> 00:05:35.949
and poor in other states.
 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.449
What they'd like to do is get
the same amount in every state.

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.029
They can do that by directly
buying safe bonds.

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:44.360
That's what everybody's trying
to do.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.583
They're trying to hedge
themselves to get completely

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:47.149
safe bonds.
 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:50.478
Most people don't know how to
hedge so the financial system

00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:52.199
creates safe bonds for them.
 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.709
Other people,
they do know how to hedge,

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.651
but their cash flows are
different in the different

00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:59.177
states because,
for example,

00:05:59.177 --> 00:06:01.399
they run a business and if
interest rates go up that might

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.528
be bad for their business.
 

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.565
If interest rates go down it
might be good for their

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:06.680
business, so they've got
different amounts of money in

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.680
the different states.
 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.802
And then to create hedging
instruments for these people

00:06:10.802 --> 00:06:14.329
you'd like to create securities
that pay a lot in states where

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:17.278
they want the money so that way
they can buy hedging

00:06:17.278 --> 00:06:18.319
instruments.
 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:23.295
So the purpose of the financial
system is to create cash flows

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:26.069
in states that people want them.
 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.738
For the majority of people
that's the same thing in every

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:29.120
state.
 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.120
For other people it's something
like the Arrow securities.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.733
So they can buy money in the
states when they're running

00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:36.259
short.
 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.060
And why is this connected to
mortgages,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.339
because how do you know that
anyone's going to keep their

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.540
promise to deliver money in
those different states,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.076
or money in every state,
how do you know the people

00:06:47.076 --> 00:06:50.259
making the promise will keep
their promise?

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:51.259
Well, you don't.
 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.711
That's why you need collateral,
and the best collateral in the

00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.069
country is the houses.
 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:58.759
So the purpose of the financial
system,

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:01.504
as we said all through the
course, is to create securities

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.720
that pay off in different states
of nature,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.850
of the type people want,
and that are guaranteed,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.329
so that people keep their
promises,

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:11.170
guaranteed by collateral.
 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.605
Houses as the best collateral
made it inevitable that the most

00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:17.872
sophisticated part of the market
was going to turn into the

00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:19.000
mortgage market.
 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.161
So at first glance you would
think the most complicated part

00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:24.519
of the market is the stock
market, but no.

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:26.629
It turns out that collateral is
the key,

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:30.142
because without guaranteeing a
promise the promise isn't really

00:07:30.142 --> 00:07:33.103
very good,
and so houses are the best

00:07:33.103 --> 00:07:34.129
collateral.
 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:36.992
So we'll see now that the
change in the theory that I want

00:07:36.992 --> 00:07:40.105
to describe is what happens when
you suppose people might break

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:43.319
their promises and you have to
take into account collateral.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:45.370
All right, but let's get back
to the facts.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.732
So there were 1 trillion
dollars of these sub-prime

00:07:48.732 --> 00:07:50.009
mortgages around.
 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:51.040
So then what happened?
 

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.639
I want to skip through this
pretty quickly.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.617
People thought that it might be
dangerous and they wrote

00:07:57.617 --> 00:07:59.730
insurance on the sub-prime
mortgages.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.389
So an insurance on a sub-prime
mortgage,

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:06.904
CDS, Credit Default Swap,
would say if 1 dollar of the

00:08:06.904 --> 00:08:10.740
principal of the triple-B bond
disappears,

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.639
and we saw how that could
happen, you take one homeowner

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.863
who loses 20 cents,
I mean, that will come out of

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:17.468
this first,
but after all this stuff is

00:08:17.468 --> 00:08:19.843
wiped out,
20 cents of the losses because

00:08:19.843 --> 00:08:23.779
the homeowner instead of paying
his dollar doesn't pay it all.

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:24.480
The house is sold.
 

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.346
You only get 80 cents back,
that 20 cents comes out of the

00:08:28.346 --> 00:08:31.175
triple-B,
so the insurance would then

00:08:31.175 --> 00:08:35.206
say--the buyer of insurance
would get to collect the 20

00:08:35.206 --> 00:08:35.879
cents.
 

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:39.490
So this seemed like another way
for people even in the BBB range

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.210
to guarantee their payments.
 

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.317
Well, it turned out that the
writers of insurance didn't just

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:50.658
write 20 cents in case there was
a 20 cent loss,

00:08:50.658 --> 00:08:55.178
they might write 10 dollars of
insurance on the 20 cent loss.

00:08:55.178 --> 00:08:59.807
So these Credit Default Swaps
are getting very close to Arrow

00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:00.808
securities.
 

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:04.832
So the theoretically inclined
economists who didn't think very

00:09:04.832 --> 00:09:07.668
far ahead in the Clinton
Administration,

00:09:07.668 --> 00:09:10.259
namely Larry Summers and people
like that,

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.924
Bob Rubin, they were ecstatic
about these Credit Default Swaps

00:09:13.924 --> 00:09:17.230
because to them it reminded them
of Arrow securities.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.745
And they thought,
my gosh, the market is coming

00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:22.590
close to creating Arrow
securities and isn't it great

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.653
that people will now be able to
hedge much better because

00:09:25.653 --> 00:09:28.990
they've got these Arrow
securities that they can trade.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.090
Now, problem was that who's
writing the insurance?

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.765
The people writing the
insurance are big banks and

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:35.750
people like AIG.
 

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.399
So they're saying if you lose
20 cents we'll pay the

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:40.259
insurance.
 

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:43.038
Now, of course,
that's a promise just like the

00:09:43.038 --> 00:09:46.928
promise to repay is and that
should have been collateralized.

00:09:46.928 --> 00:09:50.869
The trouble is that when AIG as
a triple-A rated company wrote

00:09:50.869 --> 00:09:54.743
its promises many of the people
who bought the insurance just

00:09:54.743 --> 00:09:58.489
figured that's such a great
company it's obviously going to

00:09:58.489 --> 00:10:01.116
have the money,
probably isn't going to happen

00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:03.655
anyway,
so I'm not going to worry about

00:10:03.655 --> 00:10:06.253
the collateral,
and they managed to make all of

00:10:06.253 --> 00:10:09.014
these promises without putting
up collateral to guarantee that

00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:10.870
they are going to keep their
promises.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.288
This mistake that people make,
"Well,

00:10:13.288 --> 00:10:14.981
it's probably not going to
happen anyway that we're going

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:16.038
to even collect the
insurance,"

00:10:16.038 --> 00:10:17.792
you shouldn't have bought the
insurance if you didn't think

00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:18.850
you were going to collect it.
 

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.482
So obviously,
even though it's a low

00:10:20.482 --> 00:10:22.582
probability event,
you have to think what will

00:10:22.582 --> 00:10:25.149
happen when it comes time to
collect the insurance.

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:26.950
Are they going to have the
money?

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.037
Now, many banks in Europe
bought these things and they are

00:10:31.037 --> 00:10:35.340
accused of having realized that
they wouldn't be paid off.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.524
They only bought it so they
could convince their regulators

00:10:38.524 --> 00:10:41.817
that they actually had a very
sound bank and therefore didn't

00:10:41.817 --> 00:10:45.046
have to set aside capital,
and they knew very well that

00:10:45.046 --> 00:10:47.009
they probably wouldn't be paid
off.

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:50.043
They just didn't think that it
mattered because things wouldn't

00:10:50.043 --> 00:10:50.730
go that bad.
 

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.498
So in any case,
to circle back,

00:10:52.498 --> 00:10:55.856
we've got these sub-prime
mortgages where you've written a

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:57.918
bunch of apparently safe bonds.
 

00:10:57.918 --> 00:10:59.866
A lot of people,
but not many,

00:10:59.866 --> 00:11:02.418
20 percent holding dangerous
bonds,

00:11:02.418 --> 00:11:04.350
realizing that they're
dangerous, and you've got a

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.440
bunch of insurance written on
the dangerous bonds,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.272
but of a much bigger,
five times as big as the amount

00:11:10.272 --> 00:11:11.820
of dangerous bonds.
 

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.509
If something goes wrong with
that pool these bonds are going

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:19.451
to lose and then the writers of
insurance are also going to lose

00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:21.139
a huge amount of money.
 

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:25.028
So what happened?
 

00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:30.504
Well, on top of that there was
a CDO market where you took the

00:11:30.504 --> 00:11:35.711
triple-B pieces and broke those
up like you did before into

00:11:35.711 --> 00:11:38.570
bonds,
more triple-A's and so on.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.164
So if something happened to
this original pool and a lot of

00:11:42.164 --> 00:11:45.326
homes started defaulting that
would wipe out all the

00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:48.860
triple-B's forcing all these
people to pay insurance.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.620
And on top of that the CDO
market which is just the same

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.407
thing done again,
but using the triple-B's as

00:11:55.407 --> 00:11:57.629
collateral,
all these things would get

00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:00.059
wiped out including the
triple-A's here.

00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:01.379
And then that wasn't enough.
 

00:12:01.379 --> 00:12:05.244
Wall Street then wrote
CDO-squareds on the triple-B and

00:12:05.244 --> 00:12:06.889
A pieces of the CDOs.
 

00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:08.639
All right, so we talked all
about this last time.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:12.250
So now I want to get into what
happened.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:12.929
Any questions?
 

00:12:12.929 --> 00:12:13.658
Yes?
 

00:12:13.658 --> 00:12:17.009
Student: So when these
were being securitized like the

00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:20.304
triple-A is there any way to
distinguish on paper the normal

00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:23.879
triple-A's and the triple-A's
derived from like triple-B's,

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:25.767
for example,
or are all triple-A's just the

00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:27.879
same and there is no way to
distinguish them?

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:29.908
Prof: No,
a buyer knows very well where

00:12:29.908 --> 00:12:31.259
his triple-A is coming from.
 

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:33.580
A buyer has access to all--so
if you were a buyer--

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.389
the hedge fund I work with,
Ellington,

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:38.720
was a big buyer of these kinds
of things,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.230
and also you'll see what our
strategy was,

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:49.000
but we knew very well that--so
let's go back to this.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.477
We were a big buyer of things
here, like these triple-B's we

00:12:52.477 --> 00:12:53.538
bought a lot of.
 

00:12:53.538 --> 00:12:56.936
So we could get for every
single home in this pool we knew

00:12:56.936 --> 00:12:59.568
the history,
we know the loan to value,

00:12:59.568 --> 00:13:03.076
the income of the borrower,
what zip code the borrower

00:13:03.076 --> 00:13:03.678
lives in.
 

00:13:03.678 --> 00:13:06.405
We know a tremendous amount of
information about each one of

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:08.625
these individual houses,
how they've paid before,

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:10.519
what kind of credit rating they
have.

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:13.615
All that information we have,
and so we build the model of

00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:16.711
how reliable we think these
borrowers are and what they're

00:13:16.711 --> 00:13:17.580
going to do.
 

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.408
And so on the basis of that
information we can predict what

00:13:20.408 --> 00:13:22.750
we think the value of the BBB is
going to be,

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.178
and whether it makes sense to
buy insurance on it or not.

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:28.750
So what was our strategy,
by the way, in our hedge fund?

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.284
Our strategy was,
take a pool where we think that

00:13:32.284 --> 00:13:36.504
the pool is really a good pool,
buy the riskiest piece which is

00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:38.732
down here,
the residual that I described

00:13:38.732 --> 00:13:41.149
last time,
for which there is no insurance.

00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:45.522
Now, it may be that the whole
world goes to hell and we lose

00:13:45.522 --> 00:13:49.450
money on our residual,
but so how do we hedge that?

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.908
What we do is then we take what
we think is a bad pool of loans,

00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:56.850
they're from a county that we
think people aren't as reliable,

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.279
say, and we don't buy the
residual.

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:01.428
In fact, we do the opposite.
 

00:14:01.428 --> 00:14:03.730
We buy the insurance on the
triple-B.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.570
There is no insurance on the
residual.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.788
So for the bad pool we've
bought the insurance.

00:14:07.788 --> 00:14:10.460
For the good pool we've bought
the residual,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.981
and so if we're right the
residual is going to pay a lot

00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:15.548
of money because these people
aren't going to default.

00:14:15.548 --> 00:14:17.682
And if the bad pool is as bad
as we think they're going to

00:14:17.682 --> 00:14:19.590
default and we're going to
collect the insurance.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.905
So we're going to win on both,
and if the whole market

00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:25.653
collapses,
well, our residual will go to

00:14:25.653 --> 00:14:27.842
zero,
but so will the BBB in the bad

00:14:27.842 --> 00:14:31.289
pool and we'll collect insurance
and so we'll be protected.

00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:32.379
So that was our strategy.
 

00:14:32.379 --> 00:14:35.447
So, yes, the answer is you have
a lot of information about what

00:14:35.447 --> 00:14:36.240
you're buying.
 

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.306
Student: It's not
actually a triple-A,

00:14:38.306 --> 00:14:39.808
it's a triple-A of a bad pool.
 

00:14:39.808 --> 00:14:42.149
Prof: Yeah,
this appears the triple-A of a

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:45.220
bad pool, but the people buying
the triple-A know exactly what's

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.000
in the pool.
 

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.288
Now, they may be dumb and not
bother to think about it and

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:52.750
just trust the triple-A rating
without thinking about it,

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.500
but probably a lot of them did
think about it.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.979
And if we take this pool,
the CDO, these triple-A's were

00:14:59.979 --> 00:15:03.749
held mostly by big banks,
and you would have thought they

00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:06.629
were the most sophisticated of
all the buyers because they're

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:08.120
the ones creating the pools.
 

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.750
So they certainly know what's
in the pools.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.750
They're the ones who created
this original pool here.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.932
They're the ones who underwrote
those loans and so they're the

00:15:16.932 --> 00:15:19.201
ones,
they know everything about it,

00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:22.350
and they're the ones holding
all these triple-A's.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.408
So we're not talking about
people who have no idea what

00:15:24.408 --> 00:15:25.019
they're doing.
 

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:27.467
We're talking about people who
supposedly do know what they're

00:15:27.467 --> 00:15:27.788
doing.
 

00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:31.059
All right, so that was the
basis of the market.

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:34.320
Now, what happened?
 

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.235
So I can describe our hedging
strategy and our models,

00:15:37.235 --> 00:15:38.940
but I'm not going to do that.
 

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.460
So this was our strategy.
 

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.129
You go long the residuals short
the bad pool.

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:46.340
Now, what happened?
 

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.158
Here's what happened.
 

00:15:47.158 --> 00:15:50.878
There was an index that was
created in the beginning of

00:15:50.878 --> 00:15:51.360
2006.
 

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.614
You just put together a huge
number of triple-B bonds and

00:15:54.614 --> 00:15:58.158
triple-A bonds of different
pools and average their prices.

00:15:58.158 --> 00:16:02.344
That's the index,
and so they're all 100,

00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:03.389
you see?
 

00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:08.005
And then in January of 2007 all
of a sudden the market starts to

00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:11.668
go crazy, and by March and April
it's collapsed.

00:16:11.668 --> 00:16:13.464
These bonds,
a lot of them,

00:16:13.464 --> 00:16:16.153
the triple-B's,
have collapsed from 100,

00:16:16.153 --> 00:16:19.191
where everything was,
all the way down to 60,

00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:20.639
just like that.
 

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:23.755
In a few months it went from
100 to 60,100 here,

00:16:23.755 --> 00:16:26.210
three or four months later it's
60.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.139
This is March of 2007.
 

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:32.990
Now, what was the stock market
doing then?

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.096
You might remember the stock
market, S&amp;P,

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:42.135
so here's the stock market,
too far in historical time,

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:45.870
but anyway, here's the stock
market.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:52.197
It had this NASDAQ collapse,
but this point right here is

00:16:52.197 --> 00:16:54.570
October 31st,
2007.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.881
So ten months or nine months
later the stock market reaches

00:16:58.881 --> 00:16:59.700
its peak.
 

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.807
So all this time from here up
the stock market is climbing and

00:17:02.807 --> 00:17:04.028
climbing and climbing.
 

00:17:04.028 --> 00:17:06.376
So the sub-prime mortgage
market has collapsed,

00:17:06.376 --> 00:17:09.234
but clearly the rest of the
population doesn't think that

00:17:09.234 --> 00:17:10.460
things are that bad.
 

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:18.009
So just to put everything in
perspective, where else are we?

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:23.324
What other big--housing,
let's look at housing prices

00:17:23.324 --> 00:17:24.038
here.
 

00:17:24.038 --> 00:17:26.240
We're going to come back to
this graph if you can see it.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.089
So this is 2000 here.
 

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.269
This is 2009 here.
 

00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:30.839
Green is the housing.
 

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:33.160
This is Shiller's housing index.
 

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.604
So if you set it at 100 in
2000, up here at the very top,

00:17:38.604 --> 00:17:43.464
that's the middle of 2006,
it hit its peak and then

00:17:43.464 --> 00:17:45.410
started to come.
 

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.924
So housing hit its peak in the
middle of 2006,

00:17:48.924 --> 00:17:53.144
the third quarter of 2006,
and then sort of didn't come

00:17:53.144 --> 00:17:56.660
down very fast,
but started to come down.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.718
Sub-prime mortgages collapsed
in January of 2007 and the stock

00:18:01.718 --> 00:18:06.692
market started its very quick
collapse in October-November of

00:18:06.692 --> 00:18:07.440
2007.
 

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.130
So it was first housing prices
turned,

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.220
then sub-prime mortgages
collapsed,

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.848
then the stock market ten
months later collapsed,

00:18:14.848 --> 00:18:19.117
so we have to explain all of
these things and what was going

00:18:19.117 --> 00:18:19.480
on.
 

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:27.538
So in the--sorry, where was I?
 

00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:29.390
So this is the sub-prime market
collapsing.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.980
Why did this market collapse?
 

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.618
What happened to make them
collapse?

00:18:32.618 --> 00:18:37.978
This is actually an example of
the wonderful nature of the

00:18:37.978 --> 00:18:40.608
American financial system.
 

00:18:40.608 --> 00:18:44.397
The fact the market collapsed
is a great thing because why did

00:18:44.397 --> 00:18:46.817
it collapse,
what was the information that

00:18:46.817 --> 00:18:49.538
made people think that things
were going to go down?

00:18:49.538 --> 00:19:00.022
Well, it was this information,
cumulative loss by reporting

00:19:00.022 --> 00:19:01.470
month.
 

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.980
Let's look at some.
 

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.220
These are Countrywide,
they're one of the bad guys,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.325
that is they're one of the ones
whose loans went bad and the

00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:13.856
company went out of business,
basically, and got bought by

00:19:13.856 --> 00:19:14.980
Bank of America.
 

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.528
So look at delinquencies
historically.

00:19:17.528 --> 00:19:21.010
So for 2003,
these are Countrywide loans

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.440
given in 2003.
 

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.808
It's the brown thing.
 

00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:25.605
So here are their
delinquencies,

00:19:25.605 --> 00:19:26.068
right?
 

00:19:26.068 --> 00:19:28.536
They start at 0,
naturally and then they go up

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:31.880
to 2 percent and they stay there
as a function of the pool.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.115
Some of those guys are
defaulting and being thrown out

00:19:35.115 --> 00:19:35.970
of the pool.
 

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.538
That's how delinquencies can go
down.

00:19:37.538 --> 00:19:39.779
Also people can start paying
after being delinquent.

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:41.789
Delinquent just means you're
missing some payments.

00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:43.298
Look at 2004.
 

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:46.710
They're still hardly doing
anything.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.970
And then look at 2005.
 

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.160
Well, all of a sudden
delinquencies start going up.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.644
In 2005--they're 5 percent by
the end of 2007,

00:19:54.644 --> 00:19:58.130
but delinquencies,
5 percent delinquencies.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.040
We're just talking about people
who missed a few payments,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.368
5 percent delinquencies.
 

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.319
They haven't actually been
thrown out of their house.

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:05.309
It takes 18 months.
 

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:06.798
Nobody's lost anything.
 

00:20:06.798 --> 00:20:08.818
They've just been delinquent
for a little while.

00:20:08.818 --> 00:20:15.200
So what was the catastrophe
that made the market collapse?

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.068
Well, this is it.
 

00:20:17.068 --> 00:20:21.259
So WALA means Weighted Average
Age.

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:22.640
So look at the months.
 

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.304
So you take things that were
issued in--this is the

00:20:27.304 --> 00:20:28.890
securitization.
 

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:33.368
They're bundled together in the
beginning of 2006.

00:20:33.368 --> 00:20:36.404
This is the second half of
2006, but the loans actually

00:20:36.404 --> 00:20:39.833
started in 2005 they just didn't
get--the homeowners got their

00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:41.069
mortgages in 2005.
 

00:20:41.069 --> 00:20:43.660
They got securitized in 2006.
 

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.816
So you look at the
delinquencies and you see that

00:20:46.816 --> 00:20:50.300
nothing happens the first 12
months, these are losses,

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.259
and then eventually it goes it
1 percent.

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:55.328
The losses go to 1 percent.
 

00:20:55.328 --> 00:20:57.279
We're not talking about giant
numbers.

00:20:57.279 --> 00:20:58.960
Well, everybody saw that.
 

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.928
Then they looked at the losses
for things issued second half of

00:21:03.928 --> 00:21:05.804
2006,
and the losses,

00:21:05.804 --> 00:21:09.974
that's this blue line,
they are going to,

00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:14.608
we're talking about 20 months
later,

00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:17.798
they're going to 1 percent or
1.2 percent.

00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:20.855
You look at the things issued
in 2007, which means that the

00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:24.015
loans you're really measuring
from somewhere in the middle of

00:21:24.015 --> 00:21:24.490
2006.
 

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.480
At 1 year you're at half a
percent.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.787
And in the second half of 2007
you're at .2 percent losses,

00:21:34.787 --> 00:21:36.798
so no losses at all.
 

00:21:36.798 --> 00:21:39.540
So nothing horrible has
happened except for the fact

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.368
there's an obvious pattern here.
 

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:44.684
It seems like every newer
vintage is getting worse,

00:21:44.684 --> 00:21:46.940
and worse, and worse,
and worse.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.089
And so it was on that basis,
just seeing things getting

00:21:50.089 --> 00:21:52.250
worse before there were any
losses.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.342
Remember, these are very
sophisticated people betting

00:21:54.342 --> 00:21:55.710
hundreds of millions of dollars.
 

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.608
They're thinking hard about
this.

00:21:57.608 --> 00:22:00.679
Even though nothing had
happened yet the market

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:01.480
collapsed.
 

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.346
So this collapse that happens
here is before anybody has lost

00:22:05.346 --> 00:22:06.118
any money.
 

00:22:06.118 --> 00:22:07.750
Hardly anyone's been thrown out
of their house.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.440
Nothing's happened in the
economy,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.851
but the traders have already
figured out things are on a bad

00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:15.076
course,
things are going to look really

00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:16.670
bad and the market collapsed.
 

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.319
So we had warning.
 

00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:20.230
This is the beginning of 2007.
 

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.709
We're almost at the end of
2009, so it was almost three

00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:23.259
years ago.
 

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.178
Nearly three years ago
everybody should have known that

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:29.096
the market had figured out that
there was going to be a

00:22:29.096 --> 00:22:31.259
catastrophe in the sub-prime
world,

00:22:31.259 --> 00:22:34.712
a real catastrophe because the
losses were going to be 40

00:22:34.712 --> 00:22:35.329
percent.
 

00:22:35.329 --> 00:22:36.670
That's what they were expecting.
 

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.779
You can't have losses like that
unless you throw out,

00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:43.316
you know, it's a huge number of
people that have to get thrown

00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:46.021
out of their houses,
and you have to lose a huge

00:22:46.021 --> 00:22:48.920
amount of money on each house in
order to get losses of 40

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.480
percent.
 

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.675
Like I said,
if you lose 50 percent on every

00:22:51.675 --> 00:22:54.384
loan you have to throw 80
percent of the people out of

00:22:54.384 --> 00:22:56.529
their houses to get 40 percent
losses.

00:22:56.529 --> 00:23:00.538
So this meant that people were
expecting gigantic catastrophe.

00:23:00.538 --> 00:23:02.830
By the way, that was an
exaggeration because this is the

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.538
triple-B piece.
 

00:23:03.538 --> 00:23:06.528
I meant the triple-B piece was
going to lose 40 percent.

00:23:06.528 --> 00:23:10.828
So the triple-B piece is only
protected by 6 or 8 percent so

00:23:10.828 --> 00:23:14.400
it means the total losses would
be 10 percent,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.439
10 or 15 percent,
which means if you're losing 50

00:23:16.439 --> 00:23:18.903
percent on a house 30 percent of
the people are going to be

00:23:18.903 --> 00:23:20.220
thrown out of their houses.
 

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.000
So it's like 30 percent losses
and 30 percent of the people

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.390
thrown out of their houses.
 

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.278
That was the expectation then,
but that's still terrible.

00:23:27.278 --> 00:23:29.538
There were five million
sub-prime people,

00:23:29.538 --> 00:23:32.433
so the market at this point is
expecting 30 percent of them to

00:23:32.433 --> 00:23:35.092
be thrown out of their houses
with 30 percent losses even

00:23:35.092 --> 00:23:37.180
though the losses are 1 percent
or less.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.380
So you can see how far sighted
the market is.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.457
So our government,
everybody should have been

00:23:43.457 --> 00:23:46.480
warned right at this point that
something was going to happen.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.940
Now, did the stock market
realize this was such a

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.871
catastrophe,
absolutely not because the

00:23:51.871 --> 00:23:55.529
stock market waited until the
end of 2007,

00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:58.589
which we're talking about here,
and now look at where the

00:23:58.589 --> 00:24:00.338
losses are in sub-prime bonds.
 

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:02.788
Here the stock market started
to go down.

00:24:02.788 --> 00:24:06.085
So it had all this warning that
something horrible was happening

00:24:06.085 --> 00:24:08.700
in the mortgage market,
but the stock market owners

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.058
thought nothing of it.
 

00:24:10.058 --> 00:24:11.589
They thought,
"Well, how could this

00:24:11.589 --> 00:24:12.650
possibly affect us?"
 

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.890
And only here do they start to
catch on.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:20.894
So to give you an example of
the losses, this is only up to

00:24:20.894 --> 00:24:24.950
December 2007,
people kept announcing losses.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.420
Merrill announced 9 billion.
 

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.925
Citi Corp announced 10 billion
and then the next week another

00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:29.470
10 billion.
 

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.230
UBS announced 3.7 billion and
then another 10 billion.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.930
Goldman announced 5 billion,
Morgan Stanley 4 billion.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.628
Every other day someone was
coming out saying that they had

00:24:37.628 --> 00:24:38.838
lost all these billions.
 

00:24:38.838 --> 00:24:40.960
And that was only in December
2007.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.551
The losses accelerated like
crazy through 2008,

00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:46.538
so there were hundreds of
billions of dollars lost.

00:24:46.538 --> 00:24:48.952
Now, the whole sub-prime market
is only 1 trillion,

00:24:48.952 --> 00:24:51.750
but remember there was all that
insurance written on it.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.568
And who was writing the
insurance?

00:24:53.568 --> 00:24:56.828
These very same people were the
ones writing the insurance.

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:59.401
So you not only lost the
hundreds of billions in the

00:24:59.401 --> 00:25:02.361
sub-prime market,
but also multiply that by 5,

00:25:02.361 --> 00:25:06.332
the hundreds of billions all
these guys wrote in insurance

00:25:06.332 --> 00:25:09.118
and in CDO triple-A's that they
held.

00:25:09.118 --> 00:25:16.788
So, all right,
now let's say one other fact

00:25:16.788 --> 00:25:21.720
that's quite interesting.
 

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.528
These are prepayments.
 

00:25:24.528 --> 00:25:28.961
So I told you that in sub-prime
loans for the first two years,

00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:32.740
the sub-prime loan,
you'd be locked into the loan.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.411
A huge penalty if you prepaid,
but between year two and year

00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:38.817
three you could prepay,
get a new loan,

00:25:38.817 --> 00:25:41.859
refinance it and then in year
three the interest rate would

00:25:41.859 --> 00:25:42.279
jump.
 

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:43.890
So what would people do?
 

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.978
Well, people who made all their
payments the first two years

00:25:46.978 --> 00:25:49.961
would be regarded as reliable
payers and so of course they

00:25:49.961 --> 00:25:51.009
would refinance.
 

00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:52.848
They'd no longer be such
sub-prime people.

00:25:52.848 --> 00:25:57.328
They'd refinance into loans
with lower interest because

00:25:57.328 --> 00:26:00.980
they'd be regarded as better
credit risks.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.268
So if you go back to 2003 you
see that after the second year

00:26:05.268 --> 00:26:07.740
prepayments go up to 70 percent.
 

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.003
So 70 percent of the people
would refinance their loan

00:26:11.003 --> 00:26:12.788
between year two and three.
 

00:26:12.788 --> 00:26:16.521
In 2004, that's the pink one,
the same thing happened,

00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:20.817
60 or 70 percent of all those
people over the course of a year

00:26:20.817 --> 00:26:22.720
refinanced their loans.
 

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.596
So that means that the original
lenders got 70 percent of the

00:26:25.596 --> 00:26:26.220
money back.
 

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.180
It's like a prepayment like we
have in mortgages.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.583
Well, in sub-prime these guys
had a huge incentive to do it

00:26:30.583 --> 00:26:32.490
once they proved that they were
good people.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.751
And as I told you,
most of the sub-prime borrowers

00:26:34.751 --> 00:26:37.614
are young people who had screwed
up with their credit cards and

00:26:37.614 --> 00:26:39.971
things like that,
and after they paid for a while

00:26:39.971 --> 00:26:42.740
people would realize that they'd
settled down and give them a new

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.750
loan,
but look what's happened to

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.471
these numbers,
so if you jump to 2007 all

00:26:48.471 --> 00:26:52.888
these things just collapsed,
no more prepayments,

00:26:52.888 --> 00:26:56.086
and once there are no more
prepayments that means the

00:26:56.086 --> 00:26:58.730
lenders don't get their 70
percent back.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.460
So if you're a hedge fund
figuring,

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.057
"How much can I lose if I
buy one of these sub-prime

00:27:03.057 --> 00:27:05.050
things,"
you know that between year two

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.740
and year three you're going to
get 70 percent of your money

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.058
back so you can't lose more than
30 percent.

00:27:10.058 --> 00:27:13.271
All of a sudden you're getting
10 percent of your money back

00:27:13.271 --> 00:27:15.450
which means you could lose 90
percent.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.690
So, why would that have
happened?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.150
Well, we're going to come to
that.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.190
So those are the basic facts.
 

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.685
I don't have time to say more
than that, so any questions

00:27:28.685 --> 00:27:30.308
about those basic facts?
 

00:27:30.308 --> 00:27:32.920
Now we need something to
explain how they happened.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.538
Yes?
 

00:27:33.538 --> 00:27:36.349
Student: So ultimately
the slope of the line is getting

00:27:36.349 --> 00:27:38.976
steeper, is that what you're
saying, so the projected loss

00:27:38.976 --> 00:27:39.990
percentage, right?
 

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.950
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.460
So people were realizing--yeah,
that was all that it was.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.348
People just said to themselves
every--

00:27:48.348 --> 00:27:50.980
that's exactly what I'm saying
that people said,

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.730
"Look, we know that losses
are going to increase,

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.910
but they're probably not going
to get very far.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.310
Historically they get to 3
percent or 4 percent or

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.390
something like that.
 

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:00.818
That's it.
 

00:28:00.818 --> 00:28:01.960
That's all we have to worry
about.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.657
And it's early on,
so it's not like we've seen any

00:28:04.657 --> 00:28:08.018
losses, but they just seem to be
happening so much faster than

00:28:08.018 --> 00:28:09.118
they did before.
 

00:28:09.118 --> 00:28:11.160
Let's extrapolate that
curve."

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.848
Now, how do you extrapolate a
curve like that?

00:28:12.848 --> 00:28:14.970
There are so many ways you
could extrapolate it.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.317
So the market extrapolated and
thought, "Gosh,

00:28:17.317 --> 00:28:19.902
things are getting just much
worse," and the market

00:28:19.902 --> 00:28:21.028
started to collapse.
 

00:28:21.028 --> 00:28:24.049
So you see, in real trading
markets people respond very

00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:26.118
quickly to very little
information.

00:28:26.118 --> 00:28:28.720
I mean, their whole livelihood
depends on it.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.913
It's all they're thinking about
and so they're coming up with

00:28:31.913 --> 00:28:34.522
quick conclusions,
which in this case like in many

00:28:34.522 --> 00:28:36.279
others, they're not so crazy.
 

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:39.372
They're realizing something bad
is happening and they're acting

00:28:39.372 --> 00:28:41.954
very quickly,
and so huge--billions of

00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:46.196
dollars are being lost just on
the basis of this amount of

00:28:46.196 --> 00:28:47.088
evidence.
 

00:28:47.088 --> 00:28:51.356
I think this brings home how
fast the market acts and how

00:28:51.356 --> 00:28:55.318
expectations about the future
are driving prices,

00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:56.960
and therefore how much
information--

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.826
you remember,
we said that if you just pay

00:28:58.826 --> 00:29:00.920
attention to the market you can
learn a lot.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.278
Well, we didn't learn that
much, the whole stock market.

00:29:03.278 --> 00:29:05.068
They weren't paying attention
to what was happen.

00:29:05.068 --> 00:29:07.098
The mortgage market was
collapsing.

00:29:07.098 --> 00:29:09.086
That should have meant
something, but they weren't

00:29:09.086 --> 00:29:10.098
paying attention to it.
 

00:29:10.098 --> 00:29:13.059
Nothing in the world seemed to
change because there were no

00:29:13.059 --> 00:29:14.490
people on the streets yet.
 

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.576
Now there are people
unemployed, there are people on

00:29:16.576 --> 00:29:19.124
the streets,
there are going to be millions

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:21.509
of guys on the streets pretty
soon,

00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:23.078
homeowners on the streets.
 

00:29:23.078 --> 00:29:26.250
And of course so now the stock
market has caught on that things

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.118
are really bad.
 

00:29:27.118 --> 00:29:32.140
All right, so any more
questions about this?

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.367
So now I want to talk about a
way of understanding what

00:29:35.367 --> 00:29:37.640
happened, and then I'm going to
end.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.430
So I'm going to go from more
general to more specific.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.615
So I'm going to talk about a
way of understanding what

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:47.281
happened and then we're going to
talk concretely about how you

00:29:47.281 --> 00:29:51.068
would change the mathematics
we've been doing all semester.

00:29:51.068 --> 00:29:55.660
So my view of all this is that
it's the leverage cycle,

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.150
which is--the leverage cycle,
as I'll define it in a second,

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.589
has to do with putting up
collateral to make sure you're

00:30:01.589 --> 00:30:03.727
going to pay,
and so far in the course we've

00:30:03.727 --> 00:30:07.316
paid no attention to that,
and in all of economic theory

00:30:07.316 --> 00:30:10.038
they never paid attention to
that.

00:30:10.038 --> 00:30:13.304
You can read anyone of those
textbooks that were on the

00:30:13.304 --> 00:30:16.690
reading list by all of the great
Nobel Prize winners,

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.528
and all the great financial
economists,

00:30:18.528 --> 00:30:23.023
and you'll never see the word,
hardly ever see the word

00:30:23.023 --> 00:30:25.308
collateral,
and you'll never see,

00:30:25.308 --> 00:30:27.710
what's the equilibrium amount
of collateral?

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:32.170
And so that's been entirely
missing.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.845
So, in fact,
if you think about

00:30:33.845 --> 00:30:37.250
macroeconomics and the Fed they
always tell you that if things

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.098
go bad in the economy reduce the
interest rate.

00:30:40.098 --> 00:30:42.170
That's the way we can stimulate
investment.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.137
We can raise the price of
assets by lowering the interest

00:30:45.137 --> 00:30:45.509
rate.
 

00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:48.410
If we raise the interest rate
we'll lower the price of assets.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:52.487
We can always get the economy
to boom or slow down by

00:30:52.487 --> 00:30:54.838
adjusting the interest rate.
 

00:30:54.838 --> 00:30:58.348
The most important thing ever
done in macroeconomics in theory

00:30:58.348 --> 00:31:01.972
and practice is to establish the
Federal Reserve and give it the

00:31:01.972 --> 00:31:04.618
responsibility of managing
interest rates.

00:31:04.618 --> 00:31:07.571
Now, in my view it should be
managing collateral rates and

00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:08.660
not interest rates.
 

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.460
And in fact it has the power to
manage,

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.974
it's been given the authority
to manage collateral rates when

00:31:12.974 --> 00:31:15.292
it was created,
but it just never exercises

00:31:15.292 --> 00:31:16.220
that authority.
 

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.330
Now, as I said in class,
Shakespeare already had this

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:19.750
idea.
 

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.640
In The Merchant of
Venice,

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.809
as we said, they were haggling
over the interest rate and not

00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:27.506
just over collateral and
Shakespeare anticipated the

00:31:27.506 --> 00:31:29.990
impatience theory of interest
and Shylock,

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:31.911
who you know,
the modern reading of The

00:31:31.911 --> 00:31:34.609
Merchant of Venice is that
it's about anti-Semitism and

00:31:34.609 --> 00:31:36.440
Shylock is supposed to be a bad
guy.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.170
I don't think Shakespeare
intended that at all.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.618
In fact, Shylock is much more
sophisticated,

00:31:41.618 --> 00:31:44.237
by far, and much better
understanding of what's going on

00:31:44.237 --> 00:31:45.950
in the world than either
Antonio--

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.132
well, certainly than Antonio
who is the merchant of Venice

00:31:49.132 --> 00:31:52.192
and Bassanio's actually,
I think, quite clever,

00:31:52.192 --> 00:31:56.282
although Harold Bloom makes
Bassanio out to be an idiot and

00:31:56.282 --> 00:31:58.528
a dupe,
and can't imagine how Portia

00:31:58.528 --> 00:32:00.259
could possibly marry such a guy.
 

00:32:00.259 --> 00:32:04.615
But anyway, I think that
Bassanio is a very attractive

00:32:04.615 --> 00:32:09.299
guy and I think that Shylock,
he's the only one who really

00:32:09.299 --> 00:32:11.930
understands what's going on.
 

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:16.194
So he explains the entire
modern theory of impatience to

00:32:16.194 --> 00:32:20.615
Bassanio and Antonio and says
that's why the interest rate

00:32:20.615 --> 00:32:22.088
should be high.
 

00:32:22.088 --> 00:32:24.240
And then they haggle over the
collateral.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.053
And of course,
Shakespeare,

00:32:26.053 --> 00:32:28.150
in my view,
thought the collateral was much

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.428
more important than the interest
because nobody can remember the

00:32:30.428 --> 00:32:32.943
rate of interest they agreed on,
but everybody remembers the

00:32:32.943 --> 00:32:34.160
pound of flesh collateral.
 

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.848
And remember that the play ends
with the ships all sinking,

00:32:39.848 --> 00:32:44.622
apparently, and so should
Shylock take his collateral or

00:32:44.622 --> 00:32:46.542
not,
and the court rules not that

00:32:46.542 --> 00:32:49.215
you should reduce the collateral
or you shouldn't take the

00:32:49.215 --> 00:32:51.890
collateral but you should have a
different collateral.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.900
It should have been a pound of
flesh, but not a drop of blood.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.792
So it's the responsibility of
the judicial system and the

00:32:57.792 --> 00:33:00.480
regulatory body to monitor not
the interest rate,

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.136
not the amount of the
borrowing, but the collateral

00:33:03.136 --> 00:33:04.358
that's put up for it.
 

00:33:04.358 --> 00:33:06.568
And that's exactly what my
message is going to be.

00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:08.730
We have to manage the
collateral.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:12.000
And so I wrote about this
starting in 1997,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.577
and 2003, and then again in
2008, and I've written with a

00:33:16.577 --> 00:33:19.402
bunch of people,
and I have students who wrote

00:33:19.402 --> 00:33:19.710
on it.
 

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:23.380
And Araujo and Pascoa were two
Brazilians who wrote about it.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.839
I gave a talk there in 1997.
 

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:27.450
I got them going on it.
 

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:31.577
And then Bernanke himself wrote
about collateral in the '90s at

00:33:31.577 --> 00:33:34.971
the same time,
even earlier than I was,

00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:40.720
but he didn't have the idea of
leverage and collateral rate.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.529
He knew that you needed
collateral.

00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:45.510
He talked about collateral,
but he didn't talk about the

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.650
ratio and the rate.
 

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:47.838
So what do I mean by that?
 

00:33:47.838 --> 00:33:50.284
If you have a house that's
worth 100 dollars,

00:33:50.284 --> 00:33:53.560
say, it's collateral for a loan
because if you don't pay the

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.450
loan they can take your house.
 

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.113
So that's called no recourse
collateral if they take your

00:33:58.113 --> 00:34:00.730
house, but they can't go after
you for anything more.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.571
Now that, in fact,
is not by law what happens,

00:34:03.571 --> 00:34:05.528
but in practice what happens.
 

00:34:05.528 --> 00:34:08.155
If you default on your mortgage
they'll take your house,

00:34:08.155 --> 00:34:10.925
but they aren't going to come
after you to try and get your

00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:12.550
income or something like that.
 

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.809
So it's as if all they can do
is take your house.

00:34:14.809 --> 00:34:18.117
In some states explicitly by
law they can only take your

00:34:18.117 --> 00:34:18.599
house.
 

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:21.342
In other states you still owe
the money, but they always just

00:34:21.342 --> 00:34:22.670
say, "Forget about it.
 

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.329
We're just taking your
house."

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:28.101
So I'm going to assume that
they take your house and no

00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:28.590
more.
 

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:33.574
If the house is worth 100
dollars and you borrow 80 then

00:34:33.574 --> 00:34:37.018
the collateral rate is 125
percent,

00:34:37.018 --> 00:34:41.769
because a 100 dollar house is
protecting an 80 dollar loan,

00:34:41.769 --> 00:34:43.849
so it's 125 percent.
 

00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:46.559
The loan to value,
it's an 80 dollar loan on a 100

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:48.219
dollar house,
is 80 percent.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:51.920
The margin is the margin of
safety,

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.686
it's a 100 dollar house so the
lender thinks that he's

00:34:54.686 --> 00:34:57.817
protected because he's holding a
100 dollar house and he only

00:34:57.817 --> 00:34:59.070
gave you 20 dollars.
 

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.498
So it's 20 percent and the
leverage is 5 because with 20

00:35:03.498 --> 00:35:08.411
dollars of cash you've managed
to buy a house worth 5 times as

00:35:08.411 --> 00:35:09.539
much, 100.
 

00:35:09.539 --> 00:35:11.400
So these numbers are all the
same thing.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.550
It's just different ways of
saying the same thing.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.023
So I prefer leverage,
but collateral rate,

00:35:17.023 --> 00:35:19.480
they're all the same thing.
 

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.360
Student: Could you
explain what the 5 is?

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.362
Prof: 5 is a 100 dollar
house and you only paid 20

00:35:24.362 --> 00:35:24.900
dollars.
 

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.559
You borrowed the other 80.
 

00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:30.485
So with 20 dollars of cash you
can manage to own a 100 dollar

00:35:30.485 --> 00:35:32.449
asset, so the leverage is 5.
 

00:35:32.449 --> 00:35:35.960
So people who borrow a lot can
own huge quantities of things

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.340
even though they had hardly any
money.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.335
So, as I say,
when you're negotiating the

00:35:40.335 --> 00:35:42.532
loan you have to negotiate the
interest rate,

00:35:42.532 --> 00:35:44.929
but you also have to negotiate
the leverage.

00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:48.193
How much cash do you have to
put down in order to get the

00:35:48.193 --> 00:35:48.659
house?
 

00:35:48.659 --> 00:35:51.460
How much can you borrow using
the house as collateral?

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.235
Now, in the standard theory
that Fisher taught that we've

00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:56.813
described in this class,
you've got supply and demand

00:35:56.813 --> 00:35:58.500
determining the interest rate.
 

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.139
Leverage never appeared.
 

00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:03.760
We just always assumed everyone
was going to repay their loan.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.655
So in my theory supply and
demand are going to determine

00:36:07.655 --> 00:36:10.630
both the interest rate and the
leverage.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.672
Now that seems a little
shocking because how can one

00:36:13.672 --> 00:36:15.760
equation determine two
variables?

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.780
So I think it's for this reason
that economists,

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.722
basically all these years,
ignored leverage because they

00:36:20.722 --> 00:36:23.987
just didn't see any way to fit
two variables with one equation

00:36:23.987 --> 00:36:25.699
and solve for two variables.
 

00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:27.760
So they just said,
"Well, for simplicity

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.820
we'll assume everyone always
repays."

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:34.079
Now, what is it that's going to
determine leverage?

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:37.766
Well, this is common sense as
Fisher and Shakespeare before

00:36:37.766 --> 00:36:41.579
him said that interest rates are
determined by impatience.

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:44.530
In my view leverage,
there are many determinants,

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.483
but the most important
determinant is volatility,

00:36:47.483 --> 00:36:49.820
the volatility of the asset
price.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.739
Why is that?
 

00:36:50.739 --> 00:36:54.791
Because you've got a house of
100 protecting the 80 dollar

00:36:54.791 --> 00:36:56.938
loan,
if you think the housing price

00:36:56.938 --> 00:36:59.989
is going up and down and it
might fall below 80 then you're

00:36:59.989 --> 00:37:01.619
not going to feel very safe.
 

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:04.688
If you think the housing price
is rock solid at 100 you're

00:37:04.688 --> 00:37:07.920
going to feel very safe and
you'll even loan more than 80.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.449
So the volatility of the
housing price,

00:37:10.449 --> 00:37:14.480
obviously, is what controls how
safe the lender feels,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.545
and so volatility has got to be
the most important determinant

00:37:17.545 --> 00:37:19.818
of leverage,
but it's hard to see how to fit

00:37:19.818 --> 00:37:21.780
that into a supply and demand
equation.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.210
So the theory,
my theory, is going to be that

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.617
the higher the leverage is,
which supply and demand is

00:37:28.617 --> 00:37:30.940
going to determine,
the higher the asset prices

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.349
are, and the lower leverage is
the lower the asset prices are.

00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:37.090
Now, why should this be the
case?

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:45.070
Well, in my view there are many
different potential buyers,

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:47.992
let's say a continuum of
potential buyers and each of

00:37:47.992 --> 00:37:51.139
them has a different view of
what the asset is worth,

00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:55.110
and so you have this continuum.
 

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:59.130
Now, let's, for simplicity
even, suppose that everyone has

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.800
a number in his head about what
the asset's worth.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.239
That's what we did on the very
first day.

00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:06.699
Everyone had a reservation
price of the asset.

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:08.737
And let's say,
though, that they're willing to

00:38:08.737 --> 00:38:10.369
buy more than one football
ticket.

00:38:10.369 --> 00:38:13.231
They're willing to buy as many
football tickets as they can get

00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:15.909
as long as the price is less
than the reservation price.

00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:18.873
So what happens,
the people who have the highest

00:38:18.873 --> 00:38:22.090
valuation naturally are going to
buy the assets,

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.164
and the people with low
valuations are going to sell

00:38:24.164 --> 00:38:25.987
them,
and somewhere there will be a

00:38:25.987 --> 00:38:26.710
marginal guy.
 

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.552
So people above here are going
to be the buyers,

00:38:28.552 --> 00:38:30.590
and people below here are going
to be the sellers.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.170
And what's the price going to
be?

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:35.268
It's going to be the valuation
of this marginal guy.

00:38:35.268 --> 00:38:38.949
He's marginal precisely because
he's indifferent between being a

00:38:38.949 --> 00:38:42.690
buyer or a seller which means
the price for him is just right.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:45.349
These guys up here think the
price is too low.

00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:46.239
That's why they're buyers.
 

00:38:46.239 --> 00:38:48.159
These guys down here think the
price is too high.

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.309
That's why they're sellers.
 

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:52.237
So this is all consistent with
what we saw in the football

00:38:52.237 --> 00:38:53.110
ticket example.
 

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:57.590
Now, one little twist is where
does this have to be?

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:00.980
Well, it depends on how much
money these guys up here have.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.219
So Fisher actually said this.
 

00:39:03.219 --> 00:39:06.710
If you make people who really
like to consume now richer

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:09.820
you're going to get a different
interest rate,

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.228
or if you make the patient
people richer you'll have a

00:39:12.228 --> 00:39:13.230
lower interest rate.
 

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:14.880
Well, the same logic here.
 

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.117
If you make the natural buyers
richer you're not going to need

00:39:18.117 --> 00:39:21.195
as many of them to buy the
assets and the marginal guy will

00:39:21.195 --> 00:39:23.320
go up here and the price will
rise,

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.510
not because the payoffs of the
asset have changed,

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.710
but because the marginal buyer
has gone up.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.510
So to put it another way,
a more important way,

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:37.280
if it's easier to borrow
because leverage is higher,

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.188
so you can buy that 100 dollar
house with only 10 dollars down

00:39:41.188 --> 00:39:44.239
instead of 20 dollars down,
then each of these natural

00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:46.934
buyers instead of being able to
afford to buy one house can buy

00:39:46.934 --> 00:39:48.760
two houses or two mortgage
securities,

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.768
or buy a house that's twice as
big.

00:39:50.768 --> 00:39:53.690
So the natural buyers,
with a lot of leverage,

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:57.989
a few of them will be able to
buy all the assets,

00:39:57.989 --> 00:40:01.666
and the marginal buyer will be
very high and the price will be

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:02.389
very high.
 

00:40:02.389 --> 00:40:05.123
If there's no leverage and no
borrowing it's going to take a

00:40:05.123 --> 00:40:06.840
lot of them to buy all the
assets,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.643
and the marginal buyer will be
down here and the price will be

00:40:09.643 --> 00:40:10.150
very low.
 

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:14.440
So leverage is clearly going to
affect the price.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.940
And notice how shocking this is.
 

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.500
What would Fisher say about
this?

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.969
So this sounds like such common
sense, how could this be wrong?

00:40:21.969 --> 00:40:23.230
It sounds like it's so obvious.
 

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.760
But now, why didn't anybody say
this before?

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.889
Why didn't Fisher say this?
 

00:40:27.889 --> 00:40:29.170
Because remember what Fisher
said.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:34.702
He said the price of every
asset is the fundamental value

00:40:34.702 --> 00:40:36.679
of the cash flows.
 

00:40:36.679 --> 00:40:40.175
You take the future cash flows
and you discount them by the

00:40:40.175 --> 00:40:42.827
interest rate,
say, and that's what the price

00:40:42.827 --> 00:40:43.250
is.
 

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.570
I'm saying, even if the
interest rate doesn't change,

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.472
you just change the amount of
leverage so these natural buyers

00:40:49.472 --> 00:40:51.855
at the top,
fewer of them are going to be

00:40:51.855 --> 00:40:55.275
able to buy all the assets,
then that's going to make the

00:40:55.275 --> 00:40:56.099
price higher.
 

00:40:56.099 --> 00:40:58.869
So the price is not going to be
equal to the fundamental value.

00:40:58.869 --> 00:41:01.090
In fact, there isn't a
fundamental value.

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.423
It all depends on the different
opinions of the different

00:41:03.423 --> 00:41:03.800
people.
 

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.889
So what are the reasons they
differ?

00:41:05.889 --> 00:41:09.806
Why should there be people who
disagree about what the value

00:41:09.806 --> 00:41:10.139
is?
 

00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:13.231
I think that there are
basically four reasons,

00:41:13.231 --> 00:41:14.469
or five reasons.
 

00:41:14.469 --> 00:41:17.501
Four of them,
anyway, are one,

00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:21.371
these people,
let's say, are more risk

00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:25.449
tolerant than the people down
here.

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:28.210
So the people down here are so
scared to hold these assets

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.050
because they might pay low
numbers,

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:33.650
low payoffs in some states and
high payoffs in other states.

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:38.032
So that assumes that they can't
insure themselves against

00:41:38.032 --> 00:41:39.050
everything.
 

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.099
So that's another crucial
ingredient to my theory which

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:44.211
I'm not going,
you know, in the background

00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:46.559
here is the idea there's not
insurance for everything.

00:41:46.559 --> 00:41:51.960
So the asset here is going to
be regarded as risky if it pays

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.929
less in some states than other.
 

00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:57.253
So because some people are less
risk averse, they're more risk

00:41:57.253 --> 00:41:59.387
tolerant, they're going to be
willing to pay more for the

00:41:59.387 --> 00:41:59.769
asset.
 

00:41:59.769 --> 00:42:00.809
That's one reason.
 

00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:03.527
Another reason is these people
might just be more optimistic

00:42:03.527 --> 00:42:04.449
than these people.
 

00:42:04.449 --> 00:42:08.376
So far we've assumed that
everybody believed in the same

00:42:08.376 --> 00:42:09.518
probabilities.
 

00:42:09.518 --> 00:42:12.733
What if these guys' probability
of the up state is always higher

00:42:12.733 --> 00:42:15.130
than these guys' probability of
the up state?

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:17.164
Then they're going to be
willing to pay more than these

00:42:17.164 --> 00:42:17.579
guys are.
 

00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:21.260
Another reason might be these
people simply like the asset.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.570
They like living in the house.
 

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.349
These people are the New York
bankers.

00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:25.219
They're just lending money.
 

00:42:25.219 --> 00:42:27.119
They couldn't care less about
living in the house.

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:29.059
The house to them is just a
source of income.

00:42:29.059 --> 00:42:30.936
For these people,
they really want to live in the

00:42:30.936 --> 00:42:31.250
house.
 

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:35.090
So another thing could be some
people just have more expertise.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:39.699
They know how to read all these
statements of loans.

00:42:39.699 --> 00:42:41.920
They can analyze the loan level
data,

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.579
and these people don't have the
time,

00:42:43.579 --> 00:42:46.833
or it gives them a headache,
or they don't know how to find

00:42:46.833 --> 00:42:48.909
the loan level data to go
through,

00:42:48.909 --> 00:42:50.996
house by house,
who the homeowners are and how

00:42:50.996 --> 00:42:53.157
reliable they are,
so naturally they're going to

00:42:53.157 --> 00:42:55.449
be scared of buying because
they're going to figure these

00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:56.719
guys know more than they do.
 

00:42:56.719 --> 00:42:59.766
So these are all different
reasons why some people would be

00:42:59.766 --> 00:43:01.869
willing to pay more than other
people.

00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:04.079
And so therefore,
and as I say,

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:08.132
in the standard theory the
asset price is supposed to be

00:43:08.132 --> 00:43:10.050
the fundamental value.
 

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:13.050
We don't talk very much about
the heterogeneity of the people

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.699
and how that makes the
definition of fundamental value

00:43:15.699 --> 00:43:16.750
hard to maintain.
 

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.844
So in my theory,
in short, in equilibrium in

00:43:19.844 --> 00:43:23.731
normal times or good times
there's going to be too much

00:43:23.731 --> 00:43:27.329
leverage and therefore too high
asset prices,

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:30.184
and in bad times there's going
to be too little leverage and

00:43:30.184 --> 00:43:33.327
therefore too low asset prices,
and this recurs over and over

00:43:33.327 --> 00:43:34.846
again,
and it's what I call the

00:43:34.846 --> 00:43:36.670
Leverage Cycle,
what I called the Leverage

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.949
Cycle.
 

00:43:36.949 --> 00:43:39.891
Now, let me give you an example
of what people really had to pay

00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:40.780
for these things.
 

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:47.048
So for a bank buying a triple-A
security there's regulation

00:43:47.048 --> 00:43:53.210
which forces them to put a
certain amount of cash down.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:56.391
So they have their depositors'
money, so they can buy things

00:43:56.391 --> 00:43:59.143
with depositors' money,
but they have to put some of

00:43:59.143 --> 00:44:00.599
their own capital down.
 

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:02.849
So how much do they have to put
down?

00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:05.798
1.6 percent,
so they could leverage 60 to 1,

00:44:05.798 --> 00:44:09.092
a 100 dollar asset,
they only paid 1.6 dollars in

00:44:09.092 --> 00:44:09.710
cash.
 

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.034
If you look at all the so
called toxic mortgage securities

00:44:13.034 --> 00:44:15.659
of which there were 2 and 1 half
trillion,

00:44:15.659 --> 00:44:19.317
these are the things that
crushed all the banks that they

00:44:19.317 --> 00:44:21.351
held,
I went through security by

00:44:21.351 --> 00:44:24.844
security and made a guess as to
how much cash was put down by

00:44:24.844 --> 00:44:27.927
the buyer of each of those
securities and on average I

00:44:27.927 --> 00:44:30.050
got--
so this is not absolutely

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.126
accurate,
there are a lot of guesses,

00:44:32.126 --> 00:44:33.940
but I got 16 to 1 as the
leverage.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.596
So that meant that,
if that number's right,

00:44:37.596 --> 00:44:41.512
it means 150 billion dollars of
cash was paid,

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:44.559
and 2.35 trillion was borrowed.
 

00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:47.010
That's 16 to 1 leverage.
 

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.940
So that means that,
you know, think about it,

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.605
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,
two people by themselves,

00:44:53.605 --> 00:44:56.469
in 2006 had almost 150 billion
dollars.

00:44:56.469 --> 00:44:59.382
So that means two guys in the
whole economy could have bought

00:44:59.382 --> 00:45:02.248
every single toxic mortgage
security because they could have

00:45:02.248 --> 00:45:04.869
borrowed the rest of the money
they needed to buy.

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:07.893
So when you think of where this
line is what I'm saying is that

00:45:07.893 --> 00:45:11.646
for all the mortgage securities,
all the toxic mortgage

00:45:11.646 --> 00:45:15.646
securities, sub-prime,
all those supposedly dangerous

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:19.300
securities you could have had
the marginal buyer way up here.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.739
That's all that was required.
 

00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:22.590
Those are the only number of
people,

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:25.576
this top little echelon of
people bought all those

00:45:25.576 --> 00:45:27.751
securities,
could have bought all those

00:45:27.751 --> 00:45:30.300
securities because they had
enough money to do it,

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.590
and they hardly had to put
anything down.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:36.018
All right, the same was true
with housing.

00:45:36.018 --> 00:45:38.909
Now, let's look at this theory
a little bit.

00:45:38.909 --> 00:45:41.985
So I should have--sorry,
I could have put this in a

00:45:41.985 --> 00:45:42.909
better thing.
 

00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:47.637
So I give all these talks with
Shiller for alumni during the

00:45:47.637 --> 00:45:48.360
crisis.
 

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.659
We haven't given one in a
while, but there was,

00:45:50.659 --> 00:45:51.909
you know, lots of them.
 

00:45:51.909 --> 00:45:54.572
Like every month or two months
we'd be giving one of these

00:45:54.572 --> 00:45:57.050
talks and they'd bring in all
these donors to say,

00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:01.239
"Yale needs your money
now," and they'd say,

00:46:01.239 --> 00:46:03.519
"We don't have any money.
 

00:46:03.519 --> 00:46:05.440
So anyhow, I'm just joking.
 

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.067
So we'd have a lot of these
talks and Shiller would always

00:46:08.067 --> 00:46:09.219
put up the green graph.
 

00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:11.445
So on the right hand side,
I showed you this before,

00:46:11.445 --> 00:46:12.579
it's his famous diagram.
 

00:46:12.579 --> 00:46:15.929
He did a brilliant thing.
 

00:46:15.929 --> 00:46:19.469
He decided to collect data on
every transaction.

00:46:19.469 --> 00:46:22.460
Every time someone purchased a
house he'd keep track of it,

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.050
because it's all public
information,

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.159
and then he'd compare it to the
same house that was sold before,

00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:30.179
and do a few other tricks that
I don't have time to explain,

00:46:30.179 --> 00:46:34.849
to make an index of the housing
prices in the whole country.

00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:38.880
And so he'd done this going
back many years,

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.958
but starting in 2000 the thing
that he called attention to

00:46:41.958 --> 00:46:44.168
before anybody,
he said, "Look at this.

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.010
Look at this line.
 

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:49.759
The housing price index from
2000 to 2006 it's gone up by

00:46:49.759 --> 00:46:52.050
almost 100 percent."
 

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:56.452
The housing index was 100 in
2000 when it started,

00:46:56.452 --> 00:46:58.250
that's 110, sorry.
 

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.010
This is 100.
 

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:04.175
It was 100 when it started here
in 2000 and it goes up to 190 in

00:47:04.175 --> 00:47:04.750
2006.
 

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:10.480
That's 90 percent in 6 years.
 

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.507
To almost double in six years
that means it's gone up 12

00:47:15.507 --> 00:47:18.250
percent a year or something.
 

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.454
So a staggering increase in the
price of housing,

00:47:21.454 --> 00:47:23.659
and then it started to go down.
 

00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:26.518
So he called attention to this
already as it was coming up.

00:47:26.518 --> 00:47:29.012
So in 2004 and 2005 he was
saying, "My gosh,

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.000
there's a bubble.
 

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.800
It's going crazy,"
and he'd say,

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.099
"Everybody is nuts.
 

00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:35.826
Americans, there's irrational
exuberance and people are so

00:47:35.826 --> 00:47:38.599
crazy that they just think
things are always going to go up

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:41.710
and the price is going up higher
and higher and higher."

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:44.440
And then when it got so high
the narrative changed.

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.719
People started getting worried
and they started telling

00:47:46.719 --> 00:47:49.590
everyone the world was coming to
an end and the prices went down,

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.150
and down, and down because we
have irrational exuberance.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.849
And things are picking up a
little bit,

00:47:53.849 --> 00:47:55.414
but we don't know whether
people are irrationally

00:47:55.414 --> 00:47:56.480
exuberant,
or pessimistic,

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.018
or they're blipping,
but anyway, they're irrational.

00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:03.427
So that's a story that has a
certain compelling nature to it

00:48:03.427 --> 00:48:07.010
and he deserves a lot of credit
for calling attention to it.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:10.710
But in my story I say these
prices are related to leverage.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:15.204
So I went through every loan,
loan by loan,

00:48:15.204 --> 00:48:18.630
that wasn't a government loan.
 

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:19.820
So these are private loans.
 

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.679
You can't get the data on
government loans.

00:48:21.679 --> 00:48:26.094
So on private loans you know
every time someone took out a

00:48:26.094 --> 00:48:30.197
mortgage they were selling the
loan, so therefore they

00:48:30.197 --> 00:48:31.980
published the data.
 

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:35.797
You know what the appraised
value of the house was or the

00:48:35.797 --> 00:48:39.342
sale price if they were buying
it for the first time,

00:48:39.342 --> 00:48:42.070
and you know what all the loans
are.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:46.373
So I added up the value of all
the loans and I divided it by

00:48:46.373 --> 00:48:49.753
the price of the house,
and I subtracted it off to get

00:48:49.753 --> 00:48:52.318
what the down payment was,
the cash down payment,

00:48:52.318 --> 00:48:54.840
so this is 2 percent down,
4 percent down,

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:57.628
6 percent down,
or if you take 100 percent

00:48:57.628 --> 00:49:00.418
minus this,
this is the loan to value,

00:49:00.418 --> 00:49:02.050
so this is 100 percent.
 

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.289
You've borrowed everything.
 

00:49:03.289 --> 00:49:07.309
Here you borrowed 98 percent of
the value, 96 percent of the

00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:10.239
house, 94 percent of the house,
etcetera.

00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:15.050
So in 2000 these are slightly
riskier people.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:19.909
Amazingly they're putting down
14 percent, not amazingly.

00:49:19.909 --> 00:49:22.969
They're putting down 14 percent
so it's 7 to 1 leverage.

00:49:22.969 --> 00:49:24.360
But then look what happened.
 

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.965
The leverage went up,
and up, and up,

00:49:26.965 --> 00:49:29.789
and up, and up,
and up, and then it was,

00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:32.539
in 2006, less than 3 percent
down.

00:49:32.539 --> 00:49:34.719
These people were 30 to 1
leveraged.

00:49:34.719 --> 00:49:37.440
I said the securities market
was 16 to 1 leveraged,

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.510
the triple-A part 60 to 1
leveraged.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:43.570
Here they're 30 to 1 leveraged
and so the prices went up.

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.030
But yes the prices went up
because the leverage went up.

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.530
You hardly had to put any money
down.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:51.722
That's why people were willing
to buy such expensive houses

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:55.079
because they weren't actually
putting that much money down.

00:49:55.079 --> 00:49:57.829
And then leverage collapsed
like this and you had to put

00:49:57.829 --> 00:50:01.561
more and more money down,
and then the whole market,

00:50:01.561 --> 00:50:03.742
you know,
you can't get a loan basically

00:50:03.742 --> 00:50:05.690
anymore unless you're getting a
government loan.

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:09.119
And so leverage collapsed and
the housing prices went down.

00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:12.409
Leverage was collapsing faster
and in front of housing prices.

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:15.168
So I think it's the leverage
which is a crucial determinant

00:50:15.168 --> 00:50:17.237
of the price,
and not irrational exuberance,

00:50:17.237 --> 00:50:19.420
although I think there is
irrational exuberance,

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:23.039
but I think leverage is what's
underneath it and more basic.

00:50:23.039 --> 00:50:25.280
Now, let's do the same thing
with prices.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.900
So we did the sub-prime index
before.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.389
This red line is the prime
index.

00:50:31.389 --> 00:50:34.614
So we're talking about not
sub-prime homeowners,

00:50:34.614 --> 00:50:38.043
but prime, people with
brilliant credit ratings and

00:50:38.043 --> 00:50:38.730
stuff.
 

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.806
So even now years,
three years after the crisis

00:50:41.806 --> 00:50:44.525
has started,
the losses on these pools are

00:50:44.525 --> 00:50:47.521
still in the single digits,
5 percent, 6 percent,

00:50:47.521 --> 00:50:49.780
things like that and most of
these,

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.530
8 percent maybe,
and most of these,

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:56.090
these are the trip--the top
piece of a pool of prime

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:56.929
borrowers.
 

00:50:56.929 --> 00:51:02.289
So most of these loans are,
they're protected by 8 percent

00:51:02.289 --> 00:51:04.360
of the bottom piece.
 

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.065
So you have to go through 8
percent losses before you touch

00:51:07.065 --> 00:51:07.719
them at all.
 

00:51:07.719 --> 00:51:12.447
So it's just inconceivable that
you'd see 40 percent losses,

00:51:12.447 --> 00:51:14.289
but so what happened?
 

00:51:14.289 --> 00:51:16.610
These bonds were at 100.
 

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:18.510
This is 100 over here.
 

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:20.469
The price is 100.
 

00:51:20.469 --> 00:51:21.599
They're at 100.
 

00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:23.922
Now, the interest rate is
changing and the prices are

00:51:23.922 --> 00:51:26.425
going up and down because
they're supposed to be floaters

00:51:26.425 --> 00:51:29.329
which always pay more or less
depending on the interest rate.

00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:32.431
So they should be locked in at
100, but they're not floating

00:51:32.431 --> 00:51:35.166
exactly on the same time,
you know, they don't change

00:51:35.166 --> 00:51:36.429
their float so fast.
 

00:51:36.429 --> 00:51:38.916
So the price is going up and
down because of that,

00:51:38.916 --> 00:51:41.860
but it's clear that nobody
thinks there are going to be any

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:42.420
losses.
 

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:46.949
And then all of a sudden in
2007, but later,

00:51:46.949 --> 00:51:50.070
this is much later than the
sub-prime market collapse,

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:54.065
these prices collapse,
and they collapse all the way

00:51:54.065 --> 00:51:55.840
to 60,
shocking.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.282
It's just inconceivable,
I think, that people could have

00:51:58.282 --> 00:52:00.550
thought there are going to be 40
percent losses,

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:03.641
or that everybody could have
thought there are going to be 40

00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:06.342
percent losses,
and then they've shot back up

00:52:06.342 --> 00:52:06.769
to 80.
 

00:52:06.769 --> 00:52:07.949
So there's been a huge gain.
 

00:52:07.949 --> 00:52:12.001
So if you look at a typical
hedge fund like Ellington you'll

00:52:12.001 --> 00:52:15.916
see that we lost a lot of money,
and now we've made a huge

00:52:15.916 --> 00:52:17.289
amount of money.
 

00:52:17.289 --> 00:52:20.829
So that was not such brilliant
hedging, but anyway.

00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:23.750
So, but now why did these
prices collapse and go back up?

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.447
Is it that people just got
totally irrationally pessimistic

00:52:26.447 --> 00:52:28.507
and then they said,
"Oh, things can't really

00:52:28.507 --> 00:52:30.010
be that bad,"
and things got better?

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:33.458
Well, let's look at the
leverage, what is the down

00:52:33.458 --> 00:52:37.610
payment, the same thing as
before on triple-A securities.

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:41.063
Now amazingly the Fed has never
kept these numbers,

00:52:41.063 --> 00:52:44.239
and they're still not keeping
these numbers.

00:52:44.239 --> 00:52:48.460
So I testified in front of Ben
Bernanke and the Board of

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.610
Governors on October 2008.
 

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:54.170
There were several of us,
but it was for four and a half

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.690
hours.
 

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:58.329
And I showed them this graph.
 

00:52:58.329 --> 00:53:02.483
So this graph is at my hedge
fund, Ellington--it's just a

00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:06.119
bunch of securities that we're
used to trading.

00:53:06.119 --> 00:53:08.594
It's how much they were
offering to lend us,

00:53:08.594 --> 00:53:12.050
what the down payment was they
were insisting if we wanted to

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:13.949
leverage as much as we could.
 

00:53:13.949 --> 00:53:16.635
So we didn't leverage anything
like that, but this is what they

00:53:16.635 --> 00:53:19.405
were offering us on the kinds of
securities that we're interested

00:53:19.405 --> 00:53:19.710
in.
 

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:22.219
So this is not the greatest
data because we're only looking

00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:24.686
at what we're interested in,
and we're only looking at the

00:53:24.686 --> 00:53:25.639
offers made to us.
 

00:53:25.639 --> 00:53:27.320
So, but looked what happened.
 

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.822
In '98 when there was a
leverage crisis,

00:53:29.822 --> 00:53:32.965
that was the last one,
I must have skipped a slide

00:53:32.965 --> 00:53:36.429
where I said the last leverage
cycle ended in '98.

00:53:36.429 --> 00:53:37.750
It was 10 percent down.
 

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:41.090
That means 10 to 1 leverage,
and then suddenly it went to 40

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:41.940
percent down.
 

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.690
So leverage drastically dropped.
 

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:47.007
The down payment,
the margin, radically increased

00:53:47.007 --> 00:53:50.949
for a few months during the
crisis then it went back to 10

00:53:50.949 --> 00:53:51.780
percent.
 

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.480
Then we had 10 percent down for
a long time.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.510
That's 10 to 1 leverage.
 

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.829
And then for a couple of years
it became 5 to 1 leverage,

00:53:58.829 --> 00:54:02.530
so 20 to 1,5 to 1,
sorry, 5 percent down means 20

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:03.920
to 1 leverage.
 

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.329
So the leverage had drastically
increased,

00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:12.509
and then leverage suddenly
started collapsing and lenders

00:54:12.509 --> 00:54:15.570
asked for more and more down
payments,

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:16.809
more and more down payments.
 

00:54:16.809 --> 00:54:19.815
And leverage was just
collapsing, and it happened

00:54:19.815 --> 00:54:22.697
ahead of the prices,
and then leverage actually

00:54:22.697 --> 00:54:25.139
picked up here and went down
again.

00:54:25.139 --> 00:54:28.429
Then--this graph is quite old
now, May.

00:54:28.429 --> 00:54:29.989
I should have updated it.
 

00:54:29.989 --> 00:54:33.059
Leverage has gone way up again
and the prices have gone way up.

00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:35.539
So you see, leverage goes down
the prices go down.

00:54:35.539 --> 00:54:37.961
Leverage goes up the prices go
up, and leverage is still

00:54:37.961 --> 00:54:39.900
heading up and the prices are
much higher.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.869
So that's my view.
 

00:54:41.869 --> 00:54:45.248
It's leverage that's
determining a lot of these

00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:45.909
things.
 

00:54:45.909 --> 00:54:48.197
All right, and so as I said,
there's recurring leverage

00:54:48.197 --> 00:54:48.579
cycles.
 

00:54:48.579 --> 00:54:51.699
In 1998 there was a leverage
cycle.

00:54:51.699 --> 00:54:53.775
That's when Long-Term
Capital--so there was a book on

00:54:53.775 --> 00:54:55.931
the collapse of Long-Term
Capital that Lowenstein wrote

00:54:55.931 --> 00:54:57.170
that's on the reading list.
 

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:58.869
Before that was Orange County.
 

00:54:58.869 --> 00:55:03.945
You remember my firm Kidder
Peabody went out of business in

00:55:03.945 --> 00:55:05.960
1994, the end of '94.
 

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.985
The beginning of '94,
Orange County got bankrupted

00:55:09.985 --> 00:55:14.670
partly thanks to buying
securities from Kidder Peabody.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.159
Some of you may live in Orange
County.

00:55:17.159 --> 00:55:18.960
In any case that was the
derivatives crisis,

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.420
and in 1987 there was a stock
market crash,

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.815
so anyway, it's hard to
document all the historical

00:55:24.815 --> 00:55:28.889
leverage cycles because the Fed
has never kept this data,

00:55:28.889 --> 00:55:31.539
and most other firms don't keep
their historical data.

00:55:31.539 --> 00:55:34.884
We at Ellington realized after
'98 that this was a huge

00:55:34.884 --> 00:55:37.360
problem, leverage,
and so we kept all the

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.599
historical data.
 

00:55:38.599 --> 00:55:41.333
That's when I wrote my first
paper on leverage and collateral

00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:43.429
and that being a crucial
ingredient of the--

00:55:43.429 --> 00:55:45.650
so we have this data and
practically nobody else has.

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:47.679
So for me the most important
thing,

00:55:47.679 --> 00:55:51.956
the first step the Fed should
do is keep track of the leverage

00:55:51.956 --> 00:55:55.123
that is being allowed for,
the margins that are being

00:55:55.123 --> 00:55:58.119
demanded on every security,
housing and securities.

00:55:58.119 --> 00:56:00.829
And I heard this talk,
I told you,

00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:05.789
last night on the collapse of
the electric grid in 2003,

00:56:05.789 --> 00:56:10.010
and so I said,
"What have you done?"

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:12.050
Obviously the obvious question
everyone wanted to know.

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:13.670
So, "What have you done to
make it safer?"

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:17.010
And they said the one thing
they did is now they've spent

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:20.409
tens and tens of millions of
dollars getting more data.

00:56:20.409 --> 00:56:24.289
So they now monitor every
single power line in real time.

00:56:24.289 --> 00:56:27.032
They had farmed that out to
other people before and they

00:56:27.032 --> 00:56:28.630
weren't very careful about it.
 

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:31.123
Now they're incredibly careful
about monitoring every single

00:56:31.123 --> 00:56:31.420
line.
 

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.641
So as soon as one line goes
down they switch the electricity

00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:37.699
and they move it evenly across a
bunch of other lines.

00:56:37.699 --> 00:56:40.751
In the old days when a power
line went down the grid

00:56:40.751 --> 00:56:43.101
automatically--
sort of, electricity went,

00:56:43.101 --> 00:56:45.869
the power went to the next
closest place and that would

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:49.199
overload the next closest one
and maybe make that one go down.

00:56:49.199 --> 00:56:54.949
Now if they know it's gone down
they choose how to re-divide it.

00:56:54.949 --> 00:56:57.257
But the point is,
you can't do all that without

00:56:57.257 --> 00:56:59.454
information,
and they're spending tens of

00:56:59.454 --> 00:57:02.599
millions of dollars monitoring
everything and we still are not

00:57:02.599 --> 00:57:04.199
monitoring what leverage is.
 

00:57:04.199 --> 00:57:07.179
I think it's a shocking thing.
 

00:57:07.179 --> 00:57:10.268
We should be monitoring
leverage and then we should be

00:57:10.268 --> 00:57:12.592
regulating it,
and instead we haven't even

00:57:12.592 --> 00:57:15.039
begun to monitor it,
much less to figure out how to

00:57:15.039 --> 00:57:15.630
regulate it.
 

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:18.476
Now, why was the leverage
cycle--I said,

00:57:18.476 --> 00:57:20.960
this recurs over and over
again.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.563
So why was the leverage cycle
so bad this time than it was

00:57:25.563 --> 00:57:26.289
before?
 

00:57:26.289 --> 00:57:28.000
So this is my short version.
 

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.070
I have a long version of this.
 

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:34.637
The short version is because
leverage got higher than it ever

00:57:34.637 --> 00:57:36.585
did before,
and there are lots of reasons

00:57:36.585 --> 00:57:38.469
why leverage got higher than it
ever did before.

00:57:38.469 --> 00:57:41.784
We had this period of low
volatility for a long time,

00:57:41.784 --> 00:57:43.250
so it made it higher.
 

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:47.750
We then had securitization
which we didn't have before.

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:52.802
So a sub-prime borrower would
have had to put down a huge down

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:56.309
payment in the old days,
because people would have

00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:58.139
regarded it as such a risky
thing,

00:57:58.139 --> 00:58:01.766
but once we packaged all the
sub-prime loans together in a

00:58:01.766 --> 00:58:05.840
big security and the triple-A
guy got the best of the houses,

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:08.570
not each house,
not a share of every house,

00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:10.570
but only a share of the very
best houses,

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:14.273
it all of a sudden became a
much safer loan and so you could

00:58:14.273 --> 00:58:16.659
borrow a lot more money against
it,

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.739
against that triple-A loan.
 

00:58:18.739 --> 00:58:21.969
So the triple-A piece,
using that as collateral,

00:58:21.969 --> 00:58:25.514
you could borrow a lot of
money, a big percentage of the

00:58:25.514 --> 00:58:28.610
price of the triple-A thing you
could borrow,

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.985
whereas if you had a single
sub-prime loan people would

00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:33.583
never lend more than 50 percent
of the value of the house or

00:58:33.583 --> 00:58:34.199
something.
 

00:58:34.199 --> 00:58:38.114
The second reason why things
were so bad was because we had a

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:39.679
double leverage cycle.
 

00:58:39.679 --> 00:58:42.172
We had leverage shooting
through the roof not just in

00:58:42.172 --> 00:58:43.610
securities as it had before.
 

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:46.980
As I showed you in '98 where it
was at 10 percent down,

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:49.268
and then there was a collapse
to 40 percent down,

00:58:49.268 --> 00:58:52.489
and then back to 10 percent
down, that was a big change,

00:58:52.489 --> 00:58:54.940
in the crisis stage,
leverage collapse,

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.800
but here we had it in housing
as well where there was a

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.230
feedback between the two.
 

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:02.400
So why is it that all these
people stopped being able to

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.744
refinance their loans in 2007,
which contributed so much to

00:59:05.744 --> 00:59:06.610
the losses?
 

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:13.777
It's not because the interest
rates were suddenly too high for

00:59:13.777 --> 00:59:14.599
them.
 

00:59:14.599 --> 00:59:15.550
Those didn't change at all.
 

00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:18.612
It's that the lenders suddenly
demanded a much bigger down

00:59:18.612 --> 00:59:19.150
payment.
 

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.003
Instead of 3 percent down they
had to put 25 percent down and

00:59:22.003 --> 00:59:24.666
they couldn't afford to do it,
so they couldn't refinance

00:59:24.666 --> 00:59:25.380
their loan.
 

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.157
They didn't have the cash,
so they were stuck with the old

00:59:28.157 --> 00:59:31.130
loan, and so the original lender
was in much more jeopardy.

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:34.420
And then the last thing is the
CDS market.

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.530
So I have to explain this.
 

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:37.869
That's why it's going to spill
over into next time.

00:59:37.869 --> 00:59:40.476
So these insurance things,
there are many ways of

00:59:40.476 --> 00:59:43.789
interpreting what they did and
why they were so dangerous,

00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:48.115
but one of them is that they
allowed people to write

00:59:48.115 --> 00:59:51.679
insurance to lose huge amounts
of money.

00:59:51.679 --> 00:59:52.880
So that's an obvious thing.
 

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.213
That's why the losses were so
big, but more interesting than

00:59:55.213 --> 00:59:57.981
that,
they allowed the pessimists to

00:59:57.981 --> 01:00:02.228
leverage themselves,
because in our old story from

01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:07.315
way back here,
in this old story--where was

01:00:07.315 --> 01:00:10.650
the old story with that?
 

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.041
In this story,
remember, I said that the

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:15.619
natural buyers,
you'd have fewer of them if

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:17.460
they could leverage a lot.
 

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.750
So what were these guys down
here doing?

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:24.175
Well, they couldn't do anything
except sell the assets and maybe

01:00:24.175 --> 01:00:25.369
make the loans.
 

01:00:25.369 --> 01:00:27.329
As the price got higher and
higher these guys down here,

01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:29.579
presumably, were getting more
and more disgusted and thinking,

01:00:29.579 --> 01:00:30.630
"Well, this market's
ridiculous,

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:32.269
and the price is way too high.
 

01:00:32.269 --> 01:00:33.860
We don't want to buy here."
 

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.646
And I've talked to a lot of
insurance companies like

01:00:36.646 --> 01:00:39.380
Northwestern Mutual Life,
the guy who runs that.

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.748
He said, "We used to be a
big buyer of mortgage securities

01:00:43.748 --> 01:00:46.920
and sub-prime mortgages and
stuff in 2004,

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.608
and the price got so high in
2006 to us it became ridiculous

01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:51.659
so we just dropped out of the
market."

01:00:51.659 --> 01:00:53.869
But dropping out of the market
is one thing.

01:00:53.869 --> 01:00:56.159
What if they could bet against
the market?

01:00:56.159 --> 01:00:58.429
Well, they had no opportunity
to do that before.

01:00:58.429 --> 01:01:00.559
They couldn't express their
negative view,

01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:09.860
but starting in 2005 where this
CDS market really took off,

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.619
they could suddenly express
their negative view.

01:01:12.619 --> 01:01:17.103
So in my view and in my opinion
what happened was that at end of

01:01:17.103 --> 01:01:21.159
2005 the pessimists for the
first time were able to bet on

01:01:21.159 --> 01:01:23.010
the market going down.
 

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:25.961
And so that's what started to
make prices go down,

01:01:25.961 --> 01:01:27.650
because of the CDS market.
 

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:31.518
When prices started to go down
the mortgage securities that had

01:01:31.518 --> 01:01:35.326
been sold with all that leverage
for high prices started to go

01:01:35.326 --> 01:01:36.449
down in price.
 

01:01:36.449 --> 01:01:39.701
That meant that new
securitizations weren't worth

01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:40.039
it.
 

01:01:40.039 --> 01:01:42.123
You couldn't make the profit
that we were talking about

01:01:42.123 --> 01:01:44.398
before, putting all of these
things together and selling off

01:01:44.398 --> 01:01:44.940
the bonds.
 

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.670
The bonds are being sold for a
lower price.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:51.159
You couldn't lend all that
money to these people.

01:01:51.159 --> 01:01:53.603
You were getting the money to
lend to the people by selling

01:01:53.603 --> 01:01:54.110
the bonds.
 

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.563
If you sell the bonds at a
lower price you don't have the

01:01:56.563 --> 01:01:57.880
money to lend to the people.
 

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.900
So in order to make the bonds
sell for a higher price they

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:09.710
demanded that the homeowners put
up more collateral,

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:12.340
and then that meant the
homeowners couldn't refinance,

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.719
and then that started to make
the world more dangerous,

01:02:14.719 --> 01:02:16.949
and that's why,
then, on securities,

01:02:16.949 --> 01:02:19.824
the lenders on securities
reduced the leverage and then

01:02:19.824 --> 01:02:21.739
the whole thing started to
spiral.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:24.820
That's my story of how the
things started.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.780
So let's say that.
 

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:30.757
In the bottom of the leverage
cycle the same bad three things

01:02:30.757 --> 01:02:31.820
always happen.
 

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:35.150
Number one there's scary bad
news that creates more

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:37.550
uncertainty and more
disagreement.

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:41.320
So it wasn't just that people
thought that losses were going

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.219
to go from 40 percent to 20
percent on sub-prime mortgages.

01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:48.230
It's that they went from 4
percent expected,

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:51.380
with a range of 1 to 5 percent,
to 30 percent,

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.670
but maybe they'd be 80 percent,
the losses.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.929
There was a huge
volatility--nobody really knew

01:02:56.929 --> 01:02:58.699
what the hell was going to
happen.

01:02:58.699 --> 01:03:00.590
They had to extrapolate those
curves.

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:01.949
How do you know how to
extrapolate?

01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:04.809
For a decade the curves had
been flat.

01:03:04.809 --> 01:03:06.409
Suddenly they're starting to
accelerate.

01:03:06.409 --> 01:03:08.210
How do you know how to
extrapolate them?

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:10.708
There's huge uncertainty,
huge volatility,

01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:13.940
and so naturally the lenders
are going to be much more

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:17.110
nervous and lend only with much
more collateral.

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:20.452
Once the lenders lend with much
more collateral those people at

01:03:20.452 --> 01:03:22.880
the top can't afford to buy
things anymore.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.780
They're going to have to sell.
 

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.980
So there's de-leveraging.
 

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.469
Sorry, and the people at the
top are going to have to sell,

01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:33.114
but the price is going to go
down, and because they borrowed

01:03:33.114 --> 01:03:35.710
money and using an asset as
collateral,

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:37.070
their leverage--we talked about
that--

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:39.190
their losses are going to be
gigantic because they're

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:40.079
betting,
essentially,

01:03:40.079 --> 01:03:41.800
on things going up,
and things are going down so

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.119
they lost a huge amount of
money.

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:45.829
So this is always the same
thing.

01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:46.980
There is scary bad news.
 

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.338
Margins get tougher,
and the most optimistic

01:03:49.338 --> 01:03:52.463
leveraged buyers are the ones
who got crushed because they

01:03:52.463 --> 01:03:55.590
were betting on things going up
and they go bankrupt.

01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:57.690
So now, what's so bad about
this?

01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:03.130
I'm running out of time here,
and I haven't gotten to how the

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:05.489
math is going to change.
 

01:04:05.489 --> 01:04:06.409
So what's so bad?
 

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:09.385
So I'm going to talk for four
more minutes and hand back the

01:04:09.385 --> 01:04:12.210
exams, or should I just hand
back the exams right now?

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.820
What do you--are you?
 

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.070
I'll talk four more minutes.
 

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:18.621
Some of you aren't going to
come next time,

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.599
maybe most of you,
so I'll do how the math changes

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:22.449
next time.
 

01:04:22.449 --> 01:04:24.440
So what's so bad about the
leverage cycle?

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.539
So let's just think about all
the bad things that happened.

01:04:27.539 --> 01:04:30.963
Number one, you can have a tiny
group of people at the top

01:04:30.963 --> 01:04:34.148
controlling the price,
because they can borrow so much

01:04:34.148 --> 01:04:34.750
money.
 

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.869
Now we've always assumed that
everybody was rational.

01:04:36.869 --> 01:04:38.829
What if these buyers are kind
of crazy?

01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:43.052
A few guys can make the price
skyrocket because they can

01:04:43.052 --> 01:04:44.820
borrow so much money.
 

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.492
Now, once they do that and
they're making the price of

01:04:47.492 --> 01:04:49.860
assets skyrocket,
people are going to build more

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:50.869
of those assets.
 

01:04:50.869 --> 01:04:53.898
So they're going to use real
resources to build projects that

01:04:53.898 --> 01:04:57.130
are probably crazy and are going
to be very costly to reverse.

01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:01.079
But let's leave aside now
people being crazy.

01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:03.409
What else happens in the
leverage cycle?

01:05:03.409 --> 01:05:07.193
Well, in the leverage cycle
when you're leveraged a lot,

01:05:07.193 --> 01:05:11.389
as we said, that's going on the
Tobin diagram to the right.

01:05:11.389 --> 01:05:14.500
It's like borrowing money to
bet in the stocks.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.440
That means if the stocks go up
you multiply your winnings.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.050
If the stocks go down you
multiply your losses.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.976
So in the leverage cycle people
who are lucky,

01:05:22.976 --> 01:05:26.360
if things keep going up,
they get incredibly rich.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.039
It's a tremendous mystery in
economics.

01:05:28.039 --> 01:05:32.119
Why is it that inequality
increased so much?

01:05:32.119 --> 01:05:34.440
Well, one of the reasons,
I think, is the leverage cycle,

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.610
that people were betting and
making more and more money and

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:41.670
so that's why inequality was--
is helping to spread inequality.

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:45.032
Now, another thing is the
worst, probably the biggest

01:05:45.032 --> 01:05:49.043
problem is that once the asset
prices fall everything gets hard

01:05:49.043 --> 01:05:49.690
to do.
 

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:53.016
So if you want to get a new
credit card, what does it mean

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:54.360
to get a credit card?
 

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.764
It means that you sell your
promise, right,

01:05:56.764 --> 01:05:57.510
to a buyer.
 

01:05:57.510 --> 01:06:01.530
Now, why should a buyer buy
your promise for 100,

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:03.980
you're promising to pay back in
the future,

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.471
so he's paying 100 for you when
the very same promise that

01:06:07.471 --> 01:06:10.902
someone made six months ago is
selling for 65 because the

01:06:10.902 --> 01:06:12.739
prices have all collapsed.
 

01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:15.610
They're not going to buy the
new promises when they can buy

01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:17.539
the old promises at such a low
price.

01:06:17.539 --> 01:06:20.202
Who's going to buy a new
mortgage when the old mortgages

01:06:20.202 --> 01:06:21.170
are selling at 65?
 

01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:24.414
Who's going to buy a new auto
loan when the old auto loans are

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:25.320
selling so low?
 

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.050
So nobody can get a new loan.
 

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:31.561
Nobody can sell a new promise,
and no business can sell its

01:06:31.561 --> 01:06:32.340
promise.
 

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.266
There are old businesses that
everybody understands whose

01:06:35.266 --> 01:06:38.090
bonds are out there being traded
at very low prices.

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:41.106
The investors are going to all
buy the old assets not the new

01:06:41.106 --> 01:06:41.559
assets.
 

01:06:41.559 --> 01:06:43.550
That's why activity collapses.
 

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:46.418
Then another terrible thing is,
what if the optimists are

01:06:46.418 --> 01:06:48.980
indispensable to the economy
like the big banks?

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.139
They go out of business and
then everything topples.

01:06:51.139 --> 01:06:53.849
Well, why didn't the big banks
take that into account?

01:06:53.849 --> 01:06:55.918
Shouldn't they have realized
that the losses would be so big

01:06:55.918 --> 01:06:57.039
and try to protect themselves?
 

01:06:57.039 --> 01:06:59.945
Well, they're not taking into
account that when they go under

01:06:59.945 --> 01:07:02.657
and the managers lose a lot of
money that there are other

01:07:02.657 --> 01:07:05.465
people they don't care about
like all their workers and the

01:07:05.465 --> 01:07:08.130
rest of the economy that's
losing even more that they're

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.679
not paying attention to.
 

01:07:09.679 --> 01:07:12.871
So they're not internalizing
all the losses when they go out

01:07:12.871 --> 01:07:13.630
of business.
 

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:17.641
Another incredibly bad thing
is, what we're suffering from

01:07:17.641 --> 01:07:19.329
now is, debt overhang.
 

01:07:19.329 --> 01:07:23.661
There are a tremendous number
of people, homeowners to name

01:07:23.661 --> 01:07:25.679
one, who are under water.
 

01:07:25.679 --> 01:07:29.190
That means they owe more money
than their house is worth,

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:33.219
or banks that have more debts
than the value of the assets

01:07:33.219 --> 01:07:35.288
they hold,
or firms that have more debt

01:07:35.288 --> 01:07:36.929
than the value of the assets
they hold.

01:07:36.929 --> 01:07:39.050
Now, many of these people don't
just go bankrupt.

01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:40.989
They keep going because maybe
they'll get lucky.

01:07:40.989 --> 01:07:44.483
Maybe some miracle will happen
and the stuff they own is going

01:07:44.483 --> 01:07:45.630
to go up in value.
 

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:46.929
So they don't stop.
 

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:49.643
They still exist,
but they're what people have

01:07:49.643 --> 01:07:50.670
called zombies.
 

01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:53.523
They're not doing anything
productive because what's the

01:07:53.523 --> 01:07:56.846
point in fixing up your house if
more than likely you're going to

01:07:56.846 --> 01:07:58.300
end up losing it anyway.
 

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.746
So all these homeowners are not
doing anything to take care of

01:08:00.746 --> 01:08:03.233
their houses,
the banks aren't making loans,

01:08:03.233 --> 01:08:06.612
these firms aren't making
productive investments because

01:08:06.612 --> 01:08:09.070
they know they're so far under
water.

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:12.474
So another horrible thing
happens is that if you try to

01:08:12.474 --> 01:08:15.123
collect the collateral when
people default,

01:08:15.123 --> 01:08:16.890
it's a costly operation.
 

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:20.393
So in sub-prime loans it takes
18 months to throw somebody out

01:08:20.393 --> 01:08:21.368
of their house.
 

01:08:21.368 --> 01:08:24.439
So during those 18 months the
guy's not paying his mortgage.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:28.039
He's not paying his taxes,
all of which you have to make

01:08:28.039 --> 01:08:28.630
up for.
 

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:31.055
He's trashing the house,
or if he doesn't trash it he

01:08:31.055 --> 01:08:33.713
leaves the house and some
neighbor trashes it and rips out

01:08:33.713 --> 01:08:35.020
everything in the house.
 

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.074
The average sub-prime loan,
when you force someone out of

01:08:38.074 --> 01:08:40.966
their house and sell it,
you get back 1 quarter of the

01:08:40.966 --> 01:08:42.439
value of the house now.
 

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:45.351
At the beginning people assumed
it could never be less than 80

01:08:45.351 --> 01:08:45.829
percent.
 

01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:47.609
Now it's 1 quarter.
 

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:52.337
Then there are other more
complicated things that can go

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:55.520
wrong which I'm going to skip
over.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.010
So let's just see what happens
now with housing.

01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:02.340
So what is it that's happening
with housing?

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.634
If you look at people
underwater, why are people

01:09:04.634 --> 01:09:06.050
defaulting on their houses?
 

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:07.770
It's because they're underwater.
 

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:11.128
So here is for every different
kind of mortgage,

01:09:11.128 --> 01:09:14.560
starting at sub-prime and going
down to prime.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.520
These are except government
loans.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.146
This is the fraction of people
who default every month,

01:09:20.146 --> 01:09:23.439
not every year,
and here's their loan to value.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:24.899
So how did I figure out the
loan to value?

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:26.850
I had to look at all the
original loans.

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:29.518
I did this house by house,
or Ellington,

01:09:29.518 --> 01:09:32.323
my hedge fund,
actually the guys there who

01:09:32.323 --> 01:09:36.154
were former students here,
they actually figured all this

01:09:36.154 --> 01:09:36.840
out.
 

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.319
They went house by house.
 

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:42.448
They got what the loan sizes
were on all the houses,

01:09:42.448 --> 01:09:45.203
and then using the Shiller
index they know what the house

01:09:45.203 --> 01:09:47.613
was bought for,
and assuming the zip code index

01:09:47.613 --> 01:09:50.462
dropped by 20 percent they
figured every house in the index

01:09:50.462 --> 01:09:52.797
went down by 20 percent,
so they could get the current

01:09:52.797 --> 01:09:53.460
value of the house.
 

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.699
So this is the ratio of the
loan to the current value of the

01:09:56.699 --> 01:09:57.140
house.
 

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.149
Current combined loan to value
ratio.

01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:03.569
So 140 means the loans all
together, first and second loans

01:10:03.569 --> 01:10:07.046
are 140 percent of what they
estimate the value of the house

01:10:07.046 --> 01:10:07.460
is.
 

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.680
So look at what happens.
 

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.492
If you're sub-prime and you've
got that--I can't see my--this

01:10:12.492 --> 01:10:14.970
is--140's over here somewhere,
right?

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:18.050
You're defaulting more than 6
percent a month.

01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:21.439
If you're 160 you're defaulting
at 8 percent.

01:10:21.439 --> 01:10:24.523
Every month 8 percent of those
people are becoming serious

01:10:24.523 --> 01:10:26.850
delinquent and probably will
never repay;

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:28.109
8 percent a month.
 

01:10:28.109 --> 01:10:30.250
In one year they're all going
to be gone.

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:35.028
So you can see this is
shockingly sensitive to loan to

01:10:35.028 --> 01:10:35.750
value.
 

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.756
It's not that people are
defaulting because they lost

01:10:37.756 --> 01:10:38.260
their jobs.
 

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.979
They're defaulting because it's
not worth it for them to pay.

01:10:41.979 --> 01:10:42.819
They're not stupid.
 

01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:46.118
Why should they pay 160,000
when the house is only worth

01:10:46.118 --> 01:10:46.720
100,000?
 

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.229
It's just how can they,
you know, times are tough.

01:10:49.229 --> 01:10:51.784
What are they going to do,
tell their children,

01:10:51.784 --> 01:10:53.229
well, we can't feed you?
 

01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:55.453
You can't go to school,
because daddy and mommy have to

01:10:55.453 --> 01:10:57.680
pay this thing where we don't
really have to pay it?

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.750
They're not going to do it.
 

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:02.622
So somehow, I couldn't convince
Larry Summers of this,

01:11:02.622 --> 01:11:03.720
I tried hard.
 

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:08.412
I wrote an Op-Ed in The New
York Times in October of

01:11:08.412 --> 01:11:08.960
2008.
 

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.090
I wrote another one in 7,
October.

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:13.630
No, a year ago.
 

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:16.868
What are we talking about,
October of 2008 then March of

01:11:16.868 --> 01:11:20.400
2009, saying that the only way
to save the housing market was

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.050
to write down principal.
 

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.436
Now, writing down principal
means saying,

01:11:24.436 --> 01:11:27.363
if the loan is 160,000,
maybe the house used to be

01:11:27.363 --> 01:11:29.930
200,000, the house is only
100,000 now.

01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:32.706
You just say,
"We're writing off 80,000

01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:33.609
of the loan.
 

01:11:33.609 --> 01:11:36.920
It's now only 80,000 that the
homeowner owes."

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.340
Now, who's going to pay for the
lost 80,000?

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:40.930
I say, nobody has to pay for it.
 

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:43.670
The government doesn't have to
pay a penny.

01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:46.341
The bond holder,
the lender would be better off

01:11:46.341 --> 01:11:49.998
writing down the loan to 80,000
than throwing the guy out of the

01:11:49.998 --> 01:11:52.380
house and getting 40,000 in the
end,

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.243
because once the loan is
written down to 80,000 the

01:11:55.243 --> 01:11:58.109
homeowner now has 20,000 of
equity in the house.

01:11:58.109 --> 01:12:02.033
He'll either work hard to fix
it up and spruce it up and sell

01:12:02.033 --> 01:12:04.649
it for 100,000,
or he'll actually pay the

01:12:04.649 --> 01:12:05.368
80,000.
 

01:12:05.368 --> 01:12:07.939
Either way the lender is going
to get 80,000,

01:12:07.939 --> 01:12:08.698
not 40,000.
 

01:12:08.698 --> 01:12:12.560
So this is a win-win as I
called it in the editorial with

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.527
Susan Koniak,
a coauthor, a law professor at

01:12:15.527 --> 01:12:16.010
BU.
 

01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:18.710
It's a win-win situation and
it's not happening.

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:22.802
And it's not happening because
the loans are all in the hands

01:12:22.802 --> 01:12:24.100
of the servicers.
 

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:27.627
So remember I said there was
this big pool with all the loans

01:12:27.627 --> 01:12:29.979
in them and then there were the
bonds.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:32.854
And so the bond holders,
these are the people who'd like

01:12:32.854 --> 01:12:34.788
to see the principal written
down,

01:12:34.788 --> 01:12:37.546
but the bond holders don't know
who the homeowners are and

01:12:37.546 --> 01:12:39.529
aren't legally allowed to talk
to them.

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:42.564
There's a servicer in the
middle who's a big bank who's

01:12:42.564 --> 01:12:44.590
writing the letter saying pay
up,

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:47.034
and if they pay up they
distribute the money to the bond

01:12:47.034 --> 01:12:47.479
holders.
 

01:12:47.479 --> 01:12:49.653
If they don't pay up the
servicer throws them out of the

01:12:49.653 --> 01:12:49.970
house.
 

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:52.814
The servicer,
the big bank doesn't own the

01:12:52.814 --> 01:12:53.368
loans.
 

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:57.262
They're getting paid a
percentage, like .5 percent of

01:12:57.262 --> 01:13:00.408
the principal,
so they have no incentive to

01:13:00.408 --> 01:13:02.430
write down these loans.
 

01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:05.430
If they write down the loan in
half they lose half their fee.

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:08.247
If they write down the loan to
80,000 and then the guy sells

01:13:08.247 --> 01:13:10.590
the house they don't service the
house anymore.

01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:11.939
They lose all their fees.
 

01:13:11.939 --> 01:13:14.927
Instead, Obama,
thanks to my classmate Larry

01:13:14.927 --> 01:13:17.569
Summers and all his other
advisors,

01:13:17.569 --> 01:13:20.850
they've given these servicers
license not to write down any

01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:22.725
loans,
but to pretend that they're

01:13:22.725 --> 01:13:24.750
writing down the interest on the
loans.

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:26.967
Now, that would be great,
and that's actually what's

01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:27.488
happening.
 

01:13:27.488 --> 01:13:29.881
The servicers are basically not
even kicking the people out of

01:13:29.881 --> 01:13:30.470
their houses.
 

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:33.029
So these people are not paying
anything now.

01:13:33.029 --> 01:13:36.119
There are millions of them not
paying anything still living in

01:13:36.119 --> 01:13:36.880
their houses.
 

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.528
In a year or two they're going
to get thrown out,

01:13:39.528 --> 01:13:41.788
but of course they're not going
to pay.

01:13:41.788 --> 01:13:44.956
This is the ideal situation for
the servicer because he's still

01:13:44.956 --> 01:13:47.507
collecting his fee,
the homeowners can't sell,

01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:50.255
they don't want to leave
because they're not paying

01:13:50.255 --> 01:13:52.426
anything,
and the bondholders are getting

01:13:52.426 --> 01:13:52.850
screwed.
 

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:55.770
So it's a catastrophe.
 

01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:56.854
And finally,
after a year,

01:13:56.854 --> 01:13:59.327
if you read the Op-Ed's in
The New York Times and

01:13:59.327 --> 01:14:01.149
the The Wall Street
Journal,

01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:03.497
in the last week or two they
have been deluged with people

01:14:03.497 --> 01:14:05.246
saying,
"Why aren't they writing

01:14:05.246 --> 01:14:06.260
down principal?"
 

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:09.305
So this is something that a
year or two ago I already

01:14:09.305 --> 01:14:10.010
advocated.
 

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:12.070
Anyone with any common sense
would have seen that was what

01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.275
was inevitably going to happen
and we didn't do anything about

01:14:14.275 --> 01:14:14.529
it.
 

01:14:14.529 --> 01:14:16.890
So I've got one more minute to
finish.

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:20.538
So what should we do about the
leverage cycle?

01:14:20.538 --> 01:14:24.810
Well, the thing to do about the
leverage cycle is to reverse the

01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:28.270
three bad things that happen in
a leverage cycle.

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:31.815
The first one was that there
was too little--the most

01:14:31.815 --> 01:14:34.340
important one is leverage
collapse.

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:38.750
So the Fed has to go and
increase leverage.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:42.037
So it used to be 30 to 1 or 20
to 1 now it's close to 1 to 1 on

01:14:42.037 --> 01:14:44.689
many assets, although it's gone
up a little bit.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:47.699
So the Fed has actually done
something about this.

01:14:47.699 --> 01:14:48.670
What does it have to do?
 

01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:50.420
Not lend at lower interest.
 

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.204
The Fed cut the interest rate
to 0 and said,

01:14:52.204 --> 01:14:53.698
"Look how great we
are."

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:55.640
Well, that did nothing
practically.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.609
The reason the Fed has cut the
interest rate to zero is to give

01:14:58.609 --> 01:15:01.581
money to the big banks because
the banks have to pay depositors

01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:02.538
like you and me.
 

01:15:02.538 --> 01:15:04.835
Now, on your checking account
or savings account you're

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:07.385
getting zero practically because
the Fed lowered the interest

01:15:07.385 --> 01:15:07.979
rate to 0.
 

01:15:07.979 --> 01:15:10.902
That means the banks make money
because they don't have to waste

01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:12.850
any money giving it to their
depositors.

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:15.552
That's the reason why the
interest rate went down to 0,

01:15:15.552 --> 01:15:18.658
and they try to dupe the public
into thinking it's because it's

01:15:18.658 --> 01:15:19.908
a Keynesian stimulus.
 

01:15:19.908 --> 01:15:22.000
It's not stimulating anything
basically.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.863
What you have to do is lend
with less collateral and the

01:15:24.863 --> 01:15:26.529
banks aren't willing to do it.
 

01:15:26.529 --> 01:15:29.750
The Fed has go around the banks
and lend with less collateral,

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:32.359
which I'm running out of time
so I can't explain how it's

01:15:32.359 --> 01:15:35.154
actually done that and that's
one of the big reasons leverage

01:15:35.154 --> 01:15:36.319
is starting to go up.
 

01:15:36.319 --> 01:15:39.872
Secondly, you have to replace
some of the natural buyers who

01:15:39.872 --> 01:15:43.064
have gone out of business,
the ones at the top who are

01:15:43.064 --> 01:15:44.569
doing all the buying.
 

01:15:44.569 --> 01:15:47.170
Without them the price is going
to be worth much less.

01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:49.140
The government is going to have
to do some buying.

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.162
So through the PPIP program and
other things it is doing some of

01:15:52.162 --> 01:15:52.500
that.
 

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.844
And then finally the first
thing, the most important thing,

01:15:55.844 --> 01:15:57.689
the crisis began with housing.
 

01:15:57.689 --> 01:16:01.585
Housing is the first thing you
have to do to lessen the

01:16:01.585 --> 01:16:05.118
instability and the uncertainty
in the economy.

01:16:05.118 --> 01:16:07.787
It's now started with housing
and it spread to other people

01:16:07.787 --> 01:16:08.800
who are under water.
 

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.779
That's where all the
uncertainty comes from.

01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:12.587
So we have to straighten out
who's going to go out of

01:16:12.587 --> 01:16:14.430
business and who's not going to
go out of business.

01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:17.060
We have to write down principal
of the homes.

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.810
That's the way to reduce that
uncertainty.

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.600
And in the long run we have to
prevent the next leverage cycle

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.430
by never letting leverage get so
high.

01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:28.122
So we have to keep the data and
we have to prevent people from

01:16:28.122 --> 01:16:30.000
asking for so little margins.
 

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000

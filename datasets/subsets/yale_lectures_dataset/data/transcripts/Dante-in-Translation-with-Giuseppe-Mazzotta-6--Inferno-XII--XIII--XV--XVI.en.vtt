00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.774
Prof: With Canto XII--
from Canto XII to Canto XIV we

00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:11.090
are still in what is known the
middle ground,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:19.610
which is a moral ground:
the middle ground of Hell.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.920
We are between the area of
incontinence,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.354
that we saw in the last few
weeks and the area of malice:

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:33.681
this middle ground,
which is a ground of violence

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:37.890
or bestiality,
as it is also called.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.047
What I want to draw your
attention to first of all is the

00:00:43.047 --> 00:00:46.640
fact that Dante's presiding
symbols,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.640
the presiding figures in this
area are all figures--

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.434
hybrid figures,
figures of doubleness:

00:00:56.434 --> 00:01:01.048
the Minotaur and the Centaurs
in Canto XII.

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:07.340
You have the Harpies,
the filthy, foul figures,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.546
monsters with the face of women
devouring the foliage and the

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:18.830
trees in Canto XIII.
 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.281
And then, this will go on with
other emblems of,

00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:31.010
again, monsters and the figure
of--but that's the figure of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.170
fraud.
 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.739
I don't want to get into that.
 

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:38.750
Figures of--again,
Minotaurs and Centaurs in XV.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.420
What is the importance of these
figures?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.617
There are neo-Platonic
images--figures of Centaurs,

00:01:47.617 --> 00:01:54.436
Minotaurs--understood to
signify the doubleness of human

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:55.800
beings.
 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.162
The capacity of human beings to
join within themselves both the

00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:08.863
human and the bestial,
or the animal experiences,

00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:12.068
possibilities of being.
 

00:02:12.068 --> 00:02:16.921
In neo-Platonic thinking,
especially in the twelfth

00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:20.366
century,
to give you the historical ring

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:22.188
to it,
we are saying the twelfth

00:02:22.188 --> 00:02:23.930
century, the so-called
Chartrians,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.490
and more so in the
fifteenth-century Florence,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.246
with Pico, the figures--the
whole idea is that human beings

00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:39.500
are really a kind of copular or
neutral entities capable of--

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.180
;who have the potential of this
doubleness within them.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.323
They're capable of becoming
fully rational or descending

00:02:47.323 --> 00:02:48.680
into bestiality.
 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.610
The position in the ladder of
being is one of utter

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.190
indeterminacy.
 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.550
In the twelfth century,
this is not the case.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.370
They still believe in these
images.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.331
They are fixed images of
entities, creatures capable of

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:09.387
being, at the same time,
expressing these dual impulses,

00:03:09.387 --> 00:03:12.878
the bestial and the human
impulse.

00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:17.098
This is--Dante seems to be
quite aware that somehow--

00:03:17.098 --> 00:03:22.174
that these symbols do not
completely characterize what

00:03:22.174 --> 00:03:26.610
human beings really are,
that the ability of human

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.937
beings to redeem themselves,
to free themselves out of a

00:03:31.937 --> 00:03:37.530
certain state or fall,
plunge, into the opposite state.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.901
There's a difference between
the symbols and what human

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.150
beings are going to be able to
do.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.175
This is really the--these are
why I focused on canto--I asked

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:52.530
you to read Canto XII,
where Dante places tyrants.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.860
It's really an anonymous canto.
 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.020
There are no great figures,
no great personalities.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.687
We do know, and Dante gives a
list of all the tyrants of his

00:04:00.687 --> 00:04:03.610
time and the tyrants:
Dionysius of Syracuse,

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.397
Alexander, the Ezzolino of his
own time, in Padua,

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:11.229
etc.
 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.956
They are figures of tyranny,
but at the same time he places

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:20.358
next to them figures of
educators, figures of teachers,

00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:23.129
such as, for instance,
Chiron.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.175
And this is a little bit
ironic, because he says,

00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:31.726
come straight after Dante's
exemplary representation of

00:04:31.726 --> 00:04:34.930
Virgil's own teaching in Canto
XI.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.863
You remember when Virgil goes
on explaining in great detail

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.819
the shape of Inferno.
 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.956
Here now, once again Dante
takes the other perspective,

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:49.940
that which he takes to be the
tyranny of teaching.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.334
That is to say,
a sort of teaching does not

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:56.646
allow that freedom,
that the very symbols,

00:04:56.646 --> 00:05:01.819
the very presiding figures of
this canto, also seem to deny.

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.350
They are forever man and beast.
 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.220
And Dante claims,
clearly, that there is a

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.560
teaching that has to allow the
sort of the freedom to move,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.370
either in the direction of
rationality or the freedom,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.105
or the choice,
to move in its opposite

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:17.670
direction.
 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.550
This is the substance,
I think, of Canto XII.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.985
We come, though,
to Canto XIII which is one of

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:29.649
the most remarkable cantos of
Inferno,

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:33.538
it's the canto of the suicides,
and Dante encounters here a

00:05:33.538 --> 00:05:36.918
figure--
a poet, a very well-known poet,

00:05:36.918 --> 00:05:40.850
a very well-known figure of
maybe the late--

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.199
the middle part of the
thirteenth century called Pier

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.370
delle Vigne.
 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.322
And as you read through the
canto, you will see that he puns

00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:52.199
on both terms of the name.
 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.910
Peter and he thinks of himself
as a figure of Peter,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.699
one who holds the keys,
the two keys of the kingdom,

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.295
the keys of power,
but also the last name Pier

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:06.639
delle Vigne,
meaning of the vineyard.

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.240
And this is--of course we are
going to witness now a

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.249
metamorphosis of a human being:
the metamorphosis of a human

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.281
being,
from being human to becoming a

00:06:15.281 --> 00:06:16.930
vegetable, a plant.
 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.954
This is the story of suicides
and we shall see what Dante

00:06:20.954 --> 00:06:22.680
thinks about suicides.
 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.586
What he--why does he think that
such an evil as to be condemned

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:31.069
in this area of violence against
the self?

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:33.999
We do know that Dante--I don't
have to go over this but you do

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:36.639
know that Dante distinguishes
violence against self,

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.560
violence against others as in
Canto XII,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.266
violence against nature and
violence even against the

00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:46.350
divinity in Canto IV.
 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.060
Let's look at Canto XIII and a
little bit of some textual

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.529
details and then we'll discuss
some of the issues of the canto.

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:01.334
"Nessus had not yet
reached the other side again

00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:06.603
when we set out through a wood
which was not marked by any

00:07:06.603 --> 00:07:07.990
path."
 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.793
Here, there seems to be no
directions at all,

00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:15.596
almost as if Dante were
revisiting Canto I of

00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:17.240
Inferno.
 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.387
The same idea of--a sense of
loss of self and adumbrating

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:27.889
what suicide may also be at some
level.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.545
A loss of--some idea of one's
own being, some idea of what one

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:33.920
is or should be.
 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.069
We are not told anything more
but then--

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:39.617
rather Dante shifts to a
description of the natural

00:07:39.617 --> 00:07:42.040
landscape,
the world of nature,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.939
the landscape and you--
as you read you must be struck

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:52.516
by how he's highlighting a
peculiar style and I want to

00:07:52.516 --> 00:07:57.639
emphasize this style,
this figuration of style.

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:00.216
"No green leaves,
but of dusky hue,"

00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:01.649
a series of antithesis.
 

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.312
First of all,
a series of antithesis,

00:08:04.312 --> 00:08:06.680
but also anaphoras,
negatives.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.961
"No smooth bows,
but knotted and warped,"

00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:13.307
antithetical but at the same
time repetition of this

00:08:13.307 --> 00:08:15.605
"no,"
anaphoric, "no,

00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:16.589
no."
 

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:20.100
"No fruits were there,
but poisonous thorns.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.074
No breaks so harsh and dense
have these savage beasts that

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:28.050
hate the tilled lands between
Cecina and Corneto."

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.163
We are in what--in a place,
in a landscape where this is

00:08:32.163 --> 00:08:35.355
the style called,
there is a technical term for

00:08:35.355 --> 00:08:39.140
the rhetoric Dante deploys,
it's called privatio

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.620
which simply means a privation.
 

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.336
Emphasizing,
there's nothing positive here

00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:48.376
but it's a way of subtracting
from what is missing rather than

00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:49.570
what is there.
 

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.970
That is really a negation,
the style of a negation,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.288
but at the same time through
the antithesis,

00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:59.298
making us think about how the
world might be,

00:08:59.298 --> 00:09:02.960
"no green leaves,
but of dusky hue."

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.610
This is a style of taking away
and again taking away from any

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.658
substantial description of the
landscape.

00:09:12.658 --> 00:09:15.549
"No breaks so harsh and
dense," etc.

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:19.528
"Here make their nests,
the loathsome Harpies,"

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:23.423
again hybrid figures,
just as we had the Centaur in

00:09:23.423 --> 00:09:28.024
the previous canto,"
from the Strophades with dismal

00:09:28.024 --> 00:09:31.778
presage of future ill;
they have wide wings and human

00:09:31.778 --> 00:09:34.460
necks and faces,
feet clawed and their great

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.730
bellies feathered,
and they make lamentations on

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.490
the strange trees."
 

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:45.076
So we are in the world--we're
in the world of negation,

00:09:45.076 --> 00:09:50.558
a world of monstrosities,
and a world of privation.

00:09:50.558 --> 00:09:54.158
What is happening to human
beings here?

00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:57.888
That's really the question that
he seems to be raising,

00:09:57.888 --> 00:10:01.408
but let me just proceed even
more carefully here.

00:10:01.408 --> 00:10:06.508
The whole scene recasts an
important scene in Book III of

00:10:06.508 --> 00:10:08.330
the Aeneid.
 

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.668
This is indeed also a major
confrontation between Dante--

00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:17.322
the whole canto dramatizes a
major confrontation between

00:10:17.322 --> 00:10:19.620
Dante and Virgil,
the author of the

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.080
Aeneid--about some of
these issues.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.299
What is a metamorphosis?
 

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:24.778
What is nature?
 

00:10:24.778 --> 00:10:27.700
What is the place of human
beings within nature?

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.350
Because Dante and Virgil think
in sharply different ways.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.820
For the metamorphosis,
for instance,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.720
the scene that Dante here is
recalling,

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.058
is the scene of Book III of the
Aeneid,

00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:44.240
where Polydorus,
a cousin of Aeneas,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.964
has been killed and he's--you
remember there is this speaking

00:10:47.964 --> 00:10:49.330
tree seen there too.
 

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.850
Aeneas arrives in Thracia,
which is Asia Minor,

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.932
he thinks that his--that is the
place which the gods have

00:10:55.932 --> 00:11:00.734
assigned to him,
and he does that which he feels

00:11:00.734 --> 00:11:03.360
is,
that which he knows has to be

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.471
done,
whatever and whenever you want

00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:09.970
to build a city:
consecrate the ground.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.936
Hallow the ground by building
an altar and by purifying the

00:11:14.936 --> 00:11:16.820
ground through fire.
 

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.447
As he tries to do this,
the altar is always at the

00:11:19.447 --> 00:11:22.863
center in the Aeneid,
at the center of the human

00:11:22.863 --> 00:11:27.008
community he's pulling,
he's plucking a bough and he

00:11:27.008 --> 00:11:29.379
hears a voice;
mysterious.

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:32.783
He shudders,
he's scared and the voice

00:11:32.783 --> 00:11:33.519
comes.
 

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:36.250
It's Polydorus,
his cousin, who tells the story

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.989
that he has been killed because
of the sacrileges that have been

00:11:39.989 --> 00:11:40.820
committed.
 

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.408
Whatever consecration Virgil
wants us to believe,

00:11:44.408 --> 00:11:48.423
to think of cannot be really
carried out because a sacrilege

00:11:48.423 --> 00:11:52.711
has been that of the killing of
Polydorus on account of the gold

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:57.919
that he carried--
they wanted to plunder him of;

00:11:57.919 --> 00:11:59.320
they want to rob him of.
 

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:06.155
Aeneas hears a voice,
'Why do you pull me out of

00:12:06.155 --> 00:12:07.320
this?'
 

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.453
And Polydorus simply asks that
a proper burial be given to him

00:12:12.453 --> 00:12:16.408
so that he can descend
peacefully into Hades.

00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:20.423
Aeneas complies and leaves that
place in the knowledge that is

00:12:20.423 --> 00:12:22.528
not the place assigned to him.
 

00:12:22.528 --> 00:12:26.345
The sacrilege was such that he
cannot really quite found the

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:30.288
city on the place of the crime,
of such an atrocious crime.

00:12:30.288 --> 00:12:33.399
Dante's revisiting that
particular scene.

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:36.986
In fact, I repeat,
Canto XIII recasts that scene

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:41.261
and it's a major encounter with
Virgil and Virgil's whole

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.009
pattern, whole system of values.
 

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:46.759
And let's see how this is going
to continue.

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:53.279
We have the background with
some--stylistics of negativity,

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:57.053
styles of negation,
as if suicide were this

00:12:57.053 --> 00:13:00.740
fundamental sacrilege that
denies the--

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.908
some reality that we don't know
yet.

00:13:04.908 --> 00:13:09.914
"And the good master began
to speak to me,"

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:15.787
so Virgil intervenes reminding
us that this is indeed Book III

00:13:15.787 --> 00:13:19.057
of the Aeneid,
which by the way,

00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:22.006
another little detail,
Book III of the Aeneid

00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:25.870
is the book of the Aeneid
Dante draws from the most.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.763
If some of you want to write a
paper on how many scenes

00:13:29.763 --> 00:13:33.871
Dante--and why--you should go
and--go ahead and write that

00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:35.168
kind of paper.
 

00:13:35.168 --> 00:13:39.404
One reason is that Book III of
the Aeneid is the book of

00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:42.409
Aeneas' exile,
the homelessness of Aeneas.

00:13:42.409 --> 00:13:44.308
Aeneas was still nowhere.
 

00:13:44.308 --> 00:13:50.200
He is just--has just left Troy,
he is going to--

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.990
about to leave Carthage,
Dido's home,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.366
and about to get into Sicily,
but never really quite being

00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:00.889
able to say,
'this is really where I belong.'

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:04.413
This is really the place where
one can call home,

00:14:04.413 --> 00:14:06.690
whatever that may be for him.
 

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.658
"The good master began to
speak to me,"

00:14:08.658 --> 00:14:11.288
Virgil interrupts,
"'Before thou go farther,

00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:15.712
know that thou art in the
second round and shalt be until

00:14:15.712 --> 00:14:20.424
thou come to the horrible sand;
look well therefore,

00:14:20.424 --> 00:14:26.635
and thou shalt see things which
will discredit my telling of

00:14:26.635 --> 00:14:28.110
them."
 

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.389
This is a hyperbole on the part
of Virgil.

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:33.808
You are going to see what I
have been describing.

00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:36.220
In a sense, this is the reason
why I'm the--

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.220
an authority and why I'm
guiding through--

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.220
you--through this because I
have seen,

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.511
imaginatively at least,
I have seen some of the things

00:14:44.511 --> 00:14:47.678
that you are experiencing and
what you will see,

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:52.914
the reality of it all,
will exceed my own abilities to

00:14:52.914 --> 00:14:54.200
tell of it.
 

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.029
A stance of humility on the
part of the teacher.

00:14:57.029 --> 00:15:01.557
Therefore, a mild correction of
the claims about teaching in

00:15:01.557 --> 00:15:02.480
Canto XII.
 

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.385
We said this is one theme that
seems to be running through and

00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:07.860
then Dante continues.
 

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.558
"I heard from every side
wailings poured forth,

00:15:11.558 --> 00:15:14.679
and saw none that made them,
so that,

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:19.902
all bewildered I stopped"--
and now another conceit that we

00:15:19.902 --> 00:15:23.674
should come back to:
"I think he thought I

00:15:23.674 --> 00:15:25.070
thought."
 

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:30.241
It's clearly--we call it an
amplification,

00:15:30.241 --> 00:15:37.559
a way of playing with one verb,
but also inferring what the

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:41.850
thought of the other would be.
 

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.650
It's a descent into a
kind--into the boundaries of

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.662
one's own mind;
a way in which Dante dramatizes

00:15:49.662 --> 00:15:54.351
the fact that there's no real
conversation now going on

00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:56.610
between him and Virgil.
 

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.679
It's a way of descending into
the, what I call exactly,

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:05.528
the loneliness of Dante's own
thoughts.

00:16:05.528 --> 00:16:07.970
"I think,"
and then reiterated once again.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.860
Anaphoric: "I think he
thought, I thought."

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.130
More of this later--"that
all these voices among the

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.200
trunks came from people who were
hiding from us,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.933
so the Master said:
'If thou break off any little

00:16:18.933 --> 00:16:24.259
branch from one of these trees,
all thy present thoughts will

00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:25.830
prove mistaken.'
 

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.827
Then I put out my hand a little
and plucked a twig from a great

00:16:29.827 --> 00:16:32.019
thorn and its trunk cried."
 

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:35.613
This is Aeneid III,
lines 39 and following,

00:16:35.613 --> 00:16:39.133
that's the way the Book III of
the Aeneid,

00:16:39.133 --> 00:16:39.940
begins.
 

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.178
"'Why dost thou tear me?
 

00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:44.812
When it turned dark with blood
it began again,

00:16:44.812 --> 00:16:46.750
'Why manglest thou me?
 

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.538
Hast thou no spirit of pity?
 

00:16:48.538 --> 00:16:52.164
We were men and now are turned
to stalks, thy hand might well

00:16:52.164 --> 00:16:55.548
have been more pitiful had we
been souls of serpents.'

00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:58.807
As a green brand that is
burning at one end drips from

00:16:58.807 --> 00:17:01.450
the other and hisses with
escaping wind,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.299
so from the broken splinter
came forth words and blood

00:17:05.299 --> 00:17:07.490
together;
at which, I left for the tip

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.028
and stood as one afraid."
 

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:12.298
And Virgil intervenes:
"'If he could have

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:14.393
believed before,
wounded soul,

00:17:14.393 --> 00:17:16.807
what he had never seen but in
my lines,"

00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:19.291
my Aeneid,
"he would not have

00:17:19.291 --> 00:17:22.941
stretched forth his hand against
thee,' my Sage replied 'but the

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:26.300
thing being incredible made me
prompt him to the deed which

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.460
grieves myself.
 

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.476
But tell him who thou wast,
so that, for some amends,

00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:34.012
he may revive thy fame in the
world above when he is permitted

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:37.527
to return.'"
The irony of reviving the fame

00:17:37.527 --> 00:17:41.480
in a place where there is no
possibility of revival;

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.558
there is no possibility of
coming back to life.

00:17:44.558 --> 00:17:49.057
Indeed, where the natural world
is not capable of behaving

00:17:49.057 --> 00:17:53.398
naturally, where there is no
real growth, no real change

00:17:53.398 --> 00:17:54.108
here.
 

00:17:54.108 --> 00:17:57.788
It's always going to be--it's
the most unnatural of places.

00:17:57.788 --> 00:18:02.106
So the shadow of this
unnaturalness is going to be

00:18:02.106 --> 00:18:07.569
cast over the scene with the
encounter with Brunetto Latini.

00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:09.380
What is this idea here?
 

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.842
In a sense, this is already the
confrontation between Virgil and

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:15.865
Dante: "if he could have
believed that which he had

00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:17.019
discovered."
 

00:18:17.019 --> 00:18:22.406
It is as if Dante wants to test
the truth value of what he had

00:18:22.406 --> 00:18:24.880
read in the Aeneid.
 

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.332
He had read the scene of the
Aeneid,

00:18:27.332 --> 00:18:30.368
let me see how this is,
and finds out that that which

00:18:30.368 --> 00:18:33.640
he sees is entirely different
from Virgil's account.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.215
In a way we are really--he is
really drawing his--our

00:18:37.215 --> 00:18:40.450
attention to what we call the
act of reading.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.400
How do we read?
 

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.548
What do we believe when we read
the story?

00:18:44.548 --> 00:18:47.791
When we read a story we yield,
in many ways to the story,

00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:48.430
its part.
 

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.743
We want the story that we read
to read us as much as we want to

00:18:52.743 --> 00:18:53.440
read it.
 

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.186
We want the story to explain us
to ourselves,

00:18:56.186 --> 00:18:59.058
to hold a mirror up to us to
see who we are;

00:18:59.058 --> 00:19:04.602
but Dante is literally also
implying the need to violate the

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:07.420
letter of the Aeneid.
 

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:14.030
He had to do because whatever
Virgil had described exceeded

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.833
believability,
it was just an incredible

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:21.858
account and he has to test the
reality of that scene.

00:19:21.858 --> 00:19:25.605
So that's really the part of
the confrontation between the

00:19:25.605 --> 00:19:26.000
two.
 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.480
And now, let's see what he
hears: "and the trunk said,

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.538
thou so allurest me with thy
gentle speech."

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:35.328
It's what we call
captatio.

00:19:35.328 --> 00:19:38.614
I won't have to write it here
on the board,

00:19:38.614 --> 00:19:41.430
the captatio
benevolentiae.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:45.057
You know, it's a great
rhetorical trick:

00:19:45.057 --> 00:19:50.761
whenever you give a speech,
or whatever people speak to you

00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:54.529
in public,
especially, or privately,

00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:58.705
they will engage in this,
a way of capturing your

00:19:58.705 --> 00:20:02.760
benevolence by telling a story,
playing something about their

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.318
modesty or whatever.
 

00:20:04.318 --> 00:20:05.990
Now you saw "allurest
me."

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.440
It's so--fascinates,
so I--the lure of your

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.240
rhetorical language or your
rhetorical powers.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.883
We are dealing with rhetoric,
first of all,

00:20:13.883 --> 00:20:16.903
with style and now with the
language of the text,

00:20:16.903 --> 00:20:19.798
and now with the language of
the exchange.

00:20:19.798 --> 00:20:25.106
So it is as if the suicide has
a lot to do with this trait of

00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:29.000
language, this characteristic of
language.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.693
"Thou so allurest me with
thy gentle speech that I cannot

00:20:32.693 --> 00:20:36.450
be silent, and let it not burden
you if I am beguiled into talk

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.480
for a little.
 

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.680
I am he that held both the
keys."

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.519
Here is the pun on Peter.
 

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:44.310
Now it's as if he were St.
 

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.239
Peter who holds the two keys of
the kingdom of Frederick's

00:20:48.239 --> 00:20:48.858
heart.
 

00:20:48.858 --> 00:20:53.588
Now the--you can see that all
the language of believing,

00:20:53.588 --> 00:20:57.385
faith, that has been going
around in the previous lines of

00:20:57.385 --> 00:21:01.848
the canto seem to be gravitating
around the figure of Frederick,

00:21:01.848 --> 00:21:06.198
the king, who is a kind of,
let's call him the god of the

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:09.096
city,
because his name that's what it

00:21:09.096 --> 00:21:09.608
means.
 

00:21:09.608 --> 00:21:12.084
In Italian especially,
it's not--in English we say

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:12.690
Frederick.
 

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.377
In Italian, you say
Federico which really

00:21:16.377 --> 00:21:19.358
repeats the idea of faith within
it.

00:21:19.358 --> 00:21:21.992
As if all faith,
all beliefs,

00:21:21.992 --> 00:21:27.920
really have to converge and go
toward this emperor of Sicily.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.240
He's a Hohenstaufen,
he's a famous--

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.364
a German king,
ruling over Sicily and Pier

00:21:34.364 --> 00:21:38.631
delle Vigne was the chancellor
of the Empire and also the

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:40.460
founder, by the way.
 

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.960
Let me say something more about
him.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.920
He's the founder,
he's the one who conceived the

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.193
first university--
the first state university in

00:21:48.193 --> 00:21:50.636
Europe,
the University of Naples,

00:21:50.636 --> 00:21:54.636
because Frederick wanted a
university that would prepare

00:21:54.636 --> 00:21:57.560
lawyers,
diplomats, people who could go

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.902
on state missions,
who could write papers for the

00:22:02.902 --> 00:22:03.828
state.
 

00:22:03.828 --> 00:22:07.791
And it would not be at all one
of the schools that the way

00:22:07.791 --> 00:22:11.268
universities were under the
aegis of, for instance,

00:22:11.268 --> 00:22:13.980
the canon lawyers,
the theologians.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.619
So, this was the first lay,
secular school in Europe.

00:22:17.619 --> 00:22:20.458
It was an imperial see;
unlike, for instance,

00:22:20.458 --> 00:22:22.894
the University of Paris,
which was under

00:22:22.894 --> 00:22:26.887
the--simultaneously under the
dominion of both the Bishop of

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:31.220
Paris and the King of France and
hence a lot of conflicts between

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.098
the two.
 

00:22:32.098 --> 00:22:36.058
So, he's chancellor,
he is the founder of the

00:22:36.058 --> 00:22:37.230
university.
 

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.660
He was a poet and he also
compiled the so-called

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.088
institutes of justice for the
kingdom where--

00:22:44.088 --> 00:22:48.661
which is all inspired--his
institutes are all inspired by

00:22:48.661 --> 00:22:54.002
the language of moderation,
the language of idealistic

00:22:54.002 --> 00:22:58.480
language of order,
and natural law that could

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.858
follow--that could organize the
state.

00:23:01.858 --> 00:23:05.588
And clearly the reality is
that, by his act,

00:23:05.588 --> 00:23:09.858
Pier delle Vigne shows that
there's no such a thing,

00:23:09.858 --> 00:23:13.255
or that he doesn't really
believe in what he claims to be

00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:16.650
the principle of the legal
organization of the state,

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.028
which is natural law.
 

00:23:19.028 --> 00:23:22.000
"I am he that held both
the keys to Frederick's heart

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.392
and turned them,
locking and unlocking,

00:23:24.392 --> 00:23:27.705
so softly that I kept nearly
every other man from his

00:23:27.705 --> 00:23:28.788
secrets."
 

00:23:28.788 --> 00:23:32.740
He is the secretary of the
emperor.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.788
A word, as you know,
which becomes very crucial

00:23:36.788 --> 00:23:39.338
throughout the Renaissance.
 

00:23:39.338 --> 00:23:41.795
He's a counselor,
but a secretary means--comes

00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:44.358
from the--it's a word that comes
from the Latin,

00:23:44.358 --> 00:23:45.558
from 'to secrete.'
 

00:23:45.558 --> 00:23:49.613
That this is as if--he's the
figure who distills,

00:23:49.613 --> 00:23:53.665
that's secreting,
distills that which the emperor

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:56.200
keeps hidden in his heart.
 

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.118
Some of his--he has this power
of distillation,

00:23:59.118 --> 00:24:00.980
and knowing also and through
this distillation,

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.666
what has to be shared and what
has to be kept concealed from

00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:06.700
all others.
 

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.284
Quite a figure of prestige,
he views himself as a

00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:16.058
strict--and he was--collaborator
of the emperor.

00:24:16.058 --> 00:24:18.531
"And I brought,"
again, "such

00:24:18.531 --> 00:24:19.740
faithfulness."
 

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.328
Now that question of fidelity
in the way we read the text,

00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:28.000
in the way we believe what we
read is brought into a sort of

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.390
refracted--
into the language of

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.858
fidelity--loyalty as
faithfulness to the emperor,

00:24:33.858 --> 00:24:36.259
"to the glorious office
that I lost for it for sleep and

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:36.940
strength."
 

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.710
The causes of the suicide--the
causes of his tragic--

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.180
of Pier delle Vigne's tragic
downfall,

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.503
are going to be "the
harlot,"

00:24:47.503 --> 00:24:49.400
the personification for envy.
 

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:58.494
The sin--there is--that Aquinas
for instance views as the worst

00:24:58.494 --> 00:25:07.150
possible sin because it is a
really very close to hatred.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:11.500
And close to hatred in the
sense that it has nothing--

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.420
all sins have some positivity
to it and all you--

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.798
you are a glutton--it's because
that piece of cake,

00:25:18.798 --> 00:25:21.828
there's something about it that
lures you to it.

00:25:21.828 --> 00:25:26.819
You are--you have this--you are
proud, it's because you really

00:25:26.819 --> 00:25:30.337
have some sense of your
excellence, or some,

00:25:30.337 --> 00:25:34.019
which is a real sin,
contempt for others;

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:38.348
you believe that others are not
as good as you think you are.

00:25:38.348 --> 00:25:42.105
It's not so much that you look
at yourself as stretching the

00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:45.032
hand toward the divinity,
the pride of Lucifer,

00:25:45.032 --> 00:25:45.670
right?
 

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:50.089
The real sin is that you kick
around those who you perceive

00:25:50.089 --> 00:25:51.308
are below you.
 

00:25:51.308 --> 00:25:55.500
All sins have some kind of
positivity except for one,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.643
and that's envy,
because envy only likes

00:25:58.643 --> 00:25:59.608
nothing.
 

00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:02.980
It's not jealousy,
you do have the kind of story.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.855
All of you, I'm sure are
readers of Othello,

00:26:05.855 --> 00:26:09.400
because that's really a
confrontation between envy and

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.269
jealousy.
 

00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:13.250
There is the envy of--Othello
may be jealous,

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.029
but the one who is really
envious is Iago,

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:19.351
one wants nothing--he doesn't
want this Desdemona,

00:26:19.351 --> 00:26:20.298
himself.
 

00:26:20.298 --> 00:26:23.038
He can't stand the idea that
the other guy is happy:

00:26:23.038 --> 00:26:23.789
that's envy.
 

00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:26.259
Jealousy is the fear of losing.
 

00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:29.471
Jealousy is almost an
ingredient of love,

00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:31.640
Andreas Cappellanus says.
 

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:37.604
If you really are in love there
must be some rational aspect to

00:26:37.604 --> 00:26:43.279
have jealousy in it but here are
the cause of the court,

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:48.045
the court which is always--that
little microcosm,

00:26:48.045 --> 00:26:48.838
right?
 

00:26:48.838 --> 00:26:52.308
Even for Dante who writes a
treaty from language,

00:26:52.308 --> 00:26:56.986
even the theorists of--about
the function of language in the

00:26:56.986 --> 00:26:59.665
court,
because the court is a place of

00:26:59.665 --> 00:27:02.391
laws,
is the place of poetry,

00:27:02.391 --> 00:27:06.160
is the place of political
persuasion.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.186
These are the various
dimensions of the powers of

00:27:10.186 --> 00:27:11.108
language.
 

00:27:11.108 --> 00:27:14.568
And then you do know about the
court from Andreas Capellanus,

00:27:14.568 --> 00:27:19.105
that's another topic for you to
explore: Dante's figuration of

00:27:19.105 --> 00:27:22.750
the court and from all possible
points of view.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:27.097
Here Dante views--now the
court, this microcosm of

00:27:27.097 --> 00:27:32.601
political order and idealism has
been literally poisoned by the

00:27:32.601 --> 00:27:37.125
presence of--
contaminated by the presence of

00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:37.710
envy.
 

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.005
"The harlot that never
turned her shameless eyes,"

00:27:41.005 --> 00:27:42.960
and you understand that
metaphor.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.240
It's not so much that it
belongs to the harlot,

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:51.151
the fact is that the word envy
as you know is a word that in

00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:55.858
Italian or in English,
"invidious."

00:27:55.858 --> 00:28:01.016
It's invidia,
which is etymologized as non

00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:02.230
video.
 

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.405
So, it's always an idea,
it's a kind of blindness to the

00:28:05.405 --> 00:28:08.814
world outside and here Dante's
punning with his "turned

00:28:08.814 --> 00:28:10.490
the shameless eyes."
 

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.752
It would seem to be a sort of
representation of the harlot and

00:28:14.752 --> 00:28:18.976
the seduction of the harlot,
but it also plays on this

00:28:18.976 --> 00:28:22.267
notion of what envy really
means."..

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:27.038
.the common bane and the vice
of courts, inflamed all minds

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.107
against me...
 

00:28:28.107 --> 00:28:32.880
" Look how the language
now sort of takes over.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.912
It takes over and Dante is just
playing with and multiplying

00:28:36.912 --> 00:28:40.260
these terms, the same terms
repeated over and over

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.558
again." ..
 

00:28:41.558 --> 00:28:44.824
and those inflamed,
so inflamed Augustus,

00:28:44.824 --> 00:28:49.067
the name for the emperor,
or Caesar, "that happy

00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:52.250
honors turned to dismal
woes."

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:57.488
This is the formula for--the
formulaic definition of tragedy

00:28:57.488 --> 00:29:01.306
that he's giving:
"happy honors turn to

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:03.259
dismal woes."
 

00:29:03.259 --> 00:29:08.413
Pier delle Vigne is aware of
his own tragic destiny,

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:13.869
his own tragic downfall,
and seals his fate as a tragic

00:29:13.869 --> 00:29:14.778
fate.
 

00:29:14.778 --> 00:29:18.476
And, "now,
my mind in scornful temper

00:29:18.476 --> 00:29:22.713
thinking by dying to escape from
scorn, made me,

00:29:22.713 --> 00:29:25.690
just, unjust to myself."
 

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.118
And once again the style of
repetitions--

00:29:28.118 --> 00:29:33.789
anaphoric--Pier delle Vigne
constitutes himself into a

00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:39.673
closed circuit and the doubling
of language reflects the

00:29:39.673 --> 00:29:41.598
self-babbling.
 

00:29:41.598 --> 00:29:46.818
Let me just go on and tell you
what I think is going on here.

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:49.740
When you read the sentence:
"...

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.712
by dying ...
 

00:29:50.712 --> 00:29:54.038
made me, just,
unjust to myself."

00:29:54.038 --> 00:29:57.875
And the obvious question that I
think you should really ask,

00:29:57.875 --> 00:30:00.733
if I gave you a chance to ask,
you would ask,

00:30:00.733 --> 00:30:03.140
how many selves are there in
him?

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:03.753
"..
 

00:30:03.753 --> 00:30:06.826
.made me, just,
unjust to myself..."

00:30:06.826 --> 00:30:09.130
How many persons are there?
 

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:13.750
How many figures are there in
one, in Pier delle Vigne?

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:22.564
The text that best glosses this
scene, this tragic of carentia,

00:30:22.564 --> 00:30:26.179
appears in The City of
God, of St.

00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:30.518
Augustine, Book I,
where Augustine is telling the

00:30:30.518 --> 00:30:35.851
story of Rome and the death
of--and the end of the period of

00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:37.750
the monarchy.
 

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.858
You know the seven kings, right?
 

00:30:39.858 --> 00:30:41.990
The story goes and with
the--the story of the seven--

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:47.710
the expulsion of the Tarquins,
the last king,

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:52.450
is attributed to the fact that
the famous matron of Rome by the

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.575
name of Lucretia,
whom Dante by the way,

00:30:55.575 --> 00:30:57.460
mentions in Limbo though.
 

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.029
He has a lot of ideas about
who, or what,

00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:03.528
is the guilt of a suicide.
 

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:06.838
We shall see that a great
figure from an antiquity,

00:31:06.838 --> 00:31:11.188
Cato, a suicide,
will appear and will inaugurate

00:31:11.188 --> 00:31:14.519
the Purgatorio in Canto
I,

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:17.900
so Dante's always making some
crucial discriminations,

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.858
crucial distinctions.
 

00:31:18.858 --> 00:31:21.842
At any rate,
they are the story that

00:31:21.842 --> 00:31:27.038
Augustine tells in Book I of the
City of God is that of

00:31:27.038 --> 00:31:29.170
the rape of Lucretia.
 

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:33.528
The rape of Lucretia and
Augustine is fierce about the

00:31:33.528 --> 00:31:36.160
fact that she commits suicide.
 

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.200
How does she die?
 

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:45.131
She commits suicide out of the
guilt and shame that she had

00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:50.150
been violated in rape by the--by
Brutus.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.875
And he says,
how does she dare to take her

00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:58.805
own life,
because here is the chaste

00:31:58.805 --> 00:32:04.190
Lucretia who is embarrassed of
the unchaste Lucretia,

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:08.019
this is a sin of false
transcendence;

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:12.442
the belief that I can be not
completely--I do not coincide

00:32:12.442 --> 00:32:15.855
fully with who I am,
so that I have to double

00:32:15.855 --> 00:32:16.710
myself.
 

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:20.440
I have to see myself as
different from what I am.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.759
I can do justice against myself.
 

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:26.518
By doing this for Dante,
and I'll go into Dante's text,

00:32:26.518 --> 00:32:30.067
this doubling of Pier delle
Vigne, is a sin of false

00:32:30.067 --> 00:32:31.318
transcendence.
 

00:32:31.318 --> 00:32:36.634
The way a suicide is playing
God to oneself and this

00:32:36.634 --> 00:32:41.740
punishing oneself for wrongs
that he, the suicide,

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.200
perceives.
 

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.314
Lucretia, she that perceived,
as her--as fouling her reality.

00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:50.190
You see what I mean?
 

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:55.537
This is the kind of a--a kind
of doubleness that seems to be

00:32:55.537 --> 00:33:00.702
running through and Dante's
rendering through this idea of

00:33:00.702 --> 00:33:01.608
style.
 

00:33:01.608 --> 00:33:03.900
"By the new roots of this
tree I swear to you,

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.510
never did I break faith with my
lord, who was so worthy of

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.163
honor;
and if either of you return to

00:33:09.163 --> 00:33:13.625
the world, let him establish my
memory, which still lies under

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:16.259
the blow that envy gave
it."

00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:21.348
The story of Pier delle Vigne
exemplifies the story of--

00:33:21.348 --> 00:33:27.618
or dramatizes the story of the
tragic experience of suicide,

00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:34.105
and Dante here gives of suicide
an exactly theological and

00:33:34.105 --> 00:33:36.608
Augustinian account.
 

00:33:36.608 --> 00:33:39.904
He views it,
looks at it from an Augustinian

00:33:39.904 --> 00:33:41.130
point of view.
 

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:47.618
We skip Canto XIV and we go now
to another memorable canto,

00:33:47.618 --> 00:33:55.246
a memorable Canto XV:
a memorable encounter with

00:33:55.246 --> 00:34:00.272
Dante's teacher,
Brunetto Latini,

00:34:00.272 --> 00:34:05.009
who was probably 50 years his
senior,

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:11.235
who was a translator who
adapted in the vernacular

00:34:11.235 --> 00:34:17.052
Cicero's rhetorical works,
also who was a teacher of the

00:34:17.052 --> 00:34:18.010
Florentines.
 

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:23.637
So he was a teacher of Dante,
and who really stands for the

00:34:23.637 --> 00:34:29.070
great values of the rhetorical
humanistic, or Ciceronian,

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.429
tradition.
 

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:35.077
The idea of--he opposed the
idea of the republic of

00:34:35.077 --> 00:34:36.099
Florence.
 

00:34:36.099 --> 00:34:39.409
He's a Guelf because he does
not want--

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.561
you do know that the
Ghibellines are those who are in

00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:45.349
favor of the imperial control of
the state,

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:49.621
and for him to be a Guelf is
really to claim that he's on the

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:52.641
side of the republic,
that he wants the Florentine

00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:53.110
republic.
 

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:57.451
He was sent to an embassy--he
went to Toledo by the way,

00:34:57.451 --> 00:35:01.949
which at the time was the
center of great translations.

00:35:01.949 --> 00:35:05.230
And he may have brought from
Toledo translations of--

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.199
that Dante knew,
such as, perhaps,

00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:15.576
the account of the Mohammad's
vision and the ascent to

00:35:15.576 --> 00:35:17.139
Paradise.
 

00:35:17.139 --> 00:35:22.329
That's really a very doubtful
question, but it circulates

00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:27.518
increasingly within Dante
studies, the perimeter of Dante

00:35:27.518 --> 00:35:28.630
studies.
 

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:34.277
Brunetto, while he was going on
an embassy to France,

00:35:34.277 --> 00:35:37.210
was banned from Florence.
 

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.489
He eventually returned to
Florence;

00:35:39.489 --> 00:35:44.860
but he's a figure that Dante
really tries to pattern himself

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.590
after.
 

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:49.208
Effectively,
it's the teaching of Brunetto

00:35:49.208 --> 00:35:53.978
is what guides him,
at least in the initial phase

00:35:53.978 --> 00:35:58.202
of his political concerns--
that other experiences,

00:35:58.202 --> 00:36:02.032
intellectual experiences that
will intervene and will change

00:36:02.032 --> 00:36:03.980
radically Dante's thinking.
 

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.661
What I'm trying to do in this
class is also to give you a

00:36:07.661 --> 00:36:10.621
sense of the shifts in his
perceptions and his

00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:12.659
understanding of the world.
 

00:36:12.659 --> 00:36:16.639
I will be telling you at some
point that there were

00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:21.494
extraordinary encounters that he
had with some theologians and

00:36:21.494 --> 00:36:24.599
some philosophers within
Florence,

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:28.702
that gave him a completely
different view from the one that

00:36:28.702 --> 00:36:31.179
Brunetto Latini instilled in
him.

00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:33.460
Let's see what happens between
the two of them.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.889
We are in the area once again
of violence.

00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:38.985
This time violence against
nature, and there is

00:36:38.985 --> 00:36:42.688
an--Brunetto Latini is damned,
is condemned for a sin of

00:36:42.688 --> 00:36:43.429
sodomy.
 

00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:46.922
There is no evidence at all
from any other sources that that

00:36:46.922 --> 00:36:47.929
is what he was.
 

00:36:47.929 --> 00:36:52.293
And I have to tell you that
Dante also has a different

00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:56.739
understanding of sodomy,
when he comes to Purgatory;

00:36:56.739 --> 00:36:59.159
for instance,
in Canto XXVI,

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:03.730
where the sodomites are in the
process of redeeming,

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:08.570
of seeking some kind of
redemption, and cleansing.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.400
Anyway, this is the canto here.
 

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.750
Let's see how he proceeds.
 

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:16.480
"Now one of the hard
margins bears us on and the

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.757
vapor from the stream makes a
shade above that shelters the

00:37:21.757 --> 00:37:25.760
water and the banks from the
fire."

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.159
The focus of the canto is once
again the natural world.

00:37:31.159 --> 00:37:36.594
A natural world which is one of
sheer chaos and the natural

00:37:36.594 --> 00:37:41.375
world which is one of violence,
and look at this image:

00:37:41.375 --> 00:37:45.121
"as the Flemings between
Wissant and Bruges,"

00:37:45.121 --> 00:37:47.896
the Netherlands,
he's describing literally the

00:37:47.896 --> 00:37:48.518
Netherlands.
 

00:37:48.518 --> 00:37:51.510
Called such because they are
lower,

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.630
the surface of the land is
lower than that of the water,

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:59.896
and have to protect the land
from the violence of the water

00:37:59.896 --> 00:38:01.440
and the floods.
 

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.230
So, they build these dykes
around.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.349
"As the flames between
Wissant and Bruges,

00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:09.961
fearing the flood rushing in on
them make their bulwark to drive

00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:12.882
back the sea,
and as the Paduans do along the

00:38:12.882 --> 00:38:16.177
Brenta to protect their towns
and castles before the

00:38:16.177 --> 00:38:19.887
Chiarentana feels the heat,
these were made of the same

00:38:19.887 --> 00:38:21.755
fashion,
except that the builder,

00:38:21.755 --> 00:38:24.891
whoever he was,
made them neither so high nor

00:38:24.891 --> 00:38:26.139
so broad."
 

00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:30.369
So the natural world can hardly
be contained.

00:38:30.369 --> 00:38:33.440
That's the idea,
the natural world that is

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.157
always is going to overwhelm all
efforts to--all barriers trying

00:38:38.157 --> 00:38:40.179
to impede its violence.
 

00:38:40.179 --> 00:38:42.960
By the way, this is an image,
for those of you who are

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.690
readers of literature even
beyond the Middle Ages;

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:53.195
it's a famous image that
Machiavelli will use in Chapter

00:38:53.195 --> 00:38:56.880
XXV of The Prince.
 

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.809
Remember when he talks about
virtue and fortune,

00:39:00.809 --> 00:39:02.460
and that the virtue of human
beings,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.309
virtue--the word character,
arete,

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:10.376
the virtue of human beings is
to build shelters which are

00:39:10.376 --> 00:39:12.552
too--
whenever we expect a flood,

00:39:12.552 --> 00:39:15.865
but in the full knowledge that
we are never really going to

00:39:15.865 --> 00:39:19.237
succeed and yet we need these
shelters just in case we might

00:39:19.237 --> 00:39:19.980
succeed.
 

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:24.699
Virtue is always as little bit
less powerful than fortune in

00:39:24.699 --> 00:39:26.380
his--in that world.
 

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.231
It's an image that--in one of
the history plays,

00:39:30.231 --> 00:39:32.610
Shakespeare also uses them.
 

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.570
I'm not saying that he takes it
from Dante.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.260
We don't know whether he
actually read Dante or not.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.474
"Already,"
so this is the background of

00:39:40.474 --> 00:39:43.192
this encounter,
"already we had gotten so

00:39:43.192 --> 00:39:46.318
far from the wood that I should
not have seen where it was if I

00:39:46.318 --> 00:39:49.101
had turned backward,
when we met a troop of souls

00:39:49.101 --> 00:39:51.179
who were coming alongside the
bank,

00:39:51.179 --> 00:39:55.715
and each looked at us as men
look at one another under a new

00:39:55.715 --> 00:39:57.329
moon at dusk."
 

00:39:57.329 --> 00:40:05.440
It seems to create this kind of
strange world of--the night

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.559
world.
 

00:40:06.559 --> 00:40:09.753
"And they puckered their
brows on us like an old tailor

00:40:09.753 --> 00:40:11.539
on the eye of his needle."
 

00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:14.679
What an extraordinary image.
 

00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:19.063
Dante will use something like
this, not quite the same image,

00:40:19.063 --> 00:40:22.864
the tailor when he's
arriving--when he is to describe

00:40:22.864 --> 00:40:25.130
his own vision of Paradise.
 

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:30.989
It is as if the most--the
humblest experience in the city,

00:40:30.989 --> 00:40:34.432
in Florence,
of all the artists and the

00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:38.253
tailor can only help him--
the only thing he can think

00:40:38.253 --> 00:40:40.960
about as he's approaching the
most sublime of experiences,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.530
that's Paradiso XXXIII.
 

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:47.974
And here this most
extraordinary story has also the

00:40:47.974 --> 00:40:50.369
ring of familiarity.
 

00:40:50.369 --> 00:40:53.675
That is really the image--of
the way I think this image

00:40:53.675 --> 00:40:56.860
works, the sense of a
familiarity and with a familiar

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.221
image of the tailor;
and the tailor also a figure

00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:01.909
that takes your measure.
 

00:41:01.909 --> 00:41:07.016
The tailor is a figure of the
artisan who in order to fit you

00:41:07.016 --> 00:41:11.699
properly has to have your
measures, your idea of who you

00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:12.380
are.
 

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:16.152
"Eyed thus by that
company, I was recognized by one

00:41:16.152 --> 00:41:19.719
who took me by the hem and
cried: 'How marvelous!'

00:41:19.719 --> 00:41:23.518
And I, when he reached out his
arm to me,

00:41:23.518 --> 00:41:27.014
fixed my eye on his baked looks
so that the scorched features

00:41:27.014 --> 00:41:29.869
did not keep my mind from
recognizing him and,

00:41:29.869 --> 00:41:34.123
bending my face to his,
I answered: 'Are you here,

00:41:34.123 --> 00:41:38.599
Ser Brunetto?'"
Are you here, Ser Brunetto?

00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:42.679
So he--this is the scene of the
recognition.

00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:47.945
In Inferno that's what
you have, scenes of recognition,

00:41:47.945 --> 00:41:50.449
more than first encounters.
 

00:41:50.449 --> 00:41:53.416
It is as if,
literally, recognizing means

00:41:53.416 --> 00:41:56.679
knowing people that you thought
you knew,

00:41:56.679 --> 00:42:01.251
and you knowing them and you,
all the figures that you

00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:05.657
thought you had--
knew something about,

00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:07.369
recognition.
 

00:42:07.369 --> 00:42:10.614
It means also giving a kind of
understanding,

00:42:10.614 --> 00:42:15.260
giving a kind of view to them,
recognizing in that sense too.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.487
"And he:
'O my son, let it not displease

00:42:18.487 --> 00:42:22.815
thee if Brunetto Latini turn
back with thee a little and let

00:42:22.815 --> 00:42:26.556
the train go on.'"
Twice Brunetto will refer to

00:42:26.556 --> 00:42:29.268
Dante as "Oh my son."
 

00:42:29.268 --> 00:42:32.161
It's sort of acknowledged in
this affiliation,

00:42:32.161 --> 00:42:35.440
acknowledging a kind of
familiarity that goes beyond

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.690
even--any form of discipleship.
 

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:41.128
Dante will resist that
solicitation,

00:42:41.128 --> 00:42:46.139
that affectionate solicitation,
that familiarity.

00:42:46.139 --> 00:42:49.333
He will always refer to him as
the image of a father,

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:50.070
but twice.
 

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.027
And then he says,
"I said to him:

00:42:52.027 --> 00:42:54.039
'With all my heart I beg it of
you,

00:42:54.039 --> 00:42:56.079
and if you wish me to sit with
you I will,

00:42:56.079 --> 00:43:00.170
if it please him here with whom
I go,'" meaning Virgil and

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.778
unmentioned,
as if Dante now were

00:43:02.778 --> 00:43:06.179
concealing, pro forma to
be sure,

00:43:06.179 --> 00:43:10.500
the shifted loyalty from one
teacher to another,

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.940
and were concealing it from
Brunetto Latini.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.556
Once again Brunetto:
"O son whoever of this

00:43:15.556 --> 00:43:16.949
flock stops,"
etc.

00:43:16.949 --> 00:43:19.686
"Go on,
therefore; I shall come at thy

00:43:19.686 --> 00:43:23.728
skirt," which some critics
have seen as the sign that this

00:43:23.728 --> 00:43:25.894
is--
that really Dante may have

00:43:25.894 --> 00:43:29.820
known something about Brunetto
Latini that nobody else knew,

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:34.007
"and later rejoin my band
who go mourning their eternal

00:43:34.007 --> 00:43:34.929
loss."
 

00:43:34.929 --> 00:43:39.559
Look at the spatial
configuration of the scene.

00:43:39.559 --> 00:43:41.550
I think it's very significant.
 

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:45.429
The disciple is above,
the teacher is below;

00:43:45.429 --> 00:43:50.309
so that the disciple has to bow
in order to be able to speak to

00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:52.873
the teacher,
which would be a sign of his

00:43:52.873 --> 00:43:55.050
reverence for the authority of
the master,

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:58.418
but at the same time,
it indicates that the hierarchy

00:43:58.418 --> 00:43:59.909
between them is both.
 

00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:03.525
The hierarchy between them
really has completely altered

00:44:03.525 --> 00:44:07.271
from the days that there they
were on--in the city--in the

00:44:07.271 --> 00:44:08.849
streets of Florence.
 

00:44:08.849 --> 00:44:11.804
And then he tells the story:
"'Up above there in the

00:44:11.804 --> 00:44:14.018
bright life,' I answered
him," no,

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:17.259
I'm sorry, "I durst not
descend from the track,"

00:44:17.259 --> 00:44:17.599
etc.
 

00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:19.440
And he says,
"what chance or

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.280
destiny,"
Brunetto says,

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.827
"brings thee down here
before thy last day and who is

00:44:24.827 --> 00:44:26.820
this that shows the way?"
 

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:27.699
Chance?
 

00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:29.420
Destiny?
 

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:36.186
Brunetto has no understanding
of the trajectory of Dante's

00:44:36.186 --> 00:44:38.679
life and adventure.
 

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:43.460
This is really the beginning of
a series of misunderstandings

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.570
between the teacher and the
disciple.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:51.329
Two different value systems are
being deployed and they are

00:44:51.329 --> 00:44:54.860
going to be in collision with
each other.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.280
Brunetto speaks like a true
humanist,

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.849
a man who belongs to the
Ciceronian and espouses the

00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:03.994
Ciceronian ethics,
for whom here the world is one

00:45:03.994 --> 00:45:08.371
indeed of chance encounters,
destiny that takes us one way

00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:11.902
or the other,
and there is nothing indeed

00:45:11.902 --> 00:45:13.719
providential about it.
 

00:45:13.719 --> 00:45:19.597
Dante responds by really giving
a kind of pithy summary of his

00:45:19.597 --> 00:45:22.969
experience in the last few
hours.

00:45:22.969 --> 00:45:27.041
"'Up above there,
in the bright life' I answered

00:45:27.041 --> 00:45:28.784
him,
'before my age was at the

00:45:28.784 --> 00:45:30.789
full," he repeats
Inferno I,

00:45:30.789 --> 00:45:33.121
"I lost my way in a
valley..

00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:36.402
.He appeared to me when I was
returning to it,

00:45:36.402 --> 00:45:39.610
and by this road he leads me
home."

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:44.161
These are extraordinary words
because what home means for the

00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:47.411
politically-minded,
Florence-centered,

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:52.132
sense of existence of Brunetto,
is not the idea of what home

00:45:52.132 --> 00:45:53.239
means for Dante.
 

00:45:53.239 --> 00:45:57.722
For Dante, home is the place of
the soul, and the place where

00:45:57.722 --> 00:46:01.833
the soul is at its most
distended, the distension of the

00:46:01.833 --> 00:46:03.030
soul occurs.
 

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.742
For Brunetto,
home can only be city of

00:46:05.742 --> 00:46:06.550
Florence.
 

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:09.751
One has a political frame of
reference, the other one has a

00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:13.121
theological frame of reference,
and the two are colliding with

00:46:13.121 --> 00:46:13.949
each other.
 

00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:16.320
Let's continue and see how this
is extraordinary.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.206
"And he said to me:
'If thou follow thy star,"

00:46:19.206 --> 00:46:21.409
now again an extension of the
language,

00:46:21.409 --> 00:46:23.148
the metaphor,
picks up the metaphor of

00:46:23.148 --> 00:46:25.619
chance,
or destiny, a kind of astrology.

00:46:25.619 --> 00:46:27.760
Follow your star,
the astrology of the

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.114
destiny--in the destiny of
Dante, "thou canst not fail

00:46:31.114 --> 00:46:32.849
the glorious heaven."
 

00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:37.759
In other--Dante is dramatizing
the radical ambiguity of words

00:46:37.759 --> 00:46:42.751
that seem to be so bland like
glorious: what glorious means to

00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:47.824
a humanist is not what glorious
means to a theologically-minded

00:46:47.824 --> 00:46:48.969
thinker.
 

00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:52.065
In theology,
one thinks of nature,

00:46:52.065 --> 00:46:53.849
grace, and glory.
 

00:46:53.849 --> 00:46:55.940
And Dante begins
Paradise I,

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.518
the first word with which it
begins is the glory of him,

00:46:59.518 --> 00:47:02.590
la gloria,
of him who moves all things,

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:05.500
and glory for Brunetto means
the happy ending,

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.639
fame, and whatever.
 

00:47:07.639 --> 00:47:10.237
"The glorious haven,
if I discerned rightly in the

00:47:10.237 --> 00:47:12.509
fair life,
and had I not died too soon,

00:47:12.509 --> 00:47:15.500
seeing heaven so gracious to
thee," again,

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.659
this is 'glorious' and 'grace'
once again,

00:47:19.659 --> 00:47:21.237
"to thee,
I would have strengthened thee

00:47:21.237 --> 00:47:21.739
in thy work.
 

00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:26.184
But the thankless and malignant
folk which came down of old from

00:47:26.184 --> 00:47:28.391
Fiesole,
and still keeps something of

00:47:28.391 --> 00:47:30.489
the mountain and the rock shall
become,

00:47:30.489 --> 00:47:33.289
for thy well-doing thine
enemy--and with reason,

00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:36.483
for among the bitter sorbs,
it is not natural the sweet fig

00:47:36.483 --> 00:47:37.750
should come to fruit.
 

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.170
Old fame..."
 

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:45.041
So, from Brunetto's point of
view, the reference of all the

00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:50.911
crisis, the spiritual crisis,
the loss of self of Dante can

00:47:50.911 --> 00:47:53.139
only be political.
 

00:47:53.139 --> 00:47:57.023
That Brunetto makes an
incredible mistake of believing

00:47:57.023 --> 00:48:01.420
that Dante's experience is
exactly the replica of his own.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.139
He lost the city,
where he was by the way,

00:48:05.139 --> 00:48:08.780
at Roncesvalles,
the place where the great

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:14.121
paladin of Charlemagne,
or Roland, was--it's a symbolic

00:48:14.121 --> 00:48:18.230
place he chooses--
was defeated and now this is

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:22.409
exactly what he thinks is
happening also to Dante,

00:48:22.409 --> 00:48:23.699
to the pilgrim.
 

00:48:23.699 --> 00:48:26.449
"Among the bitter sorbs,
etc...

00:48:26.449 --> 00:48:29.222
Old fame in the world calls
them blind, a people avaricious,

00:48:29.222 --> 00:48:30.539
envious and proud..."
 

00:48:30.539 --> 00:48:36.297
This is the three sparks that
have set the hearts of the

00:48:36.297 --> 00:48:41.949
Florentines on fire and this:
pride, envy-- avaricious,

00:48:41.949 --> 00:48:43.940
envy and pride.
 

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.637
"Thy fortune holds for
thee such honor that the one

00:48:46.637 --> 00:48:49.630
party and the other shall be
ravenous against thee..."

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:53.824
So then, the language--the
prophecy of Dante's exile:

00:48:53.824 --> 00:48:57.291
the two parties,
Guelfs and Ghibellines will

00:48:57.291 --> 00:48:59.389
turn against him,
etc.

00:48:59.389 --> 00:49:03.873
And Dante answers:
"'Were all my prayers

00:49:03.873 --> 00:49:05.199
fulfilled!'
 

00:49:05.199 --> 00:49:08.822
I answered him,
'you had not yet been banished

00:49:08.822 --> 00:49:11.748
from humanity;
for in my memory is fixed,

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:15.893
and now goes to my heart,
the dear and kind paternal

00:49:15.893 --> 00:49:21.815
image of you when many a time in
the world you taught me how man

00:49:21.815 --> 00:49:26.335
makes himself immortal;
and how much I am grateful for

00:49:26.335 --> 00:49:28.135
it my tongue,
while I live,

00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:29.659
must needs declare.
 

00:49:29.659 --> 00:49:33.431
That which you tell of my
course, I write and keep with

00:49:33.431 --> 00:49:36.784
another text for comment by a
lady who will know,

00:49:36.784 --> 00:49:38.670
if I reach her..."
 

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.572
Clearly an illusion to
Beatrice, though it will not be

00:49:41.572 --> 00:49:44.639
Beatrice who will make the
prophecy of Dante's exile,

00:49:44.639 --> 00:49:48.460
but in the symmetrically
connected cantos XV and XVI of

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.280
Paradise it will be
Dante's real grandfather.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.327
So the distinction between this
fictional figure of a

00:49:56.327 --> 00:50:00.376
self-claimed spiritual father
Brunetto and the heroic

00:50:00.376 --> 00:50:03.385
grandfather,
Cacciaguida,

00:50:03.385 --> 00:50:07.599
the antithesis is very clear.
 

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:15.400
In the acknowledgement that
Dante gives of Brunetto's

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:21.135
teaching when he says,
"for in my memory is fixed

00:50:21.135 --> 00:50:24.914
and now goes to my heart the
dear and kind paternal image of

00:50:24.914 --> 00:50:28.918
you were many time in the world,
you taught me how men makes

00:50:28.918 --> 00:50:30.429
himself immortal."
 

00:50:30.429 --> 00:50:33.914
There is also a little bit of a
critique, a little bit of a

00:50:33.914 --> 00:50:37.699
distance that Dante establishes
between himself and Brunetto.

00:50:37.699 --> 00:50:41.722
For the true poet,
the real authentic poet,

00:50:41.722 --> 00:50:46.893
of Dante's experience is that
man does not make himself

00:50:46.893 --> 00:50:48.139
immortal.
 

00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:52.461
Of course, when a bold stroke
works, maybe there are many

00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:56.630
other forms of achieving some
degree of immortality.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.920
One can make children to become
immortal,

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.869
one--at least in provisional
immortality,

00:51:01.869 --> 00:51:05.360
a continuity,
but from Dante's point of view,

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.679
the immortality that he is
seeking is not manmade.

00:51:09.679 --> 00:51:13.699
It can only be a question of
the salvation of his soul.

00:51:13.699 --> 00:51:17.302
In the very great
acknowledgement the form in

00:51:17.302 --> 00:51:21.887
which is a disciple who just
loved making these claims of

00:51:21.887 --> 00:51:25.974
indebtedness to the teacher,
there is also a sense of a

00:51:25.974 --> 00:51:28.530
difference between them and
misunderstandings,

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:35.679
and this will be in fact the
trait of this encounter.

00:51:35.679 --> 00:51:38.436
To a teacher,
who has been shaping the

00:51:38.436 --> 00:51:42.909
disciple and the disciple who
has been going his own way,

00:51:42.909 --> 00:51:46.940
who somehow thinks that
education means also--

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:52.030
is tantamount to the experience
of freedom.

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:57.150
It's what we--this is the way
we began when I spoke about the

00:51:57.150 --> 00:52:00.309
figures of doubleness in Canto
XII.

00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:04.166
And this is the theme that
seems to be going through even

00:52:04.166 --> 00:52:06.440
in the encounter with Brunetto.
 

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.400
Let's see now exactly then what
is Brunetto's sodomy or a way of

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.539
understanding Brunetto's sodomy.
 

00:52:12.539 --> 00:52:16.018
Clearly linked to violence,
we're in the world of violence,

00:52:16.018 --> 00:52:20.706
and so Dante wants to know
about who the other sinners are

00:52:20.706 --> 00:52:25.476
and Brunetto will comply and
says that all clerks and great

00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:27.449
and famous scholars.
 

00:52:27.449 --> 00:52:29.367
And he mentions them all,
"who defiled the world by

00:52:29.367 --> 00:52:30.380
one and the same sin."
 

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:34.500
Priscian, a famous grammarian,
Francesco d'Accorso,

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:38.809
who also is--by the way,
I think he's a lawyer--

00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:41.545
and "if thou has a craving
for such scurf..."

00:52:41.545 --> 00:52:41.849
etc.
 

00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:44.677
Now then, he says,
"I would say more,

00:52:44.677 --> 00:52:49.021
but I can go no further talking
with thee, for I see there a new

00:52:49.021 --> 00:52:53.306
cloud rising from the sand;
people are coming with whom I

00:52:53.306 --> 00:52:54.268
must not be.
 

00:52:54.268 --> 00:52:58.686
Let my Treasure,
in which I yet live,

00:52:58.686 --> 00:53:03.260
be commended to thee;
and I ask no more."

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.490
A true teacher,
I say, who gives the

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:07.150
bibliography at the end.
 

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:09.449
He says, okay now you go and
read my book,

00:53:09.449 --> 00:53:12.505
not just read anybody's book,
but I recommend to you my

00:53:12.505 --> 00:53:15.692
Treasure,
"in which I yet live,

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.480
be commended to thee.
 

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.967
Then he turned about and seemed
like one of those who ran for

00:53:21.967 --> 00:53:25.257
the green cloth in the field at
Verona,"

00:53:25.257 --> 00:53:28.704
a ludic image,
an image of a race which is run

00:53:28.704 --> 00:53:31.021
in Verona,
"and he seemed not the

00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:33.289
loser among them,
but the winner."

00:53:33.289 --> 00:53:37.827
So he leaves with the illusion
that he is a precursor,

00:53:37.827 --> 00:53:38.940
as it were.
 

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.739
Do you understand what I mean?
 

00:53:40.739 --> 00:53:43.956
That he is in a race,
he's so far behind everybody

00:53:43.956 --> 00:53:46.909
else, that he's seems not be
ahead of them.

00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:48.909
He's really behind one circle.
 

00:53:48.909 --> 00:53:54.090
That's the image with which
Dante ends this encounter.

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:57.268
Brunetto recommends this
Treasure which is a

00:53:57.268 --> 00:53:59.050
French text that he wrote.
 

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:03.757
It's an encyclopedia that he
wrote--while in France and he

00:54:03.757 --> 00:54:08.545
wrote it in French so much
that--and it's so important this

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:09.289
text.
 

00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:13.030
It's one of the most important
encyclopedias in the vernacular.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.409
Encyclopedias being--I may
have--I even gave you--

00:54:16.409 --> 00:54:19.708
I remember you--I don't expect
you to remember it but I gave a

00:54:19.708 --> 00:54:22.360
definition of the Divine
Comedy as a poetic

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.659
encyclopedia in the sense that
it tries to gather together the

00:54:25.659 --> 00:54:29.947
broken pieces of knowledge,
of experience and at the same

00:54:29.947 --> 00:54:31.925
time,
unlike the technical

00:54:31.925 --> 00:54:35.250
encyclopedias such as the
Britannica give you--

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:39.014
dramatize the presence of
someone who is being educated

00:54:39.014 --> 00:54:42.389
through them,
a process of education.

00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:44.989
Dante is the one who is in the
middle of learning,

00:54:44.989 --> 00:54:49.469
so this is an encyclopedia with
a path about how to learn,

00:54:49.469 --> 00:54:52.780
not the abstract one that
Brunetto had written.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.226
It's written in French and
its--and I stress this fact

00:54:57.226 --> 00:55:00.641
because elsewhere,
in one of his philosophical

00:55:00.641 --> 00:55:03.074
reflections,
Dante goes on saying that we

00:55:03.074 --> 00:55:06.340
are all bound by natural
affection for our own language,

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:10.695
and because on account of that,
there are those who have put

00:55:10.695 --> 00:55:15.052
forth the interpretation that
Brunetto is here for violating

00:55:15.052 --> 00:55:18.670
the natural bonds of affection
that we have,

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:22.380
that human beings have,
to their own natural language,

00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:26.818
to their own mother language
let's call it that.

00:55:26.818 --> 00:55:28.139
It could be.
 

00:55:28.139 --> 00:55:32.853
What I think this is,
is it dramatizes an incredible

00:55:32.853 --> 00:55:36.550
self-delusion on the part of
Brunetto.

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.159
Here he is, dead.
 

00:55:39.159 --> 00:55:43.822
Here he is, circling around
under the reign of fire,

00:55:43.822 --> 00:55:48.119
and he thinks he still lives in
his own text.

00:55:48.119 --> 00:55:50.271
He mistakes,
first of all,

00:55:50.271 --> 00:55:55.349
the symbolic life that he has
within a text with reality.

00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:56.969
That's really--that's the first
confusion.

00:55:56.969 --> 00:56:00.724
The language of images,
the language of seeming that

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:04.922
pervades this canto has to be
understood in these terms of

00:56:04.922 --> 00:56:09.266
this confusion of the part of
Brunetto, but there is more to

00:56:09.266 --> 00:56:09.929
it.
 

00:56:09.929 --> 00:56:14.246
The mistake that Brunetto
makes, is to believe that

00:56:14.246 --> 00:56:17.960
Dante's own life is a replica of
his own.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.751
Read my text because whatever
it is that you have to know,

00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:24.880
it's already available to you
in my own book.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.835
That is to say,
he faces the difference between

00:56:29.835 --> 00:56:33.500
Dante and himself,
and Brunetto.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.976
He refuses to see that Dante's
own life can have its own

00:56:37.976 --> 00:56:42.454
development and its own
destination, a destination which

00:56:42.454 --> 00:56:45.059
he cannot understand at all.
 

00:56:45.059 --> 00:56:51.688
That's the end of Canto XV;
this sodomy then is also a

00:56:51.688 --> 00:56:55.699
confusion between the real and
the imaginary,

00:56:55.699 --> 00:56:59.940
the way of drawing the real
world into one of fictional

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.139
fictions and imaginations.
 

00:57:02.139 --> 00:57:06.289
There is one scene before I
stop and give you a chance to

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:07.550
ask a question.
 

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:09.309
Now we'll go into Canto XVI.
 

00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:10.539
It's the end really.
 

00:57:10.539 --> 00:57:13.559
We are reaching the end of the
intermediate area,

00:57:13.559 --> 00:57:17.909
the moral, the ground of
violence which to us,

00:57:17.909 --> 00:57:22.480
of course, I just presume that
you may be surprised at this.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:28.552
So we are--our culture seems to
view violence really as the

00:57:28.552 --> 00:57:34.414
worst possible crime and
violence in all of its forms and

00:57:34.414 --> 00:57:36.510
its expressions.
 

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:39.579
And there are several:
psychological,

00:57:39.579 --> 00:57:42.309
physical, political and so on.
 

00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:45.853
For Dante the real--the worst
crimes are the crimes of fraud,

00:57:45.853 --> 00:57:46.679
as you know.
 

00:57:46.679 --> 00:57:51.603
These are bad enough,
to be sure, but the--and

00:57:51.603 --> 00:57:58.275
Dante's about to enter in Canto
XVII and he will see a strange

00:57:58.275 --> 00:57:59.480
figure.
 

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:05.440
They are--they have to go over
a huge ravine,

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.440
there's no way that they can do
this,

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:12.920
but then miraculously a figure,
a strange figure,

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:19.360
a monster stands at the edge of
the pit and a figure appears.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.730
This is the figure of Geryon,
at the end of Canto XVI.

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:27.300
Let me read this image,
the figure of Geryon.

00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:38.130
Dante will mount on Geryon and
Virgil will sit behind him;

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:42.090
and the descent takes place
into the area of fraud.

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:47.195
So this is the--these are
the--this is the sequence of

00:58:47.195 --> 00:58:49.699
happenings in the canto.
 

00:58:49.699 --> 00:58:53.250
And now let's see what Dante
says.

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:58.592
It's an experience of--we could
even call it wonder,

00:58:58.592 --> 00:58:59.639
in Hell.
 

00:58:59.639 --> 00:59:03.909
This experience from the
sublime, an infernal sublime.

00:59:03.909 --> 00:59:06.581
"A man,"
I'm reading from XVI,

00:59:06.581 --> 00:59:09.460
line 130, around line 130 and
following.

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:14.175
"A man should always close
his lips, as far as he can to

00:59:14.175 --> 00:59:17.869
the truth that has the face of
the lie."

00:59:17.869 --> 00:59:19.159
That's fraud.
 

00:59:19.159 --> 00:59:23.657
A mixture of truth and
deception, truth and lies,

00:59:23.657 --> 00:59:27.500
now that's what literature
seems to do.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:32.023
"Since without fault it
brings him shame,

00:59:32.023 --> 00:59:37.887
but here I cannot be silent;
and by the strains of this

00:59:37.887 --> 00:59:42.489
Comedy,"
this text, called 'comedy.'

00:59:42.489 --> 00:59:45.309
It is the story,
a moment of an experience of

00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.949
descent.
 

00:59:45.949 --> 00:59:50.351
'Comedy' also captures this
rhetoric of descent,

00:59:50.351 --> 00:59:55.409
of lowering oneself,
not just an ascetic experience.

00:59:55.409 --> 00:59:58.306
"I swear to thee,
reader,"

00:59:58.306 --> 01:00:01.949
another, the second address to
the reader.

01:00:01.949 --> 01:00:05.416
And you may remember that we
saw one in Canto IX and I tried

01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:08.884
to explain it to you as the
address to the reader as part of

01:00:08.884 --> 01:00:11.940
the strategy of authority on the
part of Dante,

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.380
in the measure in which I need
readers and I may have readers,

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:20.233
then I'm constituted into an
author and understand that kind

01:00:20.233 --> 01:00:21.880
of strategic move.
 

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.681
"I swear to thee, reader,
that I saw come swimming up

01:00:25.681 --> 01:00:28.460
through that gross and murky
air,

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.670
a figure amazing to the
stoutest heart,

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:36.197
even as he returns and goes to
down sometime to loose the

01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:40.103
anchor that is caught in a reef
or something else hidden in the

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:42.887
sea,
stretching upward and drawing

01:00:42.887 --> 01:00:44.340
in his feet."
 

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.760
This is the story;
this is the approach of Geryon.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.800
What I want to point out is a
number of metaphors here.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:56.143
This is an aerial journey;
Geryon is flapping his wings

01:00:56.143 --> 01:00:59.070
and going through the murky air.
 

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:04.030
Dante describes it as if it
were a journey by sea.

01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:06.199
The metaphor he uses is
swimming.

01:01:06.199 --> 01:01:10.494
"I saw come swimming up
through the gross and murky

01:01:10.494 --> 01:01:14.681
air," and by the way,
when Dante is to describe the

01:01:14.681 --> 01:01:17.454
story of a mythic sailor,
mythic mariner,

01:01:17.454 --> 01:01:20.210
Ulysses, whom we are going to
encounter,

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.059
hopefully next week,
I think it's going to be next

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:28.170
week or next time,
he describes this journey by

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:32.300
sea of Ulysses as if it were a
journey by air.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:37.460
And he does this because for
Dante it doesn't matter how you

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.860
are traveling.
 

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:43.023
If you fly or you go by water,
it doesn't matter,

01:01:43.023 --> 01:01:46.840
because all journeys are
journeys to the same

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.230
destination.
 

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:51.480
All journeys are really
journeys to the absolute.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.449
Here, Geryon seems only to come
to play a ministerial function,

01:01:56.449 --> 01:02:00.610
he's going to minister,
to serve, Dante and his guide,

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:04.032
and at the same time Dante
says, here too there is some

01:02:04.032 --> 01:02:05.641
plan,
here too there's some kind

01:02:05.641 --> 01:02:07.760
of--something of the absolute
that I have to see.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.909
That's the first image.
 

01:02:08.909 --> 01:02:15.626
The second image is this idea
of--which will be described a

01:02:15.626 --> 01:02:19.380
little later,
there will be rotatory movement

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.429
of Geryon through the air and I
have been describing the circle,

01:02:23.429 --> 01:02:25.940
the spiral, the movement in a
spiral,

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:33.500
the spiral motion of all
movement in Inferno.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:39.639
The third is this idea of
swearing by Dante's own text.

01:02:39.639 --> 01:02:45.360
The text is given now the value
of a sacred object.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.340
Something that has something
one can swear by.

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:54.750
If we began with a violation of
the Aeneid in Canto XIII,

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:58.554
now in Canto XVI,
Dante opposes to the

01:02:58.554 --> 01:03:03.813
Aeneid and it replaces,
therefore the new text for us

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:05.139
is this comedy.
 

01:03:05.139 --> 01:03:09.646
Let me stop here and let me see
that we have a few minutes for

01:03:09.646 --> 01:03:14.226
questions which I will welcome
and try to answer for about five

01:03:14.226 --> 01:03:15.630
or ten minutes.
 

01:03:18.199 --> 01:03:21.730
Student:  Yeah I have a
quick thing I want to clear up,

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:26.378
Canto XIII, at the end,
when Pier delle Vigne is

01:03:26.378 --> 01:03:30.349
talking about Augustus,
he's referring to Frederick

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:31.440
instead of Augustus?
 

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:39.536
Prof: Yes the--it's what
we call a typological use of the

01:03:39.536 --> 01:03:45.320
emperor has to be--it's Augustus
or Caesar.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.460
These are the two terms used
for the emperor.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.286
So it's a type,
it's the kind of abstract type

01:03:50.286 --> 01:03:55.268
of the czar, or the kaiser;
old versions of the Caesar myth

01:03:55.268 --> 01:03:57.409
in modern languages.
 

01:03:57.409 --> 01:04:00.400
That's it, Augustus.
 

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.619
Yes?
 

01:04:03.619 --> 01:04:06.659
Student:  You talked
about those people who are

01:04:06.659 --> 01:04:08.840
guilty of
&gt;?

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.409
Prof: They are guilty of?
 

01:04:10.409 --> 01:04:14.230
Student:  They're guilty
of lust, the thing that shows

01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:17.668
the pleasure over rationality
and they're in the second

01:04:17.668 --> 01:04:18.369
circle.
 

01:04:18.369 --> 01:04:23.902
The sodomites are in the
seventh circle and there's a

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:28.603
difference there because of--
were serious violations of

01:04:28.603 --> 01:04:31.150
natural law,
or is this really an

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:36.431
intellectual choice on their
part to engage in behavior both

01:04:36.431 --> 01:04:41.804
intellectual and physical which
is much more serious than the

01:04:41.804 --> 01:04:46.550
incontinence of the people in
the second circle.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:51.266
Prof: The question is,
is meant to have me think about

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:56.570
the relationship between the
sinners of lust and the sinners

01:04:56.570 --> 01:05:00.523
of sodomy,
and the premise of the question

01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:05.855
is that the sinners of lust,
we have sinners who invert the

01:05:05.855 --> 01:05:08.579
order of reason and pleasure.
 

01:05:08.579 --> 01:05:13.597
Whereas, in the sin of--the
question then is why are the

01:05:13.597 --> 01:05:18.797
sinners of sodomy placed in a--
further down in Hell and if

01:05:18.797 --> 01:05:23.009
this is because there's a
question of an intellectual

01:05:23.009 --> 01:05:23.820
choice.
 

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:29.518
This has been a--my answer is
the following that the--

01:05:29.518 --> 01:05:33.619
No, there is no indication in
this canto,

01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:38.206
in Canto XV,
that the sin here is that there

01:05:38.206 --> 01:05:40.626
is some--
there are intellectual

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:42.530
perversions,
which you are right,

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:45.139
your question is well taken
that all clerics,

01:05:45.139 --> 01:05:48.976
in the sense of clerics,
meaning not just where we today

01:05:48.976 --> 01:05:53.284
think as man of the cloth,
but meaning intellectuals,

01:05:53.284 --> 01:05:56.972
Priscius, Accursius,
who is also mentioned,

01:05:56.972 --> 01:06:02.420
a famous crusader of the laws
then Brunetto Latini himself.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:07.030
The sin here is a sin of
violence.

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:12.668
Just as we had the idea that
education, the educators in

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:18.309
Canto XII, are those who
are--who could pervert the very

01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:20.768
process of teaching.
 

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:24.250
Just as in Canto XIII we had a
stoic,

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.250
Pier delle Vigne,
is really stoic who--

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:31.610
a stoic who now reflects that
suicide is not a virtue and the

01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:32.920
virtuous choice.
 

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:38.311
But these are sinners who have
yielded to--whether it is

01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:43.996
anger--they have yielded to the
impulses of violence within

01:06:43.996 --> 01:06:44.880
them.
 

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.489
Dante I think is condemning
sodomy,

01:06:47.489 --> 01:06:50.231
because I think this is also
part of the question you're

01:06:50.231 --> 01:06:52.963
asking,
it may not be the central part,

01:06:52.963 --> 01:06:56.635
but because there is whatever--
there has been violence

01:06:56.635 --> 01:06:58.360
connected to their activity.
 

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.139
This is the--why would he place
them in the circle of violence?

01:07:03.139 --> 01:07:06.672
Unlike, for instance,
what happens to Guido

01:07:06.672 --> 01:07:10.251
Guinizelli in Canto XXVI,
or Caesar by the way,

01:07:10.251 --> 01:07:13.217
there is also an illusion to
Caesar in Canto XXVI of

01:07:13.217 --> 01:07:14.440
Purgatorio.
 

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.244
So there is a difference there,
a teacher who uses violence,

01:07:18.244 --> 01:07:21.793
so that's the link between
teaching of violence in Canto

01:07:21.793 --> 01:07:22.309
XII.
 

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:26.768
The man of reason,
the stoic believer in the

01:07:26.768 --> 01:07:32.679
logos and the order of
rationality exasperates that

01:07:32.679 --> 01:07:39.420
principle and believes that he
can be both judge and victim,

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:42.409
executioner and the executed
one.

01:07:42.409 --> 01:07:48.746
And now, in Canto XV is this
idea of an--the way in which

01:07:48.746 --> 01:07:54.628
violence has taken over and
obfuscated their order of

01:07:54.628 --> 01:07:56.440
rationality.
 

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:02.760
I don't see the element of
choice in that.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.119
Yes?
 

01:08:04.119 --> 01:08:07.155
Student:  Can you
briefly discuss how Dante

01:08:07.155 --> 01:08:10.440
differentiates various
representations of suicide,

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.500
since Lucretia is in Limbo,
Dido is

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.929
&gt;
 

01:08:15.929 --> 01:08:18.612
in the circle of the lustful,
and then you have Pier delle

01:08:18.612 --> 01:08:20.729
Vigne within the actual circle
of suicide,

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:24.310
and how is it that he makes the
distinction between the

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:26.300
different forms of suicides?
 

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:29.488
Prof: Excellent,
the question is,

01:08:29.488 --> 01:08:34.065
is it possible to differentiate
within different forms of

01:08:34.065 --> 01:08:38.010
suicide since Dante--
and that's exactly right,

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:41.086
exactly true,
Dante would have Lucretia in

01:08:41.086 --> 01:08:45.029
Limbo;
we have Dido in Canto II among

01:08:45.029 --> 01:08:50.003
the lustful souls;
we have Cato in Purgatory,

01:08:50.003 --> 01:08:56.430
etc., and why here in Canto
XIII the suicides are punished?

01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:59.863
Is there some kind of rationale
that we can see behind the

01:08:59.863 --> 01:09:03.538
various--that's the question,
the various forms of suicide.

01:09:03.538 --> 01:09:06.100
The answer that I would give is
the following,

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.788
Dante knows so well that there
are--

01:09:09.788 --> 01:09:13.270
that the phenomenology of acts,
of various acts,

01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:18.266
is vast and cannot quite ever
be brought to one common

01:09:18.266 --> 01:09:19.210
element.
 

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:21.750
So much that at the beginning
of Canto XIV,

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:26.536
if you turn to Canto XIV,
Dante is going through the hot

01:09:26.536 --> 01:09:30.698
sands,
because it's the burning sands

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:35.108
of Hell and he remembers--
he recalls there,

01:09:35.108 --> 01:09:39.215
this must be exactly the
burning sands of the Libyan

01:09:39.215 --> 01:09:43.703
desert that Cato crossed,
which is a way of saying don't

01:09:43.703 --> 01:09:46.693
be surprised--
I think--if you are going to

01:09:46.693 --> 01:09:49.288
encounter Cato a little further
down.

01:09:49.288 --> 01:09:52.158
I know that you expect him to
be here.

01:09:52.158 --> 01:09:55.091
So the question then is,
how does Dante go on

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:59.090
determining the particular--the
value of a particular act?

01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:03.284
When we sin,
this may be a little bit--I

01:10:03.284 --> 01:10:07.050
have to be very clear about
this.

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:12.198
When we sin we usually can say,
well,

01:10:12.198 --> 01:10:16.868
how can it be--I'm going to
give you a kind of--

01:10:16.868 --> 01:10:20.423
I'm going to take a little bit
of distance from this whole

01:10:20.423 --> 01:10:21.109
question.
 

01:10:21.109 --> 01:10:26.837
It's easy to say,
how can Dante be so ruthless:

01:10:26.837 --> 01:10:29.978
that someone,
for all we know,

01:10:29.978 --> 01:10:32.488
may have been a good human
being,

01:10:32.488 --> 01:10:38.319
and then they committed one
crime and they are in Hell

01:10:38.319 --> 01:10:40.960
forever, for eternity.
 

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.966
And that, on the face of it,
would seem to be a reasonable

01:10:45.966 --> 01:10:48.000
query;
a sort of indirect,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.920
oblique way of asking for a
little bit more tolerance and

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:56.050
benevolence from this man who
claims to be the supreme judge

01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:59.760
of all that human beings have
been perpetrating.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.288
The fact is that whenever we
sin, all sins are involved.

01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:07.529
We think that it's only one,
but all sins are involved.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:11.350
Dante highlights one specific
aspect.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:14.597
In the case of Dido,
her lust is more important

01:11:14.597 --> 01:11:17.917
than--in the sense,
more decisive and determines

01:11:17.917 --> 01:11:21.520
the character of that
figure--than the suicide.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.140
This suicide is seen as an
extension of her lust.

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.618
In the case Lucretia,
put in Limbo,

01:11:27.618 --> 01:11:30.908
there is a way in which Dante
really wants to make that clear

01:11:30.908 --> 01:11:35.373
distinction and even it's--
an anti-Augustinian moment that

01:11:35.373 --> 01:11:38.988
Lucretia's virtues seem to have
been--

01:11:38.988 --> 01:11:41.538
limited as they are,
she's not saved in any way,

01:11:41.538 --> 01:11:45.993
but there is a kind of
exemplary virtue that allows him

01:11:45.993 --> 01:11:50.065
to sort of remember,
but not punish her for a crime

01:11:50.065 --> 01:11:54.710
which is really to be understood
as a consequence of an excessive

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.960
way of understanding virtue.
 

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.118
Do you see what I'm saying?
 

01:11:58.118 --> 01:12:02.265
In the case of Cato,
and we are going to see that,

01:12:02.265 --> 01:12:05.988
he sees the sacrifice of self
for freedom.

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:09.274
That's really the great
understanding:

01:12:09.274 --> 01:12:13.981
Cato dies for the sake of
freedom and all the canto of

01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:18.342
Purgatory is a--
the Canto I of Purgatory

01:12:18.342 --> 01:12:21.130
is a reflection on the question
of freedom.

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:23.117
Roman freedom,
and by the way,

01:12:23.117 --> 01:12:26.131
the biblical Jewish
understanding of freedom,

01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:26.680
too.
 

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.760
I'm preparing you for that
canto, so maybe I'll save myself

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.840
the trouble of repeating these
things when we get there.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:38.175
Dante will talk about Roman
freedom through Cato and

01:12:38.175 --> 01:12:43.510
immediately after a troop of
angels will arrive,

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:47.149
and they sing one song which is
In exitu Israel de

01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:50.756
Aegypto,
which is to say the Jewish,

01:12:50.756 --> 01:12:52.840
the famous Psalm 113.
 

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.363
That's the Psalm of David,
where David is reflecting about

01:12:57.363 --> 01:12:59.029
the epic of Exodus.
 

01:12:59.029 --> 01:13:05.820
The lyrical reflection about
the idea that getting from Egypt

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.746
on the way to Jerusalem was--
which only some got to,

01:13:10.746 --> 01:13:13.344
for instance,
Moses never did--is really a

01:13:13.344 --> 01:13:14.479
quest for freedom.
 

01:13:14.479 --> 01:13:17.341
There are two ideas of freedom:
a political,

01:13:17.341 --> 01:13:20.670
civil freedom and a theological
idea of freedom.

01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:24.740
And that's really the key to
understanding Cato and

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:29.381
understanding the way Dante
connects these two traditions:

01:13:29.381 --> 01:13:32.640
the Roman and the Jewish
traditions.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.050
Other questions?
 

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:40.122
We have one minute,
the tape probably lasts just

01:13:40.122 --> 01:13:45.520
about 45 seconds to get the
question and answer.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.649
Questions?
 

01:13:47.649 --> 01:13:51.149
Student:  Well,
&gt;

01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:55.618
it seems like you're saying
here that Dante is almost

01:13:55.618 --> 01:14:00.689
finding a kind of sin when
virtue is taken to an excess,

01:14:00.689 --> 01:14:04.720
in people like Lucretia and
Cato, he's saying you can go too

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.127
far,
you can be too obsessed with a

01:14:07.127 --> 01:14:11.729
certain--
almost a misdirection of virtue.

01:14:11.729 --> 01:14:13.520
Prof: Yes.
 

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.319
It's not a question because I
said 'yes' and I would agree.

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:22.529
The reflection is it seems,
I don't like that,

01:14:22.529 --> 01:14:25.810
it seems that I'm saying--but
I'm saying that actually--

01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:31.760
that in Dante,
Dante views the excess of

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:39.390
virtue also as part of a sin and
I would agree,

01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:41.368
I would agree yes.
 

01:14:41.368 --> 01:14:41.581
Okay.
 

01:14:41.581 --> 01:14:42.003
Thank you.
 

01:14:42.003 --> 01:14:42.850
See you next time.

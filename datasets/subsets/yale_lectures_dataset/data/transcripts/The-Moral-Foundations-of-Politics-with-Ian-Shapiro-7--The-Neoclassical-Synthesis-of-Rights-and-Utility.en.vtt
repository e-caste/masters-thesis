00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.771
Prof: So last Wednesday
I asked you to suspend disbelief

00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:10.526
and bear with me as we worked
our way through the Pareto

00:00:10.526 --> 00:00:14.553
system as a way of backing into
the political theory of John

00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:17.640
Stuart Mill,
which is going to be our

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.760
subject today.
 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.887
And I also promised you that a
side-benefit of Wednesday's

00:00:22.887 --> 00:00:27.231
lecture was you would get to
learn everything you ever needed

00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:30.200
to know about neoclassical
economics.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.189
That in fact is true.
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.041
Everything you ever do in
economics is basically derived

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:42.510
from or built from those simple
ideas that Pareto and Edgeworth

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.010
put together.
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.632
So it is, indeed,
I think, a side-benefit of

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:50.890
working through it.
 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.145
But now what I want to do today
is integrate what we saw in the

00:00:56.145 --> 00:01:01.484
Pareto system and the remarks I
made about Stevenson's emotivism

00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:05.606
and philosophy,
and come into the central

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:10.947
arguments in political theory
that are informed by these

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:13.860
mature Enlightenment ideas.
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.265
And you're going to see why I
talk about the mature

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:21.012
Enlightenment with respect to
Mill further on in today's

00:01:21.012 --> 00:01:21.830
lecture.
 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.333
As you can see here,
I talk about Mill as attempting

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:31.110
to synthesize rights and
utility.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.000
And you might think,
"Well, okay.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.209
How's he going to do that?"
 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.907
Some of you who know a little
bit more about Mill may also

00:01:40.907 --> 00:01:45.059
think it's odd that I have chose
his little essay called "On

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:47.330
Liberty"
for you to read,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.900
in explaining his
utilitarianism,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.319
when in fact Mill wrote an
essay on utilitarianism which

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.346
I'm not having you read,
although I'm certainly not

00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:00.500
prohibiting you from reading it.
 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.861
But I think that what you can
see is that the synthesis of

00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:11.128
rights and utility can be
approached from either end,

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:16.381
and I'm going to approach it
from the rights end at least

00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:19.952
initially,
and then we'll worry about the

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:22.538
utilitarian end of things later.
 

00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:27.391
But I think Mill's basic view
is whether you start to develop

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:31.758
a fully satisfying conception of
individual rights,

00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:35.974
or whether you start to develop
a fully satisfying conception of

00:02:35.974 --> 00:02:39.095
utilitarianism,
you're going to end up

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:44.318
incorporating the other one of
those two into your account.

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:48.190
Let me tell you a little bit
about who John Stuart Mill was.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.318
He was the son of James Mill,
who had been a contemporary of

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:54.970
Jeremy Bentham's.
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.179
Indeed, not only a
contemporary,

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.530
but actually a disciple of
Jeremy Bentham's,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.020
and a true believer in
Benthamite utilitarianism,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.800
including in the matter of the
education of his son.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.723
He was very concerned to give
his son the most efficient

00:03:13.723 --> 00:03:18.647
possible education in order to
get him to achieve at the

00:03:18.647 --> 00:03:20.258
highest level.
 

00:03:20.258 --> 00:03:22.421
And so he was,
what we would today call,

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:23.310
home-schooled.
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.991
There were governesses and
schoolteachers brought to his

00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:27.460
home.
 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.414
He never went to school,
and indeed he turned out to be

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:32.878
a brilliant child.
 

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:39.650
He was doing differential
calculus at a very young age.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.580
He was speaking Latin and Greek
in his teens.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.060
He was just an astonishingly
smart child,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.596
and so they ramped up his
education at an incredible clip

00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:54.667
with the result that,
by the age of 21,

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.120
he actually had a nervous
breakdown.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.150
He had no friends.
 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.560
He had no life.
 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.990
He was a miserable brilliant
nerd.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.639
And he never entirely recovered
from that experience,

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:15.120
and nor did he ever quite
absolve Bentham and his father's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.259
single-mindedness from
responsibility for doing that to

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:22.170
him.
 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.343
And he was a somewhat pained
and tortured person later in

00:04:27.343 --> 00:04:27.990
life.
 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.389
I think he never quite shed the
scars,

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.937
but his wife Harriet,
who was a very interesting

00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:39.017
intellectual in her own right,
and wrote much of Mill's famous

00:04:39.017 --> 00:04:43.528
essay that appeared over his
name on the subjugation of

00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:44.279
women.
 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.694
And indeed, some Mill scholars
think that Harriet also had a

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:53.182
big role in the writing of On
Liberty, but that's more

00:04:53.182 --> 00:04:54.379
speculative.
 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:05:02.588
So he never quite got over that
early shock-and-awe utilitarian

00:05:02.588 --> 00:05:06.807
education,
but he also never entirely shed

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:11.398
the commitment to the idea that
utilitarianism is the best

00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:14.459
system for thinking about
politics.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.016
At one point he says,
"I do endorse

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:22.028
utilitarianism,
but only in the largest sense

00:05:22.028 --> 00:05:25.129
of man as a progressive being.
 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.910
We'll come back to what that
might mean as we proceed.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.110
So Mill does have one useful
characteristic in common with

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.199
Bentham.
 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.079
I think it's the only one.
 

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:43.259
As I said, that Bentham is one
of these monomaniacal people,

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.427
and what makes him useful to us
is he takes an idea and runs

00:05:47.427 --> 00:05:52.641
with it to the absolute extreme,
and that's useful because you

00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:58.029
can see its assumptions in a
very sharp and stark light.

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:03.471
Mill is somebody who is aware
of the infinitely complex nature

00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:09.002
of human existence and is not a
Johnny One Note in a sense that

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:12.329
Bentham was,
and you'll see this very

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:15.120
quickly as we get into his
argument.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.026
Nonetheless,
he shares in common with

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:22.793
Bentham the feature that he
reduces his doctrine to a single

00:06:22.793 --> 00:06:25.620
paragraph, just as Bentham did.
 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.776
It was the opening paragraph of
his Introduction to the

00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:31.160
Principles of Morals and
Legislation.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:37.345
With Mill it comes about twelve
pages in on the Hackett edition

00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:39.540
that you're reading.
 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.711
He says categorically,
The object of this essay is to

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.579
assert one very simple
principle;

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:52.375
as entitled to govern
absolutely (this sounds quite

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:56.779
unequivocal) the dealings of
society with the individual in

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:59.740
the way of compulsion and
control,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.928
whether the means used be
physical force in the form of

00:07:03.928 --> 00:07:08.430
legal penalties or the moral
coercion of public opinion.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.908
That principle is that the sole
end for which mankind are

00:07:13.908 --> 00:07:17.329
warranted,
individually or collectively,

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:21.999
in interfering with the liberty
of action of any of their number

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:23.629
is self-protection.
 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:26.750
That the only purpose for which
power can rightfully be

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.870
exercised over any member of a
civilized community,

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.449
against his will,
is to prevent harm to others.

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:37.449
His own good,
either physical or moral,

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:39.819
is not a sufficient warrant.
 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:42.954
He cannot rightfully be
compelled to do or to forbear

00:07:42.954 --> 00:07:45.730
because it will be better for
him to do so,

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.370
because it will make him
happier, because,

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.887
in the opinions of others,
to do so would be wise or even

00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:52.389
right.
 

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.279
These are good reasons for
remonstrating with him,

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:57.230
or reasoning with him,
or persuading him,

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:01.300
or entreating him,
but not for compelling him or

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.889
visiting him with any evil in
case he do otherwise.

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:10.189
To justify that (that is,
to justify compelling him),

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:16.519
the conduct from which it's
desired to deter him must be

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:21.699
calculated to produce evil to
someone else.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:26.697
The only part of the conduct of
anyone for which he's amenable

00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:30.220
to society is that which
concerns others.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.005
In the part which merely
concerns himself,

00:08:33.005 --> 00:08:35.860
his independence is,
of right, absolute.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.636
Over himself,
over his own body and mind,

00:08:39.636 --> 00:08:42.470
the individual is sovereign.
 

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.580
 
 

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.610
Anyone think they have any
doubt about what he's saying?

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.038
I mean, setting aside whether
you agree with it.

00:08:52.038 --> 00:08:58.720
Anyone think you feel pretty
clear about what he's saying?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.178
Never mind whether we agree
with it.

00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:07.340
Okay, only one person feels
clear.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.678
Who feels unclear about what
he's saying?

00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:16.143
So we have one person who's
clear, nobody who's unclear,

00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:18.129
and 136 undecided?
 

00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:22.820
Wow!
 

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.509
I mean, isn't it clear?
 

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:27.710
As I say, I'm not asking you
whether you agree.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.765
It's just saying,
unless you harm somebody else

00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:35.727
you've got to be left alone,
and the statements a)

00:09:35.727 --> 00:09:39.062
"Leave you alone,"
and b) "Stop anyone else

00:09:39.062 --> 00:09:42.279
who wants to interfere with
you," harkening back to

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:45.730
Bentham's point that the law
should stay the hand of a third

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.899
party, right?
 

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:51.490
That's what he's saying here,
yeah?

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.610
It's not rocket science.
 

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.379
I mean, it's very direct.
 

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:01.058
Okay, so that's what he's
saying.

00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:02.769
You might say,
"Well, okay."

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:06.548
I mean, just to give you an
example,

00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:13.712
he's saying if one of you comes
to me at the end of this course

00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:16.547
and says,
"Professor Shapiro,

00:10:16.547 --> 00:10:19.744
will you write me a letter
because I want to go to law

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:20.710
school?"
 

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.054
And I say, "Well,
I've come to know you,

00:10:25.054 --> 00:10:29.894
and you've got a lot of good
qualities and skills,

00:10:29.894 --> 00:10:32.759
but you are not a lawyer.
 

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:33.690
Trust me.
 

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.279
I've been around a long time.
 

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.879
You should not go to law
school."

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:39.715
The appropriate answer,
Mill would say,

00:10:39.715 --> 00:10:41.889
is, "Well,
thank you for your opinion.

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:44.350
I'm not asking you to tell me
what to do."

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.759
I can plead with you.
 

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.100
I can remonstrate with you.
 

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.541
I can try and persuade you,
but at the end of the day if

00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:53.057
you say,
"Well, thank you very

00:10:53.057 --> 00:10:55.515
much,
but I'm going to law

00:10:55.515 --> 00:11:00.548
school,"
I shouldn't try to coerce you.

00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:03.807
And not only that,
I shouldn't try and get others

00:11:03.807 --> 00:11:05.980
to put pressure on you,
right?

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.697
It's not only should you not be
compelled, but we shouldn't try

00:11:10.697 --> 00:11:14.960
and coerce you with the moral
force of public opinion.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.788
We shouldn't start telling
lawyer jokes to make you feel

00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:20.928
bad, right?
 

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:27.370
So we have to respect the
autonomy of the individual.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.178
Complete opposite,
at least going in,

00:11:30.178 --> 00:11:32.908
from where Bentham starts,
right?

00:11:32.908 --> 00:11:36.440
And one of the things you
should see from this,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.269
and should be starting to go
through your mind,

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:44.817
is that there is a deep
structural identity between

00:11:44.817 --> 00:11:49.636
Mill's harm principle and the
Pareto principle that we

00:11:49.636 --> 00:11:51.820
discussed last time.
 

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.731
I'll come back to that later,
but there's a basic structural

00:11:56.731 --> 00:11:59.730
identity between those two
things.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.513
Now, you could say,
"Okay, so Mill is saying

00:12:03.513 --> 00:12:05.798
respect everybody's rights.
 

00:12:05.798 --> 00:12:09.048
This is a strong theory of
individual rights.

00:12:09.048 --> 00:12:12.642
Unless somebody's harming
somebody else they're to be left

00:12:12.642 --> 00:12:16.423
alone and the state has to make
sure that they're going to be

00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:17.370
left alone.
 

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.240
Fine, that's a theory of
rights, but what does this have

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.909
to do with utilitarianism?"
 

00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:22.379
Right?
 

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:26.211
How does Mill get from
protecting freedom of the

00:12:26.211 --> 00:12:31.267
individual through this robust
doctrine of individual rights to

00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:36.730
the notion that we're going to
maximize the utility in society?

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:42.610
 
 

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.250
Anyone have any idea?
 

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.308
 
 

00:12:49.308 --> 00:12:50.171
Anyone?
 

00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:50.787
Yeah?
 

00:12:50.787 --> 00:12:51.894
Yes, sir?
 

00:12:51.894 --> 00:12:55.220
Wait for the microphone.
 

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.789
Student:  Does he argue
that freedom leads to the

00:12:56.789 --> 00:12:57.590
highest level of pleasure?
 

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.472
That an individual given that
type of freedom would gain

00:13:00.472 --> 00:13:03.461
utility from that and thus
maximizing that type of freedom

00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:04.929
at the individual level?
 

00:13:04.929 --> 00:13:07.048
Prof: But why?
 

00:13:07.048 --> 00:13:08.629
Student:  Why do we gain
utility from freedom?

00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:10.479
Prof: Yes.
 

00:13:10.479 --> 00:13:15.048
In Mill's mind,
why does maximizing freedom

00:13:15.048 --> 00:13:17.769
also maximize utility?
 

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:19.892
I mean, you're right.
 

00:13:19.892 --> 00:13:24.441
You're dead right,
but there's an intermediate

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:25.250
step.
 

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.288
Yeah? Okay, over here.
 

00:13:27.288 --> 00:13:31.822
Student:  According to
Mill, only individual people can

00:13:31.822 --> 00:13:35.240
decide for themselves what makes
them happy.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.988
Prof: According to Mill
only individuals can decide for

00:13:38.988 --> 00:13:41.139
themselves what makes them
happy.

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:45.701
That is also correct,
but there's still another step

00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:50.798
in this that I want us to focus
on that neither of you has

00:13:50.798 --> 00:13:52.409
mentioned yet.
 

00:13:52.409 --> 00:13:55.970
Yeah?
 

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.000
Student:  Maybe that
individuals,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.769
knowing their own desires,
will bargain with one another,

00:13:59.769 --> 00:14:04.440
using their freedom to gain the
mutual maximum utility.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.543
Prof: Well,
that's a very good point,

00:14:06.543 --> 00:14:09.527
and that is where the identity
with the Pareto principle comes

00:14:09.527 --> 00:14:09.870
in.
 

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.772
If you leave people alone,
right, they will do what they

00:14:13.772 --> 00:14:16.538
want with themselves or with
others,

00:14:16.538 --> 00:14:21.609
and so what Mill's harm
principle allows in politics is

00:14:21.609 --> 00:14:27.335
this sort of analog of what we
were calling Pareto superior in

00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:28.649
economics.
 

00:14:28.649 --> 00:14:32.408
That's also true,
but it's not what I was looking

00:14:32.408 --> 00:14:35.697
for right now,
though there's no reason you

00:14:35.697 --> 00:14:39.769
should know that because you
can't read my mind.

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:42.309
But there's another step.
 

00:14:42.309 --> 00:14:44.480
Think back to the big picture.
 

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.960
The big picture is all these
Enlightenment theories are

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.938
committed both to the freedom of
individual and to scientific

00:14:53.938 --> 00:14:55.350
truth, right?
 

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.230
Mill is an Enlightenment
thinker of the first order.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:07.043
If you flip through your whole
copy of On Liberty you'll

00:15:07.043 --> 00:15:12.210
see--what is the longest chapter
about?

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.570
What is the longest chapter
about?

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.159
It's probably half the book.
 

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:28.570
 
 

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.769
Student:  Freedom of
thought and discussion.

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:31.370
Prof: Freedom of thought
and discussion,

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.649
right.
 

00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:34.288
Freedom of speech.
 

00:15:34.288 --> 00:15:38.320
So why is freedom of speech so
important?

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:44.250
Because Mill thinks that is the
path to the truth.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.408
Freedom of speech is the path
to the truth.

00:15:47.408 --> 00:15:51.181
I want to spend a little bit of
time on this because it's really

00:15:51.181 --> 00:15:51.899
important.
 

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:57.470
It's really important for two
reasons.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:02.741
The first is you're going to
see a very different conception

00:16:02.741 --> 00:16:05.870
of science informing Mill's
work.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.927
Remember back to our discussion
of the early Enlightenment of

00:16:10.927 --> 00:16:14.552
Hobbes, of Locke,
of Bentham, that truth was

00:16:14.552 --> 00:16:16.830
equated with certainty.
 

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.321
Remember, the
seventeenth-century people had

00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:22.797
this weird root to this because
it wasn't what we think of as

00:16:22.797 --> 00:16:26.519
a priori truths,
but things that were a product

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:28.620
of wills and all that,
right?

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.148
But the early Enlightenment
idea of science is to find

00:16:34.148 --> 00:16:36.129
certainty, right?
 

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:38.580
Cartesian doubt,
remember, is looking for

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.888
propositions that cannot be
doubted, things that can be

00:16:41.888 --> 00:16:43.419
known with certainty.
 

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:45.690
Mill is a fallibilist.
 

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:49.168
Mill has a much more modern
concept of science,

00:16:49.168 --> 00:16:52.558
the one that you intuitively
have, which says,

00:16:52.558 --> 00:16:56.562
first of all,
that all knowledge is

00:16:56.562 --> 00:17:00.533
corrigible,
all propositions have to be

00:17:00.533 --> 00:17:04.923
evaluated by reference to
evidence in the scientific

00:17:04.923 --> 00:17:08.421
method,
and we could always be wrong in

00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:10.480
our attempts to do that.
 

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:17.432
So a very important move in the
history of the philosophy of

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:19.805
science,
in this regard,

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:24.180
was to move away from talking
about what philosophers used--

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.670
they used the word
verificationism,

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.608
proving that a scientific
theory is correct,

00:17:30.608 --> 00:17:34.420
and instead starting to talk
about falsificationism,

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.269
proving that it hasn't yet been
falsified.

00:17:39.269 --> 00:17:44.454
And so any of you who takes a
statistics course in the social

00:17:44.454 --> 00:17:48.950
sciences will know what you have
is a hypothesis,

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:59.680
an empirical hypothesis,
saying high tax rates lead to

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.108
inflation.
 

00:18:02.108 --> 00:18:05.368
And you go and you'll test it
against the evidence.

00:18:05.368 --> 00:18:09.256
And you'll have some other
hypothesis that will be called

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:13.128
the competing hypothesis,
or the null hypothesis,

00:18:13.128 --> 00:18:17.911
and all you'll ever be able to
say is that your hypothesis

00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:20.680
hasn't been shown to be false.
 

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.414
You'll never know for certain
that some other hypothesis

00:18:25.414 --> 00:18:27.740
couldn't do better,
okay?

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.471
So falsificationism is the idea
that would eventually become

00:18:32.471 --> 00:18:37.526
associated with the philosopher
Karl Popper who we don't read in

00:18:37.526 --> 00:18:38.808
this course.
 

00:18:38.808 --> 00:18:43.818
But it's this idea that
knowledge claims are corrigible.

00:18:43.818 --> 00:18:47.249
All of our knowledge claims
might be wrong,

00:18:47.249 --> 00:18:51.820
and the scientific attitude
involves recognizing that and

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.700
acting accordingly.
 

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.528
So the mature Enlightenment
conception of science means you

00:18:58.528 --> 00:19:03.940
have to be committed to finding
the truth as an ongoing quest,

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:10.440
and this is really important
for Mill, okay?

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:16.606
So freedom of speech is really
important for Mill as a path to

00:19:16.606 --> 00:19:20.450
the truth, as the path to the
truth.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.538
Now, that's one reason it's
important.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:32.803
The second is that Mill injects
into a desirable political

00:19:32.803 --> 00:19:40.279
system, the importance of
argument, arguing.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:44.284
And this is going to come up
again and again in the course,

00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:47.460
particularly in the last
section when we get to

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.980
democratic theory.
 

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.193
When I say Mill talks about the
importance of argument,

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:56.548
this is very different from
deliberation.

00:19:56.548 --> 00:19:59.886
It's not the idea that we
should all get together,

00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:02.067
and hold hands,
and sing Kumbaya,

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:04.519
and see what we can agree
about.

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:07.779
That's the sort of deliberative
ideal, right?

00:20:07.779 --> 00:20:08.848
Deliberation.
 

00:20:08.848 --> 00:20:12.118
Argument is,
how many here have seen Prime

00:20:12.118 --> 00:20:14.990
Minister's Questions on TV,
right?

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.048
That's argument, okay?
 

00:20:17.048 --> 00:20:19.218
Or Crossfire,
the TV program,

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:22.471
that's argument,
where people hurl the best

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:27.118
criticisms they can come up with
against the other side.

00:20:27.118 --> 00:20:31.682
It's not surprisingly where
Mill is often held to be

00:20:31.682 --> 00:20:36.960
responsible for the metaphor of
the competition of ideas.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:43.441
These are two very different
models of the role of speech in

00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:44.650
politics.
 

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:50.584
Just to give you an example of
what's at stake here,

00:20:50.584 --> 00:20:57.567
there's a lot of experimental
work that's been done by social

00:20:57.567 --> 00:21:01.640
psychologists on this question.
 

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:08.570
So suppose there's a field and
in the middle of the field there

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:15.615
is a cow, and we're all standing
around the field looking at the

00:21:15.615 --> 00:21:16.509
cow.
 

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:23.108
And the question is,
what does the cow weigh?

00:21:23.108 --> 00:21:27.130
And think about two ways of
tackling this question.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.689
One would be that we all
discuss--"What do you think

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:31.769
the cow weighs?
 

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:35.126
What do you think it
weighs?"--and we eventually

00:21:35.126 --> 00:21:39.000
reach some agreement upon what
we think the cow weighs and we

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.548
go with that number.
 

00:21:40.548 --> 00:21:45.971
The second approach would be to
say we don't talk to each other

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:46.759
at all.
 

00:21:46.759 --> 00:21:52.215
Each of us looks at the cow and
makes our own best judgment

00:21:52.215 --> 00:21:54.848
about what the cow weighs.
 

00:21:54.848 --> 00:21:59.328
We add them all up and divide
it by the number of people.

00:21:59.328 --> 00:22:06.036
Which method do you think is
more likely to get the weight of

00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:08.160
the cow accurate?
 

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.710
How many people think the
deliberative method?

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.690
Hands up for the deliberative
method.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.858
Okay, it looks like about a
third of you.

00:22:16.858 --> 00:22:20.155
How many for the
non-deliberative additive

00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:20.880
method?
 

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.670
Okay, so you win two-to-one.
 

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.940
Well, it turns out you're right.
 

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:30.218
It turns out that the
non-deliberative additive method

00:22:30.218 --> 00:22:36.094
gets the answer right almost
exactly, where the deliberative

00:22:36.094 --> 00:22:39.578
method goes all over the place.
 

00:22:39.578 --> 00:22:43.838
Now, there's lots of
speculation about why.

00:22:43.838 --> 00:22:49.560
Now, one reason could be,
well, the trouble with the

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:55.955
deliberative method is it's
going to lead people to listen

00:22:55.955 --> 00:23:01.240
to strong personalities,
or people who think they know

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.568
more than they do.
 

00:23:02.568 --> 00:23:06.567
Leonid over there says,
"Look, I grew up on a

00:23:06.567 --> 00:23:07.140
farm.
 

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.048
Don't tell me about cows.
 

00:23:09.048 --> 00:23:11.368
I know everything there is to
know about cows,

00:23:11.368 --> 00:23:12.710
what do you people know?
 

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.700
And I say that cow weighs 1500
pounds."

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.099
And then a lot of other people
say, "Well,

00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:20.569
he did.
 

00:23:20.569 --> 00:23:21.490
He grew up on a farm.
 

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.460
What do I know?"
 

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.390
And so maybe opinion gets
swayed in that way.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.140
That's one possible reason.
 

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.069
People may copy what other
people say just because they

00:23:35.069 --> 00:23:37.170
don't know, etcetera.
 

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.835
But for whatever reason,
and we could speculate,

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:43.125
and when we come to talk about
deliberative democracy later

00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:44.598
we'll go into it more.
 

00:23:44.598 --> 00:23:49.224
I just wanted to flag this
distinction that argument is not

00:23:49.224 --> 00:23:50.900
deliberation,
okay?

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:57.005
And so when Mill talks about
argument it's rather this idea

00:23:57.005 --> 00:24:02.690
that everybody makes their own
independent judgment.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.397
He wants our capacity to make
that judgment to be

00:24:07.397 --> 00:24:11.518
strengthened,
but that's not the same thing

00:24:11.518 --> 00:24:13.480
as deliberation.
 

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.248
He wants us to have our own
individual robust judgments and

00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:19.808
trust them, okay?
 

00:24:19.808 --> 00:24:24.881
That is his ideal,
and we should never ever kowtow

00:24:24.881 --> 00:24:27.778
to the opinions of others.
 

00:24:27.778 --> 00:24:29.848
This is not a deliberative
model.

00:24:29.848 --> 00:24:34.098
And indeed, Mill gives us four
reasons for thinking that

00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:36.650
freedom of speech is important.
 

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:43.310
For one thing he says
here--this is the point about

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.069
fallibilism--
he says if any opinion is

00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:49.526
compelled to silence,
that opinion,

00:24:49.526 --> 00:24:52.670
for all we might know,
might be true.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.640
"To deny that is to assume
our own infallibility."

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.188
So science is not about
certainty, it's not about faith,

00:25:01.188 --> 00:25:01.848
right?
 

00:25:01.848 --> 00:25:07.200
It's recognizing that whatever
we say might be wrong.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.670
Secondly, though a silenced
opinion be an error,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:15.470
it may, and very commonly does,
contain a portion of the truth;

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.796
and since the general or
prevailing opinion on any

00:25:18.796 --> 00:25:21.920
subject is rarely or never the
whole truth,

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.977
it is only by the collision of
adverse opinions (that's Prime

00:25:25.977 --> 00:25:29.327
Minister's Questions,
that is Crossfire,

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:34.611
the collision of adverse
opinions) that the remainder of

00:25:34.611 --> 00:25:39.029
the truth has any chance of
being supplied.

00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:43.726
Thirdly, even if the received
opinion be not only true,

00:25:43.726 --> 00:25:47.388
but the whole truth;
unless it is suffered to be and

00:25:47.388 --> 00:25:50.220
actually is,
vigorously and earnestly

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.986
contested,
it will, by most of those who

00:25:52.986 --> 00:25:55.726
receive it,
be held in the manner of a

00:25:55.726 --> 00:25:58.905
prejudice,
with little comprehension or

00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:01.588
feeling of its rational grounds.
 

00:26:01.588 --> 00:26:04.430
That is, you don't want to only
get the right answer.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.630
You want to get the right
answer for the right reason.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.230
If you copy somebody's math
assignment when you can't do the

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.490
problem you have the right
answer,

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.650
but you haven't got the right
answer for the right reason.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.549
And not only this, but;
fourthly, the meaning of the

00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:22.980
doctrine itself will be in
danger of being lost,

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.694
or enfeebled,
and deprived of all its vital

00:26:25.694 --> 00:26:29.509
effect on the character and
conduct: the dogma of becoming a

00:26:29.509 --> 00:26:33.238
mere formal profession,
inefficacious for good,

00:26:33.238 --> 00:26:37.564
but cumbering the ground,
and preventing the growth of

00:26:37.564 --> 00:26:41.046
any real and heartfelt
conviction from reason or

00:26:41.046 --> 00:26:42.750
personal experience.
 

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.873
So you can say that Mill is,
in some ways,

00:26:46.873 --> 00:26:51.700
what we would think of today as
a libertarian.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.640
He's got this idea of freedom
of speech.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.663
We should all be left alone to
do as we like without

00:26:56.663 --> 00:26:59.865
interference from the state
except when the state stops

00:26:59.865 --> 00:27:03.825
others from interfering with us,
right, what Nozick will later

00:27:03.825 --> 00:27:06.868
call the night-watchman state of
liberal theory,

00:27:06.868 --> 00:27:10.759
this negative-freedom,
standard libertarian view.

00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:13.838
On the other hand,
he's also a kind of romantic

00:27:13.838 --> 00:27:15.380
individualist,
right?

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.880
He sees individual human
flourishing.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.990
Somebody said here,
"The path to happiness.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.910
Everybody knows their own
sources of utility.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.440
Nobody can tell you what makes
you happy."

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.009
This is the link to Stevenson
we were talking about last time.

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:34.309
I can't tell you what should be
in your utility function.

00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:35.490
I don't know.
 

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.917
No interpersonal comparisons of
utility, that's the link to

00:27:38.917 --> 00:27:39.450
Pareto.
 

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:44.847
So you can see in all of these
fields this move to--it's not

00:27:44.847 --> 00:27:49.148
mere subjectivism,
it's the romantic celebration

00:27:49.148 --> 00:27:51.618
of subjectivism,
right?

00:27:51.618 --> 00:27:59.759
The full flourishing of your
potential can only happen if you

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:05.048
are allowed total freedom of
speech,

00:28:05.048 --> 00:28:11.920
of anything you want to do so
long as you don't harm others.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:17.067
And this is important not just
for your own individual utility

00:28:17.067 --> 00:28:21.144
function,
but also because that's how

00:28:21.144 --> 00:28:26.446
society learns the truth,
and truth is going to be

00:28:26.446 --> 00:28:29.990
important for the pursuit of
utility.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.048
You need these tough-minded
critics.

00:28:33.048 --> 00:28:38.463
Whereas for Locke we were all
miniature gods who have maker's

00:28:38.463 --> 00:28:43.246
knowledge about creation,
for Mill we're all miniature

00:28:43.246 --> 00:28:44.598
scientists.
 

00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:48.659
We've got to have the critical
attitude, and you can't get a

00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:52.650
critical attitude if you're
copying other people's math.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:58.608
You have to be able to defend
your reasoning to all comers.

00:28:58.608 --> 00:29:02.583
You have to stand there like
Gordon Brown at question time

00:29:02.583 --> 00:29:05.930
and have people hurl counter
examples at you,

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.201
not people who are trying to
get your agreement,

00:29:09.201 --> 00:29:09.690
okay?
 

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.328
It's the combat of ideas,
the clash of ideas.

00:29:13.328 --> 00:29:17.574
The truth comes out as a
by-product of that just as in

00:29:17.574 --> 00:29:21.577
the invisible hand theory of
markets the truth is a

00:29:21.577 --> 00:29:26.696
by-product,
efficiency is a by-product of

00:29:26.696 --> 00:29:31.990
lots of individual transactions,
right?

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:38.180
So that is the connection,
if you like,

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.393
between Mill's idea of the
importance of each individual

00:29:42.393 --> 00:29:46.990
getting the truth for themselves
and the Pareto principle.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.788
In both cases it's an invisible
hand explanation,

00:29:51.788 --> 00:29:57.588
which says as a byproduct of
this utilitarian efficiency is

00:29:57.588 --> 00:29:58.990
maximized.
 

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:06.441
That's why the chapter on
freedom of speech is central to

00:30:06.441 --> 00:30:08.568
this doctrine.
 

00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:14.102
Okay, so all well and good,
you might say,

00:30:14.102 --> 00:30:22.200
but how many read to the end,
the chapter on applications?

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.096
It all starts to unravel,
it seems, once we get to the

00:30:26.096 --> 00:30:28.009
chapter on applications.
 

00:30:28.009 --> 00:30:30.380
Here Mill says,
In many cases,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.420
an individual,
in pursuing a legitimate

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.281
object,
necessarily and therefore

00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:39.848
legitimately causes pain or loss
to others,

00:30:39.848 --> 00:30:44.347
or intercepts a good which they
had a reasonable hope of

00:30:44.347 --> 00:30:45.328
attaining.
 

00:30:45.328 --> 00:30:49.090
Such opposition of interest
between individuals often arise

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.982
from bad social institutions,
but are unavoidable while those

00:30:52.982 --> 00:30:56.259
institutions last;
and some would be unavoidable

00:30:56.259 --> 00:30:57.788
under any institutions.
 

00:30:57.788 --> 00:31:03.537
Whoever succeeds in an
overcrowded profession,

00:31:03.537 --> 00:31:07.880
or in a competitive
examination;

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.611
whoever is preferred to another
in any contest for an object

00:31:11.611 --> 00:31:15.069
which both desire,
reaps benefit from the loss of

00:31:15.069 --> 00:31:17.796
others,
from their wasted exertion and

00:31:17.796 --> 00:31:18.910
disappointment.
 

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.281
But it is, by common admission,
better for the general interest

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:26.286
of mankind,
that persons should pursue

00:31:26.286 --> 00:31:30.630
their objects undeterred by this
sort of consequences,

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.358
in other words,
society admits no right,

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:36.675
either legal or moral,
in the disappointed

00:31:36.675 --> 00:31:40.057
competitors,
to immunity from this kind of

00:31:40.057 --> 00:31:42.788
suffering;
and feels called on to

00:31:42.788 --> 00:31:48.078
interfere, only when means of
success have been employed which

00:31:48.078 --> 00:31:52.588
it is contrary to the general
interest to permit;

00:31:52.588 --> 00:31:56.298
namely, fraud or treachery,
and force.

00:31:56.298 --> 00:31:58.558
What's the problem with all of
that?

00:31:58.558 --> 00:32:04.680
It's not exactly eloquent,
but what's the problem there?

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.279
Isn't there a problem?
 

00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:09.279
Maybe there's no problem.
 

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:21.039
 
 

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:24.430
That's called a clue.
 

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.509
What's the problem?
 

00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:29.118
Yeah?
 

00:32:29.118 --> 00:32:31.596
Student: According to this
couldn't you reason that

00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:34.520
something like the Holocaust was
okay if it's in the general

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.630
interest of mankind,
or any kind of...

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.220
Professor Ian Shapiro: Yeah.
 

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.019
It's a big problem, right?
 

00:32:41.019 --> 00:32:47.531
I mean, didn't he say earlier
on that people can't be coerced

00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:53.609
into accepting results just
because the majority believes

00:32:53.609 --> 00:32:54.368
it?
 

00:32:54.368 --> 00:32:59.251
And he went out of his way,
he went out of way to say

00:32:59.251 --> 00:33:04.980
whether it's the actions of the
majority or the moral coercion

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.218
of public opinion,
but here he's saying,

00:33:08.218 --> 00:33:10.990
"But it is by common
admission better that we have

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.068
competitive exams.
 

00:33:12.068 --> 00:33:15.086
Of course the people who don't
get the job are harmed,

00:33:15.086 --> 00:33:16.509
but it's too bad."
 

00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:19.559
Seems like a contradiction.
 

00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:23.549
No?
 

00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:27.970
Give another example:
Again, trade is a social act.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.615
Whoever undertakes to sell any
description of goods to the

00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:35.133
public, does what affects the
interest of other persons,

00:33:35.133 --> 00:33:38.060
and society in general;
and thus his conduct,

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.950
in principle,
comes within the jurisdiction

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.435
of society: accordingly,
it was once held to be the duty

00:33:44.435 --> 00:33:46.592
of governments,
in all cases which were

00:33:46.592 --> 00:33:49.093
considered of importance,
to fix prices,

00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:52.150
and regulate the process of
manufacture.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:58.430
But (I love this passive voice)
it is now recognized,

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.130
though not till after a long
struggle,

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.103
that both the cheapness and the
good quality of commodities are

00:34:05.103 --> 00:34:08.755
more effectually provided for by
leaving the producers and

00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:12.550
sellers perfectly free,
under the sole check of equal

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.550
freedom to the buyers for
supplying themselves elsewhere.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.880
This is the so-called doctrine
of Free Trade,

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.750
which rests on grounds
different from,

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:25.885
though equally solid with,
the principle of individual

00:34:25.885 --> 00:34:28.460
liberty asserted in this Essay.
 

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:33.570
 
 

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.610
Same problem, right?
 

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.980
It is now recognized, by whom?
 

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.409
Why should we believe that?
 

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:44.572
And more importantly,
aren't we supposed to be

00:34:44.572 --> 00:34:48.460
protected from the dominant
view, right?

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:49.340
So, free trade.
 

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.369
We think about the arguments we
have today.

00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:54.699
This is a century later.
 

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.130
The arguments we have about
outsourcing.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:02.724
Yes, they harm the interests of
American workers when they move

00:35:02.724 --> 00:35:07.059
factories to Mexico,
but Mill said, "Yeah,

00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:09.420
it's true, but free trade's
better."

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:14.869
It's better from the standpoint
of utilitarianism.

00:35:14.869 --> 00:35:23.119
Big problem, it seems.
 

00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:26.869
You think Mill was just
actually not that smart,

00:35:26.869 --> 00:35:30.059
he didn't see this huge
contradiction?

00:35:30.059 --> 00:35:34.373
Sort of, right,
the minute you start to apply

00:35:34.373 --> 00:35:38.489
this doctrine it all just turns
to sand?

00:35:38.489 --> 00:35:42.619
 
 

00:35:42.619 --> 00:35:45.480
Anyone think there's a way out
of this for Mill?

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:52.849
 
 

00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:56.588
Well, people have been
struggling with this ever since

00:35:56.588 --> 00:36:00.539
he wrote it because it does seem
to be a big problem,

00:36:00.539 --> 00:36:05.382
but on the other hand the
allure of this rights-utility

00:36:05.382 --> 00:36:10.224
synthesis is so great that
people want to find a way to

00:36:10.224 --> 00:36:11.389
solve it.
 

00:36:11.389 --> 00:36:14.615
And I think this is how Mill
thought about this:

00:36:14.615 --> 00:36:16.949
there's no contradiction at
all.

00:36:16.949 --> 00:36:22.539
I think that Mill thinks in
terms of a two-step test.

00:36:22.539 --> 00:36:31.532
Step one, as you say,
of any proposed action,

00:36:31.532 --> 00:36:40.730
is there going to be harm to
somebody else?

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:48.713
So, smoking marijuana,
or in more, I guess,

00:36:48.713 --> 00:36:58.599
contextually appropriate at the
time, prohibition.

00:36:58.599 --> 00:37:03.659
This is a case that Mill
considered in what you read.

00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:09.244
If you go to your room and you
get paralytically drunk or you

00:37:09.244 --> 00:37:15.110
get stoned, and you sleep it
off, you're not harming anybody.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.980
So it's protected.
 

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.067
So Mill was a libertarian in
that sense, and he opposed

00:37:23.067 --> 00:37:27.760
prohibition which was a very
live issue when he was writing.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.684
But there are a lot of
activities where it's inevitable

00:37:31.684 --> 00:37:34.010
that there's going to be harm.
 

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:39.688
Yes, it's true that
protectionism harms some people,

00:37:39.688 --> 00:37:45.146
but any trade regime is going
to harm some people,

00:37:45.146 --> 00:37:46.260
right?
 

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.038
So, I'm sorry;
free trade harms American

00:37:51.038 --> 00:37:55.231
workers, but protectionism harms
African workers or Indonesian

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.469
workers, right?
 

00:37:56.469 --> 00:38:01.552
Whatever you do for a trade
policy somebody's going to be

00:38:01.552 --> 00:38:04.257
harmed,
or whatever system you have for

00:38:04.257 --> 00:38:06.579
giving away jobs in the civil
service,

00:38:06.579 --> 00:38:09.260
whoever doesn't get the job's
going to be harmed.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.126
If you have pure competition
the people who don't get the

00:38:13.126 --> 00:38:15.889
highest scores are going to be
harmed.

00:38:15.889 --> 00:38:21.411
If you have job reservation for
whites, as they had in South

00:38:21.411 --> 00:38:26.280
Africa, then blacks are not
going to get the jobs.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.260
If you have affirmative action
to remedy past injustices in the

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:36.188
Connecticut Fire Department,
then the people who would

00:38:36.188 --> 00:38:41.947
otherwise have gotten the jobs
are going to be harmed as the

00:38:41.947 --> 00:38:45.070
Supreme Court said last year.
 

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:50.369
So Mill's point is you first
make an inquiry.

00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:51.880
Is there a harm?
 

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.677
If the answer's no,
the action's self-regarding and

00:38:54.677 --> 00:38:55.630
it's protected.
 

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.920
Free speech doesn't hurt
anybody.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.539
That's why it's so important to
protect it.

00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:06.449
Indeed, he wants to say the
externalities of free speech are

00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:07.179
positive.
 

00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:08.750
Free speech doesn't hurt
anybody.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:14.460
Drinking doesn't hurt anybody.
 

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.670
Now, some of you might question
that.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:22.036
You might say,
well, if you go to a bar and

00:39:22.036 --> 00:39:27.509
you get paralytically drunk,
and you then get behind the

00:39:27.509 --> 00:39:30.068
wheel of a car,
and you go home and you kill

00:39:30.068 --> 00:39:33.849
somebody,
drinking does harm.

00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:35.440
What do you think Mill would
say to that?

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.250
 
 

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:44.023
I think Mill would say,
"Well, that's a reason to

00:39:44.023 --> 00:39:47.297
penalize drunk driving,
but not drinking,"

00:39:47.297 --> 00:39:48.010
right?
 

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.539
So I think that's what he'd say
to that.

00:39:51.539 --> 00:39:57.139
But, so the first step is you
ask, is there a harm to others?

00:39:57.139 --> 00:40:00.036
If the answer's no,
it's protected by the harm

00:40:00.036 --> 00:40:00.809
principle.
 

00:40:00.809 --> 00:40:04.786
If the answer's yes,
there's a harm to others,

00:40:04.786 --> 00:40:09.735
then you make a utilitarian
calculation as to what's best

00:40:09.735 --> 00:40:11.150
for society.
 

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:16.746
So if there's a harm to others
then you make the utilitarian

00:40:16.746 --> 00:40:23.010
calculation, and that's why it's
important to have good science.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.184
Because when you make the
utilitarian calculation you want

00:40:27.184 --> 00:40:31.577
to bring the best scientific
knowledge to bear on making that

00:40:31.577 --> 00:40:32.750
calculation.
 

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:36.510
He doesn't trust majority
opinion, right?

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.373
He wants to say,
"Free trade is better than

00:40:40.373 --> 00:40:41.690
protectionism.
 

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:46.641
We now know that as a matter of
economic science,"

00:40:46.641 --> 00:40:48.659
when he was writing.
 

00:40:48.659 --> 00:40:52.432
"If somebody could come
along and show that there's

00:40:52.432 --> 00:40:56.617
something other than free trade
that would be even better then

00:40:56.617 --> 00:40:59.018
we would pick that,"
okay?

00:40:59.018 --> 00:41:03.525
So it's not the case that he
wants to say this is infallible

00:41:03.525 --> 00:41:07.829
knowledge or known for all time,
"But, for the moment,

00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:11.443
the best scientific judgment,
when I am writing this book on

00:41:11.443 --> 00:41:13.159
liberty,"
Mill says,

00:41:13.159 --> 00:41:15.909
"is that free trade
maximizes utility."

00:41:15.909 --> 00:41:17.659
So step one, is there a harm?
 

00:41:17.659 --> 00:41:21.610
If no, it's protected.
 

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:25.568
If yes, then you make the
utilitarian calculation,

00:41:25.568 --> 00:41:30.014
and then it's important to have
good science behind you,

00:41:30.014 --> 00:41:32.599
not majority opinion,
right?

00:41:32.599 --> 00:41:38.619
And that's why freedom of
speech is the pathway from

00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:42.869
liberty to utilitarian
efficiency.

00:41:42.869 --> 00:41:50.574
And that's why all good things
go together in Mill's account,

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:59.050
and we can have this hunky-dory
synthesis of rights and utility.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:02.159
Great, right?
 

00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:10.789
Now, we're going to go more
deeply into this question on

00:42:10.789 --> 00:42:15.746
Wednesday,
whether it is all hunky-dory,

00:42:15.746 --> 00:42:20.697
because I've said now,
well, there's a two-step test

00:42:20.697 --> 00:42:23.913
for determining harm,
and that makes sense,

00:42:23.913 --> 00:42:26.780
and it makes the apparent
contradiction go away,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.927
and I think it is the best
reconstruction of what Mill

00:42:29.927 --> 00:42:33.431
wanted to say even though he
could have said it more clearly

00:42:33.431 --> 00:42:35.630
if he had come out and done
that.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:39.029
Nonetheless,
there's still the question of

00:42:39.029 --> 00:42:43.340
who gets to decide what counts
as a relevant harm.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.670
I said you do the first stage,
is there harm?

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:51.181
But just from the little
example I gave of drunken

00:42:51.181 --> 00:42:57.260
driving and drinking you can see
that this might be problematic.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:02.889
One of the things I want you to
think about between now and

00:43:02.889 --> 00:43:08.130
Wednesday, some other examples
such as prostitution.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:11.590
Does that involve harm to
others or not?

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.369
Okay, I don't want to answer
that now.

00:43:14.369 --> 00:43:15.440
Just think about it.
 

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.199
I want to ask you that.
 

00:43:17.199 --> 00:43:22.000

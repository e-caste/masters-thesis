00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.350
- Good morning, everybody.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.575
(students chattering)

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:17.190
So we talked about the
economic demographic

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.180
and social sources of populism last time.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.759
And today, we're gonna zero
in on the political sources

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.610
that interact with them

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.029
and produce the kind of politics

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.353
that we have all been
experiencing since 2016.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.480
- The leaders to the US,
India, China, Australia,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.040
every single one of our allies,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.340
the Bank of England, the
IFS, the IMF, the CBI,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
five former NATO secretary generals,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.230
the chief exec of the NHS,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.690
and most of the leaders of
the trade unions in Britain

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.920
all say that you, Boris,
and Nigel are wrong.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.580
Why should the public trust you over them?

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.970
- I'm not asking the public to trust me.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.880
I'm asking the public to trust themselves.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.950
I'm asking the British public

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.610
to take back control of our destiny

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.860
from those organizations
which are distant,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.060
unaccountable, elitist,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.154
and have their own interests at heart.

00:01:09.154 --> 00:01:10.000
- Elitist, elitist?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.833
- Absolutely, because--

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:13.630
- The Lord High Chancellor
conspiracy of elites.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.103
It sounds like something out of (mumbles).

00:01:15.103 --> 00:01:17.060
- Well, I haven't seen (mumbles),

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.176
but the one thing that I would say

00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:22.090
is that the people who are
backing the remain campaign

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.420
are people who have done
very well, thank you,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.840
out of the European Union,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.213
and the people increasingly--

00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:28.046
(audience applauding)

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:28.879
Absolutely.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:30.846
(audience applauding)

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:34.134
And the people who are
arguing that we should get out

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:35.700
are concerned to ensure

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.200
that the working people of this country

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.670
at last get a fair deal.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.750
I think the people in this
country have had enough

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.150
of experts with
organizations from acronyms--

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.420
- The people of this country
have had enough of experts?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.111
What do you mean by that?

00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:48.944
- From organizations with acronyms

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:50.560
saying that they know what is best

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.193
and getting it consistently wrong.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.700
These people are the same ones

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.210
who've got consistently wrong.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.610
- [Faisal] This is proper
Trump politics, isn't it?

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.713
- No, it's actually a faith in the--

00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:01.453
- It's Oxbridge Trump.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.910
- It's a faith, Faisal,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.650
in the British people to
make the right decision.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.483
- [Faisal] Blind faith.

00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:08.316
- I don't think it is

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:10.548
because one of the striking
things about this debate

00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:13.140
is that those who are
arguing that we should remain

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.480
have a vested financial.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.440
The majority of people in this country

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.010
are suffering as a
result of our membership

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.050
of the European Union.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.020
- What's your factual basis

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.442
saying that the majority
of people in this country

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.351
are suffering from EU membership?

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.790
- Well, I know myself--

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.623
- You don't have it, do you?

00:02:25.623 --> 00:02:28.370
- I know myself from my own background.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.990
I know that the European
Union depresses employment

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.300
and destroys jobs.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.040
- [Faisal] We haven't got a majority.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.510
- My father had a fishing
business in Aberdeen

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.250
destroyed by the European Union

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.610
and the common fisheries policy.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.443
- That's one person.

00:02:41.443 --> 00:02:43.980
- The European Union has
hollowed out communities

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.197
across this country

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:46.660
and it has also contributed

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.100
to lower salaries for working people

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.360
and it has also ensured that
young people in this country

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.470
don't have the opportunities
to get the entry level job.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.110
You're on the side, Faisal, of the elites.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.095
I'm on the side of the people.

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:02.383
(audience applauding)

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:04.216
- You said a majority,

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.430
you, the Lord High Chancellor

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.630
said a majority of the British public

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.463
were suffering from the EU.

00:03:11.463 --> 00:03:15.140
You have no factual evidence
for that whatsoever.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.460
- Let me give you a fact.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.887
- [Faisal] No, you don't
have any evidence for it.

00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:18.720
- Yes, I do.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.487
Because every year,

00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:23.490
we give billions of pounds
to the European Union,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.870
billions of pounds that we
should be spending here.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.718
- Well, let's have a fact.

00:03:26.718 --> 00:03:28.030
There's been a fact on
the side of your bus

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.050
in one meter tall letters,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.883
and let me quote,

00:03:30.883 --> 00:03:35.867
"We send 350 million pounds
to Brussels every week.

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:38.130
"Let's fund the NHS instead."

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.469
Which week was it

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.840
that we sent 350 million
pounds to Brussels?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.800
Was it this week, last week,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.440
was it Christmas week, Easter week?

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.273
Which week?

00:03:49.273 --> 00:03:50.106
- Every week,

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:52.815
we send actually more than 350
million pounds to Brussels.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.980
- [Faisal] It comes out of
a bank account in Britain

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.120
and goes to Brussels.
- Yes it does.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.610
- Does it literally leave the country?

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.483
Does it leave the country?

00:03:58.483 --> 00:03:59.316
- And then we get some of it back

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:00.544
and we do get some of it back.

00:04:00.544 --> 00:04:01.740
- You know it doesn't leave the country.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.770
And you (mumbles) to me,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.960
UK Stats Authority say
the figure's misleading.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.870
The Treasury Select Committee
containing Brexiteers

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.370
says it's deeply problematic.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.340
One of your own backbench colleagues,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.490
a conservative MP who's
campaigning to leave,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.500
is a respected doctor,
refuses to hand out leaflets

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.319
because he say you're
treating the public as fools.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.590
(audience applauding)

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.150
- So that was a video that went viral

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.010
because of Michael Gove's declaration

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.343
that the British people
are tired of experts.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.440
It was shortly before the referendum

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.950
that was held later that month.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.820
I chose to start with that

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.820
because like the Tea Party
videos I started with on Tuesday,

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:50.545
it contains all the four
elements of in this case,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.750
British populism,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.720
but astonishingly similar,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.080
you might realize on a little reflection

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.010
to the four elements of American populism

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.660
that we were talking about last time,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.020
namely the anti-elitism,

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.428
the conspiracy theories,

00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:12.852
the hostility to taxes and government,

00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:15.160
and though not racist,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.330
this hostility to foreigners,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.950
this kind of xenophobic declaration

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.950
that foreigners are hollowing
out the labor market,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.450
taking jobs, destroying
the British economy.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.800
And so I start with this
just to make the point

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.800
that while we spent all of our
focus on the US last Tuesday,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.606
we're talking about a much
more general phenomenon

00:05:42.606 --> 00:05:45.320
and that's what's gonna concern us today.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.050
We'll have much less to say about the US,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.740
although the three remaining lectures

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.920
are gonna be very centrally
focused on the US.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.170
Today's agenda is to answer this question:

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.468
what is it about democratic
political systems

00:06:01.468 --> 00:06:05.700
that has fostered the
resurgence of populist politics?

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.440
And our answer's gonna differ
from much of what you read

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.350
in that I'm gonna shift the focus away

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.280
from exclusive attention to
voters and voting behavior

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.550
and instead also include
attention to the incentives

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.190
and motivations of politicians.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.343
If you wanted a bumper
sticker for this lecture.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.790
I talked about the Tea Party narrative

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.790
that Arlie Hochschild
so cleverly portrayed

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.110
with the cutting in comments

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.890
that she made in that clip.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.530
I said that that had become weaponized

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.200
unlike many of the other narratives

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.418
in around the questions of
race in American politics

00:06:52.418 --> 00:06:56.150
that I gave you some flavor of.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.140
But any time a social scientist

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.470
starts talking in the passive voice,

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.530
you should get nervous.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.900
Become weaponized?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.798
How did it become weaponized?

00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:08.321
Just as people constantly talk about

00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:11.789
our politics has become polarized,

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:16.510
but again, weaponization of, and populism,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.640
and polarized politics
don't fall out of the sky

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.310
and we need to think about who it is

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.310
that is mobilizing people
to vote in a particular way.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.690
It's not as if 63 million Americans

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.137
were sitting around saying,

00:07:32.137 --> 00:07:33.947
"If only somebody would come along

00:07:33.947 --> 00:07:36.167
"and propose building a wall."

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.230
That's not how mobilization
works in politics.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.230
Politicians see opportunities
to mobilize voters

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.290
in certain ways rather than
others and then use them.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.450
So this lecture's gonna
be very much more focused

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.225
on the incentives confronting politicians,

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.568
how those incentives have changed,

00:07:57.568 --> 00:08:01.020
and how that has shaped the politics

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.090
that we're experiencing.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.540
I just am gonna be very centrally focused

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.210
on the political system today,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.250
but we shouldn't lose sight
of the broader content

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.283
that we've talked about
several times in the course.

00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:18.240
The impact of globalization, technology,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.390
and slow growth on middle class incomes

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.300
and working class incomes.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.010
The aging populations in all
of the developed countries

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.930
that put more and more
pressure on fiscal states

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.346
as the working age population

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:35.405
that's supporting retired populations

00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:39.346
is getting relatively smaller and smaller,

00:08:39.346 --> 00:08:42.800
and the collapse of the
corporatist consensus

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.650
between business and labor

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.130
that underpinned the social
democratic welfare states

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.530
in the early postwar period

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.470
largely as a result of the
collapse of organized labor.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.700
These are all themes from
earlier in the course

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.980
that we should have in
the back of our minds.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.960
What I want to say about them today

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.294
is that all of those things
make it much harder to govern

00:09:06.294 --> 00:09:10.682
and it leads voters often
to demand political reforms

00:09:10.682 --> 00:09:13.770
and to the rise of anti-system parties

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.930
or anti-system groups
within political parties.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.766
And that in turn creates the
risk of what I'm gonna call

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:25.200
the political equivalent of bloodletting,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.502
namely fixing things that were not broken

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:32.672
in ways that actually
make the situation worse.

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:35.497
And we will see particularly
how this has played out

00:09:35.497 --> 00:09:39.130
in the United Kingdom since the 1970s.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.266
The pressure to reform the
British political system

00:09:42.266 --> 00:09:44.673
ramped up in the 1970s.

00:09:44.673 --> 00:09:46.940
A very important book by Anthony King,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.940
unfortunately now deceased,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.070
called "The British
Constitution" points out

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.930
that apart from the war decades,

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.590
the 1970s were one of the
most difficult decades

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.920
in British economics.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.400
It was the three day week,
it was the oil shock.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.970
Britain was actually forced
even to go to the IMF

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.365
and be bailed out.

00:10:09.365 --> 00:10:13.960
And that caused a lot of people
to demand political reforms

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.350
even though actually the problems

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.110
that Britain was experiencing

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.124
had nothing to do with
the political system.

00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:22.490
But they reformed the system

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.114
in ways that have hamstrung its ability

00:10:26.114 --> 00:10:30.700
to confront many of Britain's problems.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.700
So the central questions I'm
gonna zero in on this lecture

00:10:35.764 --> 00:10:37.670
are how do the number

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.330
and nature of political
parties affect politics

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.210
and there, I'm gonna be interested in

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.020
when I talk about number two party systems

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.340
versus multiparty systems.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.120
And when I talk about the
nature of political parties,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.797
I'm gonna be talking about weak parties

00:10:55.797 --> 00:10:58.080
versus strong parties

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.080
and I'll say more about what I mean

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.872
by weak and strong as we move along.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.850
And then the second question is

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.167
I'm gonna look at what
are the implications

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:11.990
of this for the economy and society?

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.359
How does it affect?

00:11:13.359 --> 00:11:15.500
How do these phenomena,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.750
the number of parties

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.940
and the strength of parties
affect labor markets,

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.437
corruption, the propensity
for corruption, and growth,

00:11:23.437 --> 00:11:27.180
and also how do they affect the likelihood

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.450
that we're gonna see populist politics.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.170
That's out agenda.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.250
So just for people who like tables,

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.560
here's a two by two.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.560
If we think of two party systems,

00:11:42.215 --> 00:11:47.215
the classic strong two party
system would be the UK system

00:11:48.286 --> 00:11:50.590
before they started messing it up

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.130
in the 1970s and subsequently.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.820
So I'll have a lot to say about that

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.820
and then weak two party
systems would be the US system.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.750
We have very weak political parties

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.553
in ways that I will elaborate on.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.360
Western Europe has traditionally

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.370
had strong multiparty systems

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.930
although they've also been
weakened in recent years.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.433
And in much of Eastern Europe,

00:12:24.737 --> 00:12:27.900
in France and much of Latin America,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.440
we have multiple parties
that are also weak parties.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.360
Israel also fits into that box.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.040
To some extent, we'll see
these if you like ideal types

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.663
and many actual political
systems are hybrids,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.977
but nonetheless, the center of gravity

00:12:47.977 --> 00:12:50.320
is what I'll be talking about

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.260
when I think about these
different possibilities.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.450
Now, I'm talking about political parties.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.260
Well, what is a political party?

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.746
How do we know one when we trip over it?

00:13:02.746 --> 00:13:05.540
So here's one famous classical definition

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.260
that Burke came up with
in the 18th century.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.980
He said a political
party is a body of men,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.500
as they then were,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.010
united for promoting by
their joint endeavors

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.040
the national interest upon
some particular principle

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.713
in which they're all agreed.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.370
It's kind of a verbose mouthful.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.240
More simply put,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.710
you can say that parties
promote what I'm gonna call

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.060
partisan conceptions
of the public interest.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.037
They're partisan in that they
come from a point of view,

00:13:39.037 --> 00:13:40.730
but they are declared

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.960
to be conceptions of the public interest,

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.370
not of a private interest
or a sectional interest.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.390
So if you remember when Mitt Romney

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.618
got caught on a microphone

00:13:51.618 --> 00:13:55.210
I guess in what he thought
was a private meeting

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.493
saying that he represented only,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.040
he could only aspire to represent 53%

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.130
because 47% were the takers
and we're the makers.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.900
It was a politically
disastrous thing for him

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.990
because you can't say that.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.290
Politicians are gonna say
the American people want,

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.220
the American people need.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.020
I'm gonna represent all
of the American people.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.320
So this is the idea of a
conception of the public interest

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.150
even though he comes from
a partisan point of view

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.250
and I'll unpack what I mean by partisan.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.370
More of that later.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.090
But let's start by two party systems

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.503
versus multiparty systems.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.603
Now, what is it that determines

00:14:38.603 --> 00:14:41.610
whether you get two
parties or lots of parties?

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.620
It's the electoral system
and there's something

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.320
that political scientists
call Duverger's Law.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.210
And so Duverger's Law,

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.550
this is a rather impenetrable mumbo jumbo.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.865
It says single member
plurality systems, SMP.

00:14:57.865 --> 00:15:01.430
That's like we have and
like they have in the UK,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.290
systems in which all you need

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.427
is the most votes in a
district to win the seat.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.420
They will tend to produce two parties.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.480
And indeed, his formula he says

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.310
is district magnitude plus one.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.020
So district magnitude
means the number of people

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.100
getting elected from a district.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:28.100
So district magnitude in
the US or the UK is one

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.960
and plus one, you're gonna
get a two party system.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.960
All else equal, but need
to unpack all else equal.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.260
That assumes that most districts

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.370
are gonna be like most other districts.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.220
Or if you'd like to put it
in more technical terms,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.590
that the median voter in a district

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.155
is pretty much gonna be the
median voter in the country.

00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:56.730
So every district looks more or less

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.940
like every other district in
its political composition.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.300
If that's not true as in India

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.960
where there's big regional variation,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.950
then you'll get more parties.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.340
So even though in India,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.473
they have single member district systems,

00:16:11.473 --> 00:16:15.240
they nonetheless have more parties.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.070
Or in the UK for instance,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.530
you have regional variations

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.310
so you can get the Scottish
nationalists in Scotland.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.100
But for the most part,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.990
if you have big diverse districts

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.260
that are more or less like one another,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.640
you're gonna get two parties

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.500
out of single member plurality systems.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.760
Whereas if you have
proportional representation

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.430
and this is if in the limiting case,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.260
in pure PR as say in Israel,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.630
if you get 60% of the vote,
you get 60% of the seats.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.510
Your party gets 30% of the vote,

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.007
it gets 30% of the seats.

00:16:55.007 --> 00:16:57.738
Then you will get lots of parties,

00:16:57.738 --> 00:17:00.910
other things being equal again.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.010
So for instance, you can
reduce the number of parties

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.160
in a PR system by putting in a threshold.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.950
So in Germany, there's a 5% threshold.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.690
Parties that fall below 5%

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.403
don't get any seats in the parliament.

00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:19.210
So that's one way in which

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.960
you can make a multiparty system

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.993
function more like a two party system.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.940
Another way in which you
could make a two party system

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.280
function more like a multiparty system

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.360
is by having multiple rounds.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.590
So in France, they have a
first round and a second round.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.870
So even though they have

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.973
single member district
system at the moment.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.930
The French change their system so often

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.420
that it's hard to keep track of it.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.253
But at the moment,

00:17:45.253 --> 00:17:47.640
they have single member district system.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.510
They're beaten only by the Italians

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.923
for changing their electoral
system every five minutes.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.140
So in France currently,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.580
they have single member districts,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.890
but because they have two rounds,

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.379
the small parties stay
in in the first round

00:18:02.379 --> 00:18:06.842
in order to then essentially
extract rents or benefits

00:18:06.842 --> 00:18:09.800
for supporting bigger
parties in the latter round.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.800
So the two rounds keeps
the small parties alive.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:21.108
There's these variations around the edges,

00:18:21.108 --> 00:18:24.790
but basically, the big
point is if you have PR,

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.850
you're gonna get part
proliferation of parties,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.852
and if you have single member
district systems like we have,

00:18:30.852 --> 00:18:32.650
like the British have,

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.930
like they have in Canada,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.100
although again, regional variation

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.570
produces the different
outcome with the Quebecois,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.940
but basically, single member district's

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.930
gonna produce two party systems.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:46.763
Okay.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.210
Now, there's one big debate
about well, which is better?

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.130
Which is fairer?

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.890
Which is more representative?

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.540
And people often say well,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.810
multiparty systems are
much more representative

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.653
in the sense that if you think
about a multiparty system,

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.330
the greens get their party in parliament,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.120
and the social democrats get
their party in parliament,

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.110
the libertarians get
their party in parliament,

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.180
the anti-immigrant people get
their party in parliament,

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.480
everybody gets a seat at the table

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.100
and so it's more representative.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.390
And in that sense,

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.620
multiparty systems are
often defended as fairer

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.450
because they are more representative.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.000
And the British liberal
party endlessly complains

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.570
that they get very few seats

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.630
and if Britain had PR,
they would do much better,

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.160
and they've tried to at least.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.260
They only took this view
once they lost power

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.200
at the beginning of the 20th century.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.470
Before that, they were
strongly opposed to PR,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.890
but now, they see that
it would benefit them.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.850
One important caution though

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.620
is we shouldn't conflate
the electoral stage

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.800
with the government formation
stage in a political system.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.156
So if you think about,

00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:11.059
we think about the 2015
elections in Greece,

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:14.103
that was the outcome of the election.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.600
All the different
parties were represented,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.763
but that was the government that formed

00:20:19.763 --> 00:20:23.083
with a far left party
and a far right party.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.395
So the people who voted
for all these other parties

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:32.035
were unrepresented in
the government, right?

00:20:32.035 --> 00:20:33.390
And so you could say

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.800
it's more representative
at the electoral stage,

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.430
but not more represented at
the government formation stage.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.360
Three years later,

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.870
the Italian electrons
produced a comparable result.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.700
Again, you've got a far left
party and a far right party.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.700
And as I mentioned to you
in our very first lecture,

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.513
in Germany in 2017,

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.777
they had had a grand
coalition between the SPD

00:21:00.777 --> 00:21:04.006
and the CDU prior to that.

00:21:04.006 --> 00:21:07.500
The election result was such

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.377
that the social democrats said,

00:21:10.377 --> 00:21:12.337
"We're sick of being in this coalition

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:14.197
"which we get damaged by

00:21:14.197 --> 00:21:16.127
"'cause of all the
concessions we have to make

00:21:16.127 --> 00:21:17.650
"to be in the government."

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.263
And so they didn't want to join

00:21:19.263 --> 00:21:22.958
and Merkel spent six months
trying to put together

00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:25.920
a coalition between the free democrats

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.860
who were sort of like libertarians,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.770
sort of Rand Paul type libertarians,

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.100
and the greens who are for
environmental regulation.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.440
Not surprisingly, she failed

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.760
because they want no regulation

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.530
and they want green regulations

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.290
so there's not much of
an intersecting thet.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.866
And during those six months,

00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:51.190
all the polling showed that
the alternative for Deutschland

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.960
was gonna do even better if
they went to another election.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.960
So finally, they put back
together the grand coalition.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.980
So when we're thinking about,

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.300
this is really something of a trade off

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.260
between increasing accountability

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.250
and representativeness
at the electoral stage

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.698
which might come at the
expense of accountability

00:22:16.698 --> 00:22:18.920
of actual governments,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.560
and that, I'm gonna dig
into a little more deeply.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.330
Now, one of the objections

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.610
that people make to two party systems

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.500
is the Tweedledee Tweedledum problem.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.260
And the Tweedledee Tweedledum problem

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.240
or as I put it here, the
Tweedledum Tweedledee problem

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.500
which is the mirror image

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.525
of the Tweedledee Tweedledum problem,

00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:41.696
(students laughing)

00:22:41.696 --> 00:22:45.950
is basically that politicians
in a two party system

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.350
are chasing the median voter.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.903
So if you think about it this way,

00:22:53.052 --> 00:22:57.520
if the right of center
party went over here

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.460
where I've got that B on the slide,

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.527
the center to the left,

00:23:02.527 --> 00:23:06.720
the party to the left would move toward it

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.300
to pick up a lot of votes, right?

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.773
So if you think about 1964 in the US,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:20.560
Barry Goldwater has a very
conservative platform.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.660
And the result is Lyndon
Johnson wins a massive victory.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.670
So you can't do that if you want to win.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.253
The parties are gonna head for the middle.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.300
But then if they do that,

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.130
both parties are gonna be
offering the same policies, right?

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.230
This just follows almost definitionally.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.140
They might get it wrong, right?

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.830
So Goldwater maybe thought he
was close to the median voter

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.080
and when Ronald Reagan ran in 1980

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.720
on more or less than same program,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.517
everybody said, "What an idiot,"

00:23:57.517 --> 00:24:00.090
"we saw what happened to Barry Goldwater."

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.290
But whether it was
Reagan's brilliant strategy

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:08.290
or blind staggering luck or some mix,

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:12.650
the median voter had moved
and so Reagan could prevail.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.426
But generally speaking,

00:24:14.426 --> 00:24:17.410
all of the incentives for politicians

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.470
which is what I'm focusing on here

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.800
are to head for the middle
in a two party system.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.767
And so then people say,

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:28.330
"But voters are not gonna get a choice."

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.900
If two parties are basically,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.840
especially if they have
very sophisticated polling

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.100
and they learn about
where the median voter is.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.903
It's much better now than it was in 1964.

00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:42.500
It's gonna be a problem

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.970
from the point of view
of giving voters choice.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.326
So that is true up to a point.

00:24:48.326 --> 00:24:50.970
So if you think about Britain,

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.600
National Health Service
put in by Clement Attlee

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.830
in the postwar labor government in 1946.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:02.356
Comes into operation over
the next couple of years.

00:25:02.356 --> 00:25:05.810
Hugely popular in British politics.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.093
It's bulletproof.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.700
If you look at polling

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.450
on the most popular
institutions in Britain,

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.890
it's more popular than the
second most popular institution

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.323
which is the Queen.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.150
And this means that the
National Health Service

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.210
really is bulletproof.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.140
People want to keep it.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.990
And so even in Margaret Thatcher's

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.510
rolling back the welfare
state in the 1980s,

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.560
she couldn't dismantle the
National Health Service.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.650
Of course, there'll be
squabbling at the margins

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.340
about funding, and coverage,
and this sort of thing,

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.695
but basically, it's there to stay

00:25:43.695 --> 00:25:48.695
because the median voter has
an intense attachment to it.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.900
Not everything's like that.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.160
So if you think about nationalizing

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.530
and denationalizing British Rail,

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.620
that has occurred three times

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.260
and if Jeremy Corbyn comes into office,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.248
they might renationalize British Rail.

00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:10.467
Similarly, in the US,
think about social security

00:26:10.467 --> 00:26:12.620
brought in by FDR,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.220
I talked about this last time, in 1935.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.850
And Medicare insurance for people over 65

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.300
brought in by Lyndon Johnson

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.280
as part of the great society in 1965,

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.130
these are also bulletproof,

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.290
hugely popular with the median voter,

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.490
basically bulletproof.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.350
But again, not everything is like that.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:41.000
So if you think about how
to respond in a recession,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.670
your left of center parties

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.260
are gonna generally push
for deficit spending.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.270
They have Keynesian outlooks

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.300
and think that the problem
is insufficient demand

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.430
and there's gotta be a demand-led return

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.770
to revive the economy.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.503
Whereas supply side is on the right.

00:26:57.503 --> 00:26:58.900
They're gonna say no,

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.630
what we need in recessions are tax cuts.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.030
And so you're gonna get

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:08.030
very divergent responses to recessions.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.530
Or if you think about
protections for labor,

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.300
the Wagner Act I've mentioned before

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.467
put in place by FDR in 1935

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.530
was the strongest protections

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.550
for unions in American history.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.180
By 1947 when the republicans

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.943
were back in control of congress,

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.200
they repealed the guts of
it over Harry Truman's veto.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.950
That means they had 2/3's
in both houses to do that,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.920
greatly weakening the Wagner Act.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.470
Or more recently if you think
about the Dodd-Frank law

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.670
which we've discussed a little bit,

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.730
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.180
put in as part of that law

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.790
has since been savaged, and weakened,

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.140
and might be completely dismantled

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.870
by the Trump Administration and
the republicans in congress.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.660
So that's what I mean

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.030
by a partisan conception
of the public interest.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.820
Go back to the beginning of the lecture.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.490
So this is one partisan
conception of the public interest

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.730
and this is another

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.560
partisan conception of
the public interest.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.400
There will be some overlap,

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.607
so some Tweedledee's Tweedledum,

00:28:25.607 --> 00:28:27.260
but there will be a lot of areas

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.803
where in fact there's divergence,

00:28:29.803 --> 00:28:32.223
partly for ideological reasons,

00:28:32.223 --> 00:28:35.250
partly because people don't actually know

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.533
what the best way is to
respond to a recession,

00:28:41.725 --> 00:28:46.010
and partly perhaps for
other reasons as well.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.380
And so while their Tweedledee Tweedledum

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.300
is an issue to some extent,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.164
we should notice that for the most part,

00:28:55.164 --> 00:28:58.973
you do get significant divergence.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.437
Now, some people say,

00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:04.270
"Well,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.505
"the electoral system doesn't
really matter that much."

00:29:06.505 --> 00:29:09.200
All the stuff I'm going on about,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.480
there's less to this than meets the eye

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.004
because if you think
about a two party system,

00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.450
it's about big tent parties.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.610
They've got lots of
different interests in.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.370
Basically, they've put
together a coalition

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.900
before the election.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.930
Multiparty systems put
together the coalition

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.960
after the election.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.329
What's the big difference?

00:29:30.329 --> 00:29:34.790
They're more or less gonna
turn out to be the same.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.470
So we shouldn't really get
this hot under the collar

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.280
about the differences.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.386
I think that that is
fundamentally misguided

00:29:43.386 --> 00:29:45.450
and there are five reasons

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.770
and I'm gonna work my way through them

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.270
why particularly when we
focus on the incentives

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.263
created for politicians,

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.420
the differences matter
and they matter in ways

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.290
that are relevant to our larger concern.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.487
And the differences all
come down to the fact

00:30:05.487 --> 00:30:07.940
that in two party systems,

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.980
it's winner take all and loser lose all.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.810
And that creates a fundamentally

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.973
different dynamic for politicians.

00:30:17.997 --> 00:30:22.480
So I'm gonna start by again,

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.180
this is mumbo jumbo,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.620
but I will unpack it into
common sense terminology

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.860
in a minute.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.339
It's that in two party systems,

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:34.720
politicians have an incentive

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.470
to internalize the costs of
the deals that they make.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.433
So let me explain what I mean by this.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.990
Let's suppose I in a two party systems

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.280
am in charge of strategy for the party

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.280
that's to the left of center
in the diagram I just did.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.990
And who's a right wing?

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.250
Steve Wisener over
there is a right winger.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.300
He's in charge of strategy

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.330
for the right of center party, okay?

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:09.330
So Steve and I both know
that if I lose, he wins,

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.310
if he loses, I win, right?

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.390
And everything, can gain
control of everything.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.602
And so it's very important to both of us

00:31:18.602 --> 00:31:21.925
not to leave any voters on the table

00:31:21.925 --> 00:31:24.720
that we might be able to get

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.330
because that one last voter
you leave on the table

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.500
might be the difference

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.180
between winning everything
and losing everything, okay?

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.046
So now think about in a multiparty system.

00:31:36.046 --> 00:31:38.010
After an election,

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.610
maybe the big like Germany grand coalition

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.720
which often happens.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.980
The big labor party

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.853
and the big business party
are forming a coalition.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.090
What does business want?

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.410
Business wants industrial peace,

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.680
predictability, no strikes.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.000
What does labor want?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.920
They want protection of worker's wages,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.760
protection of their members.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.435
So they might make an agreement

00:32:03.435 --> 00:32:06.030
that gives both parties those things

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.740
while externalizing the
costs of that agreement

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.527
onto others like higher
prices for consumers, right?

00:32:16.086 --> 00:32:19.610
Or if you think about an agrarian party,

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.480
thinking of joining a coalition.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.520
What does the agrarian party wants?

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.550
It wants protectionism,

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.379
it wants price supports
for agriculture, right?

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:31.480
And they make that the condition

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.689
of joining a coalition, right?

00:32:33.689 --> 00:32:37.370
But that might produce higher food prices

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:39.630
for the rest of the population.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.470
But the election's already over.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.159
Nobody's worried about that,

00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:45.863
so they'll externalize the costs

00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:48.200
of the deals that they're making.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.350
When Steve and I are
confronting one another

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:52.040
before an election,

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.070
we have to worry

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:58.070
that if we are seen as
responsible for inflation

00:33:00.126 --> 00:33:04.093
or advocating policies that
are gonna produce inflation,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.300
then the other party's gonna win.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:13.240
So we both have incentives to
make the deals we have to make

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.950
to put together our party

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:19.040
without externalizing cost
any more than we have to.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.220
We have to worry about

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.430
what Americans like to call swing voters.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.407
We will satisfy our core
constituencies in ways

00:33:26.407 --> 00:33:30.670
that imposes few costs as
possible on swing voters.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.140
That's the basic incentive.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.980
So that's an important distinction.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.198
Then secondly, when we do that,

00:33:38.198 --> 00:33:42.120
we're gonna have to
worry about I put it here

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.730
and I mentioned this earlier

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.772
when we talked about referendums

00:33:47.772 --> 00:33:51.030
during the lecture on
the anti-tax movement,

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.420
but I'll just come back

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.680
to the analytical core of the point there,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.133
is that when we put together a platform,

00:33:59.133 --> 00:34:02.890
we have to bundle a lot of
policies together, right?

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.970
Policies on abortion,
policies on education,

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.250
policies on spending.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.780
We have to bundle all of these things

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.888
because voters are getting a choice.

00:34:11.888 --> 00:34:15.700
Essentially, you're forcing
it down to one dimension

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.080
and you've gotta push everything together.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.616
And when you do that,

00:34:19.616 --> 00:34:22.360
you have to discount
everything you propose

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.000
by everything else you propose.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.241
The example I gave you
earlier just to remind you

00:34:27.241 --> 00:34:29.287
is if you ask Americans,

00:34:29.287 --> 00:34:32.966
"Would you like to get
rid of the estate tax

00:34:32.966 --> 00:34:35.070
"which almost nobody pays?"

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.404
You can get 70% to say yes,

00:34:37.404 --> 00:34:38.866
but if you say,

00:34:38.866 --> 00:34:41.867
"Would you like to get
rid of the estate tax

00:34:41.867 --> 00:34:43.787
"if that also meant getting rid

00:34:43.787 --> 00:34:46.270
"of prescription drug
benefits for seniors?"

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.630
then you get majority saying, "No."

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.054
So in the second case,

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:52.250
they're bundling their preference

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.180
or discounting their
preference for a tax cut

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.360
by their preference

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.860
for keeping prescription
drug benefits for seniors.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.820
So that's what parties do.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.825
They bundle together lots of issues,

00:35:05.825 --> 00:35:08.010
but they've go to do the discounting.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.430
Steve and I both have to worry
about doing the discounting

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.920
of all these issues against each other

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.920
in ways that will alienate
as few voters as possible

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:22.530
because of the winner
take all character of it.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.525
In a multiparty system,
it doesn't work like that.

00:35:25.525 --> 00:35:28.680
If you're a representative
of the green party,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.513
you're just gonna say,

00:35:29.513 --> 00:35:30.897
"I'm gonna go hell for leather

00:35:30.897 --> 00:35:33.347
"for green legislation if I get elected,

00:35:33.347 --> 00:35:35.440
"if our party gets elected," right?

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.170
You're essentially only
appealing to your core voters

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.550
and the more fragmented a system gets,

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.270
the more parties you get,

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.080
the more they're gonna be like that.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.420
All your voters are sort of

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.179
gonna be like primary voters in the US.

00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:54.310
I have more to say about
primary voters later.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.280
And often, you'll have parties

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.010
that only have a single raison d'etre

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.510
like the green party has
a single raison d'etre.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:04.580
Anti-immigrant parties have
a single raison d'etre.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.070
The religious parties in Israel
have a single raison d'etre.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.080
So they're just going
to try to, if you like,

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.510
turn out their base

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.830
because they know they're
not really gonna appeal

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:19.253
to many other constituencies.

00:36:19.253 --> 00:36:24.253
And so they are not gonna
do this kind of bundling

00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:28.410
and discounting of the things
that are important to them

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:34.480
with the things that are
important to others born in mind.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:39.673
And you can see this by taking
a third analytical comparison

00:36:43.886 --> 00:36:45.296
that I put up here

00:36:45.296 --> 00:36:49.825
of two types of arbitration
and industrial disputes.

00:36:49.825 --> 00:36:52.927
So if you have industrial disputes,

00:36:52.927 --> 00:36:56.964
management and labor
can't agree on a contract,

00:36:56.964 --> 00:36:59.080
sometimes there'll be a provision,

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.560
okay, we'll go to arbitration.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.910
We'll let a third party decide.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.713
And when you do that,

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.590
typically what happens is
management takes their position,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.430
the unions take their position,

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.840
the arbitrator comes
in, does fact finding,

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.840
and picks the solution, usually
some form of compromise.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.270
Of course, everybody
knows that's gonna happen

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.640
and so because they know
that that's gonna happen,

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.300
they behave strategically.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.810
So the management might take
a much more extreme position

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.730
than it really believes in.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.750
As well, the union.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:40.330
Just like a store putting up their prices

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:43.060
later to put them down and
say they're having a sale

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.613
so that when the compromise is made,

00:37:46.613 --> 00:37:48.990
they hope it'll get somewhere closer

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.690
to what they really want.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.790
There's a different kind of arbitration

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.660
called last best offer arbitration.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.920
And last better offer
arbitration works like this.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.930
Management takes their position,

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.881
the union takes their position,

00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:06.393
the arbitrator has to pick one.

00:38:07.562 --> 00:38:11.050
There's no fact finding, no compromise.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.297
The arbitrator has to pick one.

00:38:14.297 --> 00:38:17.080
And you won't have to think
about this for very long

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.398
to realize that in last
best offer arbitration,

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:24.030
people tend not to behave strategically

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.670
and tend not to take extreme positions

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.480
because of the fear that if you do that,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.800
the arbitrator will pick the other side.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.680
So people tend to be reasonable,

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.940
they tend to converge,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.866
they head toward their sincere
preferences, if you like,

00:38:38.866 --> 00:38:42.160
and they head toward the middle.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.930
Well, two party competition

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:48.589
is much more like last
best offer arbitration

00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:52.360
because the voter is
essentially put in the position

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.360
of being that last best
offer arbitrator, right?

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.350
So Steve has to put together a platform

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.130
and I have to put together a platform

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:07.130
which we think that last best offer,

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.530
that median voter in the
position of political analog

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.030
of the last best offer
arbitrator will choose.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.445
Whereas if you think
about multiparty systems,

00:39:18.445 --> 00:39:23.257
again, the big incentive
is to create a surplus

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.022
to give away during the negotiations.

00:39:27.022 --> 00:39:30.252
So you can say, "Well, I've
made all these compromises,"

00:39:30.252 --> 00:39:35.252
and so you're gonna get a
lot more strategic behavior

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:38.079
and you're gonna have parties

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:42.373
making very different kinds of deals

00:39:42.373 --> 00:39:46.620
based upon the positions that they take.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.950
And so if you want parties
to put together programs

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.914
that appeal to as many voters as possible,

00:39:54.914 --> 00:39:58.410
what we sometimes call
programmatic policies,

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.070
you want policies that are gonna serve

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.263
the interests of the
largest number of voters,

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.470
you're more likely to get
that out of a two party system

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.490
than out of a multiparty system

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:13.737
where coalitions are gonna be
put together in the short run

00:40:13.737 --> 00:40:18.737
to protect the members of the
coalition for that government,

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.630
but nobody, as we'll see,

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.163
is thinking much about the future.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.518
Another difference that's
important to notice

00:40:29.518 --> 00:40:31.920
has to do with opposition.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.350
If Steve gets it right and I get it wrong,

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.170
I go into opposition.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:39.760
And then I will spend my
time attacking his government

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.557
and telling voters, "Vote them out.

00:40:41.557 --> 00:40:43.520
"Put us in and you'll
know what you'll get."

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.620
And we put together the
alternative program.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.500
In a multiparty system,

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.190
you have no idea what will happen

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.580
if you kick out the government

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.021
because you don't know X and T

00:40:55.021 --> 00:40:59.273
what coalition is gonna be
formed next time around, right?

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:07.535
Just think back to the Germany
example I started with.

00:41:07.535 --> 00:41:11.030
Had Merkel managed to put
together the coalition

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:14.363
with the greens and the free democrats,

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.233
then the SPD, you'd have
a centrist opposition.

00:41:20.785 --> 00:41:24.940
And now that you've got a grand coalition,

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.310
you've got splinted opposition
of very disparate parties

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.640
lobbing their different
grenades at the government,

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.330
but nobody knows what will
happen after the next election

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.020
and what sort of
government might be formed.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.960
So voters have no idea

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.170
what the alternative to the
current government actually is.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:50.170
And so again, it's a feature
of multiparty government.

00:41:50.749 --> 00:41:53.220
Or to put it another way,

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.913
in a two party system,

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.220
parties are sort of like marriages.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.600
Of course, sometimes people get divorced,

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.260
but people don't marry
intending to get divorced.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.020
They intend to stay together

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.050
and to be seen as a family,

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.700
and to have certain characteristics,

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.520
and to plan to exist for the long run.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.240
Parties are just the same.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.810
Occasionally, they fall apart.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:21.450
The wigs fell apart in
the 1850s in the US.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.200
The liberal party collapsed

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.160
in the first decade of the
20th century in the UK.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.890
But for the most part,

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:32.110
parties expect to be
together over the long run

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:36.260
to think therefore about
policies for the long run

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.430
and so on.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.260
Multiparty governments are
more like hook ups, right?

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.730
This is cool for me
right now, but who knows?

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.198
All bets are off about the future.

00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:50.680
The future will take care of itself.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.214
And so again, if you want governments

00:42:53.214 --> 00:42:58.214
that are going to invest in
policies for the long run,

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.600
it's more likely that you're
gonna get such governments

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:05.290
when you have two party systems

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.203
rather than multiparty systems.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:11.540
So for all of these reasons,

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:16.540
it's mistaken to think that
there's nothing at stake here.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:20.900
And if you want to think about
what will make it more likely

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:25.900
that politicians will develop
policies for the longer run,

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.490
you're more likely to get
that out of two party systems

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:33.280
than out of multiparty systems.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:37.870
And the more fragmented that
the multiparty systems become,

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:39.220
the more difficult

00:43:40.649 --> 00:43:44.913
or the more pronounced these
disadvantages are going to be.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.053
So let's talk a little bit about
strong versus weak parties.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.830
So this is the second
dimension of the two by two

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.360
with which I began.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.360
Now, an important feature
of political parties

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.253
that often goes unnoticed,

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:07.840
and I haven't mentioned yet,

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.230
but I want to bring it to your attention

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:15.230
is that they're very unusual
institutional creatures

00:44:15.696 --> 00:44:18.276
in that nobody owns them.

00:44:18.276 --> 00:44:20.870
The closest thing there is

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:25.163
is actually a private
university in the US.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.040
So think about Yale.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.123
Who owns Yale?

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:32.950
The truth is nobody owns Yale.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:37.070
If you sold off all of Yale's assets,

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:38.840
as with a firm,

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.430
if you sell off all the assets,

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.670
there's a residual claimant.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:42.580
It's the shareholders.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.303
So if you sold off all
the assets, pay the debts,

00:44:45.303 --> 00:44:49.640
you'd give the residual
claimant is the shareholder.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.664
There is no residual claimant at Yale.

00:44:52.664 --> 00:44:56.560
So if you sold off all of Yale's assets

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.330
and paid off all of its debts,

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:01.453
it's not clear who would be
entitled to the residual.

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.540
And that has the implication

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:09.540
that governance is always controversial.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.130
The faculty think they should govern Yale.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.370
The students think they
should govern Yale.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.750
The alumni think they should govern Yale.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:19.640
The corporation think
they should govern Yale.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.070
The donors think they should govern Yale.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:25.950
Nobody agrees on who should
actually be governing, right?

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.020
Because it's an unknown entity.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.527
There's no analog to the shareholders.

00:45:31.527 --> 00:45:35.760
Political parties have the same feature.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.650
There is no equivalent of a shareholder

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:42.320
or a residual claimant
in a political party.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.060
And so for that reason,

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.107
the governance of political parties

00:45:46.107 --> 00:45:48.720
is endemically controversial.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.770
There's always gonna be fighting

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:53.860
over who should govern political parties.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:58.120
And a lot of what we're
seeing in our current politics

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.840
is because the fighting

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.680
over who should govern political parties

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.390
has tended to come out a certain way.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:09.143
And so that's what I
want to zero in on now.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.450
So, definitions are important.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.570
What is a strong party?

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:16.090
Well, here's one definition

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.763
from an article in World
Politics last year.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.970
A unified, centralized, stable,

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.410
organizationally complex,

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.070
and tied to long standing constituencies.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:29.120
As I said, political scientists

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.140
never saying words of one syllable

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.753
what can be said in
words of five syllables.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.150
I like simple things,

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.530
so I would say a strong party is a party

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:41.430
in which everybody's on the same team.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:45.330
Everybody is trying to
achieve the same goal.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.990
Everybody's pulling in the same direction.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.540
That's what I would think
of as a strong party.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.000
And one feature of that

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.080
would be back benches
choose front benches,

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.960
back benches being what
we call members in the US,

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.260
choose front benches,

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.100
the people running the parties,

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.050
who choose back benches
who choose front benches.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:11.013
And so let me explain
why that's important.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.073
First of all,

00:47:13.073 --> 00:47:17.710
back benches will give front
benches a lot of leeway,

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.775
what I call to discipline them.

00:47:19.775 --> 00:47:23.450
I call it Ulysses and the
Sirens discipline in the sense

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:26.790
that you know the famous story
of Ulysses and the Sirens

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:30.794
is that Ulysses is tempted to do things

00:47:30.794 --> 00:47:32.720
that won't be good for him,

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.420
so he wants to be disciplined, right?

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.830
So the intuition here is

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:42.830
that going back to remembering Steve and I

00:47:43.204 --> 00:47:46.403
facing winner take all, loser lose all,

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:49.750
if our back benches,

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:51.560
if we're the leaders of the party,

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:56.250
they know we both have
incentives to design a platform

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.278
and pick candidates

00:47:58.278 --> 00:48:01.804
for running in the
different constituencies

00:48:01.804 --> 00:48:04.590
that can both win in their districts

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:08.740
and support a national
winning platform, right?

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.640
Whereas if you just focus on
the individual back benches

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.470
or the individual members,

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.610
they're just trying to
survive in their districts.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:19.400
So they might want a very big margins.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.316
If their idiosyncratic
preference is in their district

00:48:23.316 --> 00:48:26.250
that might be unpopular nationally,

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.760
they're gonna focus on those things.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:33.760
So the idea is back benches
will give a lot of leeway

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:37.874
to front benches to discipline them,

00:48:37.874 --> 00:48:41.280
to determine what the platform's gonna be,

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.100
to have a big role in candidate selection,

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.733
but they only have enough
rope to hang themselves.

00:48:50.332 --> 00:48:55.332
One indicator is that we have
very weak political parties

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.450
is that Nancy Pelosi led
the congressional democrats

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:03.700
to four successive defeats
and still stayed there, right?

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.820
Just as with a sports team,

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:10.500
the quarterback or the coach
has a lot of authority,

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.060
but it's conditioned on
delivering victories.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.843
If they don't deliver victories,

00:49:14.843 --> 00:49:17.810
they're gonna be gone very quickly, right?

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.550
So this is the idea.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:22.070
The back benches have a big interest

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:25.380
in delegating authority
to the front benches

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.280
conditional on their delivering victories.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.337
And if they don't,

00:49:29.337 --> 00:49:31.350
they won't survive for very long

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:34.930
because the reason for
delegating the authority

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.553
will have gone away.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.250
Weak parties are parties

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:42.480
in which everyone's in it
for herself or himself.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:47.480
Lots of people worried
about their own survival

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.950
in their own district.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.550
Lots of retail campaigning,
not wholesale campaigning.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.060
This comes back, by the way,

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.828
to our discussion of money in politics.

00:49:58.828 --> 00:50:03.240
Politicians in weak parties
need much more money

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.363
'cause they're all campaigning
for their own survival.

00:50:09.333 --> 00:50:10.877
You'll see a lot of deal cutting.

00:50:10.877 --> 00:50:13.470
It'll make an American system

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.490
look more like a European system.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:21.490
I'll support the unnecessary
military base in your district

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:25.833
if you'll support

00:50:25.833 --> 00:50:28.390
the unnecessary military
base in my district,

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:32.890
what political scientists
call pork barrel spending.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:36.330
You will not see individual members

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:39.843
worried about the national program.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.890
Candidates and platforms will tend

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:46.810
to be controlled from
below or from outside

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.703
by the people who are
funding the candidates.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.890
And so you'll see a situation

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:55.070
where leaders in the legislature

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.160
find it very difficult to set the agenda

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.870
and to whip the back benches
to support their agenda.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:04.705
Again, another symptom of the fact

00:51:04.705 --> 00:51:08.160
that we have very weak parties in the US

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.100
is that when the republicans
were in opposition,

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.530
they voted 71 times, I
believe, to repeal Obamacare,

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.180
but when they came into office,

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.390
they couldn't do it.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.770
The leadership couldn't
whip the back benches

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:26.020
to support the program of repeal

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:30.750
because they knew they would
pay too high of a price for it

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:34.150
in their own constituencies.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:38.750
Now, the recent trend
across the democratic world

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.800
has been to weaken parties.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.783
And this has taken a number of
forms in a number of systems,

00:51:45.783 --> 00:51:50.290
but it's all tended to
produce the same result.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:52.217
So one way in which this has happened

00:51:52.217 --> 00:51:57.217
is in moving away from back
benches selecting front benches,

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:03.700
members of a parliamentary
party picking its leadership,

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:06.370
to instead having
leaders elected at large.

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:08.793
So here's a pretty dramatic instance.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.060
- Jeremy Corbyn elected as
leader of the Labour Party.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.080
- [Presenter] The veteran left winger

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.020
has come to be reinforced his position

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.310
as head of Britain's
main opposition party.

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:20.690
Corbyn was backed by nearly 62%

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.420
of half a million party members

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.370
who voted in the leadership contest

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:26.990
after he'd been challenged
by many Laboor MPs.

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:28.990
He immediately called for unity.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:32.463
- We have much more in common
than that which divides us.

00:52:34.774 --> 00:52:36.010
As far as I'm concerned,

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.670
let's wipe that slate clean from today

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:39.840
and get on with the work

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.380
we've got to do as a party together.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.340
- [Presenter] The immediate question

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.260
is whether more centrist Labour MPs

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.500
who'd opposed Corbyn
will rally behind him.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.760
Beyond that lies the task

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.070
of mounting a serious challenge for power.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.960
Critics say the in fighting
has left a vacuum in opposition

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.573
that's been filled by the
Eurosceptic hard right.

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:02.470
- So Corbyn's call for unity
there is a little bit alike

00:53:03.258 --> 00:53:05.690
we might call it the British equivalent

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:07.653
of whistling Dixie in that.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:14.490
But here's the interesting set of facts

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:15.640
that led up to that.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.610
It used to be the case that, as I said,

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:21.020
the parliamentary labor parties
elected their own leader.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.896
Starting in the early 1980s,

00:53:23.896 --> 00:53:27.571
they put in a series of reforms

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:30.945
to weaken the role of
the parliamentary party

00:53:30.945 --> 00:53:35.945
and strengthen the role of
larger constituencies out there

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:39.350
of unions and others.

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:40.453
But in an any event,

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:46.540
when Ed Miliband was leader,

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:50.490
they put in a system that any
member of the Labour Party

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:53.750
could vote in the leadership election.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:56.240
It costs three pounds
to join the Labour Party

00:53:57.642 --> 00:54:01.660
and it has as you saw 450,000 members.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:06.440
So in 2015 after Miliband
was forced to step down

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.950
because they lost the election.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:11.560
As I said, in systems like this,

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.093
if you don't deliver a
victory, you're gone.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.333
Corbyn won.

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:22.070
And Corbyn was a card carrying
Marxist way to the left

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.920
nevermind of the median
voter in the Labour Party

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.670
but of the median British voter.

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:30.510
And the parliamentary labor party

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:32.750
quickly discovered they
couldn't work with him

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:36.040
and so there were mass defections
from the shadow cabinet

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.190
and eventually a vote
of no confidence in him

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:41.233
of 172 to 40.

00:54:42.156 --> 00:54:43.743
That's a pretty big majority.

00:54:44.598 --> 00:54:47.440
And then three months
later as you just saw,

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.850
he was reelected by 62% of the membership.

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:54.720
So if you now think about
Corbyn coming into government

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.577
which might happen in
December of this year,

00:54:58.577 --> 00:55:03.577
you'll have a situation where
he will not be able to govern

00:55:04.188 --> 00:55:08.610
with the members of the
parliamentary Labour Party,

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:12.380
many of whom could not survive
in their constituencies

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.090
if they supported his program.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:18.170
So this is something that
has gone on in country,

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.975
after country, after country.

00:55:19.975 --> 00:55:24.810
Many, many political parties

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:29.340
have moved toward more direct
election of their leaders.

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:34.110
And the difficulty is that
the political activists

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:37.080
who tend to join parties and participate

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.070
are on the fringes with the parties

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:42.620
and tend not to be
representative of the people

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.710
who turn out in the general election

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:47.960
and elect people to parliament.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.480
And so you get that problem.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.170
Secondly, increasing use,

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:55.540
I talked a little bit about this

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.960
when we did the anti-tax class.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.090
Increasing use of ballot initiatives,

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:03.150
referenda, and plebiscites.

00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:05.520
Again, since we're talking about England,

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:06.743
let's stay there.

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:13.710
- Their verdict has been given by a vote

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:15.660
and by a majority bigger

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.270
than that achieved by any government

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:21.853
in any general election in
the history of our democracy.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:27.250
No one in Britain, in
Europe, or the wider world

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:30.640
should have any doubt about its meaning.

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.130
It was a free vote without constraint

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:37.950
following a free democratic campaign

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:41.813
conducted constructively
and without rancor.

00:56:41.813 --> 00:56:46.813
It means that 14 years of
national argument are over.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:52.970
It means that all those
who have had reservations

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.574
about Britain's commitment

00:56:54.574 --> 00:56:58.634
should now join whole
heartedly without stint

00:56:58.634 --> 00:57:02.800
in the task of overcoming
the economic problems

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.650
that assail us as a nation.

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:09.710
And work whole heartedly
with our partners in Europe

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:11.920
and our friends everywhere

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:16.300
to meet the challenges
confronting the whole world.

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.507
- So this is what many people don't know

00:57:18.507 --> 00:57:20.970
when they think about Brexit referendum

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.200
that in fact the first
British referendum ever

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.800
was in 1975 called by Harold Wilson.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.850
At that time, the Labour
Party was split over Europe

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:34.596
and tended to be more anti-Europe

00:57:34.596 --> 00:57:37.760
because British workers
had stronger protections

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.120
than European workers,

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.400
whereas the Tories tended
to be more pro-European.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.570
So it was a flip,

00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:46.900
the mirror image of what it is today.

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:51.605
And so Harold Wilson was
confronting a very divided party

00:57:51.605 --> 00:57:54.350
and rather than do the hard work

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.870
of the discounting and so on

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:59.501
to force a resolution within the party,

00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:03.570
he had this idea, let's
just have a referendum.

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:05.580
And so they had their first referendum

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:10.580
and as he said, 2/3's
voted to stay in the EU.

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:16.470
I couldn't resist putting
this on the slide.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:17.993
He crowed later.

00:58:17.993 --> 00:58:20.877
He said, "It was a matter
of some satisfaction

00:58:20.877 --> 00:58:21.710
"that an issue

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:24.257
"which had threatened
several times over 13 years

00:58:24.257 --> 00:58:26.447
"to tear the Labor movement apart

00:58:26.447 --> 00:58:28.827
"had been resolved fairly and finally.

00:58:28.827 --> 00:58:31.907
"All that had divided us
in that great controversy

00:58:31.907 --> 00:58:34.357
"was put behind us."

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:37.020
Of course, five years later,

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.130
they split anyway

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:42.670
when the left wing had gotten control.

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:44.350
After the first set of reforms

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:46.640
to the leadership election process,

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.670
the left wing had gotten control

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:51.260
and so called Gang of Four,

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.770
Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Shirley Williams,

00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:57.480
and Bill Rodgers left and formed
the social democratic party

00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:02.283
which would eventually unite
with the liberal democrats.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.880
Same thing with Cameron in 2016.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.010
He was trying to duck

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:12.890
resolving the conflict
within the conservative party

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:15.650
and so he thought he would
do it with a referendum.

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:20.650
It wasn't any more successful
than Harold Wilson's effort.

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.180
Interestingly, just to go
back to Margaret Thatcher,

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:29.840
in 1983, she was then a
sitting prime minister.

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.058
She had won in 1979 the 1983 election.

00:59:34.058 --> 00:59:37.696
She was pro-European in those days,

00:59:37.696 --> 00:59:41.197
but she said, "Britain's
getting a raw deal

00:59:41.197 --> 00:59:42.627
"from the common market

00:59:42.627 --> 00:59:45.740
"and so we need to renegotiate."

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.740
And particularly the,

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:50.140
as I mentioned in an earlier lecture,

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:55.140
the agricultural policy
and the fisheries policy

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:59.166
that Gove was complaining
about in that video

00:59:59.166 --> 01:00:01.740
worked to Britain's disadvantage.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:05.370
And so she had negotiated
a rebate for Britain.

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:08.253
It came to about 40 billion pounds a year.

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:15.470
That would be an example of
trying to figure out a way

01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:18.890
to redo the bundling, right?

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:22.590
So yes, there's a Eurosceptic
wing of the tory party.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:24.150
They've got these complaints,

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.247
so we'll do something to address them

01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:30.800
and redo the bundling and
go on into the future.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.070
And it was pretty successful.

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:36.610
Not only did she win in
1983 promising to do that.

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:41.610
After she did it, she won
the next election as well.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:43.997
So this was a very different approach

01:00:43.997 --> 01:00:48.997
than the use of ballot
initiatives, referenda, and so on.

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:50.910
Fixed parliaments act.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:54.353
Again, we've seen this
playing out in real time.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.320
Weakens the power of the prime minister

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.130
to whip the back benches
to support a program.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:05.629
So in this case,

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:10.629
if they had not had put in
the fixed parliament act

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:13.110
which was put in in 2015

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:17.973
again to limit the unilateral
power of the leadership,

01:01:19.235 --> 01:01:22.078
you now have to get a
2/3 vote in parliament

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.960
to call an election,

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.080
but for that,

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.080
Theresa May could have forced
the tories to support her deal

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:33.860
that she had negotiated.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.290
No longer has that power.

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:39.210
Lots of calls to strengthen presidents

01:01:40.183 --> 01:01:45.183
partly because legislatures
have become so dysfunctional

01:01:45.324 --> 01:01:49.949
and so difficult to form
governments that can govern.

01:01:49.949 --> 01:01:54.310
People say oh, we need to give
more authority to executives

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:58.578
to punch through all of the
bickering in parliament.

01:01:58.578 --> 01:02:01.462
And so you get especially
in Eastern Europe,

01:02:01.462 --> 01:02:05.800
in Latin America, and increasingly here,

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.980
claims that it's important to
concentrate executive power

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.310
because you can't otherwise govern.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:14.390
And this is not just Trump,

01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:17.014
but in series one president after another

01:02:17.014 --> 01:02:20.563
relying increasingly on executive power.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.540
Growing reliance on
primaries and caucuses.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.540
Again, primaries and caucuses are seen

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:34.310
as ways of democratizing the control

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:37.010
and governance of political parties.

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:42.010
They've been around for over
a century in the legislature,

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.930
but become more and more important

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:47.250
because we have more and more safe seats.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.330
And if you have more and more safe seats,

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:54.180
the primary election becomes
the only election that matters.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.620
At the presidential level,

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.430
primaries didn't become important

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:00.210
until the McGovern-Fraser reforms

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.840
that I talked about last time.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.986
But here's the thing about
primaries and caucuses

01:03:05.986 --> 01:03:08.810
is you're thinking about the primary,

01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:11.880
the left party's gotta
go to the median voter

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.190
you might think of their party,

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.520
and the right party of the
median voter of their party,

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.000
but that's not what tends to happen

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.125
because the people who turn
out in primaries and caucuses

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:26.560
tend to be on the fringes of the parties

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.483
and so not even these
people, but these people.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:39.110
It's extremely low turn out in
these primaries and caucuses,

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:43.550
so you can get Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:47.280
elected in New York with an 11% turn out,

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.900
Jim Jordan in Ohio

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:55.630
or Mark Meadows again
selected in primaries

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:59.600
with 15 or 16% turn out.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.510
And these people are not representative

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:06.089
of the voters in their district

01:04:06.089 --> 01:04:10.370
and nevermine representative
the voters in the country.

01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:12.260
And so what tends to happen

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.484
is they control who gets selected

01:04:16.484 --> 01:04:20.121
and then when the people go to Washington,

01:04:20.121 --> 01:04:24.380
either they do the kind of compromising

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.290
that's needed to pass legislation

01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:29.130
in which case they get
accused of having sold out

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:31.410
by the people who selected them,

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:32.243
or they don't,

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:33.860
in which case you get gridlock

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:36.330
and alienation of other voters.

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:37.730
And so either way,

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:42.000
the remedy does not address
the voter alienation

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.083
that people so often complain about.

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:50.903
And just if you want a very
recent illustration of this,

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.390
I saw the other day on Morning Joe

01:04:58.603 --> 01:04:59.927
Mike Murphy, a republican strategist,

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.626
was reporting on interviews
of senate republicans

01:05:05.626 --> 01:05:09.814
and had concluded that if the vote

01:05:09.814 --> 01:05:14.814
on removal from office of
Trump were a secret ballot,

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:17.793
30 republican senators would support it.

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:24.430
But they know that if they're
known to have done it,

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.490
they'll face brutal primary challenges

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.493
and almost certainly not survive.

01:05:31.381 --> 01:05:36.020
So that's the story
about weakening parties.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.273
Now, some people say well,

01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:46.430
maybe the best solution is
the middle, is some mix.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:50.360
We talk about Labradors being,

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:55.060
a Labradoodle is a dog
with a nice personality

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.183
that doesn't shed, right?

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.443
And so people have often said
the Germans got it all right.

01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:04.810
They have a mixed system,

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:08.930
partly of single member
districts, partly PR,

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:11.520
and they've been very successful

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.740
for much of the postwar period,

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.450
so maybe what we really want is a system

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:18.750
that gets the both of all worlds.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:23.324
And Germany was always held
out as the Labradoodle,

01:06:23.324 --> 01:06:26.200
strong parliamentarism unlike Weimar

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.620
which gave a lot of
power to the president.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:33.620
The president is very much
answerable to the legislature.

01:06:34.554 --> 01:06:37.890
The single member
districts that they have,

01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:39.860
they only have 299.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.880
They're very big and they're very diverse.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.930
They're three times the size of Britain's

01:06:44.797 --> 01:06:47.020
and that tends to make it function

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.810
more like a two party system.

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:51.860
You tend to get predictable governments.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:55.400
Lots of party discipline
until relatively recently

01:06:57.539 --> 01:07:00.340
in candidate and leadership selection.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.423
No longer true in the SPD.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.730
And then there are various
external constraints,

01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:09.700
budget rules, constraints from the EU,

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.150
anti-protectionism requirements, and so on

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:18.150
that hemmed in the deals
that governments could make.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.760
But it was all underpinned by this postwar

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.118
social democratic consensus

01:07:24.118 --> 01:07:28.450
that I have mentioned
to you several times.

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.210
And even in Germany now,

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:32.890
the truth is we saw it took Merkel

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:36.553
six months to form a
government after 2017.

01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:40.221
The decentralized control of the SPD

01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:44.410
which meant that half a
million almost members

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:49.410
had to vote on every provision
of the coalition deal

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:55.737
meant that the negotiations
were very tortured.

01:07:55.737 --> 01:07:58.510
Merkel had to give up six ministries

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:00.620
including the finance ministry

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.300
and produced a government

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.893
over which she has very little control.

01:08:05.893 --> 01:08:09.560
The grand coalition
splinters the opposition

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.010
as we've seen.

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:13.200
And it's been very bad

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.469
for both the parties in the coalition.

01:08:15.469 --> 01:08:20.229
In the regional elections last year,

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.440
they both hemorrhaged support

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.820
and this has happened more recently again

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.433
in the local elections.

01:08:29.081 --> 01:08:30.520
So what's going on in Germany

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.630
is replicating the pattern elsewhere.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:36.320
I just remind you of
the slides I showed you.

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.933
The number of parties has gone
up steadily since the 1960s.

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:45.650
Particularly the fragmentation
of parties on the left

01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:46.894
has been dramatic

01:08:46.894 --> 01:08:51.182
and it's paralleled the decline in unions.

01:08:51.182 --> 01:08:55.109
Less dramatic on the right,

01:08:55.109 --> 01:08:59.360
but still if you look at the
number of right wing parties

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.680
as compared with the 1970s,

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.203
they are much higher,

01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:08.270
many more of them than there used to be.

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:12.350
And so the upshot is that
you get weakened parties

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:15.010
who have diminished
capacities to form governments

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:18.533
and govern which produces
more alienation of voters

01:09:18.533 --> 01:09:23.078
that then feeds demands
for further reform.

01:09:23.078 --> 01:09:27.940
And so think about the
parallels with the 1930s

01:09:28.892 --> 01:09:33.170
with which we began this course.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:38.170
So in the 1930s in Britain,
there were also fascists.

01:09:39.190 --> 01:09:40.690
They were called the Mosleyites.

01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:42.740
And in 1936,

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:47.740
the Mosleyites actually
had larger membership

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.870
than the Nazi party in Germany,

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:54.120
but they didn't get
any seats in parliament

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.823
because of the two party system, right?

01:09:58.470 --> 01:10:01.131
Whereas in Germany, in Italy,

01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:04.823
in these other countries, you got,

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.290
I showed you this picture
in the very first lecture.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:12.670
You had a highly fragmented system,

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:13.910
government impossible,

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.190
and then the Nazi party
just sweeping through

01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:19.170
and eventually taking power.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:20.920
And people worry about

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.160
whether this isn't where
we are headed again.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.430
And if you think about
the last decade or so,

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:32.080
again in Britain, we've
had the rise of UKIP.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.160
We've had the British national party

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.440
which is even further
to the right than UKIP.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.830
But because they don't have PR,

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:44.500
these parties don't get anywhere
in the political system.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.420
Instead, as we've just
seen now with Nigel Farage,

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:52.850
he's basically having to have
influence through the tories

01:10:55.627 --> 01:10:57.723
if he really wants to affect
the outcome if the tories win.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.930
Otherwise, we'll be looking
at a hung parliament

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:08.890
and it'll make it look more
like a European system.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:13.890
And so he's essentially
pulling Johnson to the right

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.990
to take some of his concerns into account,

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:25.070
but not being able unilaterally
to determine the outcome.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.370
Whereas in all the European systems,

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.950
these very anti-Europe parties,

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:37.140
anti-system parties are doing much better.

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:40.820
So again, we worry that this might not be

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:44.793
some kind of portent for the future.

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:48.930
So what are the implications more broadly

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.660
for the economy and society?

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:56.480
The take aways of today is
that in two party systems,

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.580
we should expect
comparatively weak protections

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.830
for organized labor

01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:04.769
because unions are not
a majority of the party

01:12:04.769 --> 01:12:08.129
and comparatively low
spending and redistribution.

01:12:08.129 --> 01:12:10.730
That incidentally is
why people on the left

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:12.980
used to prefer multiparty systems

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:16.600
because they were thought
to be more redistributive.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.060
But in multiparty systems today,

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.720
you should expect organized labor

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.520
to be decreasingly effective

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.600
at protecting a shrinking
labor aristocracy

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.174
and that's what we have
seen playing itself out

01:12:30.174 --> 01:12:32.690
in all of these European systems.

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:35.428
We should expect the
emergence of populist parties

01:12:35.428 --> 01:12:39.420
with anti-immigrant and
protectionist agendas.

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.280
And where parties are weak,

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.720
we should expect primary challenges

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.610
or presidential candidates
running on anti-immigrant

01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:48.400
and protectionist agendas.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400
And we should expect

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.760
that where you have
fewer stronger parties,

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.160
it'll be easier to resist this.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.120
When we think about
what's called clientelism,

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.120
this is when you instead of
pursuing programmatic policies

01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:08.520
in the interest of the polity as a whole.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.140
Rather, you reward sectional interests.

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.006
We should expect

01:13:12.006 --> 01:13:15.369
that you're most likely to
get programmatic politics

01:13:15.369 --> 01:13:18.030
out of strong two party systems

01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:20.570
when Steve and I are worrying about

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:24.900
not leaving any voters on
the table over the long run,

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.897
you are gonna get what I
call wholesale clientelism,

01:13:28.897 --> 01:13:31.450
giving the farmers their high prices

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:34.669
or giving whatever you need to give,

01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:36.980
give the religious parties in Israel

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.220
whatever you need to give them

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.370
to form a government that's
wholesale clientelism

01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:43.864
when you have multiparty system.

01:13:43.864 --> 01:13:45.660
Where you have weak parties,

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.050
you should see a lot
of retail clientelism,

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:49.400
bridges to nowhere,

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.707
special deals for firms in your district

01:13:51.707 --> 01:13:54.290
'cause that's what
people are worried about.

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:57.953
And when you have lots of weak parties,

01:13:57.953 --> 01:14:00.430
we should expect lots of wholesale

01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:02.700
and lots of retail corruption.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:06.453
Cleintelism, lots of corruption.

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:10.900
If you look at the statistics
on economic performance,

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.810
again, this is that paper from last year

01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:15.280
that I mentioned to you,

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.560
the data also supports the idea

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.538
that you get better economic performance

01:14:21.538 --> 01:14:23.920
when parties are strong.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.530
You can peruse this slide and that paper

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:30.030
which I strongly
recommend at your leisure.

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:31.610
So reform agendas,

01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:36.290
they're hard because of the
very widespread misdiagnosis.

01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:37.910
People feel out of control.

01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:42.110
They want more democratization
of political parties,

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.810
more control from below,

01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:46.460
more unbundling, more referendums,

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.644
more direction of leadership,

01:14:48.644 --> 01:14:52.710
and they don't understand that
that's making things worse.

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:55.750
It's hard also because the beneficiaries

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:58.220
tend to not want to change the system

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.130
that has put them in place.

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:03.220
So when Renzi tried to
reverse some of this

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:07.520
in a referendum in 2016
in Italian politics,

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.620
he had his head handed to them.

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.796
Because starry-eyed
progressives tend to think

01:15:12.796 --> 01:15:17.110
that more direct democracy
is gonna help them,

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:20.843
but in fact, the agenda
soon gets hijacked.

01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:28.440
It should be remembered that
primaries were brought to us

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.350
by the progressives at the
beginning of the last century.

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:35.020
Hard because of the misguided faith in PR,

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.265
people think it's more representative.

01:15:37.265 --> 01:15:39.139
And it's hard because the direction

01:15:39.139 --> 01:15:41.150
that reform needs to go in

01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:44.340
is really the opposite of
what most people think.

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:47.880
And what to do in that difficult situation

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.230
will be the subject of my
lecture on December 5th.

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:53.730
See you next week

01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:55.930
when we will talk about
the building blocks

01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:57.893
of distributive politics.

01:15:59.353 --> 01:16:01.770
(calm music)

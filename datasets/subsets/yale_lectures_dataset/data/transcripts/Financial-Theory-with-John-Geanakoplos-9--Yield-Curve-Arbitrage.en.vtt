00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.900
All right, so last time we
began, or maybe two times ago,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.154
we began a discussion of
various vocabulary and facts you

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:15.408
have to know about the markets
if you want to think about

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:16.320
finance.
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.395
Today we're going to deal
mostly with the most important

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.800
one, the most basic one,
the yield curve.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.523
And last time,
we introduced this word,

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.430
"yield."
 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.564
Now, yield is an extremely
common expression in finance,

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:33.672
and it turns out not to be that
well defined,

00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:36.100
often, or that useful.
 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.566
But the word is so important
and has been used so often that

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.503
it still hangs around,
even when probably we should

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:44.090
use different concepts.
 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.360
So remember the yield was an
attempt to look at an

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.520
investment,
and without paying any

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.130
attention to the market or
anything outside the investment,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.160
just looking at the investment
itself,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.989
try to assess,
give a number,

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.840
quantifying how attractive the
investment was.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.159
So we said you could apply that
to a bond--it has cash flows.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.912
You could apply it to a hedge
fund that's taking in money and

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:13.293
paying out money,
and the formula we came up with

00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:18.659
said that if the cash flows are
given by C(1),

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.093
C(2), the net cash flows,
C(T) over the course of the

00:01:24.093 --> 00:01:27.918
period,
and its price is some P(0),

00:01:27.918 --> 00:01:31.420
maybe it's a negative cash
flow,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.688
so C(0).
 

00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:34.861
So some of these cash flows
might be negative and some of

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.459
them might be positive,
then we should just look at the

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.703
number Y,
such that discounting all these

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:47.890
things at rate Y gives you 0.
 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.786
The Y that did that was what we
defined as the yield of the

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:52.660
investment.
 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.530
So we saw that that had some
advantages.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.041
For example,
in a hedge fund,

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:59.226
if you just look at the rate of
return it makes on its money

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:01.566
every year,
that doesn't take into account

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.718
that in some years,
it's got a lot more money.

00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:05.739
So if those were the years that
lost money,

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:08.082
and the years when it hardly
had any money were the years it

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:09.992
made money,
just taking the average,

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:13.324
the multiplicative average,
the geometric average of all

00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:16.810
those yearly rates of returns,
would give a misleading figure.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.598
Well, the yield also gives a
somewhat misleading figure,

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:24.456
and I don't want to spend too
much time on why it might be

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:27.686
misleading,
but I'll give you just an

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:28.419
example.
 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:34.074
Suppose that the cash flows
happen to be 1,

00:02:34.074 --> 00:02:35.690
-4, and 3.
 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.919
Now what's the yield to
maturity?

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.710
Well, there are two of them.
 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.580
You could have Y = 0,
because 1 over (1 0),

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.494
- 4 over (1 0),
3 over (1 0),

00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:53.288
is just 1 - 4 3.
 

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:57.042
That equals 0,
so the yield to maturity of 0

00:02:57.042 --> 00:03:02.366
percent, the yield of 0 percent,
makes this have present value

00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:02.889
0.
 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.389
But also I could try Y = 200
percent,

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:14.210
and then I'd have Y--I'd put a
2 and a 2 squared here,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:23.909
and I'd have 1 - 4 thirds 1
over 3 squared is 3 over 9,

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.090
so it's 1 third.
 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.394
So it would be 1 minus 4
thirds, plus 1 third,

00:03:28.394 --> 00:03:30.008
which also equals 0.
 

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:33.235
So is the yield to maturity,
the internal rate of return 0

00:03:33.235 --> 00:03:34.650
percent or 200 percent?
 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.080
It's ambiguous.
 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.818
So yield to maturity can't be
the right way of doing things.

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.680
To go back to the hedge fund
example,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.699
you know, the hedge fund was
taking in money,

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.830
paying out money,
taking in more money,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.264
paying out money,
and we calculated the yield to

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:51.068
maturity.
 

00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:53.710
Well suppose that there was
some period,

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.750
you know, here,
at which point everyone had

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.247
taken all their money out,
so the hedge fund wasn't

00:03:58.247 --> 00:04:00.378
actually doing anything for a
bunch of years,

00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:03.246
maybe for a long time,
and then it started up and took

00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:05.408
money in and paid money out and
stuff.

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:08.062
Well, because the gap in time
was very long with nothing

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:09.996
happening,
if you take a positive Y,

00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:13.080
the stuff that happens in the
second incarnation of the fund

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.590
is hardly going to be making any
difference,

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.043
because by that time,
it will all be discounted a

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:18.350
lot.
 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.947
So the yield will depend too
sensitively on stuff early

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:26.540
rather than stuff late.
 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.028
And so again,
you get into troubles yielding

00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:33.160
just yield to maturity,
so that can't be the right

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.923
thing to do,
even though people have done it

00:04:35.923 --> 00:04:36.709
for years.
 

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.271
So the word,
however, lives on,

00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:41.293
and there's no getting rid of
the word because it's used in

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:42.440
common vocabulary.
 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.529
Now what would Irving Fisher
say you should do,

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.940
if you had to summarize how
good an investment was?

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.509
What's his lesson?
 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.889
What do you do?
 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.370
An investment where there's no
doubt about what the cash flows

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.603
are going to be,
what would he say you should

00:04:58.603 --> 00:05:01.910
do, to evaluate the
attractiveness of it?

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.892
What's our lesson,
our main lesson from Irving

00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:04.290
Fisher?
 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.459
What would he say?
 

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:07.050
Yes.
 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.228
Student:
&gt;

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:08.699
like to check?
 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.211
Prof: Well,
let's say they're cash flows,

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:13.307
so it's money,
money that you're going to get

00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:15.495
coming in and out,
yeah, he'd say,

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:21.175
deflate by inflation and turn
them into real flows and then do

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:21.920
what?
 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.149
So just continue your answer.
 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:26.788
So turn them into actual
potatoes every time,

00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:28.360
apples each time.
 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:37.959
Deflate by inflation and then
do what with the numbers?

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:38.839
This is a simple question.
 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.560
You're thinking too hard.
 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.230
Yes?
 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.649
Student:
Compare the present value.

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:45.024
Prof: Okay,
he'd say, "Just look at

00:05:45.024 --> 00:05:46.399
the present value of all these
things."

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.553
So of course,
to do that, you'd have to know,

00:05:48.553 --> 00:05:51.293
what is the market rate of
interest with which to compute

00:05:51.293 --> 00:05:52.370
the present value?
 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.656
So Fisher would say,
"It's ridiculous to

00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:57.826
evaluate how good an investment
opportunity is just by looking

00:05:57.826 --> 00:05:58.970
at the cash flows.
 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.920
You're throwing away too much
information."

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.406
You know what the market is
doing, you know what the

00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:04.430
interest rates are.
 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.338
Use the market interest rates
and figure out what the present

00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:12.040
value of all the cash flows is.
 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.473
So we're going to now do that a
bunch of times,

00:06:15.473 --> 00:06:19.879
okay, for the rest of the
class, and see what that means.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.673
So we have to begin,
the two thirds of the class is

00:06:23.673 --> 00:06:27.771
going to be spent on the
question, how do you know what

00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:30.579
the market rates of interest
are?

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:32.639
So how do you know what the
market rates of interest are?

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.170
How could you find out what the
market rate of interest is?

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.839
What would you do to find it
out?

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:39.550
Yeah.
 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.920
Student:
You could go to a bank and see

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.870
what they were estimating it to
be.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.509
Prof: And if you looked
in the newspaper,

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.009
say, could you find it in the
newspapers?

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:48.649
What would you find in the
newspapers?

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:49.279
Yes?
 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.954
Student:
You'd want to find a riskless

00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:53.899
investment, say like a T-bill.
 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:57.499
Prof: Okay,
and so yes, you try and look at

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:01.329
riskless investments like
government bonds,

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:03.730
where there can't be any
default--at least,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.019
that's what they always used to
say--

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:09.379
can't be any default on an
American promise.

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.767
America's government never
broke a promise and they can

00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:15.507
always print the money,
so presumably they don't have

00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:17.399
to break a promise--
so they're just promising money

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.247
which they can print,
so why should they ever break

00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:22.038
their promise--
so what would you find if you

00:07:22.038 --> 00:07:23.569
opened a newspaper?
 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:27.639
You would find,
for different maturities--

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.389
it used to be up to 30
years--for different maturities,

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:38.069
you would find the yield on the
various bonds,

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:38.519
okay?
 

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:41.940
So why would you find the yield?
 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.149
Well, the yield of various
government bonds,

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:48.240
of gov.
 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.050
bonds.
 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.370
Why do they quote the yield?
 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.079
Well, that's just because,
you know,

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:58.303
a hundred years ago,
people started using the idea

00:07:58.303 --> 00:08:02.439
of yield and so the vocabulary
has been kept,

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:06.173
even though it's not the best
way of describing what's going

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:06.490
on.
 

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.005
So for instance,
let's just look at some of the

00:08:10.005 --> 00:08:14.134
yield curves you might have seen
over the last 9 years,

00:08:14.134 --> 00:08:17.269
almost 10 years,
since December 2000.

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:23.129
You would see that in December
2000, the yield on the 1-year

00:08:23.129 --> 00:08:27.697
bonds, you know,
the short yields--this isn't a

00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:31.670
log scale, so this is 3,6,
12, okay.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.148
So the shortest bonds usually
have lower yields than the

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:36.918
highest bonds,
but sometimes,

00:08:36.918 --> 00:08:40.144
like in December 2000,
the yields are almost all the

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:40.840
same.
 

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.928
It's called the flat yield
curve.

00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:46.937
Other times,
like now, we're in this light

00:08:46.937 --> 00:08:51.500
blue one here,
right now the short bonds have

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.590
very small yields and the long
bonds have much higher yields,

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.058
so the last one is the 30-year
bond.

00:09:01.058 --> 00:09:07.700
So you get the yield on every
single bond.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.734
Now what do you notice about
this picture,

00:09:09.734 --> 00:09:10.379
by the way?
 

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:13.480
They can be very different at
different time periods,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.462
so in December 2000,
the interest rates were really

00:09:16.462 --> 00:09:17.000
high.
 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.360
The yields were 6 percent.
 

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.480
I'm talking yields so far.
 

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.700
We haven't talked about
interest rates.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.159
We have to figure out what the
interest rates are,

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:23.769
but anyway, they're obviously
going to be connected.

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:27.023
So the yields were very high in
December 2000,

00:09:27.023 --> 00:09:29.916
and they got much lower in
December 2008,

00:09:29.916 --> 00:09:32.230
and they've stayed very low.
 

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.990
So why are they so low now?
 

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.070
What got them to be so low now?
 

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.830
Yeah?
 

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.426
Student:
The Fed flooded the economy

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:40.918
with money.
 

00:09:40.918 --> 00:09:43.029
Prof: The Fed flooded
the economy with money.

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:46.279
It wanted to drive the interest
rates down to 0.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.936
So we're going to see very soon
why the Fed might have wanted to

00:09:49.936 --> 00:09:53.710
do that, but these money rates
don't move totally on their own.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.874
They have to do,
and we said that Irving

00:09:55.874 --> 00:09:57.513
Fisher--
we haven't described Irving

00:09:57.513 --> 00:09:59.678
Fisher's theory of money and
nominal interest rates--

00:09:59.678 --> 00:10:02.118
but somehow,
the Fed is controlling the

00:10:02.118 --> 00:10:05.840
nominal interest rates and it's
changed the yield curve.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.658
So you notice that the yield
curve now, December 2008,

00:10:09.658 --> 00:10:11.100
was this blue one.
 

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.519
So the Fed, in the crisis of
2008, you know,

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:18.462
was terrified,
and it dropped the interest

00:10:18.462 --> 00:10:20.590
rate almost to 0,
virtually 0,

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.014
and it's kept it there,
because from December 2008 till

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:26.620
now,
we're at October 2009,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.399
September 30^(th),
2009, a long time has passed

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.230
from this dark blue to the light
blue line,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.000
and the rate has been kept
fixed there.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.495
But in the intervening time,
the long rates have started to

00:10:39.495 --> 00:10:40.220
go way up.
 

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.820
Now why might that be the case?
 

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.840
What does that suggest to
anybody?

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.860
Does anybody know?
 

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.480
Yeah?
 

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.850
Student:
&gt;

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:56.505
Prof: That could be one
reason, and could there be

00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:57.919
another reason?
 

00:10:57.919 --> 00:10:58.519
Yeah?
 

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.879
Student:
Future expected inflation.

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:01.730
Prof: Okay,
so those are the two reasons.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.485
So they somehow know that,
and some of you have no idea

00:11:04.485 --> 00:11:06.678
how they could possibly be
thinking that.

00:11:06.678 --> 00:11:10.922
And so I'm going to explain,
what information is there in

00:11:10.922 --> 00:11:13.120
the different yield curves.
 

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.360
Okay, so the point is that
every morning,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.908
every single financial analyst
wakes up and sees these yield

00:11:20.908 --> 00:11:22.956
curves,
you know, consults the market

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:24.538
and sees where things are
trading,

00:11:24.538 --> 00:11:27.700
and can produce a yield curve
like that.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.769
Okay, so you've got a bunch of
yields.

00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:32.879
Now what are the yields?
 

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:38.658
Well, let's just do an example
here.

00:11:38.658 --> 00:11:42.860
So I'm going to make up an
example, which is very easy to

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.610
compute.
 

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.038
So let's try this one.
 

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:52.294
Okay, so I'm reading here at
the top, let's just say that

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:56.048
you've got a bunch of different
bonds.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:58.183
A 1-year bond,
a 2-year bond,

00:11:58.183 --> 00:12:01.232
a 3-year bond,
a 4-year bond and a 5-year

00:12:01.232 --> 00:12:01.918
bond.
 

00:12:01.918 --> 00:12:08.672
Now each of the bonds was
issued--I'm assuming here that

00:12:08.672 --> 00:12:13.460
they were all issued on the same
day.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.298
So they're issued with
different coupons.

00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:17.840
Let's say they were all issued
today.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.490
We'll come back at the end.
 

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.285
Obviously the Treasury doesn't
issue new bonds every single

00:12:22.285 --> 00:12:25.034
day, so how does this change
when you arrive on a day when

00:12:25.034 --> 00:12:26.528
they haven't issued things?
 

00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:29.570
But let's just keep it simple
and suppose that today,

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.669
the Treasury has issued 5
different bonds over these 5

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:33.840
different years.
 

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.058
Now the Treasury has to set
what do they do?

00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:40.480
They decide how much of these
bonds they're going to sell and

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.159
they decide what coupon they're
going to set.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:44.889
They set the coupon.
 

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:48.870
So let's say the coupon they
set was 1 dollar for the 1-year

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.894
bond,
2 dollars for the 2-year bond,

00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:52.580
3 dollars for 3 three-year
bond,

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.798
4 for the 4-year bond,
5 for the 5-year bond.

00:12:54.798 --> 00:12:56.870
It's easy to remember,
that's why I chose those

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:57.320
numbers.
 

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.379
And the face value,
let's say, is always 100.

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:05.840
So why did they set those
coupons?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.056
Well, because given how much
they want to sell,

00:13:08.056 --> 00:13:10.851
they're picking the coupon,
hoping that the price turns out

00:13:10.851 --> 00:13:12.490
to be close to the face value.
 

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.705
So let's say,
when they actually market

00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:16.934
these,
and supply equals demand in

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:19.903
equilibrium,
the prices turn out to be

00:13:19.903 --> 00:13:24.259
100.1,100.2,
100.3,100.4, and 100.5.

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:27.552
So 100.5 is the price the
market's paying for the 5 year

00:13:27.552 --> 00:13:31.511
bond and if the coupon is 5,
and they pay coupons once a

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:35.432
year--they may pay twice a year,
but let's say they pay once a

00:13:35.432 --> 00:13:38.365
year for simplicity,
you're going to get 5,5,

00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:40.658
5,5, and 105 the last year.
 

00:13:40.658 --> 00:13:44.530
If you bought the four-year
coupon bond, you get 4,4,

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.690
4,104 the last year,
right?

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.158
So those are the bonds.
 

00:13:51.158 --> 00:13:53.250
Now the newspaper's not telling
you any of that,

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.558
so you're sort of losing that
information,

00:13:55.558 --> 00:13:59.429
so you don't actually know that
from reading the newspaper.

00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:01.580
So then, what do you know?
 

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:10.201
You know that--you know the
yields on all these things,

00:14:10.201 --> 00:14:11.320
okay?
 

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:19.120
So here, this tells you the
yield on each of these bonds.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.668
Going back to where I was.
 

00:14:24.668 --> 00:14:28.041
Okay, knowing the yield,
you could figure out what the

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:31.546
price of each of the bonds is,
or in fact, the way that they

00:14:31.546 --> 00:14:34.019
calculated the yield that the
newspapers reported.

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:36.320
How did the newspapers get the
yield?

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.730
The newspapers said,
well, for the 4 year bond,

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:53.081
we're going to say that 100.4 =
4 divided by (1 the 4 year

00:14:53.081 --> 00:15:02.681
coupon bond yield),
4 over (1 Y (4)) squared,

00:15:02.681 --> 00:15:13.381
plus 4 over (1 Y (4)) cubed,
plus 104 over (1 Y (4)) to the

00:15:13.381 --> 00:15:14.690
fourth.
 

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.532
In this case,
because these numbers are all

00:15:18.532 --> 00:15:21.275
positive,
it's monotonic in Y (4),

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:25.118
so there's a unique Y (4) which
you can use to solve this

00:15:25.118 --> 00:15:29.245
equation,
price = the discounted value at

00:15:29.245 --> 00:15:32.168
that yield of the payments.
 

00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:34.365
So that's how the newspapers,
the reporter,

00:15:34.365 --> 00:15:37.399
that's how he got all the
yields to show you that graph.

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:39.852
He looked at the market,
or could call the bank or

00:15:39.852 --> 00:15:41.956
something like that,
had a computer screen,

00:15:41.956 --> 00:15:44.009
talked to his friends on Wall
Street.

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:46.780
He knew the price of all the
bonds, he knew the coupons of

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.919
all the bonds,
and then he produced the yield

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:49.990
for all the bonds.
 

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.717
So the yield,
as I say, that's the word that

00:15:52.717 --> 00:15:55.147
everybody uses,
but really, the information

00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:57.149
that you want to deal with is
the price,

00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:59.389
and what did the coupon
actually pay?

00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:00.500
Okay, so that's what you know.
 

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.558
Everybody knows this every day,
the information I have given.

00:16:03.558 --> 00:16:05.768
Every morning,
maybe every few hours,

00:16:05.768 --> 00:16:07.240
people will update it.
 

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.815
They'll look at what are the
coupon bonds paying and what are

00:16:10.815 --> 00:16:11.590
the prices?
 

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.461
The thing that's changing from
hour to hour are the prices,

00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:17.331
but we're taking a snapshot at
the beginning of the day and

00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:18.620
looking at the prices.
 

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.655
So now we've got prices of
bonds, which I'm going to call

00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:28.427
capital Pis, Pi (1),
Pi (2), Pi (3),

00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:30.798
Pi (4) and Pi (5).
 

00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:32.668
But now, what does Fisher say
you should do?

00:16:32.668 --> 00:16:34.700
What's the most important thing
to do?

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.860
The most important thing to do
is find the interest rates.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.110
So what has this got to do with
interest rates?

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:44.158
Well, if you modernize Fisher a
little bit,

00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:47.740
the most important thing--he
didn't put it this way,

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.970
but this is really what he must
have meant--

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:56.620
the most important thing to do
is find the prices of the zeros.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:02.549
So [little]
pi (1) is today's money price,

00:17:02.549 --> 00:17:09.058
today's money price for 1
dollar at time 1.

00:17:09.058 --> 00:17:14.868
pi (2) is today's money price
for 1 dollar at time 2.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:24.394
pi (3), today's money price at
time 3, and pi (5) is today's

00:17:24.394 --> 00:17:28.269
money price at time 5.
 

00:17:28.269 --> 00:17:31.430
Okay, now why do you want to
find these things?

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.356
Because once you know these
things, you'd be able to value

00:17:34.356 --> 00:17:35.230
any investment.
 

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:40.691
That original investment that
we talked about,

00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:45.059
which maybe disappeared,
this one.

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:45.720
It disappeared.
 

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.608
Anyway, once you have all the
pis, if anybody tells you,

00:17:50.608 --> 00:17:54.787
if a hedge fund tells you,
"This is the revenue I'm

00:17:54.787 --> 00:17:58.813
going to produce for you in the
next five years,"

00:17:58.813 --> 00:18:02.140
if a company says,
"This is our business plan.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.983
We're going to build a factory
today that's going come out a

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:07.683
certain amount of money and
we're going to get profits in

00:18:07.683 --> 00:18:10.318
the next five years,
blah, blah, blah."

00:18:10.318 --> 00:18:13.867
If a new bond comes on the
market and you don't know how to

00:18:13.867 --> 00:18:16.559
price it, and somebody offers a
price for it,

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:19.130
how do you figure out what it's
worth?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.983
All you do is you take the cash
flows, the Cs that I not very

00:18:22.983 --> 00:18:25.746
cleverly erased,
you take the cash flows and

00:18:25.746 --> 00:18:27.608
multiply them by the pis.
 

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:33.698
So the correct price P is just
whatever the cash flows you're

00:18:33.698 --> 00:18:39.886
predicting times these pis that
Fisher says is what you should

00:18:39.886 --> 00:18:42.119
really be finding.
 

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:43.559
So nothing could be simpler.
 

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.529
Now why is this the right price?
 

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:49.652
Because if you can go in the
market and buy 1 dollar at time

00:18:49.652 --> 00:18:52.362
1 for pi of 1,
and 1 dollar at time 2 for pi

00:18:52.362 --> 00:18:54.708
of 2,
etc., you can buy all the cash

00:18:54.708 --> 00:18:58.468
flows from this investment
project by spending this amount

00:18:58.468 --> 00:18:59.259
of money.
 

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:02.590
So if the guy is offering you
the investment opportunity at a

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.588
higher price,
it's crazy to do it.

00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:07.170
You could have bought those
cash flows yourself by paying

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.769
this price.
 

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:10.338
If he offers it to you at a
lower price than that,

00:19:10.338 --> 00:19:17.220
then definitely you should do
it, because it's a bargain,

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.359
because if you had to buy it
yourself,

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:19.308
it would be more expensive.
 

00:19:19.308 --> 00:19:21.509
In fact, you can make an
arbitrage profit.

00:19:21.509 --> 00:19:25.237
If he's offering it to you at a
lower price, you can buy it and

00:19:25.237 --> 00:19:26.440
how do you buy it?
 

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.983
By selling these very promises,
C(1), C(2), C(T) on the market,

00:19:29.983 --> 00:19:33.471
and if people believe you that
you'll pay, you can sell it for

00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:34.328
this price.
 

00:19:34.328 --> 00:19:36.869
So you buy his project for a
lower price.

00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:39.009
You sell it for a higher price.
 

00:19:39.009 --> 00:19:41.519
You make the difference,
and when it comes time to keep

00:19:41.519 --> 00:19:43.615
your promises,
the project is giving you the

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:46.180
cash to keep your promises,
so you lock in a profit for

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.460
sure.
 

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.174
So if you knew the pis,
you would know for sure how to

00:19:49.174 --> 00:19:52.250
value any project where you knew
for sure the cash flows,

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.700
knowing the pis would tell you
how to value it,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.969
and would tell you whether it
was attractive or not

00:19:56.969 --> 00:19:57.558
attractive.
 

00:19:57.558 --> 00:20:00.430
You just look at how high the
present value is.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.088
Okay, any questions about that?
 

00:20:04.088 --> 00:20:08.750
So we just need to figure out
how to deduce what the little

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:13.088
pis are from the data that we're
going to be given,

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:19.420
and that we are given every day
by the market.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:25.155
Okay, so I said literally pi
(1) is the price you would pay

00:20:25.155 --> 00:20:28.420
today to buy 1 dollar tomorrow.
 

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.900
Now how could you go about
buying 1 dollar tomorrow,

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.946
given that the only things you
can trade on the market are

00:20:34.946 --> 00:20:37.779
these Treasury bonds,
these government bonds?

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.663
And I've told you what they pay
off and I've told you what their

00:20:40.663 --> 00:20:41.259
prices are.
 

00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:45.961
So how would you go and buy 1
dollar tomorrow and how much

00:20:45.961 --> 00:20:49.259
would it cost you,
1 dollar next year?

00:20:49.259 --> 00:20:54.818
How would you do that?
 

00:20:54.818 --> 00:20:56.505
You can trade,
buy or sell any of these

00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:57.259
Treasury bonds.
 

00:20:57.259 --> 00:21:01.214
So in the background,
I keep saying that we're going

00:21:01.214 --> 00:21:04.549
to have to worry about people
defaulting.

00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:05.598
We're not quite doing it yet.
 

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.480
So buying a Treasury bond,
you need the cash to buy it.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.029
Selling a Treasury bond means
you promise to deliver what the

00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:15.166
Treasury bond promises,
and your promise is as good as

00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:16.410
the government's.
 

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.535
So if you sell it to somebody,
they'll pay you the same

00:21:19.535 --> 00:21:21.038
government price for it.
 

00:21:21.038 --> 00:21:23.171
So obviously in the background,
you're going to have to do

00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:25.301
something to convince the guy
you're making the promise to

00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:26.910
that you're going to keep your
promise.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.578
So we're going to worry about
that later.

00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:33.510
So for now, when I say that the
market for those Treasury bonds

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.276
clears at those levels,
I mean that anybody who wants

00:21:37.276 --> 00:21:39.848
to can buy Treasury bonds at
those levels,

00:21:39.848 --> 00:21:42.848
or can sell them,
even if he doesn't have them,

00:21:42.848 --> 00:21:45.195
at those prices,
by making the promise of what

00:21:45.195 --> 00:21:46.500
the Treasury bond does.
 

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.576
Because we're assuming that the
government and you,

00:21:48.576 --> 00:21:50.902
everybody is just as reliable,
everybody is going to keep

00:21:50.902 --> 00:21:51.650
their promise.
 

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.474
So whether it's the Treasury
making the promise,

00:21:53.474 --> 00:21:55.029
or you making the promise,
same thing.

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:59.608
Okay, so how do you buy 1
dollar next year?

00:21:59.608 --> 00:22:08.375
What would you do in the market
with the Treasury bonds to get 1

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:11.019
dollar next year?
 

00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:13.778
Yeah?
 

00:22:13.778 --> 00:22:16.439
Student:
Can we just plug in 1 for our P

00:22:16.439 --> 00:22:19.733
in the bond prices and then
figure out which bond you want

00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:20.660
to purchase?
 

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.538
Prof: Well,
you're supposed to be telling

00:22:22.538 --> 00:22:22.740
me.
 

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.460
What do you want to do?
 

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.160
I want to know exactly what to
do.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.338
You can look at these numbers.
 

00:22:26.338 --> 00:22:27.809
By the way, are you all
following these?

00:22:27.809 --> 00:22:29.818
Maybe this is mysterious.
 

00:22:29.818 --> 00:22:34.960
There's a 1-year Treasury bond
that pays 101 dollars next year.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.454
The 2-year Treasury bond pays 2
dollars next year,

00:22:38.454 --> 00:22:39.240
then 102.
 

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.507
The 3-year Treasury bond pays 3
dollars at the end of the first

00:22:42.507 --> 00:22:45.615
year, 3 at the end of the second
year, 103 at the end of the

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:46.670
third year, etc.
 

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.463
And the 1 year Treasury bond
happens to be selling at this

00:22:49.463 --> 00:22:52.259
price, the 2-year happens to be
selling for that price.

00:22:52.259 --> 00:22:59.029
So what can I do with all these
bonds to buy 1 dollar next year?

00:22:59.029 --> 00:23:00.858
All right, go ahead,
you've started.

00:23:00.858 --> 00:23:02.059
Student:
Buy a 2-year bond.

00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:03.108
Prof: A 2-year bond?
 

00:23:03.108 --> 00:23:06.250
It's next year,
one year from now.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.402
Student:
You could just divide the price

00:23:09.402 --> 00:23:12.759
of the 1-year bond by
&gt;

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:14.450
Prof: You're a step
ahead of me.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.442
I'm saying, what do you
do--never mind how much does it

00:23:17.442 --> 00:23:17.828
cost?
 

00:23:17.828 --> 00:23:22.190
What do you do today to get 1
dollar next year?

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.961
What transaction can you make
today, what purchase can you

00:23:25.961 --> 00:23:29.140
make today to get yourself 1
dollar next year?

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.930
Yes?
 

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.569
Student:
Just buy a 1-year bond.

00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:35.720
Prof: Buy a 1-year bond.
 

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.059
Well, that will give me 101
dollars next year.

00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:41.380
I want 1 dollar next year.
 

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.134
Student:
Take that fraction

00:23:43.134 --> 00:23:44.568
&gt;
 

00:23:44.568 --> 00:23:47.559
Prof: Okay,
well, that's exactly the point.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.710
I take that fraction.
 

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.380
That's what I wanted you to
tell me.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:24:03.231
So little pi (1) is going to be
(1 over 101) times the price of

00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:11.643
the one-year bond,
because the 1-year bond is

00:24:11.643 --> 00:24:16.038
paying 101 dollars.
 

00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:19.980
So you take 1/101 of it,
you'll get 1 dollar.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.089
And whatever the price of the
1-year bond is--actually,

00:24:22.089 --> 00:24:22.990
we know what that is.
 

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:28.210
It's 100.1, that's how much it
costs.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.298
To buy 1 of them cost 100.1.
 

00:24:30.298 --> 00:24:35.848
To get 1 over 101 of them costs
pi (1).

00:24:35.848 --> 00:24:42.450
Okay, so this number,
by the way, is some number

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:49.048
which, actually,
I of course worked out here.

00:24:49.048 --> 00:24:53.859
Happens to be .991,
but we'll come back to that.

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:57.720
So it happens to be point 991.
 

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.220
So now we know pi (1).
 

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:12.098
Well, how would you buy 1
dollar in year 2?

00:25:12.098 --> 00:25:16.936
So there's a way of directly
buying 1 dollar in year 2,

00:25:16.936 --> 00:25:20.608
once you know how the
Treasuries trade.

00:25:20.608 --> 00:25:27.756
So what I'm doing is I'm
explaining the idea of

00:25:27.756 --> 00:25:31.328
replication, pricing.
 

00:25:31.328 --> 00:25:34.858
It's giving me pricing and it's
going to lead to arbitrage.

00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:38.430
They're all basically similar
ideas here.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:44.308
So what I want to do is
directly buy 1 dollar in year 2.

00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:47.127
So I could probably go to a
bank and they would actually

00:25:47.127 --> 00:25:48.410
make that trade for me.
 

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.078
I could just call up the bank
and say,

00:25:50.078 --> 00:25:52.618
"I want 1 dollar in year
2," and they'd tell me,

00:25:52.618 --> 00:25:54.410
pi (2), how much I have to pay
for it.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.519
But how are they going to
figure out what it's worth?

00:25:58.519 --> 00:26:02.085
They're going to see
how--they're going to go out and

00:26:02.085 --> 00:26:04.278
have to buy the dollar for me.
 

00:26:04.278 --> 00:26:07.098
So they're going to go out and
go to the Treasury market.

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:10.002
And what are they going to do
in the Treasury market to come

00:26:10.002 --> 00:26:11.480
up with my dollar in year 2?
 

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.932
They're going to replicate my
purchase of 1 dollar with a more

00:26:14.932 --> 00:26:17.990
complicated portfolio that they
can actually trade,

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.079
and that's how they're going to
figure out how to price my

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.868
request for 1 dollar in year 2.
 

00:26:22.868 --> 00:26:29.328
So what is this bank going to
do in the Treasury market?

00:26:29.328 --> 00:26:38.679
What does it have to do to get
1 dollar for sure in year two,

00:26:38.679 --> 00:26:41.640
and nothing else?
 

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.740
Okay?
 

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.049
Student:
Do they buy a 2-year bond and

00:26:46.049 --> 00:26:47.630
sell a 1-year bond?
 

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.490
Prof: Okay,
so what are they going to do?

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.190
How much of the two-year bonds
should they buy?

00:26:52.190 --> 00:27:02.722
Student:
What they're going to sell is

00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:04.160
a...
 

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.108
Prof: The 2 year bond.
 

00:27:05.108 --> 00:27:07.895
You're talking about the 2-year
bond, so how much of the 2-year

00:27:07.895 --> 00:27:09.200
bond are they going to buy?
 

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.180
Student: 1/102.
 

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.670
Prof: 1/102, right.
 

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:13.420
That's very good.
 

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.170
Why is that?
 

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.202
Because in year 2,
we're talking about year 2 now,

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:19.368
year 2, the 2-year bond pays
102.

00:27:19.368 --> 00:27:25.846
You get 1 over 102 of those,
you've got 1 dollar in year 2,

00:27:25.846 --> 00:27:28.079
so that's Pi of 2.
 

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:33.220
Which happens to be 100.2.
 

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.588
That's how much that costs.
 

00:27:35.588 --> 00:27:37.069
Okay, but is that all you need
to do?

00:27:37.069 --> 00:27:37.980
Is that it?
 

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.711
Are you paying the right amount
or are you paying too much,

00:27:42.711 --> 00:27:44.670
or what are you doing?
 

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.059
You've got to do more than just
that.

00:27:46.059 --> 00:27:47.730
Why is that?
 

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:48.750
Yeah.
 

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:55.009
Student:
When you subtract 2 times the

00:27:55.009 --> 00:27:58.848
&gt;
 

00:27:58.848 --> 00:28:00.599
Prof: Close,
but not quite.

00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:04.288
Okay, so do your reasoning.
 

00:28:04.288 --> 00:28:08.509
You told me what else to do,
which you slightly mis-said.

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:10.920
So why do you have to do
anything at all?

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.818
Tell me the reason why you want
to do something else.

00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:16.464
You're on the right track,
you just slipped up a little

00:28:16.464 --> 00:28:16.759
bit.
 

00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:20.009
So why not just stop here?
 

00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:23.013
Student:
Because you're also getting 2

00:28:23.013 --> 00:28:24.380
dollars in year 1.
 

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.818
Prof: Exactly,
that's exactly right.

00:28:26.818 --> 00:28:31.368
By buying the 2-year Treasury,
you got 102 in period--

00:28:31.368 --> 00:28:33.430
by buying this fraction of the
2 year,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.640
you got just what you want in
period 2,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.480
but you also purchased the
coupon in period 1,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.880
which you don't need.
 

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.548
So that's giving you more than
you needed to buy.

00:28:44.548 --> 00:28:48.394
You've bought extra,
so you're going to actually be

00:28:48.394 --> 00:28:50.617
able--
the cost of getting the dollar

00:28:50.617 --> 00:28:54.049
at the end of year 2 is a little
bit less than what we've written

00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:55.740
so far,
because you bought more.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.430
So far, this is buying too much.
 

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.798
You bought the dollar in year 2.
 

00:28:58.798 --> 00:29:00.950
You also bought a little bit in
year 1.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.540
You can now sell off the extra
stuff you've gotten in year one

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.720
to reduce your cost of buying
that.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.500
So what should you do in year
one?

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.288
That's exactly what you were
thinking.

00:29:11.288 --> 00:29:12.609
You just didn't quite say it
right.

00:29:12.609 --> 00:29:14.380
So what should you do in year 1?
 

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:20.849
Student:
&gt;

00:29:20.849 --> 00:29:23.079
Prof: I sell that.
 

00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:26.380
Okay, I sell.
 

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:32.198
Okay, so I can get to sell 2 of
little pi of 1,

00:29:32.198 --> 00:29:33.210
right?
 

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.829
Because I know how much it
costs me to buy 1 dollar at time

00:29:36.829 --> 00:29:37.328
1 now.
 

00:29:37.328 --> 00:29:40.094
It's that number,
so I'm getting-- so is that

00:29:40.094 --> 00:29:42.230
correct, what I've written here?
 

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.930
That's what you said.
 

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:43.880
That's not quite right.
 

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.078
Yeah.
 

00:29:45.078 --> 00:29:48.887
Student:
If you didn't actually buy 2

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.279
&gt;
 

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:54.234
Prof: Okay,
so this is what he meant to

00:29:54.234 --> 00:29:54.630
say.
 

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.390
So that's fine.
 

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.299
Okay, so that's what you do,
exactly.

00:29:58.299 --> 00:29:59.240
So everybody's following?
 

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.720
You agree with me now, right?
 

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.250
But, you know,
we could plug in for this too,

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.000
by the way.
 

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.568
So pi of 1, we know what that
is.

00:30:07.568 --> 00:30:09.900
Okay, so does everybody see
what's going on here?

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.865
To buy 1 dollar at time 2,
you don't get the whole 2-year

00:30:13.865 --> 00:30:17.125
Treasury, you buy 1/102 of the 2
year Treasury,

00:30:17.125 --> 00:30:20.028
so it costs you that amount of
money.

00:30:20.028 --> 00:30:22.660
But that gives you a little bit
of extra at time 1.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.259
How much extra does it give you?
 

00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:28.144
Well, you've got 2 dollars
extra for every 2-year Treasury,

00:30:28.144 --> 00:30:31.160
but you didn't buy a whole
2-year Treasury.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.759
You bought that fraction of it.
 

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:36.190
So it gives you this much extra
which you now get to sell off,

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.721
so you're going to sell it off
for this price,

00:30:38.721 --> 00:30:39.338
pi (1).
 

00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:43.942
And of course,
we can plug in for pi (1),

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:50.038
by putting 101 down here and
putting 100.1 up here.

00:30:50.038 --> 00:30:54.359
Okay, so that was pretty clear,
right?

00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:57.548
So now any questions about that?
 

00:30:57.548 --> 00:31:05.755
So that's going to be some
number, which I calculated

00:31:05.755 --> 00:31:11.910
again, which happens to be 962,
.962.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.872
So notice, of course,
it's getting cheaper to

00:31:14.872 --> 00:31:18.710
buy--how much does it cost to
buy 1 dollar in year one?

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.380
It's that.
 

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.390
To buy 1 dollar in year 2,
is less.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.119
Now what about pi (3)?
 

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:27.369
How would we get pi (3)?
 

00:31:27.369 --> 00:31:28.809
We'll stop at pi (3).
 

00:31:28.809 --> 00:31:30.048
How would we get pi (3)?
 

00:31:30.048 --> 00:31:32.365
Then we're going to find a very
fast way of computing all these

00:31:32.365 --> 00:31:32.740
numbers.
 

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.940
What's pi (3)?
 

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.328
How would you get that?
 

00:31:35.328 --> 00:31:37.663
Student:
Buy the 3-year bond,

00:31:37.663 --> 00:31:40.200
divided by
&gt;

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.700
Prof: So the 3-year bond
costs 100.3 but we don't need

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.400
all of it.
 

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:53.210
We need 1 over 103 units times
that, okay.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.319
So that's our main cost.
 

00:31:55.319 --> 00:31:57.440
But then what else?
 

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.765
Student:
We need to get - 3 times

00:32:01.765 --> 00:32:04.759
&gt;
 

00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:10.608
Prof: - 3 over 103,
times little pi of 2.

00:32:10.608 --> 00:32:15.088
Right, because we got this
extra stuff that we didn't need.

00:32:15.088 --> 00:32:19.329
Student:
- 3 over 103 of little pi of 1,

00:32:19.329 --> 00:32:21.818
&gt;
 

00:32:21.818 --> 00:32:25.729
Prof: Okay,
so he's saying - 3 times 103 of

00:32:25.729 --> 00:32:29.319
pi of 1, okay,
because we didn't need that.

00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:35.869
So is that the right answer?
 

00:32:35.869 --> 00:32:36.930
It's not the right answer.
 

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.460
It's close.
 

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.910
What did he overlook?
 

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:42.548
So he said, you buy the
three-year bond.

00:32:42.548 --> 00:32:45.509
So by buying the three-year
bond, you're getting--if you

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:48.038
bought the whole three-year
bond, you'd get 3,3,

00:32:48.038 --> 00:32:48.470
103.
 

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.700
You only want 1 at the end,
so you have to divide by 103.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:56.798
Now we get 3 over 103,3 over
103,1, and so he's saying we've

00:32:56.798 --> 00:32:58.960
got two extra payments.
 

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.450
Let's sell them off.
 

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.819
And so he sold them off like
that.

00:33:04.819 --> 00:33:05.788
That's correct.
 

00:33:05.788 --> 00:33:08.498
So he sold them off,
so this one he sold off at pi

00:33:08.498 --> 00:33:10.818
(2) and this one he sold off at
pi (1),

00:33:10.818 --> 00:33:14.144
so he's making use of the fact
that we've already found out

00:33:14.144 --> 00:33:15.750
this price and this price.
 

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.900
But actually,
that's slightly--okay,

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.523
but we're talking about not
what you would do talking to the

00:33:21.523 --> 00:33:22.200
banker.
 

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.660
We're talking about what the
banker would do,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.220
and he's got to trade in the
Treasury market.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.259
So how's this guy going to do
this?

00:33:27.259 --> 00:33:31.786
The banker and the Treasury
market now, this Pi over 2

00:33:31.786 --> 00:33:36.142
dollars, he's going to have to
hold this complicated

00:33:36.142 --> 00:33:39.730
portfolio--what's he going to do
to--?

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.430
He's going to have to combine
the 1 and the 2-year to do this

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.328
thing and then the 1-year to
undo that thing.

00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:50.046
So it's actually going to
be--so in terms of trading,

00:33:50.046 --> 00:33:54.119
if you just had to trade
Treasuries, what would you do?

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:55.529
So this is the correct formula.
 

00:33:55.529 --> 00:33:58.617
That's correct and we can
figure out what that is,

00:33:58.617 --> 00:33:59.058
okay.
 

00:33:59.058 --> 00:34:04.119
And so the correct formula is
91.68.

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:08.780
That's .917.
 

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.391
Okay, but you see what you've
done is, these are the kind of

00:34:12.391 --> 00:34:15.880
fictitious things that Irving
Fisher has told us to do.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.967
What you're really doing in the
market is trading the

00:34:17.967 --> 00:34:18.489
Treasuries.
 

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:20.360
So here, you've traded a
Treasury.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.250
You've bought 1 over 103 units
of a 3-year Treasury.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:27.510
Now what else should you do?
 

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.809
You've got to trade Treasuries.
 

00:34:28.809 --> 00:34:33.530
How can you sell off this
amount of money in year 2?

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.255
You have to sell some
Treasuries to do that,

00:34:36.255 --> 00:34:37.840
so what would you sell?
 

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.239
Student:
The 2-year coupon.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:48.623
Prof: The 2 year coupon
bond, and so how much of that

00:34:48.623 --> 00:34:51.039
would you sell?
 

00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:57.920
Well, this is the amount of
money you have to get.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:04.518
The 2-year coupon bond delivers
how much money?

00:35:04.518 --> 00:35:08.005
It delivers 102,
so if you did 1 over 102,

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:12.000
you would get one,
so you have to divide this by

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.679
102.
 

00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:24.940
Okay, and that you multiply by
the price, which is 100.2.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.889
Okay, so there's that term,
right?

00:35:28.889 --> 00:35:30.469
So what have we done here?
 

00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:33.139
We've had to sell off this
amount of money.

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:35.260
So how can you sell off this
amount of money?

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.119
Well, by selling 1 over 102 2
year Treasuries,

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:40.983
you're selling off 1 dollar,
but you don't want to sell off

00:35:40.983 --> 00:35:42.313
1 dollar,
you want to sell off something

00:35:42.313 --> 00:35:44.039
smaller than 1 dollar,
so it's that amount.

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:46.469
So you're selling that amount
of 2 year Treasuries.

00:35:46.469 --> 00:35:50.710
But now what do you have to do?
 

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.384
Now, you see,
you've bought some 1-year

00:35:54.384 --> 00:35:58.639
dollars by getting the 3-year
coupon bond.

00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:01.119
But by selling the 2-year
coupon bond,

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:03.349
you've made some promises in
year one,

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:05.635
so you've got to net out all
those things and do the right

00:36:05.635 --> 00:36:07.119
thing on the one-year coupon
bond,

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:08.110
right?
 

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.980
So that looks a little
complicated, but you can

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.789
obviously do it by algebra.
 

00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:14.960
So everybody following?
 

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.157
You're not following what the
right thing to do is,

00:36:17.157 --> 00:36:19.179
but let's just say in words
what we've done.

00:36:19.179 --> 00:36:22.148
In words, what we've done is
we've said, there are things you

00:36:22.148 --> 00:36:23.880
can actually trade on the
market.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.869
Those are the Treasuries.
 

00:36:24.869 --> 00:36:27.769
Those are our benchmark
securities.

00:36:27.769 --> 00:36:32.030
Let's call them benchmarks.
 

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.847
Now what we're interested in is
some other maybe fictitious

00:36:35.847 --> 00:36:37.889
securities or new securities.
 

00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:40.784
The price of the zeros,
those are the basic building

00:36:40.784 --> 00:36:43.791
blocks that will help us
evaluate the present value of

00:36:43.791 --> 00:36:44.869
any investment.
 

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:48.514
So the reason why we know these
prices is because we can

00:36:48.514 --> 00:36:51.498
replicate them by trading only
the benchmarks,

00:36:51.498 --> 00:36:53.090
only the Treasuries.
 

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:56.469
So to get the 1-year zero,
we just buy us the correct

00:36:56.469 --> 00:36:58.550
fraction of 1 year Treasuries.
 

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.873
To get the 2-year zero,
we have to buy the correct

00:37:01.873 --> 00:37:06.010
fraction of 2 year Treasuries
and sell the correct fraction of

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.090
1 year Treasuries,
and that gets us that thing.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:13.298
So we've replicated the 2-year
zero by a portfolio consisting

00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:17.016
of being long the 2 year
Treasury and short the 1-year

00:37:17.016 --> 00:37:17.929
Treasury.
 

00:37:17.929 --> 00:37:19.920
Right?
 

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.541
To get the 3-year zero coupon,
we have to buy the 3-year

00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:27.425
Treasury,
sell the 2-year Treasury and do

00:37:27.425 --> 00:37:30.934
something complicated that we
haven't quite figured out yet

00:37:30.934 --> 00:37:34.639
with the 1-year Treasury,
and that will duplicate the 3

00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:35.380
year zero.
 

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.420
And then we'll just add up the
cost of that portfolio that

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.820
replicates this,
and that must be the price of

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.940
that thing, okay?
 

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.170
So that's what we're doing.
 

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.530
Any questions about that?
 

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.099
Are you following this?
 

00:37:49.099 --> 00:37:50.469
Yes?
 

00:37:50.469 --> 00:37:53.079
Student:
Just to clarify,

00:37:53.079 --> 00:37:58.050
so pi of 1 is today's price for
1 dollar at time 2 or...?

00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:59.650
Prof: Time 1.
 

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:04.099
Today is 0, so pi of 1 is what
you pay at time 0 to get 1

00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:05.610
dollar at time 1.
 

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:10.288
pi of 2 is what you pay today
at time 0 to get 1 dollar at

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:11.518
time 2, okay?
 

00:38:11.518 --> 00:38:15.802
So knowing those little pis,
you can evaluate the price of

00:38:15.802 --> 00:38:20.387
anything, just by multiplying
the little pis by the cash flows

00:38:20.387 --> 00:38:21.739
in the future.
 

00:38:21.739 --> 00:38:24.264
And now the trick--this is the
trick we're going to see over

00:38:24.264 --> 00:38:26.739
and over and over again--
the subtlety in finance is that

00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:28.869
they don't just tell you what
the little pis are.

00:38:28.869 --> 00:38:31.570
You have to figure that out
yourself, okay?

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.829
And so how are you going to
figure out the little pis?

00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:36.639
Well, you know the Treasuries.
 

00:38:36.639 --> 00:38:38.617
You can trade the Treasuries,
and you know what those prices

00:38:38.617 --> 00:38:38.820
are.
 

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.159
You can see it on the market.
 

00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:43.300
So by combining the Treasuries
in a very clever way,

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.275
you can end up getting the
prices of all the zero coupon

00:38:48.275 --> 00:38:50.400
bonds,
the things that pay just 1

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.360
dollar at the end.
 

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.380
Why are they called zero coupon
bonds?

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.494
Because it's like--you just get
principal at the end,

00:38:56.494 --> 00:38:58.771
of 1 dollar,
without any coupons in the

00:38:58.771 --> 00:38:59.429
middle.
 

00:38:59.429 --> 00:39:02.648
So the little pis are called
the zero coupon prices,

00:39:02.648 --> 00:39:05.677
because the payments are just 1
dollar--you know,

00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:08.579
pi (3) is the price of 1 dollar
at time 3.

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:11.550
It's as if there was a bond
that paid no coupons and paid 1

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.190
dollar of principal at time 3.
 

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:17.405
So the little pis are the
prices of zero coupon bonds of

00:39:17.405 --> 00:39:21.159
various maturities,
and those aren't really traded

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:23.230
directly in the market.
 

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.847
What's traded directly in the
market, where pieces of paper

00:39:26.847 --> 00:39:29.280
change hands,
are the Treasury bonds.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.306
But everybody,
every day is calculating these

00:39:32.306 --> 00:39:35.556
zero coupon prices,
because that's what they need

00:39:35.556 --> 00:39:38.731
to do to evaluate every single
project that they might

00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:41.545
conceivably do that day,
and decide whether it's a good

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:42.530
project or a bad project.
 

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.780
Is it worth the price or not
worth the price?

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.143
And it's done by the principle
of replication,

00:39:48.143 --> 00:39:49.489
just as we said.
 

00:39:49.489 --> 00:39:52.869
So this formula is going to be
slightly complicated.

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:55.349
I don't know whether it's worth
writing down.

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:57.940
So we've got,
buying the 3-year Treasury,

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.690
the right amount of that.
 

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.568
Then we have to sell a certain
amount of the 2-year Treasury,

00:40:03.568 --> 00:40:06.090
because we accumulated extra
coupons.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:10.021
But now we're also going to be
able to sell a certain amount of

00:40:10.021 --> 00:40:13.255
the 1-year Treasuries,
and so how much is that going

00:40:13.255 --> 00:40:13.889
to be?
 

00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:15.980
It's going to be some formula,
okay.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.528
So it's going to keep track of
everything we did and get a

00:40:18.528 --> 00:40:19.199
formula here.
 

00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:22.190
So I'm actually not going to
bother,

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.110
I think--I was going to write
down the formula,

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:28.010
but it'll take 3 minutes to
work it out--

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.442
because there's a much faster
way of getting all these

00:40:31.442 --> 00:40:32.090
numbers.
 

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.630
But is everybody with me here?
 

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.521
You all understand how I could
get this number if I wanted to

00:40:37.521 --> 00:40:38.679
do the work to get it?
 

00:40:38.679 --> 00:40:42.378
I'd figure out I had to
sell--I'd sell some of the 1

00:40:42.378 --> 00:40:45.860
year and buy some of the 2
year--I'd do something

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.820
complicated here,
okay?

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.612
Sorry, I would do something
with the 1 year Treasury here to

00:40:51.612 --> 00:40:55.664
compensate for the fact that the
3-year thing I bought is paying

00:40:55.664 --> 00:40:56.949
me coupons here.
 

00:40:56.949 --> 00:41:00.690
The 2-year thing I sold is
reducing some of those coupons,

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.880
and so it's only the net coupon
that I can sell,

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.820
and I'm going to sell that by
selling the 1 year Treasury,

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.349
okay?
 

00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:09.884
So that's how I would get the
number there,

00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:13.202
and I added the cost of doing
all these things together,

00:41:13.202 --> 00:41:14.349
and I get .917.
 

00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:19.610
So you're silent,
but are you following it?

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.219
Who can I--okay.
 

00:41:21.219 --> 00:41:25.257
So it's too complicated to just
figure this stuff out all the

00:41:25.257 --> 00:41:25.730
time.
 

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.942
So instead, there's a very fast
algorithm that you can do almost

00:41:29.942 --> 00:41:33.954
instantly, and that's why it's
such a triviality to calculate

00:41:33.954 --> 00:41:35.760
these numbers ever day.
 

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.059
So it's called the principle of
duality.

00:41:39.059 --> 00:41:42.320
You go backwards,
and you say to yourself,

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.385
"What I want is pi (1),
pi (2), pi (3),

00:41:47.385 --> 00:41:51.670
pi (4), and pi (5),
and I've started to figure out

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.664
what the replicating--
" so these are the prices

00:41:54.664 --> 00:41:55.210
of zeros.
 

00:41:55.210 --> 00:42:03.420
Prices of zero coupon bonds.
 

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:09.690
That's what I want--want prices
of zero coupon bonds.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.583
I have the prices of the
Treasuries and the way I'm

00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:15.652
figuring out the prices of the
zero coupon bonds is by

00:42:15.652 --> 00:42:16.579
replication.
 

00:42:16.579 --> 00:42:21.135
Now if somebody stupidly,
as happened 50 and 60 years

00:42:21.135 --> 00:42:24.175
ago,
fairly routinely,

00:42:24.175 --> 00:42:32.876
if somebody was willing to give
me 1 dollar in year 3 and only

00:42:32.876 --> 00:42:38.862
ask 90 cents for it,
then I would be able to lock in

00:42:38.862 --> 00:42:39.690
a profit.
 

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.650
How could I lock in a profit?
 

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:46.175
Because I would just--he's
willing to give this to me for a

00:42:46.175 --> 00:42:49.610
low price of 90 cents instead of
91 cents.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.590
So what can I do?
 

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:55.858
Let's say he's willing--he'd
pay me, let's say more

00:42:55.858 --> 00:42:59.360
likely--let's say he'd pay me 93
cents.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.159
Say some guy came to me,
I'm the banker,

00:43:01.159 --> 00:43:03.829
and he says,
"I'll pay you 93 cents

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:07.730
today to get 1 dollar in year
3," in other words,

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.449
for a 3 year zero.
 

00:43:09.449 --> 00:43:12.699
Well, I'd say,
"That's wonderful."

00:43:12.699 --> 00:43:17.346
I'll sell them this promise in
year 3, of 1 dollar for 93

00:43:17.346 --> 00:43:18.010
cents.
 

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.148
Then with that 93 cents,
I'll only use 91.7 of those

00:43:22.148 --> 00:43:26.369
cents and I'll go out and buy
the 3-year Treasury.

00:43:26.369 --> 00:43:29.630
I'll sell some of the 2 year
Treasury and I'll sell a little

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.510
bit more of the 1 year Treasury.
 

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:35.666
And that portfolio which I've
done by doing that will pay me

00:43:35.666 --> 00:43:39.525
exactly 1 dollar in year 3,
enabling me to keep my promise

00:43:39.525 --> 00:43:42.101
to him,
but it will only have cost me

00:43:42.101 --> 00:43:42.949
91.7 cents.
 

00:43:42.949 --> 00:43:45.630
So I'll have made a 1.3-cent
profit for sure,

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.070
with no chance--it's a pure
arbitrage.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.231
I made a profit of 1.3 cents
with no chance of losing any

00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:53.271
money,
okay, because I've done all the

00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:55.663
transactions today,
and the government's going to

00:43:55.663 --> 00:43:56.550
keep its promises.
 

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.764
I don't have to worry about the
government giving me the money,

00:43:59.764 --> 00:44:02.927
and so I'll be able to turn the
money over to that guy in year

00:44:02.927 --> 00:44:03.239
3.
 

00:44:03.239 --> 00:44:05.809
Meanwhile, he's given me his 93
cents.

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:08.780
So if you want to do an
arbitrage and make your profit,

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.539
you have to figure out what the
replicating portfolio is,

00:44:11.539 --> 00:44:14.159
and the replicating portfolio
also tells you the price.

00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:17.554
But it takes a long time to
figure out what all these

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:20.099
arbitrage-replicating portfolios
are.

00:44:20.099 --> 00:44:22.849
And maybe nobody's coming to
you and offering a stupid deal

00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:23.420
like that.
 

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.594
So you don't need to figure
out--so the principle of duality

00:44:27.594 --> 00:44:29.751
is,
you don't need to figure out

00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:33.340
the replicating portfolio to
figure out what the pi (1),

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.059
pi (2), pi (3),
pi (4), and pi (5) are.

00:44:36.059 --> 00:44:39.702
I can find those numbers now
just by clicking a button in

00:44:39.702 --> 00:44:42.693
Excel, trivially,
without bothering to find the

00:44:42.693 --> 00:44:44.449
replicating portfolios.
 

00:44:44.449 --> 00:44:47.894
Then if some,
you know, bad trader comes to

00:44:47.894 --> 00:44:52.489
me and offers me 93 cents for
the 3 year zero coupon,

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:55.184
then I'll figure out the
replicating portfolio and take

00:44:55.184 --> 00:44:58.030
advantage of that offer to make
a pure profit for sure.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:01.503
So what I want to show you know
is how to get pi (1) through pi

00:45:01.503 --> 00:45:05.090
(5) without having to go through
this complicated calculation.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.320
And it just reasons backwards,
okay.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:13.239
So please interrupt if you're
not following this logic.

00:45:13.239 --> 00:45:17.594
So you reason like this:
we don't know what pi (1)

00:45:17.594 --> 00:45:21.170
through pi (5) are,
but if you did know them,

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.735
you'd be able to price the very
bonds that the market is

00:45:24.735 --> 00:45:25.449
trading.
 

00:45:25.449 --> 00:45:32.159
So you'd know that 100.1 had to
equal 101 times pi of (1).

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:34.942
And you'd know that 100.2,
the 2 year zero coupon

00:45:34.942 --> 00:45:36.739
[correction: Treasury]
bond,

00:45:36.739 --> 00:45:46.864
whose price is 100.2,
would have to be 2 times pi of

00:45:46.864 --> 00:45:51.929
1 102 times pi of 2,
right?

00:45:51.929 --> 00:45:54.701
Because pi of 1,
remember, is the price you pay

00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:56.929
today for 1 dollar 1 year from
now.

00:45:56.929 --> 00:45:59.373
101 dollars,
1 year from now,

00:45:59.373 --> 00:46:04.349
costs 101--if you knew pi (1),
this would be the price.

00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:08.074
If you knew pi (1) and pi (2),
you could figure out the price

00:46:08.074 --> 00:46:11.119
of the zero coupon bond--
I mean, of the 2 year Treasury

00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:13.309
bond,
because 2 dollars at time 1

00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:17.260
cost 2 pi (1) and 102 dollars at
time 2 cost 102 pi (2).

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:26.414
And then the 3 year is 100.3 =
3 times pi (1) 3 times pi (2)

00:46:26.414 --> 00:46:31.070
plus 103 times pi of 3,
etc.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.353
Then we can go down to the
last--well, I'll just write them

00:46:33.353 --> 00:46:33.590
all.
 

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:46.860
It doesn't take a second.
 

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:55.166
Okay, and the last one is,
100.5 = 5 times pi (1) plus 5

00:46:55.166 --> 00:47:02.719
pi (2) plus 5 pi (3) plus 5 pi
(4) plus 105 pi (5),

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.079
okay?
 

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:07.539
So you don't know the little
pis, but you do know these

00:47:07.539 --> 00:47:09.998
prices,
because the market tells you,

00:47:09.998 --> 00:47:12.760
and you know the payoffs of all
the bonds,

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.829
because that's just written on
them,

00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:17.940
literally, so you can just read
what the payoffs are.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.639
You know the government's going
to keep its promise.

00:47:19.639 --> 00:47:22.764
So rather than doing this
complicated stuff,

00:47:22.764 --> 00:47:26.760
trying to figure out the pis,
assume you had the pis.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.985
And then if you had the pis,
it would tell you what the

00:47:28.985 --> 00:47:30.139
prices of everything were.
 

00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:33.590
So if you guessed the wrong
pis, you'd get the wrong prices.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:36.186
But basically,
you're solving 5 equations and

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:39.139
5 unknowns, and that's what
Excel is so good at.

00:47:39.139 --> 00:47:41.650
It's going to start with a wild
guess of the pis,

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.630
and then it's going to move
around the pis until you match

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:45.730
all these prices.
 

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.518
And since it's 5 equations and
5 unknowns, and they're all

00:47:48.518 --> 00:47:50.918
linearly independent,
it'll be a unique set of pis

00:47:50.918 --> 00:47:52.239
that it will calculate.
 

00:47:52.239 --> 00:47:57.407
But that 1 set of pis has to be
the replicating portfolio

00:47:57.407 --> 00:48:00.163
prices,
because there's only 1 set of

00:48:00.163 --> 00:48:03.639
pis that are going to work and
solve these equations,

00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:06.420
namely the ones you got by the
replicating argument.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:11.083
So we can figure out the pis by
solving 5 equations and 5

00:48:11.083 --> 00:48:13.750
unknowns, so that's what I do.
 

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:18.789
So if you guess the pis,
1,1, 1,1, 1,

00:48:18.789 --> 00:48:23.969
any questions about what I'm
doing?

00:48:23.969 --> 00:48:27.726
If you write 1,1,
1,1, 1, you're going to get

00:48:27.726 --> 00:48:29.349
prices, you know.
 

00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:32.302
For the first one,
it will just be 101,

00:48:32.302 --> 00:48:36.110
and for the 2 year,
it will be 2 times 1 102 times

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:37.199
1, is 104.
 

00:48:37.199 --> 00:48:38.958
For the third one,
with all the pis 1,

00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:41.809
which is obviously not the
right thing, it would be 3 3 3.

00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:45.710
That's 109, so those are bad
prices.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:49.000
We're trying to match what the
market says the prices are.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.398
So all I do is,
I subtract the market prices

00:48:51.398 --> 00:48:54.018
we're trying to match from the
actual prices.

00:48:54.018 --> 00:48:57.306
I look at what the error is,
which we're trying make 0,

00:48:57.306 --> 00:48:58.889
then I square the error.
 

00:48:58.889 --> 00:49:03.215
And then presumably this was
adding the error,

00:49:03.215 --> 00:49:04.849
sum C16 to G16.
 

00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:08.521
I added the error,
and so I now want to do my

00:49:08.521 --> 00:49:09.690
Excel thing.
 

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:15.710
Hopefully--I haven't done this,
but let's--it's got to work.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:21.260
Okay, so minimize, good, that.
 

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:25.625
Such that by changing
cells--which are the cells I

00:49:25.625 --> 00:49:27.139
want to change.
 

00:49:27.139 --> 00:49:28.719
I want to change the pis.
 

00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:32.389
Those are the ones that are
wrong, so I do that.

00:49:32.389 --> 00:49:38.920
So I'm minimizing the squared
error by changing the pis,

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.889
B18, okay, and I solve.
 

00:49:41.889 --> 00:49:42.949
Okay, and I've done it.
 

00:49:42.949 --> 00:49:44.530
And there is the answer.
 

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:52.436
So you notice that I got the
same prices that I told you

00:49:52.436 --> 00:49:59.480
about before by replication,
.991, .962, and .917,

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.630
etc.
 

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.409
So we got the pis.
 

00:50:02.409 --> 00:50:04.420
So that's step 1.
 

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:08.965
All right, so that's what every
single financial firm in the

00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:13.436
entire world does every single
morning, and sometimes every

00:50:13.436 --> 00:50:14.670
single hour.
 

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:24.190
So are there any questions
about what we just did?

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.260
You have to do this in the
problem set.

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:32.300
Is there anything puzzling you
about this?

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.735
Okay, now I'm going to start
deducing all kinds of surprising

00:50:36.735 --> 00:50:38.139
things from this.
 

00:50:38.139 --> 00:50:41.333
I hope that you'll be
surprised, but I want to make

00:50:41.333 --> 00:50:44.719
sure you've got the concept of
what we've done now.

00:50:44.719 --> 00:50:48.110
Anybody puzzled by it?
 

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.722
Okay, so somehow,
Fisher's pi (1),

00:50:51.722 --> 00:50:56.650
pi (2), pi (3),
pi (4), pi (5) are going to be

00:50:56.650 --> 00:51:01.577
deducible from what's going on
in the markets,

00:51:01.577 --> 00:51:03.329
every day.
 

00:51:03.329 --> 00:51:06.449
All right, so let's ask one
more thing that's deducible.

00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:13.536
Suppose I go to a bank and say,
"I promise to give you 1

00:51:13.536 --> 00:51:15.780
dollar in year 2.
 

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:21.239
How many dollars will you give
me in year 3?"

00:51:21.239 --> 00:51:25.449
What do you think the bank's
going to tell me?

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:27.650
Every bank will give me the
same answer,

00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:31.880
if that yield curve--given this
morning,

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.760
and that was this morning's
yield curve,

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.422
if I ask every bank in the
world, "I'll give you 1

00:51:36.422 --> 00:51:39.896
dollar in year 2,
you tell me how many dollars

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:43.670
you'll be willing to give me--
" So what am I doing?

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.829
I'm saying, "I promise
today to hand over to you 1

00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:49.581
dollar in year 2,
and you know I'm going to keep

00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:50.460
my promise.
 

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.197
And in exchange,
I want a promise from you to

00:51:53.197 --> 00:51:56.559
give me a certain number of
dollars in year 3."

00:51:56.559 --> 00:52:00.840
How many dollars is the bank
going to offer to give me in

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.530
year 3?
 

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:04.809
Every bank will give the same
answer, and what will that be?

00:52:04.809 --> 00:52:12.293
So the thing I'm asking,
is, I'm asking for what's

00:52:12.293 --> 00:52:17.639
called the forward interest
rate.

00:52:17.639 --> 00:52:20.246
So we've got these things,
which are obviously very

00:52:20.246 --> 00:52:21.289
important numbers.
 

00:52:21.289 --> 00:52:22.619
Those are the most important
things.

00:52:22.619 --> 00:52:25.001
Fisher would say those are the
prices you use to get

00:52:25.001 --> 00:52:25.610
everything.
 

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.842
But now I want to say
something, I'm going to ask

00:52:28.842 --> 00:52:32.010
another important thing,
almost as important.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.960
I want the forward rate.
 

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:40.391
So 1 i_1--
Student:

00:52:40.391 --> 00:52:40.849
We can't see that.
 

00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:41.590
Prof: You can't see that.
 

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.150
I'm glad you pointed that--can
you see this?

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.800
Student: Yes.
 

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.449
Prof: Okay.
 

00:52:46.449 --> 00:52:48.650
The cameraman told me this
board was great.

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:58.157
But anyway, so how about,
I'll write 1 i_1^(f),

00:52:58.157 --> 00:53:05.458
forward, is--by the way,
am I calling that 1

00:53:05.458 --> 00:53:11.739
i_0 or 1
i_1?

00:53:11.739 --> 00:53:18.360
Sorry, just want to get my
notation straight.

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:29.067
Okay, so let's call 1
i_0 is the--1

00:53:29.067 --> 00:53:44.155
i_t is the number of
dollars at t 1 in exchange for 1

00:53:44.155 --> 00:53:48.050
dollar at t.
 

00:53:48.050 --> 00:54:03.480
So this is the number of
dollars at t 1 agreed today.

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:08.378
So we agreed today that you're
going to pay this many dollars

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:12.380
at time t 1 in exchange for 1
dollar at time t.

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.835
So this is like the interest
rate that you might pay at time

00:54:15.835 --> 00:54:16.070
t.
 

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:18.286
You give up a dollar at time t,
how much do you get at time t

00:54:18.286 --> 00:54:18.619
plus 1?
 

00:54:18.619 --> 00:54:19.840
The interest rate.
 

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.510
But we're not there yet.
 

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:23.940
We're agreeing to it today.
 

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.840
So today we're agreeing to this
interest rate.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.369
So what is the interest rate
we'd agree to today,

00:54:29.369 --> 00:54:30.949
so we've locked in the rate?
 

00:54:30.949 --> 00:54:33.739
When it comes to time t,
one guy's going to hand over

00:54:33.739 --> 00:54:36.003
the dollar,
and when it comes to time t 1,

00:54:36.003 --> 00:54:38.780
the other guy is going to give
back this many dollars.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.010
So what is the rate we would
lock in today?

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:43.670
It's called the period t
interest rate forward,

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.617
because we're locking it in
today for a forward period of

00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:48.612
time,
but it's really just the normal

00:54:48.612 --> 00:54:50.440
time t interest rate for one
year,

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.010
but we're locking it in today.
 

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.989
So what would we lock in today?
 

00:54:55.989 --> 00:54:57.518
How do we compute that?
 

00:54:57.518 --> 00:54:58.909
We already know what that
number is.

00:54:58.909 --> 00:55:00.500
What is it?
 

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.429
Yes?
 

00:55:01.429 --> 00:55:03.612
Student:
It's the ratio of pi (2) over

00:55:03.612 --> 00:55:04.059
pi (3).
 

00:55:04.059 --> 00:55:06.300
Prof: Well,
I put t here,

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.110
so something like that.
 

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:10.280
Student: pi t over t 1.
 

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.360
Prof: Okay, exactly.
 

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:16.409
That's pi (t) over pi (t 1).
 

00:55:16.409 --> 00:55:17.230
That's it exactly.
 

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.000
So why is that?
 

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.440
Student:
It's a tradeoff between the

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.369
dollar t, t 1.
 

00:55:22.369 --> 00:55:24.371
Prof: Right,
so all we're doing is this

00:55:24.371 --> 00:55:25.039
forward rate.
 

00:55:25.039 --> 00:55:29.864
We're exchanging time t dollars
for time t 1 dollars at this

00:55:29.864 --> 00:55:30.518
ratio.
 

00:55:30.518 --> 00:55:33.800
But we're committing to do it
today.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.407
But today we already know what
the ratio is of time t dollars

00:55:37.407 --> 00:55:38.730
to time t 1 dollars.
 

00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:43.050
We know that pi (2)--in fact,
we know what it is.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:48.750
pi (2) happens to be .962.
 

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.980
That's a bigger number than pi
(3).

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:54.105
From today's point of view,
1 dollar at time 2 is worth

00:55:54.105 --> 00:55:55.900
more than 1 dollar at time 3.
 

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:59.779
We already know how much more 1
dollar at time 2 is worth than 1

00:55:59.779 --> 00:56:00.949
dollar at time 3.
 

00:56:00.949 --> 00:56:04.039
It's the ratio pi (2) over pi
(3).

00:56:04.039 --> 00:56:06.831
So that ratio,
as he says, pi (2) over pi (3),

00:56:06.831 --> 00:56:10.184
has to be exactly the exchange
rate that the people are

00:56:10.184 --> 00:56:11.550
agreeing to today.
 

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.730
That's what pi (2) and pi (3)
mean.

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:16.289
If you express it as an
interest rate,

00:56:16.289 --> 00:56:18.710
it's 1 the forward interest
rate.

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:22.119
That ratio is 1
i^(f)_t.

00:56:22.119 --> 00:56:26.539
Okay, any questions about that?
 

00:56:26.539 --> 00:56:28.119
Yes?
 

00:56:28.119 --> 00:56:31.304
Student:
What happens if your yield

00:56:31.304 --> 00:56:33.480
curve is downward sloping?
 

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.032
Prof: If the yield curve
is downward sloping,

00:56:37.032 --> 00:56:37.449
yes.
 

00:56:37.449 --> 00:56:40.213
Student:
Do you agree to give them 1

00:56:40.213 --> 00:56:42.978
dollar in year 2,
they give you less than 1

00:56:42.978 --> 00:56:44.360
dollar in year 3?
 

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:48.681
Prof: Okay,
so you've made a little mistake

00:56:48.681 --> 00:56:50.268
in your premise.
 

00:56:50.268 --> 00:56:52.260
Good question,
but let me phrase your question

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.559
a little differently,
so you see the answer to it.

00:56:54.559 --> 00:57:06.570
The yield curve was almost flat
in year 2000.

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:08.826
So in the year 2000,
the yield curve was almost

00:57:08.826 --> 00:57:09.170
flat.
 

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:14.005
In fact, there are moments
where the yield curve seems to

00:57:14.005 --> 00:57:14.869
go down.
 

00:57:14.869 --> 00:57:22.949
So if the yield curve goes
down, what does that mean?

00:57:22.949 --> 00:57:28.409
Does that mean--between year 6
and year 7, the yield curve went

00:57:28.409 --> 00:57:30.170
down a little bit.
 

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:39.670
Does that mean that pi (7) is
less than pi (6)?

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:43.300
Maybe, but it couldn't really
be that way.

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.018
Okay, so let me translate his
question.

00:57:45.018 --> 00:57:48.331
He's saying,
look, yield curves very often

00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:49.219
are flat.
 

00:57:49.219 --> 00:57:51.800
Mostly they go up,
very often they're flat.

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.230
Sometimes they even start to go
down.

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:59.349
He said, "That worries me
that maybe pi (7) is less than

00:57:59.349 --> 00:58:00.630
pi (6)."
 

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:03.360
But that could never happen.
 

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.916
That would be crazy,
because that would mean that

00:58:04.916 --> 00:58:06.637
there would be a negative
interest rate in the future,

00:58:06.637 --> 00:58:08.000
and with money,
that can never happen.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.280
You can store the money.
 

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.000
No one's ever going to ask for
a negative interest rate.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.519
He could just keep the dollar
and keep it in his pocket.

00:58:14.519 --> 00:58:15.639
Why is that?
 

00:58:15.639 --> 00:58:23.960
Remember, pi (6) = 1 over (1
the 6 year yield) to the 6^(th)

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.090
power.
 

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:33.840
And pi (7) = 1 over (1 the 7
year yield) to the 7^(th) power.

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:38.956
So it could be that Y(7) is
less than Y(6) as it is there,

00:58:38.956 --> 00:58:41.829
and yet pi (7) is still small.
 

00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:45.110
Could be that Y(7) is less than
Y(6),

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:47.378
as it is over there,
but because you're taking this

00:58:47.378 --> 00:58:49.739
to the 7^(th) power and this to
the 6^(th) power,

00:58:49.739 --> 00:58:52.559
you still have pi (7) less than
pi (6).

00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:54.811
So just because the yield curve
is downward sloping,

00:58:54.811 --> 00:58:56.710
doesn't mean that the pis are
going down.

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:57.630
The pis could never go down.
 

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.510
The pis are always going to go
up.

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:03.170
So excellent question.
 

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.360
Any other questions?
 

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.389
Okay, so we could get the i's.
 

00:59:08.389 --> 00:59:11.960
The i's will typically be going
up.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.699
Suppose the yield curve is
going up, by the way.

00:59:14.699 --> 00:59:26.760
Will the i's be going up faster
or slower than the yields?

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:31.041
Yeah, if this is the yield
curve and I calculate the

00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:35.909
forwards, do you think the
forwards will be going up faster

00:59:35.909 --> 00:59:38.679
or less fast than the yields?
 

00:59:38.679 --> 00:59:41.768
All right, well let's do it in
the example.

00:59:41.768 --> 00:59:47.449
Let's just go back to our
example that we were doing.

00:59:47.449 --> 00:59:50.679
Yield curve spreadsheet, okay.
 

00:59:50.679 --> 00:59:52.030
So maybe I did it here.
 

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:53.230
Hopefully I solved it all.
 

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:56.880
Okay, so here we got the actual
pis.

00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.070
You see the pis are always
declining.

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:07.596
And if we now look at the yield
curve, you can figure out the

01:00:07.596 --> 01:00:08.599
yield.
 

01:00:08.599 --> 01:00:10.579
How can you figure out the
yield?

01:00:10.579 --> 01:00:13.300
Because you solve that formula
we gave at the very beginning.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:18.469
You take the price of the--I
guess I've erased it now.

01:00:18.469 --> 01:00:20.780
Okay, you know what the price
is.

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.730
To figure out the yield on the
3 year,

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:28.679
we just plug in 1 Y of 3,1 Y of
3 squared,

01:00:28.679 --> 01:00:31.920
1 over 1 Y of 3 squared,
1 over 1 Y of 3 cubed,

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920
and that gives us the yield.
 

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.539
Remember, that's how the
newspaper reporter figured out

01:00:35.539 --> 01:00:36.170
the yields.
 

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:40.001
So I figured out the yields in
the spreadsheet down here,

01:00:40.001 --> 01:00:41.849
and these are the yields.
 

01:00:41.849 --> 01:00:43.960
So this is what would appear in
the newspaper.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.349
The 1-year yield is a little
under 1 percent.

01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:48.420
The 2-year yield is a little
under 2 percent.

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.179
The 3-year is a little under 3
percent.

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:53.373
The 4-year is a little under 4
percent, and the 5-year is a

01:00:53.373 --> 01:00:54.750
little under 5 percent.
 

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.150
Those are the yields.
 

01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:57.869
So what if we did the forwards?
 

01:00:57.869 --> 01:01:00.625
The forwards,
remember, are just the ratios

01:01:00.625 --> 01:01:01.610
of these pis.
 

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:02.530
What are the forwards?
 

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:04.550
They're down here.
 

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:07.059
So what do they do?
 

01:01:07.059 --> 01:01:11.838
Sorry, I don't know how I did
that, but here are the forwards,

01:01:11.838 --> 01:01:12.780
over here.
 

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:18.110
So the forwards have gone up
much faster than the yields.

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:22.150
They went from .008 percent,
which is the same as that one,

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:25.750
to 2.9, which is bigger than
2.8, to 5,

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:28.590
which is way more than 3.8,
to 7.2,

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:31.070
which is way more than that,
to 9.6,

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:32.449
which is way more than that.
 

01:01:32.449 --> 01:01:35.869
So the forwards went up much
faster than the yields.

01:01:35.869 --> 01:01:39.059
So why is that obviously going
to be the case whenever the

01:01:39.059 --> 01:01:40.849
yield curve is upward sloping?
 

01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:46.969
So if we go back to our picture
here.

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:50.190
We go back to our picture.
 

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.068
If the yield curve were
completely flat,

01:01:52.068 --> 01:01:54.380
what do you think the forward
yields would be?

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.313
This is just common sense to
see if you have any idea what's

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:57.860
going on.
 

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.286
If you think about batting
averages and how somebody's

01:02:00.286 --> 01:02:01.980
average changes each time he
bats--

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:05.010
if the yield curve is flat,
like in 2006,

01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:08.239
the forwards are going to
basically be flat.

01:02:08.239 --> 01:02:11.163
But if the yield curve is
upward sloping,

01:02:11.163 --> 01:02:15.329
then the forward yields are
going to go up much faster.

01:02:15.329 --> 01:02:20.840
So why is that?
 

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:35.420
Okay, well, remember,
the yields, you know--

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.992
when you do a 5 year coupon
bond, you're discounting all the

01:02:38.992 --> 01:02:41.320
cash flows,
the previous 4 cash flows,

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.768
using the same yield to
discount them all.

01:02:43.768 --> 01:02:47.889
So if you go from year 4 to
year 5, and you have to raise

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:50.465
the yield a lot,
it means, you know,

01:02:50.465 --> 01:02:54.440
like if you're a batter,
and your average goes up.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.052
It means the last thing you did
was better than the average of

01:02:57.052 --> 01:02:59.108
what you've done before,
so it's going to be even

01:02:59.108 --> 01:02:59.579
higher.
 

01:02:59.579 --> 01:03:02.568
If your average was .300,
and then you played a series

01:03:02.568 --> 01:03:06.065
against the Red Sox in which you
did very well and your average

01:03:06.065 --> 01:03:08.615
went up to .320,
in that series against the Red

01:03:08.615 --> 01:03:10.297
Sox,
you obviously did even better

01:03:10.297 --> 01:03:11.797
than .320,
because you have to average

01:03:11.797 --> 01:03:14.610
what you did then with what,
your previous .300 to get .320.

01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:17.648
So if the average sort of is
going up, remember the yield is

01:03:17.648 --> 01:03:19.710
the same thing over the whole
history.

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:22.385
If, when you take a longer
history, the average has gone

01:03:22.385 --> 01:03:25.400
up, it must mean that the most
recent thing went up really much

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.130
more, okay?
 

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:29.414
So the 4-year yield is sort of
averaging the payoffs of the

01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:30.320
first 4 years.
 

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.670
The 5-year yield's averaging it
over 5 years.

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.630
So if that yield,
the 5-year yield,

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:36.782
has gone up,
what happened in the 5^(th)

01:03:36.782 --> 01:03:40.152
year must have gone up a lot to
bring the long run average up,

01:03:40.152 --> 01:03:40.650
okay?
 

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.817
So that's why the yield curve's
going to go up much faster

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.025
[correction: the forward rates,
compared to the yield curve,

01:03:43.025 --> 01:03:43.659
are going to go up faster].
 

01:03:43.659 --> 01:03:47.298
Okay, so we know now to
summarize, everybody can look at

01:03:47.298 --> 01:03:49.550
these pictures every single day.
 

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:52.018
From these pictures,
they can deduce the pis.

01:03:52.018 --> 01:03:54.443
That's the crucial variable in
the whole economy,

01:03:54.443 --> 01:03:54.949
the pis.
 

01:03:54.949 --> 01:03:58.929
But a second crucial variable
is the forward yields,

01:03:58.929 --> 01:04:02.204
the 1 i^(f)s,
which you can just get by the

01:04:02.204 --> 01:04:02.829
pis.
 

01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:05.869
Now why are the 1 i^(f)s so
important?

01:04:05.869 --> 01:04:08.550
We know that the pis are
critical, because they evaluate

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:11.329
every project by multiplying the
cash flows by the pis.

01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:14.260
Why are the forwards so
important?

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:19.427
The forwards are so important
because, suppose you believed

01:04:19.427 --> 01:04:24.239
that--so the forwards,
let's go back to what we got.

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:27.800
Let's just look at the numbers
here.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.389
Here are the forwards,
remember, down here.

01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:34.518
Okay, suppose I said to you,
"You tell me."

01:04:34.518 --> 01:04:37.302
You don't know anything about
the economy, maybe,

01:04:37.302 --> 01:04:40.780
but you can read the newspapers
and do mathematics like we've

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:41.940
just been doing.
 

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:48.980
What do you guess the interest
rate's going to be in year 2?

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.529
So this is the 0 year forward,
the 1 year forward,

01:04:51.529 --> 01:04:53.974
the 2 year forward,
the 3 year forward and the 4

01:04:53.974 --> 01:04:54.860
year forward.
 

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.998
If I say in year 2,
"What do you think the

01:04:56.998 --> 01:04:59.943
interest rate--
guess what the interest rate's

01:04:59.943 --> 01:05:02.889
going to be,"
what would you guess?

01:05:02.889 --> 01:05:03.489
Yeah.
 

01:05:03.489 --> 01:05:05.150
Student:
I have a question.

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:09.018
Could you make this all real
interest rates by doing this for

01:05:09.018 --> 01:05:09.469
TIPS?
 

01:05:09.469 --> 01:05:10.730
Prof: Yes.
 

01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:13.974
Right, I could do this real
interest rate by doing it for

01:05:13.974 --> 01:05:14.380
TIPS.
 

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.650
Fisher would say do that.
 

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:20.494
Trouble is, that TIPS are not
traded--they're becoming more

01:05:20.494 --> 01:05:23.079
and more freely traded in the
market.

01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:26.233
They used to be traded
very--people didn't want to

01:05:26.233 --> 01:05:27.070
trade them.
 

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.045
So my classmate,
Larry Summers,

01:05:30.045 --> 01:05:35.556
introduced TIPS,
Treasury Inflation Protected

01:05:35.556 --> 01:05:38.108
Securities,
and he, you know,

01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:41.074
announced this was a fantastic
idea and was going to change

01:05:41.074 --> 01:05:42.659
radically the whole markets.
 

01:05:42.659 --> 01:05:46.664
And then nobody traded them,
and they offered astronomical

01:05:46.664 --> 01:05:49.121
interest rates,
real interest rates,

01:05:49.121 --> 01:05:51.230
to get anyone to buy them.
 

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:55.648
And so they were
nicknamed--it's really bad on

01:05:55.648 --> 01:06:01.146
camera--but their nickname
became totally illiquid pieces

01:06:01.146 --> 01:06:02.030
of...
 

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:05.405
and so the market has not used
the TIPS to do most of its

01:06:05.405 --> 01:06:06.010
pricing.
 

01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.610
It uses the Treasury bonds,
but yes,

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:11.070
Fisher would say,
if the TIPS were a reliable

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:13.219
market,
you would use the TIPS to get

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.353
the real interest rate,
and that's really what you

01:06:15.353 --> 01:06:17.065
should care about,
is the real interest rate,

01:06:17.065 --> 01:06:18.409
not the nominal interest rate.
 

01:06:18.409 --> 01:06:21.474
But we're using the Treasuries
here to get the nominal interest

01:06:21.474 --> 01:06:21.820
rate.
 

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.980
However, you've now just dodged
my question.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:27.550
My question was,
if I asked you to predict,

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.320
on the basis of the yield curve
in this example,

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.659
and what we've been able to
deduce,

01:06:31.659 --> 01:06:34.423
what would you predict the
interest rate was going to turn

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.780
out to be 2 years from now,
the 1-year interest rate?

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:37.650
What would you predict?
 

01:06:37.650 --> 01:07:06.920
 
 

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.030
Yeah?
 

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:09.971
Student:
The market predicts

01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:10.719
&gt;
 

01:07:10.719 --> 01:07:12.440
Prof: Which forward rate?
 

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.730
Student:
Sorry, which years were you

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:14.590
&gt;?
 

01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:15.360
Prof: Year 2.
 

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.251
In year 2, what do you think
the interest rate will be

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:19.780
between year 2 and year 3?
 

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:20.309
Student:
Year 2

01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.989
&gt;
 

01:07:20.989 --> 01:07:22.831
Prof: It's today,
and we're asking,

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:26.012
what do you predict the market
rate of interest will be in year

01:07:26.012 --> 01:07:28.110
2,
between year 2 and year 3?

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:32.565
Student:
The forward rate,

01:07:32.565 --> 01:07:37.300
it would be 1
i_2^(f).

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.661
Prof: Okay,
and I_2^(f) happens

01:07:39.661 --> 01:07:41.170
to be right here,
5 percent.

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:43.449
Okay, so that's the forward.
 

01:07:43.449 --> 01:07:44.860
Student:
&gt;

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.420
Prof: So 5 percent you'd
predict.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.664
Student:
&gt;

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:50.909
position, but not the best
prediction.

01:07:50.909 --> 01:07:53.184
Prof: Okay,
so let me refine that a little

01:07:53.184 --> 01:07:53.469
bit.
 

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:56.420
If the world were one of total
certainty,

01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:00.057
so everybody trading today had
a perfect forecast of what was

01:08:00.057 --> 01:08:02.920
going to happen in the future,
then of course,

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.425
the forward rates in the market
today would have to be exactly

01:08:06.425 --> 01:08:08.610
equal to the forward interest
rate.

01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:12.295
Because suppose that you knew
for sure the interest rate was

01:08:12.295 --> 01:08:14.420
going to be 4 percent in year 2.
 

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.609
How could the market get to a 5
percent forward?

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:20.836
That means that some guy is
promising today,

01:08:20.836 --> 01:08:24.962
"You give me 1 dollar in
year 2 and I'll give you 1

01:08:24.962 --> 01:08:27.140
dollar 5 in year 3."
 

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.618
And we're agreeing to that deal.
 

01:08:28.618 --> 01:08:30.488
But that's a ludicrous thing
for him to do,

01:08:30.488 --> 01:08:36.590
because when he got to year 2,
he could simply--

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:38.890
if he knew for sure what was
going to happen in the future,

01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:42.658
and that the rate was going to
be 4 percent,

01:08:42.658 --> 01:08:46.239
he would just--I said it
backwards.

01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:46.850
What an idiot.
 

01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:49.560
Suppose he knew for sure the
rate was going to be 6 percent,

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:55.109
he would be--oh yeah,
if he knew for sure the rate

01:08:55.109 --> 01:09:01.078
was only going to be 4 percent,
he'd be a fool for promising to

01:09:01.078 --> 01:09:04.393
give the guy 5 percent today,
because in the future,

01:09:04.393 --> 01:09:06.779
when he got the dollar,
what would he do with it?

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:08.850
Put it in the bank and get 1
dollar 4 next year?

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:10.119
That wouldn't cover his promise.
 

01:09:10.119 --> 01:09:11.618
He'd be screwed, okay.
 

01:09:11.618 --> 01:09:15.367
So if he knows for sure that
the rate 2 years from now is

01:09:15.367 --> 01:09:18.645
going to be 4 percent,
the forward rate would also

01:09:18.645 --> 01:09:20.319
have to be 4 percent.
 

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.671
So to say it backwards,
if you assume everybody knows

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:24.890
for sure what's going to happen
in the future,

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:29.055
then the forward rates would be
exactly equal to what everyone

01:09:29.055 --> 01:09:31.720
is expecting to happen in the
future.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.306
To say it slightly differently,
if you happen to be the one

01:09:34.306 --> 01:09:36.760
ignoramus in the world who
didn't know what was going to

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.182
happen in the future,
but you knew that everybody

01:09:39.182 --> 01:09:41.850
else who was trading in the
market did know what was going

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:45.345
to happen in the future,
and you saw a forward rate of 5

01:09:45.345 --> 01:09:47.009
percent,
then you could deduce,

01:09:47.009 --> 01:09:48.578
even though you were an
ignoramus,

01:09:48.578 --> 01:09:51.524
that actually 2 years from now,
the interest rate was going to

01:09:51.524 --> 01:09:52.250
be 5 percent.
 

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:55.548
Okay, so just what you said,
but just said a little bit more

01:09:55.548 --> 01:09:56.220
precisely.
 

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.770
We're assuming here perfect
certainty about what's going--

01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:02.528
we're assuming the traders who
trade today all are completely

01:10:02.528 --> 01:10:04.920
convinced of what's going to
happen in the future.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:11.060
Okay, so let's go back to our
picture now.

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.250
The picture of the zero yield
curve.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:18.939
So what do you think this blue
curve means?

01:10:18.939 --> 01:10:21.578
What are the traders convinced
is going to happen in the

01:10:21.578 --> 01:10:22.010
future?
 

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:25.993
The second half of the course
is going to be dealing with

01:10:25.993 --> 01:10:26.988
uncertainty.
 

01:10:26.988 --> 01:10:28.777
We're now assuming,
like Irving Fisher,

01:10:28.777 --> 01:10:31.551
that everybody trading today
has no doubt about what's going

01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:32.868
to happen in the future.
 

01:10:32.868 --> 01:10:38.431
So what do you think these
traders think about these

01:10:38.431 --> 01:10:42.250
prices, about the interest
rates?

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:44.659
We're now in the world today,
this is September 30^(th),

01:10:44.659 --> 01:10:45.229
it's today.
 

01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:47.319
That's this curve.
 

01:10:47.319 --> 01:10:49.840
What does this curve mean?
 

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.765
Making the assumption that
traders today are convinced

01:10:51.765 --> 01:10:53.109
about what's going to happen
next,

01:10:53.109 --> 01:10:55.550
you know, in the future 10
years and 30 years,

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.859
what do we know that they are
convinced of?

01:10:57.859 --> 01:10:58.007
Yes?
 

01:10:58.007 --> 01:10:59.645
Student:
That interest rates are going

01:10:59.645 --> 01:11:00.390
to keep going up.
 

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:02.811
Prof: That interest
rates are going to go up and go

01:11:02.811 --> 01:11:03.279
up a lot.
 

01:11:03.279 --> 01:11:06.364
They're not just going to go up
to 4 percent,

01:11:06.364 --> 01:11:08.819
because that's the 30-year
yield.

01:11:08.819 --> 01:11:11.594
They're going to go up--the
forward rates are going up much

01:11:11.594 --> 01:11:13.841
faster than that,
so we could have computed what

01:11:13.841 --> 01:11:14.560
they think.
 

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.313
So they think rates are going
to go way up in the future,

01:11:17.313 --> 01:11:20.212
okay, much higher than that,
because you're starting so low,

01:11:20.212 --> 01:11:21.590
staying low for a while.
 

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:23.590
So the rates have to go up,
the forward rates,

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:25.680
really sharply to pull the
average that high.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.030
So people are convinced that
rates are going to go up in the

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.390
future.
 

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:29.590
That's what that tells you.
 

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:31.859
And why would they be convinced
of that?

01:11:31.859 --> 01:11:34.220
Well, for the two reasons that
you gave at the beginning.

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.322
One of you said,
"The market is going to

01:11:36.322 --> 01:11:37.658
get more productive."
 

01:11:37.658 --> 01:11:40.469
Irving Fisher has already told
us that when the market gets

01:11:40.469 --> 01:11:42.189
more productive,
you know, you're more

01:11:42.189 --> 01:11:44.020
optimistic about what's going to
happen later,

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.520
the real interest rate goes up.
 

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.421
And if inflation's constant,
and the real interest rate goes

01:11:48.421 --> 01:11:50.390
up, the nominal interest rate
goes up.

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:53.543
The other possibility is that
the real interest rate stays the

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:55.819
same, but there's inflation in
the future.

01:11:55.819 --> 01:11:57.970
The real interest rate the
inflation is the nominal

01:11:57.970 --> 01:11:58.658
interest rate.
 

01:11:58.658 --> 01:12:01.841
That's another explanation for
why people might expect the

01:12:01.841 --> 01:12:04.020
nominal interest rate to go up,
okay?

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:07.590
So you know that the market is
predicting rates going up,

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:09.863
and the two obvious
explanations according to Fisher

01:12:09.863 --> 01:12:12.448
is that either inflation is
going to go up or the real rate

01:12:12.448 --> 01:12:13.430
is going to go up.
 

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:14.689
And why might the real rate go
up?

01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:16.716
Well, there are a bunch of
reasons, but most likely because

01:12:16.716 --> 01:12:17.658
productivity is going up.
 

01:12:17.658 --> 01:12:23.192
Okay, so I've got one more
surprising conclusion to end

01:12:23.192 --> 01:12:23.908
this.
 

01:12:23.908 --> 01:12:33.516
So if you were certain about
the future and you took the

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:39.637
5-year coupon bond,
could you tell me what the

01:12:39.637 --> 01:12:44.810
price of the 5-year coupon bond
was going to be next year?

01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:46.828
How would you figure that out?
 

01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:50.438
Assume that everybody is
convinced that the 5 year coupon

01:12:50.438 --> 01:12:53.210
bond--that they know the future
for sure.

01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:55.435
So therefore,
from the zero curve--I erased

01:12:55.435 --> 01:12:57.448
my graph--this is the last
question.

01:12:57.448 --> 01:12:59.069
I'll let you go as soon as you
answer this.

01:12:59.069 --> 01:13:06.010
You need to answer this to do
the problem set.

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:07.329
Wrong graph, shit.
 

01:13:07.329 --> 01:13:08.238
Sorry.
 

01:13:08.238 --> 01:13:10.578
Okay, it'll only take 1 second
to answer this.

01:13:10.578 --> 01:13:14.679
Okay, I'm telling you now that
this is what everybody's looking

01:13:14.679 --> 01:13:17.390
at in the morning,
okay, these numbers.

01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:19.510
They're getting all the forward
rates and stuff like that.

01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:21.529
They're making all the
deductions that we made.

01:13:21.529 --> 01:13:23.814
Now if you suppose that those
people are convinced,

01:13:23.814 --> 01:13:26.556
they don't have any doubt about
what's going to happen in the

01:13:26.556 --> 01:13:27.060
future.
 

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:29.287
Because they don't have any
doubt about what's going to

01:13:29.287 --> 01:13:31.432
happen in the future,
you can infer from these prices

01:13:31.432 --> 01:13:32.960
what they think about the
future.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.712
So the question is,
can you infer what the price of

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:40.020
the 5-year Treasury,
which is now 100.5,

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:44.024
that 5-year bond is 100.5,
next year it will only be a

01:13:44.024 --> 01:13:44.828
4-year bond.
 

01:13:44.828 --> 01:13:48.329
Do we know what its price is
going to be next year?

01:13:48.329 --> 01:13:50.010
Yes.
 

01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:51.783
Student:
Yes, you can stick the cash

01:13:51.783 --> 01:13:53.176
flows in
&gt;

01:13:53.176 --> 01:13:54.949
year 2,3, 4 and 5,
and multiply them by the

01:13:54.949 --> 01:13:56.260
&gt;
 

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.069
Prof: By what pis?
 

01:13:58.069 --> 01:13:59.716
Student:
The big pi, the price of the

01:13:59.716 --> 01:14:00.750
&gt;
 

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:01.609
Prof: Those pis.
 

01:14:01.609 --> 01:14:04.520
Those pis or something slightly
different from those pis?

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.979
It's going to be a year later,
remember.

01:14:06.979 --> 01:14:10.997
Student:
Oh, by the equivalent of those

01:14:10.997 --> 01:14:12.069
in year 2.
 

01:14:12.069 --> 01:14:16.010
Prof: How would you get
that?

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:17.319
Yeah?
 

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:20.882
Student:
Discount by forward rates,

01:14:20.882 --> 01:14:24.359
so it's like
&gt;

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:27.747
4 and 5, forward rate in 3,4,
&gt;

01:14:27.747 --> 01:14:29.439
year forward,
add a discount

01:14:29.439 --> 01:14:31.260
&gt;
 

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:32.404
Each &gt;
 

01:14:32.404 --> 01:14:33.738
would have one less forward in
it.

01:14:33.738 --> 01:14:35.520
Prof: Okay,
so what you both said is

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.408
absolutely correct.
 

01:14:36.408 --> 01:14:39.182
Unfortunately,
we're 2 minutes--we're ending

01:14:39.182 --> 01:14:39.569
now.
 

01:14:39.569 --> 01:14:42.179
So let me just end by saying,
in the problem set,

01:14:42.179 --> 01:14:43.810
that's exactly the question.
 

01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:47.038
What is the 5-year coupon going
to be priced next year?

01:14:47.038 --> 01:14:49.692
If there's a world of
certainty, you're going to know

01:14:49.692 --> 01:14:52.140
what all the interest rates are
in the future.

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.220
And if you know what all the
interest rates are in the

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:56.458
future, obviously Fisher tells
you, you can figure out the

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:56.970
price is.
 

01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:59.364
However, to get the exact
formula would take a few minutes

01:14:59.364 --> 01:15:01.340
and I unfortunately am a few
minutes behind,

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:03.088
so you're going to have to
figure out what the right

01:15:03.088 --> 01:15:05.368
formula is,
but it's what he said and what

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:06.630
you were getting to.
 

01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:12.000

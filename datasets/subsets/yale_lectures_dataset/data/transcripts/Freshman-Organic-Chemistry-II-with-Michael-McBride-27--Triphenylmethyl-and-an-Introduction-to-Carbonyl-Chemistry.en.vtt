00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.667
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: Last time
about triphenylmethyl,

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:06.200
so I thought

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.700
you might like to see a
space-filling model of 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.700
triphenylmethyl, and feel it,
how it works. 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.967
Remember, it was very difficult
to find a way of 

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:22.233
making tetraphenylmethane, which
means you have to take 

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:25.000
this phenyl with its little hook
there 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.233
and get it into there. 

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:30.267
So I'll pass this around and you
can try twisting it and 

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:33.267
see if you can make
tetraphenylmethane better than 

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.500
the people before Gomberg did. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.633
And then there's a question of
whether you can make 

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.167
hexaphenylethane. 

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.467
So here are two
triphenylmethyls, one has the 

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:45.833
hook in it, and one doesn't. 

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:49.833
So the question is, can you put
those two together? 

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:54.700
So Debbie, you're the first. So
whoever gets it should 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.933
bring it up and show it to us. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.100
Now, the projector is warming up
here. 

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:11.167
So we're speaking about
triphenylmethyl and then I 

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:15.333
have a little second thought
about Friedel-Crafts reactions 

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.733
that I'll give to you. 

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.500
And then we're going to go on to
the next subject, which is 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.533
carbonyl compounds, once the
center projector 

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.800
gets warmed up here. 

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:40.467
So we talked last time about how
steric hindrance-- 

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.833
how you doing with your steric
hindrance there, Debbie?

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:43.667
STUDENT: Pretty poorly. 

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:45.200
PROFESSOR: Pretty poorly, OK. 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.367
It's really tough to get these
things together when you have 

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.967
these three propellers that all
have to twist because of 

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:53.167
the way they run into one
another. 

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:55.500
I still don't have my projector,
I don't know how it 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.267
got turned off. 

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:58.400
I guess I did it somehow. 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.767
So it makes-- as Debbie's
finding out-- 

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:04.667
[LAUGHTER] 

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.333
PROFESSOR: It makes
tetraphenylethane-- 

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.833
did you try hexaphenylethane? 

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.267
STUDENT: That's even worse. 

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:11.067
PROFESSOR: It's even worse? 

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:12.467
OK. 

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.400
So let us see. 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.000
It looks like it's on up there.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.733
How are you guys doing? 

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:27.767
Helen, Antonia? 

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:29.033
Can you get them together? 

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:35.100
Maybe you could get a picture of
them trying to-- 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.967
hold it up so they can get a
picture there, just turn it 

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:38.967
between you. 

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:40.667
But work on it as you're doing
it. 

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.967
Don't hold your hand in the way
the camera. 

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:54.400
Yes? 

00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.000
Quiet a minute, yes? 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.900
STUDENT: Shouldn't the
structures of the models be 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.300
able to be bent a little? 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.967
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's true. 

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:07.967
It's true that the models have
fixed angles and don't distort 

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:08.967
easily, these models. 

00:03:08.967 --> 00:03:11.867
If you made it with Fisher's
models, the ones that had 

00:03:11.867 --> 00:03:14.967
rubber tubing, you'd have no
problem making it, because 

00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:16.700
they're not space-filling
either. 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.967
And there's the question of how
big the atoms are, they're 

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:20.267
a little bit crushable, right. 

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:23.667
These models, obviously, are
more or less rigid. 

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:28.467
And in fact, you can make
tetraphenylmethane, but as 

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:31.867
we'll see shortly, once we get a
projector going for us, you 

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:33.133
can't make hexaphenylethane. 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.367
Any luck? 

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.967
I don't know why this is taking
so long. 

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:53.300
I turned off the side one, and
somehow the center 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.567
one went off too. 

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:10.933
I going to turn on one of the
other projectors, just in case 

00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:13.067
this one doesn't come on. 

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:15.367
In fact, I'll turn them all on.

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:17.333
We'll see where we get any luck.

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:30.033
Ah, there we go. 

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:31.667
OK. 

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:33.633
So here you see what we were
just saying. 

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:36.767
Steric hindrance in
triphenylmethyl causes twists 

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:41.233
that reduce overlap by 25% from
what they would be in 

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:43.433
diphenylmethyl, and makes
tetraphenyl[correction: methane]

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:44.300
very difficult to 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.867
prepare, not to mention
hexaphenylethane. 

00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:53.300
So, but Gomberg was able to make
tetraphenylmethane using this 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.833
trick that he'd learned in
Munich of knocking nitrogen 

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.500
out and having the two radicals
come together. 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.133
And he tried, as we mentioned
last time, to prove that 

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:01.933
that's what he had. 

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:03.967
The analysis was correct. 

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:06.367
And he was good at analysis,
remember. 

00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:10.600
And he got the right molecular
weight, almost. So then he 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.267
went back. He spent just one
year in Germany. 

00:05:13.267 --> 00:05:17.800
Not like Friedel who spent four
years first, and then 17 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.633
years in Paris. 

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:23.500
Then he went back to Ann Arbor
and got back to work, stayed 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.300
there the rest of his life. 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.467
And he confirmed the molecular
weight by doing an even better 

00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:32.633
measurement, he got 318 versus
320. 

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:34.367
So he was really confident that
he had 

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:35.500
tetraphenylmethane. 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.733
But there was one thing that was
funny. 

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:43.067
He nitrated it, did
electrophilic aromatic 

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:45.233
substitution on the four
phenyls, 

00:05:45.233 --> 00:05:51.033
got the tetranitro compound and
he got it at 99.5% yield. 

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:53.000
But there was a problem. He
wrote. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.500
"Unlike trinitro
triphenlmethane... it does not

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500
dissolve in sodium ethylate,"

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.267
that's ethoxide anion strong
base, 

00:06:02.267 --> 00:06:05.133
"nor does it give any
coloration..."

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:08.867
So these nitro compounds with a
lot of phenyls seemed to 

00:06:08.867 --> 00:06:13.200
dissolve in strong base and to
give colors, 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200
but his compound didn't. 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.933
Now why does this dissolve in
strong base? 

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:21.167
Any ideas? 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.100
What does base do with it,
strong base? 

00:06:32.067 --> 00:06:32.600
Wojtek? 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.867
STUDENT: It takes off the H
plus. 

00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:36.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it takes off H
plus. 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.900
This is a very good anion. 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.567
It's triply benzylic, plus it
has the electron-withdrawing 

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:45.667
nitro group, so it's easy to
pull off the proton and get 

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:49.067
the anion, which then dissolves
and is colored. 

00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:54.567
It has an unusually high HOMO
and a low LUMO nearby, so the 

00:06:54.567 --> 00:06:57.100
electrons can move, absorbing
light that's 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.267
in the colored region. 

00:06:58.267 --> 00:06:59.833
OK, so it's possible to get
that. 

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:03.200
Of course, he didn't know this
theory that we know. 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.800
So for him, it's was just funny
that it didn't dissolve 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.767
in base the way other
nitrophenyl compounds did. 

00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:15.767
But he wondered, how about
hexaphenylethane? 

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:18.767
If you nitrate it, will it be
colored? 

00:07:18.767 --> 00:07:22.400
Will it dissolve in base? 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.067
So he set about trying to make
hexaphenylethane. 

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:28.000
Now how did he try? 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.967
He tried using the techniques
that failed to make 

00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:31.033
tetraphenylmethane. 

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:35.333
It's very much like Wurtz
coupling, right? 

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:38.067
You put a metal in, pull out two
chlorides, the things come 

00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:41.067
together is the idea. 

00:07:41.067 --> 00:07:43.100
Here, it's plausible because
it's easy to pull that 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.400
chloride off, as we'll see
later. 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.100
So in fact he did get-- he
thought-- hexaphenylethane. 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.100
So he did analyses. 

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.667
So he got the total of carbon
plus hydrogen-- that is CO2 

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.567
and water that he burned it and
got-- was 

00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:05.267
93.97 by one method. 

00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:07.300
This is a method, not a run. 

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.600
He did many, many analyses using
the same method. 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.167
Their average was 93.97. 

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:15.733
He tried another method: 94.20,

00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:17.267
94.00, 

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:18.700
94.57. 

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.567
Four different methods, maybe 20
analyses he did. 

00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:26.800
But he could never get it near
100%. 

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.267
And he was confident of his
ability as an analytical 

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:33.333
chemist. Remember all that time
he spent in lab. 

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:37.033
Ultimately he used more than 17
different methods to 

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:41.767
analyze it, and none of them
would give 100%. 

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:44.633
So he concluded that there's
something else there besides 

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:46.867
carbon and hydrogen. 

00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:49.933
And that something else is
oxygen. 

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:51.767
Because if you have two oxygens
between the 

00:08:51.767 --> 00:09:02.267
triphenylmethyl groups, then the
sum of C and H is 

00:09:02.267 --> 00:09:06.933
93.82%, which is what he got
within a few parts per thousand.

00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:11.367
So there must be O2 in
between. So he

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:13.633
prepared the authentic peroxide.
You can easily do an

00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:17.867
SN2[correction: SN1] reaction,
because the chloride 

00:09:17.867 --> 00:09:21.700
will come away to give the
triphenylmethyl cation, 

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.933
and then O2 minus 2 will go
between. So you can get 

00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:28.333
the authentic peroxide, 

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.500
And it was the same compound. 

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.733
So then he knew how to prepare
the hydrocarbon. You do it by 

00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:35.800
preparing it without oxygen
present. 

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.900
It reacts easily with oxygen. 

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.133
So he used a special apparatus
he said,

00:09:40.133 --> 00:09:41.733
"with ground glass joints."

00:09:41.733 --> 00:09:45.467
Then they used corks and
sometimes rubber stoppers, but

00:09:45.467 --> 00:09:48.033
never or rarely, ground
glass joint.

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:49.533
That was really high tech. 

00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:51.533
But he did it, and he got the
compound 

00:09:51.533 --> 00:09:54.300
that analyzed correctly. 

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.467
But he found it was very funny
because this substance not 

00:09:58.467 --> 00:10:03.667
only reacted with O2, it reacted
easily with Cl2, with 

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:07.567
Br2, and even with I2, which you
remember 

00:10:07.567 --> 00:10:09.100
doesn't add to alkenes. 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.867
So this is a weird, unsaturated
compound. 

00:10:12.867 --> 00:10:17.433
So unsaturated it reacts
spontaneously even with I2. 

00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:20.167
And certainly hexaphenylethane
shouldn't do that, 

00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:22.600
Tetraphenylmethane didn't do
anything like that. 

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.433
So this is from his paper in
1900, just at 

00:10:27.433 --> 00:10:29.367
the turn of the century. 

00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:32.767
He said, "Triphenylmethyl... The
experimental evidence 

00:10:32.767 --> 00:10:36.233
presented above forces me to the
conclusion that we have to 

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:38.367
deal, here, with a free
radical..." 

00:10:38.367 --> 00:10:40.633
Remember where radicals came
from? 

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:44.900
Remember, it was the
nomenclature in the 1830s, the 

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.867
organic radical? 

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:49.633
At first they thought they were
real things, Kolbe 

00:10:49.633 --> 00:10:52.367
thought he had made methyl, but
in fact he had made the 

00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:54.700
dimer ethane. 

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.533
And then from then on, radical
was just a name. 

00:10:57.533 --> 00:10:59.167
It wasn't something that was
real, it 

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:01.633
wasn't the organic element. 

00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:05.400
Here, he tried to make the dimer
hexaphenylethane but 

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.333
concluded that he had the
monomer, 

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.100
triphenylmethyl free radicals. 

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.167
Not just names. 

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:15.033
"On this assumption alone do the
results described above 

00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:17.500
become intelligible and receive
an adequate 

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.733
explanation. 

00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:21.800
The action of zinc results, as
it seems to me, in the mere 

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.633
abstraction of the halogen
leaving the free radical. 

00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:28.767
The radical so formed is
apparently stable, for it can 

00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:32.067
be kept both in solution and in
the dry crystalline state 

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:33.300
for weeks."

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.700
So he had prepared a free
radical. 

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.833
Now of course, when you do a
reaction, you either have to 

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:45.500
go association/dissociation or
dissociation and then 

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.567
association. 

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:49.467
And when you dissociate from
carbon, you get something 

00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:51.033
that's trivalent. 

00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:55.300
And this was the first example
of an authentic trivalent 

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.800
carbon compound. 

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:04.433
So this is the watershed between
the 19th century, when 

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:07.600
it was just making compounds and
things being mysterious, 

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.300
and the 20th century when you
could begin to understand 

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.333
mechanisms in terms of actually
knowing something 

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.567
about these trivalent carbon
compounds. 

00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:18.767
And this was the first. 

00:12:18.767 --> 00:12:22.433
So this launched the American
century of chemistry, because 

00:12:22.433 --> 00:12:26.933
this experiment was done in
America, in Ann Arbor. 

00:12:26.933 --> 00:12:30.700
And here in October 1900, he
wrote a paper, 

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.533
published it in America,
received October 4th. 

00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:37.333
"An Instance of Trivalent
Carbon: Triphenylmethyl." But 

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:39.667
at the same time, he published
it in Germany. 

00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:43.167
A preliminary paper,
"Triphenylmethyl: a Case of 

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:46.767
Trivalent Carbon," received the
1st of October, 1900. 

00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:50.133
So he published it both places
to cover his bases. 

00:12:50.133 --> 00:12:54.933
Now you remember, we talked
about American organic 

00:12:54.933 --> 00:12:58.100
chemistry and about James Mason
Crafts and that 

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.133
essentially everything he did,
he did in Paris. 

00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:05.000
And many people thought he was
French He did essentially 

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.867
nothing in the U.S. There were
people doing more than that, 

00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:12.133
but not a lot more than that. 

00:13:12.133 --> 00:13:15.000
All the center of gravity was in
Europe, especially in 

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.267
Germany, at the end of the 19th
century. 

00:13:19.267 --> 00:13:24.700
But Gomberg comes along, born 25
years later. 

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.467
Oh, I should have said that
there's an 

00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:28.767
exception, which is Yale. 

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:33.167
Because Gibbs really made at
complete international splash 

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:36.133
with his "Equilibrium of
Heterogeneous Substances," 

00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:38.800
which was published the same
period as the 

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.400
Friedel Crafts reaction. 

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.467
But that was in France and this
was in America. 

00:13:43.467 --> 00:13:46.633
So in physical chemistry,
America had done something, 

00:13:46.633 --> 00:13:47.800
and it was Gibbs. 

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.400
But in organic chemistry,
Gomberg was the first one to 

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.233
really do something. 

00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:53.233
And these are Gomberg's
publications. 

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.833
And contrast that with the
previous one. 

00:13:55.833 --> 00:14:00.967
So here, he went for just one
year to Munich and Heidelberg, 

00:14:00.967 --> 00:14:03.600
where he did this work and
prepared this compound, the 

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.133
tetraphenylmethane, which was
itself notable. 

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:11.467
But much more drastic was the
preparation of the radical 

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:14.967
triphenylmethyl, which he did,
obviously, after he got back 

00:14:14.967 --> 00:14:15.967
to America. 

00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:18.633
So he published these things in
German, because that's where 

00:14:18.633 --> 00:14:20.433
the big readership was. 

00:14:20.433 --> 00:14:23.933
But within 10 years or so, he
was doing all his publishing 

00:14:23.933 --> 00:14:26.467
in the United States, and a lot
of publishing. 

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:30.833
So in that 25 year period
between Friedel and Gomberg, 

00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:34.300
things started really happening
in this country. 

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.333
And then after the Second World
War, of course, Europe 

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:40.467
had such difficulty that things
really took off here, 

00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:44.700
and it was a long time for them
to catch up again. 

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.567
So this launched the American
chemical century. 

00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:52.400
And incidentally, one other
thing about it, is the big 

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.200
German journal for organic
chemistry was Berichte der 

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.167
Deutschen Chemischen
Gesellschaft. 

00:14:57.167 --> 00:15:03.267
"The Reports of the German
Chemical Society." And in 1900 

00:15:03.267 --> 00:15:06.900
there were 4,290 pages, and I
leafed through them to see how 

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.800
many graphs there were, how many
quantitative things were 

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.867
being discussed. 

00:15:10.867 --> 00:15:13.767
This was mainly a journal of
organic chemistry and there 

00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:15.500
were very, very few graphs. 

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.300
In fact, in two of the papers
from this period here, 

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:26.667
Gomberg's papers had more graphs
than all those things 

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:30.367
in all of 1900 in the German
main literature. 

00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:33.600
So it showed not only were
things coming to America, but 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.433
physical-organic chemistry, the
quantitative approach to 

00:15:36.433 --> 00:15:39.967
organic chemistry was rising as
well. 

00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:43.633
Now I said I had second thoughts
on the Friedel-Crafts 

00:15:43.633 --> 00:15:45.367
reaction, of what I told you
last time. 

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:46.600
So I'm going to take just a
minute to 

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.967
tell you about those. 

00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:49.967
So we talked about rearrangement
happening in 

00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:57.700
Friedel-Crafts alkylation and
the idea that you can get 

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.333
a chloride being complexed with
triphenylmethyl chloride, 

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:03.167
which makes it a good leaving
group. 

00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:07.700
Which means that the phenyl can
come in and displace that, 

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.033
it's essentially an
SN1[correction: SN2] reaction. 

00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:12.633
Here's the substrate with its
good leaving group, and the 

00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:15.900
high HOMO here comes in
displaces, and then you lose a 

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.067
hydrogen from the same place and
get the product. 

00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:22.767
You get the normal propyl
product, the first one there. 

00:16:22.767 --> 00:16:26.867
But if it dissociates a little
bit and rearranges with a 

00:16:26.867 --> 00:16:31.367
hydride shift, then you get the
other product. 

00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:33.500
This is what we talked about. 

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.900
So we said that this is what
gives the primary product, 

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.333
it's essentially an
SN1[correction: SN2] reaction. 

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.933
But this SN2[correction: SN1]
reaction after rearrangment,

00:16:42.933 --> 00:16:43.433
when you get the 

00:16:43.433 --> 00:16:47.600
more stable secondary cation,
then it can dissociate and 

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.200
then you get the so-called
cumene, isopropylbenzene. 

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.533
Now that may be true, but it may
be wrong, too. 

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:58.933
I got thinking about this. 

00:16:58.933 --> 00:17:02.667
OK, so suppose it rotated so
that 

00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:05.067
methyl was on the backside. 

00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:06.700
Then what might you expect to
happen? 

00:17:09.867 --> 00:17:13.500
What happened over here to get
the secondary cation?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:13.933
STUDENT: Hydride shift.

00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:16.233
PROFESSOR: It was a hydride
shift, right? 

00:17:16.233 --> 00:17:17.967
What might you get now?

00:17:17.967 --> 00:17:18.400
STUDENT: Methide shift.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.867
PROFESSOR: A methide shift. 

00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:22.800
And methides and hydrides
rearrange at 

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.533
about the same rate. 

00:17:25.533 --> 00:17:30.200
So why not do this, why not do
methide shifts? 

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.300
So what do you get if you do a
methide shift? 

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.100
You get that. 

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.867
But it's the same thing you had
before, it's a degenerate 

00:17:39.867 --> 00:17:40.700
rearrangment. 

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.400
It's still the primary compound
and then you could do 

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.867
the SN1 and get the product, so
it doesn't make any 

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:48.767
difference that you do a methide
shift. 

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:53.733
But suppose the methide shift
gets stuck halfway across. 

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.467
Suppose it stops there. 

00:17:59.467 --> 00:18:04.000
Because another way to draw that
is as protonated 

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.100
cyclopropane. 

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.133
It's cyclopropane that's taken
on an extra proton. 

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:13.100
And that substance has been
studied. 

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.867
And it's known that its
stability is between the 

00:18:15.867 --> 00:18:20.433
primary cation and the secondary
cation. 

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:24.967
So suppose you got that, what
would that do? 

00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:27.567
Well, you could have the
nucleophile attack that, I 

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:31.533
mean the methyl plus is a great
leaving group. 

00:18:31.533 --> 00:18:33.700
So you could do that and again,
it would still give 

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.867
that same product if you had the
protonated cyclopropane 

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:41.900
instead of this thing doing the
alkylation. 

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:47.000
Now in fact, Norman Deno at Penn
State University in 1968, 

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
unbeknownst to me, had actually
done that reaction. 

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.400
He took benzene and cyclopropane
and reacted it 

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.333
with acid, and got these
products. 

00:18:59.967 --> 00:19:03.167
And he used deuterium here. 

00:19:03.167 --> 00:19:06.767
So there's deuterium in this
normal 

00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:10.600
propylbenzene, just one
deuterium. 

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.933
Now what I want you to tell me
is where you expect it to be. 

00:19:15.933 --> 00:19:19.800
On which carbon should that
deuterium be? which of the 

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.033
three carbons? 

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:28.433
Let's suppose that it happens by
making protonated 

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:29.833
cyclopropane. 

00:19:29.833 --> 00:19:30.600
Chris, what do you think? 

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.100
STUDENT: The terminal one? 

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.533
PROFESSOR: It should be the
terminal one, because if you 

00:19:33.533 --> 00:19:35.700
put it on here then you
displace-- 

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.033
that'll be the methyl group and
the deuterium should be 

00:19:38.033 --> 00:19:40.667
there, one deuterium. 

00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:42.133
Here's what he found. 

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:44.767
Where is it? 

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:50.100
3/7 of it is where Chris said,
2/7 here and 2/7 here. 

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.933
It's completely scrambled,
right? 

00:19:51.933 --> 00:19:55.367
There are three hydrogens here,
two here, and two here. 

00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:58.067
And that one deuterium is
completely scrambled among 

00:19:58.067 --> 00:19:59.933
those positions. 

00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:01.667
How did it get scrambled? 

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:07.067
Well, this corner protonated
cyclopropane very easily 

00:20:07.067 --> 00:20:10.800
rearranges to edge protonated
cyclopropane. 

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.900
And then that can become
protonated at this corner, and 

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.167
then this edge, and then this
corner, and then this edge, 

00:20:16.167 --> 00:20:17.933
and then back to where you
started. 

00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:20.633
And when it's that CH3 it
doesn't have to be the 

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.600
deuterium you added that moves,
it could 

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.900
have been the hydrogen. 

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.167
So everything gets scrambled
very quickly 

00:20:26.167 --> 00:20:26.933
going around there. 

00:20:26.933 --> 00:20:32.300
And in fact, this was shown in a
key experiment by a man 

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.200
named Richard Baird, who was an
assistant professor here in 

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.433
this department in 1964. 

00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:40.133
And it was on the basis of that
that Deno tried this 

00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:41.400
experiment. 

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.500
So protonated cyclopropane does
give this compound. 

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.200
So now we have a question, which
of these is the thing 

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.933
that gives the Friedel Crafts
product? 

00:20:53.933 --> 00:21:00.233
Is it an SN2 reaction with this,
or an SN1 reaction that 

00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:02.833
involves the protonated
cyclopropane? 

00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:05.000
And it could be either. 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.967
And no one knows, as far as I am
aware. 

00:21:10.933 --> 00:21:13.633
I've just been going through the
literature in the last two 

00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:14.367
days on this. 

00:21:14.367 --> 00:21:16.300
I don't think anybody knows
this. 

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.400
I tried to call Professor Olah,
and wasn't able to get him,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.967
at University of Southern

00:21:20.967 --> 00:21:23.633
California, who got the Nobel
Prize for Friedel Crafts 

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:25.267
things, and I haven't been able
to get him yet. 

00:21:25.267 --> 00:21:28.000
But Professor Saunders, who
knows a lot about this, 

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.033
doesn't think he knows. 

00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:31.100
We'll see. 

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.200
But anyhow, I think it's not
known. 

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.233
So what I want you guys to do is
to try to think up an 

00:21:37.233 --> 00:21:44.067
experiment that can tell you
whether it's the SN2 or the 

00:21:44.067 --> 00:21:45.300
SN1 mechanism. 

00:21:48.567 --> 00:21:51.100
And I'll give you a hint, I
think the good experiments 

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.200
involve isotopes. 

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.400
So here's a problem for you. 

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.833
So maybe you can become famous
and determine the mechanism of 

00:21:58.833 --> 00:22:05.833
the Friedel Crafts reaction
after 143 years. 

00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:09.467
OK, now onto the next subject,
which is carbonyl compounds. 

00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:18.167
I didn't bring the Jones
textbook along, but carbonyl 

00:22:18.167 --> 00:22:20.667
compounds are discussed in
Chapter 16 to 19, 

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:22.467
which is 268 pages. 

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:24.600
It's about a quarter of the text
book, I think, and that's 

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.533
not atypical. 

00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:27.900
You have many other texts and
you can check, but there's a 

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.600
lot of stuff in there about
carbonyl compounds. 

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.567
The good news is that almost all
of it is review, because 

00:22:34.567 --> 00:22:35.767
we've talked a lot about the 

00:22:35.767 --> 00:22:38.300
reactivity of carbonyl
compounds. 

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.533
So Chapter 16, for example, is
aldehydes and ketones. 

00:22:42.533 --> 00:22:44.967
So for the rest of this lecture,
I'm just going to go 

00:22:44.967 --> 00:22:47.967
over the big view of this, and
then in the next lectures 

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:52.333
we'll take a more detailed view
of some of the lore. 

00:22:52.333 --> 00:22:55.633
So we talked about before that
the carbonyl compound is 

00:22:55.633 --> 00:22:57.667
stable, but it's reactive. 

00:22:57.667 --> 00:23:01.867
Those things we've said before
seem contradictory. 

00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:04.733
You have the average bond
energies we've looked at 

00:23:04.733 --> 00:23:07.433
before for the single and double
bond, and for the 

00:23:07.433 --> 00:23:09.633
single and double bonds to
oxygen. 

00:23:09.633 --> 00:23:13.167
And we've seen that the second
bond in carbon is very much 

00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:14.967
weaker than the first bond. 

00:23:14.967 --> 00:23:18.767
But the second bond for oxygen
is stronger 

00:23:18.767 --> 00:23:21.800
than the first bond. 

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:27.433
And it's not all due to the pi
bond, because it has also to 

00:23:27.433 --> 00:23:29.967
do with a change and
hybridization of the carbon, 

00:23:29.967 --> 00:23:32.700
the sigma bond changes when you
form a double bond. 

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.000
So it's very stable compared to
carbon-carbon double bonds. 

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.600
But it's also reactive because
it has a very 

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.700
low LUMO the pi*. 

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:51.200
Now just to give you something
to practice with about NMR, to 

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.300
see how people figured out
chemical shifts in NMR. They 

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.800
did it by taking a compound, a
known compound like acetaldehyde

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.000
where n is 3 here, you'll see
why I used n. 

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.133
And they found it had two peaks,
199.6 and 31.2 in the 

00:24:08.133 --> 00:24:11.033
CMR spectrum, carbon magnetic
resonance. 

00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:14.033
And then they put another carbon
on and found peaks at 

00:24:14.033 --> 00:24:17.133
those positions, and then
another one on and found peaks 

00:24:17.133 --> 00:24:18.700
at those positions. 

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.700
And then they did a ketone,
acetone, and found peaks at 

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.067
those positions. 

00:24:24.067 --> 00:24:27.700
And with one more carbon,
2-butanone, they found that. 

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.967
And with 2-pentanone they found
that, and with 

00:24:30.967 --> 00:24:33.933
3-pentanone they found that. 

00:24:33.933 --> 00:24:38.333
Now with that empirical evidence
behind you, I want 

00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:44.400
you to figure out what this CMR
spectrum is of and which 

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.700
peaks are which. 

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.933
And that's taken from that Chem
220 problem site that 

00:24:49.933 --> 00:24:52.567
we've mentioned before. 

00:24:52.567 --> 00:24:56.667
So there are the values of the
chemical shifts in this proton 

00:24:56.667 --> 00:25:01.033
decoupled CMR spectrum, and use
the table to identify what 

00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:03.000
each of those carbons is. 

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.867
And in the process, you'll
figure out what regularities 

00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:09.767
there are within this table, and
how you go about figuring 

00:25:09.767 --> 00:25:11.533
out new things. 

00:25:11.533 --> 00:25:15.467
And just to give you an extra
hint, here's the proton 

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:18.633
magnetic resonance spectrum of
the same compound. 

00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:21.433
Notice this is 400 MHz for
protons. 

00:25:21.433 --> 00:25:23.933
It was a 100 MHz for carbon. 

00:25:23.933 --> 00:25:27.700
That's the same magnet, because
the proton is four 

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.767
times as strong as carbon. 

00:25:30.767 --> 00:25:33.867
And just to help you out with
this, we can blow up each of 

00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:36.867
those peaks and see what the
spin-spin splitting is. 

00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:39.267
And there they are with the
values of their chemical 

00:25:39.267 --> 00:25:44.700
shifts and here's the scale for
the detail, that's 20 Hz. 

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.533
So this splitting here is 1.8 Hz
and the one over here is 

00:25:48.533 --> 00:25:51.167
6.8 Hz, just for reference. 

00:25:51.167 --> 00:25:54.400
So there are two problems for
you. 

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:59.100
Make your name by devising an
experiment to prove the 

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.733
mechanism of the Friedel Crafts
reaction, and figure 

00:26:02.733 --> 00:26:06.233
out what this compound is. 

00:26:06.233 --> 00:26:10.200
Ok now, So carbonyl is very
stable, but it's also, 

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.133
paradoxically, reactive. 

00:26:12.133 --> 00:26:15.267
And we know that's because of
pi*. 

00:26:15.267 --> 00:26:16.867
We'll see other ways as well. 

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:19.233
So the nucleophile comes in,
we've done this is a zillion 

00:26:19.233 --> 00:26:22.000
times, and we have nucleophilic
addition. 

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.667
And last semester, we talked
about the Buergi-Dunitz angle, 

00:26:24.667 --> 00:26:27.500
and all this is discussed in
Chapter 16. 

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.100
And you remember, this contrasts
with C=C, where the addition 

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.867
reactions are electrophilic, not
nucleophilic. 

00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:40.667
So then you bring a proton on
and you get an alcohol. 

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:43.200
And especially interesting
alcohols, that will be 

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.300
discussed in Chapter 16, are
ones where you form a new bond 

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.300
to R, where the nucleophile is
an alkyl group. 

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.800
For example, methyllithium has
that property, and we talked 

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.567
about that some last semester. 

00:26:57.567 --> 00:27:00.867
Or where the nucleophile is H
minus, as in 

00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:02.400
lithium aluminum hydride. 

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.600
So here are some sections that
talk about that. 

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.533
And again, we'll talk more about
this. 

00:27:07.533 --> 00:27:11.167
Now, a different kind of
reactivity is when one of the 

00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:15.533
substituents on the carbonyl can
be a leaving group in an 

00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:20.000
SN2 reaction, so it's an OK
anion. 

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.300
Because when you do that,
there's something else you can 

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.467
do at this stage. 

00:27:23.467 --> 00:27:25.933
Of course, you can reverse it,
you can bring these electrons 

00:27:25.933 --> 00:27:27.700
in to reform the double bond and
lose the 

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.500
nucleophile and go back. 

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.833
But as in SN2 reactions, you can
also lose the leaving 

00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:36.433
group if it's a reasonable
anion. 

00:27:36.433 --> 00:27:38.867
So you can go like this, and now
what you've 

00:27:38.867 --> 00:27:40.333
done is not an addition. 

00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:44.367
What kind of reaction is this,
instead of an addition? 

00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:45.067
What's overall? 

00:27:45.067 --> 00:27:46.300
Linda? 

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.600
STUDENT: Substitution. 

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.900
PROFESSOR: It's a substitution
instead of an addition. 

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.033
So nucleophilic substitution of
things that are called acid 

00:27:55.033 --> 00:27:56.267
derivatives-- 

00:27:56.267 --> 00:27:59.167
these things when L is a leaving
group, when that thing 

00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:01.433
is a leaving group are called
acid derivatives. 

00:28:01.433 --> 00:28:04.200
So it's
association/dissociation. 

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:10.667
It's not like SN2 where you go
through a pentavalent 

00:28:10.667 --> 00:28:12.500
transition state. 

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.700
This has an actual intermediate,
this has a 

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.067
finite lifetime. 

00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:20.133
So it's association and then
dissocation, as in aromatic 

00:28:20.133 --> 00:28:20.867
substitution. 

00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:23.400
Remember, electrophilic aromatic
substitution goes 

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.533
through a tetravalent carbon,
then the proton gets lost and 

00:28:26.533 --> 00:28:29.100
you have the electrophile left
on there. 

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.667
And that's what's discussed in
Chapter 18. 

00:28:31.667 --> 00:28:34.467
But there are other ways to go
at it too, because the oxygen 

00:28:34.467 --> 00:28:37.900
has unshared pairs, so acids can
attack it. 

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.267
So you have an acid come in, for
example a proton to 

00:28:41.267 --> 00:28:45.600
protonate it and get that
cation, and then you can have 

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.733
electrophilic addition. 

00:28:48.733 --> 00:28:51.800
So a nucleophile then can come
in on a second step. 

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.767
In the previous slide, we had
the nucleophile come in first 

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:58.000
and then brought a proton in
later. 

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.900
Now we're bringing the proton in
first on the oxygen and 

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.767
bringing a nucleophile in later.

00:29:02.767 --> 00:29:06.833
So we get compounds that have OH
and a nucleophile on there. 

00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:08.833
Now what nucleophiles can you
use? 

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:15.967
Notice that this is much easier
than for C=C. So the 

00:29:15.967 --> 00:29:19.200
nucleophile can be OH, in which
case this thing over 

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.367
here is called a hydrate. 

00:29:21.367 --> 00:29:25.633
It's H20 added to the carbonyl.

00:29:25.633 --> 00:29:28.067
Or it's sometimes called a gem
diol-- 

00:29:28.067 --> 00:29:29.867
gem for geminal. 

00:29:29.867 --> 00:29:34.433
Gemini is twins, right, so it's
twin OHs on there. 

00:29:34.433 --> 00:29:36.933
Or it can be OR, and we've
already talked about that, 

00:29:36.933 --> 00:29:40.300
hemiacetal, or on the way to an
acetal. 

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.333
Or it could be a nitrogen, and
then the equivalent of a 

00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:47.967
hemiacetal for nitrogen is
called a carbinolamine. 

00:29:47.967 --> 00:29:50.533
And you can unzip this, of
course, and 

00:29:50.533 --> 00:29:51.867
go back to the carbonyl. 

00:29:51.867 --> 00:29:54.800
But if you have two groups on
there, you could unzip, losing 

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.867
the other group and keeping the
nucleophile. 

00:29:56.867 --> 00:29:59.167
And then you have a nucleophile
double bond. 

00:29:59.167 --> 00:30:03.267
That's what the imine is, a
carbon-nitrogen double bond. 

00:30:03.267 --> 00:30:08.133
Or you can have a bisulfite
addition product, or CN. 

00:30:08.133 --> 00:30:10.967
That one's special, because you
form a new 

00:30:10.967 --> 00:30:12.233
carbon-carbon bond. 

00:30:12.233 --> 00:30:14.733
You're always on the lookout for
things that will form new 

00:30:14.733 --> 00:30:19.000
carbon-carbon bonds, not just
change the functional group. 

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
So that's called a cyanohydrin.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.267
So there are sections 16.6 to
16.11 about that in the 

00:30:26.267 --> 00:30:30.433
Jones book, but all these things
will be covered in all 

00:30:30.433 --> 00:30:31.667
these textbooks. 

00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:38.400
ow the reason this was stable,
one reason it was easy to 

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.967
protonate that was you have this
resonance structure. 

00:30:40.967 --> 00:30:43.600
But notice that if you have a
proton here, on the carbon 

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.400
adjacent to the carbonyl-- 

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.100
that's the alpha position. 

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.700
So if you have an alpha proton,
then a nucleophile can 

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.700
act as a base. 

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.467
So a base can come in and take
the proton. 

00:30:56.467 --> 00:31:01.200
So instead of attacking here, it
can attack here and 

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.767
generate this double bond. 

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:05.267
And you remember what those
things are called? 

00:31:05.267 --> 00:31:06.533
Enols. 

00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:11.800
So that this is an allylic
rearrangement, the fourth 

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.133
pattern of reactivity is allylic

00:31:14.133 --> 00:31:16.167
rearrangement, ketone to enol. 

00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:18.433
As I've been going along, I've
been numbering all the 

00:31:18.433 --> 00:31:22.333
different ways carbonyls react.

00:31:22.333 --> 00:31:27.267
So now you could a bring a low
LUMO in here and have the 

00:31:27.267 --> 00:31:29.133
electrons of the double bond
attack it. 

00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:31.233
So this is a double bond. 

00:31:31.233 --> 00:31:34.900
So this is like electrophilic
addition to a double bond, 

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.567
except especially good because
you have the unshared pair on 

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:41.967
the oxygen that can help out and
make this easy to do that. 

00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:46.333
So it's better than other
carbon-carbon double bonds. 

00:31:46.333 --> 00:31:50.367
So the enol is essentially a
carbon nucleophile. 

00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:54.100
It can attack low LUMOs
especially easy. 

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.067
So you get something like this.

00:31:56.067 --> 00:32:00.133
And notice that after you lost
the proton then, what you have--

00:32:00.133 --> 00:32:03.800
what you've done is to do a
substitution at the alpha

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.400
position, an 

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.333
electrophilic substitution at
the alpha position of a ketone 

00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:10.267
or an aldehyde. 

00:32:10.267 --> 00:32:13.267
So that's another pattern of
reactivity, and that's Chapter 

00:32:13.267 --> 00:32:17.767
19, these reactions of enols. 

00:32:17.767 --> 00:32:20.167
So enols, enolates, and
enolization. 

00:32:20.167 --> 00:32:23.700
A little bit from Chapter 19,
here. 

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.867
So here we have this alpha
hydrogen, we bring the base 

00:32:26.867 --> 00:32:28.700
in, as we said last time. 

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.700
This time, we're doing it
without having first put 

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.967
something on the O and having a
double-- 

00:32:36.967 --> 00:32:39.600
so what we've made now is and
anion. 

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.300
Its pKa is 19. 

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:41.900
Pretty acidic. 

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.567
But what's it normally for
alkanes, if you didn't have 

00:32:45.567 --> 00:32:48.533
the carbonyl there? You told me
last time, Chris. 

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:50.467
STUDENT: A little over 50. 

00:32:50.467 --> 00:32:51.667
PROFESSOR: A little over 50,
right. 

00:32:51.667 --> 00:32:58.300
So here we've got 31 powers of
10 advantage. 

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.367
That's how easy it is to make
the enolate, the anion. 

00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:06.767
Once you have the enolate with a
double bond here and a 

00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:09.833
charge on the oxygen, then you
can put the proton on the 

00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:12.367
oxygen and you have an enol. 

00:33:12.367 --> 00:33:15.067
So another number that's
interesting is the equilibrium 

00:33:15.067 --> 00:33:17.733
constant between here and here.

00:33:17.733 --> 00:33:22.167
So this is for forming the
anion, this is for the allylic 

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:24.000
rearrangement of the proton. 

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.600
So it's 5 times 10 to the minus
9th. 

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.033
So you're going to have very
little enol 

00:33:30.033 --> 00:33:35.000
compared to the ketone. 

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.433
But notice at equilibrium,
they'll be in equilibrium with 

00:33:40.433 --> 00:33:42.167
the same anion. 

00:33:42.167 --> 00:33:44.667
Because if you lose the proton
from here, you get the same 

00:33:44.667 --> 00:33:50.467
enolate anion that you get from
losing the proton here. 

00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:53.800
So if this is ever so much more
energetic, higher in 

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.733
energy than this, then this one
is going to 

00:33:56.733 --> 00:33:59.500
be unusually acidic. 

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.133
It's going to be easy for it to
lose that proton. 

00:34:03.133 --> 00:34:07.300
Since the ketone is about 11
kilocalories below the enol, 

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.800
the pKa of this is about 11. 

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.767
Very acidic. 

00:34:12.767 --> 00:34:18.467
Remember, normal alcohols are
like 16 and 17 pKa. 

00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:19.733
So this is very acidic. Now
let's go to-- 

00:34:21.967 --> 00:34:25.167
if one's good, more is better. 

00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:29.667
Put two carbonyls adjacent to
this alpha thing, so now both 

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:31.267
of them can stabilize it. 

00:34:31.267 --> 00:34:34.867
And now the pKa nine, and the
equilibrium 

00:34:34.867 --> 00:34:36.600
constant is now 3. 

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.300
It's better to have this than to
have this. 

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.200
Whereas here, it was 10 to the
minus eight of 

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.433
this compared to this. 

00:34:45.433 --> 00:34:49.500
Now it's three times as much
this as this at equilibrium. 

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.267
Notice, incidentally, this would
be hydrogen bonded. 

00:34:52.267 --> 00:34:55.667
And you could imagine that the
hydrogen could shift 

00:34:55.667 --> 00:34:57.067
from here to here-- 

00:34:57.067 --> 00:34:59.667
this double bond to here, this
double bond to here-- 

00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:03.033
the hydrogen could bounce back
between those two things. 

00:35:03.033 --> 00:35:04.633
In fact, it's even conceivable
it would 

00:35:04.633 --> 00:35:06.633
be halfway in between. 

00:35:06.633 --> 00:35:10.800
And Professor Vaccaro in this
lab is doing a lot of work on 

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.667
that kind of thing, compounds of
that sort. 

00:35:13.667 --> 00:35:17.167
So here, the ketone is
approximately equal to the 

00:35:17.167 --> 00:35:22.733
enol, because of the help from
conjugation and 

00:35:22.733 --> 00:35:25.700
from hydrogen bonding. 

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.767
Now if you have these double
bonds in there, now this 

00:35:30.767 --> 00:35:34.867
compound is favored by a factor
of 10 to the 13th. 

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:39.267
This enol is 10 to the 13th
favored at equilibrium over 

00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:42.167
this. so you got none of this,
it's all here. 

00:35:42.167 --> 00:35:43.267
Why? 

00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:45.233
Because this one is-- 

00:35:45.233 --> 00:35:48.200
you've gained the aromaticity,
that 30 kcal/mole 

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.967
that you didn't have over here.

00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:55.500
So the ketone is now 17
kilocalories above the enol. 

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.267
Here, the enol was 11
kilocalories above the ketone. 

00:36:00.267 --> 00:36:04.467
It's a complete range of ketone
to enol. 

00:36:04.467 --> 00:36:07.733
The pKa of this thing here is
10. 

00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:09.733
It's the same as this. 

00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:13.467
The anion is only about 13
kcal/mole 

00:36:13.467 --> 00:36:15.933
above phenol. 

00:36:15.933 --> 00:36:18.033
So it's very easy to lose that.

00:36:18.033 --> 00:36:22.633
And phenol, if you ever get it
on your skin, burns like fire. 

00:36:22.633 --> 00:36:25.667
It's just terrible because as an
organic compound, it 

00:36:25.667 --> 00:36:29.167
dissolves in your lipids and
then it's a strong acid. 

00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:30.733
So if you ever get it, you'll
know. 

00:36:30.733 --> 00:36:32.567
Did you ever get into nettles? 

00:36:32.567 --> 00:36:34.100
Stinging nettles? 

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.333
That's phenols for you. 

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.067
And the pKa in this case is -3.

00:36:41.067 --> 00:36:47.000
So this really easily loses a
proton. 

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.067
Now, how about reactions of
carboxylic acids? 

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.800
We went through, I think it was
five patterns of 

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.300
reactivity of carbonyl groups. 

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.900
Now we're going to look at the
carboxylic acids, which are in 

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.300
Chapter 17, and see what
patterns of reactivity we're 

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.433
going to expect. 

00:37:05.433 --> 00:37:07.733
Well first, you can get
addition, just as if it were a 

00:37:07.733 --> 00:37:08.933
carbonyl group. 

00:37:08.933 --> 00:37:11.167
So you can imagine doing that
kind of thing and 

00:37:11.167 --> 00:37:13.933
there, we'll see examples. 

00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:17.900
Another possibility is to do
substitution at carbon. 

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:23.300
So this is like the OH became a
leaving group somehow. 

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.833
And then OR came in. 

00:37:24.833 --> 00:37:26.433
So it's just like the ketones. 

00:37:26.433 --> 00:37:29.100
We said if there was a leaving
group here, here the leaving 

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.333
group is OH. 

00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:33.633
Or we make it into a better
leaving group somehow, maybe 

00:37:33.633 --> 00:37:35.900
by protonating it, something
like that. 

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.967
So we can get substitution at
carbon. But there's another 

00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:40.667
possibility in the acid. 

00:37:40.667 --> 00:37:43.400
You could start here, and you
could do the 

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.333
substitution at oxygen. 

00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:49.333
Get the same product, R on R,O,
C=O, 

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:52.000
get the same thing, but make
this bond, rather 

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.600
than making that bond. 

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.767
So you can have substitution at
carbon, you can have 

00:37:55.767 --> 00:37:57.033
substitution at oxygen. 

00:37:59.767 --> 00:38:02.200
And there's another possibility,
of course, 

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.433
substitution at the alpha
carbon. 

00:38:04.433 --> 00:38:09.067
So if you have an RH here, an
alpha hydrogen, then, 

00:38:09.067 --> 00:38:11.867
as we saw with aldehydes and
ketones-- 

00:38:11.867 --> 00:38:14.533
you can do a substitution there.

00:38:14.533 --> 00:38:17.667
And the good news in all this,
is almost 

00:38:17.667 --> 00:38:18.900
all of this is review. 

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.467
In fact, I should have said one
thing on 

00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:21.667
the previous slide. 

00:38:21.667 --> 00:38:25.700
That when you have the OH and
put the R on, making the R-O 

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.700
bond, that's an alpha
substitution also. 

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.067
It's just that it's an oxygen
rather than a carbon that has 

00:38:31.067 --> 00:38:32.767
the alpha hydrogen. 

00:38:32.767 --> 00:38:36.767
So you can have that, or on the
carbon side. 

00:38:36.767 --> 00:38:39.733
And the good news is, very much
of this is review. 

00:38:39.733 --> 00:38:44.567
For example, if you look at
pages 785 to 787, sections 

00:38:44.567 --> 00:38:48.400
16.9 to 16.10 in the Jones book,
you'll find that it's an 

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.767
old favorite of ours. 

00:38:49.767 --> 00:38:53.467
So let's just conclude the hour,
here, by going through 

00:38:53.467 --> 00:38:55.100
that again. 

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.767
It's the mechanism for acid
catalyzed 

00:38:57.767 --> 00:38:59.700
hydrolysis of acetal. 

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.567
We've already done this, but it
doesn't 

00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:03.033
hurt to do it again. 

00:39:03.033 --> 00:39:05.800
And it's this part of the text.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.400
So we have this acetal, and the
idea is to hydrolyze 

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.467
it, to go back to an aldehyde. 

00:39:11.467 --> 00:39:13.900
And how do we do it, do you
remember acid catalysis? 

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.067
Where do we start in? 

00:39:17.067 --> 00:39:19.833
Kate, are you going to help us
out, here? 

00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:22.833
Where does an acid attack this
compound, H plus? 

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.600
STUDENT: Something to do with
one of the oxygens? 

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.333
PROFESSOR: What is it about an
oxygen that makes the H plus 

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:33.067
want to go there? 

00:39:33.067 --> 00:39:33.900
STUDENT: The lone pair. 

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.633
PROFESSOR: The lone pair. 

00:39:35.633 --> 00:39:38.100
So the goal is going to be-- 

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.333
it's two steps. 

00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:43.000
First we're going to remove OR
and replace it by OH, then 

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.067
we're going to remove the other
OR and replace it by OH. 

00:39:47.067 --> 00:39:51.467
So the way we do it is with H
plus, as Kate tells us, and we 

00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:54.033
have the unshared pair, and we
do that and we get here. 

00:39:54.033 --> 00:39:58.667
This is exactly one we went over
before, but the old ones 

00:39:58.667 --> 00:40:01.467
are the best ones, right? 

00:40:01.467 --> 00:40:02.900
OK, what's going to happen next?

00:40:05.767 --> 00:40:07.000
John, what do you say? 

00:40:11.767 --> 00:40:13.267
Remember what the goal is? 

00:40:13.267 --> 00:40:15.167
What are we trying to do in the
first stage? 

00:40:15.167 --> 00:40:16.833
STUDENT: Remove RO? 

00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:19.700
PROFESSOR: We want to remove RO,
how are we going to do it?

00:40:24.467 --> 00:40:27.333
STUDENT: I'm not sure. 

00:40:27.333 --> 00:40:30.700
PROFESSOR: Well, we could just
have it leave now, right? 

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.467
Remove ROH. 

00:40:32.467 --> 00:40:37.433
What do we leave behind when we
pull off 

00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:39.000
ROH from this thing? 

00:40:44.133 --> 00:40:46.467
Where do the electrons go-- 

00:40:46.467 --> 00:40:48.600
it's this bond we're going to
break-- 

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.833
where are the electrons going
go, are they going to go on 

00:40:50.833 --> 00:40:53.600
the O, or are they going to go
on the C? 

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.367
STUDENT: On the O. 

00:40:55.367 --> 00:40:57.200
PROFESSOR: On the O, right? 

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.300
Because it's O plus, so it's
going to gain full ownership 

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.467
of that pair of electrons, so it
becomes ROH neutral. 

00:41:04.467 --> 00:41:05.967
So what's left behind on the
carbon? 

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.233
Nothing, right? 

00:41:11.233 --> 00:41:12.667
The electrons went away. 

00:41:12.667 --> 00:41:15.133
So what do we draw, then? 

00:41:15.133 --> 00:41:16.733
How do we draw that? 

00:41:16.733 --> 00:41:20.933
We have ROCH2 left, what do we
draw on the CH2? 

00:41:20.933 --> 00:41:21.800
STUDENT: A plus charge 

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.067
PROFESSOR: Right, OK. 

00:41:23.067 --> 00:41:26.067
So it's going to do that, and
we'll get that. 

00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:27.367
If this weren't RO, 

00:41:27.367 --> 00:41:29.900
if it were just H, say, 

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.967
that would be a crummy reaction.

00:41:32.967 --> 00:41:35.233
Why does it work here? 

00:41:35.233 --> 00:41:36.867
What's good about that cation? 

00:41:36.867 --> 00:41:40.200
STUDENT: The lone pairs on the
oxygen get stable. 

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.367
PROFESSOR: The vacant orbital is
able to stabilize those 

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:46.933
electrons, so the thing gets
unusually stable. 

00:41:46.933 --> 00:41:50.467
So you have that, and bingo. 

00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:53.800
So we've got the first RO off.
Now we have to 

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.967
replace it by OH. 

00:41:56.967 --> 00:41:59.267
Cassie, how are we going to do
that? 

00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:05.233
How are we going to put OH on
here after we took RO off? 

00:42:05.233 --> 00:42:09.967
STUDENT: It can attack the O on
the pi*. 

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.267
PROFESSOR: Speak up, please? 

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.633
STUDENT: The O on the pi*? 

00:42:19.633 --> 00:42:21.633
PROFESSOR: The O of the what? 

00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:22.900
STUDENT: pi*. 

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.733
PROFESSOR: OK, so we want to put
OH on that cabon. 

00:42:29.733 --> 00:42:31.633
How do we do it? 

00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:33.500
Say it again, please? 

00:42:37.833 --> 00:42:41.667
STUDENT: Can you attack the pi*?
[correction: Cassie is at least

00:42:41.667 --> 00:42:43.000
partly right. The instructor is
thinking of the resonance

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.367
structure on the left]. 

00:42:44.367 --> 00:42:47.133
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure what pi*
you're talking about. 

00:42:47.133 --> 00:42:50.933
There's a pi here, in this
resonance structure, but the 

00:42:50.933 --> 00:42:54.333
important thing that we have is
a vacant orbital on carbon. 

00:42:54.333 --> 00:42:56.467
STUDENT: There are lone pairs on
oxygen. 

00:42:56.467 --> 00:42:57.233
PROFESSOR: What oxygen? 

00:42:57.233 --> 00:42:57.733
O2? 

00:42:57.733 --> 00:43:00.967
STUDENT: Of the alcohol. 

00:43:00.967 --> 00:43:03.400
PROFESSOR: So suppose it attacks
the unshared pair on 

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.700
the alcohol, you form a bond
here. 

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.967
Now you're here. 

00:43:07.967 --> 00:43:11.233
That's going backwards. 

00:43:11.233 --> 00:43:14.933
So we're going to need something
else. 

00:43:14.933 --> 00:43:16.667
STUDENT: You have a water group.

00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:20.833
PROFESSOR: Yigit, what would you
use? 

00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:21.667
STUDENT: Water? 

00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:24.600
PROFESSOR: Water. 

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.300
So if you put water in, that
cation is usually stable, as 

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.800
John told us. 

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.400
So we bring water in, now we
make that bond and now we have 

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:39.300
OH there, but we also have H. Is
that a problem? 

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.500
Yigit? 

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.633
We want OH here, not H2O. 

00:43:44.633 --> 00:43:45.867
No, we just lost the proton. 

00:43:47.967 --> 00:43:51.300
So we've accomplished our first
step up here, right? 

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:56.267
We have a hemiacetal and we can
check that one off. 

00:43:56.267 --> 00:44:02.000
Now we have to take the second
RO off and replace it with OH. 

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.767
How are we going to do that? 

00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:05.833
Nathan?

00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:07.200
STUDENT: Same way.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.700
PROFESSOR: Tell me what we're
going to do. 

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.233
What's the first step? 

00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:14.567
STUDENT: An H plus-- 

00:44:14.567 --> 00:44:16.467
PROFESSOR: And where do we want
to put the H plus? 

00:44:16.467 --> 00:44:17.467
Here or here? 

00:44:17.467 --> 00:44:18.700
STUDENT: On the top one. 

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.267
PROFESSOR: On the top one, OK. 

00:44:20.267 --> 00:44:23.700
So we remove the second one by
bringing H plus in and put it 

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.633
on the top. 

00:44:24.633 --> 00:44:27.100
Next? 

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.600
STUDENT: Lose the water. 

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.433
PROFESSOR: Lose water. 

00:44:32.433 --> 00:44:36.100
Pardon me, lose alcohol 

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.067
to get this, and now? 

00:44:38.067 --> 00:44:39.900
STUDENT: Add water. 

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.167
PROFESSOR: Add water. 

00:44:43.767 --> 00:44:46.533
No, we don't need to add water.

00:44:46.533 --> 00:44:49.000
If we wanted to put the second
one in, true. 

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.867
I misled you. 

00:44:50.867 --> 00:44:53.300
But really where you go is here.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.333
So you just lose a proton. 

00:44:55.333 --> 00:45:01.200
So you've taken the ketal to a
carbonyl by way of a 

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.400
hemiacetal or a hemiketal. 

00:45:06.433 --> 00:45:10.933
So the overall transformation,
then, is water plus acetal, 

00:45:10.933 --> 00:45:14.500
acid catalyzed to give carbonyl
plus two ROHs. 

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.733
And we wrote it this way before.

00:45:17.733 --> 00:45:21.867
They come together and pull it
apart, and so the H2O enters 

00:45:21.867 --> 00:45:24.733
all three molecules. 

00:45:24.733 --> 00:45:26.600
OK, that's how much we wanted to
do today. 

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.267
We've made it. 

00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:31.000
We made it to the end, we're
caught up, actually, with 

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
where we were last year.

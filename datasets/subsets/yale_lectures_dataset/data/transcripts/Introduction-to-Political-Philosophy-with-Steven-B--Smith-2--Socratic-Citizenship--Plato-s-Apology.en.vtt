00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.150
Professor Steven Smith:
Today we start with Plato,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.970
Plato's Apology of
Socrates.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.034
This is the best introductory
text to the study of Political

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:16.550
Philosophy.
Why?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.840
Let me give you two reasons.
First, it shows Socrates,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.562
the reputed founder of our
discipline, the founder of

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:30.354
Political Science,
and I will say a little bit

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:34.054
more about that later on today,
explaining himself and

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:38.218
justifying himself,
justifying his way of life

00:00:38.218 --> 00:00:44.300
before a jury of his peers.
It shows Socrates speaking in a

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.179
public forum,
defending the utility of

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.901
philosophy for political life.
And, secondly,

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:57.945
the Apology demonstrates
also the vulnerability of

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:02.630
political philosophy in its
relation to the city,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.739
in its relation to political
power.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:11.904
The Apology puts on
trial not merely a particular

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:17.732
individual, Socrates,
but puts on trial the very idea

00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:21.887
of philosophy.
From its very beginnings,

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:26.504
philosophy and the city,
philosophy and political life,

00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:30.950
have stood in a sort of tension
with one another.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.920
Socrates is charged,
as we will see,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.842
by the city for corrupting the
youth and impiety toward the

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:41.770
Gods, right?
In other words,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.900
he's accused of treason,
a high capital offense.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.584
No other work of which I am
aware helps us better think

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:54.914
through the conflict.
I would even say,

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:59.625
the necessary and inevitable
conflict, between the freedom of

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.629
the mind and the requirements of
political life.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:08.596
Are these two things,
are these two goods as it were,

00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:12.129
freedom of mind and political
life,

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.474
are they compatible or are they
necessarily at odds with one

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:19.936
another?
That seems to me to be,

00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:22.778
in some ways,
the fundamental question that

00:02:22.778 --> 00:02:25.620
the Apology asks us to
consider.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.216
Okay?
Now for generations,

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:40.277
the Apology has stood
out as a symbol for the

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:46.580
violation of free expression.
It sets the case for the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.728
individual committed to the
examined life over and against a

00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:56.479
bigoted and prejudiced
multitude.

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.151
The clearest statement of this
view of, again,

00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:04.229
the individual set against the
mob in some ways,

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:09.569
is found in a work of a very
famous civil libertarian of the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.919
nineteenth century,
a man named John Stuart Mill.

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.671
In his famous tract called
simply On Liberty,

00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:23.305
Mill wrote, "Mankind can hardly
be too often reminded that there

00:03:23.305 --> 00:03:27.351
was once a man named Socrates
between whom and the legal

00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:31.102
authorities of his time there
took place a memorable

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:33.686
collision."
Over and again,

00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:37.087
and Mill is a kind of a famous
case of this,

00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:41.832
Socrates has been described as
a martyr for freedom of speech

00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:45.707
and he has been somewhat
extravagantly compared at

00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:50.456
various times to Jesus,
to Galileo, to Sir Thomas More

00:03:50.456 --> 00:03:55.129
and has been used as a role
model for thinkers and political

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.139
activists from Henry David
Thoreau,

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.770
to Gandhi, to Martin Luther
King.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.661
So, Socrates has become a very
central symbol of political

00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:12.520
resistance and resistance to
political power,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.449
and, of the dangers to the
individual of unchecked rule.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.541
But, this reading of the
Apology as you might say,

00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:28.705
is a kind of brief for freedom
of expression and a warning

00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:32.649
against the dangers of
censorship and persecution.

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:35.790
Although this has been
enormously influential over the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.050
centuries, at least over the
last century and a half,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.458
you have to ask yourself:
is this the reading that Plato

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:47.751
intended?
Did Plato want us to read the

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:49.200
dialogue this way?

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.969
As a teacher of mine used to
say, "You read Plato your way,

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:03.408
I'll read him his way."
But, how did Plato intend this

00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:07.961
dialogue to be understood?
Note that Socrates never

00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:12.720
defends himself by reference to
the doctrine of unlimited free

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.720
speech.
He doesn't make that claim.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.937
He doesn't make the claim about
the general utility of freedom

00:05:21.937 --> 00:05:27.125
or unlimited speech.
Rather, he maintains as he puts

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:32.824
it near the end of the defense
speech, that the examined life

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:36.881
is alone worth living.
Only those, in other words,

00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:39.932
engaged in the continual
struggle to clarify their

00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:42.760
thinking,
to remove sources of

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.897
contradiction and incoherence,
only those people can be said

00:05:48.897 --> 00:05:53.950
to live worthwhile lives.
"The unexamined life is not

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.671
worth living."
Socrates confidently,

00:05:57.671 --> 00:06:04.060
defiantly asserts to his
listeners, to his audience.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.201
Nothing else matters for him.
His, in other words seems to be

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.803
a highly personal,
in many ways,

00:06:11.803 --> 00:06:16.166
highly individual quest for
self perfection and not a

00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:21.370
doctrine about the value of
freedom of speech in general.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:28.726
But, even though you might say,
Socrates seems to be engaged

00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:32.110
in, again, this highly personal
quest for self perfection,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.926
there is something,
which one can't avoid,

00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:38.636
deeply political about the
Apology and about his

00:06:38.636 --> 00:06:41.750
teaching.
At the heart of the dialogue or

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.259
at the heart of this speech
rather is a quarrel,

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.632
a quarrel with his accusers
over the question,

00:06:48.632 --> 00:06:53.927
never stated directly perhaps,
but over the question of who

00:06:53.927 --> 00:07:00.137
has the right to educate future
citizens and statesmen of the

00:07:00.137 --> 00:07:04.378
city of Athens.
Socrates' defense speech,

00:07:04.378 --> 00:07:09.992
like every platonic dialogue,
is ultimately a dialogue about

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:13.176
education.
Who has the right to teach,

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:17.216
who has the right to educate?
This is in many ways for

00:07:17.216 --> 00:07:22.300
Socrates the fundamental
political question of all times.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.128
It is the question of really
who governs or maybe put another

00:07:27.128 --> 00:07:30.829
way, who should govern,
who ought to govern.

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:36.093
Remember also that the city
that brought Socrates to trial

00:07:36.093 --> 00:07:40.987
was not just any city,
it was a peculiar kind of city,

00:07:40.987 --> 00:07:44.203
it was Athens.
And Athens was,

00:07:44.203 --> 00:07:49.071
until only fairly recent times
in human history,

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:53.940
the most famous democracy that
ever existed.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.163
I say fairly recent times
until, you know,

00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:59.286
the American democracy.
But it was, until at least the

00:07:59.286 --> 00:08:02.114
eighteenth or nineteenth
century, the most famous

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:05.850
democracy that ever existed.
The speech of Socrates before

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.738
the jury is perhaps the most
famous attempt to put democracy

00:08:09.738 --> 00:08:12.550
itself on trial.
It is not merely Socrates who

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.443
is on trial.
Socrates intends to put the

00:08:15.443 --> 00:08:18.449
democracy of Athens itself on
trial.

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:22.902
Not only does the
Apology force Socrates to

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:26.810
defend himself before the city
of Athens,

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.877
but Socrates puts the city of
Athens on trial and makes it

00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:36.500
defend itself before the high
court of philosophy.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:42.186
So, the ensuing debate within
the dialogue can be read as a

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:46.500
struggle again over who has
title to rule.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.406
Is it the people?
Is it the court of Athens,

00:08:49.406 --> 00:08:52.774
the dáº½mos,
to use the Greek word for "the

00:08:52.774 --> 00:08:55.167
people,"
or is it Socrates the

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:59.846
philosopher-king who should be
vested with ultimate political

00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:01.925
authority?
That is, of course,

00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:04.561
the quest and it's taken up in
a very vivid way,

00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:07.309
much more explicit way in the
Republic,

00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:11.550
but it runs throughout the
Apology and you can't

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.476
really understand the
Apology unless you see

00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:20.580
that this is the question that
Socrates is posing throughout.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.417
So, I have some names put on
the board and some dates,

00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:39.706
because I want to talk a little
bit about the political context

00:09:39.706 --> 00:09:42.345
of this dialogue.
One can of course read,

00:09:42.345 --> 00:09:45.076
there's nothing wrong with
reading the Apology,

00:09:45.076 --> 00:09:48.562
again,
as a kind of enduring symbol of

00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:51.682
the plight of the,
you might say,

00:09:51.682 --> 00:09:56.850
the just individual confronted
with an unjust mob,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.582
or an unjust political rule.
It's, again,

00:10:00.582 --> 00:10:06.003
a question that Plato takes up
in the Republic when a

00:10:06.003 --> 00:10:11.240
character in the book named
Glaucon who happens to be,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.800
as it were, the brother of
Plato, asks Socrates if it is

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.554
actually better to be just or
simply to have the reputation

00:10:18.554 --> 00:10:21.757
for justice?
And Socrates says it is better

00:10:21.757 --> 00:10:26.019
to be just, even if that results
in persecution and death.

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:29.923
But the trial is not,
again, just an enduring symbol

00:10:29.923 --> 00:10:34.844
of justice versus injustice,
it is an actual historical

00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:40.598
event that takes place in a
particular moment of political

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:45.760
time and this bears,
I think, decisively on how we

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.539
come to understand the case both
for and against Socrates.

00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:54.120
Let me talk a little bit about
that context.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:05.184
The trial of Socrates takes
place in the year 399 and all of

00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:10.019
these refer to before the common
era, 399.

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:18.068
Some of you will know that that
trial follows very quickly upon

00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:23.779
the heals of the famous
Peloponnesian War.

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:27.748
This was the war related by
Socrates' slightly older

00:11:27.748 --> 00:11:30.782
contemporary,
a man named Thucydides who

00:11:30.782 --> 00:11:34.440
wrote the history of the
Peloponnesian War,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.844
a war that took place between
the two great powers of the

00:11:38.844 --> 00:11:43.800
Greek world between the Spartans
and their allies and Athens and

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.760
its allies.
The Athens that fought this war

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.962
against Sparta was an Athens at
the height of its political

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:58.254
power and prestige under the
leadership of its first citizen

00:11:58.254 --> 00:12:01.657
Pericles,
whose name is also up there at

00:12:01.657 --> 00:12:03.934
the very top.
Under Pericles,

00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:07.250
Athens had built the famous
Acropolis.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:12.751
It had established Athens as a
mighty and redoubtable naval

00:12:12.751 --> 00:12:17.873
power and it created an
unprecedented level of artistic

00:12:17.873 --> 00:12:23.552
and cultural life,
even today known simply as

00:12:23.552 --> 00:12:28.534
Periclean Athens.
But Athens was also something

00:12:28.534 --> 00:12:33.610
completely unprecedented in the
world, it was a democracy.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.322
And, again, even today the
expression "Athenian democracy"

00:12:38.322 --> 00:12:42.951
connotes an ideal of the most
complete form of democratic

00:12:42.951 --> 00:12:46.010
government that has ever
existed.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:51.186
"We are the school of Hellas."
This is what Pericles boasts to

00:12:51.186 --> 00:12:55.454
his listeners in the famous
funeral oration told by

00:12:55.454 --> 00:12:58.465
Thucydides.
"We throw our city open to the

00:12:58.465 --> 00:13:01.734
world and never exclude
foreigners from any opportunity

00:13:01.734 --> 00:13:06.154
of learning and observing,
even though the eyes of an

00:13:06.154 --> 00:13:11.585
enemy may profit from our
liberality," Pericles boasts

00:13:11.585 --> 00:13:16.091
once again.
The question maybe you want to

00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:22.233
ask about this is how could the
world's first freest and most

00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:28.581
open society sentence to death a
man who spoke freely about his

00:13:28.581 --> 00:13:34.416
own ignorance and professed to
care for nothing so much as

00:13:34.416 --> 00:13:40.386
virtue and human excellence?
Now, at the outbreak of the

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:44.275
Peloponnesian War,
Socrates was just under 40

00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:48.626
years of age.
And, we learned from the speech

00:13:48.626 --> 00:13:54.026
that Socrates himself served in
the military and served in

00:13:54.026 --> 00:13:58.960
defense of his country.
The war, the Peloponnesian War,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.899
was fought as you can see over
a considerable length of time,

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:10.774
on and off for almost a period
of 30 years and was concluded in

00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:15.320
the year 404 with the defeat of
Athens,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:23.126
the installing of a pro-Spartan
oligarchy, a pro-Spartan regime

00:14:23.126 --> 00:14:30.176
known simply as the Thirty
Tyrants who ruled Athens for a

00:14:30.176 --> 00:14:32.490
year.
The next year,

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.538
403, the Tyrants,
The Thirty as they were called,

00:14:36.538 --> 00:14:40.838
were driven out and a
democratic government was once

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:46.062
again reestablished in Athens.
Just three years later,

00:14:46.062 --> 00:14:50.114
three men named Anytus,
Meletus and Lycos,

00:14:50.114 --> 00:14:55.351
all of whom had been part of
the democratic resistance

00:14:55.351 --> 00:14:59.700
movement against the Spartan
oligarchy,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.220
brought charges against
Socrates.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.990
The charges against him were:
corrupting the young and

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.759
disbelieving in the Gods that
the city believes in.

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:12.163
So, you can see that the
charges were brought by people

00:15:12.163 --> 00:15:16.331
who were themselves,
again, part of a democratic

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:22.204
resistance movement and the
names of Anytus and Meletus as

00:15:22.204 --> 00:15:27.389
you've read,
you know, appear in the speech

00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:30.421
itself.
So, the charges brought against

00:15:30.421 --> 00:15:33.480
Socrates did not simply grow out
of thin air.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.080
Maybe we should rephrase the
question.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.649
Not why did the Athenians bring
Socrates to trial?

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:44.326
But, why did they permit him to
carry on his practice of

00:15:44.326 --> 00:15:48.270
challenging the law and the
authority of the law for as long

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.340
as they did?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.338
Okay?
Add to this the fact that when

00:16:00.338 --> 00:16:06.290
Socrates was brought to trial
again, the democracy had only

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:12.345
recently been reestablished but
that many friends and former

00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:18.195
students of Socrates had been
themselves implicated in the

00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:22.299
rule of the hated Thirty
Tyrants.

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:26.728
Among the members of The Thirty
was a man named Critias,

00:16:26.728 --> 00:16:31.480
and there's actually a platonic
dialogue named after him,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.149
a man named Critias,
who was a relative of Plato's

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:39.792
and another man named Charmides
whose name is also the title of

00:16:39.792 --> 00:16:44.799
a platonic dialogue,
Charmides who is Plato's uncle.

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:49.057
Plato himself,
he tells us much later in life

00:16:49.057 --> 00:16:54.573
in his famous Seventh Letter,
Plato himself was invited by

00:16:54.573 --> 00:17:00.379
his relatives to help to form a
part of the government of The

00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:05.872
Thirty and later Plato said,
"That so abhorrent did they

00:17:05.872 --> 00:17:10.847
become that they made the older
democracy look like the Golden

00:17:10.847 --> 00:17:13.748
Age."
So, the point I'm suggesting is

00:17:13.748 --> 00:17:17.230
that many of Socrates' students
and associates,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:23.046
including Plato himself,
had some connection with this

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:30.180
oligarchical government that had
ruled Athens for a brief time.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.690
And, Socrates was himself not
above suspicion.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:40.483
We often, don't we even today
yes, we often judge teachers by

00:17:40.483 --> 00:17:45.012
their students,
by the company they keep,

00:17:45.012 --> 00:17:50.529
yes, don't we?
No one is above suspicion.

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:54.762
Socrates himself had been a
close associate of a man named

00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:58.772
Alcibiades, probably the most
prominent Athenian in the

00:17:58.772 --> 00:18:03.614
generation after Pericles.
Alcibiades was the man who

00:18:03.614 --> 00:18:09.043
engineered the disastrous
Sicilian expedition and later

00:18:09.043 --> 00:18:13.870
ended his life as a defector
going to Sparta.

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:21.605
His complex relationship with
Socrates is, by the way,

00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:26.936
recounted in the drunken speech
that Alcibiades gives in Plato's

00:18:26.936 --> 00:18:31.552
dialogue, Symposium.
So, you can see that the trial

00:18:31.552 --> 00:18:34.940
of Socrates, the little speech
that you have read,

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.275
takes place in the shadow of
military defeat,

00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:45.609
of resistance,
of conspiracy and betrayal.

00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:50.819
Socrates was 70 years old at
the time of the trial.

00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:56.089
So, this was a highly charged
political environment.

00:18:56.089 --> 00:19:03.618
Far more volatile than for
example the kind of partisan

00:19:03.618 --> 00:19:10.310
quarrels we see today in our
republic, I hope.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.500
Okay?

00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:22.636
So, let me talk about the
accusations, let me move from

00:19:22.636 --> 00:19:26.390
the political context of the
speech to the accusations.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.691
And, I say accusations because
there, as you read,

00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:35.957
if you read closely you will
see there were actually two sets

00:19:35.957 --> 00:19:39.819
of accusations leveled against
Socrates.

00:19:39.819 --> 00:19:43.827
Early in the speech Socrates
claims that his current accusers

00:19:43.827 --> 00:19:46.983
Anytus and Meletus,
again, the democratic

00:19:46.983 --> 00:19:51.073
resistance fighters,
the charges they have brought

00:19:51.073 --> 00:19:55.665
against him are themselves the
descendants of an earlier

00:19:55.665 --> 00:20:00.089
generation of accusers who were
responsible for,

00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:04.251
he claims, maligning and
creating an unfavorable

00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:10.175
prejudice against Socrates.
"These charges are not new," he

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:14.938
tells the jury,
and many members of the jury,

00:20:14.938 --> 00:20:21.650
he says, will have formed an
unfavorable opinion about him.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.522
This was the day before there
were intense forms of jury

00:20:24.522 --> 00:20:27.708
selection, where they would ask
people: "Do you have a view of

00:20:27.708 --> 00:20:30.253
the case?"
Many of the jurors would have

00:20:30.253 --> 00:20:33.004
known Socrates,
or certainly would have heard

00:20:33.004 --> 00:20:36.189
of him and,
he says, would have had already

00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:40.212
an unfavorable opinion formed
about him by this earlier

00:20:40.212 --> 00:20:44.771
generation of accusers.
Reference he makes to a comic

00:20:44.771 --> 00:20:49.743
poet, yes, a comic poet,
an unequivocal reference to the

00:20:49.743 --> 00:20:54.715
playwright Aristophanes,
whose name I have put up on the

00:20:54.715 --> 00:20:57.258
board.
Aristophanes is the one who

00:20:57.258 --> 00:21:00.241
created the original or the
initial prejudice against

00:21:00.241 --> 00:21:03.411
Socrates.
What was that prejudice that

00:21:03.411 --> 00:21:05.980
Aristophanes,
this comic poet,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.698
had created?
The allusion to Aristophanes

00:21:09.698 --> 00:21:14.817
and the comic poet is a part of
what Plato calls in Book X of

00:21:14.817 --> 00:21:19.164
the Republic,
the old quarrel between

00:21:19.164 --> 00:21:23.813
philosophy and poetry.
This quarrel is a staple of

00:21:23.813 --> 00:21:26.914
Plato's dialogues,
is a central theme,

00:21:26.914 --> 00:21:30.267
not only of the
Symposium in which

00:21:30.267 --> 00:21:34.878
Aristophanes and Socrates are
actually shown at the same

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:39.621
dinner table with one another.
But, it is also a key feature

00:21:39.621 --> 00:21:42.960
of the Republic which we
will be reading in a week,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.142
where Socrates offers an
elaborate proposal for the

00:21:46.142 --> 00:21:48.369
censorship and control of
poetry,

00:21:48.369 --> 00:21:52.448
if it is to be made compatible
with the demands of political

00:21:52.448 --> 00:21:55.571
justice.
In fact, in a way you cannot

00:21:55.571 --> 00:22:00.955
understand the Republic
unless you understand the poetic

00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:05.905
backdrop to it and Socrates'
long standing engagement with

00:22:05.905 --> 00:22:11.029
the poetic tradition and this
back and forth between himself

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:14.849
and the man he calls this comic
poet.

00:22:14.849 --> 00:22:19.596
The core of this quarrel
between the philosopher and the

00:22:19.596 --> 00:22:24.169
poet, between Socrates and
Aristophanes is not just an

00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:29.433
aesthetic judgment or it is not
simply an aesthetic quarrel it

00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:32.486
is,
again, deeply political or at

00:22:32.486 --> 00:22:36.019
least has something very
political about it.

00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:41.103
It gets to the essence of the
question of who is best equipped

00:22:41.103 --> 00:22:46.269
to educate future generations of
citizens and civic leaders.

00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:51.855
Are the philosophers or are the
poets, you might say,

00:22:51.855 --> 00:22:57.334
the true legislators for
mankind, if you want to use

00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:01.434
Shelley's dictum?
Which one legislates for

00:23:01.434 --> 00:23:06.344
mankind at the time of Socrates?
The Greeks already had a

00:23:06.344 --> 00:23:10.696
century's long tradition of
poetic education,

00:23:10.696 --> 00:23:16.235
going back centuries to the
time of Homer and Hesiod that

00:23:16.235 --> 00:23:23.160
set out certain exemplary models
of heroic virtue and civic life.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:30.909
The Homeric epics were to the
Greek world what the Bible is to

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:36.568
our world that is to say,
in some respects the ultimate

00:23:36.568 --> 00:23:41.332
authority, regarding the way of
the Gods, their relation to the

00:23:41.332 --> 00:23:46.019
world and the type of virtues
appropriate to human beings.

00:23:46.019 --> 00:23:50.647
The virtues endorsed by the
poetic tradition of which

00:23:50.647 --> 00:23:54.920
Aristophanes is the great
representative here,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.911
the great inheritor and
representative,

00:23:56.911 --> 00:23:59.951
the virtues of this tradition
were the virtues of a warrior

00:23:59.951 --> 00:24:04.428
culture,
of war-like peoples and men at

00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:07.240
war.
These were the qualities that

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.208
had guided the Greeks for
centuries and contributed to

00:24:11.208 --> 00:24:15.259
their rise to power.
It contributed to Athens' as

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:19.918
well as Sparta's rise to
greatness from a small dispersed

00:24:19.918 --> 00:24:22.602
people,
to a great world power and,

00:24:22.602 --> 00:24:26.170
again, allowed them to achieve
a level of artistic,

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:32.521
intellectual and political
accomplishment akin to

00:24:32.521 --> 00:24:38.343
Renaissance Florence,
Elizabethan England and

00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:43.170
Thirties Weimar.
So, what is at stake in this

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:48.152
quarrel between Socrates and the
poetic tradition that he alludes

00:24:48.152 --> 00:24:48.620
to?

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:57.673
First, Socrates' manner of
teaching is markedly different

00:24:57.673 --> 00:25:00.250
from the poets,
right?

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.090
Does anyone know here the
opening line of the

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.118
Iliad?
Homer's Iliad,

00:25:07.118 --> 00:25:09.819
does anyone know the first
line?

00:25:09.819 --> 00:25:17.730
Anyone remember that from high
school?

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.559
"Sing Goddess the wrath of
Achilles," right?

00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:24.290
"Sing Goddess the wrath of
Achilles."

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.864
The poets are oracular, right?
They call on Gods and Goddesses

00:25:29.864 --> 00:25:35.125
to inspire them with song,
to fill them with inspiration

00:25:35.125 --> 00:25:41.055
to tell stories of people with
super-human strength and courage

00:25:41.055 --> 00:25:43.315
and anger.
By contrast,

00:25:43.315 --> 00:25:46.274
you could say,
the method of Socrates is not

00:25:46.274 --> 00:25:49.009
oracular.
It is not story telling;

00:25:49.009 --> 00:25:52.811
it is conversational,
it is argumentative,

00:25:52.811 --> 00:25:56.890
if you want to use the word he
applies to it,

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:01.632
it is dialectical.
Socrates makes arguments and he

00:26:01.632 --> 00:26:07.036
wants others to engage with him,
to discover which argument can

00:26:07.036 --> 00:26:12.180
best withstand the test of
rational scrutiny and debate.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.045
There are no arguments in
Homer's Iliad or

00:26:15.045 --> 00:26:18.443
Odyssey.
You hear strong and compelling

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:21.500
stories but no arguments.
Socrates makes,

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.407
in other words,
continual questioning and not

00:26:24.407 --> 00:26:28.039
the telling of stories and the
recitation of verses,

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:33.930
the essence of this new
political education.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.990
He questions the methods of
teaching of the poets.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.274
But, secondly,
again, Homer and the poets sing

00:26:42.274 --> 00:26:47.364
the virtues of men at war.
Socrates wants to replace the

00:26:47.364 --> 00:26:52.296
warrior citizen with a new kind
of citizen, a whole new set,

00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:55.390
you might say,
of citizen virtues.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.947
The new Socratic citizen,
let's call him that for a

00:26:58.947 --> 00:27:03.500
moment, the new Socratic citizen
may have some features in common

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.362
with the older Homeric warrior.
But, Socrates ultimately wants

00:27:08.362 --> 00:27:12.079
to replace military combat with
a new kind of,

00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:15.118
you might call it,
verbal facility,

00:27:15.118 --> 00:27:19.051
verbal combat,
in which again the person with

00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:23.609
the best argument is declared to
be victorious.

00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:26.596
The person with the best
argument, let the best argument

00:27:26.596 --> 00:27:29.644
prevail.
The famed Socratic method of

00:27:29.644 --> 00:27:34.565
argumentation is basically all
that remains of the older

00:27:34.565 --> 00:27:38.769
pre-Socratic culture of struggle
and combat.

00:27:38.769 --> 00:27:44.032
The new Socratic citizen is to
be trained in the art of

00:27:44.032 --> 00:27:49.295
argument and dialectic,
and we will talk a little later

00:27:49.295 --> 00:27:55.392
about what that means.
So, it is a challenger to the

00:27:55.392 --> 00:28:02.517
poets and all they stand for,
the century-long tradition of

00:28:02.517 --> 00:28:08.660
poetic education that Socrates
asserts himself,

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:14.214
that Socrates presents himself.
The Apology shows

00:28:14.214 --> 00:28:19.512
Socrates as offering a new model
of citizenship,

00:28:19.512 --> 00:28:22.330
a new kind of citizen.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.893
His challenge to the poets is
in a way the basis for the

00:28:30.893 --> 00:28:34.339
resentment that is built up
against him,

00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:39.380
in that Aristophanes and what
he calls the earlier accusers

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.396
have brought to bear.
In fact, you might say,

00:28:43.396 --> 00:28:48.920
so seriously was Socrates taken
by Aristophanes and the poets,

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:54.384
that Aristophanes devoted an
entire play, he wrote an entire

00:28:54.384 --> 00:28:58.829
play, about Socrates called the
Clouds,

00:28:58.829 --> 00:29:04.028
devoted to debunking and
ridicule Socrates' profession of

00:29:04.028 --> 00:29:07.093
learning.
Aristophanes' play sometimes is

00:29:07.093 --> 00:29:10.454
even included in certain
editions of the book you're

00:29:10.454 --> 00:29:12.345
reading,
like this one,

00:29:12.345 --> 00:29:16.593
it has the edition of
Aristophanes' Clouds in

00:29:16.593 --> 00:29:21.089
it, along with the
Apology and Crito.

00:29:21.089 --> 00:29:25.192
The existence of that play
shows to all of us just how

00:29:25.192 --> 00:29:29.063
seriously Socrates was taken by
the greatest of his

00:29:29.063 --> 00:29:32.160
contemporaries and Aristophanes
was,

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.720
along with Sophocles and
Euripides and others,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.359
among the greatest of the Greek
playwrights.

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:41.475
The mockery,
you might say,

00:29:41.475 --> 00:29:45.380
mockery of Socrates,
remains one of the sincerest

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.500
forms of flattery;
they took him very seriously.

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:55.267
Let me just say something about
the Clouds,

00:29:55.267 --> 00:29:57.890
this comic play,
this satire on Socrates,

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:03.386
because it is part of that
initial accusation that Socrates

00:30:03.386 --> 00:30:07.930
says is leveled against him.
Here, Aristophanes presents

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:11.520
Socrates as an investigator,
and this is part of the first

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.100
charge,
remember an investigator of the

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.624
things aloft and the things
under the earth and who makes

00:30:17.624 --> 00:30:19.890
the weaker argument the
stronger.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:25.277
That's the argument that
Socrates says Aristophanes

00:30:25.277 --> 00:30:27.540
brings against him.

00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:35.900
In this play,
Socrates is presented as the

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.726
head, the leader,
the director of what we might

00:30:40.726 --> 00:30:47.019
think of as the first think tank
known to human history.

00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:52.538
It's called in the play itself
the Phrontisterion which means,

00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:57.966
or is sometimes translated as
the Thinkery or the Thinketeria

00:30:57.966 --> 00:31:02.400
or simply a kind of think tank
where fathers,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.566
Athenian fathers,
bring their sons to be

00:31:05.566 --> 00:31:09.950
indoctrinated into the mysteries
of Socratic wisdom.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:13.392
And in the play Socrates is
shown hovering,

00:31:13.392 --> 00:31:17.981
flying above the stage in a
basket in order to be able to

00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:22.450
better observe the clouds,
the things aloft, right?

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.519
But, also in many ways
symbolizing Socrates',

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:28.309
at least on the Aristophanes'
account,

00:31:28.309 --> 00:31:32.127
Socrates' detachment from the
things down here on earth,

00:31:32.127 --> 00:31:35.319
the things that concern his
fellow citizens.

00:31:35.319 --> 00:31:40.641
Socrates is a kind of what in
German people would call

00:31:40.641 --> 00:31:44.811
Luftmensch.
He's a man up in the air,

00:31:44.811 --> 00:31:49.825
you know, he's so detached,
he doesn't have his feet on the

00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:53.157
ground.
And Socrates is shown not only

00:31:53.157 --> 00:31:58.258
mocking the Gods in doing this,
but he is shown by Aristophanes

00:31:58.258 --> 00:32:03.522
to teach incest and to teach all
of the things that violate every

00:32:03.522 --> 00:32:06.208
decent,
human taboo--incest,

00:32:06.208 --> 00:32:11.049
the beating of one's parents,
all these kinds of things.

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:16.541
Socrates is presented as
exhibiting kind of a corrosive

00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:22.846
skepticism which is at the core
of Aristophanes' charge against

00:32:22.846 --> 00:32:26.244
him.
To make a long story short,

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:30.934
the play concludes with
Socrates' think tank being

00:32:30.934 --> 00:32:35.720
burned to the ground by a
disgruntled disciple.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.032
An object lesson for all later
professors, I would say,

00:32:40.032 --> 00:32:41.710
who teach nonsense.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.220
Right?
Don't get any ideas.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.991
Take a match to the department.
So, how accurate is that

00:32:57.991 --> 00:33:00.536
picture of Socrates,
the man who investigates the

00:33:00.536 --> 00:33:03.079
things aloft and the things
under the ground?

00:33:03.079 --> 00:33:07.447
The Clouds was written
in 423 when Socrates was in his

00:33:07.447 --> 00:33:12.033
mid-forties and the Aristophanic
Socrates is essentially what we

00:33:12.033 --> 00:33:15.884
call a natural philosopher.
Again, investigating the things

00:33:15.884 --> 00:33:19.119
aloft, under the ground.
He is what we would call today

00:33:19.119 --> 00:33:21.329
a scientist, a natural
scientist.

00:33:21.329 --> 00:33:25.210
But, this seems quite removed,
doesn't it, from the Socrates

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:29.090
who is brought up on charges of
corrupting the young and the

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.453
impiety.
In the Apology and here

00:33:32.453 --> 00:33:37.945
is where Socrates actually tells
the story, very important in the

00:33:37.945 --> 00:33:41.724
course of this speech;
he provides a kind of

00:33:41.724 --> 00:33:46.004
intellectual biography of an
incident that occurred long

00:33:46.004 --> 00:33:50.440
before the trial and set him on
a very different path.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.539
He recalls the story,
don't you remember,

00:33:53.539 --> 00:33:56.950
of a man named Charephon,
a friend of his,

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:01.692
who had gone to the Delphic
Oracle, who had gone to Oracle

00:34:01.692 --> 00:34:06.600
of Delphi, and asked if there
was anyone wiser than Socrates

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.737
and was told there was not.
Socrates tells us that when he

00:34:11.737 --> 00:34:16.170
was told this he expressed
disbelief in the Oracle.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:20.422
He didn't believe it and in
order to disprove the Oracle's

00:34:20.422 --> 00:34:24.824
statement, he says he began a
lifelong quest to find someone

00:34:24.824 --> 00:34:28.668
wiser than himself.
A quest, in the course of which

00:34:28.668 --> 00:34:32.239
lead him to interrogate the
politicians, the poets,

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.453
the craftsmen,
all people reputed to be

00:34:35.453 --> 00:34:39.174
knowledgeable,
and his conversations lead him

00:34:39.174 --> 00:34:43.024
to ask questions,
not about natural scientific

00:34:43.024 --> 00:34:47.469
phenomena, but questions about
the virtues, as he tells us,

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:50.335
the virtues of a human being
and a citizen,

00:34:50.335 --> 00:34:53.814
what we would call today
perhaps moral and political

00:34:53.814 --> 00:34:57.904
questions.
That incident that Socrates

00:34:57.904 --> 00:35:04.869
tells here represents what one
could call the famous Socratic

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:10.210
turn, Socrates' second sailing
so to speak.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:15.251
It represents the moment in the
life of Socrates where he turns

00:35:15.251 --> 00:35:20.130
away from the investigation of
natural phenomena to the study

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.220
of the human and political
things,

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:28.116
the moral and political things.
The Delphic story for what it's

00:35:28.116 --> 00:35:33.796
worth marks a major turning
point in Socrates' intellectual

00:35:33.796 --> 00:35:37.101
biography.
The move from the younger,

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:40.227
we could call him,
Aristophanic Socrates,

00:35:40.227 --> 00:35:44.082
the Socrates who,
again, investigates the things

00:35:44.082 --> 00:35:47.063
aloft and under the earth,
to the later,

00:35:47.063 --> 00:35:50.119
what we could call platonic
Socrates.

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:54.723
The founder of political
science, Socrates is the founder

00:35:54.723 --> 00:35:59.327
of our discipline who asks about
the virtues of moral and

00:35:59.327 --> 00:36:03.836
political life.
Socrates' account of this turn,

00:36:03.836 --> 00:36:08.968
this major turn in his life and
career, leaves a lot of

00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:13.220
questions unanswered,
that maybe even occurred to you

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.780
as you were reading this
dialogue, reading this speech.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.124
Why does he turn away from the
investigation of natural

00:36:21.124 --> 00:36:25.550
phenomena to the study of human
and political things?

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:29.443
The Delphic Oracle is
interpreted by Socrates,

00:36:29.443 --> 00:36:34.289
at least to command engaging
with others in philosophical

00:36:34.289 --> 00:36:38.591
conversation.
Why does he interpret it this

00:36:38.591 --> 00:36:41.216
way?
Why does this seem the proper

00:36:41.216 --> 00:36:45.490
interpretation to engage in
these kinds of conversations?

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.156
It is this Socrates who is
brought up on charges of

00:36:53.156 --> 00:36:56.238
corruption and impiety,
yet none of this quite answers

00:36:56.238 --> 00:36:59.610
the question of what is the
nature of Socrates' crime.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:06.472
What did he do?
What did corruption and impiety

00:37:06.472 --> 00:37:09.076
mean?
To try to answer those

00:37:09.076 --> 00:37:14.364
questions we would have to look
a little bit at what is meant by

00:37:14.364 --> 00:37:17.470
this new kind of Socratic
citizen.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.000
Who is this citizen?

00:37:27.449 --> 00:37:31.050
The charges brought against
Socrates by Anytus and Meletus

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.966
we see are not the same exactly
as those brought against him by

00:37:34.966 --> 00:37:37.469
Aristophanes,
the comic poet.

00:37:37.469 --> 00:37:40.824
Anytus and Meletus talk about
impiety and corruption,

00:37:40.824 --> 00:37:44.372
not investigating the things
aloft and making the weaker

00:37:44.372 --> 00:37:47.460
argument the stronger.
What do these terms mean?

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.874
Impiety and corruption,
in what sense are these civic

00:37:52.874 --> 00:37:56.314
offenses?
What could impiety have meant

00:37:56.314 --> 00:37:59.480
to his audience and his
contemporaries?

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.342
At a minimum,
we would think the charge of

00:38:03.342 --> 00:38:07.300
impiety suggests disrespect of
the gods.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.633
Impiety need not be the same
thing as atheism,

00:38:11.633 --> 00:38:15.099
although Meletus confuses the
two,

00:38:15.099 --> 00:38:20.824
but it does suggest irreverence
even blasphemy toward the things

00:38:20.824 --> 00:38:24.550
that a society cares most deeply
about.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:28.716
Yes?
To be impious is to disrespect

00:38:28.716 --> 00:38:33.750
those things a person or a
society cares most deeply about.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.096
When people today,
for example,

00:38:36.096 --> 00:38:40.554
refer to flag burning as a
desecration, as desecrating the

00:38:40.554 --> 00:38:44.151
flag they are speaking the
language of impiety,

00:38:44.151 --> 00:38:47.738
right.
They are speaking the language

00:38:47.738 --> 00:38:52.860
of some kind of religious or
quasi-religious desecration.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:57.285
Meletus, whose name in Greek
actually means care,

00:38:57.285 --> 00:39:03.001
accuses Socrates of not caring
properly for the things that his

00:39:03.001 --> 00:39:07.037
fellow citizens care about.
So, the question is:

00:39:07.037 --> 00:39:08.980
"What does Socrates care
about"?

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:14.595
What does he care about?
Consider the following:

00:39:14.595 --> 00:39:18.644
every society,
which we know,

00:39:18.644 --> 00:39:27.610
operates within the medium of
belief or faith of some kind.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.335
Take our founding documents,
the Declaration of

00:39:30.335 --> 00:39:32.289
Independence,
the Constitution,

00:39:32.289 --> 00:39:36.179
all men are created equal,
that we are endowed with

00:39:36.179 --> 00:39:40.691
inalienable rights that all
legitimate government grows out

00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:45.033
of consent and the like.
These beliefs form something

00:39:45.033 --> 00:39:48.432
like a kind of national creed,
you might say,

00:39:48.432 --> 00:39:50.662
American,
national creed,

00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:55.349
what it means to be an American
and not someone else.

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:59.393
Yet, how many people could give
a kind of reasoned account of

00:39:59.393 --> 00:40:03.639
what makes these beliefs true,
or what grounds these beliefs?

00:40:03.639 --> 00:40:07.402
Most of us, most of the time,
hold these beliefs as a matter

00:40:07.402 --> 00:40:11.561
of faith, as a matter of belief,
because we have learned about

00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:14.856
them from childhood,
because they were written by

00:40:14.856 --> 00:40:18.769
Thomas Jefferson or some other
reputed high authority.

00:40:18.769 --> 00:40:23.361
To question those beliefs would
seem to exhibit a kind of lack

00:40:23.361 --> 00:40:26.900
of civic faith,
faith in our ruling opinions.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.220
In short you might say a lack
of civic piety or respect.

00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:38.934
Socrates clearly believes that
piety or faith is the natural

00:40:38.934 --> 00:40:41.828
condition of the citizen.
Every society,

00:40:41.828 --> 00:40:46.753
no matter of what kind requires
a kind of faith in its ruling

00:40:46.753 --> 00:40:50.199
principles, in its fundamental
beliefs.

00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:54.925
But belief seems to be
threatened from at least two

00:40:54.925 --> 00:40:58.599
sources.
One is simple disbelief or

00:40:58.599 --> 00:41:05.005
unbelief, a kind of rejection of
ruling opinion simply because

00:41:05.005 --> 00:41:08.962
you don't like it.
You know, when you see the

00:41:08.962 --> 00:41:12.737
bumper sticker on the car
"Question Authority," this kind

00:41:12.737 --> 00:41:16.630
of rejection of ruling opinion.
But the other source of

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.039
conflict with ruling opinion is
from philosophy.

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:23.555
Philosophy is not the same
thing as simple disbelief or

00:41:23.555 --> 00:41:26.679
rejection, but the two can be
easily confused.

00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:31.927
Philosophy grows out of a
desire to replace opinion with

00:41:31.927 --> 00:41:36.030
knowledge, opinion or belief
with reason.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.786
For philosophy,
it is not enough simply to hold

00:41:38.786 --> 00:41:41.661
a belief on faith,
but one must be able to give a

00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:44.896
rational account,
a reasoned account for one's

00:41:44.896 --> 00:41:48.567
belief, its goal again is to
replace civic faith with

00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:51.159
rational knowledge.
And, therefore,

00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:55.176
philosophy is necessarily at
odds with belief and with this

00:41:55.176 --> 00:41:58.687
kind of civic faith.
The citizen may accept certain

00:41:58.687 --> 00:42:02.585
beliefs on faith because he or
she is attached to a particular

00:42:02.585 --> 00:42:04.949
kind of political order or
regime.

00:42:04.949 --> 00:42:07.599
But, for the philosopher this
is never enough.

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:11.993
The philosopher seeks to judge
those beliefs in the light of

00:42:11.993 --> 00:42:15.300
true standards,
in the light of what is always

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.429
and everywhere true as a quest
for knowledge.

00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:21.980
There is a necessary and
inevitable tension between

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.530
philosophy and belief,
or to put it another way,

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:31.977
between philosophy and the
civic pieties that hold the city

00:42:31.977 --> 00:42:35.454
together.
From this point of view,

00:42:35.454 --> 00:42:39.869
I want to say,
was Socrates guilty of impiety?

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:43.210
On the face of it,
the answer to that seems yes.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:46.510
Socrates does not care about
the same thing his fellow

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.838
citizens care about.
His opening words to the jury

00:42:49.838 --> 00:42:52.067
seem to convey this,
"I," he says,

00:42:52.067 --> 00:42:55.579
"am simply foreign to the
manner of speech here."

00:42:55.579 --> 00:43:00.006
This seems to be a statement of
his alienation or disaffection

00:43:00.006 --> 00:43:03.199
from the concerns of his fellow
Athenians.

00:43:03.199 --> 00:43:08.289
I know nothing about what you
do or what you care about.

00:43:08.289 --> 00:43:12.005
Yet it certainly doesn't seem
right to say that Socrates does

00:43:12.005 --> 00:43:15.070
not care at all.
He claims to care deeply,

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:19.517
perhaps more deeply than anyone
has ever cared around him,

00:43:19.517 --> 00:43:22.875
before or since.
And among the things he cares

00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:25.657
deeply about,
he says, is this calling to do

00:43:25.657 --> 00:43:29.150
nothing as he says "To do
nothing but persuade you,

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:33.526
both younger and older,
not to care for bodies and

00:43:33.526 --> 00:43:38.260
money, but, how your soul will
be in the best possible

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.603
condition."
That concern with the state of

00:43:41.603 --> 00:43:45.210
one's soul, he tells the jury,
has lead him not only to

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:48.671
impoverish himself,
but to turn himself away from

00:43:48.671 --> 00:43:51.969
the public business,
from the things that concern

00:43:51.969 --> 00:43:55.059
the city to the pursuit of
private virtue.

00:43:55.059 --> 00:43:59.457
And, here are the words of his
that I want to leave you with

00:43:59.457 --> 00:44:02.960
today from section 31d of the
Apology.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.300
Socrates writes,
"This is what opposes my

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.782
political activity.
And, its opposition seems to me

00:44:08.782 --> 00:44:12.780
to be all together noble for
know well, men of Athens,

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.795
if I had long ago attempted to
be politically active I would

00:44:16.795 --> 00:44:20.811
long ago have perished and I
would benefited neither you nor

00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:24.265
myself.
Now do not be vexed with me

00:44:24.265 --> 00:44:28.416
when I speak the truth.
For there is no human being who

00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:31.740
will preserve his life if he
genuinely opposes either you or

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.290
any other multitude and prevents
many unjust and unlawful things

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:38.379
from happening in the city."
Rather, he says,

00:44:38.379 --> 00:44:43.065
"if someone who really fights
for justice is going to preserve

00:44:43.065 --> 00:44:48.522
himself even for a short time,
it is necessary for him to lead

00:44:48.522 --> 00:44:52.199
a private, rather than a public
life."

00:44:52.199 --> 00:44:54.815
Think about that,
if someone who really fights

00:44:54.815 --> 00:44:58.536
for justice is going to preserve
himself, it is necessary for him

00:44:58.536 --> 00:45:00.920
to lead a private,
not a public life.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:06.028
How are we to understand
Socrates' claim that the pursuit

00:45:06.028 --> 00:45:11.319
of justice requires him to turn
away from public to private

00:45:11.319 --> 00:45:14.003
life?
What is this new kind of

00:45:14.003 --> 00:45:17.264
citizen, again,
concerned with this kind of

00:45:17.264 --> 00:45:20.757
private virtue,
this concern for the virtue of

00:45:20.757 --> 00:45:24.242
one's soul?
That's the question I want us

00:45:24.242 --> 00:45:29.035
to consider again for next week
as we finish the Apology

00:45:29.035 --> 00:45:32.360
and move our way up to the
Crito.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.000
Okay?
We'll do that for next week.

(deep tones resonating)
(tape fast forwarding)

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.680
- Okay, everybody, greetings.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.480
Welcome. Happy Tuesday.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.260
Our job today is to get
through the Habsburgs.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.193
I wanna start with making a
few remarks about mistakes,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.470
my own and those of others.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.630
Okay, so the funny thing
about giving a class

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.060
where there were two million views online

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.460
is that I can hear from
a large number of people

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.590
about things that go on in this class.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.490
So I just wanna say to those
of you who are watching online,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.323
you are right.

00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:43.230
Milorad Pavic, the author of
"Dictionary of the Khazars"

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.640
was a Serb and not a Croat.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.663
I'm very sorry.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:49.830
And on etymology of punch, obviously,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.260
I should have said that's
a common Indo-European root

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.450
that is shared in the
Slavic and other languages.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.900
Okay, as far as errors
in the transcription,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.500
please do not email me about
errors in the transcription.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.750
Email the people who are
doing the transcription,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.250
and that email address
is right over there,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.050
and the cameraman is going to give you

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.160
that email address there.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.610
So if you find errors in the
transcription, do not email me.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.602
Thank you very much.

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:13.810
(class chuckling)

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.270
(chuckling) Okay, so we
have a really important

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.830
and interesting job today,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.170
which is to get through
the Habsburg family.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.410
So families matter a lot in history.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.820
Larger forces matter too.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.680
Structural forces matter too.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.310
Climate matters, geology
matters, economics matter,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.180
but individuals and families
matter very much as well.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.010
This would be a very
different war if someone

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.440
besides Volodymyr Zelenskyy
were president of Ukraine.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.850
This would be a very
different war if someone

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.740
besides Joe Biden were
president in the United States.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.990
Individuals do matter, families do matter,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.200
and it's important to have
them inside history as well.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.170
It's an especially easy case
to make for the Habsburgs

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.230
because they were in power
in some form or other

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.650
for about 600 years, one place or another,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.880
and for sometimes they were in
power over much of the world.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.900
So the historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.640
that for about half a millennium,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.350
it wasn't that the Habsburgs turned

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.370
around the history of Europe,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.010
it was that the history of
Europe turned around them,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.540
and for about a hundred years,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.880
you could even say as much
about the history of the world.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.550
So if you are going to be a history major

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.410
or if you're going to be someone

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.790
especially who's focusing
on the history of Europe,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.790
and there's one family
name that you should know,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.730
this is probably the family
name that you should know.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.230
So we are going to get around

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.730
to why the Habsburgs are so important

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.960
to the history of Ukraine,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.820
but we're gonna make sure first,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.320
and this is gonna be
the bulk of the lecture,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.140
that we have a sense of
who the Habsburgs are.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.780
So if the Habsburgs were so important,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.050
why is it that no one
talks that much about them,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.780
or, more interestingly, why is it that

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.180
of all the peoples around the world,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.570
the people who remember
the Habsburgs fondly

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.850
tend to be in Western Ukraine?

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.050
So the Habsburg touched,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.140
the Habsburgs touch all kinds of people,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.140
including the Aztecs, including the Inca,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.790
they touched all kinds of people,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.880
but they're remembered
fondly in Western Ukraine.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.800
By the end of the lecture,
you should have a sense

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.930
of why it is that
they're remembered fondly

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.970
in Western Ukraine.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.550
In terms of the overall
arguments and method

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.230
that we've been using in this class,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.500
this is gonna be one more
example of how friction

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.100
or contact between larger
powers, between empires,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.850
has to do with the creation of the nation.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.450
The Habsburgs are going to
turn out to be very important

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.470
in the origins of Ukraine,
and yet, and yet, and yet,

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.820
when the Habsburgs, when
Maria Theresia takes part

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.570
in the First Partition of Poland in 1772

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.180
and brings in a tiny bit of territory

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.370
where most people speak Ukrainian,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.290
she is thinking many things,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.110
but she is certainly not
thinking about Ukraine

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.130
or the history of Ukraine,
or the future of Ukraine.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.950
Nevertheless, this little encounter,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.460
one tiny part of where
Ukrainian is spoken in the world

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.910
and also one tiny part
of the Habsburg monarchy,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.980
that overlap between one tiny part

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.810
of the zone where Ukrainian is spoken

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.180
and one tiny part of the Habsburg world,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.330
that little tiny overlap,
which is called Galicia,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.750
is going to turn out to
be very, very important

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.770
for the history of the Ukrainian nation.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.980
It's gonna be important

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:30.600
for a certain kind of,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.700
a especially certain kind of moment.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.480
I'm gonna say the 1880s to the
1980s, for about a century,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.440
Galicia is going to be
the most important part

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.090
of what's now Ukraine.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.600
That period comes and that period goes.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.270
It's already gone, so with all due respect

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.880
to those of you who are from Halychyna,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.320
that period is now passed.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.850
The center, the natural center,
of European politics, sorry,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.700
of Ukrainian politics
is actually the East.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.240
It's the East now, and it's
the East for most of the time

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.680
that we're teaching in this class,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.970
but for a century or so,
Galicia is extremely important,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.480
and you might even argue necessary, right?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.180
So you can imagine there
might be an essay question,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.380
which would be something like,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.440
if Galicia had not been part
of the Habsburg monarchy,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.210
what would've happened to Ukraine, right?

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.850
That's how important this zone is.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.470
So we're talking about a moment.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.610
We're talking about a moment

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.340
when some Ukrainian-speaking
territory is part

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.210
of the Habsburg monarchy.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.140
That moment lasts from 1772 to 1918.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.450
And then we're talking about
a moment where that zone,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.160
we will be later talking about a moment

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.650
where that zone is crucial
to Ukraine as a whole,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.160
which is roughly the 1880s to the 1890s.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.330
Okay, so, but my goal here

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.820
is to make sure you know
who the Habsburgs are

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.750
because if you walked away

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.490
from this class saying the Habsburgs,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.680
I mean, with all due respect
to the history of Ukraine,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.450
if you walked away from
this class thinking

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.860
the Habsburgs are important

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.710
because of this thing they did
in Galicia for a few decades,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.700
that would be an unfortunately
nationalistic interpretation

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.160
of this family, so we're
gonna make sure that we know

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.290
who the Habsburgs are.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.560
We have talked about a couple
of kinds of empires so far.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.630
We've talked about empires that break out

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.750
into the Age of Discovery
and empires that don't.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.400
So when we think about the success

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.650
of the Russian Empire in the 18th century,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.540
one of the broad factors behind that

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.270
was that Russia managed
to reach the Pacific

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.240
and also that Russia, by way
of English traders first,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.510
manages to trade West as
well into the Atlantic.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.600
Russia breaks out into the
world, not just on land,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.240
but also by making
contact with the oceans.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.700
A couple of other empires or large states

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.340
that don't do that are the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.590
which comes to an end in the 18th century,

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.840
and the Ottoman Empire,
which is weakening.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.230
The Ottoman Empire can't break
out of the Mediterranean.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.650
The Habsburgs are a very
interesting kind of middle case

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.460
because the Habsburgs do break
out into the wider world.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.730
Indeed, they break out into the
wider world more effectively

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.790
and more extravagantly
and more spectacularly

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.950
than any other family.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.630
In the early 16th century,
they are governing Spain.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.090
By the late 18th century,
sorry, 16th century,

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.340
they're also governing Portugal.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.320
They're governing the Netherlands

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.530
for much of the 1500s and 1600s.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.580
Why does that matter?

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.310
Because the Spanish, the Portuguese,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.810
and the Dutch are the major
exploring powers at the time.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.000
If you cast a glance at the bottom part

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.220
of the map that I handed out,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.640
which is entitled Habsburg
Earth, that gives you an idea.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.070
We think of these things
as Spanish history,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.780
the Spanish Empire, Portuguese history,

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.754
the Portuguese Empire.

00:07:44.754 --> 00:07:46.830
We think of the Dutch traders,

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.520
but the Habsburgs actually
ruled these countries

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.100
in the 1500s and in the 1600s.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.830
So the Habsburgs ruled domains

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.890
which break out into the
world more powerfully,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.860
more spectacularly than
any other single family,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.000
but then it's all broken in 1700,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.300
that the Spanish branch
of the Habsburgs dies out,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.820
and the Habsburgs at that
point are basically reduced

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.740
to being a European power.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.190
That year, 1700, one year after 1699,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.900
which, as you all know,

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.210
is the time of the Treaty of Karlowitz,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.520
which marks when the Habsburgs break out

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.780
into Southeastern Europe.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.860
So 1699, 1700, you can remember
as a kind of turning point

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.620
when the Habsburgs are
ceasing to be a world power,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.550
but at exactly the same moment
becoming a Southeastern,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.343
East Central, or East European power.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.620
The final thing I wanna
say about the Habsburgs

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.620
before I get into the chronology
is that I would ask you

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.120
if you have a vision of
the Habsburgs in mind,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.220
maybe you don't, maybe
this is all completely new,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.870
but if you have a vision
of the Habsburgs in mind,

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.770
and you come from a francophone
or an anglophone background,

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.660
the vision that you have
in your mind is probably

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.010
very much people who were
mad, bad, and unfit to rule,

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.200
that you probably have in mind the idea

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.593
that this was some kind
of antique, cantankerous,

00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:11.760
doomed monarchy which was anachronistic

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.880
because it had lots of nations
inside of it at the same time

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.400
and fell apart during the First World War.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.870
That's the stereotype,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.960
and that stereotype comes
from American and British

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.140
and French propaganda
during the First World War.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.100
So if you come from,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.900
if you happen to come
from those traditions,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.750
a French or a British or
American tradition in education,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.360
probably insofar as the
Habsburgs figure at all,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.080
it's as a prison of
nations, yada, yada, yada.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.130
I mean, I'm gonna puncture
that just for a moment,

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.870
just one moment.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.810
When the Habsburgs were
fighting the Americans

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.730
at the end of the First World War,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.490
when Wilson gave his famous speech

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.330
in which he was announcing

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.700
the principle of
self-determination, there were,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.920
okay, I'm gonna put this as a question

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.910
'cause you guys look awake.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.440
There were how many African Americans

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.940
in the American Congress
listening to that speech?

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.403
Come on, you can do it.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.610
It's the safest possible guess.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.230
Zero is correct, right?

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.463
Zero is correct,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.990
whereas in the Habsburg
Parliament at the same time,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.330
all the nationalities
were represented, right?

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.190
All the nationalities were represented.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.860
So in many ways, the Habsburg
monarchy was actually

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.230
a more liberal country than
the United States of America

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.330
at the time when they were waging war.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.130
That's just one little detail.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.650
And when you think about
the Habsburgs today,

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.090
and you think about that stereotype,

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.490
you could also think
about it in these terms.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.490
Were the Habsburgs behind the times or,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.790
insofar as these ways of thinking

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.590
about things are acceptable,

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.140
maybe they were ahead of their time?

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.120
Because by the time you
get to the 19th century,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.370
the late 19th century, early 20th century,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.490
the Habsburgs were a multinational,

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.173
pluralistic liberal zone
with very messy politics,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.520
but a growing economy

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.040
and not entirely unlike the
European Union of today, right?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.680
So is that model of being multinational

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.930
and having cranky politics
based on compromise

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.480
among nationalities, is
that a thing of the past,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.790
or is that maybe a thing of
the present or the future?

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.380
Okay, so, so much for the repair

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.910
of the image of the Habsburgs.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.850
Now we're gonna zoom back into
the history of the Habsburgs,

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.380
and you can make your own judgements.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.060
So the Habsburgs go all the way back.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.170
They really are an old family.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.520
They're not as old as they say they are.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.600
They don't actually go back

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.513
to Remus and Romulus and the wolf,

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.680
but they do go back to the year 1020.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.650
They built a castle
called the Habichtsburg,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.240
which is the first sign
of their existence,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.920
and that's the year 1020.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.830
So basically their
existence is contemporaneous

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.920
with the foundation of
Kyivan Rus' as we know it,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.210
which is 988.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.210
The Habsburgs have been
around for a long time.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.830
Most of this history isn't gonna seem

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.360
to have much to do with Ukraine,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.693
but we need to know who they
are before they get to Ukraine.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.250
These people make their money

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.390
by not from glamorous conquest,
and this is sort of a theme.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.570
They make their money at the
beginning by tolls over bridges

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.300
and by taxing travelers
and things like that

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.153
in what's now Austria,
what's now Switzerland.

00:12:20.178 --> 00:12:24.120
The one great or the greatest
Austrian Habsburg warlord

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.600
was Rudolf von Habsburg,
who was born in 1218

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.750
and is elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1273.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.400
He's the founder of this dynasty

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.550
as a major European dynasty.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.053
What's the Holy Roman Empire?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.620
The Holy Roman Empire is the,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.590
so the title of Holy
Roman Emperor is given

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.630
to the King of the Franks.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.320
If you'll remember,
the initial geopolitics

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.660
of this class are the Franks in the West

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.630
and the Byzantines in
the South or in the East.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.420
Charlemagne is the great
King of the Franks.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.380
The idea that there is an
emperor is revived in the West

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.630
with the Kingdom of the Franks,

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.430
and then when that line dies out,

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.510
it's restored again in
the year 962, when Otto,

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.900
who is king of Germany, is
named Holy Roman Emperor,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.353
crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.910
From that point forward, until
Napoleon does away with it,

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.570
there's going to be something
called the Holy Roman Empire.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.720
The Habsburgs are going
to claim superiority

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.310
over other families largely
by being Holy Roman Emperors

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.990
and by claiming that they always should be

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.190
Holy Roman Emperors.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.730
But many interesting things
about the Holy Roman Empire,

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.790
that one of them is that
the emperor was elected,

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.740
admittedly, by a very
small group of electors,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.220
of a handful of electors,
but nevertheless elected.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.590
The way elections work though

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.170
is that they're very closely associated

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.060
with bouts of violence,
which is, of course,

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.560
something we in America
don't know anything about.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.240
When Rudolf of Habsburg was
elected Holy Roman Emperor

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.870
in 1273, and this was
immediately contested

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.390
by probably the most impressive king

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.700
of the most impressive
kingdom of the time,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.380
which was the wonderfully
named Otakar Premysl II, right?

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.690
The name Otakar Premysl was so good

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.850
that there had to be at
least two of them, right?

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.600
So Otakar Premysl II, who
was king of the Czechs,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.090
he really was the probably
the most impressive ruler

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.413
of Europe at the time.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.370
The Czechs have just done this funny thing

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.350
where they've claimed that
they've hosted, did you see this?

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.370
They've claimed that they've hosted

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.199
a referendum in Kaliningrad?

00:14:34.199 --> 00:14:36.203
(student speaking faintly)
Yeah, that goes-

00:14:36.203 --> 00:14:37.080
- [Student] Královec.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.453
- Yeah, sorry, Královec.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.230
This goes back to Otakar Premysl II

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.553
and the great Czech
kingdom of the Middle Ages.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.280
So he immediately contest
this, and there's a huge war

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.860
in which Rudolf of Habsburg actually wins

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.350
and Otakar Premysl II is killed,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.790
which is one of these
turning points, right?

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.070
I mean, this class is not about this,

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.290
but by rights, you could say,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.760
the Czechs probably should have been

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.200
the dominant power in Eastern Europe,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.590
and they just had some bad
luck at a couple of moments,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.300
and this was one of them.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.300
After Rudolf dies in 1291,
his son is not elected,

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.830
so his son then contests the election.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.990
That seems like a strangely
euphemistic way of putting it.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.940
It makes it seem like I'm
holding up a ballot or something

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.380
and say, "You didn't count this one,"

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.360
but that's not what you mean
by contest the election.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.720
I mean that he killed
the man who was elected

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.760
on the battlefield with his own hands,

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.050
spearing him through the face,

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.650
and finishing him off with
a much feared ballock knife,

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.360
which is exactly what it sounds like,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.880
after which he was elected, right?

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.620
After which he was elected.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.420
So you can see the history of elections.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.590
In the history of elections,

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.150
there's a lot of disentanglement to do

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.620
between the peaceful procedure

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.270
and the violence that attends elections,

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.733
and it's a lot of hard work.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.490
The run of the Habsburgs
ends in a meaningful way

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.690
in 1346 when another great Czech king,

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.250
the greatest Czech king, Charles,

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.250
the one after whom the
university and the bridge,

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.113
if you've ever been there, is named.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.543
King Charles is elected
Holy Roman Emperor in 1346.

00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:19.707
This is very important
for the history the Czechs

00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:22.050
and history of Central
Europe, but for our purposes,

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.040
we just wanna note that the Luxembourgs,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.410
that's Charles' family, yes,
the same as the country,

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.500
the Luxembourgs now become Holy
Roman Emperors for a while,

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.480
and this is a big problem
for the Habsburgs,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.980
not least because the Luxembourgs do

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.950
an extremely good job of it.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.380
Charles promulgates something
called the Golden Bull

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.230
in 1346, which is a statute
of imperial governance,

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.400
which straightened things out,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.683
which includes electoral procedures.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.590
I want say that it says no ballock knife,

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.540
but it doesn't actually say that,

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.710
that would be too good to be true,

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.410
but it includes electoral
procedures so the transitions

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.810
could be a little bit
easier in the future.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.020
The Habsburgs respond to
this in a way which is poetic

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.120
and characteristic, in
which I want you to mark

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.890
because it is a feature of this family,

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.350
as you'll know if you've
read "The Red Prince."

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.213
They respond to this
with a beautiful kind of,

00:17:10.213 --> 00:17:12.720
a beautiful nostalgic attack.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.540
They invent something called
the Privilegium Maius.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.040
They just make it up.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.520
They just make it up, which
is not an unknown theme

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.690
in East European history, by the way,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.583
people just making up documents.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.490
There's a lot of this later on,

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.080
which is good fun for historians.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.610
So they just make up something called

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.860
the Privilegium Maius in 1359,

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.137
and the idea is that the
Habsburgs are the oldest family,

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:37.320
and the Habsburgs have the
right to rule Rome, et cetera,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.440
because they have land grants from Nero

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.390
and land grants from Julius Caesar.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.280
Okay, that is not true at all.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.450
It's just completely made up,

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.370
but it's a nice story, right?

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.560
It's a nice story, and
if you have a nice story

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.240
and you have power, then
sometimes you can make

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.223
your nice story seem like it's true.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.210
So the Luxembourgs are gonna be ruling

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.870
these Holy Roman Emperors until 1437,

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.710
at which point a crisis
and a marriage are going

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.600
to flip the Holy Roman
Empire back to the Habsburgs.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.490
The crisis, which we've run across before,

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.060
is the Black Plague, which
begins in 1347 in Europe,

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.180
wipes out maybe 1/3 of the population.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.160
This crisis, the pestilence,
this crisis of disease,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.130
is associated with a spiritual crisis.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.150
This is the time,

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.520
if you ever had like a
survey European class,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.380
you'll remember there was one pope,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.300
then there were two popes,
and there were three popes,

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.620
and the popes were in various places,

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.360
and they were hostage to kings and so on.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.653
This is that period.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.713
In the 14th century, multiple popes.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.640
As the Black Death had died down,

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.020
a council was called in
Constance for 1414 to 1415,

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.910
and the purpose of the
Council in Constance was

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.850
to make order in the Christian
Church to make order in what?

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.410
In the Catholic Church.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.960
And one of the ways that
order was to be made

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.930
were that these annoying heretics

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.420
from Bohemia were going to be brought in,

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.120
and the most annoying of
these heretics from Bohemia

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.060
was a fellow called Jan Hus.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.900
So Jan Hus, J-A-N H-U-S,
I think he's on the sheet,

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.340
he was a sort of, I mean,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.020
this is anachronistic way of putting it,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.670
but he was a kind of pre-Protestant.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.250
He had many ideas which would be familiar

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.690
from radical Protestantism,

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.270
like that you can preach in
the language of the people,

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.410
you can preach in the vernacular,

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.050
you should preach facing the people.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.900
He also had the idea that,
this is a really radical idea,

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.340
the church is not an institution.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.550
As such, the church comes
from the people, right?

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.710
Therefore, all the property of the church

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.570
is kind of up in question.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.920
The church shouldn't be wealthy.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.780
The wealth of the church should
be returned to the people.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.880
These kinds of ideas,
that's just a sample,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.700
but you can see how that would
be understood as a threat

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.030
to the established church as it was.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.280
So on the 6th of July, 1415,

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.030
Jan Hus was burned at the stake
at the Council of Constance

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.493
after a trial, which he
found unsatisfactory.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.930
And it's for this reason if you go,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.480
again, if you go to Prague,
which I urge you to do,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.283
there's a fine statue of
Jan Hus with the slogan,

00:20:12.936 --> 00:20:14.790
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.560
the truth with triumph.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.000
The truth will be victorious.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.600
So this is relevant for us
because this precipitates

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.503
the situation in which
the Habsburgs come back.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.120
The Czech nobility in much
of the Czech bourgeoisie,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.970
and many Czechs in general,
including peasants,

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.420
identify with Hus'
version of Christianity.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.430
By the way, what was Hus' job?

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.340
He was basically the dean of a university.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.810
Interesting, right?

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.680
So Hus, oh, and when he lectured,

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.520
just fun detail, he lectured
in Czech a lot of the time,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.920
but his notes were in Latin.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.690
Yeah, interesting, right?

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.900
Okay, so anyway, so Hus is killed,

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.123
but many Czechs believe in
his version of Christianity,

00:21:01.123 --> 00:21:05.820
and they rebel against
their own Luxembourg king,

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.760
who by this time is called Sigismund,

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.770
Sigismund Luxembourg from Luxembourg.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.450
And he picks up the challenge.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.810
He says the heretics will be washed away.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.627
And so there's a kind of civil war

00:21:17.627 --> 00:21:21.120
in the Bohemian lands
against the Luxembourgs,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.460
which was led by this fantastic guy

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.610
who I wish I had more time for, Jan Zizka,

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.400
who was a one-eyed military genius,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.440
who invented a whole
bunch of military tactics

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.690
which were later used by other people,

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.150
like, well, stealing all the gold

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.003
from the churches is not
original, but he did that.

00:21:40.659 --> 00:21:45.150
He did things like take, he
would take wagons full of hay

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.040
and make circles of them, right?

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.500
So as kind of mobile fortresses,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.420
and then shoot out from the inside.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.370
Clever things which
people hadn't seen before.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.590
He took good advantage of firearms.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.960
So this war goes on for a long time,

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.700
and now you see the opening.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.530
This is the opening for the Habsburgs

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.770
because the Habsburgs, good Catholics,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.370
volunteer to come in on the
side of the Luxembourgs,

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.790
and as the Habsburgs tend
to do, they manage to get,

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.620
they manage to connect it with marriage.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.400
They always managed to,
this is their secret.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.540
There's a Hungarian king

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.670
I'm gonna mention later
called Matthias Corvinus

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.147
who wrote, of course in Latin,

00:22:22.147 --> 00:22:24.570
"Let others fight wars.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.180
Thou, happy Austria, marry."

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.490
That slogan, which is sort
of beautiful and concise,

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.620
gives you a sense of how they got on

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.960
for those 600 years of power.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.900
So the Habsburgs come in on the side

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.060
of the Luxembourgs in this war.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.760
They don't actually help
very much on the battlefield,

00:22:43.173 --> 00:22:45.840
but the leader of the Habsburg family,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.490
the Habsburg family at the
time, who is Albert IV,

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.750
gets himself the daughter
of the Luxembourg ruler,

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.563
whose name is Elizabeth, gets
her promised as his bride.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.780
And they marry in 1422, which
means that Albert von Habsburg

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.210
is gonna become the
successor, which he does.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.240
He becomes Holy Roman Emperor in 1437,

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.610
and then the Habsburgs are
going to be Holy Roman Emperors

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.360
for the next three
centuries after that, right?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.980
So Black Death, religious
confusion, religious rebellion.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.410
The Habsburgs sneak in at the last moment,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.580
marry the right person,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.440
and suddenly they're
Holy Roman Emperors again

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.210
for the next three centuries.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.840
And as Holy Roman
Emperors, what do they do?

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.080
They promulgate this Privilegium Maius.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.220
They just issue it.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.090
They say, "This is true.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.460
This is official. This is law.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.830
We have a special right to rule."

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.790
Okay, so I mentioned Corvinus.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.883
He's the one, he mounts the
next challenge to the Habsburgs.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.770
He's the greatest of the Hungarian
kings, Matthias Corvinus.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.270
He actually drives the Habsburgs

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.770
from their own Austrian lands for a while

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.020
and does the sort of classic thing

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.730
of taking up residence in Vienna.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.990
So he lives in Vienna from 1484,

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.307
but he dies in 1490,

00:24:05.307 --> 00:24:08.010
and he's succeeded by Wladyslaw Jagiello,

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.963
who is, I hope, on your sheets,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.210
because he features four of
this fantastic Polish letter,

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.100
which Wladyslaw

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.870
Jagiello, who is, of course,

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.560
from that Lithuanian family
which is now ruling Poland.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.850
He becomes king of Hungary.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.187
Now, so interestingly, Corvinus says,

00:24:33.187 --> 00:24:36.120
"Thou, happy Austria, marry,"

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.670
but it's the happiest
marriages actually come

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.320
after Corvinus dies.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.960
There are two unbelievably
fortunate marriages now

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.110
for the Habsburgs which
consolidate their place

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.630
in Europe and in the world.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.407
The first has to do
with Wladyslaw Jagiello.

00:24:53.737 --> 00:24:55.000
Wladyslaw Jagiello

00:24:57.489 --> 00:24:58.322
enters into a marriage pact

00:24:58.322 --> 00:25:01.050
with the head of the Habsburg family,

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.913
who at that time is Maximilian I.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.880
Then, unhappily for him but
happily for the Habsburgs,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.800
he dies fighting the Ottomans in 1526

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.343
at the Battle of Mohacs in
a stream under his horse.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.170
That death triggers a marriage pact,

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:26.670
which means that the Habsburgs
then get to claim Hungary

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.520
as well as the Czech lands, which they do.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.350
They claim those lands.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.720
The Ottomans actually rule most of Hungary

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.953
for the next 150 years until 1699,

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.910
but the Habsburgs then claim those lands,

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.690
and they will eventually
effectively rule them.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.680
Then there's an even more
extraordinary marriage pact,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.990
which is that Maximilian I's son

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.380
marries a daughter of
Ferdinand and Isabella,

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.050
the Ferdinand and Isabella,
the ones who united Spain.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.150
That Ferdinand and Isabella.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.120
She's sixth in line to
the throne of Spain,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.973
so there's no way this is gonna happen.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.190
I'm sure many of you are married to people

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.410
who are sixth in line to some
throne or another, right?

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.880
That's just casual, right?

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.870
You probably didn't even mention that

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:16.703
in your Yale interviews.

00:26:16.703 --> 00:26:18.630
You're like, "Ah, no,
I'm gonna talk about,

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.930
I'm gonna talk about
intramural rugby instead.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.917
Don't wanna brag."

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:28.293
So note to video, they all laughed, right?

00:26:28.293 --> 00:26:29.126
(class chuckling)

00:26:29.126 --> 00:26:30.210
You can't tell when
they laugh at my jokes.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.830
They all laughed, including the ones

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.103
who are married to someone
who's sixth in line.

00:26:35.372 --> 00:26:37.500
So but what happens?

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.930
All of the men who are ahead of her die.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:40.763
They all die.

00:26:40.763 --> 00:26:42.323
All five of them die,
conveniently just in time

00:26:42.323 --> 00:26:46.020
for Maximilian's son to
become king of Spain,

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.750
thereby bringing the Spanish
Empire and, shortly thereafter,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.090
the Portuguese Empire and the Netherlands

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.920
and all the lands controlled
by the Netherlands

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.060
under the Habsburgs.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.110
So two unbelievably lucky marriages.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.290
Okay, so that's who the Habsburgs are

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.680
until we get to about the year 1700.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.300
The year 1700, 1699, 1700,
is when they're established

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.850
as a European power, but not an American,

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:12.990
not a world power anymore

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.990
'cause the Spanish
Habsburgs die out in 1700.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.720
1699, Treaty of Karlowitz,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.660
they control the Balkans
as well as the Czech lands,

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.160
as well as as Hungary.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.800
They take on a distinct European shape,

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.580
which they're more or
less gonna have until 1918

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.560
with some additions of lands from Poland,

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.090
which we're gonna talk about.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.300
After 1700 and the extinction
of the Spanish line,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.630
the male line of the Austrian Habsburgs

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.040
is also extinguished.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.500
In 1740, there are no more men.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.690
There's no male Habsburg
to take the throne.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:46.650
What do they do?

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.480
And again, this is another
one of these moments

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.080
where a particular person comes to power,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.430
and if it had been somebody else

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.040
with maybe a little bit less
intelligence and determination,

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.660
things would've gone differently.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.100
What the Habsburgs did was they came up

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.460
with the aptly named pragmatic sanction,

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.890
which meant that if there
are no male Habsburgs,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.900
how about a female Habsburg?

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.430
Very pragmatic, right?

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.650
Pragmatic, I mean, pragmatic
from their point of view

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.270
because what's always
happening to these families

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.400
is that the male line dies
out and then there's a war,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.890
and then somebody else's
male line takes over.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.970
Why not a woman?

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.110
So Maria Theresia takes over as empress

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.390
of the Habsburg lands in 1740.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.520
She's immediately challenged in a way

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.820
which we would now refer
to as highly gendered

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.720
by Frederick of Prussia, who says that,

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.340
he says, this is how it's gendered.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.890
He says, "Sure, you have the
right to rule, that's all fine,

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.360
but I think I need to decide for you

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.180
which territories you
get to rule." (chuckling)

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.090
So the Prussians make
war on the Habsburgs.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.680
Who were the Prussians?

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.930
If you can just remember
from a couple lectures ago,

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.300
Prussia on the Baltic Sea,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.670
successor state of Teutonic Knights,

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:57.540
little tiny thing which the
Poles allowed to survive,

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.280
but then when the Poles get into trouble,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.400
the Prussians become a
kingdom, they start to expand,

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.290
and their ruling family,
the Hohenzollerns,

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.940
are just gonna keep
expanding, keep expanding,

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.840
keep expanding, until in 1871
they're gonna unify Germany.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.870
So we're kind of in the middle
of that story with Frederick.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:17.610
So Frederick makes war on the
Habsburg monarchy in 1740.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.530
The Habsburg monarchy
defends itself very well.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.330
They lose one territory,

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.910
which Maria Theresia will
always want back and never get,

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.220
which is called Silesia.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.340
But meanwhile, and
there's a lot of meanwhile

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.500
for Maria Theresia when it
comes to bearing children.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.963
Meanwhile, she does bear a son in 1741,

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.710
beginning a new house, Habsburg-Lorraine,

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.840
which is gonna rule until 1918.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.340
As the English wits then put it,

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.283
the enemy has lost its chance
for Austria now wears pants.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.400
So when I tell you all the things

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.680
that Maria Theresia has done,
I want you to bear in mind

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.290
that in the next 19 years,

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.750
she's going to have 15
more children, right?

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.000
So 16 children in 19 years,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.530
plus the things we're talking about,

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.060
and, yes, she had childcare.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.620
Okay, so 1756 to 1763

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.450
is the next major conflict

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.760
between Prussia and the Habsburgs.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.980
On the world scale, this
is the Seven Years' War.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.300
This is the British
and the French fighting

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.710
in North America.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.840
This is the British gaining
dominance over India.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.570
The Seven Years' War,
like, it's a world war.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.150
It's a legitimately global conflict,

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.160
but for our purposes, it's one more time

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.410
when the Habsburgs fight
the Prussians to withdraw

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.380
under Maria Theresia
and continue to survive.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.340
Then politics turns in 1772

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.440
with the First Partition of Poland.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.560
Now the slightly unfair thing
about the partition of Poland,

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.870
as I'm sure all of you
Polonophile will have noticed,

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.690
is that it's not that long before,

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:46.680
it's 1683 when the Polish
armies have come to Vienna

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.230
and raised the Ottoman
siege and protected Vienna,

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.940
and then help the Austrians

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.440
to begin this series of victories,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.800
which will end in 1699 with Karlowitz.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.060
Less than 100 years later,
89 years later, 1772,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.310
the Habsburgs are going to take part,

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.870
along with the Prussians

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.900
and along with the Russian
Empire under Catherine,

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.910
they're gonna take part
in the First Partition,

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.580
the First Partition of Poland.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.130
And it is in this partition

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.410
that the Austrians take this territory

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.620
which they call Galicia,
which is a beautiful example

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.410
of imperial naming and renaming.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:23.610
If you are Ukrainian,

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.500
you'll know that there's
a town called Halych

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.450
and that there's a
region called Halychyna.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.540
And from Halych, Halychyna,

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.690
there's a Latin name, from
which you can make in German,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.450
Galytsiya for which we
call Galicia, right?

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:40.680
And so they name the territories
that they claim in 1772.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.722
They named them Galicia and Lodomeria.

00:31:43.722 --> 00:31:45.360
Lodomeria is even more wonderful.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:49.653
So there's a historical,
they're historical crown lands.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.590
As you know in this class, of Galicia,

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.363
we call them Galicia and Volhynia.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.410
Volhynia has a town in
it called Volodymyr.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:02.070
From that town Volodymyr, you
get the Latin name Lodomeria,

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.140
which, let's admit, it
sounds kind of cool.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.810
And so the Habsburgs claim

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:10.991
that they're ruling Galicia and Lodomeria.

00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:12.330
Galicia and Lodomeria.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.490
In fact, they don't
actually rule Lodomeria,

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.750
which is another part about imperial.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.750
Always err on the side of
claiming more than you actually...

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.430
The Habsburgs also were
kings of Jerusalem.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.330
You might not have known that,

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.040
but they were kings of Jerusalem, right?

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.930
There's always a long, no, I
mean, this is how you rule.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.850
There's always a long list of things,

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.920
and somewhere in that middle of the list,

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.770
like it kind of blurs from
things that you might control

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.190
to things that your uncle controlled,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.287
to things that you never
really controlled, right?

00:32:34.287 --> 00:32:36.392
But there's always a long
list of stuff that you ruled.

00:32:36.392 --> 00:32:40.080
Okay, so, okay, where are we?

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.080
So Maria Theresia, the partitions.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.880
So it's the First Partition of Poland

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.850
that brings Galicia into
the Habsburg monarchy, 1772.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.440
The last thing on her mind

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.600
were all the Ukrainian speakers there,

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.420
or, for that matter, all of
the Yiddish speakers there.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.450
This is not this class, but just FYI,

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.760
adding Galicia to the
Habsburg monarchy brings

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.330
in all the families who then
a couple of generations later

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:06.330
are going to create German
modernity in Vienna, right?

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.760
So for example, the Freud family, right?

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.180
All these families are
going to start in Galicia,

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.330
take a station stop in
Moravia, end up in Vienna,

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.040
and then they're going to create.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.140
They're gonna create Art Nouveau.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.030
They're gonna create German modernism,

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.270
zivilisation basically, circa 1900.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.300
So this partition also
had that meaning, right?

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.550
If the Austrians don't
take this territory,

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.110
and, let's say, the Russians do,

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.070
then there are not gonna be,

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.050
there are not gonna be
German-speaking Jews in Vienna

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.570
around the year 1900
to make Vienna the city

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.760
that you're all gonna visit
this summer, basically.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.593
Right? Okay.

00:33:42.344 --> 00:33:45.244
So there are three partitions
of Poland: 1772, 1793, 1795,

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.093
and by the time the dust settles,

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.050
Russia has taken most of it.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.793
Very roughly speaking,

00:33:55.471 --> 00:33:59.160
the Left Bank, that is the western part,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.220
is added to what Russia already
gained a century before,

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.290
which is the Right Bank
or the eastern part.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.170
Almost all of Ukraine is now
under the Russian Empire.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.870
The exception, the very,
very important exception,

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:14.010
is Galicia, which is
now under the Habsburgs

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.270
in this new zone.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:19.350
And this Galicia in the
Third Partition is extended

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.740
to include what is now
basically south-central Poland.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.153
So Krakow.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.820
Krakow, after a little while,

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.490
is going to be inside this Galicia.

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:32.610
So this Galicia has Polish
speakers, Yiddish speakers,

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.250
Ukrainian speakers, and it's
now a district in Austria.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.500
So the very last thing
we have to do is talk

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.853
about what is special in
Austria in the 19th century.

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:44.850
Skim over the first part.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:48.450
The first part is the post-Napoleonic part

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:50.940
when all the European
dynasties are embarrassed,

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.160
and then they tend to
crack down afterwards,

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.660
the Age of Metternich,

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.120
the age when Austria
invents the police state,

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:02.120
the age of systematic censorship,
the 1820s and the 1830s.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.480
This comes to an end with
the Revolution of 1848,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.750
which is a broad European conflagration

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.003
from Belgium through
France, through Austria.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.060
It's the time when Karl Marx wrote

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.830
this little thing called
"The Communist Manifesto."

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.170
That was also 1848.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.170
At the end of 1848 in Austria,

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:23.820
the most interesting
thing that has happened

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.200
is that a teenager, he's
18 at the time, I believe,

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.350
Franz Joseph comes to power,
and Franz Joseph is going

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.443
to be the ruler of
Austria from 1848 to 1916.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.350
He's going to be setting
the political tone

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.060
during all that time.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.010
From our point of view, an
interesting thing that happens

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.110
in the Revolutions of 1848
has to do with the Poles

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:50.130
and the Ukrainians, and it
reveals an Austrian tactic,

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.970
which is very important
to nation building.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.820
So it's not the most heroic
part of nation building,

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.860
but it's a very important
part of nation building.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.440
In 1848, the Austrians have some reason

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.510
to be concerned about the Poles.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.370
Less the Ukrainians, more the Poles.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.800
The Poles have had their
own state until 1795.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.110
The Poles have a nobility.
They have some wealth.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.720
Some of the Poles have gotten
into the Austrian bureaucracy.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.453
And so what do they do in 1848 in Galicia?

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.260
They encourage the Ukrainians, right?

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.417
They encourage the Ukrainians.

00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:23.040
They encourage the establishment

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.020
of something called
Ukrainian National Council,

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.090
which then makes Ukrainian
political demands.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.130
So rather than directly suppressing

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.427
or intimidating the Poles, they say,

00:36:30.427 --> 00:36:32.760
"Oh, look what we can do over here.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.860
Oh, there's some Ukrainians
who also live there.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.540
I bet they would like some things."

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.370
And so the Ukrainians
issue political demands

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.560
like dividing Austria in
half, which is gonna be,

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.270
I mean, not Austria, Galicia in half

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.890
into a western, eastern part,

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.750
which will be a Ukrainian
idea all the way through,

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.370
all the way through 1918.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:51.060
And so this is, I mean,
this is going to be,

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.850
this kind of idea of compromise

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.470
is gonna be crucial
all the way to the end,

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:58.290
and I just wanna set it
up for you structurally.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.870
The Ukrainians were not exactly

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.643
a national minority in Austria.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.810
A national minority would be
more like in interwar Poland,

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.280
which we're gonna talk about soon enough,

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.530
where it really is a nation state

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.480
for the Poles and the Ukrainians.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.170
Five million, six million
Ukrainian speakers are a minority.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.810
But in the Habsburg
monarchy, it's more like

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.720
the Ukrainians are one
group of people in Galicia

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.680
and where they're contesting
things with the Poles.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.970
And when they contest things,

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.790
they have somewhere to go besides violence

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.970
or besides direct
confrontation, which is Vienna.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.500
They can go to Vienna.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.180
The Habsburgs are at the top,

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.920
and the Habsburgs are
always gonna be capable

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.230
down to the end of saying,
"Okay, as a matter of fact,

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.490
let's make another compromise.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:43.110
Let's redo this. Let's redo that.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.970
Let's redo this. Let's redo that,"

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:48.540
which isn't the most exciting
form of politics, I admit,

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.550
again, cross reference to European Union,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.880
but it might be a form of
politics, of national politics,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.560
which is more durable than people thought

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.540
in the 19th century or the 20th century.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.430
So this form of politics

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:03.180
comes alive after 1867.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.577
So the other part of the
famous saying of Corvinus,

00:38:06.577 --> 00:38:07.710
"Let others fight wars.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.210
Thou, happy Austria, marry,"

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.790
the slightly unkind part would
be the suggestion that maybe

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.950
that the Austrians are
going to lose a lot of wars,

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.483
which is also true, right?

00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:20.070
They didn't exactly cover
themselves with glory

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.520
in the wars of the 19th
and the early 20th century.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.890
They got embarrassed in 1859,

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.830
and which began the process
of Italian unification.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.500
They really got embarrassed
in 1866 with the Germans,

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.770
which is the beginning of the
story of German unification.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.453
After they lost a war to Germany,

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.830
the Habsburgs had to make a compromise

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.270
from position of weakness

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.880
with the most important
nationality within their borders,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.350
which is the Hungarians.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.320
And this is the famous Ausgleich of 1867.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.470
That's one of these words,
like later on Anschluss.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.090
They're five German
words you have to know,

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.793
and two of them are
Ausgleich and Anschluss.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.630
I don't have time for the
jokes about the other three.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.710
We're running out of time.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.540
Hopefully it's some other
lecture, but, anyway,

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.810
ausgleich just means compromise,
just means compromise,

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.900
but in this context, it
means the Compromise of 1867

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.140
in which the Hungarian nobility

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.330
was basically given the
right to become a state

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.070
within a state of the Habsburg monarchy

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.620
and to do as they please with the Slovaks,

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.350
the Slovaks, the Croats, the Romanians.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.630
The remainder of Austria,

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:29.100
which is in a funny kind of
sea shape around Hungary,

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.390
from Galicia through Moravia,
Bohemia, Austria itself,

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.880
down the Adriatic Coast,
what's now Slovenia,

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:40.590
what's now Croatia, that
Austria was governed after 1867

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.230
by a kind of constitutional law

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.903
which promised things
like freedom of speech,

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:50.130
which promised equal
rights for individuals

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.360
and equal rights for nations.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.680
Never quite defined what a nation was,

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.250
but equal rights for individuals,
equal rights for nations.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.860
It's in this particular
version of Austria,

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.500
not the Hungarian part,
the non-Hungarian part,

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.790
that the story of Ukrainian
nationality plays out.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:08.520
And by now you will have
noticed the timing, right?

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.670
The timing, the timing, the timing.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.460
After 1867, many things are possible.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.300
After 1867, freedom of
speech, individual freedom.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.970
After 1867, Austria is gonna move

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:25.260
until by 1907, there's gonna
be full manhood suffrage,

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.654
which is pretty advanced for
the standards of the time.

00:40:28.654 --> 00:40:30.653
The United States didn't
have it, for example.

00:40:31.666 --> 00:40:34.980
And that means that along
with full manhood suffrage,

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.700
the right of all males to
vote, comes political parties,

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.920
and with political parties
come political campaigns

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.350
and political demands, and
with political campaigns

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.990
and political demands
come newspapers, right?

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:47.220
Because there's freedom of speech.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.220
And that includes, among
many, many other things,

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.250
Ukrainian newspapers,
Ukrainian political parties,

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.540
Ukrainian political demands,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.800
which even if they're not fulfilled,

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.600
they're out there and they're aired.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:02.490
And again, the timing,
this is from 1867 to 1914.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:06.690
The timing is the same
moment when Ukrainian culture

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.570
and any kind of politics
becomes impossible

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.890
in the Russian Empire.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.500
That's so important to everything

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.660
because after 1867,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.920
the leading thinkers and
activists from the Russian Empire,

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.540
when they are banned after
1863 and again in 1876,

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.600
when they're banned by the Valuev Circular

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.720
and the Ems Decree from
using Ukrainian language,

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.683
where do they go?

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.780
They go to Galicia.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.250
They go to the Habsburg monarchy, right?

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.190
And the timing is that the
timing is so important here.

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.540
Absolutely crucial.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.460
The Habsburg monarchy is becoming a place

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.170
where you can do Ukrainian politics

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.480
at exactly the moment the Russian
Empire is becoming a place

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.860
where you can't do Ukrainian politics

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.020
or, for that matter, Ukrainian culture.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:53.250
And because the center of
Ukrainian intellectual, political,

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.160
and cultural life was
actually the Russian Empire,

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.190
this means that all these
people are coming into Galicia

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:02.340
who can do things like occupied share

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.140
in East European history, right?

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.540
There's a fellow called
Mykhailo Hrushevs'kyi,

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.090
the most important historian of Ukraine,

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:10.830
who basically applies the methods

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:12.150
of what we would call social history

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.650
and writes a continuous history

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.273
of Ukraine from the Middle Ages.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.250
Hrushevs'kyi leaves the Russian
Empire, comes to Galicia,

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.880
and, lo and behold, he
has a chair in Lviv.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.713
He has a chair,

00:42:24.713 --> 00:42:28.653
and he's able to teach
this version of history,

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.400
which that's actually
incredibly significant, right?

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.560
The difference between nobody and one,

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.050
and nobody having to
share in Ukrainian history

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:38.880
and the most important
Ukrainian chair having to share

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.620
in Ukrainian history and lecturing

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.140
and publishing his books,
very, very important.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.850
But that's just pars pro toto.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:49.290
That's just one example
of many other things.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.553
Very important thinkers,

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.990
like Panteleimon Kulish, like Drahomanov,

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:58.170
they all come from the East
and they go to the West,

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:01.170
and they bring radical political ideas.

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.660
They bring the idea, for
example, a fundamental idea,

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.700
which I'll just mention
and then we'll move on,

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.850
that politics belongs
to the people as such.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.293
So in the Russian Empire,

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:14.730
the serfs were freed in 1861,

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.490
which raises the basic question of, okay,

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:21.753
if they're free of
bondage, who now owns them?

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.390
Whom do they belong?

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.220
Are they gonna be loyal to the czar?

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.050
Are they gonna be loyal to something else?

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.417
And the main radical political reaction,

00:43:30.417 --> 00:43:31.980
the end of serfdom, was something called,

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.020
in the Russian Empire was called populism

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.403
or going to the people.

00:43:36.303 --> 00:43:40.170
The Ukrainian populists were
the ones who went to the people

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:42.663
and found out they were
Ukrainian, essentially,

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:48.000
which coincides in time with the emergence

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.510
of a new discipline of science
which we call anthropology,

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.520
but at the time was called ethnography,

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.370
which we think of as the
method of anthropology.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.340
At the time, they said
ethnography for the science.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.740
Going to the people,
recording their songs,

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.810
recording their stories,
recording their history,

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.540
recording everything you can,
taking the people seriously

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.090
as an object of science coincides

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:11.850
with taking the people seriously
as an object of politics.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:16.350
And it leads to the notion
that in addition to history

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:19.050
and politics and power
mattering for a nation,

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:22.290
also the people and its culture
and its durability matter.

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:24.030
So if there are songs,
if there's a culture,

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:27.060
if there's a language, then
that means there's a nation.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.880
This is the ethnographic idea of a nation,

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.230
a very powerful idea, and that
ethnographic idea of a nation

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.700
is obviously very useful in Galicia,

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.480
not against the Russians,
Russians don't matter in Galicia,

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.450
but against the Poles because in Galicia,

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.390
I mean, this is so important,
it's not that the Ukrainians

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:50.757
are a national minority
struggling against the center.

00:44:50.757 --> 00:44:52.020
No, no, no, no.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.540
The Ukrainians are
struggling against the Poles

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.160
and the Polish gentry.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.780
After 1867, the Poles
as a historical nation,

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.630
as people said back
then, as a gentry nation,

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:06.690
they are also the
beneficiaries of a compromise.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:10.200
They get control over
schools, very important.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.060
They get a local parliament.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.240
They get some control
over local administration.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.860
And what does that give
for the Ukrainians?

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.070
It gives the Ukrainians
something to struggle for, right?

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.020
And in some of that,
they're gonna claw back

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.380
and get control of, especially
at the level of schooling.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.130
They're gonna claw back and
try to get control of that.

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:30.900
In the free politics, it was possible,

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.980
the Habsburg monarchy.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.270
But what are the intellectual

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.520
or ideological weapons they're gonna use?

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.370
The Polish argument is that we're a nation

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.960
because we always were.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.940
It's not that the Polish
speaking peasants are the nation.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.350
They didn't think that, right?

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.270
The nation are the gentry.

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.160
The nation are the people
who used to be able to vote

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.480
in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.820
the gentry, the historical nobility.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:54.453
That's the nation, the historical
nation, as people said.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:58.200
But the Ukrainians now
have a different kind

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.130
of argument to make.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.540
Their argument can be, well,

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.090
maybe we don't have the gentry.

00:46:03.533 --> 00:46:05.880
Maybe we weren't the political
class a hundred years ago

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.440
in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.450
but at least in certain
parts of the territories,

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:12.240
we have the people, we have the majority,

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.970
we have the culture,
and that is the nation.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.757
And that's a very
powerful argument, right?

00:46:16.757 --> 00:46:18.060
That's a very powerful...

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.520
That version of the nation, by the way,

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.780
is broadly victorious.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.420
I mean, people can disagree
about this and that,

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.017
but you wouldn't generally say like,

00:46:26.017 --> 00:46:28.237
there are very few countries
now where you can say,

00:46:28.237 --> 00:46:30.990
"I belong to the nation
because I belong to nobility."

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.520
In general, if I say nation now,

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.720
you're not gonna think of some elite.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.980
You're gonna tend to think of everybody

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.930
or at least some large group, right?

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.510
So Ukrainians, with the help of the,

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:40.400
Ukrainians and Galicia with the help

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.180
of the Ukrainians coming
for the Russian Empire

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.380
can make this argument.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.150
They can say, "We're the majority."

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.370
And this argument also has,

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:48.750
it also has political ramifications.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.820
It means if you mobilize
enough people to vote,

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.550
you can send your representatives
to parliament, as they do.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.290
You can have debates in parliament

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.123
You can make your camp.

00:46:56.123 --> 00:46:58.380
They never win this argument,
but they make it to the end,

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.480
but we should divide
Galicia into East and West,

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.877
and have our own Eastern Galicia.

00:47:02.877 --> 00:47:05.310
And so with the help of these
people, with the help of,

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.390
with the help of these arguments,

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.830
but above all with the help

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.620
of the very specific
Habsburg political system,

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:14.460
the period between 1867
and 1914 becomes the period

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.370
when Ukrainian politics explodes.

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.740
Ukrainian politics becomes mass politics.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.390
There are suddenly Ukrainian nationalists

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.430
and Ukrainian socialists
and Ukrainian liberals,

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.110
and Ukrainian every possible thing,

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.290
and Ukrainian newspapers,
Ukrainian civil life.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.150
Civic life, in other words.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.820
That in turn is going to
be incredibly important

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.200
when we get to the moment

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.730
when the empires begin to break up,

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:37.110
which is the First World War,

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:39.000
which is where we're gonna
start again next time.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.150
So thank you very much.

00:47:46.929 --> 00:47:50.429
(bright tones resonating)

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.974
Professor Donald
Kagan: For the next couple

00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:10.587
of weeks we will be examining
the coming and the fighting of

00:00:10.587 --> 00:00:15.111
the Great Peloponnesian War.
It's a subject that had

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:20.121
tremendous importance for the
Greeks themselves and it has

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:25.394
been one of the things that has
occupied people interested in

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:29.350
the ancient Greeks more than
most thing,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.262
partly because of its own
extraordinary importance,

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:37.956
but I think perhaps even more
because of the fact that it was

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:40.930
described for us by a
participant,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.281
a contemporary Thucydides,
the son of Olorus an Athenian,

00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:50.963
who by common consent
throughout the millennia has

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:56.410
been agreed upon as one of the
great historians ever,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.011
sort of the second one that we
know of in all of history,

00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.969
but also one who is much
esteemed.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.486
I would argue that right now
he's probably esteemed more than

00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:10.709
he has ever been throughout the
history of the world,

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.016
because he's had such a great
influence on thinking in the

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:17.670
West and then in the world as
well--around the world as well.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.590
Ever since the twentieth
century, he really came into his

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.250
own as events like the First and
the Second World War,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.941
to be followed then by the Cold
War seemed to observers of the

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:34.710
time, to be much illuminated by
studying Thucydides' account of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.632
the Peloponnesian War.
And as a consequence his own

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:41.583
way of thinking about history
and about war,

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:45.290
and about international
relations and about behavior of

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.183
human beings in the mass,
and a whole variety of subjects

00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:54.569
in the realm of politics and
diplomacy and war.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.199
So it's for those reasons,
I think, that this story has

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:04.430
been so carefully looked at,
compared to others in history.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.020
You know that for almost
three decades at the end of the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.989
fifth century the Athenian
Empire fought against the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.113
Spartan alliance in this
terrible war that changed the

00:02:17.113 --> 00:02:21.860
Greek world and the civilization
of the Greeks forever.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.358
From the perspective of the
fifth century Greeks,

00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:29.659
the Peloponnesian War deserves
to be thought of I think as a

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.105
world war.
It just involves the Greeks

00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:36.610
themselves and that's not quite
right.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.889
That's one of the points
Thucydides makes.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.406
It drew into it other peoples
other than the Greeks who were

00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:45.502
very important.
The Persians were to play a

00:02:45.502 --> 00:02:49.897
critical role and similarly the
Macedonians, and similarly

00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:54.231
peoples in Sicily and in Italy.
So, it really doesn't require

00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:57.654
much defense from the Greek
point of view to think of it as

00:02:57.654 --> 00:03:01.571
a kind of a world war.
A critical turning point in

00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:05.745
Greek history causing enormous
destruction of life and

00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:09.302
property,
intensifying factional and

00:03:09.302 --> 00:03:13.423
class hostility,
dividing the Greek states

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:19.654
internally--it was the cause of
civil wars throughout the Greek

00:03:19.654 --> 00:03:23.253
world,
throughout its history and

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:27.473
subsequently,
de-stabilizing the relationship

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:32.556
of classes within cities and
between the relationships

00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:38.109
between cities ultimately.
As we can see from hindsight,

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.824
making the capacity of the
Greeks to resist an outside

00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:48.073
threat much weaker and helping
to bring about a situation in

00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:52.966
which they finally did lose
their independence and their

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:56.573
autonomy.
So, from so many points of

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:59.630
view the war may be seen as a
tragic event,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.687
the end of a period of
confidence and hope,

00:04:02.687 --> 00:04:05.379
and I would want to stress
that.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.095
If you look at the fifty year
stretch between the Persian War

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:12.945
and the Peloponnesian War,
it is the great age of Greece

00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:17.321
when so many of the things that
we value in the experience of

00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:20.750
the Greeks were created and
carried forward,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.477
and a period in which one sees
evidence of all sorts of

00:04:25.477 --> 00:04:30.816
confidence in human capacities
and the hope of what will be in

00:04:30.816 --> 00:04:33.202
the future.
All of that,

00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:37.760
I think, suffered a
considerable reversal because of

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.230
the Peloponnesian War,
and began a darker time.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.373
It was a war of
unprecedented brutality in Greek

00:04:47.373 --> 00:04:53.727
life, violating even the already
rugged code that had previously

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:59.072
governed Greek fighting and
breaking through that thin

00:04:59.072 --> 00:05:04.620
veneer that separates
civilization from savagery.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.945
It is actually to Thucydides
that that way of thinking about

00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:12.709
things is old.
Certainly for me;

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:16.370
that's when I first understood
what he's teaching us to such a

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.806
degree in his history,
that there is just a very thin

00:05:20.806 --> 00:05:25.699
veneer that covers over the
brutal, the bestial,

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.080
the worst and bestial that
exists in human beings even in

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.225
society, but that society is
what covers that over and

00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:39.310
permits something resembling
what we would call civilization.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.078
But warfare tends to put a
strain on that limiting element

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:50.516
which is what society gives you.
Anger, frustration,

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:55.289
the desire for vengeance
increases as the fighting drags

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.367
on,
producing a progression of

00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:04.759
atrocities that included maiming
and killing captured opponents,

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.352
throwing them into pits to die
of thirst, starvation and

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:14.446
exposure, that's what happened
in Sicily and hurling them into

00:06:14.446 --> 00:06:17.819
the sea to drown,
which became the practice

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.540
towards the end of the
Peloponnesian War.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.676
It was a case of a band of
marauders, murdering innocent

00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:30.160
school children,
entire cities were destroyed,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.620
the men killed the women and
children sold into slavery.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.619
I don't say there were no
atrocities before the

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:40.096
Peloponnesian War,
but nothing like the

00:06:40.096 --> 00:06:42.769
concentration of them that
developed,

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:47.462
and also I suspect a whole new
range of them also came into

00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:50.172
being.
One reason being that in

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:54.592
the past wars had been short,
and one of the messages I think

00:06:54.592 --> 00:06:59.379
Thucydides wants to give us is
that the longer a war persists,

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.734
the more inevitable is the
sinking below civilized levels

00:07:03.734 --> 00:07:08.166
of warfare, if there is such a
thing as civilized level of

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:12.699
warfare,
to a much more horrible way of

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:16.773
fighting.
As I said, although the war

00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:23.052
ended over 2,400 years ago it
continues to fascinate readers

00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:27.529
today.
I was astonished;

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:31.214
I wrote a one-volume history of
the Peloponnesian War and it

00:07:31.214 --> 00:07:33.650
sold 50,000 copies of the damn
thing.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:41.459
I'm truly amazed;
so was my publisher.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:47.696
But I think shouldn't have been
amazed, because for maybe a

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:54.470
century now people have been
studying Thucydides and the war,

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.128
or when they have not been
studying them they've been

00:07:57.128 --> 00:08:00.765
hearing about it;
references that have been made

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:05.542
to it by distinguished people.
General Marshall referred

00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:09.797
to it in a famous quotation when
he was Secretary of State and

00:08:09.797 --> 00:08:13.850
people keep talking about it,
and so the curiosity I think

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.644
rather than the
familiarity--curiosity about

00:08:16.644 --> 00:08:19.699
what is this all about may
account for this,

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:24.242
but it's also true that if you
go to--Thucydides and the

00:08:24.242 --> 00:08:29.279
Peloponnesian War are taught in
all the military academies.

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:32.114
They are taught in all,
or just about all,

00:08:32.114 --> 00:08:35.432
I never heard one that didn't,
in all programs of

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.990
international relations
anywhere.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.782
That's one of the first books
along with the Chinese Sage of

00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:47.249
Warfare, Sun-tzu both of those
seem to be typically read

00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:51.158
everywhere and so on.
I don't think that this is just

00:08:51.158 --> 00:08:54.429
an affectation of look at us we
read classical stuff;

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:56.539
I don't think that's what it's
about.

00:08:56.539 --> 00:09:00.459
I think it is based on a
conviction and supported by

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:03.610
arguments by scholars,
not classicists,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.414
that there is some continuing
meaning, some continuing value,

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:13.218
something we can learn about
all of these important topics by

00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:16.550
reading Thucydides.
So, I want to just comfort

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.629
you for the burden I've laid on
you in giving you that book and

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:22.820
all of this stuff to read.
You're not wasting your time;

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.129
that's what I'm trying to tell
you.

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:29.636
I'd like to turn first to the
question of the origins of the

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:32.849
war, the causes of the war,
the outbreak of the war,

00:09:32.849 --> 00:09:35.517
however you want to look at
that phenomenon,

00:09:35.517 --> 00:09:38.992
because Thucydides is very
interested in that subject and

00:09:38.992 --> 00:09:41.909
writes about it with a
sophistication that in my

00:09:41.909 --> 00:09:46.209
opinion,
has not been superseded and

00:09:46.209 --> 00:09:51.950
rarely matched in the years
since that point.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:57.349
Thucydides' whole first
book really is about that

00:09:57.349 --> 00:10:02.230
subject, how and why did that
war come about?

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.832
That's a subject I just think
is immensely interesting and

00:10:06.832 --> 00:10:11.516
important, because we should
face the fact that the history

00:10:11.516 --> 00:10:16.200
of civilized mankind is almost
the history of warfare.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.929
There's nothing more typical of
human societies than that they

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:24.029
are organized to fight wars and
do so.

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:27.501
And I think by the twentieth-,
twenty-first century we ought

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.620
to have come to the conclusion
this is a bad thing.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.325
Wars, certainly now,
whatever positive functions

00:10:35.325 --> 00:10:40.324
they might have had in the past,
and they have been sometimes

00:10:40.324 --> 00:10:43.682
glorified for various reasons,
the price of them is just far

00:10:43.682 --> 00:10:45.960
too high for us to think that's
fine,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.504
let's keep doing that.
So, the problem why do wars

00:10:49.504 --> 00:10:54.157
happen and how can they be
avoided strikes me as important

00:10:54.157 --> 00:11:00.163
a question as there is,
and Thucydides I think gives us

00:11:00.163 --> 00:11:05.799
some food to chew on as we think
about that.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:10.516
Well, he examined the
situation in the first book and

00:11:10.516 --> 00:11:14.306
concluded with what he calls the
truest cause,

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:18.453
the truest explanation.
I'll quote him now,

00:11:18.453 --> 00:11:23.777
"The truest explanation,
although it has been the least

00:11:23.777 --> 00:11:30.086
often advanced I believe to have
been the growth of the Athenians

00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:36.298
to greatness which brought fear
to the Lacedaemonians and forced

00:11:36.298 --> 00:11:40.325
them to war."
Scholars differ a bit on what

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:43.586
that really means,
but I side with what I think

00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:47.129
are the majority of the scholars
on this point,

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:53.396
which is to say he is really
saying that this war became

00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:59.889
inevitable at a certain point
when the Athenian Empire,

00:11:59.889 --> 00:12:05.225
that's the greatness of Athens
reached such a point as to alarm

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.840
the Spartans enough to do what
they did,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.897
which was to start a war to
check the growth of that

00:12:12.897 --> 00:12:16.401
Athenian power.
Everything I've said is open to

00:12:16.401 --> 00:12:20.218
criticism and disagreement,
and just naturally great big

00:12:20.218 --> 00:12:25.771
arguments about these things,
but I'm giving you my view

00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:32.904
which is not original or unique.
Now, I think it's important

00:12:32.904 --> 00:12:38.152
to realize that Thucydides does
not think that sort of an

00:12:38.152 --> 00:12:43.962
obvious explanation can be found
by examining the circumstances

00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:49.210
that took place when the war
broke out in 431 B.C.,

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.631
and the proof of that is not
merely that he speaks about the

00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:56.393
truest explanation,
which means he's rejecting less

00:12:56.393 --> 00:13:00.659
true ones, which do focus on the
events themselves,

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:04.009
what we might call the
precipitating causes of the war.

00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:08.002
He begins his account
explaining how the war came back

00:13:08.002 --> 00:13:11.995
to the end of the Persian Wars
and the events that are

00:13:11.995 --> 00:13:14.744
important,
from his point of view,

00:13:14.744 --> 00:13:18.870
are the forming of the Delian
League which emerges as the

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.382
Athenian Empire.
That's one critical thing he

00:13:22.382 --> 00:13:25.701
goes back to,
and the other critical thing he

00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:29.926
goes back to is the distrust
that emerged swiftly between

00:13:29.926 --> 00:13:34.302
Athens and Sparta which turned
into a major division in the

00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:38.527
Greek world and produced
ultimately-- suspicion obviously

00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:43.279
is something that makes it
easier to bring about fear,

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:47.395
and so we get to that second
element that Thucydides talks

00:13:47.395 --> 00:13:51.872
about, the fear that the growth
of Athenian power and gender in

00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:55.309
the Spartans.
What is so splendid in my

00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:58.889
eyes about Thucydides
understanding of why these

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:03.232
things happened and why it's
superior to what is typically

00:14:03.232 --> 00:14:07.346
taught in the graduate schools
that study international

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:11.460
relations is he's talking about
human emotions.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.296
He's talking about feelings;
he's not talking about

00:14:15.296 --> 00:14:18.708
structures that you need to be a
professor in order to

00:14:18.708 --> 00:14:21.556
understand.
I think that that's one of the

00:14:21.556 --> 00:14:23.816
powerful things.
Thucydides is interested in

00:14:23.816 --> 00:14:25.700
structures, the first one he
ever looks at.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.267
He thinks it's a very important
thing, but when he comes down to

00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:31.250
explaining why nations go to
war,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:37.210
he looks at the feelings that
the people involved have.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.435
Well, we've talked already
about some of the events that he

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:44.230
describes, taking them mainly
from him.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.288
I'm talking about the beginning
of the Delian League,

00:14:47.288 --> 00:14:49.700
the conversion into an Athenian
Empire,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.342
the suspicion that aroused
among the Spartans,

00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:57.956
but the fact that they worked
things out until the Thasian

00:14:57.956 --> 00:15:01.477
rebellion,
where we see the Athenians

00:15:01.477 --> 00:15:06.713
acting more aggressively with
less justification than they

00:15:06.713 --> 00:15:10.461
ever have before.
But what I didn't tell you

00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:15.019
because I wanted to save it for
this context is that Thucydides

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:18.989
mentions the fact that when the
Thasians launched their

00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:24.284
rebellion against Athens in 465,
they went first to the Spartans

00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:27.440
and asked them,
if we rebel against the

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.429
Athenians will you invade
Attica,

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:33.300
and the ephors,
the officials that conduct

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.230
foreign policy in the first
instance in Sparta,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.863
said they would.
Well, they didn't because

00:15:41.863 --> 00:15:45.670
before they could do so the
great earthquake occurred which

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.230
prevented them doing any such
thing.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.849
It needs to be pointed out that
this message--these talks that

00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:57.090
went on between the Thasians and
Spartans were secret,

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:01.116
and we have to believe that at
this time, the Athenians did not

00:16:01.116 --> 00:16:04.679
know about these conversations,
because if they had,

00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:09.009
there is no way they could have
been persuaded to send help,

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:12.470
4,000 hoplites into the
Peloponnesus to help the

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:18.131
Spartans against the helots.
So, I think we need to accept

00:16:18.131 --> 00:16:23.130
Thucydides' assessment of that
situation.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.897
Well, we know it happened.
The Athenians were sent away

00:16:26.897 --> 00:16:30.198
because of the suspicion that
the Spartans felt for them and

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:33.976
their way of government,
and this produced a tremendous

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:37.979
anger in the Athenians and it
also led to a revolution

00:16:37.979 --> 00:16:42.663
internally in which the Cimonian
regime was replaced by one led

00:16:42.663 --> 00:16:47.120
by more radical democrats like
Ephialtes and Pericles,

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.392
and also a diplomatic
revolution in which the

00:16:50.392 --> 00:16:54.334
Athenians withdrew from the
Greek League under Spartan

00:16:54.334 --> 00:16:56.915
leadership,
and in which they made

00:16:56.915 --> 00:17:00.913
alliances first with Argos the
great enemy of Sparta and then

00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:04.778
with the Thessalians whom they
hoped would supply them with

00:17:04.778 --> 00:17:07.710
useful cavalry in case of a
future war.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.676
So, that's a terrific
takeoff point for the first

00:17:11.676 --> 00:17:15.948
quarrel of seriousness between
the two sides which modern

00:17:15.948 --> 00:17:19.609
historians call the First
Peloponnesian War.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.966
One other thing that happened
at the conclusion of this

00:17:22.966 --> 00:17:25.080
previous period,
that is to say,

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:34.370
with the withdrawal of the
Athenians from the scene,

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.440
the Spartans finally took care
of the helots.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.656
They never were able really to
defeat them and get them down

00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:44.299
from their fort up on Mount
Ithome,

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:49.490
but they finally made a deal
with the people up there saying,

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:54.766
we will allow you to come down
in safety and go away someplace

00:17:54.766 --> 00:17:58.400
so long as you leave the
Peloponnesus.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.627
They undoubtedly expected that
the helots would then be

00:18:01.627 --> 00:18:04.376
scattered one here,
one there, one other place,

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:07.852
where else would they go?
That's what would have

00:18:07.852 --> 00:18:10.800
happened, had it not been that
the Athenians,

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.133
who had lately acquired,
we know not how,

00:18:14.133 --> 00:18:19.655
control of a town on the north
shore of the Corinthian Gulf

00:18:19.655 --> 00:18:24.002
called Naupactus.
It has a very good harbor and

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:28.551
it is so located as to be
wonderful as a naval base for

00:18:28.551 --> 00:18:33.100
somebody who wished to be able
to control access to the

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.503
Corinthian Gulf.
The Athenians took it and then

00:18:37.503 --> 00:18:42.769
turned it over to the helots who
had fled the Peloponnesus.

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:46.614
That was not what the Spartans
had in mind, although there was

00:18:46.614 --> 00:18:50.269
nothing in the deal that
prevented this from being done.

00:18:50.269 --> 00:18:53.386
But it means that the Athenians
had done another bit of harm to

00:18:53.386 --> 00:18:56.351
the Spartans,
putting their bitter enemies in

00:18:56.351 --> 00:19:00.703
a position to cause trouble to
them and to their allies on the

00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:04.485
Corinthians Gulf.
So, all of that suggests

00:19:04.485 --> 00:19:07.260
that on the next day,
so to speak,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.130
after all of these changes had
taken place,

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.613
the world was very different
and the prospects,

00:19:14.613 --> 00:19:18.323
I would have thought,
for peace between Sparta and

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:23.170
her allies and Athens and her
allies had been badly reduced.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:27.000
There's no longer an
association between the two.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.650
The Athenians had allied
themselves with Spartan enemies;

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.730
the Athenians had taken the
halots and put them in this

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.256
terrific place.
This is not a recipe for good

00:19:37.256 --> 00:19:42.280
relations in the future--this is
where the cliché

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.549
seems to me to be useful;
people talk about a powder keg

00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:51.819
which only needs a spark to set
it off into a great explosion.

00:19:51.819 --> 00:19:54.190
People use this about the
outbreak of many wars.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.950
Sometimes it is an apt thing,
and sometimes it is not.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.200
This time it is,
as we shall see;

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.793
it didn't take very much to
produce an explosion between

00:20:05.793 --> 00:20:09.049
Athens and Sparta after these
events.

00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:14.979
The spark was provided by a
quarrel that took place between

00:20:14.979 --> 00:20:18.900
two Spartan allies in the
Peloponnesus,

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.670
Megara and Corinth,
neighbors on that isthmus that

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:29.970
leads into northern Greece and
into Athens.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.807
Since they are both members of
the Spartan alliance,

00:20:37.807 --> 00:20:42.980
the Spartans had choices to
make about what has happening.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.214
And the choice was soon forced
upon them, because when it was

00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:49.180
clear that the Corinthians were
winning the argument,

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.821
winning the war I should say,
that they were fighting against

00:20:53.821 --> 00:20:58.463
Megara, the Megarians came to
Sparta and asked for their help

00:20:58.463 --> 00:21:01.789
in putting down this war and
ending it.

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:05.260
The Spartans said,
"no we are not interested;

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.730
it is your business, not ours."
Now, that is interesting.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.555
We cannot really tell,
because there is nothing

00:21:13.555 --> 00:21:17.381
written about it,
what obligations the Spartans

00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:21.539
had when two allies who are
autonomous states,

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:24.569
according to the theory,
decide to fight each other.

00:21:24.569 --> 00:21:27.333
It looks to me,
because nobody complained about

00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:29.819
it in terms of constitutional
irregularity,

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:32.909
that the Spartans had every
right to ignore what was going

00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:34.214
on.
We must assume,

00:21:34.214 --> 00:21:37.526
I suppose, that in the
centuries or century or so

00:21:37.526 --> 00:21:41.666
before, the Spartans must have
ignored other quarrels between

00:21:41.666 --> 00:21:46.082
allies and allowed them to fight
it out or settle it any way they

00:21:46.082 --> 00:21:49.440
want.
The Spartans don't give a damn,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.460
who wins between Corinth and
Megara.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.119
And why should they get
involved.

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:57.815
I think that hands-off attitude
must have been encouraged by the

00:21:57.815 --> 00:22:01.768
fact that they had just,
probably were still recovering

00:22:01.768 --> 00:22:06.464
from the earthquake and the
helot rebellion that came after

00:22:06.464 --> 00:22:08.599
it.
They really didn't need more

00:22:08.599 --> 00:22:10.990
trouble.
So, they let the thing go.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.240
Now, the reason the
Spartans could take such a

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.286
caviler attitude in the past was
that they were the only great

00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:23.559
power in the Greek world.
But in 461 that was not true.

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:29.220
The losers, Megara,
had a choice.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.862
They could, and did,
go to Athens and say,

00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:36.150
"won't you help us against
Corinth?

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:42.544
If you do, we will leave the
Peloponnesian league and join

00:22:42.544 --> 00:22:47.119
the Athenian side."
Now, that is brought about,

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:50.079
as I say, by the new
circumstances.

00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:53.458
This is one of those places
where those of us who remember

00:22:53.458 --> 00:22:56.599
the Cold War are immediately
stuck by similarities.

00:22:56.599 --> 00:23:00.232
There were troubles all over
the world so long as it was

00:23:00.232 --> 00:23:04.130
known that NATO was on one side
and the Soviet Union and the

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.826
Warsaw pact was on the other.
All kinds of places that

00:23:07.826 --> 00:23:11.427
neither had any interest in
would call when they were in a

00:23:11.427 --> 00:23:14.650
war or some kind of a fight in
their own places,

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.511
Africa for instance,
they would go to one side or

00:23:17.511 --> 00:23:22.153
the other and say "help us,
or we will seek help from your

00:23:22.153 --> 00:23:24.756
enemy."
That confronted each side with

00:23:24.756 --> 00:23:27.567
a hard problem.
I don't give a damn about what

00:23:27.567 --> 00:23:29.711
happens in country X,
you might say,

00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:33.079
but I do not want the Russians
there and vice versa.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:37.619
This is the kind of problem
that one sees in this situation.

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:43.016
So, the Athenians were
confronted by an extremely tough

00:23:43.016 --> 00:23:46.750
decision.
I want to try to communicate to

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:52.259
you my sense of how difficult
the calls are in this situation.

00:23:52.259 --> 00:23:57.440
Now, one natural reaction would
be this, it seems to me.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.111
Why in the world should we
accept this defection from the

00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:06.192
Peloponnesian league,
because it is bound to anger

00:24:06.192 --> 00:24:10.130
the Spartans and very likely
bring us a war with the

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.146
Peloponnesians,
which is a very hard thing to

00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:17.169
face?
What do we care about the

00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:20.740
quarrel between Megara and
Corinth?

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.624
The opposite assumptions would
be, no we don't care about who

00:24:25.624 --> 00:24:29.369
wins the quarrel between Corinth
and Megara,

00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:34.991
but we do care about having
Megara on our side,

00:24:34.991 --> 00:24:41.744
because if we control Megara,
if the Megarians are on our

00:24:41.744 --> 00:24:48.442
side--Megara is situated on the
side of the isthmus right next

00:24:48.442 --> 00:24:51.000
to Athens.
More than that,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.520
there is a mountain range that
runs through Megara that makes

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.889
it very difficult for somebody
to make his way through that

00:24:59.889 --> 00:25:03.638
territory,
if they are opposed by military

00:25:03.638 --> 00:25:06.857
force.
In short, with the help of the

00:25:06.857 --> 00:25:12.111
Megarians, the Athenenians could
cut off access to Athens and

00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:16.489
probably for the most part to
central Greece to the

00:25:16.489 --> 00:25:20.430
Spartans.Let me put it more
sharply.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:24.149
The Athenians could feel
invulnerable to a Spartan

00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:27.109
attack, if they could control
Megara.

00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:31.855
Now, they would have to know
that if they took this offer,

00:25:31.855 --> 00:25:34.769
it might bring a war with
Sparta.

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:37.385
But there would have been
plenty of Athenians,

00:25:37.385 --> 00:25:40.640
who would have thought that is
going to happen anyway.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.047
The only question before us is,
"do we want to have a war with

00:25:46.047 --> 00:25:50.480
Sparta on these wonderfully
positive conditions,

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.244
or do we want to fight in the
old way in which we have no way

00:25:55.244 --> 00:25:59.690
to stop the Spartans from
marching into our territory and

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.740
destroying our field" and in
fact defeating us,

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.397
because the Athenians as yet
had not built walls,

00:26:08.397 --> 00:26:12.569
connecting Athens to the port
of Piraeus.

00:26:12.569 --> 00:26:17.723
So, the Spartans could cut off
the Athenians from their port,

00:26:17.723 --> 00:26:20.730
just by invading their
territory.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.755
And as we know the Athenians do
not produce enough food to feed

00:26:24.755 --> 00:26:27.448
themselves.
So, these would be the thoughts

00:26:27.448 --> 00:26:30.549
that were going through the
minds of the Athenians.

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:33.769
Notice, the critical element in
your decision,

00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:36.916
it seems to me,
is your prediction about what

00:26:36.916 --> 00:26:40.912
is likely in the future.
If you think there really is

00:26:40.912 --> 00:26:44.470
not danger of a war with Sparta,
why bring it on.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.907
But if you think there is a
real danger of a war with

00:26:47.907 --> 00:26:51.609
Sparta, why leave yourself
vulnerable to the Spartans.

00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:55.292
Whichever call you make,
there are dangers and

00:26:55.292 --> 00:26:59.384
uncertainties at the other end,
which I simply say,

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:04.990
welcome to the real world.
It is almost always that way.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.999
And it is a beautiful lesson in
how real those hard decisions

00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:13.022
are.
Well, the Athenian decision was

00:27:13.022 --> 00:27:18.228
to take Megara into the Athenian
alliance and to take the dangers

00:27:18.228 --> 00:27:23.580
that went with that.
And to make their task easier,

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:29.382
they built long walls
connecting the city of Megara

00:27:29.382 --> 00:27:34.720
with the port of Nicea on the
Saronic Gulf,

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.122
which is where Athens is
located as well and also to gain

00:27:39.122 --> 00:27:43.714
control of the town of Pegai,
which is on the--I guess I

00:27:43.714 --> 00:27:48.769
would say--the northern side of
the isthmus and to fortify and

00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:52.579
put forces between there.
In other words,

00:27:52.579 --> 00:27:58.539
to build a barrier to Spartan
capacity to move into Attica.

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:01.869
That was the great gain that
they made of it.

00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:04.769
One of the great prices
they paid;

00:28:04.769 --> 00:28:10.587
Thucydides says this in his own
voice, this he says was the

00:28:10.587 --> 00:28:15.000
beginning of Corinthian hatred
for Athens.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.343
It is a fact,
if you look at Corinthian and

00:28:17.343 --> 00:28:20.467
Athenian relations in the
past--we don't know a lot about

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:22.689
them,
but what we know suggests that

00:28:22.689 --> 00:28:25.057
they were not unfriendly.
They did okay,

00:28:25.057 --> 00:28:28.440
no problems really between
them, but from now on you're

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.509
going to have tremendous trouble
with Corinth,

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:35.857
and this as you know from
reading your Thucydides in the

00:28:35.857 --> 00:28:40.678
textbook--Corinth will play a
critical role in 431 in bringing

00:28:40.678 --> 00:28:44.710
on the Peloponnesian War that is
the Great War.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.794
So, that was one of the prices
the Athenians paid for this

00:28:47.794 --> 00:28:48.390
decision.

00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:56.875
Now, if you apply
Thucydides' judgment to the

00:28:56.875 --> 00:29:01.977
great Peloponnesian War and
apply it to this situation,

00:29:01.977 --> 00:29:06.039
it seems to me to ring very,
very true.

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:10.211
He said, you remember,
that the growing power of the

00:29:10.211 --> 00:29:15.119
Athenians caused fear among the
Spartans and led them--forced

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:18.484
them to work.
Well, there's no question that

00:29:18.484 --> 00:29:22.661
the Athenian power has grown.
These alliances that they have

00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:26.329
just made and this new
geo-political advantage they

00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:30.291
have gained through their
alliance with Megara suddenly

00:29:30.291 --> 00:29:33.079
make Athens much more
formidable,

00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:37.881
and there's no question that
the Spartans become fearful

00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:41.809
about that, and ultimately as we
shall see,

00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:48.109
fearful enough to join in a war
against the Athenians.

00:29:48.109 --> 00:29:50.082
So, I agree with Thucydides,
if you're talking about the

00:29:50.082 --> 00:29:51.804
First Peloponnesian War,
but that's not what he's

00:29:51.804 --> 00:29:55.474
talking about.
One great question that I would

00:29:55.474 --> 00:30:01.619
like to confront when we get to
the big war is "does it work?"

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:05.240
Does his evaluation work for
the big war?

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.844
I should warn you at once that
most scholars throughout the

00:30:08.844 --> 00:30:12.634
years have accepted Thucydides'
explanation and interpretation

00:30:12.634 --> 00:30:16.010
of the great Peloponnesian War,
and I don't.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.918
So be careful.
He was there,

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:23.041
he knows much more about it
than I do, and he's much smarter

00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:25.235
than I am.
So, if I say he's wrong,

00:30:25.235 --> 00:30:28.539
I better have a good case;
that's all I can say.

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:35.099
We need not say very much about
the war in detail.

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:38.509
Essentially,
the Athenians took the

00:30:38.509 --> 00:30:44.726
initiative and in a general way
when they fought battles at sea

00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:48.387
they won,
when they fought battles on

00:30:48.387 --> 00:30:52.238
land they didn't.
No great battles were fought

00:30:52.238 --> 00:30:56.661
for a couple of years;
the fighting took place in and

00:30:56.661 --> 00:31:01.764
around the eastern Peloponnesus
for the most part and nothing

00:31:01.764 --> 00:31:06.143
decisive happened.
Then we get down towards the

00:31:06.143 --> 00:31:10.866
year 457--I keep warning you
that the dates here are

00:31:10.866 --> 00:31:14.842
uncertain.
These are sort of consensus

00:31:14.842 --> 00:31:18.950
dates although we don't have
certainty.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:24.832
The Athenians received an
invitation from a ruler in Egypt

00:31:24.832 --> 00:31:31.230
who wanted to launch a rebellion
against the Persian Empire,

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:35.640
and he invited the Athenians to
send a force to help.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.210
The Athenians agreed to do it
and according to Thucydides they

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:45.960
sent a fleet of two hundred
ships for the purpose.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.029
That's an enormous fleet up to
this point.

00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:53.820
The Athenians by now have a
fleet that's bigger than that,

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.611
and they can afford to do it,
but I want you to understand

00:31:57.611 --> 00:32:03.380
this is a major undertaking.
Now, why did they do it?

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:07.668
They do it because the
opportunities in Egypt are

00:32:07.668 --> 00:32:10.822
tremendous.
Egypt is the greatest grain

00:32:10.822 --> 00:32:15.324
grower in the Mediterranean area
and we know the Athenians are

00:32:15.324 --> 00:32:18.349
always interested in sources of
grain,

00:32:18.349 --> 00:32:23.480
but Egypt is fantastically
wealthy, because of its great

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.132
fertility.
So, the Athenians if they can

00:32:27.132 --> 00:32:32.460
gain a share of that wealth will
of course profit from that.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.839
Finally, the Athenians are
still officially at war with

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:39.624
Persia.
So, it's perfectly reasonable

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:44.160
to try to strip the Persians of
possibly their richest profits.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.240
All of those things make their
decision understandable.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.270
Now, on the other hand,
you might ask the question now

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.619
you know you're engaged in a war
with various Peloponnesians and

00:32:54.619 --> 00:32:57.809
that although the Spartans
haven't taken any action yet,

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.139
you can expect some from them,
is this a great time for you to

00:33:01.139 --> 00:33:03.650
tackle yet another war against
the Persians?

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.454
Well, they thought so,
and I think it's evidence of

00:33:07.454 --> 00:33:11.944
the tremendous confidence that
the Athenians had acquired by

00:33:11.944 --> 00:33:14.605
this time,
and as we shall see,

00:33:14.605 --> 00:33:18.799
it was over confidence.
Of course, this whole story

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:22.937
fits beautifully into Greek
feelings, Greek ideas,

00:33:22.937 --> 00:33:27.460
Greek religion and mythology.
This will be a beautiful

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.858
example, if Herodotus were
writing the history instead of a

00:33:31.858 --> 00:33:35.650
very, very--I want to say
atheistic Thucydides.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.836
I'm not sure he was an atheist
but he was certainly very,

00:33:37.836 --> 00:33:40.194
very skeptical.
Herodotus would have been

00:33:40.194 --> 00:33:43.312
talking about hubris all
over the place,

00:33:43.312 --> 00:33:47.039
because that's the kind of a
situation that we have.

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:51.316
Well, let's forget about
that Athenian force in Egypt for

00:33:51.316 --> 00:33:55.593
the time being and let's look at
what the situation is in the

00:33:55.593 --> 00:33:59.478
year 457.
We have a wonderful piece of

00:33:59.478 --> 00:34:04.128
evidence, rare piece of
evidence, actually an

00:34:04.128 --> 00:34:10.679
inscription from that year which
is a part of a dedication,

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:15.906
a funeral dedication,
from a single Athenian tribe in

00:34:15.906 --> 00:34:21.736
which they list the war dead
from their tribe by where they

00:34:21.736 --> 00:34:26.360
fought and died and they're
proud of this.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.081
I mean, of course,
they're proud of the heroism of

00:34:29.081 --> 00:34:32.357
their men, but they're proud I
think also about the range of

00:34:32.357 --> 00:34:37.021
places that they're fighting,
unheard of, unexampled in all

00:34:37.021 --> 00:34:41.122
of Greek history--Egypt,
Phoenicia, Halias,

00:34:41.122 --> 00:34:46.199
which is a town in the
northeastern Peloponnesus,

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:51.098
Aegina the great island that
sits in the Saronic Gulf

00:34:51.098 --> 00:34:54.489
opposite Athens,
Aegina being a great

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:58.540
traditional enemy of Athens and
Megara,

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:03.621
of course, as you know.
So, here they are fighting

00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:07.429
battles in all of these places
at the same time.

00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:12.119
It's a kind of an ape man
pounding on his chest to show

00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:15.172
how great he was.
A piece of arrogance,

00:35:15.172 --> 00:35:17.976
you might say,
calling for vengeance by the

00:35:17.976 --> 00:35:21.581
gods, but no vengeance came
right away, instead another

00:35:21.581 --> 00:35:24.688
victory.
Aegina, the island of Aegina,

00:35:24.688 --> 00:35:28.839
was taken by the Athenians.
Aegina had been a great naval

00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:30.960
power.
So, here was a naval power

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.619
taken away from the enemy and
added to the Athenian side.

00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:38.977
They now have without question,
although they've had it really

00:35:38.977 --> 00:35:43.888
before, command of the seas.
Nobody can withstand them at

00:35:43.888 --> 00:35:50.018
sea and they now have complete
security from their northwestern

00:35:50.018 --> 00:35:56.345
frontier because of the Megarian
alliance and that's not all that

00:35:56.345 --> 00:35:58.885
happened.
Finally,

00:35:58.885 --> 00:36:03.700
moved, I would guess,
in part by seeing all of this

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.611
happening and worrying
desperately about the growing

00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:12.559
power of Athens,
Sparta took action.

00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:17.299
I think they were moved
specifically--the critical

00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:23.007
element that was an opportunity
presented to them by a small

00:36:23.007 --> 00:36:27.070
region in central Greece called
Doris.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.719
It's the root of the word
Dorian.

00:36:30.719 --> 00:36:36.309
This is theoretically the
ancestral home of all Dorians.

00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:40.380
So, they obviously had friendly
relations with the Spartans.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.936
The Dorians were having trouble
with some of their neighbors,

00:36:43.936 --> 00:36:47.375
one of the standard quarrels
between neighbors in the Greek

00:36:47.375 --> 00:36:50.210
city state world,
and they asked the Spartans to

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.722
send a force up to help them.
I'm not sure,

00:36:52.722 --> 00:36:56.767
if the Spartans would have done
so in the normal course of

00:36:56.767 --> 00:37:00.670
events, because it does mean
that they have to get up to

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:03.602
central Greece.
When you think about that,

00:37:03.602 --> 00:37:05.820
given what the Athenians have
done in Megara,

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.239
they can't do it in the usual
way by walking.

00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:11.994
The only way they can get up
there is by getting on boats and

00:37:11.994 --> 00:37:14.309
sailing across the Corinthian
Gulf,

00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:18.556
but if the Athenians or those
helots who are occupying

00:37:18.556 --> 00:37:23.299
Naupactus are aware of that,
they could very well be taken

00:37:23.299 --> 00:37:28.139
at sea and have their army
destroyed as that fleet is sunk.

00:37:28.139 --> 00:37:30.809
They have to sneak across if
they're going to go that way.

00:37:30.809 --> 00:37:35.603
I want you to understand how
unlikely is that undertaking in

00:37:35.603 --> 00:37:39.758
a normal situation,
but what I think makes it not

00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:44.739
so normal is something that
Diodorus of Sicily tells this,

00:37:44.739 --> 00:37:48.937
that Thucydides doesn't
mention, which is at that moment

00:37:48.937 --> 00:37:52.219
the Thebans, the leading city of
Boeotia,

00:37:52.219 --> 00:37:56.960
which had ambitions of its own,
always wanting to gain complete

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.624
control of Boeotia and always
having some Boeotian cities hold

00:38:01.624 --> 00:38:05.255
out against them,
they saw the opportunity to get

00:38:05.255 --> 00:38:09.469
the Spartans to help them out.
So, they told the Spartans

00:38:09.469 --> 00:38:13.628
that if they would come and
assist them in gaining control

00:38:13.628 --> 00:38:17.956
of Boeotia,
the Boeotians would join them

00:38:17.956 --> 00:38:24.112
in an attack on Athens,
and so I think it was that that

00:38:24.112 --> 00:38:30.610
made it possible for the
Spartans to agree and to act.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.007
They do so;
they take an army much more

00:38:33.007 --> 00:38:34.791
than they need to deal with the
Dorian problem,

00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:38.387
they slap that down right away,
and then what do you know,

00:38:38.387 --> 00:38:43.642
they come marching down to the
Athenian frontier with Boeotia

00:38:43.642 --> 00:38:48.110
to a town or a place near a town
called Tanagra.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:52.871
The Spartans,
of course, were able to sneak

00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:57.001
across the Gulf of Corinth.
You may ask,

00:38:57.001 --> 00:39:00.440
why were the Athenians and the
helots so sleepy?

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.645
It never occurred to them,
is what I say,

00:39:02.645 --> 00:39:06.008
that the Spartans would ever do
a thing like that and so there

00:39:06.008 --> 00:39:06.780
they were.

00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:14.971
A battle is then fought and
we're talking about large forces

00:39:14.971 --> 00:39:17.489
now.
The Spartans send 11,000 men

00:39:17.489 --> 00:39:22.139
and that's a very big--they
don't have 11,000 of their own.

00:39:22.139 --> 00:39:24.670
Spartans and their
Peloponnesian allies go up

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:28.119
there, and now they are put
together with Boeotian forces.

00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:30.489
Boeotians are very good
fighters.

00:39:30.489 --> 00:39:35.930
The Athenians send their army
out to the frontier to meet

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:40.400
them, the greater part of the
Athenian army.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.913
This is a very big battle by
Greek standards and the result

00:39:45.913 --> 00:39:51.530
is almost a standoff.
The Spartans technically win.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:56.301
That means that they were able
to command the field after the

00:39:56.301 --> 00:39:59.004
fighting was over,
put up a trophy,

00:39:59.004 --> 00:40:02.957
and collect their own dead.
The Athenians of course were

00:40:02.957 --> 00:40:06.144
required to come and ask them
for permission to collect their

00:40:06.144 --> 00:40:08.440
dead,
so there wasn't any question if

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.120
you follow the rules of hoplite
warfare at the time who won;

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.552
the Spartans won.
But if we think of it from

00:40:15.552 --> 00:40:19.756
the standpoint of warfare and
you ask about what were the

00:40:19.756 --> 00:40:22.760
strategic consequences of the
battle,

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:28.730
that's how today we would say
who won that battle.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.419
It was a standoff,
and I guess you could say the

00:40:31.419 --> 00:40:34.567
Athenians won because the
purpose of the Spartans was to

00:40:34.567 --> 00:40:37.830
defeat the Athenians and to
compel them to abandon all the

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:40.519
things that they were doing and
had done,

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:44.090
and in this they failed,
because they had suffered heavy

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:48.051
casualties in the fighting and
were not in a position to renew

00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:51.752
the battle and to force the
Athenians back or to crush the

00:40:51.752 --> 00:40:55.322
Athenians in fighting.
The Spartans simply marched

00:40:55.322 --> 00:40:58.360
back into the Peloponnesus;
the Athenians were in no

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.809
condition to stop them.
So that was that.

00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:05.822
As one sees from what
happens after that,

00:41:05.822 --> 00:41:10.563
it really looks more like a
strategic victory for the

00:41:10.563 --> 00:41:13.898
Athenians,
because now A) they have not

00:41:13.898 --> 00:41:17.206
been destroyed,
they have not been defeated in

00:41:17.206 --> 00:41:20.306
any useful way,
they have not been stopped in

00:41:20.306 --> 00:41:23.798
what they were doing and to
prove it the Athenians take an

00:41:23.798 --> 00:41:27.719
army northward when the Spartans
have withdrawn into Boeotia,

00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:33.960
defeat the Boeotian army at a
place called Oenophyta,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.703
and the next thing you know,
establish democratic

00:41:39.703 --> 00:41:46.028
governments in all the Boeotian
cities which are friendly to

00:41:46.028 --> 00:41:48.717
Athens.
I put it that way,

00:41:48.717 --> 00:41:53.840
but again a Cold War analogy
strikes me as helpful here.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.282
In the same way as wherever the
Soviet army was victorious,

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:02.410
whatever land they occupied,
there was a Communist

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:07.815
government set up whose function
was to be a tool of the Soviet

00:42:07.815 --> 00:42:09.831
Union.
I don't claim that that's

00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:11.900
exactly what it was in the fifth
century;

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.747
this is a much more simple and
less sophisticated world,

00:42:14.747 --> 00:42:16.559
but the general idea is the
same.

00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:20.750
The guys who run those towns,
they are partisans of Athens.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:24.169
Athens, in other words,
is the dominant force in

00:42:24.169 --> 00:42:26.314
Boeotia.
Now, step back a moment,

00:42:26.314 --> 00:42:29.940
stand up there on the Acropolis
in Athens and look around,

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.851
and you will see a situation
that is so splendid,

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:38.660
it's the kind of a thing almost
any nation would want as its

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:43.314
ideal situation.
If you look to the north you're

00:42:43.314 --> 00:42:45.326
safe;
there can be no invasion

00:42:45.326 --> 00:42:48.179
through Boeotia for the reasons
I've just said.

00:42:48.179 --> 00:42:52.283
If you look to the northwest
Megara, an ally of yours,

00:42:52.283 --> 00:42:56.541
your forces are in there in
part, but you have that area

00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:58.611
blocked off.
There is no way,

00:42:58.611 --> 00:43:01.886
and of course now that you know
that the Spartans can take boats

00:43:01.886 --> 00:43:04.902
across the Corinthian Gulf
you'll see to it that that never

00:43:04.902 --> 00:43:07.853
happens again.
The Spartans and their allies

00:43:07.853 --> 00:43:10.289
are bottled up in the
Peloponnesus.

00:43:10.289 --> 00:43:16.059
The sea is controlled
completely by you.

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:20.636
I've also neglected to
mention that the Athenians have

00:43:20.636 --> 00:43:25.614
just now concluded the building
of long walls connecting Athens

00:43:25.614 --> 00:43:28.710
with Piraeus.
So, even if somehow,

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:33.294
hard to imagine as it is,
the Spartans got into Attica

00:43:33.294 --> 00:43:38.224
the Athenians need not fight
them and need not give way to

00:43:38.224 --> 00:43:40.949
them,
because nobody knows how to

00:43:40.949 --> 00:43:44.944
take walled cities very well
anymore and the Spartans never

00:43:44.944 --> 00:43:48.890
learn how to do it.
So, if you look at it from that

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:51.949
point of view,
until somebody invents an

00:43:51.949 --> 00:43:55.039
airplane,
Athens is absolutely

00:43:55.039 --> 00:44:01.275
invulnerable and they still have
2,000 years before anybody

00:44:01.275 --> 00:44:07.402
invents an airplane so this is
an amazing moment where you

00:44:07.402 --> 00:44:12.239
could readily think we are
invulnerable,

00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:16.922
we are safe,
and we can do what we like with

00:44:16.922 --> 00:44:19.659
impunity.
I think this is a very

00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:23.230
important moment in Athenian and
in Greek history.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:27.888
I think then there were
Athenians who never got over

00:44:27.888 --> 00:44:31.360
remembering that's what we
achieved,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:36.896
that's what we can achieve,
and that's what we must aim for

00:44:36.896 --> 00:44:40.829
in all future circumstances.
We get into the

00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:44.092
Peloponnesian War and there will
come moments when it seems

00:44:44.092 --> 00:44:47.637
possible that the Athenians can
make a negotiated peace with the

00:44:47.637 --> 00:44:50.997
Spartans that's okay in the war,
and they turn it down,

00:44:50.997 --> 00:44:54.539
I think Thucydides and others
suggest that they're just out of

00:44:54.539 --> 00:44:56.505
their minds.
Maybe they are,

00:44:56.505 --> 00:44:59.498
but they have something they
can focus on,

00:44:59.498 --> 00:45:03.659
a memory of how it once was and
how it might be again.

00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:08.570
Well, the gods are not going to
put up with this;

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.449
you and I know that.
The Athenians suffer a terrible

00:45:12.449 --> 00:45:16.239
reverse that begins to undermine
their situation.

00:45:16.239 --> 00:45:19.010
In Egypt there is a
terrible disaster;

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.679
they lose.
The Persians defeat them;

00:45:21.679 --> 00:45:25.000
there's a great argument about
how many ships they lose but

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.178
whatever it is they lose a lot.
They lose a strategically

00:45:29.178 --> 00:45:33.532
significant number.
The disaster is so great as to

00:45:33.532 --> 00:45:38.492
cause a whole rash of rebellions
in the Delian League or the

00:45:38.492 --> 00:45:42.059
Athenian Empire,
or whatever you want to call

00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:46.348
it, and the Athenians will be
occupied with trying to put down

00:45:46.348 --> 00:45:51.511
these rebellions for some time.
By the way, the probable date

00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:56.959
of this defeat is probably
around 455, because it's in the

00:45:56.959 --> 00:46:02.353
following year,
and this date is a good date,

00:46:02.353 --> 00:46:09.446
454-453 that the Athenians
decide to move the treasury of

00:46:09.446 --> 00:46:16.617
the league from Delos to Athens,
up on the Acropolis in the back

00:46:16.617 --> 00:46:22.270
room of the Parthenon which they
will be building very shortly.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.962
Another important point
about that is up to now all

00:46:30.962 --> 00:46:35.318
money put into the league
treasury was being used for

00:46:35.318 --> 00:46:40.260
supporting the navy and
ostensibly for league purposes,

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.278
usually for league purposes,
but as we know the Athenians

00:46:43.278 --> 00:46:46.297
could also use it for their own
purposes like they did at

00:46:46.297 --> 00:46:49.282
Thasos,
but still only for ships and

00:46:49.282 --> 00:46:51.864
men.
Now the Athenians institute a

00:46:51.864 --> 00:46:56.545
new policy, and I think whatever
you think about anything before

00:46:56.545 --> 00:46:59.326
this,
when the Athenians do what I'm

00:46:59.326 --> 00:47:02.751
about to describe,
they surely have made this an

00:47:02.751 --> 00:47:06.005
empire,
no longer anything like a

00:47:06.005 --> 00:47:11.258
voluntary confederacy,
because they take one sixtieth

00:47:11.258 --> 00:47:17.217
of what is put into the treasury
every year as a donation to

00:47:17.217 --> 00:47:20.866
Athena,
which is another way of saying

00:47:20.866 --> 00:47:23.656
to Athens.
They are now collecting a

00:47:23.656 --> 00:47:27.296
profit, a tax from the league
members which they,

00:47:27.296 --> 00:47:31.998
as we shall see--there will be
an argument about how this money

00:47:31.998 --> 00:47:36.929
is to be used.
They will argue it's our money;

00:47:36.929 --> 00:47:40.059
we can use it any way we want
to.

00:47:40.059 --> 00:47:43.874
So, two things are going on in
two different directions and all

00:47:43.874 --> 00:47:46.519
the trouble that they have in
the league,

00:47:46.519 --> 00:47:51.801
it leads them however to change
the character of the league in a

00:47:51.801 --> 00:47:56.225
very significant way.
Well, things are so difficult,

00:47:56.225 --> 00:48:01.051
the problem of fighting the
Spartans now is so serious that

00:48:01.051 --> 00:48:05.793
the Athenians recall Cimon
because they would like to make

00:48:05.793 --> 00:48:11.117
peace with the Spartans and they
know Cimon is just the man to do

00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:15.577
it as no one else can.
So, he comes back--well,

00:48:15.577 --> 00:48:19.551
I should back up a second.
There was some talk about Cimon

00:48:19.551 --> 00:48:22.570
coming back earlier but he
certainly comes back in 451,

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:26.394
because his ten years of
ostracism are over,

00:48:26.394 --> 00:48:31.553
and it's now that he negotiates
a five-years truce with the

00:48:31.553 --> 00:48:34.966
Spartans,
with the understanding that the

00:48:34.966 --> 00:48:39.334
purpose of the truce is to allow
negotiation to go forward to

00:48:39.334 --> 00:48:43.630
bring about a long term peace
agreement between the two.

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:48.761
Cimon achieves that and to
show you how ostracism can work

00:48:48.761 --> 00:48:51.789
he is immediately elected
general.

00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:55.110
It's as though he had never
gone away, and being Cimon he

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:58.906
immediately turns to an activity
that's a continuation of what he

00:48:58.906 --> 00:49:03.329
did before he left,
namely, let's go fight Persians.

00:49:03.329 --> 00:49:08.351
So, he takes a fleet and sails
to Cyprus, part of which is in

00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:11.908
Persian hands,
fights a battle against the

00:49:11.908 --> 00:49:16.838
Persians, defeats the Persians,
but has the bad fortune to be

00:49:16.838 --> 00:49:21.290
killed.
So, Cimon is now removed from

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:27.000
the scene in Athens.
I think this is a significant

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.480
thing, because it means that the
only individual politician,

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:38.067
who had the kind of support,
the kind of charisma,

00:49:38.067 --> 00:49:43.403
the kind of backing that could
challenge the new important

00:49:43.403 --> 00:49:47.929
leader in Athens,
Pericles, is gone.

00:49:47.929 --> 00:49:53.005
This helps explain why Pericles
still at a relatively young age

00:49:53.005 --> 00:49:57.590
is able to become a person of
unprecedented influence and

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:01.881
power in the Athenian state.
It's not that he takes to

00:50:01.881 --> 00:50:05.626
himself new constitutional
powers or gets military guards

00:50:05.626 --> 00:50:09.304
or anything.
Nothing changes except that he

00:50:09.304 --> 00:50:14.209
can count on persuading the
assembly to do what he wants

00:50:14.209 --> 00:50:17.666
almost all the time,
and there's nobody out there

00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:19.978
for the moment,
who looks like he can challenge

00:50:19.978 --> 00:50:22.798
him.
We shall see that shortly that

00:50:22.798 --> 00:50:27.324
he will meet an important
challenge, but we'll come back

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:29.719
to that later on.
But let's go on with the story

00:50:29.719 --> 00:50:30.020
of the war.

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:38.101
In 449, two years after the
truce was negotiated,

00:50:38.101 --> 00:50:42.000
we find Sparta attacking the
city of Phocis,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.349
the polis of Phocis,
again up in central Greece.

00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:51.559
They must have--again,
we don't know how it was that

00:50:51.559 --> 00:50:56.817
they found their way up there,
but they did find their way up

00:50:56.817 --> 00:51:01.530
there, and they took back
control of the Delphic Oracle

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:06.334
from the neighboring Phocians,
who had--over the years they

00:51:06.334 --> 00:51:10.253
had frequently tried to gain
control of the Delphic Oracle

00:51:10.253 --> 00:51:14.446
from the priest and it was on
behalf of those priests that the

00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:18.882
Spartans fought.
They defeated the Phocians and

00:51:18.882 --> 00:51:22.106
went home.
Two years later in 447,

00:51:22.106 --> 00:51:25.019
the Athenians send an army up
there.

00:51:25.019 --> 00:51:30.051
The Athenians are allied to
Phocis and they once again take

00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:35.170
back the Delphic Oracle and give
it over to the Phocians.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:41.280
These are signals that the
truce is not really working.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:46.360
That the two sides are not
finding a way to live together

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:50.424
peacefully for the future,
and sure enough,

00:51:50.424 --> 00:51:55.760
in the year 446 a series of
events occurs that upsets the

00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.620
peace and the balance that the
Greek world had found

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.283
temporarily.
First of all,

00:52:03.283 --> 00:52:07.535
there is an oligarchic
rebellion throughout the cities

00:52:07.535 --> 00:52:11.791
of Boeotia and,
of course, they drive out the

00:52:11.791 --> 00:52:17.221
pro-Athenian democratic regimes
and suddenly Boeotia is a

00:52:17.221 --> 00:52:20.788
hostile place,
no longer a friendly place,

00:52:20.788 --> 00:52:24.269
one from which the Athenians
can expect trouble.

00:52:24.269 --> 00:52:29.519
There's a big argument in
Athens as to what should we do.

00:52:29.519 --> 00:52:32.929
Pericles says,
let's not do anything,

00:52:32.929 --> 00:52:37.758
we really can't afford to
engage in ground campaigns

00:52:37.758 --> 00:52:41.552
against serious opponents.
We tried it,

00:52:41.552 --> 00:52:45.679
but we can't keep Boeotia,
we'll just have to let the

00:52:45.679 --> 00:52:49.410
Boeotians go.
Against him was a general,

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:54.496
an Athenian general--sometimes
I'm astonished by the names that

00:52:54.496 --> 00:52:59.150
crop up in Athenian history.
You wouldn't dare do it;

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:01.852
you wouldn't invest names like
this if you were writing a

00:53:01.852 --> 00:53:03.590
novel, because people would
laugh.

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:09.268
This guy's name is Tolmades;
it comes from the Greek verb

00:53:09.268 --> 00:53:13.350
tolmao which means to be
bold, to be daring;

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:15.809
that's what he is â€“
bold and daring.

00:53:15.809 --> 00:53:20.851
He marches an army into Boeotia
to get the place back for the

00:53:20.851 --> 00:53:22.672
Athenians.
In other words,

00:53:22.672 --> 00:53:25.760
he defeated Pericles on this
issue, because he couldn't do

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.360
that without getting the
assembly's approval.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.320
But the Athenians must have
been mad too and said,

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.945
let's go beat those Boeotians
up and force them back into our

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:38.769
control.
Tolmades runs into a terrific

00:53:38.769 --> 00:53:44.541
defeat, suffers extremely heavy
casualties by anybody's

00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:49.030
standards and Boeotia is lost
for good.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:54.508
The battle, by the way,
in which Tolmades is killed in

00:53:54.508 --> 00:53:58.902
the Battle of Coronea.
Athens is now driven from

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:02.926
central Greece and that glorious
picture I painted for you has

00:54:02.926 --> 00:54:06.619
been marred by a hostile force
on the northern enemy.

00:54:06.619 --> 00:54:07.960
But that isn't all that's
happened.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.540
Seeing that the Athenians were
troubled, were weak,

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.190
were vulnerable,
and can be beaten,

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:18.160
suddenly all of the unhappy
folks that were around took

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:23.109
advantage of the opportunity.
On the island of Euboea to the

00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:26.489
east of Attica,
there is a rebellion.

00:54:26.489 --> 00:54:30.679
This is really deadly even from
Pericles point of view.

00:54:30.679 --> 00:54:36.070
He cannot permit rebellions in
the empire on islands;

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:39.710
it threatens the control of the
sea.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:43.559
It's not just that he can't
have Euboea be independent;

00:54:43.559 --> 00:54:47.416
he cannot let rebels in your
empire succeed because it

00:54:47.416 --> 00:54:51.565
encourages other rebellions,
and they've just been through

00:54:51.565 --> 00:54:53.987
that.
They've had to fight their way

00:54:53.987 --> 00:54:57.109
through a whole rash of
rebellions after the defeat in

00:54:57.109 --> 00:55:00.040
Egypt.
So, Pericles personally

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:04.486
takes an army and sends it,
takes it, I should say,

00:55:04.486 --> 00:55:10.000
to Euboea and while he is gone
with his army off in Euboea,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.853
remember with Boeotia now
hostile, there is a rebellion in

00:55:14.853 --> 00:55:17.913
Megara.
This alliance with Megara was

00:55:17.913 --> 00:55:21.800
always a very iffy thing.
We should remember two things

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.528
about the past.
One is that Megara and Athens

00:55:24.528 --> 00:55:26.900
have been bitter enemies for
centuries;

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:30.605
so, the alliance was an
unnatural one,

00:55:30.605 --> 00:55:34.309
the product of momentary
agreement.

00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:37.442
But there would certainly have
always been lots of Megarians,

00:55:37.442 --> 00:55:39.949
who were against it,
and so seeing an opportunity

00:55:39.949 --> 00:55:45.540
these guys would have moved.
And the other thing is that the

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:51.358
Athenians were,
of course, being distracted and

00:55:51.358 --> 00:55:57.050
their forces were sent off
someplace else.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:01.108
So, now Pericles realizes how
dangerous this is,

00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:06.289
because if Megara succeeds in
the rebellion which it does,

00:56:06.289 --> 00:56:11.299
now they have no protection
from a Spartan invasion which

00:56:11.299 --> 00:56:16.130
they need to expect and that is
indeed what happens.

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.517
Pericles,
having put down the Euboean

00:56:19.517 --> 00:56:23.668
rebellion adequately,
races back to Athens to meet

00:56:23.668 --> 00:56:27.309
the Peloponnesian army when it
invades,

00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:32.598
and then we have this
extraordinary event in the

00:56:32.598 --> 00:56:38.002
plains to the north of Attica.
Spartans invade,

00:56:38.002 --> 00:56:43.750
Pericles leads the Athenian
army out to meet them.

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:47.751
This is the scenario for an
Athenian defeat,

00:56:47.751 --> 00:56:53.055
because the numbers of the
Peloponnesians are likely to be

00:56:53.055 --> 00:56:58.638
greater and their reputation as
a superior fighting force has

00:56:58.638 --> 00:57:01.689
some merit.
We've seen that it's not going

00:57:01.689 --> 00:57:03.990
to be a walk over,
we've seen that the Athenians

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:06.389
are capable of putting up one
hell of a fight,

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:10.780
but they can expect not to win,
is the way I see it.

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:15.177
So, they are facing each other,
and the battle is about to

00:57:15.177 --> 00:57:19.728
happen, when all of a sudden a
delegation comes out from the

00:57:19.728 --> 00:57:23.007
Spartan army.
Pericles goes out to meet them,

00:57:23.007 --> 00:57:24.975
they have a little
conversation,

00:57:24.975 --> 00:57:27.260
they all go back to their
armies,

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:31.932
the Spartans led by their King
Pleistoanax who was the guy who

00:57:31.932 --> 00:57:37.966
was confirmed with Pericles,
and marched their army back

00:57:37.966 --> 00:57:42.691
home to Sparta.
They declare that they have

00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:48.552
agreed upon a four-months truce
for the purpose of negotiating a

00:57:48.552 --> 00:57:53.601
permanent peace.
What in the world is going on

00:57:53.601 --> 00:57:58.185
here?
Well, the Spartans receive the

00:57:58.185 --> 00:58:04.997
news in a complicated way.
The first reaction is fury

00:58:04.997 --> 00:58:09.271
against Pleistoanax.
Why didn't you clobber those

00:58:09.271 --> 00:58:12.668
Athenians when you had them
finally sticking their heads out

00:58:12.668 --> 00:58:15.935
there for battle?
They finally take action

00:58:15.935 --> 00:58:21.137
against him and against his
advisor, a certain Clearidas and

00:58:21.137 --> 00:58:25.823
send them off to exile,
so angry are they at this lost

00:58:25.823 --> 00:58:27.674
opportunity.
But after all,

00:58:27.674 --> 00:58:31.164
if that's all there was to it,
there was nothing to stop them

00:58:31.164 --> 00:58:35.800
from marching into Attica again,
and either fighting against the

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.665
Athenians, or at least doing
terrible harm to the farms and

00:58:40.665 --> 00:58:44.860
the houses of the Athenians out
in the country,

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.917
which at the very least,
would make the Athenians

00:58:46.917 --> 00:58:49.190
unhappy and might force them to
come out and fight.

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:51.346
Why didn't they do that?
But they didn't,

00:58:51.346 --> 00:58:53.338
and I think that's
evidence--well,

00:58:53.338 --> 00:58:56.651
it's evidence of two things.
There was a very special

00:58:56.651 --> 00:58:59.354
opportunity that Pleistoanax had
lost, namely,

00:58:59.354 --> 00:59:02.837
everything was falling apart on
all fronts in Athens at the

00:59:02.837 --> 00:59:05.360
moment when the battle was
available.

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.269
On the other hand that's
now--they've been put down.

00:59:08.269 --> 00:59:11.765
Euboea is quiet and the
Athenians have adjusted to

00:59:11.765 --> 00:59:14.663
everything else.
Still what I said in the first

00:59:14.663 --> 00:59:17.246
place is still true,
they could come in and force

00:59:17.246 --> 00:59:19.969
that fight if they want to.
Why didn't they?

00:59:19.969 --> 00:59:23.578
I think the answer is because
Pericles had convinced

00:59:23.578 --> 00:59:27.683
Pleistoanax of something that
was essentially true and that

00:59:27.683 --> 00:59:31.787
the Spartans when they had time
to cool down could see that

00:59:31.787 --> 00:59:34.830
there was some reason for doing
this,

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:38.469
and it was this.
What happens if we fight?

00:59:38.469 --> 00:59:40.461
Look we only fought each other
a little while ago and what

00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:41.920
happened then?
Well, you beat us,

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:45.375
but you didn't clobber us.
You took a lot of casualties,

00:59:45.375 --> 00:59:47.989
and you weren't able to exploit
it.

00:59:47.989 --> 00:59:51.178
That is even truer today than
it was then, because if you

00:59:51.178 --> 00:59:54.596
defeat us, what will we do?
We'll run back to our walls,

00:59:54.596 --> 00:59:58.193
we'll go through our gates,
and you won't be able to lay a

00:59:58.193 --> 01:00:00.721
pinky on us,
and we don't have to fight you

01:00:00.721 --> 01:00:03.303
if we don't want to,
because we own the fleet that

01:00:03.303 --> 01:00:06.476
dominates the sea.
We have the money from our

01:00:06.476 --> 01:00:10.688
allies that pays for the fleet.
As long as we have control of

01:00:10.688 --> 01:00:14.289
the sea you can ravage our
country all you want to.

01:00:14.289 --> 01:00:17.280
We can get all the grain we
need through imports.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.530
So, what are you going to do
then?

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:22.873
You'll have taken casualties
for nothing and you still won't

01:00:22.873 --> 01:00:25.309
be able to compel us to do what
you want.

01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:29.682
I think that's the argument
that Pericles must have given to

01:00:29.682 --> 01:00:32.498
Pleistoanax.
Pleistoanax's whole career

01:00:32.498 --> 01:00:36.740
suggests he was not a man eager
for war and he was glad to have

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.587
that opportunity to avoid it.
But remember,

01:00:39.587 --> 01:00:41.458
the Spartans could have
overdone that,

01:00:41.458 --> 01:00:44.449
and they didn't.
I think it shows you that this

01:00:44.449 --> 01:00:48.440
was an argument that had some
reality and had some appeal.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.909
So, that four-month truce was
successful.

01:00:52.909 --> 01:00:59.338
It led to the negotiation a
peace between Athens on behalf

01:00:59.338 --> 01:01:05.090
of its allies and Sparta on
behalf of its allies,

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:12.348
the thirty-years peace which is
concluded over the winter of 446

01:01:12.348 --> 01:01:15.326
- 445.
The arrangements of that

01:01:15.326 --> 01:01:19.805
peace are that Athens would give
up all of its holdings on the

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:23.550
continent that is to say outside
the Aegean Sea,

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:27.594
except Naupactus,
which they would continue to

01:01:27.594 --> 01:01:30.739
leave in the hands of the
helots.

01:01:30.739 --> 01:01:34.019
In tacit recognition,
nobody formally did it,

01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:38.417
but the point is they let the
Athenian allies be included in

01:01:38.417 --> 01:01:42.739
the Athenian decision that meant
the Spartans granted,

01:01:42.739 --> 01:01:48.440
recognized, the legitimacy of
the Athenian Empire.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.224
Then they had a few rules meant
to prevent the outbreak of war

01:01:53.224 --> 01:01:56.527
in the future,
and like most of these peace

01:01:56.527 --> 01:02:00.769
treaties, who decide to try to
prevent war in the future,

01:02:00.769 --> 01:02:04.711
they basically looked back to
how this war started and try to

01:02:04.711 --> 01:02:07.010
prevent this war happening
again.

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:10.329
For instance,
this war came about because the

01:02:10.329 --> 01:02:13.800
ally of one side changed sides
to the other;

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.699
that was forbidden under the
new treaty.

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:20.269
Somebody must have thought,
yeah right, but what if there's

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:23.840
a neutral state that wants to go
from one side to the other,

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.782
and what if that state had a
significant strategic

01:02:27.782 --> 01:02:32.769
importance, wouldn't that test
the peace at all or would it?

01:02:32.769 --> 01:02:37.205
They concluded it wouldn't,
because they said neutrals were

01:02:37.205 --> 01:02:40.199
free to join either side.
So, in other words,

01:02:40.199 --> 01:02:43.087
if a neutral joined one side,
nobody could say okay that's a

01:02:43.087 --> 01:02:47.974
cause for war because it wasn't.
Finally, the most remarkable,

01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:53.886
and I believe original,
absolutely original idea of its

01:02:53.886 --> 01:02:56.737
kind ever.
I don't believe there's ever a

01:02:56.737 --> 01:02:59.496
time in history that we have a
record of such a thing being

01:02:59.496 --> 01:03:02.043
present.
I'm talking about a clause in

01:03:02.043 --> 01:03:06.369
the treaty, which provided that
if in the future there were any

01:03:06.369 --> 01:03:09.510
disagreements between the two
signatories,

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:13.721
any complaints that they had
against one another,

01:03:13.721 --> 01:03:18.809
these must be submitted to an
arbitrator for a decision.

01:03:18.809 --> 01:03:21.126
Remember,
I'm not talking about a

01:03:21.126 --> 01:03:24.150
mediator who says,
"let's talk it over boys."

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:28.453
I'm talking about an arbitrator
who has the right and

01:03:28.453 --> 01:03:32.840
responsibility to say,
"you're right," "you're wrong,"

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:37.796
or some version of such a thing.
If that clause had been adhered

01:03:37.796 --> 01:03:41.813
to, it's only a matter of logic
that says there could never be a

01:03:41.813 --> 01:03:45.693
war between these two sides.
It's an amazing idea,

01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:51.223
and I'm going to claim with no
proof--I'll be doing this again

01:03:51.223 --> 01:03:56.389
and again for a while,
I think this is Pericles' idea.

01:03:56.389 --> 01:03:59.894
Because I mean everything that
I'm going to point to that's so

01:03:59.894 --> 01:04:03.400
unusual and unheard of before
Pericles is involved with it,

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.429
and I think he just had that
kind of mind,

01:04:06.429 --> 01:04:09.753
very inventive,
ready to find new ways to meet

01:04:09.753 --> 01:04:13.576
old problems.
I think this was his notion and

01:04:13.576 --> 01:04:18.213
I'm convinced it was his
determination that this would be

01:04:18.213 --> 01:04:23.015
the case that in the future
there would not be a settlement

01:04:23.015 --> 01:04:26.409
of differences by the threat of
war,

01:04:26.409 --> 01:04:31.231
but by arbitration that helps
explain the very determined

01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:35.480
position he will take in 431.
This is very important.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.696
I don't know how much the
Spartans felt that way or knew

01:04:38.696 --> 01:04:41.586
about what was going to happen,
obviously they didn't,

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:44.710
but they bought it.
That's the treaty;

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:48.167
the two sides swear to it and
for thirty years they must

01:04:48.167 --> 01:04:51.615
adhere to these provisions.
That is the thirty-years peace

01:04:51.615 --> 01:04:54.920
and I think we need to evaluate
it to get at this argument I'm

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.900
engaged with Thucydides that
you're listening in on.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.930
That is, there are peaces and
there are peaces.

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:05.441
They're not all the same.
I, for my own purposes,

01:05:05.441 --> 01:05:11.026
have come up with I think three
categories of peace and want to

01:05:11.026 --> 01:05:14.360
suggest which one this belongs
in.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:20.479
There is such a thing as
a--people have spoken of the

01:05:20.479 --> 01:05:26.708
First World War the--I'm sorry
the Peace of Versailles was

01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:32.610
often referred to by its critics
as a Punic peace.

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:35.207
They're talking about the
peace--they think they're

01:05:35.207 --> 01:05:38.219
talking about the peace that
concluded the second Punic War

01:05:38.219 --> 01:05:39.570
with Hannibal,
but no;

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:44.962
they're talking about the third
Punic War in which the peace was

01:05:44.962 --> 01:05:48.130
the City of Carthage was
destroyed.

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:52.630
The Carthaginians were driven
away, those who were not killed.

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:56.060
The fields were plowed up and
salt put in the furrows,

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:59.750
so they thought nobody could
grow anything there again.

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:04.198
That's a Punic peace and
there's something to be said for

01:06:04.198 --> 01:06:07.885
a Punic peace.
You'll never have a war again

01:06:07.885 --> 01:06:11.383
with that country,
because it doesn't exist

01:06:11.383 --> 01:06:15.630
anymore.
That's one extreme.

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:20.715
At the other extreme is
where, I suppose,

01:06:20.715 --> 01:06:25.800
the winning side can impose a
harsh peace,

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.857
but chooses to impose a gentle
peace in the hope that in the

01:06:29.857 --> 01:06:34.190
future they will have friendly
relations with the other side,

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:39.586
and so they trust the other
side, even though it's not

01:06:39.586 --> 01:06:43.746
destroyed, to be good.
There are such examples of such

01:06:43.746 --> 01:06:46.036
things.
They're usually a case where

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:49.598
the defeated side has been so
weakened that it's highly

01:06:49.598 --> 01:06:53.160
unlikely in the future that they
will be a problem.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.420
Then there's a kind of
a--let me back up a step.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:05.279
Then there's the kind of a
peace that people say was

01:07:05.279 --> 01:07:09.517
represented by the peace of
Westphalia in 1648 that ended

01:07:09.517 --> 01:07:13.679
the Thirty Years War in Europe
in which arrangements are

01:07:13.679 --> 01:07:17.160
made--nobody has actually been
defeated.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:22.139
There is no clear-cut winner;
there are no just plain losers.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:26.554
Everybody has fought so long
and the cost has been so great

01:07:26.554 --> 01:07:30.360
that they decided we can't hold
out for victory.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.699
We got to cut the best deal we
can.

01:07:33.699 --> 01:07:38.311
Such a peace depends--it may
work, it may not,

01:07:38.311 --> 01:07:44.562
it depends upon circumstances
in the future that are very hard

01:07:44.562 --> 01:07:49.574
to predict.
Then we come to what I

01:07:49.574 --> 01:07:55.320
think is probably the worst kind
of peace.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:02.416
One example of it is the peace
that the Prussians imposed upon

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:07.449
the French in 1870,
after the Franco-Prussian War

01:08:07.449 --> 01:08:12.805
in which the big issue was they
took Alsace-Lorraine from the

01:08:12.805 --> 01:08:16.020
French and annexed it to
Germany,

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:22.607
but at the same time they did
not so harm France that France

01:08:22.607 --> 01:08:28.121
could never again be a menace.
But they could be sure that for

01:08:28.121 --> 01:08:31.439
the foreseeable future,
and who knows maybe forever,

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:37.076
the French would be angry and
dissatisfied and determined to

01:08:37.076 --> 01:08:40.939
recover Alsace-Lorraine,
even if it meant war.

01:08:40.939 --> 01:08:43.006
That was true,
to a degree,

01:08:43.006 --> 01:08:47.614
although we need to be aware
that the best evidence we have

01:08:47.614 --> 01:08:52.064
is that by 1914 the French
actually had pretty well given

01:08:52.064 --> 01:08:56.246
up on Alsace-Lorraine,
although people kept talking as

01:08:56.246 --> 01:08:59.970
though that's why the French
went to war, but wasn't true.

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:02.941
But also there,
of course, there were Frenchmen

01:09:02.941 --> 01:09:06.235
who did believe that way,
but on balance it probably

01:09:06.235 --> 01:09:08.888
wasn't so.
I suppose the best example

01:09:08.888 --> 01:09:12.269
of that unsatisfactory peace
though is the peace that ended

01:09:12.269 --> 01:09:15.603
the First World War,
the Peace of Versailles,

01:09:15.603 --> 01:09:19.176
where the Germans were treated
very harshly,

01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:23.529
in their own opinion,
although much harsher solutions

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:27.639
were available that were
rejected, but also they lost a

01:09:27.639 --> 01:09:32.510
lot of territory and had a lot
of restrictions put upon them,

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:38.336
but also there was no permanent
harm that guaranteed that

01:09:38.336 --> 01:09:43.490
Germany would not be able,
when it recovered from the war,

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:47.956
to reverse that decision.
That is the same kind of thing,

01:09:47.956 --> 01:09:52.629
terrible situation in which the
defeated power is totally

01:09:52.629 --> 01:09:57.802
dissatisfied with the peace and
is in a condition down the road

01:09:57.802 --> 01:10:02.603
to be strong enough to break it.
Now, where does the

01:10:02.603 --> 01:10:07.481
thirty-years peace fit in here?
The closest analogy,

01:10:07.481 --> 01:10:10.470
in my opinion,
is Westphalia.

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:15.516
I think that the two sides
had both found this a very

01:10:15.516 --> 01:10:20.318
unpleasant, uncomfortable war,
producing dangers and risks

01:10:20.318 --> 01:10:24.084
that neither had ever
anticipated, and that the forces

01:10:24.084 --> 01:10:28.490
who were in control at the time
that the peace was made felt it

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:33.037
just wasn't worth having a fight
to the finish for the gains that

01:10:33.037 --> 01:10:39.739
could be made.
So, this is the key thing.

01:10:39.739 --> 01:10:43.989
If that is true,
then peace was possible.

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:51.329
Then the Peloponnesian War that
follows is not inevitable.

01:10:51.329 --> 01:10:55.147
Scholars argue still did
Thucydides say it was

01:10:55.147 --> 01:10:57.430
inevitable?
I think he did;

01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:00.322
most scholars do.
Some people think not,

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:04.883
but whatever he may have said
that is certainly a view many a

01:11:04.883 --> 01:11:07.463
scholar has taken.
So I'm saying no,

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:10.993
and the reason I'm saying that
is--first of all because of the

01:11:10.993 --> 01:11:13.250
facts I've just laid out before
you,

01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:17.633
but I think also this is
important, so much depends not

01:11:17.633 --> 01:11:21.529
only on objective conditions but
on intention.

01:11:21.529 --> 01:11:25.400
This is one place where
historians differ typically from

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.624
political scientists.
Political scientists like to

01:11:29.624 --> 01:11:33.600
have everything--what's the word
I want?

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.690
Not having to do with human
intention in any case.

01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:39.190
They had to be automatic;
they like to be systemic.

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:43.270
That's what they like.
Nations are billiard balls.

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:47.399
You can't look inside them;
they're not made up of people.

01:11:47.399 --> 01:11:48.970
They're not even made up of
factions or parties.

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:53.183
The state does what it has to
do because of the place on the

01:11:53.183 --> 01:11:56.955
pool table where it is located.
Historians like to ask what

01:11:56.955 --> 01:11:59.525
were these guys interested in,
what did they want,

01:11:59.525 --> 01:12:02.199
what were they afraid of,
who were they made at?

01:12:02.199 --> 01:12:06.236
That's the way proper
historians--it's true that

01:12:06.236 --> 01:12:10.529
proper historians are harder and
harder to find.

01:12:10.529 --> 01:12:15.228
Too many sort of political
scientists hidden among the

01:12:15.228 --> 01:12:16.300
historians.

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:26.707
But a key question to whether
this peace rather would last has

01:12:26.707 --> 01:12:30.800
to do with, in my opinion,
with these human questions.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.250
How do the players really feel
about it?

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:37.288
Do they see it as this is the
way that it's going to be,

01:12:37.288 --> 01:12:40.272
we want it to be peaceful or
are they just accepting it

01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:44.111
because they can't avoid it?
Well, I think the evidence

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:48.733
suggests that the people who
made the treaty certainly were

01:12:48.733 --> 01:12:52.239
persuaded that peace was better
than war,

01:12:52.239 --> 01:12:55.269
and they would like to bind
their hands to some degree to

01:12:55.269 --> 01:12:57.380
make it harder for a war to come
out.

01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.494
Pericles, I think,
will prove that by the time we

01:13:00.494 --> 01:13:03.479
get a chance to examine his
behavior in 431,

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:06.667
but I think it was the peace
party, and there are parties in

01:13:06.667 --> 01:13:10.019
Sparta as I've told you before,
that group of people who

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:14.008
typically was conservative and
reluctant to risk what they had

01:13:14.008 --> 01:13:17.539
already for what they might gain
in future warfare,

01:13:17.539 --> 01:13:21.847
and I believe that they were
the normal party in Sparta,

01:13:21.847 --> 01:13:25.571
and this is all debatable,
but I think that that's the

01:13:25.571 --> 01:13:30.009
normal situation in Sparta.
To break the peace you need

01:13:30.009 --> 01:13:35.250
for that situation to be undone
by something and events,

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:38.967
opportunities,
fears, chances to succeed have

01:13:38.967 --> 01:13:43.359
to fall into place in a certain
way to break that.

01:13:43.359 --> 01:13:46.575
So, what I'm telling you is,
from my point of view,

01:13:46.575 --> 01:13:50.369
it's not at all clear that
there needs to be another war.

01:13:50.369 --> 01:13:55.618
Well, anybody who says that has
the obligation of examining why

01:13:55.618 --> 01:14:00.260
did the war break out?
Why did the peace fail?

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:04.380
And that's what I will turn to
next.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.935
I will examine the years
between 445 and 431 in which the

01:14:08.935 --> 01:14:13.571
peace is tested to see whether
it really had any viability

01:14:13.571 --> 01:14:16.538
before it failed.
We'll have a look at that next

01:14:16.538 --> 01:14:17.538
time.

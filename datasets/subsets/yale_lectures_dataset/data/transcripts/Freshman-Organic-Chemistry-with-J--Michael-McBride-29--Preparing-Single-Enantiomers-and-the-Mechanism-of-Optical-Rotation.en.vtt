00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.367
Prof: So you remember
Pasteur was very fond of racemic

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.280
and tartaric acid.
 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.052
So when he'd travel around he
would look for samples of

00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:14.170
tartaric acid.
 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.115
There are very detailed
accounts that he published of

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:19.330
these travels.
 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.980
I haven't found this one,
so I'm not sure it's true.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.452
It may be apocryphal,
but it was told to me by the

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:27.370
guy who taught me organic
chemistry.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.305
So I pass it onto you,
for what it's worth,

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:30.780
because it makes a good point.
 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.220
He said that Pasteur was in
Alsace,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.310
the wine-producing region in
northeast France,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.495
and in the town of Thann he
found in a pharmacy a bottle of

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:43.660
racemic acid that was moldy.
 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.200
So remember racemic acid's the
50:50 mixture.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.985
So, since he liked racemic acid
-- and in fact it was becoming

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:51.420
rare.
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.480
It's a not a very common
product;

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.240
mostly you get the handed stuff.
 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.442
So he took it back and cleaned
it up, got rid of the mold that

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:02.149
was growing on it.
 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.132
And what he found was that
after he had purified it,

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.022
it was the unnatural,
the left-handed,

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:11.599
not the one you normally get.
 

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:14.938
Can you see an explanation for
that?

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:19.793
Had the apothecary mislabeled
it because he thought he could

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:24.400
get a higher price for racemic
than for tartaric acid?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.010
Or might he have been innocent?
 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.819
Zack?
 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:28.879
Student:  Was it the
mold by any chance?

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:30.989
Prof: What did the mold
do?

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:32.590
Student:  Might have
converted one into all.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.830
Prof: Didn't convert.
 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.830
Student:  It didn't?
 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.534
Prof: The mold ate the
natural stuff,

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:41.553
converted it into something
completely different,

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:43.440
leaving the unnatural one.
 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.310
Okay?
 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.620
Remember the smell of the
carvones?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.358
Natural things,
enzymes and so on,

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:51.519
can distinguish between the two
hands,

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:54.736
and naturally the stuff that
normally eats tartaric acid is

00:01:54.736 --> 00:01:56.790
going to eat normal tartaric
acid,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.040
not the unusual one.
 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.670
So it left the unusual one.
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.180
The penicillium glaucum
had eaten the R,R.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.218
Okay, so that's one way of
doing resolution,

00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:11.979
to get rid of one enantiomer
from a racemic mixture,

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.157
leaving the other one,
because diastereomeric

00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:17.538
reactions have different rates.
 

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.476
It's a right hand shaking a
right hand versus a right hand

00:02:20.476 --> 00:02:22.030
shaking a left hand;
they're just different.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.280
So one will go faster than the
other.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.400
So if you react a racemate with
some chiral reagent --

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.084
of course you have to use only
one hand of that other thing you

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:33.295
add in there --
but then you'll react with one

00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:34.330
more than the other.
 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.509
It could be even a catalyst so
that it doesn't get consumed;

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.270
an enzyme, for example.
 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.407
But that's not Nature's way,
because it's very inefficient

00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:44.389
to make both and then destroy
one.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.318
What nature does is prepare
only one enantiomer.

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:50.414
And you can do that,
prepare only one,

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:53.190
by starting with something
that's already a single

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.229
enantiomer and building on that.
 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.900
Or you can use a reagent,
which is resolved,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.009
that will -- because
diastereomeric rates are

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.622
different --
will tend to produce one of the

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:07.060
two enantiomers.
 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.788
So here's an example of this
molecule we've been talking

00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:13.498
about,
Eisai-7389, with its nineteen

00:03:13.498 --> 00:03:16.622
asymmetric centers,
that's made artificially,

00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:17.520
commercially.
 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.068
And this is where those
nineteen centers came from.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:24.878
Five of them came from starting
materials that they bought as a

00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:25.740
single hand.
 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.770
But the rest were all made.
 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.348
One of them was done by
chromatography.

00:03:30.348 --> 00:03:33.888
They have chromatography
columns about this big around,

00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:36.639
and this high,
with chiral stuff inside.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.500
So you pass your thing through.
 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.541
One hand goes through a little
faster than the other,

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:45.110
because of its diastereomeric
interaction with the packing;

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.508
one comes through quicker.
 

00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:48.930
And they actually do that for
one of the centers.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.541
But the others are all done by
reactions that preferentially

00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.990
give one center rather than the
other.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.324
Three of them are ones that
everybody knew which one they

00:03:58.324 --> 00:03:59.098
would give.
 

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:02.270
The other ones they just had to
hope, and fiddle around with

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.331
different reactions until they
found one that would do the

00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:05.870
trick.
 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.074
So anyhow, they were able to
generate these nineteen

00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:10.080
stereocenters.
 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.348
Now we're left with a problem.
 

00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:17.089
That incidentally is all we're
going to have for the exam on

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.660
Friday.
 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.259
Okay?
 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.980
So now we're on to other stuff
that will be covered on the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.750
final exam, and in particular
return to this question about

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.850
the tartaric acids.
 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.439
Remember there's d-(+)
and l-(-).

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.978
Could you have l-(+) and
d-(-),

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:34.069
of a different compound?
 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.629
Why not?
 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.220
What does d or l
mean, in this context?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.790
Student:
&gt;.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.819
Prof: Andrew?
 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.680
Student:  It reflects
light to the left.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.600
Prof: It means which way
it rotates the light.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.160
Right?
 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.790
And the plus means the same
thing, as d.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.670
So it's redundant,
this particular nomenclature.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.471
But there's a question mark
because when -- Fischer just

00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:00.490
guessed, remember?
 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.569
And it could easily have been
the opposite.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.120
So which way is it?
 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.129
Right?
 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.173
So if we knew,
if we knew how optical activity

00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:12.298
worked, then by measuring the
optical activity we'd know which

00:05:12.298 --> 00:05:14.529
of those structures is right.
 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.250
Okay?
 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.250
But we don't know that;
at least I don't know that.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.148
Now there's a lot of knowledge
about this, but it's a very,

00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:24.560
very tough problem.
 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.706
Fortunately there's a book by
Laurence Barron called

00:05:27.706 --> 00:05:31.036
Molecular Light Scattering
and Optical Activity,

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:32.949
which goes into this stuff.
 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.949
And I see Professor Vaccaro --
Prof: I'm here.

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.589
Prof: Oh,
so we have a copy of the book.

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:38.540
That's great.
 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.910
But even better than that,
we have Laurence Barron.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.879
Prof: Or a copy of
Laurence Barron.

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.100
Prof: Or a copy of
Laurence Barron.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.690
&gt;
 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.440
Perhaps it's the mirror image
of Laurence Barron.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.600
So he's going to tell us how
this works.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:09.910
&lt;&lt;Technical
instructions&gt;&gt;

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.620
Prof: Well good morning
everybody.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.858
I was both delighted and
dismayed, at the same time,

00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:20.843
when Professor McBride asked me
to try and -- well to address

00:06:20.843 --> 00:06:22.589
you this morning.
 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:26.069
Delighted to have the
opportunity to talk science to

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.889
some of America's brightest
budding young scientists,

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.884
but also dismayed that he asked
me to try and explain the

00:06:33.884 --> 00:06:36.740
molecular origin of optical
rotation,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.079
optical activity.
 

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:41.028
It's a very subtle,
difficult, delicate problem,

00:06:41.028 --> 00:06:44.478
that's exercised some of the
finest minds in physics and

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:47.050
chemistry for the last hundred
years.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.620
But anyway, let's see how it
goes.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.964
Towards the end I think I may
be presenting some stuff that's

00:06:52.964 --> 00:06:56.199
sort of beyond the boundaries of
your current knowledge.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.670
But anyway, it can at least
pass in front of your eyes.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.817
So chirality then means,
as you well know,

00:07:03.817 --> 00:07:06.649
right- or left-handedness.
 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.810
It pervades much of modern
science;

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.514
from the physics of elementary
particles, through organic

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:16.490
stereochemistry,
to the structure and behavior

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.819
of the molecules of life;
with a lot more besides.

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.687
It comes up in what's called
nonlinear optics,

00:07:23.687 --> 00:07:26.709
involving intense lasers;
nanotechnology;

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:28.250
materials, electrical
engineering;

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.935
pharmaceuticals;
astrobiology;

00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:32.879
and origin of life.
 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:38.190
So it's a very important theme
in modern science.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.250
Now first of all though I'll
tell you a little bit about Lord

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.860
Kelvin.
 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.776
He was the first person to
introduce the word

00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:47.899
chirality into science.
 

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:52.608
He was professor of natural
philosophy in Glasgow -- which

00:07:52.608 --> 00:07:57.069
is my home university -- through
most of his career;

00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:58.459
well all of his career.
 

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:01.906
He was one of the giants of
physics of the nineteenth

00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:02.569
century.
 

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:08.586
He's best known for inventing
the absolute Kelvin temperature

00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:09.389
scale.
 

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:13.134
Now he was originally,
his original name was William

00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:17.247
Thomson, but then he became
famous and became Sir William

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.129
Thomson.
 

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:22.209
Then he became even more
famous, so they made him a Lord.

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:25.641
And when you're made a Lord in
the U.K., you choose your title

00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:28.793
from someplace that's dear to
your heart, maybe your home

00:08:28.793 --> 00:08:29.300
area.
 

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.716
He took his title from the name
of the River Kelvin,

00:08:32.716 --> 00:08:36.200
which runs through the
University Park in Glasgow.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.450
So whenever you use the
absolute temperature scale now

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.025
in the future,
you can picture this idyllic

00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:42.639
scene.
 

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:45.868
Anyway, so he was the first to
introduce the word

00:08:45.868 --> 00:08:48.019
chirality into science.
 

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:50.932
And here's his definition,
which you'll be familiar with:

00:08:50.932 --> 00:08:53.691
"I call any geometrical
figure or group of points

00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:56.466
chiral,
and say that it has chirality

00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:59.317
if its image in a plane mirror,
ideally realized,

00:08:59.317 --> 00:09:01.918
cannot be brought into
coincidence with itself."

00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:04.129
That was in his Baltimore
Lectures.

00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:07.743
So he's just emphasizing the
non-superimposabity of the

00:09:07.743 --> 00:09:10.419
mirror image,
the enantiomers of a chiral

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:11.288
molecule.
 

00:09:11.288 --> 00:09:15.115
But of course the whole subject
started earlier with the

00:09:15.115 --> 00:09:19.957
wonderful work of Louis Pasteur,
who showed mirror-image chiral

00:09:19.957 --> 00:09:24.937
molecules show optical rotation
of equal magnitude but opposite

00:09:24.937 --> 00:09:28.080
sign;
which was an epoch-making

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.178
discovery.
 

00:09:29.178 --> 00:09:32.999
So you've come across then
this, the fundamental

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:37.062
manifestation of optical
activity, which is natural

00:09:37.062 --> 00:09:38.769
optical rotation.
 

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:43.120
You put linearly polarized
light beam into a sample --

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.840
say a sample of an isotropic
collection of chiral molecules,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.998
like a sugar solution -- and it
will come out the other side

00:09:50.998 --> 00:09:54.210
with the plane of polarization
rotated through some angle.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.681
And if you put in the mirror
image version,

00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:59.504
you'll get an equal but
opposite sense of optical

00:09:59.504 --> 00:10:00.269
rotation.
 

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:04.336
Now it's not to be confused
with something called magnetic

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:07.120
optical rotation,
the Faraday effect.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.788
I'm just mentioning this to you.
 

00:10:08.788 --> 00:10:12.120
You probably haven't come
across the Faraday effect yet,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.934
but you may do later on in your
studies, or in your professional

00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:16.480
life.
 

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.418
So I'll mention the Faraday
effect.

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:23.043
Faraday discovered,
in 1846, that achiral samples

00:10:23.043 --> 00:10:26.955
--
no natural optical activity

00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:30.221
there --
if you apply a static magnetic

00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:32.562
field,
parallel to the light beam,

00:10:32.562 --> 00:10:35.070
that will induce an optical
rotation.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.754
And if you put in -- if you
reverse the direction of the

00:10:38.754 --> 00:10:41.403
magnetic field,
relative to the light beam,

00:10:41.403 --> 00:10:43.967
you'll get an equal and
opposite sense of optical

00:10:43.967 --> 00:10:44.610
rotation.
 

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.255
It would even work say for a
sample of water,

00:10:48.255 --> 00:10:49.500
for instance.
 

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.418
Any material will show a
Faraday effect.

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:56.640
But this has been a source of
much confusion,

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.038
in fact, to scientists.
 

00:10:59.038 --> 00:11:02.500
Now Lord Kelvin was on the ball
here.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.549
He knew all about it.
 

00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:05.220
He made a statement here.
 

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.764
He said, "The magnetic
rotation has neither

00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:10.200
right-handed nor left-handed
quality."

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.336
(That is to say no chirality;
it's got nothing to do with

00:11:14.336 --> 00:11:15.139
chirality.)
 

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:17.764
"This was perfectly
understood by Faraday and made

00:11:17.764 --> 00:11:21.042
clear in his writings,
yet even to the present day we

00:11:21.042 --> 00:11:24.548
frequently find the chiral
rotation and the magnetic

00:11:24.548 --> 00:11:28.399
rotation of the plane of
polarization classed together in

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:32.592
a manner against which Faraday's
original description contains

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:34.450
ample warning."
 

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.590
Well Lord Kelvin would be
turning in his grave today,

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.796
100 years later,
because you still see papers

00:11:40.796 --> 00:11:43.418
which involve the Faraday
effect,

00:11:43.418 --> 00:11:46.278
in some way or other,
and in the introduction they

00:11:46.278 --> 00:11:49.485
talk grandly of "inducing
chirality with a magnetic

00:11:49.485 --> 00:11:50.419
field."
 

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:52.408
That is completely wrong.
 

00:11:52.408 --> 00:11:58.360
Just for the record -- probably
beyond your knowledge at the

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.399
moment --
chiral phenomena,

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:04.071
like natural optical rotation,
they're characterized by what's

00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:07.168
called time-even pseudoscalar
observables.

00:12:07.168 --> 00:12:12.075
A pseudoscalar is a number that
changes sign under reflection or

00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:14.919
inversion;
we'll leave it at that.

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:16.668
So that's for the record.
 

00:12:16.668 --> 00:12:20.144
But well it turns out the
essential symmetry

00:12:20.144 --> 00:12:24.912
characteristics of natural and
magnetic optical rotation are

00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:29.033
completely different and you
need different sorts of

00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:33.100
molecular quantum states,
different characteristics to

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.840
support them.
 

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.110
But we won't pursue that.
 

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:41.048
Right, now back to natural
optical rotation.

00:12:41.048 --> 00:12:46.720
So now we bring in circularly
polarized light.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.135
So in order to detect molecular
chirality, you must have some

00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:52.830
sort of chiral probe.
 

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:58.360
Well what we're using here is
right and left-circularly

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.820
polarized light beams.
 

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.028
They are actually mirror-image
chiral systems.

00:13:04.028 --> 00:13:07.250
So they can be used as chiral
probes.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.065
So here's a representation of a
right-circularly polarized light

00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:12.600
beam.
 

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.736
Now you know that light
involves electromagnetic

00:13:17.736 --> 00:13:22.870
oscillations in space,
and usually you just think of

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.009
the oscillating electric vector
of a light wave,

00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:30.928
and if it's linearly polarized,
it's oscillating in one plane.

00:13:30.928 --> 00:13:34.333
There's actually also an
oscillating magnetic field

00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:38.080
vector that oscillates
perpendicular to the electric.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.570
We'll come back to that later.
 

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.452
We're just looking at the
oscillating electric vector

00:13:42.452 --> 00:13:42.840
here.
 

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.844
So if it's linearly polarized,
or plane polarized,

00:13:45.844 --> 00:13:47.990
it's just oscillating in a
plane;

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:52.686
but circularly polarized light,
as well as an oscillation in

00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:54.038
this direction.
 

00:13:54.038 --> 00:13:59.304
You also have an electric
vector oscillating perpendicular

00:13:59.304 --> 00:14:01.798
but 90° out of phase.
 

00:14:01.798 --> 00:14:09.090
And what happens is you get
this circular polarization.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.899
Now this picture here,
this represents the

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:16.220
instantaneous electric vectors
at different points in space,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.678
in the direction of
propagation, along the z

00:14:19.678 --> 00:14:20.509
direction.
 

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:23.994
And so here we are,
that's just showing -- that's

00:14:23.994 --> 00:14:28.639
just connected the ends of the
instantaneous electric vectors.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:31.769
And there it is for
left-circularly polarized.

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:35.817
Anyway, you can see that at the
very least those are chiral,

00:14:35.817 --> 00:14:38.836
those are helical,
and those are mirror-image

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.139
chiral systems.
 

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:43.038
Now here we go.
 

00:14:43.038 --> 00:14:46.787
This is some extra fancy stuff
that Professor McBride added to

00:14:46.787 --> 00:14:48.446
my &gt;
 

00:14:48.446 --> 00:14:49.428
presentation.
 

00:14:49.428 --> 00:14:52.710
He doesn't like -- it was too
simple and static.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.279
Anyway, so there we are.
 

00:14:55.279 --> 00:15:00.692
So now if you look at the wave,
if you just look at the

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:04.500
electric vector through --
in a fixed plane,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.558
as the light wave is
propagating,

00:15:06.558 --> 00:15:10.883
there's the electric vector,
and it will rotate in the fixed

00:15:10.883 --> 00:15:11.470
plane.
 

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.802
So rotating clockwise,
that defines right-circularly

00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:15.980
polarized light.
 

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:23.899
And here we go,
rotating counter-clockwise;

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:26.240
that's left-circularly
polarized light.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.599
Okay, so we now have a chiral
optical probe,

00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:33.538
circularly polarized light.
 

00:15:33.538 --> 00:15:37.192
Now chiral molecules respond
slightly differently to right

00:15:37.192 --> 00:15:39.629
and left-circularly polarized
light.

00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:45.320
I mean, an extreme example is
say in the world of engineering.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:51.298
You can't fit a left-handed nut
onto a right-handed bolt.

00:15:51.298 --> 00:15:58.019
That's an extreme example of
different chiral interactions.

00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:01.519
Well it's obviously much more
delicate than that here.

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:05.235
But the point is right and
left-circularly polarized light

00:16:05.235 --> 00:16:08.755
interact just slightly
differently with a molecule of a

00:16:08.755 --> 00:16:10.058
given chirality.
 

00:16:10.058 --> 00:16:13.666
Anyway, there's a differential
absorption of right and

00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:15.980
left-circularly polarized light.
 

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.057
That corresponds to a
phenomenon called circular

00:16:19.057 --> 00:16:22.527
dichroism, which is the basis of
a widely used form of

00:16:22.527 --> 00:16:25.668
spectroscopy used to study
chiral molecules.

00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:30.347
But now, what gives rise to
optical rotation is a difference

00:16:30.347 --> 00:16:34.947
in refractive index towards --
of right and left-circularly

00:16:34.947 --> 00:16:37.009
polarized light beams.
 

00:16:42.808 --> 00:16:46.195
Now linearly polarized light,
you can describe it as a

00:16:46.195 --> 00:16:50.027
coherent superposition of right
and left-circularly polarized

00:16:50.027 --> 00:16:51.879
waves of equal amplitude.
 

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:54.928
Coherent means they're in-phase
with each other.

00:16:54.928 --> 00:16:58.962
Rather than being random,
they're oscillating in-phase

00:16:58.962 --> 00:17:01.778
with some fixed phase
relationship.

00:17:01.778 --> 00:17:06.384
So, for example,
now here's a linearly polarized

00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:07.660
light beam.
 

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.895
But you can decompose it into a
superposition of a left-circular

00:17:12.895 --> 00:17:15.640
and a right-circular component.
 

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.957
You see when those are at the
top they're reinforcing,

00:17:19.957 --> 00:17:24.355
and you've got the maximum
linearly polarized vector up

00:17:24.355 --> 00:17:25.088
here.
 

00:17:25.088 --> 00:17:27.287
As they come away,
left and right,

00:17:27.287 --> 00:17:31.548
they will tend to increasingly
cancel, and that will decrease.

00:17:31.548 --> 00:17:35.682
And when they're this way and
this way, you'll have zero

00:17:35.682 --> 00:17:39.892
electric field vector there,
and as you come down it will

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.318
increase again.
 

00:17:41.318 --> 00:17:46.935
So you can decompose a linearly
polarized light into a coherent

00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:50.558
superposition of left and right
waves.

00:17:50.558 --> 00:17:57.789
Now, refractive index
corresponds to velocity through

00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:59.318
a medium.
 

00:17:59.318 --> 00:18:03.892
So if there's a difference in
refractive index for right and

00:18:03.892 --> 00:18:07.068
left-circularly polarized light
beams,

00:18:07.068 --> 00:18:10.085
that means there's a slight
difference in the velocity of

00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:13.101
the right and left-circularly
polarized light beams going

00:18:13.101 --> 00:18:14.338
through the medium.
 

00:18:14.338 --> 00:18:18.477
So the phase relations between
the two contrarotating electric

00:18:18.477 --> 00:18:19.970
vectors will change.
 

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.678
And you can easily see,
this will give you a rotation

00:18:23.678 --> 00:18:25.890
in the plane of polarization.
 

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.480
You see, if there's a
difference in velocity,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.078
then at some instant this
vector, this electric vectors of

00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:36.150
the left component will be here,
and the right component here.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:41.137
And if you take the resultant,
you see, it's no longer where

00:18:41.137 --> 00:18:41.900
it was.
 

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.457
So this is a simple picture of
how optical rotation develops,

00:18:46.457 --> 00:18:50.406
in terms of different
refractive indices of the right

00:18:50.406 --> 00:18:52.230
and left components.
 

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.982
Now there's a picture in
Atkins' Physical

00:18:55.982 --> 00:18:57.380
Chemistry.
 

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.519
He tries to illustrate this
there.

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:01.670
He's got the linearly polarized
beam coming through,

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.959
and you've got the -- he's
broken it down into the left and

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:06.907
right,
and he's saying the two

00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:09.160
velocities are slightly
different,

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.000
and that gives you the
resultant optical rotation.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.978
You can easily develop an
expression for the angle of

00:19:15.978 --> 00:19:20.644
rotation as a function of the
difference in refractive indices

00:19:20.644 --> 00:19:24.930
for left and right-circularly
polarized light beams.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.288
And it's also -- it's a
function of the path length.

00:19:27.288 --> 00:19:31.625
Obviously the longer the path
length, the more rotation will

00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:32.358
develop.
 

00:19:32.358 --> 00:19:37.000
And there's the wavelength
there in the denominator.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.390
In fact, I mean,
this is the secret;

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.861
this path length,
that's the secret of how you

00:19:41.861 --> 00:19:43.400
get a measurable rotation.
 

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.130
Because this is an incredibly
tiny effect.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.123
If it was just a single
molecule event you're looking

00:19:49.123 --> 00:19:52.288
at, the polarization changes,
you wouldn't see anything,

00:19:52.288 --> 00:19:53.440
they're so tiny.
 

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.615
But you can build up this
rotation over long path lengths,

00:19:57.615 --> 00:19:59.740
centimeters or even meters.
 

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:05.980
In fact, if you go to Google,
Google Images,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.747
and just Google 'circularly
polarized light,' you'll find

00:20:09.747 --> 00:20:13.380
lots of sites there which
describe polarized light,

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.160
and they provide beautiful
simulations,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.640
animations of this effect here.
 

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.582
I didn't want to download any
and try and show them here,

00:20:24.582 --> 00:20:27.538
but I would encourage you to go
to that.

00:20:27.538 --> 00:20:31.737
But go and look in particular
at this site here,

00:20:31.737 --> 00:20:32.720
enzim.hu.
 

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.250
That comes from an institute of
enzymology in Budapest.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.105
They've got some beautiful
simulations of this optical

00:20:41.105 --> 00:20:45.690
rotation process and other more
exotic polarization effects,

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.690
as light propagates through
matter.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:54.559
Now, let's try and -- so that's
just, what would you say,

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:58.019
a phenomenological description.
 

00:20:58.019 --> 00:21:01.929
And in fact that's where most
physical chemistry textbooks

00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:02.410
stop.
 

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.222
And in fact Atkins' Physical
Chemistry stops at that

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:07.959
point,
and then just there's just sort

00:21:07.959 --> 00:21:11.578
of hand waving saying okay,
right and left-circularly

00:21:11.578 --> 00:21:14.752
polarized light interacts
slightly differently with the

00:21:14.752 --> 00:21:17.318
chiral molecule;
and they leave it at that.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:20.962
They don't attempt to try and
give you a picture in molecular

00:21:20.962 --> 00:21:21.509
detail.
 

00:21:21.509 --> 00:21:26.180
But Professor McBride wanted me
to try and attempt this.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.971
So just as a start,
this is a simple picture,

00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:34.279
a simple scattering picture of
optical rotation.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:39.075
Now a circularly polarized
light wave 'bouncing' from one

00:21:39.075 --> 00:21:43.125
group to the other,
as it scatters from a simple

00:21:43.125 --> 00:21:47.269
two-group chiral structure,
will sample the chirality.

00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:50.923
So here we have a simple
two-group chiral molecular

00:21:50.923 --> 00:21:51.798
structure.
 

00:21:51.798 --> 00:21:54.824
So we've got two achiral
groups, held in a rigid,

00:21:54.824 --> 00:21:56.210
twisted arrangement.
 

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.078
I think that's left-handed I've
got there.

00:21:59.078 --> 00:22:02.212
And you can break down -- if
you look at most chiral

00:22:02.212 --> 00:22:05.777
molecules, just look at the
bonds, you can often break them

00:22:05.777 --> 00:22:06.328
down.
 

00:22:06.328 --> 00:22:12.078
You can see these sorts of
two-group structures throughout.

00:22:12.078 --> 00:22:18.549
Anyway, so a particular model
of optical rotation is that the

00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:21.642
light wave,
it bounces from one group to

00:22:21.642 --> 00:22:24.438
the other,
before coming off and getting

00:22:24.438 --> 00:22:28.528
involved in generating the
optical rotation phenomenon.

00:22:28.528 --> 00:22:31.846
But you can see,
it's sampling the chirality as

00:22:31.846 --> 00:22:34.368
it bounces from one to the
other.

00:22:34.368 --> 00:22:38.048
So if the light beam is
right-circularly polarized,

00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:42.990
that bouncing process will have
a slightly different amplitude,

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.420
as we say, from if it's
left-circularly polarized.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.568
So that gives you a simple
picture.

00:22:48.568 --> 00:22:52.615
It's worth mentioning that this
is the basis of something called

00:22:52.615 --> 00:22:56.278
the "dynamic coupling model
of optical activity"

00:22:56.278 --> 00:22:59.940
that was developed by somebody
called John Kirkwood,

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.588
who was chairman of this
department in the 1950s.

00:23:03.588 --> 00:23:09.557
Well now we really have to
&gt;

00:23:09.557 --> 00:23:14.690
, we have to grasp the nettle
at this point,

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:20.895
because you just -- it's
hopeless messing around with

00:23:20.895 --> 00:23:24.000
these simple models.
 

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.078
&gt;
 

00:23:25.078 --> 00:23:29.509
They don't get you anywhere as
regards prediction;

00:23:29.509 --> 00:23:35.542
you know, relating structure to
sign and magnitude of optical

00:23:35.542 --> 00:23:36.650
activity.
 

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.769
You have to go to the
quantum-mechanics.

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:42.114
So now this was the expression
for the optical rotation,

00:23:42.114 --> 00:23:45.459
in terms of the refractive
index difference for left and

00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:47.710
right-circularly polarized
light.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.363
Now you can develop this using
something called

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:54.700
quantum-mechanical perturbation
theory,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:00.016
and you develop an expression
for the rotation angle in terms

00:24:00.016 --> 00:24:03.650
of this incomprehensible looking
stuff.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:09.528
But let me just try and give
you a feel for what it's telling

00:24:09.528 --> 00:24:10.019
us.
 

00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:14.798
The heart of it is this
so-called rotational strength,

00:24:14.798 --> 00:24:19.391
which involves this so-called
scalar product of an electric

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:23.269
dipole and a magnetic dipole
transition moment.

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:27.165
So what we've got here is
there's the ground state of the

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:30.087
molecule n;
j is some excited

00:24:30.087 --> 00:24:33.548
electronic state;
and μ is the electric

00:24:33.548 --> 00:24:36.772
dipole operator that's
connecting the ground to the

00:24:36.772 --> 00:24:37.868
excited state.
 

00:24:37.868 --> 00:24:41.455
And the light wave is
interacting, is coupling with

00:24:41.455 --> 00:24:45.042
this electric dipole operator,
and it's driving the

00:24:45.042 --> 00:24:46.118
transition.
 

00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:49.453
And it's this -- these electric
dipole transitions,

00:24:49.453 --> 00:24:52.990
like this, that's behind
conventional spectroscopy.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:57.598
You've done probably UV and
infrared spectroscopy.

00:24:57.598 --> 00:25:02.107
But now what we have in
addition is the same transition,

00:25:02.107 --> 00:25:05.470
but now brought about through
m;

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.713
that's called a magnetic dipole
operator, and that's activated

00:25:09.713 --> 00:25:13.818
by this oscillating magnetic
component of the light wave.

00:25:13.818 --> 00:25:19.420
And so you have this so-called
scalar product.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.660
So μ•m,
that would be μ_xm_x +

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.990
μ_ym_y + μ_zn_z.
 

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.109
Some of you have probably done
vectors.

00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:30.690
Maybe others haven't.
 

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:31.970
But okay.
 

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.848
So that's the heart of it.
 

00:25:33.848 --> 00:25:36.588
But this is a very important
feature here.

00:25:36.588 --> 00:25:39.837
We're summing over all excited
states, j,

00:25:39.837 --> 00:25:41.288
all excited states.
 

00:25:41.288 --> 00:25:45.843
So the whole plethora of
excited states of a chiral

00:25:45.843 --> 00:25:49.915
molecule come in here,
and some can give you -- one

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:53.767
particular excited state can
give you a positive contribution

00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:56.710
to the optical rotation;
another one a negative.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:57.618
You know?
 

00:25:57.618 --> 00:26:02.551
So it's a very subtle problem,
and you have to consider them

00:26:02.551 --> 00:26:03.890
all carefully.
 

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:08.145
So optical activity ultimately
originates in interference

00:26:08.145 --> 00:26:12.555
between electric and magnetic
dipole transitions during the

00:26:12.555 --> 00:26:14.759
light scattering process.
 

00:26:14.759 --> 00:26:17.160
That's at the heart of it.
 

00:26:20.509 --> 00:26:23.818
Now, let me just show you how
this works out.

00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:28.053
I can now give you a chemical,
an interpretation,

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:32.991
in terms of a real and highly
important system in organic

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:36.519
chemistry: the carbonyl
chromophore.

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:39.440
I believe you have come across
the carbonyl chromophore.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.269
A lot of important organic
molecules contain this carbonyl

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:44.210
chromophore.
 

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:49.952
It gives rise to a transition
in the near ultraviolet at about

00:26:49.952 --> 00:26:53.530
290 nanometers,
and it's widely used in

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.450
physical organic chemistry.
 

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:02.210
It's called the n to
π* transition.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:07.076
Now the carbonyl group itself
-- here it is -- that's not

00:27:07.076 --> 00:27:10.640
chiral, that's got a plane of
symmetry.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.348
So by itself it's not going --
there's going to be no optical

00:27:14.348 --> 00:27:15.400
activity there.
 

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.546
But you see,
in this particular molecule

00:27:18.546 --> 00:27:22.741
here, 3-methylcyclohexanone,
that molecule overall is

00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:23.630
chiral.
 

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.440
There's a chiral center there.
 

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.795
So that carbonyl group is
experiencing a chiral

00:27:29.795 --> 00:27:32.846
perturbation,
a through space perturbation

00:27:32.846 --> 00:27:34.990
from the rest of the chiral
molecule,

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.635
and that induces chirality into
the electronic transitions of

00:27:39.635 --> 00:27:43.698
the carbonyl group,
and induces optical rotation

00:27:43.698 --> 00:27:45.720
and circular dichroism.
 

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.836
Well let's look at this in a
bit more detail,

00:27:48.836 --> 00:27:52.380
this famous n to
π* transition.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.472
So here we've got the
σ bonding orbital

00:27:56.472 --> 00:27:58.400
of the carbonyl group.
 

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.752
There's the π bonding
orbital, made up of two -- of

00:28:03.752 --> 00:28:07.588
the pπ on carbon and
on oxygen.

00:28:07.588 --> 00:28:14.869
And here is a lone -- sorry,
here is a py orbital.

00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:17.078
So those are px orbitals.
 

00:28:17.078 --> 00:28:20.368
That's the py orbital on
the oxygen.

00:28:20.368 --> 00:28:22.949
Feed electrons in,
and so you've got,

00:28:22.949 --> 00:28:25.885
in the ground state,
you've got two there,

00:28:25.885 --> 00:28:26.890
two there.
 

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.420
And you've got two electrons in
the py orbital.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.380
So those are lone-pair
electrons.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.025
So the lowest order,
the lowest transition now is

00:28:36.025 --> 00:28:40.662
the py to π*,
often called the n to

00:28:40.662 --> 00:28:41.950
π* transition.
 

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.636
You're promoting one electron
from the py orbital up to

00:28:45.636 --> 00:28:51.287
the π* orbital;
and that's the origin of this

00:28:51.287 --> 00:28:52.950
transition.
 

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:58.618
Well let's -- ah now.
 

00:28:58.618 --> 00:29:03.170
Okay, now this transition,
it happens to be fully magnetic

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.798
dipole-allowed but completely
electric dipole-forbidden.

00:29:07.798 --> 00:29:13.570
What happens is electric dipole
character is induced by mixing

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.099
--
well I'm giving the example of

00:29:16.099 --> 00:29:19.898
a higher oxygen dyz_
orbital into the

00:29:19.898 --> 00:29:21.618
π* orbital.
 

00:29:21.618 --> 00:29:25.411
Now Professor McBride has been
messing around with my

00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:26.869
presentation here.
 

00:29:26.869 --> 00:29:28.259
Let's see what he's done.
 

00:29:28.259 --> 00:29:35.432
So here's the n orbital,
the py orbital of the

00:29:35.432 --> 00:29:37.500
carbonyl group.
 

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.309
There's the π*.
 

00:29:40.309 --> 00:29:43.640
Ah, now here we go.
 

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:49.750
So this is now -- but wait --
yeah,

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.740
so here you can see,
in that n to

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.836
π* transition,
there's a net rotation of

00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:59.269
charge, a rotation of charge.
 

00:29:59.269 --> 00:30:03.778
And that's the essence of the
magnetic dipole-allowed

00:30:03.778 --> 00:30:04.818
character.
 

00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:09.190
Magnetic dipole transitions
involve a rotation of charge.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.083
Prof: And the reason we
messed about with them in this

00:30:12.083 --> 00:30:14.880
way is we've seen the mixing
p orbitals changing the

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.670
orientation,
causing them to rotate that way.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.019
Prof: Right.
 

00:30:19.019 --> 00:30:24.319
So what's -- ah okay,
now here we go again.

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:27.230
Now here's a dyz orbital.
 

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.384
Now one could consider a whole
loads of other possible orbitals

00:30:31.384 --> 00:30:32.190
to mix in.
 

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.144
But this is the simplest one,
just to illustrate the idea

00:30:36.144 --> 00:30:36.640
here.
 

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.029
So there's a dyz orbital.
 

00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:45.890
Now going from -- you see
n to dyz,

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.318
if you add those orbitals
together,

00:30:49.318 --> 00:30:57.560
you tend to get a displacement
of charge in the z

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.358
direction.
 

00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:03.250
So now, you see,
you have a combination of a

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.595
rotation of charge with a
displacement of charge,

00:31:07.595 --> 00:31:12.029
and rotation plus translation
gives helicity.

00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:16.480
And here we go.
 

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.000
There.
 

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.256
So by mixing in a little bit of
this dxz orbital,

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:28.416
you get this -- which is
electric dipole-allowed -- you

00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:32.240
get this helicity in the
transition.

00:31:35.808 --> 00:31:39.807
Now, in fact,
the rotation of charge

00:31:39.807 --> 00:31:46.205
generates a magnetic dipole
perpendicular to the plane of

00:31:46.205 --> 00:31:50.890
rotation, and it's pointing that
way.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.020
So you'll get an m_z
component, a component of the

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.368
magnetic moment along the
z axis.

00:31:56.368 --> 00:31:59.375
Here you can see immediately
you've got a component of the

00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:01.588
electric dipole along the
z axis.

00:32:01.588 --> 00:32:04.923
So that generates a
μ_zm_z component,

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:08.692
from this scalar product of
μ and m,

00:32:08.692 --> 00:32:10.940
in the rotational strength.
 

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:17.858
So this is sort of making a
meal of it here now.

00:32:17.858 --> 00:32:20.882
So we're just putting down
these so-called

00:32:20.882 --> 00:32:23.608
quantum-mechanical matrix
elements.

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:26.171
So here we've got n to
π*,

00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:29.830
with a little bit of that mixed
in, and that's fully magnetic

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:30.990
dipole-allowed.
 

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.509
Then we have n to
π*,

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:36.480
which is forbidden electric
dipole,

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.161
but mixing that in gives you a
little bit of electric dipole

00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:40.910
character.
 

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.811
And so you now get a non-zero
contribution to the rotational

00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:45.538
strength.
 

00:32:45.538 --> 00:32:50.214
However, you wouldn't want to
go on and actually calculate the

00:32:50.214 --> 00:32:54.967
optical rotation of the carbonyl
chromophore, in some situation

00:32:54.967 --> 00:32:56.038
from this.
 

00:32:56.038 --> 00:32:58.865
Because, as I said,
there's many other excited

00:32:58.865 --> 00:33:02.130
electronic states you could have
also considered,

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:06.403
which may be giving opposite
contributions to the rotational

00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:07.200
strength.
 

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.594
You have to sum them all,
and to do that you now have to

00:33:12.594 --> 00:33:17.203
go to modern ab initio
quantum-chemistry,

00:33:17.203 --> 00:33:20.538
quantum-chemical calculations.
 

00:33:20.538 --> 00:33:25.348
There's wonderful programs out
now, from Gaussian and Dalton;

00:33:25.348 --> 00:33:29.237
you can calculate all sorts of
molecular properties,

00:33:29.237 --> 00:33:33.430
with quite good -- very good
accuracy, in many cases.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:37.348
But this now turns it all into
a black box procedure.

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:42.015
You just feed in appropriate
atomic orbitals and press

00:33:42.015 --> 00:33:45.953
buttons and turn handles,
whatever you do for these

00:33:45.953 --> 00:33:50.612
calculations,
and out will pop some physical

00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:51.868
quantity.
 

00:33:51.868 --> 00:33:56.273
So you can calculate this whole
thing, ab initio,

00:33:56.273 --> 00:34:00.678
and taking in however many
excited states in the sum are

00:34:00.678 --> 00:34:01.798
necessary.
 

00:34:01.798 --> 00:34:06.152
And you can calculate the sign
and magnitude of the optical

00:34:06.152 --> 00:34:09.679
rotation, for a given absolute
configuration.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:13.565
So you would feed into the
calculation whether it's the

00:34:13.565 --> 00:34:17.309
S or the R
absolute stereochemistry.

00:34:17.309 --> 00:34:20.103
So you'd put that in,
and that will determine the

00:34:20.103 --> 00:34:22.780
sign of the optical rotation
that comes out.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.619
And so -- I mean,
in this particular case,

00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:28.867
this small molecule,
the S absolute

00:34:28.867 --> 00:34:31.306
configuration,
goes with the plus rotation and

00:34:31.306 --> 00:34:32.960
the R goes with the
minus.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.923
So from the calculation then
you can relate the sign of the

00:34:37.923 --> 00:34:42.289
optical rotation to the absolute
stereochemistry.

00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:45.601
But you wouldn't want to stake
your life on it,

00:34:45.601 --> 00:34:48.409
because it's not completely
reliable.

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:52.237
It usually gives the right
answer, for smaller molecules,

00:34:52.237 --> 00:34:53.400
but not always.
 

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.976
And, for example,
if this was -- as you know,

00:34:57.976 --> 00:35:03.179
and I think you'll hear more
after my talk here.

00:35:03.179 --> 00:35:09.130
Many drugs now are chiral,
and drug companies like to

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:15.079
market now single enantiomer
versions of the drug.

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:19.047
So it's a tremendously
important problem for them to

00:35:19.047 --> 00:35:21.476
know,
with absolute certainty,

00:35:21.476 --> 00:35:25.543
the absolute configuration of
the particular enantiomer

00:35:25.543 --> 00:35:29.115
they're marketing,
because if they make a mistake

00:35:29.115 --> 00:35:33.139
and specify the wrong absolute
configuration in their patent,

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:36.110
they can literally lose
billions of dollars.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:42.375
Anyway, there's the famous --
the importance of chirality in

00:35:42.375 --> 00:35:48.110
drugs is exemplified by the
famous thalidomide case.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.420
But I won't elaborate that any
more.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:54.255
I think Professor McBride is
going to tell you some more of

00:35:54.255 --> 00:35:55.710
that in more detail.
 

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.472
I should say that the
cornerstone, the definitive

00:35:59.472 --> 00:36:03.630
method for determining absolute
configuration has,

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.278
for some years now,
been something called the

00:36:06.278 --> 00:36:09.170
Bijvoet method of anomalous
X-ray scattering,

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.280
which again Professor -- have
you told them about that?

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:12.949
Prof: Yes.
 

00:36:12.949 --> 00:36:13.619
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:14.550
Yeah, that's the definitive
method.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:19.213
But it's sort of cheating
because you're actually seeing

00:36:19.213 --> 00:36:22.690
-- you're seeing it through
X-ray eyes.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:25.237
But even then,
you can occasionally make a

00:36:25.237 --> 00:36:25.860
mistake.
 

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.436
But I should just mention also,
there are some newer optical

00:36:30.436 --> 00:36:34.860
activity techniques involving
something called vibrational

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.489
optical activity.
 

00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:39.413
Here we've been looking at
optical activity in electronic

00:36:39.413 --> 00:36:41.239
transitions, using visible
light.

00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:44.949
But in recent years newer
methods, measuring optical

00:36:44.949 --> 00:36:48.949
activity in vibrational
transitions, have come along.

00:36:48.949 --> 00:36:52.231
And these are actually
comparable with X-ray,

00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:56.257
anomalous X-ray scattering,
for reliability of absolute

00:36:56.257 --> 00:36:57.599
configuration.
 

00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:00.898
That's because these
calculations are much more

00:37:00.898 --> 00:37:05.275
reliable for these vibrational
optical activity phenomena than

00:37:05.275 --> 00:37:06.710
electronic ones.
 

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.179
Well that's about it.
 

00:37:08.179 --> 00:37:11.110
That's all I would like to say
now.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.670
So thank you for listening.
 

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:22.320
&gt;
 

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.376
Prof: Now that you've
heard from the authority,

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:27.510
do you have any questions about
it?

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:32.969
You are unwontedly quiet,
like you usually are.

00:37:32.969 --> 00:37:34.539
Any questions?
 

00:37:34.539 --> 00:37:38.309
Yes?
 

00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:42.407
Prof: I'm just wondering
if the magnitude of the Faraday

00:37:42.407 --> 00:37:46.239
rotation can ever interfere with
the measurement of optical

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:48.619
rotation in the chiral material?
 

00:37:48.619 --> 00:37:51.309
That is to say,
if one situates a polarimeter

00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:53.451
in proximity to an NMR
spectrometer,

00:37:53.451 --> 00:37:54.429
for example?
 

00:37:54.429 --> 00:37:55.309
Prof: No.
 

00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:58.429
No, you wouldn't need to worry
about that at all.

00:37:58.429 --> 00:37:59.030
No.
 

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:03.802
You need a reasonable strength
of magnetic fields just applied

00:38:03.802 --> 00:38:06.150
directly through the sample.
 

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.559
Yeah.
 

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.280
Prof: Lucas?
 

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.780
Student:  Just if I'm
understanding.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:20.210
The n to π* is
magnetically dipole-allowed,

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:23.887
electric dipole-forbidden,
and that's why then it goes to

00:38:23.887 --> 00:38:26.617
the xz as well,
in order to get the electric

00:38:26.617 --> 00:38:27.885
dipole…
Prof: The electric,

00:38:27.885 --> 00:38:28.010
yeah.
 

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.380
Student:  …in
there, that contribution.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.130
Prof: Yes.
 

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.449
Student:  For my
knowledge.

00:38:36.449 --> 00:38:38.480
&gt;
 

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.079
Prof: Okay,
thanks again Laurence.

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:42.050
Prof: My pleasure.
 

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.360
Prof: Very good.
 

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:52.110
&gt;
 

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:52.880
Prof: Thank you.
 

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.710
Laurence Barron:  Okay.
 

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:02.679
Prof: So yeah,
this is just a plug.

00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:05.969
This afternoon -- the reason
Professor Barron is here is he's

00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:08.820
the Tetelman lecturer in
Jonathan Edwards College.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.860
So he's giving a talk for the
history majors and so on.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.570
But it'll be very interesting
for anyone.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.824
And I think since we're into
chirality, you would enjoy this,

00:39:17.824 --> 00:39:21.079
particularly this afternoon,
in Davies Auditorium at 5:00.

00:39:21.079 --> 00:39:24.679
But there's the question,
who cares?

00:39:24.679 --> 00:39:26.849
No offense.
 

00:39:26.849 --> 00:39:28.820
But who cares?
 

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.530
Why do we care about chirality?
 

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.469
Well Professor Barron hinted at
it.

00:39:32.469 --> 00:39:35.230
Living things care,
because they're chiral.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.300
Right?
 

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.400
So which one they react with.
 

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.699
Okay?
 

00:39:38.699 --> 00:39:41.018
The Food and Drug
Administration cares,

00:39:41.018 --> 00:39:44.128
for the same reason,
with respect to medications you

00:39:44.128 --> 00:39:45.349
might be taking.
 

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:49.849
Drug companies care a lot,
and their lawyers.

00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:52.500
And the US Patent Office cares
a lot.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.150
Right?
 

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.815
Which has generated a thing
called a "chiral

00:39:56.815 --> 00:39:57.650
switch."
 

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:00.494
Most drugs that used to be
developed were developed as

00:40:00.494 --> 00:40:03.393
racemates, because it was
difficult to separate the two

00:40:03.393 --> 00:40:03.929
hands.
 

00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:07.369
But if your patent runs out on
the racemate,

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:11.579
and you can resolve it and now
sell just one of them,

00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:15.268
and if it's better,
and the FDA will approve it,

00:40:15.268 --> 00:40:18.231
and you can convince people
that that's the one they should

00:40:18.231 --> 00:40:19.978
buy,
then you can go back to not

00:40:19.978 --> 00:40:22.860
having to compete with generic
drug companies anymore and

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.949
charge five dollars a pill
instead of fifty cents a pill.

00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:27.369
Okay?
 

00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:30.882
So this so-called chiral
switch, to go from racemic to a

00:40:30.882 --> 00:40:33.949
single enantiomer,
is a big movement nowadays.

00:40:33.949 --> 00:40:36.760
For example,
consider this pain reliever.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.179
Let's figure out what it is.
 

00:40:38.179 --> 00:40:41.431
Do you remember what that group
is: four carbons,

00:40:41.431 --> 00:40:43.940
in that sort of Mercedes
structure?

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.630
Do you know what that group's
called?

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.583
This, what we're doing for the
rest of the lecture here out is

00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:54.239
actually review for the exam on
Friday.

00:40:54.239 --> 00:40:56.773
You're not specifically
responsible for it,

00:40:56.773 --> 00:40:57.860
but it's review.
 

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:59.190
So you know that group?
 

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.699
Student:  Isobutyl.
 

00:41:00.699 --> 00:41:01.768
Prof: Isobutyl.
 

00:41:01.768 --> 00:41:06.052
Okay, and what acid is that,
with three carbons,

00:41:06.052 --> 00:41:07.329
do you know?
 

00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:10.170
The first fatty acid?
 

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.349
Student:  Propionic.
 

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:12.750
Prof: Propionic acid.
 

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.639
And in the middle we have --
Student:  Phenol?

00:41:16.639 --> 00:41:18.510
Prof: Phenyl group.
 

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.409
Okay?
 

00:41:19.409 --> 00:41:26.019
So what's the name of the drug?
 

00:41:26.019 --> 00:41:29.329
Student:  Ibuprofen.
 

00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:30.190
Prof: Sherwin?
 

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.809
Student:  Ibuprofen.
 

00:41:31.809 --> 00:41:33.449
Prof: Ibu-pro-fen.
 

00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:34.960
Advil or Motrin.
 

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.739
Okay, now in this case you have
a chiral center there -- right?

00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:40.840
-- because there's a hydrogen
on there that we don't see.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.630
And the S-form is a pain
reliever;

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.219
it's said to be so anyhow.
 

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:46.550
And the R is inactive.
 

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.550
Right?
 

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.570
But it's marketed as a racemate.
 

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:50.619
Right?
 

00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:53.927
One might try doing a chiral
switch and selling only the

00:41:53.927 --> 00:41:54.590
S.
 

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:58.429
But the trouble is that it very
quickly racemizes inside you.

00:41:58.429 --> 00:42:00.539
So it wouldn't be doing any
good, right?

00:42:00.539 --> 00:42:03.297
Because you'd do all the work
of selling the S and then

00:42:03.297 --> 00:42:05.829
it would become R
immediately, when you ate it.

00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:06.570
And here's another one.
 

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.702
This is the one that Professor
Barron referred to,

00:42:08.702 --> 00:42:10.960
which is a sedative;
thalidomide.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.387
And there's the chiral center
in that one, because there's an

00:42:14.387 --> 00:42:15.130
H on there.
 

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.592
So the S-form is a
sedative, but the R-form,

00:42:18.592 --> 00:42:20.840
at least it's said,
is a teratogen;

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.409
which means it makes monsters.
 

00:42:23.409 --> 00:42:24.860
&gt;
 

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.922
And it's not so funny,
because it was sold as a

00:42:27.922 --> 00:42:30.920
racemate from 1957 to '62 --
never in the U.S.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.849
because the FDA didn't -- they
were lucky and never approved

00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:35.449
it.
 

00:42:35.449 --> 00:42:38.150
But in Europe it caused 10,000
birth defects;

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:41.519
children born without arms,
legs, things like that.

00:42:41.519 --> 00:42:42.809
So it was a tragedy.
 

00:42:42.809 --> 00:42:47.429
But this one also undergoes
in vivo racemization.

00:42:47.429 --> 00:42:48.739
Okay?
 

00:42:48.739 --> 00:42:51.690
You can find rate constants for
these.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.188
It's curious that the rate of
S going to R,

00:42:54.188 --> 00:42:57.000
and the rate of R going
to S, are not the same.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.150
There's got to be more to it
than that, that one has to be

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.079
more stable than the other,
of these mirror images;

00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:03.889
if that's true.
 

00:43:03.889 --> 00:43:06.050
It may be that the rates aren't
exactly true.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.719
But if so, they must be bound
to something that makes --

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:11.583
that's chiral -- that makes one
of them more stable than the

00:43:11.583 --> 00:43:12.070
other.
 

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.409
Anyhow, that's how fast they go
back and forth.

00:43:14.409 --> 00:43:17.489
And this is how fast they get
eliminated from the body;

00:43:17.489 --> 00:43:20.230
one gets eliminated much faster
than the other.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.063
And if you put these things
together, you can see how the

00:43:23.063 --> 00:43:26.201
concentration should vary with
time, if it's going according to

00:43:26.201 --> 00:43:26.909
that rate.
 

00:43:26.909 --> 00:43:29.398
So the blue one,
the one that's good for you,

00:43:29.398 --> 00:43:30.530
quickly drops off.
 

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.356
The bad one,
the teratogen,

00:43:32.356 --> 00:43:33.480
grows quickly.
 

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.905
So you have maybe two hours of
twenty-four hours where you got

00:43:36.905 --> 00:43:39.489
a lot more of the good one than
the bad one.

00:43:39.489 --> 00:43:43.188
So essentially this drug is
completely off-limits,

00:43:43.188 --> 00:43:46.735
especially for any women that
could conceivably,

00:43:46.735 --> 00:43:49.829
under any circumstances,
be pregnant.

00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:50.420
Okay?
 

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.360
So but it's a wonderful drug
for things like leprosy and so

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:54.699
on.
 

00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:57.775
David here is an MD,
as well as a professor of

00:43:57.775 --> 00:44:01.260
chemistry, and you probably know
more about that.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.849
But it's a wonderful drug for
certain things.

00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:03.559
Isn't that right?
 

00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:04.360
Prof: That's right,
that's right.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.630
It's still actually in common
usage for anxiety disorders.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:08.690
Prof: Yeah,
but there are all sorts of

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.235
warnings,
in letters this big,

00:44:10.235 --> 00:44:13.309
about if you have a chance of
getting pregnant,

00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:14.599
stay away from this baby.
 

00:44:14.599 --> 00:44:15.039
Right?
 

00:44:15.039 --> 00:44:17.496
Prof: In fact,
if you're a male patient taking

00:44:17.496 --> 00:44:19.409
it,
and your wife is pregnant or

00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:22.384
likely to become pregnant,
you're encouraged not to take

00:44:22.384 --> 00:44:22.570
it.
 

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.380
Prof: Wow.
 

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.780
Prof: Because of
possible contamination.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.750
Prof: Wow.
 

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.760
Okay, so now here's a drug.
 

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.059
We're going to look at the name
of this one.

00:44:30.059 --> 00:44:32.409
It's a really whopper of a
name, right?

00:44:32.409 --> 00:44:35.829
So let's just use this as a
practice about nomenclature.

00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:39.340
Okay, so that thing there is
called imidazole,

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.943
and the 1H tells where
-- which one has a hydrogen on

00:44:43.943 --> 00:44:44.489
it.
 

00:44:44.489 --> 00:44:44.936
Right?
 

00:44:44.936 --> 00:44:47.170
Okay, so that's position one.
 

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.860
And that is the benzene ring;
so benz.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.650
So it's benzimidazole,
that group on the right.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:53.929
And you number it.
 

00:44:53.929 --> 00:44:56.585
Remember it was 1H;
there's an H on the nitrogen

00:44:56.585 --> 00:44:57.150
one there.
 

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.119
And you go around the ring and
number in that conventional way.

00:45:00.119 --> 00:45:03.987
Okay, now but then you notice
that there's something on the

00:45:03.987 --> 00:45:07.389
number five, and there's
something on the number two

00:45:07.389 --> 00:45:08.989
carbon of that ring.
 

00:45:08.989 --> 00:45:12.786
On five, there's a methoxy
group, which appears first among

00:45:12.786 --> 00:45:15.340
all the things in this -- named
here;

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.719
not the thing that's on two.
 

00:45:16.719 --> 00:45:19.590
Why is the methoxy group first?
 

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.860
Do you remember what the rule
is?

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.679
Student:
&gt;.

00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:28.300
Prof: How do you arrange
the substituent groups?

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.820
Angela?
 

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.769
Student:  Alphabetically.
 

00:45:32.769 --> 00:45:34.940
Prof: Alphabetically;
m is going to be the first one.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:39.230
Okay, so 5-methoxy,
and then two is sulfinyl;

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:42.130
that S with an O on it is
called sulfinyl group.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:43.789
Okay, so it's 2-sulfinyl.
 

00:45:43.789 --> 00:45:46.695
But now there are all sorts of
curly brackets and square

00:45:46.695 --> 00:45:49.074
brackets and so on,
to tell what's attached to

00:45:49.074 --> 00:45:49.550
that.
 

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.010
Okay, so attached to that is
methyl group;

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.880
the methyl is substituted.
 

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.389
So it's methyl sulfinyl.
 

00:45:56.389 --> 00:45:59.840
Okay, that's the curly -- the
square brackets.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.380
Okay, now what's on the methyl?
 

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.539
There's a pyridine group;
the benzene with a nitrogen,

00:46:04.539 --> 00:46:05.210
is pyridine.
 

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:08.820
And it's substituted on the
methyl at its own two position;

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.195
the two position of the
pyridine is what's attached to

00:46:11.195 --> 00:46:11.780
the methyl.
 

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:16.530
So it's 2-pyridinyl, the end.
 

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:18.690
But now on that,
in the four position,

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:19.449
is methoxy.
 

00:46:19.449 --> 00:46:22.750
And methoxy comes
alphabetically before methyl;

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:24.733
not before d,
but before methyl,

00:46:24.733 --> 00:46:26.590
and you don't count the di.
 

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:27.510
Right?
 

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.010
So there's the name of that
compound.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.750
And this stuff is a drug.
 

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.099
It's a gastric proton pump
inhibitor.

00:46:33.099 --> 00:46:35.849
So it treats acid reflux
disease.

00:46:35.849 --> 00:46:39.530
And it's the world's largest
selling drug in the Year 2000;

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.079
6.2 billion dollars.
 

00:46:41.079 --> 00:46:44.880
And it's called omeprazole,
or Prilosec.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.838
And you've seen probably,
some of you at least,

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.768
have seen boxes of Prilosec.
 

00:46:49.768 --> 00:46:52.679
I hope you don't have to take
it, like I do occasionally.

00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:55.170
This is called OTC.
 

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.840
We're going to be talking about
that on Monday.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.170
Okay, so there it is.
 

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:00.610
Now get your glasses up.
 

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.320
Because can you see this?
 

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.320
Can you see any sort of
three-dimensions here?

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.219
What's in front,
or what's behind?

00:47:14.219 --> 00:47:17.909
Can anybody tell?
 

00:47:17.909 --> 00:47:20.030
You have any luck in seeing it
in three-dimensions?

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.059
Some people can't see it,
but most of you,

00:47:22.059 --> 00:47:24.139
about 95% of you,
should be able to see.

00:47:24.139 --> 00:47:27.170
It's not a really high quality
three-dimensions.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:31.567
And because the computer -- the
projector doesn't do it exactly

00:47:31.567 --> 00:47:33.268
right, for the colors.
 

00:47:33.268 --> 00:47:35.949
So one eye sees only one and
one sees only the other.

00:47:35.949 --> 00:47:37.130
Anybody see?
 

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.760
Okay, now what is chiral here?
 

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.650
Can you see why this thing is
chiral?

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.650
There's no carbon with four
different things on it.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.730
But what makes it handed?
 

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.000
Can you see?
 

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.769
In fact, there's no group that
has four different things on it.

00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:56.909
Any suggestions?
 

00:47:56.909 --> 00:47:57.860
Lucas?
 

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:58.530
Student:  Sulfur.
 

00:47:58.530 --> 00:47:59.539
Prof: Sulfur.
 

00:47:59.539 --> 00:48:03.373
Sulfur has an unshared pair,
an oxygen, and two different R

00:48:03.373 --> 00:48:03.969
groups.
 

00:48:03.969 --> 00:48:06.440
And which is pointing out
toward you?

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.429
Can you see it enough in
three-dimensions,

00:48:08.429 --> 00:48:09.838
with the glasses,
to see that,

00:48:09.838 --> 00:48:11.440
to see which is pointing out?
 

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.659
Student:  The unshared
pair.

00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:14.570
Prof: Yeah,
it's the unshared pair that's

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:15.179
pointing out.
 

00:48:15.179 --> 00:48:18.965
So if you use your thumbs and
recognize that the unshared pair

00:48:18.965 --> 00:48:21.820
has the lowest atomic number --
zero, right?

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.989
-- then you can do it.
 

00:48:22.989 --> 00:48:25.592
And you'll find out that that
particular one drawn there is

00:48:25.592 --> 00:48:26.760
the S enantiomer.
 

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.000
Okay?
 

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.077
So it's known -- omeprazole,
Prilosec, Prilosec OTC,

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:34.969
are the racemate.
 

00:48:34.969 --> 00:48:39.945
But this one that's drawn here
is the S isomer,

00:48:39.945 --> 00:48:41.916
and it's called what?
 

00:48:41.916 --> 00:48:45.150
Esomeprazole;
that's the name of it, right?

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.239
Or Nexium.
 

00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:48.730
Right?
 

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.210
And it's the S isomer,
right?

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:53.750
So this is the product of one
of these chiral switches,

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:57.420
where for a long time the stuff
was marketed as a racemate and

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.550
now they market it as a single
enantiomer, Nexium.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.108
And we tried this one last
time, so we're not going to

00:49:03.108 --> 00:49:04.510
spend time on it right now.
 

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.690
That's what the class looks
like when they're doing this.

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:09.159
It's fun for me to see you.
 

00:49:09.159 --> 00:49:09.960
&gt;
 

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.980
Okay?
 

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.230
But there are other ways of
doing the stereoviewing.

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:16.139
You can use a pair of
periscopes, like this.

00:49:16.139 --> 00:49:17.400
Right?
 

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.215
And the way that works of
course -- well the point is,

00:49:20.215 --> 00:49:22.340
for each eye to see a different
image.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.983
So if you want to try those and
look at this after class,

00:49:24.983 --> 00:49:25.550
feel free.
 

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:26.760
Or borrow them if you wish.
 

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.510
Right?
 

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:31.300
So what the eyes perceive is a
superposition in the middle.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:31.849
It's like this.
 

00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:33.659
There are two pictures.
 

00:49:33.659 --> 00:49:36.251
But if you can do it with the
glasses, you can do it probably

00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:38.929
just by looking at this picture,
if you have a little while.

00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:40.300
But we don't have the little
while now.

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.018
The right eye will see that,
the left eye will see that,

00:49:43.018 --> 00:49:44.909
and you see,
in the middle -- there see,

00:49:44.909 --> 00:49:48.025
something in the same position
but in slightly different

00:49:48.025 --> 00:49:48.820
projections.
 

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.630
So the image in the middle of
the three seems to be in 3-D.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:55.500
Okay.
 

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:59.867
Now we don't have time to go --
we're going to do a lot of

00:49:59.867 --> 00:50:03.543
curved arrow stuff,
about how reactions happen in

00:50:03.543 --> 00:50:06.436
making omeprazole;
and then, even more

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:09.864
interesting, in the action of
omeprazole that stops the

00:50:09.864 --> 00:50:10.880
stomach acid.
 

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.340
But we'll have to wait 'til
after the exam for that.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.650
Okay?
 

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.949
Thanks again to Professor
Barron.

00:50:14.949 --> 00:50:16.699

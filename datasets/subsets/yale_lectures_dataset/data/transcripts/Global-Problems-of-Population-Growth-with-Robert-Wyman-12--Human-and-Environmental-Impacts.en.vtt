00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.095
Prof: Okay,
we are now at the part of the

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.637
course--
we're coming up to fairly

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:14.350
modern times,
it's been a very breathless run

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.248
from six million years of
chimpanzee evolution through

00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:20.777
many--
few million years of human

00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:24.282
evolution,
and we're coming up to more or

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:28.388
less the 1960s,
which is the period of the

00:00:28.388 --> 00:00:34.810
greatest percentage increase in
human population on earth ever.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.215
So this is the peak of what's
called the population explosion

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:43.621
and we're going to be talking
about that until almost the end

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:45.090
of the term now.
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.743
I have to tell you a little
bit, truth in teaching or

00:00:52.743 --> 00:00:54.510
something.
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.540
How I got interested in this
topic.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.289
When I was just a little bit
older then you are now,

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.209
I did the fairly usual thing of
going--

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.299
putting on my short pants and
going around the world,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.007
around Asia anyway,
with almost no money in my

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:15.950
pocket.
 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.805
You all, if you have never done
that, you should do it

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.879
definitely, and after you
graduate college is a great time

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:22.580
to do it.
 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.730
One of the places I went to was
Hong Kong.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.933
Now Hong Kong at that time
there were huge numbers of

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.720
people coming out of China.
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.050
China was still extraordinarily
poor at the time,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.709
and any time anybody could
leave they left,

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.069
and so Hong Kong was incredibly
crowded with very poor people

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.140
and it's still an incredibly
crowded place of course,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.190
and migrants are still coming
out if they can.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.760
One of the--where were these
people going to live?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.060
There were hillsides with
shanty towns,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.190
lots and lots of shanty towns,
but also the--

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.170
it's right on the ocean,
it's an island,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.241
part of it's an island,
so the water is free so many

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.650
people were living in little
sampans,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.250
little boats called sampans
in--just in the harbor docked

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.848
sort of almost anywhere.
 

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:19.066
I thought well that's
interesting, and one of my

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.966
friends, I had a number of
Chinese friends took me to look

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:24.128
at the boats.
 

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:27.806
It was interesting,
I wasn't yet really interested

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:32.311
in demography but I couldn't
help notice that basically every

00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:36.138
boat had a little girl on it
11,12, 13 or something,

00:02:36.138 --> 00:02:37.639
maybe younger.
 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.910
And then we got invited on the
boat,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.774
one of the first--one of the
boats and people were extremely

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:46.739
polite,
even the very poor,

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.080
very polite and a lot of bowing
and shaking hands on my part,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.930
and they wanted to offer me
something,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.400
a little bit of tea,
a little bit of rice cake,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.538
they're just as wonderful as
they could be.

00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:01.270
I noticed that when something
had to be done like the tea had

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.443
to be gotten,
or this that or the other

00:03:03.443 --> 00:03:06.908
thing, it was that little girl
that was doing all the work.

00:03:06.908 --> 00:03:09.562
Okay, so what,
that's one the kids,

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:12.758
it's good for kids to have some
chores.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.699
Then since--they didn't have
didn't have television or a lot

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.688
of entertainment and here was
this Westerner and they weren't

00:03:18.688 --> 00:03:21.580
so used to seeing a lot of
Westerners on their boats--

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.669
I sort of got passed from boat
to boat.

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.280
When you go walking around the
world that's a very good,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.528
if you go to places where they
don't see Westerners you can get

00:03:28.528 --> 00:03:32.072
passed on very easily--
so in boat after boat--and this

00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:35.979
phenomenon repeated itself,
that there was this little girl

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.210
in every boat and she seemed to
be doing all the work.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.038
Finally, I asked my friends,
what's going on here?

00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:47.590
A little hard to get the
information out of them,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.950
but in actual fact it was a
form of shall we say family

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.291
population control that the--
there--this was a

00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:01.743
non-contracepting population so
children just coming and they

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:06.271
couldn't support the number of
children that they had and they

00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:08.870
did not value girls very much.
 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.646
What they did is,
basically, they sold the girls

00:04:12.646 --> 00:04:17.209
from one boat to the next boat,
and then the little girls were

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.524
basically servants,
again you can use the word

00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:23.005
slave it you want,
but servants in whatever boat

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:27.250
they had been sold to,
and some money changed hands,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.502
of course all illegal because
Hong Kong was then under British

00:04:31.502 --> 00:04:32.129
rules.
 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.639
It's illegal almost everywhere
anyway.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.065
They were just working,
doing as much work as could be

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:41.819
gotten out of them.
 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.916
Well that was very sad,
but it wasn't a disaster

00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:47.750
because everybody was living
very poorly.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.779
Then later, same trip,
with my medical connections,

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.870
I got to tour one of the big
British--

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.762
Queen Elizabeth Hospital,
one of these big city

00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:01.095
hospitals,
it had ward after ward,

00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:03.930
and one of the things I was
taken to see--

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.889
tuberculosis was a very big
problem back then,

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.379
leprosy was a problem,
tuberculosis was a problem.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.120
I did something stupid with
leprosy I visited--

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.459
there was a leper colony on an
island off of Hong Kong and they

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:20.245
were constructing stuff,
and I cannot stand around while

00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:23.490
people are working and me not so
I grabbed a pitch--

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.329
a pickax and started working
with them and of course the

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.240
pickax is rough.
 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.677
It's made of not terribly well
polished wood and there I was

00:05:34.677 --> 00:05:37.300
banging away with it and it rubs
whatever--

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.343
Leprosy is a bacteria that gets
into your skin and the only way

00:05:41.343 --> 00:05:44.670
to get it is to get that leprosy
into your skin,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.137
so the lepers had been working
with it and rubbing it into

00:05:48.137 --> 00:05:52.029
their skin and they were rubbing
into the wood of the ax and then

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.759
onto me.
 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.254
I did not get--it was really
stupid in retrospect but you do

00:05:57.254 --> 00:06:01.370
a lot of stupid things and I did
not catch leprosy,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.244
and in fact,
by that time most--they had a

00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:07.963
drug,
an antibiotic against leprosy

00:06:07.963 --> 00:06:12.028
and most of the leprosy bacillus
in these people was dead,

00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:15.550
so it probably wasn't quite as
dangerous as it might have been.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.723
Anyway, I did not catch leprosy;
you can check my hand and so

00:06:20.723 --> 00:06:21.389
forth.
 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.678
The people there had the
old--this is an aside but it's

00:06:24.678 --> 00:06:26.689
about poverty so I'll tell you.
 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.399
Leprosy affects the nerve cells
and it doesn't make--

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.860
directly make your fingers or
nose fall off,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.009
but you don't feel wounds,
so you don't--

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:36.910
because you don't have the
nerve cells--

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.853
so you don't take care of
wounds, eventually the fingers

00:06:41.853 --> 00:06:45.978
get infected and damaged,
the damage is kind of constant

00:06:45.978 --> 00:06:47.910
and parts of you fall off
actually.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.750
But it's not the leprosy
bacteria itself,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.463
which only attacks nerves,
it's the damage that you're not

00:06:52.463 --> 00:06:54.480
paying--
you're not noticing,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.100
you're not aware of.
 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.430
Sorry that was an excursion.
 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.040
Leprosy was a big thing in Hong
Kong at that time,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.403
as was tuberculosis and in the
big British hospital I went in

00:07:05.403 --> 00:07:08.750
and one of the things I saw was
huge wards,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:14.187
they're big places with--again
I saw a ward full of these just

00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:19.089
pubescent or pre-pubescent girls
and they all had TB.

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:22.380
Then there was two or three of
these wards actually,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.317
so a very large number of girls
there, and I said what's going

00:07:26.317 --> 00:07:26.769
on?
 

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:29.639
Then the full story came out.
 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.874
That yes, indeed,
there is a lot of selling of

00:07:32.874 --> 00:07:36.269
the children between boats,
and yes they work,

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:39.853
and because they're underfed
and overworked and TB is

00:07:39.853 --> 00:07:44.209
rampant,
these girls get tuberculosis.

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:48.249
Then what happens is they take
them to the health station and

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:52.355
the doctors say you've got to
build up this girl and they give

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:53.769
them milk powder.
 

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:58.160
Milk powder is taken,
and what do you think they do

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.180
with the milk powder?
 

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.879
Give it to the boy child,
so the girl gets sicker,

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:06.860
and then she's getting quite
sick and she's brought back,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.170
and now she's given medicine,
an antibiotic,

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.980
and guess what happens with
medicine?

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.636
Taken to the market,
sold, the money is used to buy

00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:19.990
rice or milk for the boy
children.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.800
Eventually--so TB,
as you're probably aware,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.752
gets the lungs,
it can also get in the long

00:08:25.752 --> 00:08:28.593
bones of the body,
and eventually it infects the

00:08:28.593 --> 00:08:30.379
long bones and the long bones
start--

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:33.363
huge amounts of pus builds up
and eventually it breaks through

00:08:33.363 --> 00:08:37.020
the skin,
so someone who has a child with

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:42.668
this kind of long bone
tuberculosis sees basically pus,

00:08:42.668 --> 00:08:45.658
the skin eventually breaks and
the pus starts pouring out,

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:49.643
and the parents are terribly
afraid and they're afraid for

00:08:49.643 --> 00:08:52.731
their biological kids,
their biological sons

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:53.500
especially.
 

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:59.520
As soon as this happens to the
girl they just dump her at the

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.140
British--at whatever the public
hospital is and they just

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.450
abandon them there.
 

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.357
What the doctors told me was
that the girls are now 13 or 14,

00:09:12.357 --> 00:09:17.267
the tuberculosis is so far gone
that there's nothing they can

00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:17.840
do.
 

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.788
And the girls die.
 

00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:25.914
This was my first introduction
to that nexus of extreme

00:09:25.914 --> 00:09:29.770
poverty,
extremely crowded conditions,

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.154
overpopulation,
and I'm not saying the causal

00:09:33.154 --> 00:09:36.803
relationship between those two
is a complicated story which we

00:09:36.803 --> 00:09:39.466
will get to,
but that nexus of--you always

00:09:39.466 --> 00:09:43.235
see, whenever you see incredibly
dense populations you always see

00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:46.474
this kind of poverty and the
kinds of things that people

00:09:46.474 --> 00:09:47.240
undergo.
 

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.440
I was trying to put myself in
the mind of a parent,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.408
what kind of a situation are
they are in,

00:09:54.408 --> 00:09:59.000
that they sell their daughters
to fairly certain death and the

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.009
situation is as I've described
to you.

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:07.183
Even though I saw this as a
huge--as a very large phenomenon

00:10:07.183 --> 00:10:10.778
I've never seen this in any
literature.

00:10:10.778 --> 00:10:12.418
I've never seen an academic
paper about it,

00:10:12.418 --> 00:10:15.970
I've never seen a newspaper
story about it,

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.490
it's not discussed in
demographic circles,

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.179
and some public health circles
which I'm aware,

00:10:21.179 --> 00:10:24.769
it just isn't brought up.
 

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:27.604
I'm thinking to myself,
I was not a scholar of this

00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:30.099
thing, and I said,
"have I misremembered

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:30.950
this?"
 

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.774
You very frequently misremember
things, have I blown up,

00:10:33.774 --> 00:10:37.009
did I see one or two cases and
have I somehow aggrandized it.

00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:39.046
I eventually,
after telling the story quite a

00:10:39.046 --> 00:10:41.676
bit,
even in the early runnings of

00:10:41.676 --> 00:10:44.586
this class,
I started doubting that

00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:47.394
this--that somehow--
why such a big thing,

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:48.490
why wasn't it shown?
 

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.330
One year I decided:
this is the last year;

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.947
I'm not going to tell this
story again because I don't have

00:10:52.947 --> 00:10:54.029
any references for it.
 

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:57.227
Everything I say I try to--if a
student comes to me I can give

00:10:57.227 --> 00:11:00.322
you a reference and you can see
in the notes a lot of things

00:11:00.322 --> 00:11:03.573
have little references which you
probably can't read but if you

00:11:03.573 --> 00:11:06.615
call me or email me I'll tell
you what that little scribble

00:11:06.615 --> 00:11:07.350
means.
 

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.470
Anyway at the end of that
lecture, actually it was about

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.767
two lectures later,
because there was an exam

00:11:14.767 --> 00:11:17.090
coming up right after that.
 

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.139
More than in this class,
in previous years,

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:23.288
students used to come up and we
used to spend a half an hour or

00:11:23.288 --> 00:11:25.879
an hour discussing whatever they
want to discuss.

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:29.293
And one girl stayed by the side
and then when everybody is gone

00:11:29.293 --> 00:11:31.820
she came up to me,
a little bit shy,

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.850
and said, "Thank you for
telling that story.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.629
My mother was one of those
girls."

00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:41.096
What she knew,
from her mother,

00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:46.198
was basically what I had said,
but the difference was that

00:11:46.198 --> 00:11:50.980
this was her biological mother,
and this wasn't an abandoned

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.379
girl.
 

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:54.190
She said she remembered being
in the hospital with all girls

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:59.277
basically--
the mother--I said "Oh my

00:11:59.277 --> 00:12:02.403
gosh,
would your mother come to class

00:12:02.403 --> 00:12:05.700
and describe what this situation
was like?"

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.461
Yes, the mother was in fact a
professor at a college in New

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:11.096
Jersey,
not Princeton,

00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:13.918
and she came up here and
described it,

00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:18.716
and again, described it in
great detail and more or less as

00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:20.370
I've described it.
 

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.139
She said that when she was in
the hospital,

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:24.379
she saw all the other little
girls,

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:27.149
more or less the same age,
same medical problem,

00:12:27.149 --> 00:12:28.841
and she said,
as a little girl she always

00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:31.101
wondered why their parent--
their mother didn't come to

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:32.687
visit them,
why their parents didn't come

00:12:32.687 --> 00:12:33.250
to visit them.
 

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.682
She was one of the few whose
mother--I guess the father,

00:12:36.682 --> 00:12:40.240
I don't really remember that
detail, did come to visit.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.784
Well the doctors kind of
noticed that this girl had a

00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:50.029
bio-parent and so they took her
out of the big ward and put a

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:54.750
lot of incredibly special effort
into this one girl and

00:12:54.750 --> 00:13:00.168
eventually she got the bacteria
out of her and survived.

00:13:00.168 --> 00:13:06.201
She was--walked like this,
missing a hip and had a fair

00:13:06.201 --> 00:13:10.558
number of sequelae from the bone
TB,

00:13:10.558 --> 00:13:13.831
but she got cured,
grew up, managed to get

00:13:13.831 --> 00:13:16.067
educated,
migrate to America,

00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:19.851
and became a professor at,
as I say at a college in New

00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:23.519
Jersey and had a daughter at
Yale taking this course.

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:30.967
It's one of the miracle stories
but I'm convinced now that I

00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:34.629
didn't dream this stuff up.
 

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:38.404
That's really my personal
motivation, that started of

00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:42.253
course the motivation for
being--doing all this course

00:13:42.253 --> 00:13:42.980
stuff.
 

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:51.100
What's the word we describe for
this era of the 1960s?

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.870
The population explosion.
 

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.019
Why do we use the word
explosion?

00:13:57.019 --> 00:14:01.899
It's a rather emotive kind of
word and it's for this reason,

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:06.788
that here is a somewhat
fanciful recreation of history,

00:14:06.788 --> 00:14:09.511
but we know it can't be very
much different from this because

00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:11.618
we know what the--
we start knowing what the

00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:14.182
populations were here,
so you put some sort of a

00:14:14.182 --> 00:14:16.500
reasonable growth rate and
populations,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.389
its going to look like that.
 

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:21.298
The only thing you can really
see is the Black Death,

00:14:21.298 --> 00:14:23.928
then as we've talked about in
this class,

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:30.340
starting roughly in the 1700s
population just takes off.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.129
You've heard of exponential
population growth,

00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:36.759
and you may or may not know
what that means,

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:39.847
but what it precisely means is
there's a certain rate of

00:14:39.847 --> 00:14:42.166
growth,
a certain percent per year,

00:14:42.166 --> 00:14:45.940
and each year the population
grows by that same percent,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.144
1% a year, 2% a year,
3% a year, but the percentage

00:14:50.144 --> 00:14:51.908
growth is constant.
 

00:14:51.908 --> 00:14:55.384
The numbers of people added
every year grows because the

00:14:55.384 --> 00:14:59.114
base grows, but the percentage
added every year is constant,

00:14:59.114 --> 00:15:01.009
that's exponential growth.
 

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:04.740
In fact, during this period,
in fact during most of this

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.808
period, the percentage rate of
growth has been increasing.

00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:16.952
It increased from somewhere out
here of .001% to then 0.01,0.1

00:15:16.952 --> 00:15:22.158
and in this period it went up to
2%,

00:15:22.158 --> 00:15:26.553
even 3% globally,
the whole world population

00:15:26.553 --> 00:15:30.950
growth rate in this incredible
expansion.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.110
As you can sort of see again,
in this somewhat schematized

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.653
graph,
that the incredible rate of

00:15:36.653 --> 00:15:41.193
growth has slowed down a little
bit and we'll talk about what

00:15:41.193 --> 00:15:43.774
that means,
but it's still growing

00:15:43.774 --> 00:15:46.918
outrageously,
or they project that it should

00:15:46.918 --> 00:15:47.710
slow down.
 

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:54.365
This is--we are now at about
6.7 billion so some of that

00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:57.269
graph is a projection.
 

00:15:57.269 --> 00:16:00.317
You can call this kind of
population growth

00:16:00.317 --> 00:16:02.928
hyper-exponential where the
rate,

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:07.889
not only does the growth get
faster in an exponential way,

00:16:07.889 --> 00:16:12.341
but the rate of growth itself
grows so it's hyper-exponential

00:16:12.341 --> 00:16:13.009
growth.
 

00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:17.657
Now there's a--the whole issue
of population growth is very

00:16:17.657 --> 00:16:21.712
politicized,
some people don't think that we

00:16:21.712 --> 00:16:23.777
should pay--
there's no problems,

00:16:23.777 --> 00:16:26.120
some people think we shouldn't
do anything about it,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.274
some people think it's too
politically sensitive to say

00:16:30.274 --> 00:16:33.908
anything about it,
and in this discussion one of

00:16:33.908 --> 00:16:37.394
the things you hear is,
oh the world's population has

00:16:37.394 --> 00:16:41.320
been growing for a long time,
we've been able to cope with

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.410
it, our economics is wonderful,
and we've industrialized,

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.668
the population has been
growing,

00:16:47.668 --> 00:16:50.383
and people have been getting
richer and that is certainly

00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:53.607
true since Malthus wrote,
the population has multiplied

00:16:53.607 --> 00:16:57.341
many times and yet these mass,
mass starvations have not

00:16:57.341 --> 00:16:58.009
happened.
 

00:16:58.009 --> 00:17:00.538
In fact, not only,
as the population has grown,

00:17:00.538 --> 00:17:02.080
people have gotten richer.
 

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.903
They say, we've coped with this
in the past we can cope with it

00:17:05.903 --> 00:17:06.890
in the future.
 

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.028
The problem is that this is
unprecedented.

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:13.386
That we don't really have any
significant length of history

00:17:13.386 --> 00:17:16.173
for something like this,
so anybody who tells you that

00:17:16.173 --> 00:17:18.789
they have--
that they know what's going to

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:22.939
happen in the future is just
ignorant and this is absolutely

00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:25.048
and just unknown territory.
 

00:17:25.048 --> 00:17:27.217
Unknown territory doesn't mean,
I'm not saying there's

00:17:27.217 --> 00:17:28.730
absolutely going to be a
disaster,

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.808
or it's absolutely going to be
fine,

00:17:30.808 --> 00:17:34.525
it's just that we have no way
of predicting basically anything

00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:36.838
with a population growing like
that.

00:17:36.838 --> 00:17:39.848
Up until a few years ago
basically nobody predicted all

00:17:39.848 --> 00:17:42.680
the environmental--
for instance nobody predicted

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.828
all the environmental problems
that we're having now,

00:17:45.828 --> 00:17:49.940
that came essentially out of
the blue.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:55.461
Now this is a schematized
thing, here's kind of a more

00:17:55.461 --> 00:17:58.068
cartoonish,
even more cartoonish,

00:17:58.068 --> 00:18:01.462
but it doesn't go quite so far
back so it's a little bit better

00:18:01.462 --> 00:18:03.753
data here,
and again, showing the same

00:18:03.753 --> 00:18:04.150
thing.
 

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.230
This was--you're here this was
drawn in 2004,

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:12.123
we're now in 2008 and we're
about 6.7 so in just the four

00:18:12.123 --> 00:18:17.278
years since this was made we're
still on this trajectory;

00:18:17.278 --> 00:18:22.130
nothing very unexpected has
happened.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:26.011
Here is the U.S. Census
Bureau projection,

00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:30.748
updated December 2008,
so it's as recent as you can

00:18:30.748 --> 00:18:31.788
find.
 

00:18:31.788 --> 00:18:35.710
For what's happened--they do
100 years and you may notice

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.598
three billion,
four billion,

00:18:37.598 --> 00:18:39.630
five, six, seven,
eight, nine,

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.970
and it just keeps going and out
at the end they're predicting a

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.608
little bit of fall off but one
doesn't know.

00:18:47.608 --> 00:18:54.343
By 2040 they're expecting nine
billion people and still

00:18:54.343 --> 00:18:55.588
growing.
 

00:18:55.588 --> 00:19:00.436
There's no--you've heard a lot
about Europe and Michael

00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:06.093
Teitelbaum gave you a lecture on
the low population growth rates

00:19:06.093 --> 00:19:09.635
in Europe,
in Japan, and in quite a number

00:19:09.635 --> 00:19:13.319
of countries in the world and
that's correct that the

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:17.430
population growth is extremely
unbalanced in the world.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.258
The developed countries are
having zero to at most 5% of the

00:19:22.258 --> 00:19:24.792
increase,
they're growing at .1%,

00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:28.642
whereas, some of the poorer
countries are still growing at

00:19:28.642 --> 00:19:31.060
2% or 3%,
so I'll show you a minute that

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.144
basically all of this growth is
in the poorer countries where

00:19:34.144 --> 00:19:37.518
they're least--
have the least resources to

00:19:37.518 --> 00:19:40.509
cope with this amount of growth.
 

00:19:40.509 --> 00:19:46.459
Now here is the population
change in millions and we'll see

00:19:46.459 --> 00:19:50.460
that that has basically been
growing.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:57.298
This is where we are now,
it basically grew up to 1990,

00:19:57.298 --> 00:20:01.945
it's fallen off a little bit
here, and then it's predicted to

00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:06.593
keep growing for another few
years and then it's predicted to

00:20:06.593 --> 00:20:07.910
go down here.
 

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.970
I emphasize--guess work--this
was not on the original.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.160
This is data,
we have fairly decent reason,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.338
but again this error bar is on
here and we don't know what

00:20:17.338 --> 00:20:20.827
error bars--
how big they should be and this

00:20:20.827 --> 00:20:22.750
is really guess work.
 

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.339
The guess work is not too bad
for the near future because the

00:20:27.339 --> 00:20:32.160
women who are going to have
these children are already born,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.509
they're already close to
maturity, we know that fertility

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:39.219
rates generally don't change all
that fast although I will show

00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:42.328
you plenty of exceptions to that
in the lecture.

00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:46.298
You can maybe more or less
believe the next dozen years

00:20:46.298 --> 00:20:50.119
here or something like that and
then you make various

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:52.644
projections,
and I'll show you those

00:20:52.644 --> 00:20:55.807
projections can be almost
anything because we don't have a

00:20:55.807 --> 00:20:57.358
very good basis for that.
 

00:20:57.358 --> 00:21:02.476
The near term projection that
the number of people added every

00:21:02.476 --> 00:21:07.257
year is going to go up is
probably pretty accurate because

00:21:07.257 --> 00:21:09.269
it's very near term.
 

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:14.588
Now, again, the optimists take
that data,

00:21:14.588 --> 00:21:16.390
that here is the number of
people added,

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.259
you see it has been going up,
it's kind of jiggling around,

00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:22.565
and it may or may not decline
in the future but because the

00:21:22.565 --> 00:21:26.531
base has been growing,
because the population keeps

00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:29.512
growing,
if the same number of people

00:21:29.512 --> 00:21:34.029
are added every year then the
percentage increase goes down.

00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:37.278
So when you hear a lot of
optimism about the population

00:21:37.278 --> 00:21:42.017
situation,
what they're talking about is

00:21:42.017 --> 00:21:50.068
that the peak RATE of growth
here in the 1960s has come down

00:21:50.068 --> 00:21:54.298
as a percentage of the base.
 

00:21:54.298 --> 00:21:57.503
As you just saw,
since the base is growing the

00:21:57.503 --> 00:22:01.848
number--actual number of people
added has not changed all that

00:22:01.848 --> 00:22:02.490
much.
 

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.653
Again, we're growing,
the world is growing something

00:22:06.653 --> 00:22:09.951
1.25%--
1 to 1.5% a year currently and

00:22:09.951 --> 00:22:13.460
the guess work is--
and the hope is that will

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.538
continue down.
 

00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:18.410
In fact, this continued
decrease is based on some pretty

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.170
optimistic assumptions.
 

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:24.484
We may get time to talk about
them later but,

00:22:24.484 --> 00:22:27.328
fertility has been falling.
 

00:22:27.328 --> 00:22:30.973
If you presume that fertility
has fallen as far as it's going

00:22:30.973 --> 00:22:33.828
to fall and now it's going to
stay constant,

00:22:33.828 --> 00:22:36.240
so the most conservative
projection is constant

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:36.868
fertility.
 

00:22:36.868 --> 00:22:40.163
Whatever we are at now that's
the way it's going to be,

00:22:40.163 --> 00:22:43.336
then you don't get anything
like this, you get a huge

00:22:43.336 --> 00:22:44.068
takeoff.
 

00:22:44.068 --> 00:22:48.505
This presumes that fertility
will keep falling until people

00:22:48.505 --> 00:22:52.328
have two children per family and
fairly rapidly.

00:22:52.328 --> 00:22:55.862
That's a nice guess,
a nice prediction,

00:22:55.862 --> 00:23:01.439
but we really have essentially
no decent theoretical basis to

00:23:01.439 --> 00:23:03.019
presume that.
 

00:23:03.019 --> 00:23:06.980
Now here is the one number you
should really keep in your mind,

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:12.308
this is right up to date,
this is the Census Bureau 2009,

00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:15.098
this gives you the world events
and it just--

00:23:15.098 --> 00:23:18.380
for being kind of cute it
breaks it down to how much is

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.912
the increase each year,
month, day, you can do it down

00:23:21.912 --> 00:23:26.655
to the second and notice--
and I gave you these numbers

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:33.480
last time as ratios as per 1,000
this is the number of births per

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.558
year 135 million and the number
of deaths 55 million,

00:23:39.558 --> 00:23:42.767
so that's the difference,
that's the population growth

00:23:42.767 --> 00:23:44.279
rate 80 million people.
 

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:47.738
That's--I think that's one of
the key numbers to just keep in

00:23:47.738 --> 00:23:49.346
mind,
round it off,

00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:54.374
80 million that the increase
every year on earth now is 80

00:23:54.374 --> 00:23:59.490
million and it's been roughly
that for quite some time.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.363
The maximum here was something
like 90 million,

00:24:04.363 --> 00:24:09.448
not quite 90 million,
and now we're just about 80

00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:10.720
million.
 

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.088
When people say the
birth--everything's coming down,

00:24:13.088 --> 00:24:15.597
things are getting better,
we're going to come to a soft

00:24:15.597 --> 00:24:18.080
landing,
well what we actually know is

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.634
the difference between 87
million and 80 million with

00:24:21.634 --> 00:24:25.733
large and unknown error bars so
it might not be a decrease at

00:24:25.733 --> 00:24:26.349
all.
 

00:24:26.349 --> 00:24:27.660
I mean we just don't know.
 

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:33.782
Nothing drastic has happened to
engender such optimism about the

00:24:33.782 --> 00:24:38.406
future of human population,
although you will hear that

00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:42.200
over and over,
and over again.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:49.775
Now as I showed you,
this graph that we are here at

00:24:49.775 --> 00:24:56.896
the--actually here to 6.7
billion and all of the

00:24:56.896 --> 00:25:04.170
projections show it to continue
to increase.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.378
Again the rate of increase gets
fuzzier and fuzzier as you go

00:25:07.378 --> 00:25:11.077
further out in time,
but it will increase,

00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:18.131
and the projections are that by
2040 will be nine billion and

00:25:18.131 --> 00:25:20.130
still growing.
 

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.634
We're adding a billion at 80
million a year we're adding a

00:25:24.634 --> 00:25:26.769
billion every 12.5 years.
 

00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:31.251
If it falls a little bit we'll
add a billion every 13 years or

00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:35.512
every 14 years and that's to
keep in mind when you think of

00:25:35.512 --> 00:25:38.991
those numbers,
that's a billion people every

00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:42.509
12,13, 14 years,
pick whatever number you like,

00:25:42.509 --> 00:25:43.769
and think of, everybody's green.
 

00:25:43.769 --> 00:25:46.269
Anybody green in this class?
 

00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:48.039
Anybody not green?
 

00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:50.380
Are you environmentalists?
 

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.410
Yes, who's an
anti-environmentalist?

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.029
Hooray!
 

00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:55.598
One, Two.
 

00:25:55.598 --> 00:26:00.088
Well I'm going to return to
this theme but this can't be

00:26:00.088 --> 00:26:03.981
repeated enough times,
think of the environmental

00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:08.400
footprint of a billion extra
people every dozen or so years,

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.118
a billion extra people.
 

00:26:10.118 --> 00:26:11.837
Now add up all the
environmentalism,

00:26:11.837 --> 00:26:14.340
all the achievements of this
wonderful environmental

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:14.980
movement.
 

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.630
It's a wonderful thing,
but it pales in comparison that

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.890
it's just we're playing a losing
battle with the environment.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.186
As long as we're growing at a
billion people in so many years

00:26:26.186 --> 00:26:29.539
we are not going to solve the
environmental problems no matter

00:26:29.539 --> 00:26:32.116
what we do,
it's just too great an increase

00:26:32.116 --> 00:26:32.720
of people.
 

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.161
Yet, environmentalists
generally never talk about human

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:40.019
population;
it's too politically dangerous

00:26:40.019 --> 00:26:42.038
to talk about that.
 

00:26:42.038 --> 00:26:46.301
Hence in this course one of the
very few in the country or

00:26:46.301 --> 00:26:50.040
anywhere in the world that
really hits--talks about

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.058
population straight on.
 

00:26:52.058 --> 00:26:56.843
Why do we--why are we--why is
everybody projecting that the

00:26:56.843 --> 00:27:00.720
population is going to keep
increasing there?

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.233
It's simply you look at the age
structure and something like

00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:09.519
half of the world's population
is under 15 years old,

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:13.769
i.e., just coming in--I'm sorry
1/3 of the world's population is

00:27:13.769 --> 00:27:17.749
under 15 years old and so just
coming into reproductive ages

00:27:17.749 --> 00:27:21.590
and we know that for the next--
they will come into

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:26.425
reproductive ages and then be of
reproductive potential for the

00:27:26.425 --> 00:27:31.105
following 30 years and we know
that this increasing number of

00:27:31.105 --> 00:27:35.705
now 10 to 15 year olds will be
coming into reproductive ages

00:27:35.705 --> 00:27:39.058
will keep the population
increasing.

00:27:39.058 --> 00:27:44.071
It's certain that it will
increase although the rate of

00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:49.269
increase and how it changes is
certainly less certain.

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:55.534
It's under almost any kind of
reasonable assumption the

00:27:55.534 --> 00:28:02.608
population is going to grow
another several billion people.

00:28:02.608 --> 00:28:05.338
Again, we're in unprecedented
territory,

00:28:05.338 --> 00:28:09.741
most people think the earth
right now is incredibly stressed

00:28:09.741 --> 00:28:14.525
and it is environmental things,
situation, and now add another

00:28:14.525 --> 00:28:18.866
couple of billion people to that
in the near future and see

00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:20.288
what's going on.
 

00:28:20.288 --> 00:28:23.115
Since we don't have crystal
balls--the students usually ask

00:28:23.115 --> 00:28:25.259
me the question,
'what's going to happen?'

00:28:25.259 --> 00:28:28.526
I always have to say,
'I left my crystal ball in my

00:28:28.526 --> 00:28:29.180
closet.'
 

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.113
I didn't bring it today,
I do not have a way into the

00:28:33.113 --> 00:28:35.174
future,
but anybody who tells you they

00:28:35.174 --> 00:28:37.088
know what's going to happen in
the future,

00:28:37.088 --> 00:28:39.839
and especially if they're going
to be optimistic about it,

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:45.490
is a very blind kind of person.
 

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:50.204
You've all heard discussions of
the population problem and it's

00:28:50.204 --> 00:28:52.640
really two different problems.
 

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.865
The first problem,
which in the West we're very

00:28:56.865 --> 00:29:00.538
cognizant of,
is over consumption by rich

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:01.548
people.
 

00:29:01.548 --> 00:29:06.388
A good fraction of the world is
what you should definitely call

00:29:06.388 --> 00:29:09.200
rich and they consume like
crazy,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.519
and a lot of what we consume is
frivolous like Hummers and great

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:15.182
big--
some little person driving this

00:29:15.182 --> 00:29:19.472
great big SUV that they never
carry anything heavy and they

00:29:19.472 --> 00:29:23.911
certainly don't have to drive
over logs or something which an

00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:26.130
SUV is actually good for.
 

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.390
The over consumption depletes
the world's resources,

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.818
increases pollution,
destruction of habitat,

00:29:33.818 --> 00:29:37.833
etcetera, etcetera,
etcetera, so environmental

00:29:37.833 --> 00:29:43.720
misery is largely caused by rich
people consuming profligately,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.538
unnecessarily and profligately.
 

00:29:47.538 --> 00:29:51.380
The other side of the coin is
poverty,

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.747
the world is definitely split
and the split is getting wider

00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:59.536
between poverty and over--
people who over consume - and

00:29:59.536 --> 00:30:03.323
their problem of course is under
consumption and they lead to all

00:30:03.323 --> 00:30:06.932
of the problems of poverty which
I have discussed in Hong Kong

00:30:06.932 --> 00:30:10.009
and I don't have to tell you
very much about what the

00:30:10.009 --> 00:30:12.848
problems in the world of poor
people are.

00:30:12.848 --> 00:30:14.400
We have these two opposite
problems,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.318
what I call environmental
misery and human misery,

00:30:18.318 --> 00:30:22.575
and they're both very largely
the result of too rapid

00:30:22.575 --> 00:30:26.851
population growth that we might,
in some utopian scenario,

00:30:26.851 --> 00:30:28.769
eventually be able to cope
with,

00:30:28.769 --> 00:30:32.980
say the population levels that
we have now, maybe.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.590
But, at the rate of growth it's
obvious just looking around you

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.594
that our technology,
our economy,

00:30:37.594 --> 00:30:41.645
our governments,
have not been able to cope with

00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:42.940
this so far.
 

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.816
It's very interesting as a
political note that there are

00:30:45.816 --> 00:30:48.170
these two faces of the
population problem,

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.868
the environmental problem and
the people misery problem,

00:30:51.868 --> 00:30:55.279
and it's amazing how people
focus on one or the other.

00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:59.026
There's people like--work in
planned parenthood and various

00:30:59.026 --> 00:31:01.286
feminists and women's
organizations,

00:31:01.286 --> 00:31:03.868
they're interested in people
misery.

00:31:03.868 --> 00:31:06.548
They always talk about poverty
and its attendant problems.

00:31:06.548 --> 00:31:08.292
Then there's the
environmentalists and they're

00:31:08.292 --> 00:31:10.269
worried about trees and the
survival of animals,

00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:13.269
and forests,
and nature and both are of

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:17.769
course very important and very
good causes to work on,

00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:20.258
but it is absolutely mind
boggling how rarely you find

00:31:20.258 --> 00:31:23.132
anybody that's sort of,
is really in any way,

00:31:23.132 --> 00:31:28.029
concerned about both problems,
or in any way realizes how

00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:33.250
population is the centerpiece of
both of these problems.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:38.596
Let me talk just a little bit
about over consumption and who's

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:42.539
the number one bad guy in over
consumption?

00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:44.900
We are.
 

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.009
So here's the story for--some
of the story for the United

00:31:49.009 --> 00:31:49.670
States.
 

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:57.119
This is the growth of the
United States population from

00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:59.190
1900 to 2000.
 

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:06.759
We in 1900 had about 75 million
and in 2006 this--

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:13.798
so in 2006 we passed 300
million people and that's a

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:21.663
quadrupling that our population
has quadrupled in that one

00:32:21.663 --> 00:32:23.318
century.
 

00:32:23.318 --> 00:32:27.064
We were almost like an
underdeveloped country in our

00:32:27.064 --> 00:32:28.900
population growth rate.
 

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.460
That is up to the--almost
current,

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.410
and here is again the latest
Census Bureau thing from--

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.805
again this was--just got it out
of the computer last night

00:32:38.805 --> 00:32:40.898
actually,
the latest numbers,

00:32:40.898 --> 00:32:44.672
that here's the standard--
one of the standard things is

00:32:44.672 --> 00:32:49.785
give you 100 year time frame,
currently they're using 1950 to

00:32:49.785 --> 00:32:52.507
2050 and we are,
as you know,

00:32:52.507 --> 00:32:55.137
right about here and here is
the U.S.

00:32:55.137 --> 00:32:59.377
population growth rate and just
almost a perfectly straight

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:00.108
line.
 

00:33:00.108 --> 00:33:03.563
There is no prediction that the
U.S.

00:33:03.563 --> 00:33:08.990
is going to slow down in its
population growth rate,

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.318
we are growing at about three
million a year,

00:33:12.318 --> 00:33:17.871
currently that's 1% of a year,
and because of natural increase

00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:23.150
that's births over deaths of
people already in America,

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:29.130
plus immigration,
we're just going here.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:34.672
In our population growth rate,
it's about 2/3 births over

00:33:34.672 --> 00:33:40.608
deaths of citizens already here
and about 1/3 immigration.

00:33:40.608 --> 00:33:45.233
Of immigration,
the guesses are that it's about

00:33:45.233 --> 00:33:49.843
2/3 legal and 1/3 illegal,
obviously the illegal is an

00:33:49.843 --> 00:33:51.868
enormous guess,
the absolute number,

00:33:51.868 --> 00:33:53.788
the percentage of anything that
it is,

00:33:53.788 --> 00:33:56.809
if you look at how they come up
with these numbers it's really

00:33:56.809 --> 00:33:57.900
'seat-of-the-pants.'
 

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:03.423
We don't know very much about
the magnitude of illegal

00:34:03.423 --> 00:34:08.739
immigration but it's an enormous
political issue.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:13.780
Now on the consumption side,
of course we consume so much,

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:19.443
and again numbers vary kind of
wildly but the range of numbers

00:34:19.443 --> 00:34:24.644
are that an American consumes
something between 20 and 40

00:34:24.644 --> 00:34:30.309
times what a person in a
developing country will consume.

00:34:30.309 --> 00:34:34.219
If you multiplied our three
million population growth a year

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.599
by a consumption factor of 20
that's equivalent--

00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:41.900
a population growth of 60
million poor people and so if

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.998
you do it that way it looks like
that our population growth is as

00:34:46.998 --> 00:34:51.617
damaging to the resource and
environmental situation of the

00:34:51.617 --> 00:34:55.840
world as the whole rest of world
put together,

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.996
and that's just considering our
population increase not the

00:34:59.996 --> 00:35:04.369
population base which is also
consuming at this great rate.

00:35:04.369 --> 00:35:10.170
We are--indeed it is certainly
correct that we are a tremendous

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:15.409
strain on the environment and
resources of the earth,

00:35:15.409 --> 00:35:17.159
and as I showed you it's not
getting better,

00:35:17.159 --> 00:35:21.010
our population is just
increasing.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.481
You have to balance against
that that a lot of our

00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:26.356
population growth is of course
people coming in from other

00:35:26.356 --> 00:35:28.844
countries so that it's not,
in some sense,

00:35:28.844 --> 00:35:32.030
Americans who are getting
richer but its poor people

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.030
coming in and getting richer.
 

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:38.445
You can play these numbers in
all different ways and we'll

00:35:38.445 --> 00:35:41.389
talk about the politics in a
moment.

00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:46.518
The U.S. Census Bureau used
to say that we will reach--that

00:35:46.518 --> 00:35:47.226
the U.S.
 

00:35:47.226 --> 00:35:52.179
population will reach 300
million by the year 2050.

00:35:52.179 --> 00:35:56.500
We reached that number 44 years
earlier than the Census Bureau

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.644
thought,
and we are still growing and

00:35:58.644 --> 00:36:01.668
now the Census Bureau says there
is no sign of stabilization at

00:36:01.668 --> 00:36:02.010
all.
 

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.815
They cannot give you a number
at which they think the U.S.

00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:09.485
population will stabilize,
because as far out as anybody

00:36:09.485 --> 00:36:13.625
can project, there's no reason
to believe that stabilization is

00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:14.559
in view.
 

00:36:14.559 --> 00:36:23.730
Now some of the argumentation
is that again people--

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:28.018
this is a very political issue
and half the people say,

00:36:28.018 --> 00:36:29.820
'it's all those poor people
that are over reproducing,

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.518
can't they learn some self
control?'

00:36:32.518 --> 00:36:34.914
Then you have people saying,
'all those Americans and

00:36:34.914 --> 00:36:37.541
Japanese that consume like
crazy, can't they use some self

00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:38.139
control?'
 

00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:42.664
It's an extremely sterile
argument that goes on and on and

00:36:42.664 --> 00:36:47.188
people don't think beyond two or
three sentences into that

00:36:47.188 --> 00:36:48.219
argument.
 

00:36:48.219 --> 00:36:52.688
As I'll tell you,
if you do it out numerically

00:36:52.688 --> 00:36:58.842
the increasing damage is more or
less equal and it depends more

00:36:58.842 --> 00:37:04.900
critically as Americans usually
blame ourselves that we're the

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.581
problem,
there's a very kind of--I don't

00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:12.681
want to use the word racist but
a very Euro-Americo centric

00:37:12.681 --> 00:37:16.429
argument because the presumption
is when it says,

00:37:16.429 --> 00:37:19.920
well we're the consumers
and--all the poor people,

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.699
we don't have to worry about,
is that they will stay poor.

00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:25.876
It's a Western assumption that
poor people are going to stay

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:28.333
poor and they're not--
not only are they not consumers

00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:30.277
now,
but they're never going to be

00:37:30.277 --> 00:37:30.929
consumers.
 

00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:33.030
And that is just nonsense.
 

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.690
We've seen how the Chinese have
come up enormously,

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.820
the Indians have come up
enormously,

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.369
the Indonesians have come up
enormously,

00:37:40.369 --> 00:37:44.387
everywhere in the world these
vast numbers of poor people are

00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:47.000
now starting to be serious
consumers.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.213
I think the CO_2
production in China I think has

00:37:51.213 --> 00:37:56.757
just outpaced the United States,
but I didn't look that up

00:37:56.757 --> 00:37:59.632
recently,
and so there are equal

00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:03.925
problems, so if one gets out of
one's head the idea that poor

00:38:03.925 --> 00:38:06.929
people are going to stay poor
forever,

00:38:06.929 --> 00:38:11.072
which is a pre-globalization
idea--now a worker in China can

00:38:11.072 --> 00:38:15.494
compete with a worker in America
and eventually there's going to

00:38:15.494 --> 00:38:16.969
be some leveling.
 

00:38:16.969 --> 00:38:20.184
I think the proper thing is,
if you think there are too many

00:38:20.184 --> 00:38:22.829
people on earth,
for either human misery issues

00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:25.030
or environmental misery issues
or both,

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.030
any birth you should consider
more or less equal.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.280
Preventing a birth in America,
in Japan,

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.556
and Indonesia,
everywhere that in the not too

00:38:34.556 --> 00:38:39.101
distant future these people are
going to be more or less equal

00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:43.570
and we'll see in next lecture
what the people themselves want

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:46.030
with respect to this thing.
 

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:51.590
I hope after this course that
none of you get involved in the

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:56.503
sterile argument of us versus
them, it doesn't get you

00:38:56.503 --> 00:38:57.710
anywhere.
 

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:03.045
In the world as it is today
most of the--almost all of the

00:39:03.045 --> 00:39:07.539
population growth is in the
poorest countries.

00:39:07.539 --> 00:39:11.614
Again statistics are pretty
bad, there's something like 95%

00:39:11.614 --> 00:39:15.126
of population growth in the
world is in the poorest

00:39:15.126 --> 00:39:16.110
countries.
 

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.849
As you know,
new people need schools,

00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:20.900
they need healthcare,
they need a place to live,

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.170
they need jobs and all of this
takes money,

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.456
takes capital,
and that's what the poor

00:39:26.456 --> 00:39:29.585
countries are missing,
they don't have the capital,

00:39:29.585 --> 00:39:32.719
they usually don't have the
technological expertise,

00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:36.409
they don't have often the
quality of government that can

00:39:36.409 --> 00:39:40.166
cope with these enormous
problems so it's the places that

00:39:40.166 --> 00:39:44.327
are least capable of coping with
a population increase that are

00:39:44.327 --> 00:39:46.340
in fact saddled with it.
 

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:52.489
The magnitude of this growth is
incredible.

00:39:52.489 --> 00:39:57.610
As far out as we can project
the poor countries are going to

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:01.949
have to build a city equivalent
of one million--

00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:07.715
a city to cope with a million
people every week for the next

00:40:07.715 --> 00:40:11.920
45 years which is as far as we
projected.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.630
If you look at--you know the
big cities Shanghai,

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:18.681
Beijing and China,
just pick almost any name and

00:40:18.681 --> 00:40:23.768
go to an almanac and you'll see
there's so many mega million

00:40:23.768 --> 00:40:27.132
cities in China that--
cities even that I've never

00:40:27.132 --> 00:40:28.804
heard of,
when you look up their

00:40:28.804 --> 00:40:31.842
population, they're in the
millions and a place like New

00:40:31.842 --> 00:40:34.329
York with seven million people
is nothing.

00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:38.708
Sweden, where I lived in Sweden
for a while, has like seven to

00:40:38.708 --> 00:40:40.360
eight million people.
 

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.681
New York City has seven to
eight million people,

00:40:45.681 --> 00:40:52.704
cities in China that's a small
town almost, and India's not far

00:40:52.704 --> 00:40:53.949
behind.
 

00:40:53.949 --> 00:40:58.402
People in the United States
generally don't have much of an

00:40:58.402 --> 00:41:01.550
idea of what poverty really
looks like.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.407
One of the best descriptions of
this comes from Bill Ryerson who

00:41:05.407 --> 00:41:07.920
is going to be a guest lecturer
later,

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.420
and he describes flying into
Bombay,

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.045
and this is again a few years
back but in this period of

00:41:14.045 --> 00:41:16.719
extreme population explosion
that we're talking about.

00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:19.802
He goes to the airport,
and the airport is way outside

00:41:19.802 --> 00:41:22.070
the city as all airports have to
be,

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:26.197
and by the international flight
schedules they come in early in

00:41:26.197 --> 00:41:27.130
the morning.
 

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.179
He starts driving in and almost
immediately,

00:41:29.179 --> 00:41:33.097
at the airport,
he starts seeing poor people

00:41:33.097 --> 00:41:36.494
begging,
on the street you see shanty's

00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:38.650
that people are living in.
 

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:42.693
When he comes into the denser
places people start begging and

00:41:42.693 --> 00:41:46.199
you see very commonly a mother
holding an infant,

00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:48.860
and you can look the infant is
clearly nearly dead,

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.760
and the mother's 'please give
me something,

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.626
anything so that I can keep
this child alive until

00:41:54.626 --> 00:41:57.320
tomorrow,' and there's one after
the other,

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.989
after the other and it gets
denser.

00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:01.639
And then the sun comes up and
it gets warm,

00:42:01.639 --> 00:42:06.108
India's generally a rather warm
country and there's all these

00:42:06.108 --> 00:42:09.543
jitney's and motorbikes,
and trucks, small trucks

00:42:09.543 --> 00:42:13.280
putting around and they don't
have good catalytic converters,

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.804
those are expensive because a
lot of them have platinum in

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:18.159
them,
so they produce a lot of

00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:23.407
pollution and the air gets very
thick with this black smoke very

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.806
early--
black soot whatever you want to

00:42:25.806 --> 00:42:29.039
call it in the early morning so
you're not breathing fresh air.

00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:32.329
And then of course they have no
toilets around,

00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:35.630
and you're going to read some
articles about what that means,

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.750
and so very soon the stench of
human waste--

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.190
you're on a main street going
into the main city,

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:46.990
the stench of human waste comes
up at you and it smells terribly

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:52.056
and more and more beggars and
it's just absolutely heart

00:42:52.056 --> 00:42:56.199
wrenching description of what's
going on.

00:42:56.199 --> 00:43:00.655
And then you think that here
are millions and millions of

00:43:00.655 --> 00:43:05.271
people that will never have a
real house, they live in some

00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:07.659
cardboard shack somewhere.
 

00:43:07.659 --> 00:43:11.240
They'll never have a real job,
they'll never probably go to

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.280
the bathroom in a toilet,
and they may never even breathe

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.931
a breath of fresh air,
so poverty is really a very,

00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:26.166
very serious kind of situation
and you can go to lots and lots

00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:32.710
of cities in the world and see
similar kinds of descriptions.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:37.297
Now to do the numbers on this
poverty, so we compare it to the

00:43:37.297 --> 00:43:40.456
United States,
so General Motors before its

00:43:40.456 --> 00:43:41.809
recent demise.
 

00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:45.949
These numbers are three or four
years old,

00:43:45.949 --> 00:43:48.755
so they pay wages to the
workers, then they have health

00:43:48.755 --> 00:43:51.923
benefits which you've read about
as very high because they pay

00:43:51.923 --> 00:43:54.989
them for the rest of their life
and they pay pensions,

00:43:54.989 --> 00:43:58.039
so when you add all that up how
much lifetime they're going to

00:43:58.039 --> 00:44:00.840
pay for a worker and divide it
by the number of hours the

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.478
worker works,
it comes out for General Motors

00:44:05.478 --> 00:44:12.230
was $80 an hour and that was
somewhere near a maximum for

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.981
union wages,
not counting like airline

00:44:15.981 --> 00:44:19.190
pilots who get an awful lot more
than that.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:23.460
The upper middle class--that's
blue-collar workers at GM--

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:28.063
the upper middle class people
mostly in this room are going to

00:44:28.063 --> 00:44:31.159
be earning an awful lot more
than that.

00:44:31.159 --> 00:44:35.663
On the other hand is the
poverty level which for a family

00:44:35.663 --> 00:44:41.391
of a mother,
father, and three children is

00:44:41.391 --> 00:44:47.364
defined as $24,000 a year,
that's the 2006 number,

00:44:47.364 --> 00:44:48.619
the official U.S.
 

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:53.083
number which is $13.35 a day
per person, that's the poverty

00:44:53.083 --> 00:44:57.010
level as officially defined in
the United States.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:03.449
Wal-Mart, a worker,
a sales associate earns $6.10

00:45:03.449 --> 00:45:10.708
an hour or $12,000 a year--
$6.00 an hour--is $12,000 a

00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:17.945
year they are below poverty
level so the next step UP for a

00:45:17.945 --> 00:45:24.059
Wal-Mart worker is the official
poverty level.

00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:28.788
When you go to developing
countries you have to cut--to

00:45:28.788 --> 00:45:34.304
get any idea of a scale you have
to cut the Wal-Mart wages by at

00:45:34.304 --> 00:45:36.670
least a factor of four.
 

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:43.389
Wal-Mart makes its pants in El
Salvador and the pants sell for,

00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:48.304
in this particular article,
on this $16.95 in their United

00:45:48.304 --> 00:45:51.715
States stores,
and how much do you think the

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:55.340
women in El Salvador get to make
the pants, per pant?

00:45:55.340 --> 00:46:04.400
15 cents is the wage level that
they get for it.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:09.396
The UN reported that about half
of the world's workers,

00:46:09.396 --> 00:46:14.579
which is about 1.4 billion
people, earn less than $2.00 a

00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:15.320
day.
 

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.443
The average wage,
the median wage in the world is

00:46:20.443 --> 00:46:23.539
something like $2.00 a day.
 

00:46:23.539 --> 00:46:25.268
That's per wage earner,
not per family,

00:46:25.268 --> 00:46:28.882
not per person,
but per wage earner and that

00:46:28.882 --> 00:46:33.588
then has to be divided among
however many dependents that

00:46:33.588 --> 00:46:34.849
person has.
 

00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:36.394
I've told you that what the
U.S.

00:46:36.394 --> 00:46:38.489
sets as its official level for
poverty,

00:46:38.489 --> 00:46:42.387
every country in the world of
course gets to decide its own

00:46:42.387 --> 00:46:46.670
level of what poverty is,
and the official poverty level

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:52.518
in the poorest ten to 20--
poorest 20 countries is $1.25.

00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:56.016
You're only poor if you earn
less than a $1.25 per capita,

00:46:56.016 --> 00:46:56.630
per day.
 

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:02.422
In both China and India the
official poverty level is closer

00:47:02.422 --> 00:47:06.840
to $1.00 a day and this is at
2005 prices,

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.139
again statistics are always a
couple of years behind things.

00:47:11.139 --> 00:47:15.224
In rich places like Latin
America and Eastern Europe $2.00

00:47:15.224 --> 00:47:19.382
a day is the more appropriate
poverty level and that is for

00:47:19.382 --> 00:47:24.309
all the developing countries,
$2.00 a day is the median,

00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:27.949
their own self-defined poverty
level.

00:47:27.949 --> 00:47:31.762
Within each country and each
region there's great inequality

00:47:31.762 --> 00:47:34.911
of course in income,
so about 1/3 of the people in

00:47:34.911 --> 00:47:37.889
Latin America are living on less
than $2.00 a day,

00:47:37.889 --> 00:47:41.768
2/3 of the people of Pakistan
live on less than 2/3--

00:47:41.768 --> 00:47:45.608
$2.00 a day,
but more than 58% of the

00:47:45.608 --> 00:47:51.260
population in Kenya lives on
less than $1.00 a day;

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.210
Brazil 25% of the people on
less than $1.00 a day;

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:59.001
the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa
44% of the people on less than

00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:02.297
$1.00 a day and it's not only
these traditionally poor

00:48:02.297 --> 00:48:04.625
countries,
but in Romania,

00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:07.880
after the Soviet bloc fell
apart,

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.780
40% of the people live on less
than $1.00 a day.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:16.409
Indonesia had a government work
program so that people could get

00:48:16.409 --> 00:48:21.771
some kind of work and laborers
got $0.75 a day for five hours

00:48:21.771 --> 00:48:25.449
of work a day,
that's $0.15 an hour.

00:48:25.449 --> 00:48:29.213
I don't know how much time it
takes to sew Wal-Mart pants but

00:48:29.213 --> 00:48:32.443
maybe an hour,
probably less but--so $.15 an

00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:36.175
hour is a wage that for many
people in a place like

00:48:36.175 --> 00:48:38.849
Indonesia,
which has a lot of oil,

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:41.969
it's not overall necessarily a
poor place,

00:48:41.969 --> 00:48:49.380
$0.15 an hour for an hour's
work;

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:53.264
$0.75 a day and that's much
more than they can get

00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:58.018
working--getting agricultural
jobs around where they live.

00:48:58.018 --> 00:49:03.871
Here's a description from
Zambia, a nine-year-old boy,

00:49:03.871 --> 00:49:08.068
Alone Banda,
his job is to be beat rock

00:49:08.068 --> 00:49:10.940
fragments into powder.
 

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.085
He doesn't have a hammer,
he found a large steel bolt

00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:16.813
from some construction site,
he found a bolt,

00:49:16.813 --> 00:49:19.750
he grips in his bare hand and
pounds the rock with it.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:23.559
He takes raw rock,
takes a bolt that he found and

00:49:23.559 --> 00:49:29.639
pounds with it and he can fill--
it takes him about a--in a week

00:49:29.639 --> 00:49:35.963
he can fill about half a bag
with this powder which is used

00:49:35.963 --> 00:49:42.505
for construction and he gets
about $1.50 for the half bag and

00:49:42.505 --> 00:49:48.719
it's used for making concrete in
Kenya for instance.

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:50.210
Children start working at five
or six--

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:53.635
we saw--we talked about Charles
Dickens who so much of his

00:49:53.635 --> 00:49:57.059
writing was about children going
to work at age seven,

00:49:57.059 --> 00:49:59.492
while seven is old,
they go to five and six and

00:49:59.492 --> 00:50:01.820
they work as prostitutes even at
that age;

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.980
minors, construction workers,
pesticide sprayers,

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.139
all the kinds of dangerous and
miserable jobs.

00:50:08.139 --> 00:50:12.269
In Sub-Saharan Africa there's
something like 48 million

00:50:12.269 --> 00:50:15.559
children 14 and younger who are
working,

00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:20.925
and four years later it says,
by 2004 it had increased by 1.3

00:50:20.925 --> 00:50:24.954
million,
so the number of children

00:50:24.954 --> 00:50:32.264
working at these poverty level
jobs is increasing because the

00:50:32.264 --> 00:50:37.989
whole population is increasing
and so forth.

00:50:37.989 --> 00:50:41.309
This is the poverty rates
around the world and just

00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:44.833
compare--
this confirms the numbers that

00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:50.048
I'm telling you that these are
the headcount in number of

00:50:50.048 --> 00:50:54.081
millions,
the percent below poverty line

00:50:54.081 --> 00:50:58.099
at $1.25 a day,
less than $2.00 a day,

00:50:58.099 --> 00:51:02.476
and if you take out China,
China is still one of the

00:51:02.476 --> 00:51:05.070
poorest places when you add in
all the peasants,

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.710
it doesn't get--it gets
some--actually China makes it

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.340
worse,
when you add in China you have

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.409
a higher percentage at these
poverty levels,

00:51:14.409 --> 00:51:17.480
same for whatever poverty level
you want to work.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:24.269
These are the appropriate
poverty levels for developing

00:51:24.269 --> 00:51:25.780
countries.
 

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:30.219
Now, again you have the same
two ways of describing this--

00:51:30.219 --> 00:51:33.295
the absolute number of people
in this kind of poverty is

00:51:33.295 --> 00:51:35.621
growing up,
so as the whole population

00:51:35.621 --> 00:51:39.000
grows the number people in these
levels are growing up,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.349
yet there has been economic
progress in the sense that,

00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:47.125
as a percentage of people,
the poverty numbers are going

00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:49.474
down,
so there's more people in

00:51:49.474 --> 00:51:52.914
poverty, but there's a lesser
percentage of the total

00:51:52.914 --> 00:51:54.570
population in poverty.
 

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.891
Again, you can,
depending on your political

00:51:56.891 --> 00:51:59.208
orientation,
you can describe this as an

00:51:59.208 --> 00:52:02.737
increasingly bad situation where
more and more people are in this

00:52:02.737 --> 00:52:05.818
kind of poverty,
or a situation that is getting

00:52:05.818 --> 00:52:10.170
better because the percentage of
people in poverty is going down.

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:17.601
Now the miracle--so you've all
heard of the economic miracle in

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:20.360
East Asia especially.
 

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:26.340
Anybody come fairly recently
from China?

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.539
None of the students come from
China.

00:52:28.539 --> 00:52:31.190
Well the average income,
and again,

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:34.000
income how you define--of
course the Chinese don't earn

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.226
dollars so when you express it
in dollars there's a translation

00:52:37.226 --> 00:52:40.090
and the best way of doing it is
what's called PPP,

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.739
purchasing power parity.
 

00:52:41.739 --> 00:52:44.393
One way is to use the official
exchange rate,

00:52:44.393 --> 00:52:47.771
how many--they earn so many
Yuan and how many dollars can

00:52:47.771 --> 00:52:49.460
they buy with that Yuan?
 

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.608
That exchange rate,
as you know especially in

00:52:51.608 --> 00:52:54.342
China, is manipulated by the
government and is not a real

00:52:54.342 --> 00:52:54.880
number.
 

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.322
A number that makes the Chinese
income look more favorable and

00:52:58.322 --> 00:53:01.708
is closer to a real number is
what they call purchasing power

00:53:01.708 --> 00:53:02.329
parity.
 

00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:05.260
You say how much does a sack of
rice cost in China,

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.579
how much does it cost in the
United States,

00:53:07.579 --> 00:53:11.849
and you try to use a basket of
commodities appropriate to what

00:53:11.849 --> 00:53:15.699
the people in that country
actually use and say how much

00:53:15.699 --> 00:53:19.619
would that cost in dollars so
you can have a parity.

00:53:19.619 --> 00:53:23.617
On that kind of a level,
a Chinese peasant on average

00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:25.309
earns a $1.00 a day.
 

00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:31.802
The person--a $1.00 is the
average income in the Chinese

00:53:31.802 --> 00:53:33.809
peasant family.
 

00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:36.659
The jobs in the modern sector,
which means one of these

00:53:36.659 --> 00:53:39.298
manufacturing jobs,
and they migrate to some city,

00:53:39.298 --> 00:53:42.259
they live in these dorm rooms
where they're just stacked like

00:53:42.259 --> 00:53:44.847
cord wood,
and they basically have no free

00:53:44.847 --> 00:53:47.786
time and they're--
it's a miserable life but they

00:53:47.786 --> 00:53:49.030
double their income.
 

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:54.695
The economic miracle in Asia is
when people go from $1.00 a day

00:53:54.695 --> 00:53:57.907
to $2.00 a day,
and there's hundreds of

00:53:57.907 --> 00:54:01.280
millions of people,
you add up China and India,

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.663
hundreds of millions of people
who are desperate to earn $2.00

00:54:05.663 --> 00:54:08.630
a day;
it's a doubling of their income.

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:09.768
When you read these horrible
stories,

00:54:09.768 --> 00:54:13.130
horrible to our ears,
of how, especially women,

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:15.679
moving into the big cities
Guangdong,

00:54:15.679 --> 00:54:18.677
Canton or any of the big
cities, how they're living and

00:54:18.677 --> 00:54:20.900
the conditions they're working
under,

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.353
remember it represents a
doubling of their income and

00:54:23.353 --> 00:54:27.228
it's so much--
they can send most of that back

00:54:27.228 --> 00:54:33.367
to their home village and home
villages are all living on this

00:54:33.367 --> 00:54:35.179
kind of income.
 

00:54:35.179 --> 00:54:39.146
When we talk about poverty--we
will later talk about population

00:54:39.146 --> 00:54:43.112
in China - you must realize that
basically all of those workers

00:54:43.112 --> 00:54:46.501
who now have access to
moderately decent education can

00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:47.909
compete with us.
 

00:54:47.909 --> 00:54:51.179
There's very few jobs that we
can do and they can't do,

00:54:51.179 --> 00:54:54.675
and so we at up to $80 an hour
for a blue collar worker are

00:54:54.675 --> 00:54:58.170
basically in competition with
someone who's very happy--

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.869
and they grumble,
people working for GM grumble,

00:55:00.869 --> 00:55:04.083
and in some of their conditions
the grumbling could be quite

00:55:04.083 --> 00:55:07.143
fair--
but they're in competition with

00:55:07.143 --> 00:55:11.365
people earning $2.00,
that wish they would earn $2.00

00:55:11.365 --> 00:55:11.880
a day.
 

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:18.320
In places--this is not only our
competition but jewelry making,

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.449
very labor intensive--of course
countries with low wage rates

00:55:22.449 --> 00:55:26.510
attract very labor intensive
jobs and hand making of jewelry

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.849
is a very labor intensive job.
 

00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:32.369
Sure enough,
Bangkok was one of the centers

00:55:32.369 --> 00:55:35.385
of jewelry making,
and because it was the center

00:55:35.385 --> 00:55:37.159
and it requires a fair amount of
skill,

00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:41.586
the wages actually rose in
Bangkok for these jewelry makers

00:55:41.586 --> 00:55:46.550
and they got up to $8.00 a day
for a jewelry worker in Bangkok.

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:48.260
Guess what happened?
 

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.429
All the factories moved to
China, they're back down to

00:55:51.429 --> 00:55:54.480
$2.00 a day, a saving of 75% on
your labor costs;

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.869
of course they're going to do
it.

00:55:55.869 --> 00:55:59.500
Not only in China,
but Mexico, all the

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:03.096
maquiladoras,
the border between Texas and

00:56:03.096 --> 00:56:07.295
California and Mexico has a lot
of factories and because of

00:56:07.295 --> 00:56:11.349
various trade laws they can
assemble things and just ship

00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:16.199
them across the border with low
trade tariffs and everything,

00:56:16.199 --> 00:56:20.739
and they have been nearly wiped
out with jobs moving to China.

00:56:20.739 --> 00:56:22.585
Now of course,
for a while anyway,

00:56:22.585 --> 00:56:25.608
conditions were getting a
little bit better in China so

00:56:25.608 --> 00:56:26.840
the jobs moved to?
 

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.989
Anyone reading the newspapers?
 

00:56:28.989 --> 00:56:32.559
Who's now competing with China?
 

00:56:32.559 --> 00:56:35.525
India, at a high level,
but Vietnam,

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:40.608
Cambodia, places that are even
poorer than China are now even

00:56:40.608 --> 00:56:43.320
taking jobs away from China.
 

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:49.565
In Romania, which is one of the
poorest countries in Europe,

00:56:49.565 --> 00:56:55.813
the wages average about $83.00
a week, so $10.00 or $12.00 a

00:56:55.813 --> 00:56:56.659
day.
 

00:56:56.659 --> 00:57:00.809
When they got into the European
Union what did the Romanian

00:57:00.809 --> 00:57:01.739
workers do?
 

00:57:01.739 --> 00:57:05.864
They moved out to France,
Germany, England to get the

00:57:05.864 --> 00:57:10.704
higher wages that are available
there which left a lot of jobs

00:57:10.704 --> 00:57:15.387
unfilled in Romania where they
get $12.00 a day as I've just

00:57:15.387 --> 00:57:16.260
said.
 

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.909
What did the Romanians do?
 

00:57:18.909 --> 00:57:21.744
Imported Chinese,
who worked for less and filled

00:57:21.744 --> 00:57:24.463
the jobs,
there's an unlimited number of

00:57:24.463 --> 00:57:28.250
peasants in China that would
love to work in Romania under

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:31.581
almost any kind of conditions,
and they leave their husbands,

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:34.311
their children,
everybody is left home usually

00:57:34.311 --> 00:57:38.483
under the care of grandparents
who are too old themselves to

00:57:38.483 --> 00:57:39.050
work.
 

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:44.668
Keep that in mind,
abject poverty is a $1.00 a

00:57:44.668 --> 00:57:50.039
day, the economic miracle is
$2.00 a day.

00:57:50.039 --> 00:57:56.460
Okay, what does living look
like in these places?

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.846
We've been talking about
Bombay, and Shanghai,

00:57:59.846 --> 00:58:03.610
these are big places that
everybody knows about.

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:06.476
You'll never guess where this
is and you've probably never

00:58:06.476 --> 00:58:07.179
heard of it.
 

00:58:07.179 --> 00:58:09.139
This is the capital of
Mauritania.

00:58:09.139 --> 00:58:11.800
How many know where Mauritania
is?

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.130
Good, it's on the Atlantic
coast of Africa.

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:17.668
I should remember to always
make a slide--geography map

00:58:17.668 --> 00:58:19.110
slides but I didn't.
 

00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:22.666
It's on the Atlantic coast it
is--the capital is a place

00:58:22.666 --> 00:58:23.960
called Nouakchott.
 

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:28.007
Nouakchott is over there
somewhere and this is the

00:58:28.007 --> 00:58:32.550
suburbs of Nouakchott and what
it is is desert it's--

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:36.268
all of Mauritania is basically
desert,

00:58:36.268 --> 00:58:38.762
until it rolls into the ocean
in which case it becomes an

00:58:38.762 --> 00:58:39.119
ocean.
 

00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:44.891
In the desert all these people
live in shanties of any kind of

00:58:44.891 --> 00:58:48.960
construction material that they
can find.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.152
The national government,
the city government does not

00:58:52.152 --> 00:58:55.530
have the resources to deal with
these people at all,

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:59.349
so they get no sanitation,
they get no policing,

00:58:59.349 --> 00:59:02.972
they get no water,
there's just--these are called

00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:07.730
unplanned communities and they
sort of basically don't exist.

00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:09.639
What are they to the government?
 

00:59:09.639 --> 00:59:12.737
They're a source of problems
because very poor people,

00:59:12.737 --> 00:59:15.659
who have nothing to lose,
revolt every so often.

00:59:15.659 --> 00:59:18.190
They say you've got something,
we don't have it,

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:21.115
we want it, why is the
government not doing anything

00:59:21.115 --> 00:59:23.746
for us,
so this is a source of social

00:59:23.746 --> 00:59:26.347
discontent,
and the shanty towns are around

00:59:26.347 --> 00:59:29.271
every big city in the world are
great sources of social

00:59:29.271 --> 00:59:30.030
discontent.
 

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:32.974
What you see here is a road,
and I've just said they

00:59:32.974 --> 00:59:34.650
basically don't have roads.
 

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.777
What happens is that the
military in each of these

00:59:37.777 --> 00:59:41.800
countries wants to be sure to be
able to control the people,

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.230
so every so often they send in
a bulldozer,

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:48.440
you can sort of see another
road here off to the right.

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:52.422
Let me get a better one of
these--they just come in one

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:56.699
morning and the people are
asleep in their shanty's because

00:59:56.699 --> 00:59:58.840
they don't have any jobs.
 

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.210
And very early in the morning
they just hear this rumble and

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:05.639
they walk outside to find out
what it is and the bulldozer is

01:00:05.639 --> 01:00:08.952
two minutes away from their
house and they just go down and

01:00:08.952 --> 01:00:11.409
knock out anything that's in the
way.

01:00:11.409 --> 01:00:14.931
If you happen to be in the path
that the military bulldoze

01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:17.489
knocks down,
well sorry, sorry,

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:21.114
that's gone,
and then the soldiers can go

01:00:21.114 --> 01:00:23.380
into these situations.
 

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:28.489
The point being that these
enormous dense populations,

01:00:28.489 --> 01:00:31.809
which we associate with
Calcutta or Bombay,

01:00:31.809 --> 01:00:35.690
or Shanghai,
Canton, are in fact almost

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:40.389
everywhere in the world now
including this--

01:00:40.389 --> 01:00:45.179
this is where Nouakchott meets
the Atlantic Ocean.

01:00:45.179 --> 01:00:49.170
Here's the Atlantic Ocean
there, and what do they live on?

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:53.237
Well they live on fishing and
each of these little things

01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:56.070
here, if you can see,
is a fishing boat,

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:59.340
a little boat that they row out
and fish.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.369
Look at how many boats there
are, all trying to get an

01:01:02.369 --> 01:01:05.969
occasional fish and that's not a
terribly rich fishing ground of

01:01:05.969 --> 01:01:06.768
the world.
 

01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:10.085
It's very close to the equator
and there's no big upwelling of

01:01:10.085 --> 01:01:13.130
nutrients, there's not a great
big fishing down there.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:17.942
This is how the people have
been competing with each other

01:01:17.942 --> 01:01:21.150
for the few fish that are out
there.

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:24.179
Now--so that's the desert and
here is the jungle.

01:01:24.179 --> 01:01:29.615
This is Brazil in a place that
you may have heard of Serra

01:01:29.615 --> 01:01:32.094
Pelada,
peeled mountain or naked

01:01:32.094 --> 01:01:35.974
mountain, anybody who has heard
of it or seen pictures of this

01:01:35.974 --> 01:01:36.610
before?
 

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.400
One--a couple of people,
it's very well known,

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.717
so if you travel in Brazil all
the big cities again have shanty

01:01:42.717 --> 01:01:45.820
towns where people are desperate
for some kind of a job.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:49.559
Every so often a truck rolls
through and says,

01:01:49.559 --> 01:01:51.768
I have some jobs,
and people just pile in,

01:01:51.768 --> 01:01:54.280
and I've watched it,
and they don't ask how much,

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.809
where am I going,
what's the kind of work;

01:01:56.809 --> 01:02:00.005
a job is like a magic word,
it's like manna from heaven,

01:02:00.005 --> 01:02:01.460
they jump in the truck.
 

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:05.260
Well one of the places you're
taken to is this place,

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.000
and this place is way in the
middle of the jungle,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.440
like 1,000 miles from Rio or
Sao Paolo and what it is,

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.449
it's a mountain that they found
gold in.

01:02:14.449 --> 01:02:18.166
Normally if you've seen like
mining in the western United

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:22.014
States they have these steam
shovels which have a bucket as

01:02:22.014 --> 01:02:27.365
big as this whole room probably,
and each drag of the bucket

01:02:27.365 --> 01:02:33.059
pulls up hundreds of tons,
I don't know the actual numbers.

01:02:33.059 --> 01:02:38.331
In Serra Pelada,
human labor is cheaper than to

01:02:38.331 --> 01:02:40.739
buy a steam shovel.
 

01:02:40.739 --> 01:02:44.400
What each of these little dots
are is a person.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.063
What it is?
 

01:02:45.063 --> 01:02:48.260
This is a pit and they're
digging in the mud there,

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:51.746
they carry the mud up--the
sluicing is up here on the top

01:02:51.746 --> 01:02:54.577
where they have--
sluicing is--gold is heavier

01:02:54.577 --> 01:02:57.324
than soil so they take,
basically mud,

01:02:57.324 --> 01:03:01.050
dump it into someplace,
water runs over it,

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:04.507
washes away the mud,
and anything that sticks down

01:03:04.507 --> 01:03:07.820
falls heavy in little flakes or
tiny nuggets of gold;

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:11.230
that's the primitive way of
doing gold mining.

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:14.394
Just flow water over mud and
there's very,

01:03:14.394 --> 01:03:18.409
very low concentration you get
a gold flake there.

01:03:18.409 --> 01:03:21.679
What do these people--how do
they work?

01:03:21.679 --> 01:03:26.195
This is--they go down,
then climb--these are wooden

01:03:26.195 --> 01:03:29.163
ladders,
and another part they climb

01:03:29.163 --> 01:03:33.550
down the ladders and they have
burlap sacks on their back,

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:36.139
the cheapest kind of sack,
and they go down and with very

01:03:36.139 --> 01:03:38.219
primitive implements or maybe
their hands,

01:03:38.219 --> 01:03:41.268
they take the earth from the
bottom of the pit,

01:03:41.268 --> 01:03:44.485
they put it in these packs,
they put the pack on their back

01:03:44.485 --> 01:03:47.534
and they climb up the stairs and
dump it into the sluice

01:03:47.534 --> 01:03:49.530
apparatus and then go back down.
 

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:51.360
That's their whole life.
 

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.583
There are miserable wages,
they can't leave because

01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:56.029
they're in the middle of the
jungle, they have no way of

01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:58.030
getting back to any kind of
civilization.

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:00.518
The companies do indeed provide
prostitutes for them.

01:04:00.518 --> 01:04:03.215
This whole village is full of
prostitutes which are the women

01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:04.789
that come out the same
situation.

01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:08.418
Send a truck around and say
they have jobs for women,

01:04:08.418 --> 01:04:11.840
they jump on with little or no
questions asked.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.018
How is the whole thing kept
under control?

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:19.280
By soldiers with guns or
paramilitaries with guns,

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:25.152
and here is moderately typical,
one of the workers has not even

01:04:25.152 --> 01:04:29.106
the clothes on his back,
and there's huge numbers of

01:04:29.106 --> 01:04:30.920
them and they are kept in
control.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.168
In this particular instance the
things were looking like they

01:04:34.168 --> 01:04:36.010
were going to go out of control.
 

01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:45.211
Again, this is all around the
world you'll find situations

01:04:45.211 --> 01:04:47.150
like this.
 

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:59.230
Sometimes I talk
about--everywhere in the world.

01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.947
If you go up to Mt.
 

01:04:59.947 --> 01:05:01.909
Everest--we've got--what are
the ends of the earth?

01:05:01.909 --> 01:05:04.251
There's the deserts,
there's the jungles,

01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:05.128
and there's Mt.
 

01:05:05.128 --> 01:05:08.172
Everest and I just copied down
some statistics on Mt.

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:11.449
Everest, how much population
there is in the world.

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:16.637
There's--up high,
and I used to mountain climb a

01:05:16.637 --> 01:05:18.847
lot,
a single footstep can require

01:05:18.847 --> 01:05:21.597
eight breaths,
you take a step you pant eight

01:05:21.597 --> 01:05:23.858
times,
and people like me it would be

01:05:23.858 --> 01:05:25.539
a lot more than eight times.
 

01:05:25.539 --> 01:05:28.436
On one particular day,
and standard in the couple of

01:05:28.436 --> 01:05:31.846
months that you can climb it,
there's 500 climbers waiting to

01:05:31.846 --> 01:05:33.039
climb up Everest.
 

01:05:33.039 --> 01:05:37.440
The place is just littered with
dead bodies, it's littered with

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.215
oxygen bottles,
I mean Mt.

01:05:39.215 --> 01:05:43.190
Everest is kind of a congestion
zone, it looks like Grand

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:47.592
Central Station that have been
sort of cleared out of people on

01:05:47.592 --> 01:05:48.869
many days.
 

01:05:48.869 --> 01:05:52.567
There's 120 dead bodies
littering the top of Mt.

01:05:52.567 --> 01:05:57.050
Everest, so population has
gotten so extreme that it's not

01:05:57.050 --> 01:06:00.983
only the big cities,
it's basically everywhere that

01:06:00.983 --> 01:06:03.030
you look people are.
 

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:08.719
Let's just conclude today with
a little bit of future guessing.

01:06:08.719 --> 01:06:13.561
We know that fertility--so now
we have most of the world at a

01:06:13.561 --> 01:06:18.159
very high fertility rate,
population going gangbusters.

01:06:18.159 --> 01:06:22.250
Now can we dream up a scenario
where this gets better?

01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:24.590
It may get better,
it may not get better,

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:27.306
things may get worse until
there's some incredible crisis

01:06:27.306 --> 01:06:29.150
or things may stay as they are
now,

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:32.809
or things may coast to a soft
landing,

01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:33.289
we don't know.
 

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:40.030
Let's draw ourselves a scenario
for the soft landing situation.

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.768
One of the things that we know
is that there's very,

01:06:42.768 --> 01:06:45.257
very poor people,
these $1.00 a day people don't

01:06:45.257 --> 01:06:48.380
limit their births and the exact
reason for it we'll discuss

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:48.909
later.
 

01:06:48.909 --> 01:06:50.369
A lot of it has to do with
education,

01:06:50.369 --> 01:06:52.786
that they don't--a lot of
things about how their bodies

01:06:52.786 --> 01:06:55.737
work they don't understand,
so they're afraid of modern

01:06:55.737 --> 01:06:59.628
contraception,
a lot of issues which we will

01:06:59.628 --> 01:07:00.539
discuss.
 

01:07:00.539 --> 01:07:04.398
We observe around the world
that some increase in standard

01:07:04.398 --> 01:07:06.768
of living has to take place
for--

01:07:06.768 --> 01:07:12.510
before people start being
willing and want to limit their

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:13.739
fertility.
 

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:17.255
Let's take the minimum
situation, let's say someone

01:07:17.255 --> 01:07:20.699
gets one of these $2.00 a day
jobs and that's--

01:07:20.699 --> 01:07:24.469
then they start thinking
differently about themselves in

01:07:24.469 --> 01:07:26.324
the world,
they may be in the city where

01:07:26.324 --> 01:07:28.782
they get some education,
some awareness of what's going

01:07:28.782 --> 01:07:31.061
on in the world,
they want to limit their

01:07:31.061 --> 01:07:34.418
population so let's say that we
go from $1.00 a day to $2.00 a

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:36.505
day,
that's incredibly optimistic

01:07:36.505 --> 01:07:40.090
that $2.00 a day is sufficient
but you'll see what-- where I'm

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:40.619
going.
 

01:07:40.619 --> 01:07:42.829
That's a doubling of income of
the poor people.

01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:45.530
Again, something like a third
of the people on earth are in

01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:49.681
this $1.00 to $2.00 a day range,
so you double their income and

01:07:49.681 --> 01:07:54.809
all of sudden miracles happen
and population stops growing,

01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:57.739
not real, way overly optimistic.
 

01:07:57.739 --> 01:08:01.639
Another thing that we know is
that when incomes around the

01:08:01.639 --> 01:08:05.811
world rise the poor people have
the smallest rise and the rich

01:08:05.811 --> 01:08:08.070
people have the biggest rise.
 

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:10.965
If the small people are
doubling their income,

01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:13.989
what is the average of the
whole world doing?

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.889
It's going to be much then
doubling.

01:08:15.889 --> 01:08:18.743
Again, you can pick--I'm sure
economists have these numbers,

01:08:18.743 --> 01:08:21.260
I don't have them,
you can pick whatever you want.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:24.582
If in order to raise most of
the world from $1.00 a day to

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:28.136
$2.00 a day you need to double
their income and does the whole

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:31.109
world rise by more than 2 times
maybe 3 times,

01:08:31.109 --> 01:08:33.930
but we can pick any number that
we want.

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:37.009
I've told you two facts,
that the population of the

01:08:37.009 --> 01:08:40.457
world is for sure going to
increase by something like 50%

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:42.859
before, if, and when it
stabilizes.

01:08:42.859 --> 01:08:47.689
We can sort of see ballpark a
50% increase coming.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:51.988
Now, but this average standard
of living has to at least

01:08:51.988 --> 01:08:54.132
double,
and probably triple or

01:08:54.132 --> 01:08:57.788
quadruple, or again pick almost
whatever number you want,

01:08:57.788 --> 01:09:02.149
so at the minimum of doubling
the world's per capita income,

01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:06.908
50% more people are doubling
the income means a three--

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:10.993
that the gross economy,
well it has to triple because

01:09:10.993 --> 01:09:13.819
you have 1.5 time as many
people,

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:17.648
each earning twice as much,
that's a tripling of the world

01:09:17.648 --> 01:09:18.319
economy.
 

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:22.310
If you want to say that the
world--that to double the income

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:26.029
of poor people you have to
triple the world economy,

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:29.500
then that's three times more or
four and half times as much.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.953
Basically we're looking at a
optimistic scenario for the

01:09:32.953 --> 01:09:36.594
future where we come to a soft
landing and then in order to

01:09:36.594 --> 01:09:40.487
come to a soft landing we have
to have the economy of the world

01:09:40.487 --> 01:09:43.887
increase by a factor of three,
by a factor of four,

01:09:43.887 --> 01:09:47.970
four and a half,
five, six, somewhere in that

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:49.970
range of numbers.
 

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:53.988
Now technology--the improvement
of technology allows us to grow

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:56.212
our income with--
a somewhat less than

01:09:56.212 --> 01:09:58.100
proportionate increase in
resources,

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.747
and again, you can make a wild
guess about how much technology

01:10:01.747 --> 01:10:05.217
will improve in the future so
that we can double our income

01:10:05.217 --> 01:10:09.046
without quite doubling the drain
on world's sources or the amount

01:10:09.046 --> 01:10:12.708
of pollution we put it into,
or the amount of carbon dioxide

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.520
we put into it.
 

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:17.372
We're looking at this enormous
increase in order to come to a

01:10:17.372 --> 01:10:20.405
soft landing,
we're looking at this at least

01:10:20.405 --> 01:10:24.572
a tripling of the world economy,
and something like a tripling

01:10:24.572 --> 01:10:28.648
of the pollution in the world,
the carbon dioxide in the

01:10:28.648 --> 01:10:31.988
world, the use of resources in
the world.

01:10:31.988 --> 01:10:36.480
Most people believe that we're
at the limit of what the earth

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.550
can cope with in terms of the
economy,

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:41.609
which is basically how much
we're taking out of the earth.

01:10:41.609 --> 01:10:45.042
We're at the limit right now
but with population we're not

01:10:45.042 --> 01:10:48.051
going to have a soft landing
unless we triple that,

01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:50.038
at least minimum triple that.
 

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:55.940
That's the significance of this
population issue that can the

01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:02.038
earth cope with the tripling of
the economic activity on it?

01:11:02.038 --> 01:11:04.815
I left my crystal ball home so
you're going to--you are

01:11:04.815 --> 01:11:07.850
definitely going to find out the
answer to that question.

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:10.970
Okay, next time we will
continue.

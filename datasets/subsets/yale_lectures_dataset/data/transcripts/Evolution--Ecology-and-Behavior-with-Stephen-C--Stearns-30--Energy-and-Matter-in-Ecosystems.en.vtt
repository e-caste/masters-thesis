00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.585
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:09.010
Now we're going to talk about a
different kind of ecology.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.882
We're going to talk about the
flow of energy and matter

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:13.000
through ecosystems.
 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.329
Up until now we have been
dealing mostly with the

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:22.380
biological interactions of
organisms with each other,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.660
with organisms of other
species, and with some

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.246
physiological ecology where
they're dealing with the

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:30.490
physical and chemical problems
presented by the environment.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.632
But now we're going to look at
the energy and flow of materials

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:41.075
through ecosystems and biomes,
and in the world as a whole,

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:46.003
as a paradigm that's driven
primarily by physics and

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:47.260
chemistry.
 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.375
Now there are differences
between ecosystem and community

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:54.315
ecology, and I think that
this--you know,

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:57.770
some of this is a little bit
light-hearted;

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.590
some of it is dead serious.
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.227
So in ecosystem ecology,
one is primary concerned about

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:08.992
the flow of matter and energy,
and in community ecology

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:11.819
primarily with inter-specific
interactions.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.680
The paradigm here is
thermodynamics.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.418
So the mass balance equations,
the second law,

00:01:18.418 --> 00:01:22.420
entropy increases,
things like that.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.739
Here the issues are primarily
competition, predation and

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:28.390
history, and space.
 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.930
Okay?
 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.677
The kinds of measurements that
get made are physical,

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:35.849
chemical and geological here,
and they're biological here.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.274
So you don't see Latin names
and you don't see species names

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:42.861
in ecosystem ecology;
and they are definitely present

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:46.060
and they're important in
community ecology.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.507
The way that scientists chunk
reality in order to make it

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:53.050
manageable is quite different.
 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.545
In ecosystem ecology,
they worry about ecosystem

00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:58.200
compartments and stuff that
moves between them,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.903
and in community ecology they
worry mostly about species

00:02:01.903 --> 00:02:05.269
abundances and how it changes in
time and space.

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:09.199
So the connection here is
primarily to the biosphere.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:15.075
Here people are looking upward
at larger, more complicated,

00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:19.436
bigger kinds of things;
and in the community ecology

00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:22.762
they're mostly looking downward
at how the community

00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:26.283
interactions are driving the
population dynamics of the

00:02:26.283 --> 00:02:27.848
individual species.
 

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:32.639
So the connection here is to
biology and the connection here

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.940
is to geology.
 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.693
And the two things definitely
connect to each other,

00:02:37.693 --> 00:02:38.210
okay?
 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.348
So they have strong
implications for each other.

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:45.537
But, as you know,
academic specialties themselves

00:02:45.537 --> 00:02:47.649
evolve,
and people develop different

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.348
paradigms and different language
for dealing with problems,

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:54.960
and they have tended to remain
isolated from one another,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.286
and, unfortunately,
sometimes they have even tended

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:02.444
to denigrate one another,
although they're both perfectly

00:03:02.444 --> 00:03:05.628
valid ways of trying to analyze
the world;

00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:10.120
they're really just trying to
answer different questions.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.451
So today what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to outline

00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:16.784
energy flow, cycles of materials
and biogeochemical cycles

00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:18.128
through ecosystems.
 

00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:22.098
I'm dealing with it at a fairly
descriptive level.

00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:31.150
There are methods of making
this paradigm very quantitative.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.931
And if you get interested in
it, really the place to go is

00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:36.770
geology.
 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.229
Ruth Blake does this kind of
thing.

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.270
She's a biogeochemist in
geology.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.204
This is a part of the world
that has important implications

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:50.287
for global warming,
and which is driven mostly by

00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:52.840
things that have one cell.
 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.680
Okay?
 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.082
Whether they're algae or
bacteria, they are the main

00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:06.599
transducer between life and
geology.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.568
Now what is an ecosystem?
 

00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:11.824
Well it's one of those sort of
abstract terms that gets

00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:14.358
operationalized in a lot of
different ways,

00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:16.709
depending on who's doing the
study.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.834
But generally speaking it's the
organisms in a particular place,

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:24.762
plus the physical and chemical
environment with which they're

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:25.810
interacting.
 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.129
And it's often a local example
of some kind of biome.

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.610
Okay?
 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.244
So it could be a local chunk of
tundra, a local chunk of

00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:34.250
rainforest, a pond.
 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.269
It could be an upwelling area
off Peru.

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:41.839
It could be an alpine forest.
 

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:45.220
It could be a lot of different
things.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.180
And people study how energy
flows,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.682
and so the paradigm basically,
at least for things that are in

00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:56.521
the part of the planet that are
driven by the primary

00:04:56.521 --> 00:05:00.704
productivity of plants,
it starts with photosynthesis,

00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:04.156
and the annual production is
usually determined by

00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:09.048
temperature and moisture;
certainly for terrestrial

00:05:09.048 --> 00:05:10.449
ecosystems.
 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.514
Left out of this description is
all of the chemosynthetic

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:19.110
activity which occurs in deep,
black, dark water at mid-ocean

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.139
ridges,
and which is occurring in the

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.636
subterranean part of the
biosphere that goes down- up to

00:05:26.636 --> 00:05:31.029
say five or ten kilometers,
where there are bacteria that

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.019
are living deep in the ground.
 

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:36.642
And actually the pervasive
influx of life,

00:05:36.642 --> 00:05:40.973
into the subterranean
environment, is an important

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:45.040
part in the biogeochemistry of
the planet;

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.379
that's not covered here.
 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.786
If we look around by,
just by surface area,

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:57.420
the planet's about 65% open
ocean;

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.706
it's about 5% continental shelf;
desert's about 5%--that's

00:06:01.706 --> 00:06:05.144
extreme desert,
okay, that's just about nothing

00:06:05.144 --> 00:06:08.706
on the surface;
semidesert, so Sahel,

00:06:08.706 --> 00:06:13.036
that kind of area,
about almost 3Â½,

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:15.759
4%;
3% tropical rainforest;

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.250
and so forth.
 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.779
The idea here is you can take
the planet and you can define

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.920
different categories of the way
things live on it,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.100
just by surface area,
and break it down,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.670
and it looks like this.
 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.170
So here, if you were just to
look at that,

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.901
you would say, "Well,
open ocean, continental shelf,

00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:39.730
desert and rainforest are the
main biomes on the planet."

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.360
That's just by surface area.
 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.339
If you look at net primary
production per square meter,

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.920
you get a totally different
view.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.790
Okay?
 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.543
So this is just by surface
area, and this is by primary

00:06:52.543 --> 00:06:54.629
production per square meter.
 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:07:00.279
Look at how lousy the open
oceans are.

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.939
Open oceans are deserts.
 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.100
Why are open oceans deserts?
 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.879
Student:  No fresh water.
 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:07.639
Prof: What?
 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:08.399
Student:  No fresh water.
 

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:10.613
Prof: No,
it's not that there's no fresh

00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:11.000
water.
 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.055
What do you need if you're
going to make an ecosystem

00:07:14.055 --> 00:07:14.819
productive?
 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.980
Student:  Zooplankton
&gt;.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.879
Prof: They need
nutrients.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:19.120
Where are they going to get it?
 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.920
Student:  Weathering
or--

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.653
Prof: They could get it
from weathering or they could

00:07:23.653 --> 00:07:24.360
get it from upwelling.
 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.540
Where does upwelling occur?
 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.028
Student: On a costal
reef.

00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:28.699
Prof: Yeah,
continental margins.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.985
Get out in the middle of the
ocean and there's actually a

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:35.860
tremendous amount of fertilizer
there but it's five miles down,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.199
three to five miles down,
and you just can't get it up.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.822
It's sealed off,
because the top of the ocean is

00:07:41.822 --> 00:07:44.279
warm and the bottom of the ocean
is cold,

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:46.487
and there's no way that cold
water can come up through warm

00:07:46.487 --> 00:07:48.769
water,
unless you have Coriolis force

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:51.550
or wind or something like that
driving it.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.170
So that's why the open oceans
are deserts.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.047
You'll notice that tropical
rainforests are highly

00:07:57.047 --> 00:07:58.810
productive per square meter.
 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.319
In general forests are pretty
productive.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:03.610
Swamps and streams are very
productive.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.591
Algal beds and reefs are quite
productive, and so are

00:08:07.591 --> 00:08:08.509
estuaries.
 

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:11.930
So if you want to go someplace
where you're--

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.860
you know, you're a naturalist,
you like creepy-crawlies,

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.358
you want frogs in your pocket,
you want to see something new

00:08:17.358 --> 00:08:20.589
for Christmas,
you go to these places;

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:25.879
that's where you'll see a lot
of stuff.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:28.569
Okay?
 

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:33.023
So right there you already know
where the prospecting is good,

00:08:33.023 --> 00:08:36.090
if you like to see lots of
biodiversity.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.432
Now if you look at percent
contribution to global primary

00:08:40.432 --> 00:08:43.782
production,
the open oceans again crop up,

00:08:43.782 --> 00:08:47.928
and that is because there's
just so darn much of them.

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:50.695
If you're out there in space,
looking at the world,

00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:53.904
you realize that you can fit
all of the continents into the

00:08:53.904 --> 00:08:56.291
Pacific Ocean;
it's bigger than all the

00:08:56.291 --> 00:08:57.740
continents put together.
 

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.735
And most of it is open ocean;
most of it is low primary

00:09:00.735 --> 00:09:02.149
productivity open ocean.
 

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:04.868
But there's just so darn much
of it that on the planetary

00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:07.149
scale it's making a pretty good
contribution.

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:10.298
And the tropical rainforests
are big enough so that even

00:09:10.298 --> 00:09:13.450
though they're only 3 and a half
or 4% of the globe,

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.488
they have such high primary
productivity that they're

00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:17.950
kicking in quite a bit.
 

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.591
And the others,
even though they are

00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:24.817
productive, occupy such a small
portion of the globe that

00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:27.759
they're not contributing that
much.

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:32.520
Okay, so this is an overall
view of energy flow on the

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.371
planet, at least for the
photosynthetically driven part

00:09:37.371 --> 00:09:38.990
of the planet.
 

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.529
The sun is sending in the
energy.

00:09:43.529 --> 00:09:47.578
And by the way,
any idea of roughly how much of

00:09:47.578 --> 00:09:53.037
the sunlight that comes into the
planet is actually captured by

00:09:53.037 --> 00:09:53.830
life?
 

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.110
How efficient has the planet
become at capturing photons?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:06.947
Does it capture 50%,
10%, 1%, 1/10^(th) of a

00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:08.399
percent?
 

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.269
A guess?
 

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:11.990
How many for 50% Hands up.
 

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.029
How many for 10%?
 

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:14.899
Hands up.
 

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:15.879
A couple.
 

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:16.860
How many for 1%?
 

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.908
Hands up.
 

00:10:18.908 --> 00:10:20.769
How many for 1/10^(th) of a
percent?

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:21.700
Hands up.
 

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.070
See the grad students think
it's a 1/10^(th) of a percent.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.269
It's a small amount.
 

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:29.399
I don't know the precise
number, but it's down between

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:30.700
1/10 and 1% I think.
 

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.514
So even after 3.5 billion years
of evolutionary history,

00:10:34.514 --> 00:10:38.398
the planet has not become
terribly efficient at capturing

00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:39.298
sunlight.
 

00:10:39.298 --> 00:10:43.813
Freeman Dyson has got this
definition of different kinds of

00:10:43.813 --> 00:10:45.058
civilizations.
 

00:10:45.058 --> 00:10:47.758
One of the stages of
civilization would be when you

00:10:47.758 --> 00:10:50.833
can put a sphere around an
entire solar system and capture

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.964
all of the photons coming off of
the sun and harness it for

00:10:53.964 --> 00:10:55.529
running a civilization.
 

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:58.908
That would capture the entire
solar output.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:03.200
Well, you know,
we are a tiny little dot on the

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.397
face of the sun,
and we're taking 1/10^(th) to

00:11:07.397 --> 00:11:09.450
1% of its photons.
 

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.697
So this isn't a very big number
when you look at the solar

00:11:12.697 --> 00:11:13.210
output.
 

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:18.154
What happens is that basically
algae, primarily algae,

00:11:18.154 --> 00:11:22.072
but also trees and all other
larger plants,

00:11:22.072 --> 00:11:24.220
are capturing this.
 

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.120
Then the herbivores are eating
the plants.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.288
The primary carnivores are
eating the herbivores.

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:33.408
The secondary carnivores are
eating the primary carnivores.

00:11:33.408 --> 00:11:37.825
What do you think is in the red
arrows, going off to the

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:39.029
detritivores?
 

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:44.668
In simple Anglo-Saxon,
four letter words,

00:11:44.668 --> 00:11:50.309
what do you think is in the red
arrow?

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:52.200
Shit and corpses.
 

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.309
Okay?
 

00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:54.340
That's the red arrow.
 

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.759
It's pretty big.
 

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:59.471
Any idea what Africa would look
like if you got rid of the dung

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.070
beetles?
 

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:09.360
You would need hip-waders;
especially in the Serengeti or

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.700
any of the big national parks.
 

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.799
A pile of elephant dung is
about this big.

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:15.840
Okay?
 

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.408
So that's what's going off in
here.

00:12:18.408 --> 00:12:21.250
We are deeply indebted to dung
beetles.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.370
&gt;
 

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.820
Believe me.
 

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.080
And to fungi.
 

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.470
What's going off here is
respiration.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.330
So that's energy.
 

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.058
You know, you all use it up
every day.

00:12:31.058 --> 00:12:33.871
You're using up somewhere
between oh 3500 and 5000

00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:36.455
calories a day,
depending on whether you're on

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:37.889
a sports team or not.
 

00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:40.418
And so that's what's going off
out here.

00:12:40.418 --> 00:12:45.350
And this is coming off of every
level here.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.279
Okay?
 

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:50.832
So you can think of this as
what's left over and this is the

00:12:50.832 --> 00:12:55.309
flow of all that ATP driven
stuff on the planet surface.

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:00.120
Now how does that look in space?
 

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.235
Well if you look at tons of
carbon fixed per hectare per

00:13:05.235 --> 00:13:09.086
year,
where green is a lot and yellow

00:13:09.086 --> 00:13:13.288
is a little,
you can see that the forests

00:13:13.288 --> 00:13:15.490
are really important.
 

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.330
Okay?
 

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.376
And the closer you get to the
equator and the wetter it gets,

00:13:21.376 --> 00:13:25.019
the more efficient the forests
are at fixing carbon.

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:28.250
This is for the terrestrial
part of the world.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.226
If you could put the reefs in,
they would be fixing carbon,

00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:37.857
and they would be withdrawing
it on kind of a different

00:13:37.857 --> 00:13:39.058
timescale.
 

00:13:39.058 --> 00:13:44.107
Because the tropical forests,
although they fix a lot of

00:13:44.107 --> 00:13:48.881
carbon, don't actually cleanse
the atmosphere of CO2,

00:13:48.881 --> 00:13:51.820
at least not at equilibrium.
 

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.110
Why not?
 

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:00.918
Student: As they're
&gt;

00:14:00.918 --> 00:14:03.190
they're actually they're also
respiring.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.450
Prof: They are
respiring, yes.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.360
What happens to a tree when it
dies?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.600
Student:  It releases a
lot of carbon.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.460
Prof: It releases a lot
of carbon, right?

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.684
So in fact you could grow up a
big forest but you only get the

00:14:13.684 --> 00:14:16.168
carbon benefit the first time
you grow it up;

00:14:16.168 --> 00:14:18.875
after that it goes into an
equilibrium where the trees are

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:21.629
falling down and the logs are
rotting and they're releasing

00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:23.340
carbon back into the atmosphere.
 

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.787
So yes, you can temporarily fix
a lot of carbon by planting a

00:14:28.787 --> 00:14:31.969
lot of trees,
but in the long run it's not a

00:14:31.969 --> 00:14:34.908
stable solution because those
trees get burned up;

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:37.871
they either get literally
burned up, or they get

00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:41.653
metabolized by the detritivores,
and the detritivores put the

00:14:41.653 --> 00:14:43.668
carbon back into the system.
 

00:14:43.668 --> 00:14:47.129
What happens when you fix
carbon in a reef?

00:14:52.168 --> 00:14:59.099
You make limestone,
and limestone sticks around for

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:01.038
a long time.
 

00:15:01.038 --> 00:15:06.845
And if you take a big reef and
you slam it into a continent

00:15:06.845 --> 00:15:11.250
with a tectonic collision,
you get marble.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.518
So the marble quarries of the
world are the fixed carbon of 3

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:17.440
to 500 million years ago.
 

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.634
So you can actually tie up
carbon for a much longer period

00:15:20.634 --> 00:15:23.717
more stably by putting it into
limestone than you can by

00:15:23.717 --> 00:15:25.120
putting it into wood.
 

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.905
However, there are also some
important things about different

00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:35.440
kinds of forests and how well
they can grow,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.847
and a lot depends upon whether
you have a deciduous tree or a

00:15:40.847 --> 00:15:41.750
conifer.
 

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.663
And if you look around the
world at the different kinds of

00:15:45.663 --> 00:15:48.124
forests,
it turns out that the

00:15:48.124 --> 00:15:53.154
coniferous forests can actually
fix more carbon per year than a

00:15:53.154 --> 00:15:57.375
deciduous forest,
basically because they keep on

00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:01.817
growing at times when the
deciduous trees have dropped

00:16:01.817 --> 00:16:03.159
their leaves.
 

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:04.340
Okay?
 

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:09.664
So their primary productivity,
in terms of tons of carbon per

00:16:09.664 --> 00:16:13.926
hectare per year,
is about 1 and a half that of a

00:16:13.926 --> 00:16:15.788
deciduous forest.
 

00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:20.899
And I mention that because
there are--

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:24.539
these are the kinds of
broad-scale biological

00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:29.423
differences that are important
to pay attention to if you're

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.740
doing ecosystem ecology.
 

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.942
There are some that you can
ignore, but this is a big

00:16:34.942 --> 00:16:38.700
difference and it's something
that has to be kept track of.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.014
So I think you're getting an
idea of the sort of filter that

00:16:43.014 --> 00:16:47.111
ecosystem ecology places on the
details of other kinds of

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:47.990
biology.
 

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.336
Ecosystem ecology,
it's going to be interested in

00:16:50.336 --> 00:16:53.270
keeping track of things that
make big differences to the flow

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.336
of energy and materials,
and it's going to say we

00:16:56.336 --> 00:16:58.740
probably want to ignore the
rest,

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.269
just because life is complex
enough as it is.

00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:02.230
Okay?
 

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.940
So this is really what's
driving that.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.422
And that's why,
if you go back and you look at

00:17:07.422 --> 00:17:10.068
those biomes,
you will see that when people

00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:13.364
make biome classifications,
they keep track of whether

00:17:13.364 --> 00:17:15.803
they're dealing with a
coniferous forest or a deciduous

00:17:15.803 --> 00:17:19.298
forest,
and things like that.

00:17:19.298 --> 00:17:24.249
Okay, if you look across the
world at grasslands,

00:17:24.249 --> 00:17:30.230
forests and the open ocean,
you see a nice food pyramid.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.119
And the green is the
herbivores--excuse me,

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:36.974
the green is the producers,
the yellow is the herbivores,

00:17:36.974 --> 00:17:39.038
the red is the carnivores.
 

00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:44.151
And if you just look at
biomass, you will see that in

00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:48.868
grasslands you have a few big
fierce animals,

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:52.438
that are rare,
and then you've got a bunch of

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:56.170
grazing animals that are a bit
more common,

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.862
and there are more of them,
and then you've got a lot of

00:17:57.862 --> 00:17:59.582
plants;
pretty much the same in the

00:17:59.582 --> 00:18:00.009
forest.
 

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:03.710
Out in the open ocean it's
really quite different.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.759
You have a few large top
predators;

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:12.522
so these are the tuna and the
sharks and the whales and things

00:18:12.522 --> 00:18:13.460
like that.
 

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.385
Then you've got a big biomass
of herbivores,

00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:22.500
and then not too many- not too
much biomass of the algae,

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.509
in the open ocean.
 

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:27.921
If you look at the energy flow
for the grasslands and the

00:18:27.921 --> 00:18:31.089
forests, it's pretty similar to
the standing crop.

00:18:31.089 --> 00:18:32.200
This would be the standing crop.
 

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.013
This is how much energy
calories per square meter per

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.529
day is flowing through it.
 

00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:40.967
But in the open ocean something
is converting this kind of

00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:45.171
anomalous picture into a sort of
standard food pyramid,

00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:47.740
when you look at energy flow.
 

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.519
What's doing it?
 

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.920
What's the difference between a
grass and a single-celled alga?

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.400
Student: The algae are
more efficient.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.298
&gt;
 

00:19:11.298 --> 00:19:14.210
Prof: Well you're
getting at it.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.339
They are more efficient,
but they're more efficient in a

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:18.509
particular sense that makes a
big difference to rates.

00:19:18.509 --> 00:19:20.180
Okay?
 

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:25.250
This is the difference--this is
a still photo and this is a

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.950
movie.
 

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:26.990
Okay?
 

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.390
So there's--that's the
difference.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.339
It's a difference in rate.
 

00:19:31.339 --> 00:19:32.380
Yes?
 

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.680
Student:  Algae
reproduce a lot faster.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.890
Prof: That's basically
it, yes.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:39.958
A single celled alga can
probably have two generations

00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:44.294
per day and--
at least one per day--and maybe

00:19:44.294 --> 00:19:48.298
even in a warm estuary three per
day,

00:19:48.298 --> 00:19:52.016
whereas a grass is probably
going to be lucky to get through

00:19:52.016 --> 00:19:54.410
two or three generations per
season.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:54.930
Okay?
 

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.195
So there's a difference of
perhaps a hundredfold in the

00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:58.618
rate.
 

00:19:58.618 --> 00:20:03.971
And the things that are eating
them have a much,

00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:06.588
much longer lifespan.
 

00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:11.048
So down here what's going on is
that the algae,

00:20:11.048 --> 00:20:13.840
there are not so many of them,
but they're cranking over like

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.135
crazy,
and they're getting harvested

00:20:16.135 --> 00:20:19.500
like crazy by all of the
planktivores in the ocean.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.582
So the krill,
the copepods,

00:20:21.582 --> 00:20:25.025
everything that eats algae,
is grazing them,

00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:29.430
and that's keeping the algae at
a fairly low level.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.200
They're a long away from their
own carrying capacity.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.480
They're in exponential growth
rate almost all the time.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.019
So they're booming along,
and it doesn't take so much

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:43.105
standing crop to maintain a lot
more biomass because they are

00:20:43.105 --> 00:20:47.190
turning over and reproducing and
multiplying so quickly.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.329
So that is why you see this
dramatic shift.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.575
Okay, so that's a bit of the
overall description of the

00:20:55.575 --> 00:20:56.808
world's ecosystems.
 

00:20:56.808 --> 00:20:59.779
Now let's take a look at cycles
of matter.

00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:00.808
Okay?
 

00:21:00.808 --> 00:21:04.143
The main compartments are
oceans, fresh water,

00:21:04.143 --> 00:21:07.328
land and atmosphere,
and they are exchanging

00:21:07.328 --> 00:21:09.329
materials all the time.
 

00:21:12.828 --> 00:21:16.558
You're already familiar with
the upwelling patterns;

00:21:16.558 --> 00:21:20.588
I've mentioned that when I was
discussing the Coriolis force.

00:21:20.588 --> 00:21:24.241
So this is where the
nutrient-rich waters are coming

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:25.460
to the surface.
 

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.338
And in a place like the coast
of Peru,

00:21:28.338 --> 00:21:33.450
you have millions and billions
of seabirds,

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.344
that are eating billions and
trillions of anchovies and

00:21:37.344 --> 00:21:40.253
sardines,
that are feasting on trillions

00:21:40.253 --> 00:21:43.296
and quadrillions of shrimp,
that are eating algae,

00:21:43.296 --> 00:21:44.119
coming up there.
 

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:44.578
Okay?
 

00:21:44.578 --> 00:21:49.382
So you have the cold Humboldt
current coming up and bending

00:21:49.382 --> 00:21:52.373
offshore here,
heading out for the Galapagos,

00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:54.588
and as it's moving out towards
the west--

00:21:54.588 --> 00:21:56.068
in the Southern Hemisphere,
remember,

00:21:56.068 --> 00:21:58.670
it is coming up towards the
equator;

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.295
the equator has a greater
angular velocity than the

00:22:02.295 --> 00:22:06.586
southern part of South America,
and the water is getting kind

00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:10.169
of left behind by the planet,
as the planet pulls out this

00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:10.460
way.
 

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.432
And because you have a
continent here,

00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:15.526
there's no water that's left
there to flow over and replace

00:22:15.526 --> 00:22:15.900
it.
 

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.857
So the only place it can come
up from is the bottom,

00:22:18.857 --> 00:22:22.512
and it comes up from the bottom
and fertilizes this zone off the

00:22:22.512 --> 00:22:24.368
West Coast of South America.
 

00:22:24.368 --> 00:22:27.803
Well over the course of
hundreds of millions of years

00:22:27.803 --> 00:22:30.838
the seabirds that nest on
islands offshore,

00:22:30.838 --> 00:22:33.513
so that they can get away from
the predators that would their

00:22:33.513 --> 00:22:37.650
eggs on a continent,
have built up a huge deposit of

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.660
guano on the Chilean Islands.
 

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:46.579
And this was a matter of
international significance,

00:22:46.579 --> 00:22:52.615
prior to the First World War,
because nitrogen was so

00:22:52.615 --> 00:22:57.259
critical in the manufacture of
arms.

00:22:57.259 --> 00:22:59.288
You remember the Oklahoma City
bombing,

00:22:59.288 --> 00:23:02.459
when Timothy McVeigh simply
took nitrogen fertilizer and

00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:05.461
mixed it with diesel fuel,
and put it into a truck and

00:23:05.461 --> 00:23:06.450
blew up a building.
 

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.818
A lot of energy in nitrogen;
okay, nitrate, powerful stuff.

00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:14.108
And this is where the world
supply was.

00:23:14.108 --> 00:23:17.153
And, by the way,
that repeats at many other

00:23:17.153 --> 00:23:19.690
upwelling areas around the
globe.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:25.749
And just prior to World War
One, Haber and Bosch figured out

00:23:25.749 --> 00:23:30.680
a way of fixing nitrogen from
the atmosphere,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.445
as ammonia and urea--they did
it at high temperature and

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:38.550
pressure--
and that was actually what kept

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:44.650
Germany in the war between 1916
and 1918.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.380
Okay?
 

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.672
So the reason I am mentioning
this is that I'm trying to use a

00:23:50.672 --> 00:23:54.963
vivid example that shows you how
the flow of materials between

00:23:54.963 --> 00:23:58.412
different compartments and
ecosystems has actually

00:23:58.412 --> 00:24:01.858
influenced world history for
human culture.

00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:05.500
And in this case it was
basically the seabirds taking it

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.278
out of the ocean and putting it
on land;

00:24:08.278 --> 00:24:12.390
and putting it on in huge
quantities.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:16.632
So now there's about 100
million tons of nitrogen

00:24:16.632 --> 00:24:19.548
fertilizer produced every year.
 

00:24:19.548 --> 00:24:23.240
It's about 1% of global
industrial energy,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.009
and it sustains 40% of the
global human population.

00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:32.788
So these kinds of processes
actually are part of the

00:24:32.788 --> 00:24:37.848
substructure of our modern and
post-modern culture,

00:24:37.848 --> 00:24:43.180
and it gives you some feel for
an ecosystem service.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.285
Prior to the Haber-Bosch
process, this fixing of nitrogen

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:52.269
out of the atmosphere could only
be done by biological organisms,

00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:57.950
and this is an estimate really
of how big that ecosystem

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.500
function was.
 

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.140
Okay, so let's run through some
of these cycles.

00:25:07.009 --> 00:25:09.826
Almost all the nitrogen that's
on the surface of the planet is

00:25:09.826 --> 00:25:12.068
biologically inaccessible;
it's in the form of

00:25:12.068 --> 00:25:12.818
N_2.
 

00:25:12.818 --> 00:25:17.111
N_2 is a molecule
that is extremely difficult to

00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:18.088
react with.
 

00:25:18.088 --> 00:25:22.086
And there are--it can be
converted into something that's

00:25:22.086 --> 00:25:25.864
biologically accessible,
primarily by bacteria and by

00:25:25.864 --> 00:25:28.480
cyanobacteria and by lightening.
 

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.487
So if you go out and simply
have a lightening storm pass

00:25:33.487 --> 00:25:37.391
overhead,
and you compare the rain that

00:25:37.391 --> 00:25:41.417
you get out of it,
with and without lightening,

00:25:41.417 --> 00:25:45.819
in the five minutes or so after
a lightening strike directly

00:25:45.819 --> 00:25:47.883
overhead,
if you're holding a cup out

00:25:47.883 --> 00:25:50.108
there, you're going to be
getting nitrogen fertilizer.

00:25:50.108 --> 00:25:54.118
It'll be fairly dilute,
but it's over a huge area.

00:25:54.118 --> 00:25:58.666
Much more important are the
bacteria and cyanobacteria that

00:25:58.666 --> 00:26:01.490
can convert nitrogen into
nitrate.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.210
And most of that's going on in
the soil, okay?

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.509
So this is biological fixation.
 

00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:08.009
It's bringing it down into the
soil.

00:26:08.009 --> 00:26:11.626
It gets processed and
de-nitrified and goes back up as

00:26:11.626 --> 00:26:12.720
N_2.
 

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.470
There's some industrial
fixation;

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.000
the Bosch-Haber process is
doing that.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.538
This runs off,
gets into the ocean and

00:26:20.538 --> 00:26:22.740
fertilizes the ocean.
 

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:31.814
If we look at the impact of
nitrate and sulfate on human

00:26:31.814 --> 00:26:37.416
problems and on terrestrial
ecosystems, one of the big ones

00:26:37.416 --> 00:26:39.930
is acid precipitation.
 

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:46.924
So this stuff right here,
all of human industry and cars

00:26:46.924 --> 00:26:51.076
and so forth,
which in the United States has

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:55.167
been concentrated in an area
mostly roughly between Chicago

00:26:55.167 --> 00:26:58.912
and Pennsylvania,
right here, this area,

00:26:58.912 --> 00:27:02.519
because of the--
remember our Hadley cells and

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:06.173
the jet stream and the reason
that the air is flowing from

00:27:06.173 --> 00:27:08.608
west to east across the
continent--

00:27:08.608 --> 00:27:11.779
all of that emission is getting
picked up and it's getting

00:27:11.779 --> 00:27:15.338
dropped on lakes in Canada and
the Northeastern United States.

00:27:15.338 --> 00:27:19.203
So in 1955 the pH in this
region of the country,

00:27:19.203 --> 00:27:22.740
in freshwater bodies,
had dropped to 4.6;

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.318
that's starting to get pretty
acid.

00:27:26.318 --> 00:27:29.921
And by the way it was a much
bigger problem for a lake that

00:27:29.921 --> 00:27:33.460
was sitting on granite than for
a lake that was sitting on

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.328
limestone.
 

00:27:34.328 --> 00:27:36.815
Why would it be more of a
problem on granite than on

00:27:36.815 --> 00:27:37.400
limestone?
 

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.750
Student:  Limestone's
basic.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.289
Prof: Limestone's basic.
 

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:41.740
It's also a buffer.
 

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.339
So limestone will basically put
a lot of carbonate into the

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:46.828
water and buffer this.
 

00:27:46.828 --> 00:27:49.801
So this was a big problem,
and in fact some lakes were

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:51.990
losing all of their fish
populations.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.846
However, there were
improvements in air quality

00:27:56.846 --> 00:28:01.809
control around the country,
and this has spread,

00:28:01.809 --> 00:28:07.088
but in many places it's also
been ameliorated.

00:28:07.088 --> 00:28:10.000
I'd say it still remains a
serious problem,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.700
and it's a situation that also
causes international tensions,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.657
because basically Eastern
Canada is getting hammered by

00:28:18.657 --> 00:28:18.951
U.S.
 

00:28:18.951 --> 00:28:23.202
industrial and car emissions,
because the flow of materials

00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:27.307
around the planet does not
respect the arbitrary national

00:28:27.307 --> 00:28:30.460
boundaries that humans have
created.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.528
It's even worse in Europe.
 

00:28:32.528 --> 00:28:37.019
In Europe the industrial
production of Germany,

00:28:37.019 --> 00:28:40.250
which creates a huge load of
acid in the atmosphere,

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:44.118
gets dumped on Scandinavia,
which is old Scandinavian

00:28:44.118 --> 00:28:46.836
basalt shield;
so they don't really have any

00:28:46.836 --> 00:28:49.048
limestone buffer up there in
Scandinavia.

00:28:49.048 --> 00:28:53.814
And that's one of the issues
that gets talked a lot about in

00:28:53.814 --> 00:28:58.740
the European Union is how to
equalize these kinds of costs.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.534
Because basically Canada is
being treated as an externality

00:29:02.534 --> 00:29:05.477
by the United States,
and Scandinavia is being

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:08.160
treated as an externality by
Germany.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.430
So that sort of thing needs
conflict resolution.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.519
Okay, water.
 

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:23.491
The hydrological cycle is
critical because you can't grow

00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:28.045
plants without water,
and you can't grow humans

00:29:28.045 --> 00:29:30.519
without water either.
 

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.719
And as the human population has
gone up over five,

00:29:33.719 --> 00:29:37.375
and now through six billion,
fresh water on the planet is

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:39.400
becoming very,
very scarce.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.564
And, you know,
we think we have it tough in

00:29:41.564 --> 00:29:44.500
this country because Arizona
keeps screaming that it needs

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.320
more water from California,
and California says no,

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.916
we're going to divert the
Columbia River down to Los

00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:52.835
Angeles or something like that,
and the people that live in

00:29:52.835 --> 00:29:53.970
Oregon get all up in arms.
 

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.720
But that is nothing compared to
the problems of the Middle East

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.308
and North Africa,
where water is actually one of

00:30:01.308 --> 00:30:05.910
the ground- the basic reasons
for conflict among nations in

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.098
those areas.
 

00:30:07.098 --> 00:30:10.666
And if you doubt that,
look at where the dams are that

00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:13.964
Turkey has built on the
Euphrates and the Tigress,

00:30:13.964 --> 00:30:16.859
and what that means for Iraq
and Syria.

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:18.000
Okay?
 

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.230
Or look at all of the issues
surrounding the

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.771
Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
which are many and cultural and

00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:30.434
religious and many other things,
but they also have a lot to do

00:30:30.434 --> 00:30:31.288
with water.
 

00:30:31.288 --> 00:30:33.950
So the water cycle is really
quite critical.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.130
And I want to just mention a
couple of things about it.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:42.255
The standard issue with water
is that most of it's in the

00:30:42.255 --> 00:30:45.348
ocean, and it evaporates from
the ocean;

00:30:45.348 --> 00:30:47.880
of course, it evaporates more
when the oceans are warmer.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.848
Remember the El NiÃ±o
effect--

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:52.211
right?--when that warm water
from the Western Pacific flows

00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:53.880
back over towards the Eastern
Pacific,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.910
then the evaporation of the
oceans increases,

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.480
you get a lot more water in the
atmosphere,

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.088
and rainfall goes up,
from the Galapagos to Arizona,

00:31:02.088 --> 00:31:04.180
and right through to
Connecticut.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.490
So the oceans are a very
important source of evaporation.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.536
However evaporation off of
freshwater lakes is also

00:31:13.536 --> 00:31:15.900
significant,
and anyone who lives in

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.000
Rochester or Buffalo will tell
you just exactly how significant

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.798
it is,
after they've had a three-foot

00:31:20.798 --> 00:31:25.154
snowfall from lake effect snow--
right?--which is basically been

00:31:25.154 --> 00:31:27.420
driven by this process.
 

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.980
So the water goes up and it
cycles through the rivers,

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.240
back into the ocean,
and long-term basically the

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.500
amount going in equals the
amount going out,

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.829
and as long as the West
Antarctic ice sheet doesn't

00:31:40.829 --> 00:31:42.681
collapse,
or Greenland melts,

00:31:42.681 --> 00:31:45.740
the level of the ocean stays
about the same.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.223
By the way, the estimate on the
Antarctic ice sheets is that if

00:31:50.223 --> 00:31:53.480
the ones that are currently
grounded melt,

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.450
that means there's an ice sheet
that's offshore,

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.308
but it's resting on the ocean
bottom.

00:31:57.308 --> 00:32:00.042
And there are two big ones:
one is the Ross Sea ice shelf,

00:32:00.042 --> 00:32:02.872
I think, and the other one is
an ice shelf on the other side

00:32:02.872 --> 00:32:03.880
of the continent.
 

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.490
If those two melt,
then the ocean goes up about

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.700
ten meters, about thirty feet.
 

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:19.068
So the level of the ocean will
go up and down a bit.

00:32:19.068 --> 00:32:23.440
So there's a very interesting
thing that's going on with

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.380
evapotranspiration out of
forests,

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.759
and I'm going to illustrate it
first with a picture and then

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:30.049
with a story about the Amazon.
 

00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:31.328
Okay?
 

00:32:31.328 --> 00:32:33.862
So if we go to the
Mediterranean,

00:32:33.862 --> 00:32:38.769
and we look at the impact of
what the dairying culture did,

00:32:38.769 --> 00:32:42.390
on the Mediterranean--so people
started keeping sheep and goats,

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.729
and goats are incredibly
efficient at removing brush and

00:32:45.729 --> 00:32:49.951
grass from the landscape--
basically what the goats did is

00:32:49.951 --> 00:32:54.750
that they desertified the
periphery of the Mediterranean,

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.348
all the way around.
 

00:32:56.348 --> 00:33:02.818
They did it between about 5000
and 2000 years ago.

00:33:02.818 --> 00:33:05.994
So if you back,
you can read in Greek and Roman

00:33:05.994 --> 00:33:09.930
commentary about all of the
wonderful grain that was grown

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.688
in North Africa,
in places like Libya and in

00:33:13.688 --> 00:33:18.919
Tunisia and Algeria,
and you can read descriptions

00:33:18.919 --> 00:33:23.538
of the wild forested habitat of
Greece.

00:33:23.538 --> 00:33:26.792
And you go to those places
today, many of them don't look

00:33:26.792 --> 00:33:30.182
quite this desolate,
but they're certainly much more

00:33:30.182 --> 00:33:33.888
like this than they are like a
nice deciduous forest or a

00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:34.750
chaparral.
 

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.500
So goats had a big impact.
 

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.150
And you ask yourself,
"Well why does that

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:38.700
happen?"
 

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.392
Well we can actually,
by looking the Amazon

00:33:41.392 --> 00:33:45.366
rainforest, we can get a pretty
clear idea of what was going on

00:33:45.366 --> 00:33:48.058
in the periphery of the
Mediterranean.

00:33:48.058 --> 00:33:50.952
So the transpiration from the
trees, in the Amazon,

00:33:50.952 --> 00:33:53.903
is taking a huge amount of
water out of the soil and

00:33:53.903 --> 00:33:56.680
putting it up into the
atmosphere every day.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.548
So wherever you are in the
Amazon Basin,

00:33:59.548 --> 00:34:02.068
usually by noon or about 2:00
in the afternoon,

00:34:02.068 --> 00:34:03.618
you've got a cloud sitting over
your head,

00:34:03.618 --> 00:34:06.420
and that's the water that came
out of the ground that day.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.336
And there's also moisture,
of course, that's coming in

00:34:09.336 --> 00:34:11.427
from the Atlantic,
and it's blown west,

00:34:11.427 --> 00:34:13.630
up towards the Andes,
in the clouds.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:17.329
And because of this
transpiration,

00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:20.588
if you look at a molecule of
water that's coming in off the

00:34:20.588 --> 00:34:23.349
South Atlantic,
by the time it hits the Andes

00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:26.686
it's gone in and out four times;
it's rained four times by the

00:34:26.686 --> 00:34:27.940
time it gets to the Andes.
 

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:34.713
So having the forest there is
making very efficient use of

00:34:34.713 --> 00:34:36.260
that water.
 

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.032
It is a positive feedback loop
whereby the presence of the

00:34:40.032 --> 00:34:43.409
forest is maintaining the
presence of the forest.

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:47.081
And if you cut down the forest,
the rainfall will decrease and

00:34:47.081 --> 00:34:49.489
the total plant growth will
diminish,

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:52.728
and that will accelerate the
conversion of forest into

00:34:52.728 --> 00:34:53.340
savanna.
 

00:34:53.340 --> 00:35:00.679
So this is an extreme case of
that process.

00:35:00.679 --> 00:35:04.579
In the Amazon there's enough
stuff coming in off of the South

00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:06.949
Atlantic,
and it's at--remember if you

00:35:06.949 --> 00:35:10.365
look at your Hadley cells,
it's in a region of the world

00:35:10.365 --> 00:35:13.829
near the equator where you have
warm moist air rising.

00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:16.280
So you're going to have
planetary forces generating

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.594
rainfall,
whether there are trees there

00:35:18.594 --> 00:35:20.724
or not,
but you move just 30 degrees

00:35:20.724 --> 00:35:22.954
north,
to the Mediterranean,

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:25.070
and you don't have that.
 

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.010
Here, at the Mediterranean,
you have got,

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.489
in your Hadley cell
circulation, you have got cold,

00:35:31.489 --> 00:35:35.045
dry air falling,
and you don't get the planetary

00:35:35.045 --> 00:35:38.978
forces regenerating and
replenishing the rainfall and

00:35:38.978 --> 00:35:43.367
the forests that had been there
had been an important local

00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:47.150
source of transpiration into the
atmosphere.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:52.228
So at the equator this is what
you get, and boy is this stuff

00:35:52.228 --> 00:35:56.630
efficient at getting water up
into the atmosphere.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:01.523
One that a lot of you have read
a lot about I know is

00:36:01.523 --> 00:36:06.980
atmospheric carbon dioxide and
greenhouse gasses and global

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.110
warming.
 

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:13.016
And it is the immediate source
of carbon for terrestrial

00:36:13.016 --> 00:36:18.637
organisms, but it's really only
a tiny part of the global carbon

00:36:18.637 --> 00:36:19.530
cycle.
 

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:26.623
So if we look at the carbon
cycle, and we look at storage in

00:36:26.623 --> 00:36:31.356
gigatons of carbon--
the storage here is in black

00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:35.010
and the flux in gigatons of
carbon is in purple.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:40.610
So there's about 750 gigatons
of carbon in the atmosphere.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.530
In the surface of the ocean
there's about 1000 gigatons.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:48.601
In the deep ocean there's
38,000 gigatons of carbon,

00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:49.800
and so forth.
 

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.349
Okay?
 

00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:52.980
So vegetation has got a bit
less;

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.385
all the vegetation of the globe
has got a bit less carbon in it

00:36:56.385 --> 00:37:03.126
than there is in the atmosphere,
and only about 1/50^(th) as

00:37:03.126 --> 00:37:09.550
much as there is in the deep
ocean.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.150
And there is carbon which is
moving between all these

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.900
compartments.
 

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:18.626
The fossil fuel and cement
production of the world has got

00:37:18.626 --> 00:37:23.224
about 4000 gigatons stored,
and it's putting about 5

00:37:23.224 --> 00:37:25.800
gigatons per year into the
atmosphere.

00:37:28.869 --> 00:37:32.871
So if we look at that flux,
overall there's a big exchange

00:37:32.871 --> 00:37:35.679
between the oceans and the
atmosphere.

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:38.110
There's a pretty big impact of
photosynthesis.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.777
Plant respiration is putting
just about everything back into

00:37:41.777 --> 00:37:44.139
the atmosphere that it's taking
out.

00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:47.329
So this is pretty much a wash
right here.

00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:52.048
The increment from fossil fuel
and land use looks pretty small

00:37:52.048 --> 00:37:54.679
compared to the overall process.
 

00:37:54.679 --> 00:37:57.561
But the critical thing is
whether or not at equilibrium

00:37:57.561 --> 00:38:00.389
you're just pushing that
equilibrium a little bit,

00:38:00.389 --> 00:38:03.780
because these are rates,
and rates accumulate.

00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:11.905
Back in about 1955 or so,
a forward thinking atmospheric

00:38:11.905 --> 00:38:17.083
scientist started measuring the
carbon dioxide in the world's

00:38:17.083 --> 00:38:22.175
atmosphere right here at 11,000
feet on Mauna Loa on the big

00:38:22.175 --> 00:38:24.159
island of Hawaii.
 

00:38:24.159 --> 00:38:28.721
And he chose that because there
you're about 2500 miles out from

00:38:28.721 --> 00:38:29.880
any continent.
 

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.980
The atmosphere has been well
mixed by the trade winds,

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.590
and you're going to get a very,
very well mixed sort of

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:40.000
standard signal that's not
contaminated by any local

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.340
industry or anything like that.
 

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.719
This is what it looks like.
 

00:38:43.719 --> 00:38:47.702
This is the Mauna Loa direct
measurement signal over here,

00:38:47.702 --> 00:38:51.614
and these are inferences of
past levels of carbon dioxide

00:38:51.614 --> 00:38:54.130
concentration in the atmosphere.
 

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.913
This is parts per million by
volume in the atmosphere,

00:38:57.913 --> 00:38:58.768
over here.
 

00:38:58.768 --> 00:39:02.920
And you can see that there's a
signal that human industrial

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.998
activity has been increasing
carbon dioxide level arguably

00:39:06.998 --> 00:39:09.789
since the late nineteenth
century--

00:39:09.789 --> 00:39:13.210
okay?--and it's accelerating
upward.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.244
These are from ice core
measurements that are done

00:39:16.244 --> 00:39:20.025
mostly in Greenland by Danes and
Swiss who go to Greenland and

00:39:20.025 --> 00:39:22.070
bore down through the icecap.
 

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.420
Now let's put that in
perspective, okay?

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:32.760
So this is today and this is
500 million years ago,

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.713
and these are all different
kinds of measurements of carbon

00:39:36.713 --> 00:39:39.780
dioxide through the last 550
million years.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:46.250
And the 30 million year filter
is--this is a moving average,

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.717
a 30 million year moving
average--and basically what it

00:39:49.717 --> 00:39:53.440
shows is that most of the time
the earth has had a lot more

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.230
carbon dioxide in its atmosphere
than it currently has;

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:00.306
much more than anything that
has been contributed by human

00:40:00.306 --> 00:40:02.789
activity and industry in the
last 150 years.

00:40:02.789 --> 00:40:06.092
This is estimated by various
different methods,

00:40:06.092 --> 00:40:09.179
and it has a couple of striking
features.

00:40:09.179 --> 00:40:13.324
Look what happens to carbon
dioxide between the Ordovician

00:40:13.324 --> 00:40:15.070
and the Carboniferous.
 

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.550
It is sucked out of the
atmosphere.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:22.110
Where do you think it went?
 

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.219
Student: Over there.
 

00:40:25.219 --> 00:40:25.630
Prof: Some.
 

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.670
Some went into reefs.
 

00:40:29.809 --> 00:40:32.360
It went into your gas tank.
 

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.739
That's when oil and coal were
made.

00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:41.056
So when land plants first
evolved--and that was when- that

00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:46.081
was the first big forest,
planet covering forest,

00:40:46.081 --> 00:40:51.654
and it was warm and moist--
in those carboniferous swamps,

00:40:51.654 --> 00:40:54.431
you know,
generation after generation,

00:40:54.431 --> 00:40:57.670
for thousands of generations of
plants, built up.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:02.487
Then there's an interesting
re-injection of carbon dioxide

00:41:02.487 --> 00:41:05.699
into the atmosphere in the
Permian,

00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:09.739
and it happens particularly at
the end-Permian crisis,

00:41:09.739 --> 00:41:13.900
and this re-injection then does
have the oceanic element.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.400
Okay?
 

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.250
So some of that stuff did get
stored,

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:19.871
like in the Black Sea,
right here, and then with the

00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:23.847
end-Permian extinction and the
breakup of Pangaea and the

00:41:23.847 --> 00:41:27.610
re-ordering of the oceanic
circulation patterns it got

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:28.889
re-injected.
 

00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:33.003
Then throughout the
Mesozoic--so throughout the time

00:41:33.003 --> 00:41:37.519
that the earth was dominated by
dinosaurs and their other

00:41:37.519 --> 00:41:41.128
relatives--
it was pretty warm and plants

00:41:41.128 --> 00:41:42.699
could really grow.
 

00:41:42.699 --> 00:41:45.197
They were getting--by the way,
carbon dioxide is a fairly good

00:41:45.197 --> 00:41:47.480
fertilizer;
so plants do grow more rapidly

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.806
when they have more of it,
if they aren't being limited by

00:41:50.806 --> 00:41:52.150
some other nutrient.
 

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:58.230
And then when we get into the
last 65 million years,

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.530
here, carbon dioxide is going
down,

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:04.780
down, down, until we get to
what we perceive as the normal

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.356
concentration--
right?--the normal

00:42:08.356 --> 00:42:12.329
concentration being down here.
 

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:20.570
Well it was a lot higher,
for a long period of time.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.789
I think there's an important
message in that.

00:42:22.789 --> 00:42:28.572
The important message is that
at the scale of life on the

00:42:28.572 --> 00:42:32.289
planet, global warming is
trivial.

00:42:32.289 --> 00:42:36.090
Life has dealt with it and will
deal with it just fine.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:39.369
There will be extinctions,
but life will not go extinct

00:42:39.369 --> 00:42:41.070
because of global warming.
 

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:44.135
There's been plenty of species
that could deal with much warmer

00:42:44.135 --> 00:42:47.773
conditions on the planet,
and those kinds of things will

00:42:47.773 --> 00:42:50.630
increase in abundance as things
warm.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:54.559
However that doesn't mean that
global warming is not important.

00:42:54.559 --> 00:42:57.590
Global warming is especially
important because of sea level

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.152
rise,
and because of the increase in

00:43:00.152 --> 00:43:04.384
variation in weather patterns,
which means that both periods

00:43:04.384 --> 00:43:07.668
of drought and floods will
become more frequent at

00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:11.688
intermediate latitudes,
and the intensity and the

00:43:11.688 --> 00:43:15.840
number of major storms will
probably increase.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.670
It would be interesting to know
what the hurricane strength was

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:21.400
like back in the Silurian.
 

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.199
You know?
 

00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:26.983
Katrina might have been just a
little blip, compared to a

00:43:26.983 --> 00:43:30.362
Silurian hurricane,
but unfortunately we don't know

00:43:30.362 --> 00:43:31.849
how big they were.
 

00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:37.288
Now the fate of the carbon that
was in the original planetary

00:43:37.288 --> 00:43:40.369
atmosphere can be sketched here.
 

00:43:40.369 --> 00:43:44.445
And basically what you see is
that it's mostly in limestone

00:43:44.445 --> 00:43:47.677
and in sediment,
and there's a huge chunk of it

00:43:47.677 --> 00:43:50.489
sitting in the ocean as
bicarbonate.

00:43:50.489 --> 00:43:54.670
So think about that the next
time you buy a bottle of soda

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.650
water or sparkling water.
 

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:03.090
That's representative of 37 or
38,000 gigatons of carbon.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.349
Fossil fuel,
organic sediment and so forth,

00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:10.150
you find that there's dissolved
CO_2,

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.460
which actually is the molecule
CO_2,

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.960
and not as the bicarbonate ion,
in the ocean.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.255
Living biomass, fairly small;
methane in the atmosphere

00:44:19.255 --> 00:44:20.760
pretty small.
 

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.981
So when you look at that,
you wonder well where is the

00:44:23.981 --> 00:44:27.447
biggest source of carbon that
might get mobilized into the

00:44:27.447 --> 00:44:28.360
atmosphere?
 

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.320
And in fact it's in methane
hydrate.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.340
Okay?
 

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:35.179
Methane hydrate will be a solid
in cold water but it will melt

00:44:35.179 --> 00:44:39.269
and release methane with just a
little increase in temperature.

00:44:39.269 --> 00:44:39.920
Okay?
 

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.293
It turns out there's about 100
trillion cubic meters of methane

00:44:43.293 --> 00:44:45.469
hydrate stockpiled around the
planet,

00:44:45.469 --> 00:44:48.219
sitting there in sediments,
ready to be mobilized.

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:51.777
So if the world's oceans warm
up by a few degrees,

00:44:51.777 --> 00:44:56.208
there will be a very dramatic
positive feedback effect as this

00:44:56.208 --> 00:44:58.460
methane comes bubbling out.
 

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.864
And methane is a more efficient
greenhouse gas than carbon

00:45:03.864 --> 00:45:06.329
dioxide, by quite a bit.
 

00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:12.387
So its contribution to global
warming could triple and really

00:45:12.387 --> 00:45:15.619
accelerate, if things warm up.
 

00:45:15.619 --> 00:45:19.958
And this is just a picture
showing you that methane hydrate

00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:24.670
is stored in places like the
sediments underneath deep water.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.851
So you have,
say in the Arctic,

00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:31.193
it will be fairly shallow;
off Louisiana it will be fairly

00:45:31.193 --> 00:45:31.639
deep.
 

00:45:31.639 --> 00:45:32.630
But there's a lot of it.
 

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.577
The phosphorous cycle is
different from the carbon and

00:45:39.577 --> 00:45:42.746
nitrogen cycles because
phosphorous doesn't have a

00:45:42.746 --> 00:45:43.909
gaseous phase.
 

00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:46.639
It's a solid or a liquid.
 

00:45:46.639 --> 00:45:51.139
And it's the scarcest essential
element.

00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:53.619
Of course, we need it for ATP,
we need it to build the

00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:56.286
phosphate sugar backbone of DNA,
and we need it for energy

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:59.570
transmission and so forth;
all life needs it for that.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:01.969
But it is really pretty scarce
in the crust.

00:46:01.969 --> 00:46:03.539
So it is usually limiting.
 

00:46:03.539 --> 00:46:07.041
Now if you just go out there
and you pour a bunch of

00:46:07.041 --> 00:46:10.679
phosphate into the landscape,
this is what you get.

00:46:10.679 --> 00:46:11.980
Okay?
 

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.530
You get lakes filled with algal
blooms,

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:18.460
and that is showing you the
dramatic response of--

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.867
the algal population and plant
population in lakes is showing

00:46:21.867 --> 00:46:24.880
you that phosphorous really is
the limiting factor.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.606
So phosphate fertilizer is very
important in agro-ecosystems,

00:46:30.606 --> 00:46:36.619
and phosphate fertilizer gets
washed into lakes and fish die.

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:40.838
Why do fish die in an eutrophic
lake that has a lot of algae in

00:46:40.838 --> 00:46:41.179
it?
 

00:46:41.179 --> 00:46:42.260
What's killing them?
 

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:42.920
Yes?
 

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.711
Student: Because when
the algae becomes decomposed,

00:46:44.711 --> 00:46:45.750
those &gt;
 

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:50.010
will take a lot of it and
change it into nitrogen.

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:50.949
&gt;
 

00:46:50.949 --> 00:46:53.972
Prof: Well you've got it
right about anoxia,

00:46:53.972 --> 00:46:56.030
but you got the mechanism
wrong.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:59.050
By the way, the bottom of a
eutrophic lake is anoxic and the

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.199
process you described is going
on there.

00:47:01.199 --> 00:47:04.550
But the algae don't have to die
to do that.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:12.280
Student:
&gt;

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.971
Prof: Well the algae
certainly are taking the

00:47:14.971 --> 00:47:17.030
sunlight out of the top of the
water.

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:21.199
But when does the oxygen
disappear from the lake?

00:47:31.329 --> 00:47:34.885
I remember the bad joke about
the astronaut who was not so

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:36.342
bright,
who said, "Ah,

00:47:36.342 --> 00:47:38.884
we are going to take our new
spacecraft and we are going to

00:47:38.884 --> 00:47:39.980
land on the sun."
 

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.492
And he was asked,
"How are you ever going to

00:47:41.492 --> 00:47:42.250
land on the sun?"
 

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:44.369
And he said,
"Don't worry,

00:47:44.369 --> 00:47:46.489
we are going at night."
 

00:47:46.489 --> 00:47:49.239
It happens at night.
 

00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:51.860
At night the algae are all
there.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.262
They're not making oxygen
because there's no photons

00:47:55.262 --> 00:47:57.922
coming in,
but they still have to breathe

00:47:57.922 --> 00:48:00.304
themselves,
and they just suck all the

00:48:00.304 --> 00:48:03.639
oxygen out of the water and the
fish are asphyxiated.

00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:06.800
They don't have to die to do it.
 

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.556
They're just naturally living
their lives as normal healthy

00:48:09.556 --> 00:48:12.360
algae and they suck the oxygen
out of the water at night.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:17.349
Okay, so some take-home points
on ecosystems.

00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:20.704
Movement of matter and energy
around the planet is really

00:48:20.704 --> 00:48:24.239
important, and there are some
really interesting large-scale

00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:24.900
issues.
 

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.644
And if you like big numbers and
you like to calculate and look

00:48:28.644 --> 00:48:31.900
at flow models and compartment
models and differential

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:36.771
equations and stuff like that,
biogeochemistry has a place for

00:48:36.771 --> 00:48:37.210
you.
 

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:42.358
The contact here is with
geology, physical chemistry and

00:48:42.358 --> 00:48:43.670
meteorology.
 

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.159
The connections are important.
 

00:48:46.159 --> 00:48:48.489
They're not all well worked out.
 

00:48:48.489 --> 00:48:52.382
So there must be important
connections between ecosystem

00:48:52.382 --> 00:48:56.650
ecology and community ecology,
but they are still being

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:01.480
explored, and this is not an
area that's really mature yet.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.978
The part of ecology that
analyses these processes really

00:49:04.978 --> 00:49:08.288
is the part that deals with the
fate of the planetary

00:49:08.288 --> 00:49:11.052
environment,
especially water and air,

00:49:11.052 --> 00:49:14.621
and that means it has important
economic and political

00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:15.699
implications.
 

00:49:15.699 --> 00:49:18.952
So it's an area well worth
worrying about and learning

00:49:18.952 --> 00:49:23.324
something about and remembering,
because these are the processes

00:49:23.324 --> 00:49:27.559
that will affect the quality of
human life on the planet,

00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:30.739
for forever basically.
 

00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:33.282
Okay, next time I'm going to
discuss biodiversity,

00:49:33.282 --> 00:49:36.501
and about whether it matters or
not, and about what extinctions

00:49:36.501 --> 00:49:36.969
mean.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.950
- Today we're going to continue
talking about Privitization

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.450
of core government functions.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.300
And our central focus is
going to be on prisons

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.870
and the military.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.040
I'm gonna start just by revisiting

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.830
the basic outlook of
privatizing government

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.563
that became so powerful in
the early post-Cold War years.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.250
We'll then focus first on privatizing

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.420
the military in general
and that'll lead us

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.120
into a discussion of
the Host Nation Trucking

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.150
example in from Afghanistan
about which we put together

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.163
that case that was on the syllabus.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.440
Then I'm gonna give some background

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.320
on the U.S. prison industry
and that'll lead us

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.049
into a discussion of the
privatization of prisons

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.290
and what we should be
thinking about more generally

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.020
about privatization of
core government functions.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.120
Just to put my map back up on the screen,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.963
this is from last time.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600
We distinguished
post-communist privatizations

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.770
from what I was calling
Neoliberal Privatizations

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.410
part of the small
government agenda at home

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.970
and the Washington Consensus a broad.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.370
And distinguished previously public

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.860
or public sector nationalized industries

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.210
with things like railways and utilities

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.210
from the wielding of public authority

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.230
as we spend quite a bit
of time on eminent domain.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.505
And then we left for
today what I'm calling

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:59.850
core government functions;
policing, prisons, the military,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.800
things that have to do with
people's basic survival,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.800
the state's monopoly on the
legitimate use of coercive force

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.600
to use Max Weber definition
of state, policing,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.633
which we're not gonna talk about though,

00:02:18.832 --> 00:02:20.790
I should perhaps have mentioned that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.337
one of the consequences
of the privatization

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:35.669
of the provision of local
services in housing,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.810
the common interest
developments in many respects,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.650
they also have some
privatization of policing.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.210
There's an old joke about what

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.940
are the Yale police for by the way?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.060
And the answer is, was
to protect the students

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.220
from the New Haven police
where they've kind of,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.240
one could make of that what one well.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.500
But I should have gone
a little bit further

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
that in a sense these
common interest developments

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.360
are gated communities, we tend
to think of gated communities

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.163
as communities only for wealthy people.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.743
Gated communities around Cape Town where,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.290
or around actually any
of South Africa's cities,

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.560
where wealthy people live

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.330
and they have their
private law enforcement

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.530
but one of their interesting features

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.440
of the common interest
developments in the U.S.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.700
is that 60 million people live in them

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.810
and there are of many
different income categories,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.900
but they are essentially
a kind of gated community

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.593
even if the gates are often invisible.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.750
So today we're gonna go to
core government functions.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.030
And just to take us back to how people

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.770
we're thinking about
privatizing government,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.900
let's go back to December 1994.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.740
- Our reinventing government initiative

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.580
led by Vice President Gore,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.630
already has health of shrink bureaucracy

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.930
and freeing up money
to pay down the deficit

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.610
and invest in our people.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.680
All day we pass budgets to
reduce the federal government

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.020
to its smallest size in 30 years

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.843
and to cut the deficit by $700 billion,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.030
that's over $10,000 for
every American family.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.550
In the next few days, we'll
unveil more of our proposals.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.410
And I've instructed the Vice President

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.110
to review every single
government department program

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.110
for further reductions.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.940
I know some people just wanna
cut the government blindly

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.210
and I know that's popular
now but I won't do it.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.700
I wanna linear not leaner government,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.450
we can sell off the entire operations

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.370
the government no longer needs to run

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.530
and turn dozens of programs
over the states and communities

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.250
that know best how to
solve their own problems.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.190
My plan will save billions of dollars

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.490
from the Energy Department,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.550
cut down the Transportation Department

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.900
and shrink 60 programs into four

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.640
at the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.690
A new government for the new economy

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.880
creating flexible, high-quality,
low-cost, service-oriented

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.537
just like our most
innovative private companies.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.250
- So he wasn't talking
about shrinking government

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.000
to the size when it could
be drowned in the bathtub

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.913
as Grover Norquist would
subsequently argue,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.587
but it was very much, he went
on in that speech to say,

00:05:25.587 --> 00:05:27.820
"We propose to stop doing things

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.150
that government doesn't do very well

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.367
and that don't need to
be done by government."

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.180
So there's a sense that
we should be looking

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.963
everywhere we can to privatize
what government does.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.312
This really had started
in the 1980s with Reagan

00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:55.097
but it accelerates in the 90s with Bush I

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.950
in the Clinton administration.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.640
And we will see particularly
under George W. Bush

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.670
the privatization of
core government functions

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.283
starts to really take off.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.890
In 1993, this is the national
performance review called

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.531
that the Clinton administration conducted,

00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:22.470
they called for aggressive
outsourcing of government work.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.470
It led to the elimination of
almost half a million jobs

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.703
in the federal civilian workforce.

00:06:32.332 --> 00:06:33.820
And interestingly, by 2001,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.690
this is the beginning of
the Bush administration,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.810
the Pentagon contract workforce outnumbers

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.620
civilian Defense Department
employees for the first time.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.440
Those who can remember back that far,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.440
this is where in Donald Rumsfeld
was Secretary of Defense.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.060
And he made it his business,
this is before 9/11 happened,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.860
he made it his business to
rethink the whole structure

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.250
of the military much more
on private sector principles

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.980
and to slim it down.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.460
And so if you look at the at
the U.S. government workforce

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.460
over the past two decades,
you can see that the size

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.640
of the number of
employees working directly

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.120
for the federal government
doesn't really change that much

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.123
and by some measures it decreased.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.550
This Purple Line is what
we call Grant employees.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.930
Most of that is grant money
given by the federal government

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.770
in Grant programs to state
and local governments

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.760
or for specific projects.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.760
And you can see that that
had continued to increase

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.570
but after the financial
crisis, it tails off as well

00:07:54.998 --> 00:07:59.998
when government comes
under real fiscal stress.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.610
My guess is that this little peak

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.870
at in the first couple of years
after the financial crisis

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.830
was stimulus spending, things
like NIH spending and others

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.660
which then tailed off.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.660
But the notable fact in the
beginning decade of the century

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.900
is this massive increase in the number

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.950
of contracted workers.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.740
This is contracting out of work.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.630
And a big chunk of that increase

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.920
that you can see there in the blue line,

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.920
also up through 2010, was
outsourcing in the military.

00:08:41.908 --> 00:08:46.908
This is courtesy of
Rumsfeld and his successes.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.890
But the idea that we would
rely much more heavily

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.840
on the private sector
in all of the operations

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.770
of the military's a big part of that surge

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.040
that you see up through 2010.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.980
And even then when it
falls, it goes nowhere near

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.980
where it had been before.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.770
And I suspect for reasons
I will get to later

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.790
that if you have these
numbers through 2019,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.653
this will increase.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.980
Okay, privatizing the military.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.980
So the idea that there
are private contractors

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.910
involved in the conduct of war is not new.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.360
If you go back to the Revolutionary War,

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.550
you can see that actually
in every single war,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.030
we have had private contractors
in military personnel

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.963
involved all the way back
to the Revolutionary War.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.210
They are the yellow bars
rather than the blue bars

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.300
who are irregular military.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.300
And you can see that they've
had a rather small presence

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.400
in most of those wars, the
largest proportionately

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.800
before the Iraq war being in the Civil War

00:10:15.427 --> 00:10:17.260
and in the Second World War.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.360
But the Iraq war is notable
because for the first time,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.730
you can see that we have
more or less the same number

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.170
of private military contractors.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.250
This is by 2008 in Iraq.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.250
And you can see basically we
have more or less equal numbers

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.360
of private military contractors
unlike the first Gulf War

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.350
which we talked about in
the very first lecture

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:48.350
where the coalition forces were
almost half a million people

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.840
even though we didn't
engage in regime change,

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.967
we had a much more ambitious
agenda in the 2003 Iraq war

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.100
even though we used many
few of our own troops

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.890
and we relied much more

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.110
on these private military contractors.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.570
The Afghanistan war takes
it to a whole new level,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.570
this again is 2008, you can see, this is,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.390
We were drawing down
troops in Iraq after that

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.370
and this is the surge in
Afghanistan that starts

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.290
at the end of the Bush
administration continues

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:38.080
under Obama and the private
military contractors

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.940
become less of a proportion of the total

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.370
during that surge
although we will see later

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.550
that in a decade since then,

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.620
the picture is somewhat different.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.670
So you might be asking yourself,

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.330
well, who are these private
military contractors

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.586
and what do they actually do?

00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:06.470
Is this just a euphemism for mercenaries?

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.910
Mercenaries, they're as
old as the hills after all.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.450
And at least as they
are employed in the U.S.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.610
or by the U.S., they're
strictly not supposed

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:22.610
to engage in front-line
fighting, the offensive fighting,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.590
but they can do just
about any other function,

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.300
and they do a huge variety of things.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.300
So just to give you some
sense just this as a flavor

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.450
of some of these companies of their size

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.590
and what they do.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.590
Here's one called G4S, it
has about 625,000 employees

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:49.390
mostly involving itself
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.250
And it you can see it does
a whole gamut of things;

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.440
routine security, banks,
airports and prisons

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.900
but more heavily armed
security, mind clearance,

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.450
military intelligence and training.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.510
Another one, Erinyes.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.200
Mostly in Africa, although
it's had a lot to do

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.660
in Iraq as well, it guards oil pipelines.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.630
It has about 16,000 guards,

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.790
so it's considerably smaller but working

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.410
or it has worked almost everywhere in Iraq

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.410
often protecting commercial ventures

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.730
such as iron or oil and gas projects

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.670
in the Republic of Congo,

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.390
The Asia Security Group, a
smaller one about 600 guards

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.520
but it's been very active in Afghanistan

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.520
particularly security for the
high government officials.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.270
It's had millions of
dollars in U.S. contracts

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:57.270
and protected supply
convoys in Afghanistan South

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.593
about which I'll say more
in a little while as well.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.470
DynCorp or DynCorp, not sure
how they pronounce themselves,

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.823
pretty big sized one, 10,000 employees,

00:14:10.823 --> 00:14:15.010
3.4 billion in revenue.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.980
Again operating in many
parts of the world;

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.440
Iraq, Africa, Latin
America, Eastern Europe.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.650
It become involved in, you might think of,

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.823
as policing missions,
anti drug interdictions,

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:36.199
disarmament of fighters
in stalemated civil wars,

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.600
a whole variety of activities.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.750
Triple Canopy, have interesting names,

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.430
some of these companies.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:52.260
About 1,800 people, mostly
from Uganda and Peru.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.467
And they're making contracts
worth about 1.5 a year.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.470
Involved as you can see
is countries as different

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.541
as guarding the US Embassy in Haiti,

00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:11.541
protecting US personnel in
Israel and many other things.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.683
Aegis Defense Services, a very big one,

00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:21.683
5,000 staff, UN missions,
peacekeeping missions sometimes

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.900
and it's been involved
in emergency response

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.760
for governments risk
assessment activities,

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.700
so the government gamut of activities.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.700
And so this is a particularly
notable military contractor,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.720
changed its names several times,

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.490
it used to be called Blackwater

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.420
and it was one of the
most notorious of these,

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.120
particularly it had was famous

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.803
for a very aggressive tactics,

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:02.630
it's big, it's had some
20,000 people working for it

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:07.803
at different times as you can
tell many parts of the world.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.490
They got notorious mainly because of Iraq

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.710
in two different episodes in Iraq.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:19.710
One was that it precipitated
the first battle

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.790
of Fallujah in 2004.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.131
The army had not intended to take Fallujah

00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:33.131
but four Blackwater security personnel

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.380
got themselves killed and it
went viral, their bodies hang,

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.930
their burned bodies hanging
from bridges in Fallujah

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.960
basically forced the U.S.
to redirect its plans

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.810
and go and take Fallujah which
they had not intended to do.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.650
And this is one of the ways
in which military contractors

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.250
can actually affect the primary missions.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:04.053
But then several years
after that in Baghdad,

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:10.010
Blackwater shot and killed 17 civilians

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.840
including a nine-year-old child

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.030
and much of this also went viral

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.930
as had the Fallujah episode.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:23.340
And eventually four of them
were were convicted of murder

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.340
and one got a life sentence,
the other two got very strong

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.920
I think 30-year criminal sentences.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.010
So Blackwater became synonymous
with these freewheeling

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.570
uncontrollable military contractors

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:47.020
which actually had an effect in thinking

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.460
about how they should be
restrained and governed.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.710
There was something adopted
called the Montreux document,

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.690
the following year by 52
countries including the U.S.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.730
that listed a whole
series of good practices

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.780
and said among other things

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.500
that the government's employing them

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.960
would be accountable for what they did.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.510
Of course like many of
these kinds of protocols

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.573
whether they can be
enforced is another matter.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.730
But so Blackwater then
has renamed itself twice;

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:29.730
first to G services and now is
called Academy, or Academia,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.670
I don't know how they like
to pronounce themselves,

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:38.670
but most people who have heard
of any of these companies

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.363
have heard of them.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.310
So that's the kind of thing that they are,

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.450
as I said they do, they'll
do virtually anything,

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:54.170
they will fight for any
government if the price is right

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:59.110
and they will largely do
whatever they are asked to do.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.980
The personnel in them have changed a lot.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.150
For instance in the 1990s, a lot of them

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.170
were former South African military

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.550
after the settlement in South Africa.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.410
Those people now are
pretty long in the tooth,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.590
probably too old for
this kind of activity.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:23.590
And so they come from all over the world.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.270
But in certain situations
and particularly will see

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.750
in Afghanistan, there's
very heavy reliance

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:35.750
on local populations as
a source of employees

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.963
by these companies.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.420
So let's talk a little bit

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.673
about Host Nation Trucking in Afghanistan.

00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:51.034
These, the convoys, you can see

00:19:51.034 --> 00:19:53.784
that they were employed to guard.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.410
And it's important to say little bit

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.640
about why this came to be the case.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.950
So this is a map of Afghanistan.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.820
As you can see, first thing to notice

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.653
is it's a landlocked country,

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.860
I haven't got Kabul marked on it

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.543
but Kabul is right there pretty much.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:20.450
And for reasons we're gonna
talk about when we get

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:25.450
into the the class about
the Global War on Terror,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.580
the U.S. went into
Afghanistan after the 2000,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.496
the 2001 attacks with
a very light footprint,

00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:37.990
we went with very few
troops on the ground.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.990
In fact, the way we fought
the war in Afghanistan

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.200
was to get behind one side
in an existing Civil War.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.530
There had been an ongoing
civil war in Afghanistan

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.970
between the ruling Taliban

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.890
and a group called the Northern Alliance.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:02.400
And the Northern Alliance
was all but defeated in 2001.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.800
We wanted to do Afghanistan on the cheap

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.780
for reasons I will talk about later

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.850
and we made the judgment that the way

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.800
to do Afghanistan on the cheap

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.000
was to get behind the Northern Alliance.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.070
And the idea was to help
them win the civil war

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.610
so that they would then
become a government

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.953
that we could work with.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.270
And that is exactly what we did.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.570
But the thing we didn't think about

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:37.520
or certainly we didn't
draw the right conclusions,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.500
if we did think about
it, is that if you get

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.803
behind the losing side in a civil war,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.860
it's probably gonna be the
case that that government

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.690
is going to be having
a hard time governing

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.590
because they're probably reasons

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.380
why it's been the losing
side in a civil war.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.280
It might not have a lot
of support, for instance,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.470
among the population
or it might not be able

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.220
to create on its own a Weberian monopoly

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.930
of the use of legitimate power precisely

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:17.220
because it doesn't have that capacity.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:22.220
And so indeed we did help
the Northern Alliance

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:28.080
when we defeated the Taliban
and we put them in power,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.150
we may have seen them as a
government we could work with

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.790
but of course a government
that comes to power that way,

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.660
it is inevitably gonna be seen

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.800
as an American puppet
government on the ground

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.430
which tended to be what happened.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:48.430
And so basically people,
you know, you'd read article

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.940
after article and if you
would interview people,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.360
you would hear statements to the effect

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:58.320
that the government in
Kabul for years didn't...

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.873
You know, you could once you're
five miles outside Kandahar,

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.870
really the government had no
real control of the country.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:16.190
And so this was the reality
in which this ongoing war

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.090
was being prosecuted.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.570
And indeed as we will see
when we dig in the lecture

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.570
on the global war on terror,
by 2003, many of the commanders

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.730
on the ground in Afghanistan were advising

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:39.110
up the chain of command
that the Bush administration

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.030
should be trying to make
a deal with the Taliban

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.970
perhaps to create a
government of national unity

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.410
but the judgment on the ground was that

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.880
there was no way that the
government we had put in place

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.500
was ever going to, given the
resources we were spending

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.500
and and so on, was ever
gonna become a legitimate

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.280
and effective government.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.220
That argument was
systematically either ignored

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.190
or rejected and where it's now of course

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.990
the longest war in American history

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:20.290
and we are on the verge of doing a deal

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.080
which will return the Taliban to power.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.430
So this was the world in
which we were operating

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:32.250
for much of the first two decades,

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.910
we were basically supporting a government

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.120
that doesn't control its own territory.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.200
And we had a very light footprint.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.570
And so the challenge
was how to move supplies

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:50.030
around Afghanistan which
was essentially not secured

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.690
in particular this Highway
I which you can see

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:59.380
goes basically around the country.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:04.380
And we have to be able to move personnel

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.180
and particularly equipment
through this hostile territory.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.700
And that was not gonna be easy to do

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.400
and so you can see what
happened at the start into,

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.450
not at the start, but in 2007,

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:27.450
we had about 25,000 troops there

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.960
and more or less equal number
of military contractors.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.710
You can trace these numbers
up through the surge

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:43.710
but by, you know, six years later,

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.830
we'd brought these troops from Iraq

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.330
but then drawn them down somewhat.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:56.320
But reliance on military
contractors continued,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.320
so they vastly now in 2013
and this has continued since,

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.100
we've drawn down troops further.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.710
So we've been heavily reliant
on these military contractors.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.710
And basically what we've done
is use them to guard convoys.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.490
The reason we wouldn't...

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.760
why wouldn't we wanna use American troops

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.223
to guard these convoys?

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.130
Any, why would we wanna
contract out the guarding

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.313
of these convoys?

00:26:33.148 --> 00:26:34.000
(man speaks off the microphone)

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.278
Pardon?

00:26:35.278 --> 00:26:37.200
(man speaks off the microphone)

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.310
What kind of cost?

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:43.855
The financial cost, there's
some financial, yeah?

00:26:43.855 --> 00:26:48.710
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.480
We don't have a draft so
that again we have to use

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.780
professional soldiers that
can be expensive, yeah.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.363
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:05.310
They understand that terrain
better than the U.S. troops.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.650
That's also true but it comes
with the sting in the tail

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.170
which we'll talk about a
little in a few minutes.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.550
But the real reason goes
back to the lack of a draft

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.684
that this is really hostile territory

00:27:18.684 --> 00:27:21.866
and if we had started using
a lot of American soldiers

00:27:21.866 --> 00:27:24.650
to guard these convoys,
we would have started

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.210
having a lot of American casualties.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.710
And having a lot of American casualties

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.730
would have made this war
much more difficult to fight

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:38.540
because people would be
calling their Congress people,

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:43.410
their senators, you know,
you don't have to think that

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.650
far back to see how this played out

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:48.990
during the Vietnam War.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:53.362
It was when large numbers of
Americans were being killed

00:27:53.362 --> 00:27:58.362
that the support for fighting
the Vietnam War went away.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.030
So the idea was not to expose politicians

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.280
to the political cost
to, not to expose them

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.210
to the political cost of
having a lot of soldiers there.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.510
But the difficulty with relying on people

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:20.130
who know the terrain a lot
better is that they also know

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.650
how to take advantage of you, right.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:28.650
And so we had a lot of
contradictory imperatives

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.190
because we were trying
to pacify the country,

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.670
we were trying to help the government

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.103
get control of the country.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.530
So for instance among other things,

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.560
we put in place rules which said

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.560
that private contractors
guarding millitary convoys

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:52.187
couldn't have weapons
more powerful than Ak-47s.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.510
The problem was that these
convoys were being attacked

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.563
with rocket-propelled grenades.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.240
So how are you going to
actually protect the convoys

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.813
if you don't have the relevant firepower?

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.933
Big challenge, what's the answer?

00:29:11.952 --> 00:29:13.280
(man speaks off the microphone)

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.663
Pardon?

00:29:14.663 --> 00:29:17.544
(man speaks off the microphone)

00:29:17.544 --> 00:29:20.055
And how do you do that?

00:29:20.055 --> 00:29:22.385
- Through the terrain.

00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:24.970
(audience laughing)

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.410
The answer was money, right.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:28.610
The answer was money.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:33.610
You basically had to pay the people

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.950
who might otherwise be attacking you

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.080
not to attack you, right.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.193
So there were huge shakedowns.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.410
And these are from the case,
I put them on the slides,

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.460
it's not to read them out to you now

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.410
but you can look peruse
them at your leisure,

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:56.000
but they're basically
whistle blowers and others

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
reporting what the going
cost was to make sure

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.720
that a convoy didn't get attacked.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.720
And so the Taliban was
charging $500 per truck

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.980
from Kandahar to Herat.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.800
And the different prices listed there.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.890
This is a slide from a presentation

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.840
to a congressional committee
which basically said,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.620
in order for the Host
Nation Trucking contractors

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.110
to be able to work in the Sharana region,

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:35.110
they had to basically
pay $150,000 a month.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.970
So, and that this became scandalous

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.970
because it turned out as you,
it shouldn't take you too long

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:49.450
to realize that we were
sawing off the branch

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.700
we were sitting on in that
we were actually funding

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.830
the guerrilla movements

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.213
that we were supposed to be fighting.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:02.210
And the reason was that
we had to essentially pay

00:31:04.041 --> 00:31:09.041
in order to be able to prosecute this war

00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:16.710
with reduced cost, economic cost,

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.282
that when you're not sending professional

00:31:20.282 --> 00:31:24.010
well-paid U.S. military
in the hundred tens

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.870
and hundreds of thousands and
avoiding the political cost

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:32.807
that would have come with
doing it with our own troops.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.220
So that became a huge scandal

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.093
and there were a lot of hearings about it.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.710
And some of the problems were fixed

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:48.763
but it remains something
of an ongoing problem.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.770
But, well, the question
I want us to puzzle over

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:58.020
is assuming that the
problems could be managed,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.221
and we'll come back to
whether they really can be

00:32:01.221 --> 00:32:05.330
in a little while, but assuming
the problems can be managed

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:10.330
and it really is more efficient
to fight wars this way,

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.029
it really does save
money and it saves lives

00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:19.170
and you know, it's a market solution,

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.560
you're letting people who
want to spend their lives

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.973
taking these kinds of
risks take those risks.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.130
It means we could fight

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.783
what would be otherwise unpopular wars.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.130
Is that a good thing?

00:32:42.456 --> 00:32:43.706
- [Student] No.

00:32:45.761 --> 00:32:47.280
- [Man] It's anti-democratic.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.430
- Why is it anti-democratic?

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.240
- [Man] Because the war is unpopular,

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.423
it's a war that could not (mumbles)

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.610
- Well, let me be the devil's
advocate there literally.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.040
He's saying it's anti-democratic

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.540
because if the war is unpopular,

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.980
we shouldn't be fighting it.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.700
But when we fight the war this way,

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.700
it's not sufficient, it's
not unpopular, right.

00:33:11.738 --> 00:33:15.200
We're contracting out to
people who wanna fight the war

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.053
and we're getting to stay
home and not have to send us,

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.610
ourselves or our sons
and daughters to die.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:28.610
So it would be an unpopular
war if we were sending them

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.280
but we're not sending them.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.550
We're only sending small numbers
of professional soldiers.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.190
Yes sir?

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:40.860
- [Man] (mumbles) perverse
incentives to fight more wars.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.890
- It creates a perverse
incentive to fight more wars.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.540
Yeah, if something is cheaper to do,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.013
you're more likely to be able to do it.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.993
What's so wrong, what's so bad about that?

00:33:54.827 --> 00:33:59.827
- [Man] You create the for
(mumbles) specifically.

00:34:01.307 --> 00:34:06.307
- So there if you go back and
read the Federalist Papers,

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.170
you find some of the same
sentiments as we're hearing

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:13.570
from the floor here.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.510
There was a great
nervousness, this huge debates

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.920
about whether we should be
having standing armies at all

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.630
because standing armies wanna fight wars.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:28.630
And maybe it should be really
difficult to fight wars,

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:34.110
and we shouldn't fight wars
unless there's a lot of support

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.400
for fighting the wars.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.553
Yeah?

00:34:36.553 --> 00:34:37.610
(man speaks off the microphone)

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.980
You gotta yell or get a mic,
I forgot to get the mic.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.837
Yell, you just gotta yell.

00:34:42.837 --> 00:34:47.420
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:34:52.187 --> 00:34:57.104
- [Man] And that army could even (mumbles)

00:34:58.876 --> 00:34:59.709
to carry out some of the missions

00:34:59.709 --> 00:35:01.410
that they carry out.

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:05.480
- So you're worried about
these armies going rogue

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.163
and doing their own thing, yeah?

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.733
Okay, yeah?

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.540
- [Man] I would say that
the problem is not so much

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.950
in the war in itself but
what is the oversight,

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:20.340
so we've seen that in the
Iraq and Afghanistan wars

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.820
rather than the Congress
declaring a war declaration

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.140
that's been done through giving power

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.350
to the President to the war.

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.920
So if there's no oversight
of how the war is going on

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.840
then we can have this broke armies

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.790
that we're talking about.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.450
So it's sort of undemocratic

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.200
because there are no checks
and balances on the war itself.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.090
- Okay, so we'll come back
to the oversight issues

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:45.860
but the argument of the Federalist Papers

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:50.860
and the resistance to
having professional armies

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.830
in the first place was
the idea that, you know,

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.130
war is not a great thing
and we should only,

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.790
I think part of the idea was,

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.790
we should only be fighting wars

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.660
that we really need to fight.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:07.210
And if you really need to fight a war,

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.690
you'll be able to mobilize the citizenry.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:12.080
And if you can't mobilize the citizenry,

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.390
maybe it's a war that doesn't
need to be fought at all.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.470
And we will consider later whether

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.000
there was another option in Afghanistan

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.320
after 9/11, a path not taken.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.320
But the other thing to think
about is there's a literature

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:33.070
in political science
and political philosophy

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:36.180
that goes all the way
back to Immanuel Kant

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.230
who first observed that what
he called Liberal Regimes

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.623
of what we think of us today
is more democratic countries

00:36:43.623 --> 00:36:46.320
tend not to fight one another.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.070
They tend not to fight one another.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.320
And this turns out Bruce Russert

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.970
who's now an emeritus professor,

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:56.410
he is very famous for having
studied this empirically

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.530
at great length, Michael
Doyle at Columbia,

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:02.550
a political theorist who's
spend a lot of time on this,

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.310
but many people have studied

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.570
this so-called Democratic Peace.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:10.270
And it seems empirically to be the case

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.193
that democracies tend
not to fight one another.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.680
And also at least until
recently that democracies

00:37:20.682 --> 00:37:24.660
tend only to fight wars
that they're going to win

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.860
which again depended upon the idea

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.580
that it's gonna get people,
it's gonna be very difficult

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.330
to get people to fight unless the war

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:36.740
is really important to them in which case

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.883
they'll be motivated to win.

00:37:40.095 --> 00:37:44.760
And so if you start to make
it very cheap for politicians

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.180
to wage wars as we have done
increasingly by reliance

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.640
on first of professional military

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.520
and now military contractors

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.990
and increasingly we're gonna be relying

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.080
on things like drones
which can be also for

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.080
without very many soldiers
and perhaps at very low cost.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:09.030
And we are funding these wars on debt,

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:13.130
we're not actually making
people who live and vote today

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.293
to pay taxes to fight these wars.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.710
It's gonna make us more warlike

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:24.160
because politicians will not have

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.520
the incentive to avoid war.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.680
And so the finding, the empirical finding

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.543
in the Democratic peace
literature might start to go away.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:40.970
Let's shift focus to prisons
and then we will come back

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.450
and see what these two have in common.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:49.450
So some summary points about
prisons and the main big one

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:57.310
is that we are a huge
outlier in the world.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.490
So here you can see incarceration rates

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:05.870
400,000 of population and the U.S.

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.813
beats everybody, hands down.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.270
This was in 2012 but the picture

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.900
doesn't look substantially
different comparatively,

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.900
we have over 700 per 100,000 citizens.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.720
And as you can see, the Czech Republic

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.090
which comes in there has 200,000.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:33.920
If you look at the top 10
incarcerators in the world,

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.960
you can see what kind of
company we're in even though

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.103
we dominate them all, Russia, Belarus,

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.320
countries of that kind.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.210
South Africa comes in 10th
but we're all, you know,

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:48.980
we're not quite double but we're there.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.800
And if you wanna look at it over time,

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.800
you can see that it's
really has accelerated

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:02.630
in the last four, since
the 1970s, it's accelerated

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:07.930
by a phenomenal rate
particularly for males

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.593
and we'll see particularly
males who are not white.

00:40:14.515 --> 00:40:19.515
Now some of this has
to do with developments

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.710
in the criminal justice
system but not all of it.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:27.710
So just to provide some
larger context here,

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:34.480
in the 1960s and early 70s,
there were big advances

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.960
in the treatment of psychiatric disorders,

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.960
so-called mood disorders,
things like depression,

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:48.840
started to be treated
with drugs like lithium

00:40:50.238 --> 00:40:55.238
and it's cognates and thought
disorders like schizophrenia

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.760
started to be treated
with drugs like Thorazine

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.830
and its derivatives.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.850
And that meant that people
who had previously spent

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.200
their whole lives in mental hospitals

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.120
started to be released.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.900
So if you go up to Connecticut
Valley Hospital in Middletown

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.900
or Creedmoor Hospital, at
State Hospital in New York,

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.851
the first thing that will
strike you is they'll be,

00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:24.280
and it's as true in State Hospital,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.333
after State Mental Hospital
around the country,

00:41:27.333 --> 00:41:29.230
there'll be six or seven building,

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.503
the majority of which are boarded up.

00:41:33.511 --> 00:41:35.333
And the reason is that these people

00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:40.000
will all be institutionalized
in very large numbers.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.070
People who might otherwise have
spent their lifetimes there.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:49.070
But it also happened to occur
during a massive fiscal crisis

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:50.923
for a lot of state governments.

00:41:52.471 --> 00:41:54.700
And this is the dark side

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.870
of what we sometimes
call fiscal federalism.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.460
And so as these state
governments were saving

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.740
huge amounts of money
by de-institutionalizing

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.820
mental patients, where were they going?

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.290
They were going to in Connecticut,

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.950
they were going to, you know,
to Hartford to New Haven

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:16.138
to Bridgeport and the state governments

00:42:16.138 --> 00:42:19.580
we're not giving those
resources to the cities

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:23.220
'cause they were so, the state
governments were so strapped.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.750
And a lot of those people wound up

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:30.750
in the criminal population
and wound up in prisons.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.730
So I'm not saying it's a causal argument

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.830
or anything like that but
there are part of this,

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:41.830
part of this population was
fed by the fiscal federalism

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.500
and the fiscal crises of the states

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.560
that led to an increase in the population

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.870
that was likely to be very vulnerable

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.070
to winding up in prison.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:59.500
So they went from one total
institution to another.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:03.850
But as you can see here
the numbers are staggering

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:07.343
and that's only a small
piece of the story.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.990
So here are the bigger pieces of it.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:16.580
What drove this to big developments?

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.860
One was a war on drugs which begins

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.903
in the Nixon administration in 1971.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:31.097
And then secondly in the
1980's, the massive increase

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:37.530
in mandatory sentencing which
shifts power from judges

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.980
to prosecutors because the vast
majority of prison sentences

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.705
are negotiated plea
agreements with prosecutors,

00:43:45.705 --> 00:43:49.940
and led to things like the three strikes

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:50.810
and you're out rule.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:54.330
So if you're convicted of a third felony,

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:56.100
you get a life sentence even...

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.520
And they're all these famous
cases of the third felony

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.070
being a bounced cheque
or something of this sort

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:06.340
might not be a violent crime at all.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:11.340
And so these two developments
were largely responsible

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:17.130
for the much more punitive
turn in criminal sentencing

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:23.740
and the massive expansion
of our prison population

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:28.940
to over 200, over 2,000,000
where it is today.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.920
Big racial component to this,

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.010
particularly in the war on drugs,

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:39.010
the crimes that were more heavily
punished and criminalized,

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.670
the drugs that were, the
drugs for which people

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.960
were convicted at higher rates tended

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.230
to be the drugs used by minorities

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.800
but there were other reasons

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.580
about which one could
teach an entire course

00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:00.580
about why minorities are
disproportionately locked up

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:03.590
in the criminal justice system.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:08.590
You can see here, this is
2009, the percent of males,

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.460
adult males, incarcerated
and the African-Americans

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:18.063
and Hispanics are much
more widely represented.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.210
This of course has a political dimension

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:26.310
because we have so-called
felon disenfranchisement laws.

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:31.310
Many states have laws, again
you can peruse this slide

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:36.380
at your leisure but the
reddest are the most punitive.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:40.660
So for instance in Kentucky and Virginia,

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.180
you're permanently disenfranchised

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.820
if you've had a felony conviction.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:50.150
And then these other colors
them as they get lighter,

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:57.340
it's easier to get your voting rights back

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.658
once you have served your time.

00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:03.580
And if you look at this contributes

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.470
to the disenfranchisement
of minority populations

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:12.470
because here the reddest
states are the ones

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.840
in which African Americans are
most heavily disenfranchised

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.980
as a result of felon
disenfranchisement laws.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.170
So we've become much more punitive

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.380
mostly because of the war on drugs

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:35.270
and the much more punitive
sentencing policies

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:40.270
particularly the move to
strong mandatory sentencing.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:46.110
But the big paradox is violent crime

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.380
has actually been falling.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.573
Violent crime has been falling.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.880
This is from 1993 to 2017

00:46:57.919 --> 00:47:01.970
and this is breaking it,

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.600
the first two graphs are breaking it down

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.070
first by people and then by age

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:15.070
and the second to property
crimes for 100,000 people

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.740
or per 100,000 households.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.550
And you can see that the number,

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:28.550
the proportion of
convictions for violent crime

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:33.183
in all of these categories
has come down substantially.

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.933
So we're locking up more people.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:44.340
This is from 1990, the
red line shows the number,

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:48.300
the prisoners per
population but violent crime

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.610
is coming down.

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:52.560
So why might that be?

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.190
Why would we be locking up more people,

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:57.007
why would be seeing locking up more people

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:58.870
and violent crime coming down?

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.010
- [Man] Drug crimes are
largely non-violent.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:02.843
- Pardon?

00:48:02.843 --> 00:48:05.700
- [Man] Drug crimes are
largely non-violent.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.020
- Okay, but we're locking up...

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:12.410
Okay, so we're locking up
people for nonviolent crime,

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.910
that could be one of the reasons.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:18.290
Why else might we be
locking up more people

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.373
with violent crime is going down?

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:22.715
Yep?

00:48:22.715 --> 00:48:24.260
(man speaks off the microphone)

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.533
Pardon?

00:48:25.533 --> 00:48:27.850
(man speaks off the microphone)

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.293
That criminals are in prison.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.930
So some would say, well, that's
great the policy is working,

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:36.760
right, we're locking them up.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.560
That's why the crimes going down.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.100
Some people would say that.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.890
Any other reason somebody
might come up with?

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:43.995
Yes sir.

00:48:43.995 --> 00:48:46.746
- [Man] Contractual agreements
with private prisons.

00:48:46.746 --> 00:48:49.630
- Contractual agreements
with private prisons.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.377
We'll talk about private prisons,

00:48:52.377 --> 00:48:55.990
they are significant but they
wouldn't be significant enough

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:58.000
to explain this development.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.070
And the private sector prison increase

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:02.460
is a relatively recent.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.920
Yeah?

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.760
- [Man] It could be the
Police Department are changing

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.290
their tactics and (mumbles).

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.500
- More community policing.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.790
Well, we've seen we have some
experts on community policing

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.300
in this room but I
believe the short answer

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:21.810
is we had a rise and fall
in community policing.

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:26.530
Even though community
policing is more effective,

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.283
it's gone up and down.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.440
Maybe it's having a comeback now.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:37.440
Among other reasons, one
is, one reason violent crime

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.953
is going down is demography.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.720
The vast majority...

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.210
One of the best predictors
of violent crime

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:51.183
is males between the age of
18 and 24 in a population.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:56.793
And as the baby boom
bulge has moved through,

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:03.470
we have fewer, we have relatively
fewer people of that age.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.853
So some of it is just demography.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:12.410
There's a theory that has
been very controversial

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.800
by the people who wrote Freakonomics

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.800
which purports to show
that Roe versus Wade

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.630
is responsible for the
decline in violent crime

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:27.630
on the hypothesis that those
likely to commit violent crimes

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:33.163
are not being born
because of being aborted.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:37.740
Very controversial, I think.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.540
The data was questioned, much criticized

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.730
and in the last couple of years,

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:47.040
they've done a whole series
of new empirical studies

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:52.040
purporting to defend their hypothesis.

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:58.950
But if you read Steven Pinker's book,

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:01.440
The Better Angels of Our Nature

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.463
which traces the decline in
violence in Western countries

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:12.320
over the last seven centuries.

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.750
He puts a lot of stock in education

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.270
and labor force participation of women

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:22.270
and argue that as that goes
up, violent crime decreases.

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:27.450
So the point of the slide
being why violent crime

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.360
has decreased is not a subject

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.770
about which this much consensus.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:37.040
And there are these and
you could probably put up

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.150
a number of other possible
contributors to that.

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:45.000
But more interestingly from
a political point of view

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000
is that even though violent
crime is going down,

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:53.903
most people don't know that.

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:59.890
So the dark blue line is
percentage of people in polls

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:04.940
who believe that violent
crime is increasing.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:09.050
As you can see, the light
blue line is the rate

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:12.860
at which violent crime
is actually occurring.

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.020
And you can see this
pretty big disjunction,

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:20.070
an increasing disjunction,
between what people believe

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.383
and what's actually going on.

00:52:24.072 --> 00:52:26.283
And that's quite remarkable.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.640
Various hypotheses about
that, a political scientist

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.000
by the name of Stuart
Scheingold who's worked on this,

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.440
a book called Politics of Law and Order

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.030
argues that it's being tough on crime

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:42.470
is cheap talk for politicians
because the politicians

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:44.600
who can run and get elected on it

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.380
are often not the politicians
who have to justify paying

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:53.050
to lock up the felon to voters.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:58.050
So for instance people
running for federal office

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.220
can run on being tough on
crime but the vast majority

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.000
of prisoners are actually in state prisons

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.690
that are paid for out of state budgets.

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:12.360
So coming back to this slide,

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.680
one thing I didn't point out earlier

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:19.150
is that you can see that
around the turn of the century,

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:22.410
this all started to tail off.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:25.360
That in fact we started to see declines

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.360
in incarceration rates
and part of that was cost,

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:35.550
part of it was perhaps
recognizing the inefficiency

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:38.320
of punitiveness rates but if you look

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:43.320
at private sector prisons,
they are increasing.

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:48.430
So you can see that they went
from being about 6.3 in 2000

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:53.897
to 8% of the population in 2009

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:58.650
and they're well above 10% now,

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:01.470
so perhaps even more than that.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:05.480
So the private sector prison industry

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.840
is getting an increasing proportion

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.750
of a declining population.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:15.180
And so that's, you know,
violent crime is going down,

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.940
the number of people
locked up are going down

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.500
and yet we are seeing this
growth and flourishing

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.400
of the private sector prison industry.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.260
- Last week there was a terrific article,

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.500
The Financial Times, about how U.S. states

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.610
are looking to privatize their prisons

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:33.120
in order to close their
deeping budget deficit.

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.820
It turns out sell your
prisoners to private contractors

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.830
is a great way for cash-strapped States

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.590
and even a federal gun to raise money.

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:43.410
First off, there's the money upfront.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.660
Private firms will pay as much

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.790
as $10 to $30 million per prison.

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:49.770
Last month Ohio sold
one for 73 million bucks

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.380
and Arizona recently
finished a series of hearings

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.910
on a play to add thousands

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:56.260
of privately operated prison debts.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.950
But the real money comes from
the long term cost savings.

00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:01.760
Since private companies
cannot operate prisons

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:05.290
at a much lower cost than
state governance, the reason,

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:07.920
it's not just the magic
of capitalism at work,

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.570
it's really because people
who work for private companies

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:12.100
don't have huge guaranteed benefits

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.070
like many state employees.

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:16.310
And that's why numerous state governments

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:19.450
looking to achieve some kind
of long-term fiscal sanity

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.870
are thinking about
privatizing their prisons.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.840
In Florida, 29 state prisons
are said to be privatized

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.960
by the end of the year.

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:30.400
I'm hoping it can save the
state 22 million bucks a year.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.610
It's good for the state, it's
good for the prison operators

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:35.700
and it might even be good for the inmates

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.260
since public prisons are so overcrowded.

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.240
And the worse the economy gets,

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.380
the more desperate the states
would be to be raising money

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:47.040
by selling their valuable
prison real estate.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.990
And that's why private incarceration game

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.010
works so well during recession.

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.820
This industry is basically duopoly.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:00.820
It's a duopoly between
Corrections Corporation of America

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:04.840
and GEO group, yeah.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.810
Those are the two.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:08.580
For you home gamers, these
are the only two significant

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.020
public (mumbles) firms.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.140
Well, companies have a lot
going for them right now

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.910
but the thing I like most
is their track record

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.080
during the Great Recession

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.800
because if we give it
another series flutter,

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.650
you know you can count on
these guys to profit from.

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:22.300
Both of these companies have
consistently growing earnings

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.540
every year since 2007.

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.690
Neither one of them
sell, anything you feel

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:30.220
and even recession,
nothing just didn't do it.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.560
These stocks give new meaning
to the term recession proof.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.010
You can't just bust people out of prison

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.530
when your state runs out of money,

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:38.500
they gotta keep paying for inmates.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.550
And of course about $25,000
for your inmate per year

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:43.320
and of course the
national prison population

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.240
is sadly one of the strongest
secular trends out there.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.570
You know kind of like a political

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:50.020
but we're not about
politicians here by right,

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.800
we only care about the profits

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.500
and there's no doubt that this business

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:55.430
is lucrative as all get-out.

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:57.880
It's only going to get better from here.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.510
Right now, only about 10%
of prisons in the U.S.

00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.500
are privatized but it's clear the country

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.770
is moving that direction.

00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:06.430
So there's a lot of room
for both Corrections and GEO

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:08.570
to keep on growing plus
the ability of governments

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:10.790
to build new prisons is
simply not keeping pace

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.640
with the need for more prison space.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.950
It's simple supply and demand.

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:17.380
The economic and situation
dictate that our new prisons

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:21.910
will be private prisons, that
is good for both CXW and GEO.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:23.280
There's no escape from the notion

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.033
that this is a fantastic
business to be in.

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.123
- So Jim Cramer knows
we're off, he speaks.

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:38.300
As you can see that the private
sector prison population

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:43.720
through 2016 has increased
from under 100,000

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:48.917
to about 130,000.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:54.093
If you wanna get a
sense of where they are,

00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:00.240
the darker the blue
heading for deep deep blue

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:05.750
is the heaviest concentration
of these prisons.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.950
And if you wanna compare
them by state and federal,

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:12.870
you can see the federal line is red

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.703
and the state line is green.

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:19.990
Most of these prisoners are
in private, in state prisons

00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:24.810
and indeed you can see here,
the federal, this red line

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:26.500
started going down basically

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:31.290
because the Obama administration
decided to phase out

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:34.430
private sector federal prisons.

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:38.270
However, the Trump administration
has brought them back

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:42.050
and particularly all the interdictions

00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:44.050
on the southern border.

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.650
Almost all of that is massive business

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:48.230
for private detective prisons.

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:51.520
So I'm sure when we get
data for the next few years,

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.360
this red line is gonna
take off to the northeast.

00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.430
While some of you might have
noticed a couple of weeks ago,

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:04.133
the California State
Legislature just passed a bill.

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:07.430
I don't think that Gavin
Newsom has signed it,

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:10.370
he was deterring about
signing it but facing him out

00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:14.350
in California which would be, I think,

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:18.763
it'd take a significant, may
take a significant chunk away.

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:24.620
So what do we think about
private sector prisons?

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.160
Again, there's plenty of room for abuse,

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.640
we all know the stories about the judges

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.740
who were bribed to send children

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.190
to private juvenile facilities and so on.

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:40.550
But assume they are more efficient.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:44.340
So assume by whatever metric

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:47.720
you think prisons should be judged,

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.560
recidivism rates or
conditions in the prison.

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:57.560
Let's just assume for the
purposes of discussion,

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.723
the private sector prison is better.

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:02.993
Who would still be against it?

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:06.610
Why?

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:08.810
- [Woman] I feel (mumbles)
and if we decided

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.720
something that a person does is illegal

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.939
then it's our responsibility to directly

01:00:18.939 --> 01:00:22.223
hold them responsible for
their actions that (mumbles).

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:25.500
- Okay, that might be one reason.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.380
Yeah?

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.380
- [Man] The California
private prisons was lobbying

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.280
to keep the (mumbles).

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:40.100
So they are as well political groups

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:44.283
to maintain the incarceration.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.760
- Okay, any other reasons
people might be against them?

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.490
Assuming they are more efficient,

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.830
what if they do have
lower recidivism rates,

01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:59.610
what if they had better conditions?

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:04.610
A lot of them don't but why
would you still be against them?

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.670
Yes sir.

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:06.810
- [Man] It doesn't
really adjust the problem

01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:09.710
that if public prisons are overcrowded

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:11.440
and private prisons
would have been better,

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.087
why are public prisons (mumbles)?

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:17.453
- Okay, so this goes to the
lobbying question perhaps,

01:01:22.082 --> 01:01:26.367
is that implicit in your
question or what you're saying--

01:01:27.326 --> 01:01:28.430
- [Man] Yes, it just
doesn't address the problem.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:29.360
- It doesn't address...

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.040
Yeah, so Jim Cramer says
the demand is there.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.790
You're saying well, we don't
know why the demand is there,

01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:37.240
violent crime is decreasing,

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.526
most people seem not to know that, yeah.

01:01:40.526 --> 01:01:45.526
- [Man] The for profits logic will prevail

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:51.043
over the good for the
prisoners in the long run.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.683
What about rehabilitation,

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.683
private prisons want to keep them.

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.223
- Well, you could say well, you know,

01:02:02.223 --> 01:02:05.333
just to be the devil's
advocate, if you said,

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:09.040
the metric by which
they're gonna be judged

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.593
is how well they rehabilitate prisoners.

01:02:13.985 --> 01:02:16.263
What if they rehabilitate
prisoners better?

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:21.574
- [Man] The question is
rehabilitation of the prisoners

01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:23.180
that they don't have.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:28.180
- Right, so let's say, your
next renewal of your contract

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:32.560
is gonna be conditioned
on the recidivism rates

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.633
from your prison.

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:38.229
- [Man] I just find it interesting

01:02:38.229 --> 01:02:42.270
that we're little more bothered
by having private prisons

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.680
and yet we don't look to other sectors

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.980
the government looks
like health or education,

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.640
what may not seem to be
more prone to be okay

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.377
with privatization of forth
profit behind these sectors--

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.500
- I think that is a common response

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.817
but I'm asking you, why?

01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:03.730
- [Man] Right, so I think
because the case of prisons

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:05.863
you're taking away someone's liberties,

01:03:08.114 --> 01:03:10.430
it affects you at the core much more.

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:11.930
And to think that you're putting value

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:15.010
to someone else's enter to
a private probation hands,

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:17.280
it doesn't judge well with that idea

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.260
of I'm restricting someone's freedom

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.790
and I'm giving it over to
private sector handling.

01:03:25.842 --> 01:03:28.316
- Yep, you're really gonna have to yell.

01:03:28.316 --> 01:03:31.440
- [Man] It is (mumbles)
to compensation around

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.590
why we have this social problems,

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:38.913
the injustices and the
high incarceration rates.

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:41.930
- Right, it doesn't address that,

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:44.790
it takes for granted,
Cramer takes for granted,

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:48.270
there's the demand and he
has nothing to say about why,

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:52.250
you know, as we saw earlier,
maybe it's the war on drugs,

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:57.140
maybe it's the structural
hostility to minorities

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:01.000
built into a lot of the
differential sentencing

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.880
and enforcement, maybe it's the people

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.010
who should be getting mental health care

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:11.350
and not being locked up at all.

01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:13.380
So by focusing on this,

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:18.240
we're not addressing
the underlying issues.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.183
But I think coming back
to pull the two parts

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:26.764
of the lecture together now,

01:04:26.764 --> 01:04:28.670
when I talked at the beginning

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:30.920
about core state functions,

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.830
I mentioned Webers definition of a state

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:38.010
as having a monopoly on the legitimate use

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.470
of force in a given territory,

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:43.840
that's how Weber defines a state.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.840
And the truth is that
neither of these activities,

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.930
the military, privatizing the military

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:57.500
or privatizing prisons is
really privatization, right.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:02.500
What it really is, is contracting
out a government monopoly.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:10.160
We're not actually turning
this over into fully private,

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:16.440
so that is the problem.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.430
And as I've put up on the slide,

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:23.430
that creates what economists
call principal agent problems

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:26.780
of a particularly difficult sort

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.910
because the idea of a
principal agent problem

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:34.910
is that the principle
contracts out to the agent

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:41.560
to do things in this, either
the private military contractor

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.730
or the private sector prison.

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:46.480
But it rapidly becomes
the case that the agent

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.880
has more information
that the principal needs

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.290
to monitor the agent
then the principal has.

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:59.290
And so that creates a lot
of difficult problems.

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:02.530
So if you think about, you
know, in a schematic view

01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.710
of a democracy, we have the voter

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:06.470
then we have the politician,

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:09.200
the politician is the voters agent

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.300
then we have the regulator
who's the politicians agent

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.320
and then we have the contractor.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.930
And so the chain from here to here

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:21.760
has many many points at which...

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.760
It's like a series of nested
principal agent problems

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.850
that have to be managed.

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:32.030
And of course principal agent problems

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.040
come up all over the place.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.700
You say well what is the solution

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.770
to principal agent problems?

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:40.670
One is to have competition.

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:44.620
There's not a lot of competition
in any of these industries.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.050
So as Cramer noted in that clip,

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:50.070
basically the private prison industry

01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:54.734
is completely dominated
by two corporations.

01:06:54.734 --> 01:06:58.740
And this, by the way,
they're now multinationals,

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.890
they operate in Australia,
they operate in Europe,

01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:06.173
they operate in the UK, they
operate in lots of places.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.420
There's a huge cost to entry

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.560
into the private sector prison business.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.740
You've got to build a prison,

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.680
you've got to commit yourself
for long periods of time,

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.833
not very competitive industry.

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:25.980
Military contractors
somewhat more competitive

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.620
but again you develop,
a government's develop

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.290
relationships with these contractors,

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:33.860
they're not gonna suddenly switch

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.670
to other contractors very easily, say,

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:41.490
contractors who might have been
fighting for the other side.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.710
So it's actually difficult to get

01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:45.850
a lot of competition in people,

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:50.303
instead stick to their
relationships that they have.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.840
A second way of managing
principal-agent problems

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.540
is to try a better align
the interests of the agent

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.470
with the interests of the principal.

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:03.870
Because if they have the same interests

01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:06.117
then you don't have the agent going off

01:08:06.117 --> 01:08:09.120
and in a rogue fashion doing something

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:12.490
that's not in the
interest of the principal.

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:14.700
The trouble in this area too,

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.170
it's very difficult to do that

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:19.683
as people pointed out with
respect to the prisons,

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:27.350
the industries themselves
have very different incentives

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:32.117
from like reducing crime, you know,

01:08:33.557 --> 01:08:38.557
having more prisoners is the
business in which they traffic.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.390
And so indeed, what you
find in the prison industry

01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:44.863
is a lot of lobbying.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.250
It grew dramatically,
this is up through 2010.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:53.813
If I had a slide since 2010,

01:08:57.808 --> 01:09:00.080
that number would keep going up.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.650
And you can see here they
give to at the federal level

01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:07.330
to candidates from both parties.

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:10.900
The light blue is Republican
and the dark blue is Democrats.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:14.720
See this is particularly when Democrats

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.220
are in control of the federal government.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.750
As happened here, it's gonna go up,

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:23.020
they're gonna give money to incumbents.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.413
So they give money to both sides.

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.380
It won't shock you to
know what they lobby for?

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.690
More lockup quotas, stiffer penalties

01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:34.980
as somebody pointed out
and immigration enforcement

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.920
because these are big industries.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.590
So if good public policy is to reduce

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.470
the number of people in prison,

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:47.930
it's gonna be almost impossible
to align the incentives

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:50.740
between the principal and the agent.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:54.950
Similarly, and we think
about fighting wars,

01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:59.080
these, you know, we might
say good public policies

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:03.140
to have fewer wars and certainly
fewer unnecessary wars,

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:06.810
the military contractors
have very different interest.

01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:09.900
So for them, if the war
in Afghanistan goes on

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.163
for another 10 years,
it's just more business.

01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:18.150
The final way in which
people try to manage

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:21.293
principal-agent problems is monitoring.

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:26.300
But that is very difficult in
these types of circumstance.

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.513
Here's the hearing.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.090
- So today we're considering our oversight

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:31.780
on the United States
government contracting

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.640
on conflicts overseas.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.090
And we're gonna ask the
important questions,

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:36.796
who's getting the United
States taxpayer money

01:10:36.796 --> 01:10:40.690
and how are they using those
funds once they get it?

01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:43.490
Last week, the subcommittee
held a hearing that examined

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.340
Asia at the Host Nation Trucking
contract in Afghanistan.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.744
That investigation uncovered
distressing details

01:10:50.744 --> 01:10:52.690
about the United States taxpayer money

01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:55.510
is funding warlordism and
corruption in Afghanistan

01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:57.080
and how the contract is undermining

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.173
United States counterinsurgency strategy.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.550
Equally troubling is to finding

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:03.110
that the United States officials charged

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:06.070
with overseeing this
contract had no visibility

01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:07.460
into the actual operations

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.490
of the contractors or subcontractors.

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.270
In most cases, official did not know

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:14.430
who the subcontractors were
let alone who they employed,

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:17.720
how they functioned and
where they spent their money.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.790
To give one example, seven of
the eight prime subcontractors

01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:24.230
from the Host Nation
Trucking contractor employed

01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:26.570
either directly or
indirectly, a man by the name

01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:29.330
of a commander Ruhullah,
and he provided security

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:30.900
for the supply convoys.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.647
Commander Ruhullah claims to spend

01:11:32.647 --> 01:11:35.560
$1.5 million per month on the ammunition

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.290
and has reportedly attacked convoys

01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:39.980
that do not use his security services.

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.050
Still no United States military officials

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:43.760
have ever met with commander Ruhullah.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.070
And despite the fact that he
receives billions of dollars

01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:48.130
of taxpayer money, there
have been no attempts

01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:49.550
to enforce the United States laws

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:52.920
that govern his U.S. funded
contractual relationship.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.210
With $2.16 billion of
taxpayer funds at stake,

01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:58.260
it's unconscionable that
the military does not have

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.690
tide of control over Host
Nation Trucking subcontractors.

01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:03.330
But the Host Nation Trucking contract

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:05.130
is not the only problem.

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:08.700
This week's Economist reports
that 570 natal contacts

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.740
worth millions of dollars were issued

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:14.520
in southern Afghanistan but
nobody is quite sure to whom?

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.320
In January, the Special Inspector General

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.760
for Iraq Reconstruction, one
of our witnesses here today,

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.870
issued a report about the
State Department contract

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:24.367
with DynCorp which
noted that, and I quote,

01:12:24.367 --> 01:12:27.540
"Over $2.5 billion in
U.S. funds were vulnerable

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.560
to waste and fraud."

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.920
Close quote.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.190
In May, the Inspector General

01:12:31.190 --> 01:12:34.150
for the United States Agency
for International Development

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:37.010
issued an audit of his
private security contractors

01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:39.990
in Afghanistan which
highlighted significant problems

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:42.130
with USAID contracts.

01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:45.427
It found that USAID does
not have, and I quote again,

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:48.490
"Reasonable assurance that
private security contractors

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.080
are reporting all serious
security incidents

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.580
are suitably qualified in their authorized

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.010
to operate in Afghanistan."

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.843
Close quote.

01:12:56.991 --> 01:12:59.490
Audits from the Department of State, USAID

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:02.150
and others have found problems
with subcontractor management

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:05.100
that areas as diverse
as embassy construction,

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.220
fuel delivery and educational
outreach programs.

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.600
The Government Accountability Office,

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.730
another of our witnesses here today

01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:13.810
has reported that the
agencies are not even able

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:15.810
to accurately report
the number of contractor

01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:17.560
or subcontractor personnel

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.567
working on United States contracts.

01:13:19.567 --> 01:13:21.990
And just yesterday,
The Wall Street Journal

01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:24.840
reported that over $3
billion dollars in cash

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.310
has been flown out of Afghanistan
in the last three years.

01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:29.530
This $3 billion dollars of cash on a plane

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.140
flying out of Afghanistan.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.460
Officials believe that at
least some of that money

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:35.613
has been skimmed from the
United States contracts

01:13:35.613 --> 01:13:37.113
at these projects.

01:13:38.254 --> 01:13:43.254
- So, in this sort of
hearing you can find them,

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.350
you know, dime-a-dozen on YouTube.

01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:49.420
And it's extremely difficult if you think

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:53.240
about the kind of combat
situations we're discussing

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.570
for the principles to have
the kind of information

01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:00.040
that they need to monitor the agents

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.940
particularly problematic in Afghanistan

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.703
even when there were only
14,000 security contractors.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:13.410
You can see unlike in Iraq,

01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:15.700
almost all of them were local Afghans

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.140
for reasons we've already talked about

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.870
which creates even bigger
information asymmetry

01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:25.610
because the agents have
so much better knowledge

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:28.000
than do their principals.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.420
And so that the actual, this is,

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:35.477
I took this out of the case
and you can work through it

01:14:35.477 --> 01:14:40.360
at your leisure but this is
just the Defense Department's

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.480
chain of monitoring in Afghanistan

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.120
and down to the Host Nation Trucking.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.440
And you can see both the managing

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.580
and the reviewing of the
contract has multiple steps.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.380
And then of course some of
these are controlled also

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.360
by the State Department which had

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.770
a whole different set as well.

01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:05.520
So suffice to say monitoring
is very difficult,

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.510
very similar story in the prison industry

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:11.470
that the information you need think,

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:12.960
it's all very well to say, well,

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.250
we could use recidivism rates

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:18.810
but they don't show up for
very long periods of time.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:22.988
And you know when a prisoner
comes to a parole hearing

01:15:22.988 --> 01:15:26.440
and the parole officer says,

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.483
has the prisoner have been behaving,

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.060
if the guard who's there knows
that if that prisoner leaves,

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.550
the cell is gonna be empty
and it's gonna affect

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:40.550
the bottom line, very difficult to monitor

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:44.240
that sort of problem.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.180
And so you could just multiply
those sorts of problems

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.360
by a huge number and you
can see that monitoring

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.720
is difficult in that area as well.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.430
But we're out of time

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:02.310
and we will talk in on Tuesday

01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:03.510
about money in politics.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.507
(bright music)

Prof: Okay,
today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.234 --> 00:00:10.930
evolutionary conflicts,
and this is an area of

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:22.480
evolutionary biology that
contacts other disciplines,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.480
including the Humanities,
in interesting ways.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.334
I was reading Nature
this morning and there was a

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:32.048
review of an off-Broadway
production about the life of

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:34.979
Robert Trivers,
whose picture you're going to

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:37.293
see here,
and it was about Robert Trivers

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:40.704
as a disturbed young genius at
Harvard coming up with ideas of

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.830
conflicts of interest and
whatnot,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.959
and the actor on the stage was
going on about how tormented the

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:48.748
young Trivers was,
and he was smoking pot and all

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.766
of this stuff,
and having his great ideas,

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.350
and upsetting the faculty at
Harvard,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.938
and finally giving up in
disgust and going to Santa Cruz

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:57.809
and meeting Huey Newton and the
Black Panthers and all of that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.280
stuff.
 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.330
Okay?
 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.710
And there was a guy in the back
of the theater who was chuckling

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.750
and came up and congratulated
the actor afterwards,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.013
and he said,
"You got it just

00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:05.549
right."
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.120
And it was Bob Trivers,
who was watching.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.790
Bob's a professor at Harv--at
Rutgers now.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.400
So we're going to be talking
about interesting stuff today.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.781
And I want you to be aware that
the first part of it is

00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:19.912
well-founded,
well-supported,

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:23.176
experimental science,
where the conclusions that I'll

00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:25.420
present to you are quite
reliable.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.004
And at the end of it,
I am going to go into some

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.700
speculative stuff,
where the conclusions aren't so

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.900
reliable, but it's very
interesting.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.550
And I want to say that up front
so that--

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.795
and I'll give you a signal when
I transit from reliable stuff to

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:42.641
speculative stuff,
because I don't want you

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:46.040
thinking that the speculative
stuff is written in stone.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.780
So let's begin by looking at
these plant flowers.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.160
These are pPantago flowers.
 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.173
Plantago is something that you
may very well have dug out of

00:01:57.173 --> 00:01:57.989
your lawn.
 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.250
It is a rosette plant.
 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.283
It is a common plant around the
world, and it is gynodioecious,

00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:09.098
which means that it has two
kinds of flowers.

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:12.378
It's got flowers that have both
male and female parts,

00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:15.732
and it's got flowers that just
have the female parts and

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:17.857
greatly reduced,
or almost absent,

00:02:17.857 --> 00:02:19.680
male parts, male sterile parts.
 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.590
And evolutionary sex ratio
theory tells us,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.210
in fact, that from the point of
view of the nuclear genes,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.139
it's best to have a 50:50 sex
ratio and to be investing 50% in

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.810
male and female function;
and we will come to that soon.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.805
However, in this organism
evidently, in some of them,

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:48.377
this 50:50 sex ratio has been
subverted, and all they do is

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.780
reproduce as females.
 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.233
Now it turns out that the genes
that control this morphological

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.979
switch are in the cell
organelles;

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.449
they're not in the nuclear
genome.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.550
The genes that are sitting in
the organelles in the cell,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.508
be they mitochondria or
chloroplasts,

00:03:10.508 --> 00:03:13.860
can only get into the next
generation through female

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.110
function,
through the eggs.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.530
They are not transmitted
through pollen.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.891
It is in their interests to
take the organism that they're

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:25.258
sitting in and turn it into a
pure female.

00:03:25.258 --> 00:03:30.039
And you can see that
dramatically in the external

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.628
morphology of the plant.
 

00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:36.807
This same process goes on in
insects and in crustaceans,

00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:40.985
when they are infected by a
cytoplasmic bacterium called

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:42.050
Wolbachia.
 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.974
It is in Wolbachia's interests
only to occur in females,

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.220
because they can only get into
the next generation in eggs;

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.960
they can't get into the next
generation in sperm.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.816
And Wolbachia will feminize the
organisms that it's in,

00:03:55.816 --> 00:04:00.043
and in some cases Wolbachia
will kill the males,

00:04:00.043 --> 00:04:04.090
so that the male offspring
don't develop.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.591
So these are cases where the
conflict of interest is arising

00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:15.280
because there's selection going
on at two different levels;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.913
on the whole organism,
and then within the cell,

00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:23.069
on the cytoplasmic organelles.
 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:29.500
So if we look into our own
genome--

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.555
and I'm going to spend the last
twenty minutes of this lecture

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:37.980
looking into our own genome--
we see a very interesting thing.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.779
If there's potential,
through either hierarchical

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:48.180
selection or asymmetry of
information transmission,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.100
to generate evolutionary
conflict, then we see that we're

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.089
not even in principle the
consistent wholes that you might

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:57.279
think we are.
 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:02.357
And a very famous guy said
that, "Perhaps this is some

00:05:02.357 --> 00:05:06.209
comfort when we face agonizing
decisions,

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:08.540
when we cannot make sense of
the decisions we do make,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.401
and when the bitterness of a
civil war seems to be breaking

00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:12.980
out in our inmost heart."
 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.004
And that was Bill Hamilton,
the guy that came up with kin

00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:18.920
selection, and wrote a lot on
evolutionary conflict.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.110
And it's fairly poetic.
 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.459
And Bill actually liked haiku a
lot.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:28.470
He particularly liked Basho's
famous Narrow Road to the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.086
Deep North,
which is--Basho was one of the

00:05:32.086 --> 00:05:36.629
greatest Japanese haiku writers,
and was a favorite of Bill's.

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.190
So there are interesting
implications of what we're

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.766
talking about today,
and the outline basically is

00:05:43.766 --> 00:05:47.571
going to be how you can generate
genomic conflict out of

00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:49.370
hierarchical selection.
 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.435
I'm going to make a strong
point that the opportunities for

00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:59.850
conflict are much greater in
sexual than in asexual species.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.913
Then I'll mention that the
uniparental transmission of

00:06:04.913 --> 00:06:11.220
cytoplasmic genomes is probably
a method of conflict resolution.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.678
Then I'll go on to talk about
genomic imprinting and

00:06:13.678 --> 00:06:15.560
parent-offspring conflict in
mammals.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.790
And then that outline there
represents what is

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.800
well-established and reliable.
 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.978
When I go off this outline,
at the end, I'm going into the

00:06:27.978 --> 00:06:29.250
speculation.
 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.149
So conflict can arise in two
situations.

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:38.257
One is the Russian doll
situation, the babushka

00:06:38.257 --> 00:06:41.029
situation;
multilevel hierarchical

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.720
selection.
 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.416
That is when one selection
process is contained inside

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:51.035
another selection process;
and here you should think of

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:56.009
things like meiotic drive and
cancer.

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.105
The other situation is where
the transmission is

00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:02.112
asymmetrical,
so that the different genetic

00:07:02.112 --> 00:07:06.221
elements in the system do not
all follow the same transmission

00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:07.028
pathways.
 

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:09.490
The cytoplasmic organelles are
the classic example.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.735
They can only go through the
female line, they can't go

00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:14.180
through the male line.
 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.980
The nuclear genes are going
equally through both male and

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.778
female inheritance.
 

00:07:20.778 --> 00:07:25.790
So there's a large and striking
difference in the way the

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.278
cytoplasmic organelles are
inherited.

00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:34.057
So when we think about
two-level selection,

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:39.860
there are really two things
that can be going on.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.634
For example,
here we have two genetic

00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:45.949
entities contained inside a
larger thing.

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:47.379
Okay?
 

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:53.959
If A has a replication
advantage, at the lower level,

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:57.220
then it can just build up more
copies of itself,

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.889
and then when this larger thing
divides and reproduces,

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:06.184
it will end up in more copies,
because at this stage it was

00:08:06.184 --> 00:08:07.740
reproducing faster.
 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.000
Think petite mutation in yeast.
 

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.689
A petite mutation in yeast is a
mitochondrial mutation,

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:18.985
and basically what the petite
mutation does is it cuts out a

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:22.480
chunk of the DNA in the
mitochondrial genome,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.778
so that the mitochondrial
genome can be replicated faster.

00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:29.130
Now, of course,
if you cut out a bunch of the

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.605
mitochondrial genome,
the mitochondria aren't doing

00:08:32.605 --> 00:08:35.500
their job of being a good energy
factory so well,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.490
for that cell that they're
living in.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.001
So they're gaining an
individual advantage from

00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:42.022
mitochondria,
but they're damaging the

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.480
interests of the cell that
contains them.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.080
And what happens is that the
ones that cut out the DNA,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.480
that can replicate faster,
do build up a replication

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.678
advantage at the lower level.
 

00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:56.894
The other possibility in
two-level selection is that

00:08:56.894 --> 00:08:59.038
there's a segregation advantage.
 

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:02.840
There are just as many copies
made of each type,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.982
at the lower level,
but in the process of then

00:09:05.982 --> 00:09:10.284
forming say the gametes--
so in any replication process,

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:13.918
either mitotic or meiotic,
if there's a segregation

00:09:13.918 --> 00:09:16.384
advantage,
one of them is going to get

00:09:16.384 --> 00:09:17.570
into more copies.
 

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.899
So it takes the same number,
and then just in the process of

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:23.440
making the new cells it gains an
advantage.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.580
And think here meiotic drive.
 

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.456
Okay, so that's the
paradigmatic example for

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:31.620
segregation advantage.
 

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.254
So in the petite mutation in
yeast, what's going on basically

00:09:36.254 --> 00:09:40.658
is that there's a deletion in
the mitochondrial genome.

00:09:40.658 --> 00:09:43.668
That allows the shorter genome
to be replicated faster.

00:09:43.668 --> 00:09:45.639
It builds up a big population
in the cell.

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:50.022
However, there's a disadvantage
at the higher level,

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:53.029
and that is defective
metabolism.

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:56.370
The result is that the cell
lineage goes extinct.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.308
And so people who work on yeast
in the lab--

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:01.875
if you just take a big
population of yeast and you

00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:04.389
played it out in generation
after generation,

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:07.139
these petite mutations keep
popping up,

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:12.038
and they spread,
and then they go extinct.

00:10:12.038 --> 00:10:15.009
They have a lower level
replication advantage,

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:18.772
but they have a high cost for
the cells that contain them,

00:10:18.772 --> 00:10:20.288
and they disappear.
 

00:10:20.288 --> 00:10:29.129
It's almost exactly analogous
to cancer.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:32.582
In an asexual lineage,
the only kind of conflict that

00:10:32.582 --> 00:10:36.434
is in principle possible is one
selection process contained

00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:40.196
inside another one,
and the conflict would occur if

00:10:40.196 --> 00:10:44.740
the lower level response differs
from the higher level response;

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.205
so if what's good at the lower
level is bad at the higher

00:10:48.205 --> 00:10:48.700
level.
 

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.779
Petite mutation is a good
example.

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:54.530
There's no horizontal
transmission there,

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.970
because there's no sexual
reproduction going on.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.409
So two independent lineages are
not coming into contact with

00:11:01.409 --> 00:11:04.563
each other and mixing;
they're staying separate

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:06.100
through generations.
 

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.697
And so there isn't any way for
the lower level response to

00:11:09.697 --> 00:11:12.600
escape the fate of the upper
level response.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.393
So if there's a significant
conflict, a significant cost,

00:11:16.393 --> 00:11:18.288
the lineages will die out.
 

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:24.456
So this is something that
actually can drive asexual

00:11:24.456 --> 00:11:26.028
extinction.
 

00:11:26.028 --> 00:11:30.744
In a sexual lineage,
sex is creating genetic

00:11:30.744 --> 00:11:34.908
variation within the nuclear
genome.

00:11:34.908 --> 00:11:39.716
It has the potential to create
genetic variation in cytoplasmic

00:11:39.716 --> 00:11:42.365
genomes,
and it creates opportunities

00:11:42.365 --> 00:11:45.830
for non-chromosomal genetic
elements to change hosts;

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.629
particularly interestingly in
bacteria it does this.

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:55.570
So some kinds of mechanisms,
that are going on during sex,

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.210
formally resemble pathogen
transmission;

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.761
the transmission of--when you
cough up a virus and it gets

00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:07.504
into your roommate,
basically a genome is moving

00:12:07.504 --> 00:12:10.908
horizontally from your body into
another body,

00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:14.356
and reproducing there,
and during sex there are

00:12:14.356 --> 00:12:18.028
opportunities for this kind of
thing to go on,

00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:24.001
from one bacterium to another,
and certainly in organisms like

00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:26.778
us,
from one organism to another.

00:12:26.778 --> 00:12:31.413
So one cost of sex might be the
potential it creates for

00:12:31.413 --> 00:12:33.519
inter-genomic conflict.
 

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:36.972
I'm not talking here directly
about sexually transmitted

00:12:36.972 --> 00:12:39.360
diseases like gonorrhea or
syphilis.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.509
I'm talking about the
possibility that genetic

00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:49.658
elements infect the genomes of
other cells.

00:12:49.658 --> 00:12:52.352
So, for example,
there could be a conflict

00:12:52.352 --> 00:12:55.308
between bacterial plasmids and
chromosomes.

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:58.590
A little background on
bacterial genetics.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.775
Bacteria usually contain
plasmids, and these things are

00:13:02.775 --> 00:13:07.504
small circular genetic elements
and they live in the bacterial

00:13:07.504 --> 00:13:08.590
cytoplasm.
 

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.850
So you can think of them as
genetic parasites.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.804
The rest of the bacterial
genome is a large single

00:13:15.804 --> 00:13:20.649
circular chromosome which is
attached to the cell wall of the

00:13:20.649 --> 00:13:21.778
bacterium.
 

00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:26.427
So think of the bacterium as a
balloon that has a circular

00:13:26.427 --> 00:13:29.769
rubber band attached to the cell
wall,

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:33.845
but then out floating in the
balloon are these much smaller

00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:37.570
plasmids that contain DNA and do
particular things.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.373
The plasmids often are the
elements in the bacterium that

00:13:41.373 --> 00:13:44.090
have genes for antibiotic
resistance,

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:49.980
and they can be advantageous
when antibiotics are present.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.389
There are other plasmids that
will addict their host cells,

00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:58.115
the bacterial cells,
to their presence by making a

00:13:58.115 --> 00:14:00.169
poison antidote system.
 

00:14:00.169 --> 00:14:00.649
Okay?
 

00:14:00.649 --> 00:14:05.962
So basically what they're doing
is that they're protecting their

00:14:05.962 --> 00:14:11.023
own cells and they are producing
chemicals that destroy cells

00:14:11.023 --> 00:14:14.059
that don't contain the plasmids.
 

00:14:14.059 --> 00:14:16.308
And this is a general principle.
 

00:14:16.308 --> 00:14:20.802
If you make a long distance
poison and a short distance

00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:25.376
antidote, you protect the
environment that you're in and

00:14:25.376 --> 00:14:28.038
you destroy the competition.
 

00:14:28.038 --> 00:14:32.158
So any bacterial cell that
doesn't inherit the antidote,

00:14:32.158 --> 00:14:34.706
via a plasmid,
but gets the poison,

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:35.678
will die.
 

00:14:35.678 --> 00:14:39.152
So that changes selection
dynamics, at a higher level,

00:14:39.152 --> 00:14:42.690
and this plasmid will spread
through the population.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.667
Very similar to that,
in some sense,

00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:49.850
is segregation distortion.
 

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:55.350
There is a gene that was first
found in mice and--

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.370
this is important--it's just an
arbitrary accident of

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:04.240
developmental biology that this
segregation distorter happens to

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.409
also result in mice with short
tails.

00:15:07.409 --> 00:15:09.350
Okay?
 

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.649
That's just an accident of
pleiotropy.

00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:16.710
This gene has effects on both
segregation distortion and on

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.320
tail length, in mice.
 

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:25.674
So you can think of the fact
that it's affecting the tail as

00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:29.811
just a marker;
it's just kind of like having a

00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:31.470
reporter gene in there.
 

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.717
And we'll simplify the
situation and just consider two

00:15:35.717 --> 00:15:36.519
alleles.
 

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:39.600
There's a t and a normal allele
that we call .

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.432
Okay, so these are the two
versions of this gene that are

00:15:42.432 --> 00:15:44.759
sitting at the same place in the
chromosome.

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:49.649
If you have tt homozygotes,
they're lethal or sterile.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:51.672
So if that were the only thing
that were going on,

00:15:51.672 --> 00:15:54.360
you'd never see this thing;
it would die out real quick.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.960
But if you have a mouse that is
heterozygous with t and ,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.580
they produce--they're fine,
they live just fine--

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.240
and they produce 90 to 100%
t-bearing sperm.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.278
This is again done with a long
distance poison and a short

00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:12.720
distance antidote system.
 

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:20.384
So sitting there in the testes
of the mouse is a cell that is

00:16:20.384 --> 00:16:24.283
making sperm,
and some of them have the t and

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:27.692
some of them don't,
and the sperm that have the t

00:16:27.692 --> 00:16:31.585
in them are making poison,
which is going over and killing

00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:33.460
the ones that don't have the t.
 

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.918
They're sitting spatially right
next to them in the testes,

00:16:37.918 --> 00:16:40.690
and the sperm that have the t
are also making an antidote,

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.740
but it's only effective inside
their own sperm.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.966
So basically what's going on is
that t's just wiping out the

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:52.264
competition, inside the testes,
and that ends up producing 90

00:16:52.264 --> 00:16:54.269
to 100% t-bearing sperm.
 

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:57.765
So you have hierarchical
selection at the level of the

00:16:57.765 --> 00:16:58.360
gamete.
 

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.416
You have got selection for t
and against t,

00:17:02.416 --> 00:17:08.114
up at the level of the diploid
individuals, because up there

00:17:08.114 --> 00:17:12.460
the tt homozygotes are lethal or
sterile.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:19.304
So a 50:50 sex ratio--ignore
that, this is irrelevant right

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.090
here;
this is for,

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:26.298
this sentence snuck in here for
a different kind of gene action.

00:17:26.298 --> 00:17:30.657
So this sentence is--and I
regret that, I should've edited

00:17:30.657 --> 00:17:31.500
that out.
 

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.718
If the tt homozygotes didn't
die, but they suffered a

00:17:34.718 --> 00:17:37.555
sufficiently small,
sub-lethal fitness

00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:41.490
reduction--so if this part here
were not true--

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.250
then t would spread,
and eventually if t spreads all

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:49.428
the way through the population,
everybody's got the antidote,

00:17:49.428 --> 00:17:52.650
and you don't have any
segregation distortion anymore,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.318
and everything goes back to
normal.

00:17:55.318 --> 00:17:58.298
If that is the case,
once t takes over the

00:17:58.298 --> 00:18:02.150
population, there's no more
segregation distortion.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.863
This introduces the interesting
possibility that most species

00:18:05.863 --> 00:18:09.204
may have had a history of
segregation distortion and we

00:18:09.204 --> 00:18:12.905
just don't notice it anymore,
because they've gone to

00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:13.598
fixation.
 

00:18:13.598 --> 00:18:18.019
In fact, we don't have any easy
method of detecting that.

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:23.584
We may see the traces of that,
written in the history of

00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:27.528
things like the fairness of
meiosis,

00:18:27.528 --> 00:18:31.637
but we can't go out right now
and easily find genetic or

00:18:31.637 --> 00:18:35.446
biochemical evidence that we
have fossil segregation

00:18:35.446 --> 00:18:38.509
distorters sitting in our own
genome.

00:18:38.509 --> 00:18:43.630
It seems likely that we do,
but we don't know.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.940
Now what about conflicts
between the nucleus and the

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.720
cytoplasm?
 

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.250
Well any cytoplasmic genome,
that's replicating faster,

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:56.755
gets a segregation advantage,
because there isn't any meiotic

00:18:56.755 --> 00:19:00.960
mechanism that assures fair
segregation of organelles.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.019
The chromosomes are controlled
by the spindle apparatus.

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.099
They line up at the plate,
at the middle of the cell.

00:19:06.099 --> 00:19:07.598
They make two copies.
 

00:19:07.598 --> 00:19:09.805
The spindle grabs one copy and
pulls it one way,

00:19:09.805 --> 00:19:11.869
and the other copy and pulls it
the other.

00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:12.118
Okay?
 

00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:15.538
So that's really fair,
that's exactly 50:50.

00:19:15.538 --> 00:19:17.858
The organelles are out there
floating around.

00:19:17.858 --> 00:19:20.380
They're not attached to a
spindle when the cell divides,

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.262
and so basically if they can
just make more copies of

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.714
themselves,
they'll have a better chance of

00:19:25.714 --> 00:19:27.500
getting into the dividing cells.
 

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.778
If you had biparental
inheritance of cytoplasmic

00:19:31.778 --> 00:19:34.316
genomes,
that would mean that in the

00:19:34.316 --> 00:19:37.390
same cytoplasm you would have
genetically different,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.478
unrelated mitochondria;
genetically different,

00:19:41.478 --> 00:19:42.960
unrelated chloroplasts.
 

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.633
And the consequence of that
would be conflict,

00:19:46.633 --> 00:19:50.960
and that would be expressed as
an organelle cancer.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.170
If you only get the cytoplasmic
genome from one parent,

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.650
then they'll very likely all be
the same genotype--

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.038
any kind of process like this
going on in the past would have

00:20:01.038 --> 00:20:04.088
assured that there would only be
one left standing,

00:20:04.088 --> 00:20:08.112
in that parent--and therefore
they're not in conflict with

00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:09.028
each other.
 

00:20:09.028 --> 00:20:11.446
So, in fact,
you all only contain

00:20:11.446 --> 00:20:13.940
mitochondria from your mothers.
 

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.026
It's extremely rare that a
human will ever have a

00:20:18.026 --> 00:20:20.578
mitochondrion from a father.
 

00:20:20.578 --> 00:20:24.013
It does happen,
but it's a one in a billion

00:20:24.013 --> 00:20:24.750
chance.
 

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.348
Okay?
 

00:20:26.348 --> 00:20:32.912
So those are some of the well
established cell level scenarios

00:20:32.912 --> 00:20:36.140
in which conflict plays out.
 

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.402
And before I go into the
reproductive problems in humans

00:20:40.402 --> 00:20:45.323
that result from conflict,
I'd just like to emphasize that

00:20:45.323 --> 00:20:50.325
this vision of evolution doesn't
sound like the beautifully

00:20:50.325 --> 00:20:54.118
adapted world where all is for
the best,

00:20:54.118 --> 00:20:56.230
in the best of all possible
worlds.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:02.422
This is a vision of evolution
in which there is continual

00:21:02.422 --> 00:21:06.175
conflict,
and in some cases it's never

00:21:06.175 --> 00:21:09.761
resolved,
which means that in some cases

00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:13.358
both sides are paying a
continual price.

00:21:13.358 --> 00:21:19.548
So that's quite a different way
of looking at the world.

00:21:19.548 --> 00:21:23.868
And if you're trying to derive
simplistic take-home points,

00:21:23.868 --> 00:21:27.140
from the evolutionary view of
the human condition,

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.098
one of them would be,
as you'll see in a few minutes,

00:21:30.098 --> 00:21:35.365
that there are probably
long-term conflicts that are

00:21:35.365 --> 00:21:37.119
never resolved.
 

00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:41.108
So reproductive problems.
 

00:21:41.108 --> 00:21:44.954
In mammals there are conflicts
between mother and fetus over

00:21:44.954 --> 00:21:48.150
how much the mother should
invest in the fetus.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.880
The symptoms of that are
pre-eclampsia and diabetes.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.907
There are conflicts between
mother and father over maternal

00:21:55.907 --> 00:21:58.825
provisioning,
and those are related to

00:21:58.825 --> 00:22:01.608
genetic imprinting of growth
genes,

00:22:01.608 --> 00:22:06.068
and there are disturbances and
a tug-of-war balance produced by

00:22:06.068 --> 00:22:10.528
evolutionary conflict in genes
that are expressed in the infant

00:22:10.528 --> 00:22:13.540
brain,
and those are thought to deal

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.150
with mental illness.
 

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:20.704
This is where the line is
between well-established science

00:22:20.704 --> 00:22:22.460
and speculation.
 

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:28.631
So the arenas in which these
things play out are in the

00:22:28.631 --> 00:22:34.460
placenta and uterus,
and in the developing brain.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.598
And this is the sequence of
ideas;

00:22:37.598 --> 00:22:39.200
so I'll give you a little
intellectual history.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.048
1961, '62, Bill Hamilton has
the idea of kin selection,

00:22:43.048 --> 00:22:47.078
the idea that we can- a gene
can increase its fitness,

00:22:47.078 --> 00:22:49.400
either by its actions on my own
body,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.105
or by influencing the actions
that I take to improve the

00:22:54.105 --> 00:22:58.470
reproductive success of
relatives in which that gene

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.608
also probably exists.
 

00:23:00.608 --> 00:23:03.722
Then Bob Trivers developed
Bill's idea into

00:23:03.722 --> 00:23:05.798
parent-offspring conflict.
 

00:23:05.798 --> 00:23:10.261
And the idea of
parent-offspring conflict--which

00:23:10.261 --> 00:23:15.390
I'll state a couple of times to
make clear--is this.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.558
A mother is 50% related to all
of her offspring.

00:23:19.558 --> 00:23:23.310
She is interested in making
sure that each of them has an

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.460
equal chance therefore to have
grandchildren.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.599
Now switch your point of view
to one of the offspring.

00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:36.029
It's 100% related to itself;
it's 50% related to a full sib;

00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:38.950
and it's only 25% related to a
half-sib.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:43.092
So from the point of view of a
gene which is sitting in our

00:23:43.092 --> 00:23:46.250
focal offspring,
it wants to titrate its

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.792
mother's investment away from
its potential future siblings

00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:54.020
and into itself,
until the probability of

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.971
grandchildren,
through itself,

00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:59.288
exactly matches the probability
of grandchildren through the

00:23:59.288 --> 00:24:01.930
others multiplied by degree of
relationship.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.640
Okay?
 

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.356
It will have a full-sib if the
species is monogamous,

00:24:07.356 --> 00:24:11.217
and it has a probability of
half-sibs if the species is

00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:13.740
polygamous;
if the mother mates with

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.710
multiple males.
 

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.278
So that was Bob's insight.
 

00:24:17.278 --> 00:24:21.021
Bill got the Crawford Prize,
which is the Nobel Prize in

00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:23.674
Evolutionary Biology,
for kin selection,

00:24:23.674 --> 00:24:27.009
and Bob got it for
parent-offspring conflict.

00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:29.507
So those are prizes that are
worth oh six or

00:24:29.507 --> 00:24:32.586
seven-hundred-thousand dollars,
and like Nobel Prizes,

00:24:32.586 --> 00:24:35.200
they are awarded in Sweden,
in Stockholm.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.680
And so these were seen as big,
important ideas.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.758
Now David Haig then picked up
on Bob's idea,

00:24:41.758 --> 00:24:44.623
and he said,
"Well, there's not only

00:24:44.623 --> 00:24:48.058
conflict between parent and
offspring."

00:24:48.058 --> 00:24:51.051
And that conflict,
by the way, is also realized

00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:53.588
through imprinted genes in
pregnancy.

00:24:53.588 --> 00:24:56.787
There is conflict between the
mother and the father over how

00:24:56.787 --> 00:25:00.146
much the mother should give to
the baby, and the baby take from

00:25:00.146 --> 00:25:00.960
the mother.
 

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.155
So if the father can put into
the baby a gene that then

00:25:05.155 --> 00:25:10.130
extracts more from that mother
than the mother wants to give,

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.930
the father can gain,
to a certain point,

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:12.798
an advantage.
 

00:25:12.798 --> 00:25:16.022
This isn't an absolute thing,
it's just saying that there is

00:25:16.022 --> 00:25:19.137
a range of investment where it
is not advantageous for the

00:25:19.137 --> 00:25:22.971
mother to give more to the baby,
but it is advantageous for the

00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:26.049
father to get the mother to give
more to his baby.

00:25:26.049 --> 00:25:27.210
Okay?
 

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:32.068
And this is mediated by genomic
imprinting.

00:25:32.068 --> 00:25:37.605
The final step in this little
bit of intellectual history is

00:25:37.605 --> 00:25:42.776
Bernie Crespi and Chris Badcock,
who came up with the idea that

00:25:42.776 --> 00:25:45.480
this conflict that David Haig
identified,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.685
which is going on during
pregnancy and is probably

00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:52.480
mediated mostly by genes that
are having interaction in the

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.836
fetus and in the placenta,
extends into early life during

00:25:57.836 --> 00:26:02.564
the period of suckling,
before the child is weaned,

00:26:02.564 --> 00:26:06.472
and the conflict is then
expressed in genes that are in

00:26:06.472 --> 00:26:10.496
the brain of the infant,
and when their tug of war,

00:26:10.496 --> 00:26:13.490
which is in evolutionary
equilibrium,

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.378
is disrupted,
Crespi and Badcock think that

00:26:16.378 --> 00:26:18.099
you get mental disease.
 

00:26:18.099 --> 00:26:20.400
So this is Bill.
 

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.769
This is taken on the Amazon.
 

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:29.383
Bill died in the year 2000,
after trying to find the source

00:26:29.383 --> 00:26:31.608
of AIDS in the Congo.
 

00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:36.077
He had gone to the North Kivu
to see whether or not he could

00:26:36.077 --> 00:26:40.849
find chimpanzees whose DNA might
match DNA in polio vaccine from

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:42.288
the late 1950s.
 

00:26:42.288 --> 00:26:45.744
There was a hypothesis at that
time that that's how HIV got

00:26:45.744 --> 00:26:47.950
into humans, through polio
vaccine.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.152
It turned out to be wrong,
and Bill died just after that

00:26:51.152 --> 00:26:51.559
trip.
 

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:54.078
This is Bob Trivers, recently.
 

00:26:54.078 --> 00:26:57.625
He's a prof now at Rutgers,
and Bob had the

00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:02.436
parent-offspring conflict
hypothesis, as a grad student at

00:27:02.436 --> 00:27:04.970
Harvard in 1969,
'70, '71;

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.190
about there.
 

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.944
This is David Haig,
currently a professor at

00:27:08.944 --> 00:27:11.178
Harvard,
and the guy who came up with

00:27:11.178 --> 00:27:14.234
the observation that there's a
very intriguing connection

00:27:14.234 --> 00:27:17.162
between the imprinting,
the differential imprinting of

00:27:17.162 --> 00:27:19.390
genes in the male and the female
germ lines,

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:23.298
and the control of growth by
the embryo.

00:27:23.298 --> 00:27:25.690
And this is Bernie Crespi and
Chris Badcock.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:29.671
So Bernie's at Simon Fraser in
Vancouver, British Columbia,

00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:32.827
and Chris is in London,
at the London School of

00:27:32.827 --> 00:27:33.788
Economics.
 

00:27:33.788 --> 00:27:37.505
So these are the guys who had
these ideas about evolutionary

00:27:37.505 --> 00:27:39.519
conflict, expressed in humans.
 

00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:44.865
There was a news item on the
local television station the

00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:50.403
other night that Jacob Lykke's
research on preeclampsia had

00:27:50.403 --> 00:27:54.588
just been published,
and it was sort of playing up

00:27:54.588 --> 00:27:58.559
the idea that research from Yale
Medical School reveals important

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:00.980
pregnancy complication
consequences;

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.568
women who have preeclampsia
have worse health later in life.

00:28:04.568 --> 00:28:08.720
That basically is a
continuation of this idea.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:14.769
The OB/GYN Department at Yale
Medical School has picked up on

00:28:14.769 --> 00:28:16.078
this stuff.
 

00:28:16.078 --> 00:28:20.259
Okay, so let's run through the
logic.

00:28:20.259 --> 00:28:23.579
The conflict between mother and
fetus over maternal provisioning

00:28:23.579 --> 00:28:25.792
is basically this:
the fetus is selected to

00:28:25.792 --> 00:28:28.692
extract more from the mother
than the mother is selected

00:28:28.692 --> 00:28:29.430
provide.
 

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.980
It's 100% related to itself.
 

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.099
She's 50% related to each of
her offspring.

00:28:34.099 --> 00:28:36.348
It wants to take more from her.
 

00:28:36.348 --> 00:28:39.619
She wants to hold some back,
so she can give the same amount

00:28:39.619 --> 00:28:40.838
to future offspring.
 

00:28:40.838 --> 00:28:46.058
The way that it will do this is
by using tissue in the placenta

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:50.436
to secrete hormones into the
mother to manipulate her

00:28:50.436 --> 00:28:51.700
metabolism.
 

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.440
It also does it,
by the way, morphologically.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:59.702
It is fetal tissue in the
placenta that invades maternal

00:28:59.702 --> 00:29:01.478
tissue,
aggressively,

00:29:01.478 --> 00:29:04.941
and establishes tighter and
tighter connections with the

00:29:04.941 --> 00:29:06.828
maternal blood circulation.
 

00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:10.193
So if you look at the origin of
the cells in the placenta,

00:29:10.193 --> 00:29:13.557
there's a morphological story
of conflict written there as

00:29:13.557 --> 00:29:14.088
well.
 

00:29:14.088 --> 00:29:18.387
So the symptoms experienced by
the mother are high maternal

00:29:18.387 --> 00:29:22.019
blood pressure and
pregnancy-related diabetes,

00:29:22.019 --> 00:29:25.114
and this will happen
particularly when this gets a

00:29:25.114 --> 00:29:26.440
bit out of balance.
 

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.777
So if you're a baby,
sitting there in the womb,

00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:31.980
and you want to get more out of
mommy, you can do two things.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.814
You can pump up her blood
pressure so it'll force more

00:29:34.814 --> 00:29:37.058
nutrient through the placental
barrier,

00:29:37.058 --> 00:29:40.836
and you can play with her
metabolism so there's more sugar

00:29:40.836 --> 00:29:41.828
in her blood.
 

00:29:41.828 --> 00:29:46.990
Too much of that and the mother
gets pretty sick.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.960
This is the arena in which it
occurs.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.578
This is the fetal portion of
the placenta here;

00:29:56.578 --> 00:29:59.645
you can see the invasive blood
vessels going in,

00:29:59.645 --> 00:30:00.430
over here.
 

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:06.957
This is the maternal portion
out here, and this is where the

00:30:06.957 --> 00:30:10.940
exchange of nutrients is
mediated.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:16.230
So the evolutionary logic
behind this is that--

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:21.308
if we now look at the
mother-father conflict--

00:30:21.308 --> 00:30:23.402
the father isn't going to be
related to the mother's later

00:30:23.402 --> 00:30:25.640
offspring,
if they have other fathers.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.118
And, by the way,
I'm now going to make a series

00:30:28.118 --> 00:30:31.407
of statements that sound like
humans are engaged in absolutely

00:30:31.407 --> 00:30:33.078
outrageous moral practices.
 

00:30:33.078 --> 00:30:36.519
None of this logic necessarily
is going on in current

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:38.548
evolution,
in our current human

00:30:38.548 --> 00:30:41.762
population, because you can
demonstrate these effects in

00:30:41.762 --> 00:30:44.009
mice,
and we shared ancestors with

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:46.220
mice about sixty million years
ago.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.440
Okay?
 

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.051
So a lot of the machinery
that's being detected in mice

00:30:51.051 --> 00:30:54.509
and in sheep and in humans,
that is shared,

00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:59.440
could very well have had to do
with the polygamy,

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.998
or lack of monogamy,
in ancestral mammals a long

00:31:04.998 --> 00:31:06.299
time ago.
 

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:08.480
Or it could still be going on.
 

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:14.653
Now there is an asymmetry in
the male and female reproductive

00:31:14.653 --> 00:31:16.298
possibilities.
 

00:31:16.298 --> 00:31:18.663
The father's reproductive
success depends on his

00:31:18.663 --> 00:31:19.720
successful matings.
 

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.261
The mother's reproductive
success depends on the number of

00:31:23.261 --> 00:31:25.500
offspring she personally can
bear.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.594
And if you state that brutally,
he can have several children

00:31:28.594 --> 00:31:31.059
and other females,
while she's dealing with this

00:31:31.059 --> 00:31:31.480
one.
 

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.140
So here is a Mormon polygamist.
 

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.500
He has two wives.
 

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:44.417
This brother is 50% related to
this sister, and 25% related to

00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:46.119
this brother.
 

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:47.609
Okay?
 

00:31:47.609 --> 00:31:49.960
So bear that scenario in mind.
 

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.759
That is the sort of thing which
is driving the selection

00:31:52.759 --> 00:31:53.269
pattern.
 

00:31:53.269 --> 00:32:01.090
Rare today in humans;
possibly much commoner in the

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:01.950
past.
 

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.730
What does this have to do with
imprinting, and what is

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:05.778
imprinting anyway?
 

00:32:05.778 --> 00:32:09.773
Imprinting is a process of
methylating genes,

00:32:09.773 --> 00:32:13.858
and if you imprint a gene,
you turn it off;

00:32:13.858 --> 00:32:20.900
it will not be transcribed if
it's methylated.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.650
Imprinting is used in a number
of contexts.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.662
It's an epigenetic mechanism
that's used in development to

00:32:26.662 --> 00:32:27.720
control cell fate.
 

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.057
But the kind of imprinting that
we're talking about today is a

00:32:31.057 --> 00:32:31.880
special kind.
 

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.140
It's differential imprinting by
sex,

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.327
and it's not happening during
the development of the body in

00:32:39.327 --> 00:32:43.660
order to decide whether a cell
becomes a liver cell or a brain

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.152
cell,
it's happening in the germ line

00:32:46.152 --> 00:32:48.720
of the parents,
just before the gametes are

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.308
produced.
 

00:32:49.308 --> 00:32:53.980
And the point is that the
father is imprinting certain

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.328
sets of genes and turning them
off,

00:32:57.328 --> 00:33:01.527
and the mother is imprinting
other sets of genes and turning

00:33:01.527 --> 00:33:02.309
them off.
 

00:33:02.309 --> 00:33:05.710
Okay?
 

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:10.018
These genes that are imprinted
in the germ line are not

00:33:10.018 --> 00:33:14.247
expressed in the fetus,
and they are then reprogrammed

00:33:14.247 --> 00:33:16.960
in the germ line of the adult.
 

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.718
The adult could be either male
or female.

00:33:18.718 --> 00:33:19.068
Right?
 

00:33:19.068 --> 00:33:25.118
So when it makes its gametes,
in the next generation,

00:33:25.118 --> 00:33:28.903
it doesn't make them with
programming the imprinting

00:33:28.903 --> 00:33:31.650
pattern it had when it was a
baby,

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:36.246
it makes them with the
imprinting pattern that is

00:33:36.246 --> 00:33:38.640
appropriate to its sex.
 

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.025
What's going on is this:
The father is turning off genes

00:33:42.025 --> 00:33:44.608
that down-regulate growth in the
embryo.

00:33:44.608 --> 00:33:47.960
The mother is turning off genes
that up-regulate growth,

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.858
and so basically--it's kind of
double negative,

00:33:51.858 --> 00:33:54.325
because the father's turning
off stuff that acts in the

00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:56.606
mother's interests,
and the mother's turning off

00:33:56.606 --> 00:33:58.568
stuff that acts in the father's
interests.

00:33:58.568 --> 00:34:01.926
But the upshot of that is that
the father is trying to program

00:34:01.926 --> 00:34:05.559
the embryo to extract more than
the mother is prepared to give,

00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:08.760
and the mother is resisting.
 

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.548
You can only see this going on
when you disturb the

00:34:12.548 --> 00:34:13.610
equilibrium.
 

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.900
You can disturb the equilibrium
in a number of ways.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.858
You can do it by genetically
transforming mice,

00:34:19.858 --> 00:34:23.782
and the gene that you choose to
disturb the equilibrium is the

00:34:23.782 --> 00:34:25.969
gene that does the imprinting.
 

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:26.909
Okay?
 

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.590
So you mutate that gene,
or you delete it,

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.880
and then you observe the
outcome.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.489
And the effect is roughly plus
or minus 10% in birth weight.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:41.413
So if the father's genes
are--if the mother's genes are

00:34:41.413 --> 00:34:44.744
not doing their job,
so that only the father's

00:34:44.744 --> 00:34:48.449
interests are expressed,
the embryo is about 10% heavier;

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:52.039
and if it's the other way
around, the embryo is about 10%

00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:52.679
lighter.
 

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:58.465
This scenario is also supported
by the fact that if you look at

00:34:58.465 --> 00:35:04.063
all of the genes in the body,
there are only about 100 or 200

00:35:04.063 --> 00:35:06.210
that are imprinted.
 

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:10.291
There are very few that are
imprinted differently in the

00:35:10.291 --> 00:35:14.141
mother and in the father,
and the ones that are imprinted

00:35:14.141 --> 00:35:17.400
differently in the mother and
the father mostly have to do

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.460
with the control of fetal
growth.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.360
So it's a very special set of
genes,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.123
and they are clearly associated
with the specific function of

00:35:24.123 --> 00:35:26.661
fetal growth,
rather with the millions of

00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:29.329
other things that genes do in
the body.

00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:33.329
So up to here,
you can do nice manipulation

00:35:33.329 --> 00:35:37.996
experiments on mice,
and these have also been done

00:35:37.996 --> 00:35:42.760
in things like sheep,
and the scenario stands.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:48.219
Now, going into speculation.
 

00:35:48.219 --> 00:35:53.911
The primary site is the
placenta, where there are small

00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:58.760
deviations that can benefit
child or mother.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.420
Large deviations are costly to
both.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.768
So the normal situation might
be that there would be a small

00:36:04.768 --> 00:36:05.449
deviation.
 

00:36:05.449 --> 00:36:08.367
You only get a big deviation
and disease when there's a real

00:36:08.367 --> 00:36:11.135
disruption of the imprinting
patterns and they get out of

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:13.217
balance;
so that if you're thinking of a

00:36:13.217 --> 00:36:14.800
tug of war, one side falls over.
 

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.409
Okay?
 

00:36:17.409 --> 00:36:19.820
Where are the rest of these
genes?

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.768
They're in the brain.
 

00:36:22.768 --> 00:36:27.518
These are the sex
differentially imprinted genes,

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:29.389
the ones that are imprinted
differently in mother and

00:36:29.389 --> 00:36:31.298
father,
and they're not controlling

00:36:31.298 --> 00:36:34.170
fetal growth or being expressed
in the placenta,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.869
but they are being expressed in
the brain.

00:36:35.869 --> 00:36:40.679
And this is now Crespi and
Badcock's idea.

00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:45.284
A deviation toward paternal
gene expression should result in

00:36:45.284 --> 00:36:47.860
a relatively selfish offspring.
 

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.632
So it should be trying to take
more from the mother,

00:36:50.632 --> 00:36:53.840
and it should be doing it now
through infant behavior rather

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.690
than through fetal physiology.
 

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:59.782
And a deviation towards
maternal gene expression should

00:36:59.782 --> 00:37:04.253
result in an easy offspring that
would be letting the mother

00:37:04.253 --> 00:37:08.119
relax and store up nutrition for
the next baby.

00:37:08.119 --> 00:37:15.686
So we can't do experiments on
humans to--like we can say with

00:37:15.686 --> 00:37:18.840
knockout genes in mice.
 

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.137
So what Crespi and Badcock have
done is they've looked at

00:37:22.137 --> 00:37:24.960
neurogenomic syndromes,
single gene effects,

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.539
and idiopathic psychiatric
conditions,

00:37:27.539 --> 00:37:31.824
to see what happens when this
tug of war in the brain is

00:37:31.824 --> 00:37:32.760
disturbed.
 

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:40.219
Well probably the most
revealing early observation--

00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:42.469
this was actually picked up by
David Haig,

00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:47.356
before Bernie got into this--is
that there are imprinted genes

00:37:47.356 --> 00:37:51.007
on chromosome 15,
that are expressed in the

00:37:51.007 --> 00:37:55.679
brain, and if the maternal copy
is deleted or modified,

00:37:55.679 --> 00:37:58.248
you get one syndrome,
and if the paternal copy of

00:37:58.248 --> 00:38:01.300
this same gene is deleted,
you get another syndrome.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.840
So Angelman syndrome is that
the maternal copy is deleted.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.610
The paternal copy is only
imprinted in the brain;

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.731
it's not imprinted in other
parts of the body,

00:38:10.731 --> 00:38:13.090
it's very specifically
imprinted in this tissue.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:18.318
And Angelman children are
happy, retarded and

00:38:18.318 --> 00:38:20.219
uncoordinated.
 

00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:24.030
The same gene,
but with paternal copy deleted,

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:28.559
maternal copy imprinted,
you get, after the age of two,

00:38:28.559 --> 00:38:31.110
you get uncontrolled eating,
hypogonadism,

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.748
delayed puberty,
and a completely different

00:38:33.748 --> 00:38:34.440
syndrome.
 

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.599
Okay?
 

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:39.329
So the Angleman types,
with father's interests

00:38:39.329 --> 00:38:42.561
over-expressed,
have prolonged suckling,

00:38:42.561 --> 00:38:44.882
frequent crying,
hyperactive,

00:38:44.882 --> 00:38:48.034
sleepless;
they're difficult children and

00:38:48.034 --> 00:38:49.980
they have high rates of autism.
 

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.972
And the Prader-Willi children,
with maternal interest

00:38:52.972 --> 00:38:55.592
over-expressed,
don't feed very well,

00:38:55.592 --> 00:38:58.561
they cry weakly,
they're inactive or sleepy,

00:38:58.561 --> 00:39:00.889
and they have high rates of
psychosis;

00:39:00.889 --> 00:39:04.630
some kinds of psychosis are
called schizophrenia.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:10.282
So what Crespi and Badcock
proposed is that if there's an

00:39:10.282 --> 00:39:14.119
imbalance during fetal
development,

00:39:14.119 --> 00:39:16.797
in the brain,
towards paternally expressed

00:39:16.797 --> 00:39:20.130
imprinted genes,
you get higher birth weight,

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.286
a larger brain,
faster growth,

00:39:22.286 --> 00:39:23.679
a cost to the mother.
 

00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:27.139
The costs to the mother are
coming from selfish,

00:39:27.139 --> 00:39:30.809
egocentric cognition and
behavior, and both mother and

00:39:30.809 --> 00:39:34.826
child are bearing costs from any
of the negative aspects of

00:39:34.826 --> 00:39:36.349
autistic spectrum.
 

00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:37.800
Okay?
 

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.369
If the mother's interests are
over-expressed,

00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:44.050
then during fetal development
you get a smaller birth weight;

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.269
you get a smaller brain,
less lateralized brain;

00:39:47.269 --> 00:39:48.590
slower growth.
 

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.425
The benefits to the mother is
that the child is easier to take

00:39:51.425 --> 00:39:51.889
care of.
 

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:55.596
There's a cost to the
offspring, it has schizophrenic

00:39:55.596 --> 00:39:56.380
behavior.
 

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.815
And there's also eventually a
cost to the mother,

00:39:58.815 --> 00:40:00.539
from the schizophrenic
behavior.

00:40:00.539 --> 00:40:05.755
So the people who have featured
here--this is just an autistic

00:40:05.755 --> 00:40:08.320
child sleeping on his hands.
 

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.030
That's Sylvia Plath,
the poet who committed suicide.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:17.054
And if we look at the
correlative evidence from

00:40:17.054 --> 00:40:21.429
idiopathic schizophrenia and
idiopathic autism--

00:40:21.429 --> 00:40:27.429
so I think you know who those
guys are--

00:40:27.429 --> 00:40:33.150
what you see is that associated
with schizophrenia of unknown

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.320
cause--
that's what idiopathic

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.880
means--is low birth weight;
slow growth;

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.739
small head/brain size;
better verbal;

00:40:40.739 --> 00:40:44.387
dyslexia;
some overlap in the genes with

00:40:44.387 --> 00:40:46.969
bipolar disorder;
major depression.

00:40:46.969 --> 00:40:50.382
And if you look at autism,
you see that they have higher

00:40:50.382 --> 00:40:53.932
average birth weight;
so not always higher,

00:40:53.932 --> 00:40:55.449
but not lower.
 

00:40:55.449 --> 00:40:57.369
They have faster body growth.
 

00:40:57.369 --> 00:40:59.900
They tend to have large heads.
 

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.739
They are called hyperlexic.
 

00:41:01.739 --> 00:41:04.820
They have better visual,
spatial and verbal skills,

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.210
and you can get an idiot savant
syndrome out of that.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.449
So there is correlative
evidence.

00:41:11.449 --> 00:41:13.943
This is not experimental,
but it is possible to go out

00:41:13.943 --> 00:41:16.768
there in the literature and to
pull together a lot of studies

00:41:16.768 --> 00:41:19.420
and say,
"Hey, it looks like there

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:23.295
are correlations with what you
might expect if this was an

00:41:23.295 --> 00:41:26.764
over-expression of maternal
interest and this was an

00:41:26.764 --> 00:41:30.097
over-expression of paternal
interest in the infant

00:41:30.097 --> 00:41:31.389
brain."
 

00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:36.443
Now if this connection between
evolutionary conflicts of

00:41:36.443 --> 00:41:42.050
interests and mental disease is
ever actually established,

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.340
it's going to be one of the
most remarkable connections that

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.010
I know of.
 

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.159
It was completely unexpected.
 

00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:51.300
Nobody ever thought that an
alternative explanation for

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.791
autism and schizophrenia would
ever come out of kin selection

00:41:54.791 --> 00:41:56.769
and parent-offspring conflict.
 

00:41:56.769 --> 00:41:58.659
Okay?
 

00:41:58.659 --> 00:42:05.606
Certainly that was completely
unsuspected in the '60s,

00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:08.489
'70s, '80s and '90s.
 

00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:12.898
So I'd now like to pause and
just remind you that everything

00:42:12.898 --> 00:42:16.934
that I've told you about a
potential connection between

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:21.043
evolutionary conflicts of
interest and mental disease is

00:42:21.043 --> 00:42:22.389
speculative.
 

00:42:22.389 --> 00:42:27.023
It is actually at the moment an
object of rather intense

00:42:27.023 --> 00:42:27.949
research.
 

00:42:27.949 --> 00:42:32.900
But the annals of research
journals are littered with the

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.849
corpses of beautiful ideas that
were killed by facts,

00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:41.469
and that could very well happen
to this one.

00:42:41.469 --> 00:42:44.639
We have to be patient and just
see what happens.

00:42:44.639 --> 00:42:48.452
But I hope that I've been able
to communicate to you that there

00:42:48.452 --> 00:42:51.219
is a role in science for bold
speculation,

00:42:51.219 --> 00:42:55.427
and that it actually makes the
whole process extremely

00:42:55.427 --> 00:42:56.539
interesting.
 

00:42:56.539 --> 00:43:00.588
Now I'd like to do something
that occurred to me after I had

00:43:00.588 --> 00:43:03.059
lunch with Bill Feldman
yesterday.

00:43:03.059 --> 00:43:05.902
Bill's taking this course
because he's a political

00:43:05.902 --> 00:43:09.266
scientist, and he's interested
in what evolution has to say

00:43:09.266 --> 00:43:10.369
about politics.
 

00:43:10.369 --> 00:43:13.478
So I want to give you some
take-home messages about

00:43:13.478 --> 00:43:16.960
conflict resolution that come
out of the study of genomic

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.768
conflict.
 

00:43:17.768 --> 00:43:22.193
If you want to get rid of a
conflict, make the interest of

00:43:22.193 --> 00:43:24.909
the competing elements
symmetric.

00:43:24.909 --> 00:43:27.472
You can do this in a host
pathogen relationship by

00:43:27.472 --> 00:43:30.400
shifting the transmission from
horizontal to vertical.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.280
That will reduce their
virulence.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.224
Because, if you think about it,
then the pathogen can only get

00:43:36.224 --> 00:43:39.329
into the next generation if its
host survives.

00:43:39.329 --> 00:43:41.186
If it's a vertically
transmitted parasite,

00:43:41.186 --> 00:43:43.679
that means it's transmitted
from parent to offspring.

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:46.135
So the parent has to survive,
to have a baby,

00:43:46.135 --> 00:43:48.090
so that the pathogen can make
it.

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:52.219
So it's not in the pathogen's
interests to kill the parent.

00:43:52.219 --> 00:43:55.581
A horizontally transmitted
pathogen, on the other hand,

00:43:55.581 --> 00:43:58.820
can have actually quite a high
level of virulence;

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.157
and that is where all the major
diseases are,

00:44:01.157 --> 00:44:03.760
they're all horizontally
transmitted pathogens.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.909
And if you think about things
like Wolbachia--

00:44:06.909 --> 00:44:09.920
remember, I was telling you
about this bacteria that

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.617
feminizes its hosts,
so that it would always be

00:44:12.617 --> 00:44:14.420
occurring in the body of a
female.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.603
Well there's some crustacea
that have figured out how to

00:44:17.603 --> 00:44:18.820
solve this problem.
 

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.045
They take the Wolbachia and
they chop out its sex

00:44:22.045 --> 00:44:24.740
determining gene,
and they implant the Wolbachia

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.039
sex determining gene on one of
their chromosomes,

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:29.286
et voilà,
there is no conflict anymore

00:44:29.286 --> 00:44:32.300
because now the whole business
is vertically transmitted.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.440
So they just took the offending
element,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.690
that one offending element out
of the bacterium,

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.800
and they stuck it into their
nuclear genome,

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.440
and they created a new sex
chromosome for the crustacean.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.980
So they also got--they made the
interest symmetric.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.853
Both genetic elements then had
the same vertical transmission

00:44:52.853 --> 00:44:53.369
route.
 

00:44:53.369 --> 00:44:57.139
Another way that you can
resolve conflict is this.

00:44:57.139 --> 00:44:59.150
You can suppress the meiotic
drive.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:04.869
So you can punish the offenders.
 

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:09.942
And the evidence for that
basically--that there's been a

00:45:09.942 --> 00:45:14.829
history of suppression--is the
fairness of meiosis.

00:45:14.829 --> 00:45:18.918
You can also homogenize the
reproductive success of

00:45:18.918 --> 00:45:23.500
competing elements within a
group, at the human level.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.070
This can be done with monogamy.
 

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:28.135
Anything that will make
individual success depends on

00:45:28.135 --> 00:45:29.079
group success.
 

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:32.413
So I'm going to give you a
couple of taglines to remember

00:45:32.413 --> 00:45:34.199
this, a couple of mnemonics.
 

00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:36.788
A rising tide lifts all
boats, and we're all in the same

00:45:36.788 --> 00:45:37.280
boat.
 

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.244
So if you're a gene,
you should think that anything

00:45:40.244 --> 00:45:43.625
that you can do to improve the
reproductive success of the

00:45:43.625 --> 00:45:47.735
organism that you're sitting in,
is probably the only way you'll

00:45:47.735 --> 00:45:49.893
improve your own,
and the fact that it's

00:45:49.893 --> 00:45:52.130
improving everybody else's
reproductive success,

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:54.900
in that same genome,
is actually irrelevant to you.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.775
You're not competing with them;
in fact, you're all

00:45:57.775 --> 00:46:01.090
cooperating, because if you're
all in the same boat,

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:04.246
and you're all pulling
together, that's the only way to

00:46:04.246 --> 00:46:06.059
get into the next generation.
 

00:46:06.059 --> 00:46:08.425
And, of course,
there is this anecdote--this

00:46:08.425 --> 00:46:12.000
isn't--we don't actually know if
this is a direct quote or not.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.210
But it is said that as the
Declaration of Independence was

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:19.829
signed on July 4^(th) in
Philadelphia in 1776,

00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:22.597
Benjamin Franklin turned to the
people who were signing it and

00:46:22.597 --> 00:46:23.706
said,
"Gentleman,

00:46:23.706 --> 00:46:26.184
we must indeed all hang
together or assuredly we shall

00:46:26.184 --> 00:46:27.539
all hang separately."
 

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:29.650
So these are just mnemonics.
 

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:35.346
These are ways of remembering
the principle that the way to

00:46:35.346 --> 00:46:41.630
suppress conflict is to generate
a situation in which everyone is

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:45.559
dependent upon partners for
success.

00:46:45.559 --> 00:46:50.360
So the take-home for the
lecture basically is this.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.771
You should think of organisms
as a hierarchy of replication

00:46:53.771 --> 00:46:56.329
levels,
and natural selection can occur

00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:59.699
simultaneously at all of the
levels in the organism.

00:46:59.699 --> 00:47:05.599
This is especially important
with cytoplasmic organelles and

00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:07.699
with meiotic drive.
 

00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:11.500
Replicating units that only
occur in a few copies,

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.594
and whose replication and
segregation are strictly

00:47:14.594 --> 00:47:16.972
controlled--
things like cell nuclei and

00:47:16.972 --> 00:47:20.552
chromosomal genes--
do not easily cause genomic

00:47:20.552 --> 00:47:21.469
conflict.
 

00:47:21.469 --> 00:47:24.780
But if those units occur in
many copies,

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.728
and if their replication and
segregation is not strictly

00:47:27.728 --> 00:47:29.675
controlled--
those are things like

00:47:29.675 --> 00:47:36.547
cytoplasmic genetic elements--
they more easily cause genomic

00:47:36.547 --> 00:47:38.250
conflict.
 

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:43.905
Conflict is much more easily
evolved and experienced in

00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:48.619
sexual organisms than in asexual
organisms.

00:47:48.619 --> 00:47:50.869
Okay.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.811
Prof: But now I will
actually talk about the

00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:05.180
Declaration of Independence.
 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.624
Obviously, at the core of
today's lecture we have a piece

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:12.890
of paper.
 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.486
Of course, it's an iconic piece
of paper to us,

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:19.770
but it's a piece of paper just
the same.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.639
And part of what we're going to
be looking at today in this

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:27.776
lecture is that obviously this
Declaration was more than just a

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:31.780
piece of paper produced by a
bunch of guys in one room--

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.765
that actually,
declaring independence was an

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:36.695
event,
and it was an event that

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:39.580
reached far beyond the Second
Continental Congress,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.047
and actually was hashed out in
towns and cities throughout the

00:00:43.047 --> 00:00:46.030
colonies,
and I'll be talking some about

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.950
that today.
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.258
So as you'll see today,
and it'll be logically

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:52.490
following through other things
that I've said in the course,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.780
what we're talking about here
is a wrenching progress,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.980
a major decision that was an
act of treason,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.471
an action that the colonists
knew would set them on a

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.938
dangerous path.
 

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:09.280
Now given lots of the stuff
I've said so far in this course,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.724
hopefully you're
expecting--you're understanding

00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:15.730
why this would be a wrenching
process,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.269
why it would seem radical or as
radical as it did.

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:22.626
It represented a break from the
mother country that American

00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:25.700
colonists obviously had long
embraced as their own,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.132
as well as a dangerous act that
set a collection of colonies in

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.849
warfare against the most
powerful nation on earth.

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:36.010
So, big step.
 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.601
So it's an important act,
but we need to be careful in

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:43.938
assuming that the piece of paper
that explained its rationale had

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:47.811
some kind of magical,
iconic value at the time that

00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:51.099
it was created,
because it didn't.

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:54.690
And as you'll see,
it was not seen as the main

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.680
focus of the process of
declaring independence,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.058
and in a way it was almost seen
as a formality to the actual act

00:02:02.058 --> 00:02:03.560
of declaring independence.
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.510
And it wasn't intended to say
something dramatically new.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.295
It's come to mean a lot of
things over the centuries,

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:12.974
but at the time it was not
supposed to be something

00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:13.938
radically new.
 

00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:17.633
As Jefferson put it--And all of
these founder types,

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:21.907
those who live who into old
age, are asked eternally through

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.658
their old age to:
'tell us about.'

00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:24.938
Right?
 

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:27.359
Jefferson got all these
tell-us-about-the-Declaration

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.430
letters from people.
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.038
Adams got the same kind of
letters.

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:32.830
I'm going to be quoting later
on from one or two of their

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.771
explanations of what happened
surrounding the Declaration of

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:36.620
Independence.
 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.742
But in one of these letters
when someone asked Jefferson,

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:43.370
'So how did you decide what was
going to be in the Declaration?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.852
Where did the ideas come
from?'--and Jefferson said that

00:02:45.852 --> 00:02:48.964
the Declaration was,
quote, "neither aiming at

00:02:48.964 --> 00:02:51.729
originality of principle or
sentiment,

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:55.470
nor yet copied from any
particular and previous writing.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.335
It was intended to be an
expression of the American

00:02:58.335 --> 00:02:59.080
mind."
 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.345
Okay.
 

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.423
That was what it was--not only
Jefferson intended it to be,

00:03:02.423 --> 00:03:05.235
but what he understood the
document was supposed to be

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:05.818
doing.
 

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.251
So as we'll see in today's
lecture, the Declaration isn't

00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.682
filled with original thoughts
beaming out of the brain of

00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:13.968
Thomas Jefferson.
 

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:19.038
Rather, it reflected American
assumptions about government and

00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:21.780
the rights of the body politic.
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.277
So in essence,
it transcribed a mass of ideas

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:29.889
that had been brought into the
open and defined by what the

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.343
colonists took to be British
transgressions against their

00:03:34.343 --> 00:03:38.318
rights as colonists and as
British subjects.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:43.120
Now as I suggested in last
Thursday's lecture,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.161
the Declaration of Independence
came roughly six months after

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:50.530
the publication of Common
Sense in 1776,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.786
but it was by no means the only
or even the most important thing

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:57.758
that the Congress had to do at
that time,

00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:01.377
sort of not what we would
expect given that it's this

00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:02.628
iconic document.
 

00:04:02.628 --> 00:04:05.282
And I'll be talking more about
the other things that Congress

00:04:05.282 --> 00:04:08.592
had to do in Thursday's lecture,
but for now I'll say that by

00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:11.550
the time the Second Continental
Congress met,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.745
and it first met in May of
1775, shots had already been

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:18.310
fired at Lexington and Concord.
 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.589
So, as Thomas Paine put it,
and I quoted him last week,

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:25.622
the colonies had been set on
fire, and the Congress now faced

00:04:25.622 --> 00:04:29.119
the monumental task of
organizing some kind of either

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:32.694
defensive effort or war effort,
but whatever it was,

00:04:32.694 --> 00:04:34.139
they had to organize it.
 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.519
That was going to be a big
problem.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.899
It was going to be a huge
challenge.

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:41.108
That's happening at the same
time that everything that I'm

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:43.079
talking about today is
happening.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:45.370
So even as we're debating
independence,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.339
the Congress also has to deal
with a whole range of other

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:53.452
issues that really are immediate
and pressing and are about

00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:55.649
basically organizing a war.
 

00:04:55.649 --> 00:05:00.447
So not surprisingly,
given that British soldiers had

00:05:00.447 --> 00:05:06.000
killed some colonists in
Massachusetts in April of 1775,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.720
when the Second Continental
Congress came into session in

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.639
May there was already a strong
feeling of colonial unity and

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.360
what at the time they called
rage militaire,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.240
right?--this sort of fervent
support of the colonial cause.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.428
And you can see the mood of the
colonists generally in the

00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:27.730
treatment that they gave the
congressional delegates as they

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.528
traveled down to Philadelphia
for the meeting.

00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:33.858
So as Samuel Adams and John
Hancock traveled down from

00:05:33.858 --> 00:05:37.625
Massachusetts and they met up
with delegates from Connecticut

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:41.478
and New York as they went south,
all along their way local

00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:44.901
militia units came out to
accompany them and seemingly to

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:46.920
protect them from the British.
 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.053
It's not like actually the
British were going to jump out

00:05:49.053 --> 00:05:51.456
from Connecticut and shoot down
the delegates to the Continental

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:54.759
Congress,
but still the impulse was there.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.877
These militia came out to guard
the delegates heading down to

00:05:57.877 --> 00:05:58.449
Congress.
 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.345
And all along the route people
came out to watch these

00:06:01.345 --> 00:06:04.512
delegates as they passed by and
greeted them with shouts of

00:06:04.512 --> 00:06:05.769
"huzzah."
 

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:07.230
Okay, huzzah.
 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.495
Huzzah is the
eighteenth-century equivalent of

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:13.107
hooray--huzzah,
which is very somehow

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:15.430
eighteenth-century sounding.
 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.091
I don't know.
 

00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:18.889
Hooray with a Z in it just
doesn't sound very modern,

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.959
and I have to--what pops into
my head is,

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:26.879
a million years ago actually I
had a huzzah moment,

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.622
I had a personal huzzah moment,
in which I was invited to some

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:34.490
big black-tie celebration of a
founder who shall go nameless.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.740
And at the founder sort of
celebration,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.740
all--we're all in our long
dresses and tuxedos,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.634
a black-tie event--the
organizer actually got us all to

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:49.170
stand and yelled three huzzahs
for the founder.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.629
So there's a group of all these
very formal people going

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:52.569
"Huzzah."
 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.185
[laughs]
So even now it feels ridiculous

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:57.555
to me,
but even at the time,

00:06:57.555 --> 00:07:00.442
I thought--yeah,
you just--you haven't lived as

00:07:00.442 --> 00:07:03.232
an eighteenth-century historian
until you've had the chance to

00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:05.701
scream "huzzah"
in honor of a Founding Father

00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:07.120
so I had my huzzah moment.
 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.639
There is my huzzah moment.
 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.889
There's an explanation of
huzzah.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.874
We have a lot of huzzahing
going for the delegations as

00:07:13.874 --> 00:07:16.028
they're heading down to
Philadelphia.

00:07:16.028 --> 00:07:21.619
So in all of that huzzahing you
can see that the colonial cause

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:27.208
is not an isolated effort being
managed by a few dozen men in a

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:28.019
room.
 

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:31.920
To all of these people at the
time,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.853
just after Lexington and
Concord, the mere existence of

00:07:35.853 --> 00:07:38.920
the Congress,
which was a body formed by all

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.761
of the colonies together,
was proof of colonial unity,

00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:47.024
so it had great significance
even just on that most basic

00:07:47.024 --> 00:07:47.709
level.
 

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:50.622
And actually,
although people didn't know it

00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:53.740
at the time,
the Continental Congress would

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.220
end up being the sole government
for the colonies until 1781 when

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.139
the Articles of Confederation
end up being ratified,

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:06.149
and obviously I'll talk more
about that in a lecture to come.

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:10.821
Now in Thursday's lecture on
Common Sense I mentioned

00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:15.254
some of the efforts of the
Second Continental Congress to

00:08:15.254 --> 00:08:18.660
reach reconciliation with
Britain and,

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.398
as I've already said,
the delegates did not arrive in

00:08:21.398 --> 00:08:24.663
Philadelphia assuming that they
were supposed to be working for

00:08:24.663 --> 00:08:25.560
independence.
 

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.180
They were working at
reconciliation.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.759
Now of course,
as I've just explained,

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.650
they were also worrying about
organizing armed forces for

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.681
defensive purposes and they were
pursuing these two sort of

00:08:37.681 --> 00:08:40.529
conflicting motives at the same
time.

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:42.958
So they are thinking about
reconciliation and worrying

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.388
about defense as--well,
as--In case that doesn't work,

00:08:45.388 --> 00:08:47.129
we really better worry about
that.

00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:49.649
So we can't take independence
for granted.

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:55.048
We also shouldn't take colonial
unity for granted because yes,

00:08:55.048 --> 00:08:56.918
there is this rage
militaire,

00:08:56.918 --> 00:09:00.110
people are united because of
Lexington and Concord,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.014
but if you look up close at the
Continental Congress you can see

00:09:04.014 --> 00:09:07.860
some of the ways in which it
really wasn't one united body,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.970
but it really did represent
independent bodies,

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.259
independent colonies joining
together for the moment.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:18.851
So one example:
There was actually no single

00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:23.863
method set to determine how many
delegates should attend from

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:25.200
each colony.
 

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.193
So basically each colony
decided on its own how many

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:32.009
people it felt like sending to
the Second Continental Congress.

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:35.195
So Virginia sent seven men and
they seemed to have some kind of

00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:38.176
rotation system so that guys
always seemed to be coming and

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:38.690
going.
 

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.950
Well, we've got these guys
there.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.168
Let's take them home and bring
these new guys there.

00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:44.321
No one else really knew the
system of what was happening in

00:09:44.321 --> 00:09:45.990
Virginia, but they always had
people there.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.990
They just changed a lot.
 

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.402
New York ultimately appointed
twelve men but they didn't come

00:09:52.402 --> 00:09:55.282
really reliably,
and so ultimately New York

00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:58.702
decided that you only needed to
have three of them present to

00:09:58.702 --> 00:09:59.158
vote.
 

00:09:59.158 --> 00:09:59.442
Okay.
 

00:09:59.442 --> 00:10:01.761
So first of all,
obviously attendance is a

00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:04.307
little quirky,
but beyond that every colony is

00:10:04.307 --> 00:10:07.590
deciding on its own how many
people it wants to send.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.332
So you can really see how the
Continental Congress is a body

00:10:12.332 --> 00:10:17.480
encapsulating delegations from
separate and distinct colonies.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.440
And before anything really
major could be done,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.889
delegations either needed to
confer on their own or,

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.143
more often, I suppose,
confer with people back home in

00:10:27.143 --> 00:10:30.889
their colony to determine what
it was that their colony wanted

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:31.808
them to do.
 

00:10:31.808 --> 00:10:35.565
And obviously the different
ideas and biases and interests

00:10:35.565 --> 00:10:39.320
in the various colonies were
different enough to make some

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.558
decisions extremely difficult.
 

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:46.144
So you've got a pretty
distinctive kind of legislative

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:46.750
body.
 

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.110
And, as I mentioned on
Thursday, one of the notable

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.739
things that this congress
produced was the Olive Branch

00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:57.011
Petition,
which was this one final stab

00:10:57.011 --> 00:10:58.538
at reconciliation.
 

00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:04.630
The Olive Branch Petition was
approved on July 5,1775,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.538
in the hope of ending
bloodshed.

00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:11.750
The Petition walked a delicate
line,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.854
declaring loyalty to the
King--not talking about rights

00:11:15.854 --> 00:11:19.481
or making demands--
and asking for the King's

00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:23.710
assistance in reaching some kind
of reconciliation.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.995
So it's appealing to the
loyal--There's people saying

00:11:25.995 --> 00:11:29.322
they're loyal to the King,
they're not raging about rights

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:31.535
and demands,
but they are asking for

00:11:31.535 --> 00:11:34.500
assistance in helping somehow to
smooth things over.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.335
Unfortunately,
the petition reached the King

00:11:37.335 --> 00:11:40.302
at the same time as news of
Bunker Hill, okay,

00:11:40.302 --> 00:11:43.269
one of those unfortunate
strikes of fate.

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:46.432
So not surprisingly,
the Petition did not have a

00:11:46.432 --> 00:11:49.529
wonderfully convincing impact on
the Crown,

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:54.080
and in August of 1775 the King
declared the colonies to be in

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.990
rebellion.
 

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.625
And basically he ignored--as I
mentioned also in the last

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:01.259
lecture--
he ignored the Olive Branch

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:05.222
Petition and by doing so,
basically played into the hands

00:12:05.222 --> 00:12:08.782
of more radical colonists by
making reconciliation seem

00:12:08.782 --> 00:12:12.208
pretty unlikely and really
almost demanding some more

00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:14.778
dramatic action from the
colonies.

00:12:14.778 --> 00:12:18.854
So August of 1775,
George III declares the

00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:21.240
colonies in rebellion.
 

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.892
He also did two other things at
roughly that time,

00:12:23.892 --> 00:12:27.302
neither one of which helped the
situation or certainly helped to

00:12:27.302 --> 00:12:28.710
smooth it over at all.
 

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.076
So number one,
two months later in October of

00:12:33.076 --> 00:12:36.506
1775,
he stated in Parliament that

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:41.009
the American rebellion was,
quote, "carried on for the

00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:43.921
purpose of establishing an
independent empire,"

00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:47.649
and this is October 1775;
you're not in 1776 yet.

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:52.235
The King explained that
"the authors and promoters

00:12:52.235 --> 00:12:55.038
of this desperate conspiracy...
 

00:12:55.038 --> 00:12:57.395
meant only to amuse,
by vague expressions of

00:12:57.395 --> 00:13:01.498
attachment to the parent state,
and the strongest protestations

00:13:01.498 --> 00:13:04.530
of loyalty to me,
whilst they are preparing for a

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.710
general revolt."
 

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.855
Okay.
 

00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:07.105
First of all,
it sounds like he actually saw

00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:07.600
that Petition.
 

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.058
Right? Yeah, yeah.
 

00:13:09.058 --> 00:13:12.192
They're claiming we're so loyal
to you and then at the same time

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:14.283
there is a "desperate
conspiracy"

00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:14.879
lurking.
 

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:18.009
So the King is arguing that
actually,

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:21.528
already they're planning
revolt, and he says you could

00:13:21.528 --> 00:13:25.048
see this because the colonists
are raising troops,

00:13:25.048 --> 00:13:26.250
because they'd seized the
public revenue,

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.418
because they were trying to
seize governmental powers.

00:13:29.418 --> 00:13:33.101
Not all members of Parliament
agreed with this sort of

00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:36.158
conspiracy theory on the part of
the King.

00:13:36.158 --> 00:13:40.095
Those who supported the
American cause argued that the

00:13:40.095 --> 00:13:44.700
American colonies had not yet
declared themselves in revolt.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.298
They had not said that they
were rebelling;

00:13:47.298 --> 00:13:50.899
they had not said that they
wanted independence yet;

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:55.498
and by speaking as he was,
the King could very well push

00:13:55.498 --> 00:14:00.014
the colonies into more radical
action than they had yet

00:14:00.014 --> 00:14:01.769
declared in 1775.
 

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:05.868
But the majority of Members of
Parliament at the time supported

00:14:05.868 --> 00:14:08.908
the King's statement,
supported his actions.

00:14:08.908 --> 00:14:12.019
So first he declares the
colonies in rebellion,

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:14.788
second he makes this bold
statement in Parliament,

00:14:14.788 --> 00:14:19.796
and then finally third,
in December of 1775 he proposed

00:14:19.796 --> 00:14:23.690
and Parliament passed a
Prohibitory Act.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.572
And the Prohibitory Act
prohibited commerce with the

00:14:27.572 --> 00:14:30.999
colonies, period,
and said that colonial ships

00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:34.350
were no longer under British
protection.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.212
So basically,
colonial American ships are

00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:39.288
fair game on the open seas.
 

00:14:39.288 --> 00:14:39.758
Okay.
 

00:14:39.758 --> 00:14:43.970
That's--Clearly,
there is another bold sort of

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.058
slap on the part of the Crown.
 

00:14:47.058 --> 00:14:50.551
When news of these actions
arrived in the colonies in

00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:54.631
January and February of 1776,
many colonists were pushed

00:14:54.631 --> 00:14:58.423
towards really serious
consideration of independence

00:14:58.423 --> 00:15:00.058
for the first time.
 

00:15:00.058 --> 00:15:02.231
They're at least considering
it, aided of course,

00:15:02.231 --> 00:15:04.360
as I explained last week,
by Common Sense.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.105
The Prohibitory Act was
particularly upsetting to many

00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:12.178
because it made it lawful to
attack and raid American ships.

00:15:12.178 --> 00:15:17.490
As John Hancock put it in a
pretty obvious statement,

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.022
"The making all our
Vessels lawful Prize don't look

00:15:21.022 --> 00:15:22.950
like a reconciliation."
 

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.320
[laughs]
Thank you, John Hancock.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.408
[laughs] And you're right.
 

00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:29.611
John Adams went further,
stating that the Prohibitory

00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:32.158
Act should be called,
quote, "the act of

00:15:32.158 --> 00:15:34.202
independency,"
because it "makes us

00:15:34.202 --> 00:15:36.246
independent in spite of our
supplications and

00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:37.269
entreaties."
 

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:42.288
Despite that kind of statement,
it is important to remember,

00:15:42.288 --> 00:15:45.384
regardless of how logical even
at this moment independence

00:15:45.384 --> 00:15:47.798
seems to us,
we still need to go through a

00:15:47.798 --> 00:15:48.570
process here.
 

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.128
We're still--It's still not an
obvious choice,

00:15:51.128 --> 00:15:54.197
and there were lots of
questions hovering with the mere

00:15:54.197 --> 00:15:55.788
thought of independence.
 

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:59.529
What kind of a future does
declaring independence hold?

00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:02.855
Many well realized that that
kind of a declaration would

00:16:02.855 --> 00:16:06.120
bring with it a devastating war
with Great Britain,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.750
death and destruction of
various kinds,

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.289
and then quite possibly,
even probably,

00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:12.639
defeat.
 

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:17.080
And on top of these pretty
logical fears,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.702
even as independence seemed--at
least it's part of debate if not

00:16:20.702 --> 00:16:22.830
absolutely looming on the
horizon--

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.750
most colonists still assumed
they're fighting for British

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.808
rights despite the fact that
clearly their understanding of

00:16:30.808 --> 00:16:34.940
the British constitution and
colonial rights is differing by

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.158
this point from the
understanding of those same

00:16:38.158 --> 00:16:39.980
things in England.
 

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.596
Most colonists still had so
deep a connection with the

00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:47.624
mother country that independence
almost felt like a physical

00:16:47.624 --> 00:16:48.580
condition.
 

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.246
And John Dickinson,
who was a moderate at this

00:16:51.246 --> 00:16:53.577
period,
basically put that into words

00:16:53.577 --> 00:16:56.932
and said that by declaring
independence the colonies were

00:16:56.932 --> 00:17:00.688
being "torn from the body,
to which we are united by

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:02.437
religion,
liberty, laws,

00:17:02.437 --> 00:17:06.028
affections, relation,
language and commerce,"

00:17:06.028 --> 00:17:08.769
so it's almost a physical
ripping away.

00:17:08.769 --> 00:17:11.522
So this is the atmosphere in
which Common Sense comes

00:17:11.522 --> 00:17:13.631
out,
and by swaying large portions

00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:16.578
of the people towards
independence obviously that

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.730
pamphlet is extremely important.
 

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.174
One of the most important
things about it is that because

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:24.390
it swayed large groups of
people--

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.266
it wasn't just a highfalutin'
political pamphlet written for

00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:28.582
the elite,
but it really,

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:31.557
as I mentioned already,
was for the masses--that it

00:17:31.557 --> 00:17:35.464
enabled the Continental Congress
to consider independence and

00:17:35.464 --> 00:17:39.112
ultimately to move toward
independence as representatives

00:17:39.112 --> 00:17:40.740
of the popular will.
 

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.135
Right?
 

00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:44.046
So Common Sense is
swaying the people,

00:17:44.046 --> 00:17:48.078
and so the Continental Congress
now is basically acting on the

00:17:48.078 --> 00:17:49.269
popular will.
 

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:53.048
Some who favored independence
actually wanted to distribute

00:17:53.048 --> 00:17:56.240
Common Sense at the
Congress's expense,

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.681
since it was so useful in
arousing public sentiment to

00:17:59.681 --> 00:18:01.500
move towards independence.
 

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.371
Now I want to turn at this
point to something that often

00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:09.313
gets left behind or left out
when we talk about declaring

00:18:09.313 --> 00:18:11.844
independence,
but it's actually really

00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:15.005
crucial and in a way I think
it's really at the center of the

00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:15.480
story.
 

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.539
And what I want to talk about
is what people generally in the

00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:22.180
colonies thought about
independence,

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.468
because obviously it's not only
guys in the Continental Congress

00:18:26.468 --> 00:18:29.375
who are debating,
discussing and considering

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:30.210
independence.
 

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.314
And even there,
there was great recognition

00:18:33.314 --> 00:18:37.380
that they're acting on behalf of
the larger populace.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.172
Many colonial delegations felt
compelled to have direct orders

00:18:42.172 --> 00:18:46.884
from the people of their colony
before taking this kind of an

00:18:46.884 --> 00:18:48.298
enormous step.
 

00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:51.000
And there's a book by Pauline
Maier which is titled

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.538
American Scripture:
Making the Declaration of

00:18:53.538 --> 00:18:56.670
Independence and it makes
this point really well,

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.692
and this sort of larger point
that I'm going to make here is

00:18:59.692 --> 00:19:01.180
partly drawn from her book.
 

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.196
And she emphasizes that the
Continental Congress wasn't the

00:19:05.196 --> 00:19:08.730
sole focal point for discussion
of independence,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.057
and she explains in her book
that while she was studying what

00:19:12.057 --> 00:19:15.328
was going on in the colonies
during the months of April,

00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:20.357
May, June, and July of 1776 she
actually discovered over ninety

00:19:20.357 --> 00:19:23.440
other declarations of
independence,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.102
all of them written by local
communities or towns or at

00:19:27.102 --> 00:19:30.288
conventions representing
individual colonies.

00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:34.393
And as she states in her book,
these local declarations of

00:19:34.393 --> 00:19:38.496
independence get us as close as
we can to the voice of the

00:19:38.496 --> 00:19:41.880
colonial public on the eve of
independence.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.221
And actually just looking at
the process of creating these

00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:50.792
local declarations reveals a
vast amount of information about

00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:54.068
how the people at large were
mobilized;

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:58.851
how seriously many colonies
took the idea that the people at

00:19:58.851 --> 00:20:01.848
large had to request
independence,

00:20:01.848 --> 00:20:05.159
that the delegates in the
Continental Congress were

00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:09.195
representing them in just the
way I suppose that the colonists

00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:11.048
felt Parliament was not.
 

00:20:11.048 --> 00:20:14.473
So for example,
in Massachusetts the assembly

00:20:14.473 --> 00:20:18.443
asked individual towns
throughout the colony to have

00:20:18.443 --> 00:20:21.586
meetings to discuss--
and this is a quote from the

00:20:21.586 --> 00:20:23.980
document that the assembly sent
to all of these towns,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.720
"if the honorable
Continental Congress should

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.816
decide that,
for the safety of the United

00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:30.693
Colonies,
it was necessary to declare

00:20:30.693 --> 00:20:32.538
them independent of Great
Britain,

00:20:32.538 --> 00:20:36.057
would they 'solemnly engage
with their Lives and Fortunes to

00:20:36.057 --> 00:20:38.680
Support the Congress in the
Measure?"

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:38.989
Okay.
 

00:20:38.989 --> 00:20:42.084
So the assembly is sending this
and saying, 'Towns,

00:20:42.084 --> 00:20:44.558
you need to consider this
resolution.

00:20:44.558 --> 00:20:46.983
If the Continental Congress
decides that it makes sense to

00:20:46.983 --> 00:20:49.153
declare independence,
will you actually support that

00:20:49.153 --> 00:20:50.769
with your lives and your
fortunes?

00:20:50.769 --> 00:20:53.230
Is that something you're in
favor of?'

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.463
Obviously, it's being treated
like, really in a sense,

00:20:56.463 --> 00:20:59.700
a personal decision,
a highly significant decision.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.310
Colonists are asked--are being
asked by this statement to join

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:08.241
in groups and discuss
independence and decide what it

00:21:08.241 --> 00:21:11.038
is they think should happen
next.

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:13.309
And clearly,
that kind of statement also

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:16.568
reveals that they're aware of
the seriousness and they're

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.211
aware--
I mean, ultimately,

00:21:18.211 --> 00:21:21.009
this is an act of treason
that's being debated here.

00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:24.450
Now the Massachusetts assembly
thought that--

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.218
they're asking towns to
vote--that this might not be

00:21:27.218 --> 00:21:29.390
necessarily a really lengthy
process,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.017
since already there's a lot of
circulating talk about maybe

00:21:32.017 --> 00:21:35.007
what should come next,
but actually it wasn't until

00:21:35.007 --> 00:21:38.788
July that all of the towns
reported themselves in favor of

00:21:38.788 --> 00:21:39.848
independence.
 

00:21:39.848 --> 00:21:42.740
The process took that long,
it took months,

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.868
because people actually were
seriously debating the issue.

00:21:46.868 --> 00:21:51.029
As a man from one town
observed, independence was,

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:53.606
quote, "the greatest and
most important question that

00:21:53.606 --> 00:21:55.190
ever came before this
town."

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.625
Now of course by the time that
every town had reported what it

00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:03.700
thought in Massachusetts to the
Continental Congress,

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.002
the Congress had already
decided in favor of

00:22:06.002 --> 00:22:08.835
independence,
but the people were a part of

00:22:08.835 --> 00:22:10.880
this decision-making process.
 

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.923
And if the first towns from
Massachusetts had not supported

00:22:14.923 --> 00:22:17.519
independence,
the Massachusetts delegates

00:22:17.519 --> 00:22:20.700
might have had a hard time
promoting it in Philadelphia,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.838
so it mattered.
 

00:22:22.838 --> 00:22:25.366
In Maryland as well,
there was widespread

00:22:25.366 --> 00:22:29.286
participation in this decision
about whether independence ought

00:22:29.286 --> 00:22:31.980
to be declared,
and individual popular

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.557
declarations supporting
independence there were possibly

00:22:35.557 --> 00:22:38.548
even more important than in
Massachusetts,

00:22:38.548 --> 00:22:41.282
because the Maryland
congressional delegation was

00:22:41.282 --> 00:22:44.130
undecided in what it thought
about independence.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.035
And it wasn't until the
Maryland government received

00:22:47.035 --> 00:22:49.712
these declarations of
independence from towns in

00:22:49.712 --> 00:22:53.018
Maryland that they decided to
instruct the delegates in the

00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:55.240
Congress to support
independence.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.279
Some colonies like--At this
point I should just wait for the

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:01.220
response.
 

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.150
Which colony might have a
quirky response?

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.500
Right? Rhode Island.
 

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.568
Somewhere out there in the
filming land--

00:23:08.568 --> 00:23:11.477
They're filming this--There's
going to be a lot of Rhode

00:23:11.477 --> 00:23:14.226
Island people who are going to
be really mad [laughs]

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:17.240
at me for saying negative
things about Rhode Island,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.509
and yet here we have Rhode
Island again.

00:23:19.509 --> 00:23:22.578
Rhode Island did not have such
widespread participation.

00:23:22.578 --> 00:23:24.930
There was a logic to what went
on in Rhode Island.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.752
Apparently, in Rhode Island the
legislature did consider asking

00:23:28.752 --> 00:23:31.588
towns what they thought about
independence,

00:23:31.588 --> 00:23:34.288
but they did a little
investigation first and they

00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:37.757
discovered that it was possible
that a few towns in Rhode Island

00:23:37.757 --> 00:23:39.740
might vote against independence.
 

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:39.991
Okay.
 

00:23:39.991 --> 00:23:42.718
Rhode Island wisely thought:
if we ask people what they

00:23:42.718 --> 00:23:45.584
think and they say,
'We don't want independence,'

00:23:45.584 --> 00:23:49.362
this could be a bad thing,
and so they decided that wasn't

00:23:49.362 --> 00:23:53.434
necessarily the best plan;
it certainly wouldn't help the

00:23:53.434 --> 00:23:54.470
common cause.
 

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:59.288
Now when I discuss colonial
legislatures at this point,

00:23:59.288 --> 00:24:03.763
it's important to realize that
most of the royal colonial

00:24:03.763 --> 00:24:08.078
governments had pretty much
collapsed by this point.

00:24:08.078 --> 00:24:13.411
The Continental Congress in May
of 1776 thus instructed the

00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:16.720
colonies to form new
governments,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.858
and so roughly throughout this
period--

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:22.194
some of the colonies had
already started doing this

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:24.137
before May,
some of them waited until

00:24:24.137 --> 00:24:27.654
May--but throughout this period,
in a lot of the colonies there

00:24:27.654 --> 00:24:31.186
was some kind of a convention
debating what basically the new

00:24:31.186 --> 00:24:33.481
government,
and really in a way,

00:24:33.481 --> 00:24:37.296
the new constitution of these
colonies should be in the

00:24:37.296 --> 00:24:39.980
absence of having a royal
presence.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.571
So they're like little mini
colonial constitutional

00:24:42.571 --> 00:24:45.233
conventions,
and it was these conventions

00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:48.732
often that were receiving these
local declarations of

00:24:48.732 --> 00:24:49.808
independence.
 

00:24:49.808 --> 00:24:53.731
And to some people in the
colonies it was actually this

00:24:53.731 --> 00:24:58.163
resolution asking the colonies
to create their own governments

00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:02.450
that constituted the real
declaration of independence,

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.229
and you can even hear echoes of
the later official Declaration

00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:10.008
in the resolution itself asking
the colonies to make their own

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.000
governments.
 

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.718
It has a preamble,
a very radical preamble,

00:25:13.718 --> 00:25:17.601
that's certainly more radical
than anything that the Congress

00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:20.191
had said thus far:
"Whereas His Britannic

00:25:20.191 --> 00:25:22.106
Majesty,
in conjunction with the lords

00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:24.893
and commons of Great Britain,
has, by a late act of

00:25:24.893 --> 00:25:27.743
parliament, excluded the
inhabitants of these United

00:25:27.743 --> 00:25:30.259
Colonies from the protection of
his crown;

00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:33.700
And whereas no answer whatever,
to the humble petitions of the

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.632
colonies for redress of
grievances and reconciliation

00:25:36.632 --> 00:25:39.779
with Great Brittain has been,
or is likely to be given,

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:41.650
but the whole force of that
kingdom,

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.240
aided by foreign mercenaries,
is to be exerted for the

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.880
destruction of the good people
of these colonies ...

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.665
it is necessary,
that the exercise of every kind

00:25:49.665 --> 00:25:52.631
of authority under the said
crown should be totally

00:25:52.631 --> 00:25:54.545
suppressed,
and all the powers of

00:25:54.545 --> 00:25:57.009
government exerted,
under the authority of the

00:25:57.009 --> 00:26:00.700
people of the colonies for the
preservation of internal peace,

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.018
virtue and good order,
as well as for the defense of

00:26:03.018 --> 00:26:05.509
their lives,
liberties, and properties."

00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:08.190
So that's a radical statement.
 

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.200
To Adams--To John Adams as well
as many others,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.076
this pretty much constituted a
declaration of independence even

00:26:15.076 --> 00:26:18.328
though it didn't declare
independence officially,

00:26:18.328 --> 00:26:21.892
and it's significant that in
that preface Congress isn't

00:26:21.892 --> 00:26:25.500
attacking the King's ministers;
they're not attacking

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.338
Parliament.
 

00:26:26.338 --> 00:26:30.103
They're attacking the King
himself, which is almost as good

00:26:30.103 --> 00:26:32.440
as a formal declaration of
revolt.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.943
Meanwhile, in the colonies the
individual towns are debating

00:26:35.943 --> 00:26:38.440
what they want to do about
independence.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.886
They're expressing their
opinions in written statements

00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:45.588
that, as Pauline Maier points
out, were remarkably alike in

00:26:45.588 --> 00:26:46.930
tone and content.
 

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.433
A lot of them listed the same
grievances and had the same kind

00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:53.710
of sense of betrayal at how the
King had betrayed them.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.291
Most of them mentioned the
contempt with which the King had

00:26:57.291 --> 00:27:00.009
received their attempts at
reconciliation.

00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:04.423
They mentioned recent violence
and destruction of American

00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:06.670
property by British troops.
 

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.410
They of course mentioned the
Prohibitory Act,

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.960
which declared the colonists
out of British protection.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.161
They mentioned German
mercenaries hired by George III

00:27:16.161 --> 00:27:17.700
to fight the colonists.
 

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.270
And most of them had sort of a
personal tone that they adopted

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.788
towards the King,
blaming him personally for the

00:27:25.788 --> 00:27:29.488
present state of affairs and
expressing great sadness at

00:27:29.488 --> 00:27:33.457
their realization that their
monarch basically had fallen to

00:27:33.457 --> 00:27:36.348
this level and allowed this to
happen.

00:27:36.348 --> 00:27:40.298
Some petitions went even
further, suggesting the type of

00:27:40.298 --> 00:27:44.173
government that they prefer to
be there in place of the

00:27:44.173 --> 00:27:46.721
monarchy,
and in one way or another some

00:27:46.721 --> 00:27:49.652
of these declarations specified
they wanted to establish a

00:27:49.652 --> 00:27:51.759
republican government in the
colonies;

00:27:51.759 --> 00:27:55.240
they wanted governments
grounded on popular will and

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.880
actual representation.
 

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.797
So what we're seeing here is
average people in towns

00:28:00.797 --> 00:28:06.019
throughout the colonies immersed
in the current state of affairs,

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:09.026
committing themselves
personally to a course of

00:28:09.026 --> 00:28:11.180
action,
expressing their ideas about

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.794
what government should be,
and personally taking part in

00:28:14.794 --> 00:28:18.440
the political process in a
radical kind of a way.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.240
So obviously we're not talking
about a couple of dozen men in a

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.650
room in Philadelphia.
 

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:28.538
Now, news of these declarations
written in May,

00:28:28.538 --> 00:28:32.087
June and even as late as July
helped push the Continental

00:28:32.087 --> 00:28:35.940
Congress towards independence,
so let's move back to Congress.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.715
On June 7,1776,
Virginia took a major step

00:28:39.715 --> 00:28:45.425
forward by making a resolution
that it sent to its delegates in

00:28:45.425 --> 00:28:49.108
Philadelphia via Richard Henry
Lee--

00:28:49.108 --> 00:28:51.440
he was one of the
delegates--and the resolution

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.023
from Virginia said that the
delegates should promote

00:28:54.023 --> 00:28:56.000
independence because the
colonies,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.265
quote, "are, and of right,
ought to be,

00:28:58.265 --> 00:29:00.410
free and independent
States."

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.970
Bang. So there you have it.
 

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.788
But the response--Okay.
 

00:29:04.788 --> 00:29:06.471
There it is,
we should be independent,

00:29:06.471 --> 00:29:08.696
the resolution that's going to
push them to debate

00:29:08.696 --> 00:29:09.470
independence.
 

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.801
The response to that resolution
is a reminder that there were a

00:29:12.801 --> 00:29:15.920
lot of other things that were
more pressing at the time.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.342
So Richard Henry Lee presents
this to Congress and Congress

00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:22.900
says,
'We got to put it off until

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.670
tomorrow because we actually
have more important things that

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.722
we need to debate today first,
so we'll talk about

00:29:26.722 --> 00:29:28.029
independence tomorrow.'
 

00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:29.380
Thank you, Richard Henry Lee.
 

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.058
On to these other matters.
 

00:29:31.058 --> 00:29:35.141
So the next day,
June 8, debate on independence

00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:38.199
got under way,
and those who were less

00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:41.866
enthusiastic about independence,
men like John Dickinson,

00:29:41.866 --> 00:29:43.818
who is moderate in his
politics,

00:29:43.818 --> 00:29:46.410
or James Wilson,
also of Pennsylvania,

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:50.258
Edward Rutledge of South
Carolina, they said that they

00:29:50.258 --> 00:29:54.759
were friends to the idea but
that the time wasn't yet right.

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:58.586
Some colonial delegations
weren't yet ready to declare

00:29:58.586 --> 00:29:59.670
independence.
 

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.358
They didn't have permission to
declare it from their home

00:30:02.358 --> 00:30:05.066
governments,
and forcing the issue might

00:30:05.066 --> 00:30:08.963
force these colonies to secede
from what was already a

00:30:08.963 --> 00:30:12.788
relatively weak colonial union
or so they argued.

00:30:12.788 --> 00:30:15.200
So--and disunion--if that were
to happen,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.287
if they were to push
independence and a colony should

00:30:18.287 --> 00:30:21.589
pull out,
disunion would be disastrous to

00:30:21.589 --> 00:30:25.102
their cause,
not only because it would hurt

00:30:25.102 --> 00:30:27.198
the cause,
but it would certainly not

00:30:27.198 --> 00:30:29.739
encourage foreign nations to
potentially help these little

00:30:29.739 --> 00:30:31.788
colonies in fighting against
Great Britain.

00:30:31.788 --> 00:30:34.318
So this is what
Rutledge--Edward Rutledge of

00:30:34.318 --> 00:30:36.318
South Carolina wrote on June 10.
 

00:30:36.318 --> 00:30:39.220
"The congress sat till 7
o'clock this evening in

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.287
consequence of a motion of
Richard Henry Lee's rendering

00:30:42.287 --> 00:30:44.630
ourselves free and independent
States.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.930
The sensible part of the House
opposed the Motion....

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.450
they saw no Wisdom in a
Declaration of independence,

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.808
nor any other Purpose to be
enforced by it,

00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:57.326
but placing ourselves in the
Power of those with whom we mean

00:30:57.326 --> 00:30:59.824
to treat,
giving our Enemy Notice of our

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:03.412
Intentions before we have taken
any steps to execute them and

00:31:03.412 --> 00:31:06.701
thereby enabling them to
counteract us in our Intentions

00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:09.571
and rendering ourselves
ridiculous in the Eyes of

00:31:09.571 --> 00:31:13.279
foreign powers by attempting to
bring them into a Union with us

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:16.390
before we had united with each
other."

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:16.607
Okay.
 

00:31:16.607 --> 00:31:18.532
There's a lot of strong
arguments Rutledge is

00:31:18.532 --> 00:31:20.789
presenting,
but of course on the other side

00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:22.986
of the spectrum,
those who supported

00:31:22.986 --> 00:31:26.651
independence argued that without
a formal declaration of

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:30.848
independence no nation would be
willing to aid the colonies;

00:31:30.848 --> 00:31:33.640
the colonies were basically
independent already;

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.991
the matter needs to be
discussed, needs to be pushed

00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:37.650
forward.
 

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:41.872
Lack of agreement and the
importance of the decision led

00:31:41.872 --> 00:31:46.172
Congress to postpone the
decision until the first week of

00:31:46.172 --> 00:31:50.701
July so that individual colonies
could decide on a course of

00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:51.700
action.
 

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.078
And in the meantime,
so no time would be lost,

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:58.183
they appointed a committee to
compose a written statement

00:31:58.183 --> 00:32:01.410
formally declaring colonial
independence,

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.288
and the committee included John
Adams,

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:05.318
Thomas Jefferson,
Benjamin Franklin,

00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:08.460
the greatest hits--Roger
Sherman of Connecticut,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.597
and Robert R. Livingston,
one of the many Livingstons of

00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:12.338
New York.
 

00:32:12.338 --> 00:32:16.165
And ultimately the committee
appointed Jefferson to draft the

00:32:16.165 --> 00:32:19.865
document and he worked during
the last two weeks of June in

00:32:19.865 --> 00:32:20.440
1776.
 

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.630
Now as I mentioned at the start
of the lecture,

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.412
in later years,
when Adams and Jefferson were

00:32:26.412 --> 00:32:30.951
retired presidential types,
lots of people wrote to them

00:32:30.951 --> 00:32:32.840
asking,
'So tell us what really

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.970
happened with the Declaration of
Independence.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:35.819
What was it like?
 

00:32:35.819 --> 00:32:37.180
Why did you do X?
 

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.588
Did you really do X?
 

00:32:38.588 --> 00:32:41.348
What was he like?'--sort of all
the things that you would want

00:32:41.348 --> 00:32:44.200
to ask if you could ask these
people, 'What really happened?'

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.507
And both men offered accounts
of the writing of the

00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:51.410
Declaration and their accounts
do not necessarily agree--

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.773
and they're also pretty in
character for each one of these

00:32:55.773 --> 00:32:57.766
men,
particularly John Adams'

00:32:57.766 --> 00:33:01.469
account of what happened with
the decision about who was going

00:33:01.469 --> 00:33:04.140
to write the Declaration of
Independence.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.125
And actually in 1822,
Adams wrote a pretty lengthy

00:33:07.125 --> 00:33:11.210
explanation of how Jefferson was
chosen to write the Declaration.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.407
I just want to offer you a
little piece of it,

00:33:13.407 --> 00:33:16.338
because it's actually a pretty
amazing little re-creation.

00:33:16.338 --> 00:33:19.067
So Adams writes in his letter,
"You inquire why so young

00:33:19.067 --> 00:33:21.387
a man as Mr. Jefferson was
placed at the head of the

00:33:21.387 --> 00:33:23.162
Committee for preparing a
Declaration of

00:33:23.162 --> 00:33:24.390
Independence."
 

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:24.588
Okay.
 

00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:25.990
So there is what the person
wrote.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:29.300
So Adams, why did you pick that
young new guy to write this

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:29.930
document?
 

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.368
Adams says, "I answer ...
 

00:33:32.368 --> 00:33:34.529
Mr. Jefferson came into
Congress,

00:33:34.529 --> 00:33:36.701
in June, 1775,
and brought with him a

00:33:36.701 --> 00:33:39.970
reputation for literature,
science, and a happy talent of

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:40.630
composition.
 

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.676
Writings of his were handed
about, remarkable for the

00:33:43.676 --> 00:33:45.670
peculiar felicity of expression.
 

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.598
Though a silent member in
Congress,

00:33:47.598 --> 00:33:49.246
he was so prompt,
frank, explicit,

00:33:49.246 --> 00:33:51.838
and decisive upon committees
and in conversation,

00:33:51.838 --> 00:33:55.862
not even Samuel Adams was more
so, that he soon seized upon my

00:33:55.862 --> 00:33:57.654
heart;
and upon this occasion I gave

00:33:57.654 --> 00:34:00.230
him my vote, and did all in my
power to procure the votes of

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.930
others."
 

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:01.230
Okay.
 

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.778
So in the end the committee's
voting who should write it,

00:34:04.778 --> 00:34:07.580
and Adams and Jefferson get the
most votes to write the

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.085
declaration,
so they're made,

00:34:09.085 --> 00:34:11.768
according to Adams,
like a little subcommittee of

00:34:11.768 --> 00:34:14.340
Adams and Jefferson,
and now this subcommittee

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.659
supposedly is going to draft the
Declaration.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:19.849
So Adams continues,
"The sub-committee met.

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:24.010
Jefferson proposed to me to
make the draught.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.460
I said 'I will not.'"
And what I'm going to be

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.550
reading from here now--
it's my favorite part of the

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.501
story--
he wrote a little script with

00:34:31.501 --> 00:34:33.940
what Jefferson says and what he
responds.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.340
He's no longer even himself in
the letter.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.255
He's just recording:
he said and then I said,

00:34:38.255 --> 00:34:39.780
and that he said and then I
said.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.306
So Jefferson says,
'Adams, you should write it,'

00:34:42.306 --> 00:34:44.510
and Adams says,
"I will not."

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.590
"You should do it,"
Jefferson insists.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.050
"Oh! no," says Adams.
 

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.190
"Why will you not?,"
asks Jefferson.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.340
"You ought to do it."
 

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.989
Its like he's writing a film.
 

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.394
[laughs]
He's already imagining:

00:34:56.394 --> 00:34:58.179
the movie of my life.
 

00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.413
[laughs]
If movies existed,

00:34:59.413 --> 00:35:01.500
I would be imagining the movie
of my life.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.650
"You ought to do it,"
says Jefferson.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:05.050
"I will not."
 

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.659
"Why?"
 

00:35:06.659 --> 00:35:08.690
"Reasons enough."
 

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.619
"What can be your
reasons?"

00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:11.860
Okay. This is Adams' response.
 

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.813
"Reason first--You are a
Virginian, and a Virginian ought

00:35:14.813 --> 00:35:16.800
to appear at the head of this
business.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.829
Reason second--I am obnoxious,
[laughs/laughter]

00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:23.659
suspected, and unpopular."
 

00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:26.610
Oh, [laughs] poor John Adams.
 

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:28.539
I am obnoxious,
suspected and unpopular.

00:35:28.539 --> 00:35:30.268
Don't make me write the
document.

00:35:30.268 --> 00:35:31.960
"You are very much
otherwise."

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.570
"Reason third--You can
write ten times better than I

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.130
can."
 

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.432
"Well,"
Adams has Jefferson respond,

00:35:37.432 --> 00:35:39.992
"if you are decided,
I will do it as well as I

00:35:39.992 --> 00:35:40.710
can."
 

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.054
Okay.
 

00:35:41.054 --> 00:35:44.909
That's part of a really
lengthy, great letter by Adams.

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:48.454
Jefferson's account is much
less humorous and actually

00:35:48.454 --> 00:35:51.318
briefer,
and he writes in 1823 to James

00:35:51.318 --> 00:35:54.126
Madison and he says,
"No such thing as a

00:35:54.126 --> 00:35:56.360
subcommittee was proposed"
[laughs]--

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.579
it's like--oops,
a basic disagreement--

00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:02.117
"but they unanimously
pressed on myself alone to

00:36:02.117 --> 00:36:04.159
undertake the draught."
 

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:07.516
Okay, a little disagreement
between the two guys which they

00:36:07.516 --> 00:36:09.079
never really agreed upon.
 

00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:11.722
And then he goes on to discuss
in this letter whether the ideas

00:36:11.722 --> 00:36:13.728
in the Declaration were new or
not, and he says,

00:36:13.728 --> 00:36:14.239
'No, no.
 

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:16.480
American minds,' blah blah blah.
 

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:16.766
Okay.
 

00:36:16.766 --> 00:36:19.969
Regardless of the precise
details as to whether there was

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:22.717
or wasn't a subcommittee,
Jefferson did draft the

00:36:22.717 --> 00:36:23.690
Declaration.
 

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.969
He submitted it to the others
for comment.

00:36:25.969 --> 00:36:28.980
They commented on it.
 

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.429
They sort of discussed it
amongst themselves.

00:36:31.429 --> 00:36:34.340
You'll get some chance in
section to actually talk about

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.563
some of the real specifics of
the document,

00:36:36.563 --> 00:36:38.469
the Declaration of
Independence.

00:36:38.469 --> 00:36:40.927
For the moment,
I'll just mention briefly what

00:36:40.927 --> 00:36:42.840
were some of Jefferson's
sources.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.023
Right?
 

00:36:43.023 --> 00:36:43.940
He's sitting in Philadelphia.
 

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.139
He has basically two
weeks--talk about a paper

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:48.730
deadline--to write the
Declaration of Independence.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.139
What is going to use?
 

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:53.003
He's pretty pressed for time,
so logically he turned to

00:36:53.003 --> 00:36:56.539
whatever he could for fodder,
and two notable sources were

00:36:56.539 --> 00:36:59.300
both Virginia documents
logically enough.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.559
He drafted a constitution for
Virginia,

00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:04.989
since the colony is in the
middle of doing that and along

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:07.574
with everything else,
and that ended up being a

00:37:07.574 --> 00:37:10.230
source for him of some of the
grievances,

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.300
the long list of grievances in
the Declaration.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.230
He pulled some of them from
that.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.690
And then the Virginia
Declaration of Rights,

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:20.389
which was also part of this
constitution-making process,

00:37:20.389 --> 00:37:24.460
helped contribute to the
preamble of the Declaration.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.336
Now of course,
Jefferson was careful not just

00:37:27.336 --> 00:37:30.110
to focus on Virginia words,
Virginia charges,

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.307
Virginia things,
because obviously the document

00:37:32.307 --> 00:37:34.599
is supposed to represent all of
the colonies.

00:37:34.599 --> 00:37:37.750
So for example,
when you read the Declaration,

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.864
you could see some of the
things he's citing happened in

00:37:39.864 --> 00:37:41.543
Massachusetts--
and some of them actually

00:37:41.543 --> 00:37:43.018
happened in other colonies as
well.

00:37:43.018 --> 00:37:47.208
It needs to be something that
is coming from some united

00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:49.800
expression of the colonial will.
 

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.425
One of the passages that
ultimately did not end up

00:37:54.425 --> 00:38:00.469
displaying colonial unity not
surprisingly concerned slavery--

00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:03.969
so in Jefferson's draft he
actually has a passage that

00:38:03.969 --> 00:38:06.264
charges the King--
that the King,

00:38:06.264 --> 00:38:10.650
quote, had "waged cruel
war against human nature itself,

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.197
violating it's most sacred
rights of life &amp;

00:38:13.197 --> 00:38:16.021
liberty in the persons of a
distant people who never

00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:17.994
offended him,
captivating &amp;

00:38:17.994 --> 00:38:20.920
carrying them into slavery in
another hemisphere,

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.608
or to incur miserable death in
their transportation

00:38:23.608 --> 00:38:24.469
thither."
 

00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:24.871
Okay.
 

00:38:24.871 --> 00:38:29.458
So that's a notable attempt to
blame the King for slavery,

00:38:29.458 --> 00:38:34.284
but the passage ultimately gets
stricken out by the Congress,

00:38:34.284 --> 00:38:36.940
in part for obvious reasons.
 

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.356
Right?
 

00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:40.139
The South is not going to
support this.

00:38:40.139 --> 00:38:43.367
But also, ultimately
Jefferson's declaration as far

00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:47.050
as slavery is concerned had some
tortured logic in it,

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.079
because it first attacks the
King for creating slavery,

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:51.880
for transporting slaves to
America,

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.217
and then attacks him for
offering them freedom if they

00:38:55.217 --> 00:38:56.730
fight for the British.
 

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:00.782
You inflicted slavery upon us
and you are threatening to free

00:39:00.782 --> 00:39:01.659
the slaves.
 

00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:02.028
Okay.
 

00:39:02.028 --> 00:39:04.539
Continental Congress said,
'Okay.

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:07.476
Not only is the South not
really able to grasp this at

00:39:07.476 --> 00:39:10.467
this particular moment,
but this doesn't entirely match

00:39:10.467 --> 00:39:11.518
up, Jefferson.'
 

00:39:11.518 --> 00:39:15.713
So in a sense his ambiguity and
ambivalence reflected general

00:39:15.713 --> 00:39:17.670
ambiguity and ambivalence.
 

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.864
But in the end,
the total effect of all of

00:39:20.864 --> 00:39:24.994
these charges was to suggest
that the King had sort of

00:39:24.994 --> 00:39:26.710
de-kinged himself.
 

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.483
He had displaced himself--that
he and not the colonies,

00:39:30.483 --> 00:39:33.630
had brought events to where
they now stood.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.983
Now, I think generally we and
also often scholars tend to

00:39:37.983 --> 00:39:41.949
really focus on the preamble of
the Declaration,

00:39:41.949 --> 00:39:45.315
but in fact at the time,
it was the specific charges

00:39:45.315 --> 00:39:49.010
against the King that were
considered to be the real meat

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.329
of the document.
 

00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:54.172
The preamble was actually just
supposed to be a preamble to the

00:39:54.172 --> 00:39:57.547
real charges against the King,
which were the radical part of

00:39:57.547 --> 00:39:58.699
the document at the time.
 

00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:02.304
And since this document was
intended possibly to be a

00:40:02.304 --> 00:40:05.909
declaration for foreign
audiences as well as domestic

00:40:05.909 --> 00:40:08.820
audiences,
it was important that that

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.574
preamble be a statement,
a broad, sweeping statement of

00:40:12.574 --> 00:40:16.260
epic proportions,
to inspire people to support

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.239
the cause.
 

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:21.784
The committee's draft
ultimately was presented to

00:40:21.784 --> 00:40:26.425
Congress on June 28,
and then debating and editing

00:40:26.425 --> 00:40:28.320
began on July 1.
 

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.989
Some of the changes had to do
with specific word choices--

00:40:31.989 --> 00:40:34.840
so for example was the King
really guilty of,

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.449
quote, "unremitting
injuries"?

00:40:37.449 --> 00:40:41.550
Congress preferred
"repeated injuries."

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.750
Okay.
 

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:43.757
That was the level of editing
taking place with the

00:40:43.757 --> 00:40:44.360
Declaration.
 

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.936
So they thought well,
"repeated"

00:40:45.936 --> 00:40:48.090
is a little less extreme than
"unremitting."

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.840
That word gets changed.
 

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.018
Not all of the changes were
intended to tame the document.

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:57.353
Sometimes Congress made some of
Jefferson's charges more

00:40:57.353 --> 00:40:59.335
extreme,
as when they added to

00:40:59.335 --> 00:41:02.905
Jefferson's statement about
foreign mercenaries words that

00:41:02.905 --> 00:41:05.117
described it--
the act of sending them to the

00:41:05.117 --> 00:41:07.153
colonies--
as, quote, "scarcely

00:41:07.153 --> 00:41:10.059
paralleled in the most barbarous
ages."

00:41:10.059 --> 00:41:14.626
And then as I mentioned before,
they struck the entire passage

00:41:14.626 --> 00:41:15.599
on slavery.
 

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:18.530
For the--For many southern
delegates pretty much it was a

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.833
deal breaker,
and it happens so often in this

00:41:20.833 --> 00:41:21.409
period.
 

00:41:21.409 --> 00:41:24.297
We'll certainly come up with it
again at the--towards the end of

00:41:24.297 --> 00:41:24.940
this course.
 

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.909
The issue of slavery comes up.
 

00:41:26.909 --> 00:41:28.550
It can't be dealt with.
 

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:30.280
People don't know how to deal
with it,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.255
particularly the Southerners,
and it keeps getting shunted to

00:41:33.255 --> 00:41:35.387
the side,
and so in a sense that's what

00:41:35.387 --> 00:41:36.130
happens here.
 

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.934
I'm going to stop at this
point, and I will start with a

00:41:39.934 --> 00:41:43.056
story that should be here,
but I can't tell it here and I

00:41:43.056 --> 00:41:45.699
want to do it justice,
about Jefferson's response to

00:41:45.699 --> 00:41:47.809
the editing of his precious
draft.

00:41:47.809 --> 00:41:49.878
He was not a happy camper at
the editing of the Declaration

00:41:49.878 --> 00:41:50.518
of Independence.
 

00:41:50.518 --> 00:41:54.476
And then I will move on to
really discussing organizing a

00:41:54.476 --> 00:41:54.900
war.
 

00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.000

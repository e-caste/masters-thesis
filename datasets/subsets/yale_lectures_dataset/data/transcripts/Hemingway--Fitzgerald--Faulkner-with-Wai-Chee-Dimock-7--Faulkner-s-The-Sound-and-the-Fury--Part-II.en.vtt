00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:12.400
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: So let me just
start with Faulkner.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.333
This is a really interesting
image of Faulkner in Japan.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:21.267
We know that Faulker so much
associated with Oxford,

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:22.967
Mississippi.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:28.733
But he actually traveled quite a
bit under the sponsorship of

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.633
the State Department.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:34.133
He was there because the State
Department asked him to travel

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.267
around and to give talks.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:41.967
And what's interesting about
Faulkner in Japan is that some

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:46.167
of the most interesting things
that he says about his own

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:53.233
novels were actually said when
he was in Japan, in the course

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:57.567
of the Nagona seminar, 1955.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:00.333
And this is really what
he says about The

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.900
Sound and the Fury.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.100
"This is how the book grew.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.700
That is, I wrote the same
story four times.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.867
None of them were right, but I
had anguished so much that I

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:20.600
could not throw any of it away
and start over, so I printed

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.633
it in the four sections."

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:25.033
I mean this is obviously
tongue in cheek.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:29.033
He's saying that he's written
so much in four different

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:34.400
ways, that he can't bear to
get rid of any of it.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.533
So he's keeping all four, and
it's the same story told four

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.033
times, tongue in cheek.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:44.167
But there's an element
of truth in it.

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:52.100
So let's try out, follow Faulker
in that thought.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.967
And think of The Sound and the
Fury, the four sections of The

00:01:55.967 --> 00:02:00.133
Sound and the Fury as
theme and variation.

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.533
So it's a very interesting,
musical

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.700
structure, theme and variation.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.333
Basically it's really the same
story, but told from four

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:13.000
different point of view using
four different narrative

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.600
techniques.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.000
And so producing different
effects, but really they are

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.600
all rooted in the same
phenomenon, which makes sense.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.067
I mean it's really
the same story.

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:24.133
Another way to think
about this --

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.867
and this is really kind of
adding on to a sense that this

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.033
is theme and variation --

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:31.567
is the notion of kinship.

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:34.700
And this is really closer to our
thematic understanding of

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.633
the novel, that the three
brothers, each gets to tell

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:45.267
his story in one section, and
then the full section is told

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:48.567
by an omniscient narrator.

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:51.067
But the first three sections
are told by the

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.167
three Compson brothers.

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:57.500
So there is kinship
among them.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.833
And we'll think about the
extent to which they are

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:07.933
brothers, they are kin, in both
a biological sense, but

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:13.667
perhaps also in more than
just a biological sense.

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:20.400
So let me just lay out the three
ways in which Benjy and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.633
Quentin might be seen as kin.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:30.433
And this is very much using the
three analytic registers

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.933
that we've been using
all the way through.

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:34.833
The three analytics scales --

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:38.000
the largest scale the shared
macro history.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.433
This is commonsensical.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:42.700
They live in the United States
after the Civil War.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.500
So that is the common
ground between them.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.233
And in fact, it doesn't
take brothers to

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:49.500
have that common ground.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.667
And especially thinking about
race relations, and the

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:58.567
tomorrow of race, thinking back
to that line from Macbeth

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:02.067
Act V, Scene Five.

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:07.200
So that's the largest ground
for kinship between them.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.300
And then there's another ground
for kinship, which has

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.200
to do, obviously, with
Faulkner's narrative

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.700
experimentation and the
traumatic loss of Caddy that

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.500
we saw last time.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.533
That's being repeated in
the Quentin section.

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:24.500
Likewise, the incomplete syntax
that is so striking in

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.433
Benjy will also be repeated
in Quentin.

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:32.433
And finally, the importance of
the sense of smell that is in

00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:35.033
Benjy will also be repeated
in Quentin.

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:39.100
We'll look at the kinship
first. And then

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.967
we'll look at variation.

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:43.967
Even though they're brothers,
they're different as well.

00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:45.800
So basically today's lecture is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.367
about kinship and variation.

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:49.967
But let's start with
the kinship.

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:54.067
And I want to talk a little bit
about race after the Civil

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:58.000
War, especially Faulkner's
understanding of that.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.133
So in his 1956 interview with
the London Sunday Times,

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:08.433
Faulkner has this very
interesting thing to say.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:13.600
"And the negro won't come out on
top, because of anything to

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.433
do with race, but because
he has always

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:20.467
gotten by without scope.

00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:24.267
When they're given scope,
they use it fully.

00:05:24.267 --> 00:05:27.967
They are trained to do more than
a white man can do with

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:33.400
the same limitations."

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.300
I have a little bit
of a cold, so.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.833
This will be fine.

00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:57.700
So this is the way that we like
to think about race, is

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.667
by going back to Macbeth,
Act V scene five.

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:08.667
And the first line actually of
Macbeth, Act V, Scene five,

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:13.300
is, "Tomorrow, and tomorrow,
and tomorrow." And thinking

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.233
that, mapping that onto
race relations.

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:21.100
We see that Benjy
is 33 years old.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.633
What kind of a future
does he have?

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:31.800
And what kind of future do the
other black characters have?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.567
So let's look at Benjy first.
And thinking about what

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:39.333
future, what tomorrow
holds for Benjy.

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:44.267
And this is very early on, the
opening of the Benjy section.

00:06:44.267 --> 00:06:46.967
"Listen at you now,
Luster said.

00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:48.933
Ain't you something.

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:52.033
33 years old, going
on that way.

00:06:52.033 --> 00:06:56.167
After I done went all the way to
town to buy you that cake.

00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.400
Hush up that moaning.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.100
Ain't you going to help me find
that quarter so I can go

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.600
to the show tonight?"

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.067
Benjy can't talk, obviously.

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:11.833
So Luster is the one who is
doing all the talking.

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:17.167
But I think that Faulkner seems
almost to be emphasizing

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:21.433
that Luster is the player
in the present.

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:25.600
And he's going to be the
player in the future.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.333
And everything that is being
done by Benjy, is being done

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:34.267
by Luster and Dilsey to some
extent, the two black

00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:35.000
characters.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.233
His mother isn't doing
anything for him.

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:39.967
Quentin is dead.

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:42.100
Caddy is gone.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.333
So Luster is Beny's
only significant

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.933
other at this point.

00:07:49.933 --> 00:07:57.000
And if for no other reason, the
future belongs Benjy, to

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.567
the extent that Benjy
could have a future.

00:08:00.567 --> 00:08:03.900
That future can come
only from Luster.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.233
So it's a really interesting way
to think about the future

00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:11.900
as being race mediated
and race dependent.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.233
Benjy is completely helpless.

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:17.367
Only Luster can give
him a future.

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:19.967
And Luster is doing that.

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:25.633
All the things that Caddy used
to do, Luster is doing.

00:08:25.633 --> 00:08:28.333
He's telling Benjy to hush.

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.700
He's gone all the way to town
to buy a birthday cake for

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.867
Benjy because Benjy
is 33 that day.

00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:39.667
And so in that sense,
he's a very good

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:43.467
significant other to Benjy.

00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:47.067
But more than that, we see that
Luster actually has a

00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:49.833
life apart from Benjy.

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:53.200
The last sentence of that
passage, "Ain't you going to

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.133
help me find that quarter so I
can go to the show tonight?"

00:08:58.133 --> 00:09:00.133
Luster wants to go to
the show completely

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:02.933
independent of Benjy.

00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:07.533
He has his own desires, he has
a life apart from Benjy.

00:09:07.533 --> 00:09:12.267
And Benjy is really just an
aside, an appendage, and this

00:09:12.267 --> 00:09:15.133
case, someone who should help
him to find that quarter, so

00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:18.133
he can pay for the show
and go to the show.

00:09:18.133 --> 00:09:23.267
So all this is to suggest that
the playing field has been

00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:27.900
reconfigurated, and who is at
the center, who is the main

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.167
player, who is the protagonist
in this drama that is

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:32.767
unfolding into the future?

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:34.100
That really is an
open question.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.533
And there's a strong suggestion
that the playing

00:09:36.533 --> 00:09:39.300
field has been so re-constituted
that black

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.733
characters would be
the protagonist.

00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:50.333
So let's think more about the
tomorrow of race, but going

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.333
off in a slightly different
direction.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:54.800
This is the very end,
towards the very end

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.833
of the Benjy section.

00:09:55.833 --> 00:09:59.133
So basically, we're looking at
the two moments that bracket

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:00.867
the Benjy section.

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:05.800
Once again, Benjy is with his
significant other, Luster.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.433
"He put my gown on.

00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:08.767
I hush.

00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:12.700
And then Luster stopped, his
head toward the window.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.833
Then he went to the window
and looked out.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.833
He came back and took my arm.

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.200
Here she come, he said.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.933
Be quiet now.

00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:24.533
We went to the window
and looked out.

00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:27.867
It came out of Quentin's
window and climbed

00:10:27.867 --> 00:10:29.767
across into the tree.

00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:31.667
We watched the tree shaking.

00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:35.733
The shaking went down the
tree, then it came out.

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:39.067
And we watched it go
across the grass.

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:41.133
Then we couldn't see it.

00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:42.400
Come on, Luster said.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.500
There now.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.700
Hear them horns.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.867
You get in that bed where
my foot [? stays ?]."

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:49.367
OK, it's completely
ungrammatical

00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:51.467
and that's just fine.

00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:54.267
The future can belong to
people who don't speak

00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:56.300
Standard English, it's
not a problem.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.633
But what is interesting here
is that we are seeing

00:10:59.633 --> 00:11:03.633
something that only one
person understands.

00:11:03.633 --> 00:11:07.100
We are actually in exactly the
same position as Benjy.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.500
We have no idea what's
going on.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.433
The meaning of what they are
watching, whatever it is

00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:16.967
that's coming out of Quentin's
window -- and this is the

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:22.033
female Quentin, the daughter
of Caddy --

00:11:22.033 --> 00:11:24.400
whatever is happening,
whatever's coming out of

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.000
Quentin's window, what's going
to come after that, what

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.133
occasions that movement out of
that window, all of this will

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:37.200
not be disclosed to us until
section three, when we get to

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.167
the Jason section.

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:43.533
So there's a really interesting
differential of

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:47.033
knowledge in this moment.

00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:51.333
Benjy obviously doesn't
know what's going on.

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:54.933
We, the readers, also don't
know what's going on.

00:11:54.933 --> 00:11:58.467
The only person who's fully in
command of the requisite

00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:00.933
knowledge is Luster.

00:12:00.933 --> 00:12:04.100
I think this is very
deliberately set up by

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.533
Faulkner to highlight the
extent to which black

00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:11.000
characters have knowledge
and agency.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.067
So much for Benjy, and obviously
Benjy is a part of

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:17.933
the black world.

00:12:17.933 --> 00:12:22.367
I think that maybe we should
even suspend --

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.133
I mean, Benjy looks white.

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:27.333
He is pasty, actually.

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:30.667
But we can think of him as
really part and parcel of the

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:31.300
black world.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.333
And his well-being is completely
dependent and, of a

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:37.300
piece with the well-being
of the black world.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.300
But that is not the
case with Quentin.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.933
Although Quentin also has very
important, nontrivial

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:49.000
relations to black characters.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.633
And one black character who's
following him is the Deacon.

00:12:54.633 --> 00:12:57.967
So this is a black man
in Massachusetts.

00:12:57.967 --> 00:13:01.033
And this is what the Deacon
says to Quentin.

00:13:01.033 --> 00:13:01.833
"Yes, suh.

00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:04.200
Right dis way, young marster,
hyer we is,'

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.900
taking your bags ...

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.967
From then on until he had you
completely subjugated he was

00:13:09.967 --> 00:13:14.633
always in and out of your
room, ubiquitous and

00:13:14.633 --> 00:13:20.167
garrulous, though his manner
gradually moved northward as

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:25.333
his raiment improved, until at
last, when he had bled you

00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:28.867
until you began to learn better
he was calling you

00:13:28.867 --> 00:13:31.533
Quentin or whatever..."

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:37.167
So this is a black man who is
definitely not the same as the

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:41.500
Lusters and the Dilseys who have
stayed on in Mississippi.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.100
This is a black man who
has moved north.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:49.567
And here's important to have
some sense of the historical

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:53.367
background that Faulkner
is alluding to.

00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:57.600
A black man going north, this
turns out to be one of the key

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.600
episodes in African-American
history, which

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.833
is the Great Migration.

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.200
In fact it happens
in several waves.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.667
What we've seen here is the
first wave of Great Migration.

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:16.733
Roughly from 1910 to 1930, two
million African-Americans went

00:14:16.733 --> 00:14:21.300
out of the south to the north,
to the midwest and the west.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.433
And here is one image of the
Great Migration, the train

00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:29.300
station almost completely
filled with blacks.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.067
And here's a wonderful
painting by the

00:14:33.067 --> 00:14:35.267
painter Jacob Lawrence.

00:14:35.267 --> 00:14:41.767
If you are in DC, make sure to
go to the Phillips Collection.

00:14:41.767 --> 00:14:43.500
It's a really interesting
collection.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.700
It's just a private collection
of great paintings.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.267
And they have the Jacob
Lawrence, The Great Migration

00:14:51.267 --> 00:14:55.967
series, is almost 40
or 50 drawings.

00:14:55.967 --> 00:15:00.700
So it's really a wonderful thing
that they have. And so

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.400
check this out when you're
in Washington, DC.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.733
So as you can see, the people
are going to Chicago and New

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:10.433
York and St. Louis.

00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:13.367
But some of them also end up
in Boston, Massachusetts.

00:15:13.367 --> 00:15:17.267
And the Deacon ended up in
Boston, Massachusetts.

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:24.200
And once again, he starts out
sounding not only black, but

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.867
Southern black, calling
Quentin young master.

00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:33.467
But then he actually, in the
course of one conversation, he

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:37.800
can actually metaphorically move
north, just in the space

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.567
of that one conversation.

00:15:39.567 --> 00:15:48.333
So here is something else that
happens between Quentin and

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:50.567
the Deacon.

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:56.433
And this is actually very
obviously a backward allusion

00:15:56.433 --> 00:16:00.767
to Macbeth, Act V, Scene five,
because the word tomorrow is

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:05.800
just repeated about eight times
in this little passage.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.800
This is something that happens
that, when Quentin is thinking

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.633
about his future, and we
sort of know that he

00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:14.700
has no future, right?

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.933
So this is someone with
no future talking to

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:21.333
someone with a future.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:23.567
"Take this around to
my room tomorrow

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.333
and give it to Shreve.

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:27.000
He'll have something for you.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.067
But not till tomorrow, mind.'
He took the letter and

00:16:31.067 --> 00:16:32.133
examined it.

00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:34.033
'It's sealed up.' 'Yes.

00:16:34.033 --> 00:16:35.867
And it's written inside.

00:16:35.867 --> 00:16:39.033
Not good until tomorrow,
mind.'...

00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:43.133
He was looking at me now, the
envelope white in his black

00:16:43.133 --> 00:16:45.467
hand, in the sun.

00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:50.200
His eyes were soft and irisless
and brown, and

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.400
suddenly I saw Roskus watching
me from behind all his

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.700
whitefolks' claptrap of uniforms
and politics and

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:05.700
Harvard manner, different,
secret, inarticulate, and sad.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.400
'You ain't playing a joke on the
old nigger, is you?' 'You

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.767
know I'm not.

00:17:10.767 --> 00:17:15.300
Did any Southerner ever play a
joke on you?' 'You're right.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.633
They're fine folks.

00:17:16.633 --> 00:17:20.867
But you can't live with them.'
'Did you ever try?' I said.

00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:22.633
But Roskus was gone.

00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:27.967
Once more he was that self he
had long since taught himself

00:17:27.967 --> 00:17:31.667
to wear in the world's
eye, pompous,

00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:35.500
spurious, not quite gross.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:41.567
'I'll confer to your wishes, my
boy.' 'Not until tomorrow,

00:17:41.567 --> 00:17:42.600
remember."

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.533
So the letter is not going to
be delivered to Shreve until

00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:49.133
Quentin is no more.

00:17:49.133 --> 00:17:54.800
And the Deacon obviously will
still be there to reap the

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.733
benefit of delivering
that letter.

00:17:57.733 --> 00:18:04.667
What is interesting here is the
very compressed time scale

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:07.800
that is packed into this
little exchange.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.067
In the course of one
conversation, the Deacon can

00:18:10.067 --> 00:18:13.700
slide back into someone just
like Roskus, still in

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.567
Mississippi from sometime back,
with the manner and the

00:18:18.567 --> 00:18:21.167
diffidence and the
fear, really.

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:26.400
And lack of self-assurance from
some time past. He can

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.200
slip back into it.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.233
But he's secure enough in
the present in Boston,

00:18:33.233 --> 00:18:37.233
Massachusetts, that he can get
out of it, just also in the

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:38.467
space of one conversation.

00:18:40.867 --> 00:18:45.767
So the Great Migration is not
just geographical migration,

00:18:45.767 --> 00:18:49.467
but also psychological
migration as well.

00:18:49.467 --> 00:18:53.433
That in his own mind, the Deacon
can move very, very

00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:56.433
fast from the south
to the north.

00:18:56.433 --> 00:19:00.500
And that agility of
movement is partly

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.567
what gives him a future.

00:19:02.567 --> 00:19:05.167
And there's something else
about the slightly

00:19:05.167 --> 00:19:09.333
ungrammatical and not quite
perfect command of English.

00:19:09.333 --> 00:19:14.933
"I'll confer to your wishes." He
means to say, I'll defer to

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:16.700
your wishes.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.867
But actually "confer" is the
more appropriate word.

00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:25.567
Because he's not actually
deferring to Quentin anymore.

00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:29.033
Deference is a thing of the
past, a thing of the

00:19:29.033 --> 00:19:33.467
geographical south, and because
in Massachusetts, he's

00:19:33.467 --> 00:19:35.533
actually conferring something.

00:19:35.533 --> 00:19:39.733
It is up to him to be the agent
and to confer something

00:19:39.733 --> 00:19:40.933
on Quentin.

00:19:40.933 --> 00:19:46.300
So the re-composition of the
playing field is dramatized in

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.700
some sense through that
imperfect command of the

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.733
English language.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:56.567
And so in this sense, Faulkner
is also rewriting both the

00:19:56.567 --> 00:19:59.733
future of race, but also the
future of the history of the

00:19:59.733 --> 00:20:01.467
United States.

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:06.633
So in both these ways, Benjy
and Quentin are really kin.

00:20:06.633 --> 00:20:12.733
They have a lot in common in the
very facts, relations, to

00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:14.233
black characters.

00:20:14.233 --> 00:20:16.333
And another theory --

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:19.033
I think this is something that
you already know, but I just

00:20:19.033 --> 00:20:24.267
wanted to refresh your memory,
they also are kin in the very

00:20:24.267 --> 00:20:29.500
dramatic reaction to this loss
of innocence on Caddy's part.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.233
So this is something that
we looked at last time.

00:20:32.233 --> 00:20:37.000
Benjy, the moment when Caddy
can no longer go to the

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.967
bathroom and wash
herself clean.

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:41.567
"We were in the hall.

00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:43.767
Caddy was still looking at me.

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:46.067
Her hand was against her
mouth, and I saw

00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:48.367
her eyes and I cried.

00:20:48.367 --> 00:20:49.733
We went up the stairs.

00:20:49.733 --> 00:20:53.833
She stopped again, against the
wall, looking at me and I

00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:58.100
cried and she went on and I
came on, crying, and she

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.567
shrank against the wall,
looking at me.

00:21:00.567 --> 00:21:04.467
She opened the door to her room,
but I pulled her dress,

00:21:04.467 --> 00:21:06.967
and we went into the bathroom
and she stood against the

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:08.833
door, looking at me.

00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:13.433
Then she put her arm across her
face and I pushed at her,

00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:13.867
crying."

00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:18.600
So we remember this very well,
a moment when suddenly, Caddy

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.567
is not putting her arms
around Benjy, but

00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:23.300
across her own face.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:29.133
And it is telling that is almost
completely reproduced

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:33.233
and repeated in Quentin's
section.

00:21:33.233 --> 00:21:36.700
"...one minute she was standing
in the door the next

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.567
minute he was pulling at her
dress and bellowing his voice

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:45.700
hammered back and forth between
the walls in waves and

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.233
she shrinking against the wall
getting smaller and smaller

00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:54.667
with her white face her eyes
like thumbs dug into it until

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:59.400
he pushed her out of the room
his voice hammering back and

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.833
forth as though its own momentum
would not let it stop

00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:10.033
as though there were no place
for it in silence bellowing."

00:22:10.033 --> 00:22:12.400
It's exactly the same episode.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.133
Except that now, all of a
sudden, we hear that sound,

00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:20.700
that bellowing, that Benjy is
making, that of course is

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.833
invisible and inaudible when
Benjy is telling the story.

00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:28.167
We know exactly what that
sound is doing.

00:22:28.167 --> 00:22:30.833
Caddy seems to be shrunken.

00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:32.333
She's getting smaller
and smaller.

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:35.800
She's so pushed around by Benjy,
that she's getting

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.333
smaller and smaller, until
she has no place to go.

00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:44.267
And we really haven't thought of
Benjy as being aggressive.

00:22:44.267 --> 00:22:47.133
But that's really what he is.

00:22:47.133 --> 00:22:51.367
Innocence is aggressive in its
demand that the world should

00:22:51.367 --> 00:22:55.100
completely conform
to his dictates.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.633
And Benjy is relentless in
demanding that Caddy should

00:23:00.633 --> 00:23:03.600
conform to his dictates.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.433
And the bellowing is the weapon
that he uses to make

00:23:07.433 --> 00:23:09.067
sure that she does that.

00:23:09.067 --> 00:23:12.933
And when she cannot, he just
keeps on doing it.

00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:18.167
So from Quentin, we have this
added perspective of what

00:23:18.167 --> 00:23:20.233
Benjy is doing to Caddy.

00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:22.867
But otherwise, it's exactly
the same moment.

00:23:22.867 --> 00:23:28.533
The same Caddy, occupying
the emotional center.

00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:34.500
And it's an unbearable place
for her two brothers to be.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.200
It's not surprising then, that
the consequence of that

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.133
traumatic loss should be
articulated in the same way.

00:23:42.133 --> 00:23:46.133
In Benjy, it's articulated as
incomplete syntax and the

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:48.800
consequences of that incomplete
syntax --

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.700
"I was trying to say, and I
caught her, trying to say, and

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.100
she screamed and I was trying to
say" -- and the frustration

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.200
would come after that.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:03.367
Here's Quentin exhibiting the
same symptom, the same

00:24:03.367 --> 00:24:06.400
reaction to the loss of Caddy.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.633
And it is surprising, because
we can say that Benjy has an

00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:13.767
incomplete syntax, because
he's an idiot.

00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:16.400
He's clinically retarded.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.633
Quentin is not retarded.

00:24:18.633 --> 00:24:23.133
But, he also doesn't speak in
complete sentences when he's

00:24:23.133 --> 00:24:24.867
very agitated.

00:24:24.867 --> 00:24:29.867
"Because women so delicate so
mysterious Father said.

00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:34.700
Delicate equilibrium of
periodical filth between two

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.533
moons balanced.

00:24:36.533 --> 00:24:39.267
Moons he said full and
yellow as harvest

00:24:39.267 --> 00:24:42.433
moons her hips thighs.

00:24:42.433 --> 00:24:46.833
Outside outside of
them always but.

00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:47.900
Yellow.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.267
Feet soles with walking like.

00:24:51.267 --> 00:24:54.467
Then know that some man that
all those mysterious and

00:24:54.467 --> 00:24:56.700
imperious concealed.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.100
With all that inside of them
shapes an outward suavity

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.700
waiting for a touch to.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.733
Liquid putrefaction like drowned
things floating like

00:25:08.733 --> 00:25:12.333
pale rubber flabbily filled
getting the odor of

00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:14.500
honeysuckle all mixed up."

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.667
It really is stream
of consciousness.

00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:22.100
It is completely internal
to Quentin.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.967
And the logic of association is
also peculiar to Quentin.

00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:29.633
So that it would be very hard
for us to understand

00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:30.633
completely.

00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:35.500
All we can say is that this is
both a point of commonality

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.300
between Quentin and Benjy.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:42.767
And also the point of departure
or deviation.

00:25:42.767 --> 00:25:47.767
From Benjy, we never get the
sense that women are filthy,

00:25:47.767 --> 00:25:51.367
that there's something
really repulsive and

00:25:51.367 --> 00:25:53.367
abominable about women.

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:57.700
That just having the menstrual
cycle, that in

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.933
itself is kind of filthy.

00:26:00.933 --> 00:26:06.367
But this is really what Quentin
is fixated on, is this

00:26:06.367 --> 00:26:11.167
kind of revulsion by female
sexuality in its most

00:26:11.167 --> 00:26:13.567
elemental form.

00:26:13.567 --> 00:26:16.700
In a sense that it doesn't
really take any action, just

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.400
in its state as femaleness,
there's something repulsive

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.100
about them.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.533
So this is a way --

00:26:24.533 --> 00:26:27.267
this stream of consciousness
--

00:26:27.267 --> 00:26:33.300
is Faulkner's way of getting us
to get into a mind that is

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.600
very different.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.733
In some sense, as different from
us as Benjy's mind is.

00:26:39.733 --> 00:26:47.767
And so let's think about this,
also by way of the one thread

00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:50.233
that Faulkner is giving us.

00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:54.900
In the case of Benjy, we see
that the guide that is taking

00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.633
us through the various salient
moments in Benjy, is the

00:27:00.633 --> 00:27:03.967
phrase, "Caddy smelled
like trees."

00:27:03.967 --> 00:27:07.733
And in the case of Quentin, the
phrase that will perform a

00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:11.800
comparable function is,
"getting the odor of

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.033
honeysuckle all mixed up." We
see that, that's the last

00:27:16.033 --> 00:27:20.467
sentence in that very
strange passage.

00:27:20.467 --> 00:27:23.933
And that phrase will appear
again and again in the same

00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:27.567
manner as Caddy smelled
like trees.

00:27:27.567 --> 00:27:33.933
So let's use that as a way to
try to understand Quentin.

00:27:33.933 --> 00:27:36.533
I don't think that we ever
will, completely.

00:27:36.533 --> 00:27:39.033
And that probably is a good
thing, that's really the

00:27:39.033 --> 00:27:42.067
effect that Faulkner
wants to cultivate.

00:27:42.067 --> 00:27:46.067
And this is moving away from
kinship to thinking about

00:27:46.067 --> 00:27:48.500
variation, the ways in
which Quentin is

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.833
different from Benjy.

00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:55.767
And one way in which Quentin
is different from Benjy, is

00:27:55.767 --> 00:27:59.767
that "sister" is basically
very, very clear, very

00:27:59.767 --> 00:28:03.633
straightforward, uni-vocal
meaning for Benjy.

00:28:03.633 --> 00:28:05.033
It only has one meaning.

00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:06.867
Caddy smelled like trees.

00:28:06.867 --> 00:28:12.233
She's the source of everything
that is wonderful and

00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:16.500
comforting and good for Benjy.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.867
The word sister has a much more

00:28:18.867 --> 00:28:21.733
complicated meaning for Quentin.

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:26.600
So we can think of it instead of
just as one word, as a very

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.833
complex semantic field.

00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:34.333
And what I'd like to do today is
to follow the trajectory of

00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:38.000
that word sister, and the phrase
"honeysuckle all mixed

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.600
up." Follow that to try to get
us from the beginning of

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:50.200
Quentin's chapter, not quite as
linear as I would like, but

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.400
I'll try to get us from the
beginning of Quentin's section

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.567
to the end of Quentin's
section.

00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:58.900
And I think we all know that
he kills himself, right?

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.000
He kills himself by
jumping into the

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.533
Charles River in Cambridge.

00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:05.633
And so how does he get from--

00:29:05.633 --> 00:29:08.767
and it's just one day, it's the
space of that one day--

00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:11.133
how does he get from the
beginning of that day, that

00:29:11.133 --> 00:29:13.867
morning, to the end
of that day?

00:29:13.867 --> 00:29:16.967
And we'll begin at the
point when Quentin

00:29:16.967 --> 00:29:19.800
is closest to Benjy.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.667
And then the other ways in which
he gradually moves away

00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:24.667
from Benjy.

00:29:24.667 --> 00:29:30.233
But this is a moment when we
sort of know why it is, but

00:29:30.233 --> 00:29:35.167
we're learning more about why
it is that Caddy's loss of

00:29:35.167 --> 00:29:39.733
sexuality is so traumatic
to Quentin.

00:29:39.733 --> 00:29:45.033
"Caddy you hate him don't you
She move my hand up against

00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:50.767
her throat her heart was
hammering there poor Quentin

00:29:50.767 --> 00:29:54.933
her face looked at the sky it
was low so low that all smells

00:29:54.933 --> 00:29:59.233
and sounds of night seemed to
have been crowded down like

00:29:59.233 --> 00:30:03.733
under a slack tent especially
the honeysuckle it had got

00:30:03.733 --> 00:30:07.067
into my breathing it
was on her face

00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:09.633
and throat like paint...

00:30:09.633 --> 00:30:14.300
I had to pant to get any air at
all out of that thick grey

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:19.000
honeysuckle yes I hate him I
would die for him I've already

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.300
died for him I die for him over
and over again everytime

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:23.600
this goes when I lifted my
hand I could still feel

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.467
crisscrossed twigs and grass
burning into the palm poor

00:30:25.467 --> 00:30:28.133
Quentin."

00:30:28.133 --> 00:30:30.933
It's a weird moment.

00:30:30.933 --> 00:30:38.767
Caddy is the one who is going to
be pregnant because of this

00:30:38.767 --> 00:30:43.700
out of wedlock affair
with men --

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.933
with someone, actually,
she doesn't even know

00:30:45.933 --> 00:30:49.000
who the father is.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.433
So she is the last person to be
in a position to say, "Poor

00:30:55.433 --> 00:31:02.033
Quentin." But Faulkner's
understanding of the situation

00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:08.867
is that even though Caddy
is in a dire situation

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:09.900
at this moment --

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:15.567
and it's a much worse thing,
back in the 20s for a young

00:31:15.567 --> 00:31:20.033
lady to be pregnant
out of wedlock --

00:31:20.033 --> 00:31:25.833
But in spite of that dire
situation, Caddy still has a

00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:29.133
better life than Quentin.

00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:35.433
And it has to do with the
complete incomprehension of

00:31:35.433 --> 00:31:37.467
Quentin for Caddy's life.

00:31:37.467 --> 00:31:40.867
So in that sense too, we can say
this is the common ground

00:31:40.867 --> 00:31:42.833
between Benjy and Quentin.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.700
Benji doesn't understand Caddy
because he doesn't have the

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.900
mental capacity for it.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.867
And Quentin doesn't understand
Caddy because he's never had

00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:03.233
the experience, and we know by
the end of section two, that

00:32:03.233 --> 00:32:06.900
he never will have
that experience.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.933
What does it mean to have that
particular sensation, and to

00:32:11.933 --> 00:32:13.500
have gone through that,
even though the

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.967
consequences are terrible.

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:19.867
So we can see another way in
which there's actually a point

00:32:19.867 --> 00:32:25.500
of intersection between The
Sound and the Fury and The

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:25.867
Great Gatsby.

00:32:25.867 --> 00:32:29.367
And there's really a lot in
common between Quentin and

00:32:29.367 --> 00:32:31.367
Gatsby, as well.

00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:36.333
The intense desire for the love
object to deny that she

00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:39.467
has any relation to anyone
other than yourself.

00:32:39.467 --> 00:32:42.200
This is what unites Quentin
and Gatsby.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.100
Gatsby can't stand the thought
that Daisy might have been in

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.300
love with Tom at one point.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.067
And Quentin can't stand the
thought that Caddy might

00:32:54.067 --> 00:32:56.433
actually be in love, just at
that moment, when she's having

00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:57.467
sex with this guy.

00:32:57.467 --> 00:33:00.367
He can't stand that thought.

00:33:00.367 --> 00:33:05.267
And that inability to stand that
thought says something

00:33:05.267 --> 00:33:09.267
about a lack in Quentin's
life.

00:33:09.267 --> 00:33:12.767
If he had had that experience,
he wouldn't

00:33:12.767 --> 00:33:14.067
have hated it so much.

00:33:14.067 --> 00:33:18.100
It wouldn't have been so
unbearable for him.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.933
And Caddy completely
understands that.

00:33:20.933 --> 00:33:25.800
So that's the background for
that repeated phrase, "Poor

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.367
Quentin."

00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:33.933
And so this is the point
where Benjy and Quentin

00:33:33.933 --> 00:33:35.067
are really as one.

00:33:35.067 --> 00:33:37.600
The two brothers are as one.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.333
And now we begin to move away
from that point of unity

00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:46.467
between Benjy and Quentin.

00:33:46.467 --> 00:33:52.233
Because we also know that in
fact, Caddy is a very fleeting

00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:55.867
presence in the Quentin
section.

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:59.533
The person who's there
a lot is actually the

00:33:59.533 --> 00:34:01.433
little Italian girl.

00:34:01.433 --> 00:34:07.200
So there's a very odd choice on
Faulkner's part--that for a

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.833
good part of the Quentin
section, Quentin is actually

00:34:10.833 --> 00:34:13.833
walking around with the
little Italian girl

00:34:13.833 --> 00:34:15.800
that he calls sister.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.667
So we're starting to get the
different permutations of the

00:34:19.667 --> 00:34:23.733
word sister in this very
complex, semantic field.

00:34:23.733 --> 00:34:25.700
"Hello, sister'...

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:31.000
She extended her fist. It
uncurled upon a nickel, moist

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.600
and dirty, moist dirt ridged
into her flesh...

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.467
I handed [the buns] to
the little girl.

00:34:38.467 --> 00:34:44.800
Her fingers closed about them,
damp and hot, like worms...

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.967
I went on.

00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:46.767
Then I looked back.

00:34:46.767 --> 00:34:51.033
She was behind me, under my
elbow sort of, eating.

00:34:51.033 --> 00:34:52.167
We went on.

00:34:52.167 --> 00:34:56.367
It was quiet, hardly anyone
about getting the odor of

00:34:56.367 --> 00:34:58.033
honeysuckle all mixed.

00:34:58.033 --> 00:35:01.767
She would have told me not to
let me sit there on the steps

00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:06.400
hearing her door twilight
slamming hearing Benjy still

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.267
crying Supper she would have
to come down then getting

00:35:10.267 --> 00:35:13.000
honeysuckle all mixed
up in it."

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.533
So here we started to get the
conflation of the two sisters.

00:35:17.533 --> 00:35:21.167
So in the italics, he's
going back to that

00:35:21.167 --> 00:35:23.333
traumatic moment, still.

00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:25.567
Caddy not been able to
wash herself clean.

00:35:25.567 --> 00:35:29.467
Benjy bellowing,
doors slamming.

00:35:29.467 --> 00:35:30.900
Caddy's still up in her room.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.867
So still that moment.

00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:36.667
But that moment is
bleeding into--

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:42.333
that moment from the past, is
bleeding into Quentin's

00:35:42.333 --> 00:35:45.733
current walk with the
little Italian girl.

00:35:45.733 --> 00:35:51.600
And that accounts for the images
of dirt and filth that

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.933
are being projected onto the
little Italian girl.

00:35:54.933 --> 00:35:58.833
She's just a little
girl, eating buns.

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:02.400
But the images of her
are actually of

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.900
a much older woman.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:10.333
Moisture and dirt ridged
into her flesh.

00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:14.233
So at the very least, we can say
that Quentin's experience

00:36:14.233 --> 00:36:19.367
of the entire world is channeled
through, mediated

00:36:19.367 --> 00:36:25.667
by, and contaminated by, his
sense of the loss of sexual

00:36:25.667 --> 00:36:28.267
innocence on the
part of Caddy.

00:36:28.267 --> 00:36:32.967
So that every single woman that
he's going to encounter

00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:36.900
is going to carry some
attributes of the Caddy who's

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.467
lost her sexual innocence.

00:36:39.467 --> 00:36:43.200
And the word sister also carries
the weight of that

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.000
contamination.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.200
But there are other interesting
permutations of

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.867
the word sister.

00:36:50.867 --> 00:36:54.633
And I just want to take us back
now to the very opening

00:36:54.633 --> 00:36:56.767
of the Quentin section.

00:36:56.767 --> 00:37:03.133
And this is something that is
once again, very peculiar, a

00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:08.333
kind of logical association not
entirely clarified for us.

00:37:08.333 --> 00:37:12.667
"I don't suppose anybody ever
deliberately listen to a watch

00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:14.000
or a clock.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.567
You don't have to.

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.933
You can be oblivious to the
sound for a long while, then

00:37:18.933 --> 00:37:24.133
in a second of ticking it can
create in the mind unbroken

00:37:24.133 --> 00:37:28.600
the long diminishing parade
of time you didn't hear.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.367
Like Father said down the long
and lonely light rays you

00:37:33.367 --> 00:37:36.667
might see Jesus walking, like.

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:41.167
And the good Saint Francis that
said Little Sister Death,

00:37:41.167 --> 00:37:44.967
that never had a sister."

00:37:44.967 --> 00:37:49.233
It's making no sense to us on
page 76, and it's probably

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:52.900
still not making a whole lot
of sense to you right now.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.767
We know though, that the watch
is very important.

00:37:56.767 --> 00:38:01.167
And he steps on the watch and
breaks the face of the watch.

00:38:01.167 --> 00:38:04.033
So he seems to have some quarrel
with that watch.

00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:08.200
And we'll come back to this in
plenty detail at the end of

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.000
the Quentin section.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.533
What is it?

00:38:10.533 --> 00:38:13.767
Why is it that he's so
angry at the watch?

00:38:13.767 --> 00:38:19.033
But for now, let's think
about that last line.

00:38:19.033 --> 00:38:22.700
"And the good Saint Francis
that said, Little Sister

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.433
Death, that never
had a sister."

00:38:25.433 --> 00:38:29.100
So we're just seeing the mapping
of the word sister on

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.200
to the little Italian girl.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.900
And now the word sister is
mapped on to death, ok?

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:42.000
So what is it that enables that
mapping to take place?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.100
And here, I should say something
about the way of

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.300
reading Faulkner on the whole.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.700
I don't really think that we
need to do a lot of research

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.567
to understand Faulkner.

00:38:52.567 --> 00:38:53.867
He's hard to understand.

00:38:53.867 --> 00:38:58.100
But actually, it takes more
reading than doing a lot of

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.100
outside research.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.967
But here is one moment when
actually, some outside

00:39:02.967 --> 00:39:07.633
research would cast light
on this particular logic

00:39:07.633 --> 00:39:09.167
association.

00:39:09.167 --> 00:39:14.833
So I just want to bring up this
very strange possible

00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:17.800
reference for Faulkner.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.267
And that is, it has to do with
Saint Francis and he's telling

00:39:21.267 --> 00:39:23.267
us that Saint Frances
is important to

00:39:23.267 --> 00:39:24.533
him for some reason.

00:39:24.533 --> 00:39:28.333
This is Saint Francis, Canticle
of the Sun, which

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:36.300
turns out to be pivoted
on the word sister.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.500
Praised be my Lord for Sister
Moon, and for the stars...

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:46.800
Praised be my Lord for Sister
Water, who is very serviceable

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.900
unto us, and humble and
precious and clean...

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:57.833
Praised be my Lord for our
Sister the death of the body,

00:39:57.833 --> 00:40:01.633
from whom no man living
can escape.

00:40:01.633 --> 00:40:05.433
So at the very least, we can
say that those different

00:40:05.433 --> 00:40:10.000
mappings that we've seeing in
Quentin seem to bear a very

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.433
close correspondence to this
particular logic of

00:40:13.433 --> 00:40:18.300
association that we see
in Saint Francis.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:23.400
Obviously, even though the two
logics are similar, it's for

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.033
different reasons that Quentin
would have that kind of

00:40:28.033 --> 00:40:29.800
clustering of terms.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.767
So let's move on now
to see what sister

00:40:33.767 --> 00:40:37.800
water means for Quentin.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.867
And this is once again
going back to Caddy.

00:40:39.867 --> 00:40:44.367
But suddenly water is
coming into play in

00:40:44.367 --> 00:40:47.400
his relation to Caddy.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:52.367
"Got to marry somebody Have
there been very many Caddy I

00:40:52.367 --> 00:40:57.433
don't know too many will you
look after Benjy and Father

00:40:57.433 --> 00:41:01.500
You don't know whose it is then
does he know Don't touch

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.133
me will you look after
Benjy and Father

00:41:05.133 --> 00:41:10.467
I began to feel the water before
I came to the bridge.

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:15.033
The bridge was of grey stone,
lichened, dappled with slow

00:41:15.033 --> 00:41:18.233
moisture where the
fungus crept.

00:41:18.233 --> 00:41:22.333
Beneath it the water was clear
and still in the shadow,

00:41:22.333 --> 00:41:26.933
whispering and clucking about
the stone in fading swirls of

00:41:26.933 --> 00:41:27.633
spinning sky.

00:41:27.633 --> 00:41:33.000
Caddy that I got to
marry somebody."

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.100
So the most obvious, clearest
fact is that Caddy is

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.233
pregnant, and that she needs
to marry somebody.

00:41:41.233 --> 00:41:43.233
And she's about to
marry somebody.

00:41:43.233 --> 00:41:45.933
So this is about the
only thing we know.

00:41:45.933 --> 00:41:52.267
But what is interesting here is
that, when she's about to

00:41:52.267 --> 00:41:56.833
be married and leave the Compson
house, what she says

00:41:56.833 --> 00:42:02.033
to Quentin is, will you look
up after Benjy and father?

00:42:02.033 --> 00:42:06.500
It is something that someone
who's about to leave will say.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.400
Someone who's about to get
married and leave will say.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.567
But it could also be said
by someone who is

00:42:15.567 --> 00:42:18.033
about to kill herself.

00:42:18.033 --> 00:42:19.633
I'm going to be gone.

00:42:19.633 --> 00:42:23.033
There are two possible meanings
for, "Look after

00:42:23.033 --> 00:42:26.567
Father and Benjy." Someone who's
no longer going to be

00:42:26.567 --> 00:42:27.333
around anymore.

00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:29.567
It's by someone who's not
going to be around.

00:42:29.567 --> 00:42:33.300
And there are two different ways
in which Caddy could be

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.633
not around anymore.

00:42:35.633 --> 00:42:40.067
Right now, she's going to
do the marriage option.

00:42:40.067 --> 00:42:41.767
That's the way in which
she's not going

00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:44.467
to be around anymore.

00:42:44.467 --> 00:42:51.233
But in Quentin's mind, there's
already that alternative root

00:42:51.233 --> 00:42:53.567
that he's toying with.

00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:59.800
It would be very nice if Caddy
were to kill herself, by

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.233
drowning herself.

00:43:01.233 --> 00:43:03.867
It would be one way.

00:43:03.867 --> 00:43:06.867
The water this time is not
something in the bathroom.

00:43:06.867 --> 00:43:09.633
It would be this gigantic
body of water.

00:43:09.633 --> 00:43:12.667
But she would indeed wash
herself clean in

00:43:12.667 --> 00:43:13.833
that body of water.

00:43:13.833 --> 00:43:18.633
So this is one way in which
sister and water consititute a

00:43:18.633 --> 00:43:22.633
potential mapping in
Quentin's mind.

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:25.400
But Caddy is not
going to do it.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.667
She's just going
to get married.

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:28.000
She's going to be alive.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.433
So this is the problem for
Quentin, is that Caddy is not

00:43:34.433 --> 00:43:37.700
going to clean herself by
killing herself and by jumping

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.500
into the water.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.100
And he's furious.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.967
And the world is not--

00:43:42.967 --> 00:43:46.667
nothing is right when she
refuses to clean herself as he

00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:48.667
demands her to be clean.

00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:52.100
So this is his conversation
with his father.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.167
"And father said it's
because you are a

00:43:54.167 --> 00:43:56.000
virgin: don't you see?

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.500
Women are never virgins.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.600
Purity is a negative state and
therefore contrary to nature.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.667
It's nature is hurting you not
Caddy and I said That's just

00:44:07.667 --> 00:44:11.200
words and he said So
is virginity and I

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.667
said you don't know.

00:44:12.667 --> 00:44:16.033
You can't know and
he said Yes.

00:44:16.033 --> 00:44:20.167
On the instant when we come
to realize that tragedy is

00:44:20.167 --> 00:44:22.467
second-hand."

00:44:22.467 --> 00:44:26.867
So it would have been the right
kind of tragedy if Caddy

00:44:26.867 --> 00:44:29.800
had just killed herself by
jumping into the water.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.167
It would've been appropriate
cleansing kind of tragedy.

00:44:34.167 --> 00:44:36.633
And instead, she's not
killing herself.

00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:42.900
Somebody has to kill himself
in order to perform that

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.000
needed action.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.800
And Quentin's father is
completely disapproving and,

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.767
in fact, making fun of
that whole operation.

00:44:55.767 --> 00:44:58.767
That it's right that Caddy
shouldn't be too upset about

00:44:58.767 --> 00:45:00.133
her pregnancy.

00:45:00.133 --> 00:45:02.300
Women are never virgins
to begin with, never.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.067
They're never virgins.

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:05.867
Interesting interpretation
of virginity.

00:45:05.867 --> 00:45:12.233
But I think that it really is
an interesting observation.

00:45:12.233 --> 00:45:14.033
That the person who is--

00:45:14.033 --> 00:45:16.600
both on the part of Mr. Compson,
but also on the part

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.433
of Faulkner--

00:45:17.433 --> 00:45:20.367
the person who ought to be most
upset by all of this is

00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:23.800
actually not the most
upset about it.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.567
And what happens when tragedy
becomes secondhand, becomes

00:45:27.567 --> 00:45:29.400
vicarious tragedy.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.333
Quentin is reacting to this
tragedy on the part of his

00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:34.967
sister, and making it
his own tragedy.

00:45:34.967 --> 00:45:38.267
Because in some sense, that's
really the only thing that he

00:45:38.267 --> 00:45:40.967
can call his own.

00:45:40.967 --> 00:45:47.100
So the problem with secondhand
tragedy is that it really is

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.000
somebody else's tragedy.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.167
It is not Quentin's
own tragedy.

00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:56.067
At the moment, he's been
devastated by it.

00:45:56.067 --> 00:45:57.767
And he likes to be devastated.

00:45:57.767 --> 00:46:00.433
He likes to be heroic, and
devastated, and to be

00:46:00.433 --> 00:46:03.133
devastated on behalf
of his sister.

00:46:03.133 --> 00:46:05.500
And to feel that he's the
one who's going to

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.800
make everything right.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.567
But there's always the danger
that a secondhand tragedy will

00:46:12.567 --> 00:46:17.000
very soon fade out, and
become a non-tragedy.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.500
And that's why the word
temporary is such an

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.000
unbearable word for Quentin
to contemplate.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.867
"And i temporary and he you
cannot bear to think that

00:46:30.867 --> 00:46:35.400
someday it will no longer hurt
you like this now...

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:42.167
And I temporary and he it is
hard believing to thing that a

00:46:42.167 --> 00:46:46.467
love or a sorrow is a bond
purchased without design.

00:46:46.467 --> 00:46:50.467
And which matures willynilly
and is recalled without

00:46:50.467 --> 00:46:54.700
warning to be replaced by
whatever issue the gods happen

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.733
to be floating at the time...

00:46:56.733 --> 00:47:02.733
And o temporary and he was the
saddest word of all there is

00:47:02.733 --> 00:47:07.167
nothing else in the world it's
not despair until time it's

00:47:07.167 --> 00:47:09.600
not even time until it was."

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.533
So the tragedy isn't even
that Caddy is pregnant.

00:47:14.533 --> 00:47:16.533
That's really nothing.

00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:22.067
The tragedy is the fact that
Quentin is devastated now,

00:47:22.067 --> 00:47:24.033
that wouldn't keep forever.

00:47:24.033 --> 00:47:26.467
He's going to lose.

00:47:26.467 --> 00:47:29.367
He won't be able to hold on
forever to that sense of

00:47:29.367 --> 00:47:30.733
devastation.

00:47:30.733 --> 00:47:35.133
And that is the tragedy that
he's going to fight to put an

00:47:35.133 --> 00:47:39.967
end to claim, once and for all,
by doing what he does at

00:47:39.967 --> 00:47:41.733
the end of the novel.

00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:46.400
And this is where he jumps off
from, this is the bridge that

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.333
he jumps off from in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

00:47:50.333 --> 00:47:54.367
And it just happens that it
seems there's some British

00:47:54.367 --> 00:47:56.267
reader had gone there.

00:47:56.267 --> 00:47:57.767
We know it's British
because of the

00:47:57.767 --> 00:48:01.233
spelling of the word odor.

00:48:01.233 --> 00:48:05.300
But at that bridge, there's
actually a plaque saying,

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:10.833
"Quentin Compson drowned in
the odour of honeysuckle.

00:48:10.833 --> 00:48:16.433
1891-1910." So this is a very,
very good reader of Faulkner,

00:48:16.433 --> 00:48:19.700
knowing exactly what is central
in Faulkner's mind.

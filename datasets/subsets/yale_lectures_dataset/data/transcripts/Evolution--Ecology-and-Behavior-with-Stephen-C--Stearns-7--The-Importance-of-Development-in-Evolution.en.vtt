00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.660
Prof: Today we're going
to talk about,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.630
or we're going to introduce the
role of development in

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.198
evolution,
and I would like to start by

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:19.340
asking you to make two jumps in
your head.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.681
In the first case I want you to
think of yourself as inside a

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.430
single-celled bacterium.
 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.540
If you go to a good book on the
gene networks and the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.284
biochemical networks that can be
found inside a single-celled

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:39.948
bacterium,
you will be stunned by the

00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:43.361
complexity of it and you will
deeply hope that you never have

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.580
to reproduce it on any
examination,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.590
because there is so much of it.
 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.640
Okay?
 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.340
That's inside one cell.
 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.904
Development doesn't arise until
we get to multi-cellular

00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:56.900
organisms.
 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.539
And if you were able to go into
the body of a multi-cellular

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.387
organism,
such as yourself,

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:05.060
and look at all the signaling
pathways,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.271
all the way that information is
transferred and integrated in a

00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:11.668
multi-cellular organism,
it's just as complex as the

00:01:11.668 --> 00:01:16.110
whole picture down inside that
one single-celled bacterium.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.540
So there are two huge kinds of
orders of magnitude,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.120
levels of hierarchical
complexity of information

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.388
integration that happen in a
multi-cellular organism like

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.379
yourself.
 

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:33.986
We call the way that the
information in the genes maps

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:38.854
into the structure of the
genotype the genotype-phenotype

00:01:38.854 --> 00:01:39.550
map.
 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.974
It takes us through all of that
complexity to produce something

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:45.791
that we can then try to
understand, which is a whole

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:46.510
organism.
 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.712
Another name for the
genotype-phenotype map is

00:01:49.712 --> 00:01:50.709
development.
 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.870
Okay?
 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.830
And what I'm going to try to
show you today is that out of

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.540
this almost unimaginable
complexity,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.944
two hierarchical layers of
orders of magnitude of

00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:05.528
information,
biologists have been able to

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:08.782
extract some interesting simple
rules and show that there are

00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:11.060
some large-scale patterns in
evolution.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.688
However, that task is far from
done,

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:17.360
and the understanding of the
genotype-phenotype map,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.250
or the understanding in general
of developmental biology,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.014
remains probably the most
pressing issue in basic research

00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:26.788
in biology for the twenty-first
century.

00:02:26.788 --> 00:02:29.430
It's something that occupies
some of the best faculty in this

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.159
department and some of the best
scientists across the globe.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.720
So it's a basic issue.
 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.150
And the thing that I hope you
take home from this lecture

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.395
today is that it's important,
both for microevolution,

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.050
and for macroevolution.
 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.041
Today I will be talking about
patterns that are pretty large

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.120
scale, they are more
macroevolutionary;

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.961
and next time I will be talking
about patterns that arise within

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:55.560
populations that reflect that
macroevolutionary history,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.960
but that have immediate
consequences for microevolution.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.889
So development isn't simple.
 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.677
It's going on both at large
scale, over long periods of

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:07.604
time,
producing patterns,

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:11.147
and it's going on at a very,
very short scale in every

00:03:11.147 --> 00:03:15.195
generation,
as each individual grows up and

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.449
turns into an adult.
 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.900
So what's involved in
development?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.342
It isn't really just the
production of the adult form

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:28.538
from an egg.
 

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:31.780
It is the living of the entire
lifecycle,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.910
from the formation of the
gamete, through the adult,

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.745
through all the changes the
adult goes through until it dies

00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:41.020
and produces the next
generation.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.276
So development refers to the
entire lifecycle,

00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:49.440
and evolution shapes the entire
lifecycle.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.440
So something that we get from a
very important discovery in

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.266
nineteenth century biology is
that all of life is made of

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:00.128
cells.
 

00:04:00.128 --> 00:04:04.210
It could've been organized
differently,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.907
and in fact there are
interesting science fiction

00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:08.617
novels,
like Solaris,

00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:12.120
by the great Polish science
fiction novelist Stanislaw Lem,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.748
that conceptualizes what life
would be like if it were not

00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:16.449
cellular.
 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.992
For example,
what if the whole ocean were

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.199
one living thing?
 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.209
But we know that that's not the
way life is on our planet.

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:25.920
On our planet life is all built
out of cells,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.677
and that means that the problem
of development is a problem of

00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:31.649
communicating between cells.
 

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:36.182
And cells are all set up as
information signalers and

00:04:36.182 --> 00:04:37.230
receivers.
 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.079
They have cell adhesion
molecules on their surfaces.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:43.999
They produce information
molecules, hormones,

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.829
and other signaling molecules
for export.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:54.720
This information is used to
change the fate of a cell.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.966
Now every cell in your body has
all the information in it that's

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:02.269
needed to build you,
and that is true of virtually

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:03.550
every organism.
 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.290
The only exception in us is our
red blood cells because they

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.661
don't have any nuclei,
so they don't have any DNA in

00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:09.079
them.
 

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.680
Okay?
 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.240
But in every other organism
that we know of,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.740
with minor exceptions like our
red blood cells,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.528
all the information is in all
the cells,

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:25.399
and that means that development
is a matter of editing,

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.586
it's a matter of determining
which information gets turned on

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:30.660
in the right place at the right
time.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.574
So the evolution of development
is about shaping those patterns

00:05:35.574 --> 00:05:38.673
in space and time,
within the framework of an

00:05:38.673 --> 00:05:40.600
organism,
to produce something that works.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.720
Development does a bunch of
things in evolution.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.201
One of the important ones is
that it has a strong role in the

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:56.531
course of the production of
individual organisms in shaping

00:05:56.531 --> 00:06:00.790
the kind of variation that is
presented to selection.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.149
Okay?
 

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:06.550
So the developmental mechanisms
that are shared by particular

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.951
organisms determine that only
certain kinds of phenotypes are

00:06:10.951 --> 00:06:14.226
going to be produced--
and there's a lot of variation

00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:17.369
within those phenotypes--
but they are a tiny portion of

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:18.480
phenotype space.
 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.677
And this is why we actually
see, morphologically,

00:06:22.677 --> 00:06:24.339
the Tree of Life.
 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.509
This is why dogs look like
wolves.

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.100
This is why humans look like
chimpanzees.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.478
This is why birds look like
birds and we can call them

00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:35.139
birds.
 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.382
It's because they share
developmental pathways that have

00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:41.800
been inherited from ancestors
and that have constrained the

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.279
range of phenotypes that can be
presented to selection.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:49.180
Now there's another important
thing about development.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.406
You might think that you could
conceive of the body as produced

00:06:55.406 --> 00:07:00.028
by an engineer,
but it's not really constructed

00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:02.639
that way in evolution.
 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.673
What goes on is that genes can
only build organisms out of the

00:07:07.673 --> 00:07:11.800
materials that are available at
a certain time,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.160
and then there is an
evolutionary memory,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.309
of which materials are
selected, and of the control

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:20.899
systems that are used to shape
the phenotype with them.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:26.579
Now I'll give you a couple of
examples.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.110
What is the cell membrane?
 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.470
The cell membrane is a lipid
bilayer, and it's been--it's

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.826
actually a marvelous organ now;
it has all sorts of special

00:07:37.826 --> 00:07:40.803
channels in it,
things that are filters to let

00:07:40.803 --> 00:07:43.980
particular stuff in and keep
other stuff out.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.459
It's been heavily modified by
evolution.

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:55.497
But there is no way that you
can take simply the DNA sequence

00:07:55.497 --> 00:08:00.742
in the genome and get a reaction
system that's going to construct

00:08:00.742 --> 00:08:02.300
cell membranes.
 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.783
All known cell membranes are
actually constructed

00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:09.483
biologically by using
pre-existing cell membranes as

00:08:09.483 --> 00:08:10.500
templates.
 

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.334
In other words,
the cell membrane itself is an

00:08:13.334 --> 00:08:15.350
information transfer molecule.
 

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.389
So that's one.
 

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:22.139
There's another,
and that's bones.

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:26.805
Your bones are made out of a
material called hydroxyapatite,

00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:29.970
which is a calcium phosphate
material.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.779
And hydroxyapatite has the
following extremely convenient

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:35.639
feature.
 

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:39.787
If you take hydroxyapatite and
you put it under stress,

00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:44.320
it will strengthen itself in
the direction of the stress.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.879
That means that the genes don't
have to have sensor systems to

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:51.541
detect stress,
and they don't have to worry

00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:54.572
about how they're going to make
a bone strong in the direction

00:08:54.572 --> 00:08:55.220
of stress.
 

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.820
All they have to do is say,
"Hey,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.860
I'm going to use hydroxyapatite
to make bones,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.390
and then when that baby first
starts to toddle around and walk

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.461
on its legs,
its hips start getting

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:07.028
strengthened in the direction of
stress."

00:09:07.028 --> 00:09:09.053
Now, in fact,
there are modifier genes that

00:09:09.053 --> 00:09:11.558
then take this and use it to
their own advantage,

00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:14.246
by building in protein
molecules that strengthen the

00:09:14.246 --> 00:09:16.250
bone in the direction of the
stress.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.120
Okay?
 

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.344
But the initial signal,
which direction is the stress

00:09:20.344 --> 00:09:22.080
coming from, is a freebie.
 

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.899
It's given by the biochemical
properties of a hydroxyapatite.

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:31.480
So that's one, a second one.
 

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.460
Here's a third one,
gastrulation.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.379
When vertebrate embryos,
and many other embryos,

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:43.210
grow, they grow up as a ball of
cells which then becomes a

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.101
hollow sphere of cells,
and that hollow sphere of

00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.811
cells, which by the time it
gastrulates has thousands of

00:09:49.811 --> 00:09:50.548
cells in it.
 

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.418
You can think of it as a little
pulsing basketball.

00:09:53.418 --> 00:09:53.664
Okay?
 

00:09:53.664 --> 00:09:55.529
It's a little sphere that's
pulsing,

00:09:55.529 --> 00:10:00.100
and if you simply let this
thing grow to a certain size,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.950
the tension in the actin
tubules in the cells will cause

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.259
it to spontaneously invaginate.
 

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:09.509
So it'll get a dimple in it,
like you pushed your thumbs

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:10.100
into it.
 

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.610
This happens spontaneously.
 

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.462
It is not as though the genes
have to say, "I am going to

00:10:15.462 --> 00:10:19.379
construct a mechanism that's
going to make my gastrula form.

00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:21.360
When my blastula turns into a
gastrula,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.538
when my hollow ball of cells
turns into a thing that's got a

00:10:24.538 --> 00:10:26.634
dimple in it,
and then forms three cell

00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:29.650
layers, out of which I can make
muscles and bones and skin and

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.528
gut and all of that kind of
stuff,

00:10:31.528 --> 00:10:33.720
when that happens that's a
freebie."

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.113
Okay?
 

00:10:34.113 --> 00:10:38.437
That is just in the tension of
the actin filaments in an

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:40.558
expanding ball of cells.
 

00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:44.769
So these are some of the
properties of the biological

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:48.899
materials that organisms are
constructed out of,

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:52.604
and it means that on the one
hand the genes don't have

00:10:52.604 --> 00:10:55.330
complete control over the
phenotype,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.856
but on the other hand they are
given certain things by the

00:10:59.856 --> 00:11:04.940
materials that don't have to be
specified in the DNA sequence.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.308
So where does development fit?
 

00:11:09.308 --> 00:11:11.139
I'm giving you real large-scale
messages now.

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:14.070
Okay?
 

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.360
The biological disciplines that
we call Ecology and Behavior

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.505
actually deal with the processes
that reduce the cohort of

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:26.870
newborn organisms to the ones
that survive to reproduce.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.269
Okay?
 

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:31.048
Ecology and Behavior actually
study the mechanics of natural

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:33.830
selection, while they study a
lot of other stuff as well.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.940
But that's the level at which
that happens.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.312
Genetics takes the genotypes of
the parents and it transforms

00:11:40.312 --> 00:11:43.956
the genotypes of the parents
through Hardy-Weinberg

00:11:43.956 --> 00:11:47.096
equations,
through the selection that's

00:11:47.096 --> 00:11:49.912
operating on them,
through all of that stuff that

00:11:49.912 --> 00:11:51.129
we just looked at quickly.
 

00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:54.186
It takes the genotypes of the
parents and transforms them into

00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:55.840
the genotypes of the offspring.
 

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.668
Okay?
 

00:11:56.668 --> 00:11:59.039
So genetics is all about
information transfer.

00:12:02.658 --> 00:12:06.822
Lots of people that like
computers do pretty well at

00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:07.720
genetics.
 

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.267
What development does is it
takes that information in the

00:12:12.267 --> 00:12:17.220
genotype and it maps it into the
material of the phenotype.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.562
You can think of development as
being a big transduction

00:12:20.562 --> 00:12:23.663
mechanism that takes
material--takes information and

00:12:23.663 --> 00:12:25.062
turns it into material.
 

00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:25.668
Okay?
 

00:12:25.668 --> 00:12:29.446
And, in the process,
it places limits on what the

00:12:29.446 --> 00:12:33.553
phenotypes can look like,
so that not every conceivable

00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:37.820
phenotype is going to arise out
of the DNA sequence in a genome;

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.720
only a certain range.
 

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.866
Flies are going to look like
flies, sheep are going to look

00:12:43.866 --> 00:12:48.230
like sheep, and daffodils are
going to look like daffodils.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.433
If we look at what development
has been able to produce,

00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:52.970
well.
 

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.318
in a large-scale it has
produced some very basic things,

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:59.668
and we can see that by a
comparison of the body plans of

00:12:59.668 --> 00:13:01.740
the major groups of organisms.
 

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.504
I'd just like to take a moment
here and see if I can elicit

00:13:06.504 --> 00:13:11.269
from you some sense of what it
is that we're looking at.

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.596
Okay?
 

00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:15.390
I assume that you're all pretty
comfortable with chordates,

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.418
because that's what you are.
 

00:13:17.418 --> 00:13:18.432
Okay?
 

00:13:18.432 --> 00:13:26.539
Can anybody tell me what a
bryozoan is?

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:32.210
A bryozoan is a moss animalcule;
it is a moss animal.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.585
Bryozoans produce beautiful
exoskeletons,

00:13:34.585 --> 00:13:37.080
and you can find them on
tropical reefs.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.909
Anybody comfortable with what a
priapulate is?

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.669
A priapulid is a deep-sea worm
that forages with a tentacle and

00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:51.158
when you pull it out of its
hole, it looks like a penis;

00:13:51.158 --> 00:13:53.159
which is why it's called a
priapulid.

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:58.470
Okay? What about a tardigrade?
 

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.168
Tardigrades are little water
bears.

00:14:01.168 --> 00:14:01.504
Okay?
 

00:14:01.504 --> 00:14:04.850
They look a little bit like
insects or crustaceans,

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.399
and they're very tiny,
and they're extremely cute.

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:08.804
Okay?
 

00:14:08.804 --> 00:14:11.399
So tardigrades are water bears.
 

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:15.370
Arthropods, who's in the
arthropods?

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.129
Insects are arthropods.
 

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:26.220
What are the other big groups
of arthropods?

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.524
Student: 
&gt;.

00:14:27.524 --> 00:14:28.673
Prof: Crustaceans;
yes spiders,

00:14:28.673 --> 00:14:29.700
spiders and their relatives.
 

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:35.115
Arthropods are anything with
jointed legs--that's just Greek

00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:37.870
for jointed leg,
arthro-pod.

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:45.808
Pogonophorans?
 

00:14:45.808 --> 00:14:49.273
A tiny phylum of worms that
live in the sand and are living

00:14:49.273 --> 00:14:52.498
fossils and haven't really
changed their morphology for

00:14:52.498 --> 00:14:54.168
about 400 million years.
 

00:14:54.168 --> 00:14:56.259
So there's a lot of big-scale
stuff here.

00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:58.460
This is basically the animal
kingdom.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.043
Okay?
 

00:14:59.043 --> 00:15:03.139
And it's formed into these
groups.

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:05.770
And just to give you a little
bit of timeline,

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.344
it's about 600 million years,
700--Bilateria,

00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:11.210
yeah, six or seven-hundred
million years ago.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.158
A lot of stuff happens really
quickly, because from this point

00:15:15.158 --> 00:15:18.980
to this point here is only about
a hundred million years.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.509
At this point we're still 500
million years ago.

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:22.889
Okay?
 

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.470
So this is big-scale stuff.
 

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.643
The cnidarians and the
ctenophores formed trace fossils

00:15:28.643 --> 00:15:30.730
in the pre-Cambrian ooze.
 

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.950
So they may go back a billion
years;

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.210
not sure about how far back.
 

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.750
So if you look at what happened
when multi-cellular organisms

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.288
formed and one branch of them
went off to become animals,

00:15:43.288 --> 00:15:46.210
this is what development was
able to produce.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.745
It could produce body
axes--front and back,

00:15:48.745 --> 00:15:50.958
left/right;
produce a skeleton,

00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.970
organ system,
symmetry and cell layers.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.836
And figuring out the shared
general mechanisms by which

00:15:57.836 --> 00:16:00.700
development can produce those
things,

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.589
and then how evolution can
tweak them to make them

00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:05.889
different in these different
groups,

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:08.769
is evolutionary developmental
biology,

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:11.548
or evo-devo.
 

00:16:11.548 --> 00:16:14.470
There are some big and striking
differences among these groups.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.735
For example,
this group up here has an

00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:20.408
exoskeleton, and this group down
here has an endoskeleton;

00:16:20.408 --> 00:16:24.178
and that places very
fundamental constraints on

00:16:24.178 --> 00:16:27.129
growth, size,
all kinds of things.

00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:28.570
What can it do in plants?
 

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:34.820
Well here is an extremely
sketchy view of the plant world.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.441
And, by the way,
I would've used a much more

00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:38.288
complex view of the plant world
than this one,

00:16:38.288 --> 00:16:43.107
but this is the one which is
publicly okay without copyright

00:16:43.107 --> 00:16:44.168
protection.
 

00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:44.446
Okay?
 

00:16:44.446 --> 00:16:47.658
So for you plant biologists
that are worried about the view

00:16:47.658 --> 00:16:50.149
of the plant world,
this is pretty simple.

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:54.447
Basically what this does is it
takes you from ferns and their

00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:58.243
relatives through cycads,
ginkgoes, pine trees and fir

00:16:58.243 --> 00:16:59.960
trees;
the gnetophyta,

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.759
which have some really cool
plants that live in Namibia;

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:07.140
Wellitschia and other things
like that are gnetophytes.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.342
And then the magnoliophyta are
all flowering plants,

00:17:10.342 --> 00:17:11.410
going out here.
 

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.170
So this is a huge group down
here.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.800
And if you look at that,
what has development and the

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.230
evolution of development been
able to produce?

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.371
Well these guys are all
variations on the following

00:17:23.371 --> 00:17:28.119
themes: a meristem-root axis;
where xylem and phloem appear;

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:31.414
where wood appears;
the kinds of branching patterns

00:17:31.414 --> 00:17:33.751
they have;
whether they have naked or

00:17:33.751 --> 00:17:36.910
covered seeds;
whether they have leaves;

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.328
and whether they have flowers.
 

00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:43.578
So you can see that the image
that I'm trying to create here,

00:17:43.578 --> 00:17:47.825
in both plants and in animals,
is that there's certain shared

00:17:47.825 --> 00:17:51.248
general features,
and that what evolution has

00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:55.142
done is that it has made many,
many different combinations of

00:17:55.142 --> 00:17:58.505
those features,
to create the diversity that we

00:17:58.505 --> 00:18:01.810
see,
and that this is done through

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.730
the evolution of development.
 

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.727
Mechanistically a lot of this
is going on at the level of gene

00:18:08.727 --> 00:18:13.647
regulation;
and this is a recap of the

00:18:13.647 --> 00:18:18.970
structure of the eukaryotic
gene.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.789
And the parts that I want you
to focus on right now are the

00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:23.250
promoters and the enhancers.
 

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.932
So these are parts of the DNA
molecule that receive a signal,

00:18:28.932 --> 00:18:33.288
which says turn this gene on or
turn it off.

00:18:33.288 --> 00:18:38.589
And I want to show you just
exactly what kind of a network

00:18:38.589 --> 00:18:41.660
of information that results in.
 

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.980
You can think of there being
regulators--

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.961
and we will talk a little bit
about what kinds of regulators

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.950
are used early in development--
and that these then feed into a

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.450
signaling cascade where a signal
goes out,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.922
there's a receiver,
there's a transducer that turns

00:18:58.922 --> 00:19:01.838
that signal into a transcription
factor.

00:19:01.838 --> 00:19:06.203
A transcription factor then is
going to go out and it's going

00:19:06.203 --> 00:19:10.641
to bind to the enhancer region
of a gene, or a promoter region

00:19:10.641 --> 00:19:11.660
of a gene.
 

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.210
Okay, so it's bringing in a
signal.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.425
The signal might be either turn
it on or turn it off,

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:17.837
but it's bringing in a signal;
that's what a transcription

00:19:17.837 --> 00:19:18.460
factor will do.
 

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.903
You can think of there being
other pathways and other signals

00:19:20.903 --> 00:19:23.036
going through them,
and they can turn on

00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:25.497
transcription factors,
and some of those will come

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:26.798
down and sit down on the same
gene.

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:29.834
It isn't all only one
transcription factor that can

00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:31.230
sit down on one gene.
 

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.382
In an average gene in
Drosophila there are about ten

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:37.348
to twenty binding sites in its
control region.

00:19:37.348 --> 00:19:39.974
That means that ten to twenty
different transcription factors

00:19:39.974 --> 00:19:43.440
can sit down on a single gene,
and one transcription factor

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.695
can bind to the control regions
of anywhere from one gene to

00:19:47.695 --> 00:19:49.500
several hundred genes.
 

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:49.891
Okay?
 

00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:54.038
There are about 13,000 genes in
a drosophila genome.

00:19:54.038 --> 00:19:58.194
So that gives you some idea of
the array of possibilities of

00:19:58.194 --> 00:20:02.140
turning all those things on or
off, as you go through.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.950
That is a huge array of
possibilities,

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.140
and I think you'll see,
when I show you later,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.877
how you take an onychophoran
worm and turn it into a

00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:11.632
Drosophila,
that you could imagine

00:20:11.632 --> 00:20:13.818
evolution might have had to use
a lot of them,

00:20:13.818 --> 00:20:17.451
in order to turn something like
a worm into something like a

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:18.190
fruit fly.
 

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.430
There is another way to think
about this.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:31.675
Think about the control region
of a gene as the keys on a

00:20:31.675 --> 00:20:34.242
piano,
and think about the

00:20:34.242 --> 00:20:38.688
transcription factors as the
fingers on the hand of the

00:20:38.688 --> 00:20:43.980
person who's playing the piano,
and think about evolution as

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.910
the composer who wrote the
score.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:51.990
You know perfectly well that
you can play all kinds of tunes

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:56.432
on the keys of a piano,
and you know perfectly well

00:20:56.432 --> 00:21:00.922
that there are traditions in
music of different kinds of

00:21:00.922 --> 00:21:02.308
related music.
 

00:21:02.308 --> 00:21:06.231
So anyone who has listened to
Bach is probably going to

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:09.901
recognize Telemann,
and people who have listened to

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:13.040
Schoenberg are going to
recognize more modernist

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.910
composers.
 

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.690
So you can think of those as
being clades,

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.733
and you can think of the
cultural tradition as being

00:21:18.733 --> 00:21:20.626
inherited,
and there's constraining

00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:23.420
variation within the range of
scores that are composed on the

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:23.838
piano.
 

00:21:23.838 --> 00:21:26.766
Of course, what we're dealing
with in a genome is like the

00:21:26.766 --> 00:21:29.588
biggest symphony orchestra you
ever saw in your life.

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:30.056
Okay?
 

00:21:30.056 --> 00:21:33.509
So it's much,
much bigger than that.

00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:36.210
So a few points about the
control of development.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:42.204
At the beginning of
development, when the first cell

00:21:42.204 --> 00:21:48.018
is getting set up to divide,
and in the formation of the

00:21:48.018 --> 00:21:50.828
very early multi-cellular
stages,

00:21:50.828 --> 00:21:54.078
there are concentration
gradients that are produced.

00:21:54.078 --> 00:21:56.740
So before the first cell
divides, there will be like a

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.750
front end and a back end of the
cell,

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.376
and chemistry will get set up
to produce molecules that then

00:22:02.376 --> 00:22:05.390
form a concentration gradient
across the cell,

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.568
and the concentration of those
molecules is positional

00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:11.808
information on what's the front
and what's the back.

00:22:11.808 --> 00:22:14.491
And as the cell divides,
it retains that information on

00:22:14.491 --> 00:22:16.430
where it is in the front or the
back.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.108
That's how the Drosophila
embryo is set up.

00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:22.231
And we will also see that this
kind of concentration gradient

00:22:22.231 --> 00:22:24.990
is used in the construction of
the vertebrate limb.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.972
By the way, the signaling
center on the vertebrate limb,

00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:31.173
when it's just a little paddle
of cells, is basically in the

00:22:31.173 --> 00:22:31.769
armpit.
 

00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:32.265
Okay?
 

00:22:32.265 --> 00:22:38.007
So if you want to think of
smelly molecules being produced,

00:22:38.007 --> 00:22:39.690
think armpits.
 

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.585
What then happens is that
transcription factors are used

00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:47.835
to define specific areas where
only a precise subset of genes

00:22:47.835 --> 00:22:49.038
is expressed.
 

00:22:49.038 --> 00:22:51.540
So remember,
all the info in the whole

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.298
genome is in every cell.
 

00:22:53.298 --> 00:22:55.910
You only want a certain subset
for this part of the organism

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:56.838
that you're making.
 

00:22:56.838 --> 00:23:01.423
So the gradient,
the chemical gradient then sets

00:23:01.423 --> 00:23:06.105
up gene expression,
and the transcription factors

00:23:06.105 --> 00:23:10.690
appropriate to that position get
turned on.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.407
Genes are regulated by
combinations of activators and

00:23:14.407 --> 00:23:18.065
repressors,
and this combinatorial control

00:23:18.065 --> 00:23:23.112
is what gives you the huge
diversity of cell specific gene

00:23:23.112 --> 00:23:24.440
expressions.
 

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.471
When I say combinatorial
control, think of composers

00:23:27.471 --> 00:23:29.970
writing notes and people playing
pianos;

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.420
that's combinatorial control
too.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.256
All the music that's ever been
written, that can be played on a

00:23:36.256 --> 00:23:39.969
piano, is simply a variation on
all the combinations of those

00:23:39.969 --> 00:23:41.640
keys in space and time.
 

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.940
So, the control can get complex.
 

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.403
It can be a cascade of
information, and genes that

00:23:49.403 --> 00:23:52.369
produce transcription factors
can be regulated by genes that

00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:54.078
produce transcription factors.
 

00:23:54.078 --> 00:23:58.723
And this sets up situations
where genes can switch their

00:23:58.723 --> 00:23:59.400
roles.
 

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.541
It is not correct to think that
there are some genes that are

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:05.369
early development genes,
and then there are other genes

00:24:05.369 --> 00:24:06.680
that are adult genes.
 

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.211
Genes are used flexibly,
in many different contexts,

00:24:09.211 --> 00:24:12.093
depending upon the information
that's coming in to regulate

00:24:12.093 --> 00:24:12.538
them.
 

00:24:12.538 --> 00:24:15.823
Certainly there are some genes
that are quite important in the

00:24:15.823 --> 00:24:19.160
embryo, but it turns out they
also play a role in the adult.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.430
We'll see a case of this a
little bit later.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.268
Not surprisingly it's the genes
that determine the general

00:24:26.268 --> 00:24:28.758
pattern that switch on first,
and the ones that are

00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:30.700
controlling detail switch on
later.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.029
So when I say 'general pattern'
I mean--

00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:35.568
for example,
in the vertebrate embryo,

00:24:35.568 --> 00:24:37.538
the front and the back,
the top and the bottom,

00:24:37.538 --> 00:24:40.808
the left and the right:
that gets laid down first.

00:24:40.808 --> 00:24:44.788
Then the embryo gets chopped up
into a sequence of segments.

00:24:44.788 --> 00:24:48.152
Some of them turn into the
head, some of them turn into leg

00:24:48.152 --> 00:24:49.856
segments;
some of them have extremities,

00:24:49.856 --> 00:24:51.279
some of them don't--that kind
of thing.

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:52.210
Okay?
 

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:58.587
So this sequence of how the
early general pattern gets set

00:24:58.587 --> 00:25:01.078
up,
and then how the details are

00:25:01.078 --> 00:25:03.878
developed,
that's all developmental

00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:09.349
genetics, and that's produced in
evolution a whole lot of stuff.

00:25:09.349 --> 00:25:12.390
Now, a little bit of vocabulary.
 

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.005
You're going to hear,
in this area,

00:25:14.005 --> 00:25:14.670
about boxes.
 

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.900
Okay?
 

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.385
You're going to hear about
homeoboxes, MADS boxes,

00:25:18.385 --> 00:25:19.298
stuff like that.
 

00:25:19.298 --> 00:25:21.970
I want to tell you what boxes
are.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.853
They are very highly conserved
sequence motifs,

00:25:25.853 --> 00:25:30.579
and they are found in the DNA
that codes for a particular

00:25:30.579 --> 00:25:33.618
family of transcription factors.
 

00:25:33.618 --> 00:25:37.410
The reason that this
sequence--by the way,

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:44.740
it's about I think--I think
it's about--

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.848
I'm not sure whether its
seventy to eighty codons,

00:25:48.848 --> 00:25:51.380
or seventy to eighty
nucleotides long.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.078
But these boxes are not too
long.

00:25:54.078 --> 00:25:57.123
They're conserved because they
have a very important function,

00:25:57.123 --> 00:25:58.769
and that is to bind to the DNA.
 

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:02.440
So they have a helix twist,
helix structure,

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.230
and that means that if the DNA
molecule is here,

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.167
this part of that protein,
this part of that transcription

00:26:09.167 --> 00:26:11.630
factor,
is going to fit right into it.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:16.190
And it's because they are
transcription factors--the boxes

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.509
are found in transcription
factors--that this is a very

00:26:20.509 --> 00:26:22.588
conserved interaction.
 

00:26:22.588 --> 00:26:25.442
Because DNA hasn't changed its
structure in three billion

00:26:25.442 --> 00:26:25.848
years.
 

00:26:25.848 --> 00:26:28.217
So if they're going to bind to
it, they have to have that

00:26:28.217 --> 00:26:30.837
structure, and so selection has
made sure that that sequence is

00:26:30.837 --> 00:26:31.430
preserved.
 

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:35.547
They're called boxes simply
because if you lay these DNA

00:26:35.547 --> 00:26:38.500
sequences out,
if you sequence a lot of DNA,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.170
and you are looking for one of
these things,

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:45.470
what you find is that wherever
there's a transcription factor,

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.910
there is a stereotypic sequence.
 

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.609
And the people who were
analyzing this,

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:54.804
first on computer printouts,
or now with imaging on computer

00:26:54.804 --> 00:26:58.500
screens, drew boxes around them,
to locate them.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.539
That's why the word 'box.'
 

00:26:59.539 --> 00:27:00.279
Okay?
 

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.109
So when you see one of these in
a DNA sequence,

00:27:07.109 --> 00:27:11.069
you know you probably have a
gene for a transcription factor.

00:27:11.069 --> 00:27:13.809
Here's the homeobox family.
 

00:27:13.809 --> 00:27:14.759
Okay?
 

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:19.740
There are thirteen homeobox
genes that have been identified.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.880
And this is from a number of
years ago;

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.890
this has probably been filled
out now.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.547
And they have two--well there's
more than two striking things

00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:30.338
about them.
 

00:27:30.338 --> 00:27:33.340
But the first thing that's
striking about them is that

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.868
they're deeply conserved.
 

00:27:34.868 --> 00:27:39.874
That means that they have
retained so much of their

00:27:39.874 --> 00:27:45.878
sequence identity that you can
recognize homeobox gene 1 in a

00:27:45.878 --> 00:27:50.585
human,
and you can see that the same

00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:56.430
gene is there in flatworms and
in earthworms,

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.660
in priapulids and so forth.
 

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.740
All the way through the animal
kingdom this gene has been

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.259
conserved, and you can pick up
something like it in cnidarian.

00:28:05.259 --> 00:28:08.194
And you wonder,
well how did there get to be

00:28:08.194 --> 00:28:09.970
thirteen in this family?
 

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.338
Well here you can see a gene
duplication event right here.

00:28:12.338 --> 00:28:18.909
Homeobox gene 1 in the
jellyfish and corals was

00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:24.113
duplicated right here--
this was the expansion of the

00:28:24.113 --> 00:28:27.010
central HOX genes--
and it happened here as well,

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.150
so that now there were two
copies.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.976
And that meant that this
developmental control switch,

00:28:32.976 --> 00:28:36.945
which was an extremely clever
piece of machinery to have

00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:39.690
around, now existed in two
copies.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.666
You could use the first one to
do whatever it used to be doing,

00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:45.500
and you can now evolve a new
function for the second one.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.030
This went on up until the time
that the vertebrates started to

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:50.700
evolve.
 

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.434
And in our closest relatives
there's one copy of the HOX

00:28:54.434 --> 00:28:56.880
gene, and it was duplicated
twice.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.420
It was duplicated at the level
of the Agnatha;

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.880
so the ancestors of the sharks.
 

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.701
And that means that all of the
vertebrates, the higher

00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:14.250
vertebrates, have four sets of
developmental control genes.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.374
Interestingly,
the first set is still used to

00:29:17.374 --> 00:29:21.492
lay down the major body axis,
and the fourth set is used to

00:29:21.492 --> 00:29:24.460
make a limb;
that's the new function.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.970
Okay?
 

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:32.224
Now they have deeply conserved
sequences, but they are also

00:29:32.224 --> 00:29:33.519
collinear.
 

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:35.808
By collinear, I mean this.
 

00:29:35.808 --> 00:29:40.094
Look at the sequence on the
genome, and look at what part of

00:29:40.094 --> 00:29:41.910
the body is controlled.
 

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.038
The parts that are on one end
control the head area,

00:29:45.038 --> 00:29:48.088
the parts on the other end
control the tail area,

00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:51.046
and the parts in the middle
control the stuff in the middle

00:29:51.046 --> 00:29:51.759
of the body.
 

00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:55.630
There isn't any logical reason
why it had to be this way.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.029
It's probably simply that when
vertebrates first started--

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:01.960
well when animals,
prior to vertebrates,

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.828
first started to get formed as
multi-cellular things,

00:30:04.828 --> 00:30:07.887
this happened to be one
convenient way to control

00:30:07.887 --> 00:30:08.778
development.
 

00:30:08.778 --> 00:30:11.680
But logically speaking,
giving the signaling apparatus

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.799
that's available in the genes,
there's no reason logically

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:16.990
that the genes have to be
collinear;

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.353
but it's a fact that they are,
and it's a marvelous fact that

00:30:20.353 --> 00:30:20.970
they are.
 

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:21.500
Okay?
 

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.799
This is just to show you that
you can take homeobox genes and

00:30:29.799 --> 00:30:32.460
look at their DNA sequences and
say,

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.440
"Oh, they have similar DNA
sequences."

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.039
And then look at what parts of
the bodies they control and see

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:42.864
that a homeobox gene in a fly,
that is homologous to a

00:30:42.864 --> 00:30:45.934
homeobox gene in a mouse,
is controlling a similar part

00:30:45.934 --> 00:30:46.608
of the body.
 

00:30:46.608 --> 00:30:49.880
So the things that are
controlling the tail end,

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.098
the green genes here,
are expressed in this part of

00:30:53.098 --> 00:30:55.740
the fly and in this part of the
mouse,

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.838
and the things that are
controlling the head end,

00:30:57.838 --> 00:31:00.410
that are expressed here in the
fly,

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.390
are actually expressed here in
the mouse.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.346
That's kind of interesting,
because it suggests that the

00:31:06.346 --> 00:31:09.412
mouse has added on some stuff
that is in front of the hind

00:31:09.412 --> 00:31:09.950
brain.
 

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:20.410
So here's the vertebrate limb.
 

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.858
Okay?
 

00:31:21.858 --> 00:31:27.634
And this is controlled by the
fourth copy of the HOX genes,

00:31:27.634 --> 00:31:28.930
the D copy.
 

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:33.247
And it shows you that if you
have, for example,

00:31:33.247 --> 00:31:38.410
D9 being the only one that's
turned on, you get that.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:43.038
If you have D9 and D10,
you get that.

00:31:43.038 --> 00:31:47.098
You have D9,
D10, D11, you get that.

00:31:47.098 --> 00:31:51.420
You have D9 through D12,
you get that.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.940
And you get all five of these
on and you get that.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.670
Okay?
 

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:03.009
So basically what this means is
the following.

00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:05.299
If you just have D9 on,
make a shoulder;

00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:08.405
D9 and D10, make a humerus;
D9 through 11,

00:32:08.405 --> 00:32:14.279
make a radius and ulna;
D9 through D12, make a wrist;

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:17.390
and all five, make fingers.
 

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:21.920
How simple, how logical.
 

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.398
Remember when I said at the
beginning we have these orders

00:32:24.398 --> 00:32:26.269
of magnitude of complexity
within cells,

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:29.019
and these orders of magnitude
of complexity between cells.

00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:33.710
Out of all of that complexity,
this simple pattern emerges.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.921
Oh, and I forgot,
notice that the genes are

00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:41.660
collinear in the limb.
 

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.029
Okay?
 

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:46.077
The ones that are on one end of
the gene are controlling the

00:32:46.077 --> 00:32:49.333
shoulder, and the ones that are
on the other end of the gene are

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:50.779
controlling the fingers.
 

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:52.480
So it's still collinear.
 

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.055
It's the like the body axis,
it's just been translated into

00:32:56.055 --> 00:32:56.609
a limb.
 

00:32:56.609 --> 00:33:00.328
Well what about flowers?
 

00:33:00.328 --> 00:33:05.553
The MADS genes also have a
sequence in them which shows

00:33:05.553 --> 00:33:09.230
that they're a transcription
factor;

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.519
there's a MADS box.
 

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:17.938
M-A-D-S is an acronym for the
original names that these genes

00:33:17.938 --> 00:33:18.680
had.
 

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.420
Okay?
 

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.760
Some of them started with an m,
some with an a,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.390
some with a d,
some with an s.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.806
Then after all that had
happened, it was noticed that

00:33:26.806 --> 00:33:28.118
they were related.
 

00:33:28.118 --> 00:33:30.769
So people started calling them
MADS genes.

00:33:35.038 --> 00:33:36.880
They're scattered throughout
the genome.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.910
They are not collinear.
 

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:38.828
Okay?
 

00:33:38.828 --> 00:33:41.031
In Arabidopsis,
they're on all five

00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:41.940
chromosomes.
 

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.748
There's nothing resembling the
HOX genes in the way they're

00:33:44.748 --> 00:33:45.910
genetically organized.
 

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.957
They fall into three groups:
the A group,

00:33:51.957 --> 00:33:54.009
the B group and the C group.
 

00:33:54.009 --> 00:33:59.079
So the A is not a single gene,
it's a group of related MADS

00:33:59.079 --> 00:33:59.779
genes.
 

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:03.048
B is another group of related
MADS genes.

00:34:03.048 --> 00:34:06.058
And within each of these groups
the genes are sharing

00:34:06.058 --> 00:34:07.680
phylogenetic relationship.
 

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.045
That means that the members of
the A group are probably all

00:34:11.045 --> 00:34:14.260
duplicates of an ancestral gene;
the members of the B group are

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.659
probably duplicates of an
ancestral gene for the B group;

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.349
and so forth.
 

00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:22.916
Now the neat thing about the
MADS genes is the way they

00:34:22.916 --> 00:34:24.440
control flowers.
 

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.090
And we're going to see that
evolutionary developmental

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.949
biology has a lot to do with the
production of beauty.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:33.030
&gt;
 

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.907
Two of the best understood
examples in evolutionary

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:39.130
developmental biology are
flowers and butterfly wings.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.250
Okay?
 

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.166
So this is an area where
researchers who go out to give

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:47.070
talks get to use a lot of neat
slides.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.829
The ABC model of flower
development goes like this.

00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:55.219
If only a gene from Group A is
turned on, make a sepal;

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.900
if only A and B are turned on,
make a petal;

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.150
if only B and C are turned on,
make an anther;

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.070
if only C is turned on make a
pistol and an ovary.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.773
So the regulation of B and C is
controlling male and female

00:35:07.773 --> 00:35:09.050
organ development.
 

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.289
This is combinatorial.
 

00:35:11.289 --> 00:35:12.289
Okay?
 

00:35:12.289 --> 00:35:14.570
It's the same general logical
principle.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:18.429
However, it's with a completely
different set of genes,

00:35:18.429 --> 00:35:22.559
and plants evolved
multi-cellularity independently

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:25.014
of animals,
which means that plants

00:35:25.014 --> 00:35:27.730
invented development in
evolution independently of

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:28.340
animals.
 

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.400
They both hit upon
combinatorial control as a

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.530
simple, logical way to control
development.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.900
That probably means it's a very
good idea.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.949
Okay?
 

00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:45.628
It's a very simple and
economical way of expressing

00:35:45.628 --> 00:35:47.780
information.
 

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.117
Of course every gene has a
history, and these MADS genes

00:35:51.117 --> 00:35:54.030
were doing something before they
made flowers.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.474
In fact, if you go back and you
look at the homologous genes in

00:35:58.474 --> 00:36:01.268
the plants that do not have
flowers,

00:36:01.268 --> 00:36:04.206
you discover that in ferns they
are controlling leaf

00:36:04.206 --> 00:36:06.202
development,
in conifers they are

00:36:06.202 --> 00:36:09.860
controlling cone development;
things like that.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.219
It's not as though these genes
were invented in order to make

00:36:13.219 --> 00:36:13.780
flowers.
 

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.884
They were pre-existing,
and they were co-opted by

00:36:16.884 --> 00:36:20.570
evolution at the point where
flowers started to evolve;

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:25.300
and gene duplications probably
helped in that process.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.445
So if we go back to the Burgess
Shale, back to the Cambrian,

00:36:29.445 --> 00:36:32.750
we find lots of onychophorans
running around.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.969
And if you go to an Australian
rainforest today,

00:36:34.969 --> 00:36:37.235
you will find onychophorans
still running around,

00:36:37.235 --> 00:36:38.510
and they look the same.
 

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.762
So 500 million years of
evolution hasn't changed

00:36:40.762 --> 00:36:41.530
onychophorans.
 

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:43.809
onychophorans are these neat,
velvet worms.

00:36:43.809 --> 00:36:45.960
They are, by the way,
viviparous.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.440
If you pick them up they squirt
glue on you.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.670
They have their own neat little
biology.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.550
They are the ancestors of the
arthropods.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:59.460
So what evolution basically did
was it took an onychophoran and,

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.635
among other things,
it turned them into fruit

00:37:01.635 --> 00:37:03.449
flies,
and butterflies,

00:37:03.449 --> 00:37:08.590
and horseshoe crabs and king
crabs and lobsters and shrimp.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.050
How do you do it?
 

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:15.440
Well it was done basically by
changing the range of segments

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.460
in which particular things were
expressed.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.409
If we go back here,
you can see that the

00:37:21.409 --> 00:37:23.260
onychophoran has a lot of
segments.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.650
It's got one leg on each
segment.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.768
Okay?
 

00:37:25.768 --> 00:37:28.590
The fruit fly has many fewer
segments and only six legs;

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:32.429
the onychophoran has fifty legs
or so.

00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:38.856
So basically what was going on
is that the HOX genes were used

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:40.516
to say,
"Oh, okay,

00:37:40.516 --> 00:37:42.900
now we're going to say that
these segments become a head,

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.818
these segments become a thorax,
these segments become an

00:37:45.818 --> 00:37:46.349
abdomen.
 

00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:48.559
We're going to make antennae on
the head,

00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:51.800
and we're going to make wings
on the thorax,

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.460
and we're going to make legs on
the thorax,

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.780
and the abdomen isn't going to
have any wings or legs."

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.929
Okay?
 

00:37:56.929 --> 00:38:00.431
The way this initially
happened--and you can find

00:38:00.431 --> 00:38:03.860
fossils that replicate some of
these stages--

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.719
you first make a generalized
segment,

00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:08.150
it's got both legs and wings on
it.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.710
Okay?
 

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.690
You make it many times.
 

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:11.940
So you've got both legs and
wings on lots of segments.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.461
Then you restrict the range of
expression so that only certain

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:19.871
segments have wings,
only certain segments have

00:38:19.871 --> 00:38:20.539
legs.
 

00:38:20.539 --> 00:38:24.617
You do that by altering the
domain of expression of control

00:38:24.617 --> 00:38:26.885
genes,
and you use that kind of

00:38:26.885 --> 00:38:29.268
combinatorial specificity to
say,

00:38:29.268 --> 00:38:32.329
"Okay, this is an antenna
and not a leg.

00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:34.809
Okay, it's an appendage growing
out of the body wall,

00:38:34.809 --> 00:38:38.460
but I'm going to make it into
an antenna that's on this

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.842
segment and I'll make it into a
leg if it's on that

00:38:41.842 --> 00:38:43.059
segment."
 

00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:46.500
So, of course,
this goes on in seconds;

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.710
evolution took hundreds of
millions of years.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.349
So it's not the same process.
 

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.625
Some of these HOX genes have
retained incredibly conserved

00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:57.130
functions.
 

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.000
In a famous experiment that was
done in the 1990s,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.869
Walter Gehring's group in
Switzerland,

00:39:01.869 --> 00:39:08.175
took Pax6, which is a gene
that's shared by all bilateral

00:39:08.175 --> 00:39:12.451
organisms,
and they genetically engineered

00:39:12.451 --> 00:39:16.170
fruit flies with an extra copy
of Pax6--

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.219
it is a gene that induces the
development of eyes--

00:39:19.219 --> 00:39:22.273
and by turning this gene on,
they were able to make that

00:39:22.273 --> 00:39:24.659
fruit fly grow eyes in
unexpected places.

00:39:24.659 --> 00:39:25.199
Okay?
 

00:39:25.199 --> 00:39:27.489
So it could grow one on
its--this is the regular eye;

00:39:27.489 --> 00:39:29.619
this is an eye growing on an
antenna;

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:31.719
this is an eye growing on a
haltier;

00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:33.849
and so forth.
 

00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:37.266
The interesting thing was that
they could do this with Pax6

00:39:37.266 --> 00:39:39.733
from a human or a mouse;
in other words,

00:39:39.733 --> 00:39:43.409
the DNA sequence in the gene
was so similar that it could be

00:39:43.409 --> 00:39:46.275
used to control the
developmental pathway in an

00:39:46.275 --> 00:39:50.199
organism in which that gene had
not been sitting for 600 million

00:39:50.199 --> 00:39:51.010
years.
 

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.889
That's pretty remarkable.
 

00:39:58.989 --> 00:40:02.871
Development is not easy to
evolve, and I think this gets

00:40:02.871 --> 00:40:07.177
across one of the reasons that
it's not easy to evolve changes

00:40:07.177 --> 00:40:08.518
in development.
 

00:40:08.518 --> 00:40:12.416
Every organism has to function
and reproduce in order for a

00:40:12.416 --> 00:40:16.052
gene to get transmitted,
and you can't tweak its

00:40:16.052 --> 00:40:20.650
development around too much or
you'll make it fall apart.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.702
It's like you're driving down
the road and you want to turn

00:40:23.702 --> 00:40:25.809
your Volkswagen into a Mercedes
Benz,

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:28.347
and so you get out your tools,
and you're going sixty miles an

00:40:28.347 --> 00:40:30.510
hour,
and you want to modify it,

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.989
but you can't crash.
 

00:40:31.989 --> 00:40:33.780
Okay?
 

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.440
So that causes constraints;
there's only certain things

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.539
that you can do while you're
moving down the road.

00:40:39.539 --> 00:40:43.630
These developmental constraints
are not permanent.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.556
The genetic control of
development does change more

00:40:46.556 --> 00:40:50.309
slowly than many other things,
but I would submit to you that

00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:52.920
if we wiped out everything on
the planet--

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.500
let's first duplicate earth ten
million times,

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.306
and then let's go through and
wipe out everything on all of

00:41:00.306 --> 00:41:03.489
those ten million planets,
except for one species,

00:41:03.489 --> 00:41:05.579
and we leave it some food.
 

00:41:05.579 --> 00:41:06.170
Okay?
 

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:07.840
It's the only thing that's
there.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.139
But on some planets all you've
got is fruit flies.

00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:12.309
On other planets all you've got
is redwood trees.

00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:14.465
On other planets all you've got
is butterflies,

00:41:14.465 --> 00:41:16.619
and on other planets you've got
albatrosses;

00:41:16.619 --> 00:41:18.449
but they have a food supply,
they can live.

00:41:18.449 --> 00:41:21.842
Give them long enough,
go away in your spaceship,

00:41:21.842 --> 00:41:25.449
come back, five billion,
ten billion years later.

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:28.300
I would submit to you that
every one of those planets is

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.530
going to have highly diverse
life on it,

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.905
and that many of the things
that we see on this planet you

00:41:33.905 --> 00:41:36.630
will see on each one of those
other planets.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:40.956
They will contain a signature,
probably a very interesting

00:41:40.956 --> 00:41:44.601
signature, of this huge
disturbance that has been

00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:46.119
created on them.
 

00:41:46.119 --> 00:41:51.230
But I think that it's possible
for redwood trees to evolve into

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.889
squid.
 

00:41:51.889 --> 00:41:55.940
I just think it takes them a
very long time.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.130
&gt;
 

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:04.246
The things that change slowly
constrain things that change

00:42:04.246 --> 00:42:08.510
rapidly, and genes don't cause
development by themselves.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.500
They're steering the dynamics
of gene products that interact

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.920
with environmental inputs.
 

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.782
So the genes actually are a
fair distance away,

00:42:16.782 --> 00:42:19.300
biochemically,
physiologically,

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.659
from the things they're
controlling.

00:42:22.659 --> 00:42:25.099
They are working through
complicated interaction systems.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.380
So, a few take-home points.
 

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.815
Development maps the
information in genotypes into

00:42:33.815 --> 00:42:35.849
the material of phenotypes.
 

00:42:41.789 --> 00:42:45.197
It's like the process that
occurs when a blueprint that an

00:42:45.197 --> 00:42:48.244
architect has drawn is turned
into a building by the

00:42:48.244 --> 00:42:49.739
construction company.
 

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.360
Developmental control genes use
combinatorial logic.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.338
There's a lot of other stuff
that's really important in

00:42:59.338 --> 00:43:02.427
evolutionary developmental
biology, besides combinatorial

00:43:02.427 --> 00:43:02.980
logic.
 

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.768
It happens to be a pet topic of
mine.

00:43:05.768 --> 00:43:10.161
You will find that if you talk
to people who do this for their

00:43:10.161 --> 00:43:13.574
profession,
that they regard combinatorial

00:43:13.574 --> 00:43:16.907
logic just as so natural,
so much a part of the

00:43:16.907 --> 00:43:20.518
landscape, that they hardly feel
the need to mention it anymore.

00:43:20.518 --> 00:43:22.934
But it is striking,
when you compare plants and

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:26.242
animals, that they both hit upon
this method of controlling gene

00:43:26.242 --> 00:43:27.030
regulation.
 

00:43:31.289 --> 00:43:35.197
The ancestors of currently
existing organisms often had an

00:43:35.197 --> 00:43:39.172
awful lot of the genes that are
now involved in controlling

00:43:39.172 --> 00:43:40.268
development.
 

00:43:40.268 --> 00:43:43.510
Remember that phylogenetic tree
I showed you for the HOX genes.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.989
Many of them are present back
in jellyfish,

00:43:45.989 --> 00:43:49.235
and certainly many more of them
are present in worms and

00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:51.420
crustaceans and things like
that.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:55.965
So a lot of what has gone on in
evolution is changing the

00:43:55.965 --> 00:43:59.780
specificity of expression in
time and space,

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.820
and the specificity of
receptors in time and space.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.286
Rather than necessarily
evolving new genes that make new

00:44:06.286 --> 00:44:09.485
kinds of proteins,
a lot of evolution has been

00:44:09.485 --> 00:44:13.239
concerned with making
combinations of existing genes.

00:44:13.239 --> 00:44:15.298
Interestingly,
there is a very good

00:44:15.298 --> 00:44:18.449
evolutionary developmental
biologist at Wisconsin.

00:44:18.449 --> 00:44:19.760
His name is Sean Carroll.
 

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.059
He is a charismatic guy.
 

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:28.050
And Sean has gone so far as to
say that most of evolution,

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:33.523
in the last 500 million years,
has consisted of the evolution

00:44:33.523 --> 00:44:37.224
of gene regulation,
rather than the evolution of

00:44:37.224 --> 00:44:38.739
new structural proteins.
 

00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:41.199
And, of course,
by taking an extreme stance,

00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:44.097
he has managed to generate a
controversy in which people are

00:44:44.097 --> 00:44:45.889
saying,
"Oh no, it's not just that.

00:44:45.889 --> 00:44:48.664
There are all of these other
new structural proteins that are

00:44:48.664 --> 00:44:49.449
going on."
 

00:44:49.449 --> 00:44:52.282
And this is always very good
for one's scientific career,

00:44:52.282 --> 00:44:54.813
because both sides are
increasing their publication

00:44:54.813 --> 00:44:55.320
rates.
 

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.900
Now, in fact,
both things have gone on.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.179
Okay?
 

00:44:59.179 --> 00:45:02.472
But by having a controversy,
people get motivated to pin

00:45:02.472 --> 00:45:03.610
down the details.
 

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.527
So I am making a little bit of
fun of controversies,

00:45:06.527 --> 00:45:09.730
but I also recognize that they
are very strong motivating

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:10.360
forces.
 

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.215
So next time,
we're going to talk about the

00:45:13.215 --> 00:45:16.820
expression of genetic variation
and reaction norms.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.472
And I want you to remember
today's lecture,

00:45:19.472 --> 00:45:22.820
because today I have talked
mostly about the big macro

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.280
picture;
the impact and the patterns of

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.239
developmental mechanisms in the
Tree of Life,

00:45:30.239 --> 00:45:32.849
in all plants and animals.
 

00:45:32.849 --> 00:45:35.666
And next time we're going to
see what difference they make

00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:38.682
within single populations and in
the course of the lifetime of

00:45:38.682 --> 00:45:39.820
single individuals.
 

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.288
This is one way that
microevolution connects to

00:45:43.288 --> 00:45:46.139
macroevolution;
it connects through development.

00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:49.449
Lunch is possible if you would
like it.

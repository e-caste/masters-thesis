00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.865
Okay, what I did last time was
describe to you a certain heat

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:12.941
engine called the Carnot engine.
So, let me refresh your memory

00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:18.564
on what that was.
The whole engine consisted of a

00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:23.890
gas at some pressure and some
volume.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.895
And the gas was subject to a
cycle, and the cycle went like

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.894
this.
You start at some point

00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:36.474
A, you expand at a
certain temperature

00:00:36.474 --> 00:00:40.014
T_1,
isothermally,

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:43.970
until you come to point
B.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.892
So, the way you should imagine
that is that this gas is placed

00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:51.622
on a reservoir whose temperature
is frozen, I mean stuck at

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:54.829
T_1.
Reservoirs never change the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.702
temperature.
And what you do is you lift one

00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:01.364
grain after another of sand,
so you let the gas expand,

00:01:01.364 --> 00:01:05.361
but you don't let it cool down.
The minute it tries to cool

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:09.056
some heat will go from below to
maintain the temperature and

00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:12.000
start at that volume and end at
that volume.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.352
During this process,
some amount of heat

00:01:15.352 --> 00:01:18.620
Q_1 enters the
gas.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.457
Next thing you do,
you let the gas expand some

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:26.549
more, but now you let it expand
adiabatically.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.842
Adiabatic means you put the
whole thing in a heat insulating

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:35.430
material, so no heat can go in
or out.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.560
Now, you can see if it expands,
it's going to have to pay for

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.900
it with its own internal energy,
so the temperature will drop.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.324
So, you wait till it drops to a
lower temperature

00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:48.677
T_2,
then you go backwards like

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:51.115
this;
that's when you start

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:55.989
compressing the gas by putting
some grains of sand back,

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:00.096
but this time the gas is kept
in a lower temperature on top of

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:03.260
a temperature reservoir
T_2,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.639
and you drop more sand on it to
compress it, that is this part.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.227
During this portion,
heat will actually be rejected

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:15.770
by the gas.
Why is heat rejected?

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.010
Because normally,
when you compress a gas,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.633
you're doing work on it,
the energy should go up,

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:23.530
the energy goes up,
the temperature should go up;

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.104
but you're not letting the
temperature go up,

00:02:25.104 --> 00:02:26.535
you're forcing it to have the
temperature

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:29.625
T_2.
So, it will reject heat into

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.775
this heat bath.
And finally,

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:36.106
you come back to the starting
point by further compression,

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:38.943
but adiabatic,
and adiabatic means it's

00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:41.780
insulated from the outside
world;

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.889
no heat flow.
So, there are four parts.

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.633
There are two things you have
to notice about the Carnot

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:51.436
engine.
In fact, let me draw a

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:55.011
schematic of the Carnot engine.
This is the standard way people

00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.312
draw that.
The engine takes some heat

00:02:57.312 --> 00:03:01.099
Q_1 from the
furnace at T_1,

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.720
it has some
Q_2 rejected at

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.828
the exhaust, which is at
T_2 and it

00:03:06.828 --> 00:03:09.509
delivers a certain amount of
work which,

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.366
by the Law of Conservation of
Energy, has to be

00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:12.940
Q_1 -
Q_2.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.233
Do you understand that?
The work done by the gas equal

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.270
to that.
And who paid for it?

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.773
It is the reservoir,
upper reservoir furnished the

00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:27.685
heat, some heat was rejected
downstairs and the difference

00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:29.320
between the two is the work.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.251
Now, we call this a cyclic
process because at the end of

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.949
the day, the gases come back to
where it is.

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.639
That's very important,
if you want to make an engine,

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.901
it's not enough to convert;
the whole purpose of heat

00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:52.060
engines was to burn something
and get some work out of it.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.720
But you don't want it to be a
one shot thing.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.437
You want to be able to do it
over and over and over again and

00:03:56.437 --> 00:03:59.110
you can do that with this engine
because after the cycle,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.722
it's back to where it started
and you can do this any number

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:04.837
of times.
Now, we define an efficiency

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:09.061
for this engine,
which is what you get divided

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:12.978
by what you pay for.
What you get from the engine is

00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:16.383
of course, the work W and
what you pay for is the coal

00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:19.050
that you burn which is
Q_1.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.618
Now, writing W as
Q_1 -

00:04:21.618 --> 00:04:24.431
Q_2 you can write
this as 1 minus

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.550
Q_2 over
Q_1.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.403
This is true for any engine.
Any engine, even if it's not a

00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:34.490
Carnot engine;
with the Law of Conservation of

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.620
Energy you can write something
like this.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.042
Anyway, let me say with the
Carnot engine I got this as the

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:44.935
efficiency.
Now, why is the efficiency not

00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:46.286
100%?
That's because

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.050
Q_2 is not
zero.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.689
You can say why are we building
a stupid engine that rejects

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.018
some heat?
Why not just use all of it in

00:04:54.018 --> 00:04:56.703
some other fashion,
and that's what we're going to

00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:59.195
talk about,
but assuming that the engine

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:01.230
operates between two
temperatures,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.360
the furnace temperature and the
ambient atmospheric temperature,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.158
you can calculate the
efficiency for this engine by

00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:10.620
actually calculating
Q_2 and

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.920
Q_1.
That's a simple problem of

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.940
integrating the work done and
going from here to here.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.229
Do you remember that?
1 - nRT_1

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:28.037
log V_B over
V_A and

00:05:28.037 --> 00:05:32.640
downstairs you have NR
T_2 log

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.009
V_C over
V_D.

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.000
Again, you've got to remember
why that is true.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.002
When you go from A to
B there is no change in

00:05:43.002 --> 00:05:45.589
internal energy because
temperature is the same.

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:47.828
Therefore, the work done and
the heat import are equal

00:05:47.828 --> 00:05:49.812
numerically, so
Q_2 is the work

00:05:49.812 --> 00:05:52.220
done and Q_1 is
the work done there.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.022
So, that's what I got.
Then, I did a little bit of

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:57.993
calculation to show you by using
the fact that B and

00:05:57.993 --> 00:05:59.940
C are on an adiabatic
curve,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.508
A and D are on an
adiabatic curve,

00:06:03.508 --> 00:06:06.089
that these logs actually
cancel,

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:07.960
these guys of course,
cancel to give the final result

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.010
1 minus T_2
over T_1.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.516
That's the bottom line.
I don't care what else you

00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:17.180
remember but this is something I
need for today's discussion.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.700
Efficiency of the Carnot engine
is 1 minus T_2

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.290
over T_1.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.441
Okay now, you can say why I'd
be interested in this very

00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:36.829
primitive engine containing a
cylinder and gas and so on.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:39.380
Okay, this efficiency of this
stupid engine,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.990
I'm sure people can build a
better engine.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.896
So, here is Carnot's claim.
Mr.

00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:55.000
Carnot say,s "No engine can
beat my engine."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.859
Okay that's his claim.
By "beat my engine" he means,

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:02.170
no engine can be more efficient
than my engine.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.360
And he's going to demonstrate
that.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.899
I'm going to demonstrate that
for you.

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:08.600
You don't get something for
nothing.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.684
It's based on the following
postulate, which I told you last

00:07:11.684 --> 00:07:13.420
time.
I'm just now going to write it;

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.101
I will repeat it.
We are going to postulate,

00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:20.414
as the Second Law of
Thermodynamics,

00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:24.389
that it's impossible to find a
process,

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:28.501
the sole result of which is to
transfer some heat from a cold

00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:31.697
body to a hot body.
We all know you can transfer

00:07:31.697 --> 00:07:35.149
heat from a cold body to a hot
body in a refrigerator.

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:37.326
You take heat out of the
freezer and dump it into the

00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:40.269
room;
no one says that's wrong.

00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:42.594
But that's not the sole effect,
because you get an electric

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:44.878
bill at the end of the month,
because there's a compressor

00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:47.449
doing a lot of work.
The claim is--not--no other

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:50.610
agency in the end should be
affected in any fashion.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.910
If at the end of the day all
you had was heat flow up hill.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.915
That's not allowed;
that's a postulate and you have

00:07:56.915 --> 00:07:59.602
to grant him that postulate
which we accept to be

00:07:59.602 --> 00:08:02.798
phenomenologically valid.
But taking that postulate,

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:06.620
Carnot will now show you that
no engine can beat his engine.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.314
The key to the whole Carnot
engine is that it is a

00:08:11.314 --> 00:08:15.875
reversible engine.
By reversible engine I mean on

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:21.079
every step in the Carnot cycle,
let's say going from here to

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:25.859
here, I can also go backwards.
I can put a grain of sand and

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:28.953
compress a piston,
or I can take a grain it'll go

00:08:28.953 --> 00:08:31.582
back to where it was.
You're never far from

00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:34.519
equilibrium and if you can go
one way you can go the other

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:36.403
way.
That also means the Carnot

00:08:36.403 --> 00:08:39.800
engine, starting at the point
A, can go backwards to

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.549
D then C then to
B and then to A.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.493
If the Carnot engine went
backwards it would look like

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:51.510
this: it will take heat
Q_1--I'm sorry

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.710
it will take heat
Q_2,

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.290
somebody will give it work
W and it'll reject

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.309
Q_1 at this
temperature.

00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:07.039
This is the Carnot refrigerator
and that's the Carnot engine.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:09.281
The Carnot engine and the
refrigerator are the same

00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:10.911
machine;
you just can make it run

00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:15.440
one-way or the opposite way.
That's what we're going to use.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.831
So, let me give you a
demonstration that's for--as far

00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:22.158
as I can tell is good enough for
our present purpose,

00:09:22.158 --> 00:09:24.909
that you cannot beat the Carnot
engine.

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:30.003
So, let us say a Carnot engine
takes some heat,

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:35.429
say 100 calories,
delivers 20 calories in work,

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:37.869
rejects 80 calories is
operating between some two

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.699
temperatures
T_1 and

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:41.480
T_2.
This is the Carnot.

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:51.139
I am taking a particular
example where the efficiency is

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:54.408
what, one-fifth.
But don't worry about the fact

00:09:54.408 --> 00:09:56.981
that, yeah, so it's one-fifth,
so one minus

00:09:56.981 --> 00:10:00.350
T_2 over
T_1 should be

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.397
one-fifth.
Now, if you say you have a

00:10:03.397 --> 00:10:07.080
better engine,
you have a better efficiency.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.438
What you really mean is that
your engine can take a 100

00:10:11.438 --> 00:10:15.070
calories and deliver more than
20 calories,

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.515
maybe even deliver 40 calories
and reject only 60 calories,

00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:22.080
but it's also operating between
the same two temperatures.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.735
So, this is your engine.
U for--no,

00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:29.210
Y for your engine,
okay;

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.798
your engine is better than
Carnot's engine,

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:35.374
okay that's your claim.
You're now going to get shot

00:10:35.374 --> 00:10:37.913
down.
So, how am I going to shoot

00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:41.075
this down?
I am going to run the Carnot

00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:46.014
engine backwards first thing,
then I am going to get a Carnot

00:10:46.014 --> 00:10:50.460
engine which is twice as big as
this Carnot engine,

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.792
it's not more efficient,
it has just got twice as much

00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:56.086
gas.
If you take a Carnot engine and

00:10:56.086 --> 00:10:59.300
do the following things,
run it backwards and make it

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.620
twice as big.
What will that Carnot engine do?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.275
It will look like this;
it will take up 160 calories

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:11.835
from downstairs,
it will want 40 calories input

00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:15.800
and it'll dump 200 calories
upstairs.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.331
So, this is a two-times Carnot;
let me put a star saying it's

00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:24.258
Carnot run backwards.
See, it doesn't take any

00:11:24.258 --> 00:11:28.270
special genius to make an engine
bigger.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.820
It won't be more efficient;
it'll have the same efficiency.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.083
But if you can build something
with one piston,

00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:35.888
I can make the same design with
a bigger piston or smaller

00:11:35.888 --> 00:11:38.346
piston.
I'm just saying I want it to be

00:11:38.346 --> 00:11:41.190
twice as big for the following
simple reason.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.280
Your engine's giving out 40
units of work;

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.882
my refrigerator needs 40 to run.
So, what we do is we directly

00:11:49.882 --> 00:11:54.350
take the output from your engine
and feed it to my refrigerator.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.861
Okay, your heat engine makes
work, my refrigerator needs work

00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:05.740
and I've scaled mine so that its
appetite matches your output;

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.485
that's all I've done.
Now, let's draw a box around

00:12:09.485 --> 00:12:14.559
these guys, don't look under the
hood and see what you've got.

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:17.256
At the end of a full cycle,
when everything is done,

00:12:17.256 --> 00:12:18.842
all the gases,
all the pistons,

00:12:18.842 --> 00:12:21.379
everything has come back to
where it starts.

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:27.070
But, no need to plug this
gadget into the wall.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.148
You don't have to plug this
into anything because this

00:12:30.148 --> 00:12:33.342
refrigerator is getting the
power from this heat engine,

00:12:33.342 --> 00:12:35.550
so it doesn't need external
power.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.090
I look at the lower reservoir;
I see 100 calories leaving.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.620
You see that 60 coming down and
160 going up?

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:47.655
I look at the upper reservoir;
I see 200 calories out,

00:12:47.655 --> 00:12:49.975
in and 100 out,
so basically,

00:12:49.975 --> 00:12:53.951
the combined gadgets,
yours and mine are equal to

00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:57.744
this gadget.
It simply transfers heat from a

00:12:57.744 --> 00:13:02.204
cold body to hot body with no
other changes anywhere in the

00:13:02.204 --> 00:13:05.049
universe, and that is not
allowed.

00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:09.471
Therefore, you cannot have an
engine more efficient that the

00:13:09.471 --> 00:13:12.210
Carnot engine.
The logic is pretty simple.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.218
These numbers picked are
representative,

00:13:14.218 --> 00:13:17.359
but you can take any number as
long as your engine does better

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:20.274
than mine,
instead of 40 calories,

00:13:20.274 --> 00:13:23.710
would have made 30 calories
needed.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.006
If it produced 30,
I'll get an engine which is

00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:28.659
one-half times as bigger than
the standard engine;

00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:31.105
run it backwards,
your 30 will feed my engine and

00:13:31.105 --> 00:13:34.316
you will find once again heat is
flowing from a cold body to hot

00:13:34.316 --> 00:13:37.169
body with no other changes
anywhere in the universe,

00:13:37.169 --> 00:13:40.240
that is forbidden by the
postulate.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.778
So, this is how Carnot's
engine, even though it's a very

00:13:44.778 --> 00:13:48.079
primitive engine,
is the standard for all

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:50.261
engines.
No engine can be better than

00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:52.276
the Carnot engine.
Now, the key to the Carnot

00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:54.179
engine is that it's a reversible
engine.

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:57.102
If I had more time I could show
you that all reversible engines

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:59.553
operating between two
temperatures will have the same

00:13:59.553 --> 00:14:01.972
efficiency,
namely that of the Carnot

00:14:01.972 --> 00:14:06.636
engine.
Okay, now what has the Carnot

00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:14.159
engine got to do with what I
started saying earlier?

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:17.127
You remember I started saying
earlier there are certain things

00:14:17.127 --> 00:14:19.950
in our world that seem allowed
but don't seem to happen.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.087
Like you know,
drop an egg it doesn't come

00:14:22.087 --> 00:14:24.661
back in your hand.
You let the weight go down and

00:14:24.661 --> 00:14:26.535
turn the paddle.
The paddle doesn't turn

00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:29.076
backwards and lift the weight.
I said many things are

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:32.149
forbidden and there is a law
that's going to forbid all of

00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:34.090
them, so I am coming to that
law.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.480
But it all started with a
person asking a very practical

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.070
question, "How good can I make
engines?"

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.983
And what Carnot is telling you
is the best efficiency any

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:48.387
engine can have is this.
Therefore, even today hundreds

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:53.129
of years after Carnot,
no company in America or Japan,

00:14:53.129 --> 00:14:56.610
China, anywhere can build an
internal combustion engine for

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.670
example, whose efficiency's
better than this one.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.783
It's a theoretical maximum.
In reality, efficiency will be

00:15:03.783 --> 00:15:07.120
less than this because most
engines have a loss;

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.369
there is heat leaking,
there is friction that's good

00:15:09.369 --> 00:15:11.882
for nothing, so in the end
efficiency will be always lower

00:15:11.882 --> 00:15:14.925
than this.
Okay now, let me leave the

00:15:14.925 --> 00:15:20.617
practical domain and go to more
theoretical issues that follow

00:15:20.617 --> 00:15:23.629
from this.
What I want you to notice if

00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:25.751
the following:
for a Carnot engine

00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:29.351
Q_1 over
Q_2 turned out

00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:33.080
to be T_1 over
T_2.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.373
Right, I did that for you here.
Therefore, I am going to write

00:15:37.373 --> 00:15:40.147
it as follows:
Q_1 over

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:43.774
T_1 minus
Q_2 over

00:15:43.774 --> 00:15:46.620
T_2 equal to
zero.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.581
That's just a simple rewrite.
But I am going to write this in

00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:54.740
another rotation.
My cycle had four parts;

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.713
remember, I did this,
then I did this,

00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:58.580
then I did this,
then I did that.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.266
In this segment I had
Q_1 over

00:16:03.266 --> 00:16:07.098
T_1.
In this segment there was no

00:16:07.098 --> 00:16:09.437
Q_1 or
Q_2,

00:16:09.437 --> 00:16:12.148
there was no Q,
because this is the adiabatic

00:16:12.148 --> 00:16:14.191
process.
In this segment,

00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:17.232
I had minus
Q_2 over

00:16:17.232 --> 00:16:21.878
T_2 and the
last segment I had zero and

00:16:21.878 --> 00:16:25.342
whole thing is zero.
In other words,

00:16:25.342 --> 00:16:28.860
what I'm telling you is the
following.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:34.074
At every stage,
if you looked at the heat

00:16:34.074 --> 00:16:39.809
absorbed by the system,
in stage i,

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:44.254
divided by the temperature of
stage i and you added all

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:48.950
of them you get zero.
My process had four stages.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.923
Stage 1 is here,
stage 2 is adiabatic,

00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:55.539
state 3 is this,
and stage 4 is zero again.

00:16:55.539 --> 00:17:01.277
In this summation
Q_i is defined

00:17:01.277 --> 00:17:08.927
to be ∆Q_i is
the heat input in stage i

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:13.230
in the cycle,
or in the process.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.178
So, we define
Q_2 to be

00:17:16.178 --> 00:17:20.259
positive, even though it was
rejected by the engine,

00:17:20.259 --> 00:17:22.557
but in this summation,
the agreement I make is

00:17:22.557 --> 00:17:25.619
∆Q is positive if the
heat comes into the system,

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.470
∆Q is negative if heat
leaves the system.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:34.595
So, why is that important?
Now, this is the heart of the

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:39.019
whole entropy concept.
Remember I told you there is

00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:42.680
nothing called the heat in a
system.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.770
You cannot look at a gas and
say that's the amount of heat in

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.509
the system.
Why?

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:51.649
Because if you take a point
there and say there's some

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:55.799
amount of heat in the system,
if you go through some kind of

00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:59.372
cycle and come back to the same
point, then since you come back

00:17:59.372 --> 00:18:02.369
to the same point internal
energy doesn't change,

00:18:02.369 --> 00:18:06.423
this is the work done,
therefore, the work done is

00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:09.650
equal to the heat and it is not
zero.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.329
So, in this example what
would've happened is you'd added

00:18:13.329 --> 00:18:17.238
heat Q to the system.
So, if there is some notion of

00:18:17.238 --> 00:18:21.180
how much heat is there in the
beginning, you got that plus the

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.380
Q that you added and yet
you are back to where you are.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.228
Therefore, you cannot define
something and say that's the

00:18:28.228 --> 00:18:31.178
amount of Q in the system
because you're able to add

00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:34.230
Q to the system and bring
it back to where it is.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.969
What happened,
of course, is you added

00:18:35.969 --> 00:18:39.079
Q and you did some work.
But the point is you cannot say

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:41.909
the Q here is so and so.
But you can say the energy here

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:43.818
is so and so.
Because if you come back to the

00:18:43.818 --> 00:18:46.271
same point P times
V is equal to 3 is equal

00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:48.900
to RT and the internal
energy of a gas is proportional

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.650
to the T,
energy returns to the old value.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.660
But now I'm going to tell you
so listen very carefully.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.116
Energy is a state variable
because it comes to the starting

00:19:00.116 --> 00:19:03.420
value, if you come to the
starting point.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.799
It doesn't matter where you
wander off in the PV

00:19:05.799 --> 00:19:07.881
diagram.
Heat is not a state variable,

00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:10.315
there's nothing called a heat
at that point,

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.410
because I am able to go on a
loop,

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.955
change the value of Q or
add some Q to it,

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:18.014
and I come to the same point.
So, there's no unique Q

00:19:18.014 --> 00:19:21.576
associated with that point.
But there is a new unique

00:19:21.576 --> 00:19:24.276
quantity S,
called entropy,

00:19:24.276 --> 00:19:29.105
which has a fixed value at a
given point and if you go for a

00:19:29.105 --> 00:19:34.016
little loop in the PV
diagram and you come to the same

00:19:34.016 --> 00:19:36.838
point,
S will return to the

00:19:36.838 --> 00:19:39.839
starting value.
So, who is this S?

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:45.750
That S is defined by
saying the change in the entropy

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.660
is the heat you add divided by
the temperature.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.922
In a tiny little process,
if you are at some temperature

00:19:53.922 --> 00:19:56.769
T, you add a little
amount of Q,

00:19:56.769 --> 00:20:03.169
keep track of all the changes,
and that change will be zero,

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:07.400
as I showed you in this Carnot
cycle.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.252
You can show more generally
that if you take any path,

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.886
not just the Carnot engine
bounded by adiabatic and

00:20:14.886 --> 00:20:17.781
isothermals,
but any path you take,

00:20:17.781 --> 00:20:21.560
you can show that the
∆Q added up is not

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.404
zero,
but ∆Q/T,

00:20:23.404 --> 00:20:27.387
namely give a weighting factor
of 1/T to the heat you

00:20:27.387 --> 00:20:29.426
add,
then the positives and

00:20:29.426 --> 00:20:32.559
negatives cancel and give you
exactly zero.

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:34.120
In other words,
Q_1 was not

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.971
Q_2,
Q_1 is bigger

00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:38.125
than Q_2,
but Q_1/T

00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:40.691
_1 precisely
balances Q_2/T

00:20:40.691 --> 00:20:43.151
_2.
The heat absorbed at higher

00:20:43.151 --> 00:20:45.691
temperature if divided by
T_1,

00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:47.680
to compute the change in
entropy,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.651
then in the upper part of the
Carnot cycle here,

00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:53.180
and the lower part of the
Carnot here;

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.930
the two cancel as far as the
entropy change is concerned.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.045
So, entropy is a new variable;
it's a mathematically

00:21:01.045 --> 00:21:03.700
discovered variable.
What we find is that if I

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.143
postulate there's a variable
called entropy,

00:21:06.143 --> 00:21:08.772
the change in which,
in any process,

00:21:08.772 --> 00:21:14.150
is the heat transfer divided by
temperature, then that has the

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:19.792
property that when you go around
on a loop you come back net zero

00:21:19.792 --> 00:21:22.273
change.
That means every point can be

00:21:22.273 --> 00:21:24.580
associated with a number you can
call entropy.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.946
Entropy is like a height.
Suppose you are walking around

00:21:27.946 --> 00:21:31.079
on some landscape,
each point is a height.

00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:34.690
You can walk here and there and
come back at every stage;

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.303
you keep track of the change in
height if you come back to where

00:21:37.303 --> 00:21:39.460
you are, the change in height
will add up to zero.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.851
That's what I told you in the
case of a potential energy

00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:45.100
function.
It is just like a potential

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.171
energy function.
Internal energy and the entropy

00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:51.591
are now state variables.
At every point the gas has a

00:21:51.591 --> 00:21:54.079
certain internal energy and an
entropy.

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:56.829
They deserve to be called state
variables because when you go on

00:21:56.829 --> 00:21:59.360
a loop and come back they return
to the starting values.

00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:06.200
Now, you have no idea what this
quantity stands for;

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.460
you agree it's bizarre.
Work done, we understand.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.549
Heat absorbed and heat rejected
we understand.

00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:14.839
What is ∆Q over
T?

00:22:14.839 --> 00:22:18.089
Why is dividing by T
make such a big difference?

00:22:18.089 --> 00:22:19.520
Why does it produce a new
variable?

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.368
We can see it is true;
at least in the Carnot cycle

00:22:22.368 --> 00:22:25.714
you can verify in detail that
the change in the total of all

00:22:25.714 --> 00:22:28.549
the ∆Qs over T
is in fact zero.

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:31.111
So, we'll develop up a feeling
for what it means,

00:22:31.111 --> 00:22:33.299
but historically this is what
happened.

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:36.375
People realized,
hey there's another state

00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:38.562
variable.
We introduce this new variable,

00:22:38.562 --> 00:22:41.110
we have no idea what it means
but it is a state variable so

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.779
we'd better take it very
seriously.

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:45.720
So, I'm going to tell you what
it means.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.074
But first I want you to get
some practice calculating the

00:22:49.074 --> 00:22:51.650
entropy change for a couple of
processes.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.633
So, let us take for example,
one gram of water,

00:22:55.633 --> 00:22:59.529
let's say m grams of
some substance.

00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:03.769
It's got some specific heat
C.

00:23:03.769 --> 00:23:07.906
And I'll change the temperature
say from some T initial

00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:09.670
for some T final.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.905
I do that by keeping the
system--starting the system at

00:23:17.905 --> 00:23:21.401
T_i and I
should never be far from

00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:23.651
equilibrium.
That's one of the conditions on

00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:26.223
this.
In fact, you can say it should

00:23:26.223 --> 00:23:28.890
be near, always near
equilibrium.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.732
So, the system starts at
temperature

00:23:31.732 --> 00:23:35.630
T_i,
I put it on a heat bath,

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.559
which is infinitesimally warmer
than this and I let it heat up

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:41.933
at that point.
Then, I put it on another

00:23:41.933 --> 00:23:44.190
reservoir, slightly hotter than
this one.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:48.609
At all stages I want the system
to be almost near equilibrium.

00:23:48.609 --> 00:23:51.783
In the sense of calculus you
can make the difference as small

00:23:51.783 --> 00:23:54.586
as you like provided you do
enough number of times and

00:23:54.586 --> 00:23:57.019
slowly I raise this guy from
here to here.

00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:59.838
At every stage the system has a
well-defined temperature,

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:02.960
has a well-defined heat input
and I wanted to add it all up.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.799
So, what's the change in
entropy?

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:09.124
S final minus S
initial is equal to dQ

00:24:09.124 --> 00:24:12.329
over T,
summed over all the parts,

00:24:12.329 --> 00:24:18.740
I should write this as an
integral, mC ∆T over T.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.381
Do you see that, dQ is mC ∆T?
But I got to divide by T

00:24:23.381 --> 00:24:26.897
and that integral is done
between some initial and final

00:24:26.897 --> 00:24:30.797
temperature and we can do this
integral rather trivially in an

00:24:30.797 --> 00:24:33.930
mC log T final over
T initial.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.802
That is the increase in entropy
of some m grams of some

00:24:40.802 --> 00:24:43.289
substance of specific heat
C that's heated from

00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:45.119
T initial to T
final.

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:49.049
We're just getting practice
calculating this.

00:24:49.049 --> 00:24:50.910
We still don't know what this
guy means.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.750
So, don't worry about that
right now.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.938
If it did not divide by
T, what are you

00:24:55.938 --> 00:24:58.668
calculating?
mC ∆T integrated is

00:24:58.668 --> 00:25:01.400
just mC times change in
temperature.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.920
That's the old calorimetric
problem you did.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.100
How many calories does it take
to raise the substance from

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.819
initial to final temperature?
That you understand.

00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:13.479
When you divide by T,
something you don't understand,

00:25:13.479 --> 00:25:15.958
but anyway, let's make sure we
know how to calculate the

00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:18.617
increase in entropy when water
or something is heated from a

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:21.829
lower to higher temperature.
If you cooled it from a higher

00:25:21.829 --> 00:25:24.571
to lower temperature,
you can use the same formula

00:25:24.571 --> 00:25:27.369
T_f over
T_i,

00:25:27.369 --> 00:25:28.992
but T_f will
now be smaller than

00:25:28.992 --> 00:25:30.488
T_i;
if you cooled it,

00:25:30.488 --> 00:25:32.815
if the log of a number less
than one is negative and the

00:25:32.815 --> 00:25:34.380
entropy changes it'll be
negative.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.242
So, let me do one more entropy
calculation that's going to be

00:25:39.242 --> 00:25:43.215
pretty important for us.
That entropy calculation is

00:25:43.215 --> 00:25:46.289
this.
Take a gas and watch it expand

00:25:46.289 --> 00:25:51.875
isothermally from some starting
point, at some fixed temperature

00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:55.954
T that goes from
V_1 to

00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:59.961
V_2.
What is the change in entropy

00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:01.840
when it goes from here to here?

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.634
Again, the system must always
be in equilibrium or near

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:13.152
equilibrium so I can plot it as
a point in the PV

00:26:13.152 --> 00:26:15.530
diagram,
so I slowly take grain after

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.212
grain, do the whole thing I told
you, and find S_2 -

00:26:19.212 --> 00:26:22.720
S_1,
this is 2 and this is 1.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.072
That is equal to the sum of all
the heat transfers divided by

00:26:27.072 --> 00:26:30.410
temperature at every little step
of the way.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:38.003
But remember this is also the
same as P∆V over

00:26:38.003 --> 00:26:40.480
T.
Why?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.642
Because on an isothermal
∆U is zero,

00:26:43.642 --> 00:26:47.380
I repeated it many times but
you've got to know this,

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.823
∆Q is P∆V.
But P over T is

00:26:52.823 --> 00:26:57.049
nRT over V,
∆V.

00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:59.980
You also want to divide it by a
T.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:04.590
Do you understand P over
T is nR over

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.585
V?
So, P = nRT over

00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:12.163
V, I'm just saying,
PV is nRT,

00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:17.289
so P over T is
NR over V.

00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:20.821
Now, dV over V
when you sum or integrate will

00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:23.257
give you nR log
V_2 over

00:27:23.257 --> 00:27:24.780
V_1.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.387
That is the change in entropy
of this gas when it went from

00:27:32.387 --> 00:27:35.239
volume V and went to
volume V_2,

00:27:35.239 --> 00:27:39.089
at a given temperature.
You don't have to use calculus

00:27:39.089 --> 00:27:41.448
to do this.
Does everybody understand why

00:27:41.448 --> 00:27:43.349
this could have been done a lot
easier?

00:27:43.349 --> 00:27:46.120
You don't need to do the
integral here.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.899
Because I showed you in
studying the heat engine that

00:27:52.899 --> 00:27:56.712
the heat transfer Q is
nRT log V_2

00:27:56.712 --> 00:28:00.233
over V_1.
Since the whole process takes

00:28:00.233 --> 00:28:03.261
place at fixed temperature,
instead of dividing by T

00:28:03.261 --> 00:28:05.611
at every step,
you can just divide by T

00:28:05.611 --> 00:28:08.789
overall.
Just bring the T here;

00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:12.220
that's why this is a change in
entropy.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.784
In other words,
during the whole process you

00:28:14.784 --> 00:28:18.124
feel at one temperature then
integral of ∆Q over

00:28:18.124 --> 00:28:22.119
T is just 1 over T
times integral of ∆Q,

00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:24.589
which is the total heat
transfer.

00:28:24.589 --> 00:28:28.057
Anyway, this is the heat,
this is the change in entropy,

00:28:28.057 --> 00:28:31.272
S_2 -
S_1 is nR

00:28:31.272 --> 00:28:34.550
log V_2 over
V_1.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.760
Okay, so what have I done so
far?

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:52.031
Let's collect our thoughts here.
I went to the Carnot engine

00:28:52.031 --> 00:28:56.190
today and reminded you what the
efficiency of the Carnot engine

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.958
was.
Then, I showed you no engine

00:28:57.958 --> 00:28:59.720
can be better than the Carnot
engine.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.081
That's a separate story.
That has to do with how

00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:07.114
efficient things can be.
Then, a byproduct of the Carnot

00:29:07.114 --> 00:29:10.779
engine was this great
realization that if you go on a

00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:13.740
closed loop and at every stage
you add,

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.004
you compute the heat absorbed,
but divide by the temperature

00:29:17.004 --> 00:29:20.019
at that point,
the sum of all those is zero.

00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:23.980
What that means is that,
there is a quantity S

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.645
whose change,
if it is defined to be

00:29:26.645 --> 00:29:30.355
∆Q over T,
has a property the total change

00:29:30.355 --> 00:29:32.470
in S is zero and you go
around a loop.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.839
That means at every point you
can associate an S.

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:38.849
S is a property of the
point.

00:29:38.849 --> 00:29:42.118
Another example--so then,
I said let's get used to

00:29:42.118 --> 00:29:45.983
computing change in entropy.
I took one example of heating a

00:29:45.983 --> 00:29:49.169
substance of some mass and
specific heat C by a

00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:52.776
temperature dT and the
change in entropy was mC log

00:29:52.776 --> 00:29:56.054
TF over TI.
You got the log because of

00:29:56.054 --> 00:29:59.299
integral of dT over
T was logarithm.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:03.240
Then, I took an ideal gas,
I let it expand isothermally,

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.680
I found the entropy change,
I got this answer.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.552
By the way, here's an
interesting exercise,

00:30:08.552 --> 00:30:11.050
I don't have time to do it,
but you can ask the following

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.752
question.
If you tell me that every point

00:30:13.752 --> 00:30:17.380
there is a unique entropy,
then the entropy difference

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.145
between 2 and 1 should be
independent of how I go from 1

00:30:21.145 --> 00:30:22.829
to 2.
Do you understand?

00:30:22.829 --> 00:30:24.835
If you're walking on a
mountain, you take two points,

00:30:24.835 --> 00:30:27.417
they have a height difference,
and I can find the height

00:30:27.417 --> 00:30:30.760
difference by going on this path
keeping track of the change in

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.155
height or any other path.
In the end, the height

00:30:33.155 --> 00:30:35.410
difference between two points is
the height difference.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.900
So, I could find the entropy
another way.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.849
Let me show you another way
that's easy for you guys to work

00:30:40.849 --> 00:30:43.400
out.
Come down like this and go to

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.640
the right like this.
And find the entropy change.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.299
You'll get the same answer as I
got on this thing.

00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:54.790
Okay, it's too tempting for me
to just leave it here.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.203
Let me tell you how it works.
Call this intermediate point,

00:30:58.203 --> 00:31:01.539
give a subscript zero for all
its parameters.

00:31:01.539 --> 00:31:05.047
Then in this step,
when you come from here to

00:31:05.047 --> 00:31:09.909
here, the entropy change will
be--let's take one mole of a gas

00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:14.582
when I go from here to here.
Then for one mole of a gas the

00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:18.402
heat transfer dQ is
C_VdT and I

00:31:18.402 --> 00:31:21.514
divide by T and I do the
integral from

00:31:21.514 --> 00:31:25.830
T_1 to this
point T_0.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.159
That's the entropy change here.
Then in the horizontal part,

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:33.073
since I'm going at constant
pressure, I go

00:31:33.073 --> 00:31:35.915
C_PdT over
T from

00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:40.250
T_0 up to back
to T_1,

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.694
because this
T_1 and

00:31:41.694 --> 00:31:43.619
T_2 are the
same temperature.

00:31:43.619 --> 00:31:48.160
I have to add all these to get
the entropy change.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.402
Now it's a two-step process,
you come down because you're at

00:31:51.402 --> 00:31:54.480
constant volume and you're doing
something to the gas,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.740
dQ is
C_VdT.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.815
Horizontally,
you're at constant pressure,

00:31:58.815 --> 00:32:00.740
dQ is
C_PdT.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.030
That's the definition of
specific heat at constant

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.004
volume, constant pressure.
But notice the following:

00:32:06.004 --> 00:32:09.600
C_P is equal
to C_V +

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.245
R.
So, put C_V +

00:32:12.245 --> 00:32:15.439
R here and look what you
get, then you get

00:32:15.439 --> 00:32:19.343
C_V times
log T_0 over

00:32:19.343 --> 00:32:23.317
T_1 plus
log T_1

00:32:23.317 --> 00:32:28.033
over T_0,
which we can write as the

00:32:28.033 --> 00:32:31.167
product here,
plus R log

00:32:31.167 --> 00:32:35.630
T_1 over
T_0.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:39.955
In other words,
this log is log of

00:32:39.955 --> 00:32:41.420
T_0 over
T_1,

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.263
the next log is log of
T_1 over

00:32:44.263 --> 00:32:47.348
T_0,
log A plus log B

00:32:47.348 --> 00:32:50.156
is log of AB.
But when you do this look what

00:32:50.156 --> 00:32:52.941
happens here.
This all cancels,

00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:56.386
log of 1 is zero;
the total entropy change is

00:32:56.386 --> 00:32:58.720
R log T_1 over
T_0.

00:33:02.609 --> 00:33:07.448
But for a gas at constant
pressure, using PV = RT,

00:33:07.448 --> 00:33:12.720
this ratio of temperature is
also the ratio of the volumes.

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:21.859
So this one--I'm sorry I should
write it more carefully.

00:33:21.859 --> 00:33:25.861
When I say T_1
I really meant the temperature

00:33:25.861 --> 00:33:27.829
at this point,
second point.

00:33:27.829 --> 00:33:30.413
So, that temperature,
or this temperature is also

00:33:30.413 --> 00:33:32.620
that volume divided by the
initial volume,

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.442
which is V_1.
See, this is a confusing

00:33:35.442 --> 00:33:37.343
problem because
T_1 happens to

00:33:37.343 --> 00:33:39.784
be T_0.
The correct way to do this for

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:41.770
me would be to write
T_0 over

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.022
T_1 times
T_2 over

00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:46.746
T_0,
then realize the fact that

00:33:46.746 --> 00:33:50.020
T_2 and
T_1 are equal

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.250
because I am on an isotherm.
That's what I should have done.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.554
So, I should cancel this factor
because T_2 is

00:33:55.554 --> 00:33:57.197
T_1,
but here T_2

00:33:57.197 --> 00:33:58.637
over T_0 is
V_2 over

00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:00.170
V_0,
which is V_2

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.226
over V_1.
That's, of course,

00:34:02.226 --> 00:34:05.180
the entropy change I got in one
shot here.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.809
So, you can find entropy change
anyway you like.

00:34:07.809 --> 00:34:09.600
You usually pick the easiest
path.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:18.890
Alright, so we have now learned
how to find entropy change.

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:23.088
We have no idea what it means.
It seems as if when you heat

00:34:23.088 --> 00:34:26.474
something entropy goes up;
when you cool something entropy

00:34:26.474 --> 00:34:28.454
goes down.
That's certainly correct,

00:34:28.454 --> 00:34:31.609
because ∆Q is positive
for heating and you divide by

00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:33.475
T,
and you make it a logarithm,

00:34:33.475 --> 00:34:35.548
but we know at every
infinitesimal portion we're

00:34:35.548 --> 00:34:38.310
adding positive numbers.
And when I cooled things it

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.040
goes down.
Why not just call it

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.909
temperature?
Why do you need this new

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.493
concept called entropy?
So, that's what the rest of the

00:34:44.493 --> 00:34:45.991
lecture is about.
It's a very,

00:34:45.991 --> 00:34:49.179
very powerful and beautiful
concept so I wanted to explain

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:54.374
it, make sure I get it right.
Here is now the result for all

00:34:54.374 --> 00:34:58.493
this hard work.
Remember I told you there are

00:34:58.493 --> 00:35:03.340
many, many, many phenomena that
seem forbidden in our world,

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.335
and we're not quite sure what
law to invoke to prevent all of

00:35:07.335 --> 00:35:10.346
them from happening.
Do we want a law for each one

00:35:10.346 --> 00:35:13.493
that says if you drop a bottle
and it shatters it won't come

00:35:13.493 --> 00:35:14.985
back?
If you drop an egg it won't

00:35:14.985 --> 00:35:17.650
come back.
If you let hot and cold mix,

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:21.822
they're not going to unmix.
Or if you let a gas trapped in

00:35:21.822 --> 00:35:25.901
half a room, escape to the whole
room, it'll never untrap and go

00:35:25.901 --> 00:35:28.865
back to half the room.
A lot of things happen one way

00:35:28.865 --> 00:35:31.556
but not the other and I said I
am looking for a mega law that

00:35:31.556 --> 00:35:33.710
will prevent all these things
from happening.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.409
Now, I'm ready to state that
law.

00:35:36.409 --> 00:35:39.934
This is the third law--I mean,
the Second Law of

00:35:39.934 --> 00:35:42.321
Thermodynamics.
Carnot said it one way,

00:35:42.321 --> 00:35:44.446
but I'm going to say it in a
way that's very,

00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:47.194
very general.
The Second Law of

00:35:47.194 --> 00:35:54.397
Thermodynamics says ∆S
for the universe is either zero

00:35:54.397 --> 00:35:57.305
or positive.
There you have it,

00:35:57.305 --> 00:36:00.035
that's the great law.
The law says,

00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:04.555
take any process,
if at the end of the process

00:36:04.555 --> 00:36:10.180
the entropy of the universe is
bigger than it was before,

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.212
that will happen.
If the entropy of the universe

00:36:14.212 --> 00:36:17.309
is smaller than it was before,
it will not happen.

00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:20.997
Now, we have to make sure that
this law has anything whatsoever

00:36:20.997 --> 00:36:24.684
to do with all the other things
we have studied and I will show

00:36:24.684 --> 00:36:26.326
you;
this will forbid everything

00:36:26.326 --> 00:36:28.874
that should be forbidden and
allow everything that should be

00:36:28.874 --> 00:36:32.555
allowed.
So, let me start with the most

00:36:32.555 --> 00:36:34.985
obvious formulation.
Mr.

00:36:34.985 --> 00:36:38.703
Carnot's version of the Second
Law was that you cannot have a

00:36:38.703 --> 00:36:42.296
process in which some heat
Q goes from a hot body to

00:36:42.296 --> 00:36:45.694
a cold body.
I'm sorry this allowed,

00:36:45.694 --> 00:36:50.690
right, according to Carnot,
this is not allowed.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.059
Right, heat can flow downhill,
cannot flow up hill.

00:36:59.059 --> 00:37:03.050
Let's see the entropy change
the universe with the two cases.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.505
In this case,
with this guy,

00:37:05.505 --> 00:37:10.781
the change in entropy is the
following: the upper reservoir

00:37:10.781 --> 00:37:15.175
lost some amount Q,
so ∆Q is a negative

00:37:15.175 --> 00:37:18.210
number, add some temperature
T_1,

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:22.592
the lower reservoir gained
Q at temperature

00:37:22.592 --> 00:37:26.308
T_2.
Now, what's the overall sign of

00:37:26.308 --> 00:37:27.860
this?
Think about it.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.245
T_1 is bigger
than T_2,

00:37:30.245 --> 00:37:32.461
so this negative number is
smaller than this positive

00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:34.400
number,
so the whole thing is positive.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.079
That means it's allowed;
it's okay.

00:37:39.079 --> 00:37:41.790
By the same token,
if you take this process when

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.615
heat flows up hill,
then this reservoir loses some

00:37:44.615 --> 00:37:47.730
heat Q at temperature
T_2,

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.517
the other one gains heat
Q at temperature

00:37:50.517 --> 00:37:53.482
T_1,
but this is clearly less than

00:37:53.482 --> 00:37:56.625
zero because this positive
number is smaller than this

00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:59.476
negative number.
So, there you have a very

00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:02.446
simple example where if heat
flows the wrong way,

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:04.860
the entropy of the universe
goes up.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.607
And it's very simple,
it's only--it's because,

00:38:11.607 --> 00:38:15.288
it's true that the heat loss of
this guy is the heat gain of

00:38:15.288 --> 00:38:16.925
that guy,
that's the Law of the

00:38:16.925 --> 00:38:19.240
Conservation of Energy.
So, energy doesn't change,

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.770
but entropy changes,
because for entropy it's not

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.405
the heat transferred,
it's heat transferred divided

00:38:24.405 --> 00:38:27.252
by temperature.
Therefore, a heat loss at one

00:38:27.252 --> 00:38:30.034
temperature and a [equal]
heat gain at a lower

00:38:30.034 --> 00:38:33.309
temperature don't cancel when it
comes to entropy.

00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:35.449
In one case the entropy goes up
and is allowed;

00:38:35.449 --> 00:38:37.270
other case entropy goes down,
that's not allowed.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.735
Okay so let's try,
that's certainly one process

00:38:43.735 --> 00:38:47.459
that you know should not be
allowed, but it's forbidden by

00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:50.530
the Third Law,
by a computation of entropy.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.924
So, the reason when you put a
hot and cold body together,

00:38:53.924 --> 00:38:57.621
heat flows from the cold to the
hot--I'm sorry from the hot to

00:38:57.621 --> 00:38:59.362
the cold,
is because that's the way the

00:38:59.362 --> 00:39:00.020
entropy will go up.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:12.246
So, let's take one more example.
Suppose I have some mass of

00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:16.379
water at some temperature
T_1 and an

00:39:16.379 --> 00:39:19.003
equal mass of water at
temperature

00:39:19.003 --> 00:39:24.900
T_2.
One is hot and one is cold.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:29.920
I put them together,
what will happen?

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.648
We believe it will then get
this big mass,

00:39:32.648 --> 00:39:36.108
all at some common temperature
T star which is

00:39:36.108 --> 00:39:38.970
T_1 +
T_2/2;

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:41.484
this is just by symmetry.
It's equal mass,

00:39:41.484 --> 00:39:43.860
equal specific heat,
where will they meet?

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.079
They will meet half way.
They will meet here.

00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:49.776
Energies, of course,
is conserved,

00:39:49.776 --> 00:39:52.810
and that's how we determine in
fact where they will meet.

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:56.249
But look at the entropy.
What happens with entropy

00:39:56.249 --> 00:39:58.256
change?
With entropy change,

00:39:58.256 --> 00:40:02.486
you should imagine this water
being steadily heated by putting

00:40:02.486 --> 00:40:05.329
it in contact with a lot of
reservoir,

00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:08.487
so it's never far from
equilibrium and slowly bringing

00:40:08.487 --> 00:40:12.221
it to this point.
Then, the ∆S total

00:40:12.221 --> 00:40:17.712
will be M specific heat
is 1, then ∆T over

00:40:17.712 --> 00:40:22.914
T starting from
T_1 to T

00:40:22.914 --> 00:40:27.730
star for one thing and dT
over T from

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:33.800
T_2 to T
star for the other one.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.635
Do you understand that?
They both meet at T

00:40:35.635 --> 00:40:37.254
star, upper limit is T
star, lower one is

00:40:37.254 --> 00:40:39.321
T_1 for one and
T_2 for the

00:40:39.321 --> 00:40:41.717
other,
so the change in entropy

00:40:41.717 --> 00:40:45.585
becomes M log T
star squared over

00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:48.780
T_1T
_2.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.087
Now, we have to ask,
okay you got an entropy change

00:40:56.087 --> 00:40:57.470
from start to finish,
but how do you know it's

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.870
positive?

00:41:02.239 --> 00:41:04.802
Can anybody give some reason
why this has to be a positive

00:41:04.802 --> 00:41:07.410
without looking into properties
of logarithms and so on?

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.619
Any of these in, what--yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:19.797
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah,

00:41:19.797 --> 00:41:23.814
that's one way to prove that.
But I am saying,

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.460
I'm going to prove it to you
that way.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.718
But can you think of a reason
why at every step of the

00:41:28.718 --> 00:41:32.530
process, when I brought this
down and when I pushed that up,

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:35.550
the entropy change is always
positive in each step.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.855
So, let me explain why.
Imagine cooling this down a

00:41:38.855 --> 00:41:42.246
little bit, by putting,
taking some heat ∆Q

00:41:42.246 --> 00:41:45.261
out of this guy.
That's happening at some

00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:48.252
temperature here,
this one is gaining some

00:41:48.252 --> 00:41:51.390
∆Q, but at a lower
temperature.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:55.572
Okay.
Therefore, the gain has got the

00:41:55.572 --> 00:41:58.656
same ∆Q,
but at a lower temperature,

00:41:58.656 --> 00:42:01.599
this is always at an upper
temperature.

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.806
Throughout the process,
at every stage,

00:42:03.806 --> 00:42:05.780
this guy's hotter than this
guy.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.934
So, every calorie of heat it
gains at a higher temperature,

00:42:08.934 --> 00:42:12.090
every calorie it loses is
divided by higher temperature,

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.429
every calorie this gained is
divided by lower temperature.

00:42:14.429 --> 00:42:17.636
At every increment,
at every infinitesimal step you

00:42:17.636 --> 00:42:20.650
can see the total entropy change
is positive.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:24.599
Now, to prove it,
we will do what he just said.

00:42:24.599 --> 00:42:27.410
If you want to prove this is
positive, you want to show that

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.840
the fellow inside the logarithm
is bigger than 1,

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.814
so I'm asking is
T_1 plus

00:42:32.814 --> 00:42:37.166
T_2^(2) over 4
bigger than T_1T

00:42:37.166 --> 00:42:39.291
_2?
Or I'm saying is

00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:41.396
T_1 plus
T_2^(2) bigger

00:42:41.396 --> 00:42:43.050
than 4T_1T
_2?

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.577
If you rearrange this,
you can show the left-hand side

00:42:45.577 --> 00:42:48.010
becomes T_1 -
T_2^(2);

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.524
that's of course,
a positive number because this

00:42:50.524 --> 00:42:53.360
will be T_1^(2) +
T_2^(2) +

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.500
2T_1T
_2.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.163
When I bring this guy to the
other side, it'll become minus

00:42:58.163 --> 00:43:00.275
2T_1T
_2 and so it's

00:43:00.275 --> 00:43:04.264
clearly positive.
So, when hot and cold meet and

00:43:04.264 --> 00:43:08.600
create lukewarm,
entropy of the universe has

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.098
gone up.
It follows, therefore,

00:43:11.098 --> 00:43:14.442
if lukewarm spontaneously
separated into hot and cold,

00:43:14.442 --> 00:43:18.480
the entropy would go down and
that's why that doesn't happen.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.202
That's why if you leave a jar
of water at one temperature,

00:43:21.202 --> 00:43:23.637
it doesn't spontaneously
separate into a part on top

00:43:23.637 --> 00:43:25.500
which is cold and a part on
bottom,

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.867
which is hot.
Such a separation would not

00:43:27.867 --> 00:43:30.775
violate anything.
It would not violate the Law of

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:33.993
Conservation of Energy,
but it will violate the law

00:43:33.993 --> 00:43:36.309
that entropy has to always go
up.

00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:38.840
So, one way is allowed another
way is not allowed.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.800
So, you see over and over
again, that anything that's

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.760
allowed is in the direction of
increasing entropy;

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.966
anything that is forbidden is
in the direction of decreasing

00:43:47.966 --> 00:43:51.510
entropy.
But who is this entropy?

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.806
What does it mean?
Well, that we have not

00:43:53.806 --> 00:43:56.230
understood at all from any of
these calculations.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.374
Because dQ over T
doesn't speak to us the way

00:43:59.374 --> 00:44:01.760
dU or dQ or
PdV does.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:07.491
So, that last part of what I'm
going to do is going to explain

00:44:07.491 --> 00:44:12.190
to you what is the microscopic
basis of entropy.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.465
Why is the entropy going up?
Why is--why do we understand

00:44:16.465 --> 00:44:21.969
the tendency of things to go the
direction of increasing entropy?

00:44:21.969 --> 00:44:25.759
All I've shown you now is that
it's a mystical quantity called

00:44:25.759 --> 00:44:29.300
entropy, circumstantially you
find every time something is

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.882
forbidden,
it's because had it taken place

00:44:31.882 --> 00:44:34.929
entropy would have gone down.
Do you remember the examples?

00:44:34.929 --> 00:44:38.088
Heat flowing from hot to cold
entropy goes up,

00:44:38.088 --> 00:44:40.395
allowed.
Flowing from cold to hot,

00:44:40.395 --> 00:44:42.449
entropy goes down,
not allowed.

00:44:42.449 --> 00:44:45.190
Hot and cold mix and become
lukewarm;

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.982
allowed, entropy goes up.
Luke warm separates into hot

00:44:48.982 --> 00:44:51.630
and cold;
not allowed, entropy goes down.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.489
So, there's definitely a
correlation.

00:44:53.489 --> 00:44:55.730
And yet we don't know what it
means.

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.800
So, we're going to talk about
what it means.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.389
For that, I'm going to consider
the following process.

00:45:01.389 --> 00:45:08.703
I take a gas and I put it in a
room in a box where there's a

00:45:08.703 --> 00:45:13.394
partition, half way.
The molecules are stuck on the

00:45:13.394 --> 00:45:17.060
left side, gas has reached
equilibrium and it's done what

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.400
it can, which is to spread out
over this volume.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.370
Now, I suddenly remove the
partition, rip it out.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:32.640
So, let's follow this gas.
Initially, it is a point here.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:40.867
Then, there is a period when it
goes off the radar because I

00:45:40.867 --> 00:45:43.499
told you when you suddenly
remove the wall,

00:45:43.499 --> 00:45:46.320
the gas is not in a state of
equilibrium.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.099
It doesn't even have a
well-defined pressure.

00:45:48.099 --> 00:45:50.655
The minute you remove the wall,
pressure is something here,

00:45:50.655 --> 00:45:54.335
pressure is zero in the vacuum.
So, you got to wait a bit,

00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:58.304
so gas has gone off the radar.
We cannot talk about what's

00:45:58.304 --> 00:46:00.857
happening.
Then, if you wait long enough,

00:46:00.857 --> 00:46:04.287
I get a gas that looks like
this after some seconds,

00:46:04.287 --> 00:46:07.557
or whatever milliseconds.
That is again gas in

00:46:07.557 --> 00:46:10.210
equilibrium.
It's got a certain state;

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:16.820
I can call it 2.
What is the entropy change now?

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.865
That's what I want to ask.
What's the change in entropy

00:46:20.865 --> 00:46:23.861
here?
Because I know that this is

00:46:23.861 --> 00:46:28.870
allowed, that is forbidden,
so I want to ask did the

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.687
entropy go up?
Now, how do we do the entropy

00:46:32.687 --> 00:46:35.024
calculation?
Here's the wrong way to do the

00:46:35.024 --> 00:46:37.570
calculation.
You go back and say ∆S

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:41.284
at ∆Q over T,
but this whole box I forgot to

00:46:41.284 --> 00:46:44.178
mention--I'm sorry,
this whole box is thermally

00:46:44.178 --> 00:46:46.725
isolated.
It's not in contact with

00:46:46.725 --> 00:46:49.987
anything.
I just ripped out the partition

00:46:49.987 --> 00:46:52.309
in the middle;
that's it.

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:54.981
So, you might say,
well, if it's thermally

00:46:54.981 --> 00:46:58.760
isolated, ∆Q = 0 so you
can divide by T,

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.630
you can do what you want,
so this entropy change is zero.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:03.090
But that is a wrong argument.

00:47:06.099 --> 00:47:08.902
Can you think about why that's
not the way to do the entropy

00:47:08.902 --> 00:47:11.040
change?
Why that's the wrong analysis?

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.560
First of all,
could that be the right answer?

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.246
Yes.
Student: It can't

00:47:21.246 --> 00:47:25.347
because then that would mean
that going backwards is not a

00:47:25.347 --> 00:47:27.265
valid process.
Professor Ramamurti

00:47:27.265 --> 00:47:28.276
Shankar: No,
that is correct,

00:47:28.276 --> 00:47:29.730
but I'm saying this computation
of entropy.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:33.382
The one line calculation I did,
namely there is no heat inflow,

00:47:33.382 --> 00:47:36.209
the ∆Q = 0,
so ∆Q over T

00:47:36.209 --> 00:47:38.647
summed up is also zero.
That's not how you do the

00:47:38.647 --> 00:47:39.190
entropy change.

00:47:42.789 --> 00:47:45.030
Is there any condition I made
on computing?

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.144
Yes.
Student: Well,

00:47:47.144 --> 00:47:49.142
uhm… there's a gas
[inaudible]

00:47:49.142 --> 00:47:52.237
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Wait in fact,

00:47:52.237 --> 00:47:55.706
here's the interesting thing.
What's going to be the

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:58.550
temperature difference between
before and after?

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:00.410
Which is going to be hotter or
cooler?

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:09.059
Any views on this?
Yep.

00:48:09.059 --> 00:48:12.572
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:48:12.572 --> 00:48:15.869
Shankar: Ah,
well, you can say it is cooler

00:48:15.869 --> 00:48:18.880
because it was insulated and
expanded,

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.782
but you cool down because you
expand against an external

00:48:22.782 --> 00:48:25.516
pressure, right?
If, when--If I were to move

00:48:25.516 --> 00:48:27.943
this piston here,
there is no pressure pushing

00:48:27.943 --> 00:48:30.150
this gas back.
Do you understand that?

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:33.920
Doesn't do any work,
doesn't take any heat.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.426
So, what does that mean?
In the end when you settle

00:48:37.426 --> 00:48:40.433
down, what can you conclude?
No heat input,

00:48:40.433 --> 00:48:43.901
no work done,
so what does that mean in terms

00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:46.449
of temperature?
Student: Same.

00:48:46.449 --> 00:48:48.449
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Same.

00:48:48.449 --> 00:48:50.545
Because the internal energy
cannot change because

00:48:50.545 --> 00:48:52.160
∆Q = 0,
work done is zero.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:56.153
So, in fact, this is a surprise.
This gas when it expands will

00:48:56.153 --> 00:48:59.195
be at the same temperature.
You guys are thinking of the

00:48:59.195 --> 00:49:01.348
computer air,
where if you let it expand it

00:49:01.348 --> 00:49:03.757
cools down because that is
expanding against the

00:49:03.757 --> 00:49:06.863
atmospheric pressure.
This gas is expanding into a

00:49:06.863 --> 00:49:09.209
complete vacuum.
It's got no piston to push

00:49:09.209 --> 00:49:12.188
against, nothing from outside
pushing, so these two points are

00:49:12.188 --> 00:49:13.360
the same temperature.

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:19.152
So, the correct answer,
maybe you didn't catch on,

00:49:19.152 --> 00:49:22.268
but I will tell you the correct
answer is: There is an entropy

00:49:22.268 --> 00:49:25.265
increase in this problem,
because the final state

00:49:25.265 --> 00:49:29.019
definitely has a well-defined
entropy you can calculate,

00:49:29.019 --> 00:49:30.639
because it's an equilibrium
state.

00:49:30.639 --> 00:49:34.036
Initial one has a well-defined
entropy, in between stages here,

00:49:34.036 --> 00:49:36.940
are not on the PV
diagram because they were not

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.486
equilibrium states.
So in this experiment,

00:49:39.486 --> 00:49:42.467
the way to calculate the
entropy change is not to do

00:49:42.467 --> 00:49:46.150
∆Q over T as it
happened in this experiment.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:49.405
What you really want to say is
my gas was here in the

00:49:49.405 --> 00:49:51.909
beginning, my gas is there in
the end,

00:49:51.909 --> 00:49:54.447
both are states of equilibrium,
both have well-defined

00:49:54.447 --> 00:49:57.224
temperature and I can find the
entropy change in going from

00:49:57.224 --> 00:49:59.139
here to here for any process I
want.

00:49:59.139 --> 00:50:02.993
As long as that process keeps
the system near equilibrium,

00:50:02.993 --> 00:50:06.644
so I can follow dot by dot
where I'm moving and add the

00:50:06.644 --> 00:50:10.514
∆Q over Ts.
The correct rule for entropy

00:50:10.514 --> 00:50:14.379
change is ∆Q/T computed
on a path in which the system

00:50:14.379 --> 00:50:18.268
never strays from equilibrium.
Now, your system strayed from

00:50:18.268 --> 00:50:21.245
equilibrium all the time.
But we're not interested in how

00:50:21.245 --> 00:50:23.670
it got from here to here.
We are saying what's the

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.909
entropy here and what's the
entropy here.

00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:28.682
Since this at the same
temperature, I know one way to

00:50:28.682 --> 00:50:31.614
go from there to there is to
follow the isotherm because

00:50:31.614 --> 00:50:34.920
that'll connect the two points
in this particular problem.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:38.402
Then I know the entropy change
is S_2 -

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:41.952
S_1 is nR log
V_2 over

00:50:41.952 --> 00:50:43.660
V_1.

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.960
So, here is the subtle point I
want to explain to you.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.235
This is worth understanding.
A lot of people do all the

00:51:00.235 --> 00:51:02.879
problems and get everything
right, but don't appreciate this

00:51:02.879 --> 00:51:05.897
particular question.
The free expansion of a gas

00:51:05.897 --> 00:51:10.313
into a vacuum takes it from one
equilibrium state called 1 to

00:51:10.313 --> 00:51:13.110
another equilibrium state called
2.

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:16.445
In the actual expansion,
the system went through a stage

00:51:16.445 --> 00:51:19.719
which cannot be even shown in
the PV diagram,

00:51:19.719 --> 00:51:22.064
they were not equilibrium
states, they didn't have well

00:51:22.064 --> 00:51:23.845
defined pressure,
didn't have well defined

00:51:23.845 --> 00:51:25.903
temperature.
How do you find a temperature

00:51:25.903 --> 00:51:27.964
when half the box is empty?
Doesn't have it,

00:51:27.964 --> 00:51:30.150
you cannot it T
temperature of the gas.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.280
So, what do you mean by
∆Q over T,

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.519
there is no T.
Only when it settles down,

00:51:34.519 --> 00:51:37.310
there is a T.
Every settled down equilibrium

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:40.520
state is a well-defined entropy.
What we're trying to do is to

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.226
compute that difference.
The way to compute the

00:51:43.226 --> 00:51:47.317
difference is to forget about
what actually happened and

00:51:47.317 --> 00:51:52.778
instead do the following.
Take the gas like that and turn

00:51:52.778 --> 00:51:56.265
it this way, [90 degree
rotation]

00:51:56.265 --> 00:51:59.434
if you like.
Just for convenience,

00:51:59.434 --> 00:52:02.284
put a piston there at the
halfway point,

00:52:02.284 --> 00:52:06.815
put some weights on it so that
the pressure equals the pressure

00:52:06.815 --> 00:52:10.250
inside and slowly remove little
by little,

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:13.183
and keeping it on a reservoir a
temperature

00:52:13.183 --> 00:52:16.347
T_1.
Which is the temperature at

00:52:16.347 --> 00:52:19.117
which all of this happens,
or at some temperature

00:52:19.117 --> 00:52:21.993
T.
As you remove the grain of

00:52:21.993 --> 00:52:25.856
sand, what happens is the gas
gets some energy,

00:52:25.856 --> 00:52:30.560
that's the ∆Q over
T, the reservoir loses

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.800
some heat;
in fact, the reservoir loses

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.052
the same amount of heat
∆Q at the same

00:52:37.052 --> 00:52:40.565
temperature T.
So in fact, what happens in

00:52:40.565 --> 00:52:44.870
this process is entropy of the
universe does not change at all.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:48.932
The entropy gain of the gas;
this is an entropy loss of the

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:51.699
reservoir.
But I used this as a device for

00:52:51.699 --> 00:52:55.440
finding the entropy gain of the
gas in the other process.

00:53:00.679 --> 00:53:06.222
So, this is the part that is
absolutely central to this whole

00:53:06.222 --> 00:53:09.639
argument how entropy is
calculated.

00:53:09.639 --> 00:53:13.165
In a real spontaneous expansion
of a gas, where there was no

00:53:13.165 --> 00:53:16.320
reservoir, no nothing,
we just broke the partition and

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.540
expanded, there is a change in
entropy.

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.929
That's an irreversible process.
But to find the change in

00:53:22.929 --> 00:53:26.690
entropy in this problem,
since 1 and 2 have well-defined

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:29.710
entropies,
we can find the change between

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:33.757
1 and 2 by going to a different
experiment in which it was

00:53:33.757 --> 00:53:36.749
brought from 1 to 2,
not in this crazy irreversible

00:53:36.749 --> 00:53:39.196
way, but by putting it in
contact with the heat bath at

00:53:39.196 --> 00:53:42.013
that temperature T,
removing grain after grain,

00:53:42.013 --> 00:53:45.074
never straying far from
equilibrium, that's when we find

00:53:45.074 --> 00:53:47.671
this change.
So, you replace the dotted

00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:51.804
line, where you cannot compute
anything, by a solid line where

00:53:51.804 --> 00:53:54.211
you can.
But since the change in entropy

00:53:54.211 --> 00:53:56.944
between 1 and 2 doesn't depend
on how you got there,

00:53:56.944 --> 00:53:59.123
that's the answer.
But this process,

00:53:59.123 --> 00:54:02.842
where you can actually see it
is the one in which ∆S

00:54:02.842 --> 00:54:05.260
of the universe is actually at
zero.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.573
Why?
Because you are putting in

00:54:07.573 --> 00:54:10.320
contact with the reservoir at
the same temperature,

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.698
so ∆Q over T
for the gas and ∆Q over

00:54:13.698 --> 00:54:16.851
T for the reservoir
exactly cancel because they're

00:54:16.851 --> 00:54:19.948
at the same temperature and
∆Q for one is minus

00:54:19.948 --> 00:54:24.972
∆Q for the other.
So, don't confuse the two

00:54:24.972 --> 00:54:28.077
processes.
One is a reversible process in

00:54:28.077 --> 00:54:31.678
which a gas is slowly allowed to
expand from the initial state of

00:54:31.678 --> 00:54:34.604
the final stage by removing
grain after grain of some

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:38.205
externally applied pressure in a
process where the entropy of the

00:54:38.205 --> 00:54:41.672
universe doesn't change,
gas and reservoir change by

00:54:41.672 --> 00:54:44.022
equal amounts.
But the punch line is I don't

00:54:44.022 --> 00:54:46.999
care what happens in reservoir,
I want to know how much the gas

00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:49.132
gained,
because that is the gain I need

00:54:49.132 --> 00:54:51.903
to find S_2 -
S_1 for this

00:54:51.903 --> 00:54:54.837
process.
So, this is how we always find

00:54:54.837 --> 00:54:57.822
entropy change.
In real life processes happen

00:54:57.822 --> 00:55:00.869
in a way in which entropy of the
universe goes up.

00:55:00.869 --> 00:55:03.864
Because take this box,
in the real experiment,

00:55:03.864 --> 00:55:07.989
remember there is no reservoir,
there's only the box of gas.

00:55:07.989 --> 00:55:09.827
It expanded,
its entropy went up,

00:55:09.827 --> 00:55:12.470
so entropy of the universe
actually went up.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:18.391
That's why it's allowed.
The entropy of the universe

00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:22.436
went up by an amount equal to
the increase in entropy of the

00:55:22.436 --> 00:55:26.545
gas when it goes from 1 to 2.
To find the increase in entropy

00:55:26.545 --> 00:55:30.314
of the gas when it goes from 1
to 2, I create a second process

00:55:30.314 --> 00:55:33.651
in which I can compute the
change by letting it go in a

00:55:33.651 --> 00:55:37.050
sequence of connected dots and
finding the change.

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:40.840
So, the way you use to find the
change in entropy is not the way

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.090
the entropy increase took place
in the real process.

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:46.245
So, I don't think I want to
repeat it anymore,

00:55:46.245 --> 00:55:49.118
but it's an important point and
you should really think about

00:55:49.118 --> 00:55:53.034
that.
Alright, now the last point is,

00:55:53.034 --> 00:55:59.778
what does--Let's analyze this
final formula I got for entropy

00:55:59.778 --> 00:56:04.050
change for free expansion of a
gas.

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:12.614
Let's take a simple case where
the gas expanded from some

00:56:12.614 --> 00:56:16.539
volume V to volume 2
times V.

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:19.530
What is S_2 -
S_1?

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:25.041
S_2 -
S_1 = nR

00:56:25.041 --> 00:56:27.601
log 2.
2 happens to be

00:56:27.601 --> 00:56:30.120
V_2/V
_1;

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:34.781
the volume is doubled.
Let me re-write this as Nk

00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:40.930
log 2, because the number of
moles times R is the

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:44.889
number of molecules times
k.

00:56:44.889 --> 00:56:49.626
Let me re-write that as log of
2 to the N times

00:56:49.626 --> 00:56:50.610
k.

00:56:55.679 --> 00:57:02.400
Now, I will tell you what all
these factors mean and that

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.432
comes from the following.
Thermodynamics only told you

00:57:07.432 --> 00:57:10.634
the formula for the change in
the entropy of a gas,

00:57:10.634 --> 00:57:13.579
didn't tell you what the
entropy itself is.

00:57:13.579 --> 00:57:17.524
So, the formula for the entropy
of a gas, without talking about

00:57:17.524 --> 00:57:21.532
the change and also this formula
∆S is ∆Q over

00:57:21.532 --> 00:57:23.699
T,
doesn't even believe in atoms.

00:57:23.699 --> 00:57:25.363
You don't need atoms,
you don't need molecules,

00:57:25.363 --> 00:57:27.280
you don't need to know what
anything is made up of.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.760
In fact, it was discovered long
before atoms were proven to

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.948
exist.
Boltzmann is the guy who gave

00:57:33.948 --> 00:57:39.924
the formula for what the entropy
of a gas is in terms of what the

00:57:39.924 --> 00:57:44.939
individual molecules are doing.
That's the punch line of what's

00:57:44.939 --> 00:57:48.498
called statistical mechanics,
which gives you the microscopic

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:51.743
origin of thermodynamics.
Thermodynamics to this stage

00:57:51.743 --> 00:57:55.363
talk about fluids and solids and
gases and nothing there requires

00:57:55.363 --> 00:57:57.570
that everything be made up of
atoms,

00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:59.250
you don't have to know what
it's made of.

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:02.789
But if you tell me it's made up
of atoms, you have a better idea

00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:05.935
of what entropy means and here
is Boltzmann's formula for

00:58:05.935 --> 00:58:08.610
entropy.
I am going to write it down.

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:14.739
Boltzmann constant times log
Ω.

00:58:14.739 --> 00:58:16.769
I'll tell you what omega is in
a minute.

00:58:16.769 --> 00:58:20.401
This is such an important
formula it is written in

00:58:20.401 --> 00:58:23.436
Boltzmann's tombstone.
So, when physicists go to

00:58:23.436 --> 00:58:26.050
Vienna, we skip the orchestras
and everything else,

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:29.970
we go to Boltzmann's tomb and
we read this formula once more

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:33.161
with some passion.
That's a summary of a lifetime

00:58:33.161 --> 00:58:35.007
of work.
But it's a great formula and

00:58:35.007 --> 00:58:37.675
you will understand once you
know the formula what all this

00:58:37.675 --> 00:58:41.162
means.
So, let me tell you what omega

00:58:41.162 --> 00:58:42.876
means.
I am going to say it in words

00:58:42.876 --> 00:58:44.559
and then I am going to apply it
to this problem.

00:58:44.559 --> 00:58:47.822
If you took any gas,
let it be under certain

00:58:47.822 --> 00:58:52.146
conditions that macroscopically
has some pressure and some

00:58:52.146 --> 00:58:56.570
volume and so on.
So, here is the gas at one

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:58.829
instant;
now we believe in atoms,

00:58:58.829 --> 00:59:01.550
here are these atoms scattered
all over the place.

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:11.420
Suppose I wait a little bit,
what did the gas look like?

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.970
It looks like that.
If you can see every atom,

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:18.449
the atomic configuration has
changed.

00:59:18.449 --> 00:59:21.730
But macroscopically nothing has
changed.

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:24.742
Instead of atom A being
here, maybe A has gone

00:59:24.742 --> 00:59:26.530
there and B has come
here.

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:28.815
In particular,
if you divide the volume into

00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:31.420
some number of little cells that
you can count,

00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:35.255
on the average the gas' uniform
density, there are some number

00:59:35.255 --> 00:59:38.210
of atoms, per every little cube
you can form,

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:42.030
a little later I move on and
somebody else moves in.

00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:44.130
Macroscopically,
it looks the same to me.

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:46.010
Microscopically,
stuff is going on.

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:51.099
Omega is the number of
different microscopic

00:59:51.099 --> 00:59:58.199
arrangements that agree with
what is seen macroscopically.

00:59:58.199 --> 01:00:00.238
When I say microscopic
arrangements,

01:00:00.238 --> 01:00:03.442
I really mean the following:
give every molecule a name,

01:00:03.442 --> 01:00:05.656
A, B,
C, D,

01:00:05.656 --> 01:00:07.777
whatever.
Then put A here and

01:00:07.777 --> 01:00:09.697
B here,
C here and D

01:00:09.697 --> 01:00:11.690
there;
that's one arrangement.

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:13.349
Then permute them,
put D here and B

01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:14.767
here and C here and
A there,

01:00:14.767 --> 01:00:16.981
that's another arrangement.
To my naked eye they,

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:19.535
all look the same,
but they all produce the same

01:00:19.535 --> 01:00:21.709
macroscopic effect,
but they're different

01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:25.633
microscopic arrangements.
And you're supposed to take the

01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:29.702
log of the number of these
arrangements multiply by this

01:00:29.702 --> 01:00:32.214
constant,
called Boltzmann's constant,

01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:34.130
to get the entropy of the
state.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.180
So, now let's apply it to this
gas here.

01:00:40.639 --> 01:00:43.608
Now, the number of microscopic
arrangements,

01:00:43.608 --> 01:00:46.300
if you really want to get down
to it,

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:49.079
requires dividing the box into
tiny little cells,

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:52.323
maybe 1 cubic millimeter and
saying how many atoms are in

01:00:52.323 --> 01:00:54.769
each region.
But we're going to do a crude

01:00:54.769 --> 01:00:57.336
calculation in which we'll only
say the following:

01:00:57.336 --> 01:01:00.480
that either a molecule is on
the left or is on the right.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.623
We are saying these are the
only two positions open to the

01:01:04.623 --> 01:01:06.280
gas;
left or right.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.715
Of course, in the left,
there is left corner top and

01:01:08.715 --> 01:01:10.960
left corner bottom,
but don't worry about it.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.681
Just say that only two things
it can do, it can be on the left

01:01:13.681 --> 01:01:18.393
or it can be on the right.
Now, let's ask ourselves if the

01:01:18.393 --> 01:01:20.740
gas looks like this.

01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:29.750
How many ways can it be in this
arrangement?

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:34.620
As compared to how many ways it
can be in this arrangement?

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.352
It is like the following:
molecules are moving randomly,

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:48.521
a given molecule has got 50/50
chance of being on the left or

01:01:48.521 --> 01:01:51.943
being on the right.
You are demanding that all the

01:01:51.943 --> 01:01:55.407
N molecules on their own,
there's no partition now,

01:01:55.407 --> 01:01:57.900
on their own be on the
left-hand side.

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:03.755
You can see it's like tossing a
coin N times and wanting

01:02:03.755 --> 01:02:07.688
heads every time.
Because you want every guy in a

01:02:07.688 --> 01:02:10.380
random process to end up picking
left.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:14.046
So, if you want them all to be
left, there's only one way to do

01:02:14.046 --> 01:02:17.179
that, and that's like saying I
tossed a million coins,

01:02:17.179 --> 01:02:20.530
I wanted all heads.
There's only one way to do that.

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:23.148
So, that arrangement,
if you like,

01:02:23.148 --> 01:02:26.719
we will say looks like this,
left, left, left,

01:02:26.719 --> 01:02:28.968
left, left;
for everybody,

01:02:28.968 --> 01:02:33.902
that's the arrangement here.
Take another one where one

01:02:33.902 --> 01:02:39.386
molecule is over here,
and all the others are here on

01:02:39.386 --> 01:02:43.012
the left side.
That looks like left,

01:02:43.012 --> 01:02:46.240
left, left, right,
left, left, left.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.491
But that's one arrangement.
But have I done my complete

01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:52.740
homework here?
Are there more arrangements?

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.374
I want you to think about it.
Student: [inaudible]

01:02:55.374 --> 01:02:57.782
arrangements Professor
Ramamurti Shankar: Pardon

01:02:57.782 --> 01:02:59.261
me.
Student: [inaudible]

01:02:59.261 --> 01:03:00.432
arrangements.
Professor Ramamurti

01:03:00.432 --> 01:03:01.813
Shankar: This is only one of
the arrangements for the

01:03:01.813 --> 01:03:04.586
molecule on the right.
There's another arrangement in

01:03:04.586 --> 01:03:08.826
which I can have the second
molecule, molecule Moe or Joe or

01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:11.987
Poe, whoever's here.
You can pick them in N

01:03:11.987 --> 01:03:13.746
ways.
Already when one is on the left

01:03:13.746 --> 01:03:16.453
and N - 1 on the right,
there are more ways in which

01:03:16.453 --> 01:03:18.721
that can happen.
So, your eye sees one on the

01:03:18.721 --> 01:03:21.522
right, N - 1 on the left.
There are N ways in

01:03:21.522 --> 01:03:25.159
which that can happen.
It's like saying if I toss

01:03:25.159 --> 01:03:28.659
coins, I want 1 head and 99
tails.

01:03:28.659 --> 01:03:33.357
Well, it turns out there are a
100 ways in which it can happen,

01:03:33.357 --> 01:03:37.525
because the one head I got
could have occurred in one of

01:03:37.525 --> 01:03:42.877
the hundred different turns.
Now, suppose I want 2 heads and

01:03:42.877 --> 01:03:48.543
98 tails, then as you know the
way to do that is 100 times 99

01:03:48.543 --> 01:03:52.095
divided by 1 times 2.
These are some combinatorics

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:56.586
you learn in high school.
So, you find that if you plot

01:03:56.586 --> 01:04:02.838
number heads over the total
number, and ask for how many

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:08.806
ways in which that can happen,
all heads can occur in only

01:04:08.806 --> 01:04:12.335
way, every coin has to be head,
1 head less,

01:04:12.335 --> 01:04:16.440
1 tail and 99 heads can occur
in N ways,

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.409
then it'll become more and more
and more.

01:04:18.409 --> 01:04:21.922
And you will find the 50/50
chance of half the number of

01:04:21.922 --> 01:04:25.755
heads and half the number of
tails has the biggest occurrence

01:04:25.755 --> 01:04:26.330
rate,

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.316
because that's the most number
of ways to get 50/50 than

01:04:33.316 --> 01:04:36.916
anything else.
And 100 heads is as bad as 100

01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:38.658
tails.
Again, there's only one way in

01:04:38.658 --> 01:04:40.839
which you can get all heads in
one way and which you can get

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:42.639
all tails.
But as you start scrambling

01:04:42.639 --> 01:04:44.349
them there are more and more
ways.

01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:48.960
That means for the molecule,
if you have a 100 molecules,

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.652
the number of states omega is
largest when they're equally

01:04:53.652 --> 01:04:56.492
distributed.
In fact, as the number

01:04:56.492 --> 01:05:00.300
molecules goes from 100 to 1000
to million to 10^(23),

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:04.246
this function is so sharply
peaked that the approximate

01:05:04.246 --> 01:05:07.900
formula for omega,
when it's at the 50/50 thing,

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.538
is in fact 2 to the N.
Namely, all the arrangements

01:05:11.538 --> 01:05:14.530
more or less belong to this
configuration.

01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:18.496
Therefore, if you go back to
the Boltzmann formula and,

01:05:18.496 --> 01:05:21.139
wait let me keep the formula
here,

01:05:21.139 --> 01:05:25.307
and look at S = K log
Ω, then you find

01:05:25.307 --> 01:05:30.380
S_1 is when
everybody is on the left,

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:35.777
that is k log 1,
and S_2 is

01:05:35.777 --> 01:05:41.389
50/50 mix, half on the left and
half on the right,

01:05:41.389 --> 01:05:46.260
that entropy is k log
2^(N),.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.990
Therefore, you can see that's
what I wrote down here,

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:52.000
K log 2^(N).

01:05:57.199 --> 01:06:01.690
So, the way to understand
entropy is the following.

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:07.954
If I give you a gas and ask,
"Will they ever like to be in

01:06:07.954 --> 01:06:12.460
the left half of the box on
their own?"

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.773
Of course they won't.
But if you start them out that

01:06:14.773 --> 01:06:17.510
way, you force them to be on the
left they'll be on the left.

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:20.326
The question is if you remove
the partition,

01:06:20.326 --> 01:06:22.785
what would they likely do?
Unlike coins,

01:06:22.785 --> 01:06:25.527
which once they land on the
head, they have to stay on the

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:27.500
head, these molecules can move
around.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.452
The question is if they were
all left to begin with,

01:06:30.452 --> 01:06:32.420
how long can they possibly
last?

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:36.137
If they start moving randomly,
they will always end up doing

01:06:36.137 --> 01:06:39.539
this because there are many,
many more ways to do this,

01:06:39.539 --> 01:06:40.800
than to do this.

01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:47.226
So, things go from one
arrangement, macroscopic to

01:06:47.226 --> 01:06:49.820
another one, left to their own
device,

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:53.650
because the final state can be
realized in many,

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:56.909
many more ways than the initial
state.

01:06:56.909 --> 01:07:02.089
Similarly, if you combine a hot
gas and cold gas--This is hot

01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:05.355
and this is cold,
with a thermally insulating

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:09.026
partition, then all the hots are
on the left and all the colds

01:07:09.026 --> 01:07:11.483
are on the right.
If you remove the thermal

01:07:11.483 --> 01:07:14.240
insulation, but not even remove
it, just replace it by a

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.697
heat-conducting thing,
eventually the temperatures

01:07:16.697 --> 01:07:19.552
would equalize.
So, what you find every time

01:07:19.552 --> 01:07:22.727
is, there's many,
many ways in which you can pack

01:07:22.727 --> 01:07:26.829
your atoms--if you put all the
hot on the left and all the cold

01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:29.136
on the right,
that can be achieved in fewer

01:07:29.136 --> 01:07:31.176
ways than in which you let them
go wherever they like.

01:07:31.176 --> 01:07:33.178
[He should have said,
"If you put all hot ones on one

01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:34.819
side and cold on the other,
there are fewer ways of doing

01:07:34.819 --> 01:07:35.525
that, than if you let them go
wherever they liked"]

01:07:35.525 --> 01:07:37.632
So,
what you find is entropy is the

01:07:37.632 --> 01:07:40.829
direct measure of how disordered
your system is.

01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:44.498
One technical measure of
disorder is to ask how many

01:07:44.498 --> 01:07:47.880
microscopic arrangements can
lead to what I see,

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.469
and take the log of that
number.

01:07:50.469 --> 01:07:53.920
And what you find is this has a
very low entropy;

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.496
this is a very high entropy.
Because this configuration--In

01:07:57.496 --> 01:08:00.748
other words, if you took a gas
in a whole room and asked will

01:08:00.748 --> 01:08:02.699
it ever go to this
configuration,

01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:06.059
there is a slight chance it
will.

01:08:06.059 --> 01:08:08.456
That chance is one part and
2^(N),

01:08:08.456 --> 01:08:11.512
where N is 10^(23),
so it's not something you

01:08:11.512 --> 01:08:13.849
should wait for,
but it can happen.

01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:17.068
So, the Second Law of
Thermodynamics is a statistical

01:08:17.068 --> 01:08:18.496
law.
Microscopically,

01:08:18.496 --> 01:08:22.458
it's perfectly allowed for a
gas, for suddenly all the gas in

01:08:22.458 --> 01:08:25.100
the whole room to come to where
I am.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.123
It's allowed but you don't hold
your breath, because that's not

01:08:28.123 --> 01:08:30.722
likely to happen.
The odds for that is again one

01:08:30.722 --> 01:08:32.840
part in 1 over 2 to some huge
number.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.095
On the other hand,
if in this part of the room we

01:08:35.095 --> 01:08:37.303
release some gas,
it'll very quickly spread out,

01:08:37.303 --> 01:08:39.229
because there are more ways to
do it.

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:44.489
So, we understand completely
now why certain things occur and

01:08:44.489 --> 01:08:47.912
why they don't.
Because if you took hot water

01:08:47.912 --> 01:08:50.977
and cold water,
you are separating them to fast

01:08:50.977 --> 01:08:54.493
molecules and slow molecules,
as long as they're in different

01:08:54.493 --> 01:08:56.770
insulated containers,
that's the best they can do.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:59.708
But if you put them in contact,
so that they no longer have to

01:08:59.708 --> 01:09:01.538
be separated,
the question is will they

01:09:01.538 --> 01:09:04.019
remain separated.
It's like saying I have bunch

01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:07.109
of coins which are all left and
all right, but they're allowed

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:10.173
to flip as a function time,
but they'll never remain that

01:09:10.173 --> 01:09:12.004
way.
Okay, so what'll happen is the

01:09:12.004 --> 01:09:14.976
cold molecules and hot will
mingle, and soon the container

01:09:14.976 --> 01:09:18.104
will have cold everywhere and
hot everywhere and you will get

01:09:18.104 --> 01:09:21.432
some intermediate temperature.
Or if you took two different

01:09:21.432 --> 01:09:24.437
dyes, you know water here,
on top of it you pour some red

01:09:24.437 --> 01:09:26.458
paint,
they'll be initially separated

01:09:26.458 --> 01:09:29.381
after a while they will mix,
because there's no reason for

01:09:29.381 --> 01:09:32.510
the hot--for the red molecules
to stay on the top forever;

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:35.132
they would like to occupy the
whole box and so would the

01:09:35.132 --> 01:09:37.230
colorless ones,
and eventually it will become

01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:39.479
pink.
Because there's more ways to

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.949
remain pink than to remain
separated.

01:09:41.949 --> 01:09:45.541
Likewise, if pink spontaneously
separated into red and

01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:48.251
colorless, that is very,
very improbable,

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:51.640
because entropy for that state
would be lower.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.391
So, you have to understand the
Second Law of Thermodynamics is

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:58.589
saying certain things occur
because if you go in that

01:09:58.589 --> 01:10:02.279
direction you can realize that
arrangement in more ways.

01:10:02.279 --> 01:10:06.811
And since microscopic motion is
random, it's like tossing coins

01:10:06.811 --> 01:10:10.319
to ask for N heads many
thousand times;

01:10:10.319 --> 01:10:12.782
it's like asking all the
molecules to be on the left side

01:10:12.782 --> 01:10:14.850
of the room, to ask for 50/50
head and tails,

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:18.520
is like asking for molecules to
populate the room equally.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.520
Okay, so that's called the
arrow of time.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.539
But you've got to be careful
about one thing;

01:10:23.539 --> 01:10:26.479
the entropy of a part of the
universe can go down.

01:10:26.479 --> 01:10:29.859
It's just the entropy of the
whole universe will not go down.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:33.675
So, all of life is an example
of lowering entropy because,

01:10:33.675 --> 01:10:37.757
you know, the creation of life
or the creation of tomatoes out

01:10:37.757 --> 01:10:41.773
of mud is a highly organizing
process so the entropy there is

01:10:41.773 --> 01:10:44.741
really going down.
But if you kept track of the

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.881
rest of the world,
you will find there's some

01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:49.409
corresponding increase of
entropy somewhere else.

01:10:49.409 --> 01:10:51.975
Or take your freezer,
you know, your refrigerator

01:10:51.975 --> 01:10:55.082
sucks heat out of your freezer,
∆Q over T for

01:10:55.082 --> 01:10:57.165
that is negative,
but somewhere there's bigger

01:10:57.165 --> 01:10:59.989
heat emitted outside from the
exhaust of the refrigerator.

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:01.964
If you took care of all of
that, entropy of the universe

01:11:01.964 --> 01:11:51.000
will go up or remain same;
it really doesn't go down.

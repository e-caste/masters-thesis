00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.927
Professor Paul Bloom:
We began the course by talking

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:20.820
about one of the foundational
ideas of modern psychology.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.208
This is what Francis Crick
described as "The Astonishing

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:26.980
Hypothesis," the idea that our
mental life,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.984
our consciousness,
our morality,

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:32.929
our capacity to make decisions
and judgments is the product of

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:36.284
a material physical brain.
What I want to talk about today

00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:38.338
and introduce it,
and it's going to be a theme

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.802
that we're going to continue
throughout the rest of the

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:43.437
course,
is a second idea which I think

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:46.500
is equally shocking,
perhaps more shocking.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.271
And this has to do with where
mental life comes from,

00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:54.550
not necessary its material
nature, but rather its origin.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.341
And the notion,
this other "astonishing

00:00:57.341 --> 00:01:01.308
hypothesis," is what the
philosopher Daniel Dennett has

00:01:01.308 --> 00:01:04.319
described as Darwin's dangerous
idea.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:09.279
And this is the modern
biological account of the origin

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:13.504
of biological phenomena
including psychological

00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:16.883
phenomena.
Now, people have long been

00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:20.989
interested in the evolution of
complicated things.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:25.060
And there is an argument that's
been repeated throughout history

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.096
and many people have found it
deeply compelling,

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:31.816
including Darwin himself.
Darwin, as he wrote The

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:35.722
Origin of Species, was
deeply persuaded and moved by

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:39.840
this argument from--in the form
presented by the theologian

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.099
William Paley.
So, Paley has an example here.

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.434
Paley tells--gives the example
of you're walking down the beach

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:48.819
and your foot hits a rock.
And then you wonder,

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.269
"Where did that rock come
from?"

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:53.003
And you don't really expect an
interesting answer to that

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:54.570
question.
Maybe it was always there.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.140
Maybe it fell from the sky.
Who cares?

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.186
But suppose you found a watch
on the ground and then you asked

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:05.593
where the watch had come from.
Paley points out that it would

00:02:05.593 --> 00:02:10.083
not be satisfying to simply say
it's always been there or it

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:15.083
came there as an accident.
And he uses this comparison to

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:18.714
make a point,
which is a watch is a very

00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:22.159
complicated and interesting
thing.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.189
Paley is--was a medical doctor
and Paley goes on to describe a

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:32.218
watch and compare a watch to the
eye and noticing that a watch

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:36.752
and the eye contain multitudes
of parts that interact in

00:02:36.752 --> 00:02:40.710
complicated ways to do
interesting things.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.827
In fact, to change and to
update the analogy a little bit,

00:02:44.827 --> 00:02:48.800
an eye is very much like a
machine known as a camera.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.120
And they're similar at a deep
way.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.385
They both have lenses that bend
light and project an image onto

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:58.438
a light-sensitive surface.
For the eye the light-sensitive

00:02:58.438 --> 00:03:02.000
surface is the retina.
For the camera it's the film.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.610
They both have a focusing
mechanism.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.280
For the eye it's muscles that
change the shape of the lens.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.534
For a camera it's a diaphragm
that governs the amount of

00:03:12.534 --> 00:03:16.354
incoming light.
Even they're both encased in

00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:18.978
black.
The light-sensitive part of the

00:03:18.978 --> 00:03:22.460
eye and part of the camera are
both encased in black.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.197
The difference is--So in fact,
the eye and a camera look a lot

00:03:27.197 --> 00:03:30.770
alike and we know the camera is
an artifact.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.299
The camera has been constructed
by an intelligent--by

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.150
intelligent beings to fulfill a
purpose.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.950
In fact, if there's any
difference between things like

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.800
the eye and things like a
camera,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.366
the difference is that things
like the eye are far more

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:48.139
complicated than things like the
camera.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.807
When I was a kid I had this
incredible TV show called "The

00:03:51.807 --> 00:03:55.078
Six Million Dollar Man."
Anybody here ever seen it or

00:03:55.078 --> 00:03:57.550
heard of it?
Oh.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.147
Anyway, the idea is there's a
test pilot, Steve Austin,

00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:07.000
and his rocket jet crashes and
he loses his--both legs,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.240
his arm and his eye,
which sounds really bad but

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.860
they replace them with bionic
stuff,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.961
with artificial leg,
artificial arm and an

00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:17.370
artificial eye that are really
super-powered.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.167
And then he fights crime.
[laughter]

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:22.329
It was [laughs]
really the best show on.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.507
It was really good,
[laughter]

00:04:24.507 --> 00:04:27.209
but the thing is this was in
1974.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:32.063
It's now over thirty years
later and it's true then and

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.029
it's true now,
this is fantasy.

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.070
It doesn't make it to the level
of science fiction.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.486
It's fantasy.
We are impossibly far away from

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:43.670
developing machines that could
do this.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.729
We are impossibly far away from
building a machine that can do

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.366
what the human eye does.
And so somebody like Paley

00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:54.336
points out, "Look.
The complexity of the

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:58.690
biological world suggests that
these things are complicated

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.969
artifacts created by a designer
far smarter than any human

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.364
engineer.
And the designer,

00:05:05.364 --> 00:05:09.620
of course, would be God."
I went to Goggle Images.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.251
That--I don't mean that to be
sacrilegious [laughter]

00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:14.329
in any sense.
You could try this.

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:19.707
I went to "Google Images" and
typed in "God" and this is what

00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:23.740
showed up right in the middle
so--And this,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.191
Paley argued,
and it was--has been convincing

00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:28.921
throughout most of history,
is a perfectly logical

00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:32.319
explanation for where these
complicated things come from.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.756
It also has the advantage of
being compatible with scripture

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:39.017
and compatible with religious
beliefs, but Paley made the

00:05:39.017 --> 00:05:43.092
point this stands on its own.
If you find complicated things

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:47.183
that--complicated artifacts,
you don't assume they emerged

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:50.134
by accident.
You assume that they were

00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:55.584
created by an intelligent being.
Now, this view has always had

00:05:55.584 --> 00:05:58.339
problems.
This view, you could call it

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.674
"creationism," which is that
biological structures were

00:06:01.674 --> 00:06:05.379
created by an intelligent being,
has always had problems.

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.889
One problem is it pushes back
the question.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.490
So you ask, "Where did that
intelligent being come from?"

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.193
And this is a particularly
serious problem from the

00:06:14.193 --> 00:06:17.329
standpoint of the evolution of
psychological structures.

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:20.944
So, we want to know,
"how is it that creatures came

00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:25.425
across--upon this earth with the
ability to reason and plan and

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:28.099
do things?"
And then the answer is "well,

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.730
another creature with that
ability created us."

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.233
That doesn't necessarily mean
it's wrong, but it means it's

00:06:34.233 --> 00:06:36.461
unsatisfying.
You immediately want to get an

00:06:36.461 --> 00:06:38.839
explanation for where that other
creature comes from.

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.993
More to the point,
there's always been evidence

00:06:41.993 --> 00:06:44.841
for evolution.
And what I mean by evolution

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:47.530
here isn't necessarily a
specific mechanism,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.346
but merely the fact that body
parts like the eye didn't emerge

00:06:51.346 --> 00:06:55.250
all of a sudden,
but rather have parallels both

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.430
within other existing animals
and across human and biological

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.687
history.
This evidence comes in

00:07:03.687 --> 00:07:07.044
different forms.
There is fossil evidence for

00:07:07.044 --> 00:07:10.585
different body parts suggesting
that they have evolved from more

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:13.221
rudimentary form.
There is vestigial

00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:16.637
characteristics.
And what this means is there

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:20.824
are characteristics that human
bodies have that are somewhat

00:07:20.824 --> 00:07:23.957
inexplicable,
like the human tailbone or

00:07:23.957 --> 00:07:28.182
goose-bumps, unless you view
them--the human body in its

00:07:28.182 --> 00:07:32.329
current form as modifications
from a previous form.

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:35.360
There are parallels with other
animals.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.727
And this is clear in psychology.
So, a human brain is different

00:07:38.727 --> 00:07:41.224
from the rat,
cat, and monkey brain but at

00:07:41.224 --> 00:07:44.695
the same time you see them
following a sort of common plan

00:07:44.695 --> 00:07:48.388
and common structures.
And one rational inference from

00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:52.220
this is that they're linked
through evolutionary descent.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.889
Finally, there is occasional
poor design.

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:00.795
So, Paley rhapsodized about the
remarkable powers of the human

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:03.689
body and the different body
parts,

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:06.220
but even Paley admitted that
there are some things which just

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.024
don't work very well.
Your eye contains a blind spot

00:08:09.024 --> 00:08:11.470
because of how the nerves are
wired up.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:16.024
In the male urinary system the
urethra goes through the

00:08:16.024 --> 00:08:19.230
prostate gland instead of around
it,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.148
which leads to many physical
problems in men later on in

00:08:22.148 --> 00:08:24.886
life.
And so you're forced to either

00:08:24.886 --> 00:08:29.620
argue that these are really good
things or that God is either

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.111
malicious or incompetent.
And those are difficult

00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:36.283
arguments to make.
So, these are problems with the

00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:39.391
creationist view.
But still, for the longest time

00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:42.789
in human intellectual history
there was no alternative.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.847
And in fact,
Richard Dawkins,

00:08:44.847 --> 00:08:48.300
the most prominent
evolutionary--one of the most

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.193
prominent evolutionary
biologists alive and one of the

00:08:52.193 --> 00:08:55.500
most staunchest critics of
creationism,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.977
has written in The Blind
Watchmaker saying,

00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:03.378
look, anybody 100 years ago or
150 years ago who didn't believe

00:09:03.378 --> 00:09:07.068
that God created humans and
other animals was a moron

00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:11.539
because the argument from design
is a damn good argument.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:14.779
And in the absence of some
other argument you should

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:17.065
go--defer to that.
You should say,

00:09:17.065 --> 00:09:20.990
"Well, there are all of these
problems but humans and other

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.916
biological forms must have
divine creation because of their

00:09:24.916 --> 00:09:28.029
incredible rich and intricate
structure."

00:09:28.029 --> 00:09:31.889
What changed all that of course
was Darwin.

00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:37.075
And Darwin--Darwin's profound
accomplishment was showing how

00:09:37.075 --> 00:09:41.470
you get these complicated
biological structures,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.373
like the eye,
emerging through a purely

00:09:45.373 --> 00:09:49.380
non-intentional,
non-created process,

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.085
a purely physical process.
And this could be seen as equal

00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:58.877
in importance to the claim that
the Earth revolves around the

00:09:58.877 --> 00:10:03.110
Sun and that we're not the
center of the universe.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.479
And in fact,
some scholars have made a

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:08.617
suggestion which seems
plausible, that the idea of

00:10:08.617 --> 00:10:12.780
natural selection is the most
important idea in the sciences,

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.061
period.
So, this is not a course in

00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:17.629
evolution and I expect people to
have some background.

00:10:17.629 --> 00:10:20.786
If you don't have a background
in it, you could get your

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:24.001
background from external
readings but also from--the Gray

00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:27.674
textbook and the Norton readings
will both--will each provide you

00:10:27.674 --> 00:10:30.429
with enough background to get up
to speed.

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:33.450
But the general idea is that
there are three components to

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.100
natural selection.
There is variation.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.971
And this variation gives rise
to different degrees of survival

00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:44.032
and reproduction and gets passed
on from generation to generation

00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:48.707
and gives rise to adaptations,
what Darwin described as "that

00:10:48.707 --> 00:10:53.909
perfection of structure that
justly excites our imagination."

00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:57.760
And the biological world has
all sorts of examples.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.072
You look at camouflage.
Prior to Darwin one might

00:11:01.072 --> 00:11:05.133
imagine that some intelligent
creator crafted animals to hide

00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:08.127
from their prey.
But now we have a different

00:11:08.127 --> 00:11:11.731
alternative, which is that
animals that were better hidden

00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:13.868
survive better,
reproduce more,

00:11:13.868 --> 00:11:17.330
and over the course of
thousands, perhaps millions of

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.847
years,
they've developed elaborate

00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:22.647
camouflage.
There's been a lot of work on

00:11:22.647 --> 00:11:25.200
Paley's favorite example – the
eye.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.924
So Darwin himself noted that
the human eye did not seem to

00:11:28.924 --> 00:11:32.845
emerge all at once but rather
you could look at other animals

00:11:32.845 --> 00:11:36.438
and find parallels in other
animals that seem to suggest

00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:39.509
that more rudimentary forms are
possible.

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:44.169
And more recently computer
simulations have developed--have

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:49.310
been developed that have crafted
eyes under plausible assumptions

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.889
of selective pressure and what
the starting point is.

00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:57.860
So, this is the theory of
natural selection.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.797
The good question to ask is,
"why am I talking about

00:12:00.797 --> 00:12:03.620
evolution in Introduction to
Psychology class?"

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.333
And the answer is that there
are two ideas which come

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:10.020
together.
And in fact,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.149
they're both of the dangerous
ideas.

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:17.153
One idea is that Darwin's
idea--that biological forms

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:21.580
evolve through this purely
physical process.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.961
The second idea,
the rejection of Descartes,

00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:29.287
is that our minds are the
product of physical things and

00:12:29.287 --> 00:12:33.507
physical events.
You bring these together and it

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:38.376
forces you to the perspective
that what we are--our mental

00:12:38.376 --> 00:12:42.627
life is no less than the eye,
no less than camouflage,

00:12:42.627 --> 00:12:45.978
the product of this purely
physical process of natural

00:12:45.978 --> 00:12:48.409
selection.
More to the point,

00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:53.326
our cognitive mechanisms were
evolved not to please God,

00:12:53.326 --> 00:12:57.536
not as random accidents,
but rather for the purpose of

00:12:57.536 --> 00:13:00.477
survival and reproduction.
More contentiously,

00:13:00.477 --> 00:13:04.345
you could argue they've been
shaped by natural selection to

00:13:04.345 --> 00:13:07.545
solve certain problems.
And so, from an evolutionary

00:13:07.545 --> 00:13:09.899
point of view,
when you look at what the brain

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:12.673
is and what the brain does,
you look at it in terms of

00:13:12.673 --> 00:13:21.494
these problems.
And this is what psychology is

00:13:21.494 --> 00:13:24.317
for.
This is what our thinking is

00:13:24.317 --> 00:13:26.215
for.
We have evolved mental

00:13:26.215 --> 00:13:30.354
capacities to solve different
problems: perception of the

00:13:30.354 --> 00:13:33.901
world, communication,
getting nutrition and rest,

00:13:33.901 --> 00:13:38.610
and so on.
Now, we're going to talk about

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:44.370
how to apply evolutionary theory
to psychology.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.641
But as we're doing so we have
to keep in mind two

00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:50.204
misconceptions.
There are two ways you can go

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:53.086
seriously wrong here.
The first is to think that,

00:13:53.086 --> 00:13:56.450
well, if we're taking an
evolutionary approach then

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.419
natural selection will cause
animals to want to spread their

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:02.877
genes.
So, if we're being biological

00:14:02.877 --> 00:14:06.548
about it, that means everybody
must run around thinking "I want

00:14:06.548 --> 00:14:10.777
to spread my genes."
I want to--and this is just

00:14:10.777 --> 00:14:13.330
really --Oops.
I shouldn't do that.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:19.190
This is really wrong.
It's even in red.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.440
And what this fails to do is
make a distinction between

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.149
ultimate causation and proximate
causation.

00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:29.009
And those are technical terms
referring to--Ultimate causation

00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:32.679
is the reason why something is
there in the first place,

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:35.470
over millions of years of
history.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.110
Proximate causation is why
you're doing it now.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.846
And these are different.
Obviously, for instance,

00:14:41.846 --> 00:14:45.327
animals do all sorts of things
to help survive and reproduce

00:14:45.327 --> 00:14:47.509
but a cockroach doesn't think
"oh,

00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:49.997
I'm doing this to help survive
and reproduce and spread my

00:14:49.997 --> 00:14:51.704
genes."
A cockroach doesn't know

00:14:51.704 --> 00:14:55.072
anything about genes.
Rather, the mechanisms that

00:14:55.072 --> 00:14:59.556
make it do what it does are
different from its own mental

00:14:59.556 --> 00:15:03.000
states, if it has any--why it
does them.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.779
This is a point nicely made by
William James.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.930
So, William James is asked,
"Why do we eat?"

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.659
And he writes, 
Not one man in a billion

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:13.149
when taking his dinner ever
thinks of utility.

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:16.139
He eats because the food tastes
good and makes him want more.

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:18.641
If you asked him why you should
want to eat more of what tastes

00:15:18.641 --> 00:15:20.820
like that, instead of revering
you as a philosopher,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.470
he will probably laugh at you
for a fool.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.200
And it's really the common
sense answer.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.004
"Why are you eating?"
Nobody's going to answer,

00:15:28.004 --> 00:15:31.389
"Because I must sustain my body
so as to spread my genes in the

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:34.295
future."
Rather, you eat because you're

00:15:34.295 --> 00:15:36.016
hungry.
Those two theories,

00:15:36.016 --> 00:15:39.570
you eat because you're hungry
and you eat to sustain your body

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.133
so you could spread your genes
in the future,

00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:45.084
are not alternative.
Rather, they're different

00:15:45.084 --> 00:15:49.929
levels of explanation.
And you can't confuse them.

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:54.452
The ultimate level which does
appeal to survival and

00:15:54.452 --> 00:15:58.442
reproduction does not--is
independent from the

00:15:58.442 --> 00:16:01.998
psychological level.
To give another example,

00:16:01.998 --> 00:16:05.272
people protect their children
so you ask, "Why do people

00:16:05.272 --> 00:16:08.561
protect their children?
Why would somebody devote so

00:16:08.561 --> 00:16:11.921
much effort to protecting and
helping and feeding their

00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:14.099
children?"
Well, the evolutionary

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:17.586
explanation is animals that
don't protect their offspring

00:16:17.586 --> 00:16:19.889
don't last over evolutionary
time.

00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:23.516
We protect our offspring
because they contain fifty

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:26.344
percent of our genes,
but that's not the

00:16:26.344 --> 00:16:29.631
psychological explanation.
Nobody but a deranged

00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:32.913
psychologist would ever answer,
"Oh, I love my children because

00:16:32.913 --> 00:16:35.190
they contain fifty percent of my
genes."

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.637
Rather, the psychological
explanation is a deeper--is

00:16:38.637 --> 00:16:41.289
different and has a different
texture.

00:16:41.289 --> 00:16:45.028
And this will be a lot clearer
when we talk about the emotions,

00:16:45.028 --> 00:16:48.646
where you could really see a
distinction between the question

00:16:48.646 --> 00:16:52.384
of why we feel something from an
evolutionary point of view and

00:16:52.384 --> 00:16:55.580
why we feel it from a day-to-day
point of view.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.514
The second misconception is
that natural selection entails

00:16:59.514 --> 00:17:02.965
that everything is adaptive,
that everything we do,

00:17:02.965 --> 00:17:05.450
everything we think is
adaptive.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:11.513
This is wrong.
Natural selection and

00:17:11.513 --> 00:17:15.430
evolution, more generally,
distinguish between adaptations

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.936
and byproducts and accidents.
Many of you are currently,

00:17:19.936 --> 00:17:23.839
or will as you get older,
suffer back pain.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.564
If I was to ask you,
"So, why do you suffer back

00:17:26.564 --> 00:17:29.103
pain?
How does back pain help you

00:17:29.103 --> 00:17:32.867
survive and reproduce?"
Well, the answer is it's not an

00:17:32.867 --> 00:17:35.125
adaptation.
Back pain is an accidental

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.430
byproduct of how our backs are
shaped.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.467
Don't go looking for an
adaptive reason for hiccups or

00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:46.079
self-pity or bloating after you
eat.

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:50.147
There's all sorts of things a
body will do that have no

00:17:50.147 --> 00:17:53.160
adaptive value,
rather just accidents.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.369
We have a body that does all
sorts of things.

00:17:55.369 --> 00:17:59.177
Some things it will do by
accident and this is certainly

00:17:59.177 --> 00:18:00.700
true for psychology.

00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:06.740
So, a lot of the things,
for instance,

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.127
that occupy our interest or our
fascination in day-to-day life

00:18:11.127 --> 00:18:14.579
are almost certainly
evolutionary accidents.

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:18.938
The number--The three--Three of
the main preoccupations of

00:18:18.938 --> 00:18:23.628
humans are pornography,
television, and chocolate but

00:18:23.628 --> 00:18:27.460
if I asked you,
"Why do you like porn?"

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.936
and you'd say,
"Because my ancestors who liked

00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:35.109
porn reproduced more than those
who didn't," [laughter]

00:18:35.109 --> 00:18:39.223
it's not true.
Rather, you like porn,

00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:42.441
assuming you do,
[laughter]

00:18:42.441 --> 00:18:46.748
as an accident.
You have evolved--For instance,

00:18:46.748 --> 00:18:50.504
should you be a heterosexual
male, you have evolved to be

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:53.638
attracted to women.
That is most likely to be an

00:18:53.638 --> 00:18:57.134
evolutionary adaptation because
being attracted to women and

00:18:57.134 --> 00:19:00.452
wanting to have sex with women
is one step to the road to

00:19:00.452 --> 00:19:02.605
having kids,
which is very good from an

00:19:02.605 --> 00:19:05.219
evolutionary perspective.
It so happens,

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:10.361
though, in our modern
environment that people have

00:19:10.361 --> 00:19:15.651
created images that substitute.
So, instead of actually going

00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:18.974
out and seeking out women you
could just surf the web for

00:19:18.974 --> 00:19:22.654
hours and hours and watch dirty
movies and read dirty books –

00:19:22.654 --> 00:19:25.759
evolutionary adaptive dead ends.
They're accidents.

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:28.509
Why do you like chocolate bars,
assuming that you do?

00:19:28.509 --> 00:19:31.522
It is not because your
ancestors in the African savanna

00:19:31.522 --> 00:19:34.646
who enjoyed chocolate bars
reproduced more than those who

00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:37.287
didn't.
Rather, it is because we've

00:19:37.287 --> 00:19:39.839
evolved a taste for sweet
things.

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:42.028
And we've evolved a taste for
sweet things,

00:19:42.028 --> 00:19:44.477
in part, because the sweet
things in our natural

00:19:44.477 --> 00:19:46.769
environment like fruit were good
for us.

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:50.663
In the modern world we have
created things like chocolate,

00:19:50.663 --> 00:19:54.009
which are not so good for us
but we eat anyway.

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:58.367
A lot of the debates--There's a
lot of controversy in psychology

00:19:58.367 --> 00:20:01.549
over the scope of evolutionary
explanations.

00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:07.659
And a lot of the debate tends
to be over what's an adaptation

00:20:07.659 --> 00:20:11.080
and what isn't.
There are some clear cases.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.839
We have color vision.
Why do we have color vision?

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:18.197
Well, I think everybody would
agree we have color vision as an

00:20:18.197 --> 00:20:21.839
adaptation because of the
advantages it gives us for

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:24.840
seeing and making visual
distinctions.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.616
We are afraid of snakes.
We're going to talk about that

00:20:29.616 --> 00:20:32.664
in more detail but there's a
straightforward adaptive story

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.648
about that.
We are afraid of snakes

00:20:34.648 --> 00:20:36.875
because, really,
our ancestors who weren't

00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:39.807
afraid of snakes didn't
reproduce as much as those that

00:20:39.807 --> 00:20:44.200
were.
We like chocolate bars and we

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.650
enjoy NASCAR.
Those cannot be adaptations

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.948
because chocolate bars and
NASCAR are recent developments

00:20:50.948 --> 00:20:54.070
that could not have been
anticipated by evolution.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.650
Those are easy questions.
Here are some hard questions.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.921
Music.
Everywhere in the world people

00:21:00.921 --> 00:21:05.428
like music.
Is this an adaptation for some

00:21:05.428 --> 00:21:09.710
selective advantage or is it an
accident?

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.598
Steven Pinker,
who wrote The Language

00:21:11.598 --> 00:21:14.358
Instinct that you read
before, caused a huge amount of

00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:17.263
controversy when he argued that
music is just an evolutionary

00:21:17.263 --> 00:21:19.673
accident.
He described it as auditory

00:21:19.673 --> 00:21:23.413
cheesecake, something we like to
gorge ourselves on that have

00:21:23.413 --> 00:21:27.057
no--has no adaptive advantage.
Other people argue music does

00:21:27.057 --> 00:21:32.000
have an adaptive advantage.
Sometimes males use violence to

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.001
coerce sex.
Is male sexual violence a

00:21:35.001 --> 00:21:37.960
biological adaptation or is it
an accident?

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.804
There's more than one language.
Is that just an accidental

00:21:41.804 --> 00:21:45.262
byproduct of the way language
works or is there some sort of

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:48.662
group or selectionist advantage
sketched out in some way of

00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:51.720
having multiple languages?
What about visual art?

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.589
What about fiction?
What about our love for stories?

00:21:54.589 --> 00:21:57.500
Those are all matters of heated
debate.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.991
And so, we have to keep in mind
some things plainly are

00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:04.201
accidents.
Some things almost certainly

00:22:04.201 --> 00:22:06.694
aren't accidents.
Where the action is in the

00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:10.519
study of psychology and the
study of evolution of cognition

00:22:10.519 --> 00:22:13.289
is trying to figure out which is
which.

00:22:13.289 --> 00:22:16.880
So, those are the
misconceptions we have to avoid.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.121
But still, who cares?
Again this is an Introduction

00:22:21.121 --> 00:22:23.317
to Psych course.
Why are we talking about

00:22:23.317 --> 00:22:25.914
evolution?
Why should it matter to a

00:22:25.914 --> 00:22:29.259
psychologist how the mind has
evolved?

00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:32.318
I'm going to talk about
evolution now but for the rest

00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:35.435
of the course I'm just
interested in how our minds are,

00:22:35.435 --> 00:22:38.349
period.
S,o why would evolution matter?

00:22:38.349 --> 00:22:41.569
Well, many people think it
doesn't.

00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:46.616
For instance – and they think
it doesn't for different reasons

00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:49.660
– one claim is a metaphysical
one.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.648
You might be a dualist.
You might reject the idea your

00:22:52.648 --> 00:22:55.712
mental life is the product of
your brain and hence evolution

00:22:55.712 --> 00:22:58.413
is irrelevant to psychology
because the brain and the

00:22:58.413 --> 00:23:01.107
mind--because the brain,
which may have evolved,

00:23:01.107 --> 00:23:03.430
has nothing interesting to do
with the mind.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:08.264
Lisa Simpson got it wrong when
she said the Pope--She got it

00:23:08.264 --> 00:23:12.690
half right when she said the
Pope favored evolution.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.426
It is true.
John Paul II,

00:23:15.426 --> 00:23:20.541
many years ago,
made a statement saying that

00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:25.299
Darwinian theory is not
incompatible.

00:23:25.299 --> 00:23:29.762
Darwinian theory is a view
about the evolution of species

00:23:29.762 --> 00:23:32.789
that is not motivated by any
animus,

00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:36.551
is a genuine scientific theory,
and should it turn out to be

00:23:36.551 --> 00:23:40.568
true, it is not incompatible to
truth about man as taught by the

00:23:40.568 --> 00:23:43.119
Church.
And scientists were thrilled by

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:46.460
this and they were--they said
he's endorsing evolution.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.127
But what a fewer people talk
about is the fact that after he

00:23:50.127 --> 00:23:54.042
said this he drew the line.
He allowed for evolution of the

00:23:54.042 --> 00:23:57.790
body but he would not allow for
evolution of the mind.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.860
So it was--he wrote: 
If the human body takes

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.166
its origin from preexisting
living matter,

00:24:03.166 --> 00:24:06.089
the spiritual soul is
immediately created by God.

00:24:06.089 --> 00:24:08.050
Consequently,
theories of evolution which

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.040
consider the mind as emerging
from the forces of living matter

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.981
or as a mere epiphenomenon of
this matter are incompatible to

00:24:13.981 --> 00:24:17.089
the truth about man.
So, you might not want

00:24:17.089 --> 00:24:21.289
evolution to be true about the
mind because you might believe

00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:25.490
that the mind is not subject to
the same physical laws as the

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.656
rest of the physical world.
That's one way you could reject

00:24:29.656 --> 00:24:32.424
evolutionary psychology.
Another way to reject

00:24:32.424 --> 00:24:35.545
evolutionary psychology is to
accept that the mind is a

00:24:35.545 --> 00:24:39.014
physical thing but then argue
that all of these instincts and

00:24:39.014 --> 00:24:42.482
these hard-wired facets of human
nature might exist for other

00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:45.200
animals but they don't exist for
people.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.079
So, the anthropologist Ashley
Montagu in '73,

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:51.352
close to when The Six
Million Dollar Man was

00:24:51.352 --> 00:24:53.250
shown, by the way,
said:

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.733
With the exception of the
reactions of infants to sudden

00:24:55.733 --> 00:24:57.809
withdrawals of support and to
sudden loud noises,

00:24:57.809 --> 00:25:00.450
the human being is entirely
instinctless.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.326
Man is man because he has no
instincts, because everything he

00:25:03.326 --> 00:25:05.819
is and has become he has learned
from his culture,

00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:08.457
from the man-made part of the
environment, from other human

00:25:08.457 --> 00:25:12.460
beings.
You might say, "Look.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.852
He could believe that in '74
but, of course,

00:25:14.852 --> 00:25:17.855
all of the infant studies that
have come out since then

00:25:17.855 --> 00:25:20.859
suggested that's not true and
nobody would believe that

00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:22.420
nowadays."
But in fact,

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.990
the view is often
hold--held--Louis Menand in a

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.839
New Yorker article a few
years ago wrote,

00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:31.317
"Every aspect of life has a
biological foundation in exactly

00:25:31.317 --> 00:25:33.574
the same sense,
which is that unless it was

00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:35.480
biologically possible it
wouldn't exist.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.159
After that it's up for grabs."
And this is in the context of

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:42.651
an argument that evolution can't
tell us anything about what's

00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:47.322
most interesting about people.
Menand is not--is an educated,

00:25:47.322 --> 00:25:51.085
intelligent scholar.
He is presumably well aware of

00:25:51.085 --> 00:25:54.596
the findings of Spelke and
Baillargeon about how people are

00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:58.045
hard-wired to understand the
objects in social life and so

00:25:58.045 --> 00:26:00.243
on.
But his point is just that when

00:26:00.243 --> 00:26:03.450
it comes to the more interesting
aspects of human nature,

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.521
the stuff we're naturally,
intuitively interested in,

00:26:06.521 --> 00:26:09.394
that's more cultural.
And the evolutionary theory and

00:26:09.394 --> 00:26:12.326
Darwinian theory just doesn't
have anything much to say about

00:26:12.326 --> 00:26:14.243
it,
not because the mind is

00:26:14.243 --> 00:26:18.477
separate from the brain but just
because humans are much more

00:26:18.477 --> 00:26:22.303
cultural organisms,
and so biology has little to

00:26:22.303 --> 00:26:25.359
say about it.
There's a third objection,

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:29.420
which is you might think,
"Okay, the human mind actually

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.473
does contain instincts.
There is a human nature but we

00:26:33.473 --> 00:26:36.390
should just study it by studying
people.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.262
How could evolution,
the study of evolution,

00:26:39.262 --> 00:26:43.470
the consideration of evolution
tell us anything interesting?"

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.330
I actually, in my own work,
think evolution can tell us

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.357
some interesting things.
And I want to try to make a

00:26:51.357 --> 00:26:56.092
case for ways in which evolution
can inform and enlighten us

00:26:56.092 --> 00:27:00.550
about the mind as it is.
First, I want to make a point,

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:05.056
which is although this course
is Intro Psych and it is about

00:27:05.056 --> 00:27:08.322
the mind as it is,
still I think by any account

00:27:08.322 --> 00:27:11.410
the evolution of consciousness,
morality and so on,

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.295
just is intuitively interesting.
It's the sort of thing that

00:27:15.295 --> 00:27:18.869
people are just fascinated by
and I think it's a question of

00:27:18.869 --> 00:27:21.049
interest in and of its own
right.

00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:24.740
But here's how it could tell us
about psychology.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.432
For one thing,
it can tell us what can be

00:27:28.432 --> 00:27:31.976
innate and what cannot.
So, some problems,

00:27:31.976 --> 00:27:35.685
some evolutionary problems,
have been around for a long

00:27:35.685 --> 00:27:39.599
time and could lead to special
biological adaptations.

00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:43.069
If I told you there is a
biological adaptation for

00:27:43.069 --> 00:27:45.690
talking, mate selection,
childcare;

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.307
maybe it's true,
maybe it isn't,

00:27:48.307 --> 00:27:52.094
but it's not crazy.
From an evolutionary point of

00:27:52.094 --> 00:27:55.430
view, it's a reasonable
possibility that it is.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.415
Other problems are recent and
our brains could not be

00:27:59.415 --> 00:28:03.630
specialized to deal with them:
written communication,

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.205
interacting with strangers,
driving a car,

00:28:06.205 --> 00:28:08.825
playing chess.
If you were to argue that

00:28:08.825 --> 00:28:12.184
there's a part of the brain
devoted to playing chess,

00:28:12.184 --> 00:28:14.509
I would say you're utterly
wrong.

00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:17.223
You cannot be right because,
from an evolutionary point of

00:28:17.223 --> 00:28:19.747
view, there could be no such
part of the brain evolved

00:28:19.747 --> 00:28:22.079
because playing chess is a
recent innovation.

00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:24.868
As a result,
a focus on evolution could help

00:28:24.868 --> 00:28:28.694
discipline us to make coherent
claims about what is built-in

00:28:28.694 --> 00:28:32.802
and what isn't built-in.
Third, we're going to talk

00:28:32.802 --> 00:28:36.329
about human differences in this
course.

00:28:36.329 --> 00:28:39.664
We're going to devote a class
to human differences of the sort

00:28:39.664 --> 00:28:42.890
of what makes you different from
her, different from her.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.569
Why do we have different
intelligences in this class?

00:28:45.569 --> 00:28:48.289
Why are some of us arrogant and
some of us humble?

00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:52.706
Some of us like--attracted to
men, others attracted to women,

00:28:52.706 --> 00:28:55.215
and so on.
But there's also questions of

00:28:55.215 --> 00:28:57.846
group differences.
And evolutionary theory can

00:28:57.846 --> 00:29:00.979
help us say intelligent things
about what sort of group

00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:04.228
differences you should expect
because evolutionary theory

00:29:04.228 --> 00:29:07.767
predicts that some populations
should evolve in different ways

00:29:07.767 --> 00:29:11.909
than others.
The most obvious example is

00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:17.200
that children should be
different from adults.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.951
The evolutionary problems faced
by a child are very different

00:29:20.951 --> 00:29:24.140
from the evolutionary problems
faced by an adult.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.354
And you can make specific and
rather interesting predictions

00:29:27.354 --> 00:29:30.404
about how children's brains
should different--differ from

00:29:30.404 --> 00:29:32.993
adults' brains.
Evolutionary theory

00:29:32.993 --> 00:29:37.164
predicts--does not make any
predictions about racial

00:29:37.164 --> 00:29:40.190
differences or ethnic
differences.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.790
Some might exist,
but there's no adaptive reason

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.999
why humans who have evolved in
different parts of the world

00:29:45.999 --> 00:29:49.539
should have profound differences
in their mental capacities.

00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:52.720
What does evolutionary theory
say about sex differences?

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.566
Well, it says some interesting
things, and we're going to

00:29:56.566 --> 00:29:59.039
devote a class to discussing
them,

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:03.947
but what I think is going to be
true--proved to be important is

00:30:03.947 --> 00:30:08.143
that we'll be able to use
evolutionary biology to talk

00:30:08.143 --> 00:30:13.130
sensibly about what sort of
distinctions between the sexes,

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.674
between males and females,
one would expect to find and

00:30:16.674 --> 00:30:19.299
what sort one wouldn't expect to
find.

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:21.269
We can make educated
predictions.

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:25.069
I'm going to have--I want to
put here a clip of a man.

00:30:25.069 --> 00:30:28.315
This is a scene from a movie,
the movie "Roger Dodger," that

00:30:28.315 --> 00:30:31.339
begins with a man making
quasi-evolutionary claims about

00:30:31.339 --> 00:30:33.650
the differences between men and
women.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.210
And I want to put this as an
example of what you could call

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.420
"barroom evolutionary
psychology."

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:44.283
And I want us to hold this in
our minds because we're going to

00:30:44.283 --> 00:30:48.430
return to these claims and
discuss their validity.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.531
I like this for a few reasons.
First, I like the backward

00:30:51.531 --> 00:30:53.779
reference to William James and
utility.

00:30:53.779 --> 00:30:58.079
Second, it is a gorgeous
combination of some things that

00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:02.380
are actually reasonably rational
and total bull crap.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.239
And--but what evolutionary
biology will give us is the

00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:09.079
tools to distinguish between the
two.

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:12.373
On the face of it immediately,
the ability to read maps,

00:31:12.373 --> 00:31:15.726
the claim that that has a
biological--that differences in

00:31:15.726 --> 00:31:18.660
that ability have a biological
root is crazy.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.851
On the other hand,
the claim that one--that males

00:31:21.851 --> 00:31:26.041
may develop a trait not because
it's advantageous but to attract

00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:29.977
females is less crazy.
The telepathic stuff is really

00:31:29.977 --> 00:31:33.141
crazy but--;So,
I'm not at this point--We're

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:35.789
going to devote a lecture to
sex.

00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:37.860
I do not, at this point,
want to make any claims one way

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.933
or another.
But what I want to suggest is

00:31:39.933 --> 00:31:43.264
that from a biological point of
view we could say sensible and

00:31:43.264 --> 00:31:46.377
intelligent things about what
differences should exist and

00:31:46.377 --> 00:31:49.165
what shouldn't.
Finally, and most of all,

00:31:49.165 --> 00:31:52.759
looking at something from the
perspective of design,

00:31:52.759 --> 00:31:55.546
the perspective of what's it
for, can often give you

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:58.170
interesting insights as to its
current nature.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.584
And I'll give you two quick
examples, one that's not from

00:32:01.584 --> 00:32:05.501
psychology, one that is.
Women suffer--Often women who

00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:10.003
are pregnant early in their
pregnancy suffer from morning

00:32:10.003 --> 00:32:13.460
sickness, nausea,
throwing up and so on.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.819
This has traditionally been
viewed as just a breakdown in

00:32:16.819 --> 00:32:19.940
the system--too much hormones,
everything's askew;

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.224
women get nauseous.
Margie Profet suggested an

00:32:23.224 --> 00:32:27.123
alternative and this won her the
MacArthur Genius Award.

00:32:27.123 --> 00:32:30.770
And this was the claim that
maybe pregnancy sickness is not

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.362
an accident;
rather, it's designed,

00:32:33.362 --> 00:32:36.738
it has a biological purpose.
In particular,

00:32:36.738 --> 00:32:42.015
as the baby develops in the
uterus, it is vulnerable to

00:32:42.015 --> 00:32:46.119
various sorts of poisons or
teratogens.

00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:51.322
Profet suggested that pregnancy
sickness is a hypersensitive

00:32:51.322 --> 00:32:55.289
period where women are extremely
sensitive,

00:32:55.289 --> 00:32:59.778
get extremely nauseous towards
the sorts of foods that could

00:32:59.778 --> 00:33:03.993
damage their baby.
Now, if she just ended there

00:33:03.993 --> 00:33:06.799
it's a story.
How do we know it's true?

00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:09.942
But then she went on to examine
it the same way that any

00:33:09.942 --> 00:33:13.198
scientist examines any claim –
by making predictions and

00:33:13.198 --> 00:33:15.501
testing them.
And this makes some interesting

00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:18.038
predictions.
It suggests the timing of onset

00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:21.549
and offset of pregnancy
sickness, of morning sickness,

00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:25.914
should correspond to the period
of maximal vulnerability on the

00:33:25.914 --> 00:33:28.799
part of the developing embryo or
fetus.

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:32.675
Suggested the types of foods
avoided should correspond to

00:33:32.675 --> 00:33:36.759
those sorts of foods that were
most deadly for the fetus and

00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:40.981
that were deadly for the fetus
during the periods where humans

00:33:40.981 --> 00:33:43.479
evolved.
This last qualification is an

00:33:43.479 --> 00:33:46.117
important one.
Women do not develop an

00:33:46.117 --> 00:33:50.775
aversion to alcohol during
pregnancy even though alcohol is

00:33:50.775 --> 00:33:54.550
extremely dangerous to the
developing child.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:58.053
The answer is an easy one.
Alcohol wasn't around during

00:33:58.053 --> 00:34:01.804
our evolutionary history and we
could not have evolved a system

00:34:01.804 --> 00:34:04.495
to protect ourselves from it.
And finally,

00:34:04.495 --> 00:34:08.210
there should be a relationship
between miscarriage and birth

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.539
defects in a surprising
direction.

00:34:10.539 --> 00:34:13.919
For Profet, and she has
evidence to back this up,

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:17.510
pregnancy sickness is not a
glitch in the system.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.987
Rather, it's the sign of a
healthy act of protective

00:34:20.987 --> 00:34:23.060
mechanism going on.
And in fact,

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.836
the more morning sickness the
more the baby should be

00:34:25.836 --> 00:34:27.489
protected.
Something which,

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:29.530
by and large,
appears to be true.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.296
That's an example of how the
question--when dealing with this

00:34:32.296 --> 00:34:34.878
they say, "Hey.
Women throw up when they get

00:34:34.878 --> 00:34:36.870
pregnant" and then say,
"Look.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.329
Maybe that's not just a glitch.
What's it for?"

00:34:40.329 --> 00:34:43.269
You could then learn some
interesting things.

00:34:43.269 --> 00:34:47.243
Here's a different example
based on the last lecture,

00:34:47.243 --> 00:34:52.058
this wonderful lecture by Peter
Salovey on sex and love where he

00:34:52.058 --> 00:34:56.340
talked about the "big three."
These are the "big three" to

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.420
remind you of what attracts us
to somebody else.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.638
You are very attracted to the
person next to you or a person

00:35:03.638 --> 00:35:07.500
that--because of proximity,
similarity, familiarity.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.670
And there is abundant evidence
supporting the truth of this.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.263
It's almost always true but the
evolutionary psychologist looks

00:35:16.263 --> 00:35:20.559
at this and says there's
something seriously wrong here.

00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:24.583
There are some cases where that
has to be totally,

00:35:24.583 --> 00:35:28.877
absolutely mistaken.
To realize what this is,

00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:34.343
think for a moment.
What humans are you most close

00:35:34.343 --> 00:35:39.320
to, most similar to and most
familiar with?

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:44.186
What humans did you spend over
ten years of your life with who

00:35:44.186 --> 00:35:48.176
are genetically and
environmentally as close to you

00:35:48.176 --> 00:35:52.998
as if they were related,
who you are intimately familiar

00:35:52.998 --> 00:35:56.424
with?
Are those the humans that you

00:35:56.424 --> 00:35:59.170
find the hottest?
[laughter] No.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:07.750
They're your siblings and they
are not hot.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.891
[laughter]
I was on Google Images this

00:36:09.891 --> 00:36:13.327
morning.
I put up some hot siblings

00:36:13.327 --> 00:36:20.360
and--but--although we may find
them hot, they do not typically,

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.719
with some rare and bizarre
exceptions, find [laughter]

00:36:23.719 --> 00:36:27.599
one another hot.
Why not?

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:32.084
Well, this is not a huge puzzle
from the standpoint of

00:36:32.084 --> 00:36:35.739
evolutionary biology.
Evolutionary biology posits

00:36:35.739 --> 00:36:39.286
that humans, as well as other
animals, should have incest

00:36:39.286 --> 00:36:41.962
avoidance.
We should love--we should be

00:36:41.962 --> 00:36:45.137
attracted to those familiar to
us, similar to us,

00:36:45.137 --> 00:36:46.990
close to us,
but not kin.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.530
Kin are off limits.
There is a good reason why.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:56.304
Because if you inter-mate with
your kin you have bad offspring

00:36:56.304 --> 00:37:00.091
[laughter]
and so animals should be wired

00:37:00.091 --> 00:37:04.382
up not to mate with their kin.
And in fact,

00:37:04.382 --> 00:37:09.313
this is what happens.
There are--Parents of teenagers

00:37:09.313 --> 00:37:13.936
have all sorts of concerns.
And a lot of the concerns are,

00:37:13.936 --> 00:37:16.529
in fact, sexual.
How do you keep your son and/or

00:37:16.529 --> 00:37:19.604
your daughter from going out and
having sex with too many people,

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:21.670
or the wrong people,
or unprotected sex?

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.981
But there are no parenting
guides in the world that say

00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:28.292
"How do you keep your children
from having sex with one

00:37:28.292 --> 00:37:29.665
another?"
[laughter]

00:37:29.665 --> 00:37:33.118
You typically do not need to
because they do not want to have

00:37:33.118 --> 00:37:36.527
sex with one another.
Now, this is--actually also

00:37:36.527 --> 00:37:40.733
illustrates the difference
between proximate and ultimate

00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:43.837
causation.
So, you think for yourself,

00:37:43.837 --> 00:37:45.599
"Eew.
Do I want to have sex with my

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.401
sister?"
You don't think to yourself,

00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:50.055
"I would prefer not to,
for the offspring that we will

00:37:50.055 --> 00:37:52.558
create will be nonviable and
it'll be a waste of my

00:37:52.558 --> 00:37:55.438
reproductive efforts."
Rather, you think,

00:37:55.438 --> 00:37:59.090
"Eew," because at a gut level
you respond.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:03.850
And this sort of instinctive
response is what you get from an

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:08.300
evolutionary analysis of sex.
But this story is deeply

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:13.443
incomplete because the question
that gets raised is "how do you

00:38:13.443 --> 00:38:16.342
tell?"
You don't want to have sex with

00:38:16.342 --> 00:38:19.050
your kin but how do you tell
your kin?

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:23.740
People don't carry their DNA
markers on strips that you could

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.144
see.
How do you tell who your kin

00:38:26.144 --> 00:38:28.200
are?
And this actually turns out to

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.139
be a really interesting
question.

00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:34.909
It used--And some research
suggests that the answer is

00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:37.911
simple.
You avoid sex with people you

00:38:37.911 --> 00:38:40.889
grew up with.
And these studies actually come

00:38:40.889 --> 00:38:44.110
from kibbutz studies,
studies where people are raised

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.340
communally on an Israeli
kibbutz.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:50.656
They know they're not related,
but still, the fact that they

00:38:50.656 --> 00:38:55.045
were raised together as kids
suggests that there's a cue at a

00:38:55.045 --> 00:38:58.630
gut level not to be attracted to
one another.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.050
It turns out there's some
reason now to believe this story

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.616
is incomplete.
A paper that came out in

00:39:04.616 --> 00:39:08.430
Nature five days ago
reported a series of extremely

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:12.416
interesting studies.
And they found that the cue of

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:16.739
being raised together as a child
with somebody--yes,

00:39:16.739 --> 00:39:20.946
that does diminish sexual
desire, but an even bigger cue

00:39:20.946 --> 00:39:23.699
was "did you observe your
parents,

00:39:23.699 --> 00:39:25.340
and in particular,
your mother,

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.909
taking care of that person?"
If you did, that seriously

00:39:28.909 --> 00:39:33.213
diminishes sexual desire and
brings it down to the level of

00:39:33.213 --> 00:39:36.323
disgust.
And again, these are the sort

00:39:36.323 --> 00:39:40.829
of questions and issues you
begin to ask when you approach

00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:44.230
things from an evolutionary
perspective.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.140
Okay.

00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:52.448
For this lecture--the rest of
this lecture and then the next

00:39:52.448 --> 00:39:55.294
couple of lectures,
I'll be discussing some basic

00:39:55.294 --> 00:39:58.690
aspects of human nature that
are, to some extent or another,

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:03.702
informed by evolutionary theory.
And what I want to start for

00:40:03.702 --> 00:40:09.219
the remainder of this lecture is
a discussion of rationality.

00:40:09.219 --> 00:40:13.877
Now, some of you maybe not want
to go into--not want to go into

00:40:13.877 --> 00:40:18.309
psychology because there's no
Nobel Prize for psychology.

00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:20.610
You might all think,
"Hey, if I'm going to go into

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.300
the sciences I want a Nobel
Prize.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.060
Think how proud Bubby and Zadie
would be if I won a Nobel Prize.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:32.690
Wouldn't that be the best?"
You can get one.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:35.130
Psychologists have won the
Nobel Prize.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.755
Most recently,
Danny Kahneman won a Nobel

00:40:37.755 --> 00:40:39.812
Prize.
You win it in economics,

00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:42.409
sometimes medicine;
not a big deal.

00:40:42.409 --> 00:40:48.009
He won it for his work done
over the course of many decades

00:40:48.009 --> 00:40:51.996
on human rationality.
And this work was done in

00:40:51.996 --> 00:40:56.305
collaboration with Amos Tversky,
who passed away several years

00:40:56.305 --> 00:40:59.201
ago.
And this work entirely

00:40:59.201 --> 00:41:05.642
transformed the way we think
about human decision-making and

00:41:05.642 --> 00:41:08.850
rationality.
Kahneman and Tversky caused a

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:11.557
revolution in economics,
psychology, and the social

00:41:11.557 --> 00:41:15.226
sciences more generally,
by causing us to shift from the

00:41:15.226 --> 00:41:18.928
idea that we're logical
thinkers, who think in accord

00:41:18.928 --> 00:41:23.199
with the axioms of logic and
mathematics and rationality,

00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:27.513
more towards the idea that we
actually have sort of rough and

00:41:27.513 --> 00:41:30.925
ready heuristics.
These heuristics served us well

00:41:30.925 --> 00:41:34.094
during the time--during our
evolutionary history,

00:41:34.094 --> 00:41:36.800
but sometimes they can lead us
astray.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.449
And I want to give some
examples of these heuristics.

00:41:40.449 --> 00:41:45.626
And I'll give four examples of
heuristics that are argued to

00:41:45.626 --> 00:41:49.630
permeate our reasoning.
The first is "framing effects."

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:54.492
This was a classic study by
Kahneman and Tversky involving

00:41:54.492 --> 00:41:56.874
this sort of question.
The U.S.

00:41:56.874 --> 00:41:59.260
is preparing for the outbreak
of a disease that's going to

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.119
kill six hundred people.
There are two programs.

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:05.969
Program A: If you follow it two
hundred people will be saved.

00:42:05.969 --> 00:42:10.186
Program B: There's a one-third
chance everybody will be saved

00:42:10.186 --> 00:42:13.420
and a two-third chance nobody
will be saved.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.900
Who would choose program B?

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.960
Who would choose program A?
Okay.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.170
And that fits the responses.
Most people choose program A.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:30.393
That's--It could go either way.
What's interesting is if you

00:42:30.393 --> 00:42:34.353
frame the question differently,
like this, you get very

00:42:34.353 --> 00:42:37.527
different responses.
And instead of focusing on the

00:42:37.527 --> 00:42:40.106
people who will be saved,
you focus on the people who

00:42:40.106 --> 00:42:41.901
will die and,
instead of focusing on the

00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:44.250
chance that nobody will die and
the chance that everybody will

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:46.101
die,
you'd flip it around,

00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:50.630
you get a corresponding flip.
And this is known as a "framing

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.891
effect."
The idea of a framing effect is

00:42:53.891 --> 00:42:57.920
that you could respond
differently to a situation

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.530
depending on how the options are
framed.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.594
And, in particular,
this combines with "loss

00:43:04.594 --> 00:43:08.610
aversion."
People hate a certain loss.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.830
"Four thousand of these people
will die" is extremely aversive

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.289
and so the framing can influence
your decisions.

00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:20.103
And clever advertisers and
clever decision makers will

00:43:20.103 --> 00:43:24.061
frame things in different ways
to give you--give rise to

00:43:24.061 --> 00:43:27.431
different intuitions.
Sometimes this could be fairly

00:43:27.431 --> 00:43:29.783
simple.
So, you have this ad of a

00:43:29.783 --> 00:43:34.502
hamburger that's eighty percent
fat free versus twenty percent

00:43:34.502 --> 00:43:39.066
fat--You don't have to be a
brilliant ad executive to figure

00:43:39.066 --> 00:43:44.432
out which one to go for.
It turns out that this sort of

00:43:44.432 --> 00:43:49.636
fundamental act – the
fundamental role of framing

00:43:49.636 --> 00:43:53.800
effects – is not limited to
humans.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.667
So, I want to take a second and
tell you some work done by my

00:43:57.667 --> 00:44:00.889
colleague, Laurie Santos,
with capuchin monkeys.

00:44:00.889 --> 00:44:05.233
And what she does is she takes
these capuchin monkeys and she

00:44:05.233 --> 00:44:09.647
teaches them to use money.
She teaches them to use little

00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:14.343
discs to buy themselves either
pieces of banana or pieces of

00:44:14.343 --> 00:44:16.409
apple.
And they like to eat this.

00:44:16.409 --> 00:44:19.896
And they very quickly learn you
can hand over a disc to get some

00:44:19.896 --> 00:44:21.170
banana or some apple.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.795
[laughter]
Now, Dr.

00:44:41.795 --> 00:44:45.002
Santos and her colleagues have
done many studies using this

00:44:45.002 --> 00:44:48.098
method, but the study I'm
interested in illustrating here

00:44:48.098 --> 00:44:51.139
shows framing effects in these
nonhuman primates.

00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:54.699
So, what she does is--There's
two options.

00:44:54.699 --> 00:44:58.212
In one option,
the experimenter shows one

00:44:58.212 --> 00:45:03.129
object to the capuchin and
low--and then either gives one

00:45:03.129 --> 00:45:08.325
or two--half the time gives one,
half the time gives two,

00:45:08.325 --> 00:45:11.210
for an average of one and a
half.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:15.469
The other experimenter does
exactly the same thing;

00:45:15.469 --> 00:45:17.926
gives one or two for an average
of one and a half,

00:45:17.926 --> 00:45:21.170
but starts off displaying two.
Now, if you weren't a human,

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.099
how would you feel about these
two experimenters?

00:45:24.099 --> 00:45:26.050
They both give you the same
amount.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.560
And capuchins are extremely
sensitive to how much they get,

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.768
but it turns out as predicted
they don't like the pink

00:45:32.768 --> 00:45:36.278
experimenter because the pink
experimenter is--he gives you

00:45:36.278 --> 00:45:39.909
two--shows you two and half the
time he gives you one.

00:45:39.909 --> 00:45:43.633
This guy shows you one,
and half the time gives you

00:45:43.633 --> 00:45:46.455
two.
And over time they develop a

00:45:46.455 --> 00:45:51.800
preference for the experimenter
that shows them one initially,

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.423
suggesting that they are being
subject to framing effects or

00:45:55.423 --> 00:45:57.880
choices relative to a reference
point.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.655
A different sort of
demonstration is the "endowment

00:46:01.655 --> 00:46:03.809
effect."
This is a robust and very

00:46:03.809 --> 00:46:07.619
interesting effect.
Here's the idea.

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:11.852
I show you something like a cup
or a chocolate bar and I say,

00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:15.519
"How much will you give me for
this chocolate bar?

00:46:15.519 --> 00:46:16.619
It looks like you're pretty
hungry.

00:46:16.619 --> 00:46:18.190
How much will you give me for
this chocolate bar?"

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.500
And you say,
"I'll give you two dollars for

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.003
this chocolate bar."
Most people on average give

00:46:23.003 --> 00:46:26.019
two--the chocolate bar--gives
two dollars for a chocolate bar.

00:46:26.019 --> 00:46:29.284
The other condition's exactly
the same except I hand you a

00:46:29.284 --> 00:46:32.204
chocolate bar and say,
"How much money will you sell

00:46:32.204 --> 00:46:35.947
me that chocolate bar for?"
There, people say,

00:46:35.947 --> 00:46:41.742
"Two fifty," and in fact,
what happens is once you own

00:46:41.742 --> 00:46:46.610
something its value shoots up.
And this has mystified

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.519
economists and psychologists.
It makes no sense.

00:46:49.519 --> 00:46:51.639
The chocolate bar doesn't even
have to move.

00:46:51.639 --> 00:46:54.363
I just leave it on the table
and say either "How much will

00:46:54.363 --> 00:46:56.800
you spend," "How much will you
give me for this?"

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.329
or "Okay.
It's yours.

00:46:58.329 --> 00:47:00.750
How much do you want for me to
take it back?"

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:05.312
The answer is, it's framing.
If you're asking how much you

00:47:05.312 --> 00:47:08.940
want for it, it's a game.
It's just how much will you pay

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.138
to get something.
But if you're being asked how

00:47:12.138 --> 00:47:16.825
much do you want for me to take
it from you, you treat it as a

00:47:16.825 --> 00:47:19.618
loss.
And as a loss it becomes more

00:47:19.618 --> 00:47:23.260
valuable.
Those are framing effects.

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.699
The second example is base
rates.

00:47:25.699 --> 00:47:28.771
There are seventy
lawyers--sorry,

00:47:28.771 --> 00:47:34.244
seventy engineers and thirty
lawyers and John is chosen at

00:47:34.244 --> 00:47:36.956
random.
Let me tell you about John:

00:47:36.956 --> 00:47:39.410
forty-years old,
married, three children,

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.680
conservative,
cautious, no interest in

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.737
politics, awkward around people.
His hobbies include carpentry,

00:47:45.737 --> 00:47:48.179
sailing, and solving
mathematical puzzles,

00:47:48.179 --> 00:47:49.490
like online dating.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:54.850
[laughter]
What do you think John is?

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:57.860
A lawyer or an engineer?
Who thinks he's a lawyer?

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.220
Good.
Who thinks he's an engineer?

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.258
Okay.
Most people think he's an

00:48:04.258 --> 00:48:07.380
engineer, but here's the thing.
You switch it.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.454
Right?
Thirty engineers,

00:48:08.454 --> 00:48:11.280
seventy lawyers?
It doesn't change.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.496
People--No matter what this
number is--these numbers--it

00:48:14.496 --> 00:48:18.122
doesn't seem to change who you
think he is or how confident you

00:48:18.122 --> 00:48:20.368
are.
People look at John as an

00:48:20.368 --> 00:48:24.565
individual and they ignore the
background status of where he

00:48:24.565 --> 00:48:27.289
came from.
They ignore base rates.

00:48:27.289 --> 00:48:31.745
Base rates are very difficult
to think about and I want to

00:48:31.745 --> 00:48:36.153
give you an example of this.
And the example will be on the

00:48:36.153 --> 00:48:40.211
slides for when you print them
out--print it out because you

00:48:40.211 --> 00:48:43.099
might want to work through it
yourself.

00:48:43.099 --> 00:48:44.550
But I'll give this to you
quickly.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.716
There's a disease that hits one
in a thousand people,

00:48:47.716 --> 00:48:50.981
a pretty common disease.
There's a test for the disease

00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:53.783
and if you have it,
it's going to tell you you have

00:48:53.783 --> 00:48:55.769
it.
It tests for a certain thing in

00:48:55.769 --> 00:48:58.962
your blood and "boom," if the
thing is in your blood the test

00:48:58.962 --> 00:49:00.670
will go "boom."
If you have it,

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:04.000
it will tell you you have it.
It doesn't miss.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.170
On the other hand,
it's not perfect.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:08.300
It has a false positive rate of
five percent.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.079
So, if you don't have the
disease, five percent of the

00:49:11.079 --> 00:49:13.019
time the test will say you have
it.

00:49:13.019 --> 00:49:18.210
So, if the test says you don't
have it, you're fine.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:21.881
But if the test says you have
it, maybe you have it but maybe

00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:25.200
it's a false positive.
You take the test.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.897
It says you have the disease.
Without pen and paper,

00:49:28.897 --> 00:49:33.020
how likely do you think the
odds are you have the disease?

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.369
Who says over fifty percent?
Okay.

00:49:41.369 --> 00:49:44.396
Before people sinisterly
shouted the right answer,

00:49:44.396 --> 00:49:47.670
people will tend--medical
students were given this,

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:51.226
medical students less savvy
than you, and the average is

00:49:51.226 --> 00:49:54.329
between fifty percent and
ninety-five percent.

00:49:54.329 --> 00:49:57.143
The answer is,
as some people quickly noted,

00:49:57.143 --> 00:50:02.289
two percent.
And here's how it works.

00:50:02.289 --> 00:50:04.360
One percent of a thousand will
have the disease.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.219
That person will test positive.
The test never misses.

00:50:07.219 --> 00:50:09.199
That leaves nine hundred
ninety-nine people who don't

00:50:09.199 --> 00:50:10.799
have the disease,
and we'll say about fifty

00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:14.089
percent of these people have it.
So, for every fifty-one people

00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:17.223
who test positive,
only one will have the disease,

00:50:17.223 --> 00:50:19.909
giving an average of about two
percent.

00:50:19.909 --> 00:50:22.340
This sort of thing is very
difficult.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:26.000
Our minds are not evolved to do
base rate computation.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.045
And so, any problems involving
base rate computation,

00:50:29.045 --> 00:50:33.164
including real world problems,
like what to do when you come

00:50:33.164 --> 00:50:36.260
back with a positive test,
we screw up.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.369
And often we screw up in the
direction of panic.

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:42.269
The third bias is the
"availability bias."

00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:45.981
And this is simply that if you
want to know how frequent

00:50:45.981 --> 00:50:48.883
something is,
how available it is to come to

00:50:48.883 --> 00:50:53.880
mind is an excellent cue.
But this could lead to mistakes.

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.466
A classic example by Kahneman
and Tversky is you ask

00:50:57.466 --> 00:51:01.897
people--one group of people how
many English words end with "ng"

00:51:01.897 --> 00:51:04.710
or what proportion of English
words,

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:09.730
another group of people what
proportion end with "ing."

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:13.774
It turns out you get much
bigger numbers for "ing" than

00:51:13.774 --> 00:51:17.369
"ng" though, of course "ng" has
to--"ing"--sorry,

00:51:17.369 --> 00:51:20.739
"ng" would include everything
with "ing."

00:51:20.739 --> 00:51:25.960
It's just a lot easier to think
about these things.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.309
This can show up in the real
world.

00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:30.843
What are your risk of getting
killed--What's your risk of

00:51:30.843 --> 00:51:34.471
getting killed by a shark?
Well, if you ask people what

00:51:34.471 --> 00:51:38.435
their risk of getting killed by
a shark is, they

00:51:38.435 --> 00:51:41.639
characteristically overestimate
it.

00:51:41.639 --> 00:51:44.859
I will give you the news of
what the risk is for getting

00:51:44.859 --> 00:51:48.528
killed by a shark.
Injured in any given year:

00:51:48.528 --> 00:51:52.565
one in six million.
Killed: one in five hundred

00:51:52.565 --> 00:51:54.712
million.
If you live in Florida,

00:51:54.712 --> 00:51:58.225
which apparently is Shark
Central, your chance of getting

00:51:58.225 --> 00:52:00.860
injured is about one in a half
million.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.659
People will overestimate the
risks because shark attacks are

00:52:05.659 --> 00:52:08.101
very salient.
They are always reported in the

00:52:08.101 --> 00:52:09.480
news and they're very
interesting.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.980
What is the chance of getting
killed by potato salad?

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.893
[laughter]
Well, food poisoning,

00:52:15.893 --> 00:52:19.166
death by food poisoning,
injury by food poisoning runs

00:52:19.166 --> 00:52:24.221
to about one in fifty-five,
one in 800 for some sort of

00:52:24.221 --> 00:52:31.587
injury and one in 55,000 killed.
Potato salad is 1,000 more

00:52:31.587 --> 00:52:37.150
times more dangerous than shark
attacks.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:39.813
But you get it wrong because
you don't think,

00:52:39.813 --> 00:52:41.630
"Oh, my God,
big news story.

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:45.268
Somebody dies by potato salad."
[laughter]

00:52:45.268 --> 00:52:50.542
And so, we tend to overestimate
the chance of being killed by

00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:53.727
dramatic effects.
How many Jews in the United

00:52:53.727 --> 00:52:57.269
States, what proportion?
Who thinks it's over three

00:52:57.269 --> 00:53:00.769
quarters of the United States is
Jewish?

00:53:00.769 --> 00:53:01.730
[laughter]
I'm kind of anchoring here.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:02.700
Okay.
Okay.

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:09.650
Who thinks over half?
Who thinks over forty percent?

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:12.730
Who thinks over twenty percent?
Okay.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:17.539
Who thinks over fifteen percent?
Who thinks over ten percent?

00:53:17.539 --> 00:53:21.650
Who thinks over seven and
one-half percent?

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:24.420
Who thinks over five percent?
Okay.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.199
Who thinks overall there's more
than five percent of the United

00:53:27.199 --> 00:53:28.230
States that's Jewish?

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:38.411
Who thinks over three percent?
The answer is somewhere between

00:53:38.411 --> 00:53:42.445
1.9 and 2.1%.
Most people think--The average

00:53:42.445 --> 00:53:45.659
American thinks it's twenty
percent.

00:53:45.659 --> 00:53:48.707
There is-- [laughter]
If you're curious about

00:53:48.707 --> 00:53:51.269
demographics,
and this map isn't to be

00:53:51.269 --> 00:53:54.940
entirely trusted because I got
it from Wikipedia,

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.316
[laughter]
this is the distribution of the

00:53:57.316 --> 00:53:59.983
Jewish population,
self-identified as Jewish in

00:53:59.983 --> 00:54:02.360
different parts of the United
States.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.311
[laughter]
New York City is,

00:54:04.311 --> 00:54:08.430
of course, the most dense
population with nine percent.

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:14.560
New Haven has 3.5%.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:24.201
Now, why do people get it wrong?
Well, there's all sorts of

00:54:24.201 --> 00:54:26.635
reasons and this is going to
come out in the context of

00:54:26.635 --> 00:54:29.248
social psychology when we talk
about how people think about

00:54:29.248 --> 00:54:33.088
human groups.
But one quick answer is people

00:54:33.088 --> 00:54:38.539
who are plainly Jewish are
prominent in positions where

00:54:38.539 --> 00:54:42.527
people notice them,
like entertainment or,

00:54:42.527 --> 00:54:45.340
in the case of you guys,
academia.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.130
And this could lead to--this
availability-- "Can I think of a

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:52.070
Jew?
Yeah."

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:55.208
[laughter]
This availability causes us to

00:54:55.208 --> 00:54:59.838
overestimate the proportion to
which Jews are represented in

00:54:59.838 --> 00:55:03.320
the population.
Final example.

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:07.443
Confirmation bias.
This is a very nice study and

00:55:07.443 --> 00:55:11.447
it's very simple.
It's--You're in a jury of a

00:55:11.447 --> 00:55:14.472
custody case.
You have to give a child

00:55:14.472 --> 00:55:18.030
custody – either a mother or
father sole custody.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:20.468
One parent has average income,
average health,

00:55:20.468 --> 00:55:23.123
average working hours,
reasonable rapport with the

00:55:23.123 --> 00:55:25.670
child, and a relatively stable
social life.

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:28.158
The second parent has an
above-average income,

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:31.090
minor health problems,
lots of work-related travel,

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:33.639
a very close relationship with
the travel--with the child,

00:55:33.639 --> 00:55:35.340
and an extremely active social
life.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.699
Think for a moment.
Who would you award custody

00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:38.899
with?
There's no--Obviously,

00:55:38.899 --> 00:55:42.730
there's no right answer here.
Just think for a moment.

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.789
Who would award custody to
parent A?

00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:49.340
Who would award custody to
parent B?

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.722
Okay.
As I think there is in this

00:55:52.722 --> 00:55:58.056
room, when this study is done
there's a slight advantage to

00:55:58.056 --> 00:56:01.519
parent B.
Here's what's interesting.

00:56:01.519 --> 00:56:04.909
You give another group of
people this question.

00:56:04.909 --> 00:56:07.900
"Which parent would you deny
custody to?"

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:11.210
You get a slight advantage for
parent B.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:14.546
Now, this is to some extent an
illustration of framing problem

00:56:14.546 --> 00:56:17.827
but it's also a more general
illustration of the confirmation

00:56:17.827 --> 00:56:19.943
bias.
So, when you're asked to award

00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:22.920
custody to, you then ask,
"Well, what is a good--what is

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.139
a sign that somebody's a good
parent?"

00:56:25.139 --> 00:56:28.559
And the good parent aspects of
B jump out.

00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:30.531
When asking about denying
custody you ask,

00:56:30.531 --> 00:56:32.840
"Where is a cue that somebody's
a bad parent?"

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:37.409
And the bad parent aspects of B
jump out.

00:56:37.409 --> 00:56:40.260
In general, when we have a
hypothesis we look for

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.783
confirmations.
This makes some things,

00:56:42.783 --> 00:56:46.341
which are logically easy
extremely difficult problems

00:56:46.341 --> 00:56:49.010
when we face them in the real
world.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:52.747
And I'll end with my final
example, that of the Wason

00:56:52.747 --> 00:56:55.230
selection task.
Here's the game.

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:59.500
And people--I don't want people
to shout it out just yet.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.898
There is four cards.
Each card has a letter on one

00:57:03.898 --> 00:57:07.150
side and a number on the other
side.

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:12.590
You have to judge whether this
claim is true or false.

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:17.379
"If a card has a 'D' on one
side, it has a '3' on the other

00:57:17.379 --> 00:57:20.657
side."
How many cards do you have to

00:57:20.657 --> 00:57:24.810
turn over to test whether that
rule is right?

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.311
Okay.
Somebody shout out what one

00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:30.850
card is you have to turn over.
"D."

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.980
Everybody gets that right.
What else?

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:34.920
Do you need to do any other
cards?

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.060
How many people think it's "D"
and "3"?

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:46.577
I'm raising my hand to fool you.
[laughter]

00:57:46.577 --> 00:57:52.560
People answer either "D" or "D"
and "3" but think about it.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:56.250
What would make this rule wrong?
It's wrong if it has "D" on one

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:58.420
side and not "3" on the other.
Right?

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.050
That's what it would be to be
wrong.

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:03.062
You then would have to check
"D" to see if there is a "3" on

00:58:03.062 --> 00:58:05.320
the other side.
You were all right about that.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.882
That means you'd check "8" to
see if there's a "D" on the

00:58:08.882 --> 00:58:11.214
other side.
"Three's" not going to tell you

00:58:11.214 --> 00:58:14.840
anything.
That's hard.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.040
People find this very hard.
Okay.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.931
Big deal.
But what's interesting is you

00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:23.690
can modify it in certain ways to
make it a lot easier.

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:26.631
And this is the work of Leda
Cosmides and her colleague,

00:58:26.631 --> 00:58:29.786
an evolutionary psychologist at
Santa Barbara who has argued

00:58:29.786 --> 00:58:32.460
that if you frame these
questions in ways that make

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.199
ecological sense,
people are much better at them.

00:58:35.199 --> 00:58:38.546
And basically,
she does studies where she has

00:58:38.546 --> 00:58:41.740
people who are evaluating a
social rule.

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:46.000
Imagine these cards.
On one side of the card is an

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.901
alcohol--is a drink.
On the other side is a person's

00:58:51.901 --> 00:58:53.959
age.
You are a bartender and you

00:58:53.959 --> 00:58:56.750
want to make sure nobody under
twenty-one drinks beer.

00:58:56.750 --> 00:59:02.773
Which cards do you turn over?
Well, now it's easier but the

00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:05.530
logic is the same.
It's a violation that there's

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:08.010
"under twenty-one" on one side,
"beer" on the other side,

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:12.456
so you need to check the "under
twenty-one" here and you need to

00:59:12.456 --> 00:59:16.895
check the "beer" here.
And when you make these logical

00:59:16.895 --> 00:59:22.740
problems more ecologically valid
they turn out to be much easier.

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.670
Okay.

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:33.826
There's a little bit more but
I'll hold it off until next

00:59:33.826 --> 00:59:36.901
class.
And I'll end with the reading

00:59:36.901 --> 00:59:41.889
response, which is to do your
own bit of reverse engineering

00:59:41.889 --> 00:59:47.547
and evolutionary psychology.
And I'll see you all on

00:59:47.547 --> 00:59:48.547
Wednesday.

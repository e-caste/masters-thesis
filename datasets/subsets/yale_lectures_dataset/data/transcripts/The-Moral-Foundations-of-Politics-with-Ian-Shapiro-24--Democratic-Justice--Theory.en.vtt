00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.835
Prof: We ended last time
by talking about the sense in

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.900
which Schumpeter's competitive
democracy is minimalist,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.050
and I said that it is in an
important sense minimalist.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.812
It's linked to this idea of the
competitive struggle for power

00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:24.652
and the notion that turfing the
rascals out is the sine qua non

00:00:24.652 --> 00:00:26.760
of democratic politics.
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.267
There's one respect in which
even if this is a minimal

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:39.898
requirement it's nonetheless a
very substantial minimal

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:47.880
requirement in that the way it
has been operationalized as...

00:00:47.880 --> 00:02:25.949
&gt;
 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:29.639
Professor Ian Shapiro:
So the basic issue was,

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.660
is this conception of democracy
too minimalist?

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.310
It is minimalist in an
important sense in that it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.341
reduces democracy to this
competitive struggle for the

00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:42.710
people's vote.
 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.863
I said there's one respect in
which it clearly is not

00:02:46.863 --> 00:02:50.857
minimalist which is that if
one's expectation is as

00:02:50.857 --> 00:02:55.649
Huntington and others would come
to argue later that we can't

00:02:55.649 --> 00:03:00.600
call a country a democracy until
there've been two turnovers of

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.718
power.
 

00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:06.490
That means the US was not a
democracy until 1840.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.560
Japan has only recently become
a democracy.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.860
Countries like South Africa are
not yet democracies or at least

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.229
we can't say they are because we
don't know what would happen if

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:24.098
the ANC lost an election,
so minimalist not negligible.

00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:29.214
And I think that for those who
complain that Schumpeterian

00:03:29.214 --> 00:03:34.867
democracy is too minimalist try
living in a country that doesn't

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:39.443
have it and you will find that
minimal is indeed not

00:03:39.443 --> 00:03:40.970
negligible.
 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.926
Still you might say that raises
the question of what it is that

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:51.060
we can reasonably expect from
democracy,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.420
because most people typically
expect more from democracy than

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.460
just the turnover of government.
 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.615
If we go back to the large
themes of this course remember

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:07.548
that when I introduced the
subject of democracy and we

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:11.628
looked at Plato and
Tocqueville's critiques of it,

00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:17.149
we really were left wondering,
"Well why would anyone

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:22.185
think that if protecting
individual rights and basing

00:04:22.185 --> 00:04:26.834
politics on scientific
principles of truth is the

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:31.266
answer,
why would we want to pursue

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:37.420
democracy as the goal to
achieving that answer?"

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.459
But if you now take a step back
and ask, "Well,

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:44.930
compared to what?"
 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.069
democracy starts to look pretty
good.

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:53.877
Because what we have seen in
the literature on democracy is

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:59.985
that no other political system
does a better job of protecting

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:02.189
individual rights.
 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.891
We saw that Madison was greatly
concerned with the separation of

00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:10.550
power and the creation of we
might call republican

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.362
constraints on democracy,
but the literature from the

00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:16.459
twentieth century has
established,

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:20.189
principally by Bob Dahl but
also from many others,

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:26.560
that if you look at the
addition of judicial review,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.829
it's just not something that
lawyers like to hear,

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:33.750
but if you look at the addition
of judicial review to democratic

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.029
politics it doesn't really add
anything.

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.961
That is to say the way in which
empirically rights are best

00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:44.420
protected is by creating
Schumpeterian democracy.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.057
Adding judicial review on top
of that doesn't seem to make any

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:54.000
difference as far as preserving
individual rights is concerned.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.519
The big thing is to get and
keep democracy,

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.490
not to get and keep judicial
review,

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.089
and I think that is reflected
in the fact that separation of

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:07.596
powers,
at the end of the day,

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:11.601
is words upon a parchment
whereas the pluralism that

00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:16.392
guarantees competitive politics
is embedded in the society and

00:06:16.392 --> 00:06:21.026
that is ultimately the guarantor
of freedom under democratic

00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:22.439
conditions.
 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.259
If we think about the truth
coming out in politics,

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.107
finding a political system that
as Mill would have it could best

00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:34.884
track the truth,
again what we find when we

00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:39.250
asked the question
"compared to what?"

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.420
democracy does better than the
going alternatives.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.918
You can think of Schumpeterian
competition as

00:06:47.918 --> 00:06:54.459
institutionalizing Mill's demand
that we have to have competition

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:55.790
of ideas.
 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.480
Remember how Mill got from
freedom to utility through his

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.170
idea of the truth coming out of
competitive argument,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.067
not deliberation,
not sitting around and

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:12.903
contemplating things together,
but people having to argue for

00:07:12.903 --> 00:07:17.668
their views and defend them on
the grounds that they can meet

00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:20.449
the objections of their critics.
 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.896
And so Schumpeterianism is a
kind of institutionalization of

00:07:25.896 --> 00:07:31.343
the competitive argumentative
ideal that Mill talks about in

00:07:31.343 --> 00:07:37.160
the long chapter on freedom of
speech in On Liberty.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.646
And so, again,
when we say "compared to

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:40.399
what?"
 

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:45.291
democracy does better than the
going alternatives in preserving

00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.788
the freedom of speech and the
competition of ideas that is

00:07:49.788 --> 00:07:54.050
likely to make the truth come
out in the long run.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.887
So, despite the fears of Plato
and Tocqueville when we pose the

00:07:58.887 --> 00:08:02.009
question "compared to
what?"

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:06.826
democracy does better than the
going alternatives in

00:08:06.826 --> 00:08:10.699
vindicating these Enlightenment
ideals.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.622
As Churchill said,
"Democracy is the worst

00:08:13.622 --> 00:08:17.560
system of government except for
the others that have been tried

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.339
from time to time."
 

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:24.572
Now you could buy everything
I've just said now but still

00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:30.178
feel that this is too minimalist
a conception of democracy to

00:08:30.178 --> 00:08:35.785
meet the sort of expectations
that people have when they make

00:08:35.785 --> 00:08:41.580
demands for the creation of
democracy in the real world.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.320
And I think there's merit to
that objection,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.820
and these last two lectures are
designed to address it to the

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.570
extent that I think it's
possible to address it.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:57.083
If we think about the
conditions under which people

00:08:57.083 --> 00:09:01.195
demand democracy,
they're usually conditions

00:09:01.195 --> 00:09:06.340
under which people have a strong
experience of injustice.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.751
So those of us who were around
in the 1980s would hear

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:17.370
objections from behind the iron
curtain to communism.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.760
People didn't like communism,
and what they demanded was

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.720
democracy.
 

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.350
Or if you go to apartheid South
Africa what you find is,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:34.393
again, people find themselves
appalled by and rejecting of

00:09:34.393 --> 00:09:37.519
apartheid,
but what do they demand?

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:40.038
They demand democracy.
 

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:44.322
Now, if in either of those
instances you went to those

00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:47.724
people,
those anti-communists who were

00:09:47.724 --> 00:09:52.220
demanding democracy in the
former Soviet Union or the

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.976
anti-apartheid activists who
were demanding democracy in

00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:59.693
South Africa,
and you said to them,

00:09:59.693 --> 00:10:02.043
"Well,
tell us what a perfect

00:10:02.043 --> 00:10:06.634
democracy would look like in
Russia or in South Africa,"

00:10:06.634 --> 00:10:10.080
they wouldn't have been able to
tell you,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.528
and I think that that's an
important observation.

00:10:13.528 --> 00:10:18.057
It's an important observation
because it captures a feature of

00:10:18.057 --> 00:10:22.139
human nature that we haven't
commented on very much,

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:26.500
although it came to the surface
in our discussion of MacIntyre,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.740
namely that human beings are
reactive creatures.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.897
They shy away from what does
not work and then fumble in the

00:10:35.897 --> 00:10:41.142
darkness in search of something
that works better or at least

00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:44.288
something that fails less badly.
 

00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:47.821
The famous economist,
Amartya Sen who I mentioned to

00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:50.216
you briefly,
I think, made this point

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:53.215
brilliantly in a new book of his
called The Idea of

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:56.485
Justice,
and it expressed some of his

00:10:56.485 --> 00:11:01.048
frustration with the academic
literature on justice,

00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:04.753
which seems to get caught up in
debating questions that are

00:11:04.753 --> 00:11:08.648
three points to the right of the
decimal without moving on the

00:11:08.648 --> 00:11:10.500
big questions of justice.
 

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.409
And Sen said,
"Imagine that you were

00:11:13.409 --> 00:11:17.265
sitting in a sauna and the
controls for the sauna were

00:11:17.265 --> 00:11:20.538
outside so that you couldn't
reach them,

00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:22.870
and it got hotter,
and hotter, and hotter,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.953
and you were really,
really hot, and you said to the

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:32.000
person who had their hand on the
controls outside the sauna,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.196
'Turn it down.
 

00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:34.820
It's way too hot.'
 

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.457
And his reply was 'Well,
I'm not going to turn it down

00:11:38.457 --> 00:11:42.302
until you tell me what the
optimal temperature is.'"

00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:44.854
And,
of course, what Sen's point is

00:11:44.854 --> 00:11:47.950
you don't know what the optimal
temperature is.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.330
What you know is this is much
too hot.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:55.894
And so I think Sen's little
story in a more imaginative way

00:11:55.894 --> 00:12:01.365
than anything I have come up
captures this idea that human

00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:05.779
beings are reactive creatures
and we say,

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:06.779
"This doesn't work.
 

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:07.610
This doesn't work.
 

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.335
This doesn't work,"
and we're constantly looking

00:12:11.335 --> 00:12:13.700
for something that does better.
 

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.726
And so the fact that
anti-communists in the 1980s

00:12:17.726 --> 00:12:22.089
couldn't describe what a
well-functioning post-Soviet

00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:27.220
democracy would look like,
or the fact that anti-apartheid

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.547
activists in the 1970s and 80s
couldn't characterize a

00:12:31.547 --> 00:12:35.629
democratic South Africa for you
in any detail,

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:40.385
doesn't detract from the fact
that their demands for democracy

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:44.986
captured something about what
they thought was fundamentally

00:12:44.986 --> 00:12:49.120
unacceptable about the existing
state of affairs.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.764
And so people demand democracy
because they experience

00:12:54.764 --> 00:13:00.195
injustice, and they want
justice, and they hope that

00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:03.389
democracy will deliver it.
 

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:08.072
Now some Schumpeterians,
Huntington foremost among them,

00:13:08.072 --> 00:13:11.308
have said, "This is really
bad.

00:13:11.308 --> 00:13:17.360
This is really a bad thing,
because what's going to happen

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:24.155
when people experience injustice
and demand democracy is they are

00:13:24.155 --> 00:13:29.038
inevitably going to be
disappointed."

00:13:29.038 --> 00:13:31.019
Indeed there was a very
interesting poll,

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:35.813
I thought, out of South Africa
on this very point last year

00:13:35.813 --> 00:13:40.940
where they found a majority of
South African Blacks saying,

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:46.860
"Things were better under
apartheid than now."

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.755
But then when asked would they
rather go back to apartheid the

00:13:50.755 --> 00:13:52.798
majority said,
"No."

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:56.270
It captures,
I think, this tension and this

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:00.899
paradoxical expectation that
people have of democracy.

00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:03.820
But the Huntingtonian point
was, "Well,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:09.380
that you would jeopardize
democracy if you get people to

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.730
load too many expectations onto
it."

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.591
This, to some extent,
is defied in the second half of

00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:21.971
that poll I just mentioned to
you because even though people

00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:26.500
say things were better in the
apartheid years they still don't

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.580
want to go back there.
 

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.894
But I think Huntington might
say, "Well,

00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:34.908
eventually things are going to
change.

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:39.753
Eventually when South African
democracy fails to deliver on

00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:43.009
people's expectations about
justice,

00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:48.379
the regime itself is going to
come into jeopardy."

00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:53.636
If you look at South Africa,
just to pursue this example,

00:14:53.636 --> 00:14:58.048
we've now had four elections
since apartheid.

00:14:58.048 --> 00:15:00.710
South Africa is one of the most
unequal countries in the world,

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.970
has one of the highest Gini
coefficients,

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.960
yet the top marginal tax rate
today is lower than it was at

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.940
the end of apartheid.
 

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.558
There hasn't been land reform.
 

00:15:11.558 --> 00:15:16.229
There hasn't been significant
redistribution of income or

00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:16.980
wealth.
 

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.726
There's been the creation of a
small black millionaire class,

00:15:21.726 --> 00:15:26.313
but for the vast majority of
blacks, they're still as badly

00:15:26.313 --> 00:15:28.528
off as they were before.
 

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:32.878
And so the Huntingtonian
thought is that if people load

00:15:32.878 --> 00:15:37.710
expectations onto democracy that
can't be met then when those

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:42.380
expectations are frustrated
eventually the problem is going

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.293
to be that people are going to
blame democracy rather than the

00:15:47.293 --> 00:15:52.206
government of the day and turn
on democracy when some populous

00:15:52.206 --> 00:15:55.830
dictator comes along and
promises,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:00.583
say as we've seen in Zimbabwe,
promises massive land

00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:04.778
redistribution at the expense of
democracy.

00:16:04.778 --> 00:16:09.041
And so the modern
Schumpeterians have tended to

00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:11.456
say,
"We should try and

00:16:11.456 --> 00:16:15.376
disabuse people of their
unrealistic expectations of

00:16:15.376 --> 00:16:20.217
democracy so that we don't lose
at least the minimal benefits of

00:16:20.217 --> 00:16:24.445
competitive democracy which
we've already agreed are not

00:16:24.445 --> 00:16:26.288
negligible."
 

00:16:26.288 --> 00:16:32.288
And so this was presented as a
kind of realist realpolitik take

00:16:32.288 --> 00:16:36.543
on democracy,
that people shouldn't expect it

00:16:36.543 --> 00:16:39.058
to diminish injustice.
 

00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:42.748
The problem with the
Huntingtonian view is that

00:16:42.748 --> 00:16:47.639
people are not going to change
their expectations because some

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:51.570
professor of political science
tells them to.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.192
There are deep-seated reasons
why people turn to democracy

00:16:56.192 --> 00:17:01.561
when they experience injustice,
and are not going to give up on

00:17:01.561 --> 00:17:05.519
the appeal to democracy in order
to remedy it.

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:09.930
And those reasons have to do
with,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:16.125
I think, with the topic we
ended at the very tail end of

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:22.847
last Wednesday's lecture,
is that democracy is motivated,

00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:29.407
the impulse for democracy comes
from the impulse to resist

00:17:29.407 --> 00:17:31.019
domination.
 

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:34.737
And there's a connection
between democracy and fighting

00:17:34.737 --> 00:17:38.593
injustice because both of those
things are connected with

00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:40.588
resistance to domination.
 

00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:45.792
So if we think that the
Schumpeterians are right to say

00:17:45.792 --> 00:17:51.768
that democracy is often going to
fail to deliver on the project

00:17:51.768 --> 00:17:56.871
of diminishing injustice,
but na�ve to think that

00:17:56.871 --> 00:18:02.000
people are therefore going to
stop creating expectations of

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.087
democracy,
that creates a different kind

00:18:05.087 --> 00:18:05.788
of agenda.
 

00:18:05.788 --> 00:18:09.853
That creates the agenda that I
want to talk to you about for

00:18:09.853 --> 00:18:14.400
the rest of today's lecture and
Wednesday's lecture and that is;

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.804
how can we think about
promoting justice by democratic

00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:20.618
means?
 

00:18:20.618 --> 00:18:25.348
Given that people are going to
have expectations from democracy

00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:29.695
the better course is to try and
find institutions that can

00:18:29.695 --> 00:18:32.288
deliver on those expectations.
 

00:18:32.288 --> 00:18:36.607
And I think it's an important
reason not only when we reason

00:18:36.607 --> 00:18:39.901
about democracy,
but also when we reason about

00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:40.779
justice.
 

00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:44.568
Many years ago when I was
teaching this course,

00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:48.440
before I had written
Democratic Justice,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.979
and indeed one of the events
that caused me to write it was a

00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:55.930
question from a student in the
class.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:01.400
I had been teaching Rawls and I
had gone through the principles,

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.000
the difference principle and
all of that,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.617
and I had explained that Rawls
was the most influential

00:19:07.617 --> 00:19:10.500
political philosopher of his
generation,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.538
and that this theory of justice
had completely revolutionized

00:19:14.538 --> 00:19:16.558
modern political philosophy.
 

00:19:16.558 --> 00:19:18.769
And this student put up their
hand and said,

00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:22.210
"Professor Shapiro,
now that Rawls's theory has

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.547
been established,
why hasn't The Constitution

00:19:26.547 --> 00:19:30.308
been changed to include
it?"

00:19:30.308 --> 00:19:32.849
and many of the students in the
class laughed.

00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:35.759
And they laughed why?
 

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.319
Does anyone have a guess?
 

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:40.430
Why do you think people laughed?
 

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.430
It seemed like a na�ve
question, why though?

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:50.316
John Rawls got the answer,
so our Constitution doesn't

00:19:50.316 --> 00:19:55.980
reflect that answer,
why haven't they changed it?

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.069
Why do you think students would
have laughed?

00:20:00.069 --> 00:20:02.328
Yeah?
 

00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:05.195
Student: People think there's a
disconnect sometimes between

00:20:05.195 --> 00:20:08.160
political philosophy and actual
politics and policy-making.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.161
Prof: They think there's
a disconnect between political

00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:14.308
philosophy and actual politics,
but why is there a disconnect?

00:20:14.308 --> 00:20:18.136
I mean, these political
philosophers are trying to get

00:20:18.136 --> 00:20:19.509
the right answer.
 

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:24.011
So let's suppose it's true that
Rawls got the right answer,

00:20:24.011 --> 00:20:26.884
and Nozick didn't,
and Dworkin didn't,

00:20:26.884 --> 00:20:28.670
and Shapiro didn't.
 

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.160
Rawls got the right answer.
 

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.359
He solved the problem.
 

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:35.390
Why don't we just implement it?
 

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.730
This was, after all,
what Bentham thought.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.369
Bentham thought he'd figured it
all out and he went running

00:20:41.369 --> 00:20:44.695
around the world with his
constitutions and was deeply

00:20:44.695 --> 00:20:47.960
disappointed when countries
wouldn't adopt them.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.848
Why do we resist this idea?
 

00:20:52.848 --> 00:20:53.615
Yeah?
 

00:20:53.615 --> 00:20:59.741
At the back,
can we get the microphone to

00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:01.578
the back?
 

00:21:01.578 --> 00:21:04.375
Student:  Because
generally we don't think that

00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:07.433
claims are absolutely true and
we maintain that they can be

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:09.069
proved false in the future.
 

00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:10.630
Claims are fallible.
 

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.712
Prof: So part of it is
the fallibilism of the mature

00:21:14.712 --> 00:21:15.838
Enlightenment.
 

00:21:15.838 --> 00:21:20.058
That people somehow resist the
idea that anybody's got it

00:21:20.058 --> 00:21:24.579
perfectly right in the sense of
getting a geometric proof.

00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:28.269
Anything else? Yeah, over here?
 

00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:30.028
Student: 
&gt;

00:21:30.028 --> 00:21:31.380
Prof: Just hold on a
second.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.200
We want to record what you say
for posterity.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.029
Student:  The democratic
system doesn't change that fast.

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:40.877
I mean, part of the nature of
the system that we have is that

00:21:40.877 --> 00:21:41.779
it's slow moving.
 

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:45.439
Prof: It's slow moving,
yeah, but still why shouldn't

00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:46.058
it move?
 

00:21:46.058 --> 00:21:50.710
The student might say,
"Well yeah,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.420
okay, but so they had these
ideas in the eighteenth century,

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.074
now Rawls has better ideas,
why shouldn't we move to

00:21:57.074 --> 00:21:58.220
Rawls's ideas?"
 

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.500
 
 

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.500
I think there's something that
will make people resist.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.423
There are many people who might
concede that Rawls has a better

00:22:10.423 --> 00:22:13.647
argument than Nozick,
or Dworkin, or Shapiro,

00:22:13.647 --> 00:22:17.361
or any of the other people,
Mill that you've been reading,

00:22:17.361 --> 00:22:20.846
and still want to say it
shouldn't be imposed on the

00:22:20.846 --> 00:22:24.119
society;
that somehow principles of

00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:28.676
justice have to be
democratically legitimated in

00:22:28.676 --> 00:22:33.038
order for us to be forced to
live by them.

00:22:33.038 --> 00:22:37.505
And so I think whether you
start from the justice end and

00:22:37.505 --> 00:22:41.651
you are confronted by this
reality that people demand

00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:45.318
democracy when they experience
injustice,

00:22:45.318 --> 00:22:48.440
or when you start from the
democracy end,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.343
you realize that people are not
going to embrace principles of

00:22:53.343 --> 00:22:58.730
justice unless they can triumph
through democratic institutions,

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:04.173
you realize that pursuing
democracy and justice together

00:23:04.173 --> 00:23:05.660
is important.
 

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.973
After all, as I said to you
when I talked to you about

00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:12.851
Madison,
even though they thought they

00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:16.200
had designed the best
constitution that they could

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.506
agree to at the time nobody had
any illusions that this would be

00:23:20.506 --> 00:23:24.401
acceptable if it had not been
adopted by the people of the

00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:26.108
state of New York.
 

00:23:26.108 --> 00:23:30.108
So having the right answer is
not enough.

00:23:30.108 --> 00:23:33.616
You've got to have the right
answer but convince people

00:23:33.616 --> 00:23:37.125
through democratic mechanisms
that you've got the right

00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:37.838
answer.
 

00:23:37.838 --> 00:23:43.798
So democracy and justice have
to be pursued together.

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:51.116
I said that the animating idea
behind democracy is the appeal

00:23:51.116 --> 00:23:56.897
of resisting domination,
but I think the procedural

00:23:56.897 --> 00:24:02.830
ground rule is what I'm going to
call the principle of affected

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:03.980
interest.
 

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:09.413
And this was nowhere better
articulated than by Nelson

00:24:09.413 --> 00:24:16.180
Mandela in 1962 in his statement
to the court before sentencing.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.152
A little piece of relevant
background that you may not

00:24:20.152 --> 00:24:24.575
know, you don't have to write
this down, I will put it up on

00:24:24.575 --> 00:24:25.700
the server.
 

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.396
A piece of background is that
they had been convicted of

00:24:29.396 --> 00:24:30.068
treason.
 

00:24:30.068 --> 00:24:36.974
The ANC had finally suspended
their peaceful opposition about

00:24:36.974 --> 00:24:42.730
five years earlier and turned to
armed struggle.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.321
And then a number of ANC
leaders had been arrested and

00:24:46.321 --> 00:24:48.558
tried and convicted of treason.
 

00:24:48.558 --> 00:24:53.529
And their attorneys told them
that they were going to get the

00:24:53.529 --> 00:24:56.642
death sentence,
and the only way they could

00:24:56.642 --> 00:24:59.827
possibly avoid the death
sentence was to get up and be

00:24:59.827 --> 00:25:01.868
contrite and beg to be let off.
 

00:25:01.868 --> 00:25:06.038
And the young Nelson Mandela
said,

00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:08.551
"No, I'm not going to do
that," and he stood up and

00:25:08.551 --> 00:25:10.519
he made this famous speech in
which he said,

00:25:10.519 --> 00:25:14.700
"I'm charged with inciting
people to commit an offence by

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:20.028
way of protest against the law,
a law which neither I or any of

00:25:20.028 --> 00:25:23.509
my people had any say in
preparing.

00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:26.770
"But in weighing up the
decision as to the sentence

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.500
which is to be imposed for such
an offence,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.232
the court must take into
account the question of

00:25:32.232 --> 00:25:35.250
responsibility,
whether it is I who is

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.792
responsible or whether,
in fact, a large measure of the

00:25:39.792 --> 00:25:44.326
responsibility does not lie on
the shoulders of the government

00:25:44.326 --> 00:25:47.978
which promulgated that law,
knowing that my people,

00:25:47.978 --> 00:25:51.730
who constitute the majority of
the population of this country,

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.619
were opposed to that law,
and knowing further that every

00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:59.794
legal means of demonstrating
that opposition had been closed

00:25:59.794 --> 00:26:03.599
to them by prior legislation,
and by government

00:26:03.599 --> 00:26:05.990
administrative action."
 

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:11.818
"We played no role in
making the laws that affect us,

00:26:11.818 --> 00:26:14.753
and we have no means of
opposing the laws that affect

00:26:14.753 --> 00:26:18.634
us," is what he was saying,
"and that's why we turned

00:26:18.634 --> 00:26:23.390
to the armed struggle,
and it's not our failing."

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:28.140
Of course the government was
calling them terrorists.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.390
Of course, why wouldn't they
call them terrorists?

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:36.823
But Mandela's position was that
the principle of affected

00:26:36.823 --> 00:26:39.118
interest had been violated.
 

00:26:39.118 --> 00:26:43.490
This notion that I think is
very close to the most

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:48.130
fundamental procedural idea in
democratic theory,

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.108
that people whose interests are
affected by a decision

00:26:52.108 --> 00:26:56.690
presumptively should have some
say in making that decision.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.440
If you think about the Boston
Tea Party,

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.974
which the current Tea Partiers
are trying to piggyback on the

00:27:03.974 --> 00:27:09.248
legitimacy of,
it was the same notion,

00:27:09.248 --> 00:27:15.970
no what without representation,
no what?

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.678
Student:  Taxation..
 

00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:18.880
Prof: Yes.
 

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.640
So it's the same idea that
people who are affected by

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.195
decisions,
if you're going to tax us we

00:27:27.195 --> 00:27:31.624
want to be involved in--
we want to have representation

00:27:31.624 --> 00:27:34.170
in the decisions about taxation.
 

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:40.299
And so it's trying to capture
that idea that I'm talking about

00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:44.220
when I talk about democratic
justice.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:51.273
And I want to describe first a
general argument and then some

00:27:51.273 --> 00:27:52.920
particulars.
 

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:59.210
The first is that this rests on
a broad conception of politics.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.920
What do I mean by a broad
conception of politics?

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.470
Well, consider this fact.
 

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:11.297
When we talk about--those of
you who have read political

00:28:11.297 --> 00:28:16.564
philosophy in the history of the
tradition will know that for

00:28:16.564 --> 00:28:22.006
most of the great theorists of
the past the organization of the

00:28:22.006 --> 00:28:27.798
political system was only one
piece of a theory of politics.

00:28:27.798 --> 00:28:30.193
Plato, Aristotle,
Locke, Mill,

00:28:30.193 --> 00:28:35.150
all of these thinkers thought
that it was important to have a

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.200
theory of family life,
a theory of education,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.838
a theory of how the whole
society operated.

00:28:42.838 --> 00:28:47.114
Politics is not just about what
goes on in buildings in

00:28:47.114 --> 00:28:49.410
Washington and in Hartford.
 

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.430
It was a broad conception of
politics.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:59.926
And one of the criticisms of
much contemporary political

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:06.068
theory has been that it ignores
the broad society.

00:29:06.068 --> 00:29:09.606
So for example,
it was a criticism made of

00:29:09.606 --> 00:29:14.523
Rawls's theory of justice by
feminists that it ignored the

00:29:14.523 --> 00:29:16.940
structure of the family.
 

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:22.440
Rawls talked about heads of
households as the basic

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.818
representative individuals
behind the veil of ignorance.

00:29:28.818 --> 00:29:32.410
And when he was saying that
this was part of the basic--

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:36.906
his theory was a theory of the
basic structure of society

00:29:36.906 --> 00:29:40.200
feminist theorists such as Susan
Okin,

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.118
now deceased,
and others made the argument,

00:29:44.118 --> 00:29:47.164
"How can you say you're
talking about the basic

00:29:47.164 --> 00:29:50.450
structure of society while
ignoring the family?"

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:55.933
And Rawls eventually conceded
the validity of that criticism

00:29:55.933 --> 00:30:01.698
and came to say toward the end
of his life that had he to do it

00:30:01.698 --> 00:30:07.089
over he would have included the
family as part of the basic

00:30:07.089 --> 00:30:09.598
structure of society.
 

00:30:09.598 --> 00:30:13.608
So if politics is about power
relations,

00:30:13.608 --> 00:30:17.630
then presumably you should
think about power relations

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.726
wherever they occur in social
life and not simply power

00:30:21.726 --> 00:30:25.897
relations as they occur in the
political system narrowly

00:30:25.897 --> 00:30:26.960
defined.
 

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.564
And so the spirit of my
argument for democratic justice

00:30:31.564 --> 00:30:36.084
is to base it on a broad
conception of politics rather

00:30:36.084 --> 00:30:37.960
than a narrow one.
 

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.397
Of course that doesn't mean
that every political

00:30:41.397 --> 00:30:44.690
relationship is a politicized
relationship.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:49.640
We might say the family is an
intensely political institution,

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.680
and indeed debates about
education,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.821
and debates about abortion,
and debates about many other

00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:02.038
subjects have politicized the
family in recent times,

00:31:02.038 --> 00:31:07.048
but in the 1950s it was not a
politicized institution.

00:31:07.048 --> 00:31:10.993
It was seen as something beyond
politics, of no relevance to

00:31:10.993 --> 00:31:11.730
politics.
 

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.240
So what institutions are
politicized in that sense,

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.380
consciously conceived of as
political,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.664
is a separate question from
what institutions are in fact

00:31:23.664 --> 00:31:27.320
political,
if we define political as

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:33.388
involved in the reproduction of
power relationships in the

00:31:33.388 --> 00:31:34.558
society?
 

00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:38.318
So we have a broad conception
of politics.

00:31:38.318 --> 00:31:42.490
And then secondly we have a
semi-contextual argument,

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.824
and this is to try and take
account of what people like

00:31:46.824 --> 00:31:48.910
MacIntyre have argued.
 

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:55.497
That what people are willing to
accept is largely conditioned by

00:31:55.497 --> 00:32:01.038
the social circumstances into
which they are born,

00:32:01.038 --> 00:32:04.608
the traditions that they find
structuring their lives,

00:32:04.608 --> 00:32:09.691
and that we have to take into
account the context in which

00:32:09.691 --> 00:32:11.920
people find themselves.
 

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:19.058
But there's more to life than
just the context.

00:32:19.058 --> 00:32:22.253
That is to say there are
inherited traditions and

00:32:22.253 --> 00:32:25.180
practices,
but as we reproduce them into

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.808
the future we have choices to
make,

00:32:27.808 --> 00:32:32.670
and we need principles to guide
those choices.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:36.720
And so the argument of
democratic justice is that we do

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.318
develop general principles of a
sort, but they're

00:32:40.318 --> 00:32:41.818
semi-contextual.
 

00:32:41.818 --> 00:32:45.984
That is, they play themselves
out differently in different

00:32:45.984 --> 00:32:50.588
historical circumstances and in
different parts of the world.

00:32:50.588 --> 00:32:57.044
So you may, for example,
have an affirmation of the idea

00:32:57.044 --> 00:33:01.269
of non-domination in family
life,

00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:06.556
but that's going to have to be
worked out very differently in

00:33:06.556 --> 00:33:12.019
America in 2010 than it might
have been in America in 1950,

00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:16.248
not to mention in countries
that have inherited polygamist

00:33:16.248 --> 00:33:18.769
systems of traditional marriage.
 

00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:24.386
We're going to have to think in
context-sensitive ways about how

00:33:24.386 --> 00:33:28.933
to realize those general
principles in the different

00:33:28.933 --> 00:33:30.538
circumstances.
 

00:33:30.538 --> 00:33:34.340
A third point,
and I apologize here I did

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:40.423
swear off impenetrable jargon at
the beginning of this course and

00:33:40.423 --> 00:33:45.936
you might think talking about
superordinate and subordinate

00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:51.640
goods is a use of not very
user-friendly terminology,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.880
but let me explain what I mean
by this.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.731
If we take a broad conception
of politics one of the things

00:33:59.731 --> 00:34:03.849
that follows from it is that
power relations are everywhere.

00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:07.798
Power infuses everything we do.
 

00:34:07.798 --> 00:34:12.110
There are power relations in
the family.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.710
There are power relations in
the workplace.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.018
There are power relations in
sports teams.

00:34:16.018 --> 00:34:19.090
There are power relations in
classrooms.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.260
Power infuses everything.
 

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.045
This is, of course,
an idea for which the French

00:34:26.045 --> 00:34:29.112
political commentator,
now deceased,

00:34:29.112 --> 00:34:32.916
by the name of Foucault,
is famous for pointing out that

00:34:32.916 --> 00:34:36.452
power is everywhere,
but of course it's as old as

00:34:36.452 --> 00:34:37.369
the hills.
 

00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:42.190
Plato was of the same view that
power relations are everywhere,

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:46.797
and indeed the reason Plato
affirmed a broad conception of

00:34:46.797 --> 00:34:50.596
politics was because he
recognized that power is

00:34:50.596 --> 00:34:53.909
exercised everywhere in the
society,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:58.487
and so if the theory of
politics is really a theory of

00:34:58.487 --> 00:35:03.672
power relations it's going to
have to track power wherever it

00:35:03.672 --> 00:35:04.449
goes.
 

00:35:04.449 --> 00:35:08.483
So if power relations are
ubiquitous and politics is

00:35:08.483 --> 00:35:13.389
ubiquitous then it seems like,
well, everything is politics.

00:35:13.389 --> 00:35:18.070
And it's that last phrase that
I want to dissent from,

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:22.871
that last phrase in Foucault or
in Plato that I want to dissent

00:35:22.871 --> 00:35:26.273
from because,
in fact, what we really see is

00:35:26.273 --> 00:35:30.260
not that everything is power,
but that power infuses

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.079
everything and there's an
important difference.

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:37.389
Yes, there are power relations
in the classroom.

00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:40.559
Your teaching fellow has a
certain kind of power over you.

00:35:40.559 --> 00:35:44.505
I have a certain kind of power
over you, but that's not the

00:35:44.505 --> 00:35:47.429
only thing that goes on in the
classroom.

00:35:47.429 --> 00:35:51.579
Presumably also what goes on in
the classroom is enlightenment,

00:35:51.579 --> 00:35:57.039
not in the big E sense of the
Enlightenment,

00:35:57.039 --> 00:36:00.280
but enlightenment in the sense
of communicating knowledge to

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:00.610
you.
 

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.360
In the firm,
yes there are power relations

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.300
in the firm.
 

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.139
Managers have power over
workers.

00:36:07.139 --> 00:36:11.824
Shareholders have power over
managers, at least in certain

00:36:11.824 --> 00:36:13.139
circumstances.
 

00:36:13.139 --> 00:36:16.715
Of course there are power
relations in firms,

00:36:16.715 --> 00:36:21.512
but the exercise of power is
not the only thing that goes on

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:22.570
in firms.
 

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:27.271
There's the production of goods
and services that goes on in

00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:27.909
firms.
 

00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:31.730
Yes, there are power relations
in sports teams.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:36.239
Again, coaches have power over
players.

00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:41.375
Donors, you might say,
have power over coaches,

00:36:41.375 --> 00:36:45.730
even university presidents
sometimes.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.233
So of course there are power
relations associated with sports

00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:51.983
teams,
but again, sports teams are not

00:36:51.983 --> 00:36:55.713
just about power relations
they're also about playing

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:56.789
sports well.
 

00:36:56.789 --> 00:37:01.079
So you can get the point from
these examples.

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:05.809
We could go everywhere through
society and see,

00:37:05.809 --> 00:37:10.027
yes, social relations often
involve power,

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:13.730
but that's not all they
involve.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:17.817
So to my way of thinking the
superordinate good is the

00:37:17.817 --> 00:37:22.101
playing excellent sport,
or producing goods and

00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:27.510
services, or communicating
enlightenment to students.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.476
Those are the superordinate
goods, or what MacIntyre called

00:37:31.476 --> 00:37:35.650
the internal goods when he was
talking about his practices.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:40.282
Those are the superordinate
goods that guide our activities

00:37:40.282 --> 00:37:42.599
in different walks of life.
 

00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:47.550
The subordinate goods have to
do with the power relations.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:51.447
And what I want to say is that
the goal of a democratic

00:37:51.447 --> 00:37:55.853
conception of justice should be
to democratize the subordinate

00:37:55.853 --> 00:37:59.824
relations as much as possible
while interfering with the

00:37:59.824 --> 00:38:03.289
superordinate goods as little as
possible.

00:38:03.289 --> 00:38:06.916
You, at the end of the day,
want the sports team to be able

00:38:06.916 --> 00:38:09.480
to play the best football it can
play,

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.577
or you want the students to
learn as much as they can

00:38:12.577 --> 00:38:16.007
possibly learn,
or you want the firm to produce

00:38:16.007 --> 00:38:20.266
as efficiently as possible the
goods and services that it

00:38:20.266 --> 00:38:21.179
produces.
 

00:38:21.179 --> 00:38:24.679
So those are the superordinate
goods.

00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:29.231
However, there is this fact
about power being mixed up in

00:38:29.231 --> 00:38:32.320
the pursuit of superordinate
goods,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.628
and democratic justice is about
democratizing the power

00:38:36.628 --> 00:38:41.179
dimensions of human interaction
while interfering with the

00:38:41.179 --> 00:38:45.010
non-power dimensions as little
as possible,

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.309
and the creative challenge is
to find ways to do that.

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:54.617
And I think that when we're
thinking about conditioning the

00:38:54.617 --> 00:38:58.369
subordinate dimensions
democratically,

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:03.664
there are really two dimensions
of democratic justice that are

00:39:03.664 --> 00:39:08.788
both present in that famous
quote from Nelson Mandela that I

00:39:08.788 --> 00:39:11.739
read to you a few moments ago.
 

00:39:11.739 --> 00:39:15.380
One is the idea of collective
self-government.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:19.864
It's the idea that,
as the principle of affected

00:39:19.864 --> 00:39:24.721
interests intimates,
anyone who is affected by a

00:39:24.721 --> 00:39:30.043
decision should have a
presumptive say in the making of

00:39:30.043 --> 00:39:31.719
that decision.
 

00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:35.639
It doesn't necessarily mean
everybody has an equal say.

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:39.800
We'll get to those issues
later, but everybody is presumed

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:44.110
to have a say in the making of
decision that affect them.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.139
No taxation without
representation.

00:39:47.139 --> 00:39:50.340
It's the idea of collective
self-government.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:53.820
If we're going to be affected
by decisions,

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.969
we should have a say in making
them.

00:39:56.969 --> 00:40:03.719
But then separate from that and
independent of it is the idea of

00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:09.351
the legitimacy of opposition,
the legitimacy of resisting

00:40:09.351 --> 00:40:14.070
decisions that you don't like,
and I think there are two

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.590
reasons for this.
 

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:20.659
Forget about the presumption
against hierarchy for a minute.

00:40:20.659 --> 00:40:22.219
I'll get to that shortly.
 

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:26.320
Just focus on the idea of
institutionalizing opposition.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.550
There are two reasons for that.
 

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:33.802
One I've already alluded to
today, which is that we're

00:40:33.802 --> 00:40:36.210
always fumbling in the dark.
 

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:40.239
We're always resisting things
that haven't worked well in the

00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:40.710
past.
 

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.869
We're trying to change things.
 

00:40:42.869 --> 00:40:48.360
We might be rebuilding the ship
at sea, as Devlin says,

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.429
but we are trying to rebuild
the ship.

00:40:52.429 --> 00:40:56.735
We are trying to make things
better as we reproduce them into

00:40:56.735 --> 00:40:59.893
the future,
and unless we have the freedom

00:40:59.893 --> 00:41:06.012
to oppose the existing order,
then the possibility of change

00:41:06.012 --> 00:41:08.349
becomes illusive.
 

00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:11.929
But a second and more
fundamental reason that we

00:41:11.929 --> 00:41:16.422
should institutionalize rights
of opposition is that you now

00:41:16.422 --> 00:41:20.460
know from taking this course
that there are no perfect

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.059
decision rules.
 

00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:26.858
We saw that if we just focus on
the arms-length types of

00:41:26.858 --> 00:41:31.920
transactions that characterize
national-level politics,

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.219
politics in buildings in
Washington,

00:41:34.219 --> 00:41:38.469
we did end up with a
presumption in favor of majority

00:41:38.469 --> 00:41:43.045
rule when we worked our way
through the difficulties with

00:41:43.045 --> 00:41:46.659
Buchanan and Tullock,
and Brian Barry,

00:41:46.659 --> 00:41:49.079
and Rae, and all of that.
 

00:41:49.079 --> 00:41:53.224
That other things being equal
you protect yourself best with

00:41:53.224 --> 00:41:56.387
majority rule,
but it's not a perfect decision

00:41:56.387 --> 00:41:57.018
rule.
 

00:41:57.018 --> 00:42:01.570
You know from Condorcet and
Kenneth Arrow that there is no

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:05.483
perfect way to aggregate
preferences into a social

00:42:05.483 --> 00:42:07.159
welfare function.
 

00:42:07.159 --> 00:42:10.340
So if there's no perfect
decision rule,

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.224
one of the things that follows
from that is that whatever the

00:42:15.224 --> 00:42:18.143
decision rule,
whatever the result,

00:42:18.143 --> 00:42:22.670
there are going to be people
who object to it and who object

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.360
to it legitimately.
 

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.670
People are going to feel that
their interests have not been

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.050
taken adequately into account.
 

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:36.503
And so opposition is important
for that reason to give people

00:42:36.503 --> 00:42:41.050
the possibility of trying to get
things changed;

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:45.809
very important for the
stability of democracy as well,

00:42:45.809 --> 00:42:49.737
because if you don't create
avenues for loyal opposition

00:42:49.737 --> 00:42:53.880
over time you're more likely to
get disloyal opposition.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:58.815
If people feel there's no
possibility of change they might

00:42:58.815 --> 00:43:01.500
as well reach for their guns.
 

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:07.311
So there are two dimensions of
democratic justice for that

00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:08.230
reason.
 

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:12.141
There's collective
self-government and then this

00:43:12.141 --> 00:43:15.469
idea of institutionalizing
opposition.

00:43:15.469 --> 00:43:20.472
In practice I suggest that one
of the most important ways in

00:43:20.472 --> 00:43:25.304
which we institutionalize
opposition is with a presumption

00:43:25.304 --> 00:43:27.170
against hierarchy.
 

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:33.780
If you think of the examples I
just gave you--

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.081
sports teams,
classes, firms,

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:44.125
you could think of many others,
armies, families--they're all

00:43:44.125 --> 00:43:48.730
hierarchical to a very
considerable extent.

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:52.764
All those social forms are
hierarchical,

00:43:52.764 --> 00:43:58.664
and often the hierarchy is
essential to the realization of

00:43:58.664 --> 00:44:02.699
the superordinate good in
question.

00:44:02.699 --> 00:44:07.538
So it's not the case that
hierarchies are necessarily bad,

00:44:07.538 --> 00:44:11.612
but it's when hierarchies
atrophy into systems of

00:44:11.612 --> 00:44:14.670
domination that they become bad.
 

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:21.588
Power corrupts and the problem
is to prevent those who are

00:44:21.588 --> 00:44:28.143
higher up in hierarchies from
taking advantage of their

00:44:28.143 --> 00:44:34.820
hierarchical authority in order
to dominate others.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.309
And so when we confront
hierarchical social arrangements

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:41.289
there are a number of questions
that we can ask,

00:44:41.289 --> 00:44:42.940
what I'm calling here.
 

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.559
We can interrogate hierarchies.
 

00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:48.539
We can ask, "Is a
hierarchy inevitable?"

00:44:48.539 --> 00:44:54.032
Well, the hierarchy of a parent
over a child is inevitable,

00:44:54.032 --> 00:44:58.864
but the hierarchy in,
say, in the 1950s of a husband

00:44:58.864 --> 00:45:02.179
over a wife was not inevitable.
 

00:45:02.179 --> 00:45:05.666
If the hierarchy is inevitable
we're going to have to think

00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:06.989
about it in one way.
 

00:45:06.989 --> 00:45:10.224
If it's not inevitable we're
going to think about it in a

00:45:10.224 --> 00:45:11.150
different way.
 

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:16.849
Is the degree of hierarchy
appropriate?

00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:20.039
Children must be subordinated
to their parents,

00:45:20.039 --> 00:45:24.199
but maybe they don't have to be
subordinated for 18 years.

00:45:24.199 --> 00:45:29.275
We have the arguments of the
Children's Rights Movement that

00:45:29.275 --> 00:45:34.009
wanted to treat children as
miniature adults almost from

00:45:34.009 --> 00:45:35.300
infanthood.
 

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.851
So we have to think about,
"Is the hierarchy

00:45:39.851 --> 00:45:41.179
appropriate?
 

00:45:41.179 --> 00:45:44.579
Whose interest does the
hierarchy serve?

00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:47.884
Is it really in the interest of
the production of the

00:45:47.884 --> 00:45:49.599
superordinate good?"
 

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:53.456
Think of a boss who has
hierarchical authority over a

00:45:53.456 --> 00:45:57.389
secretary and says to the
secretary at some point,

00:45:57.389 --> 00:46:01.420
"Unless you're willing to
go to bed with me,

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:06.389
you're not going to get a
promotion."

00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:10.693
Then the hierarchical authority
has atrophied into a system of

00:46:10.693 --> 00:46:14.081
domination because the
efficiencies that would be

00:46:14.081 --> 00:46:17.961
gained from the boss having
authority over his secretary

00:46:17.961 --> 00:46:21.773
have been perverted into
something that operates in the

00:46:21.773 --> 00:46:27.813
interest of the boss,
perhaps, but it doesn't serve

00:46:27.813 --> 00:46:32.280
the hierarchy as it was created.
 

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.789
How fluid is a hierarchy?
 

00:46:33.789 --> 00:46:36.699
Is it self-liquidating?
 

00:46:36.699 --> 00:46:41.161
If you think of the situation
where a child becomes a parent,

00:46:41.161 --> 00:46:44.878
a child becomes an adult,
that's a self-liquidating

00:46:44.878 --> 00:46:45.920
hierarchy.
 

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.052
Whereas, if we go back to the
nineteenth century and the

00:46:50.052 --> 00:46:53.809
father turned his daughter over
to her husband,

00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:57.880
that would be a
non-self-liquidating hierarchy.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:02.940
Is there vertical mobility
within the hierarchy?

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.032
Think of the debates in the
Catholic Church about whether a

00:47:07.032 --> 00:47:09.010
woman can become a priest.
 

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:16.969
There's not a lot of vertical
mobility within that hierarchy.

00:47:16.969 --> 00:47:20.199
Is the hierarchy symmetrical?
 

00:47:20.199 --> 00:47:25.336
We think of the defense of
polygamy, but most societies

00:47:25.336 --> 00:47:30.378
that have polygamy allow a
husband to have many wives,

00:47:30.378 --> 00:47:34.280
but not a wife to have many
husbands.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:40.860
Asymmetrical hierarchies are
more suspect than symmetrical

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:41.670
ones.
 

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.190
What are the opportunities for
exit?

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:48.630
Can people leave hierarchical
social situations?

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:52.659
You think about polygamy in
South Africa,

00:47:52.659 --> 00:47:55.480
it's essentially elective.
 

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.190
People can choose polygamist
arrangements,

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.806
but they don't have to,
whereas in some societies in

00:48:01.806 --> 00:48:05.706
fundamentalist cultures
polygamist marriage is enshrined

00:48:05.706 --> 00:48:07.409
in the legal system.
 

00:48:07.409 --> 00:48:12.342
Other things being equal,
hierarchical systems are more

00:48:12.342 --> 00:48:17.824
suspect when the costs of exit
are high for the people at the

00:48:17.824 --> 00:48:18.829
bottom.
 

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:21.010
How insular is the hierarchy?
 

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.320
For instance we look at the
Amish.

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.130
It's a withdrawing sect.
 

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:29.760
They don't want to restructure
the rest of the social order,

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.969
so that is presumptively less
suspect than a fundamentalist

00:48:34.969 --> 00:48:39.909
group that does want to
restructure the social order.

00:48:39.909 --> 00:48:43.525
So there are all of these
questions one can ask about

00:48:43.525 --> 00:48:46.030
hierarchical social
relationships.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.559
You have to ask them in a
context sensitive fashion,

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:53.523
and then you can get some
answers that tell you what we

00:48:53.523 --> 00:48:58.150
should be trying to pursue in
the name of democratic justice.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.210
And I will pick up with some of
those answers on Wednesday.

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:08.000

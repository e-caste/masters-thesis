WAI CHEE DIMOCK: So I was able
to come to Anna's

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.033
section last week.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.233
And I really enjoyed the
discussion very much.

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:24.867
So I look forward to coming to
all the sections and just

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:28.633
matching the faces to the names
and just hearing your

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.033
voice and your ideas.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:34.700
So it was a great experience
last Thursday.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.433
And once again, just can't
stress enough how important it

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:43.067
is to take advantage of
the writing center.

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:45.933
So today, we're going
to go back.

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.900
And I just want to refresh your
memory about some of the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.733
things that we've been saying
about For Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:56.633
Those seven-fold permutations
that we're looking at, in

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:57.767
fact, pretty much
all semester.

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:01.767
And so individual in time,
voluntary versus involuntary,

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:06.700
foreign versus not foreign,
literate versus not literate.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.167
And on Thursday, we were talking
about the distant home

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:13.533
versus the on-site
environment.

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:19.467
And it turns out that there
really are two very distant

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:23.133
homes and maybe just two
homes for Robert.

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:27.333
One is Paris, which isn't
really a real home.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:31.233
But it is a home in the sense
that it is something that he

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:35.233
has the luxury of taking
completely for granted.

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:39.300
And so that's one definition of
home, a place where he can

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.333
work unselfconsciously.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:47.567
And the other home is a more
complicated place in the sense

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:51.833
that maybe it's not even a
geographical locale, but a

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:57.100
kind of emotional shelter
that is given to him--

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.700
bestowed upon him really--

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.233
by his grandfather's very
heroic presence

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:05.733
in the civil war.

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:08.800
So it's a nineteenth century
home for him.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.100
And he needs that very much
because of the non-home that

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.000
is the twentieth century.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600
I think that is really a very
sad fact about Robert.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.300
And maybe it's true
of some people.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.467
Sometimes it's true of some
authors that I love that I

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.567
feel that they really should
have existed in a different

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:36.267
century, and things would have
been so much easier for them.

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:38.167
Robert isn't exactly that
kind of person.

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:40.900
But there is a sense that the
twentieth century has been

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.467
very, very hard on him.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:46.300
And it is especially hard
on him because of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.733
the fact of his father.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:51.467
And really, there's no more
central fact than what your

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:53.300
parent was.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.000
So this is the moment that
clears up a lot of things for

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.667
us why his own home,
is in some sense, a

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.933
non-home for him.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:07.500
So he got this gun back, his
pistol, that was his

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.567
grandfather's pistol from the
Civil War that was misused by

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:12.900
his own father.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.967
And this is what Robert
does with that pistol.

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:19.133
"...he climbed out on the rock
and leaned over and saw his

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:23.933
face in the still water and saw
himself holding the gun,

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:26.433
and then he dropped it, holding
it by the muzzle, and

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:30.633
saw it go down making bubbles
until it was just as big as a

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.633
watch charm in that clear water,
and then it was out of

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:35.900
sight."

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.567
This is the best that he can do
for his father is to make

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:42.633
his father disappear.

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:45.933
The extent of the contamination
that his father

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:50.200
has brought upon the memory of
his grandfather can be washed

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.367
clean only when he becomes
no more than a bubble.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:04:00.867
And then not even a bubble
anymore in that clear water.

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:04.767
It clearly goes back to
Hemingway's conception of

00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:09.867
cleanliness, of how one clears
up one's life in In Our Time

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:13.000
in the Big Two-Hearted River.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.167
But I think that also within
For Whom the Bell Tolls, it

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:23.333
also looks forward to a moment,
a traumatic moment,

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:27.367
when someone else is looking at
something like a mirror and

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.900
seeing his own reflection.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.833
And I just want to call your
attention to the very

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:37.600
deliberate composition of this
particular visual tableau.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.733
Robert isn't just dropping
the gun.

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:41.200
He has to go up there.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.133
He has to see his own face.

00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:46.267
He has to see himself
holding the gun.

00:04:46.267 --> 00:04:52.233
And it's that kind of almost
narcissistic observation of

00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:55.500
himself that Hemingway is really
fascinated by, and the

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.533
psychological meaning of that.

00:04:57.533 --> 00:05:00.433
So we can read all kinds
of meaning into

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:01.333
this particular scene.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:05.867
And we'll see it repeated by
another person in an equally

00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:07.433
traumatic moment.

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:13.333
But here, it seems that Robert
really has no parent.

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:17.300
He looks at the world, and
the only thing that

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.600
he can see is himself.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.000
It's almost as if he's really an
orphan, has always been an

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.900
orphan all the time, because his
father can't really be a

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.633
father to him.

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:34.167
And so the act of dropping the
gun is, in some sense, only a

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.700
redescription of what
has long been a

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.033
psychological fact for Robert.

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:45.933
So all this highlights the fact
of how important it is to

00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:49.333
die well, not just for yourself,
but also for other

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:54.167
people for whom your death would
also be consequential.

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:57.400
And here, the biography
of Hemingway really

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.500
becomes quite important.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.367
Hemingway's own father, Dr.
Clarence Hemingway, died by

00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:06.533
his own hand.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.867
And we know that Hemingway
himself also

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:11.600
died by his own hands.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.433
So in many ways, For Whom the
Bell Tolls is kind of a

00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:18.900
meditation ahead of time to
that moment when Hemingway

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.633
would have to decide what
to do with his own life.

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:27.167
And so this was front page news
in the New York Times,

00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:29.733
June 3, 1961.

00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:33.600
Front page news, Chicago
Tribune.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:41.333
And on July 3, 1961, the
interpretation of the death of

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:43.800
Hemingway was that it
was accidental.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.433
He was cleaning his gun, and the
gun just kept going off.

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:54.467
And this fiction lasted for five
years, until 1966, when

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:57.100
his widow, Mary Hemingway,
finally admitted that no,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.200
actually that he had just put
the gun into his own mouth and

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.333
blew out his own brains.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:05.667
So it took five years for
the truth to come out.

00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:07.767
And now there are all
kinds of theories.

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:10.067
In fact, just last summer--

00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:14.033
I think it was July-- there was
a lot of speculation that

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.967
Hemingway might have died
because he was under such

00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:18.567
close surveillance by the FBI.

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:22.600
So that's just a new theory that
would still be coming up

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.633
in 2011, so many years
after the death.

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:31.567
People still continue to have
conjectures about why it was

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:33.733
that Hemingway killed himself.

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:37.300
But I think that one simple
explanation is that he was

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.433
just in very, very
poor health.

00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:41.633
And he was not able to write.

00:07:41.633 --> 00:07:44.300
And I think that for a writer,
there probably is nothing more

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.000
painful than that, or something
that would make life

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.367
more meaningless than not
being able to write.

00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:52.533
So this is a picture of him
fairly close to the end.

00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:54.633
And this was a public
appearance.

00:07:54.633 --> 00:07:56.333
So he wasn't looking too bad.

00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:59.800
But we can sort of see that he
really wasn't looking well.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.567
And he was there.

00:08:00.567 --> 00:08:02.500
It was a fishing competition.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.333
And Castro apparently won
lots of trophies.

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:08.400
And Hemingway was there to
give him the trophies.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.067
But he really wasn't
looking well.

00:08:10.067 --> 00:08:14.200
So I think that that probably
is the simplest explanation,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.900
that he no longer is
what he once was.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.067
And he simply couldn't accept
the fact that there is this

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:26.200
kind of sharp decline in
his mental abilities

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.567
and physical abilities.

00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:32.167
So this is the last
image that I like

00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:34.033
to show you of Hemingway.

00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:36.833
It's just where he
used to write.

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:41.900
And that is the most important
place for him, really, in the

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.233
whole world.

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:47.833
And today, we'll talk about the
thinking about that, about

00:08:47.833 --> 00:08:49.433
how he ended his life.

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:54.367
We'll think about the varieties
of dying and the

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:58.633
numerous ways by which
people end or choose

00:08:58.633 --> 00:09:00.233
not to end the life.

00:09:00.233 --> 00:09:03.333
So Hemingway actually covers
the entire spectrum--

00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:06.800
people who choose to die as well
as people who choose not

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.900
to die and seeing what it
means in each case.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.700
So we'll begin by looking at the
central event in For Whom

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.867
the Bell Tolls, the execution
of the fascist.

00:09:20.867 --> 00:09:24.433
And then we'll look at the
personal end or non-end of

00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:27.600
various individuals, beginning
with Finito whose name

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.233
obviously is a pun.

00:09:29.233 --> 00:09:33.433
And then the old women in the
Madrid market, in the bombing,

00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:37.167
which is a new phenomenon in the
early twentieth century.

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:39.400
And then Robert's
father again.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.900
And then Pablo, someone
who refuses to die.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.500
But first of all, the execution
of the fascist. We

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.367
should remember this whole,
very long episode

00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:54.600
is narrated by Pilar.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.167
So I hope that you guys will
talk about it in section what

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:02.567
it means for a woman who's on
the Republican side to be

00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:05.667
recounting this story, the
execution of her political

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:09.767
enemies and how she feels about
this, and why it is that

00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:14.000
Hemingway chooses to have
a woman tell this story.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.733
So anyway, this is Pilar
speaking, and how the

00:10:19.733 --> 00:10:23.433
Republican guerrillas have taken
the town, so they can

00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:25.433
execute all the fascists.

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:29.000
And this is all engineered
by Pablo.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.133
"He placed them in two lines as
you would place men for a

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:38.500
rope pulling contest or as
they stand in the city to

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.800
watch the ending of a bicycle
road race with just room for

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.867
the cyclists to pass between,
or as men stood to allow the

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:51.200
passage of a holy image
in a procession.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.200
Two meters was left between the
lines and they extended

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.600
from the door of the
Ayuntamiento clear across the

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.667
plaza to the edge
of the cliff.

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:06.467
So that, from the doorway of
the Ayuntamiento, looking

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:10.400
across the plaza, one coming out
would see two solid lines

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.567
of people waiting."

00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:16.000
For Pilar, this formation, this

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.033
particular visual tableau--

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:20.433
and once again, it's
highly visual--

00:11:20.433 --> 00:11:23.200
is emphasizing what one will
see coming out of the

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.500
Ayuntamiento.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.000
It's two solid lines of people
who are very, all the way, not

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.267
inflamed by passion, just doing
what needs to be done.

00:11:34.267 --> 00:11:39.933
And so all the metaphors that
Hemingway uses are actually

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:44.600
ritualistic metaphors, something
that is extremely

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.567
well-defined or very
well-defined rules of the

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:51.367
game, like rope pulling contests
or better yet,

00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:53.400
bicycle race.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.700
Not considered a violent
event, either of those.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:03.933
But it still more intensifying
the degree of ceremoniousness

00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:06.333
is the procession of
the holy image of

00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:08.267
an icon going through.

00:12:08.267 --> 00:12:11.767
So the three metaphors highlight
the fact that there

00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:19.233
is the equivalent of those
rituals, civic and religious

00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:24.833
rituals, that would be a
political ritual of execution.

00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.067
At it's most utopian --

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:31.633
the execution of your opponents,
which is a

00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:34.233
necessary thing in
some cases --

00:12:34.233 --> 00:12:37.967
the execution of your political
opponents should be

00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:41.767
as ritualistic, as ceremonious,
as free of

00:12:41.767 --> 00:12:45.633
passion, as all those other
ritualistic events.

00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:49.933
So this is a very utopian
moment in For

00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:51.000
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.867
And if it could be held at this
level, then the Spanish

00:12:55.867 --> 00:12:59.333
Civil War, according to Pilar,
would in fact be a good war or

00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:00.167
a beautiful war.

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:03.633
And she tends to think of
those terms as sometimes

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:05.233
synonymous, and we'll
talk about that.

00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:08.533
But in any case, it begins
with a very utopian

00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:12.367
description of what a war could
be and what you could do

00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:15.200
to your enemies without debasing
them, without abusing

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.133
them, even though you
do kill them.

00:13:18.133 --> 00:13:22.233
And I tried to find an image
of the two lines of people,

00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:25.900
with the people who are being
executed passing through.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.367
And I just couldn't find
an image, I guess.

00:13:28.367 --> 00:13:29.533
It's not surprising.

00:13:29.533 --> 00:13:32.833
Probably nobody will be taking
pictures at that moment.

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:37.000
But as it turns out, one major
artist actually has numerous

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.933
paintings that seem
to be alluding to

00:13:39.933 --> 00:13:41.067
that kind of formation.

00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:44.433
And it's Robert Motherwell,
a major twentieth century

00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:47.300
artist. And not only does
he have one, he

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.033
actually has numerous.

00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:53.267
From the '50s on to the '70s, he
produced numerous paintings

00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:56.567
all called Elegy to the Spanish
Republic with this two

00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:57.600
line formation.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.100
So this is an early one
that was found in, I

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.700
think it was 1954.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.833
And this one is much later.

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:05.333
He numbers all of them.

00:14:05.333 --> 00:14:08.867
This one is in the Metropolitan
Museum.

00:14:08.867 --> 00:14:12.667
And this one is 102, I don't
actually remember what date it

00:14:12.667 --> 00:14:15.233
was, but obviously later.

00:14:15.233 --> 00:14:18.400
And this one is quite
late in the '70s,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.400
110 now in the series.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.633
And it's in the Guggenheim
Museum.

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:28.267
So clearly, Hemingway's talking
about something that's

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:32.867
also recognized by other people
as, in many ways, kind

00:14:32.867 --> 00:14:38.633
of the utopian moment of the
war when violence is both

00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:44.033
executed, but not allowed
to get out of hand.

00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:49.067
But Hemingway also shows us
that, in fact, that is not a

00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:51.933
sustainable Utopia.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:58.100
That violence kept within
limits, violence kept within

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.933
bounds, is not likely to
last for the whole

00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:04.100
duration of the war.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.133
So Pilar refers to this
as drunkenness

00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:11.800
coming into the lines.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.233
".,..the people of this town
are as kind as they can be

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:22.833
cruel and they have a natural
sense of justice and a desire

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.567
to do that which is right.

00:15:24.567 --> 00:15:28.767
But cruelty had entered into the
lines and also drunkenness

00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:32.067
or the beginning of drunkenness
and the lines were

00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:36.500
not as they were when Don
Benito had come out...

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.900
in Spain drunkenness, when
produced by other elements

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.033
than wine, is a thing
of great ugliness."

00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:48.500
So already we're beginning to
see the language of beauty and

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.900
ugliness coming into the
situation where it seems that

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.667
moral judgment is in play.

00:15:55.667 --> 00:16:00.900
So Pilar's referring to real
drunks, actual people who are

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.800
drunks in that episode.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.200
But she's also referring to
another kind of drunkenness,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.667
which is to be drunk with maybe

00:16:09.667 --> 00:16:11.900
the desire for vengeance.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.900
Drunk with your own sense of
momentary power, absolute

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.967
power over someone.

00:16:17.967 --> 00:16:20.833
Drunk with your ability to
bring about absolute

00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:23.567
debasement in your opponent.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:26.400
All of those things can make
people inebriated.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.167
And so Hemingway's really
talking about and Pilar is

00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:33.833
talking about different forms
of inebriation and how they

00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:39.933
can all work to break down the
stability, orderliness, and

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:43.067
ceremoniousness of what
really ought to be

00:16:43.067 --> 00:16:44.667
no more than a ritual.

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:48.600
So it's the breakdown of ritual
that for Pilar marks

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.600
the beginning of the chaos and
the mob violence that takes

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.500
over the scene.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.067
So just because we're talking so
much about-- she just talks

00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:00.333
about ugliness.

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:04.567
And in many ways, she's inviting
us to think about

00:17:04.567 --> 00:17:08.033
both the ethics, but also the
aesthetics of killing.

00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:12.000
A book that is pertinent to
that kind of thinking is

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.800
Elaine Scarry's book On Beauty
and Being Just. And her

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.733
argument is that beauty is
actually very important in our

00:17:19.733 --> 00:17:21.933
consideration of justice.

00:17:21.933 --> 00:17:25.200
That the sense of proportion,
the sense of balance, the

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.833
sense of symmetry, all those
ideas that we associate with

00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:32.067
beauty should also be concepts
that we consider when we think

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:34.133
about crime and punishment.

00:17:34.133 --> 00:17:37.467
Whether the punishment is
commensurate with the crime.

00:17:37.467 --> 00:17:39.633
So it's a very interesting
argument.

00:17:39.633 --> 00:17:43.933
And not really just about
execution of political

00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:47.433
prisoners, but thinking about
justice in general.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:53.133
So just keep that in mind as we
go with Pilar to talk more

00:17:53.133 --> 00:17:56.733
about the breakdown
of the line.

00:17:56.733 --> 00:18:00.733
"Then some drunkard yelled,
'Guillermo!' from the lines,

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:05.067
imitating the high cracked
voice of his wife and Don

00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:09.933
Guillermo rushed toward the man,
blindingly, with tears

00:18:09.933 --> 00:18:13.267
now running down his cheeks
and the man hit him hard

00:18:13.267 --> 00:18:17.833
across the face with his flail
and Don Guillermo sat down

00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:21.067
from the force of the blow and
sat there crying, but not from

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:25.067
fear, while the drunkards beat
him and one drunkard jumped on

00:18:25.067 --> 00:18:27.767
top of him, astride his
shoulders, and beat him with a

00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:30.867
bottle."

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:33.567
My reading is not even doing
justice to just how horrendous

00:18:33.567 --> 00:18:35.433
this scene is.

00:18:35.433 --> 00:18:40.067
And I think that the reason that
Hemingway really singles

00:18:40.067 --> 00:18:45.533
out this moment is, in fact,
incommensurability between the

00:18:45.533 --> 00:18:46.900
punishment and the crime.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.267
We know in fact--

00:18:48.267 --> 00:18:50.633
and Pilar is very careful
to tell us--

00:18:50.633 --> 00:18:53.667
that Guillermo is not the
worst of the fascists.

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:55.367
In fact, he's not rich.

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:56.300
He doesn't own anything.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.900
He owns a wooden implement
little shop.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.800
He is a fascist because
of his wife,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.633
because his wife is religious.

00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:08.800
And so he just becomes a
fascist to humor her.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.467
So he really is the last
person who ought to be

00:19:12.467 --> 00:19:15.233
executed under those
circumstances.

00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:18.267
And he's also the last person
who ought to be humiliated in

00:19:18.267 --> 00:19:19.833
this particular way.

00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:22.433
There's various kinds
of execution.

00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:26.133
There doesn't have to be this
kind of very brutal kind of

00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:28.567
debasement of the person that's

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:29.967
just very cruel mockery.

00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:33.600
This is really what Pilar means
that these people are

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.567
naturally kind, but they're also
capable of great cruelty.

00:19:38.567 --> 00:19:42.733
And this is the moment when we
see that cruelty dramatized.

00:19:42.733 --> 00:19:46.033
So it's not even the killing
of Guillermo.

00:19:46.033 --> 00:19:47.800
It's the making fun of him.

00:19:50.733 --> 00:19:57.333
And just the whole treatise, the
scenario engineer in such

00:19:57.333 --> 00:20:00.967
a way as to bring about the
maximum degradation on the

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:02.167
part of Guillermo.

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:05.900
This is what makes this
scene so unbearable.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:14.733
And so for Pilar, this is the
absolute low point maybe of

00:20:14.733 --> 00:20:16.333
the whole Spanish Civil
War up to that point.

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:18.467
Although she can't look into
the future, and she doesn't

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.733
know what's to come.

00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:25.367
But in any case, this is the
moment when all of a sudden,

00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:28.233
everything seems to be
going the wrong way.

00:20:28.233 --> 00:20:33.900
And it is a turning point
for the worse for Pilar.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.667
"'I myself had felt much emotion
at the shooting of the

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:42.733
guardia civil by Pablo,' Pilar
said. 'It was a thing of great

00:20:42.733 --> 00:20:48.233
ugliness, but I had thought if
this is how it must be, this

00:20:48.233 --> 00:20:52.067
is how it must be, and at least
there was no cruelty,

00:20:52.067 --> 00:20:56.533
only the depriving of life,
which as we all have learned

00:20:56.533 --> 00:21:01.900
in these years is a thing of
ugliness but also a necessity

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:06.767
to do if we are to win, and to
preserve the Republic.'"

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:11.267
So it's a very complex bit
of reasoning here.

00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:13.867
And it seems that
Pilar's actually

00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:15.667
disagreeing with Scarry.

00:21:15.667 --> 00:21:19.067
So Scarry thinks that there's
almost kind of a perfect match

00:21:19.067 --> 00:21:21.600
between beauty and justice.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.333
That in our mind's eye--

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:26.533
not so much in the physical
eye, but in our

00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:29.033
mind's eye in our mind--

00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:32.100
what we recognize in our mind's
eye as beautiful will

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.867
also be just. That
there's that kind

00:21:34.867 --> 00:21:36.933
of balance and symmetry.

00:21:36.933 --> 00:21:39.533
But Pilar's making a distinction
between something

00:21:39.533 --> 00:21:43.600
that is ugly and something that
is morally reprehensible

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.333
and something that is
politically necessary.

00:21:46.333 --> 00:21:48.033
So those are the three
kinds of

00:21:48.033 --> 00:21:50.100
concepts that are in
play in her head.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:56.500
And for her, something that is
politically necessary can also

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.333
be ugly, and that is OK.

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:03.000
So she can take ugliness.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.933
She doesn't welcome it.

00:22:03.933 --> 00:22:05.567
She doesn't love it.

00:22:05.567 --> 00:22:07.500
But she can take it.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.967
It is the cruelty that
she can't take.

00:22:10.967 --> 00:22:15.133
And so based on that
distinction, it is the fact

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:22.467
that cruelty had entered
into the lines.

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:29.133
For her, that is the measure of
just how much the sense of

00:22:29.133 --> 00:22:32.667
war has been corrupted
from within.

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:35.033
That basically it
has gone bad.

00:22:35.033 --> 00:22:38.467
And that is a phrase that
Hemingway uses quite a bit in

00:22:38.467 --> 00:22:39.867
For Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:22:39.867 --> 00:22:43.100
Pablo is someone who
has gone bad.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.867
And the Spanish Civil War, the
Republican cause is something

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.267
that has gone bad.

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:53.600
So the final reflection
from Pilar.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.233
"...but I could not sleep that
night and I got up and sat in

00:22:57.233 --> 00:23:01.000
a chair and looked out of the
window and I could see the

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.633
square in the moonlight where
the lines had been and across

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:08.200
the square the trees shining
in the moonlight, and the

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.600
darkness of their shadows, and
the benches bright too in the

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.333
moonlight, and the scattered
bottles shining, and beyond

00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:18.533
the edge of the cliff where
they had all been thrown.

00:23:18.533 --> 00:23:22.600
And there was no sound but the
splashing of the water in the

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:28.367
fountain and I sat there and I
thought we have begun badly."

00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:33.467
So she's arriving at that, which
for her, is the ultimate

00:23:33.467 --> 00:23:34.200
really judgment.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.400
Not ugly, but bad.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.200
That this is her verdict
on her own side.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.267
So Pilar, of course, is not
speaking for Hemingway.

00:23:45.267 --> 00:23:48.133
But I think that she has
a lot of authority.

00:23:48.133 --> 00:23:53.000
And so her pity is
something that we

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.067
should take very seriously.

00:23:55.067 --> 00:23:59.567
At what point does cruelty
in any war--

00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:03.300
not just the Spanish Civil War
but the first World War, the

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.333
second World War especially
is a war

00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:06.600
marked by great cruelty--

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.333
at what point does cruelty
render that side not

00:24:10.333 --> 00:24:11.767
justifiable any action?

00:24:11.767 --> 00:24:14.667
Even winning is maybe
not justifiable.

00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:20.233
So from there, from this kind of
a large-scale meditation on

00:24:20.233 --> 00:24:24.233
the justice of war -- whether
there could be a just war --

00:24:24.233 --> 00:24:29.433
or at what point does all
wars become unjust --

00:24:29.433 --> 00:24:36.333
From that large scale macro
meditation, let's move on to

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:42.667
thinking about dying as a much
more personal phenomenon and

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:45.333
also a choice, quite often.

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:48.533
Hemingway is very interested
both in people dying

00:24:48.533 --> 00:24:55.033
involuntarily, but also in
people choosing to live on

00:24:55.033 --> 00:24:59.367
voluntarily, even though living
on might not be a very

00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:00.967
beautiful thing.

00:25:00.967 --> 00:25:04.200
Might not even be actually an
ethical thing, although that

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.033
is kind of a funny
thing to say.

00:25:07.033 --> 00:25:13.567
But he certainly seems to be
really thinking about looking

00:25:13.567 --> 00:25:17.433
forward to his own end in the
Agustin episodes, but

00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:21.800
beginning with the bullfighter
Finito.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.933
So this is someone
who is already--

00:25:25.933 --> 00:25:28.033
his career is over
at this point.

00:25:28.033 --> 00:25:31.567
He's gone to his last corrida,
last bullfight.

00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:36.200
And this is the ceremony
celebrating the end of his

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.900
career and his retirement
and his glorious

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.667
career up to this point.

00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:47.267
"Finito did not eat much because
he had received a

00:25:47.267 --> 00:25:51.333
palotaxo, a blow from the flat
of the horn when we had gone

00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:56.367
in to kill in his last corrida
of the year at Zaragoza.

00:25:56.367 --> 00:25:59.667
So the president of the Club
reached the end of the speech

00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:02.633
and then, with everybody
cheering him, he stood on a

00:26:02.633 --> 00:26:07.367
chair and reached up and untied
the cord that bound the

00:26:07.367 --> 00:26:09.633
purple shroud over the head.

00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:14.400
And the head of the bull was as
though he were alive, his

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:19.467
forehead was curly as in life
and his nostrils were open and

00:26:19.467 --> 00:26:22.033
his eyes were bright
and he was there

00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:25.167
looking straight at Finito.

00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:30.200
Everyone shouted and applauded
and Finito sunk further back

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.667
in the chair and then everyone
was quiet and looking at him

00:26:34.667 --> 00:26:38.467
and he said, 'No, no,' and
looked at the bull and pulled

00:26:38.467 --> 00:26:43.700
further back and then he said,
'No!' very loudly and a big

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:48.467
blob of blood came out and he
didn't even put up the napkin

00:26:48.467 --> 00:26:52.233
and it slid down his chin and
he was still looking at the

00:26:52.233 --> 00:26:53.033
bull."

00:26:53.033 --> 00:26:56.367
There's a lot of looking
in Hemingway.

00:26:56.367 --> 00:26:59.667
You guys can write a great paper
just by looking at the

00:26:59.667 --> 00:27:01.867
dynamics of looking.

00:27:01.867 --> 00:27:05.200
Sort of the gaze that we cast
upon someone else and

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.533
sometimes the gaze that
they cast back at us.

00:27:08.533 --> 00:27:11.933
Quite often it's a kind of
a reciprocal process.

00:27:11.933 --> 00:27:15.833
And here it is indeed a
reciprocal process.

00:27:15.833 --> 00:27:19.267
Finito is looking at the
bull, and the bull

00:27:19.267 --> 00:27:21.067
is looking at him.

00:27:21.067 --> 00:27:23.033
Even though it's a dead bull,
it doesn't matter.

00:27:23.033 --> 00:27:25.633
A dead bull can look
back at you too.

00:27:25.633 --> 00:27:30.667
And it seems that here,
actually, it is not what

00:27:30.667 --> 00:27:31.933
Finito is seeing.

00:27:31.933 --> 00:27:34.067
It's not the mirror image.

00:27:34.067 --> 00:27:36.833
And that's what's so
heartbreaking about it.

00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:41.333
It would have been great if it
had been a mirror image.

00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:46.400
Because what he sees in a bull
is actually a bull in a full

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.733
vigor of life.

00:27:47.733 --> 00:27:53.467
This bull, even though it's
dead, he's more alive than

00:27:53.467 --> 00:27:59.067
when he was alive, it seems. His
curly hair, his nostrils

00:27:59.067 --> 00:28:01.300
are open, his eyes are bright.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.167
He's just a great spectacle.

00:28:04.167 --> 00:28:05.400
And more than that,
he's animate.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.500
He seems to be endowed with
life even after death.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:16.833
And so if this were a mirror
image, this ought to have been

00:28:16.833 --> 00:28:21.333
Finito in his prime of life,
when he was a great matador,

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.933
when he wouldn't be coughing
blood, when he would be able

00:28:23.933 --> 00:28:27.467
to eat instead of now when he
can't eat anything, because of

00:28:27.467 --> 00:28:29.833
the damage that has been
done to this stomach.

00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:33.933
So if this were a mirror image,
Finito would have been

00:28:33.933 --> 00:28:34.767
young again.

00:28:34.767 --> 00:28:37.800
But we all know that that's
not going to happen.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:43.567
And so Hemingway is clearly
punning on the word Finito.

00:28:43.567 --> 00:28:46.100
This is a man who is finished.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:52.700
When a man is finished in this
particular way, is it better

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.100
or worse for him to
be still alive?

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.333
Wouldn't it have been better if
he had been killed earlier,

00:28:59.333 --> 00:29:00.667
just like the bull?

00:29:00.667 --> 00:29:05.567
Then he would have been
preserved at the maximum high

00:29:05.567 --> 00:29:06.867
point of his life.

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:09.233
So I think it's not the kind of
thinking that actually we

00:29:09.233 --> 00:29:11.467
want to engage in
all the time.

00:29:11.467 --> 00:29:15.300
But it is something that I think
that Hemingway takes

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.933
very seriously, obviously.

00:29:17.933 --> 00:29:20.733
And so for him, this is
a kind of comic --

00:29:20.733 --> 00:29:23.333
tragic-comic moment
of survival.

00:29:23.333 --> 00:29:25.733
Yes, Finito is hanging
on there.

00:29:25.733 --> 00:29:28.367
He's not about to just dispatch
himself voluntarily.

00:29:28.367 --> 00:29:30.067
He's going to hang on.

00:29:30.067 --> 00:29:35.033
But it's a very dubious
kind of hanging on.

00:29:35.033 --> 00:29:39.367
And the only redeeming thing
that we can say about it is

00:29:39.367 --> 00:29:40.167
that it is funny.

00:29:40.167 --> 00:29:41.000
It's comical.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.900
So once again, the only way that
we can take this, we can

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.033
swallow this, stomach it, is by
saying that it is a comical

00:29:47.033 --> 00:29:49.367
moment in For Whom
the Bell Tolls.

00:29:49.367 --> 00:29:54.867
And there's another equally
tragic-comic, obviously mostly

00:29:54.867 --> 00:29:58.467
comic moment in For Whom the
Bell Tolls about somebody

00:29:58.467 --> 00:30:00.767
hanging on, refusing to die,
even though they have

00:30:00.767 --> 00:30:04.500
finished, as Finito
is also finished.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.133
This is Pilar talking
to Robert about

00:30:10.133 --> 00:30:10.933
the smell of death.

00:30:10.933 --> 00:30:14.033
And then he doesn't know
what that smells like.

00:30:14.033 --> 00:30:17.167
And she tells him to go to
the market in Madrid.

00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:22.000
"'You must go down the hill in
Madrid to the Puente de Toledo

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.067
early in the morning to the
matadero and stand there on

00:30:26.067 --> 00:30:29.733
the wet paving when there is a
fog from the Manzanares and

00:30:29.733 --> 00:30:33.467
wait for the old women who go
before daylight to drink the

00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:36.300
blood of the beasts that
are slaughtered.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.933
When such an old woman comes out
of the matadero, holding

00:30:40.933 --> 00:30:46.233
her shawl around her, with her
face gray and her eyes hollow,

00:30:46.233 --> 00:30:51.300
and the whiskers of age on her
chin and on her cheeks, set in

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.633
the waxen white of her face as
the sprouts grow from the seed

00:30:54.633 --> 00:31:00.067
of the bean, not bristles
but pale sprouts in the

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:01.533
death of her face.

00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:05.233
Put your arms tights around her,
Ingles, and hold her to

00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:08.867
you and kiss her on the mouth
and you will know the second

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:11.900
part that odor is made of."

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.033
I definitely think there's
quite a bit of

00:31:15.033 --> 00:31:17.333
misogyny going on.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:21.500
Old people, male and female
kind of look bad.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.633
But Hemingway seems completely
fixated on how

00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:28.567
bad old women look.

00:31:28.567 --> 00:31:32.800
And especially the bean sprouts
growing on her face --

00:31:35.767 --> 00:31:39.067
I think that's why it's
sort of comic and is

00:31:39.067 --> 00:31:40.633
OK because of that.

00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:48.500
Actually, lots of very well
known older women have this

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.367
kind of whiskers on the faces.

00:31:52.367 --> 00:31:55.633
And it's just a fact.

00:31:55.633 --> 00:31:58.967
But for Hemingway, it seems to
be a kind of a reproach on the

00:31:58.967 --> 00:32:01.367
old women that they
should have this

00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:04.300
growth on their faces.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.300
And that, in many ways, they are
going against nature, that

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.467
suddenly they have become men
rather than women to have

00:32:11.467 --> 00:32:13.867
whiskers on their
faces and so on.

00:32:13.867 --> 00:32:17.367
And so they really ought to have
died earlier instead of

00:32:17.367 --> 00:32:20.367
allowing this unnatural
phenomena to happen to them.

00:32:23.633 --> 00:32:28.833
It's really a very small
incident, but nonetheless, the

00:32:28.833 --> 00:32:32.700
female counterpart to
the Finito story.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.833
And I just want to stop here for
a moment and talk a little

00:32:35.833 --> 00:32:38.667
bit about the interconnections
between Hemingway and

00:32:38.667 --> 00:32:39.133
Fitzgerald.

00:32:39.133 --> 00:32:43.000
In fact, we've seen this
phenomenon before of a kind of

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.233
an unnatural growth that is
almost a parody of nature.

00:32:46.233 --> 00:32:49.333
So we've just had this
tragic comic bean

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:52.167
sprouts on a human face.

00:32:52.167 --> 00:32:58.067
And actually in Fitzgerald, we
have a kind of non-comic

00:32:58.067 --> 00:33:01.700
version of that in The Great
Gatsby in the Valley of the

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.833
Ashes with the ashes
growing like wheat.

00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:07.567
And I'll read you the
passage in a moment.

00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:11.933
But Hemingway also has the kind
of non-comic parallel to

00:33:11.933 --> 00:33:15.833
the Fitzgerald version, which
is also a kind of parody of

00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:17.400
nature that we'll look at.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.067
But first, something that is
almost like the market scene

00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:24.733
of the bean sprouts in
The Great Gatsby.

00:33:24.733 --> 00:33:30.467
"This is the valley of ashes,
a fantastic farm where ashes

00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:36.000
grow like wheat into ridges
and hills and grotesque

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.833
gardens."

00:33:36.833 --> 00:33:40.033
So Fitzgerald's talking about
some kind of grotesque

00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:44.100
vegetation that is made up of
the animate and the inanimate.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.067
And in many ways, Hemingway's
talking about exactly the same

00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:48.567
thing, the bean sprouts.

00:33:48.567 --> 00:33:50.133
The women are almost
inanimate.

00:33:50.133 --> 00:33:52.500
They really ought
to be inanimate.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.133
It's a caricature of the animate
that they are animate.

00:33:57.133 --> 00:34:01.333
But in any case, it is sort of
the re-commingling of the

00:34:01.333 --> 00:34:04.333
animate and the inanimate that
he's talking about and that

00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:06.533
Fitzgerald is also
talking about.

00:34:06.533 --> 00:34:11.433
So just really curious that the
organic and inorganic are

00:34:11.433 --> 00:34:15.400
mixed in this way for
both authors.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.000
I would say that for Fitzgerald
this is very hard

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.967
to see this as comic at all.

00:34:20.967 --> 00:34:22.500
He didn't try very hard.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.800
But this is just
not that funny.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.567
It's ominous.

00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:31.067
It refers to a tragedy.

00:34:31.067 --> 00:34:38.000
But Hemingway also has a
completely non-comic parallel

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.767
to that of something that is
almost a parody of nature,

00:34:42.767 --> 00:34:45.933
except that it doesn't take
the form of bean sprouts.

00:34:45.933 --> 00:34:53.233
It is a human invention that
looks like the work of nature,

00:34:53.233 --> 00:34:55.700
but there's something else.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.700
So there's another bombing of
the El Sordo band on the top

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.300
of the hill.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.567
They've been chased to the top
of the hill, and they're

00:35:03.567 --> 00:35:07.633
basically kept there by the
firing power of the enemy.

00:35:07.633 --> 00:35:11.033
And they're on the top of the
hill, so they're just being

00:35:11.033 --> 00:35:16.733
bombed, the maximum point of
efficiency from the bombs.

00:35:16.733 --> 00:35:19.267
"Then, through the hammering
of the gun, there was the

00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:23.267
whistle of the air splitting
apart and then in the red

00:35:23.267 --> 00:35:28.633
black roar the earth rolled
under his knees and then waved

00:35:28.633 --> 00:35:32.967
up to hit him in the face and
then dirt and bits of rock

00:35:32.967 --> 00:35:37.167
were falling all over and
Ignacio was lying on him and

00:35:37.167 --> 00:35:39.467
the gun was lying on him.

00:35:39.467 --> 00:35:42.567
But he was not dead because the
whistle came again and the

00:35:42.567 --> 00:35:46.667
earth rolled under him with the
roar then they came again

00:35:46.667 --> 00:35:49.867
and the earth lurched under his
belly and one side of the

00:35:49.867 --> 00:35:54.467
hilltop rose into the air and
fell slowly over them where

00:35:54.467 --> 00:35:55.833
they lay."

00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:58.867
Supposedly it is bombs
dropped by all those

00:35:58.867 --> 00:36:00.300
bombers that we saw.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.433
The Heinkos and the Fiats, the
German Heinkos and

00:36:03.433 --> 00:36:06.333
the Italian Fiats dropping
the bombs.

00:36:06.333 --> 00:36:09.733
In this case, I think it's
just the Italian bombers.

00:36:09.733 --> 00:36:15.033
But the way that this moment of
bombing is described three

00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:20.600
times in this passage is that
the earth is rising up and

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.300
hitting the guerilla band and
every one of them gets killed

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.200
in this bombing.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.333
It is the fact that the earth
seems to be conspiring with

00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:38.067
the bombers and hitting the
human beings that it has

00:36:38.067 --> 00:36:40.033
nurtured all this time.

00:36:40.033 --> 00:36:41.733
That is the ultimate insult.

00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:44.167
That's the ultimate injury.

00:36:44.167 --> 00:36:49.200
That the Spanish peasants,
they live on the earth.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.367
They think that the earth
is on their side.

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:56.167
And to have the earth suddenly
joining the side of the enemy

00:36:56.167 --> 00:36:59.533
is about the worst thing
that could happen.

00:36:59.533 --> 00:37:04.300
And so this is the cruelty of
the description of that scene.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.867
A cruelty that is very much
coming from Hemingway himself.

00:37:06.867 --> 00:37:10.900
He didn't have to describe the
bombing as the action of the

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.733
earth rising up and hitting
all these human beings.

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:15.600
He doesn't have to describe
them in this way.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.700
He's describing the incident
in this way deliberately to

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.567
highlight the fact that in
which nature has been

00:37:22.567 --> 00:37:24.767
perverted by human action.

00:37:24.767 --> 00:37:28.233
That modern technology has
perverted nature so that

00:37:28.233 --> 00:37:31.267
nature is no longer a
place where human

00:37:31.267 --> 00:37:33.067
beings can be nourished.

00:37:33.067 --> 00:37:36.200
It's that nature is something--
the earth itself

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.133
is a weapon that can be used
against human beings.

00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:46.667
And what is also cruel about
this particular realignment of

00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:51.433
the earth with the enemy is
that it reaches back, and

00:37:51.433 --> 00:37:55.500
retrospectively and
retroactively rewrites and

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.033
ironizes an earlier moment.

00:37:58.033 --> 00:38:00.733
Because this is not the first
time that we hear about the

00:38:00.733 --> 00:38:03.433
earth rolling or the
earth moving.

00:38:03.433 --> 00:38:08.500
In fact, one of the most famous
little detail from For

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.267
Whom the Bell Tolls is that
when you have good sex

00:38:10.267 --> 00:38:13.900
supposedly the earth
moves under you.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.367
And this is what Pilar
wants to get.

00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:18.200
The information that Pilar wants
to get from Maria to

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:23.367
make sure that everything is
fine, that this, in fact,

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:23.867
happened.

00:38:23.867 --> 00:38:26.000
"'The earth moved,'
Maria said, not

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.967
looking at the woman.

00:38:26.967 --> 00:38:27.833
'Truly.

00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:31.533
It was a thing I cannot tell
thee...' 'For you, Ingles?'

00:38:31.533 --> 00:38:33.767
Pilar looked at Robert Jordan.

00:38:33.767 --> 00:38:38.333
'Don't lie.' 'Yes' he said.
'Truly.' 'Good,' said Pilar.

00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:39.633
'Good.

00:38:39.633 --> 00:38:40.867
That is something.'"

00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:45.267
So this is back in page 174.

00:38:45.267 --> 00:38:49.400
The earth moving, it's all
on the human side.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.867
And for someone who has
a very short life--

00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:55.433
everyone seems to know that
Robert might actually have a

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:56.100
very short life--

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.767
for someone who's going to have
a very short life, having

00:38:58.767 --> 00:39:01.133
that experience is
very important.

00:39:01.133 --> 00:39:08.900
So on page 174, the earth moving
has one connotation.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.667
And the cruelty of what happens
on page 331 is that it

00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:18.900
completely rewrites that earlier
scene and assigns a

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.500
completely different-- in fact
the opposite-- meaning to the

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.000
earth moving.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.500
So this is what Hemingway's
sometimes quite brutal

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.367
narrative can do, is that even
something that seems to be

00:39:34.367 --> 00:39:37.100
safely concluded --

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:45.167
that earth moving for
Robert and Maria --

00:39:45.167 --> 00:39:50.233
even though that is safely
concluded in the past, it is

00:39:50.233 --> 00:39:55.933
actually not safe from a
subsequent rewriting and a

00:39:55.933 --> 00:39:58.267
reassignment of meaning.

00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:03.533
So that the meaning of the earth
moving clearly is in

00:40:03.533 --> 00:40:05.133
flux maybe.

00:40:05.133 --> 00:40:07.300
Maybe it could be either way.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.333
Or maybe, the later event
actually can completely erase

00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:12.233
the earlier meaning.

00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:15.600
I think we have to decide for
ourselves to what extent page

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:21.667
321 can undo that earlier
Utopian moment.

00:40:21.667 --> 00:40:28.300
I want to talk about two other
things that are associated

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:33.133
with dying and not dying,
both hinging on the

00:40:33.133 --> 00:40:35.967
word "cobarde," coward.

00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:38.667
The first actually goes back
to Robert's father.

00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:46.333
But when we're looking at the
scene when he's just dropping

00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:52.567
the pistol in the water, there's
no description of how

00:40:52.567 --> 00:40:54.400
he feels about his father.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.367
It's just that he wants
to get rid of the gun.

00:40:56.367 --> 00:40:57.767
He never wants to see
the gun again.

00:40:57.767 --> 00:40:58.733
That's it.

00:40:58.733 --> 00:41:01.067
He's managed to get
rid of the gun.

00:41:01.067 --> 00:41:05.967
But actually, there is an
upfront description of how

00:41:05.967 --> 00:41:10.567
Robert feels about his father
and also a clarification of

00:41:10.567 --> 00:41:12.100
why he needs his grandfather.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:18.133
"Aw hell, I wish grandfather
was here, he thought.

00:41:18.133 --> 00:41:19.967
For about an hour anyway.

00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:24.167
Maybe he sent me what little I
have through the other one

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:26.267
that misused the gun.

00:41:26.267 --> 00:41:29.067
Maybe that is the only
communication that we have.

00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:30.933
But, damn it.

00:41:30.933 --> 00:41:35.367
I'll never forget how sick it
made me the first time I knew

00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.400
he was a cobarde.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.933
Go on, say it in English.

00:41:39.933 --> 00:41:40.833
Coward.

00:41:40.833 --> 00:41:44.533
It's easier when you have it
said and there is never any

00:41:44.533 --> 00:41:48.633
point in referring to a son of
a bitch by some foreign term.

00:41:48.633 --> 00:41:50.600
He wasn't any son of
a bitch, though.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.933
He was just a coward and that
was the worst luck any man

00:41:54.933 --> 00:41:58.500
could have."

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.067
This is interesting for
multiple reasons.

00:42:02.067 --> 00:42:07.067
One is that Robert really hopes
that he's the grandson

00:42:07.067 --> 00:42:09.867
of his grandfather, rather than
the son of his father.

00:42:09.867 --> 00:42:10.767
That's really clear.

00:42:10.767 --> 00:42:14.633
And because both actually
describe him, he is both his

00:42:14.633 --> 00:42:17.767
grandfather's grandson
and his father's son.

00:42:17.767 --> 00:42:20.867
If he had the choice, he would
much rather be the former.

00:42:20.867 --> 00:42:23.833
So he's suddenly hoping for the
best, which is that his

00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:25.367
father would just disappear
and that one

00:42:25.367 --> 00:42:27.167
link would be invalid.

00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:30.467
It would be an invalid link.

00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:34.733
But the way that he thinks
about his father is--

00:42:34.733 --> 00:42:37.600
first of all, that this is a
moment when Spanish seems to

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.800
come in handy.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.900
That maybe it's easier just to
ease your way into that way of

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.067
thinking about your father.

00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:45.200
So you go by way of a
foreign language.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.500
But then you really have to
say it in your own tongue.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.767
But then the way that he thinks
about that word is

00:42:52.767 --> 00:42:59.267
actually too empty of
any moral judgment.

00:42:59.267 --> 00:43:02.467
I think that when we use the
word coward, we tend to attach

00:43:02.467 --> 00:43:05.500
a lot of moral significance
to that term.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.967
Lack of bravery is a kind of a
moral failing on the part of

00:43:09.967 --> 00:43:15.133
the person who's lacking
that quality.

00:43:15.133 --> 00:43:20.600
But finally Robert is just empty
of that moral judgment

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.433
and just saying that some
people are just unlucky.

00:43:23.433 --> 00:43:26.700
Some people are just born
not very brave. And it

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.000
is not up to them.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.233
If they are born not very
brave, it is too much to

00:43:32.233 --> 00:43:35.733
expect absolute bravery
from them.

00:43:35.733 --> 00:43:39.033
They're not meant to be brave.
And when they are tried under

00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:42.700
certain circumstances, when they
can't meet that test of

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.033
bravery, then they're
going to break.

00:43:46.033 --> 00:43:50.433
So this is his way of accounting
for the fact that

00:43:50.433 --> 00:43:54.700
his father can't live
on stubbornly--

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.033
doesn't have the will to live,
to keep him going--

00:43:58.033 --> 00:44:02.033
just to make sense of that
in his own mind.

00:44:02.033 --> 00:44:07.700
So in this incident, a coward's
decision to die is

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.400
rendered acceptable.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.867
It's still not a great thing,
but he can wrap

00:44:13.867 --> 00:44:15.233
his mind around it.

00:44:15.233 --> 00:44:17.700
And that's really what he wants
to do is to be able to

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:22.833
wrap his mind around the fact
of his father's suicide.

00:44:22.833 --> 00:44:26.100
But I think that Hemingway
actually--

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:31.033
and this really speaks to how
far he's able to imagine a

00:44:31.033 --> 00:44:33.900
position that in the end we know
that will be the opposite

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.300
of his own--

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:41.600
how far he's able to imagine
and give dignity or maybe a

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.967
kind of admiration to someone's
decision not to die.

00:44:47.967 --> 00:44:54.800
The stubborn decide to hang on
and not just to go right now.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:59.333
And so parallel to that,
symmetrical to this, but also

00:44:59.333 --> 00:45:02.933
antithetical to his father's
action is a

00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:06.267
cobarde's will to survive.

00:45:06.267 --> 00:45:10.500
And the person who embodies that
will to survive is Pablo

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.700
whom I argue is actually one
of the most interesting

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.267
characters, arguably more
interesting than Robert in

00:45:16.267 --> 00:45:18.000
this novel.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.367
Because so much goes on inside
his head an also through him

00:45:22.367 --> 00:45:26.133
that we actually don't see
represented in the novel.

00:45:26.133 --> 00:45:31.267
So this is one area where
Hemingway even alerts us to

00:45:31.267 --> 00:45:32.600
the fact that there is
some information

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.333
that we're not getting.

00:45:34.333 --> 00:45:38.600
And that lack of information
or that non-disclosure of

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.767
information actually makes
Pablo the very mysterious

00:45:42.767 --> 00:45:44.367
person that he is.

00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:48.733
Anyway, Pablo is close to being
killed at this moment.

00:45:48.733 --> 00:45:52.133
"Agustin hit him again hard in
the mouth and Pablo laughed at

00:45:52.133 --> 00:45:55.733
him, showing the yellow, bad,
broken teeth in the reddened

00:45:55.733 --> 00:45:57.100
line of his mouth.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.900
'Leave it alone,' Pablo said
and reached with a cup to

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.900
scoop some wine from the bowl.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.933
'Nobody here has cojones to
kill me and this hand is

00:46:05.933 --> 00:46:09.667
silly.' 'Cobarde,'
Agustin said.

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:13.667
'Nor words either,' Pablo said
and made a swishing noise

00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:15.567
rinsing the wine in his mouth.

00:46:15.567 --> 00:46:18.333
He spat on the floor.

00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:22.400
'I am far past words.' Agustin
stood there looking down at

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.967
him and cursed him, speaking
slowly, clearly, bitterly and

00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:31.333
contemptuously and cursing as
steadily as though he were

00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:35.100
dumping manure on a field,
lifting it with a dung fork

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.633
out of a wagon.

00:46:36.633 --> 00:46:37.533
'And thou!

00:46:37.533 --> 00:46:40.900
And thou!' Agustin turned from
the door and spoke to him,

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:45.933
putting all this contempt into
a single, 'Tu.' 'Yes, me,'

00:46:45.933 --> 00:46:50.433
said Pablo. 'I will be alive
when you are dead.'

00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:56.033
So Agustin is trying his best
to get Pablo into a fight so

00:46:56.033 --> 00:46:58.567
that he can be killed right
then and there.

00:46:58.567 --> 00:47:03.633
And Pablo is doing everything he
can to stay alive, and he's

00:47:03.633 --> 00:47:04.867
succeeding.

00:47:04.867 --> 00:47:08.933
So no question about it, he's
an excellent coward.

00:47:08.933 --> 00:47:13.900
He's going to stand there and be
insulted maybe for as long

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.100
as Agustin has breath
to insult him He's

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.100
not going to break.

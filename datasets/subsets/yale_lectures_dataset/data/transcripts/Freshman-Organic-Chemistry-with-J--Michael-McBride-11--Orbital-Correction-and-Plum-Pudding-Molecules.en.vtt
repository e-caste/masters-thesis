00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.508
Prof: Okay,
so what's coming for the next

00:00:05.508 --> 00:00:05.910
exam?
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.597
Well we've been looking at
atoms, and at the idea of

00:00:09.597 --> 00:00:13.790
orbitals for many-electron
atoms, which we showed last time

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.730
is wrong.
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.570
So today we want to recover
from the orbital approximation.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay?
 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.810
Then we're going to look at
molecules.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.546
And first we're going to look
at them in a very unconventional

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:26.494
way,
from the point of view of

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:29.981
molecules as plum-puddings,
what's called the "United

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:32.787
Atom" limit,
to apply what we know from

00:00:32.787 --> 00:00:34.170
atoms to molecules.
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.585
But then we're going to look at
a very, very different way of

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.665
looking at it,
to try to understand bonds in

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.630
terms of what are called linear
combinations --

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.414
that means weighted sums -- of
atomic orbitals to make

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.824
molecular orbitals;
but we're going to try

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:53.270
understanding bonds.
 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.415
And then these terms that don't
mean much to you now but will

00:00:56.415 --> 00:00:58.722
mean a lot later on:
"energy-match"

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:00.189
and "overlap."
 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.060
And then we're going to get to
reality --

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.840
all this stuff is theory -- but
we're going to look at something

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.025
real: at XH_3 molecules,
with different atoms for X,

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:12.519
at their structure and at their
dynamics,

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:16.580
and how that ties in with our
understanding of bonding.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.296
And then we'll go on to
reactivity, which is of course

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:21.420
the main goal.
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.367
We'll talk about HOMOs and
LUMOs, and you'll see what those

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:28.908
are, and how to recognize
functional groups and their

00:01:28.908 --> 00:01:31.179
reactivity;
and that's the real prize,

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.287
is to be able to --
you've been memorizing

00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:35.530
functional groups for this
previous exam,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.702
but what I want you to be able
to do is look at a molecule and

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:40.989
recognize when it has a
functional group,

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:42.560
even if you've never seen it
before,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.370
and how it might react,
what it would react with.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.173
And then we're going to see how
organic chemistry really

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:52.872
developed, the real thing;
how it developed from the time

00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:54.400
of Lavoisier.
 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.800
Okay, so that's what we're
going to.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.930
And here's where we were last
time.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.055
We were wondering,
when it comes to a two-electron

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:03.796
wave function,
might it be possible to write

00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:07.049
it as a product of one-electron
wave functions?

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.180
Because we know how to write
1-electron wave functions;

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.786
we've got that table,
we can write the real thing,

00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:13.008
at least for an atom.
 

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:17.180
So if it were possible to write
the six-variable,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.145
two-electron wave function as a
product of one-electron wave

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:22.633
functions,
that would be a fantastic

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:25.360
simplification,
and all we'd have to do is

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.810
square and we'd get the joint
probability;

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.570
not really that you care very
much about the joint

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.360
probability.
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.384
I suspect you haven't stayed up
late nights worrying about joint

00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:36.280
probability.
 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.565
But anyhow, if you want to
handle things with more than one

00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:42.848
electron, you have to have a
two-electron wave function.

00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:46.299
And if we could do it from
one-electron wave functions,

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.788
then we're really in a good
position.

00:02:48.788 --> 00:02:53.355
But we ended the first quarter
of the semester on a downer,

00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:58.080
the idea that there's no way
electrons can be independent.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.022
They repel one another,
so orbitals are fundamentally

00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:02.629
wrong.
 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.639
Okay?
 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.659
So forget that.
 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.259
And here's our paradise;
it's gone.

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:12.080
Okay?
 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.838
But are there tricks that would
allow us to salvage orbitals,

00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:18.282
to use them,
even though we know they're

00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:18.908
wrong?
 

00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:22.248
Okay, well the first,
the simple-minded trick,

00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:24.030
is Z-effective.
 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.068
We talked about how you could
scale the one-electron wave

00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:31.889
functions, the atomic orbitals,
for nuclear charge;

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.758
if you increase the nuclear
charge they contract;

00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:37.910
and we saw what different
properties are proportional to.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.378
So if you have other electrons
in the atom,

00:03:42.378 --> 00:03:47.840
it could be that they could be
sort of approximated,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.071
as if they were just reducing
the nuclear charge,

00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.610
right?
 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.312
There's a certain repulsion,
as well as an attraction taking

00:03:54.312 --> 00:03:56.330
place, if there are other
electrons there.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.240
But maybe we can just reduce
the attraction -- right?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.875
-- and things will be sort of
-- at least corrected in the

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:04.895
right direction.
 

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:05.468
Right?
 

00:04:05.468 --> 00:04:09.412
So pretend that the other
electrons, or some fraction of

00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:12.280
them, are concentrated at the
nucleus.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.199
So from the point of view of an
electron you're thinking about,

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.990
they just reduce the nuclear
charge;

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.024
and that's a problem we know
how to handle,

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.350
what happens if you change the
nuclear charge.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.050
Okay?
 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.620
So might there be an effective
nuclear charge that we could

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.990
use?
 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.851
So we pretend the other
electrons just reduce the

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:32.129
nuclear charge for the electron
we're interested in,

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.274
the orbital,
the one-electron wave function

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.449
that we want to find.
 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.482
So we're going to just to try
to find a one-electron wave

00:04:38.482 --> 00:04:40.540
function in a many-electron
problem.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.730
Okay?
 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.670
And this is what we know,
that 1s looks like that

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.810
and ρ scales with
Z.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.565
So if I just reduce Z a
little bit, maybe I get

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:52.011
something at least that's
corrected in the right

00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:52.740
direction.
 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.660
Okay now, these guys,
Clemente and Raimondi,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.819
who worked at IBM in the early
days,

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.456
when IBM was the only place
that had computers that were as

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:07.050
powerful as your laptop,
or almost as powerful as your

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.913
laptop,
they did things like this,

00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:11.019
where they did good quality
calculations,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.545
better than this,
and then tried to match the

00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:17.992
wave functions they got,
by adjusting Z,

00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:21.202
so they looked like the wave
functions that you get with

00:05:21.202 --> 00:05:22.485
better approximations.
 

00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:23.069
Right?
 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.829
So they got a best fit to
better calculation.

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:29.050
So they found that helium --
which has two electrons;

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.740
so it has a nuclear charge of
two;

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.355
Z=2 -- you get electrons
distributed, more or less right,

00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:42.185
if you pretend that the nuclear
charge is 1.69,

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:43.970
instead of 2.
 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.860
Okay?
 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.391
So each electron sort of what's
called 'screens' the electron

00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:51.959
from the nucleus.
 

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:52.790
Right?
 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:59.910
Okay, now in the case of
carbon, which has Z=6,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.773
you can also use Z_eff,
but it's different depending on

00:06:03.773 --> 00:06:06.180
which electron you're talking
about.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.689
Why would that be so?
 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.939
Why would it be that you'd use
a different screening constant,

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:15.124
or a different effective
Z, if you're talking

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:18.694
about the 1s orbital,
than if you're talking about

00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:20.269
the 2s orbital say?
 

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:23.180
Why would it be different,
how much you want to reduce the

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.050
nuclear charge?
 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.740
Sherwin?
 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.310
Student: 
&gt;.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.615
Prof: Yes,
the electrons that are outside,

00:06:30.615 --> 00:06:31.720
you don't care about.
 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.812
It's the electrons that are
between you and the nucleus that

00:06:34.812 --> 00:06:36.595
are screening you from the
nucleus.

00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:37.120
Right?
 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.819
So a 1s is already
really close to the nucleus.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.865
There's very little other
electron density that's inside

00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:43.031
it.
 

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:43.529
Right?
 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.540
That's why in helium it wasn't
screened very much.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.815
But in the case of carbon,
the 1s electrons,

00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:55.348
which are way down near the
nucleus, have an effective

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:58.170
charge that's almost 6;
5.67.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.745
But the 2s have 3.22.
 

00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:02.639
Right?
 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.581
The 1s electrons are all
down inside and making the

00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:08.516
nuclear charge appear small.
 

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:09.139
Right?
 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.475
And to a certain extent the
other, the 2p electrons,

00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:14.855
are also inside;
to a certain extent,

00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:17.819
but not as much inside as the
1s is.

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:19.180
So 3.22.
 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.971
And the Z_eff for
2p is different than for

00:07:21.971 --> 00:07:24.278
2s;
it's 3.14.

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.610
What do you notice about those
two numbers?

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.759
You might think they'd be more
or less the same;

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:30.699
and they are more or less the
same.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:34.379
But 2s is slightly less
screened.

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:39.480
It sees more of the nucleus
than the 2p does.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.110
Okay?
 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.654
So it looks like 2s gets
more down inside than 2p

00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:47.279
does.
 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:50.860
Does that surprise you?
 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.019
Russell?
 

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.035
Student:  No,
because the 2p orbital

00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:55.680
dumbbell doesn't have anything
at all.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.879
Prof: Yes,
the dumbbell doesn't have

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.137
anything at the nucleus.
 

00:07:59.137 --> 00:07:59.610
Right?
 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.300
It's got a node at the nucleus.
 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.711
Whereas 2s has that
first little core,

00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:06.891
down in -- the stuff that's
inside its first spherical node

00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.029
is down quite close to the
nucleus.

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:10.970
Now we could look at that.
 

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.649
There's what 2s looks
like, and here's the probability

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:17.961
distribution that we talked
about: r^2 times the

00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:19.680
radial function squared.
 

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.379
So this stuff that's in here is
inside.

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.295
If we compare it with the
2p orbital,

00:08:25.295 --> 00:08:28.278
you see that this part is way
down inside.

00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:31.805
It's not being screened by the
2p electrons.

00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:32.370
Right?
 

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.960
In fact, we could also look at
the 1s.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.418
This is how the 1s is
distributed.

00:08:37.418 --> 00:08:37.908
Right?
 

00:08:37.908 --> 00:08:40.509
So the 1s will screen
this.

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:43.870
And of course it screens this
part of the 2s,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.440
and it screens this of the
2p.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.067
But it's not really trivial to
look at this and figure out

00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:52.360
which one would be more
screened,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.971
the 2s or the 2p,
because this part is further in

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:01.259
than this part,
but this part is way down

00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:01.788
inside.
 

00:09:01.788 --> 00:09:04.447
So it's a balancing act as to
exactly which one would be

00:09:04.447 --> 00:09:06.428
bigger, and they're not very
different.

00:09:06.428 --> 00:09:08.592
But as it turned out,
according to Clemente and

00:09:08.592 --> 00:09:11.518
Raimondi and their calculations,
the Z_eff that you

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:14.533
should use for 2s is a
little bit bigger than the one

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:16.169
you should use for 2p.
 

00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:17.048
Kevin?
 

00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:20.260
Student:  Why are there
two peaks for 2s instead

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.629
of 1?
 

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:22.120
Prof: Because there's a
radial node;

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.460
remember 2-ρ,
the function is 2-ρ.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.340
So here's a_o;
2 a_o,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.919
when the distance is two;
two minus two is zero;

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:34.080
there's a node there.
 

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.620
Okay?
 

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.918
And it's been squared of course.
 

00:09:36.918 --> 00:09:41.039
The wave function changes sign,
but here we square it.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:45.429
Any other questions about this?
 

00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:48.019
Okay, now let's look at sodium.
 

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:50.450
So sodium has a nuclear charge
of eleven,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.460
and you won't be surprised to
see that Z_eff_

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.470
for the 1s
electrons of sodium is 10.63;

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.039
almost 11, they are very little
screened.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:01.340
2s is 6.57.
 

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.320
2p is 6.8.
 

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.282
But 3s is only 2 and a
half, because it's further out

00:10:07.282 --> 00:10:07.820
still.
 

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:13.090
So there are more electrons
inside, hiding the nucleus.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.649
Everybody got the idea of
what's going on here?

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:17.929
You'll notice one thing sort of
funny here.

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:19.590
Do you notice what?
 

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.230
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.110
Prof: John?
 

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.730
Student:  The 2p
is higher than --

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.320
Prof: Ah,
it turns around!

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.966
This time it's vice-versa.
 

00:10:26.966 --> 00:10:27.408
Right?
 

00:10:27.408 --> 00:10:29.509
So it's a balancing act,
and who knows?

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:31.980
And there's nothing fundamental
about this.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.456
This was just adjusted by
Clemente and Raimondi,

00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:39.673
in order to get shapes that
looked pretty much like better

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:41.080
quality shapes.
 

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:47.330
Okay, so it's a very subtle
thing.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.000
But this is very crude. Right?
 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.519
Nobody argues that it's the
last word.

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.700
So isn't there a better way to
do it?

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.365
And there is a better way to do
it, to get back to orbitals,

00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:04.240
even for many-electron
problems, and that's called

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.928
Self-Consistent Field,
or SCF.

00:11:06.928 --> 00:11:11.450
And it's a recipe for
calculating orbitals;

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.629
for calculating better orbitals
than you would get with an

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:17.168
effective-Z.
 

00:11:17.168 --> 00:11:21.183
So first you go through all the
electrons in an atom,

00:11:21.183 --> 00:11:24.349
or a molecule,
and you find an approximate

00:11:24.349 --> 00:11:26.890
form of the orbitals;
for example,

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.845
you could use Z_eff,
to get something that's sort of

00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:30.610
approximate.
 

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:31.408
Okay?
 

00:11:31.408 --> 00:11:34.928
So you have approximate wave
functions, square them;

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:37.684
you have approximate
distributions for all the

00:11:37.684 --> 00:11:38.418
electrons.
 

00:11:38.418 --> 00:11:40.873
Now with Z_eff_
what we were pretending

00:11:40.873 --> 00:11:43.549
was that a certain fraction of
the other electrons are on the

00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:46.860
nucleus,
and the rest of them we forget;

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.809
that's pretty crude.
 

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:49.389
Okay?
 

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:52.163
Now what we're going to do is
pretend we know,

00:11:52.163 --> 00:11:55.245
at least approximately,
how the other electrons are

00:11:55.245 --> 00:11:58.110
distributed in a cloud;
the other electrons.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.325
We're interested in one
electron, an orbital.

00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:01.908
Right?
 

00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:05.826
Now how will knowing how the
other electrons are distributed

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:08.745
help us find the orbital we're
interested in,

00:12:08.745 --> 00:12:11.070
the one-electron wave function?
 

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.668
What do you need in order to
solve a quantum mechanical

00:12:13.668 --> 00:12:14.149
problem?
 

00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:17.379
You need the mass of the
electron -- that's easy.

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:19.299
What else do you need?
 

00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:21.808
The potential law;
what its energy is,

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:23.940
its potential energy at
different positions.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.820
But if you know where the
nucleus is,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.879
or nuclei, and you know the
cloud of the other electrons,

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:33.168
and assume they're just static
clouds,

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:37.110
then you can -- it's laborious,
you need a computer to do it --

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.787
but you can calculate the
potential that the electron

00:12:39.787 --> 00:12:42.807
you're interested in would have,
at different positions,

00:12:42.807 --> 00:12:45.769
if there were this fixed cloud
of other electrons and the

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:46.298
nuclei.
 

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:49.299
So you have the potential law,
which means you can find your

00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:50.470
one-electron orbital.
 

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.850
Okay?
 

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.019
Does everybody see the strategy
here?

00:12:55.019 --> 00:12:57.750
So we're going to do it one
electron at a time.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.788
So we fix all the other
electrons, all but one,

00:13:01.788 --> 00:13:05.201
from some crummy estimate,
like Z_eff_ or

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.552
something like that,
calculate the potential for the

00:13:08.552 --> 00:13:10.778
one electron we're interested
in,

00:13:10.778 --> 00:13:14.091
and then we get -- use that
potential to calculate an

00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:17.721
orbital for that one electron
that's better than if we had

00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:18.869
used Z_eff.
 

00:13:18.869 --> 00:13:19.570
Right?
 

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.229
Because it's not just putting a
certain fraction of the other

00:13:22.229 --> 00:13:24.799
electrons at the nucleus,
it's treating them as a cloud.

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:26.070
Okay?
 

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:30.883
So now we have a much better
guess for that one electron than

00:13:30.883 --> 00:13:34.173
we would've had earlier with
Z_eff,

00:13:34.173 --> 00:13:36.580
or whatever type of guess.
 

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.808
What do you do next?
 

00:13:38.808 --> 00:13:41.419
Student:  Do it for
every orbital.

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:42.269
Prof: Dana?
 

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:43.215
Student:  You do it for
every other orbital,

00:13:43.215 --> 00:13:43.480
in sequence.
 

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.779
Prof: Ah, one at a time.
 

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:48.130
You now know how that one is
distributed in the cloud,

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:48.889
much better.
 

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:49.460
Right?
 

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.717
And you take all the others but
one, fix them in their

00:13:52.717 --> 00:13:54.009
approximate clouds.
 

00:13:54.009 --> 00:13:57.530
Now you calculate a potential
for the second electron,

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.860
and do that trick.
 

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.460
Okay, so we repeat steps two
and three to improve the orbital

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.840
for another electron.
 

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.538
Then what do we do?
 

00:14:07.538 --> 00:14:09.509
Will, what would you do,
at this point?

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:11.269
Student:  See how it
changes shape?

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:12.370
Prof: Well yes,
it'll change shape.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.159
That second electron will have
a better shape now.

00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:16.058
So you've got that.
 

00:14:16.058 --> 00:14:18.509
You've got a good shape for the
first electron.

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:21.750
Now you've got an improved
shape for the second electron.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:22.908
What do you do?
 

00:14:22.908 --> 00:14:25.320
Student:  Start from
step one or the first electron.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.111
Prof: Or you go,
if there's -- what if there are

00:14:27.111 --> 00:14:27.710
three electrons?
 

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.519
Student:  Do all three
again.

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:32.320
Prof: No,
you do the third one.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.169
Student:  Oh yes,
definitely.

00:14:33.169 --> 00:14:33.720
Prof: Right?
 

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.726
And then the fourth,
fifth, sixth,

00:14:34.726 --> 00:14:36.009
until you get through all the
electrons.

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:36.909
And then?
 

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:37.559
Student:  Start over.
 

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:38.658
Prof: Start over.
 

00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:41.798
So you improve all the
orbitals, one by one,

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:45.960
and then you cycle back to
improve the first one again;

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.929
go through them all.
 

00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:48.110
Then what do you do?
 

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.070
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.830
Prof: Start again.
 

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.490
Then what do you do?
 

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.419
This is why it's good to have a
computer, right?

00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:57.129
Then what do you do?
 

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:58.808
When do you stop?
 

00:14:58.808 --> 00:15:00.190
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:00.778
Student:  When they stop
changing.

00:15:00.778 --> 00:15:01.840
Prof: They'll stop
changing;

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.076
at least -- it'll be like
Erwin meets Goldilocks

00:15:04.076 --> 00:15:06.808
where it's out in eighth decimal
place that things are changing.

00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:09.779
So then you know you've got it
as close as is reasonable to go.

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:10.769
So you stop.
 

00:15:10.769 --> 00:15:14.379
And what do you call it,
when you get to that situation

00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:15.450
when you stop?
 

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.360
The system is self-consistent.
 

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.038
Right?
 

00:15:19.038 --> 00:15:22.179
That's why it's a
self-consistent field.

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:23.470
Okay?
 

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.960
So you quit when the orbital
steps -- shapes stop changing.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.610
So now you have the right wave
functions, the right orbitals.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.860
So now we've got the real thing.
 

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.120
Right, or wrong?
 

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.909
What could be wrong?
 

00:15:38.909 --> 00:15:41.928
We've got it self-consistent.
 

00:15:41.928 --> 00:15:45.716
Where's the weakness in the
assumption on which we've been

00:15:45.716 --> 00:15:46.580
doing this?
 

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.639
Kevin?
 

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:50.985
Student:  Well you're
assuming fixed positions for the

00:15:50.985 --> 00:15:51.710
other ones.
 

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.629
Prof: I'm assuming what?
 

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:54.408
Student:  You're
assuming fixed positions for the

00:15:54.408 --> 00:15:54.830
other ones.
 

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.538
Prof: You're assuming
that all those other electrons,

00:15:57.538 --> 00:16:00.110
except the one you're working
on, are fixed in clouds.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.230
But they're not fixed. Right?
 

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.460
The electrons can move around.
 

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.720
So depending on where your
electron happens to be,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.546
those other electrons may
change their shape,

00:16:13.546 --> 00:16:15.720
at any given instant.
 

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.480
Okay, it's still wrong,
because real electrons are not

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.495
fixed in clouds;
they keep out of each other's

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:23.787
way by correlating their motion.
 

00:16:23.787 --> 00:16:24.360
Right?
 

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.976
They don't move independently
so that this one is a cloud and

00:16:26.976 --> 00:16:28.940
when this moves around it,
nothing happens.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.995
As this one moves,
when it gets near this place,

00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:33.360
this one gets away.
 

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.269
Okay?
 

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:37.798
So they keep out of other ways
by correlating their motion.

00:16:37.798 --> 00:16:43.399
So the true energy must be
lower, more favorable,

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:45.850
than you calculate by
self-consistent field,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.961
because the orbitals are able
to get away from where you think

00:16:48.961 --> 00:16:49.830
they should be.
 

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.740
Is everybody clear on why the
limit goes in that direction;

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.720
why the true energy is lower?
 

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.330
Because the electrons are
smarter than you are.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.360
They know to get out of each
other's way;

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.710
or at least than you pretended.
 

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.039
Okay?
 

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:07.750
So what do you do?
 

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.863
You hide the residual error so
that people won't embarrass you

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:15.505
by saying, "What the heck
were you thinking?"

00:17:15.505 --> 00:17:16.180
Right?
 

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.140
You say that when you go to the
Hartree-Fock limit --

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.560
which is a fancy name,
named after two people that

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.180
thought of doing this
self-consistent field thing,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.068
or thought of a method for
doing it --

00:17:27.068 --> 00:17:29.940
when you get to the
Hartree-Fock limit,

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.272
that's a self-consistent field,
but there's going to be an

00:17:34.272 --> 00:17:36.630
error because of correlation.
 

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.827
So you give it a fancy name so
people will think,

00:17:39.827 --> 00:17:42.759
"ah, what in the heck is
that?";

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:43.928
they must really know a lot.
 

00:17:43.928 --> 00:17:44.220
Right?
 

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:44.920
&gt;
 

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.960
Prof: So what do you
call the error?

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.140
Do you call it error?
 

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:50.818
No way.
 

00:17:50.818 --> 00:17:53.338
Sophie, do you know what you
call it?

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.328
Student:  Correlation
energy.

00:17:54.328 --> 00:17:56.300
Prof: Correlation
energy.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:56.808
Right?
 

00:17:56.808 --> 00:17:59.339
There is no such thing as
correlation energy.

00:17:59.339 --> 00:18:01.308
That's not a fundamental energy.
 

00:18:01.308 --> 00:18:04.775
It's not like Coulomb's Law or
gravity or something like that.

00:18:04.775 --> 00:18:05.230
Right?
 

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.376
It's just the error you make
when you do self-consistent

00:18:08.376 --> 00:18:10.608
field, that the true energy is
lower.

00:18:10.608 --> 00:18:12.983
Now if you want to measure
correlation energy,

00:18:12.983 --> 00:18:14.410
what do you have to know?
 

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.068
Student:  True energy.
 

00:18:16.068 --> 00:18:18.597
Prof: You got to know
the true energy,

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.954
so that you know how bad your
estimate is.

00:18:20.954 --> 00:18:21.528
Right?
 

00:18:21.528 --> 00:18:24.242
And where do you get the
correct energy,

00:18:24.242 --> 00:18:28.210
or the true electron density
that you have an error in?

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.160
Student:  Experiment.
 

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.108
Prof: You get it from
experiment.

00:18:31.108 --> 00:18:35.599
Or you get it from some
whopping calculation that's not

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:37.680
as simple as SCF,
Okay?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.366
For example,
there's a thing called

00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:41.202
"configuration
interaction",

00:18:41.202 --> 00:18:43.834
which we won't know anything
about, and don't need to.

00:18:43.834 --> 00:18:44.430
Right?
 

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.220
But it's a much more
complicated calculation.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.407
It takes into account the fact
that electrons keep out of each

00:18:50.407 --> 00:18:51.140
other's way.
 

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.491
Or there's another one called
"density functional

00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:57.150
theory",
which is also approximate.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.460
They're all approximations.
 

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.630
You can't solve the real
equation.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.101
But these are better
approximations than just

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.450
self-consistent field.
 

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.920
Okay?
 

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.249
But they're hard to think
about, because they involve so

00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:12.640
much manipulation that it's hard
to reason about them.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.839
Self-consistent field is easier
to understand.

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:17.078
Okay?
 

00:19:17.078 --> 00:19:21.746
So if we're really lucky
though, correlation energy might

00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:24.644
be negligible;
it might be so small we don't

00:19:24.644 --> 00:19:26.856
care about it,
in which case we're golden,

00:19:26.856 --> 00:19:28.259
for practical purposes.
 

00:19:28.259 --> 00:19:31.147
We can use orbitals,
self-consistent field orbitals,

00:19:31.147 --> 00:19:34.150
treat things as if they were
independent electrons.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.480
Okay?
 

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.690
And then we're in business.
 

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:38.470
Okay?
 

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.215
So we should think about the
magnitude of energies and

00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:45.042
whether we care about
correlation energy,

00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:47.730
this error that is orbital
theory.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.509
What do I mean by saying
orbital theory?

00:19:52.509 --> 00:19:53.838
What's an orbital?
 

00:19:53.838 --> 00:19:55.279
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:56.680
Prof: A one-electron
wave function.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.598
But we're trying to understand
many-electron problems.

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:03.506
Can we analyze many-electron
problems as sums of

00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:06.913
one-electrons,
as sums of things that come

00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:08.410
from orbitals?
 

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.516
Is the whole equal to the sum
of the parts,

00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:11.868
the parts being orbitals?
 

00:20:11.868 --> 00:20:14.721
We know that orbitals have to
be fundamentally wrong,

00:20:14.721 --> 00:20:17.847
but if the error is -- if the
correlation energy is really

00:20:17.847 --> 00:20:19.220
small, we don't care.
 

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.048
So should we care about the
error in orbital theory?

00:20:22.048 --> 00:20:25.365
So here is a scale,
a logarithmic scale,

00:20:25.365 --> 00:20:29.363
of energy changes that occur
when things happen,

00:20:29.363 --> 00:20:32.849
and how big are these energy
changes.

00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:34.279
Let's start at the beginning.
 

00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:37.570
So we take a bunch of neutrons
and protons and bring them

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.392
together to make a nucleus,
and energy comes out.

00:20:40.392 --> 00:20:40.980
Right?
 

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:46.268
And the amount of energy that
is given off when a C-12 nucleus

00:20:46.268 --> 00:20:49.650
is formed is 2*10^9
kilocalories/mol.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:50.838
How do I know?
 

00:20:50.838 --> 00:20:54.430
Because I look at the mass,
the rest mass of the proton and

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.092
the neutron, and I look at the
mass of C-12,

00:20:57.092 --> 00:20:59.507
and mass was lost when it came
together.

00:20:59.507 --> 00:21:00.250
Right?
 

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:05.147
And the amount of mass lost,
E=mc^2, is 0.1 atomic mass

00:21:05.147 --> 00:21:09.230
units, which is 2*10^9^(
)kilocalories/mol.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.569
So that's a lot of energy.
 

00:21:11.569 --> 00:21:12.319
Okay?
 

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:16.240
Now so we got C^+6.
 

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.468
Now we're going to put two
electrons on it,

00:21:18.468 --> 00:21:20.219
the 1s electrons of
carbon.

00:21:20.219 --> 00:21:20.750
Right?
 

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.778
Bingo!
 

00:21:21.778 --> 00:21:25.700
And that gives us 2*10^4
kilocalories/mol,

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.569
given off when that happens.
 

00:21:28.569 --> 00:21:29.180
Okay?
 

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.058
Now that is our old,
familiar friend.

00:21:32.058 --> 00:21:36.150
What do you notice about the
ratio of these energies?

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.078
10^5, right?
 

00:21:38.078 --> 00:21:41.067
So it's 10^5 smaller,
like the ratio of my hair to

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:42.411
the width of the room.
 

00:21:42.411 --> 00:21:42.960
Right?
 

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.723
So much, much smaller energy
involved in putting electrons

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:50.289
into the 1s shell of
carbon, than in putting the

00:21:50.289 --> 00:21:52.140
carbon nucleus together.
 

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.390
Okay?
 

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.547
Then we're going to put the
four valence electrons onto

00:21:56.547 --> 00:21:57.599
carbon -- right?
 

00:21:57.599 --> 00:21:59.410
-- the 2s and 2p.
 

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.630
And with that we get another
3*10^3.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.990
So it's an order of magnitude
less.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.971
The 1s electrons are
bound much more strongly than

00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:12.973
the 2s and 2p;
and you know that,

00:22:12.973 --> 00:22:17.650
from this scaling,
Z^2/n^2.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.200
Okay?
 

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.165
Because you could use
Z_eff to guess how the

00:22:21.165 --> 00:22:24.665
1s's are affecting the
energies -- the nuclear charge

00:22:24.665 --> 00:22:26.088
for the 2s's.
 

00:22:26.088 --> 00:22:29.277
So you could lower the nuclear
charge from six to four,

00:22:29.277 --> 00:22:32.818
because there are already two
electrons way down in there;

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:34.640
and then you have that
n^2^( )as well.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.978
So you could scale the energy
and find that it's an order of

00:22:37.978 --> 00:22:38.940
magnitude less.
 

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.009
Okay.
 

00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:46.298
So then what are we going to do
next, now that we have atoms?

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.259
Going to put them together to
make bonds.

00:22:48.259 --> 00:22:49.140
Okay.
 

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.005
So we make four single bonds
from carbon, but they're to

00:22:53.005 --> 00:22:54.130
other carbons.
 

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.932
So for this one carbon we
should count only half of each

00:22:56.932 --> 00:22:57.848
energy -- right?
 

00:22:57.848 --> 00:23:00.230
-- because of half of it we'll
assign to the other carbon.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.124
So half of four single bonds --
a single bond is order of

00:23:04.124 --> 00:23:06.420
magnitude 100 kilocalories/mol.
 

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.650
So that's about 200
kilocalories/mol.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:12.255
So another order of magnitude
down, the energy in making

00:23:12.255 --> 00:23:12.779
bonds.
 

00:23:12.779 --> 00:23:13.808
Okay?
 

00:23:13.808 --> 00:23:16.460
And then we can have non-bonded
contacts.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.480
Now there are different kinds
of non-bonded interactions

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.578
between molecules.
 

00:23:20.578 --> 00:23:23.519
But typically,
to be worth talking about,

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:27.710
they're in the range of one to
twenty kilocalories/mol;

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:32.528
so another order of magnitude
down, or more.

00:23:32.528 --> 00:23:36.105
Okay, and the weakest of all,
the weakest bond known,

00:23:36.105 --> 00:23:39.130
or interaction known,
attractive interaction,

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.328
is between two helium atoms.
 

00:23:41.328 --> 00:23:44.596
It turns out that two helium
atoms, although they don't form

00:23:44.596 --> 00:23:47.001
a bond, are attractive;
you know, things at long

00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:49.390
distance are attractive and then
they become repulsive.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:54.390
So the minimum energy distance
is fifty-two angstroms -- right?

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.390
-- thirty-some times as long as
a normal bond.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:03.917
And the depth of that well,
how favorable is that energy,

00:24:03.917 --> 00:24:08.170
is 2*10^-6 kilocalories/mol;
so that's nothing.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.214
But all these things we're
looking at down below here are

00:24:12.214 --> 00:24:14.309
all based on Coulomb's Law.
 

00:24:14.309 --> 00:24:16.220
The first one was not. Right?
 

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.490
The nuclear binding energy is
not Coulomb's Law.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.160
But all these others are
Coulomb's Law.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:28.807
But they're all 10^5^(,) up to
10^15,^( )times weaker than what

00:24:28.807 --> 00:24:31.490
goes on in the nucleus.
 

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.130
And that means if you made any
error,

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.240
at all, in the energy of the
nucleus,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.795
it would completely wipe out
anything that had to do with

00:24:43.795 --> 00:24:45.176
Coulomb's energy.
 

00:24:45.176 --> 00:24:45.910
Right?
 

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.650
Because it's so much bigger.
 

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:51.250
So an infinitesimal error in
nuclear energy,

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.440
or change in nuclear energy
during a reaction,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.647
would completely wipe out
everything that we're talking

00:24:57.647 --> 00:24:58.005
about.
 

00:24:58.005 --> 00:24:58.538
Right?
 

00:24:58.538 --> 00:25:01.885
So this sounds like we would
really worry about it,

00:25:01.885 --> 00:25:05.968
except -- so a 0.001% change in
nuclear energy would overwhelm

00:25:05.968 --> 00:25:07.373
everything Coulombic.
 

00:25:07.373 --> 00:25:08.108
Right?
 

00:25:08.108 --> 00:25:13.240
But fortunately nuclear energy
doesn't care about chemistry.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.096
If you change from one
arrangement of atoms to another,

00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:19.954
the nuclear energy doesn't
change at all.

00:25:19.954 --> 00:25:20.670
Right?
 

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.119
So why is that good?
 

00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:27.390
You can just cancel it out.
 

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.390
The starting material and
products of any reaction have

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.278
exactly the same nuclear energy.
 

00:25:32.278 --> 00:25:36.200
So if you're not a physicist,
you can just forget nuclear

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.930
energy, even though it's so
enormous.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:39.460
Okay?
 

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.940
Is that clear?
 

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.022
So forget nuclear energy,
we don't have to worry about

00:25:43.022 --> 00:25:43.220
it.
 

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.759
All we have to worry about are
these Coulomb things.

00:25:45.759 --> 00:25:49.960
Now, so black that out.
 

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.509
Okay.
 

00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:53.368
Now here's how big correlation
energy is.

00:25:53.368 --> 00:25:55.556
It depends on what problem
you're dealing with,

00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:58.171
how big the molecule is,
what kind of atoms there are in

00:25:58.171 --> 00:25:58.980
the molecule.
 

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.710
The error you make in SCF is
different, for different cases.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.819
But for the kind of cases we're
interested in,

00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:09.208
normal organic molecules,
it's of the order of 100

00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:10.660
kilocalories/mol.
 

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.069
Now that's an error.
 

00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:17.190
Do you care about that error?
 

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.693
The error in nuclear energy,
an error, would have been

00:26:20.693 --> 00:26:23.670
enormous and completely wiped
anything out.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.318
Is this enormous?
 

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:32.170
Do we care about an error of
100 kilocalories/mol?

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.858
Do we?
 

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:41.529
Would you care about an error
of -- Devin, what do you say?

00:26:41.529 --> 00:26:44.048
Would you care if you made an
error of 100 kilocalories/mol?

00:26:44.048 --> 00:26:49.308
How big is that in the scale of
things we're talking about?

00:26:49.308 --> 00:26:50.759
Student:  Doesn't seem
too big.

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:52.308
Prof: Compared to what?
 

00:26:52.308 --> 00:26:53.170
Student:  That's the
question.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:53.930
&gt;
 

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.460
Prof: Yes.
 

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.309
What are we interested in?
 

00:26:57.309 --> 00:26:57.970
Student:  Bonds.
 

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.700
Prof: Bonds.
 

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.460
How big is it compared to bonds?
 

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.558
Student:  Fifty times as
big.

00:27:01.558 --> 00:27:02.369
Prof: It's as big as a
bond.

00:27:02.369 --> 00:27:04.358
A bond is 100 kilocalories/mol.
 

00:27:04.358 --> 00:27:09.059
That means that we're -- that's
a disaster -- right?

00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:10.920
-- unless what?
 

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.470
The nuclear would've been a
disaster too.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.548
Why isn't it?
 

00:27:15.548 --> 00:27:17.819
Errors in nuclear energy are
not a disaster.

00:27:17.819 --> 00:27:18.519
Why?
 

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:20.980
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.640
Prof: Because they don't
change.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.009
The starting material and the
product have the same.

00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:27.858
So the same thing would be true
here.

00:27:27.858 --> 00:27:30.740
If correlation energy didn't
change,

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.743
from one arrangement of atoms
to another arrangement of the

00:27:33.743 --> 00:27:35.959
same atoms,
then it would just cancel out

00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:37.140
and you wouldn't care.
 

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.940
Everybody got that idea?
 

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.002
Okay, so the correlation energy
is about equal to the magnitude

00:27:45.002 --> 00:27:45.788
of a bond.
 

00:27:45.788 --> 00:27:47.805
But how big are
changes in

00:27:47.805 --> 00:27:50.387
correlation energy,
when you change the arrangement

00:27:50.387 --> 00:27:51.058
of atoms?
 

00:27:51.058 --> 00:27:56.607
Well changes tend to be about
10 to 15% as big as bond energy,

00:27:56.607 --> 00:28:00.608
or 10 to 15% as big as
correlation energy.

00:28:00.608 --> 00:28:02.650
So correlation energy does
change.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:06.292
You make different errors for
different arrangements of the

00:28:06.292 --> 00:28:07.108
same atoms.
 

00:28:07.108 --> 00:28:11.210
But those errors are about 10
to 15% as big as a bond.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.430
Now do you care about
correlation?

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.650
You don't care as much.
 

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.028
So you'll get approximate ideas.
 

00:28:19.028 --> 00:28:24.102
If you don't care within -- if
you're satisfied with getting

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:28.660
about 80% of the right answer,
then you don't care.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.880
Okay?
 

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.926
So that implies that orbital
theory is fine,

00:28:32.926 --> 00:28:36.328
as long as what you're
interested in is answering

00:28:36.328 --> 00:28:40.369
qualitative, rather than fine
quantitative questions.

00:28:40.369 --> 00:28:40.990
Okay?
 

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.240
So if you want to get numbers
really right,

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.948
and the magnitude of the number
really makes a difference to

00:28:45.948 --> 00:28:47.699
you,
a few percent change,

00:28:47.699 --> 00:28:51.509
then you have to do something
better than use orbitals.

00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:52.298
Okay?
 

00:28:52.298 --> 00:28:55.589
But if you just want to
understand why bonds work,

00:28:55.589 --> 00:28:57.269
then orbitals are fine.
 

00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:58.298
Okay?
 

00:28:58.298 --> 00:29:02.630
Because the changes in
correlation energy aren't that

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:03.130
big.
 

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:07.617
So, but for these properties,
for non-bonded contacts,

00:29:07.617 --> 00:29:12.361
especially for helium-helium,
the correlation is the only

00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:14.308
game in town often.
 

00:29:14.308 --> 00:29:16.788
That's what holds helium atoms
together.

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:19.509
Helium atoms are nuclei,
positively charged;

00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:21.589
electrons, negatively charged.
 

00:29:21.589 --> 00:29:26.069
So nucleus repels nucleus;
electrons repel electrons;

00:29:26.069 --> 00:29:30.446
nucleus attracts electrons;
nucleus attracts electrons.

00:29:30.446 --> 00:29:31.009
Right?
 

00:29:31.009 --> 00:29:33.893
At first, at fifty-three
angstroms, or fifty-two

00:29:33.893 --> 00:29:36.715
angstroms, far apart,
those essentially cancel.

00:29:36.715 --> 00:29:37.328
Right?
 

00:29:37.328 --> 00:29:42.545
But the motion of the electron
around this nucleus correlates

00:29:42.545 --> 00:29:47.240
with the motion of the electron
around this nucleus.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.348
They tend to be in-phase with
one another.

00:29:49.348 --> 00:29:53.490
So at any given time you have
plus, minus, plus,

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.838
minus, and they attract one
another.

00:29:56.838 --> 00:30:02.558
So precisely what holds helium
to helium is correlation.

00:30:02.558 --> 00:30:07.305
So if what you're interested in
is bonding, then use orbitals,

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:07.848
fine.
 

00:30:07.848 --> 00:30:11.234
But if you're interested in
non-bonded interactions,

00:30:11.234 --> 00:30:13.890
then correlation can be a big
problem.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:14.430
Okay?
 

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:18.819
But we're talking about bonds
now, not correlation.

00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:20.808
Okay, so orbitals can't be true.
 

00:30:20.808 --> 00:30:23.347
That's clear,
because electrons influence one

00:30:23.347 --> 00:30:25.308
another, they repel one another.
 

00:30:25.308 --> 00:30:27.390
If you have just one electron,
fine;

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.828
more electrons,
orbitals can't be true.

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:33.881
But still we'll use them,
to understand bonding and

00:30:33.881 --> 00:30:36.960
structure and energy and
reactivity.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.493
And we know we won't get
precise values,

00:30:40.493 --> 00:30:44.391
we'll be off by one to ten
kilocalories/mol,

00:30:44.391 --> 00:30:48.470
but we'll get insight that's
very useful.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:49.328
Okay.
 

00:30:49.328 --> 00:30:54.348
Now what gives atomic orbitals
their shape?

00:30:54.348 --> 00:30:59.432
Why does this particular
orbital have a node,

00:30:59.432 --> 00:31:01.048
for example?
 

00:31:01.048 --> 00:31:04.366
We know Coulomb's Law tends to
attract the electrons to the

00:31:04.366 --> 00:31:04.940
nucleus.
 

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:11.480
Why does it have a node and
spread out?

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.630
Because of kinetic energy --
right?

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.015
-- this curvature of wave
functions that's required to

00:31:16.015 --> 00:31:17.140
solve Schrödinger.
 

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.048
So it's kinetic energy that
gives them their shape.

00:31:20.048 --> 00:31:23.664
Or if you double the nuclear
charge, the thing gets half as

00:31:23.664 --> 00:31:24.038
big.
 

00:31:24.038 --> 00:31:27.156
That's Coulomb's Law,
sucking it in.

00:31:27.156 --> 00:31:27.868
Right?
 

00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:32.487
So the potential energy scales
the radius through the formula

00:31:32.487 --> 00:31:34.769
for ρ;
we've seen that.

00:31:34.769 --> 00:31:38.140
But the kinetic energy is what
creates nodes.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.240
So the 2s has that
spherical node.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.375
Or this orbital here has a
conical, two cones,

00:31:45.375 --> 00:31:49.328
and a spherical node;
it's the 4d orbital.

00:31:49.328 --> 00:31:52.140
So kinetic energy is what
creates the shapes.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.720
The charge just scales things
in and out.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.952
Now if we use orbitals,
how should we calculate the

00:32:01.952 --> 00:32:04.568
total electron density?
 

00:32:04.568 --> 00:32:07.358
Well we have two one-electron
wave functions.

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:10.663
We know the density of electron
one, at this position,

00:32:10.663 --> 00:32:12.660
by squaring its wave function.
 

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.809
We know the density of electron
two at that position,

00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:17.750
by squaring its wave function.
 

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.859
How do we get the total
electron density at that same

00:32:21.859 --> 00:32:22.730
position?
 

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.880
How would you get it?
 

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.881
You know how much of electron
one is there,

00:32:25.881 --> 00:32:27.119
its probability density.
 

00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:28.589
You know two.
 

00:32:28.589 --> 00:32:30.109
How do you get the total?
 

00:32:30.109 --> 00:32:34.240
ilana?
 

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.068
If you know how much of
electron one is there,

00:32:37.068 --> 00:32:39.960
and you know how much of
electron two is there,

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.789
how much total electron density
is there?

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:45.069
How would you get it?
 

00:32:45.069 --> 00:32:46.390
Can't hear very well.
 

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.170
Student:  You'd just add
them together.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.890
Prof: Yes,
add them together.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.579
A whole is the sum of its parts.
 

00:32:50.579 --> 00:32:50.980
Okay?
 

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.396
So the total density is the sum
of those two squared wave

00:32:54.396 --> 00:32:56.210
functions;
just right.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.568
But notice it's a sum;
it's not a product.

00:32:59.568 --> 00:33:01.880
This is not a question of joint
probability.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.747
It's not what's the probability
that electron one and electron

00:33:05.747 --> 00:33:07.839
two are there at the same time?
 

00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:09.368
That's not the question.
 

00:33:09.368 --> 00:33:11.848
The question is,
what's the total probability of

00:33:11.848 --> 00:33:13.380
finding any electron there?
 

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:13.798
Okay?
 

00:33:13.798 --> 00:33:16.849
So it's a sum,
it's not a product.

00:33:16.849 --> 00:33:17.730
Okay?
 

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.186
Now we had this question you
looked at before:

00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:21.990
How lumpy is the nitrogen atom?
 

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:25.364
This picture is taken from a
recent organic text and they had

00:33:25.364 --> 00:33:28.625
a fancy graphic program or an
artist or something that drew

00:33:28.625 --> 00:33:30.595
something that looks very
realistic.

00:33:30.595 --> 00:33:31.269
Right?
 

00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:33.108
But we can check it because we
know the formulas.

00:33:33.108 --> 00:33:35.990
And if we want to get the total
electron density,

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.730
we add the electron density of
the electron that's in the

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.568
p_x and the one that's in
the p_y and the one

00:33:41.568 --> 00:33:43.380
that's in the p_z
orbital.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.997
So we square them,
and we get this,

00:33:44.997 --> 00:33:47.519
and we sum it up to get the
total electron density;

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:51.602
and it's some constant times
x^2+y^2+z^2 times

00:33:51.602 --> 00:33:56.369
e^-ρ^( );
after we've squared. Right?

00:33:56.369 --> 00:33:58.589
And how can you simplify that?
 

00:33:58.589 --> 00:34:02.269
What's x^2+y^2+z^2?
 

00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:03.490
It's r^2.
 

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.150
Okay?
 

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.650
So how does it depend on
θ?

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.269
How does it depend on
φ?

00:34:10.269 --> 00:34:11.280
Elizabeth?
 

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.750
Student:  It doesn't.
 

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:12.708
Prof: It doesn't depend.
 

00:34:12.708 --> 00:34:13.449
What does it look like?
 

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:13.909
Student:  A sphere.
 

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.070
Prof: It's a sphere.
 

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.719
It's a ball.
 

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.059
It doesn't look like this thing.
 

00:34:18.059 --> 00:34:18.849
So it's spherical.
 

00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:21.606
So forget, for all the elegance
of that picture,

00:34:21.606 --> 00:34:25.152
forget it;
they're not showing you the

00:34:25.152 --> 00:34:25.889
truth.
 

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.592
Okay, or this problem we had
before of looking at the

00:34:28.592 --> 00:34:30.619
cross-section of the CN Triple
Bond,

00:34:30.619 --> 00:34:33.483
where we sliced it and turned
it and thought it might look

00:34:33.483 --> 00:34:36.474
like a cloverleaf,
or maybe some kind of diamond

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:37.809
shape or something.
 

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:39.030
But in fact it's round.
 

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.070
Why?
 

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.289
Because
(2p_x)^2+(2p_y)^2 depends

00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:48.244
on x^2+y^2,^( )which is
r^2, in two dimensions.

00:34:48.244 --> 00:34:49.070
Right?
 

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:53.963
So it's cylindrical,
doesn't depend on the angle

00:34:53.963 --> 00:34:56.360
around the bond axis.
 

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.539
Okay, so this is what we've
seen.

00:34:57.539 --> 00:35:01.230
We've seen three-dimensional
reality, hydrogen-like atoms.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:03.039
We talked about hybridization.
 

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:06.885
We saw that orbitals are
fundamentally wrong but that we

00:35:06.885 --> 00:35:10.869
can recover from the orbital
approximation and use it,

00:35:10.869 --> 00:35:14.429
if we -- for example,
with self-consistent field;

00:35:14.429 --> 00:35:17.972
as long as we're not interested
in getting the very finest

00:35:17.972 --> 00:35:21.018
energy but can be satisfied with
approximation.

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:23.586
Now we're going to move on to
something more interesting,

00:35:23.586 --> 00:35:24.550
which is molecules.
 

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:28.597
We're going to look first at
Plum-Pudding molecular orbitals,

00:35:28.597 --> 00:35:31.362
and then understanding bonds,
and overlap,

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.780
and energy-match.
 

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.862
Now there are lots of different
ways of looking at the electron

00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:36.610
distribution.
 

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.670
You know this story,
presumably, about different

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.121
blind men doing experiments on
an elephant and getting

00:35:43.121 --> 00:35:45.139
completely different ideas.
 

00:35:45.139 --> 00:35:48.199
The same is true of the
electrons in a molecule.

00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:51.260
So here's the electron density
in a hydrogen molecule.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.766
It's calculated,
but there are ways to get that

00:35:53.766 --> 00:35:56.219
kind of information
experimentally as well.

00:35:56.219 --> 00:35:57.800
So, and you know how contours
work;

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.900
it's a lot more dense near the
origin, near the nuclei.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:09.364
So which contour do we want to
look at in order to understand

00:36:09.364 --> 00:36:09.820
it?
 

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.264
Well we can choose our contour,
and we get different pictures,

00:36:13.264 --> 00:36:16.257
different understanding,
depending on which contour we

00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:16.880
choose.
 

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.318
For example,
we could choose,

00:36:19.318 --> 00:36:22.628
way down, a very high electron
density.

00:36:22.628 --> 00:36:23.500
Right?
 

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.989
And then we see just a set of
two atoms;

00:36:26.989 --> 00:36:28.737
it just looks like two atoms.
 

00:36:28.737 --> 00:36:29.159
Right?
 

00:36:29.159 --> 00:36:31.219
We don't see the fact that it's
a molecule.

00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:34.309
Where have we done this before?
 

00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:37.050
Student:
&gt;

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:40.440
Prof: Andrew?
 

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.099
Shai?
 

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:42.730
Pardon me?
 

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:43.429
Student:  Difference
density.

00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:44.690
Prof: Not difference
density.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:45.822
Student:  Well,
we were subtracting to get the

00:36:45.822 --> 00:36:46.280
difference density.
 

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.141
Prof: Yes.
 

00:36:47.141 --> 00:36:49.019
We looked at total electron
density;

00:36:49.019 --> 00:36:50.429
it just looked like atoms.
 

00:36:50.429 --> 00:36:53.125
We had to do the difference in
order to see that it was not

00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:53.730
just atoms.
 

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.480
It was essentially just atoms.
 

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.170
So if you look at high density,
you see just a set of atoms;

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.880
no excitement there.
 

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.949
So that's the molecule as a set
of atoms, just a set of atoms.

00:37:04.949 --> 00:37:05.880
Okay?
 

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.380
Or we could take a somewhat
lower electron density contour

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.880
and we'd see that the atoms are
a little bit distorted.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.800
Or we could do a difference
map, as Shai says,

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.059
in order to see that they're a
little bit distorted,

00:37:17.059 --> 00:37:20.650
because bonding distorts the
shape of the atoms a little bit.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.614
But first -- and we'll,
this is what we're going to

00:37:23.614 --> 00:37:27.155
look at shortly --
but first I want to get some

00:37:27.155 --> 00:37:31.869
insight by looking at the very
lowest electron density.

00:37:31.869 --> 00:37:35.550
So that would be molecules
formed from a set of atoms,

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.634
rather than as a set of atoms.
 

00:37:37.634 --> 00:37:38.260
Right?
 

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.630
There are little changes
because of the bonds.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.789
But how about if we look way
out there?

00:37:41.789 --> 00:37:45.695
Now, if you don't look really
close, it looks spherical,

00:37:45.695 --> 00:37:49.460
it looks just like an atom,
or almost like an atom.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.356
And if you went even further
out, it would get spherical,

00:37:52.356 --> 00:37:53.650
for all you could tell.
 

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:54.539
Okay?
 

00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:57.996
So that's the molecule looking
like an atom,

00:37:57.996 --> 00:38:02.260
with whatever number of
electrons the molecule has.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.130
So that's the molecule as one
atom.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.889
The only difference is that the
nucleus,

00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:08.869
which for an atom would be in
the middle,

00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:12.559
has been split,
to give two nuclei,

00:38:12.559 --> 00:38:16.242
which of course distorts the
shape of the electrons a little

00:38:16.242 --> 00:38:18.507
bit,
if you move -- cut the nucleus

00:38:18.507 --> 00:38:20.030
in two and split it out.
 

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.570
So we want to look at a few
molecules,

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.690
from this point of view,
as single atoms --

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:28.548
because we know about atoms now
-- but distorted by the fact

00:38:28.548 --> 00:38:31.099
that the nuclei has been split
apart.

00:38:31.099 --> 00:38:36.179
So this is nuclei embedded in a
cloud of electrons.

00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:40.434
Now what gave those electrons
their shape, the shape of the

00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:43.369
cloud in which this thing is
embedded;

00:38:43.369 --> 00:38:46.039
what gave them their shape?
 

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:48.239
We just talked about this a
short time ago.

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:49.750
What gives orbitals their shape?
 

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.300
Dana?
 

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.230
Can't hear very well.
 

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.079
Student:  A desire to be
as far apart as possible?

00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:56.409
Prof: That's potential
energy, right.

00:38:56.409 --> 00:39:00.059
But that's not what gives --
that's not what creates nodes.

00:39:00.059 --> 00:39:01.849
That just causes things to
spread out.

00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:04.438
What gives them their
characteristic shape of nodes,

00:39:04.438 --> 00:39:06.570
planar nodes,
spherical nodes and so on?

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.769
Elizabeth?
 

00:39:07.769 --> 00:39:08.360
Student:  Kinetic energy.
 

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.329
Prof: It's the kinetic
energy.

00:39:09.329 --> 00:39:12.637
And the same kinetic energy
considerations will apply in a

00:39:12.637 --> 00:39:14.090
molecule as in an atom.
 

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.469
It's always curvature of the
wave function divided by the

00:39:16.469 --> 00:39:17.150
wave function.
 

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.273
So the electrons are dispersed
by electron repulsion,

00:39:21.273 --> 00:39:25.079
and noded, given nodes,
by the kinetic energy;

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:28.112
and the kinetic energy also
causes them to spread out,

00:39:28.112 --> 00:39:29.429
as we've seen before.
 

00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:32.300
Okay, but you see then that.
 

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.355
although Thomson was wrong
about the atom,

00:39:35.355 --> 00:39:39.529
it wasn't a plum pudding of
nuclei embedded in a cloud of

00:39:39.529 --> 00:39:41.018
positive charge.
 

00:39:41.018 --> 00:39:44.000
But a molecule is
a plum pudding!

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.532
It's nuclei embedded in cloud
of negative charge,

00:39:48.532 --> 00:39:53.539
but that cloud of negative
charge is given its form by

00:39:53.539 --> 00:39:57.739
kinetic energy largely;
also potential energy,

00:39:57.739 --> 00:39:58.639
as you say.
 

00:39:58.639 --> 00:40:01.139
So it's backwards from what
Thomson thought.

00:40:01.139 --> 00:40:05.112
But his idea wasn't a silly
one, it just happened to be

00:40:05.112 --> 00:40:06.510
wrong, for atoms.
 

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.849
So here's a piece of plum
pudding;

00:40:09.849 --> 00:40:12.420
which you know is like
fruitcake.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.659
So how do the plums distort the
pudding?

00:40:16.659 --> 00:40:17.530
Right?
 

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:21.989
We know what atoms would look
like now.

00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:22.929
Right?
 

00:40:22.929 --> 00:40:25.429
But if you split the nucleus
into several nuclei,

00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:27.983
and moved them around as the
plums in the pudding,

00:40:27.983 --> 00:40:30.380
they'll change the shape of the
electrons.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:30.730
How?
 

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:34.059
That's what we want to look at
today.

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:37.824
Okay, so first we're going to
look at methane and ammonia,

00:40:37.824 --> 00:40:40.599
and we want to understand them
visually.

00:40:40.599 --> 00:40:45.809
Why do the orbitals in these
molecules have the shapes they

00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:46.260
do?
 

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:50.516
Okay, so there are four pairs
of valence electrons -- there

00:40:50.516 --> 00:40:54.701
are also two core electrons,
1s electrons on carbon

00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:56.170
and on nitrogen.
 

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.786
So we want to compare the
molecular orbitals to the atomic

00:40:59.786 --> 00:41:02.641
orbitals of neon,
which has the same number of

00:41:02.641 --> 00:41:05.190
electrons;
four electron pairs with

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.199
n=2 in the neon atom.
 

00:41:07.199 --> 00:41:08.960
So there are the same number of
electrons as neon.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.974
So they should,
at a big distance,

00:41:10.974 --> 00:41:14.273
if you look at very low
contours, it should look like a

00:41:14.273 --> 00:41:15.130
Neon atom.
 

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.639
But what does it look like as
you get closer?

00:41:17.639 --> 00:41:21.228
Okay, so here's a 1s
orbital of the Neon atom.

00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:21.780
Right?
 

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.860
And here's the 1s
orbital of methane;

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.300
it's that net that's shown,
the red net.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.050
Everybody see it?
 

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.438
And here's the -- the contour
level that we're drawing is

00:41:32.438 --> 00:41:35.222
where the orbital,
you know, which level are we

00:41:35.222 --> 00:41:36.010
choosing?
 

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.947
We're choosing 0.001
electrons/cubic angstrom is the

00:41:39.947 --> 00:41:43.036
level we've chosen to draw,
of the onion.

00:41:43.036 --> 00:41:43.809
Right?
 

00:41:43.809 --> 00:41:45.130
And here it is for nitrogen.
 

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:50.079
The blue one there is the
lowest molecular orbital.

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.780
But they're just little
spheres, right?

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:59.268
They're like the 1s of
neon.

00:41:59.268 --> 00:42:03.869
Okay, so the core orbitals are
like the 1s of the carbon

00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:05.280
or nitrogen atom.
 

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.027
They're tightly held,
they aren't distorted very much

00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:12.269
because the nuclei have split
apart, right?

00:42:12.269 --> 00:42:14.489
And they're boring.
 

00:42:14.489 --> 00:42:16.836
So forget them,
we won't talk about them

00:42:16.836 --> 00:42:17.440
anymore.
 

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.032
We'll focus on the valence
orbitals where the bonding

00:42:22.032 --> 00:42:23.800
action will occur.
 

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.110
Now, there are eight valence
electrons.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.590
That means two to an orbital.
 

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:32.349
So there'll be four molecular
orbitals that have electrons in

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:33.539
them, in methane.
 

00:42:33.539 --> 00:42:36.380
And they are arranged in energy
this way.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.137
There's a lowest energy,
and then there are three that

00:42:39.137 --> 00:42:40.750
have exactly the same energy.
 

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.818
Do you remember what we call
those when several orbitals have

00:42:43.818 --> 00:42:44.739
the same energy?
 

00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:45.360
Students:  Degenerate.
 

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.090
Prof: Degenerate. Okay?
 

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.159
So there are three degenerate
molecular orbitals for CH_4 that

00:42:50.159 --> 00:42:51.719
have exactly the same energy.
 

00:42:51.719 --> 00:42:54.539
In the case of ammonia it's a
little different.

00:42:54.539 --> 00:42:57.849
There's one lowest one,
and then there are three,

00:42:57.849 --> 00:43:01.090
but one of them is higher than
the other two;

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:02.829
there are only two degenerate
ones there.

00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:05.150
Incidentally,
what does that remind you of,

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.465
to have one that's a little bit
lower and then three that are

00:43:08.465 --> 00:43:09.570
the same energy?
 

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.000
Have you ever seen that before?
 

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.630
Student:  2p and
--

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:16.300
Prof: Ah!
 

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.639
2s and 2p,
right?

00:43:17.639 --> 00:43:21.132
There's one 2s and three
2p's, in an atom.

00:43:21.132 --> 00:43:21.639
Right?
 

00:43:21.639 --> 00:43:24.735
Here's a molecule and there's
one that's lower and then three

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:25.869
that are equivalent.
 

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:29.992
Okay, now there's the lowest
one, and it's a 2s

00:43:29.992 --> 00:43:30.768
orbital.
 

00:43:30.768 --> 00:43:35.856
It's the neon's 2s
orbital that's been distorted by

00:43:35.856 --> 00:43:41.302
taking four protons out of the
nucleus and pulling them out to

00:43:41.302 --> 00:43:44.070
be where the hydrogens are.
 

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:44.909
Okay?
 

00:43:44.909 --> 00:43:47.237
So you can see how this has
been distorted,

00:43:47.237 --> 00:43:50.338
by distorting the electron
cloud into the direction where

00:43:50.338 --> 00:43:52.389
the protons have been pulled
out.

00:43:52.389 --> 00:43:54.510
Do you see that?
 

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.836
Okay, now you don't see the --
you have to remove the ball

00:43:57.836 --> 00:44:01.280
there, that's the carbon or the
nitrogen, to see that little

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.389
spherical node.
 

00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:05.206
It's way down near the origin
that made it a 2s

00:44:05.206 --> 00:44:05.630
orbital.
 

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:06.110
Right?
 

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:07.710
That's the spherical node.
 

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:10.818
And it doesn't look like a
sphere because of the algorithm

00:44:10.818 --> 00:44:14.092
the computer uses to draw this,
connecting dots with straight

00:44:14.092 --> 00:44:14.418
lines.
 

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:15.018
Right?
 

00:44:15.018 --> 00:44:16.659
But it is more or less
spherical;

00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:19.094
a little bit distorted by the
fact that you've pulled these

00:44:19.094 --> 00:44:19.639
things out.
 

00:44:19.639 --> 00:44:23.047
Okay, now what do these
molecular -- these are molecular

00:44:23.047 --> 00:44:23.730
orbitals.
 

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:26.719
But that, you see,
is a 2p_x orbital,

00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:29.083
that's been a little bit
distorted.

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:29.780
Right?
 

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:35.067
Notice that the difference
between the CH_4 and the NH_3,

00:44:35.067 --> 00:44:41.110
there was a proton that went up
in CH_4, which pulled them up.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.960
But if you didn't have that,
it didn't go up as high.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.400
Right?
 

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.045
But then essentially this is
the 2p_x orbital of the

00:44:48.045 --> 00:44:51.693
molecule, distorted from the
atom by pulling protons out of

00:44:51.693 --> 00:44:52.699
the nucleus.
 

00:44:52.699 --> 00:44:53.260
Okay?
 

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.860
Or that one, what's that one?
 

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.184
It's 2p_y,
but you have to rotate it to

00:44:58.184 --> 00:44:58.650
see it.
 

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.771
If we rotate it 90 degrees
here, you can see that it's a

00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:03.018
2p_y orbital.
 

00:45:03.018 --> 00:45:06.804
And again, the CH_4 is
distorted at the top because two

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:09.610
protons came out and stretched
it out.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.619
Same thing in nitrogen.
 

00:45:11.619 --> 00:45:15.932
Now we go to the third of these
2p orbitals,

00:45:15.932 --> 00:45:19.775
which is different in nitrogen;
for the nitrogen case,

00:45:19.775 --> 00:45:20.590
higher in energy.
 

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:21.449
There they are.
 

00:45:21.449 --> 00:45:25.860
Why is that orbital higher in
energy than the others in

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.760
Nitrogen?
 

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.760
Why isn't it so good?
 

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.175
Because you have electrons up
in that red region that don't

00:45:32.175 --> 00:45:35.320
have a proton there;
it's not being stabilized.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:41.050
Here, the electron density that
went up is around a proton.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:44.802
There the top lobe of the
p orbital doesn't have a

00:45:44.802 --> 00:45:46.409
proton stabilizing it.
 

00:45:46.409 --> 00:45:49.530
So it's higher in energy.
 

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.429
And it turns out to be more
reactive.

00:45:51.429 --> 00:45:52.510
What do you call it?
 

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.750
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:58.039
Prof: That's the
unshared pair.

00:45:58.039 --> 00:46:01.333
The high-energy reactive
electrons are the ones that

00:46:01.333 --> 00:46:04.239
don't have a proton stabilizing
them there.

00:46:04.239 --> 00:46:07.518
Now there are also vacant
orbitals.

00:46:07.518 --> 00:46:08.289
Right?
 

00:46:08.289 --> 00:46:11.380
Remember, you could have any
number of orbitals.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.173
We're looking at the ones that
you can make from the 2s

00:46:15.173 --> 00:46:16.170
and 2p.
 

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:24.550
But we have a number of atomic
orbitals that we can use.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.434
We're looking at the lowest
set, the ones that come just

00:46:27.434 --> 00:46:29.480
from 1s orbitals of
Hydrogen,

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.719
and 2s and 2p
orbitals of carbon or nitrogen.

00:46:33.719 --> 00:46:36.610
But there are eight such
orbitals: four,

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:40.021
2s and three
2p's, on the central

00:46:40.021 --> 00:46:44.610
atom;
four on the hydrogen for CH_4.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:48.326
So there'll be a number of
other combinations you can make

00:46:48.326 --> 00:46:51.391
from mixing those,
which won't have electrons to

00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:52.369
go in them.
 

00:46:52.369 --> 00:46:53.518
But let's look at them.
 

00:46:53.518 --> 00:46:57.492
So here are the next four
orbitals made from the valence

00:46:57.492 --> 00:47:00.309
level orbitals of the atoms
involved.

00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:04.059
So what you see on CH_4 that
this is the 3s orbital.

00:47:04.059 --> 00:47:06.030
It has a radial node. Right?
 

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:08.617
Or pardon me,
yes, a radial or a spherical

00:47:08.617 --> 00:47:11.079
node here, that surrounds the
sphere.

00:47:11.079 --> 00:47:14.840
So it's red sign inside,
blue sign outside.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:20.063
The same thing is true of the
NH_3, but you have to rotate in

00:47:20.063 --> 00:47:21.630
order to see it.
 

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.172
That's the lowest vacant,
the lowest unoccupied

00:47:25.172 --> 00:47:26.510
molecular orbital.
 

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:32.409
And if we rotate it here,
you can see the inner part.

00:47:32.409 --> 00:47:35.860
And bear in mind that there are
two spherical nodes.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:40.347
There's one that's really tiny,
that's inside anything we can

00:47:40.347 --> 00:47:41.170
see here.
 

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:44.233
Okay, then there's this
orbital, which is the

00:47:44.233 --> 00:47:47.434
3d_x^2-y^2,
looked at from a funny angle

00:47:47.434 --> 00:47:50.289
where it's not very clear what
it is.

00:47:50.289 --> 00:47:56.027
But if we rotate all these by
90°, you can see that it's

00:47:56.027 --> 00:47:59.918
like that cross,
or whatever you call it,

00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:02.739
of the 3d_x^2-y^2.
 

00:48:02.739 --> 00:48:05.130
But why doesn't it look just
like that?

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.980
Why are they distorted?
 

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.760
Why does it have this funny
U-shape here.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.231
Instead of this lobe,
this lobe, here and here,

00:48:13.231 --> 00:48:15.269
the lobes moved up there.
 

00:48:15.269 --> 00:48:17.309
Why?
 

00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:18.179
Angela?
 

00:48:18.179 --> 00:48:18.849
Pardon me?
 

00:48:18.849 --> 00:48:19.570
Student:  There are
protons.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.693
Prof: That's where the
protons pulled them,

00:48:21.693 --> 00:48:22.690
the potential energy.
 

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:26.010
But the fundamental shape,
before it got distorted by the

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.679
potential energy of where the
protons are,

00:48:28.679 --> 00:48:31.960
the fundamental shape was from
the kinetic energy.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.519
It was like the
3d_x^2-y^2.

00:48:34.519 --> 00:48:36.079
Or how about this one?
 

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:40.688
There you can see -- but it's
clearer still if we rotate it --

00:48:40.688 --> 00:48:43.559
that again it's that X-shaped
thing.

00:48:43.559 --> 00:48:48.039
But the ones on top have been
pulled out by the protons.

00:48:48.039 --> 00:48:49.010
Or this one.
 

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.030
That's the one that has a
doughnut around the middle.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.501
But the doughnut has been
pulled down by the three

00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:59.969
hydrogens that aren't on the z
axis.

00:48:59.969 --> 00:49:02.650
Or there it is, rotated.
 

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:03.480
Okay?
 

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.364
Now I hoped to get -- let's
just start ethane and methanol,

00:49:07.364 --> 00:49:11.117
and then we can get to more
interesting things in it next

00:49:11.117 --> 00:49:11.719
time.
 

00:49:11.719 --> 00:49:15.230
It has a lot more pairs of
electrons, ethane and methanol.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:18.327
So we can compare those MOs to
the AOs of Argon,

00:49:18.327 --> 00:49:21.360
which has the same number of
electron pairs.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.313
Actually I should quit now and
let you get to your next

00:49:25.313 --> 00:49:26.340
appointment.

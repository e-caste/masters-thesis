00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.586
Professor Amy
Hungerford: All right.

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:06.440
I've put two quotations on the
board for your consideration.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.429
The first is from Norman Mailer.
This is from Advertisements

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.449
for Myself.
He says,

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.674
"Jack Kerouac lacks discipline,
intelligence,

00:00:15.674 --> 00:00:18.460
honesty, and a sense of the
novel."

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.987
Of course, some people might
apply those adjectives to Mailer

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:25.930
himself, but that's what Mailer
said.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.105
"On the
Road"--this is from a

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:31.655
critic named George Dardess;
this is from a 1974 article

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:35.055
about On the
Road--"is a love story,

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:39.490
not a travelogue and certainly
not a call to revolution."

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.001
So, I put these up here to sort
of sit in the background of what

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.338
I'm going to talk to you about
today about the ultimate payoff

00:00:50.338 --> 00:00:54.450
for Kerouac's effort and the
Beats' effort,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.510
more generally,
to imagine a language that is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.649
the adequate analog to
experience,

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.159
a language that is itself a
kind of experience,

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.590
and further,
that is an ecstatic,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.258
mystical kind of experience.
Last time,

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:22.910
in addition to introducing that
idea of language to you,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.973
I conducted a reading of the
first part of the novel where I

00:01:28.973 --> 00:01:35.241
suggested that Kerouac tells a
story that is not so much about

00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:41.201
the escape from an American
consumer culture of the postwar

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:46.956
period as it is a story about
the absolute immersion in a

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:53.842
culture of consumption.
So, what Sal Paradise consumes

00:01:53.842 --> 00:02:00.628
on the road extends from pie,
as I demonstrated to you by the

00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:06.684
multiple references,
the simple food that the body

00:02:06.684 --> 00:02:11.216
needs and wants;
to girls, all the women that he

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:15.826
tries to sleep with and that
Dean tries to sleep with over

00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:20.459
the course of the novel;
to money and the consumer goods

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.042
that come with it in order to
build a middle-class American

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:29.071
life with his aunt in New
York--remember he buys the

00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:32.010
icebox,
the first electric icebox of

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.139
their family,
the first refrigerator of their

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.375
family,
when he comes back from his

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:46.950
first road trip--to a kind of
mystical access to America,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.151
a history of jazz.
There's a whole set of mystical

00:02:53.151 --> 00:03:00.063
cultural artifacts that Sal
Paradise and his friends consume

00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:06.974
over the course of this novel.
So, I want to begin just by

00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:09.724
pointing to you,
on page 297,

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:15.716
a somewhat more complex example
of what this looks like toward

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:18.270
the end of the novel.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.180
This is at the bottom of that
page.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.592
They're driving out of Mexico,
Sal and Dean,

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:43.900
and they meet indigenous people
along the road.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.012
As we climbed the air
grew cooler and the Indian girls

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:50.020
on the road wore shawls over
their heads and shoulders.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.240
They hailed us desperately.
We stopped to see.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.669
They wanted to sell us little
pieces of rock crystal.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.720
Their great brown,
innocent eyes looked into ours

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.723
with such soulful intensity that
not one of us had the slightest

00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:07.315
sexual thought about them.
Moreover, they were very young,

00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:09.870
some of them eleven and looking
almost thirty.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.879
"Look at those eyes," breathed
Dean.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.342
They were like the eyes of the
Virgin Mother when she was a

00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:17.988
child.
We saw in them the tender and

00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:22.699
forgiving gaze of Jesus and they
stared unflinching into ours.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.959
We rubbed our nervous blue eyes
and looked again.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:30.350
Still they penetrated us with
sorrowful and hypnotic gleam.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.949
When they talked they suddenly
became frantic and almost silly.

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.750
In their silence they were
themselves.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.307
"They"ve only recently learned
to sell these crystals since the

00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:45.660
highway was built about ten
years back.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.292
Up until that time this entire
nation must have been silent."

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.493
That's Dean.
In this fantasy about the

00:04:56.493 --> 00:05:01.646
indigenous girls,
what you see is a commitment to

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:05.939
language and the activity of
selling,

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.998
buying and selling,
entirely entwined with one

00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:13.011
another.
So, the fantasy here is that

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:17.536
it's selling and buying that
produces in them a language that

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:21.307
looks very much like the
language that's frequently

00:05:21.307 --> 00:05:24.550
attributed to Dean:
frantic and silly,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.798
almost silly.
Remember, as the novel goes on

00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:33.449
and Dean gets more and more
hyper, sort of "wigged out,"

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.875
his language becomes more and
more frantic,

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.730
and more and more actually
silly.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.620
So this is here attributed to
them.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.410
There are other fantasies at
work here, obviously.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.717
One is that they are reading a
kind of Christian essentialism

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:54.990
into these people,
into their eyes.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.019
They see the Virgin Mary,
and they see Jesus.

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:03.294
There is a whole mystical
objectification of these people

00:06:03.294 --> 00:06:06.805
that's going on,
that's allied to the religious

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:10.876
strains of this novel,
which I'm going to pick up

00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:14.810
again a little bit later on in
my lecture today.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.212
So, this is a more complex
and, sort of,

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:21.139
dense example of how that
consumer,

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.090
that push to consume,
that consumer sense drives and

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.660
motivates the novel and plays
out in what they see when they

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.210
are on the road.

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:39.903
In that passage that I read to
you when they're in the

00:06:39.903 --> 00:06:44.554
mountains in Colorado drunk,
yelling, they call themselves

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:48.989
"mad, drunken Americans."
Well, what does America mean in

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:51.617
this novel?
And what does it mean to be an

00:06:51.617 --> 00:06:56.103
American in this novel?
So, that's the question I'd

00:06:56.103 --> 00:07:00.906
like to take up today first.
Coming from Lolita,

00:07:00.906 --> 00:07:05.010
the vision of America in
On the Road looks quite

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.997
different.
In Lolita the vision of

00:07:08.997 --> 00:07:12.440
America is minute;
it's detailed;

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.218
it's concrete.
Remember, for example,

00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:25.003
the Komfee Kabins that Nabokov
gives us as Lolita and Humbert

00:07:25.003 --> 00:07:31.275
tour around: the painful,
luminous, tiny detail of all

00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:35.240
that they see on the road.
Think to yourself.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.770
Do you see any of that kind of
detail in this book?

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.330
I see shaking heads.
No.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.750
We really don't.
What do we see instead?

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.464
What America do we see?
I'm going to look back to a

00:07:47.464 --> 00:07:52.017
passage I talked about in a
different vein last time,

00:07:52.017 --> 00:07:55.870
on 26 and 27,
just for one quick example.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.027
This is, remember,
when he's hitched a ride in

00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:03.238
this truck, and it's a truck bed
full of men who have hitched

00:08:03.238 --> 00:08:06.045
rides.
And he's talking with

00:08:06.045 --> 00:08:09.589
Mississippi Gene.
This is at the bottom of 26: 

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:13.660
There is something so
indubitably reminiscent of Big

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.730
Slim Hazard in Mississippi
Gene's demeanor that I said,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.182
"Do you happen to have met a
fellow called Big Slim Hazard

00:08:21.182 --> 00:08:22.685
somewhere?"
And he said,

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:25.550
"You mean that tall fellow with
the big laugh?"

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.770
"Well, that sounds like him.
He came from Ruston, Louisiana."

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.127
"That's right.
Louisiana Slim he's sometimes

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:32.310
called.
Yes, Sir.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.546
I sure have met Big Slim.
And he used to work in the east

00:08:36.546 --> 00:08:39.154
Texas oil fields?"
"East Texas is right and now

00:08:39.154 --> 00:08:42.049
he's punching cows," and that
was exactly right,

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:46.354
and still I couldn't believe
Gene could really have known

00:08:46.354 --> 00:08:50.120
Slim whom I have been looking
for more or less for

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.143
years.
In this scene Big Slim Hazard

00:08:54.143 --> 00:08:58.670
is an American type,
just as Mississippi Gene is

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.114
himself.
Their names tell you that

00:09:03.114 --> 00:09:09.070
they're almost cartoonishly
American types.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:14.405
The fact that Mississippi Gene
knows this vague person,

00:09:14.405 --> 00:09:18.556
Big Slim Hazard,
gives you the feeling that

00:09:18.556 --> 00:09:24.879
America is a tiny community in
which these types loom large,

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:29.938
that anyone from anywhere--if
he's the right kind of

00:09:29.938 --> 00:09:35.790
American--will know the other
members of that American tribe

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.573
of types.
So, Mississippi Gene knows the

00:09:39.573 --> 00:09:43.894
America that Sal knows,
and it's America populated by

00:09:43.894 --> 00:09:49.381
these larger-than-life figures.
The very vagueness of the

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:55.769
description: "You mean the tall
fellow with the big laugh?"

00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:59.289
How many people can we imagine
who might fit that description?

00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:01.590
It's like telling your
horoscope;

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.570
if you're general enough,
you're going to make a match.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:11.149
So, Sal is convinced--he wants
to be convinced;

00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:16.115
he desperately wants to be
convinced--that Mississippi Gene

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:22.201
knows Big Slim Hazard.
Let's look at another example

00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:23.870
on page 59.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.669
This is something else Sal
wants.

00:10:32.669 --> 00:10:37.011
I wanted to see Denver
ten years ago when they were all

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:41.279
children--[That's Chad and Dean
and the other Denver natives

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:43.739
they have among them in their
gang]

00:10:43.739 --> 00:10:48.008
and in the sunny cherry blossom
morning of springtime in the

00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:51.987
Rockies rolling their hoops up
the joyous alleys full of

00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:54.606
promise,
the whole gang,

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:59.171
and Dean ragged and dirty,
prowling by himself in his

00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:03.961
preoccupied frenzy.
There is a nostalgia here,

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:07.009
not for the past of the old
West.

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:08.490
It's important that Denver is
in the West.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.034
The nostalgia here is not for
the old West,

00:11:13.034 --> 00:11:18.248
but for the young West.
The West in On the Road

00:11:18.248 --> 00:11:22.039
is an area of youth.
It's always,

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:27.327
in American lore,
been an area of adventure and

00:11:27.327 --> 00:11:33.535
imagination, but this is well
after the end of Manifest

00:11:33.535 --> 00:11:37.049
Destiny.
There is no border in the West.

00:11:37.049 --> 00:11:42.619
So Sal has to reinvent one,
and in some sense it's a border

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:46.851
of time.
It's a spring of youth that's

00:11:46.851 --> 00:11:50.123
inaccessible,
somehow, to Sal,

00:11:50.123 --> 00:11:56.779
that these men he's with who
are so exciting to him as their

00:11:56.779 --> 00:12:01.179
own kind of western American
type,

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:05.343
that they blossomed and grew in
this particular place,

00:12:05.343 --> 00:12:08.799
and he wants to have been there
with them.

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:12.353
So, in a way,
by longing to be where they

00:12:12.353 --> 00:12:17.239
were when they were children,
by longing to inhabit that

00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:21.059
time, as well,
he wants to become them.

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:24.879
So, this is just one of the
ways that Sal longs to

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:28.061
assimilate them to himself.
The other big way,

00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:30.981
of course, is through Dean's
language, but this is another

00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:34.097
way.
It's a vision of the West as a

00:12:34.097 --> 00:12:37.130
place of, generally,
male youth.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:50.237
When he's back in New
York--this is on page 125--his

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:59.245
New York friends meet his road
friends, and are delighted by

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:03.049
them.
This is one of his friends:

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:08.539
"'Sal, where did you find these
absolutely wonderful people?

00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:11.169
I've never seen anyone like
them.'

00:13:11.169 --> 00:13:13.680
'I found them in the
West.'"So,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.333
there is that sense of the West
as a source, and what he's going

00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:23.746
to do is take them back East.
So, the West is a fountain of

00:13:23.746 --> 00:13:29.184
youthful energy that Sal
continually draws back to the

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:33.515
East, to New York.
Sal is never really going to be

00:13:33.515 --> 00:13:37.899
gone from New York that long.
He never really wants to leave,

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:42.165
and one sign of it is that
icebox, but the other sign of it

00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:47.019
is that he continually returns
and takes these people with him.

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:53.054
And part of the pleasure for
him is to do that transaction,

00:13:53.054 --> 00:13:57.840
to enliven the old East with
the young West.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.205
These are all stereotypes of
America, but Sal really believes

00:14:04.205 --> 00:14:09.310
them and really inhabits them.
Now look on 172.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:24.700
This is Sal in one of his major
moments of vision.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:31.160
He's in New Orleans,
and he's on Market Street.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.620
Oh, sorry.
He's in San Francisco,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:41.389
and he's on Market Street.
This is the middle of 172.

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:43.879
I looked down Market
Street.

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:46.807
I didn't know whether it was
that or Canal Street in New

00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:48.524
Orleans.
It led to water,

00:14:48.524 --> 00:14:52.672
ambiguous, universal water,
just as 42^(nd) Street in New

00:14:52.672 --> 00:14:56.820
York leads to water and you
never know where you are.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.320
I thought of Ed Dunkel's ghost
on Times Square.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.686
I was delirious.
I wanted to go back and leer at

00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:05.840
my strange Dickensian mother in
the hash joint.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.889
I tingled all over from head to
foot.

00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:13.971
It seemed I had a whole host of
memories going back to 1750 in

00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:18.803
England and that I was in San
Francisco now only in another

00:15:18.803 --> 00:15:22.999
life and in another body.
"No," that woman seemed to say

00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:26.341
with that terrified glance.
"Don't come back and play your

00:15:26.341 --> 00:15:29.834
honest, hardworking mother.
You are no longer like a son to

00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:32.380
me and like your father,
my first husband,

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.049
'ere this kindly Greek took
pity on me."

00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:37.679
The proprietor was a Greek with
hairy arms.

00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:40.154
"You are no good,
inclined to drunkenness and

00:15:40.154 --> 00:15:43.192
routs and final disgraceful
robbery of the fruits of my

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.330
'umble labors in the
haberdashery.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.136
Oh, Son.
Did you not ever go on your

00:15:48.136 --> 00:15:51.056
knees and pray for deliverance
from all your sins and

00:15:51.056 --> 00:15:53.910
scoundrel's acts?
Lost boy, depart.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.810
Do not haunt my soul.
I have done well forgetting you.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.473
Reopen no old wounds.
Be as if you had never returned

00:16:01.473 --> 00:16:04.769
and looked in to me to see my
laboring humilities,

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:07.785
my few scrubbed pennies,
hungry to grab,

00:16:07.785 --> 00:16:10.570
quick to deprive,
sullen, unloved,

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.260
mean-minded son of my flesh.
Son!

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.505
Son!"
It made me want to think of the

00:16:17.505 --> 00:16:20.820
big Pop Vision in Graetna with
Old Bull.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.410
And for just a moment I had
reached the point of ecstasy

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.310
that I always wanted to reach,
which was the complete step

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.399
across chronological time into
timeless shadows and wonderment

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:36.556
in the bleakness of the mortal
realm and the sensation of death

00:16:36.556 --> 00:16:40.579
kicking at my heels to move on
with a phantom dogging its own

00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:44.669
heels and myself hurrying to a
plank where all the angels dove

00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:48.960
off and flew into the holy void
of uncreated emptiness,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.720
the potent and inconceivable
radiancies shining in bright

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.607
mind essence,
innumerable lotuslands falling

00:16:55.607 --> 00:16:58.830
open in the magic mothswarm of
heaven.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.440
That language at the end there
is pure Allen Ginsberg.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.390
So, that's that incantatory
Beat mysticism.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.575
It's a mysticism of emptiness,
in the end, but what fills that

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:18.335
emptiness as we lead up to that
moment is this fantasy of

00:17:18.335 --> 00:17:24.382
trans-historical existence,
that he can somehow embody a

00:17:24.382 --> 00:17:30.569
whole human story across time.
Where's that story coming from?

00:17:30.569 --> 00:17:34.490
Well, this is a Dickensian
mother.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:40.557
It's Dickens in part,
that stereotype of old London,

00:17:40.557 --> 00:17:47.220
of the urban working class,
but it's not just Dickens.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.032
Moby Dick is here too.
If you look at that litany of

00:17:51.032 --> 00:17:54.865
streets that lead down to the
water, any of you who have read

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:58.251
Moby Dick will recall
that Ishmael talks at the

00:17:58.251 --> 00:18:01.372
beginning,
before he gets on the Pequod,

00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:05.325
he talks about how streets that
lead to water draw you

00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:07.778
inevitably,
and he talks about all the

00:18:07.778 --> 00:18:09.890
streets in New York that end in
water.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.860
And he has this long meditation
on that aspect of city

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.871
geography.
Well, here is Sal having that

00:18:16.871 --> 00:18:20.560
meditation, too.
So, what you see in this

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.286
passage is not only a sort of
mystical trans-historical

00:18:25.286 --> 00:18:31.443
fantasy, but a literary one.
He's getting his mythology not

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:37.756
just from the cupboard of
stereotypes that are proper to

00:18:37.756 --> 00:18:43.342
American self-conception.
He's looking back to literary

00:18:43.342 --> 00:18:46.943
stories, too,
that he can assimilate into his

00:18:46.943 --> 00:18:51.445
experience and read through,
experience through,

00:18:51.445 --> 00:18:57.757
so that every little thing he
experiences, like this moment of

00:18:57.757 --> 00:19:01.570
abandonment.
Dean has gone off with Camille;

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.690
Marylou is off somewhere else;
he's starved;

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:09.574
he doesn't have any place to go.
But it becomes a moment of

00:19:09.574 --> 00:19:13.923
vision, and it can be a moment
of vision because he has these

00:19:13.923 --> 00:19:17.692
ways of layering over that
experience with mythic and

00:19:17.692 --> 00:19:19.650
literary significance.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.959
Finally, on 147,
we have another example of

00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:32.484
this, and it shows us something
even a little different,

00:19:32.484 --> 00:19:39.059
or it pushes the point further.
This is in New Orleans: 

00:19:39.059 --> 00:19:42.889
There was a mythic wraith
of fog--[this is the middle of

00:19:42.889 --> 00:19:45.713
that big paragraph]
over the brown waters that

00:19:45.713 --> 00:19:49.040
night together with dark
driftwoods and across the way

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.806
New Orleans glowed orange bright
with a few dark ships at her

00:19:52.806 --> 00:19:56.093
hem,
ghostly, fog-bound Cereno ships

00:19:56.093 --> 00:19:59.769
with Spanish balconies and
ornamental poops,

00:19:59.769 --> 00:20:03.480
'til you got up close and saw
they were just old freighters

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.731
from Sweden and Panama.
The ferry fires glowed in the

00:20:06.731 --> 00:20:09.095
night.
The same Negroes plied the

00:20:09.095 --> 00:20:12.219
shovel and sang.
Old Big Slim Hazard had once

00:20:12.219 --> 00:20:15.109
worked on the Algiers ferry as a
deck hand.

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:17.838
This made me think of
Mississippi Gene too and as the

00:20:17.838 --> 00:20:20.829
river poured down from mid
America by starlight I knew,

00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:24.206
I knew like mad,
that everything I had ever

00:20:24.206 --> 00:20:27.099
known and would ever know was
One.

00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:30.036
Strange to say,
too, that night we crossed the

00:20:30.036 --> 00:20:33.690
ferry with Bull Lee a girl
committed suicide off the deck

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.299
either just before or just after
us.

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:40.549
We saw it in the paper the next
day.

00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:44.945
Here you get a dream,
not just of trans-historical

00:20:44.945 --> 00:20:50.507
time, the old Spanish ships that
turn out just to be freighters

00:20:50.507 --> 00:20:54.893
from Sweden and Panama;
you get another nod to

00:20:54.893 --> 00:20:59.622
Melville, Cereno ships
(Benito Cereno is one of

00:20:59.622 --> 00:21:07.476
Melville's famous novels).
"That everything I would ever

00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:12.176
know was One."
The oneness that he is looking

00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:16.064
for is partly that oneness of
mystical emptiness that we saw

00:21:16.064 --> 00:21:20.216
in the last passage.
But here we get the sense of

00:21:20.216 --> 00:21:25.773
the racial oneness that comes
out in some of the other parts

00:21:25.773 --> 00:21:29.728
of the novel:
the Negroes plying the shovel

00:21:29.728 --> 00:21:33.099
and singing,
another American type.

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:38.640
But this is a type with which
Sal longs to merge.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:48.072
And this is how--on 179 and
180--this is how he images a way

00:21:48.072 --> 00:21:50.790
out of himself.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.279
So this is on 179.
So, I'm moving from the

00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:08.660
question of "What does America
look like;

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.089
what's the mythic vocabulary
that Sal is using?"

00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:17.410
to, "How does he find his
identity as an American?"

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.541
So, first he makes America
mythic, rather than specific (if

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:27.950
we compare him back to Nabokov),
and then he enters into that

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.549
mythology through acts of
identification.

00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:36.190
And here is one of the most
important.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.987
At dusk I walked.
I felt like a speck on the

00:22:39.987 --> 00:22:41.750
surface of the sad,
red earth.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.027
I passed the Windsor Hotel
where Dean Moriarty had lived

00:22:45.027 --> 00:22:47.470
with his father in the
Depression '30s.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.314
As of yore, I looked everywhere
for the sad and fabled tinsmith

00:22:51.314 --> 00:22:53.872
of my mind.
Either you find someone who

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:57.898
looks like your father in places
like Montana or you look for a

00:22:57.898 --> 00:23:00.430
friend's father where he is no
more.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.986
At lilac evening I walked with
every muscle aching along the

00:23:03.986 --> 00:23:07.422
lights of 27^(th) and Welton in
the Denver colored section

00:23:07.422 --> 00:23:11.045
wishing I were a Negro,
feeling that the best the white

00:23:11.045 --> 00:23:14.200
world had offered was not enough
ecstasy for me,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.503
not enough life,
joy, kicks, darkness,

00:23:17.503 --> 00:23:20.360
music, not enough night.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.719
He goes on in this vein for
that whole paragraph if you just

00:23:30.719 --> 00:23:33.034
skim down.
I was only myself,

00:23:33.034 --> 00:23:35.283
Sal Paradise,
sad, strolling in this violet

00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:38.334
dark, this unbearably sweet
night wishing I could exchange

00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:40.519
worlds with the happy,
true-hearted,

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:42.509
ecstatic Negroes of
America.

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:48.027
Well, this is hugely
stereotypical,

00:23:48.027 --> 00:23:54.393
hugely appropriative.
Sal wants to take the entire

00:23:54.393 --> 00:24:00.319
life experience of a group of
people and suck it into himself.

00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:06.749
Now, you want to ask yourself:
What is the sadness that

00:24:06.749 --> 00:24:13.545
motivates this appropriation;
why does he want to become the

00:24:13.545 --> 00:24:16.996
Negro?
He says in another moment,

00:24:16.996 --> 00:24:21.931
"I was Mexican."
He's always trying to be more

00:24:21.931 --> 00:24:27.039
exotic than himself,
than simple Sal Paradise.

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:30.910
Well, Baldwin had something to
say about this.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.281
James Baldwin characterized
this passage as "absolute

00:24:35.281 --> 00:24:38.980
nonsense, and offensive
nonsense, at that.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.928
And yet, there is real pain in
it, and real loss,

00:24:41.928 --> 00:24:45.842
however thin.
And it is thin,

00:24:45.842 --> 00:24:54.619
thin because it It does not
refer to reality,

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:59.214
but to a dream."
That's what it is:

00:24:59.214 --> 00:25:01.359
"It does not refer to reality,
but to a dream."

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:04.341
And he says of his own writing,
"I had tried to convey

00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:06.816
something of what it felt like
to be a Negro,

00:25:06.816 --> 00:25:09.010
and no one had been able to
listen.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:14.032
They wanted their romance."
Well, I think that's a

00:25:14.032 --> 00:25:17.823
pretty clear-eyed view,
and a clear indictment,

00:25:17.823 --> 00:25:22.519
of what Kerouac is doing
through the character of Sal.

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:26.855
Sal in this moment becomes so
naïve, naïve of

00:25:26.855 --> 00:25:31.190
history, of actual lived history
of his own country.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.785
But, as you've seen,
the mythic quality of America

00:25:34.785 --> 00:25:38.646
has pushed all of that aside.
So, it's not just the Komfee

00:25:38.646 --> 00:25:42.208
Kabins that we don't see;
it's the whole history of

00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:45.952
slavery.
And when he goes picking in the

00:25:45.952 --> 00:25:50.201
cotton fields,
he imagines that he could be a

00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:53.092
slave.
And then he makes some comments

00:25:53.092 --> 00:25:56.157
about how, well,
he could never pick cotton fast

00:25:56.157 --> 00:26:00.343
enough;
he's just not able to do it as

00:26:00.343 --> 00:26:04.777
black men are.
So, it's motivated by a huge

00:26:04.777 --> 00:26:10.209
blindness about the racial
history of the United States in

00:26:10.209 --> 00:26:14.923
any of its detail.
That sense of the oneness,

00:26:14.923 --> 00:26:20.454
I think, points to why and how
he makes that illusion,

00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:25.440
the oneness.
He felt that it was all one.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:31.686
The oneness is elevated from
this sense of appropriation,

00:26:31.686 --> 00:26:36.998
to a mystical level.
So that oneness looks something

00:26:36.998 --> 00:26:41.700
like the Buddhism that Kerouac
studied for a time;

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:47.592
it looks like something more
than the effort for Sal just to

00:26:47.592 --> 00:26:50.932
be something exotic.
It looks like,

00:26:50.932 --> 00:26:55.910
by entering into that oneness,
by adopting all these different

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.909
identities, that Sal
participates into some larger

00:26:59.909 --> 00:27:04.885
mystical body.
But, what is that larger

00:27:04.885 --> 00:27:08.001
mystical body?
We have been given one

00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:11.319
candidate: that it's America,
that it's somehow America.

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:13.887
And I want you to keep this in
mind and make a note to

00:27:13.887 --> 00:27:16.339
yourself.
Think about this vision of an

00:27:16.339 --> 00:27:20.376
American mystical oneness when
you go to read Crying of Lot

00:27:20.376 --> 00:27:24.082
49 'cause you're going to
see something quite similar

00:27:24.082 --> 00:27:26.617
there.
There's actually a wonderful

00:27:26.617 --> 00:27:30.298
episode in On the Road
that is nearly a carbon copy

00:27:30.298 --> 00:27:33.849
of what you'll see later in
Crying of Lot 49,

00:27:33.849 --> 00:27:37.429
 where Dean looks down
on Salt Lake City at night,

00:27:37.429 --> 00:27:41.200
and he looks at the pattern of
the lights down below him.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.540
Oedipa Maas in Crying of Lot
49 will sit up on a bluff

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.080
overlooking San Narciso,
and she'll look down at the

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.401
pattern of light.
And it's an important moment in

00:27:55.401 --> 00:27:59.039
that novel, a moment of
religious revelation,

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:02.792
but what's being revealed
remains in Pynchon quite

00:28:02.792 --> 00:28:06.930
difficult to pin down.
Here, it's equally vague.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.787
So, on 5, back to that question.
What can motivate this kind of

00:28:16.787 --> 00:28:20.160
effort?
On page 181 he says: 

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.870
There was excitement and
the air was filled with the

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.167
vibration of really joyous life
that knows nothing of

00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:33.299
disappointment and white sorrows
and all that.

00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:36.654
The old Negro man had a can of
beer in his coat pocket which he

00:28:36.654 --> 00:28:39.955
proceeded to open and the old
white man enviously eyed the can

00:28:39.955 --> 00:28:43.310
and groped in his pocket to see
if he could buy a can too.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.150
How I died.
I walked away from there.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.849
[And then this wonderful
transition]

00:28:49.849 --> 00:28:52.549
I went to see a rich girl I
knew.

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:55.115
In the morning she pulled a
hundred-dollar bill out of her

00:28:55.115 --> 00:28:57.500
silk stocking and said,
"You've been talking of a trip

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.205
to Frisco.
That being the case,

00:28:59.205 --> 00:29:00.980
take this and go have your
fun."

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.440
So all of my problems were
solved.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:12.943
Sal needs the rich girl to keep
his vision fueled,

00:29:12.943 --> 00:29:21.059
but the white sorrows are part
of what it pays for.

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:26.075
The rich girl provides him
with---in a way--with these

00:29:26.075 --> 00:29:28.730
white sorrows;
she funds them.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:33.359
You can have white sorrows,
whatever those really are.

00:29:33.359 --> 00:29:37.682
You can have white sorrows if
you have the hundred-dollar bill

00:29:37.682 --> 00:29:40.730
to send you off on one of these
odysseys.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.660
You're not pinned down to a
place working for a living.

00:29:47.569 --> 00:29:51.223
I'm not going to talk about
jazz, and the way it figures,

00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:55.072
but I hope that you will have a
chance to talk about that in

00:29:55.072 --> 00:29:58.661
section because that brings
together several elements of

00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:04.502
what's important in the novel.
I want to focus now on the

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:07.296
sadness.
I don't know if you noticed how

00:30:07.296 --> 00:30:09.720
often that adjective appears in
the novel.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.894
Did any of you notice that?
"Sadness…

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:17.134
sadness…sad night."
One of the saddest things,

00:30:17.134 --> 00:30:20.982
after Dean and Sal get into
their only fight,

00:30:20.982 --> 00:30:24.743
really, is the uneaten food on
Dean's plate,

00:30:24.743 --> 00:30:27.980
the sadness of the uneaten
food.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.733
What's sad in this novel,
I think, is the way the

00:30:32.733 --> 00:30:38.081
specificity of persons pushed
back against that general

00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:43.430
collapse into mystical communing
with one another.

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:48.900
What's sad: Dean's wife,
Camille, and their baby.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.325
It's sad.
He abandons them,

00:30:52.325 --> 00:30:58.196
and she is left with them.
All the women in Dean's life

00:30:58.196 --> 00:31:02.980
call him to the carpet and tell
him of all his sins.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:08.689
That's a sad moment in the
novel, a moment of difficulty,

00:31:08.689 --> 00:31:13.299
a moment of specificity also.
What else is sad?

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:19.320
It's sad when Dean leaves Sal
feverish in Mexico.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.668
He's off.
He has his girls to chase,

00:31:22.668 --> 00:31:27.157
his wife to go back to,
to divorce, whichever one is

00:31:27.157 --> 00:31:30.473
which.
He has all of these

00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:36.921
machinations to attend to.
The friendship between the two,

00:31:36.921 --> 00:31:40.799
in the end, doesn't seem to
mean very much,

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:46.799
or, at least in that moment it
doesn't seem to mean very much.

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:51.670
If George Dardess is right
that this is a love story,

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:55.410
it's the love story between Sal
and Dean.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:59.620
And I hope, as you are reading,
you notice that chapter opening

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.626
where once again Dean appears at
the door when Sal shows up,

00:32:03.626 --> 00:32:07.829
and he's totally naked.
I hope you noticed that.

00:32:07.829 --> 00:32:11.933
It's the third time that we see
that so there is an eroticism

00:32:11.933 --> 00:32:15.729
between them.
And there is this heartbreaking

00:32:15.729 --> 00:32:21.089
love that Sal has for Dean,
and, if you track that through,

00:32:21.089 --> 00:32:27.024
the major turning points in the
second two thirds of the novel

00:32:27.024 --> 00:32:32.764
are moments when Sal makes it
clear to Dean that he actually

00:32:32.764 --> 00:32:37.026
cares about him.
And I can point you to some of

00:32:37.026 --> 00:32:39.589
these pages.
This is on 189.

00:32:39.589 --> 00:32:43.040
I'm not going to do them all,
'cause there is something else

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.620
I want to show you today.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:55.433
This is after Dean has been,
sort of, called to the carpet,

00:32:55.433 --> 00:32:58.882
and he says:
The -[This is on 188]

00:32:58.882 --> 00:33:02.329
the thumb became the symbol of
Dean's final development.

00:33:02.329 --> 00:33:06.268
He no longer cared about
anything as before but now he

00:33:06.268 --> 00:33:09.910
also cared about everything in
principle.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:13.050
That's such a great
encapsulation of not caring

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.532
about any specific thing,
but still being incredibly

00:33:16.532 --> 00:33:19.975
invested.
But this is mirrored by Sal's

00:33:19.975 --> 00:33:25.087
very specific investment in
Dean, and this is on the bottom

00:33:25.087 --> 00:33:27.819
of the facing page,
on 189:

00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:30.370
Resolutely and firmly I
repeated what I said.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.640
"Come to New York with me.
I've got the money."

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.955
I looked at him.
My eyes were watering with

00:33:35.955 --> 00:33:40.069
embarrassment and tears.
Still he stared at me.

00:33:40.069 --> 00:33:43.400
Now his eyes were blank and
looking through me.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.858
It was probably the pivotal
point of our friendship when he

00:33:47.858 --> 00:33:52.316
realized I had actually spent
some hours thinking about him

00:33:52.316 --> 00:33:56.466
and his troubles and he was
trying to place that in his

00:33:56.466 --> 00:33:59.618
tremendously involved and
tormented mental

00:33:59.618 --> 00:34:03.762
categories.
So, he finally realizes that

00:34:03.762 --> 00:34:08.604
Sal actually has a specific love
for him, not caring about him

00:34:08.604 --> 00:34:14.136
somehow in principle,
which is the way of course that

00:34:14.136 --> 00:34:18.418
Dean cares.
So, this is the sadness of the

00:34:18.418 --> 00:34:22.369
novel.
It's this unrequited love;

00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:28.982
Dean is never capable of loving
Sal in the same way that Sal

00:34:28.982 --> 00:34:33.061
loves Dean.
And, at the very end,

00:34:33.061 --> 00:34:40.552
when Sal has to leave Dean on
the street, I actually love how

00:34:40.552 --> 00:34:46.369
this works.
He's in the back of a Cadillac.

00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:53.821
His friend, Remi,
is taking him in a limousine to

00:34:53.821 --> 00:34:59.719
a concert, a Duke Ellington
concert.

00:34:59.719 --> 00:35:03.960
Remi won't have Dean in the
car, so the car drives on.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:10.918
Sal is with a new girlfriend,
Laura, about--to whom he's told

00:35:10.918 --> 00:35:13.527
all about Dean.
"Dean,

00:35:13.527 --> 00:35:16.605
ragged in a moth-eaten overcoat
he bought specially for the

00:35:16.605 --> 00:35:18.570
freezing temperatures of the
East,

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:21.735
walked off alone and the last I
saw of him he rounded the corner

00:35:21.735 --> 00:35:24.298
of Seventh Avenue,
eyes on the street ahead and

00:35:24.298 --> 00:35:26.554
bent to it again.
Poor little Laura,

00:35:26.554 --> 00:35:29.967
my baby, to whom I had told
everything about Dean,

00:35:29.967 --> 00:35:33.077
began almost to cry.
"Oh, we shouldn't let him go

00:35:33.077 --> 00:35:35.710
like this.
What'll we do?"

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.851
Old Dean's gone I thought and
out loud I said,

00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:42.900
"He'll be all right," and off
he went to the sa--and off we

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.879
went to the sad and disinclined
concert for which I had no

00:35:46.879 --> 00:35:50.997
stomach whatever and all the
time I was thinking of Dean and

00:35:50.997 --> 00:35:55.395
how he got back on the train and
rode over 3,000 miles over that

00:35:55.395 --> 00:35:59.654
awful land and never knew why he
had come anyway except to see

00:35:59.654 --> 00:36:04.002
me.
In that moment Sal supplies the

00:36:04.002 --> 00:36:08.837
answer for why Dean came,
"never knew why he had come

00:36:08.837 --> 00:36:12.315
anyway,"
and then Sal supplies "except

00:36:12.315 --> 00:36:17.820
to see me," and his own pain and
tears are routed through Laura.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:24.307
It's Laura who cries at Dean's
abandonment, while he maintains

00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:28.561
this composure,
this masculine composure:

00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:34.287
"he'll be all right."
But, the sadness here is surely

00:36:34.287 --> 00:36:34.980
Sal's.

00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:42.678
By the end,
the language of

00:36:42.678 --> 00:36:48.491
experience--this is on 304--the
language of experience that Dean

00:36:48.491 --> 00:36:52.090
represents is completely
exhausted.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:56.950
This is how Dean talks at the
very end:

00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:00.469
He couldn't talk anymore.
He hopped and laughed.

00:37:00.469 --> 00:37:03.021
He stuttered and fluttered his
hands and said,

00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:05.119
"Ah, ah, you must listen to,
hear."

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:09.360
We listened all ears,
but he forgot what he wanted to

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.630
say.
"Really, listen.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.880
Ahem.
Look.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.443
Dear Sal, sweet Laura.
I've come, I've gone,

00:37:14.443 --> 00:37:17.584
but wait, ah,
yes," and he stared with rocky

00:37:17.584 --> 00:37:20.389
sorrow into his hands.
"Can't talk no more.

00:37:20.389 --> 00:37:24.036
You understand that it is,
or might be,

00:37:24.036 --> 00:37:26.929
but listen."
We all listened.

00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:29.240
He was listening to sounds in
the night.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.289
"Yes," he whispered with awe.
"But you see,

00:37:32.289 --> 00:37:36.960
no need to talk anymore and
further."

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.514
Dean's language has gone from
this sort of quasi-academic

00:37:40.514 --> 00:37:43.179
gibberish of the beginning of
the novel,

00:37:43.179 --> 00:37:47.934
to this completely fragmented,
broken version of the "yes"s

00:37:47.934 --> 00:37:51.050
and "ah"s and "wow"s of those
early,

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:55.453
ecstatic days.
So, Sal's language,

00:37:55.453 --> 00:38:01.004
by the end, has absorbed some
of this, and yet gone on to

00:38:01.004 --> 00:38:07.150
honor a kind of coherence that
Dean cannot inhabit anymore,

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:11.280
or maybe that Dean never
inhabited.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:16.318
So, the last sentence of
the book, which I want to read

00:38:16.318 --> 00:38:20.834
to you--I think I have
time--just because this is the

00:38:20.834 --> 00:38:24.570
language that Sal comes out of
it with,

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:30.241
or that Kerouac comes out with
as, the payoff for opening

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:35.710
language, in the ways that
Dean's language of immediacy

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:40.083
represents.
So this is one sentence,

00:38:40.083 --> 00:38:45.435
page 307, the last paragraph.
So in America when the

00:38:45.435 --> 00:38:49.070
sun goes down and I sit on the
old, broken-down river pier

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.523
watching the long,
long skies over New Jersey and

00:38:52.523 --> 00:38:56.469
sense all that raw land that
rolls in one unbelievable,

00:38:56.469 --> 00:39:00.462
huge bulge over the West Coast
and all that road going,

00:39:00.462 --> 00:39:04.159
all the people dreaming and the
immensity of it,

00:39:04.159 --> 00:39:08.443
and in Iowa I know by now the
children must be crying in the

00:39:08.443 --> 00:39:12.944
land where they let the children
cry and tonight the stars will

00:39:12.944 --> 00:39:16.719
be out and don't you know that
God is Pooh Bear?

00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:19.868
The evening star must be
drooping and shedding her

00:39:19.868 --> 00:39:23.650
sparkler dims on the prairie,
which is just before the coming

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.230
of complete night that blesses
the earth, darkens all rivers,

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:30.563
cups the peaks,
and folds the final shore in

00:39:30.563 --> 00:39:35.059
and nobody, nobody knows what is
going to happen to anybody

00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:38.470
besides the forlorn rags of
growing old,

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.538
I think of Dean Moriarty.
I even think of old Dean

00:39:43.538 --> 00:39:46.280
Moriarty, the father we never
found.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.090
I think of Dean Moriarty.

00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:56.492
So, he's blasted open the
syntax of that sentence,

00:39:56.492 --> 00:40:00.449
piled clause upon clause upon
clause,

00:40:00.449 --> 00:40:06.224
phrase on phrase,
to include that whole road in

00:40:06.224 --> 00:40:11.141
the one sentence.
So, if the dream of Kerouac's

00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:16.465
language is to pour experience
into language and make language

00:40:16.465 --> 00:40:20.575
immediate,
this sentence is a very fine

00:40:20.575 --> 00:40:23.020
example of the payoff.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:31.086
There is a kind of goofiness at
the center of it,

00:40:31.086 --> 00:40:34.470
"God is Pooh Bear."
What does that mean?

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:40.369
God is just a toy?
God is a children's story?

00:40:40.369 --> 00:40:45.255
But then there is that lyrical,
elegiac, always sad sense of

00:40:45.255 --> 00:40:50.306
longing, and the excess of the
end: "Dean Moriarty…Dean

00:40:50.306 --> 00:40:53.950
Moriarty's father…Dean
Moriarty."

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:58.466
You can't just say it once.
You have to try to fill that

00:40:58.466 --> 00:41:04.383
void by saying it two times and
by invoking his father a third

00:41:04.383 --> 00:41:08.049
time.
So the excess and the longing

00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:13.429
are there, each trying to drive
or satisfy the other.

00:41:13.429 --> 00:41:17.674
Now, if we have any doubts
that On the Road is

00:41:17.674 --> 00:41:21.313
mythic in itself,
I just want to show you quickly

00:41:21.313 --> 00:41:24.400
two things.
In 2007, On the Road had

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.980
its fiftieth anniversary of
publication.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:32.590
It was written in 1951 and it
was published in 1957 by Viking.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:39.250
So last year we were treated to
these two books.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:44.844
One thing that fascinates me
about them is that they are

00:41:44.844 --> 00:41:50.540
examples of how publishing
houses rely on known names for

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:55.399
making money.
So, Viking has On the Road

00:41:55.399 --> 00:42:01.010
in their backlist,
so they can make new copies.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.280
The pagination of this is
exactly the same.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.703
All they did was bind;
they made a retro cover,

00:42:06.703 --> 00:42:10.116
and they bound the original
book review from the New York

00:42:10.116 --> 00:42:13.189
Times into the front.
They just printed that in,

00:42:13.189 --> 00:42:15.912
and then they just reproduced
the text again,

00:42:15.912 --> 00:42:18.449
so it becomes a sort of
keepsake book.

00:42:18.449 --> 00:42:22.215
I'm not sure that a lot of
people are going to read this

00:42:22.215 --> 00:42:25.980
book, but a lot of people might
buy it as a keepsake.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:29.320
This is the original scroll
version.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.530
This is like the sop to
scholars.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:35.409
This is for the scholarly buyer.
This is for people like me (or

00:42:35.409 --> 00:42:39.002
not like me).
This is the original typescript

00:42:39.002 --> 00:42:42.794
put into pages,
but, as I think I mentioned in

00:42:42.794 --> 00:42:47.375
my first lecture,
Kerouac wrote the manuscript

00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:53.579
for On the Road on one
long, 120-foot roll of paper.

00:42:53.579 --> 00:42:54.870
He just stuck it in the
typewriter.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:59.539
No paragraphs, no nothing;
he just went.

00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:03.562
So, this book reproduces that,
just breaking it as the pages

00:43:03.562 --> 00:43:06.698
demand (instead of actually
giving us a scroll,

00:43:06.698 --> 00:43:10.423
which would be pretty cool).
But what else they do,

00:43:10.423 --> 00:43:13.300
is they lard it with scholarly
articles.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.576
There are--let's see--three
scholarly articles,

00:43:16.576 --> 00:43:20.850
and then there is a note on the
editing of the text and there

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:23.699
are suggestions for further
reading.

00:43:23.699 --> 00:43:26.512
It makes it into a real
literary object,

00:43:26.512 --> 00:43:32.449
sort of like a modernist text.
And what I love here is that,

00:43:32.449 --> 00:43:38.331
apparently, at the very
beginning of the scroll,

00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:43.337
Kerouac made a typo,
and the editor says,

00:43:43.337 --> 00:43:49.400
"I read it.
I let the typo stand."

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.329
Here it is, the editor,
Howard Cunnell:

00:43:51.329 --> 00:43:54.019
"Because it so beautifully
suggests the sound of a car

00:43:54.019 --> 00:43:56.659
misfiring before starting up for
a long journey,

00:43:56.659 --> 00:44:01.702
I have left uncorrected the
manuscript's opening line,

00:44:01.702 --> 00:44:07.409
which is 'I met met Neal not
long before my father died.'"

00:44:07.409 --> 00:44:11.266
There is the fantasy that the
writing approximates the actual

00:44:11.266 --> 00:44:13.708
car trip, "met met."
Oh, "it sounds like a car

00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:15.511
starting.
I'm going to leave that in

00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:18.234
there."
So, the editors just

00:44:18.234 --> 00:44:25.119
buy--completely buy--the text's
own mythology and produce all

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:30.397
this apparatus around it to help
us believe it,

00:44:30.397 --> 00:44:33.099
too.
Now, the last thing I want

00:44:33.099 --> 00:44:35.380
to show you is on a less
skeptical note.

00:44:38.659 --> 00:44:44.990
If you ever doubt that the
legend and the dream of On

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:50.400
the Road is alive and is
powerful in art,

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:57.500
literary art and visual art,
today, all you need to do is

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:03.079
look at a very recent work of
digital art.

00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:06.905
This is Young-Hae Chang Heavy
Industries, which is a

00:45:06.905 --> 00:45:11.480
collaboration of an American man
and a Korean woman who create

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:15.777
online digital artworks.
And this is one of them from

00:45:15.777 --> 00:45:19.700
2002 called Dakota,
and I think you will see

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:24.329
immediately how and why it is
related to On the Road.

00:45:24.329 --> 00:45:27.126
It's also related to Ezra
Pound's Cantos,

00:45:27.126 --> 00:45:30.130
but I'm not going to burden
you with that right now.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.800
What I want you to do is just
think about this.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:36.677
It runs about six minutes,
so I'm going to let that go

00:45:36.677 --> 00:45:38.920
now.
All right.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.657
Okay.
So, if you ever doubted that

00:45:41.657 --> 00:45:45.817
the dream of an immediate
language that is somehow the

00:45:45.817 --> 00:45:49.742
correlate to jazz and
experience, that's your dream

00:45:49.742 --> 00:45:52.000
living on.
Okay.

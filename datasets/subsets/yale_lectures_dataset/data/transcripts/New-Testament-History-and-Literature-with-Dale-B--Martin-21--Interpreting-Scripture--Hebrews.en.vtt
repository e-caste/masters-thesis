00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.335
Prof: We last week
talked about the issue of women

00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:09.109
and early Christianity,
and I obviously didn't address

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:13.199
all the different texts in early
Christianity that are relevant

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.970
for your discussion last week on
women.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.590
We concentrated on the Pastoral
Epistles,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.941
I and II Timothy and Titus,
as representing one kind of

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:25.106
early Christian way of handling
women in their early

00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:26.100
communities.
 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.405
Then we talked about the
Acts of Paul and Thecla

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:32.159
as a very different kind of way
to do that.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.300
We're going to shift gears for
this week.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.798
This week will also have
something of a theme about it,

00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:41.750
and the theme this week is the
interpretation of scripture.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.990
How do you interpret texts?
 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.331
I'm going to change gears from
what could be the basic method

00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:52.370
I've been using in the class all
along,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.130
which is the historical
critical method,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.119
which I've talked about
sometimes and explained what

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.510
that is.
 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.068
We're going to talk about,
is that the only way for

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:00.908
Christians to interpret
scripture?

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:05.448
Today I get into that by
talking about the letter to the

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:08.420
Hebrews as one very good
example,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.310
from the first period of
Christianity,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.349
of the interpretation of
scripture themselves.

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:17.988
This is how Christians
themselves interpreted their

00:01:17.988 --> 00:01:20.390
scripture in the ancient world.
 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.078
This will be a lecture on
Hebrews to kind of talk about

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:25.269
the content of the letter of the
Hebrews,

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:29.543
but the main--it's also used to
shift our gears away from a

00:01:29.543 --> 00:01:33.669
purely historical critical
analysis of scripture and show

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:36.690
how ancient people did it
themselves.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.435
Then next class period,
on Wednesday,

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:43.324
we'll talk about medieval
exegesis, late ancient and

00:01:43.324 --> 00:01:46.373
medieval
exegesis--interpretations of the

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:47.290
Bible.
 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.358
Now I got the feeling last
week, when I was lecturing about

00:01:50.358 --> 00:01:52.370
the Acts of Paul and
Thecla,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.059
that there were quite a few of
you in attendance who perhaps

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:59.811
had not printed out and actually
read the Acts of Paul and

00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:00.750
Thecla.
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.640
I had a few blank faces and
blank eyes when I was bringing

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.010
up things from that text.
 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.545
I know it's going to take work
for you actually to download the

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.740
reading for Wednesday,
because it's not in your Bible.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.318
Download it--I would actually
prefer if you don't carry your

00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:19.141
computer around and can read the
text because I want you to look

00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:22.538
at the text as we're talking
about it on Wednesday,

00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:24.318
just like I want you to look at
Hebrews today.

00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:27.544
Print it out if you need to and
bring it to class because I will

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:30.205
be talking about that,
and your reading for Wednesday

00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:31.688
is not part of the Bible.
 

00:02:31.688 --> 00:02:34.990
It's from a very,
very, very important book,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.137
one chapter,
which you probably should all

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.210
rush right out and buy.
 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.979
It's so brilliant and so
wonderfully written.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.318
I published the book last
summer, it's called,

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:48.331
Pedagogy of the Bible,
and I'll set that in a little

00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:49.318
bit of context.
 

00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:51.408
What that is,
is I actually went around and

00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:54.543
studied ten different seminaries
and divinity schools around the

00:02:54.543 --> 00:02:56.562
country,
all Protestant seminaries,

00:02:56.562 --> 00:02:57.620
but very different.
 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.877
Some of them were very
conservative,

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:00.530
with conservative denominations
in churches;

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.250
some were very liberal and
progressive.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.020
What I did was I interviewed
both professors and students,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.508
about fifty professors and
about fifty students,

00:03:07.508 --> 00:03:11.454
most of whom were planning to
be ordained into the ministry of

00:03:11.454 --> 00:03:12.229
some sort.
 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.400
Most of these students are
people who are studying theology

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.843
and scripture precisely because
they will end up preaching about

00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:21.960
this and working in churches for
most of their cases.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.003
I asked them,
how are you taught to study the

00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:26.740
Bible?
 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.129
I reported that material back
in the first chapter of that

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.979
book, Pedagogy of the
Bible.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.360
I basically have said,
here is what I've found,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.000
and the main thing I found was
that,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.444
almost all these people,
although they were really being

00:03:39.444 --> 00:03:41.561
taught--
they were supposed to be taught

00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.634
how to read this text as a
theological document for modern

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:45.389
Christians.
 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.751
They actually are pretty much
only being taught historical

00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:49.508
criticism,
what the text meant in the

00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:51.910
ancient world,
just like I am teaching you in

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.568
this class.
 

00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:54.968
Now I think that this makes
perfect for me to use the

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.551
historical critical method to
teach you because this is a

00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:58.660
secular environment.
 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.318
I don't assume that you're
Christian,

00:04:00.318 --> 00:04:02.060
I don't assume that you're
religious at all,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.724
I don't assume that you're
coming into this class with the

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:07.532
interest of studying the New
Testament as a document for your

00:04:07.532 --> 00:04:08.000
faith.
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.290
For some of you that's clearly
the case, but that's not the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.383
structure of this course,
as I explained from the very

00:04:12.383 --> 00:04:13.568
beginning of the semester.
 

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:16.925
I use the historical method as
the way to introduce you to this

00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:20.120
material simply because it's an
easy way to introduce modern

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.098
students to a historical
document as we approach it that

00:04:23.098 --> 00:04:23.639
way.
 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.023
I've also said several times in
the class, that's not the only

00:04:26.023 --> 00:04:27.040
way to read these texts.
 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.199
What we're going to talk about
this week is,

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.310
what are other ways to read
these texts?

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.810
That's what I did in that book.
 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.740
Then in the second chapter of
that book was introducing

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.245
theories of interpretation,
some of which I'll do today,

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:42.060
textual theory and
interpretation theory.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.353
The third chapter of the book
was pre-modern interpretation of

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:50.720
scripture, which is the chapter
that I'm asking you to read.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.303
That's where I take certain key
figures among the church

00:04:54.303 --> 00:04:56.930
fathers,
such as Origen,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.410
Augustine, the Venerable Bede
in England,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.250
Bernard of Clairvaux in the
Middle Ages,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.709
and Thomas Aquinas.
 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:11.786
I show how those people read
the Bible before the invention

00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:15.088
of the modern method of
historical criticism.

00:05:15.088 --> 00:05:18.459
I don't just do that because I
think it's interesting.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:21.461
I'm putting it in that book
because I'm trying to advocate

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:24.569
in that book how schools should
change their curriculum,

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.057
how Christian theological
schools should change their

00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:29.591
curriculum so that it will
better teach people who are

00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:31.839
going to be ministers how to
interpret scripture

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:34.040
theologically and not just
historically.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.459
The third chapter is pre-modern
stuff.

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.389
The fourth chapter of that
book, which you won't read,

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.017
unless you rush right out and
order it from Amazon.com and

00:05:41.017 --> 00:05:43.488
read it on your own time,
is on theological

00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:44.600
interpretation.
 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.110
What does it mean to talk about
a theological interpretation of

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.459
text that's not the same as a
historical interpretation?

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:51.399
I explained that,
I give examples of it,

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.089
and then in the last chapter of
the book,

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:55.728
the fifth chapter,
I lay out what I would propose

00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:58.641
as a new curriculum for
theological education and what

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:01.060
the role of scripture should be
in that.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.723
I talk about that precisely
because I want you to know that

00:06:03.723 --> 00:06:06.019
when you're reading that chapter
for Wednesday,

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:08.069
and I do want you to read it
ahead of time,

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:09.240
I'm not going to cover
everything of that chapter,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.103
so please read it ahead of time
before you come to class on

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:11.490
Wednesday.
 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.790
I'll use examples from it.
 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.949
You'll realize that that's part
of a bigger project that I had,

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.488
which was to address the
difference between historical

00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:20.790
interpretation and theological
interpretation.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.696
That's one of the things that
I'm going to talk about today is

00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:26.601
some of the stuff also that you
would have gotten in chapter 2

00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:28.269
of that book had I assigned it.
 

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:30.920
What does the text mean?
 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.769
How do you ascertain what a
text means?

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:35.826
We talked about this a bit
already in the course but we're

00:06:35.826 --> 00:06:37.089
going to concentrate on it
today.

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:39.911
When there are different and
even contradictory

00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:43.211
interpretations of a text,
whether it's the Bible,

00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:45.860
the Constitution of the United
States,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.470
state laws, a contract in
business,

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.160
when we have disputes about the
interpretation of the text,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.350
how do you settle those
disputes?

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.394
Two honest people,
both of good will,

00:06:56.394 --> 00:06:59.007
both basically intelligent,
read the same text,

00:06:59.007 --> 00:07:01.449
and think it means something
different.

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.680
How do you adjudicate disputes
about a text's meaning?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.569
Where does a text's meaning lie?
 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:13.509
Is it with what the author
intended the text to mean?

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:17.494
Is it in somehow the literal
words, how they would be read by

00:07:17.494 --> 00:07:20.350
an educated, intelligent,
native speaker?

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.509
Are texts allowed to have
multiple meanings?

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:29.069
What kinds of text are
interpreted in what manners?

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:32.738
All of these things fall under
the philosophical field of

00:07:32.738 --> 00:07:35.360
hermeneutics or hermeneutical
theory,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.408
which is just a fancy word
meaning "interpretation

00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:40.442
theory,"
and especially the term

00:07:40.442 --> 00:07:43.492
"hermeneutics"
in theological education means

00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:47.220
the interpretation of the Bible
and how that should be done.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.329
I talked about,
one time previously,

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:52.639
adoptionist Christology.
 

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.680
Remember this?
 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.028
I said there were obviously
some early Christians who

00:07:57.028 --> 00:08:00.699
believed not that Jesus had
always been divine but that at

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.920
some point in his life he was
adopted by God,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.790
either at his birth,
or at his baptism,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.800
or his resurrection.
 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.882
In fact I cited Luke 3:22,
where, according to Luke's

00:08:10.882 --> 00:08:14.947
version of the baptism of Jesus,
a voice comes from heaven,

00:08:14.947 --> 00:08:17.278
and at least in some of the
manuscript says,

00:08:17.278 --> 00:08:18.850
"Today I have begotten
you."

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.230
Remember that?
 

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.370
Of course that is a quotation
from Psalm 22.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.689
But the person quoting it is
implying that Jesus was adopted

00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:33.154
by God, or begotten by God at
his baptism, not at his birth or

00:08:33.154 --> 00:08:33.960
before.
 

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.340
Now if you disagreed with that
interpretation,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.116
and if you're a good orthodox
Christian you should disagree

00:08:40.116 --> 00:08:42.798
with that interpretation because
that's not now Christian

00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:43.470
orthodoxy.
 

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.807
Orthodoxy in the way we think
of it now, it didn't exist of

00:08:46.807 --> 00:08:49.860
course in the first century in a
fully defined way.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.509
It took a few centuries to
develop.

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:54.748
At that this time if you're an
orthodox Christian you're not

00:08:54.748 --> 00:08:58.150
supposed to believe that Jesus
was simply adopted by God at his

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.808
baptism.
 

00:08:58.808 --> 00:09:01.799
If someone came to you with
that reading of that text in the

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:04.690
Gospel of Luke arguing for an
adoptionist Christology,

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.120
how would you argue against
that interpretation?

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.110
You might have argued,
for example,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.960
by saying, let's look at how
this story is told in say the

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.808
Gospel of Mark or in other
places,

00:09:15.808 --> 00:09:17.879
where that "today I have
begotten you"

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:18.538
is not found.
 

00:09:18.538 --> 00:09:21.615
You say, well we're supposed to
use Mark in order to interpret

00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:22.806
Luke,
but the other interpreter could

00:09:22.806 --> 00:09:24.658
just come back and say,
well Mark didn't include it but

00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:25.720
that's not a denial of it.
 

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.590
Luke obviously included it for
some other reason.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.227
You could also say,
well that's probably not what

00:09:33.227 --> 00:09:35.373
Luke meant,
what the author of Luke meant

00:09:35.373 --> 00:09:37.243
to say,
because Luke seems to have

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.780
other passages in Luke and Acts
where it seems he's accepting

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.259
that Jesus was divine in some
sense before his baptism,

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:46.230
maybe even at his birth,
because the angels announce it,

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.038
and there's the worship of
Jesus that happens then.

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:50.268
You might say,
well we have to look at other

00:09:50.268 --> 00:09:53.014
parts of Luke in order to
interpret this verse and not

00:09:53.014 --> 00:09:54.308
just take this verse.
 

00:09:54.308 --> 00:09:57.169
They could just come right back
and say, well,

00:09:57.169 --> 00:09:57.870
who says?
 

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.157
I mean this is the clearest key
in Luke of when precisely Jesus

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:02.960
actually becomes the Son of God.
 

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.368
It's not contradicted by
anything else in Luke,

00:10:05.368 --> 00:10:08.298
so you should take this verse
much more heavily than what

00:10:08.298 --> 00:10:09.870
you're willing to take it.
 

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.379
One of the ways,
I don't know if I mentioned

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.889
this before is--
did I talk about how some

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:18.215
ancient Christians pointed out
that the dove descends upon

00:10:18.215 --> 00:10:20.549
Jesus at his baptism in these
texts,

00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:21.470
right?
 

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.220
The Greek word for
"dove"

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.548
is peristera;
did I talk about this already?

00:10:27.548 --> 00:10:30.336
I can't remember what I talked
about in my different lectures

00:10:30.336 --> 00:10:31.590
on this and what I don't.
 

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.538
The Greek word for
"dove,"

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:41.038
and that's in the text when the
dove comes down on Jesus'

00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:41.788
baptism.
 

00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:45.500
Some of these Christian
exegetes said,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.980
well if you took all the Greek
letters here--

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.976
you know how Greek letters are
just like Hebrew letters have

00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:53.549
numerical value--
if you give each of these

00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:57.720
letters its numerical value and
you add them all up,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.908
it equals 801, that's proof.
 

00:11:02.908 --> 00:11:06.620
It's right there in the text,
801.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.629
You don't know what 801 is?
 

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:12.908
You don't know your numerology
very well?

00:11:12.908 --> 00:11:18.077
What if I told you that 801
also is the addition of alpha,

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:23.335
because it's obviously one,
and what do you think 800 would

00:11:23.335 --> 00:11:23.970
be?
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.419
You want to make a guess?
 

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:28.889
Omega.
 

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:31.750
Alpha plus omega is 801.
 

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.668
And what do we know about alpha
plus omega?

00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:38.485
That's the nature of God,
that's the numerical value of

00:11:38.485 --> 00:11:42.298
God and Christ at the end of the
book of Revelation.

00:11:42.298 --> 00:11:45.129
They went to Revelation,
the last part of Revelation,

00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:48.210
where God at one point says it
and Jesus says it,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:53.355
"I am the alpha and the
omega," alpha/omega equals

00:11:53.355 --> 00:11:53.879
801.
 

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.779
Peristera added together
equals 801,

00:11:56.779 --> 00:11:58.918
that proves that the fullness
of God,

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:02.645
the alpha and the omega,
came upon Jesus in the form of

00:12:02.645 --> 00:12:07.520
this dove at his baptism;
numerical, textual proof of

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.639
their Christology.
 

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:11.538
It's right there in the text.
 

00:12:11.538 --> 00:12:13.751
You could say,
but that's not what the text

00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:16.440
says, but they could just say,
of course it says it,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.336
it's right there,
add up the numbers,

00:12:18.336 --> 00:12:19.178
you idiot.
 

00:12:19.178 --> 00:12:22.328
You see how we would not accept
that interpretation of this

00:12:22.328 --> 00:12:23.090
text, right?
 

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.226
Because we don't practice that
kind of textual interpretation

00:12:26.226 --> 00:12:27.220
most of the time.
 

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.019
That just sounds too foreign to
us.

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:30.320
We just say that's not what the
text means;

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.259
you're just playing with the
text.

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:33.190
You're getting these numbers
and you could make numbers mean

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.908
all kinds of things.
 

00:12:33.908 --> 00:12:36.596
Do you know there are actually
a good many people in the modern

00:12:36.596 --> 00:12:39.326
world, Christians in the modern
world, who still do this sort of

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:39.759
thing?
 

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:43.182
You can buy a book called
Theomatics that adds up

00:12:43.182 --> 00:12:47.105
all the letters of the Bible in
different ways and shows you how

00:12:47.105 --> 00:12:50.902
different things in the Bible
numerically refer to other kinds

00:12:50.902 --> 00:12:54.139
of prophecy events and all this
sort of thing.

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:56.839
There are actually religious
people now who still practice

00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:58.259
this form of interpretation.
 

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:00.846
How would you argue against
that form of interpretation,

00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:03.480
if you just want to say that's
not what the text says?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.812
There's nothing you could do
that would basically prove to a

00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:09.860
person who believes that,
that that's not what the text

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.370
says.
 

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.440
You can't just go to Mark and
say,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.778
but look let me read it to you,
that's not what it says,

00:13:15.778 --> 00:13:17.917
and they could just say,
no you read it of course that's

00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:18.500
what it says.
 

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.932
You just read it;
the numbers were there when you

00:13:20.932 --> 00:13:21.320
read them.
 

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.011
There's no way just appealing
to a text itself can settle

00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:28.967
disputes about the meaning of a
text unless you and the other

00:13:28.967 --> 00:13:32.990
person doing the arguing share
the basic presuppositions about

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.418
what counts as a good
interpretation and what doesn't

00:13:36.418 --> 00:13:38.990
count as a good interpretation.
 

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.582
You have to share assumptions
about method of interpretation

00:13:42.582 --> 00:13:46.238
before you can even come to an
agreement about the meaning of

00:13:46.238 --> 00:13:47.029
the text.
 

00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:51.365
What that proves is that the
text can't control its own

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:52.168
meaning.
 

00:13:52.168 --> 00:13:55.437
The meaning of the text is not
contained there in the text

00:13:55.437 --> 00:13:57.788
simply to be passively seen by
someone.

00:13:57.788 --> 00:14:01.803
You have to interpret it,
and you have to learn the

00:14:01.803 --> 00:14:06.701
methods of interpretation that
are appropriate in your society

00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.788
for a particular text.
 

00:14:08.788 --> 00:14:11.355
So the fact,
though, is the way ancient

00:14:11.355 --> 00:14:14.720
people interpret a text,
as this example shows,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.570
is not the way I have been
teaching you in this class to

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:19.899
interpret texts.
 

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:23.370
What we want to do is put our
imaginations back,

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.923
what counted for early
Christians as a good

00:14:25.923 --> 00:14:29.907
interpretation of the text,
and see what methods they used,

00:14:29.907 --> 00:14:32.759
and stretch our imaginations a
bit more.

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:36.796
It's not hard to do because the
New Testament writers themselves

00:14:36.796 --> 00:14:40.320
are repeatedly interpreting
scripture for themselves.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.316
Now remember,
the New Testament writers

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:45.311
aren't interpreting the New
Testament as scripture because

00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:47.360
they are writing the New
Testament.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.610
The New Testament didn't exist
yet as scripture.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.501
When we read a Gospel writer
who has Jesus interpreting

00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:55.859
scripture,
the scripture he's interpreting

00:14:55.859 --> 00:14:58.149
is what Christians would call
the Old Testament,

00:14:58.149 --> 00:15:00.870
or what Jews would call the
Hebrew Bible.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.363
For them it was just scripture,
Jewish scripture,

00:15:03.363 --> 00:15:06.220
that was all the scripture that
existed for the earliest

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.090
Christians was Jewish scripture.
 

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.004
When they're interpreting what
we today might call the Old

00:15:11.004 --> 00:15:12.706
Testament,
they're not interpreting the

00:15:12.706 --> 00:15:14.991
New Testament,
but this is great because we

00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.498
have New Testament writers who
now occupy the scripture for

00:15:18.498 --> 00:15:22.184
Christians interpreting other
scripture that was scripture for

00:15:22.184 --> 00:15:24.460
them,
so we can see how they did it.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.307
Look, for example,
at Psalm--well,

00:15:26.307 --> 00:15:29.110
I've already done that I'm not
going to do that.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.631
Psalm 22, if you want to look
at that at some point,

00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:34.549
is the Psalm that talks about
Jesus--see I did it myself.

00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:37.211
It's not talking about Jesus;
Psalm 22 in its historical

00:15:37.211 --> 00:15:40.360
context is talking about King
David or some heroic figure

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.058
who's suffering,
a righteous man who suffers.

00:15:43.058 --> 00:15:46.649
It talks about someone's hands
and feet being pierced,

00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:49.552
it talks about them dividing
his garments and casting lots

00:15:49.552 --> 00:15:52.879
for his clothes,
it talks about drinking vinegar

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:56.750
and gall mixed together,
or wine, and it sounds like

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.500
someone being crucified.
 

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.686
And sure enough early
Christians interpreted that

00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:05.668
Psalm as a prophetic Psalm about
the crucifixion of Jesus.

00:16:05.668 --> 00:16:07.928
In fact, when you see the
crucifixion of Jesus,

00:16:07.928 --> 00:16:10.755
the different things that
happen in the Gospel accounts

00:16:10.755 --> 00:16:14.105
for the crucifixion of Jesus are
echoing the things in that Psalm

00:16:14.105 --> 00:16:17.118
because the later writers said,
well Psalm 22 must be talking

00:16:17.118 --> 00:16:20.144
about Jesus' crucifixion,
so we'll add details to the

00:16:20.144 --> 00:16:22.558
account to make it fit Psalm 22.
 

00:16:22.558 --> 00:16:26.700
In that case what you already
got is Christian writers,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.831
followers of Jesus,
very quickly interpreting the

00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:32.482
text,
their holy text,

00:16:32.482 --> 00:16:35.793
to be not about the historical
Jewish king that the text

00:16:35.793 --> 00:16:38.423
originally referred to,
or that we as historical

00:16:38.423 --> 00:16:39.220
critics would say.
 

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.041
Historical critics would say,
no Psalm 22 was not about

00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:44.179
Jesus;
it's about some king in the

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:47.750
ancient near eastern situation,
centuries before Jesus.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.230
That's not the way the early
Christians did it.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.563
They said, no,
it's got to be about Jesus,

00:16:51.563 --> 00:16:54.751
so they're already doing
something that modern historical

00:16:54.751 --> 00:16:56.460
critics would then reject.
 

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.298
It my lecture next time on
medieval exegesis,

00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:02.301
I'm actually going to walk you
through some of the basic

00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:05.356
presuppositions of modern
historical critical method that

00:17:05.356 --> 00:17:07.538
you've been learning in this
class,

00:17:07.538 --> 00:17:09.969
and I'm going to make it
explicit what you've already

00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:12.818
been learning so you'll have the
method clear in your head.

00:17:12.818 --> 00:17:15.711
I'm also going to talk about
how did this method arise in the

00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:18.460
modern world and why did it
arise in the modern world,

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.910
so we'll talk about that a
little bit later.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.363
Let's just look at how New
Testament writers then interpret

00:17:22.363 --> 00:17:22.660
text.
 

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:28.205
Look at Mark 10,
this is when some Pharisees

00:17:28.205 --> 00:17:34.009
come and they question Jesus
about divorce.

00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:39.358
Is it okay, in his teaching,
for a man to divorce his wife?

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:41.333
Now of course,
notice it's already put in a

00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:44.340
patriarchal context because it's
not about how a wife can divorce

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.880
her husband,
or how both of them can divorce

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.608
one another.
 

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:51.730
We're already in a patriarchal
context because the question is

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.650
phrased as, is it alright for a
man to divorce his wife?

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.470
Look at 10:3,
"He answered them,

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.695
"'What did Moses command
you?'" Ah,

00:17:59.695 --> 00:18:00.910
that's a good thing.
 

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.278
Let's just look at scripture.
 

00:18:02.278 --> 00:18:04.424
Scripture will probably tell us
whether divorce is allowed by

00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:04.640
God.
 

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.396
"They said,
'Moses allowed a man to write a

00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:10.330
certificate of dismissal and to
divorce her.'"

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.519
Jesus says,
well there's your answer.

00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:16.358
No that's not what Jesus says,
right?

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:18.756
"Jesus said to them,
'Because of your hardness of

00:18:18.756 --> 00:18:20.700
heart he wrote this commandment
for you,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.131
but from the beginning of
creation God made them male and

00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:24.738
female.'"
Well that sounds like a

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:27.059
quotation,
where is that a quotation from?

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:29.190
I can't hear you.
 

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.660
Students:  Genesis.
 

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.230
Prof: Thank you.
 

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.308
I'm not asking these questions
to hear myself talk.

00:18:33.308 --> 00:18:35.509
I know they're rhetorical
questions but just answer them

00:18:35.509 --> 00:18:36.108
anyway, okay?
 

00:18:36.108 --> 00:18:40.880
That's one quotation from
Genesis, but then the next one--

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.645
"For this reason a man
shall leave his father and

00:18:42.645 --> 00:18:43.880
mother be joined to his
wife."

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.160
That's also from--say it.
 

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.618
Students:  Genesis.
 

00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:49.997
Prof: Genesis,
but are these two quotations

00:18:49.997 --> 00:18:51.548
from the same part of Genesis?
 

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:54.818
No, they're from two separate
chapters.

00:18:54.818 --> 00:18:57.618
Notice what's going on here,
Jesus first says,

00:18:57.618 --> 00:18:59.417
what did Moses write?,
which seems to show he's

00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:00.932
saying,
okay we'll just go to scripture

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:02.710
and scripture will tell us and
that'll give us--

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.678
read scripture like a rulebook
and it'll tell us whether

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:05.430
divorce is allowed.
 

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.868
Then they quote back what is
exactly the proper scripture.

00:19:09.868 --> 00:19:15.242
They're quoting Deuteronomy 24,
the twenty-fourth chapter of

00:19:15.242 --> 00:19:17.867
Deuteronomy,
in the law of Moses,

00:19:17.867 --> 00:19:21.519
it says, if a man wants to
divorce his wife that's fine,

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:23.819
but what it says,
he has to give her a written

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:26.102
certificate of divorce,
send her away,

00:19:26.102 --> 00:19:28.618
she's free to remarry somebody
else.

00:19:28.618 --> 00:19:33.012
But if she's divorced from the
second husband she can't go back

00:19:33.012 --> 00:19:36.058
and be joined again to the first
husband.

00:19:36.058 --> 00:19:37.923
In other words,
the law is, you can divorce

00:19:37.923 --> 00:19:39.653
your wife, but once you've
divorced her,

00:19:39.653 --> 00:19:42.136
and she ends up with another
guy, you can't take her back

00:19:42.136 --> 00:19:42.670
again.
 

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.210
That was the ruling in the Law
of Moses.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.740
They cite a text that's
actually about divorce.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.638
Jesus doesn't accept that text,
and his interpretation sets

00:19:54.638 --> 00:19:57.105
aside that law--
that rule by saying,

00:19:57.105 --> 00:19:59.993
oh well that was a concession
that Moses did for your hardness

00:19:59.993 --> 00:20:01.980
of heart,
that really wasn't God's will.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.996
God's will on this is seen in a
different text,

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.028
and I'll quote you that text.
 

00:20:07.028 --> 00:20:11.819
But where in Genesis 1 and 2 is
divorce ever mentioned?

00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:13.338
Nowhere.
 

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:19.102
The Genesis passage that Jesus
quotes here is not about

00:20:19.102 --> 00:20:22.410
divorce, it's about marriage.
 

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.150
Genesis doesn't forbid divorce
explicitly, it just says,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.548
men and women will get together
and get married.

00:20:29.548 --> 00:20:34.523
God made them male and female,
man will leave his parents and

00:20:34.523 --> 00:20:36.098
come to his wife.
 

00:20:36.098 --> 00:20:38.627
There's nothing in
Genesis--Jesus is basically

00:20:38.627 --> 00:20:41.942
breaking one of the major rules
of textual interpretation of

00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:45.818
hermeneutical theory that's not
only around in the modern world,

00:20:45.818 --> 00:20:47.880
but also was around even the
ancient world,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:54.088
which is: interpret the obscure
by reference to the clear.

00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:56.592
In other words,
if you have a text that you're

00:20:56.592 --> 00:20:59.038
not clear about the
interpretation of it,

00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:03.082
it's okay in ancient
interpretation theory to go to

00:21:03.082 --> 00:21:07.690
another text that might shed
light on that cloudy text.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.223
If you've got a text that's
clear, don't go looking for a

00:21:11.223 --> 00:21:14.884
more obscure text and try to
illuminate the clear text with

00:21:14.884 --> 00:21:16.210
the obscure text.
 

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.050
That of course is against
common sense,

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:19.650
right?
 

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.058
But that's exactly what Jesus
is doing here.

00:21:22.058 --> 00:21:25.909
He feels that he has the
liberty to basically set aside a

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.588
clear teaching that permits
divorce,

00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:32.119
and he goes and looks for two
other texts that don't say

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:35.935
anything about divorce,
and he uses them to express

00:21:35.935 --> 00:21:36.890
God's will.
 

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.430
Of course what he has to do is
add to the text.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.972
He basically has to add to the
Genesis text that not only is

00:21:41.972 --> 00:21:44.530
this a teaching about marriage,
but therefore,

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.900
it is implicitly therefore a
teaching against divorce,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.107
whereas, you and I might read
that Genesis text and not see

00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:54.210
anything about divorce in it at
all.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.442
What this shows is Jesus
himself is presented as

00:21:57.442 --> 00:22:01.156
interpreting scripture in ways
that would be completely

00:22:01.156 --> 00:22:05.353
unacceptable in a modern context
to most scholars of the Bible

00:22:05.353 --> 00:22:09.209
who are going to say,
no, you're breaking several

00:22:09.209 --> 00:22:11.210
rules about interpretation.
 

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.150
There's all kinds of things on
this.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.630
Remember when we talked about
Galatians?

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.673
I read you Paul's
interpretation of the Hagar and

00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:20.950
Sarah story from Genesis.
 

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.230
Remember how the story goes?
 

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.806
Abraham's married to Sarah,
but she's not having any

00:22:25.806 --> 00:22:27.068
children, she's barren.
 

00:22:27.068 --> 00:22:29.970
At least that's--in the ancient
world it was always the women--

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.719
woman's fault,
it was the woman who was

00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:34.061
barren,
never the man in common ways of

00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:34.670
thinking.
 

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.319
Of course we know differently
than that now,

00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:38.240
but they always present it as,
Sarah was barren.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.150
Abraham has a child with Hagar,
Sarah's slave.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:48.068
Then Paul, instead of taking
Sarah as representing Judaism,

00:22:48.068 --> 00:22:52.950
the Torah, Moses,
the law, and Jerusalem,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:23:00.088
he makes Hagar represent the
law, the current Jewish people,

00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:02.480
and Jerusalem,
Jerusalem of the Jews.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.150
Paul also seems perfectly free
to turn this text of Genesis,

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.959
which seems like simply a
historical talk about how did

00:23:10.959 --> 00:23:13.038
Abraham start having his
descendants,

00:23:13.038 --> 00:23:15.358
one through his wife and one
through his slave,

00:23:15.358 --> 00:23:19.913
and he flips that around into
being an allegory about Gentiles

00:23:19.913 --> 00:23:24.242
and Jews and how non-Jews would
be taken into Israel and at

00:23:24.242 --> 00:23:28.423
least some of Israel would be
rejected by God and the law

00:23:28.423 --> 00:23:30.288
would be put aside.
 

00:23:30.288 --> 00:23:34.858
Paul also interprets scripture
in ways that seem to us not only

00:23:34.858 --> 00:23:38.838
very free but actually rather
bizarre in some ways,

00:23:38.838 --> 00:23:41.630
if you're not used to seeing
this in the ancient world.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.999
Let's look at Hebrews now
because what Hebrews is,

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:48.919
is one long extended sermon
that is also an interpretation

00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:50.568
of Jewish scripture.
 

00:23:50.568 --> 00:23:55.074
What's really odd is that
Hebrews is a text that uses

00:23:55.074 --> 00:23:59.751
interpretation of Jewish
scripture to argue against the

00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:03.910
superiority of Jewish worship
and tradition.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.443
First thing,
what is Hebrews and what is it

00:24:07.443 --> 00:24:07.950
not?
 

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.361
I said from the very beginning
of the semester,

00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:13.452
it was called the Epistle to
the Hebrews, the Epistle to the

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:15.759
Jews, and I said it's not really
either.

00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:17.078
It's not a letter.
 

00:24:17.078 --> 00:24:21.068
In fact, it even tells you in
chapter 13 that it's a sermon of

00:24:21.068 --> 00:24:23.498
admonition;
it says a speech of

00:24:23.498 --> 00:24:26.240
encouragement,
he says in 13:22.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.769
It's not a letter really,
it has a letter closing added

00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:31.942
to it a bit,
but it's not really a letter,

00:24:31.942 --> 00:24:34.400
it's a sermon,
and it even looks like it quite

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.769
possibly could have been written
to be spoken out loud as a

00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:38.349
sermon.
 

00:24:38.349 --> 00:24:40.180
It's also not by Paul.
 

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.740
Now it doesn't claim to be by
Paul,

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.083
but some Christians throughout
the centuries have assumed that

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:48.106
it was by Paul,
and that's why it's included in

00:24:48.106 --> 00:24:50.210
the Canon after Paul's letters.
 

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.409
Notice how Hebrews is a long
document and we've noticed that

00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:58.038
the order of canonicity in
Paul's letters in the New

00:24:58.038 --> 00:25:00.528
Testament is by length of book.
 

00:25:00.528 --> 00:25:02.598
They didn't follow a
chronological order;

00:25:02.598 --> 00:25:05.830
they put Romans first because
it's the longest and then the

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.951
letters of Paul come in the
Canon, more or less with some

00:25:08.951 --> 00:25:10.400
exceptions, by length.
 

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.112
You get to Philemon as the last
of the thirteen letters of Paul,

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:17.000
and it's of course very short,
one little page.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.808
Then you have Hebrews,
which is a big book,

00:25:18.808 --> 00:25:22.136
so what's clearly going on is
that it sort of got connected up

00:25:22.136 --> 00:25:25.246
to the letters of Paul in
antiquity even though it doesn't

00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:28.088
claim to be by Paul,
and some people in antiquity

00:25:28.088 --> 00:25:29.200
thought it was Paul.
 

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.402
In fact some people believed
that's how it got into the Canon

00:25:32.402 --> 00:25:35.124
because it was kind of a
controversial letter in the

00:25:35.124 --> 00:25:38.380
ancient world so some people
didn't want it in the Canon.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.037
Some people think it got into
the Canon precisely because some

00:25:40.037 --> 00:25:41.179
people claimed,
oh well it's really by Paul

00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:41.558
after all.
 

00:25:41.558 --> 00:25:44.578
Who is--who wrote it though if
Paul didn't?

00:25:44.578 --> 00:25:46.380
There have been guesses all
over the place.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.236
Some people say Luke wrote it
because it looks like a very--it

00:25:49.236 --> 00:25:50.358
looks very good Greek.
 

00:25:50.358 --> 00:25:52.334
For example,
there's some books in the New

00:25:52.334 --> 00:25:54.259
Testament that are really lousy
Greek.

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:55.740
The book of Revelation is lousy
Greek.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.509
Yes sir.
 

00:25:56.509 --> 00:25:58.229
Student:  Do you mean
the author of the

00:25:58.229 --> 00:25:59.298
&gt;?
 

00:25:59.298 --> 00:26:01.874
Prof: Well,
sometimes people say it was

00:26:01.874 --> 00:26:04.747
Luke, the physician,
who also was the author of Luke

00:26:04.747 --> 00:26:06.558
and Acts,
and then also of Hebrews.

00:26:06.558 --> 00:26:09.505
Some people say it was whoever
wrote Luke, although we don't

00:26:09.505 --> 00:26:11.750
know who that was,
so the people have proposed

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.900
different theories.
 

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.669
Since the Epistle to the
Hebrews does look like it has

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:19.868
some influence from Pauline type
theology,

00:26:19.868 --> 00:26:22.568
which has led some people to
say, since Luke was a traveling

00:26:22.568 --> 00:26:25.212
companion of Paul,
even if the Gospel of Luke was

00:26:25.212 --> 00:26:27.848
not by Luke maybe Luke who was
more educated,

00:26:27.848 --> 00:26:30.339
he's called a physician in
Acts, maybe he was the one who

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:30.828
wrote it.
 

00:26:30.828 --> 00:26:32.019
So there have been lots of
theories.

00:26:32.019 --> 00:26:36.502
Some people have said Apollos,
because remember Apollos is

00:26:36.502 --> 00:26:40.513
called in Acts someone who
really has a good gift of

00:26:40.513 --> 00:26:41.380
speech.
 

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.529
He's a great rhetorician.
 

00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:44.920
Apollos is depicted in Acts as
a great rhetorician.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.304
Well this is good rhetoric,
so somebody could say maybe

00:26:47.304 --> 00:26:49.598
this is by Apollos and just
doesn't have his name.

00:26:49.598 --> 00:26:51.308
Some people said maybe it's by
Barnabas.

00:26:51.308 --> 00:26:53.444
Remember it says it calls
itself a speech of

00:26:53.444 --> 00:26:55.625
encouragement,
and we're told in Acts that

00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:58.693
Barnabas' name was given to him
because it means a "son of

00:26:58.693 --> 00:27:00.872
encouragement,"
so some people say maybe

00:27:00.872 --> 00:27:02.108
Barnabas wrote this.
 

00:27:02.108 --> 00:27:04.703
And then some people,
it was asked last week whether

00:27:04.703 --> 00:27:07.654
a woman may have written the
Acts of Paul and Thecla

00:27:07.654 --> 00:27:09.936
and I said,
probably not since there is a

00:27:09.936 --> 00:27:12.670
second century author who says
he knows who wrote it.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:13.660
That's disputed.
 

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.032
Some people have said Prisca
may be the author of this

00:27:17.032 --> 00:27:19.617
letter,
so maybe a woman was actually

00:27:19.617 --> 00:27:21.482
written--
maybe a woman has actually

00:27:21.482 --> 00:27:23.778
written one piece of our New
Testament after all.

00:27:23.778 --> 00:27:26.960
The problem with all these
suggestions is that they're

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.098
absolute guesses.
 

00:27:28.098 --> 00:27:31.805
We have no evidence at all
neither from the letter itself,

00:27:31.805 --> 00:27:33.690
nor from the ancient world.
 

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.816
In fact, the smartest exegete
in the ancient world was a

00:27:36.816 --> 00:27:40.228
church father named Origen and
he gave some different guesses

00:27:40.228 --> 00:27:43.808
about who may have written it
and then at the end he said,

00:27:43.808 --> 00:27:46.680
God knows, God knows who the
author of Hebrews is,

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.103
and God's the only one
apparently who knows who wrote

00:27:49.103 --> 00:27:49.568
Hebrews.
 

00:27:49.568 --> 00:27:52.558
It is a word of encouragement
though,

00:27:52.558 --> 00:27:55.490
it's a sermon,
it uses Hellenistic Jewish

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.407
style--
speech styles and rhetoric and

00:27:58.407 --> 00:28:01.568
Hellenistic Jewish exegetical
techniques.

00:28:01.568 --> 00:28:06.375
In fact, it's an example of a
certain kind of Jewish Platonism

00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:10.865
or popular Platonism because it
contrasts the real and the

00:28:10.865 --> 00:28:13.640
apparent,
the eternal versus the

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.663
temporal, the spiritual is
superior for example to the

00:28:17.663 --> 00:28:22.166
physical and the shadow,
so you've got the spiritual is

00:28:22.166 --> 00:28:25.180
contrasted with the shadow of
things.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.239
All these are dualisms that
come up in sort of popular

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:30.259
Platonizing rhetoric of the
time.

00:28:30.259 --> 00:28:33.794
Now so it's clearly--that
doesn't mean it's written by a

00:28:33.794 --> 00:28:34.180
Jew.
 

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.026
It could have been written by a
Gentile who just happens to be

00:28:38.026 --> 00:28:41.808
very well educated in Jewish
scripture and has picked up also

00:28:41.808 --> 00:28:44.710
this Jewish exegetical kind of
technique,

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.470
which is what he uses.
 

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.252
I should also say this
exegetical technique I'm talking

00:28:49.252 --> 00:28:51.108
about was not special to the
Jews.

00:28:51.108 --> 00:28:53.480
Greeks could read texts like
this also.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.395
So there were all kinds of
attempts to read Homer,

00:28:56.395 --> 00:28:58.717
for example,
the Iliad or the Odyssey as

00:28:58.717 --> 00:29:00.858
allegories for physical science.
 

00:29:00.858 --> 00:29:03.330
The different gods represented
air, or fire,

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.400
or other elements of the
universe.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.328
By the first century,
when this speech was composed,

00:29:08.328 --> 00:29:11.977
this way of interpreting texts
was already well known to

00:29:11.977 --> 00:29:14.950
educated people more broadly,
not just Jews.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.670
But Jews used it also in
reading scripture.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.282
In fact, the most famous was
Philo of Alexandria,

00:29:20.282 --> 00:29:22.568
who lived a bit before the time
of Paul.

00:29:22.568 --> 00:29:27.077
Well, he was around the same
time but he probably died before

00:29:27.077 --> 00:29:27.980
Paul died.
 

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.625
Philo has--we have lots and
lots of text in which he

00:29:30.625 --> 00:29:33.843
interprets the Jewish scripture
through these allegorical kinds

00:29:33.843 --> 00:29:35.660
of methods among other methods.
 

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.079
I've given you an outline to
the letter of Hebrews.

00:29:39.079 --> 00:29:39.980
So look at that.
 

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.626
And I want to walk you through
it real quick because one of the

00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:45.145
things you can tell immediately
about this text is that it's

00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:46.470
very carefully constructed.
 

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.066
If you're just reading through
in one sitting you might not

00:29:49.066 --> 00:29:50.990
catch all this,
so I've made the outline and

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.288
I'll talk you through it.
 

00:29:52.288 --> 00:29:56.636
First, there's the introduction
and the thesis,

00:29:56.636 --> 00:30:01.079
the first two verses,
let me get there first.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.994
I wish I knew a New Testament
song so I would know exactly

00:30:07.994 --> 00:30:09.190
where to find Hebrews.
 

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.230
"Long ago God spoke to our
ancestors in many and various

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.848
ways by the prophets."
 

00:30:18.848 --> 00:30:21.869
We know this is going to be
about the message of God given

00:30:21.869 --> 00:30:23.460
through the Jewish prophets.
 

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.653
"But in these last days he
has spoken to us by a Son whom

00:30:26.653 --> 00:30:29.952
he appointed heir of all things
through whom he also created the

00:30:29.952 --> 00:30:30.788
world."
 

00:30:30.788 --> 00:30:34.506
He's going to contrast what was
said long ago through the

00:30:34.506 --> 00:30:38.489
prophets with what we followers
of Jesus have learned through

00:30:38.489 --> 00:30:39.019
him.
 

00:30:39.019 --> 00:30:43.830
Already this contrast of things
is--the thesis of the whole

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:48.808
speech is the old and the new,
and the superiority of the new

00:30:48.808 --> 00:30:50.220
over the old.
 

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.134
The next section,
section two on your handout,

00:30:53.134 --> 00:30:56.180
the introduction to the
superiority of Jesus.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:01.180
The first part is 1:3 through
2:18;

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.078
he shows that Jesus is superior
to the angels.

00:31:04.078 --> 00:31:09.170
"To what angel did God
ever say you are my son?"

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:14.071
He takes quotations from the
Psalms that God is addressing to

00:31:14.071 --> 00:31:18.412
the Davidic King in the Psalms,
he takes those as being

00:31:18.412 --> 00:31:22.692
references to Jesus and then he
shows God never made these kinds

00:31:22.692 --> 00:31:25.935
of promises to angels,
therefore Jesus is superior to

00:31:25.935 --> 00:31:26.328
angels.
 

00:31:26.328 --> 00:31:32.098
B, from 3:1 to 4:13,
Jesus is superior to Moses,

00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:34.214
so he shows,
through quoting scripture

00:31:34.214 --> 00:31:35.585
again,
Jewish scripture,

00:31:35.585 --> 00:31:38.654
that God says things to Jesus
that he doesn't say to Moses and

00:31:38.654 --> 00:31:39.308
to Joshua.
 

00:31:39.308 --> 00:31:41.977
Of course Joshua is just the
one who inherited Moses'

00:31:41.977 --> 00:31:45.056
position so he's including it in
this superiority of Jesus to

00:31:45.056 --> 00:31:46.390
both Moses and Joshua.
 

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:50.270
And C, from 4:15 to 5:10,
Jesus is superior to the old

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.858
high priesthood,
the Israelite high priesthood.

00:31:53.858 --> 00:31:55.720
Then you've got,
I put them in bold,

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.486
a digression,
a kind of excursus in the main

00:31:59.486 --> 00:32:01.873
outline,
and these are very important

00:32:01.873 --> 00:32:05.076
because these are very skillful
digressions that will foreshadow

00:32:05.076 --> 00:32:08.230
something that's going to come
up later in the same sermon.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.558
This one he talks a bit about
Melchizedek.

00:32:11.558 --> 00:32:17.250
And so this little section,
after 5:10, is foreshadowing

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:22.528
what we'll see in V down further
in your handout;

00:32:22.528 --> 00:32:24.318
so the foreshadowing of
Melchizedek.

00:32:24.318 --> 00:32:27.868
Then you have III which a
digression of--

00:32:27.868 --> 00:32:30.934
that goes from 5:11 to 6:12,
and there you get a longer

00:32:30.934 --> 00:32:32.813
digression,
which is an invitation to

00:32:32.813 --> 00:32:33.548
higher doctrine.
 

00:32:33.548 --> 00:32:35.832
He says you need to stop being
babies, you've been drinking

00:32:35.832 --> 00:32:38.310
milk, I'm going to give you some
meat, so we're going to go onto

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.718
higher things;
so that's a digression which is

00:32:40.718 --> 00:32:41.538
an invitation.
 

00:32:41.538 --> 00:32:43.390
Then there's another
foreshadowing,

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:46.904
the mention of examples of
faith at 6:12 foreshadows what

00:32:46.904 --> 00:32:50.421
will be in section VII below
when he gives a long list of

00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:53.308
examples of faith in the Jewish
scripture.

00:32:53.308 --> 00:32:56.700
Then IV, the introduction to
the second half of the sermon,

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.670
which is our assurances,
"We can be assured as

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.282
followers of Jesus that we
have…"

00:33:02.282 --> 00:33:05.431
So 6:13 to 6:20 is the
introduction to the second half

00:33:05.431 --> 00:33:06.618
of the sermon.
 

00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:09.093
Then in section V,
Jesus is compared to

00:33:09.093 --> 00:33:12.998
Melchizedek, I'll talk about
that in a little bit more detail

00:33:12.998 --> 00:33:14.038
in a minute.
 

00:33:14.038 --> 00:33:19.184
First, (a) Melchizedek is
superior to Abraham and the

00:33:19.184 --> 00:33:25.023
Levitical priesthood in 7:1-14,
then in (b) Jesus is himself

00:33:25.023 --> 00:33:28.288
the new Melchizedek,
7:15-28.

00:33:28.288 --> 00:33:32.068
VI, the reality compared to the
shadow.

00:33:32.068 --> 00:33:36.027
Now this is where you get this
thing of the reality is always

00:33:36.027 --> 00:33:40.048
superior to the shadow and he
makes Jesus and the liturgy,

00:33:40.048 --> 00:33:42.406
the service,
the worship that Jesus

00:33:42.406 --> 00:33:46.082
introduces superior to the
shadow that is the previous

00:33:46.082 --> 00:33:49.548
Jewish high priesthood and
tabernacle liturgy.

00:33:49.548 --> 00:33:52.510
You have a comparison here
between earthly and heavenly

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:53.170
liturgies.
 

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.530
Then section VII,
this is called is

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.449
paranesis,
the Greek word just means

00:33:58.449 --> 00:34:00.950
"ethical instruction."
 

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:04.817
I've introduced this word
before when I was talking about

00:34:04.817 --> 00:34:07.357
James,
so this is the paranetical

00:34:07.357 --> 00:34:10.315
section of the sermon,
"Therefore,"

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:13.050
he says in chapter 10:19,
"you should do this."

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.947
You have (a) an introduction to
these things,

00:34:15.947 --> 00:34:19.570
(b) do this in spite of
sufferings, (c) several examples

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.349
of faith in chapter 11.
 

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:23.570
Chapter 11 is basically a list
of examples of faith in the

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.306
Jewish scripture;
(d) encouragement chapter,

00:34:26.306 --> 00:34:30.454
chapter 12, then practical
detailed paranesis in

00:34:30.454 --> 00:34:31.530
chapter 13.
 

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.784
Then finally a call to leave
the camp, chapter 13:8-16,

00:34:34.784 --> 00:34:38.101
which I'll come back to in a
minute, and then in closing

00:34:38.101 --> 00:34:39.969
admonition and benediction.
 

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:40.969
Now notice what you've got.
 

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:45.599
This is a very well structured,
well outlined speech,

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:48.280
and it even has hints of what's
going to come later,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.954
so you have foreshadows of
things and you have reminders of

00:34:51.954 --> 00:34:54.110
things that are have come about.
 

00:34:58.659 --> 00:35:03.126
The basic point of the letter
then is this superiority of

00:35:03.126 --> 00:35:07.172
Jesus' leitourgia,
this is from the Greek

00:35:07.172 --> 00:35:10.634
word--this is where we get the
English word

00:35:10.634 --> 00:35:12.530
"liturgy."
 

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.547
In modern English it refers to
worship services,

00:35:15.547 --> 00:35:18.949
so the liturgy of a worship
service is what you do.

00:35:18.949 --> 00:35:20.119
Do you cross yourself?
 

00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:20.820
Do you bow?
 

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.590
Do you kneel?
 

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.880
What prayers do you say?
 

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.420
What does your prayer book say
and that sort of thing?

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.547
Those are all liturgy in
English, but it comes from the

00:35:27.547 --> 00:35:30.329
Greek work which had a much
broader reference.

00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:31.349
It meant any kind of service.
 

00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:34.614
For example,
when a rich man gave a bunch of

00:35:34.614 --> 00:35:38.260
money to a town and they had a
big sacrifice,

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.585
and a parade,
and a festival,

00:35:39.585 --> 00:35:42.190
that was called a liturgy,
a leitourgia.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.047
It was a service to the gods,
but it was also a service to

00:35:45.047 --> 00:35:45.599
the town.
 

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:49.976
So this comes to mean a broader
sense of service and worship and

00:35:49.976 --> 00:35:53.309
all that sort of thing,
and that's the Greek word

00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:55.949
that's here translated as
service.

00:35:55.949 --> 00:35:58.239
In fact, the word
leitourgos,

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:01.469
the same word but with o-s on
the end of it,

00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:07.262
means "a servant"
and that's what he calls angels

00:36:07.262 --> 00:36:09.860
in Hebrews 1:7 and 1:14.
 

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.989
So angels are called servants;
they're using the same word.

00:36:12.989 --> 00:36:15.634
In most of Hebrews,
therefore, I said,

00:36:15.634 --> 00:36:18.565
is a comparison between two
liturgies, two

00:36:18.565 --> 00:36:20.210
leitourgiai.
 

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:23.364
One is between that of Moses
and the Tabernacle,

00:36:23.364 --> 00:36:27.324
as we see in the Hebrew Bible
and the other is that of Jesus

00:36:27.324 --> 00:36:29.539
introduced by his priesthood.
 

00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:31.829
In fact what we have--we have
another Greek word.

00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:35.728
So you get all this good Greek
you can use at cocktail parties

00:36:35.728 --> 00:36:38.539
and impress your friends and get
new jobs.

00:36:41.768 --> 00:36:44.576
You know that the Wall Street
banks will be really impressed

00:36:44.576 --> 00:36:46.480
that you know some Greek words,
right?

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:52.487
The Greek word for comparison
is synkrisis--do we have

00:36:52.487 --> 00:36:54.289
an English word?
 

00:36:54.289 --> 00:36:58.452
We don't have an English word
that comes from that,

00:36:58.452 --> 00:36:59.119
do we?
 

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:01.849
Synchretic is not--is different
then synkrisis.

00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:04.264
So it comes from the Greek
word for "judgment,"

00:37:04.264 --> 00:37:05.931
krisis,
and we get "crisis"

00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:06.766
from it,
which means a

00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:08.373
"judgment"
or some critical thing

00:37:08.373 --> 00:37:10.103
happening,
and the Greek word for

00:37:10.103 --> 00:37:11.079
"with."
 

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.757
When you judge something with
something else that's a

00:37:13.757 --> 00:37:16.130
comparison,
so synkrisis is a

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:20.393
rhetorical term used by ancient
education to describe precisely

00:37:20.393 --> 00:37:23.695
this kind of speech:
a comparison of one thing to

00:37:23.695 --> 00:37:24.590
another.
 

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.996
If you were a high school boy,
you would have learned

00:37:26.996 --> 00:37:29.663
rhetorical styles,
you would have practiced at how

00:37:29.663 --> 00:37:31.630
to give a synkrisis
speech,

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.869
a speech of comparison.
 

00:37:32.869 --> 00:37:35.795
Sort of like in high school you
were taught to do a compare and

00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:36.929
contrast essay,
right?

00:37:36.929 --> 00:37:39.472
You're taught a form,
that's what Hebrews is,

00:37:39.472 --> 00:37:42.302
is a speech in the
synkrisis form and these

00:37:42.302 --> 00:37:43.170
two things.
 

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:47.039
Now notice though what the
means of demonstration is.

00:37:47.039 --> 00:37:51.400
Look at Hebrews 8:7,
he's going to prove to you,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.150
the hearers--of course you're
not going to need a whole lot of

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.809
proof because you're already in
this Christian community.

00:37:56.809 --> 00:37:58.702
You wouldn't be listening to
this sermon if you weren't

00:37:58.702 --> 00:37:59.440
already a believer.
 

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.260
He's trying to convince you,
though,

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.780
that what you've got in Jesus
is superior to anything that the

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.610
Jews could give you when it
comes to this liturgy,

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:08.880
leitourgia.
 

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.780
Hebrews 8:7,
he says, how do you know it's

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.289
superior?
 

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:13.641
"For if that first
covenant had been flawless there

00:38:13.641 --> 00:38:16.079
would have been no need to look
for a second one."

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:17.699
That's very interesting.
 

00:38:17.699 --> 00:38:21.724
Basically he's saying,
because Christianity exists,

00:38:21.724 --> 00:38:26.150
that proves it's superior to
Judaism, because otherwise,

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.289
God wouldn't have brought it
about.

00:38:29.289 --> 00:38:32.739
So the very existence of the
second liturgy,

00:38:32.739 --> 00:38:34.469
he says, the second service,
that is the service--

00:38:34.469 --> 00:38:36.630
the priesthood initiated by
Christ,

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.159
the very existence is used to
prove,

00:38:39.159 --> 00:38:41.820
for this writer,
that it's superior to what it

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.590
supplanted.
 

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:46.362
The main way he proves this
point is proofs from scripture,

00:38:46.362 --> 00:38:49.679
and so we're going to look at a
few more of that.

00:38:49.679 --> 00:38:52.806
All the way through here he's
quoting texts that are from the

00:38:52.806 --> 00:38:53.590
Hebrew Bible.
 

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.429
He's actually is quoting them
from the Greek Bible,

00:38:55.429 --> 00:38:56.679
he probably doesn't read
Hebrew;

00:38:56.679 --> 00:38:59.751
he's quoting them from Greek
translations of Hebrew

00:38:59.751 --> 00:39:00.489
scripture.
 

00:39:00.489 --> 00:39:03.280
Most of them don't talk about
the Temple.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.467
You might be reading like when
he talks about the high

00:39:05.467 --> 00:39:07.860
priesthood and the way these
structures were--he even talks

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.809
about the building.
 

00:39:08.809 --> 00:39:10.599
He's not talking about the
Temple in Jerusalem.

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:13.762
He's talking about the
tabernacle, the big tent that is

00:39:13.762 --> 00:39:16.429
described in Exodus,
because that's what the people

00:39:16.429 --> 00:39:19.202
of Israel are using when they're
going through the desert before

00:39:19.202 --> 00:39:20.610
they enter the promised land.
 

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.753
They've constructed it
according to Mosaic

00:39:22.753 --> 00:39:25.416
instructions,
given to Moses by God,

00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:28.570
exactly how this big tent will
look,

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.469
what materials it will have,
what decorations it will have,

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:33.659
its structure in different
compartments.

00:39:33.659 --> 00:39:37.106
And that's where they believed
God, Yahweh, was living in the

00:39:37.106 --> 00:39:40.150
camp with them as they wandered
through the desert.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:43.420
This writer reads the
descriptions of the tabernacle

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.887
given in Exodus,
and he reads the descriptions

00:39:45.887 --> 00:39:47.603
of the priesthood,
what they're supposed to wear,

00:39:47.603 --> 00:39:49.389
what they're supposed to do;
sacrifices.

00:39:49.389 --> 00:39:52.592
He says, the real meaning of
all that stuff is not at all the

00:39:52.592 --> 00:39:55.369
ancient Israelites wandering
around in the desert;

00:39:55.369 --> 00:39:59.538
it's talking about us as the
new house of God,

00:39:59.538 --> 00:40:02.409
as the new tabernacle of God.
 

00:40:02.409 --> 00:40:04.739
It's talking about Christ's
priesthood as the new

00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:05.369
priesthood.
 

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:10.384
So everything in Exodus he just
reads through the lens of Christ

00:40:10.384 --> 00:40:11.179
himself.
 

00:40:11.179 --> 00:40:15.231
Christ becomes this lens that
all of ancient scripture then

00:40:15.231 --> 00:40:16.768
can be read through.
 

00:40:16.768 --> 00:40:21.023
What God says to somebody--now
notice the author of scripture

00:40:21.023 --> 00:40:23.646
is not, in Hebrews,
Moses necessarily,

00:40:23.646 --> 00:40:27.119
although he would believe Moses
did write it.

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:31.353
He takes the main author of
scripture to be God or the Holy

00:40:31.353 --> 00:40:32.010
Spirit.
 

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:37.934
Well it can even refer to
Christ in 11:26,

00:40:37.934 --> 00:40:43.860
Christ can be the speaker in
scripture.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.989
God, or the Holy Spirit,
or Christ, are the actual

00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:49.862
authors of this text,
even though it had human

00:40:49.862 --> 00:40:50.630
authors.
 

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:53.739
This is one way where he's
already showing a very different

00:40:53.739 --> 00:40:55.349
world from our modern world.
 

00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:58.916
He's not too concerned about
what the human author thought or

00:40:58.916 --> 00:41:00.880
what the human author intended.
 

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.224
He believes that God is the
author of this text,

00:41:03.224 --> 00:41:06.070
and so you can figure out God's
mind from reading the text

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:06.619
itself.
 

00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:10.246
God is the author of the text,
the centrality of Christ as key

00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:12.150
for scriptural interpretation.
 

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.400
And it's from the very
beginning.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.956
He said it in the
beginning--remember in the

00:41:16.956 --> 00:41:19.692
thesis, we've learned this now
through the Son,

00:41:19.692 --> 00:41:23.260
not through the prophets--not
just through the prophets.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.869
Let's look at one particular
passage,

00:41:24.869 --> 00:41:27.500
and we'll talk about this
briefly and then I'm going to

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.987
stop,
and if I need to come back to

00:41:28.987 --> 00:41:31.297
this at the beginning of next
lecture I will because there's a

00:41:31.297 --> 00:41:32.659
few other things I want to
cover.

00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:35.090
Look at chapter seven;
this is where he talks about

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:36.030
this Melchizedek figure.
 

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.904
This King Melchizedek of Salem,
priest of the Most High God,

00:41:44.904 --> 00:41:48.927
met Abraham as he was returning
from defeating the kings and

00:41:48.927 --> 00:41:50.018
blessed him.
 

00:41:50.018 --> 00:41:52.880
And to him Abraham apportioned
one-tenth of everything.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.789
The basic story is referring
back to a Genesis account.

00:41:56.789 --> 00:42:01.215
Abraham has gone off to
liberate some of his kinsmen who

00:42:01.215 --> 00:42:03.869
have been kidnapped for ransom.
 

00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:06.559
Abraham raises a little army of
his own.

00:42:06.559 --> 00:42:09.159
He goes off,
he defeats these united kings,

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:11.960
and he gets his kinsmen,
he gets his slaves,

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.949
he liberates everybody,
gets the booty,

00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:17.719
the plunder of the war,
and he's traveling back home.

00:42:17.719 --> 00:42:21.557
And he comes to this placed
called Salem,

00:42:21.557 --> 00:42:25.110
which just happens to be
Jerusalem.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.983
Of course Salem means
"peace,"

00:42:26.983 --> 00:42:29.936
shalom,
but this writer is taking it

00:42:29.936 --> 00:42:34.286
that Melchizedek is the King of
Salem and connecting it to

00:42:34.286 --> 00:42:35.280
Jerusalem.
 

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.795
The story is,
Abraham then gives a tithe,

00:42:38.795 --> 00:42:44.159
a tenth of the spoils of war to
Melchizedek as an offering.

00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:46.960
In other words,
Abraham is recognizing

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.139
Melchizedek as being a priest of
Yahweh.

00:42:50.139 --> 00:42:56.449
And so he gives a tithe for the
war.

00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:58.949
To him Abraham apportioned
one-tenth of everything.

00:42:58.949 --> 00:43:01.349
His name, in the first place,
means "king of

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:02.449
righteousness."
 

00:43:02.449 --> 00:43:05.398
Melech means King in
Hebrew, zedek means

00:43:05.398 --> 00:43:06.289
righteousness.
 

00:43:06.289 --> 00:43:09.036
Now as I said he's using Greek
but he must have some kind of

00:43:09.036 --> 00:43:09.550
word key.
 

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.407
He knows enough Hebrew that he
knows how to interpret this

00:43:12.407 --> 00:43:14.112
Hebrew word
"Melchizedek"

00:43:14.112 --> 00:43:16.420
to mean "king of
righteousness."

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.909
He's taking the name as having
a hidden meaning.

00:43:19.909 --> 00:43:22.309
Next he's called the King of
Salem.

00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:24.974
Well shalom means peace,
so that means he's also the

00:43:24.974 --> 00:43:25.710
king of peace.
 

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:29.059
He takes this,
again, "without father,

00:43:29.059 --> 00:43:31.719
without mother,
without geneaology,

00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:34.552
having neither beginning of
days nor end of life,"

00:43:34.552 --> 00:43:35.760
why does he say that?
 

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.614
Well Melchizedek comes up in
the text of Genesis without us

00:43:38.614 --> 00:43:40.289
knowing anything else about him.
 

00:43:40.289 --> 00:43:42.927
You know how in Genesis and the
other parts of the Hebrew Bible

00:43:42.927 --> 00:43:45.152
it'll say,
so and so begat so and so begat

00:43:45.152 --> 00:43:46.853
so and so,
it tells you everybody's

00:43:46.853 --> 00:43:47.250
lineage.
 

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.114
It tells you who is everybody's
father, even their names,

00:43:51.114 --> 00:43:54.773
son of so and so is a reference
their father and their

00:43:54.773 --> 00:43:55.739
ancestors.
 

00:43:55.739 --> 00:43:58.485
He noticed Melchizedek just
comes out of the text out of

00:43:58.485 --> 00:44:01.681
nowhere, and so he takes that as
a sign that Melchizedek actually

00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:03.079
had no father or mother.
 

00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:06.699
He sprang out autochthonous,
just all on his own.

00:44:06.699 --> 00:44:09.800
He has no descendants because
they're mentioned in the text.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.615
Well who else is the king of
righteousness,

00:44:12.615 --> 00:44:16.639
who else is the king of peace,
who else does not have a human

00:44:16.639 --> 00:44:19.860
father and a human father in any
normal way?

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.429
Who else has no genealogy?
 

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:24.289
Who else has no end of days or
end of life?

00:44:24.289 --> 00:44:25.960
Well Jesus!
 

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.016
So Melchizedek is simply a
foreshadowing,

00:44:30.016 --> 00:44:32.349
he's a sign of Jesus.
 

00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:35.000
See how great he is!
 

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.440
Even Abraham the patriarch gave
him a tenth of the spoils.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.317
And those descendants of Levi
who received the priestly office

00:44:40.317 --> 00:44:43.429
had a commandment in the law to
collect tithes from the people,

00:44:43.429 --> 00:44:45.927
that is from their kindred,
though these descended from

00:44:45.927 --> 00:44:46.389
Abraham.
 

00:44:46.389 --> 00:44:49.041
But this man who does not
belong to their ancestry

00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:51.260
[Melchizedek wasn't a Jew,
he's saying;

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:54.072
he was not part of that lineage
of Abraham obviously]

00:44:54.072 --> 00:44:57.373
collected tithes from Abraham
and blessed him who had received

00:44:57.373 --> 00:44:58.239
the promise.
 

00:44:58.239 --> 00:45:00.880
It is beyond dispute that the
inferior is blessed by the

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.409
superior.
 

00:45:01.409 --> 00:45:03.844
In the one case tithes are
received by those who are

00:45:03.844 --> 00:45:06.280
mortal, in the other,
by one of whom it is testified

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.139
that he lives.
 

00:45:07.139 --> 00:45:10.755
One might even say that Levi
himself [that is the father of

00:45:10.755 --> 00:45:13.126
the Jewish priests who received
tithes]

00:45:13.126 --> 00:45:17.054
paid tithes through Abraham for
he was still in the loins of his

00:45:17.054 --> 00:45:19.550
ancestor when Melchizedek met
him.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.909
Now let me explain what's going
on here.

00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:25.782
This one ties in a little bit
of ancient genetic theory,

00:45:25.782 --> 00:45:27.119
a little biology.
 

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:33.059
According to ancient ideas,
inside the body of every man

00:45:33.059 --> 00:45:37.920
are not just little sperm
swimming around,

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.018
but each of those little things
is a homunculus,

00:45:42.018 --> 00:45:44.893
a little person,
a little, teeny,

00:45:44.893 --> 00:45:46.150
tiny person.
 

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:56.654
In the body of Abraham were
millions of little,

00:45:56.654 --> 00:46:01.449
teeny, tiny people.
 

00:46:01.449 --> 00:46:05.402
The ancient gynecological
theory was, inside of every man,

00:46:05.402 --> 00:46:09.422
at least, was actually every
one of his descendants that he

00:46:09.422 --> 00:46:10.809
would ever have.
 

00:46:10.809 --> 00:46:13.532
His sons, his daughters,
his grandchildren,

00:46:13.532 --> 00:46:16.710
his great grandchildren,
any of their descendants,

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.980
they all exist inside the body.
 

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.465
Abraham carried,
within his own body,

00:46:21.465 --> 00:46:24.505
all these tiny,
tiny, tiny, tiny little Jews,

00:46:24.505 --> 00:46:27.199
they would all come out
eventually.

00:46:27.199 --> 00:46:32.260
Now Levi, who's the head high
priest,

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.615
who then--the first priest all
Levi's descendants out of Levi's

00:46:35.615 --> 00:46:38.275
body,
they were in Levi's body even

00:46:38.275 --> 00:46:41.730
when Levi's body was inside
Abraham's body,

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:45.817
so even the Levite priests of
the Jews were all sacrificing to

00:46:45.817 --> 00:46:49.768
Melchizedek when Abraham was
sacrificing to Melchizedek,

00:46:49.768 --> 00:46:52.005
because they're all in
Abraham's body when Abraham

00:46:52.005 --> 00:46:54.202
sacrifices to Melchizedek,
or gives his tithes to

00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:54.719
Melchizedek.
 

00:46:54.719 --> 00:46:57.539
Notice what this is,
the entire Jewish people,

00:46:57.539 --> 00:46:59.779
all the Israelites,
whoever existed then and

00:46:59.779 --> 00:47:02.695
whoever exists were all inside
Abraham's body so they all

00:47:02.695 --> 00:47:04.050
tithed to Melchizedek.
 

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.190
Melchizedek wasn't a Jew.
 

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:10.362
This proves--then he says
notice how--Melchizedek also

00:47:10.362 --> 00:47:11.780
blesses Abraham.
 

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.989
Well if you're blessed by one,
you're not blessed by someone

00:47:14.989 --> 00:47:19.289
who is inferior to you;
you're blessed by the bishop.

00:47:19.289 --> 00:47:21.431
What proves the bishop's
superiority is his blessing you

00:47:21.431 --> 00:47:23.378
in the first place,
so that proves that Melchizedek

00:47:23.378 --> 00:47:24.469
was superior to Abraham.
 

00:47:24.469 --> 00:47:27.739
Then when Abraham gave tithes
to Melchizedek,

00:47:27.739 --> 00:47:30.554
and Levi in Abraham's body was
therefore tithing to

00:47:30.554 --> 00:47:33.177
Melchizedek,
this proves that the Jewish

00:47:33.177 --> 00:47:37.128
priesthood itself recognizes the
superiority of Melchizedek's

00:47:37.128 --> 00:47:42.000
priesthood;
wonderful little proof from

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.610
scripture.
 

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:49.670
Next time I'll start my lecture
by finishing up how the letter

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.018
of Hebrews ends,
and then we'll set that aside

00:47:53.018 --> 00:47:55.335
as an example of ancient
scriptural exegesis by

00:47:55.335 --> 00:47:56.039
Christians.
 

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:59.663
And then I want you to read the
chapter online because that will

00:47:59.663 --> 00:48:03.228
talk about then later Christian
exegesis scripture up until the

00:48:03.228 --> 00:48:04.380
Medieval period.

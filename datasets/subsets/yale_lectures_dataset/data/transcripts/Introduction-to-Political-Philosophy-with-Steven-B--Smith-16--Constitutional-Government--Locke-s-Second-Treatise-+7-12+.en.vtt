00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.968
Professor Steven Smith:
Today we want to begin with Mr.

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:08.029
Locke, Part II.
And I said, at the end of class

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.033
last time, I want to speak a
little bit about Locke and let's

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.770
just call it the spirit of
capitalism.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.223
And then I want to move into
the issue of government by

00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:26.720
consent, along with the idea of
natural law,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.300
perhaps one of Locke's clearly
central, perhaps most

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.880
significant contribution to
political philosophy,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.195
the Doctrine of Consent.
And various problems I wanted

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:45.012
to examine with you today,
associated with consent and

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:48.830
what it means to consent to
government.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.146
But the first five chapters of
the Second Treatise,

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:57.236
if you take them as a unit,
and I think they should be,

00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:00.659
they tell us a story.
Locke presents us,

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.060
so to speak,
with a kind of philosophical

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.989
anthropology that takes us
through the state of nature,

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:12.895
the state of war,
the creation of private

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:15.726
property.
And in the fifth chapter

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:18.652
particularly,
Locke begins as I mentioned

00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:21.344
last time with,
you might say,

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:27.040
with the original condition of
nature which forms a kind of

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.735
primitive communism to the
creation of property through the

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:37.940
labor of one's body and the work
of one's hands.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.408
And by the end of the fifth
chapter, we have the creation of

00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:47.893
really a kind of full-scale,
sophisticated market economy

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:51.680
replete with various
inequalities,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.993
perhaps even some large-scale
inequalities of wealth and

00:01:57.993 --> 00:02:01.420
property,
all within the state of nature.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.861
How did this occur and most
importantly for Locke,

00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:10.473
what makes this legitimate?
What legitimizes this

00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:15.195
transition, so to speak,
from the original state of

00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:20.862
nature governed by nothing more
than the law of nature to the

00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:24.640
emergence of property and in a
way,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.770
a kind of market economy?
In many ways,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.132
what Locke is doing in the
first five chapters of the

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:37.410
Second Treatise is
re-telling or maybe better

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.527
re-writing the account of human
beginnings that had originally

00:02:42.527 --> 00:02:47.707
belonged to scripture.
He tells the story of how human

00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:53.113
beings finding themselves in a
condition of nature with no one

00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:58.520
or no authority to adjudicate
their disputes and governed only

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.514
by a natural law,
how they are,

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.807
nevertheless,
able to create and enjoy the

00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:09.546
use of property created and
acquired through their labor and

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:12.274
work.
Man, he tells us in these

00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:15.968
opening chapters,
is a property-acquiring animal,

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:20.029
the acquisitive animal,
even in the state of nature

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:24.834
where there is again nothing but
the natural law to govern human

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:28.419
associations and relations with
one another.

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.098
But the problem with the state
of nature for Locke and as to

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:36.270
some degree it was for Hobbes as
well,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.572
is its instability,
with no civil authority to

00:03:40.572 --> 00:03:44.397
umpire disputes,
especially disputes over

00:03:44.397 --> 00:03:48.727
property.
The peaceful enjoyment and the

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:54.695
further acquisition of property,
the fruits of one's labor,

00:03:54.695 --> 00:04:00.150
are continually threatened by
war and by conflict.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.649
How can we ever be secure in
our person or property with no

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:10.770
enforcement agency to resolve
breaches of the peace,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.837
where everybody is,
so to speak,

00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:17.040
again, the judge and jury and
executioner of the natural law?

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.666
The need for government arises
out of the real need to resolve

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:25.080
conflicts or disputes over
property rights.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.351
In many respects,
this sounds like a very

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:37.343
familiar idea that government
exists for the sake of the

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:42.125
protection of property rights.
It's sort of kind of a cardinal

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:45.569
doctrine of what I suppose we
would call today libertarianism,

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.342
the philosophy of
libertarianism,

00:04:49.342 --> 00:04:54.529
so important in a lot of
American thought.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.579
Locke is, in many ways,
the first writer of my

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:03.350
familiarity who claims
that--these are his words--"the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.750
great and chief end of man's
uniting into commonwealth is the

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.071
protection of their property."
No one prior to Locke,

00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:19.370
at least to my knowledge,
I think, had ever said in quite

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.331
such a bold and straightforward
way that the purpose of politics

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:29.399
was the protection of property
rights.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:33.500
And by property,
Locke doesn't mean simply

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.899
objects around us that we have
turned into property;

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:41.256
but property is rooted,
he tells us,

00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:44.690
first and foremost in our
persons, in our bodies.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.141
We all begin the life with a
certain rudimentary property if

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:52.217
only in ourselves.
Property, for him,

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:57.094
implies more than simply real
estate, but everything that

00:05:57.094 --> 00:06:01.709
encompasses our lives,
liberties, and possessions.

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:05.581
These are all property in the
original, and in many ways,

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:09.590
most revealing sense of the
term "property," that is to say

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.250
things proper to us.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.047
But Locke continually
emphasizes to us the uncertainty

00:06:30.047 --> 00:06:33.959
of the state of nature because
"life there,"

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:38.988
he says, "is full of fears and
continual dangers that lead us

00:06:38.988 --> 00:06:42.632
to civil association."
But think, in a way,

00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:47.611
how different Locke's account
of the transition from the state

00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:51.529
of nature to the civil state is
from Hobbes'.

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.956
In many ways,
again, as I said,

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:56.705
Locke tries to modify,
domesticate,

00:06:56.705 --> 00:06:59.860
ameliorate Hobbes' harsh
teachings.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.814
Hobbes had emphasized the
absolute fearfulness of the

00:07:04.814 --> 00:07:08.339
state of nature.
The state of nature was,

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:11.959
for Hobbes, a kind of state of
existential dread,

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:16.566
absolute fearfulness.
For Locke, however,

00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:25.250
it is a condition continually
beset by unease and anxiety;

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.420
to use the word he often uses,
inconveniences.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.542
The state of nature is one that
consists of continual

00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:36.385
inconveniences.
It is our unease,

00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:41.048
our restlessness that is not
only a spur to our labor,

00:07:41.048 --> 00:07:46.502
but is rather the cause of our
insecurities that we have in the

00:07:46.502 --> 00:07:49.777
state of nature.
What is it about Locke,

00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:53.171
what is it about his account?
I don't mean what is it about

00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:55.864
him in some psychological,
personal, or biographical

00:07:55.864 --> 00:07:59.093
sense,
but what is it in his writing

00:07:59.093 --> 00:08:03.459
that leads him to emphasize the
restlessness,

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:13.102
uneasiness, and you might say
perpetually anxious character of

00:08:13.102 --> 00:08:19.110
human beings in the state of
nature?

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:25.668
Do we ever hear Plato or
Aristotle discussing the fearful

00:08:25.668 --> 00:08:32.110
or anxious or restless character
of human psychology?

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:37.504
I think not.
Was this simply a function of

00:08:37.504 --> 00:08:43.146
Locke's nervous disposition?
Was the fact that he was simply

00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:48.629
prone to reticence and a kind of
fearfulness in the same way that

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:52.829
Hobbes himself said?
Or does Locke's emphasis on the

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:56.999
uneasiness of our condition in
the natural condition really

00:08:56.999 --> 00:09:00.019
represent the qualities of a new
class,

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:07.287
the new commercial classes as
it were seeking to establish

00:09:07.287 --> 00:09:12.680
their legitimacy?
Locke's Second Treatise

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.523
in many respects is a work of
middle class or as the Marxist

00:09:18.523 --> 00:09:22.385
would like to say,
perhaps the bourgeois

00:09:22.385 --> 00:09:25.220
ascendancy.
When Locke writes,

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.112
as he does, that the world is
intended for the use of the

00:09:29.112 --> 00:09:33.559
industrious and the rational,
who was he talking about there?

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:37.129
Who are the industrious and the
rational?

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:42.573
He is speaking about a new
middle class ethos whose

00:09:42.573 --> 00:09:47.730
title to rule rests not on
heredity or on tradition;

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.130
he is not referring to a
customary ruling class,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.819
a class whose title to rule
comes from its claims to

00:09:54.819 --> 00:09:58.456
nobility.
But he's referring to people

00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:04.235
whose title to rule or potential
title to rule rests on their

00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:09.340
capacities for hard work,
thrift, and opportunity.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.159
As a former student of mine who
took this class once said,

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:18.726
Locke's Second Treatise
could well be called the

00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:20.840
Capitalist Manifesto,

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:30.080
or the Anti-Communist Manifesto
maybe, one could put it.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:37.690
But is Lockeanism simply
Machiavelli with a human face?

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:43.591
Put it that way.
Isn't the rule of The

00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:50.549
Prince in Machiavelli the
rule of a new leader,

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:57.108
a new authority in some sense
who operates outside the

00:10:57.108 --> 00:11:01.809
parameters of traditional
authority?

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:06.833
Isn't Lockeanism like
Machiavelli in some way the

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:12.904
ethic of the self-made man with
all of the insecurities and

00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:18.019
anxieties,
restlessness that being

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:23.880
self-made represents?
Does Lockeanism represent in

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.282
some ways the tranquilization of
Machiavelli, turning

00:11:28.282 --> 00:11:31.500
Machiavelli's fierce warlike
ethic,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.686
the ethic of conquest and
domination to,

00:11:35.686 --> 00:11:40.409
in fact, the ethic of work and
as it were,

00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:47.809
the conquest and domination of
nature through labor and our

00:11:47.809 --> 00:11:50.258
hard work?
Is this, again,

00:11:50.258 --> 00:11:52.889
simply Machiavellianism with a
human face?

00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:55.805
But in any way,
I think, or what I want to

00:11:55.805 --> 00:11:59.290
suggest is that Locke's
political philosophy gives

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.700
expression to what the great
German sociologist Max Weber,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.529
you know him, yes, Weber?
You read him in Intro

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:10.600
Sociology, no?
Okay, well, you will.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.489
Weber, his famous book called
The Protestant Ethic and the

00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:20.611
Spirit of Capitalism,
1904, great work,

00:12:20.611 --> 00:12:23.663
classic work.
In that work,

00:12:23.663 --> 00:12:28.878
Weber argued that the
capitalist ethic made a high

00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:33.821
duty, a moral duty,
turned it into a moral calling,

00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:37.262
a religious calling,
the duty of limitless

00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:40.620
accumulation of capital and this
was,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.813
in Weber's terms,
the outgrowth of the Puritan

00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:47.716
and Calvinist movements of the
sixteenth and seventeenth

00:12:47.716 --> 00:12:50.981
centuries.
For Weber it was the Protestant

00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:55.305
reformation that had taken root
in the countries of Northern

00:12:55.305 --> 00:12:59.628
Europe and particularly where
the roots of this capitalistic

00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:04.318
ethos first developed and
again adopted a wholly new moral

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:07.470
attitude to such things as
property,

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.690
property acquisition and
moneymaking.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.730
Previously, these things had
been deemed to be morally

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.466
dubious, shunted aside,
there's something shameful

00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:22.129
about this.
You can certainly see this in

00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:26.561
the classical writings,
political philosophy that we

00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:29.401
did.
For these early moderns,

00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:34.886
capital accumulation became a
kind of high calling and moral

00:13:34.886 --> 00:13:37.465
duty.
God gave the world to the

00:13:37.465 --> 00:13:40.549
rational and the industrious,
not, he says,

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:43.340
to the quarrelsome and
contentious;

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.317
not, that is,
to those prideful aristocrats

00:13:48.317 --> 00:13:54.597
who seek to struggle for
domination and power over one

00:13:54.597 --> 00:13:58.508
another.
What Locke brings into being

00:13:58.508 --> 00:14:03.396
is, again, a wholly new and
revolutionary moral attitude

00:14:03.396 --> 00:14:08.817
towards property and property
acquisition that again finds its

00:14:08.817 --> 00:14:12.346
expression,
great expression a century

00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:15.498
later with Adam Smith.
And, of course,

00:14:15.498 --> 00:14:20.740
from Adam Smith we have the
whole world of modern economics.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.626
So, how many of you are
potential economics majors in

00:14:24.626 --> 00:14:28.169
here?
I bet more than one.

00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:31.695
Without John Locke,
there would be no modern

00:14:31.695 --> 00:14:36.039
discipline called economics
because he was the one,

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:39.854
again, a century before Smith
and the rise of the school of

00:14:39.854 --> 00:14:43.888
political economy,
who made the first and decisive

00:14:43.888 --> 00:14:46.607
move which was to,
in many ways,

00:14:46.607 --> 00:14:51.080
make respectable and even more
than respectable,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:57.475
turn into a high moral calling
and dignity the acquisition of

00:14:57.475 --> 00:15:03.442
property and turn government,
turn politics into a tool for

00:15:03.442 --> 00:15:07.850
the protection of property and
property rights.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.028
That is the significance in
many ways of what Locke has

00:15:12.028 --> 00:15:13.922
done.
I want to talk,

00:15:13.922 --> 00:15:19.063
probably not today but next
Monday, on some of the in many

00:15:19.063 --> 00:15:24.294
ways the pros and cons of this
immense moral transformation

00:15:24.294 --> 00:15:29.886
regarding property and economics
that Locke has helped to bring

00:15:29.886 --> 00:15:31.510
into being.

00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:38.250
But for the rest of today,
what I want to focus on is

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.555
Locke's idea of consent,
the idea that the origin of all

00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:47.343
government, or at least all
legitimate government is said to

00:15:47.343 --> 00:15:51.197
derive from consent,
the consent of the governed,

00:15:51.197 --> 00:15:55.385
an idea that was implicit in
some respects in Hobbes' theory

00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:58.649
of the covenant that creates the
sovereign,

00:15:58.649 --> 00:16:02.862
to which Locke gives,
in many ways,

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:08.783
much greater pride of place.
In chapter 8 of the Second

00:16:08.783 --> 00:16:11.366
Treatise,
Locke gives us there,

00:16:11.366 --> 00:16:15.848
he provides us with a kind of
hypothetical reconstruction of

00:16:15.848 --> 00:16:19.269
the origin of society,
of all societies.

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.906
He writes in section 95,
"The only way whereby anyone

00:16:22.906 --> 00:16:27.241
divests himself of his natural
liberty and puts on the bonds of

00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:30.694
civil society,
is by agreeing with all others

00:16:30.694 --> 00:16:34.790
to join and unite in a community
for their comfortable,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.332
safe, and peaceful living."
Locke tells us there is

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:43.556
something about the legitimate
ends of society,

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:47.873
the ends that civil society
serves, comfortable,

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:53.131
safe, and peaceful living.
And he goes on to affirm that

00:16:53.131 --> 00:16:58.286
whenever a sufficient number of
people have consented to make a

00:16:58.286 --> 00:17:01.644
single community,
and I quote him again,

00:17:01.644 --> 00:17:06.035
"they are thereby presently
incorporated and make one body

00:17:06.035 --> 00:17:10.728
politic,"
they make one body politic,

00:17:10.728 --> 00:17:18.685
"wherein the majority have a
right to act and conclude for

00:17:18.685 --> 00:17:22.679
the rest."
That short statement,

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:28.179
section 95 of chapter 8,
seems to make maybe the first

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:32.330
and most powerful case for
democracy.

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:41.571
On the basis of that statement,
a famous Yale professor of at

00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:45.160
least a couple of generations
ago,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:51.470
wrote an extremely important
book that made John Locke into a

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:56.033
majority rule Democrat.
He said in that book that

00:17:56.033 --> 00:18:00.441
Locke's philosophy provides the
faith of the majority rule

00:18:00.441 --> 00:18:03.833
Democrat,
largely focusing on sections

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:08.760
95,96 as sort of the key to
Locke's political teaching in

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.991
the Second Treatise.
Does anybody know the name of

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:15.460
that man who wrote that book,
by any chance?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.819
Famous Yale Political
Scientist, back a while ago.

00:18:19.819 --> 00:18:23.980
Nobody remembers Willmoore
Kendall's book on Locke?

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.160
You know it,
yes, you were shaking your

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.270
head.
No, you don't?

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.370
Okay, whatever.
It's not important.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.509
Not important.
I just mention it in passing.

00:18:35.509 --> 00:18:40.321
But consider the following
sentence, again,

00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:44.789
also that seems to add to this
claim.

00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:49.128
"For when any number of men by
the consent of every individual

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.645
make a community,
they have thereby made that

00:18:52.645 --> 00:18:57.699
community one body with a power
to act as one body which is only

00:18:57.699 --> 00:19:01.710
by the will and determination of
the majority."

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.959
What are we to make of this
assertion and in many ways,

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:11.042
continued assertion,
that in any community,

00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:16.979
we are ruled by the majority?
To be sure, that idea would

00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:21.226
have come as an immense
surprise, no doubt,

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:27.393
to the King of England to learn
that his rule was justified by

00:19:27.393 --> 00:19:33.295
the consent of the governed,
or if you had done something

00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:38.884
like crossed the English Channel
and go to the France of Louis

00:19:38.884 --> 00:19:42.899
XIV of this period,
Louis XIV who famously said

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:47.489
L'État c'est moi, "I am
the state," no doubt would have

00:19:47.489 --> 00:19:52.005
been very surprised and probably
found laughable the idea that

00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:56.299
his legitimacy came from the
consent of his subjects.

00:19:56.299 --> 00:20:00.618
Who had ever thought such a
thing, that government derives

00:20:00.618 --> 00:20:03.269
from the consent of the
majority?

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:08.364
Is Locke, in saying that,
denying the legitimacy of all

00:20:08.364 --> 00:20:14.213
government, all governments that
do not derive from the consent

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:18.867
of the majority?
Is he, on the basis of this,

00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:22.819
truly a kind of majority rule
Democrat?

00:20:22.819 --> 00:20:25.118
Does he undercut,
for example,

00:20:25.118 --> 00:20:29.240
something like Aristotle's
argument, who had seen any

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.710
number of forms of government as
equally legitimate in many ways,

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.059
so long as they are moderate
and ruled by law?

00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:41.562
Or is Locke saying,
again, that there is only one

00:20:41.562 --> 00:20:45.138
form of government,
one, again, legitimate or just

00:20:45.138 --> 00:20:48.859
form of government,
government by the majority?

00:20:48.859 --> 00:20:51.480
That's what he appears here to
be saying.

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:59.900
I mention the sense appears,
Locke is a slippery fish.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:07.920
He's a slippery writer.
He has a tendency to take back

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:13.560
with one hand what he gives with
the other, doesn't he?

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:23.092
The agreement to make one
community, as he calls it

00:21:23.092 --> 00:21:29.552
however, is not the same thing
exactly as establishing a form

00:21:29.552 --> 00:21:32.467
of government.
In many ways,

00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:36.976
choosing to have a government,
which is what Locke is talking

00:21:36.976 --> 00:21:41.411
about here in these relevant
sections--95 and 96 and so on--

00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:45.319
choosing to have a government to
be one people,

00:21:45.319 --> 00:21:49.486
so to speak,
is in many ways an act prior to

00:21:49.486 --> 00:21:55.009
electing any particular form of
government to rule you.

00:21:55.009 --> 00:21:58.613
The Second Treatise, in
some way, specifies only that

00:21:58.613 --> 00:22:02.155
governments derive their just
power from the consent of the

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:05.571
governed.
It does not seem to say very

00:22:05.571 --> 00:22:11.189
explicitly about what form of
government people might wish to

00:22:11.189 --> 00:22:13.379
consent to.
In many ways,

00:22:13.379 --> 00:22:16.355
the Second Treatise,
one wants to say,

00:22:16.355 --> 00:22:19.670
is even rather neutral to forms
of government.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.105
The only form of government
that seems to be absolutely

00:22:23.105 --> 00:22:27.240
ruled out on Locke's account is
some kind of absolute monarchy.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.180
We cannot cede our rights
entirely to another individual.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:37.106
But he seems to be relatively
open to whatever it is people

00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:41.421
may wish to consent to.
The act of consent alone does

00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:45.950
not create a government.
It is merely an act to form a

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.670
society.
In many ways,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.481
he accepts Pope's famous
dictum, Alexander Pope's famous

00:22:51.481 --> 00:22:55.430
dictum: "...for forms of
government let fools contest,

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.450
whate're is best administered
is best."

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.064
In other words,
you have the best thing that

00:23:01.064 --> 00:23:04.650
administers government that
protects your rights to property

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.575
and what form it is,
whether it's monarchic,

00:23:08.575 --> 00:23:12.434
aristocratic,
republican or whatever,

00:23:12.434 --> 00:23:15.983
is not so important.
What is important,

00:23:15.983 --> 00:23:19.114
and for Locke about the only
thing that is important,

00:23:19.114 --> 00:23:22.547
is that that form of government
receive the consent of the

00:23:22.547 --> 00:23:24.345
governed.
And, of course,

00:23:24.345 --> 00:23:27.849
people don't necessarily have
to consent to democracy.

00:23:27.849 --> 00:23:32.651
If Locke is democratic in that
way, it is only because he's

00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:37.452
democratic in a sense that
government derives the authority

00:23:37.452 --> 00:23:41.632
from consent.
It does not necessarily have to

00:23:41.632 --> 00:23:45.299
be democratical in form in that
respect.

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:49.243
But it is this idea of
consent--and you will no doubt

00:23:49.243 --> 00:23:53.187
talk about this in your
sections-- it is this idea of

00:23:53.187 --> 00:23:57.510
government as being by consent
that has so much insinuated

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:02.137
itself-- I'm not sure that's the
right word -- but has so much

00:24:02.137 --> 00:24:05.929
formed in many ways the
cornerstone of the American

00:24:05.929 --> 00:24:09.569
regime and American political
thought,

00:24:09.569 --> 00:24:13.252
in many ways,
even more, I would suggest,

00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:18.039
than his doctrine of property
and property rights.

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:25.213
Locke's Doctrine of Consent is
what captured the imagination of

00:24:25.213 --> 00:24:30.172
the American founders.
When Jefferson wrote about the

00:24:30.172 --> 00:24:33.738
ends of government,
he said the ends of government

00:24:33.738 --> 00:24:37.158
are to protect life,
liberty, and the pursuit of

00:24:37.158 --> 00:24:40.513
happiness.
He seems to have modified

00:24:40.513 --> 00:24:45.130
Locke's statement about life,
liberty, and estate.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.637
Why did he do that?
We could talk about that and of

00:24:48.637 --> 00:24:52.000
course, what is meant by the
pursuit of happiness certainly

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.599
is intended to entail,
among other things,

00:24:55.599 --> 00:25:01.571
the acquisition of property.
But Jefferson in some ways sort

00:25:01.571 --> 00:25:05.740
of elevates Locke's language,
Lockean language;

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.584
it is not simply focused on
property but the pursuit of

00:25:09.584 --> 00:25:13.784
happiness in many ways however
construed consistent with the

00:25:13.784 --> 00:25:18.317
rights of others.
But it is Locke's language of

00:25:18.317 --> 00:25:24.391
consent that just powers of
governments derive from consent

00:25:24.391 --> 00:25:30.990
that seems to have most inspired
Jefferson and the founders.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:35.524
And through that doctrine it,
of course, had a huge effect on

00:25:35.524 --> 00:25:39.530
America's greatest second
founder, Abraham Lincoln.

00:25:42.609 --> 00:25:45.420
Consider the following passage
from Lincoln.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:50.475
This is Lincoln in 1854 in his
first major speech,

00:25:50.475 --> 00:25:55.853
first most important speech,
sometimes called the Peoria

00:25:55.853 --> 00:25:59.829
Speech, where he was already
debating Stephan A.

00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:03.842
Douglas.
It was for the Senate campaign

00:26:03.842 --> 00:26:08.980
in Illinois, appropriate in our
time of the year,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.963
where they were then arguing,
as they would again for the

00:26:13.963 --> 00:26:18.431
presidential campaign,
argue over slavery and here is

00:26:18.431 --> 00:26:22.085
what Lincoln writes:
"When the white man governs

00:26:22.085 --> 00:26:25.579
himself,
that is self-government;

00:26:25.579 --> 00:26:30.517
but when he governs himself,
and also governs another man,

00:26:30.517 --> 00:26:33.375
that is more than
self-government,

00:26:33.375 --> 00:26:36.579
that is despotism," Lincoln
says.

00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:40.076
"My ancient faith," no doubt
thinking about the

00:26:40.076 --> 00:26:43.420
Declaration and
Jefferson's ideals,

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:48.319
"My ancient faith teaches me
that there can be no moral right

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:51.750
with one man making a slave of
another."

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.954
"What I do say," Lincoln
continues here,

00:26:54.954 --> 00:26:59.884
"is that no man is good enough
to govern another without that

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:03.357
other's consent."
"This," he concludes,

00:27:03.357 --> 00:27:07.851
"is the leading principle,
the sheet anchor of American

00:27:07.851 --> 00:27:11.082
republicanism."
So there is Abraham Lincoln

00:27:11.082 --> 00:27:14.932
referring to the Doctrine of
Consent by which he says that no

00:27:14.932 --> 00:27:18.525
man is good enough to govern
another without that other's

00:27:18.525 --> 00:27:21.324
consent,
calling this the leading

00:27:21.324 --> 00:27:25.990
principle or the sheet anchor of
American republicanism.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:30.071
That statement,
as I was suggesting a moment

00:27:30.071 --> 00:27:35.386
ago, is part of his debate with
Douglas over the issue of

00:27:35.386 --> 00:27:38.464
slavery and it,
in many ways,

00:27:38.464 --> 00:27:42.680
cut to the core of the meaning
of consent.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.155
Douglas also,
in some respects,

00:27:46.155 --> 00:27:52.180
tried to derive his views from
an idea of consent.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.792
What Douglas said was that,
regarding slavery,

00:27:55.792 --> 00:28:00.126
he said he didn't care,
it was a matter of indifference

00:28:00.126 --> 00:28:03.170
to him,
whether people of a particular

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:07.130
state or a territory wanted
slavery or didn't want it.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.849
Whatever they wanted,
that is to say whatever the

00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:14.569
majority consented to,
was all right with him.

00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:20.269
He might prefer it not to be
but again, it was what people

00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:24.470
consented to,
what the majority wanted that

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:29.034
would decide the matter.
Lincoln, however,

00:28:29.034 --> 00:28:35.262
had said that the Doctrine of
Consent is not simply a kind of

00:28:35.262 --> 00:28:39.042
blank check,
that the Doctrine of Consent

00:28:39.042 --> 00:28:43.646
still implied a set of moral
limits or restraints on what a

00:28:43.646 --> 00:28:48.183
people might consent to.
Consent was inconsistent with

00:28:48.183 --> 00:28:50.741
slavery, he said,
because again,

00:28:50.741 --> 00:28:55.940
no one can rule another without
that other person's consent.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.247
And in many ways that crucial
debate, so fundamental to

00:29:00.247 --> 00:29:05.829
American history and politics,
grows out of a kind of internal

00:29:05.829 --> 00:29:10.130
problem within Locke's Doctrine
of Consent,

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:15.158
namely that problem is,
what form of government does it

00:29:15.158 --> 00:29:20.000
make sense for a majority of
people to consent to.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.043
Does government,
in other words,

00:29:22.043 --> 00:29:26.000
by consent mean government by
whatever the majority wants,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.950
could be a kind tyranny of the
majority, whatever they want?

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.862
Or does government by consent
entail, again,

00:29:33.862 --> 00:29:37.789
certain limits and restraints
on what majorities can do?

00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:42.247
What guarantees does Locke
provide, you might ask,

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:47.888
that government by consent will
be informed consent or rational

00:29:47.888 --> 00:29:52.628
consent?
Can people simply consent to

00:29:52.628 --> 00:29:57.319
anything, to be ruled by any
means?

00:29:57.319 --> 00:30:02.014
This is obviously not an idle
or a purely theoretical question

00:30:02.014 --> 00:30:06.170
since popular majorities we know
in the world today,

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:11.527
popular majorities can choose,
on the basis of whim,

00:30:11.527 --> 00:30:16.569
will, or some other kind of
arbitrary passion.

00:30:16.569 --> 00:30:20.542
Unless there seems to be some
set of moral restraints on what

00:30:20.542 --> 00:30:23.390
individuals or majorities can
consent to,

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:28.342
what is to prevent a majority
from acting just as despotically

00:30:28.342 --> 00:30:32.970
or just as arbitrarily as a king
or any absolute power?

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.770
That was the question that
Lincoln was raising in his

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:42.940
argument against Douglas and his
claims about consent.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:49.823
But this question of restraints
or limits on what a people can

00:30:49.823 --> 00:30:56.255
consent to leads to another
question about the Doctrine of

00:30:56.255 --> 00:31:00.310
Consent.
How is consent conferred?

00:31:03.619 --> 00:31:07.217
We are citizens of the oldest
democracy in the world,

00:31:07.217 --> 00:31:10.278
most of us, I guess;
maybe not everybody but most

00:31:10.278 --> 00:31:13.685
people in this room are citizens
of the oldest democracy in the

00:31:13.685 --> 00:31:17.615
world.
Did anyone ask you for your

00:31:17.615 --> 00:31:22.070
consent or me,
considerably older?

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:29.885
Did anyone ask for my consent?
The idea of giving consent to a

00:31:29.885 --> 00:31:33.769
form of government implies
something active,

00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:37.705
an emphatic voice but has
anyone since the first

00:31:37.705 --> 00:31:42.394
generation of founders who
ratified the Constitution ever

00:31:42.394 --> 00:31:47.000
been asked or required to give
their consent to it?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.380
You might ask what is Locke's
answer to this problem and it is

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.330
a problem that he is aware of
and struggles with in that

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.910
important chapter.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:06.428
His answer turns out to be
something quite different from

00:32:06.428 --> 00:32:12.250
our views about citizenship and
who is a citizen and how is the

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:17.039
consent of the citizen conferred
on government.

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:22.288
In section 118 he writes,
"A child is born a subject of

00:32:22.288 --> 00:32:26.450
no country or government."
In other words,

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:31.349
he's saying citizenship is not
conferred by birth;

00:32:31.349 --> 00:32:36.309
just being born in a place does
not make you a citizen of it as

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:40.379
doctrine that we hold.
"Every person," Locke

00:32:40.379 --> 00:32:46.417
continues, "is born free and
equal in many ways in a kind of

00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:52.660
state of nature under the
authority only of their parents.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:58.441
What government that person may
choose to obey is not a matter

00:32:58.441 --> 00:33:02.935
of birth, but of choice."
And again, Locke seems to be

00:33:02.935 --> 00:33:06.943
making some kind of active
principle of choice or decision,

00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:11.089
a principle of citizenship and
the conferring of consent.

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:14.249
And it is only,
he says, that when a child

00:33:14.249 --> 00:33:18.487
reaches what he calls the age of
discretion--18 or 21 or

00:33:18.487 --> 00:33:22.880
something like that--that one is
obligated to choose,

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.173
do some sign or mark of
agreement to accept the

00:33:27.173 --> 00:33:32.097
authority of government.
Locke is not altogether clear

00:33:32.097 --> 00:33:36.230
about how such a sign or a mark
is to be given.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.220
One suspects from what he is
saying, he maybe referring to

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.230
some kind of oath or some kind
of pledge,

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:49.097
or some kind of civil ceremony
where one vows or pledges with

00:33:49.097 --> 00:33:54.279
one's word the acceptance of the
form of the state.

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:57.014
"Nothing can make any man so,"
Locke writes,

00:33:57.014 --> 00:33:59.940
that is to say an actual
citizen of a state.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:05.229
"Nothing can make any man so,
but his actually entering into

00:34:05.229 --> 00:34:09.442
it by positive agreement,
an express promise and

00:34:09.442 --> 00:34:12.760
compact," he says at section
122.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:19.748
By express promise and compact,
"such an express promise or

00:34:19.748 --> 00:34:24.764
agreement leaves one,"
he says, "perpetually and

00:34:24.764 --> 00:34:30.034
indispensably obliged to be and
remain unalterably a subject of

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:31.719
it,"
that is to the state.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:35.808
So once you give your word or
agreement, Locke says,

00:34:35.808 --> 00:34:40.138
you are perpetually and
indispensably obligated to that

00:34:40.138 --> 00:34:42.755
state.
That's how seriously Locke

00:34:42.755 --> 00:34:46.468
takes this idea of consent.
It's something that can only be

00:34:46.468 --> 00:34:48.679
entered into at the age of
discretion.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:52.388
It must be given consciously,
fully, rationally,

00:34:52.388 --> 00:34:56.570
presumably in some kind of
ceremony and once given,

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:01.452
your consent to the form of
government remains,

00:35:01.452 --> 00:35:06.308
as he says, perpetual.
You are bound unalterably,

00:35:06.308 --> 00:35:10.019
as he puts it.
There's no such thing as taking

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:13.374
it back.
It shows you how important

00:35:13.374 --> 00:35:18.907
Locke puts on the word,
the oath, or some kind of civil

00:35:18.907 --> 00:35:23.280
agreement.
One's word is one's bond.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.153
To give voice or consent to
government is not an act to be

00:35:28.153 --> 00:35:32.340
entered into lightly,
he says, or implies but it is a

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:36.708
kind of lifetime commitment and
it also shows us how different

00:35:36.708 --> 00:35:39.860
Locke's view of the citizen is
from ours.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.826
In other words,
it would seem,

00:35:41.826 --> 00:35:46.029
for Locke, the only people who
are full citizens in our country

00:35:46.029 --> 00:35:49.961
would be people who have given
their active consent and the

00:35:49.961 --> 00:35:54.097
only people who have given their
active consent are people who

00:35:54.097 --> 00:35:57.622
have undergone what we
interestingly call a kind of a

00:35:57.622 --> 00:36:03.150
naturalization process.
Is anyone here a naturalized

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:08.510
citizen, as we call it?
Has anyone ever been to a

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.960
naturalization process?
No, nobody?

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:19.953
It's administered by a judge
and you swear allegiance to the

00:36:19.953 --> 00:36:23.413
new country?
You presumably shed your

00:36:23.413 --> 00:36:25.889
obligations to your previous
country.

00:36:25.889 --> 00:36:28.230
You swear your allegiance to
this one.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.566
That seems to be the kind of
thing Locke appears to be

00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:34.210
talking about and it's
interesting that,

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:39.211
again, the only people in our
society, in our country,

00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:44.780
who would be full citizens
would be naturalized citizens.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:51.107
Again, birth alone does not
confer on you citizenship of any

00:36:51.107 --> 00:36:56.156
particular country.
But what does that mean for the

00:36:56.156 --> 00:37:01.480
rest of us, those who have not
given their active consent?

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.738
Locke is aware that not
everyone gives their active

00:37:04.738 --> 00:37:07.173
consent.
That's why he introduces

00:37:07.173 --> 00:37:10.369
another idea for how consent may
be given.

00:37:10.369 --> 00:37:15.090
He talks about what he calls
tacit consent.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:20.173
There are those maybe who have
not sworn allegiance or given a

00:37:20.173 --> 00:37:25.340
civil oath but who nevertheless
can be said to have given their

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.090
tacit consent to the form of
government and its laws.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.760
But how do we give tacit
consent?

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.494
Tacit consent is a strange word
because consent implies

00:37:37.494 --> 00:37:40.826
something active and open,
where tacit,

00:37:40.826 --> 00:37:47.006
think of Locke's taciturnity;
tacit implies something closed

00:37:47.006 --> 00:37:52.590
or concealed.
How is tacit consent given?

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:57.650
That's a problem you can see
Locke working on.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.590
To some degree,
he says, anyone who simply

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.099
enjoys the protection of the
law,

00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:08.987
the security of property and
person under the law can be said

00:38:08.987 --> 00:38:12.519
to have given their tacit
consent.

00:38:12.519 --> 00:38:14.949
They give it,
so to speak,

00:38:14.949 --> 00:38:19.634
ex silentio.
Even their silence confers

00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:22.250
consent.
But how do we really know?

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.828
You could say,
how do we know that silence

00:38:25.828 --> 00:38:30.889
confers tacit consent and
silence is not simply silence?

00:38:30.889 --> 00:38:33.406
An example I think of,
for example,

00:38:33.406 --> 00:38:37.107
if you go to a wedding
ceremony, or I guess in some

00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:42.076
wedding ceremonies,
the justice or the minister,

00:38:42.076 --> 00:38:48.610
whoever, says--what is the
phrase about whoever hold your

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:51.762
peace?
If anybody has any question

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:55.656
about this ceremony,
speak now or forever hold your

00:38:55.656 --> 00:38:59.940
peace and of course
everybody--except in the movies,

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.199
of course--everybody's always
silent.

00:39:03.199 --> 00:39:07.101
Nobody says it so their
consent, their tacit consent is

00:39:07.101 --> 00:39:09.885
given;
their silence from their

00:39:09.885 --> 00:39:15.030
silence to that question,
their tacit consent is given.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.696
But again, that would be one
way but again,

00:39:18.696 --> 00:39:23.845
how do we know when silence
confers tacit consent or silence

00:39:23.845 --> 00:39:26.289
is simply that,
silence?

00:39:26.289 --> 00:39:29.811
It's an issue that Locke
struggles with and to be sure

00:39:29.811 --> 00:39:32.336
never fully, or I think
satisfactorily,

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:35.400
resolves.
Maybe you will resolve it.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.275
Maybe you will resolve it in
your next paper,

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:42.000
if you have the opportunity to
write about consent and the

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.510
difference between the expressed
and tacit forms for citizenship.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.958
Also, the question being--which
Locke alludes to but does not

00:39:50.958 --> 00:39:55.257
fully or does not quite answer--
is there any difference in

00:39:55.257 --> 00:39:58.296
privileges,
in civil privileges between

00:39:58.296 --> 00:40:02.577
citizens how have given their
expressed consent and those who

00:40:02.577 --> 00:40:06.288
have only been said to tacitly
consent to the form of

00:40:06.288 --> 00:40:09.730
government?
Does he suggest that one class

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:14.483
of citizens has greater rights
or greater responsibilities than

00:40:14.483 --> 00:40:17.823
the other?
You might look into that

00:40:17.823 --> 00:40:22.803
question too and see if you
think Locke suggests any

00:40:22.803 --> 00:40:25.050
differences on that.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:32.565
To go back and just kind of
begin to wrap this up for the

00:40:32.565 --> 00:40:37.112
day, Locke does not appear to
endorse any particular form of

00:40:37.112 --> 00:40:40.579
government in the Second
Treatise.

00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:44.551
The task of forming the
government will fall to the

00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:47.489
decision of the majority but
again,

00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:51.864
what form the majority will
decide remains,

00:40:51.864 --> 00:40:55.510
to some degree,
an open question.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:59.625
What gives Locke or Lockeanism
its distinctive tone,

00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:04.063
its distinctive voice is the
claim that whatever kind of

00:41:04.063 --> 00:41:07.210
government a majority decides
upon,

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:12.849
it must be one that limits the
power of the sovereign.

00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:16.616
You cannot--and in this
respect, I think Locke is far

00:41:16.616 --> 00:41:19.659
closer to Lincoln than he was to
Stephan A.

00:41:19.659 --> 00:41:23.933
Douglas -- consent does not
simply mean consent to arbitrary

00:41:23.933 --> 00:41:26.666
rule;
it does not mean consent for

00:41:26.666 --> 00:41:29.639
the power of the sovereign to do
anything.

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:34.569
Locke's theory of
constitutional government is a

00:41:34.569 --> 00:41:40.967
theory of restrained government,
of constitutional restraints,

00:41:40.967 --> 00:41:44.047
of rule by law.
Locke gives,

00:41:44.047 --> 00:41:47.492
in many ways,
the importance of law and

00:41:47.492 --> 00:41:51.204
constitutional restraint;
what we would today call,

00:41:51.204 --> 00:41:54.352
I suppose, limited government.
He gives this far greater

00:41:54.352 --> 00:41:58.076
expression, far more powerful
expression than any of his

00:41:58.076 --> 00:42:01.069
predecessors;
certainly not Hobbes,

00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:06.253
who had attributed absolute
power to government or even to

00:42:06.253 --> 00:42:09.032
Aristotle who,
in many ways,

00:42:09.032 --> 00:42:14.531
shares some resemblances with
Locke, but even Aristotle had

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:21.188
severe doubts about rule of law.
Locke is absolutely confident

00:42:21.188 --> 00:42:27.175
that limited government,
restraints on power--whether

00:42:27.175 --> 00:42:33.512
that power be from the one,
the few or the many--restraints

00:42:33.512 --> 00:42:38.907
on power is the only kind of
government that can be trusted

00:42:38.907 --> 00:42:42.544
to protect rights.
And in one of the few jokes

00:42:42.544 --> 00:42:46.225
that appears in the Second
Treatise -- you might have

00:42:46.225 --> 00:42:49.219
missed it because Locke is a
subtle jokester;

00:42:49.219 --> 00:42:51.789
he's not like Machiavelli or
Plato.

00:42:51.789 --> 00:42:55.290
Locke is a very understated
jokester;

00:42:55.290 --> 00:43:00.834
he was an Englishman after all.
He writes in section 93,

00:43:00.834 --> 00:43:06.236
referring to Hobbes,
but you'll also see his

00:43:06.236 --> 00:43:12.023
wonderful animal references.
He writes: "If men quitting the

00:43:12.023 --> 00:43:15.689
state of nature entered into
society, they agreed that all of

00:43:15.689 --> 00:43:19.050
them but one should be under the
restraint of laws,"

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.250
thinking about Hobbes'
Leviathan.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.377
"But that he should still
retain all the liberty of the

00:43:25.377 --> 00:43:29.809
state of nature increased with
power and made licentious by

00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:32.048
impunity."
He goes on to say,

00:43:32.048 --> 00:43:35.942
"This is to think that men are
so foolish that they take care

00:43:35.942 --> 00:43:39.836
to avoid what mischiefs be done
to them by polecats and foxes

00:43:39.836 --> 00:43:44.644
but are content,
nay think it safety to be

00:43:44.644 --> 00:43:52.909
devoured by lions," the lion
being the Leviathan sovereign;

00:43:52.909 --> 00:43:56.554
whereas in the Lockean state of
nature, human beings are like

00:43:56.554 --> 00:43:59.945
polecats and foxes.
They're noxious creatures,

00:43:59.945 --> 00:44:04.747
he says, but they're not truly
dangerous to you and when one

00:44:04.747 --> 00:44:09.059
leaves the state of nature to
enter civil society,

00:44:09.059 --> 00:44:13.820
one is certainly not doing so
to empower a sovereign with

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.120
lion-like powers over you,
as he says.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.868
Who would do this?
It's better to have some kind

00:44:21.868 --> 00:44:26.340
of theory of restrained
government, a limited government

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.349
to do this for you.
I'm going to end on this note.

00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:32.704
What I want to do on Monday,
when I wrap up Locke,

00:44:32.704 --> 00:44:36.333
is to continue with his
doctrine of limited government

00:44:36.333 --> 00:44:40.920
because it turns out there is a
very important exception to it.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.746
There is a kind of escape
clause and I would encourage you

00:44:44.746 --> 00:44:48.907
as you read it to pay particular
attention to chapter 14 of the

00:44:48.907 --> 00:44:52.877
Second Treatise,
his chapter on what he calls

00:44:52.877 --> 00:44:56.500
prerogative power,
the doctrine that has very,

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.731
very important and grave
implications for our politics

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:03.510
today.
It's a very important chapter

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:08.087
and I want us to continue this
and then talk a little bit about

00:45:08.087 --> 00:45:12.000
the pros and cons of Lockean
political philosophy.

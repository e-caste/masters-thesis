00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.918
Professor David Blight:
Okay, there's an outline up

00:00:02.918 --> 00:00:04.541
here.
I'm going to try to write a

00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:07.585
little bigger from now on,
and it's been already suggested

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:10.789
I use capital letters and maybe
practice my printing a little

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.640
better.
I will do that too.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.193
I'm not very high-tech.
I will occasionally use some

00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:21.520
visuals, slides here and there,
a painting here and there,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.690
an image now and then,
and certainly maps,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.097
especially in dealing with the
1850s and the coming of the

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:32.280
Civil War.
But every lecture will have an

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.130
outline in front of you,
and the intention in every case

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.420
is to get to the fifth part of
that outline.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.180
I almost always do.
Almost.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.267
But at least you'll have a
sense of the structure of the

00:00:49.267 --> 00:00:53.800
topics or the themes that this
lecture is supposed to work its

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.480
way through.
I do welcome your questions.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.660
I'll ask at times if you have
any questions.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.244
This is obviously a terribly
formal situation,

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:07.829
me up here on this stage and
you out there,

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.156
looking into your laptops in
some cases, doing whatever

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:16.301
you're doing on your laptops.
Just don't do what one student

00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:17.629
did a year ago,
though.

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:22.640
He was right back there in that
aisle-way, halfway back.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.833
He came in--it was the day I
was lecturing on the Dred Scott

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:28.972
decision, for some reason I've
never forgotten that--and he

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:31.299
whipped out the Yale Daily
News,

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.410
and he just was enjoying the
Yale Daily News.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.301
I didn't know there was that
much to read in it for that

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.058
long, most of the time.
But he's just reading the

00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:42.640
Yale Daily News in front
of him.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.658
And at one point I stopped,
rather loudly,

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:47.267
and I said, "The Dred Scott
decision is not covered in

00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:51.440
today's Yale Daily News."
And he didn't hear me.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.463
So I shouted it again,
and by that time the whole

00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:57.172
class was beginning to laugh,
uncomfortably,

00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:00.069
and he finally realized what
was going on.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.400
The poor guy crumpled up his
newspaper and walked out the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.379
back and he never came back.
I felt a little badly about it

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.570
but--Just don't make it so
obvious.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.849
All right, does everybody have
a syllabus, anyone lacking a

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.238
syllabus, everyone's got a copy?
We may need some more,

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:27.340
the balcony people need
syllabi.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.430
They're hiding up there.
David, do you have any extras?

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.879
Professor David Blight:
None left.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.690
Okay, we'll have more on
Thursday.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.470
And I should put it on the Web.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.340
Dumb.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.478
I will put it up,
this afternoon we'll get it up

00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:10.129
on the Web, through the
Registrar's site or however.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.395
Today I'm going to take up the
topic primarily of why the

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.780
American Civil War period has
had,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.976
still has, such a hold on the
American, and for that matter

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:29.250
international,
historical imagination.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.090
That's what I want to talk
about primarily.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.425
But I want to say a word or two
about the structure of the

00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:45.759
course and what you need to do,
as quickly as possible.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.953
First of all every lecture,
if you look at the syllabus,

00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:54.069
has a topic,
a title of a kind.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.631
I will not get behind,
in spite of what it may feel

00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.831
like.
The readings are listed each

00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:03.259
week.
We are using,

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.845
among other things--there's a
combination of readings,

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.517
in fact,
a rich combination of

00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:14.107
historical monograph,
historical kind of syntheses,

00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:19.089
two works of fiction.
Two novels, one by Louisa May

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:23.786
Alcott, a famous short,
classic little book called

00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:28.936
Hospital Sketches,
which was based on Alcott's

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:33.959
personal experience as a nurse
in Civil War hospitals,

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.929
an experience that all but
overwhelmed her,

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:38.909
emotionally,
psychologically,

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:43.009
and she in some ways could not
stop thinking about it.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.470
We also are reading--using two
readers;

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.199
that is, collections of
documents.

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.829
One is a collection of
documents by,

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:53.210
mostly by and somewhat about,
Abraham Lincoln,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.139
a reader edited by Michael
Johnson.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.773
There's Nicole Ivy,
entering as we speak,

00:04:58.773 --> 00:05:02.766
the eighth teaching assistant.
Sorry Nicole,

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:07.568
we just did intros.
Anyway, one of the readers is

00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:11.170
Lincoln, the great speeches,
the great public letters.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.797
We won't use every document in
the book but the great Lincoln

00:05:15.797 --> 00:05:18.959
stuff is all there and well
introduced.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:21.576
The other reader,
which we'll use virtually every

00:05:21.576 --> 00:05:24.301
week in the course,
and teaching assistants will be

00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:27.081
free with this to assign
whichever documents they so

00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:29.459
choose,
any given week.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.300
I'm still taking the plastic
off this one.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.551
It's edited by Bill Gienapp,
a great Civil War historian,

00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:39.554
recently deceased.
It's a collection of documents

00:05:39.554 --> 00:05:42.819
from essentially the Mexican War
right on through Reconstruction,

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.792
many of them very brief and
short documents,

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:49.110
allowing us at times to teach
with a document.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.834
It's possible you'll have an
entire discussion section that

00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:56.236
centers around a single
document, as well as the other

00:05:56.236 --> 00:06:00.850
reading you did as background.
The other novel I neglected to

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.167
mention is a very new novel.
And I'm taking a risk in this

00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:06.835
course.
For years and years,

00:06:06.835 --> 00:06:09.817
and I won't admit how many,
I've always taught Michael

00:06:09.817 --> 00:06:12.928
Shaara's great Civil War novel,
The Killer Angels,

00:06:12.928 --> 00:06:15.756
which I would venture a quarter
of you have probably already

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:17.201
read.
All right, how many of you have

00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:18.400
already read Killer
Angels?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.480
Ah-ha.
We're not reading it this time.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.310
You can't take that week off.
We're reading E.L.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.197
Doctorow's new novel called
The March,

00:06:30.197 --> 00:06:34.199
which has only been out about a
year, just into paperback.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.695
It's Doctorow,
the great modern novelist of,

00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:43.190
well, urban America,
of race in America,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.636
of so many things.
He has actually a brilliant

00:06:46.636 --> 00:06:48.505
short story in the current
New Yorker,

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:51.190
if you haven't read it.
It may not appeal to all of you.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.810
It's really about middle-age
men in the suburbs.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.007
I got it.
Any rate, Doctorow's

00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:03.750
March is about Sherman's
march to the sea.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.115
It's about Sherman but it's
also about all the people around

00:07:08.115 --> 00:07:10.223
him.
And I think Doctorow

00:07:10.223 --> 00:07:14.383
accomplished something
extraordinary in that novel,

00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:19.374
which so few American writers
of fiction have ever quite been

00:07:19.374 --> 00:07:24.448
able to imagine--he's not alone
but not many have--and that is

00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:28.959
fully realize slave characters.
Those he invents.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:32.605
A lot of real people in that
book, and much of it--like so

00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:35.100
many other of Doctorow's great
works,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.236
like Ragtime,
if you've read Ragtime,

00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:40.370
or others--much of the
language,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.589
the dialog, is verbatim out of
historical sources.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.395
You might even want to read
Sherman's memoirs in tandem with

00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:50.539
it, if you have the time.
Whole portions of it come

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:54.406
directly out of Sherman's
memoirs, and then there are

00:07:54.406 --> 00:08:00.429
characters invented around it.
Anyway, it's that last,

00:08:00.429 --> 00:08:05.705
horrible, devastating,
destructive,

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:13.199
evil, but sometimes good,
year and a half of the Civil

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:18.935
War in Georgia and South
Carolina when the Civil War

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:24.110
became a truly kind of total
modern affair.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:29.388
It's a novel about this beast
of war itself but it's very much

00:08:29.388 --> 00:08:32.850
a novel about what this war was
about.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.088
Anyway.
I don't want to go into all the

00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:39.863
readings.
I divide this course in three

00:08:39.863 --> 00:08:43.548
parts which may or may not be
obvious the first time you

00:08:43.548 --> 00:08:48.817
glance at the syllabus.
But essentially the first third

00:08:48.817 --> 00:08:53.823
of the course is the coming of
the Civil War,

00:08:53.823 --> 00:09:01.220
it's the story from roughly the
mid-1840s through Fort Sumter.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.732
And the second third of the
course is essentially the war

00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:10.889
itself, where we tackle not only
how the Civil War was fought,

00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:14.261
but we tackle what it was
about, and we tackle the

00:09:14.261 --> 00:09:17.770
question of Confederate defeat
and Union victory.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.209
How do we explain that?
And we especially tackle

00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:25.091
questions of meaning.
If a war of such devastation

00:09:25.091 --> 00:09:29.009
can have meaning in the end,
what are those meanings?

00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:32.396
It's, I think,
arguably the most important

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:37.268
take-home set of questions and
answers you might take out of

00:09:37.268 --> 00:09:40.288
this course.
And of course that means we

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.364
dwell a good deal on
emancipation,

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:45.950
the single most revolutionary
result of the Civil War,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.446
and arguably the single most
revolutionary historical moment

00:09:49.446 --> 00:09:53.075
in American history.
The liberation of 4.2 million

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:57.805
slaves to some kind of freedom
and some kind of citizenship,

00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:01.266
at least for awhile.
And the third third of the

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.629
course is, of course,
Reconstruction.

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:07.823
That "brief shining moment" as
Du Bois once called it,

00:10:07.823 --> 00:10:11.938
of about eleven years from the
end of the Civil--from

00:10:11.938 --> 00:10:16.370
Appomattox to the disputed
election of 1876 and '77.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.993
Twelve years.
One of the most vexing,

00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:23.029
topsy-turvy,
turbulent, embittered periods

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:26.880
of American history that
historians still fight over,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.059
to say the least.
It is there where we'll try to

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:34.970
understand the consequences of
the Civil War.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.803
This is a course at the end of
the day about the causes and

00:10:39.803 --> 00:10:42.720
consequences,
as well as the course,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.220
of this event.

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:54.809
Now--but today is January
15^(th), it is Martin Luther

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:59.756
King's birthday.
Now I'll start with a very

00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:04.065
famous passage.
It's not usually the passage

00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:08.220
you hear from the "I Have A
Dream" speech.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.325
Almost always when the Dream
speech is quoted--and now it's

00:11:12.325 --> 00:11:14.519
quoted in commercials,
right?

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:18.982
Numerous times,
or on radio spots,

00:11:18.982 --> 00:11:21.418
background.
King's voice,

00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:24.342
as though it's some kind of
American chorus for whatever-

00:11:24.342 --> 00:11:26.343
when,
at any moment we need to feel

00:11:26.343 --> 00:11:29.019
better about ourselves and about
race relations.

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:32.806
We often just skip right over
the first two or three

00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:37.334
paragraphs of the speech where
the central metaphor he sets up

00:11:37.334 --> 00:11:41.640
in the speech is what he called
"the promissory note,"

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.610
in the "bank of justice."
"I am happy to join with you

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.250
today in what will go down in
history as the greatest

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:55.310
demonstration for freedom in the
history of our nation.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.850
And so we have come here."
Excuse me.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:03.552
"Five score years ago"--and
here he is drawing directly off

00:12:03.552 --> 00:12:08.741
Lincoln--"five score years ago a
great American in whose symbolic

00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:13.930
shadow we stand today signed the
Emancipation Proclamation."

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:20.402
This was of course August 1963.
A hot, a brutally hot August

00:12:20.402 --> 00:12:25.190
day, King on the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.682
"This momentous decree came as
a great beacon,

00:12:28.682 --> 00:12:33.338
light of hope to millions of
Negro slaves who had been seared

00:12:33.338 --> 00:12:36.519
in the flames of withering
injustice.

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:41.840
It came as a joyous daybreak,"
he says, "to end the long night

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.619
of their captivity."
That sentence is almost

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:49.727
directly from the Bible.
"But one hundred years later

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:53.647
the Negro still is not free.
One hundred years later the

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:57.486
life of the Negro is still sadly
crippled by the manacles of

00:12:57.486 --> 00:13:00.610
segregation and the chains of
discrimination.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.451
One hundred years later the
Negro lives on a lonely island

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.889
of poverty, in the midst of a
vast ocean of material

00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:11.133
prosperity.
One hundred years later the

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:16.345
Negro is still languished in the
corners of American society and

00:13:16.345 --> 00:13:19.820
finds himself an exile in his
own land.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.190
And so we've come here today to
dramatize a shameful condition.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.940
In a sense we've come here,
we've come to our nation's

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.777
capital, to cash a check.
When the architects of our

00:13:33.777 --> 00:13:36.992
Republic wrote the magnificent
words of the Constitution and

00:13:36.992 --> 00:13:41.561
the Declaration of Independence,
they were signing a promissory

00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:45.730
note to which every American was
to fall heir.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.628
This note was a promise that
all men, yes,

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:54.762
black men as well as white men,
would be guaranteed the

00:13:54.762 --> 00:13:59.895
unalienable rights of life,
liberty and the pursuit of

00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:02.632
happiness.
It is obvious today that

00:14:02.632 --> 00:14:07.087
America has defaulted on this
promissory note insofar as her

00:14:07.087 --> 00:14:12.747
citizens of color are concerned.
Instead of honoring this sacred

00:14:12.747 --> 00:14:18.296
obligation America has given the
Negro people a bad check,

00:14:18.296 --> 00:14:24.039
a check which has come back
marked 'insufficient funds.'

00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:28.549
But we refuse to believe that
the bank of justice is bankrupt,

00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:32.985
we refuse to believe that there
are insufficient funds in the

00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:36.460
great vaults of opportunity of
this nation.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:42.853
And so we've come to cash this
check, a check that will give

00:14:42.853 --> 00:14:47.730
us, upon demand,
the riches of freedom and the

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:52.849
security of justice."
I would be thrilled if you

00:14:52.849 --> 00:14:58.502
walked out of this course and
were able to explain to somebody

00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:04.062
why King made the promissory
note the central metaphor of his

00:15:04.062 --> 00:15:10.734
"I Have a Dream" speech,
and you could somehow explain

00:15:10.734 --> 00:15:18.566
why it hadn't been cashed by
1963, and could then begin to

00:15:18.566 --> 00:15:24.200
discuss whether it's fully
cashed yet.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.130
Now--that was just my homage to
King.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:37.296
Now, I like to do a little
ritual at the beginning of every

00:15:37.296 --> 00:15:39.317
class.
If you'll forgive me,

00:15:39.317 --> 00:15:41.610
it only takes me about ten
seconds.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.325
But you know we live in a world
where all of us in this room

00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:48.900
take books for granted.
We throw books on the floor,

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.831
we throw books at people,
we load them in and out of our

00:15:52.831 --> 00:15:56.291
backpacks,
we drop them here and drop them

00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:59.149
there, we lose them,
we rip them up,

00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:03.149
we write all over them--I write
all over mine.

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:06.435
It's only a few generations ago
when there really weren't any

00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:09.351
bookstores to go to.
Your great-great-grandparents

00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:11.769
couldn't meander a bookstore,
to speak of,

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:15.310
unless they lived in a special
section of a special city.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.548
Books are precious things.
A lot of them are assigned in

00:16:19.548 --> 00:16:21.886
this course.
There's short ones,

00:16:21.886 --> 00:16:24.626
little ones,
big ones, syntheses,

00:16:24.626 --> 00:16:27.401
novels, monographs.
Think of a book,

00:16:27.401 --> 00:16:30.131
just for a moment,
and then you can forget this if

00:16:30.131 --> 00:16:35.480
you want.
But think of a book, any book.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.444
It's hard to think of a really
bad book this way,

00:16:38.444 --> 00:16:41.594
but think of a good book,
one of your favorite books

00:16:41.594 --> 00:16:44.148
ever,
as like a newborn child,

00:16:44.148 --> 00:16:47.480
a newborn child brought into
the world.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.807
A book.
Probably a lot more planning

00:16:51.807 --> 00:16:55.356
and thought and design and
construction,

00:16:55.356 --> 00:17:00.178
at least intellectually,
goes into that book than goes

00:17:00.178 --> 00:17:02.180
into most babies.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.862
Books have a cover.
They have beginnings,

00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:14.778
middles and ends.
They're somebody's dream,

00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:20.093
they're somebody's creation.
They never satisfy--just like

00:17:20.093 --> 00:17:25.680
people--but they're in some ways
the greatest things we have,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.665
and sometimes it's nice to
remind ourselves of that,

00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:33.730
in the places where we take
them most for granted.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:39.361
And I want to quote for you,
to you, from the oldest history

00:17:39.361 --> 00:17:44.150
book in Western civilization.
Not just because it's a book,

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.747
but I think this is a point one
can make about any history

00:17:47.747 --> 00:17:50.839
course, it doesn't matter what
the subject is.

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:53.697
It can be Social History,
Political History,

00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:56.089
Intellectual History,
any history.

00:17:56.089 --> 00:17:58.591
It can be the History of
Ancient Rome,

00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:02.849
it could be Post-1945 United
States, it could be any history.

00:18:02.849 --> 00:18:10.133
But any history course ought to
do the two things that Herodotus

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:17.880
named in the opening sentence of
the oldest history book we have.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.880
This is Herodotus,
The History.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.281
Isn't it great when you're
writing the first book,

00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:27.220
what are you going to call it?
The History;

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.080
no subtitles,
nothing fancy,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.229
just--"I, Herodotus of
Halicarnassus,

00:18:36.229 --> 00:18:41.519
am here setting forth my
history,

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:46.215
that time may not draw the
color from what man has brought

00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:51.157
into being, nor those great and
wonderful deeds manifested by

00:18:51.157 --> 00:18:54.369
both the Greeks and the
barbarians,

00:18:54.369 --> 00:18:58.500
fail of their report,
and together,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:04.210
with all of this,
the reason why they fought one

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.861
another."
I don't know how closely you

00:19:06.861 --> 00:19:08.544
listened to that,
but what has Herodotus just

00:19:08.544 --> 00:19:11.714
said?
He's basically said history is

00:19:11.714 --> 00:19:14.405
two things.
It's the story,

00:19:14.405 --> 00:19:18.116
it's the color,
it's the great deeds,

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:22.960
it's the narrative that takes
you somewhere;

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:31.000
but it's also the reason why,
it's also the explanations.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.138
That's what history does.
It's supposed to do both of

00:19:34.138 --> 00:19:36.740
those things.
Some of us are more into the

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.710
analysis, and we're not so fond
of story.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.277
Some of us just love stories
and don't care about the

00:19:43.277 --> 00:19:45.816
analysis--"oh,
stop giving me all that

00:19:45.816 --> 00:19:48.698
interpretation,
just tell me the good story

00:19:48.698 --> 00:19:50.877
again."
This is what goes on,

00:19:50.877 --> 00:19:53.636
of course, out in public
history all the time:

00:19:53.636 --> 00:19:57.560
"just tell us the old stories
and just sing us the old songs,

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.067
make us feel good again.
Stop interpreting,

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:05.172
you historians,
and worst of all,

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:08.317
stop revising."
You notice how that word

00:20:08.317 --> 00:20:11.170
'revision' has crept into our
political culture?

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.665
When politicians don't like the
arguments of people who disagree

00:20:14.665 --> 00:20:18.049
with them they accuse them of
being revisionist historians.

00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:21.306
It was even a poll-tested word
for a while when Condoleezza

00:20:21.306 --> 00:20:25.089
Rice was using it.
"Revisionist, revisionist."

00:20:25.089 --> 00:20:28.509
As though all history isn't
revisionist.

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:31.540
My favorite story about
revisionism is my buddy,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.990
Eric Foner, was on a talk show
once.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.222
About 1992.
He was on one of those shouting

00:20:37.222 --> 00:20:40.136
talk shows with Lynne Cheney,
who at that--Dick Cheney's

00:20:40.136 --> 00:20:42.150
wife--who was then head of the
NEH.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.854
And this was a time--you won't
remember this--we were having

00:20:45.854 --> 00:20:49.621
this national brouhaha over what
were called National History

00:20:49.621 --> 00:20:51.253
Standards.
And Lynne Cheney,

00:20:51.253 --> 00:20:53.338
if you remember,
a real critic of these National

00:20:53.338 --> 00:20:55.634
History Standards.
She didn't particularly like

00:20:55.634 --> 00:20:58.509
some of the ideas that the
historians were coming up with.

00:20:58.509 --> 00:21:00.973
So on this talk show--it was
Firing Line where you get

00:21:00.973 --> 00:21:03.519
two people on and they just
shout at each other for an hour,

00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:05.559
or a half hour,
and the producers love it.

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:08.906
And Foner is pretty good at
rapid fire coming back,

00:21:08.906 --> 00:21:12.639
he's pretty good at it.
Anyway they had this set-to and

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:15.960
she kept accusing him and other
historians of being

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.717
"revisionist."
And Eric says the next morning

00:21:18.717 --> 00:21:21.809
he got a phone call from a
reporter at Newsweek and

00:21:21.809 --> 00:21:24.212
she said,
"Professor Foner,

00:21:24.212 --> 00:21:28.130
when did all this revisionism
begin?"

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.339
And Foner said,
"Probably with Herodotus."

00:21:32.339 --> 00:21:33.920
And the Newsweek
reporter said,

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.330
"Do you have his phone number?"

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.363
Never underestimate the
ignorance--H.L.

00:21:43.363 --> 00:21:47.906
Mencken said this,
I didn't--never underestimate

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:51.870
the ignorance of the American
people.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.950
Or of journalists, or of--.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.532
Now, as to this question of why
the Civil War has a hold on us,

00:22:06.532 --> 00:22:10.960
or a hold on historical
imagination in this country.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.390
There are many,
many ways to think about that.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.427
I'm going to take you through
seven or eight possible answers

00:22:17.427 --> 00:22:20.589
to that in just a moment,
almost like a list.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:24.785
But again, sometimes if you go
back to the oldest explanations

00:22:24.785 --> 00:22:28.430
you find things that we haven't
even thought about.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.967
In Thucydides' The
Peloponnesian War,

00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:34.388
the first great modern text,
in Western Civilization at any

00:22:34.388 --> 00:22:36.700
rate,
about a Civil War,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.823
the great Greek Civil War.
In Thucydides' great work he

00:22:41.823 --> 00:22:47.255
has this little sentence where
he actually captures a good deal

00:22:47.255 --> 00:22:50.759
about why civil wars are such
vexing,

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:54.890
difficult problems in nations'
memories once they've had them.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:23:00.309
So Thucydides said,
"The people made their

00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:06.390
recollections fit in with their
sufferings."

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:11.630
They began to tell a story that
reflected their own suffering.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:17.020
Now the 'they' here might be
white southerners.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.869
They suffered.
They lost.

00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:24.259
They were truly defeated,
conquered.

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:26.640
That suffering might be
African-Americans.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.940
Emancipation wasn't a day of
jubilee;

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.580
it was an agonizing,
horrible, terrible,

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:39.172
sometimes wonderful,
set of experiences into the

00:23:39.172 --> 00:23:42.363
unknown.
And the suffering might be

00:23:42.363 --> 00:23:43.720
northern Unionists.

00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:54.833
About 300,000 Yankee soldiers
died in the Civil War and about

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:58.210
650 to 700,000 were wounded.

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:07.000
People made their memories fit
their sufferings.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.140
I also like this little
passage, to just put into your

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.750
craw, about any History course,
about any interpretation.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.541
And of course I'm going to have
a point of view at times in this

00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:20.029
course;
all historians do.

00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:23.025
Don't even listen to a
historian if he or she doesn't

00:24:23.025 --> 00:24:26.490
have a point of view.
None of us are blank slates.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:34.023
None of us can just tell it
like it was--"stop interpreting,

00:24:34.023 --> 00:24:36.834
please."
But I always try to remember

00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:40.177
William James' passage in one of
his Pragmatism essays,

00:24:40.177 --> 00:24:42.808
an essay I think that should be
required for U.S.

00:24:42.808 --> 00:24:45.342
citizenship.
If I ruled the world you'd have

00:24:45.342 --> 00:24:48.920
to read this for U.S.
citizenship.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.027
In it, James says,
"The greatest enemy of any one

00:24:54.027 --> 00:24:58.390
of my truths is the rest of my
truths."

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:02.591
It's as though James is saying,
"damn, every time I think I

00:25:02.591 --> 00:25:06.647
really know something--that's
the truth--along comes some

00:25:06.647 --> 00:25:09.980
other possible truth and it
screws it up."

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.200
Why can't history just be
settled?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.751
Enough already.
If it was, it wouldn't be any

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:20.529
fun;
if it was it wouldn't be

00:25:20.529 --> 00:25:22.719
interesting;
if it was it wouldn't be good

00:25:22.719 --> 00:25:23.740
for business either.

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:33.570
Now, why does the Civil War
have a hold?

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.537
Why are you here?
There's 280 of you here for a

00:25:36.537 --> 00:25:39.185
course on the Civil War.
I know it fits--10:30 on

00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:41.935
Tuesday, Thursday--a hundred
other reasons--you want a

00:25:41.935 --> 00:25:45.637
lecture course.
Lots of possible answers to all

00:25:45.637 --> 00:25:50.715
that kind of question.
But why does this event hold

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:53.635
people?
There are now approximately

00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:57.897
65,000 books that have been
written on the American Civil

00:25:57.897 --> 00:26:01.627
War--this doesn't even really
include the books on

00:26:01.627 --> 00:26:06.269
Reconstruction--that have been
written since Appomattox.

00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:09.333
Now, I realized recently when I
was giving a public talk that

00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:12.346
you can't always say "since
Appomattox" and people know what

00:26:12.346 --> 00:26:14.151
you mean.
I'm going to assume Yale

00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:16.244
students do.
But that's actually where the

00:26:16.244 --> 00:26:18.430
surrender was signed that ended
the Civil.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.632
I was giving a talk recently
and I said, "Before Appomattox

00:26:20.632 --> 00:26:22.910
and after Appomattox"--and I
must have said that four of five

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.339
times.
One of the first questions in Q

00:26:25.339 --> 00:26:28.778
&amp; A is this woman innocently
asked, "Well what is

00:26:28.778 --> 00:26:32.200
Appomattox?"
Oh dear.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.480
"Well you see ma'amâ€¦"
Anyway.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.710
Since Appomattox 65--you know
what that is?

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:42.875
That's more than one per
day--have been published in this

00:26:42.875 --> 00:26:45.490
country on this event.
Why?

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:54.406
What does Robert Penn Warren
mean when he said,

00:26:54.406 --> 00:26:57.819
"The Civil War draws us as an
oracle,

00:26:57.819 --> 00:27:05.255
darkly unriddled and portentous
of our personal and our national

00:27:05.255 --> 00:27:07.767
fate"?
That's pretty grandiose

00:27:07.767 --> 00:27:10.220
language, but what did Warren
mean?

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.562
What did Gertrude Stein mean
when she said,

00:27:13.562 --> 00:27:17.939
"There never will be anything
more interesting than that

00:27:17.939 --> 00:27:20.938
American Civil War"?
Of all people,

00:27:20.938 --> 00:27:25.289
Gertrude Stein was hopelessly
interested in this event.

00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:29.803
"There never will be anything
more interesting than that

00:27:29.803 --> 00:27:35.015
American Civil War," she said.
Why are so many people into

00:27:35.015 --> 00:27:38.126
this?
Why do people want to read

00:27:38.126 --> 00:27:42.810
about it, re-enact it,
go play it, go visit it?

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:49.305
Is it just heritage tourism?
Is it just the attraction of

00:27:49.305 --> 00:27:53.561
military history?
What is it that compels us to

00:27:53.561 --> 00:27:57.122
remember the most divisive,
the most bloody,

00:27:57.122 --> 00:28:01.180
the most tragic event in our
national history?

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:07.901
And how do we remember it?
Have we sometimes cleaned it up

00:28:07.901 --> 00:28:14.470
with such pleasing mythology
that we've just made it fun?

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.160
Why is the Confederate flag a
problem?

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.173
Why doesn't it just go away?
It's the second most ubiquitous

00:28:22.173 --> 00:28:26.132
American symbol across the
world, especially since Michael

00:28:26.132 --> 00:28:28.681
Jordan quit playing.
Other than the U.S.

00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:31.584
flag, the Confederate flag is
the most ubiquitous symbol of

00:28:31.584 --> 00:28:34.188
the United--maybe Coca Cola,
okay, but Coca Cola's an

00:28:34.188 --> 00:28:37.213
international symbol now.
You can find the Confederate

00:28:37.213 --> 00:28:40.362
flag everywhere in this world.
I spent a year in Germany and

00:28:40.362 --> 00:28:42.330
I've traveled a lot in Eastern
Europe.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.745
I saw it all over the place.
I was in Prague,

00:28:46.745 --> 00:28:49.220
the Czech Republic,
in 1993.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.377
Jim McPherson's Battle Cry
of Freedom,

00:28:52.377 --> 00:28:55.750
a book you're assigned largely
as background,

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.360
the largest selling book on the
American Civil War published in

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.426
the last twenty-five years.
International bestseller,

00:29:02.426 --> 00:29:05.233
sixteen weeks on the New York
Times Bestseller List,

00:29:05.233 --> 00:29:08.900
was translated into Czech.
I mean, nobody reads Czech.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.630
Except the Czechs,
and even them,

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.299
even they tend to read fiction
in German.

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:17.984
Anyway, I was at a bookstore,
they had a big display of Jim

00:29:17.984 --> 00:29:20.760
McPherson's Battle Cry of
Freedom, the whole bookstore

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.690
window.
I couldn't believe it.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:28.460
But how did they display it?
With Confederate flags.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.430
And they missed the point of
the title of the book,

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.015
but never mind.
How do you portray the American

00:29:36.015 --> 00:29:39.563
symbol less symbolically?
Oh it's that Confederate flag

00:29:39.563 --> 00:29:42.390
that will tell us right away
what this is about.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.344
Why?
Why doesn't the Confederate

00:29:45.344 --> 00:29:46.340
flag just go away?

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.859
Or put another way,
why do you love the Civil War?

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:56.961
I can't tell you how many
thousands of times in public

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:58.269
lectures, et cetera,
et cetera,

00:29:58.269 --> 00:30:02.082
et cetera in my--and all Civil
War historians face this--people

00:30:02.082 --> 00:30:05.661
will come up afterward.
Usually they want to show you

00:30:05.661 --> 00:30:08.758
their grandfather's letters,
but they'll say,

00:30:08.758 --> 00:30:13.159
"I just love the Civil War."
And you want to just stop them

00:30:13.159 --> 00:30:16.340
for a moment and say,
"You need a shrink."

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:23.519
Or, "What is it you love?
Is it the aftermath at Antietam?

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:26.910
Is it the trenches of
Spotsylvania?

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:31.100
Is it the latrines at
Andersonville?

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.540
Is it Booth killing Lincoln?
What is it you love?"

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:46.371
Is it because we love epics?
Is it because a lot of people

00:30:46.371 --> 00:30:48.259
really are kind of hardwired
maybe?

00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:51.351
We may even be
hardwired--biologically--for

00:30:51.351 --> 00:30:53.376
story.
I can't prove that but there's

00:30:53.376 --> 00:30:56.874
a lot of research on this.
Are we hardwired for story,

00:30:56.874 --> 00:30:59.242
and therefore,
to some degree,

00:30:59.242 --> 00:31:03.243
for epic stories that have
heroes and villains and

00:31:03.243 --> 00:31:07.000
beginnings and ends and great
collisions?

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.536
Maybe.
Is it because Americans love

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:14.388
redemption?
And people around the world

00:31:14.388 --> 00:31:17.029
love to think that about us
sometimes too.

00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:22.418
Is it because we like to see or
we've converted this terribly

00:31:22.418 --> 00:31:26.279
divisive experience into a great
unifier?

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:28.902
Do we go back and look at the
Civil War not only to see the

00:31:28.902 --> 00:31:30.529
beginnings of our own modern
time,

00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:33.208
in a modern American nation,
a second American Republic,

00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:36.130
born out of the death of the
first and so on and so forth?

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:41.963
But do we actually go back to
this most dividing experience to

00:31:41.963 --> 00:31:45.309
figure out how we became
unified?

00:31:45.309 --> 00:31:48.312
Or as William Dean Howells put
it in 1900 in a lovely line,

00:31:48.312 --> 00:31:51.315
he said, "What the American
people always like is a tragedy

00:31:51.315 --> 00:31:53.800
as long as they can give it a
happy ending."

00:31:59.329 --> 00:32:03.865
Is it because we see the
American Civil War,

00:32:03.865 --> 00:32:09.244
or have learned to see it,
as American's first great

00:32:09.244 --> 00:32:14.252
racial reckoning?
Where the nation's national sin

00:32:14.252 --> 00:32:19.747
of slavery, as some like to put
it, had to finally be remitted

00:32:19.747 --> 00:32:22.720
in some way, purged,
cleansed?

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.430
In the language used by both
sides in this war,

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:31.138
of purgings and cleansings.
The war that brought a

00:32:31.138 --> 00:32:36.845
reckoning from 250 years of
slavery, destroyed a slave

00:32:36.845 --> 00:32:40.829
society,
brought the end of the First

00:32:40.829 --> 00:32:44.730
American Republic,
and the revolution of

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.095
emancipation.
I think there's a lot to argue

00:32:49.095 --> 00:32:54.074
that Americans have begun,
at least, they've just begun

00:32:54.074 --> 00:32:59.789
this, to love the Civil War
because they love emancipation.

00:32:59.789 --> 00:33:03.589
They want to live in the nation
that freed its slaves.

00:33:03.589 --> 00:33:06.707
My favorite line in George Bush
the first's Inaugural Address in

00:33:06.707 --> 00:33:09.428
1989--and I'm probably the only
one that ever bothers to

00:33:09.428 --> 00:33:12.150
remember this line or maybe the
only one who cares.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:13.910
But Peggy Noonan wrote him a
sentence.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.043
It's classic inaugural rhetoric
and it comes right after the

00:33:18.043 --> 00:33:22.247
section in Bush One's inaugural
where he's saying we must put

00:33:22.247 --> 00:33:26.039
the war in Vietnam behind us,
it is too divisive and so on.

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:29.017
And then there's a line where
he says, "We must remember,

00:33:29.017 --> 00:33:31.835
we are the nation that sent
600,000 of its sons to die

00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:33.430
rather than have slavery."

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:41.220
Now, who wouldn't want to live
in that country?

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.490
That's a great line in an
inaugural address.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.357
Of course it's ignoring the
fact that at least half of those

00:33:47.357 --> 00:33:51.173
people died to preserve slavery.
But never mind,

00:33:51.173 --> 00:33:59.680
I mean--Do we love the Civil
War because sometimes there's a

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:06.518
lot of guilty pleasure,
or not so guilty pleasure,

00:34:06.518 --> 00:34:12.219
in just loving the details of
military history?

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:16.730
And if you're one of those,
fine, that's great.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:23.119
I had that stage, too.
I will confess, if you make me.

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:26.580
But what is all that nostalgia
about for those battlefields?

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:34.633
Or is it because this
experience in American history

00:34:34.633 --> 00:34:39.130
is ultimately about loss?
Are we attracted to loss?

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:42.110
Is loss more interesting
sometimes than victory?

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:47.937
And by loss I mean defeat but
also loss in terms of human

00:34:47.937 --> 00:34:52.413
life, treasure,
proportions of civilizations

00:34:52.413 --> 00:34:58.039
that died.
Take loss for just a moment.

00:34:58.039 --> 00:35:01.214
If you took the 620,000-odd
Americans who died in the Civil

00:35:01.214 --> 00:35:04.279
War, you moved it ahead to the
Vietnam era in roughly the

00:35:04.279 --> 00:35:07.179
twelve years the United States
fought in Vietnam,

00:35:07.179 --> 00:35:10.008
per
capita--okay?--approximately

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:14.570
four million Americans would've
died in Vietnam.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:19.261
That's the scale of death and
loss in the Civil War -- four

00:35:19.261 --> 00:35:21.566
million.
Now Americans will never

00:35:21.566 --> 00:35:25.120
sustain four million casualties
in a war, I would argue.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:29.104
I can't prove that.
Unless Osama bin Laden is

00:35:29.104 --> 00:35:34.321
coming through that window.
Who knows, maybe he will one

00:35:34.321 --> 00:35:37.670
day.
Wouldn't that be cool?

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:42.679
You wouldn't sleep through that
lecture.

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:45.799
But I don't think Americans
will ever sustain that kind--but

00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:49.011
four million--if you came,
per capita from the Civil

00:35:49.011 --> 00:35:51.920
War-era population to the era of
Vietnam.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.038
Every year at Antietam,
in rural Maryland,

00:35:55.038 --> 00:35:57.699
on the anniversary of the
battle,

00:35:57.699 --> 00:36:02.772
17^(th) of September,
they put out illuminati,

00:36:02.772 --> 00:36:06.829
or the illuminaria,
excuse me--no,

00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:10.429
no, whoa, that's a
slip--illuminaria,

00:36:10.429 --> 00:36:15.929
or the little candle lamps,
all over the battlefield.

00:36:15.929 --> 00:36:19.505
They put 23,000 of them out,
which was the number of

00:36:19.505 --> 00:36:22.309
casualties in eight hours at
Antietam.

00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:27.542
And when the sun goes down you
can look at the battlefield and

00:36:27.542 --> 00:36:32.517
get a sense of this kind of
powerful, almost artistic sense

00:36:32.517 --> 00:36:36.683
of the loss.
Every one of those little

00:36:36.683 --> 00:36:41.702
candle lights was a human life.
Related to that,

00:36:41.702 --> 00:36:47.202
is the American imagination for
this event still stimulated in

00:36:47.202 --> 00:36:51.800
part because sometimes we just
like lost causes?

00:36:54.949 --> 00:36:59.415
We are attracted to defeat
sometimes more than we are

00:36:59.415 --> 00:37:03.930
attracted to victory.
Loss in war is sometimes more

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.230
interesting.
Lost causes somehow represent

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:12.261
the rebel spirit,
a rebellious spirit,

00:37:12.261 --> 00:37:17.710
an insurrectionary spirit,
an insurgent spirit.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.910
Some people may be attracted in
that way.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.933
And maybe last but not least,
and this list could go on and

00:37:26.933 --> 00:37:30.380
on, there is I think an interest
in the Civil War,

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.439
among serious readers in
particular because it does

00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:39.309
somehow satisfy that search we
often all have for origins.

00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:42.368
The origins of the modern
nation state,

00:37:42.368 --> 00:37:46.875
the origins of big government,
the origins of centralized

00:37:46.875 --> 00:37:49.011
power,
the origins of what seemed to

00:37:49.011 --> 00:37:51.904
be the death of state's rights;
but it surely didn't die,

00:37:51.904 --> 00:37:53.779
did it?
We have a state's rights

00:37:53.779 --> 00:37:56.500
Supreme Court now,
in case you didn't notice.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.620
The birth of a kind of
modernity in America,

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.449
in many forms,
comes out of this era.

00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:04.664
It doesn't just come out of the
Battle of Gettysburg but it

00:38:04.664 --> 00:38:05.810
surely comes out of the era.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.187
There's also this sense in
which, somehow,

00:38:12.187 --> 00:38:15.309
in that experience of the Civil
War in the middle of the

00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:18.885
nineteen century--fought for the
existence of an American nation

00:38:18.885 --> 00:38:21.610
and for the new definition of
that nation,

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:28.197
and just how free and equal the
people in it would be--is where

00:38:28.197 --> 00:38:34.041
we may somehow see that
transformation from a pre-modern

00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:36.910
to a more modern world.

00:38:39.989 --> 00:38:43.960
And sometimes I suspect that's
what attracts us.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.790
Now, the watch says I only have
about two minutes.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.600
So let me leave you here.

00:38:54.769 --> 00:39:01.094
I do think sometimes we're
attracted because war is just so

00:39:01.094 --> 00:39:04.792
beguilingly fascinating.
And Drew Faust,

00:39:04.792 --> 00:39:08.125
a wonderful historian whom you
now know is the President of

00:39:08.125 --> 00:39:11.054
Harvard University,
has just published a brand new

00:39:11.054 --> 00:39:13.329
book, it's literally just out
this week.

00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:15.469
I read it in manuscript,
I have a blurb on the back.

00:39:15.469 --> 00:39:19.320
It's called The Republic of
Suffering.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:25.304
And she has much to say in that
book, which I highly recommend,

00:39:25.304 --> 00:39:28.780
about why death is so
interesting.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.824
Let me leave you with this.
Thursday, I'm going to take up

00:39:33.824 --> 00:39:38.010
the Old South and begin this
comparison of the Old South to

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.646
the growing capitalist--well,
both sides were highly

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:48.141
capitalist--northern society.
But in 1850 or 1840s America

00:39:48.141 --> 00:39:52.120
you could find both extremes of,
on the one hand,

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.182
a tremendous seemingly
unfathomable optimism about

00:39:56.182 --> 00:39:58.985
America.
It seemed to be limitless and

00:39:58.985 --> 00:40:02.555
boundless, and nobody captured
it, ever, any better than Walt

00:40:02.555 --> 00:40:03.210
Whitman.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.470
But you can also find
expressions all over the

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.101
culture, especially from
African-Americans and

00:40:13.101 --> 00:40:16.083
abolitionists and some
slaveholders of a great dread

00:40:16.083 --> 00:40:18.480
about the direction of the
country.

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:26.604
In Whitman's first line of his
Drum-Taps,

00:40:26.604 --> 00:40:30.829
his famous collection of Civil
War poetry,

00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:34.523
comes that phrase,
which is up here:

00:40:34.523 --> 00:40:39.426
"First O Songs for a Prelude."
And that first poem in

00:40:39.426 --> 00:40:43.104
Drum-Taps is Whitman
trying to capture just how

00:40:43.104 --> 00:40:48.181
exciting war can be.
But he'd also written a poem

00:40:48.181 --> 00:40:52.365
like "Democracy."
And I'll leave you with this,

00:40:52.365 --> 00:40:55.719
and I'll start with a response
to it on Thursday.

00:40:55.719 --> 00:41:00.061
In Whitman's "Democracy," as
well as several other Whitman

00:41:00.061 --> 00:41:04.250
poems, you can find this
limitless sense of optimism.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:11.270
Just listen to his words:
"Sail, sail thy best ship of

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.946
Democracy.
Of value is thy freight,

00:41:14.946 --> 00:41:19.467
'tis not the Present only,
the Past is also stored in

00:41:19.467 --> 00:41:21.261
thee."
This America,

00:41:21.261 --> 00:41:25.618
this thing called America to
him is the whole world's new

00:41:25.618 --> 00:41:28.250
beginning.
"Thou holdest not the venture

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.597
of thyself alone,
not the Western continent

00:41:30.597 --> 00:41:32.920
alone.
Earth's résumé

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:39.930
entire floats on thy keel!
O ship is steadied by thy spars.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:46.914
With thee Time voyages in trust.
The antecedent nations sink or

00:41:46.914 --> 00:41:51.125
swim with thee."
America is everything,

00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:55.620
according to Whitman.
"With all their ancient

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.960
struggles, martyrs,
heroes, epics,

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.079
wars though bearest the other
continents.

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:05.271
Theirs, theirs as much as
thine, the destination-port

00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:08.568
triumphant.
Steer then with good strong

00:42:08.568 --> 00:42:12.994
hand and wary eye.
O helmsmen, though carriest

00:42:12.994 --> 00:42:16.828
great companions.
How can I pierce the

00:42:16.828 --> 00:42:20.219
impenetrable blank of your
future?

00:42:20.219 --> 00:42:24.610
I feel thy ominous greatness,
evil as well as good.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.610
I watch thee advancing,
absorbing the present,

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:32.036
transcending the past.
I see thy light lighting and

00:42:32.036 --> 00:42:36.579
thy shadow shadowing as if the
entire globe.

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:41.101
But I do not undertake to
define thee, hardly can I

00:42:41.101 --> 00:42:42.820
comprehend thee."

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:51.744
Well that's Whitman saying,
as we all do at times,

00:42:51.744 --> 00:42:57.214
"America is an idea."
This course is the story of

00:42:57.214 --> 00:43:01.607
what that idea was and what
happened to it,

00:43:01.607 --> 00:43:06.000
and the chance it had coming
out of it.

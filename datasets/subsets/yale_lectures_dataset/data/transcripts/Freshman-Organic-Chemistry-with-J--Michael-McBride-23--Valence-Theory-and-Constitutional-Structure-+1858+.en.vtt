00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.669
Prof: So we're going
through the development of the

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:07.557
theory and practice of organic
chemistry, generation by

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:08.360
generation.
 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.536
We started with Lavoisier,
and then Berzelius and

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:14.450
Gay-Lussac and Davy.
 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.550
And last time we did Dumas and
Liebig and Wöhler.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.682
And now we're onto the next
generation, people that were

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.110
born around 1830.
 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.510
And the new developments are
going to be valence and benzene.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.849
Remember, in this list,
things that are in boldface are

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:37.930
experimental and things that are
theoretical are in normal face.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.723
So valence and -- and benzene
is experimental,

00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:44.510
but what we're interested in is
the theory of benzene here.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.913
And the people who are
associated with this are August

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:49.070
Kekulé
--

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.813
and you've all heard of
Kekulé

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:52.750
structures and Kekulé
benzene,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.480
and he's memorialized on the
front of the building here.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.740
He was born in 1829.
 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.183
But few of you probably have
heard of Archibald Couper,

00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:07.287
who is not on the front of the
building, and was born two years

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:08.769
later in 1831.
 

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:12.299
This is Couper as a student.
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.912
He lived to a reasonable age,
sixty-one-years-old,

00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:20.489
but everything he did,
he did early.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:22.950
He was sort of a dilettante
student.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.918
He was a native of Scotland and
studied in Edinburgh,

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:29.360
but also went to Berlin often.
 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.900
And he studied classics and
metaphysics, logic,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.650
moral philosophy;
went to a lot of concerts.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.370
But while in Berlin he got
fascinated by chemistry.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.010
So in 1855 he became a student
chemist.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.236
And in 1856 he went to Paris to
work with Wurtz,

00:01:48.236 --> 00:01:51.833
who was the other leading
French chemist,

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:55.430
and worked indeed on salicylic
acid;

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.290
as you have done.
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.359
In 1858, while in Wurtz's lab,
he got fired,

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.358
for reasons that you'll see,
and he went back to Scotland

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.000
and tried to make a career
there.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.538
But soon he had a mental
breakdown, and the rest of his

00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:13.439
life he didn't do anything.
 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.669
Okay?
 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.819
But what he did in 1858 is
really something.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.720
Okay?
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.658
So he didn't get a stone on the
front of our building.

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:26.460
But on this building,
which is "To Let",

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.949
or at least was a few years
ago, in Kirkintilloch,

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.659
which is about eight miles
northeast of Glasgow,

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.598
in Scotland, there's a stone.
 

00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:36.613
And it says:
"This plaque marks the

00:02:36.613 --> 00:02:39.247
birthplace of Archibald Scott
Couper whose brilliant

00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:42.294
pioneering contributions to
chemical theory have won for him

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:44.586
international renown,
and whose genius,

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:49.020
stifled by an early illness,
was denied the opportunity of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.050
consummation."
 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.960
When he was recovering from his
first breakdown,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.970
he went fishing on this Endrick
Water,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.970
north of Glasgow,
and got sunstroke,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.610
which did him in for the rest
of his life.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.580
And that's where he lived.
 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.568
His mother nursed him for his
final 33 years in this house in

00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:09.900
Kirkintilloch.
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.610
So this is the paper.
 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.960
He tried to publish it in
French.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.669
He submitted it to his boss,
Wurtz,

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.530
in the hopes that he would put
it in the French journal,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.240
but Wurtz thought it was not
such a --

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.586
it was a little rash as a
paper, and put it in his desk to

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:27.878
cool off for awhile.
 

00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:29.494
And in the meantime
Kekulé

00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:32.502
published,
which irritated Couper no

00:03:32.502 --> 00:03:37.490
little, and he told Wurtz what
he thought about it,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.030
which was why he got sacked.
 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.334
But he also published it in
English, and later it was

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:44.310
published in French.
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.819
But so this is the English
version, not the first version

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.538
he wrote;
by Archibald Scott Couper.

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:54.080
And the first sentence already
is fascinating.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.434
"The end of
chemistry"

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:57.357
(that is, the goal of
chemistry) "is its

00:03:57.357 --> 00:03:58.098
theory."
 

00:03:58.098 --> 00:03:59.720
Not many people would have said
that.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.756
They would have had more
practical motivations for

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:03.500
chemistry.
 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.468
But Couper was a big thinker.
 

00:04:07.468 --> 00:04:11.229
He said: "The guide in
chemical research is a theory.

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.884
It is therefore of the greatest
importance to ascertain whether

00:04:14.884 --> 00:04:18.540
the theories at present adopted
by chemists are adequate to the

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.839
explanation of chemical
phenomena,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.485
or at least,
based upon the true principles

00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:26.759
which ought to regulate
scientific research."

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:33.250
So what were the theories that
were prevalent at this time,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.370
by 1850?
 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.100
Name one.
 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.949
Prof: Shai?
 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.019
Student:  Dualism.
 

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:39.970
Prof: Dualism;
okay, the radical theory.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.490
That was prevalent in Germany.
 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.839
How about elsewhere,
like France?

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.329
Student:  Substitution.
 

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.110
Prof: The substitution,
or type, or unitary theory.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.730
Okay, so those were the big
theories.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.720
"Among those which have
been lately developed,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.682
there is one,
on account of its apparent

00:04:55.682 --> 00:04:57.841
numerous merits,
which particularly claims

00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:00.220
investigation,
and respecting which we deem

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.980
that it would not be
unprofitable were either new

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.740
proofs of its scientific value
furnished or,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.180
on the contrary,
should considerations be

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.232
adduced establishing not only
its inadequacy to the

00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:14.089
explanation,
but its ultimate detriment to

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:15.660
the progress of science.
 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.490
I allude to the system of types
as advocated by Gerhardt."

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.942
So Gerhardt and Laurent,
who were slightly second-level

00:05:22.942 --> 00:05:25.821
French chemists,
were the ones who really came

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:28.379
up with the idea of the type
theory.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.839
But Dumas adopted and advocated
it, and was the leader.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:39.350
So this was the theory that was
going on in the lab where he was

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.100
present, in Paris.
 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.665
So page 106 of this paper,
on the French type theory,

00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:46.959
he said:
"Should the principle

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.158
which is therein adopted be
applied to common events of

00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:53.180
life, it will be found that it
is simply absurd.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.398
Suppose that some one were to
systematize the formation of

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:59.560
letters into words that formed
the contents of a book.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.391
Were he to begin by saying that
he had discovered a certain word

00:06:03.391 --> 00:06:06.617
which would serve as a
type" (remember there were

00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:08.634
four types;
water, ammonia,

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:12.834
HCl and hydrogen) "and
from which by substitution and

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:17.110
double decomposition all the
others are to be derived,

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.329
that he by this means not only
could form new words,

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:22.560
but new books,
and books almost ad infinitum;

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.129
he would state certainly an
empirical truth."

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.137
That is, you can take some word
and substitute letters,

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.588
or pairs of letters,
or sets of letters,

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.410
for other letters,
and get any word you want.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.240
Okay?
 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.805
"At the same time,
however, this method would,

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:37.629
judged by the light of common
sense, be an absurdity.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:41.387
But a principle which common
sense brands with absurdity is

00:06:41.387 --> 00:06:44.949
philosophically false and a
scientific blunder."

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.930
So this was not likely to make
him popular in Paris.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.480
So here's what he was doing,
actually, right?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.600
The Emperor's new clothes.
 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.029
He's a new guy on the block,
right?

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.562
He's only been a chemist for
two years, only begun studying

00:07:01.562 --> 00:07:05.095
chemistry two years before,
and says what everybody's doing

00:07:05.095 --> 00:07:06.740
is nonsense, in France.
 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.790
Well how about in Germany?
 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.800
That's where he was before,
in Berlin.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.630
"I can only remark that it
is not merely an unprofitable

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.384
figure of language,
but is injurious to science,

00:07:16.384 --> 00:07:20.060
inasmuch as it tends to arrest
scientific inquiry by adopting

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.062
the notion that these quasi
elementsâ€¦"

00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:25.819
What does he mean by the quasi
elements;

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:26.930
what are they?
 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.870
Student:  Compound
radicals.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.490
Prof: Compound radicals,
right?

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.218
"â€¦contain some
unknown and ultimate power,

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.379
which it is impossible to
explain."

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.360
That is, okay,
so you got radicals.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.819
What holds the radicals
together?

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.529
Right?
 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:43.798
"It stifles inquiry at the
very point where an explanation

00:07:43.798 --> 00:07:46.079
is demanded,
by putting the seal of

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:49.596
elements, of ultimate powers,
on bodies which are known to be

00:07:49.596 --> 00:07:50.740
anything but this."
 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.884
They're definitely not
elements, because you can burn

00:07:53.884 --> 00:07:56.605
them, of course,
and get water and CO_2 and so

00:07:56.605 --> 00:07:57.029
on.
 

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.370
Okay?
 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.079
So this was absolutely true;
on both counts,

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.980
both the French and the German
theory.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.750
But it was stated pretty
undiplomatically.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.810
Right?
 

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.065
And especially for someone
who'd only been studying

00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:10.240
chemistry for two years.
 

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.447
Maybe it took someone who was
only studying chemistry two

00:08:13.447 --> 00:08:15.339
years to see how stupid it was.
 

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:16.410
Right?
 

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.886
But at any rate,
he got in trouble because of

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:19.278
this.
 

00:08:19.278 --> 00:08:21.339
What did he offer as an
alternative?

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:24.791
To look at the properties of
the elements themselves,

00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.846
not of radicals,
not of these planetary systems

00:08:27.846 --> 00:08:29.439
that were the types.
 

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:32.493
"Science demands the
strict adherence to a principle

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:34.620
in direct contradiction to this
view.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.296
That first principle,
without which research cannot

00:08:37.296 --> 00:08:39.330
advance a step,
dare not be ignored;

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.633
namely, that a whole is simply
the derivative of its

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:43.538
parts."
 

00:08:43.538 --> 00:08:46.072
So you have to understand the
elements, and then you can

00:08:46.072 --> 00:08:48.190
understand assemblies of
elements from that.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.720
That's not obviously true.
 

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.136
In fact, I think you could make
a pretty good argument that as

00:08:52.136 --> 00:08:54.475
you get things more complicated,
they're not simply a sum of

00:08:54.475 --> 00:08:55.110
their parts.
 

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.350
But that's what he said.
 

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.884
"As a consequence of this,
it follows that it is

00:08:59.884 --> 00:09:03.514
absolutely necessary to
scientific unity and research to

00:09:03.514 --> 00:09:06.750
consider these bodies as
entirely derivative,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.269
and as containing no secret
ultimate power whatever,

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:13.405
and that the properties which
these so-called quasi elements

00:09:13.405 --> 00:09:16.383
possess are a direct consequence
of the properties of the

00:09:16.383 --> 00:09:19.360
individual elements of which
they are made up."

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.769
So study the elements,
not the radicals.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:25.840
And he began by saying he'll
focus on carbon;

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.860
which is not surprising for an
organic chemist.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.335
"In applying this method,
I propose at present to

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:33.110
consider the single element,
carbon.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.596
This body is found to have two
highly distinguishing

00:09:37.596 --> 00:09:39.178
characteristics.
 

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:42.563
(1) It combines with equal
numbers of hydrogen,

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:45.360
chlorine, oxygen,
sulfur, etc."

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.490
Would you agree with that?
 

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:57.190
How could he say so?
 

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:02.006
It's because he wasn't dealing
with the right atomic weights,

00:10:02.006 --> 00:10:02.649
right?
 

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:04.330
Okay?
 

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.080
"It enters into chemical
union with itself."

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.554
So those are the two things:
that it'll unite with itself,

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:14.029
not just with other things,
the way dualism would like you

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:17.024
to do;
and it combines with -- it has

00:10:17.024 --> 00:10:19.168
a certain combining power.
 

00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:21.739
"These two properties,
in my opinion,

00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:24.495
explain all that is
characteristic of organic

00:10:24.495 --> 00:10:25.750
chemistry."
 

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:31.778
So 1858 marks a new frontier in
organic chemistry;

00:10:31.778 --> 00:10:34.969
a completely new revelation:
The tetravalence and

00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:36.629
self-linking of carbon.
 

00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:38.370
That's points one and two,
right?

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.570
That it combines with a certain
number of other things and it

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.690
can link to itself.
 

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.538
Right?
 

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:47.379
Now here he shows the formula
of methane, of CO_2,

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:49.730
and of carbon tetrachloride.
 

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.371
But those are the atomic
weights he's using,

00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:54.399
in order to get these formulas.
 

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:57.110
Notice he says:
"Here the whole four of

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.389
hydrogen are not bound by a
mutual affinity."

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:04.352
You know that they're not all
collected together because you

00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:07.370
can substitute them one by one;
one chlorine,

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.340
two chlorines,
three chlorines.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.621
"For each element of
hydrogen can be substituted for

00:11:11.621 --> 00:11:13.129
one of chlorine in regular
series,

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:15.460
beginning with the first and
ending with the last.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.615
The atoms of oxygen are,
on the contrary,

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:20.509
united in pairs."
 

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:23.606
What does he mean by that,
that the oxygens are united in

00:11:23.606 --> 00:11:24.049
pairs?
 

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.320
Why are they united in pairs in
his formulas,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.690
drawn by those curly brackets,
like they had in type theory?

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:35.860
Yes Angela?
 

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.923
Student:  Probably one
oxygen, because the -- they were

00:11:39.923 --> 00:11:43.590
probably one oxygen because his
weight is half of it.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.092
Prof: Ah ha,
because he had half the atomic

00:11:45.092 --> 00:11:45.370
weight.
 

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.048
So they always came in pairs;
to get oxygen sixteen,

00:11:49.048 --> 00:11:51.048
if he thinks oxygen is eight.
 

00:11:51.048 --> 00:11:54.714
"The atoms of oxygen are
in pairs which will be more

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.940
fully developed hereafter."
 

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.899
Not in this paper.
 

00:11:57.899 --> 00:12:01.600
But there was no hereafter,
because of his breakdown,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.100
okay?
 

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.979
"And only for two atoms of
oxygen two chlorines can be

00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:06.269
substituted; thus."
 

00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:09.267
So you can start with CO_2,
get a phosgene and carbon

00:12:09.267 --> 00:12:10.190
tetrachloride.
 

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.179
"In the same manner with
bodies that contain multiples of

00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:14.700
C^2 united to hydrogen."
 

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.840
So carbon is the same deal.
 

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.177
It always comes in pairs,
because its atomic weight is

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:20.690
six instead of twelve.
 

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.009
Okay.
 

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:25.340
"Take the inverse of this.
 

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.437
If the four atoms of hydrogen
were bound together,

00:12:28.437 --> 00:12:31.788
we could evidently expect to
form such bodies as H^4^(

00:12:31.788 --> 00:12:32.798
)Cl^4."
 

00:12:32.798 --> 00:12:33.158
Right?
 

00:12:33.158 --> 00:12:36.330
If the four were all held
together and could make four

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.340
bonds, then you could get H^4^(
)Cl^4, or these other compounds.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.684
"One would naturally
expect to find carbon

00:12:42.684 --> 00:12:44.979
substituted for chlorine,
and find bodies like

00:12:44.979 --> 00:12:47.070
H^4_, Cl^2,
C^2, and so on.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.580
These bodies are not only
unknown,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.351
but the whole history of
hydrogen might be investigated

00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:54.275
and not a single instance be
found in favor of the opinion

00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:56.379
that it has any affinity for
itself,

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:58.669
when in union with another
element."

00:12:58.669 --> 00:13:00.700
Okay?
 

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.346
Remember, getting all the
chlorines together was

00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:05.899
Schwindler's idea.
 

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:09.479
Okay, so here,
now that he have the idea that

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:14.441
these atoms associate together,
it makes sense to talk about a

00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:15.580
structure.
 

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.740
Right?
 

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.710
What's connected to what's
connected to what?

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.320
You know, the toe-bone and the
ankle-bone and all that stuff.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.519
Okay, so now you could write
structural formulas.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:27.758
So these were the very first
structural formulae,

00:13:27.758 --> 00:13:31.740
because before this there was
no such thing as structure.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.500
Okay?
 

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.094
Thus methylic alcohol has this
formula, and ethylic alcohol has

00:13:36.094 --> 00:13:36.788
the other.
 

00:13:36.788 --> 00:13:39.460
So now do you see the theme
here?

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.629
What's he using to denote bonds?
 

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:45.399
Prof: Three dots are a
bond.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:50.029
So he has a carbon bonded to
three H's, and also to OOH.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:52.740
That's because oxygen is
doubled, right?

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.389
So we would write it this way.
 

00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:58.490
Or ethyl alcohol we would write
that way.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.139
Or this compound.
 

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:05.330
Now, this one has a printer's
error in it.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.750
What is it, and what's the
printer's error?

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.440
What's the substance?
 

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.678
Seth, can you read it off to me?
 

00:14:25.678 --> 00:14:28.383
Start from the left,
the bottom left;

00:14:28.383 --> 00:14:29.360
what is it?
 

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.399
What's the first group?
 

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:33.399
There's a carbon.
 

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.440
That's a single carbon.
 

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.210
Yeah, methyl, CH_3.
 

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:36.515
Right?
 

00:14:36.515 --> 00:14:39.275
He doesn't draw the three bonds
to hydrogen separately,

00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:41.730
but it's clearly C bonded to
three hydrogens.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.570
What's next?
 

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.259
Keep going.
 

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:50.200
It's a C bonded to what?
 

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.158
The top left.
 

00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:54.159
It's bonded to the methyl,
of course.

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:55.490
What else?
 

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.970
Student:  Oxygen and
hydrogen.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.250
Prof: Bonded to oxygen,
to a single oxygen;

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.980
although he wrote two, right?
 

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.419
And what else is that carbon
bonded to?

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:04.210
Student:  Hydrogen.
 

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.519
Prof: How many?
 

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:09.259
How many hydrogens is it bonded
to?

00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:10.990
The top left carbon.
 

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.678
Student:  Two.
 

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:13.511
Prof: The two.
 

00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:15.168
So it's CH_3CH_2O.
 

00:15:15.168 --> 00:15:19.419
Now, can someone help me out
with the rest of it?

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.740
Ryan?
 

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.731
Student:  Well wouldn't
that only just be one O at the

00:15:23.731 --> 00:15:25.660
top because --
Prof: It should be one

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.340
O, but he's got the different
atomic weight.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.158
John?
 

00:15:28.158 --> 00:15:30.200
Student:  Shouldn't the
C's on the far right be bonded?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.659
Prof: Ah,
the C's on the far right should

00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:32.500
be bonded to one another.
 

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.179
The printer left that out.
 

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:35.389
So it's symmetrical.
 

00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:37.548
It's diethyl ether.
 

00:15:37.548 --> 00:15:37.850
Okay?
 

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.570
And it's the correct structure
for it, except for the printer's

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.110
error.
 

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.990
Okay?
 

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.673
Now, he says:
"There is no reaction

00:15:46.673 --> 00:15:50.870
found where it is known that C^2
is divided into two parts.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.389
It is only consequent therefore
to write,

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:55.657
as Gerhardt does,
C^2 simply as C,

00:15:55.657 --> 00:15:59.160
it being understood that the
equivalent of carbon is

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.330
twelve."
 

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.778
So he changed it in this paper
to be twelve.

00:16:02.778 --> 00:16:05.750
So now his formulas are going
to be more like ours,

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.820
without the C^2.
 

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.051
So he has a formula for
glycerin, and one for glyceric

00:16:11.051 --> 00:16:11.610
acid.
 

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.190
So let's do glyceric acid.
 

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.129
What do you see up at the top?
 

00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:17.320
What's the top carbon?
 

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.460
Max, what do you say?
 

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.532
What's it bonded to,
the carbon at the top,

00:16:29.532 --> 00:16:30.629
on the right?
 

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:31.909
Student:  Bonded to a
hydrogen.

00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:33.179
Prof: One hydrogen.
 

00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:34.860
Student:  OH group.
 

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.480
Prof: An OH group.
 

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.538
Student:  And another --
Prof: Pardon me?

00:16:38.538 --> 00:16:39.440
Student:  Another OH
group.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.649
Prof: Two OH groups,
and the carbon below.

00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:42.890
Right?
 

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.298
Because carbon can bond to
carbon;

00:16:44.298 --> 00:16:46.600
that's the special thing about
it.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.892
Okay, so here's the one on the
left, in a formula nowadays,

00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:51.879
and there's the one on the
right.

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:55.354
And it turns out he guessed a
bit wrong, because he put two

00:16:55.354 --> 00:16:58.350
OH's on the top part and none on
the middle one;

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.340
and it should be the other way
around.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.649
So in truth he should've
changed those two.

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.309
Of course, he had no way of
knowing it.

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:05.798
And the same on the right.
 

00:17:05.798 --> 00:17:06.125
Okay?
 

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:08.788
So he's pretty close with his
structure.

00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:11.334
But probably the most
remarkable thing is his

00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:14.226
structure for glucose,
which is shown here,

00:17:14.226 --> 00:17:16.890
and which -- now,
he doesn't show the vertical

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.950
bonds between carbons.
 

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.558
He uses this curly bracket.
 

00:17:19.558 --> 00:17:21.950
So that's a little reminiscent
of type theory.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.430
But clearly that's what he
meant was the carbons to be

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.319
bonded to carbon.
 

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.890
So that's the formula he wrote.
 

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.079
And that's the correct
structure for glucose,

00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:32.890
if it's hydrated.
 

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.519
Okay?
 

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:37.807
So you can add -- glucose is an
aldehyde, CHO on the bottom,

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:38.970
double bond O.
 

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.380
So you can add water to the
aldehyde;

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.788
that actually happens.
 

00:17:43.788 --> 00:17:46.430
And you get the structure he
wrote here.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.349
So it's right,
if the glucose is in water.

00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:50.039
Right?
 

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:51.130
So try yourself.
 

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.788
This is a good exercise for
reviewing what we've been doing.

00:17:53.788 --> 00:17:58.202
Depending on how you define it,
it's a two or a three-step

00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:01.994
sequence of HOMO/LUMO
interactions that take water

00:18:01.994 --> 00:18:06.190
plus an aldehyde into a diol;
which is what you have here.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.319
So try that one out.
 

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:08.710
Okay?
 

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.498
And in the French version of
the same paper,

00:18:10.498 --> 00:18:12.161
which as we said appeared a
little later,

00:18:12.161 --> 00:18:13.160
he drew it this way.
 

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.838
And what do you notice is
different now?

00:18:15.838 --> 00:18:17.630
There are two things different
actually.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.240
Student:  Straight lines.
 

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.683
Prof: Yeah,
now he's drawing single lines,

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:23.058
straight lines for bonds.
 

00:18:23.058 --> 00:18:24.538
So this is the first time that
was done;

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:26.480
none of those dotted lines
anymore.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.509
But there's a typo.
 

00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:30.338
Instead of drawing OH here --
and notice --

00:18:30.338 --> 00:18:32.548
yeah, instead of drawing OOH
here,

00:18:32.548 --> 00:18:35.359
for a second,
he added -- he's got the wrong

00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:37.240
formula,
he's got H_2 there.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.892
But this is really amazing,
that he got the correct

00:18:39.892 --> 00:18:42.279
structure for such a complicated
molecule,

00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:45.990
in the very first paper where
the idea of structure,

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.160
or of bonds altogether,
was proposed.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.068
So this is really amazing.
 

00:18:50.068 --> 00:18:55.506
And we owe to Couper the idea
of bonds, and the notation we

00:18:55.506 --> 00:18:57.098
use to do them.
 

00:18:57.098 --> 00:19:02.096
So here's Old Aisle Cemetery in
Kirkintilloch in Scotland,

00:19:02.096 --> 00:19:03.150
yesterday.
 

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.685
And there you see that this is
the gravestone of Archibald

00:19:07.685 --> 00:19:08.880
Scott Couper.
 

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:14.519
And down here is your thank-you
note.

00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:17.240
&gt;
 

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.854
And those are the flowers --
that's the heather you bought to

00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:22.240
put on his tombstone.
 

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.509
So that was our secret
thank-you note.

00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:29.892
And we thank Susan Frew for
being our agent and delivering

00:19:29.892 --> 00:19:31.200
this yesterday.
 

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:39.440
&gt;
 

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.538
Okay.
 

00:19:40.538 --> 00:19:42.777
But on the front of the
building Couper doesn't get any

00:19:42.777 --> 00:19:43.440
notice at all.
 

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.118
It's only you guys that are in
the know that can do that.

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:46.400
Right?
 

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.880
On the front of the building
they say Kekulé.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.558
So let's talk about
Kekulé.

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:53.463
And we'll also talk about
Hofmann, who we've mentioned

00:19:53.463 --> 00:19:56.971
before as the guy in the top-hat
on the right end of that picture

00:19:56.971 --> 00:19:58.670
in Liebig's lab in Giessen.
 

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.838
And Cannizzaro.
 

00:20:01.838 --> 00:20:04.346
Okay, this is a drawing that
Kekulé

00:20:04.346 --> 00:20:06.180
made at the age of thirteen.
 

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.865
By my standards,
that's a pretty darn good

00:20:08.865 --> 00:20:09.519
drawing.
 

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:12.400
And here's one he made at the
age of eighteen.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.730
And he went to Giessen
University to study

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.330
architecture,
but while he was there he went

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.835
to Liebig's lectures and got
fascinated by chemistry and

00:20:23.835 --> 00:20:25.108
became a chemist.
 

00:20:25.108 --> 00:20:25.464
Okay.
 

00:20:25.464 --> 00:20:29.442
He studied with Liebig and
after he finished he wanted to

00:20:29.442 --> 00:20:32.710
go to Paris to study with the
people there.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.289
Liebig, remember,
had worked with Gay-Lussac.

00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:37.700
So he knew from Paris.
 

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:43.413
What do you think he would tell
Liebig, the young guy about to

00:20:43.413 --> 00:20:45.098
go off to Paris?
 

00:20:45.098 --> 00:20:47.170
Student:  Stay away from
Dumas.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.244
Prof: Stay away from
Dumas perhaps,

00:20:49.244 --> 00:20:49.650
right?
 

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.596
What he said was,
"There you will broaden

00:20:52.596 --> 00:20:56.394
your horizons,
there you will learn a new

00:20:56.394 --> 00:20:59.652
language,
there you will learn to know

00:20:59.652 --> 00:21:03.951
the life of a great city,
but there you will not learn

00:21:03.951 --> 00:21:05.319
chemistry."
 

00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:06.288
But he went anyhow.
 

00:21:06.288 --> 00:21:09.917
He also went to England and
became widely acquainted with

00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:12.380
all the leading chemists of the
day.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.913
Then he got a job in
Heidelberg, where he was from

00:21:15.913 --> 00:21:19.230
1856 to '58, and he did research
on cacodyl;

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.930
that's that free radical
involving arsenic.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.608
A remarkable -- his student,
who worked with him on that was

00:21:26.608 --> 00:21:30.019
Baeyer, who we'll talk about a
lot later.

00:21:30.019 --> 00:21:33.064
That was Bunsen,
who was the big cheese in

00:21:33.064 --> 00:21:35.737
Heidelberg, was the one
Kekulé

00:21:35.737 --> 00:21:37.519
was associated with.
 

00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:40.722
And he did the work,
not in the laboratory,

00:21:40.722 --> 00:21:45.298
but in the kitchen in his
apartment, this work on arsenic.

00:21:45.298 --> 00:21:50.220
So in 1857, while he was there,
he proposed a new type,

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.858
based on carbon.
 

00:21:51.858 --> 00:21:54.383
So carbon could have four
things attached to it,

00:21:54.383 --> 00:21:56.799
which you could substitute one
for another.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:57.529
Right?
 

00:21:57.529 --> 00:22:01.232
So this was where he got the
idea of carbon being something

00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:04.298
special, the basis of a new
type, and that it was

00:22:04.298 --> 00:22:05.318
tetravalent.
 

00:22:05.318 --> 00:22:08.807
And ultimately he got onto the
idea, a year later,

00:22:08.807 --> 00:22:11.298
that carbon could link to
itself.

00:22:11.298 --> 00:22:15.680
So he had proposed the marsh
gas type before Couper's paper.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.220
But this other one was
essentially simultaneous;

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:23.278
just slightly later written but
earlier published.

00:22:23.278 --> 00:22:28.249
Here are his Observations on
Mr. Couper's New Chemical

00:22:28.249 --> 00:22:29.578
Theory.
 

00:22:29.578 --> 00:22:31.384
"In fact,
in two memoirs which have

00:22:31.384 --> 00:22:33.190
appeared in Liebig's
Annalen,

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.960
I have put forward different
views,

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.268
which, in my opinion,
should furnish a clearer

00:22:38.268 --> 00:22:42.680
insight into the constitution of
chemical compounds."

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.090
"I may be allowed to
indicate that lays down the

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:50.160
principle...which I have called
the basicity of atoms."

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.365
"If Mr. Couper thinks he
has discovered the cause of this

00:22:53.365 --> 00:22:56.468
difference of basicity in the
existence of a special kind of

00:22:56.468 --> 00:22:58.875
affinity,
I am the first to admit that I

00:22:58.875 --> 00:23:01.640
have no right to contest his
priority in this."

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.097
But he was quick to say that he
was the one that had the idea

00:23:05.097 --> 00:23:05.558
first.
 

00:23:05.558 --> 00:23:07.790
And he went to quite a
successful career,

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.130
in contrast to Couper.
 

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.173
Here he is in Ghent,
the period during which he

00:23:11.173 --> 00:23:13.708
proposed the structure for
benzene, with a bunch of people

00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:16.529
whom we will talk about later;
or at least several of them

00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:18.519
we'll talk about later,
as his students.

00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:22.395
And then he became the leader
in Bonn, in a big new chemistry

00:23:22.395 --> 00:23:23.559
institute there.
 

00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:25.328
Here he is in 1872.
 

00:23:25.328 --> 00:23:31.200
And we'll talk a lot about this
guy on the right here.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.730
So he became a really prime
leader in chemistry.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.000
Now, facts, ideas and words.
 

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.779
Words means nomenclature.
 

00:23:41.779 --> 00:23:46.045
So these new ideas needed new
words, and also not just words

00:23:46.045 --> 00:23:49.009
written out with letters,
but notation;

00:23:49.009 --> 00:23:52.788
what symbols are you going to
write for these things?

00:23:52.788 --> 00:23:56.412
And a further development to
that is actual physical models

00:23:56.412 --> 00:24:00.222
that you could put together to
show what you are talking about

00:24:00.222 --> 00:24:03.900
with molecules;
if they have structure.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.068
So Hofmann was great with
language.

00:24:06.068 --> 00:24:10.192
He actually went and became a
leading professor in the Royal

00:24:10.192 --> 00:24:13.547
College of Chemistry in London,
because Prince Albert -- you

00:24:13.547 --> 00:24:16.288
know, Victoria and Albert --
Albert was a German.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:19.506
So he had a lot of connections
with German chemistry and went

00:24:19.506 --> 00:24:20.150
to Liebig.
 

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.344
Liebig said,
"Hofmann's a great guy,

00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:22.150
you should get him."
 

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:22.848
So they got him.
 

00:24:22.848 --> 00:24:26.305
So he came to London,
and was completely fluent in

00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:29.759
English, and very good at
languages altogether.

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:34.567
And he'd had the idea of
systematizing the names of

00:24:34.567 --> 00:24:36.009
hydrocarbons.
 

00:24:36.009 --> 00:24:39.710
So he was going to base it on
Latin roots.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.608
So four will be
"quart",

00:24:41.608 --> 00:24:42.069
right?
 

00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:44.480
What do we say for four?
 

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.400
Butane, right?
 

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.598
We talked about that last time.
 

00:24:46.598 --> 00:24:50.068
So "quartane"
is the start.

00:24:50.068 --> 00:24:53.193
And then you can start pulling
hydrogens off and have names for

00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:53.950
the radicals.
 

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.309
So you could pull one hydrogen
off;

00:24:55.309 --> 00:24:56.970
that's "quartyl".
 

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.029
Because yl,
remember, is the root that

00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.779
means radical.
 

00:24:59.779 --> 00:25:01.440
And then you can pull a second
hydrogen off;

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.720
then you have
"quartene".

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.397
And then you pull a third
hydrogen off,

00:25:05.397 --> 00:25:06.680
it's "quartenyl".
 

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.541
And then "quartine,
quartinyl, quartone,

00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:12.079
quartonyl, quartune,
quartunyl".

00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:15.400
What was his system?
 

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.630
How can you remember which one
is "quartune"?

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.680
Yeah?
 

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.088
Student:  It's the
vowels.

00:25:20.088 --> 00:25:22.640
Prof: It's the vowels in
order, a-e-i-o-u.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.500
And we preserve the a,
the e and the i;

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.561
although we write y,
instead of i,

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:30.410
for alkyne.
 

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:30.758
Right?
 

00:25:30.758 --> 00:25:33.140
That's where it came from,
from Hofmann.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.459
But the quart didn't
stick, because but was

00:25:36.459 --> 00:25:38.058
well established by then.
 

00:25:38.058 --> 00:25:40.494
Okay, now how about
Kekulé's -- so that's

00:25:40.494 --> 00:25:40.910
words.
 

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.558
How about notation?
 

00:25:42.558 --> 00:25:45.377
So in the paper where he
proposed benzene,

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:49.160
in 1865, while he was Ghent,
he says, in a footnote:

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.138
"For greater clarity I am
presenting at the end of this

00:25:53.138 --> 00:25:56.712
note a table giving graphical
formulae for most of the

00:25:56.712 --> 00:25:58.400
substances mentioned.
 

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.210
The idea that these formulae
are designed to express is

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.078
rather well known now;
so it will not be necessary to

00:26:04.078 --> 00:26:04.890
dwell upon it.
 

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.172
I am keeping the form that I
adopted in 1859 when expressing

00:26:08.172 --> 00:26:11.287
for the first time my views on
the atomic constitution of

00:26:11.287 --> 00:26:12.400
molecules."
 

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.309
So 1859 is at the time he was
proposing valence and so on;

00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:16.990
1858, as I remember.
 

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.038
So this is now five,
six years later,

00:26:20.038 --> 00:26:22.920
and he's applying it to
benzene.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.796
"This form is nearly
identical with that which

00:26:25.796 --> 00:26:29.017
Monsieur Wurtz used in his
beautiful lectures on chemical

00:26:29.017 --> 00:26:29.880
philosophy.
 

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.653
It seems to me preferable to
the modifications proposed by

00:26:33.653 --> 00:26:36.500
Messieurs Loschmidt and
Crum-Brown."

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.380
So let's first look at what
Loschmidt did,

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.160
and Crum-Brown.
 

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.652
So here's what they said,
to which Kekulé

00:26:42.652 --> 00:26:44.509
considers his superior.
 

00:26:44.509 --> 00:26:48.369
Well first let's think,
what should a formula show?

00:26:48.369 --> 00:26:49.038
Right?
 

00:26:49.038 --> 00:26:50.880
What's the very first thing a
formula should show?

00:26:55.328 --> 00:26:58.630
It has to correspond with the
facts, right?

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.230
So what facts do you deduce
about a molecule?

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.430
What should the formula show?
 

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.348
Kevin?
 

00:27:04.348 --> 00:27:06.190
Student:  What elements
are in the --

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.375
Prof: What elements are
there: carbon,

00:27:08.375 --> 00:27:10.163
hydrogen, oxygen,
chlorine, nitrogen,

00:27:10.163 --> 00:27:10.809
whatever.
 

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:12.440
Okay, what else?
 

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.259
Shai?
 

00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:14.078
Student:  The ratio of
elements.

00:27:14.078 --> 00:27:16.380
Prof: The ratio of the
elements, right?

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.380
Berzelius also had this.
 

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.700
But what's going to be new?
 

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.640
Composition:
the elements and the number of

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.200
atoms.
 

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.906
What next;
now, if we've got the new

00:27:26.906 --> 00:27:28.440
theory, the valence theory?
 

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.390
Sherwin?
 

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.569
Student:  The structure.
 

00:27:30.569 --> 00:27:31.140
Prof: The structure.
 

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.298
What do you mean by the
structure?

00:27:32.298 --> 00:27:35.150
Student:  The relative
positioning.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.702
Prof: You mean like
x,y,z

00:27:36.702 --> 00:27:37.119
coordinates?
 

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:39.509
You could write numbers.
 

00:27:39.509 --> 00:27:43.309
Here's the origin;
I'm going to give this 1.238

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:44.250
and so on.
 

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:44.970
What?
 

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.680
Student:  Then which
atoms are bonded.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.193
Prof: Ah,
which ones are connected to one

00:27:49.193 --> 00:27:49.730
another.
 

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:50.188
Right?
 

00:27:50.188 --> 00:27:53.948
Not their positions in space;
but this is connected to this,

00:27:53.948 --> 00:27:55.710
this valence goes there,
and so on.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.608
Okay, so Berzelius was already
fine for composition.

00:27:58.608 --> 00:28:01.740
But now we also need to show
Constitution -- that's the

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.814
second C is constitution --
which means the nature and

00:28:04.814 --> 00:28:06.089
sequence of bonds.
 

00:28:06.089 --> 00:28:07.160
Now sequence is clear.
 

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.910
This is bonded to this,
bonded to this one.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.131
What do I mean by the
"nature"

00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:10.568
of the bond?
 

00:28:10.568 --> 00:28:12.910
How could bonds differ in their
nature?

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.480
Student:  Strength.
 

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.653
Prof: Single,
double, triple,

00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:17.150
right?
 

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.813
So, and you need to be able to
show isomers,

00:28:20.813 --> 00:28:23.539
which Berzelius couldn't show.
 

00:28:23.539 --> 00:28:25.528
Okay? So here's Lohschmidt.
 

00:28:25.528 --> 00:28:30.500
This is Lohschmidt's formula,
1861, for acetic acid.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.259
Can you understand it?
 

00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:40.119
Andrew, what do you say?
 

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:41.509
No hope.
 

00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:43.410
What do you think the stuff on
the left is?

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.599
Student:  CH_3.
 

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.299
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:47.599
Student:  CH_3.
 

00:28:47.599 --> 00:28:49.338
Prof: CH_3, right?
 

00:28:49.338 --> 00:28:51.930
So the size is something about
the weight, right?

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:52.819
So it's CH_3.
 

00:28:52.819 --> 00:28:55.250
What's it bonded to?
 

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.119
C; same size.
 

00:28:57.119 --> 00:28:58.460
What's it bonded to?
 

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.009
Student:  O.
 

00:29:00.009 --> 00:29:04.769
Prof: O, H;
and what's special?

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:05.650
Student:  Double bond.
 

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:06.820
Prof: Double bond.
 

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.210
So he's got a way of showing a
double bond, right?

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.720
So we can easily understand it.
 

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.098
Okay, now here's Crum-Brown.
 

00:29:14.098 --> 00:29:17.400
Now that's benzoic acid in
Crum-Brown's paper.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.619
So the COOH is even clearer
than it was in Loschmidt,

00:29:21.619 --> 00:29:22.269
right?
 

00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:23.430
What's a double and single bond.
 

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.369
The same thing we use now.
 

00:29:25.369 --> 00:29:26.180
Okay?
 

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.763
What's different is the C_6
part and five hydrogens attached

00:29:29.763 --> 00:29:30.250
to it.
 

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.578
But we don't really know how
the C_6 is arranged.

00:29:32.578 --> 00:29:35.627
Although he also showed this
one, for phenol,

00:29:35.627 --> 00:29:38.815
which is a benzene with a
hydroxyl group on it,

00:29:38.815 --> 00:29:39.299
OH.
 

00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:40.798
So there you see a ring.
 

00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:41.874
It's double,
single, double,

00:29:41.874 --> 00:29:42.868
single, double,
single;

00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:45.795
and H is attached to all the
carbons, except for one,

00:29:45.795 --> 00:29:46.640
which has OH.
 

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.819
So that's easy to understand.
 

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:48.608
Shai?
 

00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:50.720
Student:  Where does the
idea of double bonds come from?

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.518
I feel like it's just --
Prof: Because if you say

00:29:53.518 --> 00:29:56.123
carbon has four,
then you have to figure out

00:29:56.123 --> 00:29:57.759
where the fourth one is.
 

00:29:57.759 --> 00:29:58.328
Right?
 

00:29:58.328 --> 00:30:01.930
If it's associated with three
atoms, but can make four bonds;

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.920
it must make two to one of them.
 

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.980
That's the idea anyhow.
 

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.204
Or it could be that they go to
the center of the ring,

00:30:07.204 --> 00:30:08.339
the fourth one and so on.
 

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:09.930
There are other ideas too.
 

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:15.049
Okay, or here is a reaction in
Crum-Brown's notation.

00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:16.618
So it's an aldehyde.
 

00:30:16.618 --> 00:30:20.965
You add the HOMO of cyanide,
and a proton to the O,

00:30:20.965 --> 00:30:25.200
and you get that compound;
a cyanohydrin, as it's called.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.287
So this is almost identical --
what difference is it from our

00:30:29.287 --> 00:30:31.400
current, how different is it?
 

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.549
We don't draw circles around
the elements anymore;

00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:35.308
that makes it faster to draw.
 

00:30:35.308 --> 00:30:37.650
Otherwise it's essentially the
same.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.430
Okay?
 

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.823
Or here, he says there are two
kinds of alcohols:

00:30:41.823 --> 00:30:45.003
"true"
alcohol, which can lose water

00:30:45.003 --> 00:30:48.096
and give an olefin;
or olefin hydrate,

00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:51.930
which can lose water and give
the same olefin.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.280
What's the difference between
the true alcohol and the olefin

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:55.839
hydrate?
 

00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:59.789
How are they isomers?
 

00:30:59.789 --> 00:31:00.778
Russell?
 

00:31:00.778 --> 00:31:01.930
Student:  The position
of the OH.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.781
Prof: Right,
the position of the OH relative

00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:05.410
to the R.
 

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:05.883
Okay?
 

00:31:05.883 --> 00:31:09.009
So he's explaining isomers
here.

00:31:09.009 --> 00:31:10.130
So those are pretty good.
 

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.844
But Kekulé
says his is ever so much

00:31:12.844 --> 00:31:13.440
better.
 

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.059
This is Kekulé's
structure of benzene,

00:31:16.059 --> 00:31:17.430
from that same paper.
 

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.494
Remember he says at the end,
I'm going to give my superior

00:31:21.494 --> 00:31:22.278
formulas.
 

00:31:22.278 --> 00:31:24.019
So what in the heck is he
talking about?

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.650
Eric, you got any idea?
 

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.789
So what do you think that is?
 

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:42.130
Eric?
 

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.078
No idea?
 

00:31:45.078 --> 00:31:46.980
Well you don't have much to
work with in benzene.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.230
&gt;
 

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.170
What do you have?
 

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.940
Prof: It's C_6H_6. Right?
 

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.150
So that's got to either be
carbon or hydrogen.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:55.859
Which do you think?
 

00:31:55.859 --> 00:31:57.589
Student:  Hydrogen.
 

00:31:57.589 --> 00:32:00.170
Prof: The top left there.
 

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:00.740
No idea.
 

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.650
Anybody got an idea?
 

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:04.338
Why do you say carbon Kate?
 

00:32:04.338 --> 00:32:07.003
Student:  Yeah,
because that one's showing

00:32:07.003 --> 00:32:09.170
double and single bonds all
together.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.968
Prof: Ah,
it's showing up above here,

00:32:10.968 --> 00:32:13.478
the schematic one is showing
double bonds between carbons and

00:32:13.478 --> 00:32:15.596
then a single bond;
then a double bond and a single

00:32:15.596 --> 00:32:17.538
bond;
then a double bond.

00:32:17.538 --> 00:32:23.190
Well let's go -- that's open
chain, and this is closed chain.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.170
What are these arrows on the
end?

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.568
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:32:27.568 --> 00:32:30.421
Prof: Ah,
those are the ones that loop

00:32:30.421 --> 00:32:34.180
back and attach to one another,
somehow, to make a ring.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:34.559
Okay?
 

00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:38.587
Do you think he's trying to
give -- to imply Cartesian

00:32:38.587 --> 00:32:43.224
coordinates, for the location of
every atom, by where he draws

00:32:43.224 --> 00:32:44.670
these symbols?
 

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:45.933
Is he trying to show
x,y,z

00:32:45.933 --> 00:32:46.319
coordinates?
 

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.200
What do you think Nate?
 

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.059
Think he thinks he's showing
that, or not?

00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:57.339
Student:  I don't know.
 

00:32:57.339 --> 00:32:59.240
Student:  Which Nate?
 

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.598
Prof: Either of you.
 

00:33:00.598 --> 00:33:02.460
Student:  He's got
x,y.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.950
There, he's got an
x,y.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.116
Prof: Oh you could say,
right, here's an x-axis and

00:33:06.116 --> 00:33:06.838
there's a y-axis.
 

00:33:06.838 --> 00:33:08.821
He says at a certain point it's
that, that, that,

00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:09.358
that, that.
 

00:33:09.358 --> 00:33:12.366
Do you think he thinks that if
he had a microscope and could

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:15.068
see it, that's where those atoms
would be, in fact?

00:33:15.068 --> 00:33:17.380
Is it physical position he's
showing?

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.092
Student:  They look kind
of like

00:33:20.092 --> 00:33:21.876
&gt;
 

00:33:21.876 --> 00:33:22.519
to me.
 

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:25.430
Prof: Kelsey,
you got an idea?

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.143
Do you think he thinks he's
showing where these atoms are

00:33:29.143 --> 00:33:31.000
actually located in space?
 

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.230
What is he showing?
 

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.460
Yeah Sherwin?
 

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.009
Student:  The sequence.
 

00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:39.336
Prof: What's bonded to
what, and whether it's single

00:33:39.336 --> 00:33:40.220
bond or double bond.
 

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.685
He's showing Constitution,
the nature and sequence of

00:33:43.685 --> 00:33:45.744
bonds;
not positions of atoms,

00:33:45.744 --> 00:33:46.740
certainly not.
 

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.896
Okay, and then the little ones
are hydrogens,

00:33:48.896 --> 00:33:49.288
right?
 

00:33:49.288 --> 00:33:55.044
So the length of one of these
things is how many valences it

00:33:55.044 --> 00:33:55.630
has.
 

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.180
Right? Four long, for carbon;
only one long for hydrogen.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.480
And tangency then means a bond.
 

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:02.967
Right?
 

00:34:02.967 --> 00:34:07.400
So this is C-H double bond;
C-H single bond;

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.880
C-H double bond, and so on.
 

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.300
And then you get to the end,
you go back to the beginning.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.909
Okay?
 

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:19.576
Now he then shows chlorinated
benzene, because chlorine is

00:34:19.576 --> 00:34:21.050
also monovalent.
 

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.422
Right?
 

00:34:21.422 --> 00:34:24.719
So you can substitute for
hydrogen, and then you could

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.456
have dichlorobenzene too,
or tri-, or tetra-,

00:34:27.456 --> 00:34:28.389
and so on.
 

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:29.530
Right?
 

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.130
Now is he showing isomers here?
 

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:37.054
That is, in this case,
if you substituted this one for

00:34:37.054 --> 00:34:39.719
the chlorine,
instead of that one;

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.019
same thing or different things?
 

00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:49.416
If you believe that this was a
picture of things in space,

00:34:49.416 --> 00:34:51.090
they'd be different.
 

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:51.338
Right?
 

00:34:51.338 --> 00:34:53.786
But if all you're interested in
is what's connected to what,

00:34:53.786 --> 00:34:55.860
by single and double bonds,
then it's the same.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.260
You have the same pattern
either way.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.179
How about for the dichloro?
 

00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:03.980
Would there be isomers of that?
 

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.840
Student:  Yes.
 

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.139
Prof: Ah,
you could get different

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:06.739
sequence, right?
 

00:35:06.739 --> 00:35:10.045
They could be adjacent carbons
that have chlorines,

00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:12.360
or next adjacent,
or beyond that.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:12.722
Right?
 

00:35:12.722 --> 00:35:15.860
So you could use this system to
talk about isomers.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.289
So how many isomers?
 

00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:18.827
Now what do you think
Kekulé

00:35:18.827 --> 00:35:19.280
thought?
 

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.695
What do you think he thought
about how many isomers of

00:35:21.695 --> 00:35:22.880
chlorobenzene there are?
 

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.650
Do you think he thought there
was many?

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.949
Just what -- guess.
 

00:35:28.949 --> 00:35:31.750
I'm going to show you.
 

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.840
Okay, he thinks his system is
superior.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.605
Now he also used his system --
in this same paper he did a lot

00:35:38.605 --> 00:35:39.469
of formulas.
 

00:35:39.469 --> 00:35:40.929
But he showed these compounds.
 

00:35:40.929 --> 00:35:42.059
Like this one.
 

00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:45.050
What's that group, on the left?
 

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.440
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.789
Prof: What's the group
here?

00:35:51.789 --> 00:35:52.639
What is that?
 

00:35:52.639 --> 00:35:54.880
What's this atom?
 

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.210
CH_3.
 

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.829
What's this?
 

00:35:57.829 --> 00:36:03.900
CH_2. OH;
O is two units long, right?

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.239
So CH_3CH_2CH_2OH.
 

00:36:06.239 --> 00:36:10.130
Alcool propylique;
propyl alcohol.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.019
Now what's this one?
 

00:36:13.019 --> 00:36:20.940
CH_3_, CH_3, CH, OH.
 

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.550
It's alcool méthyle-&amp;
eacute;thylique;

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.969
methyl ethylic alcohol.
 

00:36:26.969 --> 00:36:29.340
So this would be ethyl alcohol,
the part on the top.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.179
But we've got a methyl
substituted in it.

00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:34.199
And notice, he's having to
change his formula,

00:36:34.199 --> 00:36:38.083
because now these are
horizontal tangencies that are

00:36:38.083 --> 00:36:40.206
bonds,
but this vertical tangency

00:36:40.206 --> 00:36:41.590
doesn't count as a bond.
 

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.949
So it's getting a little
complicated to explain to

00:36:43.949 --> 00:36:44.480
students.
 

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.840
Right?
 

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.119
Okay, what's the next one?
 

00:36:50.119 --> 00:36:53.190
CH_3.
 

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.980
What's this?
 

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.659
Prof: C double bond O.
 

00:36:57.659 --> 00:36:59.079
CH_3.
 

00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:02.030
So that's our old friend
acetone.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.519
And what's this one?
 

00:37:04.519 --> 00:37:06.150
CH_3.
 

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.579
CH-OH.
 

00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:10.760
Right?
 

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.500
CH_3.
 

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.230
Alcool acétonique.
 

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:19.460
So it's the alcohol you get by
adding two hydrogens to acetone.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.769
Now what do you think about
this?

00:37:20.769 --> 00:37:21.989
Do you see anything interesting?
 

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:29.639
This one is CH_3CHOHCH_3.
 

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:33.880
This one is CH_3CHCH_3OH.
 

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.969
Sophie, what do you say?
 

00:37:40.969 --> 00:37:43.489
Student:  They're the
same thing.

00:37:43.489 --> 00:37:45.728
Prof: Ah,
they're the same nature and

00:37:45.728 --> 00:37:46.769
sequence of bonds.
 

00:37:46.769 --> 00:37:48.340
Right? That one is what we know.
 

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.650
That's that one.
 

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.139
That one, that one.
 

00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:54.076
But the last,
and number twenty-eight here,

00:37:54.076 --> 00:37:57.570
are the same thing,
but he draws different formulas

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:58.480
for them.
 

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.340
So his system is not showing
isomerism properly.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.610
Right? He drew these different.
 

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.760
He didn't say that they were
the same.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:06.963
Right?
 

00:38:06.963 --> 00:38:08.289
And they were thought to be
different.

00:38:08.289 --> 00:38:10.541
Because when you do one -- when
you prepare it one way and when

00:38:10.541 --> 00:38:12.503
you prepare it another way,
you get a different boiling

00:38:12.503 --> 00:38:13.518
point say, or something.
 

00:38:13.518 --> 00:38:15.545
I actually don't know what the
data was, but there was some

00:38:15.545 --> 00:38:17.780
difference that said there were
these two different compounds.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.239
Did you ever get a wrong
boiling point?

00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:23.039
So did they.
 

00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:23.900
Right?
 

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.980
It just turned out the
experiment was wrong.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.639
But that shows that his system
is not as good as these other

00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:33.309
systems;
whatever he said.

00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:38.469
Okay, now how about physical
models of molecules?

00:38:38.469 --> 00:38:43.030
Well here's a great patent that
was issued by the U.S. Patent

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:46.603
Office to Samuel M. Gaines of
Glasgow, Kentucky,

00:38:46.603 --> 00:38:47.820
in 1868.
 

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.628
And we can read about his
description of what was so good

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:51.280
about this.
 

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.561
He says, "Now,
if a class thus instructed be

00:38:55.561 --> 00:39:00.289
at the recitation bench"
"and one of them is

00:39:00.289 --> 00:39:05.271
requested to form carbonic acid,
he will walk quickly to the

00:39:05.271 --> 00:39:08.126
table in front,
where the box is open,

00:39:08.126 --> 00:39:12.210
and place on one of the shelves
a cube marked 6,

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.900
and two marked 8.
 

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.039
Carbon, one, and oxygen,n two.
 

00:39:17.039 --> 00:39:20.856
If requested to form lime,
he will place on the shelf a

00:39:20.856 --> 00:39:23.753
cube marked 20,
(calcium,) and another one

00:39:23.753 --> 00:39:25.380
marked 8, (oxygen.)
 

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.050
these being the elements of
lime.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:31.505
These cubes being all placed in
contact, and the pupil being

00:39:31.505 --> 00:39:33.619
asked, 'What have we now?'
 

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:37.730
answers â€˜carbonate of
lime'."

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.329
Right?
 

00:39:39.329 --> 00:39:40.670
Okay.
 

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.755
"Another pupil may then be
asked to give the proximate

00:39:44.755 --> 00:39:47.079
analysis for carbonate of lime.
 

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:50.065
And the cubes before him will
indicate the answer and fix it

00:39:50.065 --> 00:39:52.190
in his memory:
â€˜It is composed of one

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:57.373
equivalent of carbonic acid,
(22) and one of lime,

00:39:57.373 --> 00:39:59.550
(28)'."
 

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.467
"Another may be requested
to give the ultimate analysis,

00:40:02.467 --> 00:40:05.190
and by the same means he is
furnished with the answer.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:08.545
â€˜Carbonic acid is
composed of one atom of carbon,

00:40:08.545 --> 00:40:11.094
two of oxygen,
and lime is composed of one

00:40:11.094 --> 00:40:13.518
atom of calcium and one of
oxygen.'

00:40:13.518 --> 00:40:16.190
The intelligent educator will
see at a glance,

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:21.110
that in this chemical alphabet
he has the means of at once

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:26.204
arresting the attention of his
class and converting what had

00:40:26.204 --> 00:40:31.469
hitherto been an irksome task
into a pleasant recreation.

00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:33.516
The atomic theory,
the characteristics of

00:40:33.516 --> 00:40:34.978
affinity,
the law of multiple

00:40:34.978 --> 00:40:37.436
proportions, the nomenclature,
isomerism, etc.,

00:40:37.436 --> 00:40:41.159
may all be learned in half the
time required heretofore,

00:40:41.159 --> 00:40:45.389
and learned so as not likely
ever to be forgotten."

00:40:45.389 --> 00:40:46.849
Now what do you think?
 

00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:49.719
Would this show the atomic
theory that molecules are

00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:51.969
substances that are composed of
atoms?

00:40:51.969 --> 00:40:53.179
Does it show it?
 

00:40:53.179 --> 00:40:54.510
Student:  Yes.
 

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.090
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:58.639
Okay, how about the
characteristics of affinity;

00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:00.152
single, double,
triple bond,

00:41:00.152 --> 00:41:01.889
valence and so on,
show that?

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.590
Not in any obvious way that I
can see.

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.018
So I doubt that one.
 

00:41:10.018 --> 00:41:14.460
How about the law of multiple
proportions?

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.110
Remember what the law of
multiple proportions was?

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.617
You have the same elements --
if you have a parts of A and b

00:41:20.617 --> 00:41:22.818
parts of B, and so on,
all that stuff,

00:41:22.818 --> 00:41:24.960
then what AD will be,
and so on.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.900
Yes Max?
 

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.235
Student:  Why did
Kekulé

00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:28.679
only show one oxygen,
in his notation?

00:41:28.679 --> 00:41:29.579
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:31.233
Student:  Did
Kekulé

00:41:31.233 --> 00:41:33.289
know what the exact mass of
oxygen was?

00:41:33.289 --> 00:41:34.619
Because he only had one in his
notation.

00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:36.786
Prof: Yes,
but notice everything here is

00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:37.210
halved.
 

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:38.320
Student:  Oh okay.
 

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.940
Prof: So it's okay,
the right proportions,

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.710
right?
 

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.018
Okay?
 

00:41:44.018 --> 00:41:47.179
But multiple proportions,
you have to know something

00:41:47.179 --> 00:41:50.960
about how many of one associates
with how many of another;

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.409
which isn't obvious here.
 

00:41:53.409 --> 00:41:54.289
Okay?
 

00:41:54.289 --> 00:41:56.250
Nomenclature?
 

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:59.670
Well maybe, calcium oxide and
so on, CO_2.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:03.710
Isomerism, that you can have
the same things differently

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:04.518
arranged?
 

00:42:04.518 --> 00:42:07.286
Well obviously you can put the
blocks on top of one another or

00:42:07.286 --> 00:42:08.239
beside one another.
 

00:42:08.239 --> 00:42:10.269
But how do you know how many
you should do?

00:42:10.269 --> 00:42:11.139
Right?
 

00:42:11.139 --> 00:42:13.559
Not very clear to me that this
system works well.

00:42:13.559 --> 00:42:17.650
So those models are good for
some things, but not good for an

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.150
awful lot of things.
 

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.940
Okay, now James Dewar in
Scotland, a student,

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.420
had the idea of using brass
strips to show models.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.088
And, in fact,
he could put these black balls

00:42:30.088 --> 00:42:30.400
on.
 

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.139
He said, "To make the
combination look like an atom,

00:42:33.139 --> 00:42:36.971
a thin round disc of blackened
brass can be placed under the

00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:38.268
central nut."
 

00:42:38.268 --> 00:42:40.755
I think that's really cute,
to "look like an

00:42:40.755 --> 00:42:43.500
atom," as if he knew what
an atom looked like.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.920
Right?
 

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.193
Okay, so then he drew -- he
made these models from his

00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:53.659
strips of possible structures of
benzene.

00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:53.927
Right?
 

00:42:53.927 --> 00:42:56.423
You can see where the atoms
are, and the four valences on

00:42:56.423 --> 00:42:57.983
every carbon,
and what they -- which

00:42:57.983 --> 00:42:59.010
direction they go.
 

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.014
That particular one,
that compound,

00:43:01.014 --> 00:43:03.724
that structure,
was actually prepared about 100

00:43:03.724 --> 00:43:07.380
years later, and when it was,
it was called Dewar benzene.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.429
Right?
 

00:43:08.429 --> 00:43:09.518
That one's interesting.
 

00:43:09.518 --> 00:43:13.217
It's got a four-center bond,
four carbons all sharing the

00:43:13.217 --> 00:43:14.010
same bond.
 

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.690
Right?
 

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:18.682
Hofmann, the guy,
remember, who was good at

00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:22.969
language and was in London;
his last lecture in London was

00:43:22.969 --> 00:43:26.891
at the Royal Institution,
the place where Faraday was,

00:43:26.891 --> 00:43:31.849
and where Davy had been and did
the experiments on electrolysis.

00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:36.304
So he gave this public lecture
where he used croquet balls for

00:43:36.304 --> 00:43:38.764
atom models,
with sticks stuck in them,

00:43:38.764 --> 00:43:42.092
and he colored them,
and the system he chose is the

00:43:42.092 --> 00:43:45.353
one we still use for what color
the atoms are:

00:43:45.353 --> 00:43:47.920
white for hydrogen,
red for oxygen,

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.139
blue for nitrogen,
black for carbon.

00:43:50.139 --> 00:43:51.429
Okay?
 

00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:53.260
So here's part of the lecture
he gave.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.789
So he would build molecules
before your very eyes.

00:43:56.789 --> 00:43:58.936
He'd start with a hydrogen,
put an oxygen on,

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:02.250
and another hydrogen;
lo, he's made water.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.460
Right?
 

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:08.159
Or he could make marsh gas,
methane.

00:44:08.159 --> 00:44:12.500
Or he could show the oxides of
HCl.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.344
So you start with HCl,
but he could take it apart and

00:44:15.344 --> 00:44:17.751
put an oxygen in between,
or put two oxygens,

00:44:17.751 --> 00:44:19.940
or three or four oxygens in
between.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.005
You'd go from hydrochloric to
hypochlorous to chlorous to

00:44:23.005 --> 00:44:24.320
chloric to perchloric.
 

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.936
So this is like Lavoisier,
going to different levels of

00:44:27.936 --> 00:44:28.739
oxidation.
 

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:31.099
Unfortunately,
those aren't the structures.

00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:31.474
Right?
 

00:44:31.474 --> 00:44:35.231
What really happens is that the
unshared pair of chlorine can

00:44:35.231 --> 00:44:39.052
share with oxygen to give this,
which is the active ingredient

00:44:39.052 --> 00:44:40.429
in Clorox bleach.
 

00:44:40.429 --> 00:44:44.333
Or you can use another unshared
pair of chlorine to put another

00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:44.900
oxygen.
 

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.164
Or another for another,
and get the oxidizing agent

00:44:48.164 --> 00:44:50.579
that Gay-Lussac used,
the chlorate.

00:44:50.579 --> 00:44:52.300
Or you can put a last one.
 

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.518
And this is an explosive.
 

00:44:53.518 --> 00:44:57.333
In fact, ammonium perchlorate,
AP, is a component of military

00:44:57.333 --> 00:44:58.159
explosives.
 

00:44:58.159 --> 00:45:01.125
Notice that in Hofmann's thing
you could've put fifteen oxygens

00:45:01.125 --> 00:45:03.469
in a row if you could have
reached high enough.

00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:07.789
But you can only go to four
here, because that's how many

00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:11.800
unshared-pairs chlorine has --
choride has to use.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:17.949
Okay, but then he showed the
chlorination of marsh gas.

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:20.268
So monochlorinated,
dichlorinated,

00:45:20.268 --> 00:45:23.639
trichlorinated and
tetrachlorinated marsh gas.

00:45:23.639 --> 00:45:27.525
Now this is interesting because
for the dichloro,

00:45:27.525 --> 00:45:32.139
you could imagine having two
isomers with these models.

00:45:32.139 --> 00:45:32.548
Right?
 

00:45:32.548 --> 00:45:36.989
The chlorines could be near one
another or opposite one another.

00:45:36.989 --> 00:45:38.809
Right?
 

00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:43.614
Now some years later there was
an exhibition in London and they

00:45:43.614 --> 00:45:45.630
showed molecular models.
 

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.340
By this time Hofmann was back
in Germany.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:52.969
But they got a guy in Spain to
make some Hofmann-style models.

00:45:52.969 --> 00:45:57.320
Manuel Gonzalez Rodriguez from
Madrid made this set.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:03.610
And here's chloromethane made
from that set.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:06.947
What's the difference between
these -- it says "according

00:46:06.947 --> 00:46:08.751
to Hofmann"
here, "Segun

00:46:08.751 --> 00:46:10.119
A.W. Hofmann".
 

00:46:10.119 --> 00:46:11.039
Right?
 

00:46:11.039 --> 00:46:13.380
What's the difference?
 

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.909
Alex?
 

00:46:14.909 --> 00:46:18.440
Student:  Bonds on the
carbon aren't just- aren't

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.110
90° from each other.
 

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:21.599
Prof: They're not
90° from one another.

00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:23.590
They're 109.5°
from one another.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:26.619
It's a tetrahedron,
not a square plane.

00:46:26.619 --> 00:46:27.079
Right?
 

00:46:27.079 --> 00:46:29.989
Now what does that say about
isomers?

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:32.000
So suppose we substitute
another chlorine.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.050
There's a dichloro;
there's a different dichloro;

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:37.489
there's a different dichloro.
 

00:46:37.489 --> 00:46:38.690
How about it?
 

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:40.230
Student:  No.
 

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.780
Prof: They're just
rotated from another.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.940
They're not different, right?
 

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.956
So depending on whether it's
square plane or tetrahedral,

00:46:46.956 --> 00:46:49.219
you'll get different numbers of
isomers.

00:46:49.219 --> 00:46:53.079
That's neat,
because it gives you a tool for

00:46:53.079 --> 00:46:57.659
telling whether it's square
plane or tetrahedral.

00:46:57.659 --> 00:46:58.192
Right?
 

00:46:58.192 --> 00:47:01.739
So you can get structure from
analysis.

00:47:01.739 --> 00:47:05.914
So, but these constitutional
models try to show the nature

00:47:05.914 --> 00:47:10.016
and sequence of bonds for
Hofmann, not the arrangement in

00:47:10.016 --> 00:47:11.902
space;
and not for Hofmann,

00:47:11.902 --> 00:47:14.440
and not for the guy that made
these models.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.469
They weren't trying to explain
isomers in that way.

00:47:17.469 --> 00:47:19.713
All they were trying to show
was the same thing you draw in

00:47:19.713 --> 00:47:21.452
these pictures:
the nature and the sequence of

00:47:21.452 --> 00:47:23.001
bonds;
whether they're single or

00:47:23.001 --> 00:47:24.907
double, triple,
and what's associated with

00:47:24.907 --> 00:47:25.280
what.
 

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.934
So that comes a little later,
trying to get to the

00:47:28.934 --> 00:47:30.650
arrangement in space.
 

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:33.306
But the pièce de
résistance of

00:47:33.306 --> 00:47:36.335
Hofmann's lecture was this:
that if you take these croquet

00:47:36.335 --> 00:47:38.619
ball models and make the
olefiant gas,

00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:41.902
which we talked about last
time, it's got two spare

00:47:41.902 --> 00:47:44.204
valences,
and if you add chlorine you can

00:47:44.204 --> 00:47:47.110
get the dutch liquid,
the dichloroethane.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.829
But remember what we saw last
time.

00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:51.005
He called olefiant gas
"unfinished"

00:47:51.005 --> 00:47:54.405
or "not saturated";
we now call it an unsaturated

00:47:54.405 --> 00:47:55.050
molecule.
 

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.639
And it's reactive because of
these dangling valences.

00:47:57.639 --> 00:47:59.619
And we now know why it's that
way.

00:47:59.619 --> 00:48:01.110
That he's got the wrong
structure;

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:05.090
it should be CH_2CH_2,
not CHCH_3.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.440
And we know about HOMOs and
LUMOs now.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.168
But that was what he really
showed, was that the model had

00:48:10.168 --> 00:48:12.610
something completely new that no
one anticipated.

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.889
It could explain what,
that's new?

00:48:16.889 --> 00:48:21.260
What new qualities has he
associated with the models?

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.889
What elements are there,
what ratio they're in.

00:48:24.889 --> 00:48:25.710
Right?
 

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:27.407
How they're linked to one
another, single,

00:48:27.407 --> 00:48:28.360
double, triple bonds.
 

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.579
What's he adding?
 

00:48:31.579 --> 00:48:33.610
Reactivity.
 

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:34.679
Right?
 

00:48:34.679 --> 00:48:35.480
So it's something new.
 

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.543
So the whole history is adding
new things, new properties to

00:48:38.543 --> 00:48:39.219
the models.
 

00:48:39.219 --> 00:48:40.650
And there are more to come.
 

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:45.150
Okay.
 

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.000
Okay, that's it.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.968
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Is private ritual

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:07.310
possible?
This is a kind of oxymoron,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.316
"a private ritual," because
ritual is, or should be,

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:17.420
precisely something that's
collective and shared.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.707
Is it possible for the
individual to produce some kind

00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:31.307
of shared patterning of
experience such as ritual

00:00:31.307 --> 00:00:35.134
represents?
For Freud, who is,

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:40.329
of course, a thinker in the
background of The Waste

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.309
Land and all of the poetry
that we're reading and thinking

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.798
about this semester,
private ritual meant neurosis,

00:00:52.798 --> 00:00:58.990
sickness of a kind,
some kind of derangement.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.082
And indeed, The Waste
Land, which is a poem that

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:09.739
in certain ways tries to imagine
a form of private ritual,

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:14.337
or at least struggles with this
question, was certainly

00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:18.680
considered by some readers to be
a neurotic poem.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.471
I began last time by talking
about that first verse paragraph

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:30.020
of the poem.
Why don't we go back there.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.290
That's on 474 in our anthology.
 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.190
 
 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.228
I'll try to talk about the poem
in sequence from first section

00:01:46.228 --> 00:01:52.266
to last and at least tell you
some of the ways in which I make

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:55.482
sense of it.
And this may be,

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.930
I hope, helpful to you.
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.388
In this first section,
"The Burial of the Dead," we

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:12.654
have, well, what I think of as a
series of preliminary statements

00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:17.949
about the poem's aims:
what it seeks,

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:23.400
what it would gesture towards
or move towards.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.060
They include,
well, some form of ecstasy.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.589
I think Marie's sled ride is an
experience of personal freedom

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.729
in its modest way.
 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:42.590
"In the mountains,
there you feel free," she says,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.940
recalling that experience.
 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.574
Prophecy.
The poem introduces us to

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:55.630
prophecy in the second verse
paragraph.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.400
Freedom, I suppose.
 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.987
Intimacy between people,
some kind of meaningful

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:09.982
coherence.
All of these possibilities of

00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:14.780
experience are,
as it were, glimpsed in the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.834
poem in this beginning,
glimpsed and then withdrawn or

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:23.689
blocked or parodied.
 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:29.844
Marie's sled:
well, isn't that a kind of

00:03:29.844 --> 00:03:37.891
figure for letting go and,
well, for release and for

00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:42.340
trust?
An experience,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.849
as I say, of freedom.
 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.710
Ultimately, in "What the
Thunder Said," the poem will

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:01.758
again return to those specific
themes when it interprets those

00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:09.039
Sanskrit words Datta,
Dayadhvam, and so on.

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:15.023
Well, in the second paragraph
of the poem – a sort of second

00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:20.515
strophe, if you like – we're
introduced to this sort of

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:22.870
wasteland landscape.
 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.458
It's a kind of landscape that
the poem returns to at different

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:31.916
points.
What are the roots that

00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:35.360
clutch, what branches grow
Out of this stony rubbish?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.886
Son of man,
You cannot say,

00:04:37.886 --> 00:04:41.515
or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images,

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:45.213
where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no

00:04:45.213 --> 00:04:50.212
shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of

00:04:50.212 --> 00:04:51.420
water.
 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.399
 
 

00:04:55.399 --> 00:05:01.453
Here, well, we have a kind of
symbolic representation,

00:05:01.453 --> 00:05:06.479
a kind of modernist
iconography, if you like,

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.620
of a spiritual state,
one of desiccation.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.101
It is, as it were,
a kind of picture of the mental

00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:21.680
space inhabited by the people
that we'll meet in this poem.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.938
Well, there are quotations
here, your notes from Eliot and

00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:34.160
then your editor explain,
from Ezekiel.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.802
The poem is drawing on
prophetic language and giving

00:05:39.802 --> 00:05:42.790
its own form of prophecy.
 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.209
But Ezekiel here is secularized
in this context.

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:55.279
And you might look at this as
something more like a quotation

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.730
from prophecy rather than
prophecy itself.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.218
Here, the poem's general
concern with a spiritual state

00:06:06.218 --> 00:06:12.347
that – let me call it the
withdrawal of God – is

00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:16.502
represented,
as I say, as dryness,

00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:20.009
as dryness and as
fragmentation.

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.357
What we have is "stony rubbish.
 

00:06:22.357 --> 00:06:22.660
.
.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.529
/ a heap of broken images,
where the sun beats."

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:31.457
Here, you know,
we've got a kind of fragment of

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:34.190
sacred text, itself,
you know,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.748
if you like,
a bit of rubbish that's part of

00:06:40.748 --> 00:06:49.290
the poem's heap of broken images
that we will explore.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:56.632
The withdrawal of God in the
poem is a kind of fall into

00:06:56.632 --> 00:07:02.639
fragmentation where experience
doesn't cohere,

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:09.391
where there's dryness;
there's no connectivity,

00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:12.400
there's not fluidity.
 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:20.290
The poem then moves abruptly.
 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.290
And the poem,
you know, it moves at this kind

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.108
of exhilarating abruptness
throughout between kinds of

00:07:29.108 --> 00:07:34.324
language;
here, introducing Wagner and a

00:07:34.324 --> 00:07:42.930
little quotation from a quatrain
from the libretto for Tristan

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:48.040
und Isolde,
translated for us:

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.600
Fresh blows the wind
To the homeland;

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.690
My Irish darling,
Where are you waiting?

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:04.038
Isolde hears this song,
and it's a kind of,

00:08:04.038 --> 00:08:15.060
well, song of longing as she
goes off to marry the wrong man.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:21.007
This Wagner text and the little
quotation from it down below –

00:08:21.007 --> 00:08:24.689
again, another quotation from
Wagner,

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:32.215
"Oed' und leer das Meer" – is
a more sinister and haunting

00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:36.679
phrase that may be translated
as,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:41.897
"waste and empty the sea" or
"desolate and empty the sea"

00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:45.690
here.
This frames a little vignette,

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.667
a little scene,
a dialogue or part of a

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:55.320
dialogue: "'You gave me
hyacinths first a year ago;

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.759
/ They called me the hyacinth
girl.'"

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:05.364
And then out of that quotation,
the poem now speaks to us,

00:09:05.364 --> 00:09:11.389
as it were, more directly
without quotation marks.

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:14.580
-- Yet when we came back,
late from the hyacinth garden,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.789
Your arms full,
and your hair wet,

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:20.344
I could not
Speak, and my eyes failed,

00:09:20.344 --> 00:09:22.621
I was neither
Living nor dead,

00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:25.066
and I knew nothing,
Looking into the heart of

00:09:25.066 --> 00:09:30.805
light, the silence.
A kind of ecstatic vision,

00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:39.850
but here one of a certain,
perhaps frightening emptiness

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:46.689
where a couple,
presumably, have had some kind

00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:53.800
of exchange that leaves the
speaker with this particular

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.490
vision of the heart of light and
silence.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.500
The references to the flower,
the hyacinth,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:11.418
call up the whole system of
images of April and spring that

00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:17.360
the poem will play on,
as well as the story of

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.299
Hyacinth from The
Metamorphoses.

00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:27.608
And your editor here will
explain that "Apollo loved and

00:10:27.608 --> 00:10:32.585
accidentally killed Hyacinth;
from his blood sprang the

00:10:32.585 --> 00:10:36.715
flower named for him,
inscribed with ‘AI,' a cry of

00:10:36.715 --> 00:10:42.788
grief."
Here, love is associated with

00:10:42.788 --> 00:10:54.073
killing and also with a kind of
generation, though of a painful

00:10:54.073 --> 00:10:58.259
and disturbing kind.
 

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:03.580
Here the general,
you know, wasteland space,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:09.889
with what I'm calling the space
of God's absence,

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:16.492
becomes a space between two
people, two lovers and,

00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:22.169
it seems, some form of missed
connection.

00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:25.338
As a sequence,
these lines I've just been

00:11:25.338 --> 00:11:28.428
talking about,
like the poem as a whole,

00:11:28.428 --> 00:11:30.250
advance by collage.
 

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.039
They make a kind of argument.
 

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:36.100
They make a kind of sense,
but perhaps not in the ways

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.710
that we're used to.
 

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:43.002
These materials together,
I think, suggest that the loss

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:48.776
of common experience that comes
with the withdrawal of God is

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:54.550
played out between people in
their erotic relationships.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.360
Where God was, sex is.
 

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.154
Or you could say that the loss
of collective and sharable

00:12:03.154 --> 00:12:08.463
meanings, which results in the
privacy of our mental experience

00:12:08.463 --> 00:12:11.713
– our dreams,
our aspirations,

00:12:11.713 --> 00:12:15.570
memories, poems,
difficult poems – is

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:21.659
represented here in this poem by
the irreducibly private,

00:12:21.659 --> 00:12:26.450
and therefore anguishing,
nature of sexuality.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:33.333
And this is a theme that the
poem will return to again and

00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:37.495
again.
Instead of reciprocity and some

00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:43.371
kind of mutuality in human
relations, we find people doing

00:12:43.371 --> 00:12:49.350
kinds of violence to each other,
dominating each other;

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:55.519
finding incompleteness in their
unions.

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:58.888
The poem then moves on,
again, with a kind of

00:12:58.888 --> 00:13:02.409
exhilarating shift of register
or reference,

00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:05.504
to a comic figure,
"Madame Sosostris,

00:13:05.504 --> 00:13:08.769
famous clarvoyante" with a bad
cold.

00:13:08.769 --> 00:13:15.980
I think of Madame Sosostris
often in the winter.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:21.525
She is nevertheless "known to
be the wisest woman in Europe,"

00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:25.130
and she had "a wicked pack of
cards."

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.840
What does she produce?
 

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.692
Well: Here, said she,
Is your card,

00:13:30.692 --> 00:13:32.460
the drowned Phoenician Sailor.
 

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.980
[Who is "you"?
Perhaps ourselves,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:43.303
the reader; perhaps the poet.]
(Those are pearls that were his

00:13:43.303 --> 00:13:44.059
eyes.
Look!)

00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:47.750
Here is Belladonna,
the Lady of the Rocks,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.230
The lady of situations.
 

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:52.338
Here is the man with three
staves, and here the

00:13:52.338 --> 00:13:55.179
Wheel…
And so on.

00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:59.270
And something that she is
forbidden to see:

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.300
I do not find
The Hanged Man.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.090
Fear death by water.
 

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.350
I see crowds of people,
walking round in a ring.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:12.269
Thank you.
If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:14.769
Tell her I bring the horoscope
myself:

00:14:14.769 --> 00:14:18.330
One must be so careful these
days.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.279
This is a wonderful passage.
 

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:24.909
Here, it's doing a number of
different things.

00:14:24.909 --> 00:14:31.282
The horoscope seems like a kind
of debased modern form of--a

00:14:31.282 --> 00:14:37.547
modern system of interpretation,
a way of understanding the

00:14:37.547 --> 00:14:41.023
self.
There is, in these lines,

00:14:41.023 --> 00:14:46.230
a kind of parody of occultism,
which would include,

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.861
perhaps, a parody of Yeats,
although Yeats's Vision

00:14:50.861 --> 00:14:52.730
wasn't published yet.
 

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.386
At the same time,
even while the poem is parodic,

00:14:56.386 --> 00:14:59.508
it's serious,
too, because in this kind of

00:14:59.508 --> 00:15:03.298
ad hoc,
somewhat fanciful and crazy

00:15:03.298 --> 00:15:08.672
way, Madame Sosostris's cards
are producing images that Eliot

00:15:08.672 --> 00:15:13.866
is dealing us and that he will
collect in the course of the

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:19.509
poem and try to make some sense
of in the collage that is The

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:23.936
Waste Land,
including among those cards the

00:15:23.936 --> 00:15:28.296
drowned Phoenician sailor who
will return for us in that

00:15:28.296 --> 00:15:31.070
little section "Death by Water."
 

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.580
 
 

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:41.052
Well, I like to think of Eliot
himself as Mrs.

00:15:41.052 --> 00:15:44.764
Equitone.
That is because he's so

00:15:44.764 --> 00:15:49.308
difficult to read in his tone,
and after all,

00:15:49.308 --> 00:15:51.476
it's, in a sense,
Mrs.

00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:57.568
Equitone who is getting this
stuff and is going to try to do

00:15:57.568 --> 00:16:00.149
something with it.
 

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:07.091
Well, Part I,
"The Burial of the Dead," ends

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:13.710
with another instance of
scene-setting.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:19.694
Now, this sort of symbolic
iconography of the dry landscape

00:16:19.694 --> 00:16:24.234
is going to be overlaid on
another landscape,

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:27.639
which is metropolitan London.
 

00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:33.843
"Unreal City":
this is Eliot's evocative name

00:16:33.843 --> 00:16:40.470
for the urban space that the
poem represents.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.702
Unreal city,
Under the brown fog of a winter

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:46.173
dawn,
A crowd flowed over London

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:49.583
Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had

00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:53.573
undone so many.
Sighs, short and infrequent,

00:16:53.573 --> 00:16:57.218
were exhaled,
And each man fixed his eyes

00:16:57.218 --> 00:17:01.255
before his feet.
Flowed up the hill and down [in

00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:04.630
a rhyming couplet]
King William Street,

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.470
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth
kept the hours

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.579
With a dead sound on the final
stroke of nine.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.137
You go to the note,
and Eliot says,

00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:18.499
"A phenomenon which I have
often noticed," just in case you

00:17:18.499 --> 00:17:22.410
were wondering whether he's in
the scene or not.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:29.756
Well, here we are being
introduced to the metropolis,

00:17:29.756 --> 00:17:35.973
which, as I say,
is the scene of The Waste

00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:40.474
Land.
It's where the events of the

00:17:40.474 --> 00:17:43.900
poem will take place,
more or less.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:50.261
What we're seeing here are
people going to work,

00:17:50.261 --> 00:17:55.539
people that we're going to see
later,

00:17:55.539 --> 00:18:00.003
in effect, in the poem:
the typist and "the young man

00:18:00.003 --> 00:18:05.924
carbuncular" must be crossing,
too, or the people that we'll

00:18:05.924 --> 00:18:08.880
meet in the pub and so on.
 

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.510
There's a kind of strange
mixing here of the dead and the

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:19.940
living, of the apocalyptic and
the utterly ordinary.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:25.356
Eliot then moves with,
you know, again,

00:18:25.356 --> 00:18:31.823
no framing that would help us:
There I saw one I knew

00:18:31.823 --> 00:18:35.539
[and then who of course is this
"I" who is speaking to us?

00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:39.170
We don't really know],
and stopped him,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.680
crying:
"Stetson!

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.140
"You who were with me in the
ships at Mylae!

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.250
"That corpse you planted last
year in your garden,

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.820
"Has it begun to sprout?
 

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.910
Will it bloom this year?
 

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.937
[A hyacinth perhaps?]
"Or has the sudden frost

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:57.819
disturbed its bed?
 

00:18:57.819 --> 00:19:00.970
"O keep the Dog far hence,
that's friend to men,

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.760
"Or with his nails he'll dig it
up again!

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.994
"You!
hypocrite lecteur!--mon

00:19:05.994 --> 00:19:10.723
semblable,--mon frère!"
He says, quoting Baudelaire,

00:19:10.723 --> 00:19:14.190
at the very end bursting out
with it.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:19.173
It's a, again,
fascinating turn that the poem

00:19:19.173 --> 00:19:22.211
takes.
There is, perhaps,

00:19:22.211 --> 00:19:29.200
a kind of glimpse of the still
echoing World War in the here

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:36.069
imagined hailing of one man who
knew another in battle.

00:19:36.069 --> 00:19:47.690
That is, the ships at Mylae
where they last met.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.940
 
 

00:19:50.940 --> 00:20:01.849
There's here another instance
of exchange between two people.

00:20:01.849 --> 00:20:10.639
Here, there's a way in which
that first person's address to

00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:16.819
Stetson plays upon or parodies,
if you like,

00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:21.539
the poet's relation to you or
to me the reader.

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:28.365
There's here a general problem
or question of how to make each

00:20:28.365 --> 00:20:35.415
other out, how to recognize and
acknowledge the relation between

00:20:35.415 --> 00:20:44.237
brothers or "semblables,"
as Baudelaire would have us

00:20:44.237 --> 00:20:50.720
call them.
The little glimpse of war and

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.819
the war dead,
perhaps, that we get in these

00:20:56.819 --> 00:21:05.821
lines will throughout the rest
of the poem turn into a post-war

00:21:05.821 --> 00:21:11.181
vision of,
again, war between the sexes

00:21:11.181 --> 00:21:17.203
and war between people,
most immediately in "A Game of

00:21:17.203 --> 00:21:20.717
Chess."
In this second section,

00:21:20.717 --> 00:21:24.748
which is built around two
conversations,

00:21:24.748 --> 00:21:29.916
the first takes place in a
well-to-do drawing room,

00:21:29.916 --> 00:21:32.500
the second in a pub.
 

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:40.157
There's much to contemplate in
the opening description of that

00:21:40.157 --> 00:21:48.191
home, where we'll hear these two
characters speaking and thinking

00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:52.977
in a moment.
One that is important and

00:21:52.977 --> 00:21:59.755
recurs often in the scene--one
detail that recurs often in the

00:21:59.755 --> 00:22:05.200
poem, is the image of Philomel
around line 98.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.005
"As though a window" --oh,
excuse me.

00:22:07.005 --> 00:22:10.346
Let me go a little bit further:
Above the antique mantel

00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:13.356
was displayed
As though a window gave upon

00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:17.140
the sylvan scene
The change of Philomel [another

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.560
Ovidian metamorphosis],
by the

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.883
barbarous king
So rudely forced [Philomel

00:22:24.883 --> 00:22:33.760
raped by Tereus is transformed
into the nightingale];

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.775
yet there the nightingale
Filled all the desert with

00:22:37.775 --> 00:22:41.413
inviolable voice…
Suddenly, Eliot has brought us

00:22:41.413 --> 00:22:44.630
into this dining room to see
this picture,

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.847
and now we're in the picture
listening to the nightingale

00:22:48.847 --> 00:22:52.689
filling all the desert,
this wasteland space,

00:22:52.689 --> 00:22:56.421
with a kind of,
again, song of complaint,

00:22:56.421 --> 00:23:01.740
a kind of lyric voice that's
called here "inviolable."

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:06.140
…And still she cried,
and still the world pursues,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.099
"Jug Jug" to dirty ears.
"Jug Jug" being the

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:16.628
conventional representation of
the nightingale's song in

00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:18.839
Elizabethan poetry.
 

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:22.761
Well, this is,
you know, again,

00:23:22.761 --> 00:23:30.343
an image of sexual violence
that produces a particular kind

00:23:30.343 --> 00:23:33.349
of lyric utterance.
 

00:23:33.349 --> 00:23:38.957
It is a kind of motif that
recurs in the poem,

00:23:38.957 --> 00:23:46.185
and it's also a way of imaging
the poem itself as a kind of

00:23:46.185 --> 00:23:53.413
"inviolable voice" that emerges
from some kind of vision of

00:23:53.413 --> 00:23:56.279
erotic violation.
 

00:23:56.279 --> 00:24:01.034
In the conversation that
follows, if it's a conversation,

00:24:01.034 --> 00:24:05.959
what we have is one speaker
speaking in quotation marks and

00:24:05.959 --> 00:24:09.950
the other speaking without
quotation marks.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.950
What does that mean?
 

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:18.153
Presumably, the one speaker
that we overhear that seems to

00:24:18.153 --> 00:24:22.180
be female, we're hearing her
speak.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:26.541
When those quotation marks
disappear, probably for the

00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:29.915
man's speech,
that would seem to represent

00:24:29.915 --> 00:24:32.960
some kind of interiorized
speech,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.550
some kind of thought:
"My nerves are bad

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:37.850
to-night.
Yes, bad.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.660
Stay with me.
"Speak to me.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.300
Why do you never speak.
 

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.670
Speak.
"What are you thinking of?

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.539
What thinking?
What?

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:47.380
"I never know what you are
thinking.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.450
Think."
I think we are in rats' alley

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.390
Where the dead men lost their
bones.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.190
"What is that noise?"
 

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.550
The wind under the door.
 

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.440
"What is that noise now?
 

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.340
What is the wind doing?"
 

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.390
Nothing again nothing.
 

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.220
[Another phrase that will recur
in the poem.]

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.380
"Do "You know nothing?
 

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.890
Do you see nothing?
 

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.840
Do you remember
"Nothing?"

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.401
I remember
Those are pearls that were his

00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:22.550
eyes.
"Are you alive, or not?

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.290
Is there nothing in your head?"
 

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.040
But
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.420
--
It's so elegant

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.240
So intelligent
"What shall I do now?

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.170
What shall I do?"
 

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.744
[Quotations there from
Prufrock,

00:25:37.744 --> 00:25:40.353
right?]
"I shall rush out as I am,

00:25:40.353 --> 00:25:44.180
and walk the street
"With my hair down, so.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.519
[Here Prufrock's
questions are being answered

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:48.490
perhaps.]
What shall we do tomorrow?

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.310
"What shall we ever do?"
 

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.869
The hot water at ten.
 

00:25:51.869 --> 00:25:54.859
And if it rains,
a closed car at four.

00:25:54.859 --> 00:25:57.119
And we shall play a game of
chess,

00:25:57.119 --> 00:26:01.303
Pressing lidless eyes and
waiting for a knock upon the

00:26:01.303 --> 00:26:06.280
door.
This is often understood as a

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.319
version of an evening at the
Eliots.

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:17.589
The female speaker is being
satirized, surely.

00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:22.166
She's frightening,
but surely also is her

00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:26.490
companion.
They're driving each other mad.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.579
It's a kind of folie a
deux.

00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:36.430
The first person here speaks
for a kind of state that other

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:42.481
people experience in the poem
and that other first-persons in

00:26:42.481 --> 00:26:47.726
this poem experience:
that is the condition of having

00:26:47.726 --> 00:26:52.949
nothing in your head;
"nothing" almost constituting

00:26:52.949 --> 00:26:56.882
"something";
again, "nothing" being a kind

00:26:56.882 --> 00:26:59.883
of wasteland.
But in that wasteland,

00:26:59.883 --> 00:27:03.096
nevertheless,
there persist certain kinds of

00:27:03.096 --> 00:27:05.786
rubbish, fragments,
bits of language,

00:27:05.786 --> 00:27:09.000
as in Prufrock's
consciousness.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.366
And this speaker recalls,
first of all,

00:27:12.366 --> 00:27:16.265
when pressed,
"Those are pearls that were his

00:27:16.265 --> 00:27:20.430
eyes": a quotation from The
Tempest,

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:29.857
a quotation from Ariel's song
that holds out some image of

00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:37.300
death by water that would
provide some kind of

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:45.569
transformation where eyes might
become pearls.

00:27:45.569 --> 00:27:50.506
By calling up Shakespeare and
The Tempest,

00:27:50.506 --> 00:27:55.647
Eliot evokes Shakespeare's
whole romance promise of

00:27:55.647 --> 00:28:01.814
transformation through drowning,
through magic,

00:28:01.814 --> 00:28:06.039
and romance redemption.
 

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:09.978
In the course of the poem,
that little fragment will

00:28:09.978 --> 00:28:13.839
become another motif that recurs
and circulates,

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:18.606
becoming almost a kind of
object of collective memory in

00:28:18.606 --> 00:28:22.160
the poem, a bit of shared
knowledge of,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.481
let's say, potential that is
drawn specifically from the

00:28:27.481 --> 00:28:31.607
literary past.
You could say that here and

00:28:31.607 --> 00:28:36.762
elsewhere Shakespeare and
literary tradition in general

00:28:36.762 --> 00:28:42.490
stand in for sacred texts that
would offer some kind of guide

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:46.500
to action and some source of
meaning.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:53.641
Here, the sacred text of
Shakespeare is no sooner invoked

00:28:53.641 --> 00:29:01.292
than it is parodied through this
1912 jazz song that comes to

00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:04.571
mind,
as also in, presumably,

00:29:04.571 --> 00:29:09.204
the speaker's head:
the "Shakespeherian Rag--/ It's

00:29:09.204 --> 00:29:12.170
so elegant / so intelligent."
 

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:19.757
There's a way in which,
well, Eliot's making fun of his

00:29:19.757 --> 00:29:25.940
own wish for Shakespeare to be
meaningful.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:31.714
There's also a way in which the
jazz brings this speaker

00:29:31.714 --> 00:29:37.595
suddenly to some kind of manic
life, and he has a kind of

00:29:37.595 --> 00:29:41.059
energy fitfully for a moment.
 

00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:45.464
And here, as in other moments
in the poem, high culture and

00:29:45.464 --> 00:29:50.021
low culture are brought together
in a kind of vertiginous and

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:54.764
interesting way.
In fact, you could see this

00:29:54.764 --> 00:29:59.661
whole section,
"A Game of Chess," as doing

00:29:59.661 --> 00:30:06.587
that since we move from the
drawing room and its particular

00:30:06.587 --> 00:30:13.395
interior decoration to the pub
scene that follows with the

00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:20.680
account of Lil's childbearing
and so forth that we then get to

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.470
overhear.
And then the poem,

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:29.208
or rather this section of the
poem, ends with another

00:30:29.208 --> 00:30:34.038
quotation from Shakespeare:
Ophelia's parting words in

00:30:34.038 --> 00:30:36.823
Hamlet,
"good night,

00:30:36.823 --> 00:30:39.369
sweet ladies," and so forth.
 

00:30:39.369 --> 00:30:48.778
"The Game of Chess" here,
well, it has all sorts of

00:30:48.778 --> 00:30:52.730
complex resonances.
 

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:59.852
Eliot's certainly punning on
some sense of stale-mating and

00:30:59.852 --> 00:31:06.546
unions, sexual unions,
that have gone wrong and that

00:31:06.546 --> 00:31:13.910
have left people against each
other in warring postures.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:22.487
As the poem proceeds in "The
Fire Sermon," we get more scenes

00:31:22.487 --> 00:31:30.350
of erotic impasse or worse,
erotic violence of different

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.780
kinds.
 

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:37.369
 
 

00:31:37.369 --> 00:31:42.381
The scene of the Thames,
the water that flows through

00:31:42.381 --> 00:31:46.430
London, is now brought into
focus again,

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:52.905
not at London Bridge precisely,
but just the shore where,

00:31:52.905 --> 00:31:57.633
well, Eliot describes it as:
The river's tent is

00:31:57.633 --> 00:31:59.690
broken;
the last fingers of leaf

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.750
Clutch and sink into the wet
bank.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.600
The wind
Crosses the brown land, unheard.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.220
The nymphs are departed.
 

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.519
Sweet Thames,
run softly, till I end my song.

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:15.390
The river bears no empty
bottles, sandwich papers,

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.155
Silk handkerchiefs,
cardboard boxes,

00:32:18.155 --> 00:32:21.325
cigarette ends
Or other testimony of summer

00:32:21.325 --> 00:32:24.610
nights.
[As it usually does.] The nymphs

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.954
are departed.
And their friends,

00:32:26.954 --> 00:32:29.000
the loitering heirs of City
directors;

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.920
Departed, have left no
addresses.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.859
Here, Eliot's,
you know, conjuring a kind of

00:32:37.859 --> 00:32:45.097
erotic debris that has been left
behind by these businessmen and

00:32:45.097 --> 00:32:51.638
their nymphs.
As the poem progresses,

00:32:51.638 --> 00:33:03.210
there are more images of erotic
confusion and desolation.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:09.802
But at my back from time
to time I hear [on the bottom of

00:33:09.802 --> 00:33:12.596
479]
The sound of horns and motors,

00:33:12.596 --> 00:33:15.353
which shall bring
Sweeney to Mrs.

00:33:15.353 --> 00:33:17.500
Porter in the spring.
 

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.471
O the moon [I should be able to
sing this for you]

00:33:20.471 --> 00:33:21.684
shone bright on Mrs.
 

00:33:21.684 --> 00:33:23.890
Porter
And on her daughter

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.549
They wash their feet in soda
water.

00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:30.340
Et O ces voix d'enfants,
chantant dans la coupole!

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:35.400
Twit twit twit
Jug jug jug jug jug jug

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.340
So rudely forc'd.
 

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:42.377
Tereu
Again, a kind of amazing

00:33:42.377 --> 00:33:49.097
linguistic vertigo as we pass
from a bawdy Australian soldier

00:33:49.097 --> 00:33:51.000
ballad about Mrs.
 

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.944
Porter, which has all kinds of
obscene stanzas that your editor

00:33:57.944 --> 00:34:03.725
doesn't quote for you,
to Verlaine's image of

00:34:03.725 --> 00:34:11.539
children's voices singing under
the dome in his Parsifal,

00:34:11.539 --> 00:34:17.963
introducing another narrative
and theme that recurs throughout

00:34:17.963 --> 00:34:23.650
the poem: the grail story and
the story of Parsifal.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:27.579
 
 

00:34:27.579 --> 00:34:34.192
The poem moves then with
those--first of all,

00:34:34.192 --> 00:34:41.106
it's just those sounds,
which are the sounds of

00:34:41.106 --> 00:34:44.700
Philomel;
here, you know,

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:49.621
human voice reduced to a kind
of noise almost,

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:52.246
to another anecdote:
"Mr.

00:34:52.246 --> 00:34:58.807
Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant
/ unshaven," who asks the "me"

00:34:58.807 --> 00:35:05.806
of the poem "in demotic French /
to luncheon at the Cannon Street

00:35:05.806 --> 00:35:12.039
Hotel / followed by a weekend at
the Metropole."

00:35:12.039 --> 00:35:17.038
A proposition,
it seems, and again a kind of

00:35:17.038 --> 00:35:20.409
sinister sexual invitation.
 

00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:31.593
There then follows the extended
scene between the typist and

00:35:31.593 --> 00:35:43.156
"young man carbuncular," an ugly
scene of sexual emptiness and

00:35:43.156 --> 00:35:50.289
domination.
And Eliot doesn't shrink from,

00:35:50.289 --> 00:35:58.296
you know, representing this man
in the most ugly – both

00:35:58.296 --> 00:36:05.159
visually and morally – the
most ugly terms,

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:12.969
although the poem was indeed a
lot uglier yet than it is now.

00:36:12.969 --> 00:36:18.951
At the very end of it,
after he's left and bestowed

00:36:18.951 --> 00:36:24.670
one final patronizing kiss,
the poem used to--or this

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:29.530
section of the poem used to end
with a rhyme that he,

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.500
you know, then stopped outside
to take a piss.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:38.034
That was excised,
however, in the course of the

00:36:38.034 --> 00:36:44.290
poem and is an unnecessary
further registering of the

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.900
degradation of this scene.
 

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:58.461
Then the poem moves to,
well, these inset lyric songs

00:36:58.461 --> 00:37:00.870
on 482.
"The river sweats";

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.579
again, we're on the river.
 

00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:09.786
And we're given a kind of image
of Queen Elizabeth I and the

00:37:09.786 --> 00:37:16.259
Earl of Leicester – a
potential lover for the virgin

00:37:16.259 --> 00:37:22.000
queen – who are being carried
downstream.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.059
And then finally,
another speaker emerges;

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:32.447
this time, it seems,
a woman, speaking again in

00:37:32.447 --> 00:37:36.280
quotation marks:
"Trams and dusty trees.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.090
Highbury bore me.
 

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:41.360
Richmond and Kew
Undid me.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.167
By Richmond I raised my knees
Supine on the floor of a narrow

00:37:46.167 --> 00:37:49.403
canoe."
"My feet are at Moorgate,

00:37:49.403 --> 00:37:52.780
and my heart
Under my feet.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.420
After the event
He wept.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.970
He promised 'a new start.'
 

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.290
I made no comment.
 

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.040
What should I resent?
 

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.150
"On Margate Sands.
 

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:10.710
I can connect
Nothing with nothing.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.340
The broken fingernails of dirty
hands.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.200
My people humble people who
expect

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:22.514
Nothing.'"
There's a kind of extraordinary

00:38:22.514 --> 00:38:25.800
metamorphosis of speaker here.
 

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:31.364
We begin listening to the
sexual anecdotes of,

00:38:31.364 --> 00:38:38.659
presumably, one of these nymphs
abandoned by one of the city

00:38:38.659 --> 00:38:45.460
directors who has been had in
the park in Highbury,

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.739
Richmond and Kew.
 

00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:50.914
There's been,
it seems, an event:

00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:55.080
perhaps, what--a pregnancy,
an abortion?

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.310
"'He wept.
He promised ‘a new start.'

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:08.208
/ What should I resent?'"
That experience then shifts to

00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:11.820
another location.
 

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.760
There's a kind of mutation of
the speaker going on.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:19.230
"On Margate Sands" --it's just
that location,

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:24.210
and then, "I can connect
nothing with nothing."

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:30.510
And now that phrase,
"nothing with nothing."

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:31.940
"What's in your head?
 

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.265
Nothing."
Those lines and that motif

00:39:36.265 --> 00:39:39.591
recur.
That first person is like the

00:39:39.591 --> 00:39:43.952
first person of "A Game of
Chess," as if that woman had

00:39:43.952 --> 00:39:45.889
turned into that man.
 

00:39:45.889 --> 00:39:53.862
And "Margate Sands" locate the
poem at this moment at one of

00:39:53.862 --> 00:39:58.812
the places where,
after working in the city and

00:39:58.812 --> 00:40:03.988
succumbing to a kind of nervous
breakdown, Eliot went to compose

00:40:03.988 --> 00:40:07.110
parts of The Waste Land.
So,

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:10.387
there's a way in which he,
too, the poet,

00:40:10.387 --> 00:40:14.483
is that first person there,
merged with these other

00:40:14.483 --> 00:40:19.480
first-persons who finally then
merge with Queen Elizabeth when

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:25.646
we hear that first person say,
"My people humble people who

00:40:25.646 --> 00:40:30.197
expect nothing."
Again, there's a kind of

00:40:30.197 --> 00:40:36.583
shifting and metamorphosis of
identity as people are brought

00:40:36.583 --> 00:40:42.320
into relationship with each
other through their shared

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.000
experience of erotic failure.
 

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.928
Let's see, not too many minutes
left to talk about the end of

00:40:53.928 --> 00:41:00.140
the poem and to give some sense
of its shape.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:09.079
 
 

00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:13.309
Here's a kind of narrative of
the poem.

00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:16.974
"The Burial of the Dead," the
title, it comes from the

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:19.739
Anglican Book of Common
Prayer.

00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:25.957
It suggests that the poem will
search for, perhaps itself try

00:41:25.957 --> 00:41:30.650
to substitute for,
the kind of ritual

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:39.241
understanding of life and death
that the Anglican Book of

00:41:39.241 --> 00:41:46.179
Common Prayer provides;
again, some kind of collective

00:41:46.179 --> 00:41:49.451
meaning.
"A Game of Chess" then

00:41:49.451 --> 00:41:54.682
specifies the poem's problem as
erotic impasse,

00:41:54.682 --> 00:42:00.710
as a kind of stale-mating,
as the failure of love.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:05.320
"The Fire Sermon" then proposes
a kind of solution.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:12.222
From the Buddhist teaching,
self-control is a way to combat

00:42:12.222 --> 00:42:17.608
lust and domination,
the selfishness of desire –

00:42:17.608 --> 00:42:23.050
all of which resonates in a
moral register with the poetic

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:28.492
program of "Tradition and the
Individual Talent" where the

00:42:28.492 --> 00:42:33.170
theme is self-extinction or
self-submission.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:37.633
The point in the middle of the
poem where I've been dwelling

00:42:37.633 --> 00:42:42.248
for the past few minutes--the
point is to convert the fires of

00:42:42.248 --> 00:42:45.880
lust into refining and
spiritualizing fires.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.538
Then there's a kind of
scherzo,

00:42:48.538 --> 00:42:51.340
that little section "Death by
Water,"

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.603
where the drowned Phoenician
sailor seems to,

00:42:55.603 --> 00:43:01.320
well, be a kind of sacrificial
figure meant to represent,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.630
again, iconographically,
self-extinction.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:10.870
And then finally,
after this emblematic

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:17.901
sacrifice, we are introduced to
the long final section "What the

00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:21.890
Thunder Said,"
when there is a return of

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:26.010
divine speech and the promise of
rain and of water,

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:33.234
what the poem seems to be
looking for: aligning the

00:43:33.234 --> 00:43:41.470
redemptive regeneration that
would come with the rain with

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:50.572
the experience of divine speech
made present here in that simple

00:43:50.572 --> 00:43:54.349
syllable,
"Da."

00:43:54.349 --> 00:44:04.777
Let me say just a couple things
about the shape of the poem as

00:44:04.777 --> 00:44:10.010
we have it.
I've asked you to look at

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:17.357
Pound's work on the poem in the
form of some pages from The

00:44:17.357 --> 00:44:20.969
Waste Land Manuscripts.
 

00:44:20.969 --> 00:44:28.200
Well, Pound collaborated in the
writing of this poem by,

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.590
in particular,
excising and shortening the

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:38.980
poem at many points and
specifically,

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:44.042
if you study the drafts,
by, I think,

00:44:44.042 --> 00:44:52.480
isolating those moments in the
poem where Eliot is drawn to a

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.699
kind of Romantic lyricism.
 

00:44:56.699 --> 00:45:01.297
On what becomes the first page
of the poem, "April is the

00:45:01.297 --> 00:45:05.485
cruelest month," Pound circles
the word "forgetful":

00:45:05.485 --> 00:45:07.619
"with forgetful snow."
 

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:11.934
In the passage about Philomel,
he circles the word

00:45:11.934 --> 00:45:15.280
"inviolable" for "inviolable
voice."

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:20.980
Pound wants to get the
Romanticism and lyricism of the

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.530
poem out of it in certain ways.
 

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:29.701
Eliot resists that,
and there are ways in which

00:45:29.701 --> 00:45:36.671
these two men working together
and against each other to create

00:45:36.671 --> 00:45:42.292
the poem enact some of the
poem's own struggle with

00:45:42.292 --> 00:45:49.150
lyricism and with Romanticism
and help us to see that struggle

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:56.570
as part of what goes into the
creation of the poem itself.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:02.984
One of the sections that Pound
had the biggest effect on was

00:46:02.984 --> 00:46:08.350
"Death by Water,"
which was originally a long,

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:15.775
heroic narrative or mock-heroic
narrative ending in the sailor's

00:46:15.775 --> 00:46:20.936
drowning.
That short section is worth

00:46:20.936 --> 00:46:29.539
dwelling on for a moment because
it is an instance where we are

00:46:29.539 --> 00:46:35.228
given, I think,
an image of what Eliot was

00:46:35.228 --> 00:46:40.311
giving up.
He is giving up a certain

00:46:40.311 --> 00:46:45.955
investment in romance quest and,
more generally,

00:46:45.955 --> 00:46:52.920
Romanticism that's emblematized
by this drowned figure.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:58.992
There's also a way in which
this very short section points

00:46:58.992 --> 00:47:05.384
us to and makes us think about
the shortness of the poem as a

00:47:05.384 --> 00:47:07.950
whole.
The Waste Land is the

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:09.880
shortest long poem in the
language.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.051
It is, you know,
a kind of radically condensed

00:47:14.051 --> 00:47:17.089
epic.
And there's a kind of,

00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:21.760
you could say,
claim made by the poem's form

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:28.170
that epic extension and duration
are no longer possible,

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:31.546
just as romance quest is no
longer possible,

00:47:31.546 --> 00:47:35.787
precisely because we lack the
kind of culturally shared

00:47:35.787 --> 00:47:40.264
vocabulary and language that
would allow Eliot to create a

00:47:40.264 --> 00:47:42.619
kind of continuous form.
 

00:47:42.619 --> 00:47:46.273
Instead, what we have is a
radically condensed and

00:47:46.273 --> 00:47:50.213
discontinuous form;
the brokenness of the poem's

00:47:50.213 --> 00:47:55.468
form representing the brokenness
of a world that doesn't have a

00:47:55.468 --> 00:48:02.582
sacred center.
Finally, there's the matter of

00:48:02.582 --> 00:48:06.964
those notes.
They are, I think,

00:48:06.964 --> 00:48:10.280
an important part of the poem.
 

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.021
They kind of get lost in the
editor's notes in your

00:48:15.021 --> 00:48:17.749
anthology.
Well, when Eliot first

00:48:17.749 --> 00:48:20.999
published the poem it didn't
have those notes,

00:48:20.999 --> 00:48:24.538
when he published it in England
in The Dial

00:48:24.538 --> 00:48:28.150
magazine--excuse me,
in The Criterion.

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:33.821
When he published it in America
shortly after,

00:48:33.821 --> 00:48:40.880
he added those notes to extend
the length of the poem;

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.809
he was asked to make a longer
poem.

00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:50.682
There's a way in which those
notes establish a particular

00:48:50.682 --> 00:48:55.192
kind of figure,
a poet who is also a scholar

00:48:55.192 --> 00:48:59.784
and an editor,
who is producing a poem that

00:48:59.784 --> 00:49:05.579
needs notes and that needs to
explain itself in these ways,

00:49:05.579 --> 00:49:10.109
and that draws on literary
tradition and various forms of

00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:13.750
cultural knowledge that require
annotation.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:19.053
Eliot presents himself as this
figure, a poet who is also a

00:49:19.053 --> 00:49:24.593
kind of scholar.
And this figure emerges as a

00:49:24.593 --> 00:49:32.937
kind of central modern figure,
replacing the epic poet of the

00:49:32.937 --> 00:49:36.712
past,
the one who produced a poem

00:49:36.712 --> 00:49:41.840
such as Paradise Lost
without any footnotes.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.221
Well, Hart Crane responds to
all of what I've been talking

00:49:46.221 --> 00:49:50.833
about today and uses it as a
point of orientation to create a

00:49:50.833 --> 00:49:54.370
related but very different kind
of poetry,

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:58.000
as we'll see on Wednesday.

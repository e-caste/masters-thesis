00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.700
So you remember that I began
the last lecture playing a

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.500
poem by Sterling
Brown called Old Lem,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.100
documenting the kinds of
local social trauma and

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.100
challenges that African
Americans had to face in a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.567
sharecropping
South.&nbsp; At least,

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:22.300
that's sort of the context
that Old Lem evokes for me.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.700
And I talked about the--the
rise of the NAACP and the

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.100
Great Migration, the
forces conspiring it,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.867
and also closed--and then
closed with some vignettes

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:38.967
from The Birth of a Nation
to give you a sense of--sort

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:44.000
of a tactile sense
of a mentality in the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.767
nineteen-teens that reflects
sort of the racial passions

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:51.967
of the age, maybe to put a
poetic turn on it.&nbsp; Today's

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:55.800
lecture's really going to
focus chiefly at the--the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.200
very in--between
1918 and 1920 or so,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.700
essentially, kind of
bringing together all these

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
different strands of
social, political,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300
economic tension and
watching how they present

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300
themselves to a national,
international audience.&nbsp; I'm

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.200
going to start here in 1918,
move back a bit through

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.700
1917, go into 1919, just
so you sort of follow the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.700
trajectory of the
lecture.&nbsp; Also my apologies,

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.800
I'm battling a head cold and
I'm hoping that I can get

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.567
through all this
without being too congested.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.600
Anyway, this--I'm going
to title this lecture,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.300
I call it "World War I and
the Red Summer."&nbsp; In 1918,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.300
W.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.300
E.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.300
B.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.600
Du Bois, the Director of
Research for the NAACP and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
the editor of the
NAACP's journal,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.900
Crisis, you know, the great
leader of the American Negro

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.100
Academy, the author of Souls
of Black Folk.&nbsp; Du Bois

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.467
writes an editorial.&nbsp; The
editorial is called "Close

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:15.500
Ranks."&nbsp; Now in
writing for the NAACP,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.400
it's supposed to be a
non-partisan organization,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.067
although it had a
progressive political agenda

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:24.167
when it comes to racial
matters.&nbsp; But Du Bois,

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:27.667
over the course of his three
decades or so of continuous

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:32.100
affiliation with the NAACP,
frequently ruffled the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.767
feathers of NAACP
leaders for his independence

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:39.400
and--and essentially
his shifting political

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.000
ideologies being--being
articulated in CrisisÂ¸

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.600
through these editorials.&nbsp;
"Closed Ranks" is one of the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.900
more famous early ones.&nbsp;
This is an excerpt from it.&nbsp;

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.467
So he's talking about
World War I.&nbsp; The U.S.

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:00.500
is not yet involved.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.700
But he's saying, "This is
the crisis--this is the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.500
crisis of the world.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500
We of the colored race
have no ordinary interest

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.700
[coughs] --excuse me-- We
of the colored race have no

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.800
ordinary interest
in the outcome.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.900
That which the German
power&nbsp;represents today

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.867
spells death to the
aspirations of Negroes and

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:23.600
all darker
races for equality,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.000
freedom and democracy.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.367
Let us not hesitate.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.100
Let us, while
this war lasts,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.500
forget our special
grievances and close our

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.900
ranks shoulder to shoulder
with our own white fellow

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.900
citizens and the allied
nations that are fighting

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.900
for democracy.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.500
We make no
ordinary sacrifice,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.200
but we make it gladly and
willingly with our eyes

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.200
lifted to the hills."

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.800
"This is the crisis
of the world.&nbsp; Let us,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.400
while this war lasts, forget
our special grievances and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.267
close our ranks shoulder
to shoulder with our white

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:03.200
citizens and the allied
nations that are fighting

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.000
for democracy."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
This is Du Bois's basic call
to black Americans to invest

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.167
their faith in the promise
of American democracy.&nbsp; The

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.100
thinking was, by
demonstrating the epitome of

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.467
patriotic--the
patriotic act,

00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:24.100
risking your life
for your country,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.167
African Americans
would--would--this

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.900
demonstration would
certainly translate into

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.100
civil rights injustice at
home once the war ended.&nbsp;

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.200
Risk your life for the
sake of the country,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.400
and the country will
respect it and honor that

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.400
sacrifice.&nbsp; Many black
leaders were angry with Du

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.267
Bois, and this is why I sort
of preface this commentary

00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:56.800
on the editorial, that this
should not be seen as the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.500
opinion of the
NAACP necessarily,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.767
but Du Bois's opinion.&nbsp; Many
black leaders were upset

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:05.200
with Du Bois because they
didn't think that he was

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.400
acting in the best wishes or
the best--in the best spirit

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.767
of the race.&nbsp; And while they
didn't think he was quite

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:17.767
acting like Booker T.

00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:20.267
Washington, who has just
passed away about three

00:05:20.267 --> 00:05:23.100
years at this point, they
were astonished that he

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.000
could find it reasonable to
ask blacks--to ask blacks to

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.567
forget their special
grievances.&nbsp; We've already

00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:33.000
gone over these
special grievances,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.067
of course, listed over
the course of the last few

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:41.867
weeks, a litany of problems
generally associated with

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:44.900
black life in the South,
still largely a southern

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.400
population.&nbsp; Those
grievances hadn't changed.&nbsp;

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:55.400
What I want to do today in
laying out this narrative is

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.500
talk about these grievances
as they were located in

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.800
other places, the
Midwest to a certain extent,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.000
but also more generally the
North.&nbsp; I mean this is the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.500
moment of the migration.&nbsp;
This builds upon that issue

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.900
of, you know, what is it
that blacks found when they

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.900
landed in these new--new
areas and new cities?&nbsp; Now

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:25.500
as I made clear, I
hope, in the last lecture,

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.700
black migration was due
to a range of factors,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.267
but jobs were one of the
most important of these

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:36.000
factors.&nbsp; You know, there's
the political intransigence

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.767
of the South, of course,
the terror and lynch law,

00:06:38.767 --> 00:06:40.900
but jobs were really one
of the animating--core

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.900
animating features.&nbsp; Blacks
migrating to the North or to

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.300
the cities in search of
work often burdened social

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.400
services--social
service agencies,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.900
who were trying to help out
the needy.&nbsp; Blacks' arrival

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.167
in Northern, Midwestern
cities placed extra

00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:09.800
pressures on housing,
and blacks' presence

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.267
increasingly exacerbated
labor tensions.&nbsp; It's not

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:14.267
surprising.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.467
You think back to the New
York City draft riots with

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:20.200
which I began this class.&nbsp;
Blacks' presence on the

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.267
laboring scene created
anxiety among those who were

00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:27.000
already working.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.300
In all of these regards, in
overburdened social service

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.400
agencies helping out
the poor and the needy,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.567
housing issues,
labor issues,

00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:39.967
in all of these regards, you
can see events in East St.

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:45.967
Louis forming into a powder
keg.&nbsp; July 2nd in 1917,

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:54.600
East St. Louis: labor agents
have recruited successfully

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.667
thousands of blacks to
work in the East St. Louis's

00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:01.000
aluminum factories,
and they were hired,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.900
as I mentioned on
Monday, in this case,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.100
blacks were hired to replace
striking white workers.&nbsp;

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.600
These were scab workers.&nbsp;
The striking workers were

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.200
furious, of course.&nbsp; The
bosses knew they had a great

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.500
card to play, the
race card in this case,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:26.700
and they used race to divide
the workers.&nbsp; Blacks weren't

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.100
allowed in the unions, so
this didn't help matters out

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.100
at all, and union organizers
raised the cry of,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.300
I quote here, "Nigger scab"
as blacks were going into

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.200
the aluminum factories.&nbsp;
As blacks were going in,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.400
these scab workers going
into the--the factories,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.900
fights break out and
quickly turn from a local,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.100
you know, fistfight or
so to just open violence,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.800
going throughout much of
East St. Louis.&nbsp; The police

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.200
force, largely white,
they're not surprised at any

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.167
of this happening, but
decide to look the other

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:10.100
way, as whites begin to
assault blacks by clubbing

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:17.900
them, hitting them, stabbing
them.&nbsp; When the dust settles

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.300
down, we know that nine
whites and at least forty

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.767
blacks died in the riots in
East St. Louis.&nbsp; And I say

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:32.700
at least forty blacks.&nbsp;
If you look at eyewitness

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.600
accounts, you start
seeing wide discrepancies of

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.700
numbers.&nbsp; And really, what's
unknown is how many blacks

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.700
died.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.900
I mean, I'm sure it could
be more whites as well,

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.900
but particularly
blacks in this case,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.700
since there are eyewitness
accounts of their bodies

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.967
being thrown into
ditches and never recovered,

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:54.267
being thrown into the
Mississippi River and never

00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:58.967
recovered.&nbsp; So we don't know
how many people died in the

00:09:58.967 --> 00:10:04.200
riots, really.&nbsp; We do
know that thousands of black

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.200
families were left homeless
because of these St. Louis

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.567
riots.&nbsp; And we also know
that the massacre did not go

00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:16.167
unnoticed.&nbsp; Some three
weeks after the riots,

00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:17.700
we're talking late
July at this point,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.200
the NAACP organized a silent
march down New York City's

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.100
Fifth Avenue.&nbsp; Being
led by muffled drums,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.067
ten thousand men, women, and
children marched from Harlem

00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:36.100
to the heart of
Manhattan in dead silence,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.800
simply carrying
banners like,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.500
and I quote here, "Mr.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.867
President, why not make
America safe for democracy?"

00:10:43.867 --> 00:10:51.300
or, "Mother, do lynchers
go to heaven?"&nbsp; There's a

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.200
couple of images here
from the silent march,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.467
again led by drummers,
not a single sound,

00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:07.900
just a simple beat.&nbsp; And
this is what I'll just call

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.000
a Men's Auxiliary.&nbsp;
Just the men were marching

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.400
separately, carrying banners
about anti--you know,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.400
protesting racial violence.&nbsp;
Dressed in their respectable

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.567
best.&nbsp; And in
the same march,

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:29.900
sort of the
Women's Auxiliary,

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.200
women and children
marching together,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.500
you know, as far
as the eye can see,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.900
looking up Fifth Avenue,
marching down.&nbsp; The silent

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.600
protest, cause no one was
going to hear their cries

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.167
out loud, it seemed.&nbsp;
Now East St. Louis,

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:50.167
as it turned out, would
prove to be just the start

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:57.067
of things.&nbsp; Two
years later, 1919,

00:11:57.067 --> 00:12:00.600
the country would go through
what has been called the Red

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.367
Summer.&nbsp; Now the name didn't
come from the reference to

00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:08.900
communism, in this case, but
rather was drawn from the

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.900
amount of blood that was
shed.&nbsp; Violence breaks out

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.500
in twenty-five cities in a
six-month period in 1919.&nbsp;

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.900
Some of the violence
happens in the South.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.900
Some of these riots
happen in the South,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.000
but the majority of the
violence happens in the

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.100
Midwest and North.&nbsp; And the
worst riots--in your reading

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.200
this week, the sort
of classic book on the

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.700
occasion--the worst riots
happened in Chicago in 1919,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.767
in July of 1919.&nbsp; You have
in Chicago a five-day battle

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:47.867
between whites and blacks,
ethnic enclaves of whites

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:54.700
fighting against
blacks.&nbsp; Now Chicago,

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.900
as you know from
reading the book,

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.700
is a little bit different
from St. Louis--East St.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.200
Louis in this regard, in
that the battle in Chicago

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.500
is not really
over labor tensions,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.967
per se.&nbsp; Certainly there are
tensions in the factories,

00:13:04.967 --> 00:13:08.300
but not--not like East St.
Louis.&nbsp; The riots aren't

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.200
started out of scab workers
trying to break a union,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.867
or being used to break
a union.&nbsp; In Chicago,

00:13:14.867 --> 00:13:16.767
the largely--the riots
largely are sparked by

00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:18.767
housing tensions.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.800
Now the spark comes out of
the ugly--an ugly racial

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.600
incident.&nbsp; A young black
boy goes to Lake Michigan to

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.900
enjoy a break from the heat
of the summer.&nbsp; He goes to

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.767
the segregated beach and
trudges out into the water.&nbsp;

00:13:33.767 --> 00:13:34.800
Now if you know
Lake Michigan,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.700
it looks like an ocean
when you're at the--at the

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.800
shore.&nbsp; He goes out into the
water and strays over some

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.667
unmarked line.&nbsp; I
can't really say it was

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:45.400
imaginary.&nbsp; People
knew that it was there,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.100
I suppose.&nbsp; He strays
over some unmarked line

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.200
separating the races in
the water.&nbsp; A group of white

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.300
boys start throwing stones
at him from the shore.&nbsp; He

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.067
drowns in the assault.&nbsp;
News about the murder starts

00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:04.300
sweeping across
Chicago, and street gangs,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.800
made up of white ethnics,
start roving about with the

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.500
stated purpose of defending
their turf.&nbsp; So you already

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.000
know the tension's there,
and this might be a spark

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.800
they're recognizing of
something really horrible

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.000
happening, based on the
violence happening in other

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
cities.&nbsp; So these street
gangs start to--they're sort

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.867
of spread out to defend
their territories.&nbsp; There's

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:32.867
already a history of
first-wave blacks,

00:14:32.867 --> 00:14:35.667
you know, the first
to enter into a white,

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.000
say Irish
neighborhood, let's say,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.700
or an Italian neighborhood,
to try to find a place to

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.900
live, because they were
running out of spaces to--to

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.467
live in the so-called "Black
Belt" of Chicago.&nbsp; There's a

00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:51.367
history of houses being
firebombed.&nbsp; We'd rather

00:14:51.367 --> 00:14:54.400
burn down a house and
risk burning down a block,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.900
actually, than have this
black family move in.&nbsp; There

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:06.200
are all kinds of threats
when blacks try to de facto

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.967
integrate white
neighborhoods,

00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:12.900
and now things simply
escalated.&nbsp; In the course of

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.200
the ensuing--ensuing
five-day riot,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.367
at least forty people were
killed.&nbsp; Two-thirds of them

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:25.567
were black.&nbsp; Thousands
more, over five thousand,

00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:29.500
are injured, mostly black,
and thousands of families

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:36.000
are left homeless.&nbsp; Much
like in East St. Louis,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.967
police stood by and let
white mobs attack blacks.

00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:43.067
There's some striking
pictures of this in--in

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:47.500
Tuttle's book.&nbsp; Only when
the Illinois National Guard

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.400
is brought in does peace
return to the city.&nbsp; It

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.267
takes days.&nbsp; But there's a
slightly different element

00:15:54.267 --> 00:15:58.500
to this riot, as far as
in sort of the heat of the

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.300
moment, not its causative
factors.&nbsp; It's that you had

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.100
such a dense population--a
large and dense population

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.400
of black enclaves.&nbsp; When
these white gangs start

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.767
moving into territories
beyond their own turf,

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.100
like the South
Side of Chicago,

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.567
it was not uncommon during
these riots for blacks to

00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:27.500
set upon them, to defend
their turf.&nbsp; So while blacks

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.600
overwhelmingly--overwhelming
ly suffered at the hands of

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.500
whites during
the Chicago riot,

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.600
one can see a new militancy
in the mentality arising

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.867
among blacks.&nbsp; And to
trace this new mentality,

00:16:39.867 --> 00:16:43.100
and this actually propels us
into next week's lectures on

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.400
the New Negro.&nbsp; To
trace this new mentality,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.300
we need to go back to the
start of World War I and Du

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.167
Bois's call to close ranks.&nbsp;
Although black leaders

00:16:52.167 --> 00:16:58.167
criticized Du Bois
for his editorial,

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:05.200
many blacks did heed his
call and signed up for

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.400
duty.&nbsp; Ultimately, around
three hundred thousand black

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.867
men served; half of them
serve in Europe during the

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:19.000
US involvement in World
War I.&nbsp; A call for black

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.300
officers is made.&nbsp; This is
a rather bold departure,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.067
and to white
officials' surprise,

00:17:26.067 --> 00:17:31.867
is actually answered.&nbsp; But
now we have a problem.&nbsp; How

00:17:31.867 --> 00:17:37.867
are you going to train black
soldiers?&nbsp; I've been talking

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.100
about the North
here, but as it happens,

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.600
this is really a Southern
story at this point,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.067
because so many of the
country's forts and training

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:52.500
grounds are Southern.&nbsp;
Southerners had fears of

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.100
"armed negroes," as the
phrase would have been,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.900
particularly Northern blacks
who were now being given

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.067
guns, who would
be quick to anger,

00:18:03.067 --> 00:18:06.100
they suspected, over how
they might be treated in

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.800
southern towns.&nbsp; They
weren't worried so much

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.400
about black
soldiers, say from Chicago,

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.367
being trained down
in a base in Alabama,

00:18:16.367 --> 00:18:19.400
as long as they were on the
base.&nbsp; They weren't so much

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.167
concerned about
that.&nbsp; But, you know,

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:24.900
people leave the base and
they might go into the city.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.767
And if they were expecting
to be served at a counter,

00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:29.600
or to go in the
front door of a bus,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.567
or go in the front door of a
restaurant and they weren't

00:18:31.567 --> 00:18:38.800
allowed, they're worried
about what might result.&nbsp; So

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.900
counter to established
military doctrine,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.600
or so I understand it,
instead of training as

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.500
entire divisions altogether,
divisions were broken up and

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.300
trained in smaller
quantities.&nbsp; They'd be

00:18:53.300 --> 00:19:00.600
reorganized overseas
into their proper military

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.667
structure, but they
also--and they--these are

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:08.600
black troops I'm talking
about here--weren't always

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600
fighting under the U.S.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.600
flag.&nbsp; They trained with
French troops.&nbsp; They'd be

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.000
sent over there to train
with French troops and fight

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.567
under the French flag.&nbsp;
So when these black troops

00:19:20.567 --> 00:19:24.900
trained in un--in
unorthodox ways in the U.S.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.800
South, in the U.S., get
reorganized into proper

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.600
divisions in the
European theater,

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.867
the great majority
of them in France,

00:19:35.867 --> 00:19:37.867
some fighting
under the French flag,

00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:45.167
when they are not in
battle, if they're on,

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:48.600
if they have some leave
perhaps and they go into a

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.267
city or a town in France,
they have--an interesting

00:19:52.267 --> 00:19:57.500
thing starts to happen, is
that they're treated like

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:04.600
citizens.&nbsp; Black soldiers
in France would tell stories

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.267
all the time about--about
having their first true

00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:15.067
feeling of liberty when they
were in France.&nbsp; All the

00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:18.667
white officers and
government--government

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:21.400
officials, and white offers
under--under command to act

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.300
this way, certainly, they
did all that they could do

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.300
to prevent it.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:30.367
They were still being
welcomed by French citizens,

00:20:30.367 --> 00:20:37.700
and people coming to
their rescue.&nbsp; Now there are

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.967
plenty of stories about
white officers fraternizing

00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:46.300
with black
officers in France,

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.900
in, say, a local restaurant,
because the white officer

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.700
says, "You know, I don't
care what the color of your

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.000
skin are--is.&nbsp; You happen to
be--We're fighting side by

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.367
side.&nbsp; We're doing the
same kind of job."&nbsp; There's

00:20:56.367 --> 00:20:58.800
plenty of those stories.&nbsp;
I'm not going to categorize

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.600
all blacks and all whites
working a certain way.&nbsp; But

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.400
there were orders issued
about how officers were

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:14.367
supposed to control
black troops.&nbsp; For example,

00:21:14.367 --> 00:21:19.600
in 1918, a secret memo was
sent to the French military

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.900
mission that was written
by French authorities,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.200
but under pressure and
after approval by U.S.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:33.200
military authorities, that's
making clear how French

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:42.700
troops should deal with
black soldiers.&nbsp; "The French

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.967
public has become accustomed
to treating the Negro with

00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:51.967
familiarity and indulgence.&nbsp;
This indulgence and this

00:21:51.967 --> 00:21:54.267
familiarity are matters
of grievous concern to

00:21:54.267 --> 00:21:57.300
Americans.&nbsp; They consider
them an affront to their

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.700
national policy.&nbsp; They are
afraid that contact with the

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.367
French will inspire in black
Americans aspirations to

00:22:03.367 --> 00:22:07.700
which to the whites appear
intolerable.&nbsp; It is of the

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.800
utmost importance that every
effort be made to avoid

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.100
profoundly estranging
American opinion."

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.600
The directive then goes on
to list a set of conclusions

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.000
which I excerpt
briefly here.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
The first
conclusion is that,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.200
"we must prevent the rise
of any pronounced degree of

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.000
intimacy between
French officers and black

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.767
officers."&nbsp; "We must prevent
the rise of any intimacy,

00:22:29.767 --> 00:22:33.400
 I mean they're talking just
hanging out and socializing

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:39.400
between French officers and
black officers.&nbsp; "We must

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.400
not commend too highly
the black American troops,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:52.067
particularly in the presence
of white Americans."&nbsp; And

00:22:52.067 --> 00:22:55.000
another conclusion:
"Americans become greatly

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
incensed at any public
expression of intimacy

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.500
between white women with
black men."&nbsp; That same

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:10.200
specter arises again.&nbsp; Do
not socialize with black

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.500
officers.&nbsp; Do not--do not
commend the troops--the

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.100
black troops too much,
especially in the presence

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.367
of white Americans.&nbsp; And
recognize that Americans get

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:26.167
very uneasy,
"incensed" it said,

00:23:26.167 --> 00:23:28.600
at the public expression
of intimacy between white

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.400
women, in this case it
would be French women,

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:37.300
and black troops.&nbsp;
It's really profound,

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:42.067
the extent to which
the military and the

00:23:42.067 --> 00:23:44.200
government's trying to
preserve its social order,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:50.200
even overseas.&nbsp; Well,
despite these entreaties,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.100
black soldiers are welcomed
as heroes in France,

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.100
and they return to the U.S.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.000
quite reasonably with
expectations that justice

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.600
will be theirs, full
citizenship rights,

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.500
since they had risked their
lives for the country.&nbsp; For

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.100
a moment, in truth, it
actually looked like things

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.900
might be better.&nbsp;
When the 369th,

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.200
the first black contingent
to fight in the war,

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.900
the vision that was
known as the Hellfighters,

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.867
the 369th, known also
for its distinction on the

00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:34.400
battlefield.&nbsp; When it
returns to the U.S.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.700
in 1919, roughly one million
people watched them parade

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.100
from the Lower--from
Lower Manhattan docks,

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.500
up Fifth Avenue into Harlem.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:51.767
The symbolism of--I hope
you already get it.&nbsp; It's no

00:24:51.767 --> 00:24:53.700
small irony in the fact
that this is a shift in the

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.300
direction from the very
famous silent protest of ten

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.300
thousand black
men, and women,

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.900
and children, marching down
Fifth Avenue just two years

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.167
earlier in the wake of the
East St. Louis race riots.&nbsp;

00:25:05.167 --> 00:25:08.600
But now black soldiers
are returning as heroes,

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.267
welcomed by a
million people.&nbsp; Change of

00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:12.500
direction.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.400
A change of the notion
of who belongs and of

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:21.267
citizenship rights and
possibility.&nbsp; As it turns

00:25:21.267 --> 00:25:25.600
out, however, their early
optimism was proven wrong

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.900
quite quickly.&nbsp; After a
decline of several years,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.500
over the course
of several years,

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.800
the number of lynchings
skyrocket in 1919.&nbsp;

00:25:40.767 --> 00:25:43.267
Certainly this might be
in part of--due to the

00:25:43.267 --> 00:25:46.467
popularity of Birth of a
Nation and the rise of the

00:25:46.467 --> 00:25:51.400
Klan.&nbsp; The Klan really hits
its peak around 1920 to '22,

00:25:54.967 --> 00:25:58.300
but it's also quite clear
that 1919 is an important

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.467
marker as far as
this is concerned,

00:26:01.467 --> 00:26:04.000
because of the over
eighty-plus recorded

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
lynchings--recorded.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
There were certainly
more--of the recorded

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.900
eighty-plus lynch victims,
at least ten of them were

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.967
returning soldiers, most of
whom were murdered while in

00:26:15.967 --> 00:26:22.800
their uniform.&nbsp; So the very
thing that Southern towns

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:29.267
were afraid of happening
manifested itself in

00:26:29.267 --> 00:26:31.300
reality, but in a weird--in
a weird sort of way,

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.200
and certainly a
miserable sort of way,

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.900
Southern towns are afraid,
"What are we going to do

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.500
with these Northern black
troops with guns?&nbsp; They

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:43.467
might start shooting at us
and raising hell."&nbsp; Well,

00:26:43.467 --> 00:26:45.200
I guess their answer,
out of their anxiety,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.500
was that when these officers
or--officers or troops came

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.000
back, whether they were
Northern or Southern,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.267
they felt that now they had
earned the right to walk in

00:26:56.267 --> 00:26:58.300
the front door of the
restaurant and to get

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.300
served.&nbsp; They felt they
had the right to walk in the

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.067
front door of the bus
instead of the back door of

00:27:03.067 --> 00:27:06.100
the bus.&nbsp; They felt they had
the right to socialize with

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.000
whomever they wanted to.&nbsp;
This was the world they'd

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.600
become
accustomed to in France,

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.300
and, after all, they had
risked their lives in this

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:20.600
miserable war.&nbsp; And some of
these soldiers were lynched

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.700
while in uniform for
doing just such things as

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.400
innocuous as talking
back to bus drivers,

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.600
talking to white women,
insisting on being served.&nbsp;

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.600
This is social control at
the most grotesque level.&nbsp;

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:46.900
Du Bois, you'll remember,
had advocated that African

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.300
Americans should forget
their special grievances,

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.967
just a year earlier--two
years earlier--a year

00:27:51.967 --> 00:27:59.600
earlier, excuse me.&nbsp; And
he sees reports of black

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.800
soldiers being
treated like this,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.200
and black
citizens, not soldiers,

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.967
being treated like this, and
he realizes he made a grave

00:28:08.967 --> 00:28:15.467
error.&nbsp; So he writes a new
editorial called "Returning

00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:22.267
Soldiers."&nbsp; And
it says, in part,

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:29.900
of course, "Today we return.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.867
We return from the slavery
of uniform which the world's

00:28:32.867 --> 00:28:36.500
madness demanded us to
don to the freedom of civil

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.367
garb.

00:28:38.367 --> 00:28:41.800
We stand again to look
America squarely in the face

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.767
and call a spade a spade.

00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:48.400
We sing: This
country of ours,

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.600
despite all its better
souls have done and dreamed,

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.700
is yet a shameful land.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.767
It lynches.

00:28:56.767 --> 00:28:58.900
It disfranchises
its own citizens.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.300
It encourages ignorance.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.700
It steals from us.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.700
It insults us.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.667
This is the
country to which we,

00:29:08.667 --> 00:29:11.167
soldiers of
democracy, return.

00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:14.600
This is the fatherland
for--for which we fought!&nbsp;

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.300
But it is our fatherland.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.300
It was right
for us to fight.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.267
The faults of our
country are our faults.

00:29:21.267 --> 00:29:23.800
Under similar circumstances,
we would fight again.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.367
But by the God of Heaven, we
are cowards and jackasses if

00:29:27.367 --> 00:29:30.000
now that that war is over,
we do not marshal every

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
ounce of our brain and
brawn to fight a sterner,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.400
longer, more unbending
battle against the forces of

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.600
hell in our own land.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.800
We return.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.367
We return from fighting.

00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:46.200
We return fighting.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.300
Make way for democracy!

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.900
We saved it in France,
and by the Great Jehovah,

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.567
we will save it in the
United--in the United States

00:29:52.567 --> 00:29:53.867
of America, or
know the reason why."

00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:59.700
I don't want to make too
much of this editorial.&nbsp;

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.167
It's an editorial,
after all.&nbsp; Crisis was an

00:30:03.167 --> 00:30:06.900
important magazine.&nbsp; It
was very popular.&nbsp; Its

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.600
readership is skyrocketing,
there's no doubt about that,

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.700
but it is just an
editorial, right?&nbsp; Well,

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.200
if you look at a range
of different events,

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.200
whether it's
political, social,

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.700
economic, violence in
the race riots of 1917,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:30.200
particularly 1919, if you
look at a mentality that's

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.267
being expressed by soldiers
who had fought in the fields

00:30:34.267 --> 00:30:38.767
of Europe, trench warfare,
and come--come back with a

00:30:38.767 --> 00:30:42.000
heightened sense of
what is rightfully theirs,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.467
quite reasonably of
course, you start to see an

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.900
insistence.&nbsp; Some certainly
called it an impatience,

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.900
but an insistence amongst
black citizens to actually

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.567
have the rights which they
had as American citizens.&nbsp;

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.400
Blacks still suffered
terrible discrimination.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:17.700
They had difficulty securing
jobs or decent housing.&nbsp; But

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.200
with the shock of
lynched--lynched soldiers,

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.200
more than
anything else perhaps,

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.000
the new anger voiced by
leaders like Du Bois,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.400
there was a clear sense that
a new political climate that

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.100
was about to appear, that
insisted more ardently than

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.967
ever, in fact, that blacks
would have their civil

00:31:37.967 --> 00:31:40.867
rights, that they would have
their place at the table,

00:31:40.867 --> 00:31:46.867
or else.&nbsp; Now this sentiment
is captured most eloquently

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.100
by poet Claude McKay, who
wrote the famous anthem,

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:03.500
If We Must Die, in 1919.&nbsp;
I actually have it on--on

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.900
disc, on a--from
iTunes.&nbsp; I could play it,

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.000
but this poem is
rather dramatic,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.800
and daunting, and
challenging.&nbsp; And as it

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.967
turns out, Claude McKay's
voice is not any of those

00:32:19.967 --> 00:32:22.167
things.&nbsp; It sounds really--I
was so disappointed when I

00:32:22.167 --> 00:32:23.867
played it the first time,
expecting all this great

00:32:23.867 --> 00:32:26.767
drama, and it's kind of very
high pitched and kind of--it

00:32:26.767 --> 00:32:29.800
just doesn't--it lacks the
drama.&nbsp; So with apologies to

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.500
Claude McKay,
I'll read it myself,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.900
actually.&nbsp; [students laugh]
I can't write like him,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.900
but I can read the--I can
read the poem with a more--a

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.300
more appropriate voice, I'll
say.&nbsp; Claude McKay writes If

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.600
We Must Die in 1919, and
I mean the timing is no

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.200
accident.&nbsp; It's in
response to the violence

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.900
that's--that's--that's
being visited upon blacks

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:56.500
with--with a routine that is
sort of almost mind numbing,

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.100
violence being
visited upon them by the,

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.700
you know, soldiers being
lynched and violence being

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.300
visited upon them by
the--the riots in East St.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.800
Louis and Chicago, and
also the persistent sort of

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.400
social and psychological
violence that says,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:17.900
"You do not belong," that you
are an alien in your own land.&nbsp;

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.467
Claude McKay writes:

00:33:20.467 --> 00:33:22.700
"If we must die, let
it not be like hogs

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.500
Hunted and penned
to an inglorious spot,

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.900
While round us bark the mad
and hungry dogs,

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.100
Making their mock
at our accursed lot.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.467
If we must die--oh,
let us nobly die,

00:33:38.467 --> 00:33:41.767
So that our precious
blood be not shed in vein;

00:33:41.767 --> 00:33:44.100
then even the
monsters we defy,

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.100
Shall be constrained
to honor us though dead!

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.467
Oh, Kinsmen!&nbsp; We must
meet the common foe;

00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:52.267
Though far outnumbered,
let us show us brave,

00:33:52.267 --> 00:33:56.100
And for their thousand blows
deal one deathblow!

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:00.300
What though before us
lies the open grave?

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.367
Like men we'll
face the murderous,

00:34:02.367 --> 00:34:05.800
cowardly pack,
Pressed to the wall

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.200
dying, but fighting back!"

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:18.300
This poem becomes an
anthem for a new mentality,

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.900
certainly amongst
artist-intellectuals from

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:27.600
1919 moving forward.&nbsp; One
thing that's important,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.867
and I want to end on this
note.&nbsp; And it's--I confess

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:31.467
it's ending a little
earlier than I expected,

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:33.100
but I want to
end on this note,

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:40.367
because it brings together
many different strands.&nbsp; The

00:34:40.367 --> 00:34:41.900
poem is one of
social consciousness,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.867
of course.&nbsp; It's in response
to the violence that--that

00:34:43.867 --> 00:34:48.067
Claude McKay has witnessed,
or has been reading about

00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:52.100
certainly.&nbsp; But
what you start--what,

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.400
what you see
happening at this,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.200
sort of this nexus is
the voice of artists--what

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.200
you're going to
see, I should say,

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.300
is the voices of artists and
intellectuals rising to the

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:08.400
forefront, and ushering in
this new age of what I'll

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.900
just call cultural
insistence on being heard.&nbsp;

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.067
That's something we'll be
talking about next week when

00:35:14.067 --> 00:35:16.200
we get to the New
Negro Renaissance,

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.300
more famously or more
commonly known as the Harlem

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.700
Renaissance.&nbsp; This, although
the--I'm getting ahead of

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.700
myself here.&nbsp;
The renaissance,

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.600
the periodizing of the
renaissance is a complicated

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.800
matter.&nbsp; We can look at
this poem in this political

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.867
moment, in this
violent moment,

00:35:33.867 --> 00:35:36.167
in the moment when the
soldiers march up Fifth

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:41.900
Avenue to throngs, while
some people in that audience

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.500
were getting ready to
kill them.&nbsp; A moment of new

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.500
awareness, a new racial
voice on the American

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:53.200
scene.&nbsp; I'm actually
going to stop there,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.367
but I'm happy to
take questions,

00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:56.567
or if not, we can go our
merry ways.&nbsp; Are there any

00:35:56.567 --> 00:35:58.567
questions at all?

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.100
Yes?

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.500
To what extent
were communists like,

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:10.600
for instance, McKay,
militants?&nbsp; In other words,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.167
did they--did they
condone the use of violence,

00:36:15.167 --> 00:36:20.300
or were they just in
favor of protesting?

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.967
Well what they're in
favor--what the question is

00:36:21.967 --> 00:36:25.167
dealing with, you know,
the link or the connection

00:36:25.167 --> 00:36:27.700
between communists and
militancy and advocacy of

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:35.200
violence.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's--a
simple way to put it is that

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.900
what communism is in a state
of profound flux.&nbsp; It's just

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.800
being articulated, you
know, at this moment,

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.267
and you're going to see more
of that going through the

00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:44.100
1920s into the 1930s.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.100
Oops.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.300
&nbsp;But the--so whether some
advocated--some communists

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.000
advocated violence, some
advocated something else,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.100
it just depends on the--on
the individual.&nbsp; McKay and

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.767
others, you know these
people who traveled to

00:36:57.767 --> 00:37:00.500
Russia and then
the Soviet Union,

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.600
trying to find answers, you
actually have--and I'm glad

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:09.600
you asked it, because I
won't be talking about it so

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.700
much in this class, I don't
think--you have throughout

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.300
the 1920s, thirties,
and into the forties,

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.600
mostly in the 1930s,
certainly the rise of

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.100
pop--the popular rise of
Communism amongst black

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.500
Americans.&nbsp; I'll say
something about that later

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.500
on.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.767
But you actually have a
large number of African

00:37:28.767 --> 00:37:31.100
Americans,
especially professionals,

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.367
who become
card-carrying communists,

00:37:34.367 --> 00:37:35.800
but never talk
about it loudly,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.000
because they'll lose their
jobs.&nbsp; A lot of teachers,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.100
especially, and
certainly many more who were

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.100
sympathetic to Communism.&nbsp;
Now were they sympathetic to

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.500
it because they advocated a
class struggle?&nbsp; For many of

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.900
them no, because they were
occupying a niche in black

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.100
America that accrued
benefits.&nbsp; You know,

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.100
these were the middle class
in many ways.&nbsp; But were

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.100
they--they were
seeking civil rights.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.000
And this is something
I will come back to,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.467
is that you look at the
popularity of the Socialist

00:38:06.467 --> 00:38:08.067
Party and the Communist
Party amongst African

00:38:08.067 --> 00:38:10.667
Americans.&nbsp; It wasn't
necessarily because they're

00:38:10.667 --> 00:38:13.700
advocating the overthrow of
the capital machinery.&nbsp; It's

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.467
that they were
advocating, in the U.S.,

00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:18.767
a version of Communism, full
civil rights for African

00:38:18.767 --> 00:38:21.700
Americans, and that was,
that was the thing.&nbsp; That

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.067
was the quest for
African Americans,

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.067
citizenship.

00:38:24.067 --> 00:38:25.067
Yes?

00:38:25.067 --> 00:38:29.300
What was the readership of
poems like Claude McKay's in

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.367
the editorials?

00:38:30.367 --> 00:38:32.000
You know, it's always
hard to gauge the readership

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.300
of--of, well of anything,
and--and especially in this

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.500
case, and also like the
Chicago Defender and the

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.900
editorials that I mentioned
before and that you saw in

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.067
the--that you have
in the documents,

00:38:43.067 --> 00:38:50.200
because a lot of these
documents will be read by

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.500
communities.&nbsp; And I mean
that literally in the sense

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.800
that, you know, you might
have the paper coming down

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.967
and ending up in a
barbershop or a black public

00:38:59.967 --> 00:39:04.000
sphere--space, black public
space--space where you don't

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.267
know how many people are
actually literate there

00:39:07.267 --> 00:39:11.100
necessarily.&nbsp; These things
are being read out loud,

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.200
they're being
passed along, they're,

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.700
you know, going
from the barbershop,

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.700
to the beauty parlor, to
the dining room table.&nbsp; So

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.067
readership, we
don't--we don't really know,

00:39:17.067 --> 00:39:21.067
but when I talk about Claude
McKay's If We Must Die

00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:25.267
having importance, it
becomes an anthem.&nbsp; And in

00:39:25.267 --> 00:39:28.567
that way, in that way, I
mean to imply that it was

00:39:28.567 --> 00:39:33.867
known.&nbsp; Whether people
know all the words or not is

00:39:33.867 --> 00:39:37.100
something different,
but they know about it,

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.600
and they know this is a call
to a new kind of mentality

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.200
that they're ready to
embrace as well.&nbsp; I mean,

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.500
something they
thought was right there,

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.600
when the 369th
walked--marched up to,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.900
what I should have said, to
white and black applause,

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.500
going up to--up, up in
Harlem.&nbsp; These were national

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.467
heroes.&nbsp; But on local--and
when it came down to local

00:39:56.467 --> 00:40:00.467
matters, they were treated
quite differently.&nbsp; But

00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:06.467
we'll see in next week's
reading interesting terrain

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.767
about--around that kind of
question of who's following

00:40:10.767 --> 00:40:13.467
who.&nbsp; Overlapping this, and
I'm getting into Monday's

00:40:13.467 --> 00:40:16.300
lecture a little bit, is
the rise of Marcus--Marcus

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:23.400
Garvey's Universal Negro
Improvement Association.&nbsp; Do

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.300
I talk that much about
Monday or not?&nbsp; I don't

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.867
know.&nbsp; But that--that is
incredibly popular during

00:40:28.867 --> 00:40:33.367
this period and that's a,
sort of an X factor that's

00:40:33.367 --> 00:40:35.200
not mentioned for the
sake of clarity in today's

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.100
lecture.&nbsp; I'll clean that
up a bit on Monday.&nbsp; Yes?

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:43.967
You were talking
about a greater state of

00:40:43.967 --> 00:40:46.100
egalitarianism in France.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.100
Yeah.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:52.100
And I--I understand why in
the--the context of World

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.400
War I that made sense, when
France was so desperate,

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.900
but was France a much
more egalitarian society

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.200
considering they'd had these
brutal colonial endeavors,

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.767
you know in Algiers and in
the several different cities

00:41:02.767 --> 00:41:04.300
in the world?

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.300
But it wasn't in
Paris.&nbsp; I mean,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.300
I mean talking--the
question's about,

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.600
you know, the what's
the reality versus the

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.567
perception--the perception
versus the reality of

00:41:14.567 --> 00:41:19.600
egalitarianism in France,
and thinking about France as

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.200
a pretty vicious
colonial state,

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.200
especially in Francophone
Africa.&nbsp; There's no doubt

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.500
that there's the--the mixed
reality there.&nbsp; You have a

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.300
lot of black soldiers going
over to France.&nbsp; And what I

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.300
didn't mention, a
lot of them stayed.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.600
It's like, "I'm not going
back."&nbsp; And you have during

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:41.800
this period the rise of an
incredibly popular movement,

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.800
I mean this
American musical art form,

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.600
jazz, becomes incredibly
popular in France,

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.867
especially Paris,
during that time.

00:41:50.867 --> 00:41:52.700
Jazz musicians, dancers,
et cetera--and I'll be

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:56.000
mentioning a bit of this
this time next week--are in

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.867
the Parisian scene and
are incredible stars,

00:42:01.867 --> 00:42:02.900
and just don't
want to go back,

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.967
because they know they're
going to be treated horribly

00:42:04.967 --> 00:42:10.967
back--back home.&nbsp; There is
a--a rising awareness of

00:42:10.967 --> 00:42:13.767
what's actually happening in
places like Algeria during

00:42:13.767 --> 00:42:16.767
the same period, especially
as some of the intellectuals

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:23.967
start coming to Paris and
interacting with African

00:42:23.967 --> 00:42:26.067
American
intellectuals and artists,

00:42:26.067 --> 00:42:28.067
and interacting in
very curious ways,

00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:32.300
in very complicated ways.&nbsp;
This actually becomes more

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.900
prominent as you head
towards the Second World

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.500
War, and the rise of
anti-colonialist movements.&nbsp;

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.800
We aren't quite sort of
there yet as far as it being

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.400
articulated.&nbsp; But there's
always the difference

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.200
between what's happening
in the center and what's

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.800
happening in the provinces,
about what--what reality

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:56.867
looks like.&nbsp;
Anything else?&nbsp; Okay,

00:42:56.867 --> 00:42:58.867
have a lovely
day.&nbsp; Thank you.

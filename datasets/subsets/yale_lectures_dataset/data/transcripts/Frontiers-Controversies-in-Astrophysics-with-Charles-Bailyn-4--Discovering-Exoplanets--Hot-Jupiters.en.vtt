00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.130
Professor Charles
Bailyn: We were talking

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.060
last time about the objects in
the Solar System.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.247
And we'd gone through kind of
two of the three stages of the

00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:15.293
scientific method as it's
applied to observational science

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:17.920
rather than experimental
science.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.692
And the first thing was just
making observations,

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:24.313
finding a bunch of things.
And so I gave you a little

00:00:24.313 --> 00:00:29.090
slide show depicting some of the
objects in our Solar System.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.637
And after observations the next
thing to do is classification,

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:42.463
and we did some of that too,
and I divided all these objects

00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:45.600
that had been discovered into
six categories.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.962
And then, once you've done
that, once you have some

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:49.710
categories that kind of make
sense,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.596
then the next thing is to
interpret these results and to

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:57.200
try and explain where these
categories come from,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.989
how they arise,
and actually figure something

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.291
out.
And I've described that as

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:05.246
interpretation,
and I want to offer you a

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:09.680
little bit of interpretation
about what we've found about the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.907
Solar System.
Now, I only want to explain

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:18.357
some of the classifications.
This is actually a common thing

00:01:18.357 --> 00:01:19.897
to do.
When you find a whole bunch of

00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:22.167
different things and you've got
twelve classes and three

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:25.685
sub-classes and two exceptions,
you kind of want to explain the

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:29.505
big features first and then
worry about the little things

00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:31.189
later.
This is commonly done.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.208
So, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to talk about only the

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:42.672
inner terrestrial planets.
You'll recall that these are

00:01:42.672 --> 00:01:49.234
small, rocky things in
relatively short orbit,

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:55.650
and contrast them with the
outer planets,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.417
the Jovian, the Jupiter-like
planets, which are large and

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:05.530
have not only rocks,
but also lots of ice and gas.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.510
And these things are in wider
orbit, but the orbits of both of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.020
these are, basically,
more or less circular.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.864
Not precisely circular,
they're actually elliptical,

00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:21.262
but quite close,
and they're all in the same

00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:22.561
plane.
That is to say,

00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:24.490
they're all going around the
same way.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.009
There's nothing that's going
this way instead of this way.

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.759
So, they're circular and
co-planar.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:38.518
And let's try for an
explanation of those particular

00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:42.264
features.
Okay, so this would be

00:02:42.264 --> 00:02:47.501
something like a Theory of
Planetary Formation:

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:53.080
how the planets formed,
why they get that way.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.580
This word, "theory," is a
serious problem.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.130
This is one of the foremost
examples of a word that means

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.364
something different when
scientists use it than when

00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:05.482
normal people use it.
In scientific parlance,

00:03:05.482 --> 00:03:08.681
a theory is something which has
a lot of support,

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:12.479
which explains a lot of
observed or experimental fact.

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.950
In everyday life,
of course, a theory means a

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.824
wild guess.
So, there's a pretty stark

00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:21.289
difference between those two
definitions.

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.016
This gets our friends the
evolutionary biologists,

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:27.244
in all kinds of trouble because
they keep talking about the

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:30.006
theory of evolution.
And a certain segment of

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.692
society interprets that as the
wild guess of evolution and this

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:36.129
creates various kinds of
difficulties.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.703
The problem is,
there isn't another word that

00:03:38.703 --> 00:03:42.387
one can readily use for what the
science definition of this--you

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:46.099
could use "paradigm,"
you could use "scenario."

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.205
These are kind of ugly sorts of
words, so I think we're stuck

00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:52.836
with "theory."
But I mean this in the sense of

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:55.957
something that explains a lot of
facts, rather than in the sense

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:59.019
of wild guess.
Okay, so here we go:

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.922
Theory of Planetary Formation.
So, the idea is that the

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:13.570
planets form from a disk of
material around the Sun.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.534
So, the Sun and the planets are
created out of a collapsing

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:23.296
cloud.
The cloud collapses,

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:26.338
some parts of the cloud are
rotating, that prevents them

00:04:26.338 --> 00:04:29.085
from collapsing.
And so, you have a situation,

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:31.307
after a while,
where you have a sort of

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:34.582
star-like thing in the middle,
and then a kind of disk of

00:04:34.582 --> 00:04:37.315
stuff around it.
So, this is a side view,

00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:40.388
and in the top view,
all these things are in orbit

00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:42.900
here.
And this disk consists of

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.322
basically the same material as
the Sun, which is to say,

00:04:47.322 --> 00:04:50.619
lots of gas,
by which, I mean hydrogen and

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:54.622
helium in particular.
Some ice, of course,

00:04:54.622 --> 00:04:58.160
when it's in a star it's all
melted.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.574
But these are elements like
carbon, nitrogen,

00:05:01.574 --> 00:05:04.290
oxygen, that go into making
ices,

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.266
and a little bit of heavier
elements that could,

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:12.385
if you put them all together,
form dust and rocks,

00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:17.379
and things like that.
A little heavier element:

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:23.234
things like silicon and iron.
So, that's what the Sun

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:27.620
consists of, and so does this
disk orbiting around it.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.903
Then what happens?
In the disk,

00:05:31.903 --> 00:05:40.220
things gradually stick
together.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.620
So rather than having
individual atoms or molecules,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.220
the molecules and atoms sort of
run into each other,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.799
form dust grains,
the dust grains run--or ice

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.730
crystals or whatever,
those run into each other,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.270
form bigger things.
And you gradually make bigger

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.287
things as the little things
collide with each other and

00:05:58.287 --> 00:05:59.575
stick.
So in the disk,

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:02.822
things gradually stick together
and become tiny little objects,

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:05.650
which are sometimes given the
name "planetesimals."

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.129
And then the "planetesimals"
bump into each other and stick.

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:21.288
These stick together until
you've got a situation where in

00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:26.688
each region, each orbit,
each distance from the Sun,

00:06:26.688 --> 00:06:29.860
you've coalesced everything
into one large object.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:37.256
And so you end up with one big
object in each region,

00:06:37.256 --> 00:06:46.360
by which I mean distance from
the Sun, distance from the star.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.347
And this explains the orbits,
because since these large

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:54.630
objects have been created by
running a lot of small objects

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.188
together,
the ellipticity of any of the

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:03.385
elliptical part of the orbit of
any of these things tend to

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:05.665
cancel out.
Because one of these objects

00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:07.019
will be elliptical in one
direction;

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:09.240
another will be elliptical in
another direction.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.839
If you put them all together
they'll--that orbit will tend to

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.137
be circular.
Similarly, some of the objects

00:07:15.137 --> 00:07:17.810
will be going up out of the
plane of the Solar System,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.787
some will be going down,
but you'll run them together

00:07:20.787 --> 00:07:24.280
and they'll all end up with kind
of similar circular co-planar

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.859
orbits.
So makes approximately--that's

00:07:27.859 --> 00:07:31.202
the approximate sign
[~]--circular,

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:34.939
co-planar orbit.
So, that's good because that's

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:37.620
one of the things we're trying
to explain.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.497
And there is an expected
difference between how this

00:07:40.497 --> 00:07:43.769
works out in the inner parts of
the Solar System and how it

00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:46.759
works out in the outer parts of
the Solar System.

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:54.091
In the Inner Solar System the
ice and gas in the

00:07:54.091 --> 00:08:02.982
"planetesimals" evaporates and
does not become part of the

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:11.077
planet that gets formed.
And so the planets are only the

00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:14.416
rocky parts.
They actually hold onto a

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:17.970
little bit of the ice and gas,
but not very much.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:24.425
Whereas, in the Outer Solar
System, the ice is frozen,

00:08:24.425 --> 00:08:28.810
and so it behaves just like
rocks.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:35.940
And so planets have rocks and
ice.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.370
This means that they're
substantially more massive.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:46.213
And if they're sufficiently
massive, then they have enough

00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:51.750
gravity to hold onto the gas
also--onto gas as well.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.626
It's also true that in the
Outer Solar System there's more

00:08:54.626 --> 00:08:58.000
volume, there's more stuff,
and so there's more stuff to

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.070
build the planets out of in the
first place.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.699
And so, this nicely explains
the difference between the Inner

00:09:04.699 --> 00:09:07.240
Solar System and the Outer Solar
System.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.070
You build these things up out
of little chunks.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.173
But in the Inner Solar System
the temperature is high enough

00:09:12.173 --> 00:09:14.751
that the chunks of ice
evaporate, and so you can't

00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:17.491
build them up out of that.
And so you get much,

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.569
much smaller things made almost
entirely out of rocks,

00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:23.937
in contrast to the Outer Solar
System where you have enough

00:09:23.937 --> 00:09:26.566
ice,
you build much bigger planets,

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:30.710
and in some cases you hang on
to a lot of the gas as well.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:35.303
So, this is interesting because
it makes a prediction about how

00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:37.970
other Solar Systems ought to
look.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.367
Namely, that this difference
between inner planets and outer

00:09:42.367 --> 00:09:45.049
planets ought to exist
everywhere.

00:09:45.049 --> 00:09:48.375
That planetary systems--there
should be a general feature,

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:51.934
because there's nothing of what
I've said so far that's unique

00:09:51.934 --> 00:09:57.243
to the Sun.
So planetary systems should

00:09:57.243 --> 00:10:06.273
have inner rocky planets and
outer Jupiter-like planets,

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:15.139
sort of gas-plus-ice sorts of
planets, much bigger.

00:10:15.139 --> 00:10:21.337
And the dividing line between
these two kinds of planets is

00:10:21.337 --> 00:10:24.330
determined by temperature.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.255
Because there will be some
temperature where those ice

00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:36.907
things melt and therefore you
don't expect it to be at the

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:40.325
same distance away from a star.
You expect it to be at the

00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:42.179
place where the temperature is
the same.

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:45.605
Therefore, if you have a very
bright star, hot star,

00:10:45.605 --> 00:10:49.299
you'll have inner planets out
further from that star,

00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:52.299
inner-type terrestrial planets
will go out further.

00:10:52.299 --> 00:10:55.181
And if you have a very dim
faint star, which doesn't

00:10:55.181 --> 00:10:57.836
generate as much heat,
the gas planets will--the

00:10:57.836 --> 00:11:00.999
dividing line between the gas
planets and the terrestrial

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:05.976
planets will be much closer in.
So the dividing line is

00:11:05.976 --> 00:11:12.879
determined by temperature,
hence, by the luminosity--the

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:18.149
amount of energy given off of
the star.

00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:21.100
So now, this tells us what
we're supposed to do next.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.731
Namely, go out and find a whole
bunch of other Solar Systems and

00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:29.138
verify this prediction.
Namely, that if you've got a

00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:31.435
really bright,
hot star, you ought to have

00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:33.899
rocks out fairly far in the
Solar System,

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:36.706
whereas, if you have a dim
star, you'll have Jupiter-like

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:40.348
things coming in much closer.
And so that's what I want to

00:11:40.348 --> 00:11:43.704
talk about now,
is how people went about doing

00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:48.390
this and what the results were.
And I'll tell you the punch

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.735
line in advance,
which is that this totally

00:11:51.735 --> 00:11:55.146
doesn't work.
But it's an obvious prediction

00:11:55.146 --> 00:11:59.136
from our theory of planet
formation that came about by an

00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:03.410
examination of what was going on
in our own Solar System.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.490
Okay.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.820
So, observing exoplanets.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.736
How do you find these things?
And you'll recall we started

00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:25.639
down this track in the last
lecture.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:31.899
The key point here is that
stars move too.

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:34.632
It's not just the planet going
around a star,

00:12:34.632 --> 00:12:38.110
it's the planet and the star
both go around the center of

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.029
mass of the system and the stars
move, too.

00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:43.039
You can't see the planets
independently.

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:46.049
And there was a little
equation--the velocity of the

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:49.709
star times the mass of the star
is equal to the velocity of the

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:52.070
planet times the mass of the
planet.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:57.309
This is basically an equation
of momentum.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:13:00.728
The distance of the star to the
center of mass,

00:13:00.728 --> 00:13:04.147
times its mass,
is equal to the distance of the

00:13:04.147 --> 00:13:08.500
planet to the center of mass,
times the mass of the planet.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.960
This is kind of a definition of
the center of mass.

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:17.066
And sometimes,
you don't want to deal with the

00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:20.185
individual velocities or
distances, you want to deal with

00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:23.420
the total velocity or distances.
And so that's just defined

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.354
where if you want to talk about
the total that's obviously just

00:13:26.354 --> 00:13:29.100
D_star plus
D_planet.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:37.199
Similarly, for the total
velocity and the total mass,

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:44.182
and that's just defining terms.
And then, in order to relate

00:13:44.182 --> 00:13:48.129
these distances to things that
have shown up in our equations

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:52.148
and Kepler's Third Law,
it's true that the maximum

00:13:52.148 --> 00:13:55.966
value of the total
distance--that is to say,

00:13:55.966 --> 00:14:00.049
the distance between these
things can vary,

00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:02.019
because they can be in
elliptical orbits.

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:04.690
Sometimes they're closer than
others.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.644
And if you take the maximum
distance between them--that's

00:14:07.644 --> 00:14:10.600
the maximum of D_tot
al--that's a,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.630
 that's the semi-major axis
of the orbit.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:24.697
And now, for nearly circular
orbits, as the planets turn out

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:29.416
to be, then
D_total is

00:14:29.416 --> 00:14:33.418
always the same,
because if it's circular the

00:14:33.418 --> 00:14:35.370
distance between them doesn't
vary.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.158
So then,
D_total is more

00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:42.272
or less equal to the semi-major
axis because it's always the

00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:44.344
same,
therefore it's always near its

00:14:44.344 --> 00:14:46.438
own maximum.
And then, you can also say

00:14:46.438 --> 00:14:48.809
something interesting about the
velocity.

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:53.970
The velocity--what's the
definition of velocity?

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.550
Velocity is miles per hour,
or something like that.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.760
So, it's distance per time.

00:15:03.529 --> 00:15:08.082
And let's take a time period of
one orbital period and ask the

00:15:08.082 --> 00:15:12.559
question, how far does something
go in one orbital period?

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:14.570
Well, it goes all the way
around its orbit.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.186
And you may recall from high
school geometry that if you know

00:15:19.186 --> 00:15:22.264
the radius of a circle,
you also know its

00:15:22.264 --> 00:15:25.175
circumference.
The circumference is the

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.544
distance it would have to
travel, that's 2π times the

00:15:28.544 --> 00:15:31.429
radius.
This is the basic fact from

00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:35.177
geometry and so that's 2π times
the distance,

00:15:35.177 --> 00:15:38.259
in this case,
the semi-major axis.

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:41.793
But this is only true for
nearly circular orbits and the

00:15:41.793 --> 00:15:44.491
reason is that in highly
elliptical orbits,

00:15:44.491 --> 00:15:47.639
the velocity changes by a
substantial amount.

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:49.730
It moves much faster when it's
closer.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.911
And so you can only really
define what the overall velocity

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:57.299
of the thing is,
if you've got a nearly circular

00:15:57.299 --> 00:15:58.923
orbit.
But in that case,

00:15:58.923 --> 00:16:01.742
as is true for planets,
this 2πa over P

00:16:01.742 --> 00:16:06.412
gives you a value for velocity.
Now, so we have another little

00:16:06.412 --> 00:16:10.515
equation here,
V equals 2πa /

00:16:10.515 --> 00:16:15.694
P.
This is an important one,

00:16:15.694 --> 00:16:21.019
so you'll want to remember
that.

00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:23.248
And I should say,
which kind of Vs and

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.021
as, remember up here
there is

00:16:25.021 --> 00:16:27.287
V_star,
V_planet,

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:29.014
V_total,
all these different kinds of

00:16:29.014 --> 00:16:32.179
things.
What do I actually mean by that?

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:36.100
And it can mean any of them,
but it has to be consistent.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.698
So if you're dealing with the
velocity of the star then

00:16:40.698 --> 00:16:44.700
a is equal to
D_star.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.807
Remember these are all nearly
circular orbits so D

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:50.956
isn't going to change.
And if you've--if you're

00:16:50.956 --> 00:16:55.345
dealing with V of the
planet, then a is equal

00:16:55.345 --> 00:16:58.800
to D of the planet,
and that is approximately equal

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.980
to D_total.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.155
Because the mass of the planet
is so low that almost all the

00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:11.630
motion in the system comes from
the planet.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.845
So, you can also deal with
V_total

00:17:13.845 --> 00:17:15.440
_, which is
equal to

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.995
V_planet.
And so, all these things go

00:17:19.995 --> 00:17:22.458
together.
But if you're worried about the

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:24.339
velocity of the star,
you have to be careful,

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:28.145
because it's not a of
the orbit as a whole,

00:17:28.145 --> 00:17:32.727
it's just a tiny piece of the
orbit that involves the motion

00:17:32.727 --> 00:17:39.680
of the star.
Okay?

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.860
Let's do an example.
How fast does the Earth move?

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.299
V = (2πa) /
P.

00:17:58.299 --> 00:18:01.420
Well, we know a is equal
to one Astronomical Unit.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.960
P is equal to one year
for the Earth's orbit,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.917
and so the velocity of the
Earth is 2π Astronomical Units

00:18:08.917 --> 00:18:12.230
per year.
Pretty straightforward but not

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:16.088
very informative,
because we don't have a feeling

00:18:16.088 --> 00:18:20.829
for measuring velocities in
Astronomical Units per year.

00:18:20.829 --> 00:18:24.502
There's a joke in--a kind of
physics joke that you convert

00:18:24.502 --> 00:18:28.690
all velocities into furlongs per
fortnight just to be annoying.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.143
But let's not do that;
let's convert it instead into

00:18:32.143 --> 00:18:34.191
meters per second,
because then we have the hope

00:18:34.191 --> 00:18:35.760
of understanding what's going
on.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.602
V is equal to 2π.
One Astronomical Unit is 1.5

00:18:41.602 --> 00:18:47.008
times 10 to the 11 meters.
And a year is 3 x 10^(7)

00:18:47.008 --> 00:18:50.770
seconds.
π / 3 = 1.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:56.880
2 x 1.5 = 3.
10^(11) / 10^(7).

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.360
11 - 7 = 4.
So, this is 10^(4) meters per

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.980
second, that's 30 kilometers per
second.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.900
So, we move right along as we
go around the Sun.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.816
If you did this for Jupiter,
plugged in the various values

00:19:12.816 --> 00:19:16.390
for Jupiter--I won't actually do
that calculation,

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.010
you can do it on your own--you
discover that Jupiter moves

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.925
about half as fast as the Earth.
So, it goes around 15

00:19:23.925 --> 00:19:28.273
kilometers per second,
that's 1.5 x 10^(4) meters per

00:19:28.273 --> 00:19:31.144
second.
So now, we can ask the

00:19:31.144 --> 00:19:37.065
question, "How fast does the Sun
move in response to the orbit of

00:19:37.065 --> 00:19:47.391
these planets?"
So how fast is the solar motion

00:19:47.391 --> 00:19:54.525
induced by Jupiter?
Okay, and now we go back to

00:19:54.525 --> 00:19:57.868
this momentum equation.
Velocity of Jupiter times the

00:19:57.868 --> 00:20:01.940
mass of Jupiter is equal to the
velocity of the Sun times the

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.474
mass of the Sun.
What we want to know is the

00:20:05.474 --> 00:20:09.349
velocity of the Sun.
And so that is equal to the

00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:12.898
velocity of Jupiter,
which we just calculated,

00:20:12.898 --> 00:20:17.710
times the mass of Jupiter,
divided by the mass of the Sun.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.529
1.5 x 10^(4),
that's the velocity of Jupiter.

00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:24.881
Mass of Jupiter,
as it happens--I think I wrote

00:20:24.881 --> 00:20:28.160
this down last time,
2 x 10^(27) kilograms.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:35.440
Mass of the Sun, 2 x 10^(30).
Twos cancel, obviously.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:42.460
We get 1.5 x 10^(4).
Times 10^(27), that's 10^(31).

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.976
10^(31) / 10^(30)=10^(1).
Is equal to 15 meters per

00:20:47.976 --> 00:20:51.140
second, not kilometers now,
meters.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.943
And so the Sun--Jupiter moves
15 kilometers per second,

00:20:56.943 --> 00:21:00.920
the Sun moves 15 meters per
second.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.585
That makes perfect sense,
because the Sun is 1,000 times

00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:06.153
more massive than Jupiter,
so it has to be going 1,000

00:21:06.153 --> 00:21:08.571
times more slowly.
So instead of moving at some

00:21:08.571 --> 00:21:11.516
number of kilometers per second,
it's moving at some number of

00:21:11.516 --> 00:21:14.777
meters per second.
This, it turns out,

00:21:14.777 --> 00:21:19.390
can be detected with modern
equipment.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.839
"Detectable," let's say,
in distant stars.

00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:27.130
You can see things that move by
15 meters a second.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.050
We'll come back to how that's
done in a minute.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.900
How about the Earth?
Solar motion due to Earth.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.304
Now, you might think is going
to be bigger,

00:21:39.304 --> 00:21:41.993
because the velocity of Earth
is bigger than the velocity of

00:21:41.993 --> 00:21:43.251
Jupiter.
But, of course,

00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:44.769
the mass is much,
much smaller.

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:48.736
So we have M_earth
V_earth

00:21:48.736 --> 00:21:50.954
is equal to
M_sun

00:21:50.954 --> 00:21:53.981
V_sun,
where V_sun

00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:55.670
now means the motion induced by
Earth.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.343
This number is bigger than it
was for Jupiter,

00:21:58.343 --> 00:22:00.720
but this number's a whole lot
smaller.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.555
And so the overall effect is
that the V_sun

00:22:04.555 --> 00:22:07.703
is going to be smaller,
V_earth

00:22:07.703 --> 00:22:12.529
M_earth /
M_sun.

00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:16.049
That's 3 x 10^(4),
that's the velocity.

00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:18.439
Mass of the Earth,
as it turns out,

00:22:18.439 --> 00:22:20.900
is 6 x 10^(24) meters per
second.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.380
The Sun, down here at 2 x
10^(30), same Sun.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.933
6 / 2 = 3.
3 times 3 is 10,

00:22:28.933 --> 00:22:34.610
so we get (10^(1) x 10^(4) x
10^(24)) / 10^(30).

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:43.302
One--five--29 over 30.
That's 10^(-1) = 1 / 10 of a

00:22:43.302 --> 00:22:48.809
meter per second,
or 10 centimeters per second.

00:22:48.809 --> 00:22:51.921
So that's much,
much slower than the Sun moves

00:22:51.921 --> 00:22:54.240
in response to Jupiter.
Why?

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.970
Because the Earth is so much
less massive.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.206
So, 15 meters a second for--as
the result of Jupiter,

00:23:00.206 --> 00:23:05.013
only 10 centimeters a second,
a tenth of a meter per second,

00:23:05.013 --> 00:23:10.616
as a result of Earth.
And with current technology,

00:23:10.616 --> 00:23:15.966
things that slow are not
detectable, yet in

00:23:15.966 --> 00:23:21.461
other--around--in other stars.
So, we have a situation,

00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:24.259
and this is what was happening
about ten years ago,

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:26.748
where instruments had been
developed that could,

00:23:26.748 --> 00:23:29.025
in principle,
see the reflex motion of stars

00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:32.881
due to planets like Jupiter,
but weren't yet capable of

00:23:32.881 --> 00:23:37.369
seeing the motion of stars due
to planets like Earth.

00:23:37.369 --> 00:23:40.342
But, we expect that Solar
Systems ought to have planets

00:23:40.342 --> 00:23:42.654
like Jupiter,
and so people went out to try

00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:47.007
and look.
All right, how do you find--How

00:23:47.007 --> 00:23:52.236
do you observe these things?
And now, if you've taken high

00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:54.189
school physics,
you will recall,

00:23:54.189 --> 00:23:57.150
perhaps, something called the
Doppler Shift.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:57.750
This is the key.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.371
And this is a way of measuring
velocity and it turns out oddly

00:24:06.371 --> 00:24:10.293
enough that velocities are some
of the most easy and

00:24:10.293 --> 00:24:14.599
straightforward things to
measure in astronomical objects

00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:19.059
because you can determine them
by the Doppler Shift.

00:24:19.059 --> 00:24:23.359
And so just to remind you or to
inform you, if you haven't seen

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:25.972
this before,
and there is some help sheets

00:24:25.972 --> 00:24:28.690
and things that you can look at
about this too.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:37.179
Light is characterized by its
wavelength, which is usually

00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:42.690
given the Greek letter Lambda
[λ].

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:50.710
And light that is something
like 4 x 10^(-7) meters.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.260
A wavelength has units of
length.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:59.106
This looks blue to us.
Light that is--let's color code

00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:06.583
this for your convenience,
5 x 10^(-7) meters looks green,

00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:11.829
7 x 10^(-7) meters kind of
looks red.

00:25:11.829 --> 00:25:15.770
Longer wavelengths are what we
call "infrared."

00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:23.234
And shorter wavelengths that we
can't see are called

00:25:23.234 --> 00:25:28.599
"ultraviolet."
And so, ultraviolet up here.

00:25:28.599 --> 00:25:33.295
And if you get really,
really long--if you have,

00:25:33.295 --> 00:25:38.890
like, meter wavelengths--that's
radio waves, out here.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:45.637
And if you have really short
wavelengths, those are x-rays

00:25:45.637 --> 00:25:48.799
and gamma rays.
So, all of these kinds of

00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:51.696
radiation are basically the same
thing, called "electro-magnetic

00:25:51.696 --> 00:25:56.660
radiation";
again, there's a help sheet.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.949
These are all electro-magnetic
radiation, and what kind of

00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:06.690
radiation it is depends on the
wavelength.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:13.342
And the key to the Doppler
Shift is that the observed

00:26:13.342 --> 00:26:18.971
wavelength changes,
depending on the relative

00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:26.520
motion of the thing emitting the
light in the observer.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:33.500
Motion of source and observer.

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:43.679
In particular,
if they're moving toward each

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:49.950
other, then the wavelength gets
shorter,

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:54.150
and if they're moving away from
each other, the wavelength gets

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:54.760
longer.

00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:02.039
Do you feel an equation coming
on?

00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:04.848
Because obviously this is going
to need to be quantified,

00:27:04.848 --> 00:27:06.070
right?
How much shorter?

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:09.630
How much longer?
But before we do that,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.322
let me just point out that this
motion towards is sometimes

00:27:13.322 --> 00:27:17.269
called a "blueshift" because it
makes--it pushes the light from

00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:20.706
the red end of the visual
spectrum towards the blue and

00:27:20.706 --> 00:27:25.317
this kind of thing here,
the motion away from each other

00:27:25.317 --> 00:27:31.170
is called the "redshift."
And let me show you why this is

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.750
true before I write down the
equation.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:46.292
Let's see, it's just--let me
get out of that and try this one

00:27:46.292 --> 00:27:51.095
instead.
It's just a property of how

00:27:51.095 --> 00:27:54.930
waves look, so look what
happens.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.057
If the thing is stationary
there, in the middle,

00:27:57.057 --> 00:27:59.321
that's emitting the waves,
then the waves propagate

00:27:59.321 --> 00:28:02.760
equally in all directions,
and both observers see the same

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.109
distance between successive
waves.

00:28:05.109 --> 00:28:08.220
That is to say,
the same wavelength.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.368
And you can see that there.
Then, when the thing is moving

00:28:12.368 --> 00:28:15.699
in some direction,
each successive wave is emitted

00:28:15.699 --> 00:28:18.349
a little bit closer to one
observer,

00:28:18.349 --> 00:28:20.470
and a little further away from
the other observer.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.904
And so, because the waves are
emitted at different places,

00:28:24.904 --> 00:28:29.572
the wave fronts here--I'll wait
until this cycle goes through

00:28:29.572 --> 00:28:31.823
again.
The wave fronts for this

00:28:31.823 --> 00:28:35.384
observer are closer to each
other and the wavelengths looks

00:28:35.384 --> 00:28:37.591
shorter.
So, when the thing is coming

00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:40.874
towards you that's emitting the
wave, it looks shorter to the

00:28:40.874 --> 00:28:44.100
observer it's going towards.
Whereas, for this guy,

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.413
the waves--each successive wave
is emitted a little bit further

00:28:48.413 --> 00:28:50.581
away.
And so the wave fronts are

00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:53.246
further away from each other
when they pass,

00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:55.849
and then the wavelength becomes
longer.

00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:58.764
So, that's the kind of
conceptual thing that's going

00:28:58.764 --> 00:29:01.292
on.
And the key thing is that the

00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:06.008
velocity that's relevant here is
velocity toward and away from

00:29:06.008 --> 00:29:07.932
you.
If the thing is going sideways,

00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:11.226
it doesn't make any difference.
And so, it's not actually

00:29:11.226 --> 00:29:15.630
velocity that you observe by
looking at the Doppler Shift.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.760
It's radial velocity,
which is the technical term

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.869
for--is the thing coming towards
you or moving away from you.

00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:25.401
And how fast is it coming
towards you and how fast is it

00:29:25.401 --> 00:29:26.460
moving away from you?

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:36.410
Okay, let me turn this off here.

00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:57.050
So here's the equation for
that--let's see here.

00:30:01.079 --> 00:30:03.824
Lambda is the wavelength--I'll
explain all these terms in a

00:30:03.824 --> 00:30:04.250
minute.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.830
And this is important.

00:30:13.049 --> 00:30:16.804
And the terms mean the
following things:

00:30:16.804 --> 00:30:21.233
this is radial velocity
[V_r],

00:30:21.233 --> 00:30:26.240
and it's positive when it's
going away from you.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:35.460
It's negative when it's going
towards you.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.310
And it's zero when it's going
sideways.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.400
And it's a velocity,
it's in meters per second or

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.048
whatever the appropriate units
of--furlongs per fortnight,

00:30:48.048 --> 00:30:50.000
or whatever the appropriate
units are.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.444
The only restriction on the
units is, it has to be in the

00:30:52.444 --> 00:30:54.670
same units as the thing in the
denominator, here.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.600
That's C,
that's the speed of light.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.500
That's 3 x 10^(8) meters per
second.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.531
Maybe we should have you work
it out in furlongs per

00:31:07.531 --> 00:31:10.200
fortnight.
No, no, no, we won't do that.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.555
But as long as the velocity
here is expressed in the same

00:31:13.555 --> 00:31:17.091
terms as you express the speed
of light, then the units will

00:31:17.091 --> 00:31:21.515
work out.
This λ with the little zero at

00:31:21.515 --> 00:31:27.042
the bottom is the rest
wavelength, so that's the

00:31:27.042 --> 00:31:33.980
wavelength you would observe
from whatever light source,

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.283
electro-magnetic radiation
source you have,

00:31:36.283 --> 00:31:39.698
if nothing was moving.
And Delta Lambda [∆λ],

00:31:39.698 --> 00:31:44.002
this is not ∆ times λ.
That's one symbol,

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:48.880
confusingly enough.
Delta always means change;

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.806
you may remember this from
calculus if you've taken

00:31:51.806 --> 00:31:55.425
calculus.
Delta always means change,

00:31:55.425 --> 00:31:59.775
so this is a change in
velocity--sorry,

00:31:59.775 --> 00:32:05.524
change in the wavelength.
And it is defined such that the

00:32:05.524 --> 00:32:09.709
observed wavelength is equal to
the rest wavelength,

00:32:09.709 --> 00:32:14.141
plus the change in the
wavelength induced by the radial

00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:16.789
velocity.
So now, look how this works.

00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:21.505
If this side of the equation is
negative--if it's coming towards

00:32:21.505 --> 00:32:24.349
you--then this quantity is
negative.

00:32:24.349 --> 00:32:26.539
That means this quantity is
negative.

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:29.200
That means this quantity is
negative.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.821
That means the observed
wavelength is shorter than the

00:32:31.821 --> 00:32:33.850
rest wavelength,
which is exactly how it's

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.838
supposed to be.
When we come towards you,

00:32:35.838 --> 00:32:37.809
it's blueshifted,
the wavelengths get shorter.

00:32:37.809 --> 00:32:40.976
Similarly, if this is going--if
something's going away from you

00:32:40.976 --> 00:32:43.019
then V_r is
positive,

00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:45.293
this is positive,
and you end up with a longer

00:32:45.293 --> 00:32:49.900
wavelength.
Okay?

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.187
All right, example:
how fast do you have to go to

00:32:54.187 --> 00:32:58.461
turn a red light green?
This is potentially useful

00:32:58.461 --> 00:33:02.859
should you ever be pulled over
for running a red light.

00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:06.140
You can just say,
"it looked green."

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:14.750
How fast to make a red light
green?

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.330
And let's call green light 5 x
10^(-7) meters.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:29.042
Red light is 7 x 10^(-7) meters.
So ∆λ had better be equal to

00:33:29.042 --> 00:33:36.274
(7 - 5) x 10^(-7).
That's 2 x10^(-7) again in

00:33:36.274 --> 00:33:38.885
meters.
And we want this to be

00:33:38.885 --> 00:33:42.490
negative, because we want
λ_0 to be the red.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:46.697
That's what it would be like if
nothing was moving and we want

00:33:46.697 --> 00:33:49.180
λ_observed to be
green.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:54.930
And λ_observed =
λ_0 + ∆λ.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:59.900
And this had better be,
- 2 x 10^(-7) meters.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:06.831
And so ∆λ / λ _0,
that's (- 2 x 10^(-7)) over (5

00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:13.308
x 10^(-7)).So that's - 2/5 is
equal to the radial velocity

00:34:13.308 --> 00:34:19.188
over the speed of light.
So, if you're going at - 2/5

00:34:19.188 --> 00:34:24.199
the speed of light,
then the red light looks green.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:27.565
Now, the minus just means you
have to be moving toward that

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:29.402
light.
Now, two things about this,

00:34:29.402 --> 00:34:31.486
first of all,
don't use this as an excuse,

00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:34.281
because it'll cost you much
more in the ticket for going

00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:37.229
over the speed limit if you're
going at 2/5 of the speed of

00:34:37.229 --> 00:34:38.665
light.
Second of all,

00:34:38.665 --> 00:34:41.159
be wary of this a little bit
because there is,

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.930
in fact, a change to the
equation that happens when

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.480
you're going close to the speed
of light,

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.269
and we'll talk about that when
we get to relativity.

00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:52.400
And so this is just an example
of how this works out.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.849
But when you're dealing with
the motions of stars – 15

00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:58.922
meters per second,
10 centimeters a second--you're

00:34:58.922 --> 00:35:02.782
nowhere near the speed of light,
and so the equation that I

00:35:02.782 --> 00:35:06.453
wrote down is actually fine.
So, what do you expect to see

00:35:06.453 --> 00:35:10.155
when you're looking at a star,
which has a planet in orbit

00:35:10.155 --> 00:35:11.000
around it?

00:35:14.739 --> 00:35:21.094
Looking at a star in some kind
of orbit--so here's the radial

00:35:21.094 --> 00:35:26.201
velocity as a function of time.
And the key thing about orbits

00:35:26.201 --> 00:35:29.048
is that the radial velocity
changes, because first the

00:35:29.048 --> 00:35:32.164
thing's coming towards you then
later in its orbit it turns

00:35:32.164 --> 00:35:35.337
around goes the other way.
Then it comes back and it comes

00:35:35.337 --> 00:35:37.769
towards you, turns around and
goes the other way.

00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:41.532
So, the radial velocity will
change from positive to negative

00:35:41.532 --> 00:35:44.417
and back as the object first
comes towards you,

00:35:44.417 --> 00:35:48.473
then away from you.
And so, it'll look like this if

00:35:48.473 --> 00:35:52.519
you make a whole bunch of
observations of this.

00:35:52.519 --> 00:36:00.130
It turns out that for circular
orbits, this is a sine wave.

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:07.614
And if you were to observe
this, you could observe directly

00:36:07.614 --> 00:36:10.401
from such a plot,
if you made repeated

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:13.375
observations of the radial
velocity of a star,

00:36:13.375 --> 00:36:17.159
or some other thing in orbit,
you could observe two things.

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:19.451
First of all,
you would immediately be able

00:36:19.451 --> 00:36:21.469
to tell what the orbital period
is.

00:36:21.469 --> 00:36:25.677
That's the amount of time--this
is a time axis--it takes for the

00:36:25.677 --> 00:36:29.818
object to come back to the same
place in the orbit for a second

00:36:29.818 --> 00:36:31.621
time.
Second of all,

00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:36.170
you could tell something about
what the velocity is.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:41.273
The amplitude of this sine wave
is something to do with the

00:36:41.273 --> 00:36:45.057
overall velocity,
because that's the maximum

00:36:45.057 --> 00:36:48.489
velocity it has coming towards
you.

00:36:48.489 --> 00:36:53.557
But you have to be a little
careful here,

00:36:53.557 --> 00:37:01.920
because that's only true if the
object--if the orbit is edge-on.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.617
Let me explain what I mean by
that, we'll come back to this

00:37:04.617 --> 00:37:06.399
later.
If the orbit's going this way,

00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:09.125
then it never comes towards you
or goes away from you--it's

00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:11.243
always going sideways.
If, on the other hand,

00:37:11.243 --> 00:37:13.559
the orbit's going this way,
then first it comes towards

00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:16.535
you, then it goes away from you.
And if it's somewhere in

00:37:16.535 --> 00:37:20.287
between, you only see part of
the motion of the orbit in terms

00:37:20.287 --> 00:37:23.772
of radial velocity.
So, this amplitude is V

00:37:23.772 --> 00:37:26.898
if the orbit is edge-on.
If not, V is going to be

00:37:26.898 --> 00:37:28.900
more than that,
because you're only seeing part

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.348
of the motion.
That's a detail we'll come back

00:37:31.348 --> 00:37:34.502
to later.
So, this is what you expect to

00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:38.579
see if there's a planet going
around the star,

00:37:38.579 --> 00:37:41.661
and if you have enough
sensitivity in your measurements

00:37:41.661 --> 00:37:45.200
of the Doppler Shift to be able
to actually see that motion.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:52.291
Okay, so here's what they saw.
This is a star called 51

00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:57.019
Pegasus, in the Constellation of
Pegasus.

00:37:57.019 --> 00:38:00.358
It is a "solar analog,"
so-called, by which they mean,

00:38:00.358 --> 00:38:04.263
it's about as much like the Sun
as they can--as you can find if

00:38:04.263 --> 00:38:06.719
you go out and look at other
stars.

00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:08.570
So it's very,
very much like the Sun.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:13.305
This is a radial velocity curve.
I have taken the axis off for a

00:38:13.305 --> 00:38:17.717
reason I'll point out later.
This is radial velocity versus

00:38:17.717 --> 00:38:22.130
time, and this is exactly what
you expect to see.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:26.110
It goes up;
it comes down--very good news.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.820
This is exactly what you expect
to see for a planet.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.239
There are two problems here,
as it turns out.

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:37.024
Problem number one is the
X-axis,

00:38:37.024 --> 00:38:42.071
because it turns out,
the amount of time it takes you

00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:47.797
to go one orbit around for this
object is a little more than

00:38:47.797 --> 00:38:51.475
four days.
The shortest orbital period of

00:38:51.475 --> 00:38:55.230
a planet in our own Solar System
is that of Mercury,

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.823
which is eighty-eight days,
so this thing is way closer to

00:38:58.823 --> 00:39:01.659
the star than anything in our
solar system.

00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:06.504
X-axis problem is that
P is equal to around four

00:39:06.504 --> 00:39:12.072
days.
Problem number two is the

00:39:12.072 --> 00:39:16.770
Y-axis.
And now let me put some units

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.451
on to this thing.
I've done a very bad thing of

00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:22.482
showing you a graph with no
units, but it was just to

00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:26.930
prolong the suspense here.
V_R.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.260
Zero.
So, that's going sideways.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:35.300
This is 50 meters a second.
This is negative 50 meters a

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.489
second.
And so first it--here it's

00:39:37.489 --> 00:39:39.949
coming towards you,
there it's going away from you.

00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:43.948
And so, the amplitude of this
thing, and therefore the

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:47.720
velocity of the star,
is something like 50 meters a

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.081
second.
Now, it's less obvious why

00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:51.790
that's a problem,
but it is.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.538
And let me show you why.
Let me do the equation--do the

00:39:55.538 --> 00:40:01.349
equations a little bit.
Okay, so this is a solar analog.

00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:07.840
What is the semi-major axis of
the planets orbit?

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.962
Axis of planet.
We know P is equal

00:40:13.962 --> 00:40:19.864
to--let's see 4 / 365.24 is
equal to 1 / 100 is equal to

00:40:19.864 --> 00:40:25.579
10^(-2) in years.
That's four days over a year.

00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:30.139
And M is equal to 1
solar mass because it's a solar

00:40:30.139 --> 00:40:33.510
analog.
So, a^(3) = P^(2).

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:38.619
M = (10^(-2))^(2)
M is equal--one.

00:40:38.619 --> 00:40:44.085
10^(-4)-- So a is equal
to 10 to the--well let's--we got

00:40:44.085 --> 00:40:50.440
to do this right.
(100 x 10^(-6))^(1/3).

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:56.580
5^(3) = 125.
So the cube root of 100 is 5.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:04.204
5 x 10^(-2) Astronomical Units.
Or let's put it in real units

00:41:04.204 --> 00:41:07.119
here.
5 x 10^(-2).

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:12.880
An Astronomical Unit is 1.5 x
10^(11) meters.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:18.219
5 x 1.5 is like 7 x 10^(9)
meters.

00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:21.464
So that's how--that's the
semi-major axis--and if you

00:41:21.464 --> 00:41:25.209
compare it, if you go look at
the lists of planets in our own

00:41:25.209 --> 00:41:27.661
Solar System,
what you'll discover is that's

00:41:27.661 --> 00:41:29.980
way closer than any of the
planets in our own Solar

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.300
System--way closer to the star
than Mercury is.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.369
I haven't used the
Y-axis yet.

00:41:35.369 --> 00:41:38.227
Now I'm about to,
because what I'm going to do

00:41:38.227 --> 00:41:42.228
is, I'm going to take--I'm going
to figure out the velocity that

00:41:42.228 --> 00:41:46.039
this planet is moving at.
That's 2 π a / P.

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:47.690
You wrote that down a little
while ago;

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:54.183
a, I just figured out.
So, 2 times π times 7 times

00:41:54.183 --> 00:41:57.949
10^(9).
P is 1/100 of a year.

00:41:57.949 --> 00:42:00.684
So, that's 10^(-2),
times 3 x 10^(7),

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:03.950
which is the number of seconds
in a year.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:13.170
π / 3 = 1.
2 x 7 = 15.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:20.188
10 ^(9) – 10^(-2) x 10^(7).
10^(5) -- So,

00:42:20.188 --> 00:42:25.969
this is 15 x 10^(4),
or 1.5 x 10^(5).

00:42:25.969 --> 00:42:29.251
So this is thing is going--the
planet now, this is

00:42:29.251 --> 00:42:32.995
V_total,
which is approximately equal to

00:42:32.995 --> 00:42:36.365
V_planet,
is going at 150 kilometers a

00:42:36.365 --> 00:42:38.534
second.
Much faster than the Earth is

00:42:38.534 --> 00:42:40.239
going around;
well, that makes perfect sense.

00:42:40.239 --> 00:42:43.190
It's in closer--got to move
faster to stay in its orbit.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:47.970
And so, this is 150 kilometers
a second if you prefer those

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.987
units.
Now, we know the velocity of

00:42:50.987 --> 00:42:56.124
the planet, we know the mass of
the star, we know the velocity

00:42:56.124 --> 00:43:01.430
of the star and so we can figure
out the mass of the planet.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:04.293
Here's how it works.
M_p

00:43:04.293 --> 00:43:07.303
V_p =
M_star

00:43:07.303 --> 00:43:12.318
V_star.
V_planet,

00:43:12.318 --> 00:43:16.210
we've just figured out,
is 1.5 x 10^(5).

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:20.432
Actually, let's leave it as 15
x 10^(4), that'll turn out to be

00:43:20.432 --> 00:43:23.698
easier for the arithmetic.
The mass of the stars,

00:43:23.698 --> 00:43:26.539
the same as the mass of the
Sun, 2 x 10^(30).

00:43:26.539 --> 00:43:30.260
The velocity of the star we
just observed.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.137
We saw it moving back and
forth, it's 50 kilometers a

00:43:33.137 --> 00:43:36.375
second, 5 x 10^(1).
Okay, so now--and this is

00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:39.530
multiplied by the mass of the
planet.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:48.116
So, the mass of the planet is
equal to 2 x 10^(30),

00:43:48.116 --> 00:43:54.469
times (5 x 10^(1)) / (15 x
10^(4)).

00:43:54.469 --> 00:43:59.621
5 / 15 is a third,
so this is a third times

00:43:59.621 --> 00:44:04.159
10^(-3), times the mass of the
Sun.

00:44:04.159 --> 00:44:10.300
10^(-3) times the mass of the
Sun, that's the mass of Jupiter.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.759
So, this is equal to 1/3 of the
mass of Jupiter--which is,

00:44:13.759 --> 00:44:17.036
by the way, bigger than the
mass of Saturn or any other

00:44:17.036 --> 00:44:19.160
object in our own Solar System.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.099
Okay, so that's catastrophic,
right?

00:44:26.099 --> 00:44:29.931
That's a hopeless disaster,
because the first part of the

00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:33.694
lecture and the second part of
the lecture have entirely

00:44:33.694 --> 00:44:37.101
contradicted each other.
Because in the first part of

00:44:37.101 --> 00:44:39.498
the lecture I gave you a whole
song and dance,

00:44:39.498 --> 00:44:42.374
and you all wrote it down,
and it sounded believable at

00:44:42.374 --> 00:44:45.088
the time.
How inner planets were going to

00:44:45.088 --> 00:44:50.844
be these small rocky things.
And now the very first planet

00:44:50.844 --> 00:44:58.945
we go out and find turns out to
be a very close planet that's

00:44:58.945 --> 00:45:01.240
quite massive.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.965
And this is impossible
according to this nice little

00:45:08.965 --> 00:45:13.248
theory of planetary formation
that I promulgated to you

00:45:13.248 --> 00:45:18.057
earlier in the lecture.
And so, the very first planet

00:45:18.057 --> 00:45:22.380
that was observed turned out to
be a screw-up.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:28.991
Worse than that,
there were soon dozens more

00:45:28.991 --> 00:45:34.212
like it discovered.
These are given the name "Hot

00:45:34.212 --> 00:45:37.510
Jupiters," and you can see what
the problem is.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.825
If you figure out what the
surface temperature of these

00:45:40.825 --> 00:45:43.650
things ought to be,
it's over 1,000 degrees.

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:47.702
There's no way you could have
gas or ice on such a thing,

00:45:47.702 --> 00:45:52.946
it would totally melt.
And there aren't enough rocks

00:45:52.946 --> 00:45:58.630
in the whole rocky
elements--silicon and iron,

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.978
and so forth--in the whole of
the planetary system of our own

00:46:01.978 --> 00:46:04.489
Solar System to add up to 1/3 of
a Jupiter,

00:46:04.489 --> 00:46:06.720
even if you put them all
together.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:13.599
So how is this done?
What is going on here?

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:17.519
It seems clear that one of the
two things must be true.

00:46:17.519 --> 00:46:22.440
Either this thing isn't a
planet and there's some other

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.269
explanation for this attractive
bunch of data here,

00:46:27.269 --> 00:46:32.502
or something has gone seriously
wrong in our understanding of

00:46:32.502 --> 00:46:35.985
how planets form.
And stay tuned,

00:46:35.985 --> 00:46:40.000
we'll talk about that next
time.

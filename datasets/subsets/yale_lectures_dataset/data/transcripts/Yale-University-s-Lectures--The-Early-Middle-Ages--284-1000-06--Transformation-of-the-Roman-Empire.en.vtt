00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.933
PAUL FREEDMAN: Today
we're going to talk about the

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.700
transformation of the
Roman Empire.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.333
And I use the somewhat neutral
and undramatic word

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.167
"transformation." It can be
"fall of the Roman Empire,"

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:18.567
"collapse of the Roman
Empire..." It's clear that

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:22.733
we're talking about the fall
of the Western Empire.

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.267
Next week we'll talk
about the survival

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:28.300
of the Eastern Empire.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:36.000
From 410 to 480, the Western
Roman Empire disintegrated.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.500
It was dismembered by barbarian
groups who were,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.967
except for the Huns, not
really very barbarian.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:48.933
That is, they were not intent
on mayhem and destruction.

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:53.233
All they really wanted to do was
to be part of the Empire,

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:59.133
to share in its wealth and
accomplishments, rather than

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.300
to destroy it.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.533
Nevertheless, 476 is the
conventional date for the end

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:11.333
of the Western Empire, because
in that year, a barbarian

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.000
chieftain deposed
a Roman emperor.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.067
Nothing very new about this
for the fifth century.

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:22.200
What was new is that this
chieftain, whose name is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.733
spelled all sorts of different
ways, but in

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.733
Wickham, it's Odovacer.

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:35.867
Sometimes he's known as Odacaer,
Odovacar, Odovacer.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:38.700
We aren't even sure
what so-called

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.167
tribe he belonged to.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:47.300
A barbarian general deposed
the child emperor Romulus

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.033
Augustulus, who by an
interesting coincidence, has

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:57.300
the names of both the founder
of the city of Rome and the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.200
founder of the Roman Empire.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.500
The "-us" on the
end is little.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.567
It's a diminutive.

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:08.300
So a man with this grandiose
name, a child, deposed in 476.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.733
And instead of imposing another
emperor, Odovacer

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:16.733
simply wrote to Constantinople
and said, "We're going to be

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:18.033
loyal to you.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:23.333
We will recognize you as the
sole emperor." Constantinople,

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:25.067
however, was far away.

00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:28.933
And while of symbolic
significance, this pledge of

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:33.100
loyalty by Odovacer had no
practical significance.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.200
For all intents and purposes,
the Western Empire had, in

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.933
476, become a collection
of barbarian kingdoms.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:45.300
A kingdom is smaller
than an empire.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.267
We use the term empire to mean
a multi-national, very large

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:55.800
state ruled from one center,
but consisting of many

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.633
different kinds of pieces.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:03.100
Kings, and the term and title
"king", is of German origin.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.333
Kings are very powerful, but
over a more limited territory.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.367
So there was a king
of Italy now.

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:18.033
There would be a king of the
Franks, or Francia, the former

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:19.233
Roman Gaul.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:21.233
There would be a king
of the Lombards

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.067
later in northern Italy.

00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:26.667
A king of the Visigoths, first
in southern France and Spain.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.400
And we'll go over who
is where at the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.067
beginning of next class.

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:38.500
For now, we're going to talk
about this collapse and its

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.167
consequences.

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:40.400
And we're going to
orient ourselves

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.233
around three big questions.

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:44.333
One--

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:47.667
why did the west fall apart?

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:52.367
And as a corollary to that
question, was this because of

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:56.300
the external pressure of
invasions or the internal

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.467
problems of institutional
decline.

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:04.300
Did it fall of its own
accord or was it

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.633
pushed, in other words?

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:07.833
Question number two.

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:11.233
Or big question number two.

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.867
Who were these barbarians?

00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:17.700
And how Romanised or how
different from Rome were they?

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.900
And that's what we're going to
talk about more on Wednesday,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.133
next class.

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:31.967
And three, does this
transformation mark a gradual

00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:37.400
shift to another civilization,
or is it the cataclysmic end

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.667
of the prevailing form of
civilization, ushering in a

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:46.667
prolonged period of what used
to be called The Dark Ages?

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:48.133
The Dark Ages--

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:53.200
roughly the sixth to
eleventh century.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.167
This is a term we don't
like to use.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.367
It implies a value judgment
that is not only not

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:09.267
necessarily accurate, but also
expresses a certain kind of

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:12.633
point of view of what are good
periods in history and what

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:16.500
are bad periods in history.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.533
But I'd like to just probe this
third question first.

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:27.500
That is, how severe a
catastrophe was this?

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.233
So is it the end of
civilization, a la Planet of

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:38.800
the Apes or Blade Runner, or
any of those apocalyptic

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.833
images we have?

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:44.733
Or is it merely a shift in
power and the survival of

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:49.633
Roman institutions such as the
Church, while Roman political

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:51.000
infrastructure--

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.133
the emperor, the consoles, the
pratorian prefects, and so

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:57.700
forth-- while that collapses?

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:03.700
A medieval historian named Roger
Collins in a book called

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.567
The Early Middle Ages writes,
"The fall of the Roman Empire

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:10.033
in the west was not the
disappearance of a

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:11.933
civilization.

00:06:11.933 --> 00:06:16.500
It was merely the breakdown of
a governmental apparatus that

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:23.833
could no longer be sustained."
The key word here is "merely."

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:28.933
The destruction of the Roman
political apparatus may simply

00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:33.600
mean that the Roman state ceased
to function, but that

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.800
everything else continued.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.900
But really, the question is,
could everything else continue

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.333
in the absence of a state and
of a political order?

00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:51.500
The destruction of the political
order also means,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.100
after all, the destruction
of the military system.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.767
When we opened this class, we
talked about a civilization

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.900
built on such things as the
rule of law and the

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.500
maintenance of peace.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.333
These are no longer possible
if there is no military

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:12.733
governmental structure.

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:18.400
As we'll say a little later, to
some extent people didn't

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.367
know that it was the end.

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:27.100
Because for a while, things
seemed to go on as before.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.200
People were speaking Latin, they
were living in cities,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.000
the cities were much less
populated, but nevertheless,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.667
they were still there; there
were still rich people; there

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:40.967
were still poor people.

00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:42.400
In retrospect, though,
we can see that

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.133
things really did change.

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:48.167
How much they changed is the
subject of a lot of historical

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.733
controversy.

00:07:49.733 --> 00:07:54.100
The world of the late Roman
historians is divided, roughly

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.533
speaking, between catastrophists
and

00:07:57.533 --> 00:07:59.233
continuists.

00:07:59.233 --> 00:08:03.733
As you may guess, the
catastrophists think the fall

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:07.733
of the Roman Empire--, whether
we date it 476 or there's some

00:08:07.733 --> 00:08:11.100
reasons to date it, really,
550 for reasons we'll

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.400
learn in next week.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.767
Between 450 and 550, a
catastrophe happened.

00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:21.300
A civilization was wiped out.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:30.100
And really, if not literally a
Dark Ages, a more primitive,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.800
more war-like, more illiterate,
and more rural

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.433
period was ushered in.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.667
The disappearance of ancient
texts, things that the Romans

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:48.267
knew from that lost Hortensius
dialogue of Cicero that

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:55.633
Augustine was so fond of, to
many other kinds of works that

00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:57.300
had been known to the
Roman world, right?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.300
I can't remember exactly how
many plays Aeschylus wrote,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.367
but it's something
on the order of

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:04.667
60, and we have three.

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:06.633
So the disappearance of text.

00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:10.633
The end of literacy, except for
a very small portion of

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.900
the Christian clergy.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.000
A more primitive architecture.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.233
The end of grand civic projects
like aqueducts,

00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:28.000
coliseums, theaters, baths.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.300
A more isolated society without
these urban centers.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.900
A diminished population spread
across the countryside, mostly

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.967
engaged in subsistence.

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:43.367
Hence, the, if not end
of trade, the radical

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:46.300
diminution of trade.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.967
The continuists, people like
Collins whom I just quoted,

00:09:50.967 --> 00:09:54.333
see the political changes as
dramatic all right, but as

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:59.700
essentially surface phenomena
based partly on archaeology

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.433
and partly on a more sympathetic
understanding of

00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:03.700
Christian practices.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.333
In other words, they don't think
that the proliferation

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:10.567
of churches, saints, cults,
is necessarily a sign of a

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:11.667
primitiveness.

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.467
So based on both archaeology
and an understanding of

00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:17.800
Christianity, these continuists
point to the

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:26.467
survival of trade, the role of
bishops and other church

00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:30.700
officials, as replacing
the Roman governors.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.667
The Roman political order may
have collapsed in terms of

00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:39.433
staffing by lay people and
military people, but the

00:10:39.433 --> 00:10:42.167
bishops were now the
rulers of the city.

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:45.100
The bishops would now do things
like ensure the food

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.867
supply, rally the local
population against barbarian

00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:52.600
invasions, educate
the populace.

00:10:55.433 --> 00:10:59.467
And the barbarian kings
themselves try, with some

00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:05.733
success, to perpetuate
the Roman order.

00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:07.667
They collect taxes,
for example--

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:11.233
that may or may not
be a good thing.

00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:14.500
They engage in some kind of
public works, some kind of

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.467
maintenance of order.

00:11:17.467 --> 00:11:23.833
The civilization of the sixth
and seventh centuries in what

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:27.133
comes to be considered Western
Europe, rather than the

00:11:27.133 --> 00:11:33.100
Western Roman Empire, is not
radically more barbarized or

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.533
primitive than the late
Roman Empire.

00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:38.067
Thus, the continuists.

00:11:38.067 --> 00:11:41.867
My own position, but I don't
hold to it dogmatically, is

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:53.200
that of a moderate
catastrophist. I think

00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:01.700
something really happened; I
think it's pretty radical; and

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.200
it didn't happen all
at once, however.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.967
476 is not the year
of collapse.

00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:08.700
It is a process.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.033
I'm fascinated by the degree to
which people were and were

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:14.167
not aware of the cataclysm,
but I

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.300
believe there is a cataclysm.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.167
Wickham, the author of this book
that we're starting now

00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:23.467
The Inheritance of Rome, Chris
Wickham, straddles the fence,

00:12:23.467 --> 00:12:24.467
as you've seen.

00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:28.400
His chapter that you were to
read for today is entitled,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:34.500
"Crisis and Continuity: 400 to
550." I would never use a

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.200
chapter title like that,
because it's really

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.033
frustrating.

00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:40.567
Which is it, dude?

00:12:40.567 --> 00:12:43.733
He's the leading medieval
historian in the English -

00:12:43.733 --> 00:12:45.367
speaking world.

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:48.633
He is Chichele Professor
at All Souls, Oxford.

00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:53.733
And if that doesn't sound
impressive, well, it takes a

00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:54.467
lot to impress you.

00:12:54.467 --> 00:12:57.900
He's a very great historian,
but I don't like

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.133
that chapter title.

00:12:59.133 --> 00:13:06.933
As I said, I would emphasize
crisis or change cataclysm.

00:13:06.933 --> 00:13:10.033
Well, let's ask what happened,
beginning with the gradual

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:12.667
involvement of the barbarians
in the military and their

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.167
entrance into the empire.

00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.367
We're using the term
"barbarians", which goes back

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:21.133
to the Greek term applied
to outsiders.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:25.200
People outside but
threatening.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.833
The Greeks defined barbarians
as uncivilized by reason of

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:35.000
their speech, which sounded to
them incoherent, and by reason

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.467
of the fact that
they're nomads.

00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:41.433
People who lead settled lives
don't trust nomads.

00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:47.000
Nomads almost extinct in our
world, once dominated many

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.967
geographical regions and were
frightening, because they

00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:56.600
moved to around to people who
liked order and familiarity.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.567
They didn't live in cities,
whether they

00:13:58.567 --> 00:14:00.300
were nomadic or not.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.733
Barbarians were illiterate.

00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:06.900
This is the Greek idea
of barbarians.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:12.033
In the case of Rome, there is
no single definition of

00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:15.433
barbarian society.

00:14:15.433 --> 00:14:22.167
We can say that Rome was
overthrown by a war-like, but

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:26.900
not very fierce, group
of enemies.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.767
And I use enemies in
a very mild sense.

00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:33.167
The Romans perceived them as
enemies; the barbarians

00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:36.800
perceived Rome as simply
a nicer place to live.

00:14:39.767 --> 00:14:47.567
But there is no Mongol horde
kind of event here.

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:49.100
They're not that frightening.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.800
The Romans had known
them for centuries.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.000
Most of them were even
Christians Heretical

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.033
Christians, OK.

00:14:58.033 --> 00:15:04.400
They're Arians, A-R-I-A-N-S, I
remind you, but they're not

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.467
unfamiliar, again, even
in their religion.

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:12.033
They've been at the borders of
the Roman empire forever.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.733
Like most empires, Rome was at
the one hand, very aggressive,

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:24.333
and on the other hand thought
of itself is peace-loving.

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:27.733
It maintained the Danube-Rhine
frontier as a kind of natural

00:15:27.733 --> 00:15:30.433
frontier, every so often
crossing those rivers to

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:34.067
punish German tribes who
were probing the

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.300
frontiers of the empire.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.767
But generally speaking, the
Romans were not interested in

00:15:38.767 --> 00:15:42.033
what they perceived, somewhat
inaccurately, as endless

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:44.933
forests inhabited by
primitive people.

00:15:49.467 --> 00:15:52.333
The continuists argue, with some
justice, that between 250

00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:56.067
and 600 what changed was not
that primitive warriors

00:15:56.067 --> 00:15:59.033
conquered a civilized state,
in the way that say, the

00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:04.833
Mongols conquered China in the
thirteenth century, but that

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:08.767
the ancient world became
the medieval world.

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:13.500
That is, an urban culture
became more rural.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.133
A Latin culture became
amalgamated to a German one.

00:16:18.133 --> 00:16:21.600
Pagan society became
Christian.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.767
Having said this, it's
nevertheless true that the

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:27.500
most dramatic event to the fifth
century is that people

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.933
who had been outside the
empire were now in it.

00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:37.067
If we ask why the Western Empire
collapsed, the simple,

00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:40.367
most immediate answer is it
was taken over by German

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:44.033
confederations, tribes.

00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:46.533
They came not so much as
conquerors as military

00:16:46.533 --> 00:16:52.600
recruits, or as allies,
or as refugees.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.733
So rather than as guys with
knives in their teeth hacking

00:16:57.733 --> 00:17:03.500
and slashing and burning, they
came as pathetic refugees,

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.400
maybe doing some hacking,
slashing, and burning; as

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.133
military recruits; and
as military allies.

00:17:12.133 --> 00:17:18.900
Again, not without a certain
amount of H. S. B.: hacking

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.400
and slashing and burning.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.200
But not a cataclysmic amount.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.600
They admired Rome.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.033
They wanted to continue
its institutions.

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:33.567
They regarded Rome as a
rich and as civilized.

00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:38.100
The last thing they wanted was
to still live in little huts

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.333
in the forest.

00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:44.533
They were not the bringers
of a revolution.

00:17:44.533 --> 00:17:48.667
They were not even that
numerous, amounting to some

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:49.933
tens of thousands.

00:17:55.267 --> 00:17:59.533
Nevertheless, they ended Roman
government, accelerated the

00:17:59.533 --> 00:18:01.533
changes we've already
described towards

00:18:01.533 --> 00:18:04.067
depopulation, decentralization,

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:05.300
ruralization--

00:18:10.967 --> 00:18:14.800
a less cultivated, less
literate, less Mediterranean-

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.900
centered society.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.167
So I want to begin the
description of this process by

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:23.567
the changes in the Roman army.

00:18:23.567 --> 00:18:29.100
We saw that Diocletian, around
300 AD, militarizes Roman

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.767
government, pays for the,
perhaps, doubling of the

00:18:33.767 --> 00:18:39.533
military presence of the
Roman army by changing

00:18:39.533 --> 00:18:40.700
the taxation system.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.833
So the twin pillars of the
empire in the fourth century

00:18:43.833 --> 00:18:48.900
are army and taxation, the
latter requiring a civilian

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.133
governmental apparatus.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.300
The army was a problem
in terms of the

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.367
recruiting of soldiers.

00:18:58.367 --> 00:19:01.400
This may have to do with the
population; it may have to do

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.200
with the unattractive nature
of military life, but

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.100
nevertheless there was already,
in the fourth

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:15.300
century, a tendency to get the
more familiar barbarians into

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.900
the army as Roman soldiers.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:23.400
Because they were available,
they were near the frontiers--

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.033
this may seem odd.

00:19:26.033 --> 00:19:32.400
Why hire your potential
enemy to be soldiers?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.133
But there's a lot
of precedent.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:39.300
Very often, empires don't really
want to supply their

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.433
own manpower.

00:19:42.433 --> 00:19:46.267
And the people who are the best
soldiers are also the

00:19:46.267 --> 00:19:49.767
people who may, in the future,
be most threatening.

00:19:49.767 --> 00:19:54.267
I don't want to pursue this
simile, but the Afghan

00:19:54.267 --> 00:19:59.400
Mujahidiee were trained by
Americans, because at one time

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.433
they were opposed to the
Russian occupation of

00:20:02.433 --> 00:20:03.533
Afghanistan.

00:20:03.533 --> 00:20:06.367
As it happened, in retrospect,
that had some bad

00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:07.600
consequences.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.433
But at the time, it seemed
like a good idea.

00:20:12.433 --> 00:20:19.300
So in the 370s a group called
the Visigoths asks to be

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.333
admitted to the Roman Empire
as an allied army.

00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:32.600
In other words, the whole group
will be federated with

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.267
the Romans.

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:39.900
And federati is the term given
for barbarian troops serving

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.233
under the Roman Empire.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.767
Why were they on the move?

00:20:46.767 --> 00:20:50.267
These are not really
nomadic people.

00:20:50.267 --> 00:20:56.433
They don't live in yurts or
travel across Central Asia.

00:20:56.433 --> 00:20:59.400
They tend to be settled
in villages.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.100
They have dairy cattle rather
than have some kind of nomadic

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.033
sheep, or something like.

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:08.300
They're pretty settled.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.533
Nevertheless, in 378, they
were on the move.

00:21:12.533 --> 00:21:17.700
And we don't know why.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.700
Some enemy pushing them
across the Danube

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.033
into what's now Romania?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.100
It may be the weakness
of the Empire.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.167
They may have seen that the
empire was not so strong and

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:36.200
made a proposition, kind
of like a takeover.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:43.367
You don't seem to be doing so
well in your stock or your

00:21:43.367 --> 00:21:48.567
finances, so we're going to
infuse some capital into you,

00:21:48.567 --> 00:21:50.600
i.e., our soldiers.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.733
They also may have
been hungry.

00:21:52.733 --> 00:21:55.467
Certainly, once they crossed the
frontier, the Romans were

00:21:55.467 --> 00:21:58.600
rather inept in feeding them,
in supplying them, and the

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.800
Visigoths rebelled.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.933
Thus far, nothing
incredibly new.

00:22:04.933 --> 00:22:09.733
What really was new was that the
emperor came with an army

00:22:09.733 --> 00:22:11.400
to suppress them.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.433
And rather to his surprise and
everybody else's, the emperor

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:23.200
Valens was defeated at the
battle of Adrianopole.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.667
Defeated by the barbarians.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.733
Yeah.

00:22:28.733 --> 00:22:31.767
STUDENT: So, being involved in
this federati, what did they

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.700
get from the Roman Empire?

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.933
Did they agree to fight for them
and then they'd get land?

00:22:35.933 --> 00:22:37.533
PROFESSOR: They
agreed to fight for them and

00:22:37.533 --> 00:22:41.100
they got a combination of land,
or supposed to get land

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.233
or territory, and some
kind of maintenance

00:22:45.233 --> 00:22:47.933
in kind and or money.

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:51.933
The question was about what the
Visigoths, as federati,

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:53.867
got out of this deal.

00:22:53.867 --> 00:22:55.233
Or were supposed to get.

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:05.233
The defeat at Valens was not
immediately cataclysmic,

00:23:05.233 --> 00:23:09.100
because, even though he was
killed at this battle, even

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.600
though it sent shock waves
throughout the empire, in

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.233
fact, it would not be this area
that succumbed to the

00:23:15.233 --> 00:23:21.700
barbarians--, the East. Romania,
or the Balkans would

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.900
be part of the Eastern Empire.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.167
And indeed, both Adrianople the
city, and Constantinople,

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:32.300
the even greater city, would
withstand Visigothic attempts

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.133
to take them.

00:23:34.133 --> 00:23:37.100
In 382, the Visigoths were
officially recognized, and

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.200
they were allowed to settle in
the Balkans as federati.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.133
And in fact, they were
reasonably useful troops to

00:23:43.133 --> 00:23:49.433
the Roman Empire in
the 380s and 390s.

00:23:49.433 --> 00:23:51.800
What this does show,
however, is the

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.467
barbarization of the army.

00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:57.600
And another aspect of that is
that the army tended to be

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.200
commanded now more and more
by barbarian generals.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.167
These barbarian generals, at
the top, bore the title

00:24:08.167 --> 00:24:10.900
magister militum--

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.800
master of the soldiers.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.467
So I'm using the term "general"
as an anachronistic

00:24:18.467 --> 00:24:22.400
one, since that's what
we're familiar with.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.667
These magistri were powerful
leaders, charismatic leaders,

00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:39.400
of German or other tribal
groups, who then ruled in the

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.667
name of, or behind the throne
of the emperor.

00:24:43.667 --> 00:24:47.900
They couldn't be emperors
themselves, at least in these

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.800
years, it was impossible to
envisage a barbarian emperor.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.067
But they held more power
than the emperors.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:06.767
Two of these generals, war
leaders, magistri, Stilicho

00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:07.733
and Alaric.

00:25:07.733 --> 00:25:13.133
Stilicho was a Vandal Alaric
was a Visigoth.

00:25:13.133 --> 00:25:19.067
Alaric wanted territory, food,
treasure from Rome.

00:25:19.067 --> 00:25:24.033
The Visigoths were moving from
the Balkans into Greece,

00:25:24.033 --> 00:25:27.600
eventually into Italy.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.533
Stilicho played a kind of game
with Alaric, trying to keep

00:25:31.533 --> 00:25:35.033
him in check in the name of the
Western emperor, but also

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.500
negotiating with him.

00:25:40.133 --> 00:25:45.067
The emperors moved from Milan
in the north to Ravenna, a

00:25:45.067 --> 00:25:48.500
little bit to the east. Ravenna,
then, was in the

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.733
marshes and impossible for
a barbarian army to take.

00:25:53.733 --> 00:25:58.667
This is the last capital of
the Western Roman Empire.

00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:03.867
Kind of romantic and mysterious,
but strange as a

00:26:03.867 --> 00:26:05.467
place to end up.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.200
These are the Visigoths then,
who are on the move in the

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.400
390s and the 400s.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:22.500
Eventually, Stilicho would be
executed by the Roman emperor

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.867
of the West and Alaric
would invade and

00:26:26.867 --> 00:26:29.300
plunder Rome in 410.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.867
It was the Visigoths who
engineered the so-called Sack

00:26:33.867 --> 00:26:38.067
of Rome that so shocked
Augustine and his

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:39.333
contemporaries.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.233
Where, you might be asking
in all of this,

00:26:48.233 --> 00:26:51.133
was the Roman army?

00:26:51.133 --> 00:26:55.400
Alaric was wandering around the
Balkans and Italy for two

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.000
decades before he sacked Rome.

00:27:01.233 --> 00:27:05.367
The army, which had consumed
so much of the resources of

00:27:05.367 --> 00:27:11.200
the Roman Empire, is curiously
absent in the history of the

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.133
fifth century.

00:27:13.133 --> 00:27:19.333
This is not the Eastern
Front in World War II.

00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:23.000
This is something altogether
different: the collapse of an

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.900
empire that expended
huge amounts of

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.433
treasure on its army.

00:27:28.433 --> 00:27:33.200
Its army seems to be invisible
and supports, to some extent,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.033
or that fact supports to some
extent--, the argument that

00:27:36.033 --> 00:27:40.400
the Roman Empire collapsed of
its own internal disorders,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.633
since we don't see it losing
pitched battles to outside

00:27:43.633 --> 00:27:44.900
barbarians.

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:50.100
Or maybe the army doesn't
disappear, it becomes

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.533
indistinguishable from
the invaders.

00:27:52.533 --> 00:27:54.200
The army is the invaders.

00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:59.600
Creepier.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.733
Now within this, there are
some real barbarians--

00:28:02.733 --> 00:28:05.100
the Huns.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.967
The Huns are kind of nomadic.

00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:11.500
OK, they didn't actually cook
their meat by holding it

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.700
between their thigh and the
horse hide, and the sweat and

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.700
heat of the horse heated
up the meat.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.667
This is a widespread myth
of nomadic peoples.

00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:24.133
The Chinese say this about
the Mongols, the

00:28:24.133 --> 00:28:25.433
Romans about Huns.

00:28:25.433 --> 00:28:29.433
But they were pretty mean.

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:30.700
They were interested
in the Roman

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.667
Empire mostly for plunder.

00:28:32.667 --> 00:28:37.667
And they didn't care if that
destroyed the economic base,

00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:41.200
because they weren't thinking
in such terms. And indeed,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.467
they may have frightened the
rather nice German tribes that

00:28:46.467 --> 00:28:48.767
stood between them and
the Roman Empire.

00:28:48.767 --> 00:28:51.600
In the 450s the Huns were
united under the

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.167
leadership of Attila.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:08.267
And Attila certainly threatened
the Eastern Empire

00:29:08.267 --> 00:29:11.900
first, but the Eastern emperor
defeated the Huns,

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.367
discontinued tribute to them,
and in a pattern that we'll

00:29:16.367 --> 00:29:20.533
see repeated again and again,
the Huns decided that

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:23.200
Constantinople was too tough.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.833
That the Eastern Empire as a
whole, access to which was

00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:29.733
more or less controlled
by Constantinople,

00:29:29.733 --> 00:29:32.167
was too well guarded.

00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:35.267
And they turned to
the west instead.

00:29:35.267 --> 00:29:39.233
Not as rich maybe, but
much easier pickings.

00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:42.533
They show up in Gaul in 450.

00:29:42.533 --> 00:29:45.200
They were defeated
by an army of

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.467
Visigoths allied with Romans.

00:29:51.533 --> 00:29:53.000
They then went to Italy.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.800
They went into the heart of the
Empire, sacked cities in

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.400
the northeast of Italy,
and there's no army.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.433
The emperor is holed
up in Ravenna.

00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:07.433
basically shuts the door, gets
under the bed, and waits for

00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:08.967
it to go away.

00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:16.267
The one power of Italy willing
to try to deal with Attila is

00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:20.333
the Bishop of Rome, whom we
haven't heard of yet, but

00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:22.700
we're going to be hearing
about him a lot.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.100
And indeed, in the course that
follows this, even more.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.533
The Bishop of Rome-- the pope.

00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:35.233
Pope Leo I, along with two
senators from the Roman

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:40.667
senate, goes up to northern
Italy to remonstrate with

00:30:40.667 --> 00:30:47.033
Attila, to visit the leader of
this barbarian tribe in 453 to

00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:51.933
try to get him to stop
plundering Italy.

00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:54.033
Whether they were successful
or not doesn't much matter,

00:30:54.033 --> 00:30:56.933
because Attila died shortly
thereafter of a brain

00:30:56.933 --> 00:30:58.100
hemorrhage.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.000
And with his charismatic
leadership, the Huns came to

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.800
an end as a military force.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.533
That is, with the end of his
leadership, the Huns no longer

00:31:09.533 --> 00:31:13.200
had as imposing a military
force and quickly

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.433
disintegrated.

00:31:16.267 --> 00:31:19.600
What's significant is that it's
the pope who is taking

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.600
over what we would think of
as the Roman imperial

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.900
responsibilities.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.600
And this will be a pattern, not
only in the assertion of

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.867
papal power, but in the way in
which the Church starts to

00:31:30.867 --> 00:31:36.667
take over many of the roles
abandoned by the empire.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.200
After this, the barbarian
generals, in

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.033
effect, take charge.

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:53.200
The Huns are defeated, but
the other groups now

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.933
pour into the empire.

00:31:56.933 --> 00:32:00.300
The Vandals have taken over
North Africa by this time, by

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:06.500
430, cutting off the grain
supply to Rome.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.633
They are unusual among the
barbarian groups in that they

00:32:09.633 --> 00:32:10.700
have a navy.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.033
They know how to use boats, and
indeed, they plunder the

00:32:13.033 --> 00:32:17.033
city of Rome in 455 in a sack
that might have been worse

00:32:17.033 --> 00:32:22.300
than that of 410.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.400
By 470, the Visigoths control
southern Gaul, what's now

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:34.433
southern France; a group called
the Suevi are in Spain;

00:32:34.433 --> 00:32:40.500
the Vandals in North Africa; a
group called the Ostrogoths in

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:53.133
what's now Hungary; the Angles
and the Saxons in Britain.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.533
All that effectively remained
of the Western empire when

00:32:58.533 --> 00:33:02.700
Odovacer overthrew Romulus
Augustulus was Italy.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.900
And in 476, that's it.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.233
A little coda, however.

00:33:09.233 --> 00:33:14.133
In 493, the Eastern emperor in
Constantinople convinced the

00:33:14.133 --> 00:33:22.300
Ostrogoths to get out of
Hungary, stop threatening the

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.033
Eastern Empire, and take
Italy from Odovacer.

00:33:27.033 --> 00:33:31.300
Once again, the Eastern Empire
is capable of deflecting

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:36.433
barbarians into the west,
because they're too strong.

00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:43.033
So in 493, our friend Odovacer
was overthrown by the

00:33:43.033 --> 00:33:47.033
Ostrogoths and their
leader Theoderic.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.867
So what's the impact
of all of this?

00:33:56.867 --> 00:34:02.100
On the ground, if you were
looking around in 480s 490s,

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.133
you would see a kind
of accommodation.

00:34:05.133 --> 00:34:09.900
The Roman elite accommodated
themselves to, compromised

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.900
with, negotiated with,
their new rulers.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:27.000
So, for example, a member of a
very wealthy Roman family, a

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:40.633
man named Sidonius Apollinaris
in southern France, was a

00:34:40.633 --> 00:34:43.967
bishop and a great landowner.

00:34:43.967 --> 00:34:46.567
And we have a lot of letters of
his that tell us about his

00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:51.067
negotiations with the Visigothic
king Euric.

00:34:51.067 --> 00:34:57.367
He found the Vsigoths uncouth,
hard to deal with, not

00:34:57.367 --> 00:35:02.267
knowledgeable of the Latin
classics, but not very

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:05.300
frightening, either.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.700
Not particularly formidable.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.867
So accommodation,
improvisation.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:20.300
We have a saint's life that
is a biography of a

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.667
saint, a man named--

00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:25.267
I'm sorry that I'm writing on
the board so much today.

00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:30.100
Usually, as you know, I'm a
little more in control.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.200
But these are great names.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.733
And some of them are good cats
names or dog names, too.

00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:37.367
Severinus of Noricum.

00:35:37.367 --> 00:35:39.700
You know, "Stop scratching the
furniture, Severinus." That

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.900
kind of thing.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.333
Severinus of Noricum.

00:35:42.333 --> 00:35:45.400
A saint in what's now, more
or less, Austria.

00:35:48.333 --> 00:35:56.700
His life tells us that he
learned of the end of the

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.400
Roman Empire this way:

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.633
"At the time when the Roman
Empire was still in existence,

00:36:03.633 --> 00:36:06.633
the soldiers of many towns were
supported by public money

00:36:06.633 --> 00:36:08.533
to guard the frontier.

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:12.067
When this arrangement ceased,
the military formations were

00:36:12.067 --> 00:36:14.833
dissolved, and the frontier
vanished.

00:36:14.833 --> 00:36:18.667
The garrison of Passau, which
is still a town in modern

00:36:18.667 --> 00:36:25.000
Bavaria, the garrison
of Passau,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.667
however, still held out.

00:36:26.667 --> 00:36:31.100
Some of the men had gone to
Italy to fetch for their

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.267
comrades their last payment."

00:36:34.267 --> 00:36:36.333
This resembles a corporation--

00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:37.967
somebody, actually, was telling
me yesterday they

00:36:37.967 --> 00:36:41.033
worked for Eastern Airlines,
a company that went out of

00:36:41.033 --> 00:36:42.833
business in 1990.

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:45.767
And so sudden was the collapse
of Eastern, even though it had

00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:50.067
been predicted, that she was a
flight attendant and had to

00:36:50.067 --> 00:36:53.567
get on another airline
in order to get home.

00:36:53.567 --> 00:36:57.467
She lived in New York; she was
in Florida; Eastern ceased to

00:36:57.467 --> 00:36:59.933
exist. So these soldiers are
in the same position.

00:36:59.933 --> 00:37:03.267
They want to get their
last paycheck.

00:37:03.267 --> 00:37:05.267
They were never heard
from again.

00:37:05.267 --> 00:37:07.700
Nobody knew that they, in
fact, were killed by

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.200
barbarians on the way.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.200
"One day, when Saint Severinus
was reading in his cell, he

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.667
suddenly closed the book
and began to sigh.

00:37:17.667 --> 00:37:20.967
The river, he said, was now
red with human blood.

00:37:20.967 --> 00:37:23.600
At that moment the news arrived
that the soldiers had

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.300
been washed ashore
by the current."

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.733
Interestingly enough, he
doesn't just stay in

00:37:29.733 --> 00:37:31.867
his cell and pray.

00:37:31.867 --> 00:37:35.967
He starts to organize
this society.

00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:41.167
He is active, although some of
it involves some miracles, in

00:37:41.167 --> 00:37:43.033
poor relief.

00:37:43.033 --> 00:37:46.967
He deals with the local
barbarian king, the king of

00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:55.833
the Alamanni, remonstrates
with him.

00:37:55.833 --> 00:38:00.167
He helps in diverting
Odovacer into Italy.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.267
Again, like Pope Leo, we have a
member of the church, and in

00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:10.433
this case somebody that you
would think was a recluse,

00:38:10.433 --> 00:38:15.067
indeed had been living like a
recluse, nevertheless taking

00:38:15.067 --> 00:38:21.333
over the responsibilities for a
population abandoned by its

00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:24.000
civilian government.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.200
That is then one of the forms
of accommodation.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.933
Another aspect of this era,
however, is decline.

00:38:36.167 --> 00:38:39.800
The urban population declines.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.067
The society and economy
experienced what Wickham

00:38:43.067 --> 00:38:46.500
euphemistically calls,
"a radical material

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.333
simplification." The term
he uses, I believe,

00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:52.633
on page 95 and 105.

00:38:52.633 --> 00:38:56.433
"Radical material
simplification" means that

00:38:56.433 --> 00:39:00.267
your standard of living
plummets.

00:39:00.267 --> 00:39:01.600
Cruder ceramics.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.433
Instead of that nice, north
African red slip ware, you've

00:39:05.433 --> 00:39:08.867
got mud that you
baked at home.

00:39:08.867 --> 00:39:14.400
Fewer imports, no pepper.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.633
More homemade, crude
building materials.

00:39:19.633 --> 00:39:20.900
Fewer luxury goods.

00:39:24.367 --> 00:39:28.000
The Vandal control of North
Africa meant the end of the

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.967
Roman wheat supply.

00:39:33.033 --> 00:39:36.533
The countryside of Rome had not
grown enough wheat to feed

00:39:36.533 --> 00:39:41.200
the city since 200 BC.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.933
So for 600 years, minimum, Rome
was dependent on other

00:39:46.933 --> 00:39:48.333
sources of supply.

00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:52.100
Southern Italy, Sicily,
North Africa.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:58.467
The moment the Vandals cut the
supply, the city could no

00:39:58.467 --> 00:40:02.967
longer support its massive
population,

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:05.867
could not feed everybody.

00:40:05.867 --> 00:40:09.167
When you multiply this
phenomenon, it's not a

00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:12.833
surprise that the city's decline
in population, and

00:40:12.833 --> 00:40:17.467
that the society becomes more
rural, more agricultural, more

00:40:17.467 --> 00:40:18.400
subsistent

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.200
And here's where I think Collins
is naive to speak of

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.867
merely a political decline.

00:40:25.867 --> 00:40:30.133
Without a government and
military structure, trade

00:40:30.133 --> 00:40:33.333
could not take place on the
scale it had before.

00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:36.533
And without that trade, cities
could not survive.

00:40:39.067 --> 00:40:43.233
There is no denying a decline
in culture, economy, and

00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:44.467
population.

00:40:47.433 --> 00:40:53.500
Let's just look at Roman
population figures, based on

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.267
things like pork supply figures,
public-- well, I

00:40:57.267 --> 00:40:58.933
mean, nobody took a
census in Rome.

00:40:58.933 --> 00:41:02.267
We don't really know exactly how
many people lived there at

00:41:02.267 --> 00:41:03.900
any given time.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.467
But historians and
archaeologists looking at

00:41:06.467 --> 00:41:11.300
things like food supply, public
welfare payments, water

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.467
delivery figures, for aqueducts,
and the abandonment

00:41:15.467 --> 00:41:18.367
of houses and of
building sites.

00:41:18.367 --> 00:41:26.400
Probably in 5 BC, the Roman
population was 800,000.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.600
That would be a fairly
conservative estimate.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.400
Maybe as much as a million,
but definitely 800,000.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.133
5 BC.

00:41:34.133 --> 00:41:35.000
Yeah?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.200
STUDENT: This is just
the city of Rome?

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.300
PROFESSOR:
Just the city of Rome.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.900
Yes, just the city of Rome.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.500
At the time of Constantine,
sort of where we begin the

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:51.133
course, more or less, in the
early fourth century, the

00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:57.533
population had declined
probably to 600,000.

00:41:57.533 --> 00:42:06.533
After the sack of Rome in 419,
probably 300,000 to 500,000.

00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:09.033
Obviously, these are
very rough figures.

00:42:09.033 --> 00:42:12.733
But after the sack of Rome,
more than half of the

00:42:12.733 --> 00:42:19.133
population that had existed
in 5 BC is gone.

00:42:19.133 --> 00:42:23.533
With the end of grain shipments
from North Africa,

00:42:23.533 --> 00:42:25.867
we don't really know
immediately.

00:42:30.633 --> 00:42:35.767
We can estimate that by 590,
there could not have been more

00:42:35.767 --> 00:42:39.867
than 150,000 people in Rome.

00:42:39.867 --> 00:42:43.800
This is after not only the
Vandals, but after a

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.467
catastrophic war in Italy
launched by the Byzantine

00:42:47.467 --> 00:42:50.433
Emperor Justinian, who we'll
be talking about next week.

00:42:53.533 --> 00:42:58.300
In 800, on Christmas Day,
Charlemagne was crowned in

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:03.100
Saint Peter's in Rome as Roman
Emperor by the pope, an act

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.467
whose implications we will
be exploring towards

00:43:05.467 --> 00:43:06.967
the end of the class.

00:43:06.967 --> 00:43:14.233
On that day, Rome must've had
maximum, maximum, most

00:43:14.233 --> 00:43:21.200
optimistic estimate,
30,000 people.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.700
This does not necessarily mean
that they were primitive, but

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.400
they were living in the
Coliseum, for example.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.500
People built houses in there.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.900
They used the walls of the
Coliseum as a fort.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.033
There is a certain Planet of
the Apes quality, in fact.

00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:41.533
Rome, still to this day, is
filled with picturesque ruins,

00:43:41.533 --> 00:43:44.500
even though it is a city
of two and a half,

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.733
three million people.

00:43:48.867 --> 00:43:51.467
As I said, people were
not necessarily

00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:53.433
aware of this change.

00:43:53.433 --> 00:43:56.533
For example, lots of churches
were built at this time, and

00:43:56.533 --> 00:44:00.533
some of them have mosaic
pavements that have mottos

00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:04.000
about the grandeur of the Roman
name, and the usual

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.233
classical kind of mottos.

00:44:07.967 --> 00:44:10.367
But then again, people often
aren't aware of what's

00:44:10.367 --> 00:44:11.300
happening to them.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.467
I mean, what if somebody in the
future points to the fact

00:44:14.467 --> 00:44:20.067
that New Haven, in 1920, had far
more people living in it

00:44:20.067 --> 00:44:22.867
than it does now?

00:44:22.867 --> 00:44:25.433
New Haven lost a third
of its population

00:44:25.433 --> 00:44:29.000
between 1950 and 1980.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
What if some future historian
is scandalized at the fact

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.733
that in order to get into Yale a
hundred years ago you had to

00:44:36.733 --> 00:44:39.267
know Greek and Latin.

00:44:39.267 --> 00:44:45.100
If you look at what those
gentlemen C Students had to

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:50.900
study, or were responsible
for, in say, 1925, it's

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.000
extraordinary.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.367
It's not very impressive in the
sciences, but the decline

00:44:55.367 --> 00:44:59.533
of the humanities, if by decline
we mean things like

00:44:59.533 --> 00:45:03.100
knowledge of classical
literature, is stunning.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:07.867
Somebody may decide in a few
hundred years that the Dark

00:45:07.867 --> 00:45:12.267
Ages began in about 1950.

00:45:12.267 --> 00:45:20.300
And that those pathetic people
in, say, 2011, impressed with

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.600
their little technological
toys,

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.767
nonetheless didn't know
anything.

00:45:25.767 --> 00:45:28.000
Now I don't actually
believe that.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.200
There are some people who do.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.200
There's a philosopher at Notre
Dame named Alasdair MacIntyre

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.867
who really believes that the
Dark Ages began a long time

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:38.933
ago, and we simply don't know.

00:45:38.933 --> 00:45:41.667
We simply refuse to
recognize this.

00:45:41.667 --> 00:45:45.000
I was impressed by an obituary
for a man named Patrick Leigh

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.533
Fermor, who died at the age
of 96 earlier this year.

00:45:52.533 --> 00:45:57.433
This is the last of the great
British characters of the

00:45:57.433 --> 00:45:58.867
twentieth century.

00:45:58.867 --> 00:46:03.000
He not only was classically
trained, wrote a lot about

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.767
Greece, lived in Greece, he, in
World World II, disguised

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:15.933
himself as a Greek shepherd in
Crete, engineered the capture

00:46:15.933 --> 00:46:19.533
of a German general, and the
delivery of that general after

00:46:19.533 --> 00:46:22.067
three weeks of hiking through
the mountains of Crete to a

00:46:22.067 --> 00:46:24.133
British destroyer.

00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:28.533
It's in a movie called Ill Met
By Moonlight, if you ever want

00:46:28.533 --> 00:46:30.133
to check this out.

00:46:30.133 --> 00:46:31.533
Not a great movie, but--

00:46:31.533 --> 00:46:34.167
Patrick Leigh Fermor also
wrote two books out of a

00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:39.133
projected three about walking
from Holland to Constantinople

00:46:39.133 --> 00:46:44.100
or, Baghdad actually, I
think, in the 1930s.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:52.200
But the obituary describes a
conversation he had with this

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:58.033
German general, whom he is
trying to get across Crete.

00:46:58.033 --> 00:47:00.900
And the general at one point,
over some fire in the

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:06.533
wilderness, quotes a line from
Horace, the Roman poet, that

00:47:06.533 --> 00:47:09.100
then Patrick Leigh Fermor
finishes is for him, and

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:13.900
indeed, quotes the
next two stanzas.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.667
Well, that world is over.

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.333
That world is over.

00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:21.800
I don't pretend to be part
of that world, either.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.767
And that's a world that would
have existed in the time of

00:47:28.767 --> 00:47:32.667
Horace, or the years after
Horace, who lives at the time

00:47:32.667 --> 00:47:34.633
of Augustus.

00:47:34.633 --> 00:47:38.500
This would have existed in 300 A
D. It would have existed, at

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.067
least, in a few monasteries
in 800 AD.

00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:44.233
It would have flourished in the
Britain of the eighteenth

00:47:44.233 --> 00:47:48.533
and nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries.

00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:55.633
So again, I don't think that
civilization came to an end.

00:47:58.133 --> 00:48:02.567
What came to an end was a
civilization, a certain kind

00:48:02.567 --> 00:48:03.833
of society.

00:48:05.867 --> 00:48:11.800
It has some heirs, however,
like all dead entities.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.433
There are four heirs to
the Roman Empire.

00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:22.767
One is the Byzantine Empire,
the Eastern Roman Empire,

00:48:22.767 --> 00:48:24.733
which calls itself
the Roman Empire.

00:48:24.733 --> 00:48:27.067
It doesn't call itself the
Eastern, doesn't call itself

00:48:27.067 --> 00:48:29.767
the Byzantine, it calls itself
the Roman Empire, even though

00:48:29.767 --> 00:48:32.700
it does so in Greek.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.133
The second heir are the
barbarian kings.

00:48:36.133 --> 00:48:37.767
We'll be talking about
them on Wednesday.

00:48:37.767 --> 00:48:44.333
They are attempting to prop up
the remnants of Roman culture,

00:48:44.333 --> 00:48:47.533
civilization, and material
society.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.700
The third heir in some ways, is
Islam, which we meet in the

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.267
seventh century, the century
of its invention.

00:49:01.267 --> 00:49:02.767
And the fourth heir
is the Church.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.267
Even though the Church grew up
in opposition to the Roman

00:49:08.267 --> 00:49:14.833
Empire, it will preserve Latin,
cities, learning,

00:49:14.833 --> 00:49:18.000
classical civilization.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.433
OK.

00:49:18.433 --> 00:49:20.133
So barbarians on Wednesday.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.678
Prof: So before we go on
to talk a little bit about the

00:00:06.678 --> 00:00:10.072
American historicist
hermeneutical scholar

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:13.300
E.D. Hirsch,
and then Wolfgang Iser--for

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.190
whom you have your reading
assignment--

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.374
I want to go back to Gadamer a
little bit and say something

00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:26.046
more about his taste,
that is to say,

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:31.238
the kind of literary and
intellectual canon that his

00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:35.310
approach to hermeneutics
establishes.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.811
You remember Gadamer is very
much concerned with the norm of

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:42.680
classicism,
which later in his essay he is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.900
inclined to call
"tradition"

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.726
instead,
and the reason that's so

00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:52.906
important to him is that he
actually has a very conservative

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:57.646
view of what the reader can
accomplish in understanding

00:00:57.646 --> 00:00:59.490
another horizon.
 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.685
Gadamer, in other words,
doesn't think that the reader

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:08.354
can perform any great miracles
in intuitively feeling his or

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:12.549
her way into the mind of another
time and place,

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.477
so that the value of classicism
and of tradition for Gadamer is

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:21.849
that there is evident common
ground in certain texts.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:24.659
Sometimes we refer to them as
"great books"--

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.250
in other words,
the sort of text that speaks,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.330
or we feel as though it's
speaking,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.519
to all places and times.
 

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:37.781
Of course, it's contested
whether or not there is really

00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:41.190
any merit in talking about texts
that way.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.757
But Gadamer's view is very
strongly that this conservatism

00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:50.215
about the canon,
which is intimately related to

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:56.479
his conservative doubt about the
actual capability of a reader to

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.838
span enormous gaps--
and I use that word advisedly

00:02:00.838 --> 00:02:05.421
because it is the word that Iser
uses to talk about the distance

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:09.938
between the reader and the text,
and the way in which that

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:14.425
distance should be negotiated--
so in any case this

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:17.780
conservatism,
it seems to me,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.818
however, can be questioned.
 

00:02:19.818 --> 00:02:24.990
I thought that we'd begin then
by turning to page 731,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.598
the left-hand column,
the footnote.

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:31.258
You're beginning to realize,
I'm sure, that I like

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:31.908
footnotes.
 

00:02:31.908 --> 00:02:36.360
Gibbon of course was said to
have lived his life in his

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.348
footnotes.
 

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:41.560
Perhaps I live my life in the
footnotes of other people.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.619
In any case,
in this footnote Gadamer says

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.305
something--
I think it's very rare that we

00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:50.680
can actually just sort of
outright disagree with Gadamer,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.176
but he says something in this
footnote that I believe we can

00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:55.660
actually disagree with.
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.128
Toward the bottom of the
footnote,

00:02:58.128 --> 00:03:00.817
731, left-hand column,
he says, "â€¦

00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:04.594
[J]ust as in conversation,
we understand irony to the

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:08.843
extent to which we are in
agreement on the subject with

00:03:08.843 --> 00:03:10.889
the other person."
 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.000
We understand irony only,
he means, to the extent to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.030
which we are in agreement with
the other person.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.060
If you are expressing an
opinion, in other words,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.550
which differs radically from my
own,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.889
I can't understand,
according to Gadamer,

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.729
whether or not you're being
ironic.

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.550
This seems to me to be just
patently false.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.060
Think about politics.
 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.870
Think about political talk
shows.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.840
Think about political campaigns.
 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.491
When our political opponent is
being ironic about our views we

00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:49.389
understand the irony perfectly
well.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.829
We're used to it,
we have accommodated ourselves

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.318
to it, and of course it's the
same in reverse.

00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:56.960
Our opponent understands our
ironies,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.812
and there is,
it seems to me,

00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:04.330
a perfect kind of symbiosis,
ironically enough,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.639
between political opponents
precisely maybe in the measure

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.568
to which their ironies are
mutually intelligible.

00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:16.084
It probably teaches each of
them a good deal to be able to

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:17.793
accommodate,
to encounter,

00:04:17.793 --> 00:04:20.329
to get used to the ironies of
the other,

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.500
and I think this applies to
conversation in general.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.439
It's very easy to pick up most
forms of irony.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:31.110
We don't have an enormous
difficulty grasping them,

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.620
and it doesn't seem to me that
our capability of grasping irony

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.459
is founded on a necessary,
underlying agreement.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:43.959
That's what he's saying.
 

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:49.589
Now if this is the case,
it seems to me that one has

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:55.771
found a loophole in Gadamer's
conservatism about what the

00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:57.759
reader can do.
 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.937
His premise is that in order to
understand, there has to be a

00:05:02.937 --> 00:05:06.211
basis of agreement;
but if what we've just said

00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.540
about understanding each other's
ironies,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.720
even where there is pretty
wholesale disagreement,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.468
is true, that ought to apply
also to our capacity to read

00:05:17.468 --> 00:05:21.778
work with which we distinctly
disagree,

00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:25.550
with which we feel we can never
come to terms in terms of

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.673
affirming its value,
but which we nevertheless can

00:05:29.673 --> 00:05:30.740
understand.
 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.720
If understanding is not
predicated on agreement,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.319
the possibility of opening up
the canon,

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.629
as we say, insisting that it
doesn't have to be an absolutely

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:47.139
continuous traditional canon,
is available to us once again

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.709
and Gadamer's conservatism on
this issue can be questioned.

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:55.898
Now it's not that Gadamer is
insisting on absolute

00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:57.009
continuity.
 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:57.899
On the contrary.
 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:06.531
You'll probably remember that
he says early in the essay that

00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:15.309
in order to recognize that we
are in the presence of something

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:23.509
that isn't merely within our own
historical horizon,

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.589
we need to be "pulled up
short."

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.485
In other words,
to go back to that example once

00:06:29.485 --> 00:06:31.978
more,
we need to recognize that

00:06:31.978 --> 00:06:36.673
there's something weird about
that word "plastic,"

00:06:36.673 --> 00:06:41.608
and in being pulled up short we
recognize the need also for the

00:06:41.608 --> 00:06:46.303
fundamental act of reading in
Gadamer which is the merger of

00:06:46.303 --> 00:06:50.882
horizons: in other words,
that we are dealing knowingly

00:06:50.882 --> 00:06:54.319
with a horizon not altogether
our own that has to be

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.759
negotiated,
that has to be merged with our

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.838
own for understanding to be
possible.

00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:04.208
In fact, Gadamer even insists
that if we don't have this

00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:07.882
phenomenon of being pulled up
short, our reading is basically

00:07:07.882 --> 00:07:09.170
just solipsistic.
 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.629
We just take it for granted
that what we're reading is

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:16.156
completely within our own
horizon and we don't make any

00:07:16.156 --> 00:07:20.074
effort at all to understand that
which is fundamentally or at

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:22.360
least in some ways different.
 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.139
Gadamer acknowledges this,
even insists on it as I say,

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:32.274
but he doesn't lay stress on it
because the gap that is implied

00:07:32.274 --> 00:07:37.519
in the need to be pulled up
short is not a big one.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:40.927
That is to say,
it's one that we can easily

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:41.819
traverse.
 

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:42.625
Take the example of
"plastic"

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:43.785
again: "Oh,
gee, that's a strange

00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:45.255
word," we say,
so we go to the OED [Oxford

00:07:45.255 --> 00:07:46.952
English Dictionary],
we see it meant something

00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:48.826
different then,
our problem is solved,

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:49.690
and we continue.
 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.209
No big deal, right?
 

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:55.208
But there may be ways of being
pulled up short,

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:59.988
occasions for being pulled up
short, that Gadamer thinks

00:07:59.988 --> 00:08:03.899
exceed the imaginative grasp of
a reader.

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:08.202
As you'll see when we return to
Iser after I've said a few

00:08:08.202 --> 00:08:11.576
things about Hirsch,
this, as you'll see,

00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:16.160
is the fundamental difference
between Gadamer and Iser.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.365
Where for Gadamer,
the gap between reader and

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:22.901
text,
between my horizon and the

00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:26.317
horizon of the text,
is perforce a small one,

00:08:26.317 --> 00:08:31.194
for Iser it needs to be a much
larger one in order for what he

00:08:31.194 --> 00:08:34.311
calls the "act of the
reader,"

00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:38.995
the reading act,
really to swing into high gear,

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:44.187
and we'll see that this has
implications for the obvious

00:08:44.187 --> 00:08:47.870
difference between their two
canons.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.284
All right, but now I want to
say something about the passage

00:08:52.284 --> 00:08:57.000
from which I quoted over against
the passage from Gadamer at the

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.320
end of the Gadamer lecture.
 

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.438
You remember Gadamer said we
have to be open to the otherness

00:09:04.438 --> 00:09:09.727
of the past in order that for us
it may "speak true,"

00:09:09.727 --> 00:09:14.080
but if we simply bracket out
our own feelings,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.626
that can't possibly happen so
that we have to recognize that

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:23.328
in this mutuality of the reading
experience we really are in a

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:24.639
conversation.
 

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:29.990
We're open to being told
something true by someone else.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.581
Hirsch on the other hand says,
"Oh, well,

00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:32.870
no.
 

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.605
The important thing is to know
the exact meaning of that other

00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:40.221
person because that's the only
way to honor the otherness of

00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:41.139
the person.
 

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:46.230
Kant says people ought to be an
end and not a means for us;

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.298
we ought to understand them on
their terms."

00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:52.332
Gadamer's claim,
however, was that if we do

00:09:52.332 --> 00:09:56.594
that, we are in fact suspending
the way in which it might be

00:09:56.594 --> 00:09:58.399
that they speak true.
 

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:02.437
We are honoring instead the
integrity of what they're saying

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:06.340
without thinking about whether
or not it might be true.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.360
So I introduced Hirsch in that
context,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.381
and now I want to go back to
him a little bit and I want to

00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:17.682
work with two passages which I
have sent you all in e-mail-form

00:10:17.682 --> 00:10:21.288
and which I have neglected to
put on the board,

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:24.950
but they're so short I don't
think that will be necessary.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:31.878
The first of the two passages I
want to talk about is Hirsch's

00:10:31.878 --> 00:10:38.692
argument that "meaning is
an affair of consciousness and

00:10:38.692 --> 00:10:43.331
not of words"--
meaning is an affair of

00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:45.990
consciousness and not of words.
 

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.384
In other words,
the text is what makes the

00:10:49.384 --> 00:10:53.772
ascertainment of meaning
possible and available to us,

00:10:53.772 --> 00:10:57.250
but meaning is not in
the text.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:03.014
Meaning is in the intention of
the author, and that is what we

00:11:03.014 --> 00:11:07.548
need to arrive at as we work
through the text.

00:11:07.548 --> 00:11:10.899
Meaning is an affair of
consciousness and not of words.

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:11.879
Now think about this.
 

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:16.533
What it means is that in
understanding a text,

00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:21.288
we are attempting to grasp it
in paraphrase.

00:11:21.288 --> 00:11:24.745
We are, in other words,
attempting to grasp it in a

00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:27.720
sentence that might read
something like,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.548
"What the author means to
say is-- "

00:11:31.548 --> 00:11:32.230
Right?
 

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:37.082
So that it's not what the text
means--which might be anything,

00:11:37.082 --> 00:11:41.379
according to Hirsch,
if you just appeal to the text;

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:45.509
it's what the author means to
say.

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:46.340
Okay.
 

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.830
So what's implied here?
 

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.342
On the one hand,
you could say this is just

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:51.899
absolute total nonsense.
 

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:55.230
We use a text to find meaning
in something that we don't have

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.230
available to us.
 

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.128
Why don't we just find meaning
in the text, which is available

00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:00.639
to us?
 

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:02.580
That would make more sense.
 

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.370
It's up to us to construe the
text.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:10.005
We can't possibly know what the
author meant except on the basis

00:12:10.005 --> 00:12:13.759
of our determination of the
meaning of the text,

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:17.452
so why not just focus our
attention to meaning on the

00:12:17.452 --> 00:12:17.950
text?
 

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.250
Hirsch was a student of Wimsatt.
 

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.701
Hirsch was engaged in lifelong
disagreement with Gadamer but he

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:26.740
was a student of Wimsatt,
the author of "The

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.480
Intentional Fallacy."
 

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.567
Obviously, Hirsch was a
rebellious student

00:12:30.567 --> 00:12:31.788
&gt;
 

00:12:31.788 --> 00:12:34.730
and insisted that,
far from wanting to take

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.859
Wimsatt's position,
appealing to intention was the

00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:41.298
most important thing you can do,
the only thing you can do which

00:12:41.298 --> 00:12:43.660
establishes--
according to the title of his

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.009
first important book on
hermeneutics--

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:48.590
"validity in
interpretation."

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.519
All right.
 

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:57.820
It's very difficult intuitively
to assent to Hirsch's position,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.590
and I'll just tell you by the
way that I don't,

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:05.480
I can't, but I will say in
passing in defense of Hirsch

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.740
that if we reflect on the
matter,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.178
we realize that in common sense
terms,

00:13:12.178 --> 00:13:16.440
appealing to an author's
intention is precisely what we

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.570
do for practical reasons.
 

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.029
Let me give you an example.
 

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:22.090
You're all students.
 

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.879
You are sitting in classrooms
that in many cases oblige you to

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:27.899
take exams.
 

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:31.801
Your instructor tells you when
you write your exam,

00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:36.014
"Don't just parrot the
words of the authors you're

00:13:36.014 --> 00:13:37.029
studying.
 

00:13:37.029 --> 00:13:42.009
I want to know that you
understand those authors."

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:43.259
Think about it.
 

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:47.801
You prove to your teacher that
you understand the authors by

00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:52.190
being able to put their meaning
in other words--

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.076
in other words,
to say the author is intending

00:13:55.076 --> 00:13:58.110
to say something,
not just that the text says

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.509
something and this is what it
says,

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:04.440
with your exam then being one
long screed of quotation.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.932
Ironically, the instructor
doesn't really want just

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.460
quotation on an exam.
 

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.813
He wants explanation,
and the form of explanation is

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:16.668
paraphrase.
 

00:14:16.668 --> 00:14:21.668
You can't have paraphrase
unless you can identify a

00:14:21.668 --> 00:14:29.004
meaning which is interpersonal,
a meaning which can be shared

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:37.418
among a group that understands
it and can be expressed in other

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:38.639
words.
 

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.678
That's the key.
 

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:44.719
If you can put it in other
words, those other words take

00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:48.110
the form of an appeal to
intention.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.058
All right.
 

00:14:50.058 --> 00:14:54.830
That's an important argument in
Hirsch's favor.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.570
We realize that practically
speaking,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.855
the necessity of appealing to
paraphrase in order to guarantee

00:15:02.855 --> 00:15:08.053
mutual understanding certainly
does seem to be something like

00:15:08.053 --> 00:15:12.299
agreeing or admitting that
meaning is an affair of

00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:15.855
consciousness,
not of words--my consciousness,

00:15:15.855 --> 00:15:18.951
the author's consciousness,
the consciousness that we can

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:19.509
all share.
 

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:24.222
That's where we find meaning,
and meaning takes the form of

00:15:24.222 --> 00:15:28.528
that kind of paraphrase that
everyone can agree on.

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:37.308
So much then to the advantage
or benefit of Hirsch.

00:15:37.308 --> 00:15:39.000
There are lots of things to be
said against it,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.308
on the other hand,
which I don't want to pause

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:46.427
over now because I think a
course of lectures on literary

00:15:46.427 --> 00:15:50.692
theory will inevitably show the
ways in which paraphrase is

00:15:50.692 --> 00:15:54.808
inadequate to the task of
rigorous interpretation.

00:15:54.808 --> 00:15:57.186
Cleanth Brooks,
a New Critic,

00:15:57.186 --> 00:16:01.174
writes a famous essay called
"The Heresy of

00:16:01.174 --> 00:16:05.163
Paraphrase,"
insisting that proper literary

00:16:05.163 --> 00:16:10.825
interpretation is a wooden,
mechanical, inflexible exercise

00:16:10.825 --> 00:16:16.106
if it reduces the incredible
complexity of a textual surface

00:16:16.106 --> 00:16:17.629
to paraphrase.
 

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:22.321
So it's a complex issue,
and I should leave it having

00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:26.110
said this much,
at least for the moment.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:30.211
Now one other thing that Hirsch
says, the other thing that I

00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:32.714
quoted, is in effect--I'll
paraphrase

00:16:32.714 --> 00:16:34.870
now--&gt;
 

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.698
that what Gadamer omits to
realize is that there is a

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:42.676
difference between the
meaning of a text and the

00:16:42.676 --> 00:16:45.178
significance of a text.
 

00:16:45.178 --> 00:16:48.149
That is Hirsch's other key
position,

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:52.346
and we can understand it by
saying something like this:

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:57.320
the meaning of a text is what
the author intended it to mean--

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.865
that is to say,
what we can establish with a

00:16:59.865 --> 00:17:01.168
reliable paraphrase.
 

00:17:01.168 --> 00:17:07.172
The significance of the text,
which Hirsch does not deny

00:17:07.172 --> 00:17:09.873
interest to,
is the meaning for

00:17:09.873 --> 00:17:13.526
us--that is to say,
what we take to be important

00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:16.848
about this meaning:
the way in which,

00:17:16.848 --> 00:17:19.074
for example,
we can translate it into our

00:17:19.074 --> 00:17:23.605
own terms historically,
we can adapt it to a cause or

00:17:23.605 --> 00:17:28.221
an intellectual position--
the ways, in other words,

00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:31.915
in which we can take the
meaning of a text and make it

00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:33.450
significant for us.
 

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.895
The difference between meaning
and significance then is

00:17:36.895 --> 00:17:40.788
something that Hirsch takes very
seriously and he insists--

00:17:40.788 --> 00:17:42.578
and here is,
of course, where it becomes

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:44.905
controversial--
he insists that it's possible

00:17:44.905 --> 00:17:48.160
to tell the difference between
meaning and significance if,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.008
good historicists that you are,
you can pin down accurately and

00:17:53.008 --> 00:17:55.980
incontestably the author's
meaning,

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.724
appealing to all the
philological tricks that you

00:17:59.724 --> 00:18:02.211
have,
throwing out irrelevancies and

00:18:02.211 --> 00:18:05.440
insisting that you finally have
the meaning right--

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.528
of course, how many times has
that happened?

00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:11.640
which is obviously one point of
disagreement with Hirsch.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.780
Then, once you've done that,
once you have secured the

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.632
integrity and accuracy of the
meaning, Hirsch says,

00:18:21.632 --> 00:18:23.670
"Okay, fine.
 

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.259
Now you can do anything you
like with the text.

00:18:26.259 --> 00:18:30.328
You can adapt it for any sort
of possible purpose,

00:18:30.328 --> 00:18:33.898
but the crucial thing is to
keep the distinction between

00:18:33.898 --> 00:18:36.430
meaning and significance
clear."

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:42.513
Obviously, Gadamer refuses to
argue that we can distinguish in

00:18:42.513 --> 00:18:44.509
that way reliably.
 

00:18:44.509 --> 00:18:49.240
We don't know--because it's a
question of merging horizons,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.500
my horizon and the horizon of
the text--

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.941
we don't know with any
guarantee where meaning leaves

00:18:55.941 --> 00:19:00.916
off and significance begins,
so that the splitting apart of

00:19:00.916 --> 00:19:05.726
the two terms is something that
simply can't be accomplished by

00:19:05.726 --> 00:19:09.759
the way in which we enter the
hermeneutic circle.

00:19:09.759 --> 00:19:14.584
That's Gadamer's position,
and it is the position of

00:19:14.584 --> 00:19:19.881
anyone who opposes that of
Hirsch, although what he means

00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:23.568
by the distinction is clear
enough.

00:19:23.568 --> 00:19:25.247
"Yes, yes,"
you say, "I see exactly

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:26.000
what he means."
 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.657
Nevertheless,
to secure the distinction in

00:19:29.657 --> 00:19:33.048
actual practice,
to say, "Okay.

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:35.586
This is the meaning and now
this is how I'm going to make it

00:19:35.586 --> 00:19:39.019
significant"--
well, it seems unlikely indeed

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:43.490
that this is something anyone
could ever accomplish.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.009
All right.
 

00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:51.174
Finally, to turn to Wolfgang
Iser: Iser is concerned with

00:19:51.174 --> 00:19:55.470
what he calls the act of the
reader--

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.348
Akt des Lesers is the
title of one of his books--

00:19:59.348 --> 00:20:04.915
and in so doing he establishes
himself as a person very much in

00:20:04.915 --> 00:20:10.303
the tradition of phenomenology
deriving from Husserl and more

00:20:10.303 --> 00:20:12.721
directly,
in Iser's case,

00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:17.058
from an analyst of the way in
which the reader moves from

00:20:17.058 --> 00:20:20.700
sentence to sentence in
negotiating a text,

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.314
a Polish intellectual named
Roman Ingarden who is quoted

00:20:25.314 --> 00:20:28.670
frequently in the essay that you
have.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.720
Those are the primary
influences on Iser,

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.532
but he himself has been
tremendously influential in

00:20:35.532 --> 00:20:36.220
turn.
 

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:41.804
Iser's interest in the reader's
experience is part of a school

00:20:41.804 --> 00:20:47.021
of thought that he helped to
found that grew up around the

00:20:47.021 --> 00:20:52.240
University of Konstanz in the
sixties and seventies,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.737
and which resulted in a series
of seminars on what was called

00:20:56.737 --> 00:21:00.861
"reception history"
or alternatively "the

00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:03.410
aesthetics of reception."
 

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.096
Iser's colleague was Hans
Robert Jauss,

00:21:06.096 --> 00:21:09.348
whom we will be reading later
in the course.

00:21:09.348 --> 00:21:13.758
The influence of the so-called
Konstanz School spread to the

00:21:13.758 --> 00:21:17.420
United States and had many
ramifications here,

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.945
particularly and crucially in
the early work of another critic

00:21:21.945 --> 00:21:26.250
we'll be turning to later in the
semester, Stanley Fish.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:31.328
So reception history has been a
kind of partly theoretical,

00:21:31.328 --> 00:21:35.104
partly scholarly field,
one that's really still

00:21:35.104 --> 00:21:39.699
flourishing and has been ever
since the early work in the

00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:44.130
great Konstanz seminars of Iser,
Jauss and others.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:47.498
Iser, later in his career--he
died just a couple of years

00:21:47.498 --> 00:21:49.771
ago--
taught annually at the

00:21:49.771 --> 00:21:54.487
University of California,
Irvine, and by that time he was

00:21:54.487 --> 00:21:58.950
very much engaged in a new
aspect of his project,

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.348
which he called the
anthropology of fiction--

00:22:02.348 --> 00:22:04.828
that is to say,
"Why do we have fiction?

00:22:04.828 --> 00:22:07.548
Why do we tell stories to each
other?"

00:22:07.548 --> 00:22:12.674
All of Iser's work is grounded
in the notion of literature as

00:22:12.674 --> 00:22:13.528
fiction.
 

00:22:13.528 --> 00:22:16.769
He's almost exclusively a
scholar of the novel--

00:22:16.769 --> 00:22:19.327
and by the way,
one of the first obvious

00:22:19.327 --> 00:22:23.132
differences you can notice
between Iser and Gadamer is that

00:22:23.132 --> 00:22:26.346
whereas Gadamer is an
intellectual historian whose

00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:29.430
canonical texts are works of
philosophy,

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:34.390
works of social thought as well
as great works of literature,

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.200
for Iser it's a completely
different canon.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.825
He is exclusively concerned
with fiction and how we read

00:22:40.825 --> 00:22:43.342
fiction,
how we come to understand

00:22:43.342 --> 00:22:47.141
fiction, and how we determine
the meaning of a work of

00:22:47.141 --> 00:22:47.930
fiction.
 

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.564
As I say, in the last phase of
his career when he started

00:22:51.564 --> 00:22:54.548
thinking about the anthropology
of fiction,

00:22:54.548 --> 00:22:57.769
he raised the even more
fundamental question--

00:22:57.769 --> 00:23:00.748
I think a very important one,
though not necessarily to be

00:23:00.748 --> 00:23:04.574
aimed exclusively at fiction--
the anthropological question of

00:23:04.574 --> 00:23:08.605
why we have fiction at all,
why it has been a persisting

00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:12.636
trans-historical phenomenon of
human culture that we tell

00:23:12.636 --> 00:23:16.957
stories to each other,
that we make things up when

00:23:16.957 --> 00:23:21.400
after all we could be spending
all of our time,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.078
well, just talking about things
that actually are around us.

00:23:25.078 --> 00:23:28.104
In other words,
how is it that we feel the need

00:23:28.104 --> 00:23:29.420
to make things up?
 

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.318
All right.
 

00:23:30.318 --> 00:23:35.598
Now as you read Iser you'll see
immediately that in tone,

00:23:35.598 --> 00:23:38.750
in his sense of what's
important, and in his

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:43.000
understanding of the way in
which we negotiate the world of

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.470
texts he much more closely
resembles Gadamer than Hirsch.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.288
We can say this in two
different ways.

00:23:50.288 --> 00:23:56.047
We can say that Iser's position
is a reconstruction of what

00:23:56.047 --> 00:24:01.108
Gadamer has, essentially,
to say about the merger of

00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:02.400
horizons.
 

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.335
For example,
on page 1002,

00:24:04.335 --> 00:24:08.670
the bottom of the left-hand
column over to the right-hand

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.778
column,
he says, "The convergence

00:24:12.778 --> 00:24:17.684
of text and reader"--
Gadamer's way of putting that

00:24:17.684 --> 00:24:20.930
would be the merger of the
reader's horizon,

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:28.880
my horizon, with the horizon
within which the text appears--

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.630
"brings the literary work
into existence."

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.539
This is implied in Gadamer as
well.

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:38.308
It's not your horizon;
it's not my horizon;

00:24:38.308 --> 00:24:41.989
it's that effective history
which takes place when our

00:24:41.989 --> 00:24:43.170
horizons merge.
 

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:47.150
That is the locus of meaning
for Gadamer.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.039
By the same token,
what Iser is saying is that the

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:55.089
space of meaning is
"virtual"--this is the

00:24:55.089 --> 00:24:56.440
word he uses.
 

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.509
It's neither in the text nor in
the reader but the result of the

00:25:01.509 --> 00:25:06.500
negotiation back and forth
between the text and the reader,

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.195
he says, that sort of brings
the literary work into existence

00:25:10.195 --> 00:25:11.490
in a virtual space.
 

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.119
"â€¦
[A]nd this convergence can

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:18.607
never be precisely pinpointed,
but must always remain virtual,

00:25:18.607 --> 00:25:22.797
as is not to be identified
either with the reality of the

00:25:22.797 --> 00:25:27.509
text or with the individual
disposition of the reader."

00:25:27.509 --> 00:25:29.548
So you see this is Gadamerian.
 

00:25:29.548 --> 00:25:32.594
This is the result,
this is the fruit,

00:25:32.594 --> 00:25:37.612
of the hermeneutic engagement
between horizons that results in

00:25:37.612 --> 00:25:38.598
meaning.
 

00:25:38.598 --> 00:25:43.128
It's put in a different way by
Iser, but it is in a large

00:25:43.128 --> 00:25:44.990
degree the same idea.
 

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.720
He also plainly shares with
Gadamer the assumption,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.978
the supposition,
that the construal of meaning

00:25:53.978 --> 00:25:57.288
cannot be altogether objective.
 

00:25:57.288 --> 00:26:01.432
In other words,
Iser is no more an historicist

00:26:01.432 --> 00:26:06.864
than Gadamer is but insists
rather on the mutual exchange of

00:26:06.864 --> 00:26:11.558
prejudice between the two
horizons in question.

00:26:11.558 --> 00:26:17.548
So he argues on page 1005,
the right-hand column:

00:26:17.548 --> 00:26:20.829
One text [this halfway down the
column]

00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:26.009
is potentially capable of
several different realizations,

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:30.750
and no reading can ever exhaust
the full potentia,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:36.460
for each individual reader will
fill in the gaps in his own way.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.904
This of course brings us to the
issue of "gaps"

00:26:40.904 --> 00:26:45.351
and the role that they play in
the act of reading as Iser

00:26:45.351 --> 00:26:46.859
understands it.
 

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:49.690
It's an interesting term.
 

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:53.195
I don't actually know whether
Iser, to be Hirschian,

00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:55.740
means
&gt;

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.634
what I'm about to say about
gaps, but plainly a

00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:00.335
"gap"
is an abyss,

00:27:00.335 --> 00:27:02.788
it's a distance between two
points;

00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:06.980
but what's really interesting
is that we think of spark

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.240
plugs--we think of gapping a
spark plug.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.470
I don't know if you know how a
spark plug works,

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:18.182
but for the electrical current
to fly into operation in a spark

00:27:18.182 --> 00:27:21.476
plug,
the two points of contact have

00:27:21.476 --> 00:27:22.670
to be gapped.
 

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.369
They have to be forced apart to
a certain degree.

00:27:26.369 --> 00:27:28.009
Too much, there's no spark.
 

00:27:28.009 --> 00:27:31.289
Too little, you short out.
 

00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:31.829
Right?
 

00:27:31.829 --> 00:27:32.890
There's no spark.
 

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:37.172
So you have to gap a spark
plug, and it seems to me that

00:27:37.172 --> 00:27:40.519
the "ah-ha"
effect of reading,

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:44.997
the movement back and forth
across the gap between the

00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:49.181
reader and the text,
can be understood in terms of a

00:27:49.181 --> 00:27:51.007
spark,
right, as though the

00:27:51.007 --> 00:27:54.250
relationship between the reader
and the text were the

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.680
relationship between the two
points of a spark plug.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.560
Whether Gadamer means that when
he speaks of gap or whether he

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.615
simply means an abyss or a
distance to be crossed

00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:06.269
&gt;
 

00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:10.019
I couldn't say.
 

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:13.894
Much like the opportunities in
the word "plastic,"

00:28:13.894 --> 00:28:17.702
I think it's useful to suggest
that this sense of gapping a

00:28:17.702 --> 00:28:21.249
spark plug may have some
relevance to our understanding

00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:24.269
of what goes on in this reading
process.

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:31.400
Now how then does he differ
from Gadamer?

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.698
One way that is I think not
terribly important but I think

00:28:34.698 --> 00:28:38.055
is interesting in view of what
we've just been saying about

00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:41.412
Hirsch and another way that's
absolutely crucial that we've

00:28:41.412 --> 00:28:44.480
implied already and to which we
need to return.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.550
The way that's perhaps not
terribly important at least for

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.631
present purposes--
although this is a distinction

00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:54.713
that's going to be coming up
again and again later in the

00:28:54.713 --> 00:28:58.184
semester--
is the way in which he actually

00:28:58.184 --> 00:29:08.971
seems to distinguish--
this is page 1006 in the upper

00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:16.586
left-hand column--
between "reading"

00:29:16.586 --> 00:29:19.048
and "interpretation."
 

00:29:19.048 --> 00:29:21.278
This is at the very top of the
left-hand column.

00:29:21.278 --> 00:29:24.096
He says: "â€¦
[T]he text refers back directly

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:27.621
to our own preconceptions--
"--Gadamer would call

00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:32.201
those "prejudices"--
"which are revealed by the

00:29:32.201 --> 00:29:36.353
act of interpretation that is a
basic element of the reading

00:29:36.353 --> 00:29:37.548
process."
 

00:29:37.548 --> 00:29:41.406
So there's a wedge there
between the concept of reading

00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:43.980
and the concept of
interpretation.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.787
I would suggest that it's not
unlike the wedge that Hirsch

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:53.425
drives between the concept of
meaning and the concept of

00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:54.858
significance.
 

00:29:54.858 --> 00:29:57.410
In other words,
meaning is construal.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.759
Significance is the application
of that construal to something.

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:05.756
I think that the distinction
Iser is making between reading

00:30:05.756 --> 00:30:09.890
and interpretation can be
understood in much the same way.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:13.150
Iser doesn't make much of the
distinction.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.906
In other words,
it's not an important part of

00:30:15.906 --> 00:30:18.483
his argument,
which is why I say that the

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:22.105
difference with Gadamer--
who never makes the distinction

00:30:22.105 --> 00:30:24.618
between reading and
interpretation--

00:30:24.618 --> 00:30:28.452
in this matter is slight,
but the other difference is

00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:32.155
very important,
and that is--to return to this

00:30:32.155 --> 00:30:36.167
point--
that Iser stresses innovation

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:42.343
as the principle of value
governing the choice and the

00:30:42.343 --> 00:30:46.769
interpretive strategies of
reading.

00:30:46.769 --> 00:30:51.858
Innovation is what Iser's canon
is looking for.

00:30:51.858 --> 00:30:55.103
That's what makes it so
different from Gadamer's

00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:58.140
conservative continuous
traditional canon.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.805
Iser's understanding of gapping
the spark plug is a much more

00:31:03.805 --> 00:31:08.336
bold affirmative of the
imaginative powers of the

00:31:08.336 --> 00:31:12.335
reader,
a much more bold process than

00:31:12.335 --> 00:31:17.868
the hesitant conservative
process suggested by Gadamer.

00:31:17.868 --> 00:31:23.049
Now in order to illustrate the
way in which what Iser calls

00:31:23.049 --> 00:31:28.498
virtual work gets done in this
regard, let me just run through

00:31:28.498 --> 00:31:30.910
a few passages quickly.
 

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.643
If Gadamer says,
in a way, that he doesn't

00:31:33.643 --> 00:31:37.711
really stress in the long run
that in order to know that there

00:31:37.711 --> 00:31:41.711
is actually a difference between
the reader's horizon and the

00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:45.846
horizon of the text you need to
be "pulled up short,"

00:31:45.846 --> 00:31:48.578
something needs to surprise
you--

00:31:48.578 --> 00:31:52.923
well, Iser throws his whole
emphasis on this element of

00:31:52.923 --> 00:31:53.808
surprise.
 

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:56.609
If it doesn't surprise,
it isn't worth it;

00:31:56.609 --> 00:31:57.910
it doesn't have value.
 

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:03.558
And we'll talk in more detail
about the ways in which it

00:32:03.558 --> 00:32:06.950
doesn't have value in a minute.
 

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:10.778
If the element of surprise is
to become absolutely central and

00:32:10.778 --> 00:32:13.979
paramount in the reading
process, the gap has to get

00:32:13.979 --> 00:32:14.670
bigger.
 

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:15.808
&gt;
 

00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:19.900
It has to be a bigger distance,
a broader abyss,

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:25.208
and that's what Iser is working
with in the passages I'm about

00:32:25.208 --> 00:32:26.338
to quote.
 

00:32:26.338 --> 00:32:28.980
As I say, I'm going to quote
three, more or less rapid-fire.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:33.586
The first is on page 1003,
the upper left-hand column:

00:32:33.586 --> 00:32:37.500
"In this process of
creativity"--

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.612
that is to say,
the way in which a text induces

00:32:42.612 --> 00:32:47.170
the feeling of surprise in the
reader--

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:52.009
"the text may either not
go far enough,

00:32:52.009 --> 00:32:56.002
or may go too farâ€¦"
Now I admit in this particular

00:32:56.002 --> 00:32:59.068
passage you get a hint of
Gadamer's element of

00:32:59.068 --> 00:33:00.160
conservatism.
 

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.048
The text may go too far.
 

00:33:02.048 --> 00:33:04.698
In other words,
it may make demands on us that

00:33:04.698 --> 00:33:05.640
are too great.
 

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.835
For example,
we're reading Finnegan's

00:33:06.835 --> 00:33:07.049
Wake.
 

00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:08.410
We haven't got a clue.
 

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.670
The text has gone too far.
 

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:13.068
We can't get from sentence to
sentence,

00:33:13.068 --> 00:33:16.180
and even within the sentence we
have no idea what the words

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.163
mean,
so we're lost at sea unless,

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:21.855
of course,
we really rise to meet the

00:33:21.855 --> 00:33:23.660
challenge;
but typically or

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.901
characteristically in Iser's
terms the text has gone too far:

00:33:27.901 --> 00:33:30.798
"â€¦
[S]o we may say"--

00:33:30.798 --> 00:33:35.921
he elaborates here'--"that
boredom and overstrain form the

00:33:35.921 --> 00:33:40.630
boundaries beyond which the
reader will leave the field of

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:41.868
play."
 

00:33:41.868 --> 00:33:44.349
In other words,
if there are no surprises,

00:33:44.349 --> 00:33:45.500
it's just a yawn.
 

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.308
Why bother to read at all?
 

00:33:47.308 --> 00:33:52.078
If the surprises are too great,
then they induce overstrain and

00:33:52.078 --> 00:33:56.078
we throw away the book in
frustration and despair.

00:33:56.078 --> 00:34:01.961
So the distance of the gap
needs to be between the outer

00:34:01.961 --> 00:34:07.630
limits of boredom and overstrain
according to Iser.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:12.230
Continuing to page 1004,
the upper right-hand column:

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.679
"â€¦
[E]xpectations"--

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:20.463
this word is what Iser thinks
governs the sort of dialectic

00:34:20.463 --> 00:34:24.010
that the reading process is
playing with.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.105
Reading consists,
according to Iser,

00:34:27.105 --> 00:34:30.199
in the violation of
expectations.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:34.637
For the violation to work the
expectations have to be there.So

00:34:34.637 --> 00:34:37.659
that's the dialectic;
that's what's negotiated.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.760
There has to be a sense,
moving from sentence to

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.190
sentence, that something is
likely to happen next.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:46.920
If that underlying sense isn't
there,

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.239
then whatever happens is simply
met with frustration,

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:53.561
but if we have the expectation
that something's going to happen

00:34:53.561 --> 00:34:55.661
next,
and then something different

00:34:55.661 --> 00:34:59.579
happens,
or if the suspense of wondering

00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:06.329
what will happen next is in play
so that anything can happen--

00:35:06.329 --> 00:35:10.199
but the experience of suspense
has been gone through,

00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:12.989
then in those cases that's all
to the good;

00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:15.768
that's a good part of the
reading process.

00:35:15.768 --> 00:35:17.695
"â€¦
[E]xpectations,"

00:35:17.695 --> 00:35:20.036
says Iser,
"are scarcely ever

00:35:20.036 --> 00:35:23.010
fulfilled in a truly literary
text."

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:28.572
You see, that's where the
evaluative principle that

00:35:28.572 --> 00:35:34.469
completely revolutionizes
Gadamer's canon comes in.

00:35:34.469 --> 00:35:37.949
In other words,
innovation, the principle of

00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:40.387
change,
the principle of violated

00:35:40.387 --> 00:35:44.610
expectation,
is what imposes or establishes

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:49.177
value in the literary text--
not continuity,

00:35:49.177 --> 00:35:54.380
not a sense that across the
abyss truth is being spoken to

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.972
us,
but rather the sense that

00:35:56.972 --> 00:36:01.349
across the abyss we are being
constructively surprised.

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:02.070
Right?
 

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:07.289
That's what has changed between
these two positions.

00:36:07.289 --> 00:36:11.228
"We implicitly demand of
expository texts,"

00:36:11.228 --> 00:36:14.192
he goes on to say--
and he may be alluding to

00:36:14.192 --> 00:36:17.376
Gadamer here because after all
Gadamer is talking primarily

00:36:17.376 --> 00:36:19.893
about expository texst,
works of philosophy,

00:36:19.893 --> 00:36:22.324
works of social thought,
which of course aren't trying

00:36:22.324 --> 00:36:23.557
to surprise
&gt;

00:36:23.557 --> 00:36:24.119
or trick us.
 

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:27.822
They're trying to lay out an
argument which is consistent and

00:36:27.822 --> 00:36:30.539
continuous and keep surprise to
a minimum.

00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:33.097
It's difficult,
philosophy and social thought,

00:36:33.097 --> 00:36:36.510
but it's not difficult because
of the element of surprise.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.108
It's the vocabulary,
it's the complexity of the

00:36:39.108 --> 00:36:41.650
thought, and so on that makes it
difficult.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.630
Iser acknowledges this.
 

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.255
He says, "â€¦
[W]e implicitly demand of

00:36:48.255 --> 00:36:52.108
expository textsâ€¦
[that there be no surprise]

00:36:52.108 --> 00:36:56.489
as we refer to the objects they
are meant to present--

00:36:56.489 --> 00:36:58.900
[but it's]
a defect in a literary

00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.880
text."
 

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:05.139
That's the difference for Iser
between nonfiction and fiction.

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:10.530
With nonfiction,
we don't want to be surprised.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.929
It poses other kinds of
difficulty, let's say;

00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:17.250
but in the case of fiction,
in order to be engaged,

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.440
in order to enter the
hermeneutic circle properly,

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.179
we need the element of
surprise, as I say,

00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:27.789
as a way of distinguishing
between fiction and nonfiction.

00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:32.869
Let's turn to page 1010,
the lower right-hand column.

00:37:32.869 --> 00:37:35.460
The word
"defamiliarization"

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.940
we will encounter soon when we
take up the Russian Formalists.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:44.407
"Defamiliarization"
means precisely pulling you up

00:37:44.407 --> 00:37:49.753
short or taking you by surprise,
making you feel that what you

00:37:49.753 --> 00:37:55.231
thought was going to be the case
or what you thought was the

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:59.690
state of affairs is not the
state of affairs.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:04.081
The poet Wallace Stevens puts
it beautifully when he says that

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:07.969
poetry should make the visible a
little hard to see;

00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:13.376
in other words it should be a
defamiliarizing of that which

00:38:13.376 --> 00:38:15.800
has become too familiar.
 

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.619
That's an aspect of the reading
process,

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:21.882
and so Iser says:
"This defamiliarization of

00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:25.755
what the reader thought he
recognized is bound to create a

00:38:25.755 --> 00:38:29.697
tension that will intensify his
expectations as well as his

00:38:29.697 --> 00:38:32.619
distrust of those
expectations."

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:35.552
In other words,
the tension itself of

00:38:35.552 --> 00:38:39.626
simultaneously having
expectations and feeling that

00:38:39.626 --> 00:38:43.780
they should be violated,
that probably they will be

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.077
violated,
being on the alert for how

00:38:46.077 --> 00:38:49.815
they're going to be violated--
this is a kind of tension,

00:38:49.815 --> 00:38:53.630
a constructive tension which
constitutes for Iser the

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:56.489
psychological excitement of
reading.

00:38:56.489 --> 00:38:57.559
All right.
 

00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:00.827
Having said all of this,
obviously what Iser means to

00:39:00.827 --> 00:39:03.530
say is that the reader should
work hard,

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:09.018
that the virtual work done by
the reader to constitute,

00:39:09.018 --> 00:39:14.143
to bring into existence,
a virtual meaning should be

00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:17.284
hard work,
and there's not much work to do

00:39:17.284 --> 00:39:19.829
if two things are the case:
first of all,

00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:21.860
if the text just seems real.
 

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:28.320
In other words,
if there's no spin on reality,

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.739
if there's no sense of this
being a fictive world,

00:39:33.739 --> 00:39:38.849
if it just seems to be about
the everyday,

00:39:38.849 --> 00:39:42.101
about life as we live it,
the life that we find ourselves

00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:44.590
in--
then according to Iser,

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:49.059
at least, there's no violation
of expectations.

00:39:49.059 --> 00:39:50.710
The gap isn't big enough.
 

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.960
This is, of course, disputable.
 

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.460
There is a kind of a vogue
recurrently in the history of

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.617
fiction for a kind of miraculous
sense that this is just exactly

00:40:02.617 --> 00:40:04.500
the way things are.
 

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.835
People enjoy that in ways that
Iser may not be fully

00:40:07.835 --> 00:40:11.784
acknowledging in this argument,
but there's no question that it

00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:14.400
doesn't involve the violation of
expectations.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.469
There's not much gap at all.
 

00:40:16.469 --> 00:40:20.827
It's another kind of pleasure
that Iser is perhaps not taking

00:40:20.827 --> 00:40:24.969
into account that we take in
that which seems to be simply

00:40:24.969 --> 00:40:27.730
incontestably real as we read
it,

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:30.679
and Iser leaves that out of
account.

00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:34.597
On the other hand,
he says that there is no use

00:40:34.597 --> 00:40:36.858
either,
no value either,

00:40:36.858 --> 00:40:42.228
in that form of engagement with
a text in which an illusion is

00:40:42.228 --> 00:40:44.429
perpetually sustained.
 

00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:46.739
In other words,
an illusion is created;

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:49.760
a never-never land is created.
 

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.750
We know it's an illusion,
but we get to live in it so

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:58.123
comfortably with so little
alteration of the nature of the

00:40:58.123 --> 00:41:03.420
illusion or of the way in which
we negotiate the illusory world,

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.550
that it becomes kind of
womb-like and cozy.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:10.242
Here of course,
Iser is referring to what he

00:41:10.242 --> 00:41:13.161
calls "culinary
fiction,"

00:41:13.161 --> 00:41:16.510
the sub-genres of literature
like,

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.679
well, nurse novels,
bodice-rippers,

00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:23.110
certain kinds of detective
fiction--

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.782
although a lot of detective
fiction is much better than that

00:41:26.782 --> 00:41:29.460
description would imply:
in other words,

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.909
novels in which undoubtedly
it's an illusory world.

00:41:32.909 --> 00:41:36.195
Things just don't happen the
way they happen in nurse novels

00:41:36.195 --> 00:41:39.369
and bodice-rippers--in which
somehow or another the pauper

00:41:39.369 --> 00:41:40.650
marries the prince.
 

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:44.300
This doesn't happen,
but at the same time it's a

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.186
world of illusion in which the
reader lives all too

00:41:48.186 --> 00:41:49.429
comfortably.
 

00:41:49.429 --> 00:41:50.070
Right?
 

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:54.614
So these are forms of the
experience of reading fiction of

00:41:54.614 --> 00:41:59.400
which Iser disapproves because
there's no work being done.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.514
The virtual work of the reader
does not involve surprise,

00:42:04.514 --> 00:42:08.989
does not involve the violation
of expectations.

00:42:08.989 --> 00:42:13.518
The relationship between text
and reader must be a

00:42:13.518 --> 00:42:16.199
collaboration,
Iser argues.

00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:19.139
The poly-semantic nature of the
text--

00:42:19.139 --> 00:42:22.536
that is to say,
the fact that the text sort of

00:42:22.536 --> 00:42:26.610
throws up all sorts of
possibilities of meaning if it's

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:29.630
a good text--
&gt;

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:34.489
and the illusion making of the
reader are opposed factors.

00:42:34.489 --> 00:42:36.134
In other words,
there is something in the

00:42:36.134 --> 00:42:38.436
reader that wants to settle
comfortably into the world of

00:42:38.436 --> 00:42:40.416
the nurse novel,
the bodice-ripper,

00:42:40.416 --> 00:42:43.904
the formulaic detective novel--
that wants just to sort of

00:42:43.904 --> 00:42:45.929
exist comfortably in those
worlds;

00:42:45.929 --> 00:42:50.331
but a good text is perpetually
bringing the reader up short and

00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:54.380
preventing that comfort zone
from establishing itself,

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:59.215
so that the tension between the
tendency on our part to sustain

00:42:59.215 --> 00:43:04.052
an illusion and the way in which
the text keeps undermining the

00:43:04.052 --> 00:43:08.965
illusion is again that aspect of
the psychological excitement of

00:43:08.965 --> 00:43:12.710
reading that Iser wants to
concentrate on.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:19.659
Now a word about Tony the
Tow Truck in this regard.

00:43:19.659 --> 00:43:22.030
I brought the text with me.
 

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.500
You can look at it now or at
your leisure.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:30.545
I wanted to call attention to a
few places in the text in which

00:43:30.545 --> 00:43:35.346
it is a question of expectation
and of the way in which this

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:37.949
expectation can be violated.
 

00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:41.164
Now it's only fair to say that
if we're going to read Tony

00:43:41.164 --> 00:43:44.166
seriously in this way we
have to put ourselves in the

00:43:44.166 --> 00:43:46.503
shoes of a toddler;
that is to say,

00:43:46.503 --> 00:43:51.070
as readers or auditors we have
to think of ourselves and of the

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:55.414
psychological excitement of
experiencing the text as that of

00:43:55.414 --> 00:43:56.518
a toddler.
 

00:43:56.518 --> 00:44:00.179
It's not so very difficult to
do.

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:03.329
For example:
I am Tony the Tow Truck.

00:44:03.329 --> 00:44:05.019
I live in a little yellow
garage.

00:44:05.019 --> 00:44:06.179
I help cars that are stuck.
 

00:44:06.179 --> 00:44:07.449
I tow them to my garage.
 

00:44:07.449 --> 00:44:08.510
I like my job.
 

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.030
One day I am stuck.
 

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.989
Who will help Tony the tow
truck?

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:14.130
All right.
 

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:17.981
Now this is a wonderful example
of the tension between having

00:44:17.981 --> 00:44:21.429
expectations,
the expectation that someone

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:25.230
will help Tony,
and being in a state of

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:29.079
suspense, not knowing who it
will be.

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:32.315
Now from the adult point of
view, this is culinary because

00:44:32.315 --> 00:44:35.891
we know that we're in the world
of folklore and that in folklore

00:44:35.891 --> 00:44:37.880
everything happens three times.
 

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.117
We know that two vehicles are
going to come along and not help

00:44:41.117 --> 00:44:43.239
Tony and that the third vehicle
will,

00:44:43.239 --> 00:44:47.534
because everything,
as I say, happens in threes in

00:44:47.534 --> 00:44:48.500
folklore.
 

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.442
Notice Tony the Tow
Truck &lt;&lt;emphasizes

00:44:50.442 --> 00:44:51.219
consonants&gt;&gt;
 

00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:53.179
--next week when we read the
Russian formalists,

00:44:53.179 --> 00:44:57.235
we will learn the research
finding of one of the early

00:44:57.235 --> 00:45:01.596
formalists to the effect that
"repetition in verse is

00:45:01.596 --> 00:45:05.039
analogous to tautology in
folklore."

00:45:05.039 --> 00:45:06.650
We have exactly that
&gt;

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:08.518
going on in Tony the Tow
Truck,

00:45:08.518 --> 00:45:11.260
"t- t- t,"
and then the three events,

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.432
Neato the Car,
Speedy the Car,

00:45:13.432 --> 00:45:16.880
and Bumpy the Car coming along
in sequence,

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.030
with Bumpy finally resolving
the problem.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:22.409
So in any case we have an
expectation.

00:45:22.409 --> 00:45:26.690
We have the dialectic of
suspense on the one hand,

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.510
how will this be resolved,
and inevitability on the other,

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.097
"Oh, it's a folk tale,
it'll be resolved,

00:45:32.097 --> 00:45:33.199
don't worry about it."
 

00:45:33.199 --> 00:45:37.904
We have this suspense,
as I say, between expectation,

00:45:37.904 --> 00:45:42.880
the possibility of violation,
and simply not knowing.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.130
Okay.
 

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.983
Now we continue:
"I cannot help you,"

00:45:46.983 --> 00:45:47.719
says Neato the Car.
 

00:45:47.719 --> 00:45:48.967
"I don't want to get
dirty"â€¦

00:45:48.967 --> 00:45:50.469
"I cannot help you,"
says Speedy the Car.

00:45:50.469 --> 00:45:51.775
"I am too
busy"â€¦

00:45:51.775 --> 00:45:52.429
I am very sad.
 

00:45:52.429 --> 00:45:55.170
Then a little car pulls up.
 

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.340
I think it's wonderful because
it "pulls up"

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.391
just like Gadamer being
"pulled up short,"

00:46:01.391 --> 00:46:03.425
and there is,
it seems to me,

00:46:03.425 --> 00:46:07.054
there's another crisis of
expectation in this line in that

00:46:07.054 --> 00:46:10.748
especially as a toddler I need
to negotiate that expression

00:46:10.748 --> 00:46:11.960
idiomatically.
 

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.539
I'm three years old.
 

00:46:13.539 --> 00:46:17.552
Maybe I don't know what
"pulls up"

00:46:17.552 --> 00:46:18.300
means.
 

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.862
It's probably not very good
writing for a toddler precisely

00:46:21.862 --> 00:46:25.253
for that reason,
but at the same time it lends

00:46:25.253 --> 00:46:29.471
itself to us because we
recognize that there's a reading

00:46:29.471 --> 00:46:33.996
problem or a piece of virtual
work that needs to be overcome

00:46:33.996 --> 00:46:36.679
before you can get on with it.
 

00:46:36.679 --> 00:46:39.219
You have to find out what
"pulls up"

00:46:39.219 --> 00:46:42.661
means in the same way that the
adult reader of Pleasures of

00:46:42.661 --> 00:46:45.992
the Imagination has to find
out what "plastic"

00:46:45.992 --> 00:46:46.670
means.
 

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.322
As I say, it's a wonderful
irony that this particular

00:46:50.322 --> 00:46:53.974
difficulty in reading is
precisely what Gadamer calls

00:46:53.974 --> 00:46:55.800
being pulled up short.
 

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.690
All right.
 

00:46:56.690 --> 00:47:00.175
So you solve the problem and
then, lo and behold,

00:47:00.175 --> 00:47:03.420
it turns out that:
It is my friend Bumpy.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.860
Bumpy gives me a push.
 

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.039
He pushes and pushes and-- I'm
on my way.

00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:07.865
"Thank you,
Bumpy,"

00:47:07.865 --> 00:47:08.280
I call back.
 

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.840
"You're welcome,"
says Bumpy.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.260
Now I think we get another
expectation.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.860
This is the kind of story that
has a moral.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.530
It's a feel-good story.
 

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:20.780
Something good has happened.
 

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:25.161
A sense of reciprocity is
established between the tow

00:47:25.161 --> 00:47:29.882
truck and the person who helps
the tow truck out of being

00:47:29.882 --> 00:47:32.963
stuck--
a fine sense of reciprocity,

00:47:32.963 --> 00:47:36.809
so the expectation is that
there will be a moral.

00:47:36.809 --> 00:47:41.010
The tension or suspense is:
what will the moral be?

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:43.360
There are a variety of ways,
in other words,

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.985
in which this story,
just like The Rime of the

00:47:45.985 --> 00:47:47.900
Ancient Mariner,
could end.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.420
It's by no means clear that
The Rhyme of the Ancient

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.800
Mariner will end with
"Love all things,

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.539
great and small things."
 

00:47:53.539 --> 00:47:56.161
It could have ended any number
&gt;

00:47:56.161 --> 00:47:58.279
of other ways,
and just so this story could

00:47:58.279 --> 00:47:59.539
end a number of ways.
 

00:47:59.539 --> 00:48:01.996
It happens to end "Now
that's what I call a

00:48:01.996 --> 00:48:02.780
friend."
 

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:03.789
Well, fine.
 

00:48:03.789 --> 00:48:08.679
The moral is that reciprocity
is friendship and so good,

00:48:08.679 --> 00:48:12.271
all to the good,
but as I say there's a moment

00:48:12.271 --> 00:48:17.221
of suspense in the expectation
at the point in the text when we

00:48:17.221 --> 00:48:22.570
expect a moral but we don't know
what the moral is going to be.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:26.657
Once again, there is that
moment of suspense that the

00:48:26.657 --> 00:48:30.981
reader is able to get through
with a kind of pleasurable

00:48:30.981 --> 00:48:36.250
excitement and then overcome as
the moral is actually revealed.

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:39.856
So even Tony the Tow
Truck, in other

00:48:39.856 --> 00:48:43.534
words,
is not absolutely culinary and

00:48:43.534 --> 00:48:49.159
can be treated in ways that I
hope shed some light on the

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:51.070
reading process.
 

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:51.860
All right.
 

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.253
The time is up,
so let me conclude by saying

00:48:55.253 --> 00:48:59.833
that if there is this
remarkable distinction between

00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:02.851
Gadamer and Iser,
between canons,

00:49:02.851 --> 00:49:07.554
where the methodology of
Gadamer seems to impose on us a

00:49:07.554 --> 00:49:12.085
traditional canon and the
methodology of Iser seems to

00:49:12.085 --> 00:49:15.420
impose on us an innovative
canon,

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:20.500
isn't there some relief in
historicism after all--

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.469
because the whole point of
historicism,

00:49:22.469 --> 00:49:26.090
as Gadamer himself puts it,
is that it lets the canon be?

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:31.192
We're not interested in
establishing a principle of

00:49:31.192 --> 00:49:34.050
value that shapes a canon.
 

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:38.036
We're interested in hearing
everybody on his or her own

00:49:38.036 --> 00:49:40.619
terms and letting those texts
be.

00:49:40.619 --> 00:49:43.940
In other words,
doesn't historicism open the

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.650
canon and indeed make the
process of reading,

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:52.650
the experience of reading,
archival and omnivorous rather

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.170
than canonical?
 

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:59.349
If every text just is what it
is and we can't bring,

00:49:59.349 --> 00:50:02.851
methodologically speaking,
any kind of preconception to

00:50:02.851 --> 00:50:06.159
bear on what's a good text or
what's a bad text,

00:50:06.159 --> 00:50:10.641
haven't we solved the problem
of the limitation imposed on the

00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:13.579
reader by any kind of canon
formation?

00:50:13.579 --> 00:50:17.005
Well, that's the case only,
I say in conclusion,

00:50:17.005 --> 00:50:21.159
if we can distinguish between
meaning and significance.

00:50:21.159 --> 00:50:25.135
In other words,
only if we really are sure that

00:50:25.135 --> 00:50:29.717
the historicist act of reading
is effective and works,

00:50:29.717 --> 00:50:32.829
if I know the meaning of a
text.

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:33.579
Well, fine.
 

00:50:33.579 --> 00:50:36.072
Then later on,
if I wish, I can establish a

00:50:36.072 --> 00:50:39.516
canon by saying certain texts
have certain significance and

00:50:39.516 --> 00:50:43.079
those are the texts that I care
about and want to read,

00:50:43.079 --> 00:50:46.284
but I can only do that if I can
distinguish between meaning and

00:50:46.284 --> 00:50:47.059
significance.
 

00:50:47.059 --> 00:50:49.789
But if meaning and significance
bleed into each other,

00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:53.460
what I'm going to be doing is
establishing a canon,

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.230
as it were, unconsciously or
semiconsciously.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.782
I'm going to say, "Ah,
this is just what the text

00:50:58.782 --> 00:51:00.518
means," but at the same
time,

00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:03.199
I'll be finding ways,
without realizing it,

00:51:03.199 --> 00:51:06.831
of affirming certain kinds of
meaning and discrediting certain

00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:09.739
other kinds of meaning--
all the while saying,

00:51:09.739 --> 00:51:11.619
"Oh, it's just meaning.
 

00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:15.139
I'm not doing that."
 

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:18.297
But if in fact my reading
practice can be shown not

00:51:18.297 --> 00:51:21.773
clearly to distinguish between
meaning and significance,

00:51:21.773 --> 00:51:24.300
well, then that's what would
happen.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:28.172
So it's still up in the air and
it's still perhaps inescapable

00:51:28.172 --> 00:51:31.398
that we read,
as it were, canonically,

00:51:31.398 --> 00:51:36.458
but by thinking of various
approaches to hermeneutics in

00:51:36.458 --> 00:51:39.960
these terms,
I think what's shown is that

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:44.750
there is a relationship between
methodology and canon formation,

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:49.326
that certain things follow from
our assumptions about how to

00:51:49.326 --> 00:51:49.869
read.
 

00:51:49.869 --> 00:51:54.996
Evaluation would seem rather at
a distance removed from simple

00:51:54.996 --> 00:51:59.996
considerations of how to read,
but in fact I think we've shown

00:51:59.996 --> 00:52:04.237
that evaluation is in one way or
another implicit in certain

00:52:04.237 --> 00:52:08.764
methodological premises as they
establish themselves in the work

00:52:08.764 --> 00:52:10.920
of these various writers.
 

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.460
Okay.
 

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:12.489
Thank you very much.

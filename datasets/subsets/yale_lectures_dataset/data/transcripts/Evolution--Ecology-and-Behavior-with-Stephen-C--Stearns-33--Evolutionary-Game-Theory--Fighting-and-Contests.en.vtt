00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.646
Prof: Okay,
this is the second lecture on

00:00:05.646 --> 00:00:06.540
behavior.
 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.221
And today what I want to do is
I want to give you one of the

00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:11.402
major analytical tools for
dealing with behavior,

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:13.130
which is evolutionary game
theory.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.390
And before I get into the body
of the lecture,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.187
basically I want to tell you at
the beginning of the lecture

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:23.448
where it came from--
it came out of Economics--and I

00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:27.598
want to tell you that I'm going
to give you two examples of

00:00:27.598 --> 00:00:30.296
particular games;
one is the hawk-dove game,

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.100
the other is the prisoner's
dilemma.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.395
And it turns out that neither
of these games is really

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:43.490
directly testable with good
biological behavioral examples.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.040
So instead of actually testing
these ideas with biology,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.197
what I'm going to show you is
how biology introduces

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:57.170
interesting qualifications to
the assumptions of the games.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.340
And so I'll give you the two
games,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.530
and then I'll give you a series
of biological examples,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.620
and then comment on how that
really changes our thinking

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.700
about the assumptions of the
games.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.349
But before I go into all of
that, I want to signal--

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:12.890
and I'll come back to this in
the last slide--

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.932
that evolutionary game theory
is one of the parts of

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:18.974
evolutionary biology and
behavior that connects this

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:21.720
field to economics and political
science,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.890
and that the prisoner's dilemma
model,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.500
which I will present in the
middle of it,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.784
actually is a particular
embodiment of the tragedy of the

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:31.602
commons,
which is, of course,

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:35.180
affecting the way that we use
all of our natural resources,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.007
and methods for solving the
tragedy of the commons are

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:43.123
actually central issues in both
economics and in political

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:43.989
science.
 

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:47.855
So this is actually an area in
which there are strong

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:50.980
trans-disciplinary connections
of ideas.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.625
So the basic idea behind an
evolutionary game is that what

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.700
you do depends on what everybody
else is doing,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.680
and that means it's going to be
frequency dependent.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.129
In other words,
if I decide to be aggressive,

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:09.918
in a certain environment,
the success of that will depend

00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:13.639
upon the frequency with which I
encounter resistance.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:19.610
So game theory is fundamentally
frequency dependent.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.074
And the central idea in
evolutionary game theory is that

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:25.470
of the evolutionary stable
strategy.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.150
So I'm going to show you that
that, in fact,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.520
is equivalent to a Nash
equilibrium.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.836
So when you're playing a game
against another member of a

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:39.309
population it's not like playing
a game against the abiotic

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:43.586
environment,
because your opponents can

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:44.500
evolve.
 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.539
It's not like you're playing a
game against,

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:51.569
you know, in a sense of staying
in the game against winter

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.470
temperatures,
or something like that.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.794
You actually have an opponent
that has a strategy,

00:02:57.794 --> 00:02:59.830
and the strategy can change.
 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.550
So that makes the whole
analysis of games the analysis

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.165
of a move and a counter-move,
and that counter-move can

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:14.528
either be dyadic,
where you're playing against

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:17.467
one other player,
or it could be that you could

00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:21.669
conceive of it as playing
against the entire population.

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.500
So there are some nuances there.
 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.113
And in that sense evolutionary
game theory is really very

00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:34.321
fundamentally co-evolutionary;
it's always about how your

00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:37.888
strategy co-evolves with the
other strategies that might pop

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:39.340
up in the population.
 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.780
Okay?
 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.460
But it's strategies within a
population.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.830
Co-evolutionary game theory is
really not applied so much to

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.720
one species evolving against
another.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.065
It's usually,
how will my behavior do against

00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:58.400
the other behaviors that are
present in the population?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.848
Okay, where did it come from?
 

00:04:00.848 --> 00:04:04.120
Well here are some of--here's a
little gallery of heroes.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.705
Basically it comes out of von
Neumann and Morgenstern's book

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:13.988
on game theory,
which was published I think in

00:04:13.988 --> 00:04:17.077
1944,
as then further developed by

00:04:17.077 --> 00:04:20.990
people like John Nash and
Reinhardt Selten.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.759
So these guys more or less
founded it.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.968
And you can actually go into
Maynard Smith's book on

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:31.678
evolutionary game theory and
pull out of the appendix of von

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:35.389
Neumann and Morgenstern one of
the payoff matrices that they

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.521
use;
I mean, you can see that these

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.677
guys were actually studying that
book, and then developing it in

00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:42.029
an evolutionary context.
 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.690
John von Neumann was a
Hungarian genius who managed to

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.526
show how some of the basic
problems in quantum mechanics

00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:54.779
could be connected and
explained;

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.767
he did that back in 1929,
and then he went on more or

00:04:57.767 --> 00:05:01.389
less to invent the idea of an
operating system for computers.

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.076
So he contributed very greatly
to the conceptual underpinnings

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:08.440
of the information revolution;
and he also invented game

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.899
theory.
 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.019
So John von Neumann was a
bright guy.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.194
John Nash, of course,
is famous from the book and the

00:05:14.194 --> 00:05:18.072
movie A Beautiful Mind,
as the fellow who saw at

00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:22.497
Princeton that the stable
solution to a game that is being

00:05:22.497 --> 00:05:27.156
played between two parties is
that the stable solution is the

00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:31.658
one that you play when everybody
else is playing their best

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:33.600
possible strategy.
 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.690
Okay?
 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.230
That's the insight that he had
in the bar at Princeton,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.387
as a graduate student,
and then he succumbed to his

00:05:41.387 --> 00:05:45.052
schizophrenia and didn't really
recover until he was in his

00:05:45.052 --> 00:05:45.810
sixties.
 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.012
And Reinhardt Selten is a
German professor who developed

00:05:51.012 --> 00:05:55.079
game theory in the context of
economics,

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:58.733
and generalized it into all
sorts- using all sorts of

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.560
alternative assumptions.
 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.209
And these two guys shared the
Nobel Prize in Economics for it.

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:05.949
So that's where it came from.
 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:13.528
And these are some of the key
events that I've just gone over.

00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:17.538
And then these ideas were
developed by George Price,

00:06:17.538 --> 00:06:21.233
a really remarkable guy,
and John Maynard Smith,

00:06:21.233 --> 00:06:24.300
and applied in biological
behavior.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.949
And John's book came out in
1982.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.709
So it had a lot of impact.
 

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:32.670
And if John had just been
willing to recognize and

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.279
acknowledge that in fact an ESS
is a Nash equilibrium,

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.720
he probably would've shared in
that Nobel Prize.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.910
But he didn't.
 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.579
This is John.
 

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:46.300
He was a very good dishwasher.
 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.399
I spent a lot of time with him.
 

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:50.089
So that's one of my photos.
 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:53.476
And really the key figure that
stimulated John,

00:06:53.476 --> 00:06:57.600
just as he stimulated Bill
Hamilton, was George Price.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.877
And George Price was developing
these ideas in the context of

00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:04.800
the puzzle of altruism and
cooperation;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.122
how did cooperation and
altruism ever come to be in an

00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:11.000
evolutionary context?
 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.050
And you'll see that when we
come to the prisoner's dilemma

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.675
and I talk about Axelrod's
experiment with competing

00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:22.870
different strategies against
each other on a computer,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:30.103
that Price really actually
contributed twice to the

00:07:30.103 --> 00:07:32.870
solution,
or to our thinking,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.125
about this problem of where did
altruism and cooperation come

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:36.560
from?
 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.016
One, in the context of game
theory, and once in the context

00:07:40.016 --> 00:07:42.759
of kin selection and
hierarchical selection.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.920
Okay, here are the basics.
 

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.134
The basic thing that you ask in
game theory is can any

00:07:50.134 --> 00:07:52.759
conceivable alternative invade?
 

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.658
And this turns out to be
why--by invade I mean will a

00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:58.946
mutation come up that modifies
behavior, and if it comes up,

00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:01.120
will it increase in the
population?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.211
If it's going to increase in
the population,

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.985
it will do so because it has
greater lifetime reproductive

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:06.569
success.
 

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.927
So if that gene affects a
behavioral strategy in such a

00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:13.410
way that over the course of the
lifetime it increases the

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.829
reproductive success relative to
other strategies,

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:19.199
that will be what we call
invasion.

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:26.187
So if alternatives cannot
invade, then that means that the

00:08:26.187 --> 00:08:29.209
resident strategy,
the one that's already there,

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.720
is an evolutionary stable
strategy.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.870
So the stability means
stability against invasion;

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.750
stability against alternatives.
 

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.860
Now you might ask yourself,
how do we know what all the

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.658
alternatives are?
 

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:49.330
And the answer is in reality we
don't.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.042
But in theory we can imagine,
if we restrict our attention to

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:55.580
a certain scope of possible
behaviors,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.178
that the alternatives are all
the possible combinations of

00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:01.639
behaviors within that restricted
set.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.460
Okay?
 

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.278
So that is actually the thing
that's going on.

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.409
The theorist is sitting there
and saying, "Should I be

00:09:07.409 --> 00:09:08.990
more aggressive or less
aggressive?"

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.928
Well all the possible behaviors
consist of not being aggressive

00:09:11.928 --> 00:09:14.299
at all, or being very
aggressive, and everything in

00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:14.870
between.
 

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.778
So those would be the ones that
you tested against.

00:09:18.778 --> 00:09:21.696
You'll see how that works when
we go through a couple of

00:09:21.696 --> 00:09:22.278
examples.
 

00:09:22.278 --> 00:09:25.159
So the ESS is then a strategy
that resists invasion,

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:28.436
and it turns out that it's
exactly the same thing as a Nash

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:29.340
equilibrium.
 

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.750
So when John Nash solved this
problem for game theory,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:39.022
back in Princeton in I think
1951, he in fact was also at the

00:09:39.022 --> 00:09:44.118
same time solving the problem
that Maynard Smith and George

00:09:44.118 --> 00:09:50.529
Price posed in I think 1973;
just in a different context.

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:53.976
So here's a simple game,
and this is one of the first

00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:56.759
that Price and Maynard Smith
cooked up,

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:59.309
to try to illustrate how you
would apply this thinking to

00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:00.129
animal behavior.
 

00:10:00.129 --> 00:10:01.658
And they called it the
hawk-dove game.

00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:05.996
So two animals come together,
and they're going to fight over

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:08.730
a resource,
and that resource has value V,

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.289
and that means that the fitness
of the winner will be increased

00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:12.750
by V.
 

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.870
Okay?
 

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.009
The loser doesn't have to have
zero fitness,

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:19.128
it's just what--it's the
increment in fitness which is

00:10:19.128 --> 00:10:22.480
determined by this particular
encounter that we're talking

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.070
about.
 

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.095
So we say, "Well,
they can have one of two

00:10:26.095 --> 00:10:27.937
strategies;
they can be hawks or

00:10:27.937 --> 00:10:28.580
doves."
 

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.984
And the idea is that the hawk
strategy is that you escalate

00:10:31.984 --> 00:10:35.330
and you continue to fight either
until you're injured,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.631
in which case you have to back
off because you can't fight

00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:40.557
anymore,
or until you win and the

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.375
opponent retreats,
in which case you get the whole

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:43.769
thing.
 

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:48.840
And the dove strategy is that
you go up and you display,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.559
and if the opponent escalates,
you back off immediately and

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:55.168
run away,
and if the opponent doesn't

00:10:55.168 --> 00:10:58.710
escalate you'll see that you'll
share the resource.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.629
Okay?
 

00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:03.086
If two hawks encounter each
other, then one or both are

00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:06.028
going to be injured,
and the injury will reduce

00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:07.950
fitness by a certain cost.
 

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.394
So being a hawk has a benefit
in that you can be aggressive

00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:14.240
and acquire resources,
but it has a cost in that if

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.004
you run into another hawk,
you can get beaten up and

00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:18.870
injured.
 

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.335
So this is sort of the
fundamental intellectual

00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:26.379
construct of game theory;
it's a payoff matrix.

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:30.226
And the idea is that it lays
out, for the things on the left,

00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:34.138
what happens to them when they
interact with the things on the

00:11:34.138 --> 00:11:34.779
right.
 

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:35.548
Okay?
 

00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:39.529
So when a hawk interacts with a
hawk, this is its payoff.

00:11:39.529 --> 00:11:41.808
When it interacts with a dove,
this is its payoff.

00:11:41.808 --> 00:11:44.759
When a dove interacts with a
hawk, this is its payoff,

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:47.820
and when it interacts with a
dove, that's its payoff.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.500
I'm going to take you through
that.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.068
So if a hawk encounters a hawk,
it has a fifty percent chance

00:11:53.068 --> 00:11:56.460
of winning and a fifty percent
chance of being injured.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:01.570
So its payoff is one-half of
the benefit minus the cost.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:07.106
So you just see we're kind of
averaging that payoff over many

00:12:07.106 --> 00:12:09.600
such possible encounters.
 

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.464
So the assumption here is that
hawks are total blockheads and

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:15.236
they escalate blindly;
they disregard differences in

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:18.086
size and condition;
they're really stupid,

00:12:18.086 --> 00:12:22.245
they just go in there and they
fight for the resource,

00:12:22.245 --> 00:12:26.090
and they don't have any nuance
to them at all.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:32.558
The dove will give up the
resource.

00:12:32.558 --> 00:12:36.206
If a hawk encounters a dove,
it gets the resource,

00:12:36.206 --> 00:12:37.769
the dove gets zero.
 

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:40.200
So it gives it up and the hawk
gets it;

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.690
and that's what these entries
in the matrix mean.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.178
Okay?
 

00:12:43.178 --> 00:12:47.130
So the hawk is encountering the
dove, the dove is encountering

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.240
the hawk, the hawk gets V,
the dove gets zero.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.024
That doesn't mean it has zero
fitness, it just means that its

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:57.178
fitness doesn't change because
of the encounter.

00:12:57.178 --> 00:12:59.727
It doesn't get anything in
addition, but it also doesn't

00:12:59.727 --> 00:13:00.470
lose anything.
 

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.658
So you can think of the dove as
a risk-averse strategy.

00:13:05.658 --> 00:13:09.658
When a dove meets a dove,
they share it.

00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:11.529
They sort of shake hands and
say, "Hey,

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:12.139
50/50."
 

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:21.350
Now if a strategy is going to
be stable,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:25.268
then it must be the case that
if almost all members of the

00:13:25.268 --> 00:13:28.639
population adopt it,
then the fitness of the typical

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:31.639
member is greater than that of
any possible mutant;

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:35.461
otherwise a mutant could
invade, and that would mean the

00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:37.200
strategy wasn't stable.
 

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.330
So in this case if we let W of
H be the fitness of the hawk,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.340
and W of D be the fitness of
the dove,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.856
and E of H,D be the payoff to
an individual adopting a hawk

00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:53.381
against a dove--
and we have two possible

00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:54.918
strategies,
I and J;

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.730
so these are going to be,
in general,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.629
what we've instanced by hawk
and dove here--

00:13:59.629 --> 00:14:03.494
I is going to be stable if the
fitness of I is greater than the

00:14:03.494 --> 00:14:04.428
fitness of J.
 

00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:09.491
And if the mutant J is at very
low- when we assume the mutant

00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:11.769
is at very low frequency.
 

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:15.373
So if I is going to be stable,
at very low frequency,

00:14:15.373 --> 00:14:19.046
then when I encounters I,
it has a higher fitness than

00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:20.710
when J encounters I.
 

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.269
Or when I encounters I,
it has the same fitness as when

00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:25.389
J encounters I.
 

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:28.619
And when I encounters J,
it has a greater fitness than

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:29.960
when J encounters J.
 

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.389
Okay?
 

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:34.798
So this is just a way of being
very careful and logical about

00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:38.399
laying out the different
possible relationships of

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.309
fitness on encounters.
 

00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:41.879
Now what happens?
 

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:45.110
Well dove is not an ESS.
 

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.413
If a population is 100% doves
and one hawk pops up,

00:14:48.413 --> 00:14:51.519
it's going to interact almost
all with doves.

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:53.340
It's not going to run into any
hawks.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.687
It's just going to go around
beating up doves and taking away

00:14:57.687 --> 00:14:58.629
the spoils.
 

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:00.080
So it will invade.
 

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:07.214
Hawk will be an ESS if the
payoff of an encounter is

00:15:07.214 --> 00:15:12.950
greater than the cost of the
encounter.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.090
Okay?
 

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:22.129
Now even if the population is
100% hawks,

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:26.010
and every other individual it
encountered is somebody that

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.721
fights and beats you up,
that will be stable if V is

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:30.830
greater than C.
 

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.759
But what happens if V is less
than C?

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:36.750
Well if the cost of injury is
high, relative to the reward of

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.610
victory, then we expect mixed
strategies.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:46.572
That means the following:
if we--well I'll ask you to

00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:48.178
play this.
 

00:15:48.178 --> 00:15:50.350
Just think about this situation
a little bit,

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.506
and I would like you to take
just a moment to explain what's

00:15:54.506 --> 00:15:58.267
going on to each other,
and then I'll ask one of you to

00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:02.057
tell me what happens when you
start with 100% doves and a hawk

00:16:02.057 --> 00:16:05.157
mutant pops up,
and another of you to tell me

00:16:05.157 --> 00:16:09.519
what happens when you have 100%
hawks and a dove mutant pops up,

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:13.009
when this condition is the
case--okay?--

00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:17.509
when it really hurts a hawk to
encounter another hawk?

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:21.777
So take a minute to describe to
your partner what that frequency

00:16:21.777 --> 00:16:25.096
dependence is like,
and then I will ask one of you

00:16:25.096 --> 00:16:27.399
to replay each of those cases.
 

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:28.308
Okay?
 

00:16:28.308 --> 00:16:51.870
&lt;&lt;Class members confer
with one another&gt;&gt;

00:16:51.870 --> 00:17:07.526
&lt;&lt;Professor Stearns
speaks with someone off lecture

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:11.720
topic&gt;&gt;
 

00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:01.088
Prof: Okay, let's go.
 

00:18:01.088 --> 00:18:06.602
Who would like to explain what
happens when you have a

00:18:06.602 --> 00:18:12.218
population which is 100% hawks
and a dove crops up as a

00:18:12.218 --> 00:18:13.569
mutation?
 

00:18:13.569 --> 00:18:16.170
What happens?
 

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.244
Student: Mutation by the
hawk doesn't,

00:18:19.244 --> 00:18:23.299
because the doves are able to
&gt;.

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:24.599
Prof: Okay.
 

00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:26.180
Why did that happen?
 

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.171
Student:  Because every
time it repeats it,

00:18:29.171 --> 00:18:31.307
every time
&gt;

00:18:31.307 --> 00:18:35.460
, and there's never a situation
where &gt;.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.240
Prof: Well actually it
doesn't happen Manny;

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.990
it's not quite like that.
 

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.990
Remember what the payoff is for
the dove.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:48.473
When the dove encounters a
hawk, its payoff- its fitness

00:18:48.473 --> 00:18:50.069
doesn't alter.
 

00:18:50.069 --> 00:18:51.309
Okay?
 

00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:52.900
Another idea.
 

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.671
Student:  It will
increase in its cost because

00:18:56.671 --> 00:19:00.950
since there's a dove reaching
out at the hawk as a dove,

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.836
it gains I guess a lot more
than it gains just because of

00:19:04.836 --> 00:19:05.598
the hawk.
 

00:19:05.598 --> 00:19:07.890
And you said the fitness of the
dove wouldn't change.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.769
So that one dove will at least
be present.

00:19:09.769 --> 00:19:12.000
So it will
&gt;.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.233
Prof: Yes,
what's the average fitness of

00:19:14.233 --> 00:19:15.740
the hawks in that population?
 

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.088
Student: One-half V
minus C.

00:19:18.088 --> 00:19:21.950
Prof: Yes,
and V is less than C?

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.118
Student: Yes.
 

00:19:23.118 --> 00:19:25.720
Prof: So it's a negative
isn't it?

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.539
Is 0 bigger than a negative
number?

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:33.710
What happens to the doves?
 

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.430
They increase.
 

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.021
They increase because they
actually don't bear any cost at

00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:45.240
all when they run into a hawk;
their fitness is not decreased.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.483
And so basically they are a
neutral allele that's introduced

00:19:48.483 --> 00:19:50.904
into the population,
and if they have perfect

00:19:50.904 --> 00:19:52.940
heredity, they start
reproducing.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.980
Right?
 

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.801
And basically what's going on
is that the hawks are mutilating

00:19:58.801 --> 00:19:59.828
each other.
 

00:19:59.828 --> 00:20:05.005
They're damaging each other so
much that even though the dove's

00:20:05.005 --> 00:20:08.876
fitness is zero on this scale,
it's still greater than the

00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:11.646
hawk's,
which when the hawks are mostly

00:20:11.646 --> 00:20:15.880
encountering hawks is negative,
on this scale.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.470
Okay, now let's turn it around.
 

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.259
What happens when it's all
doves and a hawk enters the

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:25.930
population;
what happens?

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.048
We have a population that we've
just made in our mind.

00:20:29.048 --> 00:20:31.420
It's 100% doves and a hawk
comes in.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.829
Student: It really
depends if it's a hawk.

00:20:38.829 --> 00:20:41.410
Prof: Go further.
 

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.463
Student:  So if there's
one hawk,

00:20:43.463 --> 00:20:44.940
&gt;.
 

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.329
Prof: Yeah,
it goes like gangbusters.

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:49.781
It only meets doves;
it never gets beaten up by

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:50.838
another hawk.
 

00:20:50.838 --> 00:20:55.190
Student:  So if there's
&gt;.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.000
Prof: Yes,
and so it just keeps going.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.670
Right.
 

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.651
So from either side,
from either 100% doves or from

00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:03.048
100% hawks, the vector is
towards the middle somewhere;

00:21:03.048 --> 00:21:06.236
and where it's going to
stabilize depends on the

00:21:06.236 --> 00:21:08.000
relationship of V and C.
 

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.710
Okay?
 

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.990
That's why this is a mixed
strategy.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:17.690
Neither strategy is an
evolutionarily stable strategy.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:22.420
The only reason that they can
persist, with this relationship

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.836
of V to C, is that they come to
some kind of intermediate

00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:27.940
frequency.
 

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.221
If there's too many hawks the
doves will win out,

00:21:31.221 --> 00:21:35.118
and if there are too many doves
the hawks will win out.

00:21:35.118 --> 00:21:41.037
Okay now, so that's one- that's
an example of a game that will

00:21:41.037 --> 00:21:43.848
result in a mixed strategy.
 

00:21:43.848 --> 00:21:45.710
Now let's look at the
prisoner's dilemma.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.779
Okay?
 

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:49.998
So this is the payoff matrix
for player one,

00:21:49.998 --> 00:21:53.195
this is the strategy of player
one, and this is the strategy of

00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:53.970
player two.
 

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.420
And C stands for cooperate and
D stands for defect.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.869
So basically the reason this
game is set up this way is that

00:22:02.869 --> 00:22:07.622
it's trying to show you that it
would be better for both players

00:22:07.622 --> 00:22:11.140
to cooperate,
but both players are actually

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.046
motivated to defect,
and so if you have short-term

00:22:15.046 --> 00:22:17.932
selfishness,
which is determining the

00:22:17.932 --> 00:22:21.368
outcome, defection will win over
cooperation.

00:22:21.368 --> 00:22:24.578
So that you will not,
in this circumstance,

00:22:24.578 --> 00:22:27.393
just playing this game one
shot, you will not get the

00:22:27.393 --> 00:22:30.529
evolution of cooperation and
altruism out of the prisoner's

00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:31.180
dilemma.
 

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.710
Instead you will get the
tragedy of the commons.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.568
So the entries here.
 

00:22:37.568 --> 00:22:40.660
This is the expected value of
cooperator playing cooperator;

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.990
cooperator playing defector;
defector playing cooperator;

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.279
and defector playing defector.
 

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:50.112
And if we put in some
particular numbers that actually

00:22:50.112 --> 00:22:53.798
represent an instance of the
general conditions,

00:22:53.798 --> 00:22:59.942
these particular numbers are
chosen in such a way that

00:22:59.942 --> 00:23:04.230
defection will in fact be
selected.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.037
So cooperation will be an ESS
if the expected value of C

00:23:08.037 --> 00:23:12.329
playing C is greater than the
expected value of D playing C.

00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:16.390
Okay?
 

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.288
And that's not the case.
 

00:23:18.288 --> 00:23:22.441
D will be an ESS if the
expected value of D playing D is

00:23:22.441 --> 00:23:26.140
greater than the expected value
of C playing D;

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.259
which is true.
 

00:23:28.259 --> 00:23:36.769
Now look at the payoffs:
3 is greater than 1.

00:23:36.769 --> 00:23:40.810
If the population were all
cooperators, everybody would get

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:41.088
3.
 

00:23:41.088 --> 00:23:45.065
If the population is all
defectors, everybody only gets

00:23:45.065 --> 00:23:45.358
1.
 

00:23:45.358 --> 00:23:50.348
But because of the way the
payoff matrix is set up,

00:23:50.348 --> 00:23:53.540
with the interactions between
the cooperators and the

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.768
defectors,
this is the evolutionary stable

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:58.374
strategy,
and this one,

00:23:58.374 --> 00:24:03.115
which is great for the group,
is not stable against invasions

00:24:03.115 --> 00:24:06.383
by defectors,
because the payoff to a

00:24:06.383 --> 00:24:10.210
defector, who is playing against
a cooperator,

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.460
is even greater.
 

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.837
But when a defector plays
against a defector,

00:24:14.837 --> 00:24:16.460
life gets pretty unpleasant.
 

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.538
So in fact this is the tragedy
of the commons.

00:24:20.538 --> 00:24:25.130
So the general condition for
this,

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.358
okay, if we do the algebra
rather than the arithmetic,

00:24:28.358 --> 00:24:33.102
is that the stable strategy is
always to defect from the social

00:24:33.102 --> 00:24:35.678
contract,
always not to cooperate,

00:24:35.678 --> 00:24:39.616
if T is greater than (*&gt;*) R,
R *&gt;* P, P *&gt;* S,

00:24:39.616 --> 00:24:43.740
and R *&gt;* than the average of S
and T.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:48.377
So that this all has been
analyzed in detail,

00:24:48.377 --> 00:24:54.174
and this is sort of the
paradigmatic social science game

00:24:54.174 --> 00:24:57.759
that is used in many contexts.
 

00:24:57.759 --> 00:25:01.608
Now what if you play it again
and again?

00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:06.798
This was the first idea about
how even in this circumstance,

00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:08.500
even if you're playing a
prisoner's dilemma game,

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.035
with rewards set up like this,
you could get the evolution of

00:25:12.035 --> 00:25:12.859
cooperation.
 

00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:14.119
Just do it again and again.
 

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:15.009
Okay?
 

00:25:15.009 --> 00:25:18.820
So you're not just playing
once, you're playing many times

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.558
against the same person.
 

00:25:20.558 --> 00:25:26.288
And a very simple strategy
turned out to work.

00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:27.778
Bill Axelrod,
at the University of Michigan--

00:25:27.778 --> 00:25:29.929
he's a political
scientist--said,

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:33.019
"I want to hold a computer
tournament,

00:25:33.019 --> 00:25:36.404
and I want everybody around the
world who's interested in this

00:25:36.404 --> 00:25:39.732
issue to send me their computer
program to play against other

00:25:39.732 --> 00:25:42.240
computer programs,
in an iterated prisoner's

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:42.980
dilemma."
 

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.532
And it turned out that a very
simple one did extremely well,

00:25:47.532 --> 00:25:49.538
and that is Tit-for-Tat.
 

00:25:49.538 --> 00:25:52.570
So you cooperate on the first
move--if you've run into a

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.500
defector, you get beat up by
him;

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.578
if you run into a cooperator
you win, both of you win.

00:25:58.578 --> 00:26:01.390
And then you do whatever the
guy did last time.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:07.003
So the essential features of
Tit-for-Tat, that make it work,

00:26:07.003 --> 00:26:12.522
is that it retaliates but it's
forgiving, it doesn't hold a

00:26:12.522 --> 00:26:13.569
grudge.
 

00:26:13.569 --> 00:26:15.980
Okay?
 

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.940
The other guy defects on you,
you're going to punish him.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.115
If he switches to cooperation,
you say, "Oh fine,

00:26:22.115 --> 00:26:25.230
I don't hold a grudge,
I'll cooperate with you on the

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.430
next time."
 

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:31.528
So after a huge amount of
research,

00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:34.792
it turns out that there are
some extremely nuanced and

00:26:34.792 --> 00:26:38.364
complicated strategies that can
do a little bit better than

00:26:38.364 --> 00:26:39.348
Tit-for-Tat.
 

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:44.220
But the appeal of Tit-for-Tat
is its simplicity.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.769
It doesn't take very much
cognitive power to implement

00:26:47.769 --> 00:26:49.578
this behavioral strategy.
 

00:26:49.578 --> 00:26:52.609
It doesn't take very much
memory to implement it.

00:26:52.609 --> 00:26:54.410
Okay?
 

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:58.887
It seems to be something which
is simple and robust and that

00:26:58.887 --> 00:26:59.420
wins.
 

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.883
Now as soon as you put in
space, you can get a much more

00:27:02.883 --> 00:27:04.078
complex strategy.
 

00:27:04.078 --> 00:27:08.528
And the take-home from that is
that if you have what's called

00:27:08.528 --> 00:27:11.987
population viscosity,
which means that particular

00:27:11.987 --> 00:27:15.651
individuals tend to encounter
each other more spatially than

00:27:15.651 --> 00:27:19.130
if they're just randomly mixed
up in the population,

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.098
that promotes cooperation.
 

00:27:23.098 --> 00:27:25.988
So Martin Novak,
up at Harvard--actually he was

00:27:25.988 --> 00:27:30.922
at Princeton when he did this--
he came up with a whole lot of

00:27:30.922 --> 00:27:33.852
nice,
two-dimensional representations

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.019
of those games.
 

00:27:35.019 --> 00:27:36.910
And this is one possible
outcome here.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:37.259
Okay?
 

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:40.808
So here blue is a
cooperator--and these guys are,

00:27:40.808 --> 00:27:43.380
by the way, playing prisoner's
dilemma,

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.779
and they're playing prisoner's
dilemma against their neighbors;

00:27:46.779 --> 00:27:50.233
they're not playing randomly in
space, they're actually playing

00:27:50.233 --> 00:27:53.798
against the neighbors that are
physically sitting right there.

00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:58.021
So blue represents somebody
that was a cooperator on the

00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:01.170
previous round and is a
cooperator now;

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.038
whether they retain in the
population or not depends on

00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:08.910
whether they're losing or
winning in the encounters.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.650
Green is a cooperator that was
a defector.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:16.115
And here you can see that here
are some cooperators that have

00:28:16.115 --> 00:28:20.012
won against some defectors,
and they're forming a little

00:28:20.012 --> 00:28:23.460
ring right around that little
blue island of cooperation.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.897
And red is a defector that was
a defector, and yellow is a

00:28:26.897 --> 00:28:28.890
defector that was a cooperator.
 

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.137
And what happens in this
particular game is that the

00:28:33.137 --> 00:28:38.053
percent cooperation goes up,
comes down, stabilizes right at

00:28:38.053 --> 00:28:38.720
30%.
 

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.896
So in a situation in which--the
prisoner's dilemma suggests,

00:28:43.896 --> 00:28:48.109
if you just consider an
interaction in isolation,

00:28:48.109 --> 00:28:51.269
it's going to be 100%
defectors.

00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:54.404
Just putting in space and
giving individuals a chance to

00:28:54.404 --> 00:28:57.882
interact repeatedly with other
individuals creates a situation

00:28:57.882 --> 00:29:00.846
where often cooperators are
actually interacting with

00:29:00.846 --> 00:29:03.248
cooperators,
and they're getting a win,

00:29:03.248 --> 00:29:05.988
and as soon as they build up a
little spatial island of

00:29:05.988 --> 00:29:08.519
cooperation,
they do great.

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:13.020
So they hold their own in a sea
of defectors,

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:19.160
just due to the two-dimensional
nature of the interaction.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:24.193
Okay, so thus far in the
lecture I have give you pretty

00:29:24.193 --> 00:29:27.828
abstract mathematical kinds of
stuff.

00:29:27.828 --> 00:29:31.628
And what I now want to do is go
into a series of biological

00:29:31.628 --> 00:29:32.348
examples.
 

00:29:32.348 --> 00:29:36.661
And the biological examples are
not direct tests of evolutionary

00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:37.618
game theory.
 

00:29:37.618 --> 00:29:41.190
What they are is the
application of game theoretical

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.434
thinking to biological contexts,
that then inform us about the

00:29:45.434 --> 00:29:48.160
assumptions that we're making in
the games.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.573
And one of the early
applications was to the

00:29:50.573 --> 00:29:51.920
bowl-and-doily spider.
 

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.900
So this is a female
bowl-and-doily spider.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.940
It doesn't really show her bowl
and her doily,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.117
but basically what she does is
she spins a web that looks like

00:30:00.117 --> 00:30:02.452
a bowl,
and then it has a layer down

00:30:02.452 --> 00:30:04.720
below it that looks like a
doily,

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.348
and she puts up trip lines that
go up above it,

00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:11.056
so that insects that are flying
along hit one of these trip

00:30:11.056 --> 00:30:13.681
lines and fall into the bowl,
and she's sitting on the doily

00:30:13.681 --> 00:30:14.849
and she comes up and grabs it.
 

00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:16.308
Okay?
 

00:30:16.308 --> 00:30:21.088
And it's on the doily that the
mating interactions take place.

00:30:21.088 --> 00:30:26.631
So this figure should look
pretty familiar to you from the

00:30:26.631 --> 00:30:28.088
last lecture.
 

00:30:28.088 --> 00:30:32.202
Insemination in spiders works
pretty much like insemination in

00:30:32.202 --> 00:30:33.078
dung flies.
 

00:30:33.078 --> 00:30:37.101
The probability that a male
will fertilize eggs increases

00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:40.980
from the start of copulation up
to a certain point,

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.108
where he's getting perhaps 90
or 95% of them.

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:49.157
So he's getting diminishing
marginal returns as he sits on

00:30:49.157 --> 00:30:50.308
the female.
 

00:30:50.308 --> 00:30:56.189
And in this study the contrast
was between a resident male who

00:30:56.189 --> 00:31:01.682
actually had gone in and had
successfully displayed to the

00:31:01.682 --> 00:31:04.926
female,
and knew whether or not

00:31:04.926 --> 00:31:08.828
copulation was actually now
taking place,

00:31:08.828 --> 00:31:14.160
or was going to take place,
and a new intruder who's coming

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.618
in.
 

00:31:14.618 --> 00:31:17.113
So if the resident is somebody
who's going to have this

00:31:17.113 --> 00:31:19.545
experience,
and the intruder coming in has

00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:23.797
no idea what's been going on--
okay?--we will assume that the

00:31:23.797 --> 00:31:28.130
intruder knows nothing about the
shape of this curve;

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.914
it may know that the curve has
started but it knows nothing

00:31:30.914 --> 00:31:31.778
about the shape.
 

00:31:31.778 --> 00:31:35.710
So it has to simply make an
assumption about the average

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.068
value of that female--the
intruder is a male.

00:31:39.068 --> 00:31:42.700
Whereas the resident knows what
this curve is,

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.298
then the payoff to the resident
gets greater and greater,

00:31:47.298 --> 00:31:50.310
the longer the copulation goes
on, and then it drops towards

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.740
the end of the copulation.
 

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.519
It's already gotten 90% of the
eggs.

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:54.490
Okay?
 

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.857
And so actually this happens
pretty quickly,

00:31:56.857 --> 00:31:59.118
which is kind of nice;
I mean, if you're doing a

00:31:59.118 --> 00:32:01.185
behavioral study in the field,
it's nice to have it over

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:02.838
quickly so you can get your data
quickly.

00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:06.511
Only seven minutes after the
beginning of insemination that

00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:10.183
female doesn't have very much
more added value to that male

00:32:10.183 --> 00:32:12.588
and he would be better going
off--

00:32:12.588 --> 00:32:14.808
as you know from the marginal
value theorem,

00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:17.259
that line, at the tangent,
is going to be crossing

00:32:17.259 --> 00:32:20.482
probably somewhere up in here--
it's good for him to jump off,

00:32:20.482 --> 00:32:22.108
try to go find another female.
 

00:32:22.108 --> 00:32:25.640
Whereas that intruder coming
in, not having so much

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.813
information about the system,
at least on a simple

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:31.242
assumption, just thinks,
oh, the female has a certain

00:32:31.242 --> 00:32:33.920
kind of average value,
and I'm not- I haven't been

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.349
able to copulate with her yet,
so this is what I expect.

00:32:37.349 --> 00:32:38.420
Okay?
 

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.470
Well if you look at the actual
behavior of spiders.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.730
This is the observed,
this is the predicted.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.306
So the predicted is that the
percentage of fights that would

00:32:48.306 --> 00:32:50.548
be won by the resident would go
up;

00:32:50.548 --> 00:32:54.250
he would fight really hard if
he were interrupted,

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.269
after a certain point in
copulation,

00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:59.529
assuming he could start over
again,

00:32:59.529 --> 00:33:03.230
and that after he had been
copulating for seven minutes,

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.538
he wouldn't care anymore.
 

00:33:04.538 --> 00:33:09.051
So the prediction is intensity
of fighting would peak and then

00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:12.270
drop;
and the observed values seem to

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.450
follow that pretty well.
 

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:18.288
So here's the twist on game
theory.

00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:24.349
The cost-benefit ratio in the
payoff matrix is being altered

00:33:24.349 --> 00:33:30.305
by the behavior of copulation,
and one of the participants

00:33:30.305 --> 00:33:33.440
knows and the other one doesn't.
 

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.888
So the thing that this example
introduces into evolutionary

00:33:36.888 --> 00:33:40.397
game theory is the whole issue
of who has information on the

00:33:40.397 --> 00:33:43.894
potential payoffs of the game,
and it shows that that makes a

00:33:43.894 --> 00:33:44.650
big difference.
 

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.808
Okay?
 

00:33:46.808 --> 00:33:49.480
And that's not in the
assumptions of hawk versus dove;

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.380
it's not in the assumptions of
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.990
This is some important aspect
of biology that alters that

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.700
analysis.
 

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.450
So this just runs through what
happens.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.670
You put both males in at the
start, the bigger male will win.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:04.920
Okay?
 

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.755
So if neither of them has any
information, any more

00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:12.360
information than the other,
the big one wins.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.603
If they're the same size,
the fights are settled by

00:34:15.603 --> 00:34:17.809
what's the difference in reward?
 

00:34:17.809 --> 00:34:18.630
Okay?
 

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.257
So the resident will fight
longer and will be more likely

00:34:21.257 --> 00:34:23.650
to win at the end of the
pre-insemination phase,

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.969
but intruders are more likely
to win after seven minutes of

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:26.570
insemination.
 

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.260
If a resident is smaller than
the intruder,

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.079
they persist longer,
when the reward was greater.

00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:39.443
So you will find weenie little
runts fighting great big bullies

00:34:39.443 --> 00:34:43.880
if they know something about the
reward they're going to get.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.862
And if the costs and benefits
are nearly identical,

00:34:47.862 --> 00:34:52.882
they'll fight until one or both
are seriously injured or in fact

00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:53.599
dead.
 

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:58.420
So this is another way,
of course, of underlining that

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.605
the payoff in evolution is
number of offspring,

00:35:02.605 --> 00:35:04.969
not personal survival.
 

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:08.987
So they're willing to risk a
lot, if there's a lot on the

00:35:08.987 --> 00:35:09.489
line.
 

00:35:09.489 --> 00:35:12.396
So that's one biological
example, and that's the

00:35:12.396 --> 00:35:13.880
bowl-and-doily spider.
 

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.130
This next example has to do
with Harris sparrows.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:24.681
And again it has to do with
information, but now it also has

00:35:24.681 --> 00:35:30.789
something to do with honest
signaling and perception.

00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:36.503
So there is a sense here in
which what you're going to see

00:35:36.503 --> 00:35:41.815
is simple-minded sparrows
getting really ticked off at

00:35:41.815 --> 00:35:43.719
being deceived.
 

00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:44.268
Okay?
 

00:35:44.268 --> 00:35:46.760
So this is a study done by
Seivert Rohwer,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.657
who's in the museum at the
University of Washington in

00:35:49.657 --> 00:35:51.862
Seattle,
and what he noticed was that if

00:35:51.862 --> 00:35:56.041
you just go out in Nature,
you see a lot of variation in

00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:59.619
how dark the heads of the males
are,

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:03.311
and that these guys with the
dark heads are dominant and they

00:36:03.311 --> 00:36:04.849
win most of the fights.
 

00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:07.869
And by the way,
you see a lot of this in birds,

00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:11.885
that they have a signal that
they can give that is a signal

00:36:11.885 --> 00:36:15.902
of their condition and of the
likelihood that they might be

00:36:15.902 --> 00:36:18.949
able to win a fight if they got
into it.

00:36:18.949 --> 00:36:21.809
So here are some of the
experiments;

00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:26.039
and so I put up Appearance and
Reality.

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:26.869
Okay?
 

00:36:26.869 --> 00:36:29.135
I don't know if Harris's
sparrows analyze the problem

00:36:29.135 --> 00:36:31.489
philosophically in terms of
appearance and reality,

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:35.070
but they certainly react to
appearance and reality.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.586
So what Seivert did was he
experimentally treated

00:36:38.586 --> 00:36:41.268
subordinates,
either by painting them black,

00:36:41.268 --> 00:36:44.445
or by injecting testosterone,
or by painting them black and

00:36:44.445 --> 00:36:46.340
injecting them with
testosterone.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.800
So if you paint them black,
they look dominant;

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.061
they behave- they do not behave
dominant because they don't know

00:36:51.061 --> 00:36:53.650
they've been painted black,
and they don't have the

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.360
testosterone in their system.
 

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.070
Okay?
 

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:58.300
Do they rise in status?
 

00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.119
No.
 

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:02.110
If you inject them with
testosterone,

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.668
they behave like they're
dominant, but they don't have

00:37:05.668 --> 00:37:09.630
the signal that they're dominant
and they get beaten up,

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:13.949
they do not rise in status.
 

00:37:13.949 --> 00:37:17.514
Because basically what they're
doing is they're behaving in a

00:37:17.514 --> 00:37:20.782
very--according to bird
lore--they're behaving in a very

00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:22.090
deceptive fashion.
 

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.528
But if you do both things,
you paint them black and you

00:37:24.528 --> 00:37:27.376
inject them with testosterone,
then you do to them essentially

00:37:27.376 --> 00:37:29.784
what evolution and their
development has already done to

00:37:29.784 --> 00:37:31.704
them,
which is that the black is

00:37:31.704 --> 00:37:35.047
actually naturally expressed in
male individuals that have

00:37:35.047 --> 00:37:38.039
higher testosterone levels:
they look dominant,

00:37:38.039 --> 00:37:41.018
they behave dominant and they
rise in status.

00:37:41.018 --> 00:37:46.340
So this is a very interesting
observation right here.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.110
Okay?
 

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:54.809
Now that's one twist on
evolutionary game theory.

00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:58.239
It says that your perception of
your opponent,

00:37:58.239 --> 00:38:02.432
and your understanding of
whether he's trying to deceive

00:38:02.432 --> 00:38:05.329
you or not, is an important
thing.

00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:09.606
However, there is another
issue, and that is that it

00:38:09.606 --> 00:38:13.130
always pays to assess before
escalating.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.539
When I was in grad school we
had a Great Pyrenees,

00:38:16.539 --> 00:38:18.349
a great big dog,
Aikane.

00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:21.500
His head stood about this high;
he weighed about 130 pounds.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.315
And we were living in a suburb
of Vancouver,

00:38:24.315 --> 00:38:25.559
British Columbia.
 

00:38:25.559 --> 00:38:28.119
And I was out for a walk one
day with Aikane,

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:32.494
and a great big aggressive male
German Shepherd came around the

00:38:32.494 --> 00:38:35.706
corner,
about fifty feet away,

00:38:35.706 --> 00:38:39.786
and each dog went on alert,
ears went up,

00:38:39.786 --> 00:38:41.340
hair went up on the back.
 

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.150
They started barker ferociously
at each other.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.086
They rushed,
at high speed,

00:38:46.086 --> 00:38:47.280
at each other.
 

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.527
I was thinking,
"Oh my God,

00:38:48.527 --> 00:38:50.460
I'm going to have to pull a
fight apart."

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.065
They went by each other,
like ships in the night,

00:38:53.065 --> 00:38:56.376
went about fifty feet down the
road, and they both urinated on

00:38:56.376 --> 00:38:58.329
a post and trotted proudly away.
 

00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:01.320
They had managed to avoid
serious damage.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:07.110
Well that's what's going on
with Red Deer.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:11.777
If Red Deer get into a fight
where they are really about

00:39:11.777 --> 00:39:15.206
equally matched,
they can end up locking antlers

00:39:15.206 --> 00:39:18.605
in such a way that they can't
extricate themselves and they

00:39:18.605 --> 00:39:20.539
will actually starve to death.
 

00:39:20.539 --> 00:39:23.617
Also, if they are swinging
those nice pointed antlers

00:39:23.617 --> 00:39:26.219
around in a fight,
they can rip out the eye of an

00:39:26.219 --> 00:39:28.041
opponent,
they can get a wound that will

00:39:28.041 --> 00:39:29.782
be infected,
and they'll get bacterial

00:39:29.782 --> 00:39:31.309
sepsis and die from an
infection.

00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:33.599
So fights are dangerous.
 

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:36.099
But fights are the only way
they can get babies.

00:39:36.099 --> 00:39:42.760
So what they do is they first
do a lot of assessing.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.159
They approach each other and
they first roar.

00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:48.496
So if you're around moose in
the fall, or deer in the fall,

00:39:48.496 --> 00:39:51.659
you will hear roaring,
and that's what they're doing.

00:39:51.659 --> 00:39:57.952
Basically the ability of a male
deer to make sound is pretty

00:39:57.952 --> 00:40:04.032
directly proportional to how
good- what kind of shape he's

00:40:04.032 --> 00:40:04.780
in.
 

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.550
So if that sound is equally
impressive, then they get into a

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.980
thing where they do a parallel
walk;

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.518
they actually walk next to each
other, kind of sizing each other

00:40:14.518 --> 00:40:14.800
up.
 

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.005
And it turns out that if
they're very closely matched in

00:40:18.005 --> 00:40:21.619
size, these parallel walks can
go on for four or five hours.

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.652
They'll just be wandering all
over the landscape,

00:40:23.652 --> 00:40:25.559
trying to see who's going to
give up first.

00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:26.269
Okay?
 

00:40:26.269 --> 00:40:28.300
So that's the parallel walk.
 

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.489
And in a certain number of
cases one stag will say finally,

00:40:31.489 --> 00:40:32.969
"Well, looks like I'm
going to lose this one,

00:40:32.969 --> 00:40:34.159
it's not worth fighting."
 

00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:39.722
And then finally after doing
that parallel walk thing,

00:40:39.722 --> 00:40:44.445
if it's not resolved by then,
they will fight,

00:40:44.445 --> 00:40:48.960
and one will win and one will
withdraw.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:55.132
So the point of this is that
actual fights among animals are

00:40:55.132 --> 00:41:01.202
much more nuanced than the
simple Hawk-Dove game would ever

00:41:01.202 --> 00:41:03.400
have you believe.
 

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.601
And I think it's probably true,
throughout all sorts of

00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:10.480
tradeoffs in evolutionary
biology,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.440
that every time there is a
significant cost,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.670
there will be some modification
of behavior,

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:21.449
or some way of tweaking that
cost, that will arise,

00:41:21.449 --> 00:41:23.559
that will reduce the cost.
 

00:41:23.559 --> 00:41:25.119
So this is all cost reduction.
 

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.429
Okay?
 

00:41:26.429 --> 00:41:30.083
They need to get their mating,
but they're going to do it in a

00:41:30.083 --> 00:41:33.440
way that's not going to kill
them, if at all possible.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.961
And that's not in the simple
assumptions of any of the

00:41:37.961 --> 00:41:41.289
evolutionary games that I showed
you.

00:41:41.289 --> 00:41:43.467
So how solid are the
assumptions of this whole way of

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:44.429
looking at the world?
 

00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:47.182
Well it turns out that the
assumption is being made is that

00:41:47.182 --> 00:41:49.320
you've got a big randomly mixed
population.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.617
If you put in kin selection,
so that the opponents can be

00:41:52.617 --> 00:41:54.965
related to each other,
so that a brother might be

00:41:54.965 --> 00:41:57.603
fighting with a brother,
the analysis gets complicated,

00:41:57.603 --> 00:42:00.777
but the result's simple:
if you're related to the other

00:42:00.777 --> 00:42:02.130
player you're nicer.
 

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.250
That's not surprising.
 

00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:11.063
If you have repeated contests
and there's an opportunity to

00:42:11.063 --> 00:42:13.110
learn, the results will change.
 

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:13.949
Okay?
 

00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:17.293
If there's no learning,
then having the series of

00:42:17.293 --> 00:42:20.500
contests really doesn't make any
difference.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.882
So it is the ability to learn
and to remember that turns the

00:42:24.882 --> 00:42:29.635
repeated prisoner's dilemma into
a situation in which cooperation

00:42:29.635 --> 00:42:30.750
can evolve.
 

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:34.250
So you have to have some
cognitive capacity to do that.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.777
If the population is very
small, mutants might not be

00:42:37.777 --> 00:42:40.900
rare, and the basic model has to
be altered.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.233
It turns out that asexual
reproduction doesn't matter too

00:42:44.233 --> 00:42:44.650
much.
 

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:48.590
The sexual system--we usually
get to the ESS if the genetic

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.440
system will produce it;
you know, will allow it--is you

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:56.324
have more genes affecting a
trait, it becomes more likely

00:42:56.324 --> 00:42:59.099
that the population will hit the
ESS.

00:42:59.099 --> 00:43:01.360
If you have asymmetry in the
contest,

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.920
that will--as we've seen with
the bowl-and-doily spider,

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:09.789
and with the size of the
contest, size of body size,

00:43:09.789 --> 00:43:13.360
and with badge size in sparrows
and in deer--

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.670
that will change the outcome.
 

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.110
If you analyze pair-wise
contest versus playing against

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:22.592
the whole population,
it turns out in general a

00:43:22.592 --> 00:43:26.889
mutant really is playing against
the whole population.

00:43:26.889 --> 00:43:29.518
There you actually have to do
it on a computer usually;

00:43:29.518 --> 00:43:32.679
you can't--it's hard to analyze
analytically.

00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:36.679
But it doesn't make a huge
difference.

00:43:36.679 --> 00:43:38.530
Okay?
 

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:42.865
So the take-home points that I
want you to get from

00:43:42.865 --> 00:43:47.289
evolutionary game theory is that
this is a tool,

00:43:47.289 --> 00:43:51.041
it's an abstract tool,
and it is probably the tool of

00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:55.657
choice anytime you're looking at
frequency dependent evolution of

00:43:55.657 --> 00:43:56.739
phenotypes.
 

00:43:56.739 --> 00:44:00.050
It is very often good for your
mental health,

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.599
as an evolutionary biologist or
behaviorist,

00:44:02.599 --> 00:44:07.134
to test some property against
the invasion of all possible

00:44:07.134 --> 00:44:07.929
mutants.
 

00:44:07.929 --> 00:44:10.239
That's a very useful criterion.
 

00:44:10.239 --> 00:44:13.643
So, for example,
if you are thinking about those

00:44:13.643 --> 00:44:17.554
red grouse in Scotland who are
out in the fall in a big

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:20.260
assembly,
and somebody says, "Oh,

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.688
the reason that they do that is
so that next spring they won't

00:44:23.688 --> 00:44:25.150
reproduce so much."
 

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:28.059
And you ask yourself,
"What if a mutant crops up

00:44:28.059 --> 00:44:31.416
in that population that doesn't
think like that and it's just

00:44:31.416 --> 00:44:33.710
going to reproduce like
gangbusters,

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:36.400
no matter how dense the
population is?"

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.177
That little thought process
tells you the explanation that

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.889
was being given doesn't work,
because that selfish mutant

00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:44.949
will invade.
 

00:44:44.949 --> 00:44:47.119
Okay?
 

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:49.570
So it's a very useful criterion.
 

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:53.019
And I'd like to recommend Ben
Polak's course.

00:44:53.019 --> 00:44:54.210
Ben is a very good teacher.
 

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:55.929
Ben's gotten teaching awards.
 

00:44:55.929 --> 00:45:00.760
He teaches an Econ course on
game theory, and it will lead

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.880
you through this stuff.
 

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.027
And Ben is very good at
actually having you do homework

00:45:06.027 --> 00:45:08.300
assignments in which you solve
games;

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.880
which is more than this course
has time for.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.103
So if you want to get your head
around this, I recommend Ben's

00:45:14.103 --> 00:45:14.579
course.
 

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:17.230
And next time we're going to do
mating systems and parental

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.550
care.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.402
Prof: So we're spending
a couple classes these days

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:11.980
learning basic facts and
vocabulary about finance,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.143
and along the way we're trying
to apply the simple lessons that

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:20.039
Irving Fisher taught about
turning a financial problem into

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.069
a general equilibrium problem
and making use in particular of

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.480
the budget set.
 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.139
That very simple budget set we
wrote down at the very beginning

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:32.561
turns out to be quite useful and
people often can get quite

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:33.330
confused.
 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.346
So the last issue we ended
with, I'm going to take up

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:36.810
again.
 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.895
Suppose that you've got a very
long-lived institution like

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:42.520
Yale.
 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.370
How should Yale think of how
much to spend every year?

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.130
What is Yale's budget set?
 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.566
Almost every big institution
like Yale creates a fiction of

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:56.233
an annual budget and they talk
about the deficit and having to

00:00:56.233 --> 00:01:00.746
bring the deficit under control
and making cuts to close the

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:04.831
deficit gap,
but really there is no such

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.950
thing as a one-year budget set.
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.890
I mean, why one year?
 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.250
Why not one month?
 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.290
Why not one day?
 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.310
Nobody expects Yale to balance
its budget every day.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.968
Some expenditure comes in one
day.

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:18.290
They have to hire an
electrician to fix something

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.920
unexpected.
 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.507
They're going to spend more
money than they take in student

00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:25.010
tuition that day.
 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.837
So the fact that they're
supposed to budget the balance

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.459
every year is just a fiction.
 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.319
Irving Fisher taught us that
Yale really has--

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.434
if you can borrow and lend and
you don't have to worry about

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:37.810
risk there's one infinite-lived
budget set.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.434
It's an infinite horizon budget
set where you just take the

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.290
present value of all the
expenditures,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.811
that's the left hand side,
and the present value of all

00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:48.293
the revenue,
that's the right hand side,

00:01:48.293 --> 00:01:51.411
and make sure that the left
hand side is smaller than the

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:54.530
right hand side over the whole
course of Yale's life.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.709
So that simple principle has a
tremendous implication which was

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.390
overlooked, to the chagrin of
the last Yale president.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.739
So as I said,
the issue was in 1997,

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.139
I believe, it could have been
'96 something like that,

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.738
1997, Benno Schmidt,
who was then the Yale

00:02:12.738 --> 00:02:15.483
president,
released a white paper,

00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:18.625
he called it,
documenting the fact that Yale

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.699
had deferred maintenance in the
buildings,

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.312
he called it,
and a study that he

00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:26.562
commissioned,
a very good study that he

00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:29.327
commissioned,
argued that the deferred

00:02:29.327 --> 00:02:32.349
maintenance--
Yale could be brought up to

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.348
snuff and then go on afterwards
as a normal running institution

00:02:36.348 --> 00:02:40.410
provided it spent 100 million
dollars a year for ten years,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.538
and that included fixing every
college--

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:45.419
they're going to do more than
one a year over a 10 year

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:45.900
period.
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.160
So Yale's total budget,
as I told you,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.258
was about 1 billion dollars at
the time,

00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:55.043
and then here all of a sudden
was this 100 million dollar a

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:56.870
year expense for 10 years.
 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.720
That's 10 percent of the Yale
budget.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.560
And a lot of the costs you
can't change.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.500
You have to have the lights on.
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.610
You have to heat the buildings.
 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.870
You can't really reduce those
costs.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.258
So Benno Schmidt came to the
conclusion that he'd have to

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:12.706
reduce the costs he could change
by 15 percent in order to

00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:15.864
balance the budget,
to cut about 100 million

00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:18.280
dollars a year out of the
budget.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.992
So he announced one day that he
was going to fire 15 percent of

00:03:21.992 --> 00:03:23.610
the faculty by attrition.
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.068
If they were junior faculty he
wouldn't promote them,

00:03:26.068 --> 00:03:28.668
and if they were senior
faculty, wait until they retired

00:03:28.668 --> 00:03:29.848
and not replace them.
 

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:32.837
So this, needless to say,
caused a tremendous commotion

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.438
among the faculty,
and as I told you a committee

00:03:35.438 --> 00:03:38.038
was formed and I had to present
the report.

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:41.568
So actually the report went
pretty carefully through all the

00:03:41.568 --> 00:03:43.960
calculations made in the white
paper,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.545
but the heart of the report was
simply to apply the lesson of

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:49.770
Irving Fisher.
 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.419
So what is the lesson of Irving
Fisher?

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.776
Let's suppose that there's no
inflation so that when they say

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.246
100 million dollars a year they
mean 100 million real dollars a

00:03:58.246 --> 00:03:58.750
year.
 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.180
So Irving Fisher would say
Yale's going to live forever.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.102
Let's suppose that Yale wants
the same quality of education

00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:09.913
every year forever,
so it should have the same real

00:04:09.913 --> 00:04:13.735
spending every year forever
after it compensates for

00:04:13.735 --> 00:04:14.710
inflation.
 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.529
So at the moment we're assuming
there's no inflation.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.870
So what does that mean?
 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.382
That means that you just look
at the right hand side and you

00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:23.110
say, what's Yale's revenue?
 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.577
Well, whatever it was before we
were told by this report of the

00:04:26.577 --> 00:04:29.766
president that as long as you
did the deferred maintenance

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:31.670
Yale would be back in balance.
 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.879
So what's the loss of revenue
on the right hand side?

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.379
It's 10 years of 100 million
dollars a year as you can see.

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.079
Now, you need an interest rate.
 

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.930
What should the interest rate
be?

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.120
Well, should it be the nominal
interest rate or the real

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.050
interest rate?
 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.060
Well, we're supposing now
there's no inflation so it

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.839
should be the real interest rate
because all the hundreds have no

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:54.139
inflation in them.
 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.519
So what real interest rate
shall we use?

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:02.175
Well, the white paper used 5
percent because they thought

00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:07.728
that was the number that Yale
could earn after inflation

00:05:07.728 --> 00:05:10.860
pretty reliably every year.
 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.721
They think that's the real rate
of return Yale gets,

00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:17.600
and so they discounted it 5
percent.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.714
Now the real rate of interest
typically in the economy is 3

00:05:20.714 --> 00:05:24.259
percent, but let's suppose that
we calculated this at 5 percent.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.819
The present value of 100 for 10
years is 772.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.540
Now, how could you do that in
your head?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:46.023
Well, we know that 5 percent is
going to double every 14 years,

00:05:46.023 --> 00:05:51.629
5 into 72 is about 14.
 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:58.177
If it doubles every 14 years 10
years is going to be less than

00:05:58.177 --> 00:06:01.290
half the value of the bond.
 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.966
So if you got 100 forever at 5
percent interest that would be 2

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:07.160
billion,
and we know for only 10 years

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.567
it's less than half the value,
so considerably less than half

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:12.307
the value,
so it's not one billion it's

00:06:12.307 --> 00:06:13.290
something less than that.
 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.560
It's 772.
 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.759
So I just did that in Excel and
I calculated 772,

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.422
but in your head you know that
if it had gone on for 14 years

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:24.240
then the present value,
our formula,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.887
our famous formula is that you
would take the coupon 100

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:36.250
divided by the interest rate .05
times (1 - 1 over (1 R) to the

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.379
10th).
 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.860
And so we know that if this
were 14 instead of 10 you'd get

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.699
a half here.
 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.581
So this is 20 times 100 which
is 2 billion times 1 half would

00:06:44.581 --> 00:06:46.601
be 1 billion,
but since it's only 10 years

00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:48.569
and not 14 years it's less than
a billion,

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.129
so 772.
 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.165
So in your head you could have
probably figured that out

00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:55.339
approximately.
 

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:57.966
So you could be sitting there
in the audience hearing Benno

00:06:57.966 --> 00:07:00.684
Schmidt talk and be computing in
your head that we're talking

00:07:00.684 --> 00:07:04.300
about something under 1 billion,
like 3 quarters of 1 billion.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.879
So now, how much does that mean
reduction in every year?

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:12.391
Well, if Yale's going to spend
the same amount every year that

00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:17.050
means it should be spending 5
percent of 772 less every year.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.740
That's 38.6 million dollars
less every year.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.442
So that's a drastically smaller
number than 100 million dollars

00:07:24.442 --> 00:07:24.980
a year.
 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.814
It's crazy just to think that
because you've got these

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:31.290
expenditures for 10 years and
then no expenditures after that,

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.834
that you should cut the budget
by a 100 million and then let it

00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:36.149
go up after 10 years.
 

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:41.480
So you'd only need to cut it by
38 million.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.326
Now, by the way,
5 percent is a pretty arbitrary

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:43.680
number.
 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.829
Suppose you put 3 percent here?
 

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:50.490
Well, 3 percent would give you
a much higher present value,

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.612
but then when you multiply it
by 3 percent at the end for the

00:07:53.612 --> 00:07:56.629
annual reduction it will give
you a much smaller number.

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:02.149
Anyway, this number,
which I computed in Excel,

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.028
but again you can do it sort of
in your head,

00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:09.045
is 853 million,
but you multiply that by 3

00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:13.939
percent and you get 26 million a
year.

00:08:13.939 --> 00:08:16.992
So now the reduction is
starting to sound like it's not

00:08:16.992 --> 00:08:18.519
such a frightening thing.
 

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:23.180
So let's stick with the 5
percent which is what the white

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.216
paper,
take all the assumptions of the

00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:26.709
white paper and take it
literally,

00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:29.949
and then notice that they never
said anything about inflation.

00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:34.037
So actually,
this calculation of present

00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:40.220
value loss--there's inflation,
and say the inflation at that

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.259
time is around 4 percent.
 

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:46.023
In fact all the Yale contracts
that are still in place assume a

00:08:46.023 --> 00:08:48.918
4 percent inflation even though
inflation's less than that now.

00:08:48.918 --> 00:08:52.705
But anyway, so that 100 million
a year of dollars is actually

00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:56.428
less in present value terms
because what should you discount

00:08:56.428 --> 00:08:56.870
by?
 

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.220
If you look at the present
value of 100 million dollars

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.875
over 10 years and you take into
account its dollars you should

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.009
be discounting by the real
interest rate times the

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.486
inflation,
so by 9 percent,

00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:09.418
a tiny bit over 9 percent.
 

00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:17.309
So if you discount that by 9
percent you get 641 million as

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:21.798
the present value loss to Yale.
 

00:09:21.798 --> 00:09:27.071
Now, given that there's
inflation how much should you be

00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:29.178
spending every year?
 

00:09:29.178 --> 00:09:32.230
You should be spending in real
dollars, reducing your

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.519
expenditure how much in real
dollars?

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:39.529
Well, by 5 percent of the 641
million.

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:43.500
So if you have 641,
that's today's present value.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.009
There hasn't been any inflation
yet.

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:48.798
So that's the real loss in
dollars.

00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:53.283
So if you ask,
what's the real expenditure

00:09:53.283 --> 00:09:58.313
reduction every year,
it's 5 percent of 641 and

00:09:58.313 --> 00:10:00.720
that's 32 million.
 

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.914
So 32 million is a far smaller
number than 100 million and

00:10:06.914 --> 00:10:11.590
requires a far smaller drop in
expenses,

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.096
so our committee recommended
that we cut the faculty by 6

00:10:15.096 --> 00:10:17.350
percent instead of by 15
percent,

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.360
and 6 percent--there are a lot
of people leaving every year.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.340
You can do 6 percent pretty
quickly.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.476
So the upshot of this is that
it is a simple application of

00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:28.019
present value,
a very elementary calculation.

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:31.267
It came as somewhat of a
revelation to our

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:34.751
administrators,
I'm afraid, and the day after

00:10:34.751 --> 00:10:39.029
the report the provost of the
university resigned.

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:42.565
Two weeks later the dean of the
university resigned and two

00:10:42.565 --> 00:10:45.980
months later the president of
the university resigned.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.269
And Rick Levin,
the current president,

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:53.270
took over and he cut the
faculty by 6 percent,

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.850
but by no more than that.
 

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.506
And then, of course,
the finances of Yale got much

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:01.979
better and he's since added back
that 6 percent plus a little bit

00:11:01.979 --> 00:11:03.009
more than that.
 

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:05.522
So just to tell you,
though, something good about

00:11:05.522 --> 00:11:08.296
the Yale administration,
the provost who resigned that

00:11:08.296 --> 00:11:10.600
next day happens to be a friend
of mine.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.626
I've had dinner with him every
month for the last 12 years

00:11:15.626 --> 00:11:20.477
since this happened and he's
never once criticized me or

00:11:20.477 --> 00:11:25.857
shown the slightest discomfort
about the report that basically

00:11:25.857 --> 00:11:29.210
ended his administrative career.
 

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.091
He cares so much about Yale and
was so determined to do the

00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:34.029
right thing.
 

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:37.643
He just thought he made a
miscalculation and stepped

00:11:37.643 --> 00:11:38.210
aside.
 

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.931
So I believe that he wanted to
do the right thing for Yale and

00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:47.092
just made the wrong calculation,
not that he had some political

00:11:47.092 --> 00:11:50.000
agenda or something to cut such
a huge part of the faculty.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.721
So it's the most honest and
most Yale-loving administrator

00:11:56.721 --> 00:11:59.668
that you could imagine.
 

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:02.490
And I didn't know what the
reaction would be of someone

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.320
like him after giving the
report.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.528
I was quite terrified,
actually, that they'd be--

00:12:06.528 --> 00:12:08.590
they were still the president,
the provost and the dean,

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.590
that they would be quite angry
at our committee,

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:16.570
but they responded with
tremendous integrity.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.340
Yes?
 

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.326
Student: Why did you
multiply the present value by

00:12:20.326 --> 00:12:23.419
the interest rate to find the
&gt;?

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:24.139
Prof: You tell me.
 

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:26.240
Why did I do that?
 

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.830
So someone else tell me.
 

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:30.820
So that's a good question.
 

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.259
Why is that?
 

00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:32.850
Yes?
 

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.822
Student: It's like
finding the coupon of the

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:38.500
perpetuity with a 5 percent
interest rate,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.075
because it's like you're
rearranging C over r equals the

00:12:43.075 --> 00:12:46.284
present value,
so it'd make it present value

00:12:46.284 --> 00:12:48.389
times the interest rate equals
C.

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.788
Prof: Right.
 

00:12:48.788 --> 00:12:52.913
So the question was why,
after I figured out the present

00:12:52.913 --> 00:12:56.993
value loss like 772 million,
why did I multiply that by 5

00:12:56.993 --> 00:13:00.812
percent to figure out how much
Yale should reduce its spending

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:01.690
every year.
 

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.205
And the answer that was given
down here is that I'm assuming

00:13:05.205 --> 00:13:07.470
that Yale is going to go on
forever.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.687
So Yale can reduce its
expenditures every year forever

00:13:10.687 --> 00:13:14.389
and by doing that make up for
the same present value loss,

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:18.590
so forever means perpetually,
so it's a perpetuity.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.940
So how much do you have to
reduce--

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.065
what is the coupon reduction,
the expenditure reduction every

00:13:26.065 --> 00:13:29.982
year at 5 percent interest that
just makes a present value

00:13:29.982 --> 00:13:31.840
decline of 772 million?
 

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.190
Well, it's 5 percent of the
principal.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.493
If you have 772 million in the
bank and every year 5 percent of

00:13:38.493 --> 00:13:41.986
that you throw away,
you've thrown away the whole

00:13:41.986 --> 00:13:44.452
value,
at 5 percent interest,

00:13:44.452 --> 00:13:46.200
of the 772 million.
 

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.543
So by reducing your
expenditures by 5 percent every

00:13:50.543 --> 00:13:54.538
year you defray the 772 million
dollar loss.

00:13:54.538 --> 00:13:58.095
So the critical thing,
the critical mistake that the

00:13:58.095 --> 00:14:02.485
administration made is they had
a short run problem with a bunch

00:14:02.485 --> 00:14:05.884
of short run costs,
but Yale's going to live

00:14:05.884 --> 00:14:10.125
forever and Yale should share
the cost and the loss over all

00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:12.898
future generations,
not just make the current

00:14:12.898 --> 00:14:14.509
faculty, and the current
students,

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:20.808
and the current city bear all
the costs of this one shot loss,

00:14:20.808 --> 00:14:23.850
one shot problem that Yale
faced.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.274
So they weren't thinking in
Fisher's terms of taking the

00:14:27.274 --> 00:14:30.822
present value over the whole
course of the lifetime of the

00:14:30.822 --> 00:14:31.820
institution.
 

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.894
They were thinking,
well, we've got to spend 100

00:14:33.894 --> 00:14:36.500
million dollars this year we
better cut costs by 100 million

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.029
dollars.
 

00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:38.759
But that's obviously crazy.
 

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:42.441
Like suppose you had to spend
an extra 100,000 dollars in one

00:14:42.441 --> 00:14:42.808
day.
 

00:14:42.808 --> 00:14:46.904
Does that mean you should lay
off your faculty for one day so

00:14:46.904 --> 00:14:49.428
you can find the money to pay
that?

00:14:49.428 --> 00:14:52.633
And of course not,
so you have to spread the loss

00:14:52.633 --> 00:14:55.168
over the lifetime of the
university.

00:14:55.168 --> 00:14:58.190
Are there any other questions
about this principle?

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.048
Yes?
 

00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:02.424
Student: If you wanted
to return to say spending 100

00:15:02.424 --> 00:15:05.801
million dollars a year again
after 10 years would you spend

00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:09.467
77 million a year for those just
10 years if you wanted to incur

00:15:09.467 --> 00:15:12.320
the whole cost over a fixed
period of time?

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.288
Prof: If I wanted to
incur the whole cost over 10

00:15:15.288 --> 00:15:15.720
years?
 

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.178
Student: Yes.
 

00:15:16.178 --> 00:15:20.163
Prof: Then I would have
to reduce my expenditures by 100

00:15:20.163 --> 00:15:21.769
million dollars a year.
 

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:26.998
If at the end of 10 years I
wanted to be back even then I

00:15:26.998 --> 00:15:29.519
would have to spend less.
 

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:31.921
I would have to cut my
expenditures by exactly the

00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:33.928
money I was pouring into the
buildings.

00:15:33.928 --> 00:15:37.236
So if I wanted to reduce my
expenditures by an equal amount

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:40.429
every year it would have to be
100 million dollars for 10

00:15:40.429 --> 00:15:41.399
years, right?
 

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:47.361
If the maintenance costs go
over a 10-year period and I want

00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:51.808
the expenditures to go over a
10-year period,

00:15:51.808 --> 00:15:52.820
right?
 

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.227
So if I want the expenditures
to be reduced evenly over a

00:15:56.227 --> 00:15:59.820
10-year period I'd have to do
100 million dollars a year.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.302
If I wanted to eat away the
costs all in 1 year--I guess I

00:16:02.302 --> 00:16:03.870
didn't understand you're
question.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.764
You're saying if I wanted to
reduce expenditures entirely in

00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:11.328
1 year and then return next year
to my usual pattern of

00:16:11.328 --> 00:16:15.421
expenditure then I'd have to cut
the 1 billion dollar budget by

00:16:15.421 --> 00:16:16.610
772 million.
 

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.296
So that would involve basically
firing the whole faculty and

00:16:20.296 --> 00:16:24.169
saying take a year off you're on
furlough, sort of what they're

00:16:24.169 --> 00:16:25.669
doing in California.
 

00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:26.528
Yes?
 

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:29.639
Student: Can you also
spread the present value cost

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:32.803
evenly over 10 years and not
like 100 million dollars every

00:16:32.803 --> 00:16:35.182
year,
but 100 million in present

00:16:35.182 --> 00:16:36.100
value terms.
 

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.168
Prof: I could do that if
I wanted.

00:16:37.168 --> 00:16:40.558
I could rearrange the 100
million any way I wanted to.

00:16:40.558 --> 00:16:43.904
So you would cut less than 100
million dollars this year out of

00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:46.980
the budget and a little bit more
every year after that?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.315
Student: Assuming you
wanted to get these costs over

00:16:50.315 --> 00:16:52.038
with in a 10-year timeframe.
 

00:16:52.038 --> 00:16:54.635
Prof: Well,
one way to do the costs over

00:16:54.635 --> 00:16:57.288
with in a 10-year timeframe is
reduce costs,

00:16:57.288 --> 00:17:00.573
reduce paying the faculty by
100 million dollars every year

00:17:00.573 --> 00:17:01.870
for 10 years,
right?

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.405
That would obviously do it,
because that's the money I need

00:17:04.405 --> 00:17:04.798
to get.
 

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:07.545
You could now rearrange that by
reducing costs a little less at

00:17:07.545 --> 00:17:10.288
the beginning and a little more
at the end of the 10 years,

00:17:10.288 --> 00:17:13.210
but I would say that doesn't
sound--

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:14.058
why do that?
 

00:17:14.058 --> 00:17:17.920
That's kind of what bad
politicians do.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.950
They say, "It's not our
fault.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.227
We'll just make those guys in
year 10 get totally

00:17:24.227 --> 00:17:27.026
crushed,"
and pretty soon they are in

00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:31.670
year 10 and then they've got 200
million they have to cut costs.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.680
Yes?
 

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.016
Student: So say in 25
years Yale wants to do another

00:17:36.016 --> 00:17:39.238
round of rebuilding all of the
buildings they'll still be

00:17:39.238 --> 00:17:42.690
paying for the buildings that
they built 25 years prior?

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.049
Prof: Right.
 

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:44.538
So there's a good question.
 

00:17:44.538 --> 00:17:48.608
So actually some people,
the administration,

00:17:48.608 --> 00:17:50.769
that was their best response,
they said,

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.859
"Well even though the
white paper said this was a one

00:17:53.859 --> 00:17:57.054
shot thing,
and after we do this 10 year

00:17:57.054 --> 00:18:01.901
plan Yale is back in good shape,
and of course every year Yale

00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:04.118
has allowed maintenance
expenses.

00:18:04.118 --> 00:18:05.778
That's part of the budget is
maintenance.

00:18:05.778 --> 00:18:08.973
So after we get the buildings
back in tip top shape we're

00:18:08.973 --> 00:18:12.169
going to keep them in tip top
shape by doing these normal

00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:15.648
expenditures every year so we
should never have another period

00:18:15.648 --> 00:18:19.130
where you have to do something
drastic like that."

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.244
That's what the white paper
said, but after the report they

00:18:22.244 --> 00:18:23.910
responded just like you said.
 

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.019
They said, "Well,
we didn't really mean that.

00:18:26.019 --> 00:18:30.009
Maybe in 25 years we're going
to have to do another remodeling

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:30.990
effort."
 

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.040
And so well,
if you need to that then it

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.640
wasn't just a one-time deferred
maintenance.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.913
It means that you've
drastically underestimated the

00:18:40.913 --> 00:18:44.910
cost of keeping up the buildings
over Yale's whole future,

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.523
so then you would have these
reductions in expenditures for

00:18:49.523 --> 00:18:54.376
the first 10 years and then in
year 35 you'd have to have more

00:18:54.376 --> 00:18:57.164
reductions,
and then in year 70 you'd have

00:18:57.164 --> 00:18:58.529
more reductions like that.
 

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:01.731
So you have to take the present
value of all those things and

00:19:01.731 --> 00:19:04.773
then figure out how much to
reduce expenditures on an even

00:19:04.773 --> 00:19:07.710
basis and so it would be much
more than 32 million.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.818
It would be 60 or something
million or 50 million.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.616
So you're exactly right,
but that's not what they said

00:19:13.616 --> 00:19:14.328
in the white paper.
 

00:19:14.328 --> 00:19:20.230
So I took them literally what
they meant.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.390
So what happened after that?
 

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.642
Yale has done much more
building expenditures than that,

00:19:24.642 --> 00:19:28.190
but that's because Yale's
endowment went up to 23 billion.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.344
So from 3 billion which it was
at the time it's now 23 billion

00:19:31.344 --> 00:19:33.980
so Yale's launched an incredible
program of building

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:34.858
construction.
 

00:19:34.858 --> 00:19:36.108
Basically they've done two
things.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:40.665
They've built a huge number of
construction jobs and they've

00:19:40.665 --> 00:19:43.910
hired a lot of administrators
and stuff.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.990
So the faculty is still not
that much bigger.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.578
It went down 6 percent.
 

00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:51.910
It's now back a little bigger
than it was before.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.244
So the plan to expand the
college and expand the faculty

00:19:55.244 --> 00:19:56.578
hasn't happened yet.
 

00:19:56.578 --> 00:19:59.538
So Yale faces another choice
now.

00:19:59.538 --> 00:20:03.780
You know the endowment went to
23 billion and then this past

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.943
year they managed to lose down
to 17 billion,

00:20:06.943 --> 00:20:08.670
30 percent got lost.
 

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.190
So we're down to 17 billion now.
 

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.500
So again we have the same
question.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.048
We just lost 6 billion dollars.
 

00:20:14.048 --> 00:20:20.630
How much should we reduce
expenditures every year?

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.798
So what's your answer to that?
 

00:20:23.798 --> 00:20:28.339
Student: About 30
percent?

00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:32.490
Prof: Not 30 percent.
 

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:36.539
So how much would you reduce
expenditures?

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.009
Why wouldn't it be 30 percent?
 

00:20:38.009 --> 00:20:41.182
Because Yale spends a lot of
money it doesn't get from the

00:20:41.182 --> 00:20:42.240
endowment, right?
 

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.619
It gets money from tuition,
for example.

00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:48.368
So what should Yale do?
 

00:20:48.368 --> 00:20:50.707
What do you think Yale's going
to have to take out of the

00:20:50.707 --> 00:20:51.250
budget now?
 

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.271
Student:
&gt;

00:20:56.271 --> 00:20:58.029
calculation.
 

00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:59.953
Prof: Yeah,
and let's say it's still 5

00:20:59.953 --> 00:21:02.009
percent real interest then what
would you do?

00:21:02.009 --> 00:21:07.266
Student: Present value's
6 billion dollars and we assume

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.808
we're at 5 percent interest.
 

00:21:09.808 --> 00:21:10.440
Prof: Yeah,
so what's that?

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.798
Student: 6 over .05?
 

00:21:12.798 --> 00:21:17.328
Prof: 6 times .05,
so what's that?

00:21:17.328 --> 00:21:20.089
Hard to do these things in your
head, right, but what is it?

00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:21.849
Student: 300 million.
 

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:25.430
Prof: 300 million,
so Yale's got to somehow cut

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:30.214
300 million out of its budget so
it's not going to do it in one

00:21:30.214 --> 00:21:32.153
year,
but over the course of the next

00:21:32.153 --> 00:21:34.118
few years it's going to have to
cut 300 million.

00:21:34.118 --> 00:21:37.883
Now the budget is well over 2
billion so that's 15 percent of

00:21:37.883 --> 00:21:41.019
the budget, though,
Yale's going to have to cut.

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:42.140
So this is a serious thing.
 

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.509
How do you cut 15 percent of
the Yale budget?

00:21:45.509 --> 00:21:46.640
Student: Firing faculty.
 

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.959
Prof: Firing faculty,
well, I hope they don't do

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:49.259
that.
 

00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:54.291
I think they learned their
lesson so I doubt if they'll do

00:21:54.291 --> 00:21:54.910
that.
 

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.269
Things are already changing.
 

00:21:56.269 --> 00:22:00.592
They're charging for long
distance telephone calls and all

00:22:00.592 --> 00:22:02.640
kinds of stuff like that.
 

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.942
That doesn't get you quite 300
million, but there's going to be

00:22:04.942 --> 00:22:06.019
a bunch of stuff like that.
 

00:22:06.019 --> 00:22:07.605
So anyway, we have another
budget problem,

00:22:07.605 --> 00:22:08.108
by the way.
 

00:22:08.108 --> 00:22:10.477
So these kinds of budget
problems are happening all over

00:22:10.477 --> 00:22:11.078
the country.
 

00:22:11.078 --> 00:22:15.267
I gave a talk at Albany
University and they're going to

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:19.608
abolish their graduate economics
program, SUNY Albany.

00:22:19.608 --> 00:22:23.640
These are serious problems
losing that much money.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.670
But in any case 6 billion
translates to,

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.702
right, the difference here is 6
billion and you multiply that by

00:22:30.702 --> 00:22:34.348
.05 just as we said and that
equals 300 million a year.

00:22:34.348 --> 00:22:38.111
So Yale won't do it right away,
but over the course of a few

00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:41.490
years Yale's going to have to
reduce its budget by 300

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.234
million,
so they're going to obviously

00:22:44.234 --> 00:22:48.330
choose to do a lot less building
and presumably some of the new

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.700
people that got hired they're
going to not keep.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.369
So any other questions?
 

00:22:54.369 --> 00:22:54.900
Yep?
 

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.924
Student: Doesn't that
presume that the endowment stays

00:22:57.924 --> 00:22:58.480
that way?
 

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.048
Prof: Yes.
 

00:23:00.048 --> 00:23:03.718
Student: Could you also,
once the stock market and the

00:23:03.718 --> 00:23:07.450
real estate goes back up,
can you have some assumption

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.118
that they don't need to cut as
much?

00:23:10.118 --> 00:23:11.690
Prof: Right,
very good question.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.575
So in the front he's saying
this presumes that we know for

00:23:15.575 --> 00:23:18.369
sure that the endowment lost 6
billion.

00:23:18.369 --> 00:23:20.118
It'll never recover it.
 

00:23:20.118 --> 00:23:23.778
Maybe that's a temporary drop
in the stock market and it'll go

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:26.048
back up,
and basically the principle

00:23:26.048 --> 00:23:29.384
he's applying is he's saying you
can't make these drastic

00:23:29.384 --> 00:23:31.650
reductions in annual
expenditures,

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.211
firing people and then two
years later realizing you've got

00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:36.817
a lot of money trying to hire
them back because you won't be

00:23:36.817 --> 00:23:38.009
able to hire them back.
 

00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:41.374
So clearly Yale has to have a
more complicated rule about how

00:23:41.374 --> 00:23:44.402
it gradually adjusts its
spending when there's a change

00:23:44.402 --> 00:23:45.578
in the endowment.
 

00:23:45.578 --> 00:23:47.503
And so we're going to talk
about that later because it

00:23:47.503 --> 00:23:49.609
involves uncertainty and how to
think about uncertainty.

00:23:49.609 --> 00:23:52.950
But you're absolutely right.
 

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:56.210
So Levin did not announce a 300
million dollar reduction

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.098
immediately,
but he announced a big

00:23:58.098 --> 00:24:00.622
reduction immediately,
and you're going to expect next

00:24:00.622 --> 00:24:03.579
year if the stock market doesn't
drastically improve for there to

00:24:03.579 --> 00:24:04.690
be another reduction.
 

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.356
And, by the way,
this number could go down as

00:24:07.356 --> 00:24:08.630
well as it goes up.
 

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.732
So we're going to come back to
Yale's investments and what

00:24:11.732 --> 00:24:12.548
they're like.
 

00:24:12.548 --> 00:24:15.105
A lot of Yale's investments are
called private equity

00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:17.170
investments that are very hard
to value.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.535
So for all we know this 17 is a
lot worse than that,

00:24:20.535 --> 00:24:23.900
but we'll be finding out in the
next year or two.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.401
It's not like a hedge fund
where you have to value all your

00:24:27.401 --> 00:24:30.480
assets by what the market will
be willing to pay.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.547
A lot of these assets there is
no market so they just sort of

00:24:33.547 --> 00:24:35.029
make up what the number is.
 

00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:37.710
Anyway, we're going to come
back and discuss this.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.990
It's a very interesting
question.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.920
So one last thing about this
present value calculation,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.221
one last obvious thing,
it's hard to keep in your mind

00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:52.630
the difference between real and
nominal.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.509
So let's just do a very simple
thing.

00:24:55.509 --> 00:25:03.490
The mortgage,
mortgages are traditionally

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:08.480
nominal fixed payments.
 

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:16.718
So for example,
a 100,000 dollar 30 year

00:25:16.718 --> 00:25:28.970
mortgage at 2.3 percent is about
4,600 dollars per year.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.190
How did I do that so quickly in
my head?

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:35.221
Well, because I know if the
interest rate is 2.3 percent and

00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:39.048
you're going to pay it forever
you'd pay 2,300 a year.

00:25:39.048 --> 00:25:43.125
We know at 30 years at 2.3
percent, 2.3 percent doubles

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:44.710
almost in 30 years.
 

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.318
That's 69.
 

00:25:46.318 --> 00:25:49.016
That's getting pretty close to
72, so maybe it takes 31 years

00:25:49.016 --> 00:25:50.140
or something to double.
 

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:58.420
So after 30 years the remainder
is worth half the mortgage.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.313
So you've lost half of the
value by only getting it for 30

00:26:01.313 --> 00:26:01.720
years.
 

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.798
So instead of paying 2,300 you
have to pay 4,600.

00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:12.586
So the coupon over .023 times
(1 - 1 over 1.023 to the

00:26:12.586 --> 00:26:17.140
thirtieth),
that's 1 - 1 half about,

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:23.463
so if this coupon equals
100,000 the payment is going to

00:26:23.463 --> 00:26:25.906
be--
since this is 1 half the

00:26:25.906 --> 00:26:28.160
payment isn't going to be 2,300.
 

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.500
It has to be twice that, 4,600.
 

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.940
So it's 4,600 per year.
 

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.590
So if there's no inflation that
means you're making the same

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.759
real payment every year.
 

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:38.759
Now what happens if there's
inflation?

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:47.308
What if inflation goes up?
 

00:26:47.308 --> 00:26:54.799
Now what's going to happen to
what you have to pay?

00:26:54.799 --> 00:27:00.130
How would you figure that out?
 

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:04.578
Well, if inflation is another
2.3 percent or something,

00:27:04.578 --> 00:27:10.874
then the nominal interest rate
1 i is going to equal the real

00:27:10.874 --> 00:27:15.490
interest rate times the rate of
inflation.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:19.794
So let's say this is 1.023 and
this is also 1.023,

00:27:19.794 --> 00:27:23.570
so that's 1.046,
a little bit more than 4 6,

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.910
almost a little bit more than 4
6.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:31.703
So you know that the interest
rate the mortgage companies are

00:27:31.703 --> 00:27:35.140
now going to charge is going to
be 1.046.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.799
So the 4.6 is going to be the
mortgage interest rate and so

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:46.557
you can figure out by the same
calculation what the coupon's

00:27:46.557 --> 00:27:48.118
going to be.
 

00:27:48.118 --> 00:27:52.358
So what's the coupon going to
be?

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:56.835
Well, instead of doubling every
30 years at 4.6 percent it's

00:27:56.835 --> 00:28:00.400
going to double approximately
every 15 years.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.509
So this is going to be doubling
twice.

00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:06.930
This is 1 quarter,
so this'll be 3 quarters here.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:19.842
And so if you multiply
everything, 2,300 a year times 4

00:28:19.842 --> 00:28:31.318
thirds--am I doing the right
calculation here?

00:28:31.318 --> 00:28:39.019
I'm telling you it's so easy to
compute in your head and

00:28:39.019 --> 00:28:40.700
meanwhile.
 

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.936
Oh, I forgot to change this to
4 6, so the interest rate is 4

00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:45.220
6.
 

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:54.288
So this to the other side is
4,600 times 4 thirds and that's

00:28:54.288 --> 00:28:56.440
6,000 about.
 

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:02.397
So the annual payment is going
to go up to 6,000 instead of

00:29:02.397 --> 00:29:03.220
4,600.
 

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.880
It was 4,600.
 

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.690
The interest rate went up
because there was inflation,

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.415
so of course they're going to
ask you for more money every

00:29:11.415 --> 00:29:14.554
year,
because if you pay the same

00:29:14.554 --> 00:29:19.298
amount every year and this is
the real payment--

00:29:19.298 --> 00:29:22.443
if you make the same amount and
this is time in terms of

00:29:22.443 --> 00:29:25.531
inflation corrected dollars
you're paying less and less

00:29:25.531 --> 00:29:26.390
every year.
 

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.953
So clearly if you started with
no inflation and a number like

00:29:29.953 --> 00:29:33.480
this,
so no inflation and now you've

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.358
got inflation but the same real
interest rate,

00:29:38.358 --> 00:29:40.660
and the present value of your
expenditures,

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.417
the real present value,
right--the mortgage company's

00:29:43.417 --> 00:29:45.895
going to want,
the lender's going to want to

00:29:45.895 --> 00:29:49.265
get the same amount back in real
terms as it got before because

00:29:49.265 --> 00:29:51.818
the inflation hasn't changed the
real world.

00:29:51.818 --> 00:29:55.368
So Irving Fisher would say the
inflation is just a veil.

00:29:55.368 --> 00:29:58.236
Everybody's going to want the
same real interest rate and so

00:29:58.236 --> 00:30:01.201
the mortgage is going to have to
return the same real thing it

00:30:01.201 --> 00:30:01.930
did before.
 

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.513
The present value in real
terms, or the real payments is

00:30:04.513 --> 00:30:05.828
still going to be 100,000.
 

00:30:05.828 --> 00:30:08.903
So if the real payments go down
over time and have the same

00:30:08.903 --> 00:30:11.871
present value they had before
it's got to be that they're

00:30:11.871 --> 00:30:15.210
higher at the beginning and in
real terms lower at the end.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:21.555
So sure enough 6,000 is a much
higher number at the beginning

00:30:21.555 --> 00:30:22.930
than 4,600.
 

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.482
So of course when inflation
went up and everybody knows it's

00:30:26.482 --> 00:30:30.036
up the mortgage companies are
going to ask for higher annual

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:33.710
payments so it'd be 6,000 a year
instead of 4,600 a year.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.230
But now if you inflation
correct that,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.430
the 6,000 every year is going
to be less,

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.608
in terms of real goods,
less and less every year,

00:30:41.608 --> 00:30:44.486
but the present discounted
value of this thing has to be

00:30:44.486 --> 00:30:46.160
the same as where you started.
 

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.238
So the effect is the young
borrowers are going to be

00:30:49.238 --> 00:30:52.679
spending a lot more in real
goods when they're young and a

00:30:52.679 --> 00:30:54.490
lot less when they're old.
 

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:58.950
So inflation has an unfortunate
impact on mortgages quoted in

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:03.558
nominal dollars that it makes
the repayments happen earlier.

00:31:03.558 --> 00:31:06.402
So the young who have less
money are having to pay a huge

00:31:06.402 --> 00:31:08.198
amount,
and when they get old the

00:31:08.198 --> 00:31:10.773
inflation's so high that that
same 6,000 dollars is

00:31:10.773 --> 00:31:11.960
practically nothing.
 

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.804
So when they're 50 and 60
they're paying

00:31:13.804 --> 00:31:16.688
practically--they're peanuts to
them, but when they were young

00:31:16.688 --> 00:31:18.058
it was really a hardship.
 

00:31:18.058 --> 00:31:20.759
So there's a big problem with
nominal mortgages,

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:23.917
which is that in inflationary
times it kills the housing

00:31:23.917 --> 00:31:24.548
market.
 

00:31:24.548 --> 00:31:28.450
Fortunately we're not in
inflationary times.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.160
Any questions about that?
 

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.334
All right, so that's the basic
lesson of taking the present

00:31:35.334 --> 00:31:35.910
value.
 

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:39.385
And again, you've always got to
sort out the nominal from the

00:31:39.385 --> 00:31:41.105
real,
and look though the veil,

00:31:41.105 --> 00:31:44.269
and don't get all mixed up by
the fact that there's inflation.

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:47.618
It's the real thing that you
want to concentrate on as much

00:31:47.618 --> 00:31:48.368
as you can.
 

00:31:48.368 --> 00:31:51.720
So that's it for the obvious
lesson of present value.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.191
Now I want to introduce another
word which is very famous in

00:31:55.191 --> 00:31:55.779
finance.
 

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:58.430
It's called the yield or yield
to maturity.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.509
And I'm going to do it,
unlike the way I've presented

00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:05.883
in the notes,
I'm going to do it in terms of

00:32:05.883 --> 00:32:09.098
a hedge fund,
so if you can see this?

00:32:09.098 --> 00:32:14.769
So yield, the next topic,
or yield to maturity is a way

00:32:14.769 --> 00:32:21.278
of trying to compute one number
that summarizes how good a bond

00:32:21.278 --> 00:32:23.119
is,
or how good,

00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:25.788
how well a hedge fund has done.
 

00:32:25.788 --> 00:32:30.432
So I think the more interesting
case, and the less obvious one,

00:32:30.432 --> 00:32:32.828
is to start with a hedge fund.
 

00:32:32.828 --> 00:32:36.121
How do you measure how well a
hedge fund's doing or how well

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:37.460
it's done in the past?
 

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.558
Yeah, how well it's done in the
past.

00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:43.355
We're going to spend a lot of
the course talking about this in

00:32:43.355 --> 00:32:45.780
various ways,
but the first way to do it

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.710
involves yield to maturity.
 

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.348
So let's see why the problem is
a little complicated.

00:32:51.348 --> 00:32:54.531
So I imagine that there are
three investors in this hedge

00:32:54.531 --> 00:32:54.930
fund.
 

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.603
So every year some of the
investors are going to decide

00:32:58.603 --> 00:33:02.548
what to do, and they're going to
decide whether to withdraw

00:33:02.548 --> 00:33:03.230
money.
 

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.308
Here's investor one.
 

00:33:04.308 --> 00:33:05.759
Maybe he's going to withdraw
money.

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:07.068
The hedge fund's just beginning.
 

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:09.058
He's going to put in 100
dollars.

00:33:09.058 --> 00:33:11.420
The other two guys haven't done
anything.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:16.490
So now the hedge fund before
this guy put in his money had

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:17.380
nothing.
 

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.390
It's just beginning.
 

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:22.307
He's put in his 100 dollars,
so the hedge fund's got 100

00:33:22.307 --> 00:33:23.019
dollars.
 

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:24.230
So that's it.
 

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:27.180
So I'm imagining these all
happen, they usually happen

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.240
quarterly or annually or
something.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.548
They don't happen every day.
 

00:33:30.548 --> 00:33:33.130
There's a fixed moment at which
everyone deposits their money.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.160
So let's say they happen
annually.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.078
The guy puts in 100 dollars at
the beginning of the year.

00:33:38.078 --> 00:33:39.970
For the rest of the year nobody
can do anything.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:41.089
They can't take money out.
 

00:33:41.089 --> 00:33:42.630
They can't put money in.
 

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.874
So the hedge fund,
let's say, manages to put the

00:33:46.874 --> 00:33:51.480
100 dollars to work and finds a
7 percent return.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.678
So it's now got,
the hedge fund all together has

00:33:56.678 --> 00:33:58.670
got 107 dollars.
 

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:03.558
So let's just go to the hedge
fund all together.

00:34:03.558 --> 00:34:08.096
The hedge fund had 100 after
these guys, because only one guy

00:34:08.096 --> 00:34:12.329
put in money and now the hedge
fund's got 107 dollars.

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:14.889
Well, that 107 dollars is all
the first guy's money,

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.000
because nobody else has put
anything in.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.210
He still owns it.
 

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.670
So, so far the hedge fund got a
7 percent return.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:25.219
Well, now the next year,
we're now at the beginning of

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.121
year 2,
our first investor thinks to

00:34:28.121 --> 00:34:30.010
himself,
"Well, they did fine,

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.929
7 percent, not great,
but I'm okay.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.695
I'm not going to do anything,
won't take any money out or put

00:34:36.695 --> 00:34:37.110
any in.
 

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:42.518
A rich second investor puts in
1,000 and another guy puts in

00:34:42.518 --> 00:34:43.070
200.
 

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:48.309
So now what's happened to the
NAV of the fund?

00:34:48.309 --> 00:34:52.864
Well, the first guy,
at the moment they put in the

00:34:52.864 --> 00:34:57.789
money, the first guy still owns
107 of the dollars.

00:34:57.789 --> 00:35:03.251
The second guy's now got 1,000
in the fund and the third guy's

00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:08.264
got 200 in the fund and the
hedge fund now has 1,200 plus

00:35:08.264 --> 00:35:09.340
the 107.
 

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.380
That's 1,307.
 

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.139
That's how much money is in the
fund.

00:35:12.139 --> 00:35:15.458
So that's at the beginning of
year 2 if you're still following

00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:15.840
this.
 

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.570
If you're not following it
interrupt me.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.250
Sorry.
 

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:23.170
So what happens in the
beginning of the next year,

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.972
year 3, well let's say our
guy--so the hedge fund makes

00:35:27.972 --> 00:35:31.619
money and this time it made 3
percent,

00:35:31.619 --> 00:35:34.500
a crappier, sorry,
a less good return,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.630
only 3 percent.
 

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.119
God, it's on film.
 

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.949
I'm glad that's going to live
for posterity.

00:35:38.949 --> 00:35:44.929
Only a 3 percent return,
and so the hedge fund which

00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:52.081
ended the year at 1,307 now by
the next of this next year it's

00:35:52.081 --> 00:35:57.710
made 3 percent on that so it's
up to 1,346,

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:03.929
so 39 dollars,
3 percent on 1,300 so 1,346.

00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:06.139
Now of that who's got the money?
 

00:36:06.139 --> 00:36:13.530
Well, our original guy he's now
made--everyone made 3 percent so

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:16.579
his 107 turned into 110.
 

00:36:16.579 --> 00:36:19.230
The second guy's got 1,030 in
the fund,

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.856
and the third guy's got 206 in
the fund and the total fund is

00:36:24.856 --> 00:36:28.170
1,346,
Now let's suppose that our guy,

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.880
this is the beginning of year
3,

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.670
our first guy says,
"3 percent,

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.360
that's a terrible return.
 

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.760
I'm taking my money out.
 

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.679
I've had it.
 

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:38.369
It's 110 dollars.
 

00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:39.349
That's what I have.
 

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:42.340
I'm taking it out,"
and no one else does anything.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.422
So at the end of the year now
he's down to zero and everybody

00:36:45.422 --> 00:36:48.659
else is where they were and the
hedge fund thing has gone down a

00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:49.429
little bit.
 

00:36:49.429 --> 00:36:51.809
Well now next year the thing
does even worse.

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.909
It makes a 0 percent return.
 

00:36:53.909 --> 00:36:57.789
So everybody's money is just
the same except that the second

00:36:57.789 --> 00:37:01.536
guy decides this is really
getting lousy and he takes half

00:37:01.536 --> 00:37:02.719
his money out.
 

00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:04.349
So this is taking half his
money out.

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:05.619
What was his money?
 

00:37:05.619 --> 00:37:09.420
He was 1,112 and half of that
is 556.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.275
So he takes half of it out
leaving half behind,

00:37:12.275 --> 00:37:15.751
and the column on the right
reduces what the hedge fund's

00:37:15.751 --> 00:37:16.869
total cash is.
 

00:37:16.869 --> 00:37:20.657
But now the hedge fund has a
great year and it makes 50

00:37:20.657 --> 00:37:21.360
percent.
 

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:35.202
Having made 50 percent--sorry,
so this guy takes half his

00:37:35.202 --> 00:37:38.170
money out.
 

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:41.701
At the beginning of the year
the fund does badly then the

00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:43.719
fund--I skipped the 8 percent.
 

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:45.909
There was an 8 percent return,
sorry.

00:37:45.909 --> 00:37:47.179
Oh, what an idiot.
 

00:37:47.179 --> 00:37:51.679
Anyway, so the next year the
fund returned not 0 percent it

00:37:51.679 --> 00:37:53.309
returned 8 percent.
 

00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:56.726
So the first guy after the 3
percent return this guy took his

00:37:56.726 --> 00:37:57.409
money out.
 

00:37:57.409 --> 00:38:00.889
The other guys left it in and
then the fund had an 8 percent

00:38:00.889 --> 00:38:01.420
return.
 

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.829
So it's a little bit better,
but this guy decides to take

00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:06.110
half his money out.
 

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:11.034
Then the fund has a 0 percent
return and after that this guy

00:38:11.034 --> 00:38:15.001
decides to take his money out,
half his money out,

00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:18.637
but then finally the last year
the fund gives a 50 percent

00:38:18.637 --> 00:38:20.797
return,
which is fantastic,

00:38:20.797 --> 00:38:22.639
so everybody does well.
 

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:25.880
And now let's say they all
decide to take their money out.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.795
So now there's nothing left in
the fund, and they withdrew the

00:38:31.795 --> 00:38:32.960
total 934.
 

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.126
So what I've done here,
just to summarize it,

00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:37.788
is every year people are
putting in money or taking out

00:38:37.788 --> 00:38:39.710
money at the beginning of the
year.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.793
You can never take out more
than you have or you can put

00:38:41.793 --> 00:38:42.210
money in.
 

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.409
The fund earns returns over the
whole year and then people,

00:38:45.409 --> 00:38:48.081
again, decide to take money out
or put money in and then the

00:38:48.081 --> 00:38:50.210
fund earns a different return
the next year,

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:53.637
and eventually the fund returns
all the money or people withdraw

00:38:53.637 --> 00:38:54.289
the money.
 

00:38:54.289 --> 00:38:58.480
So the question is how has the
fund done?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.103
How would you summarize in one
number how the fund has done

00:39:03.103 --> 00:39:05.972
over its 1,2,
3,4, 5 years of earning

00:39:05.972 --> 00:39:06.929
returns?
 

00:39:06.929 --> 00:39:08.389
That's the question.
 

00:39:08.389 --> 00:39:14.322
So this is a standard--this is
obviously what happens every day

00:39:14.322 --> 00:39:16.139
with hedge funds.
 

00:39:16.139 --> 00:39:20.190
So how do hedge funds report
how they've done historically?

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.460
So do you have any suggestions?
 

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.210
What would you do to summarize
how the hedge fund has done?

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:32.949
If you had to pick one number
what would it be?

00:39:32.949 --> 00:39:36.750
How good an investor is the
fund?

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:37.699
Yeah?
 

00:39:37.699 --> 00:39:38.860
Student: Just multiply
the return.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.980
Take a geometric average.
 

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.934
Prof: So one thing you
could do is you could say--he

00:39:45.934 --> 00:39:49.949
said literally multiply all of
these returns.

00:39:49.949 --> 00:39:50.989
What does that mean?
 

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:54.018
That means if you put 1 dollar
in the fund at the beginning

00:39:54.018 --> 00:39:55.219
you'd earn 7 percent.
 

00:39:55.219 --> 00:39:57.938
If you left it there and never
took it out you get another 3

00:39:57.938 --> 00:39:58.400
percent.
 

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.376
Then you'd get 8 percent on top
of that, then 0 percent,

00:40:01.376 --> 00:40:02.349
then 50 percent.
 

00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:05.400
Of course this is a
multiplicative thing,

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.978
so he says you'd get 1.07 times
1.03 times 1.08 times 1 times

00:40:09.978 --> 00:40:10.590
1.5.
 

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.570
Multiplying all that would give
you the number of dollars you'd

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.599
have at the end of 5 years given
that you put 1 dollar in at the

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:18.329
beginning and never took it out.
 

00:40:18.329 --> 00:40:22.268
And if you wanted to annualize
that he said take the geometric

00:40:22.268 --> 00:40:24.480
average,
the fifth root of that and

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.882
that's the constant rate of
return that would have given you

00:40:27.882 --> 00:40:31.518
the same amount of money at the
end that you would get by having

00:40:31.518 --> 00:40:35.094
left 1 dollar from the beginning
in the fund all the way to the

00:40:35.094 --> 00:40:35.730
end.
 

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.119
Is that clear to everybody?
 

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:39.510
That seems like a logical thing
to do.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.969
That's what money hedge funds
do do, in fact.

00:40:41.969 --> 00:40:44.050
That's the number they tell you.
 

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:49.079
Now, why might not that be a
great number?

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:51.510
Did everyone follow what his
suggestion was?

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.534
So by the way,
his number's going to come out

00:40:54.534 --> 00:40:56.460
to be--well, I don't know.
 

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.639
Anyway it's going to be some
number.

00:40:57.639 --> 00:40:59.710
We could do that.
 

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:01.340
In fact it wouldn't be that
hard to do.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:07.519
Let's just do it.
 

00:41:07.519 --> 00:41:19.489
Sum, oh this wasn't a very--ah!
 

00:41:19.489 --> 00:41:21.190
How about equals?
 

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:37.960
 
 

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:49.980
Oh, dear, all right,
circular reference.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:42:00.599
Equals sum.
 

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:03.139
Oh, why did I get zero here?
 

00:42:03.139 --> 00:42:04.489
Oh, because I'm trying to
multiply these.

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:06.829
I'm adding instead, so equals.
 

00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:08.909
I'll just have to do it one by
one.

00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:14.768
That times the next one,
times the next one.

00:42:14.768 --> 00:42:16.539
There's obviously a much faster
way of doing this.

00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:21.820
Times the next one,
times that one and zero,

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.000
that's what 1 dollar would have
gotten you if you had put it in

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.931
and kept it until the end,
and now he's saying take this

00:42:26.931 --> 00:42:28.250
to the fifth power.
 

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:36.320
So I'll take up this .2 enter.
 

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:42.827
So 12.2 percent,
now why isn't that the right

00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:44.159
number?
 

00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:49.739
Why might you think there
should be another number?

00:42:49.739 --> 00:42:50.369
What's another number?
 

00:42:50.369 --> 00:42:53.210
What's the matter with
that--way back there?

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:58.286
Student: It's grossly
inflated by that last year's 50

00:42:58.286 --> 00:42:59.750
percent return.
 

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.440
Prof: Well,
is it grossly inflated,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.130
but why is it grossly inflated
by that?

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:06.117
Student: There are going
to be lots of years where it

00:43:06.117 --> 00:43:07.030
doesn't do that.
 

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:08.601
Prof: That's true,
but you've taken that into

00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:08.909
account.
 

00:43:08.909 --> 00:43:13.476
So the years we didn't do that
well like the 0 percent return

00:43:13.476 --> 00:43:17.585
that brought the average down,
so why is that a problem

00:43:17.585 --> 00:43:18.500
exactly?
 

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.838
Yeah, it's averaging the good
years with the bad years,

00:43:22.838 --> 00:43:23.239
so.
 

00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:23.929
Yeah?
 

00:43:23.929 --> 00:43:26.440
Student: As far as a
measure of past performance it

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.172
doesn't take into account that
after three mediocre years a lot

00:43:29.172 --> 00:43:30.889
of money was removed from the
fund.

00:43:30.889 --> 00:43:33.239
Prof: That's the crucial
thing.

00:43:33.239 --> 00:43:39.268
So I didn't do extreme enough
numbers.

00:43:39.268 --> 00:43:44.722
The crucial thing to take into
account is that suppose you have

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:48.947
a fund that starts off,
many funds like my fund started

00:43:48.947 --> 00:43:52.498
off with very little money,
but we did it at the right time

00:43:52.498 --> 00:43:54.630
because we knew that was a good
time.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:55.947
You're going to see when the
leverage cycle,

00:43:55.947 --> 00:43:56.530
we talk about it.
 

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.827
It was at the bottom of the
leverage cycle just like this

00:43:58.827 --> 00:43:59.320
past year.
 

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.929
We're up 30 percent this year.
 

00:44:01.929 --> 00:44:03.853
So at the bottom of the
leverage cycle you're going to

00:44:03.853 --> 00:44:04.579
have a great year.
 

00:44:04.579 --> 00:44:08.112
Of course we hardly had any
money because the fund was just

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:11.340
starting, and so we made 50
percent the first year.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.030
But then everybody said,
"Oh,

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:14.768
these guys must be
geniuses,"

00:44:14.768 --> 00:44:17.719
and they poured a huge amount
of money into our fund,

00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:22.079
and let's say the next year we
did 10 percent.

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:24.518
Actually we had another great
year the second year,

00:44:24.518 --> 00:44:27.199
but let's say that we did 10
percent the second year.

00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:31.487
So the young man in the front
is saying you made 50 percent on

00:44:31.487 --> 00:44:35.635
pennies and then you made 10
percent on a gigantic amount of

00:44:35.635 --> 00:44:36.340
money.
 

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.956
It isn't right to take the
average of 50 percent and 10

00:44:38.956 --> 00:44:41.914
percent because almost all the
money that you managed you made

00:44:41.914 --> 00:44:43.659
10 percent on not 50 percent on.
 

00:44:43.659 --> 00:44:44.639
That's his point.
 

00:44:44.639 --> 00:44:47.449
So how would you deal with his
point?

00:44:47.449 --> 00:44:51.094
How could you figure out a way
of computing the right return to

00:44:51.094 --> 00:44:54.503
compensate for the fact that
some years you have a lot more

00:44:54.503 --> 00:44:57.150
money at stake than you have
other years?

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.768
Yes?
 

00:44:57.768 --> 00:44:58.909
Student: Take a weighted
average?

00:44:58.909 --> 00:44:59.909
Prof: Take a weighted
average.

00:44:59.909 --> 00:45:03.559
Well, how would you take the
weighted average?

00:45:03.559 --> 00:45:06.469
Sounds a little complicated.
 

00:45:06.469 --> 00:45:08.570
That's what I'm going to do,
but it's not immediately

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:09.500
obvious how to do it.
 

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.570
So I wouldn't have expected you
to be able to answer that.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.300
You're right on the right track.
 

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.579
So does anyone have anything
else to say?

00:45:16.579 --> 00:45:18.000
Yep?
 

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.074
Student: I guess you
multiply each

00:45:21.074 --> 00:45:22.994
&gt;
 

00:45:22.994 --> 00:45:26.684
, and then you add it all up
and divide it by the

00:45:26.684 --> 00:45:28.989
&gt;
 

00:45:28.989 --> 00:45:33.552
Prof: All right,
so I'm going to now give you

00:45:33.552 --> 00:45:37.579
the answer which is a little bit
like that.

00:45:37.579 --> 00:45:40.860
She's saying do some dollar
weighted thing,

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.547
and so you somehow weight the
numbers by how much money there

00:45:45.547 --> 00:45:47.969
was invested for that year.
 

00:45:47.969 --> 00:45:51.255
So because there was a lot more
money invested in year 3 than

00:45:51.255 --> 00:45:54.487
there was in year 1 that number
should somehow have a bigger

00:45:54.487 --> 00:45:55.090
weight.
 

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:59.309
And it's not exactly clear how
the weights are going to get in

00:45:59.309 --> 00:46:03.322
there, but it's obvious that
that's something like that you

00:46:03.322 --> 00:46:04.429
ought to do.
 

00:46:04.429 --> 00:46:10.536
So here's the mathematical
solution that the internal rate

00:46:10.536 --> 00:46:13.429
of return or yield gives.
 

00:46:13.429 --> 00:46:23.480
So it says every year let's
look at what happened in the

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.760
fund.
 

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.219
We shouldn't care about which
investor put in which dollar.

00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:30.230
We care about how the fund
managed dollars.

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:32.590
The names of the investors
don't make any difference.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.039
It's how did the fund manage
its money.

00:46:35.039 --> 00:46:38.789
So in the first year the fund
got 100 dollars.

00:46:38.789 --> 00:46:42.969
So as for producing money it
produced a negative 100.

00:46:42.969 --> 00:46:44.730
Money went into the fund.
 

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.239
That was the one guy invested.
 

00:46:46.239 --> 00:46:47.230
We don't care who it was.
 

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.010
The total that went into the
fund was 100.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.840
The second year 1,200 went into
the fund.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.460
Those are the second two guys.
 

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.079
The third year 110 came out.
 

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:57.750
That was the first guy.
 

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:01.360
The fourth year 556 came out.
 

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.809
That was the second guy.
 

00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:06.699
This is beginning of the fifth
year.

00:47:06.699 --> 00:47:10.081
The third guy took out 155
dollars, and then the last year

00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:13.760
the second and third guys took
out everything that was left.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.931
So from the point of view of
money creation and use this is

00:47:17.931 --> 00:47:22.103
every year what went into the
fund and what came out of the

00:47:22.103 --> 00:47:24.190
fund, the net inflow out.
 

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:28.250
So there are a bunch of numbers.
 

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:32.318
So the question is,
so the one number summary is

00:47:32.318 --> 00:47:35.840
what rate of return,
it's called the internal rate

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.480
of return which if you
discounted all these numbers

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.699
what would Fisher say if you
discounted all these numbers?

00:47:41.699 --> 00:47:44.237
If you had to use just one
interest rate,

00:47:44.237 --> 00:47:47.027
Fisher would say,
what's the present value of

00:47:47.027 --> 00:47:48.360
these cash flows?
 

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.739
Well, if the interest rate was
0 you just add up all the

00:47:50.739 --> 00:47:52.860
numbers and you're going to get
a big positive.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.858
If the interest rate is
infinity then that means that

00:47:55.858 --> 00:47:59.204
after the first year you're
discounting everything to 0 and

00:47:59.204 --> 00:48:01.340
you're going to get negative
100.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.320
So you could say,
what interest rate could you

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.389
discount all the cash flows at
to produce 0?

00:48:09.389 --> 00:48:12.688
That would be like saying at
that interest rate,

00:48:12.688 --> 00:48:16.059
all the fund has done is
rearranged its money.

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.934
It's taken money in and put
money out, but at that same

00:48:18.934 --> 00:48:21.489
constant interest rate the
present value is 0.

00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:27.217
So it's allowed you to trade
money across periods at this

00:48:27.217 --> 00:48:32.637
internal rate of return,
the interest rate which makes

00:48:32.637 --> 00:48:35.400
the present value zero.
 

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.030
So 10 percent turns out to be
the right number.

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:40.380
So if you discounted things by
10 percent,

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:44.094
you see what the formula is,
you take the inflow and you

00:48:44.094 --> 00:48:48.282
discount it by 1.10 to the first
power and this you discount by

00:48:48.282 --> 00:48:53.389
1.10 to the second power,
the inflow, the net outflow,

00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:57.208
I guess,
which is 110 you discount by

00:48:57.208 --> 00:49:00.510
1.10 to the third power
etcetera.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:03.806
You keep discounting by that
and you get all the discounted

00:49:03.806 --> 00:49:04.489
net flows.
 

00:49:04.489 --> 00:49:07.429
You add them all up and you get
practically nothing.

00:49:07.429 --> 00:49:10.434
That's adding them up and this
is taking the square,

00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:14.146
and I used Solver to figure out
what the right discount rate was

00:49:14.146 --> 00:49:15.679
to make all this zero.
 

00:49:15.679 --> 00:49:20.547
So that's the simple way of
averaging, dollar weighting

00:49:20.547 --> 00:49:21.719
everything.
 

00:49:21.719 --> 00:49:24.518
You don't care about who the
people are.

00:49:24.518 --> 00:49:27.280
You don't care about whether
one guy's putting money in,

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.639
another guy's taking it out at
the same time.

00:49:29.639 --> 00:49:32.163
You just care about the net,
and if you've got a bunch of

00:49:32.163 --> 00:49:34.048
net numbers,
that's the net outflow,

00:49:34.048 --> 00:49:37.438
and you're trying to say,
what's the single rate of

00:49:37.438 --> 00:49:38.070
return?
 

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:42.440
The idea is to say at what
interest rate?

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.483
If there were a bank paying an
interest rate and all those

00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:48.688
things discounted gave you zero
that would be like saying the

00:49:48.688 --> 00:49:50.880
fund is functioning just like a
bank.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.099
No matter when people put the
money in or take it out they're

00:49:54.099 --> 00:49:57.159
always getting this rate of
return which is 10 percent.

00:49:57.159 --> 00:50:00.139
So they're getting a constant
10 percent rate of return no

00:50:00.139 --> 00:50:03.485
matter when the money goes in or
out and that kind of gives you a

00:50:03.485 --> 00:50:05.630
measure of how well the fund's
doing.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.264
So that's the internal rate of
return, or the yield to

00:50:09.264 --> 00:50:10.018
maturity.
 

00:50:10.018 --> 00:50:12.329
It says take the net cash flows
every year.

00:50:12.329 --> 00:50:18.195
Find the number which when you
discount at that number you get

00:50:18.195 --> 00:50:21.079
present value equal to zero.
 

00:50:21.079 --> 00:50:25.648
So it's 10 percent which is a
different number from 12

00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:26.510
percent.
 

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:30.139
Now before we got the geometric
average of 12 percent.

00:50:30.139 --> 00:50:34.414
Now very typically this is the
case that this internal rate of

00:50:34.414 --> 00:50:38.827
return is lower than the dollar
return from putting the money in

00:50:38.827 --> 00:50:41.824
at the beginning,
assuming the fund doesn't just

00:50:41.824 --> 00:50:43.570
collapse and go to zero at the
end.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:44.380
So why is that?
 

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:47.306
For funds that have survived
typically that number,

00:50:47.306 --> 00:50:49.650
12 percent, is higher than 10
percent.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.969
Why would that be?
 

00:50:51.969 --> 00:50:55.840
What does that tell you about
the world?

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.340
Someone who hasn't--well,
go ahead.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.606
Student: That it's
easier to make money with a

00:51:00.606 --> 00:51:01.739
smaller amount of money?
 

00:51:01.739 --> 00:51:04.800
Prof: It tells you that,
and how is it that the hedge

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.409
fund--it could tell you that.
 

00:51:06.409 --> 00:51:08.409
It tells you that the hedge
funds are doing better when they

00:51:08.409 --> 00:51:10.376
have a smaller amount of money
than when they have a larger

00:51:10.376 --> 00:51:11.360
amount of money,
exactly.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.067
You've concluded that it's
easier to make money when you

00:51:14.067 --> 00:51:15.150
have a small amount.
 

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:18.539
What's another possible
explanation?

00:51:18.539 --> 00:51:20.932
Student: People normally
invest a lot after a big year

00:51:20.932 --> 00:51:22.010
&gt;
 

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.500
Prof: Right.
 

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.510
I think that's the reason.
 

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:26.965
The reason is that people pour
money into hedge funds just

00:51:26.965 --> 00:51:29.268
after they've done incredibly
well,

00:51:29.268 --> 00:51:31.672
and they keep pouring money in,
then eventually there's a blow

00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:31.869
up.
 

00:51:31.869 --> 00:51:36.076
And so when the blow up comes
the hedge funds have zillions of

00:51:36.076 --> 00:51:39.110
dollars and they're losing a lot
of money.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:41.407
Then everybody pulls their
money out and that's when the

00:51:41.407 --> 00:51:43.996
cycle is going up and then all
of a sudden the hedge funds have

00:51:43.996 --> 00:51:46.880
these huge returns again,
but they hardly have any money.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:52.630
So, any other questions about
this?

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:58.840
All right, so internal rate of
return is a way--

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.909
we are going to see that it has
many shortcomings,

00:52:00.909 --> 00:52:03.500
but it's a way at getting at
the idea,

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.248
as several of you have said,
that you can't just take the

00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:09.201
geometric average,
which is what every hedge fund

00:52:09.201 --> 00:52:10.929
like ours always produces.
 

00:52:10.929 --> 00:52:13.076
That's the number we tell
everybody because it's a better

00:52:13.076 --> 00:52:14.150
number than the other one.
 

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:18.739
So the geometric average of the
returns are,

00:52:18.739 --> 00:52:23.128
if you're an investor who puts
1 dollar in at the beginning and

00:52:23.128 --> 00:52:27.306
leaves it there forever what's
your geometric average of all

00:52:27.306 --> 00:52:28.510
your returns.
 

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.081
That's not a good reflection of
how the hedge fund's done

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.836
necessarily because some years
the fund had a lot of money to

00:52:33.836 --> 00:52:34.480
work with.
 

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.750
And so the average dollar
didn't do that well,

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.123
and now there's a question
about how should you measure the

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:42.139
average dollar,
and I've given the internal

00:52:42.139 --> 00:52:42.900
rate of return.
 

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.559
There are actually other
formulas you could give.

00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:50.889
This is the most famous one.
 

00:52:50.889 --> 00:52:57.320
Now let's see how this internal
rate of return is used all the

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.639
time on Wall Street.
 

00:52:59.639 --> 00:53:03.132
By the way, if you're not
following what I'm saying you

00:53:03.132 --> 00:53:05.010
should please interrupt me.
 

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:11.840
So what if you took a bond,
a simple coupon bond?

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.599
What is a simple coupon bond?
 

00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:16.501
The yield to maturity of a
simple coupon bond,

00:53:16.501 --> 00:53:20.369
I'm now on this lecture called
yield, what is a simple coupon

00:53:20.369 --> 00:53:20.949
bond?
 

00:53:20.949 --> 00:53:24.742
A simple coupon bond pays the
same coupon every year and then

00:53:24.742 --> 00:53:28.030
pays the principal and the
coupon at its maturity.

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:34.057
So the yield to maturity is
going to be the price,

00:53:34.057 --> 00:53:40.579
which is like a negative
payment--suppose you knew the

00:53:40.579 --> 00:53:43.409
price of this bond.
 

00:53:43.409 --> 00:53:46.456
If you knew the price of the
bond, and so the bond is

00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:49.739
promising all these payments,
how good a deal is that?

00:53:49.739 --> 00:53:53.135
Well, how good a deal it is
they would say is you simply

00:53:53.135 --> 00:53:57.027
take this first negative payment
and all these positive payments

00:53:57.027 --> 00:54:00.670
and find the unique interest
rate which when you discount it

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.079
will give you present value of
0.

00:54:03.079 --> 00:54:07.929
And so if this is a coupon
bond, say paying 7 percent,

00:54:07.929 --> 00:54:10.829
say the face is 100,
it pays 7 dollars forever,

00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:14.989
and 107 at the end,
and the price is 105,

00:54:14.989 --> 00:54:21.480
what do you think the yield to
maturity is going to be?

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.239
Can you say anything
qualitative about it?

00:54:23.239 --> 00:54:28.226
Suppose it's a 7 percent coupon
bond, face of 100,10-year bond,

00:54:28.226 --> 00:54:32.809
no one thinks that it'll
default, but its price is 105.

00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:38.260
What is the yield to maturity
in that case do you suppose?

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.447
Just a vague guess,
I just want a qualitative

00:54:41.447 --> 00:54:42.099
number.
 

00:54:42.099 --> 00:54:44.909
Student: 6.7?
 

00:54:44.909 --> 00:54:53.018
Prof: 6.7,
that's qualitatively wrong.

00:54:53.018 --> 00:54:54.449
Well, I mean it's not
qualitatively wrong.

00:54:54.449 --> 00:54:55.539
No, it's qualitatively right.
 

00:54:55.539 --> 00:54:57.099
It could have been better.
 

00:54:57.099 --> 00:54:57.909
So he's right.
 

00:54:57.909 --> 00:55:03.242
So what if the price were 100
what would the yield to maturity

00:55:03.242 --> 00:55:03.679
be?
 

00:55:03.679 --> 00:55:05.780
Student: 7 percent.
 

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.621
Prof: 7 percent,
that's obvious,

00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:08.010
right?
 

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:13.831
If it's a 7 percent coupon bond
on face of 100 and its price is

00:55:13.831 --> 00:55:15.581
100,
price = to the face,

00:55:15.581 --> 00:55:18.693
then obviously the thing that
discounts you back to 100 is

00:55:18.693 --> 00:55:20.550
going to be 7 percent interest.
 

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:23.922
So if the price were 100 the
yield to maturity would just be

00:55:23.922 --> 00:55:24.610
7 percent.
 

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:27.501
But I told you the price was
105, which is a lot more

00:55:27.501 --> 00:55:28.170
expensive.
 

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:29.449
So it's a bad deal.
 

00:55:29.449 --> 00:55:31.590
So it's not going to be as good
as 107.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:36.130
So it's not going to be 7
percent and he said 6.7.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:39.030
So I think it would be a little
worse than that,

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.869
but that's qualitatively just
what I asked for,

00:55:41.869 --> 00:55:44.030
something worse than 7 percent.
 

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:45.980
So who said 6.7 percent?
 

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.619
You did.
 

00:55:47.619 --> 00:55:53.657
Student: I just took the
price of the bond over the

00:55:53.657 --> 00:55:59.057
coupon payment and that's 6.7,
but it's not the only

00:55:59.057 --> 00:56:02.130
&gt;
 

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.820
Prof: So that's another
number.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:10.429
So I'm going to come back to
your question.

00:56:10.429 --> 00:56:11.268
It's a good question.
 

00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:23.664
So do you all see that if you
measured the yield to maturity

00:56:23.664 --> 00:56:33.117
on this bond--so the bond,
remember, pays 7,7,

00:56:33.117 --> 00:56:39.630
7,107 and its price is 105.
 

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:45.998
So the yield to maturity is
going to be that number such

00:56:45.998 --> 00:56:53.063
that 105 = 7 over (1 the yield)
7 over (1 the yield) squared 7

00:56:53.063 --> 00:56:56.768
over (1 the yield) cubed ...
 

00:56:56.768 --> 00:57:03.349
107 over (1 yield) to the
tenth, that's 105.

00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:09.266
So what we observed is that Y
has to be less than 7 percent

00:57:09.266 --> 00:57:15.592
because if Y were exactly equal
to 7 percent this would give us

00:57:15.592 --> 00:57:16.409
100.
 

00:57:16.409 --> 00:57:19.842
But this bond is more
expensive, so you're paying more

00:57:19.842 --> 00:57:23.210
to get the same payments you
would--than the face.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.420
You're paying more than the
face to get the same payment.

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.634
If the price were equal to the
face it would be a 7 percent

00:57:27.634 --> 00:57:27.940
yield.
 

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.739
So since you're paying more
you're getting a worse deal,

00:57:30.739 --> 00:57:34.255
so it's pretty obvious that if
you want to discount this number

00:57:34.255 --> 00:57:37.753
to more than 100,
namely 105, Y is going to have

00:57:37.753 --> 00:57:39.880
to be less than 7 percent.
 

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.420
So that's the first thing we
said.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.860
Now what did he do?
 

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:55.896
He gave a number and he said 7
over 105 which he said was about

00:57:55.896 --> 00:57:58.840
6.7 percent.
 

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:11.268
So that number that he gave is
called the current yield.

00:58:11.268 --> 00:58:15.996
It's another number people
give, and he figured that was

00:58:15.996 --> 00:58:17.199
6.7 percent.
 

00:58:17.199 --> 00:58:26.000
So let's believe him that's 6.7
percent.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:41.449
How does that number compare to
the yield to maturity,

00:58:41.449 --> 00:58:43.489
to Y?
 

00:58:43.489 --> 00:58:51.150
Well, we could compute this out
on Excel since I'm doing so

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:54.320
brilliantly at it now.
 

00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:02.181
So we could go 7,7,
7,7, 7,7, 7,7,

00:59:02.181 --> 00:59:05.280
7, and 107.
 

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:13.353
Those are our payments and then
we could try some yield to

00:59:13.353 --> 00:59:21.570
maturity, internal rate of
return and let's guess 1.067.

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:28.958
And now we'd say the cash flow
is going to be this,

00:59:28.958 --> 00:59:32.800
is going to be the left.
 

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.630
Oh dear, I have to number
things.

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:37.010
So again, there's probably some
clever way of doing this.

00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:46.159
So this'll be--I forgot to
write the year.

00:59:46.159 --> 00:59:52.210
Let's just add this.
 

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:56.690
Equals up 1 enter.
 

00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:57.980
So I'm just going to copy this.
 

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:05.739
All right, so now I've numbered
all the years.

01:00:05.739 --> 01:00:14.610
Equals up 1 enter and now
control copy.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.969
So I've numbered all the years
here and here are the payments.

01:00:16.969 --> 01:00:24.132
And now at this yield to
maturity I'm going to go equal

01:00:24.132 --> 01:00:32.619
the thing on the left divided by
the yield to maturity that we're

01:00:32.619 --> 01:00:37.130
guessing raised to this power.
 

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:43.800
Now I can just copy that and
I've got all these cash flows.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.789
Oh, what did I do that time?
 

01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:47.052
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:00:47.052 --> 01:00:47.869
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:00:47.869 --> 01:00:48.730
Prof: What?
 

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:52.293
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:00:52.293 --> 01:00:54.599
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:00:54.599 --> 01:00:55.590
Prof: Control copy,
sorry.

01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:59.420
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.900
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:02.920
Prof: Control copy,
right?

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.280
So I just want to copy this?
 

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.432
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:06.179
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:01:06.179 --> 01:01:06.929
Prof: Oh, I see.
 

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:09.313
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
right, right,

01:01:09.313 --> 01:01:12.889
right, so here I've got
the--you are right.

01:01:12.889 --> 01:01:17.027
So there's a trick here which I
forgot which is the discount

01:01:17.027 --> 01:01:19.605
rate,
the internal rate of return E

01:01:19.605 --> 01:01:26.289
I've got to put a dollar sign,
dollar E, dollar 1 so that way

01:01:26.289 --> 01:01:29.710
it remembers the spot.
 

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:35.349
So now when I copy it it's
going to remember that.

01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:36.780
Student: B1.
 

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.659
Prof: What's B1?
 

01:01:37.659 --> 01:01:40.088
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:01:40.088 --> 01:01:41.659
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:01:41.659 --> 01:01:42.820
Prof: Oh, B1.
 

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:52.230
Thank you, so there are two
mistakes, B1.

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:55.989
Now, control copy.
 

01:01:55.989 --> 01:01:58.902
So I'm supposed to be showing
you how easy it is to do this,

01:01:58.902 --> 01:02:00.780
but--all right,
so anyway that's it.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.885
So if you see for each number
here I've got the payments for

01:02:03.885 --> 01:02:06.936
every year and I've discounted
them by taking this internal

01:02:06.936 --> 01:02:11.148
rate of return,
and now I just have to sum all

01:02:11.148 --> 01:02:11.780
this.
 

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:23.690
Equals sum parenthesis.
 

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:24.809
Oh shit.
 

01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:27.777
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.699
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:02:29.699 --> 01:02:31.268
Prof: I'm trying to sum
it, you're right.

01:02:31.268 --> 01:02:37.590
So here equals,
I want to sum all these.

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.760
So what did I do wrong?
 

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.880
Student: C1 colon C10.
 

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.005
Prof: C1 colon C10,
that's what I thought I did,

01:02:48.005 --> 01:02:50.380
but obviously I didn't.
 

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:56.489
Good, and now we can do this
and square it.

01:02:56.489 --> 01:03:05.847
So that's the thing I want to
minimize, and so now I'm going

01:03:05.847 --> 01:03:12.987
to Tools, Solver,
Min, C12 by concentrating on

01:03:12.987 --> 01:03:17.268
this number, and solve.
 

01:03:17.268 --> 01:03:22.617
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:03:22.617 --> 01:03:26.079
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:26.940
Prof: All right,
what did I do?

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:31.614
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:03:31.614 --> 01:03:34.639
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:03:34.639 --> 01:03:36.320
Prof: Here's the sum,
here's the...

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.110
Student: The original
price.

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:41.340
Prof: Oh,
the original price.

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.139
Ah ha!
 

01:03:42.139 --> 01:03:43.889
Thank you very much.
 

01:03:43.889 --> 01:03:47.199
So we need the original price
of 105.

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:49.784
Very good, so I see that
preparing this would have

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:50.260
helped.
 

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.860
So here's the sum.
 

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:59.661
So we just summed all these
things, and here we're going

01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:04.768
to--so we're summing those,
right?

01:04:04.768 --> 01:04:12.885
So I summed all these and then
I've got the original price 105

01:04:12.885 --> 01:04:13.949
enter.
 

01:04:13.949 --> 01:04:29.309
Now we'll add equals this plus
this.

01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:32.588
Student:
&lt;&lt;overlapping

01:04:32.588 --> 01:04:34.710
conversation&gt;&gt;
 

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:46.570
Prof: You're right,
this minus that.

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:52.443
And now we want to square this,
equals up squared enter and now

01:04:52.443 --> 01:04:54.150
we'll do Solver.
 

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:56.880
Hopefully there isn't another
mistake.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:15.619
So Tools, Solver,
so I want that times E1.

01:05:15.619 --> 01:05:17.789
Oh, that's very bad.
 

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:23.030
Anyway, you can solve it using
Solver and it's extremely simple

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:26.920
to do, and a child could learn
how to do it.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.490
So we get Solver and we solve
all this, and you should be able

01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:34.340
to use Excel with no problem at
all.

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:38.170
So the question is what are the
relationships between the

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:42.206
current yield and the yield to
maturity, and suppose there's

01:05:42.206 --> 01:05:44.260
some actual interest rate.
 

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:51.389
So there's an actual market
interest rate of,

01:05:51.389 --> 01:05:56.250
say, 6 percent or something.
 

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:59.860
So those are the things that we
want to sort out now in the next

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.719
five minutes.
 

01:06:00.719 --> 01:06:09.777
So let me go back to the notes
and we'll re-ask all the

01:06:09.777 --> 01:06:12.630
questions here.
 

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:13.260
You can see that's Solver.
 

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:25.889
I've broken Solver.
 

01:06:25.889 --> 01:06:31.891
Suppose that there were an
actual interest rate in the

01:06:31.891 --> 01:06:36.795
economy and our bond,
the bond that was 7,7,

01:06:36.795 --> 01:06:40.869
7,107, if the actual interest
rate was,

01:06:40.869 --> 01:06:47.010
say, 6 percent the price of the
bond would be more than 100.

01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:50.143
So some price which will be the
present value will be greater

01:06:50.143 --> 01:06:52.338
than 100,
obviously, because it's

01:06:52.338 --> 01:06:56.365
paying--if the interest rate's
only 6 percent this is giving

01:06:56.365 --> 01:06:57.800
you more than 100.
 

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:05.829
Now, the current yield is 7
over the present value,

01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:11.610
exactly analogous to what he
said.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:14.119
So if someone calls you on the
phone,

01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:15.690
you haven't gotten these calls
yet,

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:19.550
but when you get older you'll
get--they're screened now,

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:22.414
so it's harder to get these,
but it used to be a few years

01:07:22.414 --> 01:07:25.278
ago you'd get called on the
phone quite often and somebody

01:07:25.278 --> 01:07:27.289
would say he's running a bond
fund,

01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:30.369
and the bond fund is really
doing great,

01:07:30.369 --> 01:07:34.518
and he wants to tell you that
the bonds they have in the fund

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:38.460
last year paid a current yield
of 7 over the present value

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:42.750
which is much bigger than the
interest rate of 6 percent,

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:46.489
and therefore you should buy
his bonds.

01:07:46.489 --> 01:07:52.469
Now, what can you say about
that?

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:55.751
Suppose somebody tells you
there's a market price for the

01:07:55.751 --> 01:07:58.056
bonds,
which we know is the present

01:07:58.056 --> 01:08:00.719
value at the interest rate of 6
percent,

01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:02.789
and he tells you that,
"Look,

01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:05.139
look at the market value I got
last year,

01:08:05.139 --> 01:08:08.518
the yield I got;
the current yield I got on

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:09.219
these bonds.
 

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:12.367
The present value was some
number bigger than 100,

01:08:12.367 --> 01:08:16.287
but I take 7 over the present
value and I get something bigger

01:08:16.287 --> 01:08:17.510
than 6 percent.
 

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.751
At your bank you're only
getting 6 percent,

01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:24.609
so therefore you should invest
in my fund."

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:31.220
Is that a good argument to
invest in his fund?

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.279
Why not?
 

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:45.680
 
 

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:55.827
Now, this bond is called a
premium bond because the price

01:08:55.827 --> 01:09:05.242
is bigger than the face,
and a discount bond means the

01:09:05.242 --> 01:09:13.194
price is less than the face,
and a par bond,

01:09:13.194 --> 01:09:19.090
the price equals the face.
 

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:25.288
So just because a bond pays a
coupon of 7--

01:09:25.288 --> 01:09:27.520
it may be when the bond was
issued everybody thought the

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.590
interest rate was going to be 7
percent forever,

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:33.103
so that's why they picked a
coupon of 7 so that the price

01:09:33.103 --> 01:09:36.930
when they first issued it would
be equal to its face value.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:40.240
But maybe the next day,
so it's still a 10-year bond,

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.552
practically no time has
changed, but unexpectedly the

01:09:43.552 --> 01:09:45.908
interest rates fell to 6
percent.

01:09:45.908 --> 01:09:49.795
If you take the same coupon
bond paying 7 all the time at 6

01:09:49.795 --> 01:09:53.814
percent interest its price is
obviously going to go up in the

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:57.698
market because everybody is
going to discount the 7s,

01:09:57.698 --> 01:10:00.439
not at 7 percent,
but at 6 percent and get a

01:10:00.439 --> 01:10:02.479
number that's bigger than 100.
 

01:10:02.479 --> 01:10:06.996
So you're going to have to pay
more for the bond because the

01:10:06.996 --> 01:10:08.908
present value's higher.
 

01:10:08.908 --> 01:10:13.268
However, people who now will
try and market the bond they're

01:10:13.268 --> 01:10:16.047
going to tell you,
"Well, look at the market

01:10:16.047 --> 01:10:17.810
price," whatever the market
price is.

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:20.760
So the current yield is the
market price.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.408
They'll say,
"Look at the market price.

01:10:23.408 --> 01:10:25.149
This is what we bought the
bonds for.

01:10:25.149 --> 01:10:25.988
I'm a fund.
 

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:31.078
I went out and bought these
bonds.

01:10:31.078 --> 01:10:34.940
Look at the price I paid and I
got 7 dollars for these bonds

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.932
this year in income and 7 over
the market price of the bond is

01:10:38.932 --> 01:10:43.038
bigger than 6 percent,
so I was doing a great job.

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:45.328
You should invest in my
fund."

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:49.279
So, that can't be a correct
thing to say or a persuasive

01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:51.916
thing to say,
because the market price

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:55.569
reflected the fact that the
interest rates were 6 percent.

01:10:55.569 --> 01:10:59.288
Everybody was properly
computing the present value,

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:01.859
and let's say the market price
was equal to the present value,

01:11:01.859 --> 01:11:07.199
the present value would indeed
be greater than 100 and in fact

01:11:07.199 --> 01:11:12.279
the current yield would be more
than the interest rate of 6

01:11:12.279 --> 01:11:13.329
percent.
 

01:11:13.329 --> 01:11:20.649
So why is that?
 

01:11:20.649 --> 01:11:35.344
So, theorem,
if market price equals present

01:11:35.344 --> 01:11:55.287
value at a going interest rate
then the current yield on a

01:11:55.287 --> 01:12:15.579
premium bond is always greater
than the interest rate.

01:12:15.579 --> 01:12:19.630
So why is that?
 

01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:22.389
So in this case,
if I hadn't screwed up the

01:12:22.389 --> 01:12:25.738
Excel we would have calculated
the present value.

01:12:25.738 --> 01:12:30.279
So 7,7, 7,107 there's only a 6
percent interest.

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:33.792
So everybody taught by Irving
Fisher computes the new present

01:12:33.792 --> 01:12:37.363
value which of course is bigger
than 100 and that's the market

01:12:37.363 --> 01:12:37.948
price.
 

01:12:37.948 --> 01:12:43.710
Some unscrupulous salesman
starts a fund,

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:46.238
buys the bond for whatever this
present value,

01:12:46.238 --> 01:12:49.164
the market price is,
then goes out to a bunch of

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:50.759
clients,
potential clients,

01:12:50.759 --> 01:12:53.837
investors, and says,
"Look, my very first year

01:12:53.837 --> 01:12:57.706
in business I spent a little
more than 100 dollars and I got

01:12:57.706 --> 01:13:01.640
7 dollars as a coupon and 7 over
this little more than 100 is

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.510
giving me at current yield
that's more than 6 percent.

01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:06.979
I beat the interest rate.
 

01:13:06.979 --> 01:13:08.858
You should invest in me,
and by the way,

01:13:08.858 --> 01:13:11.698
I'll charge you a little fee to
do that because I'm doing so

01:13:11.698 --> 01:13:12.470
great."
 

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:15.697
Now, that's always going to be
the case so it has to be that he

01:13:15.697 --> 01:13:18.038
really hasn't accomplished
anything at all.

01:13:18.038 --> 01:13:23.179
So why is it easy to see that
whenever I computed the present

01:13:23.179 --> 01:13:27.118
value it was going to have to be
more than--

01:13:27.118 --> 01:13:30.210
this current yield would always
be more than 6 percent.

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:31.180
How do I know that?
 

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.279
Yep?
 

01:13:33.279 --> 01:13:37.391
Student: Because of the
face value that's going to be at

01:13:37.391 --> 01:13:41.106
the end at maturity isn't going
to reflect that increased

01:13:41.106 --> 01:13:43.960
interest or relatively higher
interest.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.909
It's going to be the original
face value.

01:13:45.909 --> 01:13:48.319
Prof: Exactly.
 

01:13:48.319 --> 01:13:52.993
So let's say,
to keep this simpler,

01:13:52.993 --> 01:14:00.690
let's suppose these were 10s
everywhere, and the interest

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:05.090
rate went down to 5 percent.
 

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:09.710
Now, what's going to be the
present value of this bond?

01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:12.149
It's not going to be 200, right?
 

01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:20.230
If the bond paid 10,10,
210, suppose I have something

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:28.779
paying 10-10-10 and 110,
and the coupon is 5 percent.

01:14:28.779 --> 01:14:36.210
The present value is going to
be less than 200.

01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:40.279
The coupon is always double the
interest rate,

01:14:40.279 --> 01:14:43.011
so it looks like that's what
you'd get if you had 200

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:44.658
dollars,
but at the end,

01:14:44.658 --> 01:14:47.720
as he's saying,
you're only going to get 110

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.788
and not 210.
 

01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:52.819
So this present value of this
thing has to be less than 200.

01:14:52.819 --> 01:14:57.408
So if you double the coupon--if
you halve the interest rate,

01:14:57.408 --> 01:14:59.270
the interest rate was
originally 10 percent,

01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:02.868
if you cut the interest rate in
half to 5 percent it looks like

01:15:02.868 --> 01:15:05.770
your annual coupon is double the
interest rate,

01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:09.315
but at the end you don't get
principal that's double the

01:15:09.315 --> 01:15:10.670
original principal.
 

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:12.978
All you did was
double--relative to the interest

01:15:12.978 --> 01:15:15.238
rate of 5 percent,
the coupon's twice as big as

01:15:15.238 --> 01:15:17.399
you normally expect,
but the face isn't.

01:15:17.399 --> 01:15:20.672
So therefore,
this has to be worth less than

01:15:20.672 --> 01:15:21.130
200.
 

01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:25.649
If it were 200 at 5 percent it
would give you 10,

01:15:25.649 --> 01:15:28.720
10,10, 10,10,
210, but this gives you 10,

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.738
10,10, 110, so obviously the
present value is less than 200,

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:37.527
but therefore 10 over something
less than 200 is going to be

01:15:37.527 --> 01:15:38.939
more than 5 percent.
 

01:15:38.939 --> 01:15:42.938
So that's his intuitive proof,
which is the essence of the

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:46.743
thing,
that if ever you have a coupon

01:15:46.743 --> 01:15:52.881
bond that's a premium bond then
the current yield is always

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.738
above the interest rate.
 

01:15:55.738 --> 01:16:00.266
So you can always advertise it
as having a spectacular current

01:16:00.266 --> 01:16:04.350
yield when in fact it's just
priced perfectly fairly.

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:07.239
So I'm going to just continue
this story of what's the right

01:16:07.239 --> 01:16:09.787
way to measure things and how
you can get confused by

01:16:09.787 --> 01:16:11.699
measuring the wrong way next
class.

01:16:11.699 --> 01:16:17.000

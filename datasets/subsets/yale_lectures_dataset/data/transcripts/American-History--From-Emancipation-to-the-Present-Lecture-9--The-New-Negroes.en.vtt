00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.367
Let me begin with a quote
by Marcus Garvey from his

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:11.300
Declara--Declaration of
Rights for the Negro Peoples

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.300
of the World.&nbsp; One of his
points reads: "We believe in

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.700
the freedom of Africa for
the Negro people of the

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.567
world, and by the principle
of Europe for the Europeans

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:28.600
and Asia for the Asiatics;
we also demand Africa for

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.600
the Africans at
home and abroad."

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:38.667
Today I want to pick up on
the theme I ended the last

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:43.000
lecture with, and that
is that black Americans,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.867
talking heading--talking
about the nineteen-teens,

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:49.800
heading
into--into World War I,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.500
we're now in the wake of
the challenges of that era,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.400
and the domestic
disappointments of World War

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.200
I, when soldiers came
home and some were lynched,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.100
that black Americans were
going to claim their civil

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.400
rights instead of wait
patiently for them.&nbsp; These

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.100
were, as a group--and I'm
generalizing here--the New

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.000
Negroes.&nbsp; This is a term
used now and again really

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
after 1900, and one of
the first proponents of the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.400
phrase was Booker T.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.600
Washington, but using it in
a--in a very different way.&nbsp;

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
I'm using it in a very
different way than--than

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.967
Washington was using it.&nbsp;
When people talk about New

00:01:25.967 --> 00:01:28.667
Negroes, they're most often
using it in a very different

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:31.900
way than Washington
intended.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.067
these were the New Negroes,
this new--this new kind of

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:38.600
black consciousness that
really becomes articulated

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.600
on a wide scale when black
troops come home after World

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.800
War I; the New Negro that
was forged out of political

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.667
and economic frustration.&nbsp;
And it's always important to

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.267
remember that this
frustration grew out of more

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:05.267
than just
returning soldiers;

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:07.700
It grew out of the race
riots of 1917 and 1919;

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.700
It grew out of the cultural
shocks and changes that were

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.400
part of the Great Migration
as well.&nbsp; I want to show an

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.967
image right now that
captures some of that

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:23.300
spirit.&nbsp; "The
New--The New Negro crowd,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.800
making America safe for
himself."&nbsp; It's a play of

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.100
Woodrow Wilson's, "The New
Neg--the word--just drew a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.667
complete blank."

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:37.400
"Making the world
safe for democracy?"

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.200
Thank you so much.&nbsp;
"Making the world safe for

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.000
democracy."&nbsp; I
don't know why,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.700
it's a--it's
already a long day.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.400
Anyway, you see a--a black
troop in an Army jeep or

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.567
some kind of vehicle, the
New Negro blazoned on the

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:54.167
side, guns coming out in
all directions.&nbsp; He's going

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:59.000
after German troops, giving
the Hun a dose of his own

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.900
medicine.&nbsp; But notice the
banner that he's carrying:

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.100
Longview, Texas, the
site of a race riot;

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.267
Washington DC, a
site of a race riot;

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:10.100
Chicago, Illinois, site of
a race riot.&nbsp; "Since the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.267
government won't
stop mob violence,

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:15.800
I'll take a hand."

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.400
The New Negro, in this
case the black soldier,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.567
"If Wilson can't do
it for black soldiers,

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:26.300
for black citizens, if
the country can't do it,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.400
blacks will take it upon
themselves to do it."&nbsp; This

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.400
is--This editorial cartoon
is yet one manifestation of

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:49.400
a New Negro mentality.&nbsp;
Another point--hmm--Another

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.400
aspect that's important to
understand about the New

00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:08.000
Negro mentality, and
this phenomenon in general,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.067
was that it wasn't just
about black self-assertion,

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:15.300
like this--this cartoon
suggests.&nbsp; It was also about

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.667
white reaction.&nbsp; The white
reaction to the New--to the

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:22.167
New Negro manifests itself
in negative and positive

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:25.900
ways.&nbsp; The positive
ways, although fraught with

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.567
complication, will be
really the foundation for

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:35.067
Wednesday's lecture.&nbsp; Today
we're going to hear more

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:40.767
about the more obvious
negative manifestations of

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:45.100
white reaction to this
New Negro mentality.&nbsp; The

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:53.100
most--the clearest
manifestation of course is

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.300
the rise of the lynch mob,
again the resurrection of

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.800
the Klan.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.400
But from an
institutional standpoint,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.900
from the
standpoint of the state,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.400
the most negative
manifestation of white

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.800
reaction to the New
Negro mentality is federal

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.500
surveillance.&nbsp; The riots
of 1917 and 1919 made white

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.300
politicians nervous.&nbsp;
Property was at stake,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.267
after all.&nbsp; Perhaps it goes
without saying that these

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:26.500
pol--same politicians
easily ignored the real race

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.200
dynamics of the riots, where
white employers and property

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.400
owners, black
and white--well,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.600
black and white
property owners,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.067
in terms of raising
rents--but white employers

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:43.500
and property owners attacked
and organized attacks

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.500
against black residents.&nbsp;
This anxiety is deeply felt

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.100
and broadly felt and becomes
manifest in a very famous

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.267
way with one politician in
particular.&nbsp; The story for

00:05:54.267 --> 00:05:56.400
this person begins in 1919.&nbsp;
The person I'm talking about

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.300
is twenty-four years
old, twenty-four years old,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:07.200
a native of Washington,
D.C.&nbsp; Becomes the head of

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.200
the Department of
Justice's new organization,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.300
the General
Intelligence Division,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.900
the GID.&nbsp; A young man.&nbsp;
His job is to keep tabs on,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.100
and I'm quoting
here, "liberal activity,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.200
 whatever that's going
to mean.&nbsp; Among other

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.767
organizations
being investigated,

00:06:27.767 --> 00:06:29.300
you have a wide range
of black groups that are

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.000
targeted for some sort
of investigation.&nbsp; The

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.367
conservative Black Elks, who
are anything but liberal,

00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:39.300
to the radical and
separatist African Blood

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.867
Brotherhood.&nbsp; The
man in question is J.

00:06:42.867 --> 00:06:49.567
Edgar Hoover.&nbsp; His
leadership of the General

00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:52.500
Intelligence--Intelligence
Division,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.600
parlays himself into the
directorship--directorship

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.800
of the FBI when that
organization was formed.&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.367
And it's a position that he
would hold until his death

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:03.967
in 1972.&nbsp; People have
claimed that he was the most

00:07:03.967 --> 00:07:08.100
powerful person in the
country.&nbsp; And there's a lot

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.200
of merit to that kind of
claim for the way that he

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.300
investigates seemingly
everybody.&nbsp; Now why does

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:23.100
Hoover's foundational moment
matter?&nbsp; It matters in part

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.700
because of Hoover's
worldview.&nbsp; When race riots

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.700
occur in
Washington, D.C., Hoover,

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.300
who is a native of the area,
concluded that their cause

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.700
lay in the, quote,
"series of"--excuse,

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.867
excuse me.&nbsp; "The numerous
assaults committed by

00:07:37.867 --> 00:07:41.200
negroes against white
women."&nbsp; Once again,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.500
the trope appears, the fear
of black male interlopers

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.900
attacking or--or luring
white women.&nbsp; But aside from

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.067
this recurring trope that
demonized black males and

00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:56.367
exalted white women, why
is Hoover's so--story so

00:07:56.367 --> 00:08:01.567
important?&nbsp; It's important
not only because Hoover

00:08:01.567 --> 00:08:04.100
would organize obsessive
campaigns against Martin

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.467
Luther King, Jr., and social
activist groups in the

00:08:07.467 --> 00:08:09.900
1960s--and we'll--we'll
come to this later on in the

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.167
course--because it--but it's
also important because it's

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:16.700
under Hoover's
leadership that the federal

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.100
surveillance of African
Americans starts and its

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.800
most intense focus of this
surveillance rests upon a

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.200
black nationalist Jamaican,
who took up residence in

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.800
Harlem in 1916.&nbsp; And I'm
talking here about Marcus

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.800
Garvey.&nbsp; Garvey's
born in Jamaica in 1887,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:47.400
but he is mainly educated
in London.&nbsp; Now there's no

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.200
little irony in the
fact that this person who

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200
eventual--eventually fights
against the spread of a

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200
white empire that oppresses
black people around the

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.067
world, and who organizes
this fight by calling for

00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:03.167
his own black empire,
there's no little irony in

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:07.000
the fact that he himself
was trained in the seat of

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.300
empire.&nbsp;
Apparently while in London,

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.400
he learned his lessons
well.&nbsp; A colonial subject,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.000
trained in the heart of
the--of colonial control,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.100
who ends up advocating a new
colonial presence.&nbsp; I mean

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.400
in a nutshell, this is
sort of the--the sort of

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.100
fundamental irony
of Marcus Garvey,

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.300
and I'll be expanding upon
it through the course of the

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.300
lecture.&nbsp; Anyway, Garvey's
educated for the most part

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.567
in London and returns
to Jamaica in 1914,

00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:40.700
and he has a plan.&nbsp; Having
learned how to organize

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.500
movements and how--how
empire operated at its core,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.800
he decides in short order to
organize the Universal Negro

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.300
Improvement Association, the
UNIA.&nbsp; In formulating his

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.700
plan for the UNIA,
Garvey was inspired by

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.700
Washington's--Booker T.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.700
Washington's Up
From Slavery.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:12.167
This book, published at
the turn of the century,

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:15.367
but its most famous section
or chapter is the story of

00:10:15.367 --> 00:10:19.567
Washington's famous Atlanta
Cotton Exposition address,

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:22.000
something that Garvey,
sort of from an ideological

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
standpoint, embraced.&nbsp; Now
Garvey's not interested in

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.500
that element of Washington's
plan that called for at

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.200
least temporary
accommodation to the white

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.500
South, but he was
committed ideologically,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.767
deeply so, to Washington's
idea of economic

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:49.767
self-sufficiency.&nbsp; If you
remember back to Washington,

00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:53.667
"in all things truly social,
separate as the fingers."&nbsp;

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.867
Garvey soon realized
that his plan to emancipate

00:11:03.867 --> 00:11:06.800
blacks by
economic empowerment,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.200
that his plan to emancipate
blacks across the globes

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:17.400
with the vehicle of
empire formation,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.767
would not take off in
Jamaica.&nbsp; The platform was

00:11:19.767 --> 00:11:24.567
too small.&nbsp; Two years after
he comes back to Jamaica,

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:28.400
he decides that if he really
wanted to get at the heart

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.000
and soul of blacks
throughout the world,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.067
he had to move his operation
to what was then popularly

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.300
considered the heart
of the black world,

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.300
and that's New York
City, more specifically,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.900
Harlem.&nbsp; Now this is all
a rather new phenomenon,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.067
Harlem, as far as being the
sort of the center of the

00:11:47.067 --> 00:11:50.367
black world, as again
popularly felt.&nbsp; This is a

00:11:50.367 --> 00:11:55.500
direct result of the Great
Migration.&nbsp; And as we'll see

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.100
on--on Wednesday's lecture,
sort of focusing a fair

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.067
amount of what's happening
in Harlem for particular

00:12:02.067 --> 00:12:04.600
reasons.&nbsp; But for the
standpoint of propagating a

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.500
message,
demographics and such,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.667
New York City was the place
to be.&nbsp; Garvey's family had

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:14.467
a background in
typesetting and printing,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.800
and he gets his own
training in publishing,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.100
and quickly produces
a magazine or paper,

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.767
called the Negro World, a
journal that serves as the

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:29.167
mouthpiece for his
nationalist philosophy of

00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:35.067
racial--race pride and
race unity.&nbsp; In short order,

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:38.867
when he moves his
operation to New York City,

00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:41.300
Negro World would have the
second largest circulation

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.300
of black
periodicals in the country,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:50.100
second only to the Chicago
Defender.&nbsp; So it's sort of

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.867
out of the blue, Garvey
steps into the fray and

00:12:55.867 --> 00:13:01.700
becomes incredibly popular,
as does his periodical.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:07.067
Garvey would claim, soon, up
to six million followers.&nbsp;

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.700
Although there were never
nearly that many official

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.700
Garveyites, the best
estimates of official

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.867
followers of
Garvey's movement,

00:13:16.867 --> 00:13:18.567
members of the UNIA,
were around five hundred

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:26.200
thousand.&nbsp; But there's no
doubting the importance of

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.000
the UNIA, or--or the
significance of Garvey

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.900
himself.&nbsp; The UNIA
established laundries,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.800
groceries, and other retail
operations that were by and

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.567
for black people,
or, more accurately,

00:13:40.567 --> 00:13:46.567
UNIA members.&nbsp; The UNIA was
about instilling race pride,

00:13:52.867 --> 00:13:59.267
and Garvey embodied it with
ostentatious displays that

00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:02.300
smacked--more than
smacked of--that,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:08.300
that represented sort of
the logic of--of empire.&nbsp; He

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.967
would organize these parades
with his auxiliaries,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.600
black UNIA members
dressed up in uniforms,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.700
in hierarchy, in
orders, marching in parades,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:32.600
Garvey as the grand
marshal, epaulets,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.100
gold buttons and
trim, plumage,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.067
all the trappings of the
benevolent--benevolent

00:14:40.067 --> 00:14:45.400
emperor.&nbsp; This was a
performance certainly that

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.900
was designed to instill
race pride among sojourning

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:55.967
blacks who were struggling
with city life.&nbsp; Indeed,

00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:59.200
the most popular--or Garvey
and his movement were the

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:05.100
most popular amongst
individuals who were fairly

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.100
recently arrived--arrived to
the cities.&nbsp; The UNIA then

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.667
inspires hope for the future
and also racial solidarity.&nbsp;

00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:22.000
You can go to a safe space,
a UNIA laundry or grocery

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.867
store, or just
another store,

00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:27.600
buy what you need and
believe that you're not

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.300
getting ripped off like you
were if you were going to a

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.867
share--a, a planters' store,
if you were a sharecropper,

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:38.300
or if you're one generation
removed from sharecropping.&nbsp;

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:44.600
You could buy from the race,
be treated with respect,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.300
and be part of something
bigger than yourself.&nbsp; Now

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.300
Garvey's aware that
there's a growing desire for

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.300
self-determination by
oppressed people around the

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:03.300
world, especially after
World War I.&nbsp; And Garvey,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.367
aside from just having these
stores and these parades,

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:15.300
marries this desire for
self-determination with a

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.100
call for blacks to return
to Africa and to build their

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.600
own country.&nbsp; This was
not just the trappings of

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.800
military and of empire in
terms of just what you're

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.767
dressed in, what
you're wearing,

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:34.600
but also a call to actually
create that space back in

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.700
Africa.&nbsp; Garvey first
tries to get permission to

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.700
establish his own
colony in Africa,

00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:46.300
his target is Liberia, but
he's denied permission.&nbsp;

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.800
Upset over the rebuff,
Garvey decides to form

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.967
quasi-militaristic groups
that were designed to kick

00:16:55.967 --> 00:17:00.767
whites out of Africa.&nbsp; He
even declared himself the

00:17:00.767 --> 00:17:03.767
provisional President of
the new Empire of Africa,

00:17:03.767 --> 00:17:05.767
naming potentates
to rule with him,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.567
and creating a nobility
of--of anointed knights.&nbsp; He

00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:14.200
wanted all the sort
of the trappings,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.867
the declarations, of
empire.&nbsp; Maybe this might

00:17:17.867 --> 00:17:23.700
get him there, but to no
avail.&nbsp; But he does organize

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.000
something that, for
a moment it seems,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.800
at least for a
lot of followers,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.267
seems that Garvey might be
more than just about words

00:17:31.267 --> 00:17:37.700
and retail operations,
and this is the Black Star

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.700
Steamship Line.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.167
This is the crown
jewel of Garvey's efforts,

00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:48.967
the UNIA's efforts.&nbsp; Garvey
unfolds his plan in 1919,

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:51.300
again, this
incredibly important year,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.967
this changing notion of
poss--possibility with

00:17:54.967 --> 00:18:01.067
African Americans--unfolds
his plan in 1919 to build

00:18:01.067 --> 00:18:05.800
the steamship line, and he
sees it as representing an

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.900
effort to demonstrate black
self-sufficiency and truly

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.500
the potential for black
nation-building.&nbsp; Now this

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.767
is an era you need to
realize that you built

00:18:18.767 --> 00:18:22.267
nations, you express
international power,

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:29.067
by navies.&nbsp; And Garvey's
idea is eventually to build

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:34.067
his navy and have
that be the vehicle,

00:18:34.067 --> 00:18:39.000
literally and figuratively,
the vehicle for his empire.&nbsp;

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.967
By 1920, the Black Star
Steamship Line is now the

00:18:41.967 --> 00:18:45.800
focus of Garvey's Back to
Africa movement.&nbsp; And he

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.267
starts to sell bonds to
raise money to purchase

00:18:48.267 --> 00:18:54.267
these ships.&nbsp; These ships
would embody black power.&nbsp;

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.167
They would have
all black crews,

00:18:58.167 --> 00:19:01.100
for example.&nbsp; They would be
the means for blacks to get

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.000
to Africa.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.400
They would become the
lynchpin of the global

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.700
economy.&nbsp; Garvey
shares this idea,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.200
this vision,
this excitement,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.000
and within three months
of his first call for

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.600
contributions to
purchase a ship,

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.067
he buys his first ship.&nbsp; It
seems to me--to be that this

00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:30.300
might actually happen, at
least some change.&nbsp; Well,

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.967
the Black Star Steamship
Line quickly becomes

00:19:32.967 --> 00:19:38.967
Garvey's undoing.&nbsp; The
steamship line ends up being

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.300
three ships over the course
of the steamship line's

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:49.800
existence.&nbsp; Garvey
drastically overpaid for

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.267
each of the three ships.&nbsp;
The first ship he probably

00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:55.000
paid eight--eight hundred
percent more than he should

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.267
have.&nbsp; The
captain, as it turns out,

00:19:57.267 --> 00:20:02.067
was taking kickbacks.&nbsp; The
second ship sprang a leak

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:06.500
and sank shortly after the
UNIA purchased it.&nbsp; And the

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.400
third ship blew a boiler on
its maiden voyage and killed

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:15.400
a man.&nbsp; A comedy of errors
and tragedies.&nbsp; But when

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.967
those ships that actually
proved seaworthy for a

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:25.500
little while, when the ships
actually did make it to a

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.167
port of call, traveling up
and down the North American

00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:35.300
seaboard on the East Coast,
thousands of black well

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.700
wish--well wishers
crowded the piers,

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.300
stand on the hillsides,
wanting to catch a glimpse

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.467
of the first all-black crew
that they had ever seen.&nbsp;

00:20:44.967 --> 00:20:47.700
Certainly the Black Star
Line was a complete business

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.467
fiasco, there's no
doubting about that,

00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:55.367
but it was a powerful symbol
for black possibility.&nbsp; For

00:20:55.367 --> 00:20:58.200
that reason alone it
would be important.&nbsp; But the

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.467
importance doesn't end
there.&nbsp; The Black Star Line,

00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:06.200
the business
dealings that it created,

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.700
remain important for
the shady financing that

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.700
eventually gives J.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.767
Edgar Hoover the hook that
he needed to snare Garvey.&nbsp;

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:19.000
We can't forget Hoover
through all of this.&nbsp;

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.200
Garvey's mass popularity
his appeals for race pride,

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.900
his haughty
imperialist style,

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.100
all of these conspire to
make people like Hoover more

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.600
than a little worried.&nbsp; Now
the fact is although that we

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.500
will never know how
many people were actually

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.600
following Garvey, his
movement did represent the

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.667
first organized grassroots
mass protest movement in

00:21:42.667 --> 00:21:46.600
African American history.&nbsp;
It was the first organized

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.900
grassroots mass protest
movement in African American

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.000
history.&nbsp; So if one
were concerned about black

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.800
autonomy, and one were
already convinced that

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.767
blacks,
particularly black males,

00:22:01.767 --> 00:22:04.500
represented a
perpetual threat,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.200
then Garvey's
UNIA, Garvey himself,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.400
would have appeared
terrifying.&nbsp; What was he

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:17.867
going to do?&nbsp; When you
add the specter of Garvey,

00:22:17.867 --> 00:22:20.167
the mass
movement of the UNIA,

00:22:20.167 --> 00:22:26.200
to the violence in 1917 and
1919 ripping through cities

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.100
where the UNIA was
at its most powerful,

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.900
then you would
have been convinced,

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.900
if you were
someone like Hoover,

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.267
that something had to
be done.&nbsp; So Hoover took

00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:42.000
action.&nbsp; He decides he's
going to put Garvey in jail

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.467
and then sets out to find
a justification for his

00:22:44.467 --> 00:22:48.000
arrest.&nbsp; So he knows he's
going to put him in jail;

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.567
he's got to find a way to do
it.&nbsp; The first thing Hoover

00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:58.400
does is hire four black
agents and assign them to

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.067
infiltrate the UNIA.&nbsp;
It's really remarkable,

00:23:03.067 --> 00:23:06.100
the Garvey Papers, it's a
massive collection.&nbsp; Yale

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.967
has it on microfilm, and you
can look at the reports from

00:23:10.967 --> 00:23:14.300
these agents going
back to their superiors,

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.167
bits of
information redacted,

00:23:16.167 --> 00:23:17.800
as we become used to
in our modern world.&nbsp;

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:24.000
The--some--sometimes just
sort of--it's the level of

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.167
silliness about
going to, you know,

00:23:26.167 --> 00:23:28.500
Mrs. Johnson's
last night for,

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.300
you know, for her suspected
UNIA involvement.&nbsp; She made

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.467
a wonderful pie and we
drank tea.&nbsp; I mean this is,

00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:41.100
you know, the extent of
some of the reports.&nbsp; The

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.500
rep--the infiltration
did not get very far.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.300
Hoover then tries to prove
that Garvey was an agent of

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.567
the British or
Canadian governments,

00:23:50.567 --> 00:23:54.100
which made--which would have
made him something like an

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.100
unregistered foreign agent.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.867
I mean, this is
rather stretching things,

00:23:56.867 --> 00:23:58.800
since the British and
Canadian governments really

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.600
aren't such powerful enemies
of the United States,

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.567
but this was still Hoover's
next gambit.&nbsp; It doesn't

00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:12.600
work.&nbsp; Garvey's star is
rising.&nbsp; We're not into the

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.700
1920s.&nbsp; Then Hoover finally
succeeds in getting him

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:21.000
indicted--gets him indicted
on mail fraud charges.&nbsp; Gets

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.900
Garvey thrown in jail in
1925 for five years.&nbsp; But

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.067
before Garvey's term
could be completed,

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:33.500
he's pardoned by President
Calvin Coolidge on the

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.567
condition that he
leaves the country,

00:24:35.567 --> 00:24:39.067
that he's deported as an
undesirable alien at the

00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:45.500
moment of his release from
jail.&nbsp; So Hoover gets mail

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.400
fraud charges
leveled against Garvey in

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.700
twenty-three.&nbsp; He's in jail
in twenty-five.&nbsp; He's out in

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.967
twenty-seven, but he
is sent down to Jamaica

00:24:52.967 --> 00:24:59.200
immediately.&nbsp; With
Garvey's deportation,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.900
federal surveillance of
blacks basically disappears

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.967
until the start of World War
II.&nbsp; And it's really quite

00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:10.500
shocking that it disappears,
because this is an era of

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.900
real radicalism, as you'll
see in the--the Manning

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.900
Marable reader
for this week,

00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:19.800
this week and next week.&nbsp;
This is an era of real

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.900
political radicalism, yet
Hoover was so focused on

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.400
Garvey and his exhortations
of a Back to Africa movement

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.900
and race pride that the
other organizations just

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.800
don't merit his attention,
not nearly to the same level

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.767
of attention.&nbsp;
Once Garvey's gone,

00:25:36.767 --> 00:25:44.000
"the problem" is gone.&nbsp; Now
what are the charges?&nbsp; What

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.700
of the, the--those sort of
steps that got Garvey kicked

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.900
out of the country?&nbsp;
And what about Garvey's

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.900
relationship to other
blacks?&nbsp; I mean he was not

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.100
the only black
leader of this era.&nbsp; And,

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.567
also, what shall we make of
Garvey's political legacy?&nbsp;

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.067
The charges were
literally trumped up,

00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:11.000
but they were actually
basically true.&nbsp; Garvey was

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.800
at best an inept, and
at worst a dishonest,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.100
businessman.&nbsp; He sold bonds
many times over when he

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.600
shouldn't have
been selling them,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.400
to raise money for his
ships.&nbsp; He did commit mail

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.700
fraud.&nbsp; Is it enough to
deport somebody?&nbsp; That's

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:36.400
another issue.&nbsp; What about
his relationship with black

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.400
leaders?&nbsp; Other
black leaders,

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.200
the most prominent ones, did
not have a high opinion of

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.967
Garvey.&nbsp; Du Bois, who
offered information to

00:26:47.967 --> 00:26:52.600
Hoover to try to get Garvey
in trouble.&nbsp; Du Bois called

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.600
him, and I quote, "a
little fat black man,

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.800
ugly, but with intelligent
eyes and a big head."&nbsp; He

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.300
was to Du Bois, quote, "the
most dangerous enemy of the

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.667
Negro race in
American--Americas and the

00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:10.367
world, either a
lunatic or a traitor."&nbsp; A.

00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:12.500
Philip Randolph, a powerful
labor leader that we'll be

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.067
talking about next week,
referred to Garvey--whose,

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:18.800
whose, who is powerful
at this moment in time,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.100
referred to
Garvey as, quote,

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.500
"the supreme negro
Jamaican jackass,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.800
or a monumental monkey, who
is also an unquestionable

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:33.967
fool, an ignoramus."&nbsp;
Why such anger?&nbsp; Jealousy,

00:27:33.967 --> 00:27:36.900
certainly part of the
equation.&nbsp; Du Bois had been

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:43.200
struggling for his entire
adult life to build the kind

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.067
of movement that Garvey
shows up and builds within

00:27:45.067 --> 00:27:46.100
three or four
years.&nbsp; Du Bois,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.100
powerful intellect,
influential editor,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:53.100
but he cannot command the
same kind of numbers and

00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:02.400
followers as Garvey
could.&nbsp; Randolph,

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:08.400
a rising labor leader,
couldn't command the kind of

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:20.400
following and passions that
Garvey could.&nbsp; So certainly

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.767
jealousy, but there's also
an awareness of what they

00:28:26.767 --> 00:28:29.800
saw, what Du Bois
and Randolph saw,

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.500
as limitations to Garvey's
agenda.&nbsp; How was a Back to

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.467
Africa movement really going
to happen?&nbsp; Was it even

00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:45.200
possible?&nbsp; There have been
Back to Africa movements for

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.100
a hundred years
at this point,

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.167
led by black radicals, led
by very conservative whites,

00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:54.667
led by progressive
whites.&nbsp; You know,

00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:57.400
everybody, politically
across the spectrum,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.567
was trying to figure out a
way to get blacks out of the

00:28:59.567 --> 00:29:03.500
country.&nbsp; None
of them worked.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.900
They logistically weren't
feasible.&nbsp; So what's Garvey

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:10.967
selling here?&nbsp; Du Bois and
Randolph says our problems,

00:29:10.967 --> 00:29:14.067
blacks' problems, are here
on this soil.&nbsp; We need to

00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:21.600
solve them here.&nbsp; Du Bois
and Randolph wondered if

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.000
Garvey was merely preying
on the wild aspirations of

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.400
those people who could least
afford to invest their money

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:35.400
in his plan.&nbsp; Garvey raised
money from a lot of recent

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.600
migrants to places like
New York and Chicago,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:44.200
Detroit, people who didn't
have much money at all to

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.900
spend, not extra, not
disposable income.&nbsp; Du Bois

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.300
and Randolph
believed that they,

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.867
in their own separate ways,
were leading the charge to

00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:56.300
care for this most
vulnerable population,

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:05.067
and that Garvey was doing
something different.&nbsp; And

00:30:05.067 --> 00:30:09.000
now what about Garvey's
political legacy?&nbsp; Was it

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.067
radical or was it
conservative?&nbsp; Was Garvey a

00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:17.100
revolutionary,
like Hoover believed,

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:23.567
or was he merely a black
capitalist?&nbsp; Did he want to

00:30:23.567 --> 00:30:26.200
save Africa, or merely
establish economic and

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.467
political control over
part of it?&nbsp; I mean think of

00:30:31.467 --> 00:30:34.600
this--of his militaristic
and imperialist trappings,

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.800
the performance of
his attire during these

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.400
parades.&nbsp; Think of the
rhetoric that I used to

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.000
begin the lecture, "We
demand Africa for the

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Africans."&nbsp; To get at
some of the answers to these

00:30:56.567 --> 00:30:59.967
questions--is
Garvey radical,

00:30:59.967 --> 00:31:04.067
is he conservative,
revolutionary or

00:31:04.067 --> 00:31:09.467
capitalist?&nbsp; Do you want to
save Africa for Africans or

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:12.600
for blacks--black
Americans?--to get at some

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.600
of the answers, it's useful
to--helpful to plumb the

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.267
depths of Garvey's
own publicly offered

00:31:19.267 --> 00:31:23.700
philosophies.&nbsp; These are all
very short excerpts from the

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.900
Manning Marable and
Leith Mullings reader,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.800
but I want to call your
attention to a few choice

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.600
phrases here.&nbsp; On race
pride and race suspicion,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.900
I guess it's a
clumsy way of putting it,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.000
Garvey is dumbfounded by
the white leadership of the

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.500
NAACP.&nbsp; "Du Bois," he said,
"represents a group that

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.100
hates the Negro blood in its
veins and has been working

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.200
subtly to build up a
caste aristocracy that would

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.100
socially divide the race
into two groups: one the

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.000
superior because of
color--of color caste,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.467
and the other the inferior.&nbsp;
Hence the pretentious work

00:32:01.467 --> 00:32:03.267
of the National Association
for the Advancement of

00:32:03.267 --> 00:32:05.300
Colored People."

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.300
Now there's no doubt that
Du Bois--that Du Bois is an

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:12.800
elitist.&nbsp; There's no
doubting that.&nbsp; And that he

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.400
believed that the Talented
Tenth were the people to

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:21.567
save the race, but getting
into political bed with

00:32:21.567 --> 00:32:24.900
these white progressives
Garvey thought was insane.&nbsp;

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.800
"You cannot trust white
people to do the right thing

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.500
in that regard."&nbsp; Du
Bois hated the blood in his

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:39.400
own--the, the quote, "Negro
blood in his own veins."&nbsp; On

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.800
racial self-preservation,
Garvey was against blacks

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.200
fighting for the United
States in World War I.&nbsp; He

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.200
says here, "The first dying
that is to be done by the

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.700
black man in the future
will be done to make himself

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.667
free.&nbsp; And then
when we are finished,

00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:56.400
if we have any
charity to bestow,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.567
we may die for
the white man.

00:32:58.567 --> 00:33:03.667
But as for me, I think I
have stopped dying for him."

00:33:03.667 --> 00:33:06.800
Powerful words.&nbsp; The kind of
words you might hear out of

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.367
a different revolutionary
some forty years later.&nbsp;

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.167
Similar--Similarly, "We
declare that no Negro shall

00:33:16.167 --> 00:33:19.667
engage himself in the battle
for an alien race without

00:33:19.667 --> 00:33:21.667
first attaining the consent
of the leader of the Negro

00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:24.200
people of the world, except
in a matter of national

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.100
self-defense."

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.400
&nbsp;Blacks will not fight
unless the leader of the

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.567
Negro people says they
should fight.&nbsp; That would be

00:33:32.567 --> 00:33:35.100
Garvey.&nbsp; And so
he said that,

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.500
you know, blacks should
not fight for the white man,

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.400
except as a matter
of national defense.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:48.500
So when we do get our land,
our plot and what is or was

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.167
then and still is Liberia,
sort of is his real goal,

00:33:51.167 --> 00:33:56.000
his first goal, then we
fight for self-defense.&nbsp; We

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
don't fight for them.&nbsp;
Speaking about racial pride,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.467
Garvey had much to say:
"We have outgrown slavery,

00:34:05.467 --> 00:34:08.667
 he said, "but our minds
are still enslaved to the

00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:12.200
thinking of the master
race.&nbsp; Now take those kinks

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.900
out of your mind instead of
out of your hair.&nbsp; You are

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.800
capable of--of all that
is common to men of other

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.967
races.&nbsp; We have a beautiful
history and we shall create

00:34:21.967 --> 00:34:26.400
another one in the future.&nbsp;
The faith we have is the

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.067
faith that will ultimately
take us back to that ancient

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:32.267
place, that ancient position
that we once occupied when

00:34:32.267 --> 00:34:34.267
Ethiopia was in her glory."

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.900
Can't trust whites, you
can't fight for whites,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.700
you need to recognize the
glory of our own past.&nbsp; And

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:51.267
if this sounds a bit like
the civilizationist rhetoric

00:34:51.267 --> 00:34:54.200
that I was talking
about two weeks or so ago,

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.100
you're exactly right.&nbsp;
Garvey was a civilizationist

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.100
in this way.&nbsp; "No
Negro," he said,

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.600
"let him be
American, European,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.200
West Indian or African,
shall be truly respected

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.600
until the race as a
whole has emancipated itself

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.600
through self-achievement
and progress from universal

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.700
prejudice.&nbsp; The Negro
will have to build his own

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.300
government,
industry, art, science,

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.000
literature and culture
before the world will stop

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.900
to consider
him.&nbsp; Until then,

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.300
we are--we are but wards
of a superior race and

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.400
civilization and
the outcasts of a

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:31.600
standard--outcasts of a
standard social system.&nbsp; The

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.100
race needs
workers at this time,

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.800
not plagiarists,
copyists and mere imitators,

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.167
but men and women who
are able to create,

00:35:39.167 --> 00:35:43.000
to originate and improve
and thus make an independent

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.600
racial
contriba--contribution to

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.700
the world and civilization."

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.900
The power is within
African Americans,

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.800
but they aren't expressing
it.&nbsp; And when they do tap

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.267
into those great things
from their own racial past,

00:35:57.267 --> 00:36:01.200
recognize their long history
of civilizationist behavior,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.700
looking back in antiquity,
when they take the kinks out

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.300
of their mind instead
of out of their hair,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.400
then they will rise up,
demonstrate their greatness

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.200
to the world, be respected,
have their nation,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.000
have their civilization,
and as part of this,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
have their king.&nbsp; That would
be Garvey.&nbsp; Now just as

00:36:28.667 --> 00:36:34.667
Garvey wasn't the only race
leader operating in this

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.000
sort of trying to
save the race mode,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.700
you have Du Bois and you'll
have--you'll learn more

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.700
about A.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.267
Philip Randolph next
week.&nbsp; There was another

00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:51.400
charismatic individual at
the same time operating,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.700
another African American,
who's really operating at

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.000
the other end of a sort of
spectrum of a sense from

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.100
Marcus Garvey, but also
tremendously popular.&nbsp; His

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.667
name's Father Divine.&nbsp; Well
that's his popular name.&nbsp;

00:37:04.667 --> 00:37:06.700
His birth name
is George Baker,

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:12.700
known as Father Divine, and
also known by his followers

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:22.800
as "God."&nbsp; Father
Divine was born,

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.800
excuse me, was head of
the Peace Mission Movement,

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.467
that becomes very popular
during this era.&nbsp; But where

00:37:30.467 --> 00:37:36.067
Garvey's UNIA was
absolutely monoracial,

00:37:36.067 --> 00:37:42.000
it was black only, Divine's
was absolutely interracial.&nbsp;

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.200
In its very structure, black
and white come together.&nbsp;

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.900
Now while historians are
learning more about the--the

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.800
women in the UNIA and the
very important roles that

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.600
they played, from the
standpoint of the public

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.300
perception of the UNIA,
it's a very male ordered and

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.200
dominated organization.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.700
Father Divine is a very
different sort of thing,

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.467
the Peace Mission Movement.&nbsp;
He relies on his Angels to

00:38:08.467 --> 00:38:14.100
do a lot of work, black
women and white women.&nbsp; Now

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.367
there were some
similarities.&nbsp; The most

00:38:17.367 --> 00:38:21.400
important for our purposes
right now is that both UNIA

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.267
and the Peace Mission
Movement were profoundly

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:25.600
self-help in
their orientation.

00:38:27.667 --> 00:38:30.367
And it is in this way
that Father Divine,

00:38:30.367 --> 00:38:36.300
like Garvey, was deemed
a threat--a threat to

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:42.667
authorities.&nbsp; He's deemed a
threat because he represents

00:38:42.667 --> 00:38:48.700
to so many, black autonomy.&nbsp;
He's also deemed a threat

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.200
because he consorts openly
with white women in his

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.900
organization, has white
women involved in such

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.200
prominent positions.&nbsp;
Now quickly here,

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.467
who was Father Divine and
what did he do actually?&nbsp;

00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:08.900
His early history is murky.&nbsp;
He's an itinerant preacher

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.100
who extolled the virtues of
what was called New Thought,

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.700
the power of positive
thinking regimen.&nbsp; That can

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.500
be seen as a precursor
of sorts to the New Age

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.900
ideologies of the 1980s.&nbsp;
God was in every person,

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.500
according to
Divine's philosophy,

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.700
but he was perfectly
manifested in Divine

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:29.267
himself.&nbsp; Divine
advocated, as I said before,

00:39:29.267 --> 00:39:32.700
interracial life,
strict celibacy,

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.600
communal living,
and most famously,

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.967
communal feasts.&nbsp; He was
known for serving feasts

00:39:39.967 --> 00:39:43.900
every Sunday at his various
peace missions that were

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.400
around the country,
and this was a national

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.867
organization.&nbsp; And these
feasts would run all day

00:39:49.867 --> 00:39:53.500
long with seemingly
endless supplies of food,

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.167
available to anybody
who wanted to come by,

00:39:56.167 --> 00:39:57.900
as long as he stayed
for the meal and for some

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:03.100
proselytizing.&nbsp; Divine
did not represent a Back to

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:08.100
Africa movement.&nbsp; He's
very Victorian in his style.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:14.100
But he was determined
to support materially,

00:40:16.467 --> 00:40:19.700
and also from the
standpoint of faith,

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.967
African Americans who were
overwhelmingly the people he

00:40:21.967 --> 00:40:26.700
was serving, during this
age of great instability and

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:32.700
change.&nbsp; Garvey sees a
threat in Father Divine,

00:40:35.667 --> 00:40:39.500
and he attacks Divine for
preaching race suicide,

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:43.000
celibacy and interracial
relationships.&nbsp; You don't

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.567
get more black babies
if you have interracial

00:40:47.567 --> 00:40:51.700
relationships, and also
if you're really preaching

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:58.867
celibacy.&nbsp; The problem is,
is that many of Garvey's

00:40:58.867 --> 00:41:05.000
followers also followed the
Peace Mission Movement.&nbsp; But

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.167
you can't reconcile the two
from the standpoint of their

00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:13.167
ideologies.&nbsp; How do you make
sense of it?&nbsp; You make sense

00:41:17.867 --> 00:41:21.400
of it in light
of the migration,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.400
the violence of the era, and
the increasing poverty of

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.400
the era: overcrowded
cities, slum lords,

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.400
black and white,
charging exorbitant rents,

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:34.400
a lack of support, despite
the fact you might be

00:41:36.967 --> 00:41:41.300
getting four dollars a day,
a lack of institutional and

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:47.067
structural support
for African American

00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:51.167
communities.&nbsp; Garvey gave
hope to African Americans

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:53.067
who were poor
and struggling,

00:41:53.067 --> 00:41:56.400
new to the city.&nbsp; He gave
them safe places to conduct

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.100
commerce.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:03.500
Divine tapped into a sense
of a--a larger belonging,

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.400
of something much
greater than the individual,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.600
to something
metaphysical perhaps,

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:16.267
and he fed people.&nbsp; So
thinking about Garvey and

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.300
Divine and how to make
sense of these two different

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.700
ideologies--one
race, interracial,

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:28.700
Back to Africa, taking care
of business here-- it sort

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:33.800
of undergirds the sense of
flux that the society's in

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:40.000
at the moment.&nbsp; People are
being opportunistic on the

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.500
ground, trying to find a
way to make ends meet,

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.000
to try to find a
better way of living,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.867
better quality of
life.&nbsp; Exhausted by external

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:53.000
threats, whether it's
federal surveillance or the

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.400
Klan or simple,
systematic segregation,

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:03.400
blacks were scrambling.&nbsp;
Now it doesn't help that in

00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:08.367
addition to this federal
surveillance and the rise of

00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:10.967
the Klan, Garvey actually
goes to negotiate with the

00:43:10.967 --> 00:43:15.800
Klan, with Klan leadership,
trying to get their support

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.900
for Back to Africa
politics.&nbsp; If you believe

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.400
the reports, the leaders of
the Klan and Garvey actually

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.800
admired each other about
at least being honest,

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.500
about not liking
the other person.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.867
And they can find a way to
work together to get them

00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:34.867
out of each other's hair.&nbsp;
Divine himself courts white

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.300
leaders of a very
different type than Klan,

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:44.000
the people with money who
bolster the Peace Mission

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.267
Movement's various
holdings.&nbsp; They own

00:43:46.267 --> 00:43:48.700
all--they, they provide all
their own food.&nbsp; They own

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.300
all their own property.&nbsp;
They're a cash and carry

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.067
operation.&nbsp; A lot of it
was coming from white

00:43:53.067 --> 00:43:57.167
benefactors.&nbsp; So you
have this curious mix of

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:58.700
high-level interactions
between blacks and whites in

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:05.367
Garvey and in the Peace
Mission Movement.&nbsp; You have

00:44:05.367 --> 00:44:09.500
the erasure of that
interaction in the--in the

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.567
UNIA movement, because
you couldn't trust whites,

00:44:11.567 --> 00:44:15.200
actually.&nbsp; You have the
embracing of it in the Peace

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.000
Mission Movement,
interra--interracial support

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.300
and cooperation.&nbsp;
You have an extensive,

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:25.300
a wide scope of interactions
when you sort of throw the

00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:33.267
veil back from
all of this stuff,

00:44:33.267 --> 00:44:39.200
between whites and blacks
during this era.&nbsp; Despite

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:45.267
the popularity of the UNIA,
despite the racial violence,

00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:48.567
there is a great
amount of exchange,

00:44:48.567 --> 00:44:51.067
politically, socially,
and culturally.&nbsp; And this

00:44:51.067 --> 00:44:52.700
cultural exchange is
where we're going to pick up

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:58.700
matters on Wednesday.&nbsp; And
that's when I'll see you

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.500
again.&nbsp; Thank you very much.

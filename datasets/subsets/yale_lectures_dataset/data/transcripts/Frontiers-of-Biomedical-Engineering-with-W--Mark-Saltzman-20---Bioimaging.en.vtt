Professor Mark Saltzman:
Okay.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.630
Well, this week we're going to
talk about biomedical imaging.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.348
You know from the first
lectures I mentioned that one of

00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:23.931
the biggest advances in
biomedical engineering was the

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:27.650
development of systems for
looking inside the body.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.641
That's what we're going to talk
about this week,

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.100
sort of what's the physics
behind some of these systems,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.342
how do they work,
what are their limitations,

00:00:34.342 --> 00:00:37.350
and what are the opportunities
that each of them present?

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.454
Again, like almost every week's
subject, this one could take up

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:44.289
a whole course.
In fact, there's three or four

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.880
courses on biomedical imagining
that are offered here at Yale.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.922
We're just going to scratch the
surface of it,

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:54.776
but what I hope to do is give
you some sense for how these

00:00:54.776 --> 00:00:58.303
different modes of imaging work,
why they work,

00:00:58.303 --> 00:01:01.974
why they allow you to see
inside the human body,

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:06.505
and then what the limitations
of each particular technology

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.209
is.
These are the kinds of

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:10.619
questions that I hope we'll be
able to answer by the end of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.030
this lecture and next lecture.
What is an image?

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.135
Most of you could answer that
probably now,

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:16.989
but images come in different
forms.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:19.860
Why is imaging so important to
medicine?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.499
You probably already know,
either from what you've read in

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.989
the past or from your own
experience.

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:28.058
Most of us have had,
at some point,

00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:31.646
by the time you're as old you
are, you've had an image taken

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:33.410
of your body,
a medical image,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.849
usually an X-ray.
You know something about why

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.128
it's so important,
but we'll try to amplify on

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:44.140
what you already know.
What technologies are available?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.298
We're going to survey the
different techniques that can be

00:01:47.298 --> 00:01:49.459
used and that are used most
commonly.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.224
It's a very rapidly developing
field and almost every year

00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:55.800
there are new innovations in
imaging,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.111
sometimes even new methods that
are introduced,

00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:05.079
and that change the way we can
see inside the body.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.673
I'm going to talk about sort of
a snap shot of what's available

00:02:08.673 --> 00:02:11.461
now, and as I said,
illustrate or talk about what

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.169
some of the problems are or
challenges with each,

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:17.689
what are the limitations in
particular.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:24.577
An image is a visual
representation of some

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:33.860
measurable property of a person,
an object, or a phenomenon.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.565
We're going to be thinking
about medical imaging,

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:40.060
so we're going to be thinking
mainly about images of people.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.617
Images can be formed and
displayed in different ways

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:47.663
depending on properties of the
object and properties of the

00:02:47.663 --> 00:02:51.639
imaging system that you're using
to create the image.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.355
You're familiar with certain
kinds of images,

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:57.750
you've all probably taken a
photograph with a camera.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.724
Photography has changed
dramatically since you were

00:03:01.724 --> 00:03:06.256
born, it used to be all on film
and now it's almost all on

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:09.288
digital.
These are different ways of

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:12.217
capturing the same thing.
A photograph is a

00:03:12.217 --> 00:03:15.435
representation of what you can
see, it's a representation of

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:17.889
how visible light reflects off
of objects.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.500
So, you see the outlines of the
objects, and their colors,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.414
and their textures,
but it's basically a

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:29.087
representation of how visible
light is interacting with some

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:30.489
object.
An X-ray,

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.647
on the other hand,
shows you something that you

00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:35.403
can't see on your own.
It allows you to see inside the

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:37.988
body.
This is because it's not using

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:41.784
visible light which bounces off
of objects like us,

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:46.340
but it's using X-ray radiation
which is able to penetrate the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.051
body.
By taking a picture of how

00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:53.329
these particular forms of
electromagnetic radiation called

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.612
X-rays,
by taking a picture of how it

00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:58.414
penetrates through the body,
you can get an image that

00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:00.740
represents something about
what's inside.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.578
The challenge is to know,
because you understand the

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:08.092
physics of the radiation,
in this case X-rays,

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:12.096
and you understand the
equipment that's used to collect

00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:15.422
the image,
you should be able to interpret

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:20.148
from your understanding of those
things, what it is that you're

00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:23.496
seeing inside the body.
Of course, television is a

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:26.230
different kind of image
presented in a different way,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.279
but another image of something
that we can already see.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:33.005
Two kinds of imaging
really, images that represent to

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:36.997
us maybe not exactly the way we
see it but things that we can

00:04:36.997 --> 00:04:40.049
see,
and images that represent to us

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:45.250
things we can't see but put it
in a form that we can interpret.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.725
So, that's just what this says
here, that some images you're

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:52.023
just trying to collect and
record what it is that you can

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:55.734
see so that you can look back at
it later and remind yourself of

00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:59.189
what it was that you saw.
Other imaging systems are

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:02.251
really transducers,
they're converting something

00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.509
that you can't see into
something that you can.

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.189
We talked about transduction
several weeks ago now.

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.983
We talked about cell
communication and the concept of

00:05:12.983 --> 00:05:17.360
transduction converting one kind
of a signal into another.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.726
In this case,
converting a signal that

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:26.369
measures something you can't see
but converts it into something

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:29.324
that you can see.
To understand this,

00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:31.594
I have to review for you
something that most of you

00:05:31.594 --> 00:05:34.095
probably already know,
at least at some level,

00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:36.529
and that's the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.277
This is a representation of the
variation in properties of

00:05:41.277 --> 00:05:45.073
electromagnetic radiation.
Certain forms of

00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:50.103
electromagnetic radiation are
apparent to us because our

00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:54.006
retinas can detect it.
That's the visible part of the

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:57.644
spectrum which I've shown here.
Now, what this shows is the

00:05:57.644 --> 00:06:01.897
entire electromagnetic spectrum
arranged on a scale from very

00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:05.230
short wavelength up to very long
wavelength,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.193
and these are in centimeters.
The visible part of the

00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:14.133
spectrum is around a micron or
so, or slightly less than a

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:17.584
micron.
It's around 400 nanometers to

00:06:17.584 --> 00:06:21.149
700 nanometers is the visible
spectrum.

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.199
Now, why is this visible
spectrum?

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.650
Because when radiation with
this wavelength hits your eye,

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.413
it makes a change in the cells
inside your eye and allows your

00:06:32.413 --> 00:06:36.106
retina to make an image.
It's only light of those

00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:39.997
particular wavelengths that can
interact productively with this

00:06:39.997 --> 00:06:43.574
particular special biological
object called the retina and

00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:46.209
that's all the light that we can
see.

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:49.143
There's electromagnetic
radiation of all different

00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:51.690
wavelengths outside of the
visible spectrum.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.039
In fact, one of the things you
should notice here is that the

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.555
visible spectrum is only a small
piece of the entire spectrum of

00:06:58.555 --> 00:07:01.420
electromagnetic radiation.
You know this already.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.496
There are longer wavelengths,
there's longer wavelength

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:09.934
radiation called infrared.
It has wavelengths that are

00:07:09.934 --> 00:07:13.550
longer than the--in the visible
spectrum.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.250
You can't see these but some
cameras can see infrared.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.384
That's how if you--when you
watch the films from the war in

00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:30.050
Iraq where they have these sort
of heat visualization goggles,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.040
they're looking at infrared
wavelengths.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.080
There's something in the
goggles that is sensitive to

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.413
infrared light and it converts
it into visible wavelengths

00:07:40.413 --> 00:07:43.141
which you can see.
Have you ever seen

00:07:43.141 --> 00:07:46.154
satellite pictures where--they
used to do this,

00:07:46.154 --> 00:07:49.757
oil companies or electric
companies would take a picture

00:07:49.757 --> 00:07:54.459
of neighborhoods from the sky,
infrared.

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:59.226
Infrared radiation is
associated with heated objects,

00:07:59.226 --> 00:08:04.633
so the higher the temperature
of an object the more infrared

00:08:04.633 --> 00:08:08.850
radiation of a higher wavelength
it emits.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.840
If you take a picture of a
neighborhood at night using an

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.151
infrared camera you can see how
much heat is being emitted from

00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:17.881
all the different houses.
You can identify ones that

00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:19.745
don't have enough insulation,
for example,

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:22.518
or ones that are wasting heat
because they're emitting it at a

00:08:22.518 --> 00:08:25.672
higher temperature.
These are some examples of

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:30.035
using a wavelength that our eye
can't detect but getting

00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:33.541
information from it.
You also are familiar with

00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:36.401
ultraviolet radiation,
so these are wavelengths that

00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:38.700
are shorter than the visible
spectrum.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.083
Shorter than the part of the
spectrum that you can see,

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:45.090
but you can experience the
effects of electro--of

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.536
ultraviolet radiation.
If you're out in the sun too

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:51.779
long, your skin turns red,
and you get a sunburn.

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:55.516
That's because your skin
absorbed ultraviolet radiation

00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:58.629
created a change in the cells of
your skin.

00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:03.580
Different biological effect,
you're seeing it in a sense.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.941
You're only seeing it where the
sun hit not where your body was

00:09:07.941 --> 00:09:11.879
in shadow, but you can detect
that radiation that way.

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:15.655
If we look at the whole
spectrum, I'm going to go back a

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:19.687
slide now, and this was arranged
with the long wavelengths up at

00:09:19.687 --> 00:09:22.184
this end,
the short wavelengths down at

00:09:22.184 --> 00:09:25.570
this end, the other picture is
arranged in just the opposite

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.440
way with the long wavelengths
down at this end,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.261
radio waves,
microwaves, infrared waves,

00:09:32.261 --> 00:09:36.966
the visible spectrum,
ultraviolet X-ray and gamma

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:39.786
ray.
These are long wavelengths

00:09:39.786 --> 00:09:42.450
preceding to shorter
wavelengths.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.379
As the wavelength changes so
the does the frequency.

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:49.586
They're inversely related,
so as the wavelength goes down

00:09:49.586 --> 00:09:53.879
the frequency goes up.
The frequency is related to how

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:58.556
much energy these waves contain.
The short wavelength,

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:03.669
X-rays, and gamma rays carry
high amounts of energy.

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:07.440
Ultraviolet rays carry more
energy than visible rays.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:16.608
Frequency goes up as wavelength
goes down, and so does the

00:10:16.608 --> 00:10:23.053
energy of the radiation.
This diagram here shows you

00:10:23.053 --> 00:10:25.610
roughly how big is the
wavelength.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.432
For radio waves these are very
long waves that are the size of

00:10:30.432 --> 00:10:34.206
buildings or bigger than people.
Microwaves are shorter,

00:10:34.206 --> 00:10:37.522
they're the size of an insect;
infrared waves shorter than

00:10:37.522 --> 00:10:40.705
that, the size of a pinpoint.
The visible rays,

00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:44.414
the ones that our retina can
detect are about the size of

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:46.179
cells.
Bacteria, for example,

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:49.324
or protozoa;
ultraviolet rays the size of

00:10:49.324 --> 00:10:54.497
molecules, and then X-rays and
gamma rays are sub-molecular,

00:10:54.497 --> 00:10:58.943
they're subatomic in size.
Because of that they have

00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:03.129
special properties and they can
actually change atoms.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:07.088
When X-rays and gamma rays
are absorbed into materials

00:11:07.088 --> 00:11:11.255
because their wavelengths are
smaller than the wavelengths of

00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:13.830
atoms,
or nuclei, they can actually

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.441
interact with atoms and nuclei.
One of the things that X-rays

00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:23.960
and gamma rays can do that other
rays don't is ionize an object.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.776
They can actually eject
electrons from the atoms inside

00:11:28.776 --> 00:11:33.543
of a material and create ions.
The ions that they create are

00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:37.674
often reactive.
This is what makes these short

00:11:37.674 --> 00:11:43.311
wavelength, high energy forms of
radiation, biologically

00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:49.152
hazardous because they are in
the category called ionizing

00:11:49.152 --> 00:11:52.966
radiation.
When they hit your body they

00:11:52.966 --> 00:11:55.731
can produce changes,
in particular,

00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:58.740
produce atoms--or ions from
atoms.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.519
These ions can further react;
sometimes they even react with

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:08.783
DNA inside cells and cause
mutations in DNA as a result of

00:12:08.783 --> 00:12:14.097
chemical reactions that occur.
Because of this we want to

00:12:14.097 --> 00:12:19.592
limit the exposure of our bodies
to things like X-rays and gamma

00:12:19.592 --> 00:12:21.757
rays.
I'm going to talk about,

00:12:21.757 --> 00:12:24.221
in the course of the lecture
today and tomorrow,

00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:27.209
many of the ways that X-rays
and gamma rays are useful for

00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:30.178
medical imaging.
That's not surprising because I

00:12:30.178 --> 00:12:33.733
already say these are short
wavelength, high energy forms of

00:12:33.733 --> 00:12:37.470
radiation that can penetrate
through objects fairly easily.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.730
Things that penetrate are
useful imaging what's inside.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.486
The disadvantage of their
penetration is that they can

00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:48.667
also create ions and biological
damage so we'll keep that in

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:52.397
mind as we go through.
You know that not only ionizing

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.590
radiation causes biological
damage.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.347
I also mention the biological
effects of over exposure to

00:12:58.347 --> 00:13:01.601
ultraviolet light,
which you've probably all

00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:05.960
experienced through sunburn or
some other over exposure.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.964
These aren't the only kinds of
rays that can have a biological

00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:14.100
effect, but they're the ones
that we're most concerned about.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.823
Questions about that?
This is probably a picture that

00:13:17.823 --> 00:13:21.433
you've seen before,
if not I encourage you to

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:26.520
review sort of the physics of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:33.783
Let's talk about X-rays and
that is the form of medical

00:13:33.783 --> 00:13:36.399
imaging that's been around for
the longest.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:40.241
Before X-rays,
as your chapter in your book

00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:45.730
describes, physicians and
doctors relied on hand drawings.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.437
They would draw things so that
they could describe what they

00:13:48.437 --> 00:13:50.409
saw to others,
or so they could remember.

00:13:50.409 --> 00:13:53.487
If a patient came in and had
something abnormal they might

00:13:53.487 --> 00:13:56.726
draw a sketch of it in your--in
their notebooks so they would

00:13:56.726 --> 00:13:58.940
remember how it looked for next
time.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.610
Photography changed that
because you could take pictures

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.330
of things and you could remember
them without drawing.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.429
But we still couldn't look
inside the body.

00:14:09.429 --> 00:14:12.350
Well, you could but not really
very well on living people.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.941
A lot about what we knew about
the inside of the body was from

00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:21.231
the science of dissection and
looking inside the bodies of

00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:23.834
cadavers,
people after they've died and

00:14:23.834 --> 00:14:26.019
learning about their anatomy
that way.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:28.403
We knew something about that
but we weren't able to look

00:14:28.403 --> 00:14:31.214
inside a living body.
This--Wilhelm Roentgen

00:14:31.214 --> 00:14:35.400
changed that and Roentgen was a
physicist who discovered that

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.750
X-rays could penetrate through
solid objects.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.769
He announced that discovery in
1895, he did an experiment which

00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:48.465
is shown in a diagram in your
book, where he put objects in

00:14:48.465 --> 00:14:52.930
front an X-ray source.
He was able to show that these

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.652
X-rays would pass through the
object and he could detect them

00:14:57.652 --> 00:15:02.043
on the other side with a film.
Here's two useful properties of

00:15:02.043 --> 00:15:05.340
X-rays, one is they can
penetrate through solid objects;

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:11.320
the second is that they can
expose film.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.360
Film, like photographic film,
is sensitive to X-rays.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.665
Because of this,
then you can imagine taking a

00:15:18.665 --> 00:15:22.779
picture of how these rays pass
through a solid object.

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:26.034
Now, the other thing that's
interesting about X-rays is that

00:15:26.034 --> 00:15:29.029
they pass through some solid
objects better than others.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:32.769
The more dense the object is,
the less radiation,

00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:35.730
X-ray radiation that passes
through.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:41.607
If you expose an X-ray beam on
an object that's solid at some

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:47.009
parts and hollow in the others,
X-rays are going to pass easily

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:51.070
through the hollow part and not
so easily through the solid

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.933
part.
The amount of X-ray radiation

00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:58.698
that goes through an object is
related to the density through

00:15:58.698 --> 00:16:03.105
which that X-ray penetrated.
It's these properties that made

00:16:03.105 --> 00:16:06.783
it good for taking images.
By--after he discovered that

00:16:06.783 --> 00:16:11.175
X-rays could penetrate through
objects, it didn't him very long

00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:15.000
to say well if it penetrates
through solid objects like

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.359
bricks and boards,
maybe it'll penetrate through a

00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:21.149
person as well and took some of
the first images,

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:24.994
X-ray images of people by
looking at the hand,

00:16:24.994 --> 00:16:28.717
for example.
He won the first Nobel Prize in

00:16:28.717 --> 00:16:32.624
physics for that discovery.
It was--one of the things

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:35.535
you could take from this,
from the time that he first

00:16:35.535 --> 00:16:39.008
announced in 1896 until the time
he won what's come to be known

00:16:39.008 --> 00:16:42.200
as the highest prize in science
took only six years.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.178
People recognized immediately
the value of this approach,

00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:49.659
particularly this approach for
medical imaging.

00:16:49.659 --> 00:16:53.005
Now, the ray that he discovered
we now call the X-ray,

00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:56.665
initially it was called the
Roentgen Ray because he was the

00:16:56.665 --> 00:17:00.432
one that discovered it.
There are some countries that

00:17:00.432 --> 00:17:03.133
still refer to X-rays as
Roentgen Rays,

00:17:03.133 --> 00:17:07.257
and so you might hear that
nomenclature if you travel or if

00:17:07.257 --> 00:17:12.380
you're reading,
particularly in older textbooks.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.812
How does it work?
Here was the first kind of

00:17:14.812 --> 00:17:16.980
experiment that I described
earlier.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.193
An X-ray source here,
the X-ray source is emitting

00:17:20.193 --> 00:17:22.619
X-rays in all different
directions.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:27.408
Some of them would impinge on
this object, and depending on

00:17:27.408 --> 00:17:32.115
the density of the material
within inside this object some

00:17:32.115 --> 00:17:36.904
of the X-rays would be absorbed
and some of them would pass

00:17:36.904 --> 00:17:39.540
through.
In a dense part of the object,

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.007
the X-rays would be absorbed,
in a less dense part,

00:17:42.007 --> 00:17:44.029
more of the X-rays would pass
through.

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:48.290
If you put a piece of film or
some kind of a detector behind

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:52.190
the object then you could create
basically a shadow.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.957
Just like a shadow when
you're standing on the street

00:17:55.957 --> 00:17:59.460
and the sun is up here,
the light doesn't pass through

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.283
you, and so what you see on the
ground behind you is the sun all

00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:07.045
around but a shadow where your
body did not allow the radiation

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:10.832
to pass through.
In this case you'd see a shadow

00:18:10.832 --> 00:18:13.191
of this object.
It could be a more

00:18:13.191 --> 00:18:16.492
sophisticated shadow in some
ways, because the X-rays can

00:18:16.492 --> 00:18:20.266
penetrate somewhat through dense
material and even better through

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:24.134
less dense material.
The shadow would be light where

00:18:24.134 --> 00:18:29.001
there was density in the object
and it would be dark where there

00:18:29.001 --> 00:18:32.710
was hollowness or less density
in the object.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.599
Make sense?
In this way,

00:18:34.599 --> 00:18:38.886
an X-ray is a shadow,
it's an inverse image of the

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:42.559
density through which the X-ray
passed.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:46.945
The diagram over here shows
you a more sophisticated setup

00:18:46.945 --> 00:18:50.755
and the kind of setup that's
used for X-ray imaging in

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:54.356
patients.
You have an X-ray source and so

00:18:54.356 --> 00:18:57.539
X-rays are emitted from this
source.

00:18:57.539 --> 00:19:00.882
If you didn't confine those
X-rays in some ways they would

00:19:00.882 --> 00:19:04.696
be emitted in all directions.
You confine it so that X-rays

00:19:04.696 --> 00:19:08.772
are only emitted from one side.
You let that pass through a

00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:12.586
filter because these sources of
X-ray generation are not

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:16.539
perfect, they generate waves of
different wavelengths.

00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:20.202
So, through a filter that only
lets X-rays pass through,

00:19:20.202 --> 00:19:22.799
through a device called a
collimator.

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:26.487
A collimator is a physical
object that basically just

00:19:26.487 --> 00:19:30.443
straightens out a beam.
If I had a source of

00:19:30.443 --> 00:19:35.082
radiation here and it was
emitting X-rays they would

00:19:35.082 --> 00:19:39.990
radiate in all directions.
I could put something that was

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.529
X-ray dense behind it and now
they would emit to the front.

00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:47.881
What I would like is if I'm
going to take an image of

00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:51.490
someone, if I want to take an
image of me for example,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.104
I would like all those X-rays
to pass straight through me so

00:19:55.104 --> 00:19:58.779
that I knew what direction all
of the rays were traveling.

00:19:58.779 --> 00:20:03.071
When I tried to interpret what
was on the film there'd be a one

00:20:03.071 --> 00:20:07.501
to one correlation between where
the X-ray hit the film and where

00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:11.220
it went through my body.
If I've got X-rays coming from

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.425
all different directions,
then that's going to blur the

00:20:14.425 --> 00:20:16.299
image.
You need to straighten it

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:18.792
out so the X-rays go in one
direction and that's what a

00:20:18.792 --> 00:20:21.857
collimator does.
It's shown as a hole here but

00:20:21.857 --> 00:20:25.854
really it's a sheet with many
small pinholes and these

00:20:25.854 --> 00:20:30.606
pinholes only allow X-rays to go
through if they're going in the

00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:34.478
right direction.
Ones that come at an angle like

00:20:34.478 --> 00:20:38.760
this are going to bounce off,
but X-rays that come straight

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.674
through are going to pass
straight through and hit the

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:45.319
object.
The object is the patient,

00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:48.838
so I'm standing here,
and there's something behind me

00:20:48.838 --> 00:20:52.559
that's going to detect the
X-rays that pass through.

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:56.074
That something behind is this,
there's a grid also to prevent

00:20:56.074 --> 00:20:59.471
scatter, to only collect the
X-rays that are passing in the

00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:02.927
right direction because some of
those X-rays might have been

00:21:02.927 --> 00:21:06.500
deflected as they passed through
the object through me.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.485
I only want to collect the ones
that are going in one direction,

00:21:10.485 --> 00:21:14.027
so that I will know where the
anatomical object they pass

00:21:14.027 --> 00:21:17.901
through are.
That hits a fluorescent screen,

00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:23.255
and the fluorescent screen is a
special material that emits

00:21:23.255 --> 00:21:27.696
light when X-rays hit it.
An X-ray hits the fluorescent

00:21:27.696 --> 00:21:31.153
screen, it generates a lot of
light right in that spot,

00:21:31.153 --> 00:21:33.650
and this detector detects the
light.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:38.720
The fluorescent screen
amplifies the X-ray signal.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.468
Several photons of X-ray hit,
they generate fluorescence,

00:21:44.468 --> 00:21:49.325
and they expose the detector.
Now, in the old days this

00:21:49.325 --> 00:21:52.329
used to be really film,
X-ray film, photographic film

00:21:52.329 --> 00:21:55.738
that was sensitive to X-rays and
you would--the detector was

00:21:55.738 --> 00:21:59.609
really a piece of film that you
would take out of the machine.

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:04.479
You would develop it with
chemicals, the same way you

00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:08.880
develop--any other kind of
photographic film.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.745
Now, there are detectors that
are electronic and so you can

00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:13.920
detect things electronically
without film.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.324
If you have an X-ray though you
probably--if you have one at

00:22:20.324 --> 00:22:22.390
home an X-ray that your parents
gave you,

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:27.662
say you're going off to college
take your chest X-ray--anybody

00:22:27.662 --> 00:22:30.436
bring one?
Well, if you did it would be

00:22:30.436 --> 00:22:32.360
probably a real piece of film.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.508
X-rays are formed from high
energy radiation,

00:22:40.508 --> 00:22:44.593
an inverse shadow is created
because X-rays pass through less

00:22:44.593 --> 00:22:48.905
dense areas easier.
What's it going to pass through

00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:53.067
in the body if you do a chest
X-ray of my chest,

00:22:53.067 --> 00:22:56.432
for example,
where will the X-rays pass

00:22:56.432 --> 00:23:00.555
through the most easily?
Well, they'll pass through the

00:23:00.555 --> 00:23:02.369
lungs, the lungs is primarily
air;

00:23:02.369 --> 00:23:07.410
the lungs is air and tissue but
it's mainly air spaces.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.338
So, what you see is dark here,
the less dense regions are the

00:23:11.338 --> 00:23:14.611
lungs where nothing much
interfered with the X-rays

00:23:14.611 --> 00:23:18.480
passing through the body.
Had to pass through skin,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.450
soft tissue,
some muscles,

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.963
and then primarily through air.
Where the image is light here

00:23:24.963 --> 00:23:28.062
those are regions that absorbed
most of the X-ray,

00:23:28.062 --> 00:23:31.794
so not many of the X-rays got
through to the film in back of

00:23:31.794 --> 00:23:34.658
me.
Those areas appear lighter,

00:23:34.658 --> 00:23:38.153
so this bone,
the clavicle appears light,

00:23:38.153 --> 00:23:42.784
the ribs appear light,
the bones of the ribcage appear

00:23:42.784 --> 00:23:45.130
lighter.
What's this object here?

00:23:48.869 --> 00:23:58.779
In the chest over on this side
big--the heart.

00:23:58.779 --> 00:24:01.680
Why does the heart appear light
on this image?

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.119
Well, it's not bone,
it's not as dense as bone,

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:10.172
it's muscle,
it's soft tissue but it's also

00:24:10.172 --> 00:24:13.839
filled with water,
a lot of water.

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:16.893
It's a three dimensional
object, and so for X-rays to

00:24:16.893 --> 00:24:19.417
pass through whole three
dimensional object,

00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:21.589
a lot of the X-rays get
absorbed.

00:24:21.589 --> 00:24:26.545
It's a thicker object than this
bone, and so even though it's

00:24:26.545 --> 00:24:31.088
not as dense as bone it appears
whiter here because it's

00:24:31.088 --> 00:24:33.311
thicker.
X-rays have to pass through

00:24:33.311 --> 00:24:35.410
more of it in order to get to
the other side.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.713
The thicker the region it has
to pass through,

00:24:37.713 --> 00:24:40.529
the more opportunity for those
X-rays to be absorbed.

00:24:40.529 --> 00:24:45.769
The diaphragm--what do you
think are these scattered sort

00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:51.009
of white things all around here,
all around the side here?

00:24:51.009 --> 00:24:55.847
Well, first what's this object
that comes up that's sort of off

00:24:55.847 --> 00:24:59.254
to the side?
Here's the heart,

00:24:59.254 --> 00:25:06.880
something comes up--the aorta,
the aortic arch is here.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.480
Remember from our pictures of
the heart?

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.728
You can't see it entirely
because behind it is another

00:25:12.728 --> 00:25:16.254
white object that's sort of the
midline here,

00:25:16.254 --> 00:25:20.529
that's the bones of the spine.
In this region here,

00:25:20.529 --> 00:25:25.177
they're all superimposed so you
can't really tell how much of

00:25:25.177 --> 00:25:29.825
this absorption comes from the
aortic arch and how much of it

00:25:29.825 --> 00:25:34.625
comes from the spine.
This is one problem with

00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:40.791
X-rays, that you're not seeing a
three dimensional image of the

00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:46.299
chest in this case;
you're seeing a projected image.

00:25:46.299 --> 00:25:49.078
You're only looking in one
direction, really,

00:25:49.078 --> 00:25:52.615
and you're seeing a projection
of all the things that the

00:25:52.615 --> 00:25:56.927
X-rays could pass through.
I can't tell for example if the

00:25:56.927 --> 00:26:00.670
aortic arch is in front of or
behind the spine.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.424
I can't even tell where the
boundary them of are because

00:26:03.424 --> 00:26:06.630
it's all just--they're absorbing
X-rays and so I can't see it.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.023
What if I wanted to look at
this in more detail,

00:26:09.023 --> 00:26:12.231
or I wanted to distinguish what
part of this is this aortic arch

00:26:12.231 --> 00:26:15.330
and what part is the spine,
how would I change the imaging?

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.276
Sarah?Student:
[Inaudible]Professor Mark

00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:24.400
Saltzman: Yeah,
you could ask the patient to

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.022
turn to the side and you could
then do the same measurement

00:26:27.022 --> 00:26:28.890
this way.
Now, you'd see another

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.920
projection but you see a
projection from another angle.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.239
So, you would be able to
differentiate what is different

00:26:36.239 --> 00:26:39.632
in this direction.
You might do it obliquely,

00:26:39.632 --> 00:26:43.627
you might ask the patient to
turn a little bit sideways or

00:26:43.627 --> 00:26:46.490
turn the other way.
By putting together several

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.277
different images taken from
different angles you can learn

00:26:49.277 --> 00:26:52.259
more about the three dimensional
aspects of what's inside.

00:26:52.259 --> 00:26:55.835
You might be able to see things
that you can't in one image in

00:26:55.835 --> 00:26:57.360
one of the other angles.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.566
X-rays are a projection,
a two dimensional projection of

00:27:03.566 --> 00:27:07.170
three dimensional object and
that's one of their limitations.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.853
You can get around that a
little bit by asking the--by

00:27:10.853 --> 00:27:14.675
moving the object around or
taking images from different

00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:17.378
sides.
Another problem with X-rays

00:27:17.378 --> 00:27:21.175
is radiation dose.
I mentioned that X-rays were a

00:27:21.175 --> 00:27:25.206
form of ionizing radiation.
So, if you're exposed to X-rays

00:27:25.206 --> 00:27:27.160
you could be generating ions
inside.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.005
With a normal chest X-ray,
if you only have one chest

00:27:31.005 --> 00:27:35.517
X-ray taken every 5 years or 10
years or so, the dose that you

00:27:35.517 --> 00:27:39.562
get is relatively low.
Your body has mechanisms for

00:27:39.562 --> 00:27:42.670
repairing those--that biological
damage.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.066
Your body has mechanisms for
repairing the kind of biological

00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:48.500
damage that's done by ionizing
radiation.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.766
If the dose is low enough the
risk of some permanent kind of

00:27:53.766 --> 00:27:58.321
damage is fairly low.
Where there is a risk is if you

00:27:58.321 --> 00:28:03.083
have repeated exposure to higher
doses, in which case you're

00:28:03.083 --> 00:28:08.086
generating--more ions are being
generated in your body than the

00:28:08.086 --> 00:28:13.090
repair mechanisms that are
naturally in place can repair.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:18.336
Then, you get tissue damage.
One is concerned when

00:28:18.336 --> 00:28:23.591
you're using radiation with
limiting the dose that is

00:28:23.591 --> 00:28:28.739
delivered on each X-ray.
How could you reduce the dose

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:31.119
here?
How could you reduce the

00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:34.410
radiation dose that the patient
receives?

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:39.612
Thinking about how this thing
works, how could you reduce the

00:28:39.612 --> 00:28:42.616
dose?
Well, one is you could use the

00:28:42.616 --> 00:28:46.931
minimum number of X-rays
necessary to see what you want

00:28:46.931 --> 00:28:49.624
to see.
Of course, as you use less

00:28:49.624 --> 00:28:53.559
radiation does you're going to
see less on the image.

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:55.829
So you're--the sensitivity is
going to go down.

00:28:55.829 --> 00:28:59.892
One of the things you might not
see if you use less radiation

00:28:59.892 --> 00:29:03.820
dose you might not see these
other structures here that are

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.799
barely visible in this
particular image.

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:10.716
These structures here are
vessels from the pulmonary

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:15.246
vasculature and the bronchi
associated with the lung and you

00:29:15.246 --> 00:29:18.546
might care about those,
so you might need a higher dose

00:29:18.546 --> 00:29:20.049
in order to see what you want to
see.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:23.328
So, you can reduce the dose by
reducing the intensity of the

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:26.607
radiation but the cost is you
don't get as high a quality of

00:29:26.607 --> 00:29:29.210
an image;
not as useful for a diagnosis.

00:29:34.069 --> 00:29:37.299
One could also make
innovations in the machinery.

00:29:37.299 --> 00:29:41.000
In particular,
you could make detectors that

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.269
are always--that get more
sensitive.

00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:49.324
The more sensitive the detector
is the more information you get

00:29:49.324 --> 00:29:53.418
per photon or per radiation.
More sensitive detectors allow

00:29:53.418 --> 00:29:56.549
you to make better measurements
with less radioactivity.

00:29:56.549 --> 00:30:01.210
There have been those
innovations continually over the

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:06.573
years, and so the X-rays that
you would get now are fairly low

00:30:06.573 --> 00:30:10.970
dose X-rays without much
apparent risk to you.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.947
You also can limit where the
X-rays hit the body and part of

00:30:14.947 --> 00:30:18.525
that's done by focusing;
part of it's done by something

00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:21.773
called shielding.
If you were getting a chest

00:30:21.773 --> 00:30:26.000
X-ray done they might put an
apron on at your waist.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.279
That apron contains a very
dense material,

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:33.359
and so the X-rays don't
penetrate through below your

00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:36.044
waist.
These are all ways that

00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:40.880
radiologists use to reduce the
radiation dose to patients.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.078
We talked about being able
to see more by looking at

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:51.162
different angles.
The technology called Computed

00:30:51.162 --> 00:30:56.589
Tomography or CT is sort of the
end product of that.

00:30:56.589 --> 00:31:00.975
It's trying to design X-ray
machines, and CT machines use

00:31:00.975 --> 00:31:03.539
X-rays.
The physics of how you form the

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:06.478
image is exactly the same.
You're generating X-rays and

00:31:06.478 --> 00:31:08.079
they're passing through the
body.

00:31:08.079 --> 00:31:12.922
What's different is that the
machine allows you to take

00:31:12.922 --> 00:31:17.227
pictures at many,
many different angles while the

00:31:17.227 --> 00:31:20.745
patient stays still.
Instead of asking the patient

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:23.476
to move from one side to the
other so you can take pictures

00:31:23.476 --> 00:31:26.971
at different angles,
you have an X-ray source and a

00:31:26.971 --> 00:31:30.990
detector that basically spins
around the patient.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.890
It takes pictures at different
angles, and you use not a broad

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:40.710
beam that's going to expose my
chest all at the same time,

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:47.342
but you use a narrow collimated
beam, a narrow beam that you can

00:31:47.342 --> 00:31:53.869
focus and move throughout all of
the angles around the body.

00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:57.570
You're not giving sort of a
plane of radiation anymore

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:01.480
you're giving something more
like a line of radiation.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.736
As that line passes through me,
there's going to be absorbance

00:32:05.736 --> 00:32:09.782
detected back here depending on
what was in the way of that

00:32:09.782 --> 00:32:13.759
particular line of radiation
that was coming through.

00:32:13.759 --> 00:32:18.496
Now, any one line doesn't
give you very much information,

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:23.390
but what if you collect those
lines from all around my body?

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:28.220
You can basically see my body
from every angle.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.309
That still is going to be a
complicated set of images.

00:32:32.309 --> 00:32:35.970
What if you took 360 pictures
as you spun this thing around my

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.609
body, now you've got 360
pictures to look at,

00:32:38.609 --> 00:32:41.990
how do you make sense of that?
Well, you couldn't really.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.300
What really made CT possible,
is that mathematicians figured

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:50.683
out mathematical ways for taking
all of these separate images

00:32:50.683 --> 00:32:54.410
that are collected as you move
around the body,

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:59.938
and reconstructing an image of
the whole object that must have

00:32:59.938 --> 00:33:03.640
been in between.
The mathematical process is

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.398
called back projection,
you take a large number of

00:33:07.398 --> 00:33:11.386
projected images that are
acquired from all different

00:33:11.386 --> 00:33:16.218
angles and you can reconstruct a
picture of what the object must

00:33:16.218 --> 00:33:19.670
have looked like that it was
sampling.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:23.606
Now, because it's a narrow
beam you're doing this in a line

00:33:23.606 --> 00:33:26.946
instead of a plane.
And you're spinning it around,

00:33:26.946 --> 00:33:30.491
you're really doing a slice
through the body with each

00:33:30.491 --> 00:33:33.675
rotation of the device.
If I spin this all around my

00:33:33.675 --> 00:33:36.617
body, then I'm basically moving
this line around different

00:33:36.617 --> 00:33:38.630
angles and I'm looking at one
slice.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:44.196
Between here and here all the
way around, and so you can

00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:50.269
reconstruct an image of a slice
that might look like this.

00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:53.879
The chest X-ray,
a plain of radiation,

00:33:53.879 --> 00:33:59.440
shadow of what that produces,
the CT gives you a slice,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.292
a transverse slice of the body,
but it shows you the real three

00:34:03.292 --> 00:34:05.839
dimensional structure of what's
inside.

00:34:05.839 --> 00:34:07.339
What can you see in this
picture?

00:34:07.339 --> 00:34:10.109
Well, here was the spine in
this picture,

00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:13.987
is this from the thorax that
contains the lung or is this

00:34:13.987 --> 00:34:17.449
from the abdomen that contains
the intestines?

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:20.340
Don't read the bottom of the
picture.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.242
Just looking at it,
it's not the lungs because you

00:34:24.242 --> 00:34:29.260
don't see a lot of dark area in
here that would indicate air.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:34.125
What you see instead are a lot
of soft tissues that sort of

00:34:34.125 --> 00:34:37.816
absorb radiation.
This here is the liver,

00:34:37.816 --> 00:34:43.376
you can see muscles and bones
of the ribcage which are down in

00:34:43.376 --> 00:34:46.894
the abdomen here.
You can see the spine very

00:34:46.894 --> 00:34:50.805
clearly, you can see the kidneys
at the back, you can see the

00:34:50.805 --> 00:34:52.240
intestines in here.

00:34:55.789 --> 00:34:59.353
An experienced radiologist
who's looking at this can see a

00:34:59.353 --> 00:35:02.979
lot of information arranged in
the proper three dimensional

00:35:02.979 --> 00:35:05.552
way.
Now, this is one slice but

00:35:05.552 --> 00:35:08.039
you could do another slice as
well.

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:13.221
You can do that in the machine
because the patient is sitting

00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:18.489
still and is moving through the
machine one step at a time.

00:35:18.489 --> 00:35:22.138
There's a conveyer belt here
that's bringing the patient into

00:35:22.138 --> 00:35:26.557
the machine.
In the machine is this rotating

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:30.930
array of X-ray sources and
detectors.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:35.063
This part spins around.
So you bring the patient in,

00:35:35.063 --> 00:35:37.089
you spin it around,
you collect all the images,

00:35:37.089 --> 00:35:39.599
you bring them in a little
father, you spin it around.

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:42.910
Each time each increment that
you move the patient in you're

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.929
taking a picture of another
slice,

00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:50.114
and so one could take a three
dimensional image of the whole

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:52.754
body.
Now, because you're just

00:35:52.754 --> 00:35:57.020
using line sources of radiation
one can reduce the amount of

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:01.070
radiation that with each
individual picture that you take

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:05.545
compared to an X-ray.
But you've got to take a lot of

00:36:05.545 --> 00:36:09.230
these pictures,
and so the cumulative dose of

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.566
radiation can be significant.
Even though you could take a

00:36:13.566 --> 00:36:17.116
full three dimensional of your
body, you might not want to do

00:36:17.116 --> 00:36:19.039
that.
You might just want to take a

00:36:19.039 --> 00:36:21.590
picture of the slices that seem
to be of interest,

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.162
maybe the abdomen,
maybe the chest,

00:36:23.162 --> 00:36:25.890
maybe the knee if you're having
a problem with your knee.

00:36:30.329 --> 00:36:34.628
CT is commonly used for head
injuries, it's fast,

00:36:34.628 --> 00:36:39.465
it's very effective at
detecting blood in the brain for

00:36:39.465 --> 00:36:41.989
example.
You can detect that easily.

00:36:41.989 --> 00:36:45.227
And for analyzing the structure
of bones, and you know X-rays

00:36:45.227 --> 00:36:47.971
are very good for bones.
If you've ever had a broken

00:36:47.971 --> 00:36:50.952
bone, then you've probably seen
an X-ray of the bones of your

00:36:50.952 --> 00:36:53.275
body.
That's because bones absorb

00:36:53.275 --> 00:36:56.342
X-ray radiation,
and so X-rays are very good

00:36:56.342 --> 00:36:57.840
ways to detect it.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.090
I think that's where I want to
stop for today.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:11.619
We talked about X-ray radiation;
I got some slides on here that

00:37:11.619 --> 00:37:14.500
say a little bit more about
ionizing radiation.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.366
I put them on there for you to
read because it's not in the

00:37:18.366 --> 00:37:21.784
chapters in the book,
but this talks about sources of

00:37:21.784 --> 00:37:24.823
ionizing radiation,
a picture of sort of what it is

00:37:24.823 --> 00:37:28.469
and some of the biological
effects of ionizing radiation.

00:37:28.469 --> 00:37:31.851
It's sort of beyond what I'm
going to ask you about in the

00:37:31.851 --> 00:37:34.640
exams or anything,
but I wanted you to have that

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.079
information.
Then, next time we're going to

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:42.810
move on and talk about forms of
imaging that don't require

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.258
X-rays,
and so don't have the

00:37:45.258 --> 00:37:48.340
biological risks of ionizing
radiation.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.475
We'll talk about ultrasound
imaging and MR imaging,

00:37:51.475 --> 00:37:54.611
and we'll talk about what I
think is going to be an

00:37:54.611 --> 00:37:58.312
important imaging technique of
the future but using light to

00:37:58.312 --> 00:38:01.510
image inside the body as well.
Questions?

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.740
Good.
Thanks;

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.540
I'll see you on Thursday.

PAUL FREEDMAN: Alright, so
you may be asking

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.567
yourself, "Why are we reading
the Confessions?" I think I

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:15.633
gave a preliminary answer
before, but since it seems to

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:20.533
be perhaps more appropriate
for religious studies or

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.633
philosophy, let me remind
you why we're

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.100
struggling through this.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.967
First, the impact
of Christianity

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.400
on the Roman Empire--

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.733
that is to say, the social and
intellectual setting of the

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.433
rise of Christianity
in the late

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.800
fourth, early fifth centuries.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.567
The second is to understand some
of the Christian moral

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:53.000
and doctrinal problems and
their implications.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.567
Once again, we're not exactly
interested in these for

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:59.867
reasons of theology or morality,
but we need to get

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:02.667
into the minds of people
at the time in order to

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:07.700
understand what bothered them,
what controversies they were

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.100
involved in, and how those
controversies indeed divided

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
the Roman Empire and
the successors

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.500
to the Roman Empire.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.067
Some of those problems--

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:22.333
well, under that second heading
of Christian moral and

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:25.900
doctrinal problems, let me just
mention three, which by

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.200
no means exhausts them, but are
three that we can sort of,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.700
if not identify with, I think
see their importance.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.667
One, the problem of evil.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.700
Second, the relation between
body and soul.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.867
And three, the Christian
understanding of sin and

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:50.533
redemption.

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.300
Now, it turns out these are
all aspects of the same

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.467
problem, and they are dealt with
in Augustine's works most

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:06.467
thoroughly, more thoroughly than
any other thinker of the

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:09.767
ancient world.

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:13.000
The third reason we're looking
at this is the interaction

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.900
between Christianity and

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.733
classical culture and religion.

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:23.400
Roman life and politics,
Augustine's career and his

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.667
giving up his career, what that
means, other ideas within

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:32.000
the Roman Empire, such as
Manicheaism, Platonism.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.300
And then finally, this is a
document of philosophical and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.067
psychological investigation.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:42.833
And while that is not our
primary purpose here, you

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:46.267
should not get out of a liberal
arts college program

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:50.700
without reading this and
pondering it a little.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.400
This can be summarized in terms
of the importance of the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.667
humanities, even, or of
philosophical investigation,

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.100
as opposed to mere investigation
of natural

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.500
phenomena, in words that
Augustine uses in Book X,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.233
which we have not read.

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:13.400
After Book IX, Book
X is a turning.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.667
It discusses time and
the meaning of time.

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:21.833
Books XI, XII, and XIII are
a commentary on Genesis.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:25.700
Worth reading, if you like, and
interesting to think about

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.633
how they do or do not mesh with
the more confessional

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:31.967
parts of the Confession.

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:37.500
But in Book X, he says, "Men
go out and gaze in

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.500
astonishment at high mountains,
the huge waves of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.567
the sea, the broad reaches
of rivers, the ocean that

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:52.000
encircles the world, or the
stars in their courses, but

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.900
they pay no attention to
themselves." They are busy

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.500
looking at external
phenomena and not

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.367
examining their own heart.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:06.500
And if the Confessions is
anything, it is certainly an

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.200
examination of the
author's heart.

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:15.600
But it's not an examination
of his heart in a purely

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.400
emotional sense, in the way
we're familiar with in

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.333
so-called confessional
literature.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:23.200
I had a tough upbringing.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.033
This happened to me.

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:25.367
That happened to me.

00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:27.233
I struggled with addiction.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.333
I beat my kids.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:30.833
Now I'm a great person.

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:32.367
Whatever.

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:35.233
This is an intellectual
investigation as well as an

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.633
emotional investigation.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:41.133
And indeed, Augustine doesn't
see these as separate, or to

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:43.733
the degree that he does, it's in
a more complicated way than

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:46.033
just saying intellectual versus
non-intellectual.

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:48.800
He is an intellectual,
obviously.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.933
And he awakened to being an
intellectual, an experience

00:04:52.933 --> 00:04:54.733
that many of you may have had.

00:04:54.733 --> 00:04:58.633
Remember, he reads this dialogue
by Cicero, now lost,

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:00.767
called the Hortensius.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:05.100
And this convinces him that the
life of the mind is the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.333
most important thing
to pursue.

00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:11.467
And I wouldn't say that we all
have had this experience, but

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:14.500
maybe you--

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.300
what was the point at which
you discovered that you

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.500
weren't like other people,
that they lived more for

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.733
immediate sensations, or
pleasure, or what Augustine

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:29.033
would call debauchery, and you
wanted to read or think about

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:34.033
stuff or do lab experiments?

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:37.167
I think the essence of Yale, if
I understand it correctly,

00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:40.867
is I don't have to choose
between fun and the

00:05:40.867 --> 00:05:42.100
intellectual life.

00:05:44.533 --> 00:05:48.500
So it's not actually perhaps
relevant to your lives now,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.733
but particularly if you went to
a public high school, grew

00:05:53.733 --> 00:05:57.033
up in a non-intellectual
environment.

00:05:57.033 --> 00:06:00.433
Those of you whose parents are
professors and went to some

00:06:00.433 --> 00:06:04.033
school where everybody was
reading Latin at the age of

00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:05.467
six, I'm not talking to you.

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:09.067
But I'm talking to the vast
majority who woke up one day

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:14.867
and realized, either with pride
or with dismay, "I'm

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:18.200
different from other people."
Ideas have meaning to me.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.067
I'm going to suffer in life
for that, though there're

00:06:22.067 --> 00:06:23.667
going to be some rewards.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:27.800
And I leave you to discern what
the rewards are and to

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.867
mull over what the suffering
has been or maybe will

00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:31.833
continue to be.

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:35.100
I hope not, and I suspect
you'll have an

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.867
easier time of it.

00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:43.600
But this book is about a search
for truth and a search

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.300
that takes a number of wrong
turns, at least from

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.167
Augustine's opinion looking back
on the situation when he

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:55.633
wrote this in the 390s.

00:06:55.633 --> 00:06:58.433
It's a confession of sin.

00:06:58.433 --> 00:07:02.700
It's also, as I said before, a
confession of praise for the

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:09.000
God whose love directed him
back to the right path.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.533
It is personal, but exemplary.

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:16.633
It is about spiritual yearning,
but it is also about

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:19.700
intellectual yearning
for truth.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.533
It's a book about the education
of a young man and

00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:29.233
the adventures of this
young man and what

00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:31.900
he learns from them.

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:38.667
Now, in the first place, he is
both an intellectual and a

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.267
passionate person.

00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:47.800
He is someone who is unusually
frank about his desires.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.267
But notice that he's not
just opposed to desire.

00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:59.800
He is not someone who believes
that desire, love are to be

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.667
simply repressed or ignored.

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:06.700
Love is a psychological need.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.767
And he has a very discerning
and interesting passage in

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:18.233
describing his teenage years
and his lusts when he

00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:21.933
frequented the brothels
of Carthage.

00:08:21.933 --> 00:08:27.133
In Book III, at the beginning,
he says, "I was in love with

00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:31.200
the idea of love." So he was not
only in love, but he was

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.233
in love with the idea of being
an emotional being, of love

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:41.900
that is both sexual and
spiritual, in which these two

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:48.367
things are not well marked
off from each other.

00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:51.267
He is also a believer
in friendship.

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:53.467
And it's funny, because in
our own culture, I think

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:55.567
friendship has changed.

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:59.733
When I started teaching, people
had trouble dealing

00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:04.767
with the affection that he has
for his friends, like Alypius

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:08.500
and Nebridius, or the mysterious
unnamed friend who

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500
dies after being baptized.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.267
Augustine is always surrounded
by friends.

00:09:14.267 --> 00:09:16.633
Even in the most intimate
moments, when he's undergoing

00:09:16.633 --> 00:09:18.700
this conversion, there're
all sorts of people

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.300
right around him.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.800
And as I said before,
this seemed to be--

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.733
the explanation was, well, he
must've been homosexual, or he

00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:29.533
must have these desires, or
maybe it's part of Roman

00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:31.033
culture of friendship.

00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:35.633
But in recent decades or years,
where we have a culture

00:09:35.633 --> 00:09:37.867
of friendship, where your
friends are extremely

00:09:37.867 --> 00:09:38.667
important--

00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:43.300
admittedly, if you have 900 of
them, it's a little bit,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.467
perhaps, weakened--

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:48.900
but I think we can understand
some of this better than might

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.033
have been the case a
little while ago.

00:09:52.033 --> 00:09:56.900
This friend who dies after being
baptized, here is an

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.800
example of another form
of seriousness.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.300
They go out and have
fun together.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.133
The friend becomes ill.

00:10:05.133 --> 00:10:07.000
The friend is suddenly
very serious.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.133
The friend gets baptized,
because to be baptized, as

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:16.567
with Constantine, means that you
are committing yourself to

00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:22.733
a much more stringent and
moral life than before.

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:25.500
And then he dies.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.300
And this certainly disturbs
Augustine.

00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:32.267
What is life all about?

00:10:32.267 --> 00:10:35.133
Any of you who've had the
experience of contemporaries

00:10:35.133 --> 00:10:40.400
of yours who have died will
understand this, I think.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.400
Augustine's also ambitious.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.133
He is a successful person.

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:46.300
Even though he's from
a modest family--

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:55.067
his father, a pagan or
non-Christian, middle class

00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:59.700
official of North Africa, his
mother, a Christian--

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.700
He's clearly marked for success
because of his unusual

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.933
gifts, his unusual gifts being
intellectual, ability to

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:11.467
write, ability to argue.

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:13.800
He's marked out as
extremely smart.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:20.967
And at that time, success for
such a person, the course of

00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:24.333
success was through government
service--

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:26.100
this is the era of
post-Diocletian,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.500
post-Constantine--

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.833
and related particularly
to a combination of

00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:33.900
rhetoric and law.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.667
This is not all that different
from societies familiar to us.

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:41.933
That is to say, the training in
law gives one access to a

00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:44.367
number of different kinds
of political offices.

00:11:44.367 --> 00:11:47.767
But rhetoric is perhaps a
little stranger to us.

00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:52.200
Rhetoric in this context means
the art of persuasion.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.367
So it's very closely related
to law and legal pleading.

00:11:56.367 --> 00:12:02.500
It is the art of writing well,
of writing elegantly, and it

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.467
is very, very highly valued
in the Roman Empire.

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:15.000
His mother, Monica, is
extremely pious.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.133
In fact, the first section,
class rather that I taught--

00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:24.800
no, I guess I was a
section leader--

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.267
when I was a graduate student,
the first section I had, my

00:12:29.267 --> 00:12:32.200
students were arguing with me
about Augustine's patronizing

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.033
attitude towards his mother.

00:12:34.033 --> 00:12:36.433
And I said, well, no, he's
not patronizing.

00:12:36.433 --> 00:12:37.867
He's smarter than his mother.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.267
His mother's just an
ordinary person.

00:12:42.267 --> 00:12:47.133
After all, Augustine becomes a
saint, and his mother doesn't.

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:52.333
Some guy from Santa Monica
Catholic School said, who do

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:55.033
you think Santa Monica is?

00:12:55.033 --> 00:12:57.067
This is Augustine's mother.

00:12:57.067 --> 00:13:00.300
So anyway, I've learned.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.567
Augustine's mother is a saint.

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:04.533
She is a more steadfast kind
of person than Augustine.

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:07.533
She's not someone who stays up
all night wrestling with the

00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:08.933
problem of evil.

00:13:08.933 --> 00:13:12.400
Nevertheless, she does not
want him to be baptized.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.000
She wants him to
be successful.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.967
Like most mothers, she wants her
child to be a good person.

00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:20.133
But even more than that,
she wants her

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.100
child to be a success.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.633
And that means delaying baptism,
because if he's going

00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:28.300
to be a success, he's going to
have to be involved in the

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.567
world of high government,
and that may mean--

00:13:30.567 --> 00:13:35.367
well, that definitely means
involvement in sinfulness,

00:13:35.367 --> 00:13:39.133
involvement in the shedding of
blood, involvement in legal

00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:40.933
wrangling and stuff like that.

00:13:40.933 --> 00:13:46.767
And so he is encouraged to lead
a normal life, "normal"

00:13:46.767 --> 00:13:48.767
meaning, at least in his
own retrospective

00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:53.433
view, sinful life.

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.867
This is what Augustine is giving
up in his conversion.

00:13:56.867 --> 00:13:59.933
He is giving up a career.

00:13:59.933 --> 00:14:06.500
He is giving up a social
expectation of success or

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.300
social definition of success.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.300
He is giving up the pleasures
attendant on that career,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:23.300
which range from parties to
honors to sexual conquests and

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.567
the whole life of a
well-established member of the

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:28.833
Roman elite.

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:35.300
What is bothering Augustine?

00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:48.600
What bothers him is, in part,
the problem of evil, which

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.467
we've alluded to already.

00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:55.233
Why does a good and omnipotent
god allow evil to flourish?

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:08.600
A related problem is that
compared to the works of the

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.200
Greek writers and philosophers,
the Bible seems

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.067
awfully crude to him,
rhetorically, in terms of

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:21.933
style, and conceptually,
in terms of its ideas.

00:15:21.933 --> 00:15:26.100
The Old Testament god-- and
we're probably at various

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.000
levels of familiarity with
the Old Testament--

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.367
but the Old Testament god is
temperamental, I think it's

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:35.967
fair to say.

00:15:35.967 --> 00:15:37.433
Here's a guy who decides
to destroy--

00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:38.400
a guy--

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:45.000
a deity who decides to destroy
the world by flood, destroys

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.033
the cities of the plain, kills
one of the people bearing the

00:15:53.033 --> 00:16:00.267
tabernacle back to Jerusalem
because he stumbles.

00:16:00.267 --> 00:16:01.800
What kind of god is this?

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.967
This bothers Augustine.

00:16:03.967 --> 00:16:07.900
And his anthropomorphism
bothers Augustine.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:13.100
In the Old Testament, in the
Hebrew Bible, a god speaks

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.567
with people.

00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:16.267
Adam hears him walking
in the garden.

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:17.300
How can that be?

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:22.733
How can this human-seeming
god be the real God?

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:25.467
So these two anxieties put
Augustine in the camp of the

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:27.067
Manicheans.

00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:30.600
Remember, the Manicheans believe
that the solution to

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.433
the problem of evil is that
God is not omnipotent.

00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:38.533
God is trying, but there's
another evil god who is

00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:39.733
opposing Him.

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:42.400
And that evil god is the god
of the flesh and the god of

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:49.433
the Old Testament, Jehovah, the
creator god, the god of

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:52.100
matter and flesh.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.733
We are souls imprisoned
in flesh.

00:16:55.733 --> 00:17:00.900
Our true home is the spiritual,
and we have to

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.633
renounce everything that has to
do with the flesh in order

00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:05.467
to go there.

00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:10.900
So Manicheanism would seem
to be extremely ascetic.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.467
You should have absolutely
nothing to do with the world.

00:17:13.467 --> 00:17:17.700
But as is always the case with
the statement, "everything

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:22.100
that's material is evil, but we
are material," Manicheanism

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.133
also offers or affords you an
opportunity to be completely

00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:28.700
involved in the world, totally
involved in the world, because

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.033
there's nothing you
can do about it.

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:33.567
All you can do is say, the
flesh is evil, I'm in the

00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:36.933
flesh, I'm just going to have
to deal with it until I am

00:17:36.933 --> 00:17:39.767
liberated into the spirit.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:45.433
So Manicheanism is not
necessarily world-renouncing,

00:17:45.433 --> 00:17:48.233
but they do identify the source
of evil with the body.

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.933
The body is wicked.

00:17:49.933 --> 00:17:52.133
The immaterial soul is good.

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:58.500
This is not Christianity, as
Augustine discovers or

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.533
elaborates.

00:18:00.533 --> 00:18:04.733
Even though we may think of
Christianity as exalting the

00:18:04.733 --> 00:18:07.033
soul over the body,
nevertheless, it

00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:08.833
also exalts the body.

00:18:08.833 --> 00:18:15.467
Christian doctrine is that the
bodies of human beings will be

00:18:15.467 --> 00:18:18.300
resurrected, not
just the souls.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.433
There will be bodies after
the Last Judgment in

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:24.300
heaven and in hell.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.800
God created the world,
and it was good.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.500
What then explains the
presence of evil?

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.833
Augustine at this stage turns
to Platonism for an

00:18:34.833 --> 00:18:37.533
understanding of the
nature of evil.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:40.333
Evil is not a thing in itself.

00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:43.067
It is rather the absence
of good.

00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:45.600
Now, if anyone has ever said
that to you, you will have

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.633
found that unconvincing, at
least in its first iteration.

00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:55.000
Because we're not just talking
about the absence of good, as

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.467
in, this bowl of chili
is not very good.

00:19:00.467 --> 00:19:02.567
It's not very flavorful.

00:19:02.567 --> 00:19:06.600
It's OK, but it's lacking
in something.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.667
But that's not evil.

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:13.467
Evil is not like, not
particularly good.

00:19:13.467 --> 00:19:18.333
Evil is much more vivid,
gratuitous, cruel,

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:21.033
all-encompassing.

00:19:21.033 --> 00:19:22.500
The Platonists don't
deny that.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.600
What they mean by saying it's
the privation of good is that

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.733
it is nothingness.

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:32.867
Evil is, in fact, the absence
of being and meaning.

00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:39.100
The reason it produces such
spectacular effects as war,

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:48.467
oppression, crime, is that
people turn away from the

00:19:48.467 --> 00:19:54.600
good, or they turn away from
what is truly good to prefer

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.367
lower goods.

00:19:56.367 --> 00:19:59.133
They turn away from the things
of the spirit to the

00:19:59.133 --> 00:20:00.700
things of the flesh.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.800
They prefer their own lusts
and desires, their own

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.033
ambitions and greed, to the
common good or to the

00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:12.000
immaterial and spiritual good.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.233
And it's this turning away from
the Sun, this turning

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:24.900
away from good, that seems
to be a human problem.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.967
Human beings, generally
speaking, don't understand

00:20:28.967 --> 00:20:32.833
what they're on Earth for,
according to the Platonists.

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:36.900
Many of you are familiar with
the metaphor of the cave from

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.933
The Republic.

00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:45.033
This is the classic depiction
of this wrong preference.

00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:49.733
The people in the cave are
chained facing the back wall

00:20:49.733 --> 00:20:54.600
of the cave, and they see images
of what's passing in

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.333
front of the cave reflected
on the wall.

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:00.800
As time goes on, they
come to believe that

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.233
those images are reality.

00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:05.400
They forget that they're
chained.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.233
They forget that they can't
see the real things.

00:21:09.233 --> 00:21:12.367
They forget the Sun.

00:21:12.367 --> 00:21:16.400
If you were to liberate them and
turn them around and show

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.000
them the light, first of all,
they couldn't bear it, because

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.867
they're used to the
world of shadow.

00:21:22.867 --> 00:21:26.733
Secondly, they'd kill you,
because you are destroying

00:21:26.733 --> 00:21:29.267
their assumptions
and their world.

00:21:29.267 --> 00:21:32.900
They would at least
persecute you.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.367
They're not interested
in the truth.

00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:35.867
They're interested
in getting by.

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:44.400
So for the Platonists, evil is
the result of this error in

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.333
perception, assuming that it's
a great thing to get rich.

00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:54.600
Or assuming that it's a great
thing to beat people up

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.533
because you're stronger
than they are.

00:21:57.533 --> 00:22:05.667
Or it's a great thing to
conquer and subjugate.

00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:10.967
Or all of these things, some
of which are evil but are

00:22:10.967 --> 00:22:14.200
really the preference of things
that you should not be

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.900
pursuing or that you should be
pursuing for reasons inspired

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.833
by spiritual truth.

00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:24.833
How do you get rid of this?

00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:27.167
In the Platonists' imagination,
by education.

00:22:27.167 --> 00:22:29.133
That's the whole point
of Plato's dialogues.

00:22:29.133 --> 00:22:33.967
That's why they are dialogues,
many of them, with a question

00:22:33.967 --> 00:22:35.433
and answer.

00:22:35.433 --> 00:22:38.567
They're very didactic.

00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:40.100
They're like being in a class.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.933
Socrates quizzes people, and
then he shows the solution.

00:22:42.933 --> 00:22:46.167
And they say, "Oh, wow,
Socrates, now I understand.

00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:49.367
Now I'm going to be a Platonist,
and I'm going to

00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:51.533
build a perfect society."
End of story.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.967
The important thing to
understand about Platonism is

00:22:59.967 --> 00:23:03.800
that it is not dualist in the
way that Manicheanism is or

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.133
the way that we instinctively
think about evil.

00:23:07.133 --> 00:23:09.267
Evil is not opposed to good.

00:23:09.267 --> 00:23:13.167
It's hierarchically
inferior to good.

00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:16.467
The Platonists' universe is like
a ladder with many rungs

00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:23.833
going up from mud, bugs, rocks
to the immaterial One, and

00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:26.833
with many, many steps, as I
said, many rungs or steps or

00:23:26.833 --> 00:23:29.533
levels in between.

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:31.200
Human beings are
in the middle.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.967
And also, human beings-- unlike
animals, mud, slugs,

00:23:34.967 --> 00:23:39.567
but also unlike angels and
demiurges and deities--

00:23:39.567 --> 00:23:42.433
human beings can move up
and down the ladder.

00:23:42.433 --> 00:23:43.833
That's what free will is.

00:23:43.833 --> 00:23:45.333
That's what being human is.

00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:51.800
You can read Hortensius, read
the Confessions, fall in love

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.400
with the liberal arts, and
ascend to some very high realm

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.467
of the spirit.

00:23:57.467 --> 00:24:02.233
Or you can choose the
downward path to

00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:05.567
debauchery and mere pleasure.

00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:09.033
It's a question of how free you
are, but we do have the

00:24:09.033 --> 00:24:12.467
opportunity to move up and down
this ladder, unlike the

00:24:12.467 --> 00:24:18.833
animals and all other created
forces that are fixed.

00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:20.100
Now, the question
is what makes us

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.333
move up and down this?

00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:23.633
Or what'll motivate
us to move up?

00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:30.167
And here we come to some key
differences between Platonism

00:24:30.167 --> 00:24:32.667
and Christianity with
regard to evil.

00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:37.933
Platonism tends to ascribe
evil to ignorance.

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:41.233
Christianity tends to
ascribe evil to sin.

00:24:41.233 --> 00:24:47.667
The difference between sin and
ignorance is that sin is

00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:49.033
deliberate.

00:24:49.033 --> 00:24:52.833
You know you shouldn't do this,
and you do it anyway.

00:24:55.933 --> 00:24:57.900
You're not overcome by desire.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.200
So to anticipate one of
the paper topics--

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.800
but I don't think I'm going to
be giving away the answer--

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.267
what is it about the
pear-stealing incident that

00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:12.500
makes it so important?

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.767
Anybody want to venture a
preliminary response to this?

00:25:19.767 --> 00:25:22.167
STUDENT: Well, it's
the fact that he

00:25:22.167 --> 00:25:24.500
doesn't need the pears.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.767
He just does it because
he feels like sinning.

00:25:27.767 --> 00:25:29.700
PROFESSOR:
So the pears-- he

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.200
doesn't need the pears.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.900
It is just a desire.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.133
I mean he doesn't say to
himself, I want to sin.

00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:38.867
I haven't sinned in two days.

00:25:41.867 --> 00:25:43.367
He doesn't need the pears.

00:25:43.367 --> 00:25:45.467
What do they do with the pears
when they get them?

00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:46.867
STUDENT: They chuck them.

00:25:46.867 --> 00:25:48.367
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
they throw them out.

00:25:48.367 --> 00:25:50.700
They throw them to the pigs.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.500
So they're not hungry.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:59.933
It's not like, I was overcome
by desire, and that led me

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:02.400
into some sinful behavior.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.267
They weren't overcome
by desire at all.

00:26:04.267 --> 00:26:07.967
How would you describe their
pre-pear-stealing state?

00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:12.067
At least, what would you guess
was their pre-pear-stealing

00:26:12.067 --> 00:26:13.300
frame of mind?

00:26:15.667 --> 00:26:17.733
There's one word that'll
describe it, but if you want

00:26:17.733 --> 00:26:20.967
to, use a few more.

00:26:20.967 --> 00:26:24.200
Some guys go and they steal some
pears from an orchard.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.733
They fool around with them.

00:26:25.733 --> 00:26:27.633
They throw them to the pigs.

00:26:27.633 --> 00:26:28.467
STUDENT: Bored?

00:26:28.467 --> 00:26:30.633
PROFESSOR: Bored.

00:26:30.633 --> 00:26:31.033
Bored.

00:26:31.033 --> 00:26:34.200
Now, here's something we
can identify with.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.133
They're bored.

00:26:35.133 --> 00:26:37.267
They need to amuse themselves.

00:26:37.267 --> 00:26:40.267
They cannot amuse themselves
by saying, "I'm a good

00:26:40.267 --> 00:26:45.833
person," or, "I'm going to
contemplate the One," or, "I'm

00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:53.933
going to do some homework."
It doesn't end.

00:26:53.933 --> 00:26:57.933
Young people are thought to be
easily bored, but the boredom

00:26:57.933 --> 00:27:03.000
of old people, it's a different
kind of bored.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.900
But there it is.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.200
It's persistent.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.467
That's not the only reason
people sin, but it is a

00:27:08.467 --> 00:27:09.500
gratuitous reason.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.933
And that's what's interesting
about the pears.

00:27:11.933 --> 00:27:13.100
It's gratuitous.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.033
It's not from need.

00:27:16.033 --> 00:27:19.933
The Platonists don't have a
good response to why this

00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:23.133
happens, because it's not
a question of education.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.667
Now, Augustine does not invent
Christian ideas of sin.

00:27:30.667 --> 00:27:33.133
If you said to Augustine,
"Come on, why are you so

00:27:33.133 --> 00:27:35.500
worried about the pears?"
He's not worried about

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.667
the pears as such.

00:27:36.667 --> 00:27:41.933
It's just a little emblem or a
little example of a different

00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:42.800
kind of problem--

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.200
that is to say, knowing how to
behave doesn't change us.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.067
Feeling how to behave--

00:27:54.067 --> 00:28:02.600
to put it in Freudian terms,
it's not the ego that decides.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.300
It's the id.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.667
It's the instinct, not
the intellect.

00:28:07.667 --> 00:28:10.700
And that's what his
conversion means.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.867
His conversion is not:
"Suddenly, I was convinced

00:28:13.867 --> 00:28:17.100
that Christianity was true."
He already knows that

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.867
Christianity is true, but he
knows it intellectually.

00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:24.667
The conversion is a conversion
to an emotional

00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:25.900
apprehension of it.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.833
So however intellectual he may
seem to you, however formed in

00:28:30.833 --> 00:28:35.067
the tradition of Greco-Roman
classicism he was, however

00:28:35.067 --> 00:28:38.567
much the Hortensius awakened him
to the life of the mind,

00:28:38.567 --> 00:28:42.233
he is ultimately a theologian
and philosopher of the

00:28:42.233 --> 00:28:46.333
irrational, of the
supra-rational.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.800
And indeed, Christianity in its
history has an oscillation

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:59.700
between intellectualization and
the rediscovery of sin and

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.000
God's grace.

00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:09.233
If you think of movements like
the Reformation of Martin

00:29:09.233 --> 00:29:12.000
Luther, John Calvin, et cetera,
in the sixteenth

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.600
century, it takes issue with
the notion that we can do

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.967
works that give us merit in the
sight of God, and that the

00:29:20.967 --> 00:29:25.133
Church tells us we have
accumulated merits, and

00:29:25.133 --> 00:29:27.567
therefore we'll go to heaven.

00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:31.600
The Reformation teaches that we
are face to face with God

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.900
and that our so-called
good deeds

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.700
don't amount to anything.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.567
We are all sinful.

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:40.333
If God operated according
to justice, we

00:29:40.333 --> 00:29:42.667
would all go to hell.

00:29:42.667 --> 00:29:47.300
It's faith and grace that save
people, hence the Reformation.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:52.333
But it's also the Great
Awakening of Britain and

00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:55.400
America in the eighteenth
century, the development of

00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:03.100
Methodism, the Fundamentalist
movement, all of these tend to

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:09.367
reject attempts to approach God
contractually, attempts to

00:30:09.367 --> 00:30:11.967
approach God in terms
of a deal.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:25.900
So if human beings are sinful
and if education is not going

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.467
to get them out of
sin, what will?

00:30:32.367 --> 00:30:34.633
Now, the Augustine of the
Confessions is different than

00:30:34.633 --> 00:30:37.167
the Augustine of 20 years
later when he

00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:38.200
wrote The City of God.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:43.567
And we're not studying The City
of God, but this book,

00:30:43.567 --> 00:30:50.100
written in response to the sack
of Rome in 410, develops

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:56.567
some ideas that are found in
the Confessions about the

00:30:56.567 --> 00:31:03.200
nature of sin and how
we get out of it.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.200
The nature of sin
is the pears.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.767
How we get out of it is at least
in part the conversion.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.800
We got the pears sufficiently
for the time being?

00:31:19.167 --> 00:31:22.467
The conversion is started--

00:31:22.467 --> 00:31:25.633
well, it started long
before the event.

00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:30.233
But what precipitates it as a
drama is this conversation

00:31:30.233 --> 00:31:39.833
with Ponticianus in Book VIII,
Part VIII, who has traveled

00:31:39.833 --> 00:31:42.633
and describes the
monks of Egypt.

00:31:42.633 --> 00:31:45.167
Now, we'll be talking lots and
lots about monks, but the

00:31:45.167 --> 00:31:49.367
monks of Egypt are the first
example of Christian monks,

00:31:49.367 --> 00:31:59.300
men who flee the world into the
desert and there live on

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.633
weeds, saline water,
locusts, other

00:32:03.633 --> 00:32:06.900
insects, basically nothing.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:12.567
And they have visions, and
they are sought out by

00:32:12.567 --> 00:32:14.433
ordinary people.

00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:18.400
It's key to understand that to
be a hermit in this society

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.267
does not necessarily
mean that you have

00:32:21.267 --> 00:32:23.800
nothing to do with people.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.233
People start to want to find
you, because you must have

00:32:28.233 --> 00:32:31.300
special power.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.000
Back in Alexandria, their
baby is sick.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.767
"Maybe you, oh hermit, living
on locusts and out in the

00:32:40.767 --> 00:32:45.333
desert, have some spiritual
power to help my baby."

00:32:45.333 --> 00:32:46.433
This is shamanism.

00:32:46.433 --> 00:32:49.333
It happens in all sorts
of religions.

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:53.933
You can't just be a shaman, a
medicine man, a wise man, and

00:32:53.933 --> 00:32:56.367
hold down a regular old job.

00:32:56.367 --> 00:32:58.467
Or you can, but it helps.

00:32:58.467 --> 00:33:01.333
And that's the conceit
of a lot of TV

00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:03.167
ideas, secret heroes.

00:33:03.167 --> 00:33:05.933
They're the real estate agents,
but they're battling

00:33:05.933 --> 00:33:07.800
the forces of darkness.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.233
But generally, most of the
time, you've got to be

00:33:11.233 --> 00:33:13.933
special, and you've got
to look special.

00:33:13.933 --> 00:33:15.867
And you've got to be a reject.

00:33:15.867 --> 00:33:21.733
You can't have a spouse,
kids, a mortgage, a

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.433
garden, a swing set.

00:33:24.433 --> 00:33:28.533
You've got to be a seer.

00:33:28.533 --> 00:33:32.800
You've got to have your vision
focused on the other world.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.833
Ponticianus tells Augustine
about these men, and his

00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:41.500
response is not only to be
impressed by them, but to be

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.433
humiliated by them.

00:33:43.433 --> 00:33:48.767
First of all, here are these
guys who are intoxicated with

00:33:48.767 --> 00:33:53.800
God, while I'm still thinking
about my career.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.633
But-- and this is the ancient
world speaking--

00:33:56.633 --> 00:33:59.933
they are uneducated, these
monks of Egypt.

00:33:59.933 --> 00:34:05.800
They didn't study The Republic,
the Hortensius, the

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:12.833
Timaeus, the rhetoric
of Quintilian,

00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:14.967
the Satires of Juvenal.

00:34:14.967 --> 00:34:16.033
They don't know anything
about this.

00:34:16.033 --> 00:34:17.300
They're uneducated people.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.567
Many of them are illiterate.

00:34:18.567 --> 00:34:21.500
And yet they are
closer to God.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.033
They have an apprehension of the
divine that causes them to

00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:26.800
renounce the world,
whereas we--

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.367
Augustine says of him
and his circle--

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:34.967
we "lie here groveling in this
world of flesh and blood,

00:34:34.967 --> 00:34:38.400
while they storm the gates of
heaven." And this is the

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.633
moment of his conversion.

00:34:43.033 --> 00:34:47.367
Now, after his conversion,
Augustine's plan was to lead a

00:34:47.367 --> 00:34:52.333
life of contemplation
with his friends.

00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:55.533
They would retreat from the
world, meaning they would give

00:34:55.533 --> 00:35:02.900
up their careers, but it would
be a little bit like one of

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.333
your friend's parents have a
lot of money and have this

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:09.067
wonderful cabin somewhere
in the Rockies or

00:35:09.067 --> 00:35:10.267
the Sawtooth Mountains.

00:35:10.267 --> 00:35:15.367
And you're going to figure
out some kind of way of--

00:35:15.367 --> 00:35:18.733
you'll be on the Internet and
everything, but you're going

00:35:18.733 --> 00:35:24.167
to have this kind of beautiful,
contemplative life.

00:35:24.167 --> 00:35:26.200
But the beautiful part is that
it's not going to be

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.167
uncomfortable.

00:35:27.167 --> 00:35:29.300
It's not the desert of Egypt.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.467
It's remote--

00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:31.833
you're not going to
be bothered--

00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:33.200
but there are beautiful
mountains,

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.533
trouts in the stream.

00:35:35.533 --> 00:35:37.567
It's idyllic.

00:35:37.567 --> 00:35:40.633
And you and your friends are
going to talk about reality

00:35:40.633 --> 00:35:44.333
and the spirit and
philosophy and--

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.933
I don't know how idyllic this
sounds to you, but it's

00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:53.133
certainly an understandable
idea of a way of life.

00:35:53.133 --> 00:35:58.367
It is the ancient idea of what's
called "leisure with

00:35:58.367 --> 00:36:01.800
dignity." And indeed, that's
what being a professor was

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.167
supposed to be when I
signed up for it.

00:36:04.167 --> 00:36:07.667
Otium cum dignitate, leisure
with dignity. "Leisure"

00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:13.467
meaning not wasting time
leisure, but not responding to

00:36:13.467 --> 00:36:19.500
clients, or not responding
to urgent scheduling

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.267
phone calls, deals.

00:36:22.267 --> 00:36:27.200
You've got to show up
to your classes, but

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.067
that's not really onerous.

00:36:30.067 --> 00:36:31.600
At least, that was the idea.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.667
And I won't go into the
frustrations of being a

00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:38.267
professor or the
dissatisfactions.

00:36:38.267 --> 00:36:42.433
But the classical idea is otium
cum dignitate, "dignity"

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:47.300
meaning not being naked in the
desert, not having to eat

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.167
locusts and figure
out how to--

00:36:49.167 --> 00:36:51.667
"OK, I had curried locusts
last night.

00:36:51.667 --> 00:36:56.167
Tonight, I think I'll have
locust casserole." No, no, no.

00:36:56.167 --> 00:36:59.467
Something nicer than that.

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:03.567
But in fact, he did not follow
through on this.

00:37:03.567 --> 00:37:08.133
He did not lead a life of
cultivated classical dignity

00:37:08.133 --> 00:37:09.367
with his friends.

00:37:09.367 --> 00:37:11.333
He went back to North Africa.

00:37:11.333 --> 00:37:13.600
He became a bishop.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.900
His years were consumed by
disputes over doctrine or with

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.767
heretical--

00:37:20.767 --> 00:37:22.000
as he deemed them--

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.933
tendencies, like Donatism,
most notably.

00:37:25.933 --> 00:37:32.333
And he died defending his city
of Hippo, Hippo Regius, in

00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:36.700
modern Tunisia, from the
Vandals, one of those

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.400
barbarian invaders who will
occupy us next week.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.633
He then was very much involved
in the world.

00:37:44.633 --> 00:37:48.200
To be a bishop in the Roman
Empire was by no means an

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.767
office of dignified leisure.

00:37:50.767 --> 00:37:54.633
It was right in there in
the political trenches.

00:37:54.633 --> 00:38:01.167
It's a position of honor, to be
sure, but his understanding

00:38:01.167 --> 00:38:04.467
of the Christian's duty in the
world was that you cannot lead

00:38:04.467 --> 00:38:06.200
a life of perfection.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.167
You cannot lead a life of
sin-free contemplation.

00:38:11.167 --> 00:38:15.200
We all are sinners.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:22.067
He becomes more and more the
theologian, philosopher who

00:38:22.067 --> 00:38:24.233
combats perfectionism.

00:38:24.233 --> 00:38:29.233
Perfectionism is a doctrine that
human beings can be made

00:38:29.233 --> 00:38:31.300
radically better--

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.533
perfect, even.

00:38:34.733 --> 00:38:38.767
There are debates throughout
societies about the degree of

00:38:38.767 --> 00:38:40.900
human perfectibility.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.533
This is indeed supposedly and to
some extent I think really

00:38:44.533 --> 00:38:47.033
at the heart of debates
between what is called

00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:50.333
liberalism in the United States
and conservatism.

00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:52.900
Liberals believe in human
perfectibility.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:58.767
If you educate people, if you
help them, if you encourage

00:38:58.767 --> 00:39:02.400
them, if you provide government
subsidies, you will

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.767
build a better society.

00:39:04.767 --> 00:39:08.267
The response upon the part of
conservatives to that is,

00:39:08.267 --> 00:39:12.133
people are the way they are
because that's the way they

00:39:12.133 --> 00:39:15.067
want to be, or they made
wrong choices.

00:39:15.067 --> 00:39:21.700
But all the help from some
public authority isn't going

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.700
to help, isn't going to really
make a difference.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.600
Are people perfectible?

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.267
People who believe in
education tend to

00:39:28.267 --> 00:39:30.633
believe that they are.

00:39:30.633 --> 00:39:33.000
On the other hand, very
well-educated

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.600
people have been bad.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.800
Hitler loved classical music.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.267
So did Stalin.

00:39:41.267 --> 00:39:44.600
Just because you are a
connoisseur of art doesn't

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.833
make you a good person.

00:39:49.433 --> 00:39:53.000
Augustine is a radical
imperfectionist, more so in

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.333
The City of God than in the
Confessions, which is

00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:57.900
teetering on the brink.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:03.233
The pears is a kind of
imperfectionist moment.

00:40:03.233 --> 00:40:09.000
He glimpses the power of sin.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.767
By the time of The City of God,
by the time that the end

00:40:12.767 --> 00:40:15.000
of the Roman Empire is at
least glimpsed as a

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.867
possibility and the rise of the
barbarians, Augustine has

00:40:18.867 --> 00:40:23.533
become someone who does not
believe that human beings can,

00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:27.933
in any way, earn salvation.

00:40:27.933 --> 00:40:30.200
Human beings are irrevocably
sinful.

00:40:33.533 --> 00:40:37.333
Once again, if God judged people
according to their

00:40:37.333 --> 00:40:41.367
merits, they would
all be damned.

00:40:41.367 --> 00:40:48.533
Since the Christian belief is
that some people are saved,

00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:54.533
they are saved by a mysterious
process called "grace." Grace,

00:40:54.533 --> 00:40:59.000
by its very meaning,
is undeserved.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.600
You don't show up at the door
of Heaven with a ticket of

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.967
admission earned by your
deeds on Earth.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.767
What opens the doors
to you is a

00:41:13.767 --> 00:41:17.500
generous, arbitrary decision.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.633
Well, "generous" may mean,
I had good intentions.

00:41:21.633 --> 00:41:22.867
I didn't kill anybody.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:32.067
But "arbitrary" may mean that
we can't figure out who's

00:41:32.067 --> 00:41:35.667
going to Heaven and who's
going to Hell.

00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:41.700
It may even mean that since God
knew before we were born,

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:47.100
God predestined us for
Heaven or Hell.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.167
This is a harsh doctrine.

00:41:48.167 --> 00:41:51.600
It gets periodically
rediscovered and then dropped.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.533
It's at the heart of the belief
of the people who

00:41:54.533 --> 00:41:56.733
settled Massachusetts
and Connecticut.

00:41:56.733 --> 00:42:00.867
It is the heart of Calvinism and
of Puritanism, the belief

00:42:00.867 --> 00:42:03.033
in the elect.

00:42:03.033 --> 00:42:06.667
The question is, are these elect
visible or invisible?

00:42:06.667 --> 00:42:08.467
The elect are people who are
going to go to heaven.

00:42:11.267 --> 00:42:13.033
Are they visible?

00:42:13.033 --> 00:42:17.733
Can we say, this guy is so good,
he's going to heaven?

00:42:17.733 --> 00:42:25.367
This woman is so loving,
nurturing, self-effacing,

00:42:25.367 --> 00:42:27.867
whatever, she's going
to go to heaven?

00:42:27.867 --> 00:42:30.733
That's the notion of
a visible elect.

00:42:30.733 --> 00:42:37.733
An invisible elect is, "We don't
know, we have no idea."

00:42:37.733 --> 00:42:38.933
And this is a crucial
difference.

00:42:38.933 --> 00:42:41.967
Because if you believe in the
visible elect, even if you say

00:42:41.967 --> 00:42:45.633
they're not guaranteed, but
anybody outside of this circle

00:42:45.633 --> 00:42:48.100
is for sure going to
hell, then you

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.833
have Puritan New England.

00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:56.300
You have a small community of
people pursuing perfection.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.767
Or you have the Amish.

00:42:59.767 --> 00:43:05.867
Or you have any small pious
community that believes that

00:43:05.867 --> 00:43:11.033
outside of it is more or less
given over to sin and more or

00:43:11.033 --> 00:43:13.433
less doomed.

00:43:13.433 --> 00:43:17.133
Inside of it, maybe it's not
guaranteed, but your chances

00:43:17.133 --> 00:43:18.433
are much, much better.

00:43:22.167 --> 00:43:28.800
But if you believe that we don't
have a visible elect,

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.133
that we have no idea,
then everybody ought

00:43:32.133 --> 00:43:34.300
to be in the Church.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.233
Everybody ought to have access
to the sacraments that provide

00:43:39.233 --> 00:43:43.133
initiation into the Church.

00:43:43.133 --> 00:43:46.833
You ought to start converting
pagans, even savage pagans.

00:43:46.833 --> 00:43:50.433
You ought to be out there roping
in as many people into

00:43:50.433 --> 00:43:52.333
the church, including people
who don't want to be.

00:43:54.833 --> 00:43:55.900
Because you just never know.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.167
Maybe their kids will be.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:06.567
Augustine is behind ideas of
things like forced conversion.

00:44:06.567 --> 00:44:08.400
As long as they're baptized,
there's a chance

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.333
of them being saved.

00:44:10.333 --> 00:44:15.167
And baptized as infants,
preferably, because baptism

00:44:15.167 --> 00:44:20.700
does not any longer mean, in
Augustine's world, perfection.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.133
It means the beginning.

00:44:22.133 --> 00:44:25.633
It means entering the process.

00:44:28.867 --> 00:44:32.167
So the three things that he is
teaching that are implicit in

00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:36.733
the Confessions and that he is
important for in terms of his

00:44:36.733 --> 00:44:42.567
intellectual impact are his
opposition to perfectionism,

00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:50.600
his exaltation of grace, and
the notion of sin as

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.800
indelible, not solvable.

00:44:57.133 --> 00:45:01.900
Where this becomes of key
historical importance is in

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.267
the Church.

00:45:04.267 --> 00:45:10.433
The Church is a body that can
either be sectarian and small,

00:45:10.433 --> 00:45:17.733
as with the Amish or Puritan New
England, or it can be huge

00:45:17.733 --> 00:45:21.433
and universal, as with the
medieval Catholic Church.

00:45:21.433 --> 00:45:24.400
Augustine stands behind the
medieval Catholic Church,

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:30.200
which is a political body, a
body of doctrine, a structure

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:35.333
ruled by princes, and a
structure that has a

00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:41.000
missionary impact on the
rest of the world.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.967
Now, the papers.

00:45:42.967 --> 00:45:44.100
You have the paper topics.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:48.267
If you didn't get them, come
up and see me after.

00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:50.333
You can choose any one of
them, or you can choose

00:45:50.333 --> 00:45:51.633
something else.

00:45:51.633 --> 00:45:54.533
But if you choose something
else, please talk to your

00:45:54.533 --> 00:45:56.667
teaching fellow or to me.

00:45:56.667 --> 00:45:58.533
And talk to us anyway
about these papers.

00:45:58.533 --> 00:46:01.000
We'll give you plenty
of opportunity to

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.767
bounce ideas off us.

00:46:02.767 --> 00:46:07.533
Now, next week, we talk about
the fall of the Roman Empire.

00:46:07.533 --> 00:46:10.700
But this is implicit in what
we've talked about today,

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.700
because the bottom line is the
Roman Empire is going to fall

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.067
in the West, and the Church
is not going to.

00:46:17.067 --> 00:46:21.000
And so we'll look at how
that works next week.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.267
Thanks.

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.224
Professor Christine
Hayes: So following the

00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:06.366
theophany at the burning bush,
Moses returns to Egypt,

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.626
and he initiates what will
become ultimately a battle of

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:11.760
wills between Pharaoh and God.
 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.650
The story in Exodus has high
drama, and lots of folkloric

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.956
elements, including this contest
between Moses and Aaron on the

00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:22.806
one hand,
and the magicians of Egypt on

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.452
the other hand.
This kind of contest is a very

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:26.710
common literary device.
 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.760
It's a kind of "our boys are
better than your boys" device.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.448
The Egyptian magicians who are
initially able to mimic some of

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:38.440
the plagues that are brought on
by God--they are quickly bested,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.672
and Yahweh's defeat of the
magicians is tantamount to the

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:44.940
defeat of the gods of Egypt.
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.600
There are ten plagues.
 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.494
These include a pollution of
the Nile, swarms of frogs,

00:00:51.494 --> 00:00:55.210
lice, insects,
affliction of livestock,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.859
boils that afflict humans and
animals, lightning and hail,

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.933
locusts, total darkness,
and all of this climaxes in the

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:07.209
death of the firstborn males of
Egypt in one night.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:11.360
And source critics looking at
this material discern numerous,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.750
diverse sources that are
interwoven throughout.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.578
These sources preserve
different traditions on the

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.830
number and the nature of the
plagues,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.813
as well as the principal actors
in the drama:

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:24.170
God, Moses, Aaron.
 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.678
So according to the source
critical analysis,

00:01:27.678 --> 00:01:30.310
no source contains ten plagues.
 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.618
J has eight and E has three,
and P has five,

00:01:32.618 --> 00:01:34.980
and some of them are the same
as one another,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.450
and some of them are different,
and so on.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.982
Some of them are unique to one
source, some are not,

00:01:39.982 --> 00:01:42.117
but ultimately,
the claim is that these have

00:01:42.117 --> 00:01:44.969
all been merged,
and have left us then with an

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.380
overall total of ten.
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.459
This may in fact be true.
 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.356
Nevertheless,
as much as we like to engage

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:52.946
sometimes in this kind of
analysis about the sources that

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.120
have gone into the composition
of the text,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.183
it's also always important to
keep your eye on the final form

00:01:58.183 --> 00:01:59.970
of the text as we've received
it.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.010
Literary analysis that is
sensitive to the larger contours

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.980
of the account will reveal the
artistic hand of the final

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.000
editor.
I have charted this at the top

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.419
of the board here.
 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.974
Some scholars have noticed that
the plagues are organized in

00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:17.300
three sets of three.
 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.262
There are literary links that
connect them and make it clear

00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:22.120
that these are three sets of
three,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.699
followed by the climactic tenth
plague--and again,

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:29.789
three and ten are ideal numbers
in our biblical texts.

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:33.539
Each set of three shares
certain structural and literary

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.127
features.
So in each set,

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:38.532
the first and second plague are
forewarned--that's what the FW

00:02:38.532 --> 00:02:41.379
is on the side--whereas the
third plague is not.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.963
So a warning,
a warning, and then a third

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:43.981
plague;
a warning, a warning,

00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:45.897
and then a third plague;
a warning, a warning,

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:47.240
and then a third plague.
 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.194
In each set,
the first plague is accompanied

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:53.150
by a notation of the time in the
morning.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.179
It's also introduced by God's
speech, when God says,

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.447
"Present yourself before
Pharaoh," and to do this in the

00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:01.748
morning.
So each of the first plagues in

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.900
the sets of three is introduced
this way.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.441
Now the second plague in each
set of three is introduced with

00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:09.919
the divine instruction,
"Go to Pharaoh."

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.458
The third plague in each set
has no forewarning and no

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:16.020
introduction.
So this sort of structural

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.740
repetition creates a crescendo
that leads then to the final and

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.411
most devastating plague,
which is the slaughter of the

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.180
Egyptian firstborn sons.
 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.600
The slaughter may be understood
as measure for measure

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.085
punishment for the Egyptians'
earlier killing of Hebrew

00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:34.874
infants,
but it's represented in the

00:03:34.874 --> 00:03:39.500
biblical text as retaliation for
Egypt's treatment of Israel,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.169
and Israel is referred to as
the firstborn son of Yahweh.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.919
So in Exodus 4:22,
Yahweh tells Moses to say to

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.810
Pharaoh, "Thus says the Lord,
'Israel is my firstborn son.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.849
I have said to you,
"Let my son go,

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.210
that he may worship Me," yet
you refuse to let him go.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.080
Now I will slay your firstborn
son.'"

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.020
So it's seen as retaliation.
 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.430
In this last plague,
God or his angel of death

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.527
passes over Egypt at midnight,
slaying every Egyptian

00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:15.382
firstborn male.
Moses orders each Israelite to

00:04:15.382 --> 00:04:18.836
perform a ritual action,
and this action will protect

00:04:18.836 --> 00:04:20.629
them from the slaughter.
 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.170
The ritual consists of two
parts.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.949
Each family is told to
sacrifice a lamb.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.989
The lamb will then be eaten as
a family meal,

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:32.927
and its blood will be smeared
on the doorposts to mark the

00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:37.209
house so the angel of death
knows to pass over that house,

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.587
--and the pun works in Hebrew,
as well as English,

00:04:39.587 --> 00:04:40.800
which is kind of handy.
 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.579
In addition,
each family is to eat

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:45.180
unleavened bread.
 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.218
So according to Exodus,
this Passover ritual was

00:04:48.218 --> 00:04:52.098
established on Israel's last
night of slavery while the angel

00:04:52.098 --> 00:04:55.654
of death passed over the
dwellings that were marked with

00:04:55.654 --> 00:04:57.783
blood.
The story attests to a

00:04:57.783 --> 00:05:00.675
phenomenon that's long been
observed by biblical

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:04.706
commentators and scholars,
and that is the Israelite

00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:09.110
historicization of preexisting
ritual practices.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.461
In other words,
what we probably have here are

00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:15.589
two older, separate,
springtime rituals.

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:19.666
One would be characteristic of
semi-nomadic pastoralists:

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:24.180
the sacrifice of the first lamb
born in the spring to the deity

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.621
in order to procure favor and
continued blessing on the flocks

00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:31.118
for the spring.
The other would be

00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:32.947
characteristic of
agriculturalists:

00:05:32.947 --> 00:05:36.229
it would be an offering of the
very first barley that would be

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.790
harvested in the spring.
 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.382
It would be quickly ground into
flour and used before it even

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:44.237
has time to ferment,
to quickly offer something to

00:05:44.237 --> 00:05:46.675
the deity, again,
to procure favor for the rest

00:05:46.675 --> 00:05:49.681
of the crop.
It's supposed by many that

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:54.020
Israel was formed from the
merger, or the merging of

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.933
diverse groups,
including farmers and shepherds

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:01.135
in Canaan.
The rituals of these older

00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:05.207
groups were retained and then
linked to the story of the

00:06:05.207 --> 00:06:08.540
enslavement and liberation of
the Hebrews.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.342
So you have older nature
festivals and observances that

00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:12.639
have been historicized.
 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.057
They're associated now with
events in the life of the new

00:06:16.057 --> 00:06:19.108
nation, rather than being
grounded in the cycles of

00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.470
nature.
This may in fact be then part

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.860
of the process of
differentiation from the

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.516
practices of Israel's neighbors,
who would have celebrated these

00:06:27.516 --> 00:06:28.560
springtime rituals.
 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.438
So now the blood of the
sacrificial lamb is said to have

00:06:31.438 --> 00:06:33.949
protected the Hebrews from the
angel of death,

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.856
and the bread now is said to
have been eaten,

00:06:36.856 --> 00:06:40.688
consumed in unleavened form,
because the Hebrews left Egypt

00:06:40.688 --> 00:06:44.171
in such a hurry.
They had no time to allow the

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:46.474
dough to rise.
Historicization;

00:06:46.474 --> 00:06:49.732
and we'll see this
historicization of rituals

00:06:49.732 --> 00:06:51.879
recurring again and again.
 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:55.154
And following the last plague,
Pharaoh finally allows the

00:06:55.154 --> 00:06:58.430
Israelites to go into the desert
to worship their God,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.389
but he quickly changes his
mind, and he sends his infantry

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.089
and his chariots in hot pursuit
of the Israelites,

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:07.028
and they soon find themselves
trapped between the Egyptians

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:09.410
and something referred to as
Yam Suph,

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.070
meaning Reed Sea.
 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.550
It isn't the Red Sea.
 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.348
That's a mistranslation that
occurred very,

00:07:16.348 --> 00:07:18.231
very early on,
so it's led to the notion that

00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:22.374
they were at the Gulf of Aqaba,
or somewhere near the actual

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:26.649
big ocean water.
Some of the Israelites despair,

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.060
and they want to surrender.
 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.253
"Was it for want of graves in
Egypt that you brought us to die

00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:33.300
in the wilderness?
 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.050
What have you done to us,
taking us out of Egypt?

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.954
Is this not the very thing we
told you in Egypt,

00:07:37.954 --> 00:07:39.899
saying let us be,
we will serve the Egyptians,

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:42.870
for it's better for us to serve
the Egyptians than to die in the

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.067
wilderness."
But Moses rallies them,

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:48.409
and then in the moment of
crisis, God intervenes on

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:52.048
Israel's behalf.
Once again, source critics see

00:07:52.048 --> 00:07:55.759
in the account of the parting of
the Reed Sea,

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:59.336
in Exodus 14 and 15,
three different versions of the

00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:01.720
event that have been interwoven.
 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.268
I have to stress,
though, that scholars differ

00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:06.930
very much on where the seams in
the text are,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.600
what parts of the story belong
to J, or E, or P,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.269
so you'll read very,
very different accounts.

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.660
There's some consensus,
but a lot of disagreement.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.935
One thing that most people do
in fact agree on is that the

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:22.555
oldest account of the event is a
poetic fragment that's found in

00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:25.860
Exodus 15,
verses one to 12, in particular.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.552
This is often referred to as
the Song of the Sea,

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:34.090
and here the image is one of
sinking and drowning in the Sea

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.169
of Reeds.
You have a wind that blasts

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.019
from God's nostrils,
the waters stand straight like

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:43.382
a wall,
and at a second blast,

00:08:43.382 --> 00:08:47.292
the sea then covers the
Egyptians, and they sink like a

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:49.610
stone in the majestic waters.
 

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.032
The hymn doesn't anywhere refer
to people crossing over on dry

00:08:54.032 --> 00:08:56.390
land.
It seems to depict a storm at

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.198
sea, almost as if the Egyptians
are in boats,

00:08:59.198 --> 00:09:01.559
and a big wind makes a giant
wave,

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:04.120
and another wind then makes it
crash down on them.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.039
So they're swamped by these
roiling waters.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:10.707
But the name Yam Suph,
Reed Sea, implies a more

00:09:10.707 --> 00:09:13.960
marsh-like setting,
rather than the open sea.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.765
John Collins,
who is a professor here at the

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.114
Divinity School,
points out that this

00:09:19.114 --> 00:09:23.029
image--particularly in poetic
passages--this image of sinking

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:27.539
in deep waters,
occurs often in Hebrew poetry.

00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:30.218
It occurs particularly in the
book of Psalms,

00:09:30.218 --> 00:09:32.470
where it's a metaphor for
distress.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.535
In Psalm 69,
the Psalmist asks God to save

00:09:35.535 --> 00:09:38.750
him, for "waters have come up to
my neck.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.090
/ I sink in deep mire,
where there is no foothold.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.309
I have come into deep waters,
and the flood sweeps over me".

00:09:44.309 --> 00:09:47.784
But a few verses later it's
clear that the poet isn't really

00:09:47.784 --> 00:09:51.259
drowning: this is a metaphor for
his difficult situation.

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:54.320
"More in number than the hairs
of my head are those who hate me

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.364
without cause.
Many are those who would

00:09:56.364 --> 00:09:58.820
destroy me, my enemies who
accuse me falsely."

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.467
So Collins suggests that the
poem in Exodus 15 is celebrating

00:10:03.467 --> 00:10:07.805
and preserving a historical
memory of an escape from or a

00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:11.394
defeat of Pharaoh,
and that the drowning image is

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:14.410
used metaphorically,
as it is elsewhere in Hebrew

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.426
poetry to describe the
Egyptians' humiliation and

00:10:17.426 --> 00:10:20.348
defeat.
Later writers take this poetic

00:10:20.348 --> 00:10:24.541
image and fill out the allusion
to drowning in this ancient

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.593
song,
and compose the prose accounts

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:30.643
in Exodus 14,
in which the metaphor is

00:10:30.643 --> 00:10:33.593
literalized.
According to these prose

00:10:33.593 --> 00:10:36.521
accounts now,
Pharaoh's army was literally

00:10:36.521 --> 00:10:37.950
drowned in water.
 

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.842
But even in the prose accounts
in Exodus 14,

00:10:41.842 --> 00:10:46.639
we can see a composite of two
intertwined versions.

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:50.539
In the material that's usually
associated with P,

00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:54.440
Moses is depicted as stretching
out his staff,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.777
first to divide the waters,
which stand like a wall so that

00:10:57.777 --> 00:11:00.309
the Israelites can cross over on
dry land;

00:11:00.309 --> 00:11:03.734
and then, he holds out his
staff to bring the waters

00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:05.950
crashing down on the Egyptians.
 

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.568
But according to one little
section--this is just verses 24

00:11:10.568 --> 00:11:13.861
and 25 in Exodus 14;
some attribute this to J--it

00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:17.220
seems that the Egyptians were
stymied by their own chariots.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.946
The image we get there is that
the Israelites are working their

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:23.953
way through the marsh on foot,
and the Egyptians' chariot

00:11:23.953 --> 00:11:25.620
wheels can't make it through the
marsh.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.163
They get stuck in the mud,
and this forces them to give up

00:11:29.163 --> 00:11:31.908
the chase.
So, the final narrative that

00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:35.192
emerges from this long process
of transmission:

00:11:35.192 --> 00:11:38.190
perhaps a core image of escape
on foot,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.472
where chariots are bogged,
a poem that describes the

00:11:41.472 --> 00:11:45.076
defeat in metaphorical terms
using a drowning and sinking

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:47.483
image,
and then prose elaboration on

00:11:47.483 --> 00:11:51.192
these previous traditions that
have a very dramatic element of

00:11:51.192 --> 00:11:54.779
the sea being parted and
crashing down on the Egyptians.

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:57.536
A long process of transmission,
interweaving,

00:11:57.536 --> 00:12:01.045
literary embellishment has gone
into the creation of this

00:12:01.045 --> 00:12:03.049
account in Exodus 14 and 15.
 

00:12:03.049 --> 00:12:07.262
But the story as it stands
reiterates a motif that we've

00:12:07.262 --> 00:12:11.474
seen before: that of the
threatened destruction of God's

00:12:11.474 --> 00:12:13.905
creation,
or God's people,

00:12:13.905 --> 00:12:18.033
by chaotic waters,
and of divine salvation from

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:20.990
that threat.
What's interesting about the

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.634
Song of the Sea,
this poetic fragment in Exodus

00:12:23.634 --> 00:12:26.136
15,
is that here the Hebrews adopt

00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:30.090
the language of Canaanite myth
and apply it to Yahweh.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.408
If you still have that sheet
that was handed out before,

00:12:32.408 --> 00:12:34.009
listing different epithets for
Baal,

00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:36.584
and listing epithets for
Yahweh, it would be handy to

00:12:36.584 --> 00:12:39.009
have that, or to take a look at
it later again,

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:44.478
because the description of
Yahweh is that of a storm god in

00:12:44.478 --> 00:12:47.259
Exodus 15.
He heaps up the waters with a

00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:49.192
blast of wind,
like a storm at sea,

00:12:49.192 --> 00:12:52.320
and this is reminiscent of the
Canaanite storm god Baal,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.139
as you see on your handout.
 

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:56.853
Baal is said to ride on the
clouds, he's a storm god,

00:12:56.853 --> 00:12:58.940
and he's accompanied by wind
and rain.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.524
At the beginning of the rainy
season, Baal opens a slit,

00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:06.238
or makes a slit in the clouds,
and thunders and shakes the

00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:08.985
Earth.
In one important legend that we

00:13:08.985 --> 00:13:12.296
have from the Canaanite texts,
the Ugaritic texts,

00:13:12.296 --> 00:13:15.608
he defeats an adversary who's
known as Prince Sea,

00:13:15.608 --> 00:13:19.241
or Judge River.
After he vanquishes this watery

00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:23.803
foe, he is acclaimed the king of
the gods, and the king of men,

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:27.629
and he is housed in a home,
not a tent as El was.

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:30.956
El was housed in a tent,
but now this Baal is housed in

00:13:30.956 --> 00:13:33.912
a permanent structure,
a home that is on top of a

00:13:33.912 --> 00:13:36.129
mountain, and is built of cedar.
 

00:13:36.129 --> 00:13:39.421
Now, ancient Hebrew
descriptions of Yahweh employ

00:13:39.421 --> 00:13:43.330
very similar language in the
poetic passage here in Exodus

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.210
15, but also in other poetic
passages.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.812
So, for example,
Psalm 68:5, "Extol him who

00:13:49.812 --> 00:13:53.757
rides the clouds,
the Lord is his name," Yahweh

00:13:53.757 --> 00:13:56.630
is his name.
So "Extol him who rides the

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.519
clouds, Yahweh is his name," as
if to say not Baal.

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:02.580
So Yahweh is described like
Baal, as riding on the clouds.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.990
Psalm 29 also employs the
language of a storm god.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.750
"The voice of the Lord is over
the waters.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.408
The God of glory thunders,
the Lord, over the mighty

00:14:10.408 --> 00:14:12.282
waters."
Some scholars think this

00:14:12.282 --> 00:14:15.494
actually was originally a psalm
about Baal that was simply

00:14:15.494 --> 00:14:17.409
adopted and referred to Yahweh.
 

00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:21.169
Images of God engaged in a
battle with some kind of watery

00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:23.279
foe also appear in the Psalms.
 

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.907
Psalm 74: "O,
God, my king from of old,

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:29.019
who brings deliverance
throughout the land;

00:14:29.019 --> 00:14:31.252
it was You who drove back the
sea with Your might,

00:14:31.252 --> 00:14:33.941
who smashed the heads of the
monsters in the waters;" and so

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:35.844
on.
Judges 5 is also another

00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:38.879
ancient song fragment in verses
four to five.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:41.830
It uses the same kind of
imagery.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.582
Now, Michael Coogan,
who's a very important biblical

00:14:44.582 --> 00:14:47.120
scholar and an expert in the
Canaanite texts,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.233
the Ugaritic materials,
has made some intriguing

00:14:50.233 --> 00:14:54.274
observations in connection with
the biblical representation of

00:14:54.274 --> 00:14:57.985
Yahweh in terms that are so
reminiscent of the storm god,

00:14:57.985 --> 00:15:01.490
Baal .
He notes that Baal was the key

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.646
figure in a change,
a change in the religion of

00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:08.648
Canaan,
that happened somewhere between

00:15:08.648 --> 00:15:11.220
1500 and 1200 BCE,
and that is also the

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.146
traditional time for what we
think of as the Exodus and the

00:15:15.146 --> 00:15:19.007
introduction of Yahwism,
or the differentiation of

00:15:19.007 --> 00:15:20.664
Yahwism.
At this time,

00:15:20.664 --> 00:15:24.715
somewhere in this period,
there was a transfer of power

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:29.590
in the Canaanite pantheon from
the older gods to younger gods.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.678
The older god El,
the sky god,

00:15:31.678 --> 00:15:34.775
was replaced by the younger
storm god, Baal,

00:15:34.775 --> 00:15:39.240
and he was replaced by virtue
of his defeat of Prince Sea,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.200
or whoever this watery foe is.
 

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.309
So El is replaced by Baal after
a defeat of some watery foe.

00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:50.220
Coogan notes that about the
same time, there seems to have

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.200
been a similar change in many of
the world's traditions,

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.500
or many of the traditions of
the region.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.645
We have a younger storm god who
usurps power from an older god

00:16:00.645 --> 00:16:03.500
by virtue of a victory over a
water god.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.444
Remember Enuma Elish,
which we read at the very

00:16:06.444 --> 00:16:08.000
beginning of the semester.
 

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.072
You have the young storm god,
Marduk, who defeats Tiamat,

00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:14.690
the watery ferocious deep
monster,

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:19.697
and does so by blasting a wind
into her, and so establishes his

00:16:19.697 --> 00:16:24.279
claim to rule,
instead of the old sky god, Anu.

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:28.615
In India, the storm god Indra
about this time assumes the

00:16:28.615 --> 00:16:31.169
place of a previous god,
Dyaus.

00:16:31.169 --> 00:16:34.511
In Greece, Zeus,
who is associated with a storm,

00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:38.278
thunder--lightening bolts you
think of in the hands of

00:16:38.278 --> 00:16:42.233
Zeus--he replaces Kronos,
who had been the head of the

00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:44.173
pantheon.
And so here in Exodus,

00:16:44.173 --> 00:16:47.333
we find that just as the nation
of Israel is coming into

00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:49.751
existence,
just as the Israelites are

00:16:49.751 --> 00:16:53.287
making the transition from a
nomadic existence to a more

00:16:53.287 --> 00:16:56.629
settled way of life ultimately
in their own land,

00:16:56.629 --> 00:17:00.991
there seems to be a collective
memory of a similar change in

00:17:00.991 --> 00:17:03.982
her religion.
Like the storm gods in the

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:08.254
myths of Israel's neighbors,
Yahweh heaps up the waters with

00:17:08.254 --> 00:17:11.350
a blast of wind.
He wins a stunning victory,

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:15.109
he establishes himself as the
god of the Israelites in place

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:18.167
of El, who was worshipped by
Israel's patriarchs,

00:17:18.167 --> 00:17:20.676
remember.
And like the Canaanite god,

00:17:20.676 --> 00:17:23.192
Baal, Yahweh,
as we will see as we continue

00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:26.717
to read the text,
will eventually want a house

00:17:26.717 --> 00:17:31.207
for himself atop a mountain,
Mount Zion, and it will be

00:17:31.207 --> 00:17:32.869
lined with cedar.
 

00:17:32.869 --> 00:17:35.873
There are of course,
important ways in which

00:17:35.873 --> 00:17:39.785
Israel's use of the storm god
motif diverges from that of

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:42.509
other Ancient Near Eastern
stories.

00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:47.584
The most important is that
Yahweh's battle is a historic

00:17:47.584 --> 00:17:51.089
battle, rather than a mythic
battle.

00:17:51.089 --> 00:17:56.529
The sea is not Yahweh's
opponent, nor is Yahweh's enemy

00:17:56.529 --> 00:17:59.786
another god.
Yahweh is doing battle here

00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:02.863
with a human foe,
the Egyptian pharaoh and his

00:18:02.863 --> 00:18:06.059
army.
The sea is a weapon deployed.

00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:09.903
It's a weapon in the divine
arsenal, and it's deployed on

00:18:09.903 --> 00:18:11.549
behalf of Israel,
but,

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:15.149
again, Yahweh is depicted by
the biblical writer as

00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:18.604
transcending nature,
using forces of nature for a

00:18:18.604 --> 00:18:22.235
historical purpose,
acting in history to deliver

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:25.410
his people, and create a new
nation, Israel.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.244
So just as in Genesis 1,
the universe is created when

00:18:29.244 --> 00:18:32.490
the wind of God parts the
primeval waters,

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.190
so in Exodus 14 and 15,
a new nation is created when

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.890
the wind of God parts the waters
of the Reed Sea.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.810
But to describe what was
understood to be a historic

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.106
event, a one time event,
not a recurring mythical event,

00:18:46.106 --> 00:18:49.137
but a historic event,
the ancient Israelites employed

00:18:49.137 --> 00:18:52.284
language and images drawn
naturally from the traditions

00:18:52.284 --> 00:18:55.140
and myths of their broader
cultural context,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.570
or I should say,
that were the cultural context

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.420
in which they themselves
existed,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.146
while at the same time
differentiating themselves to

00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:06.274
some degree.
Now, as has long been noted,

00:19:06.274 --> 00:19:10.557
the Exodus event became the
paradigm of God's salvation of

00:19:10.557 --> 00:19:13.138
his people,
and when I say salvation,

00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:16.624
I don't mean that in the later
Christian sense of personal

00:19:16.624 --> 00:19:17.970
salvation from sin.
 

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.757
That's a notion that's
anachronistically read back into

00:19:21.757 --> 00:19:23.090
the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.877
It's not there.
Salvation in the Hebrew Bible

00:19:25.877 --> 00:19:29.179
does not refer to an
individual's deliverance from a

00:19:29.179 --> 00:19:31.776
sinful nature.
This is not a concept we find

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:32.859
in the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:35.288
It refers instead,
to the concrete,

00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:39.358
collective, communal salvation
from national suffering and

00:19:39.358 --> 00:19:42.141
oppression,
particularly in the form of

00:19:42.141 --> 00:19:43.980
foreign rule or enslavement.
 

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.019
When biblical writers speak of
Yahweh as Israel's redeemer and

00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:52.058
savior, they are referring to
Yahweh's physical deliverance of

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:54.839
the nation from the hands of her
foes.

00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:57.826
We're going to see this
increasingly as we move to the

00:19:57.826 --> 00:19:59.009
prophetic material.
 

00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:03.123
So the exodus is a paradigm for
salvation, but it would be a

00:20:03.123 --> 00:20:06.050
mistake, I think,
to view the Exodus as the

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.700
climax of the preceding
narrative.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.483
We've gotten to this point now:
we had this big dramatic scene

00:20:12.483 --> 00:20:15.290
at the Reed Sea,
but the physical redemption of

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.220
the Israelites is not in fact
the end of our story.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.956
It's a dramatic way-station in
a story that's going to reach

00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:25.819
its climax in the covenant that
will be concluded at Sinai,

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:29.319
and as many sensitive readers
of the Bible have noted,

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:33.149
the road from Egypt leads not
to the other side of the Reed

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.799
Sea, but on to Sinai.
 

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:37.873
God's redemption of the
Israelites is a redemption for a

00:20:37.873 --> 00:20:41.171
purpose, a purpose that doesn't
become clear until we get to

00:20:41.171 --> 00:20:43.656
Sinai,
for at Sinai the Israelites

00:20:43.656 --> 00:20:47.010
will become God's people,
bound by a covenant.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.480
And so the story continues.
 

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.809
In the third month,
after the Exodus,

00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:55.109
the Israelites arrive at the
wilderness of Sinai,

00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:58.725
and they encamp at the mountain
where Moses was first called by

00:20:58.725 --> 00:20:59.950
God, the text says.
 

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:05.007
The covenant concluded at Sinai
is referred to as the Mosaic

00:21:05.007 --> 00:21:07.438
covenant.
So this is now our third

00:21:07.438 --> 00:21:09.610
covenant that we have
encountered;

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.220
we will have one more coming.
 

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.642
And the Mosaic covenant differs
radically from the Noahide and

00:21:14.642 --> 00:21:17.785
the Abrahamic or patriarchal
covenants that we've already

00:21:17.785 --> 00:21:20.347
seen,
because here God makes no

00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:25.039
promises beyond being the patron
or protector of Israel;

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:28.816
and also, in this covenant,
he sets terms that require

00:21:28.816 --> 00:21:32.380
obedience to a variety of laws
and commandments.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.888
So the Mosaic covenant is
neither unilateral--this is now

00:21:36.888 --> 00:21:39.793
a bilateral covenant,
mutual, reciprocal

00:21:39.793 --> 00:21:42.718
obligations--nor is it
unconditional like the other

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.240
two.
It is conditional.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.519
So this is our first bilateral,
conditional covenant.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:53.736
If Israel doesn't fulfill her
obligations by obeying God's

00:21:53.736 --> 00:21:57.700
Torah, his instructions,
and living in accordance with

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.430
his will, as expressed in the
laws and instructions,

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:05.502
then God will not fulfill his
obligation of protection and

00:22:05.502 --> 00:22:07.359
blessing towards Israel.
 

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:11.443
Now, the biblical scholar Jon
Levenson, here,

00:22:11.443 --> 00:22:16.455
maintains that historical
critical scholarship has been

00:22:16.455 --> 00:22:21.808
unkind to biblical Israel,
because of a pervasive bias

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:27.609
between the two main foci of the
religion of ancient Israel.

00:22:27.609 --> 00:22:30.475
Those are (1) the Torah,
or the law-- understood as the

00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:33.442
law--not a great translation,
I prefer instruction,

00:22:33.442 --> 00:22:36.589
but Torah, taken to mean the
law on the one hand;

00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:38.880
and, (2) the temple on the
other.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.269
He says that,
on the one hand,

00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:46.131
negative stereotypes rooted in
Paul's condemnation of Mosaic

00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:50.828
law as a deadening curse from
which belief in Jesus offers

00:22:50.828 --> 00:22:56.019
liberation--that account colors
scholarly accounts of the giving

00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:59.027
of the Torah.
On the other hand,

00:22:59.027 --> 00:23:02.858
a Protestant distaste for
priest-centered cultic ritual

00:23:02.858 --> 00:23:05.910
colors scholarly accounts of the
temple,

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.720
and its meaning for ancient
Israelites.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.867
These biases are so much
embedded in our culture,

00:23:11.867 --> 00:23:15.934
he says, they permeate the work
of even secular scholars of the

00:23:15.934 --> 00:23:19.383
Bible,
so that a negative view of the

00:23:19.383 --> 00:23:24.039
law affects interpretation of
the book of Exodus.

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:28.070
Scholars tend to place great
emphasis on the deliverance from

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.430
Egypt as the high point in the
Exodus narrative,

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.093
rather than the more natural
literary climax,

00:23:34.093 --> 00:23:37.361
which is the conclusion of the
covenant at Mount Sinai,

00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:39.420
and the delivery of the Torah.
 

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.045
So Levenson,
in his book Sinai and

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:46.130
Zion, tries to correct this
prejudicial treatment.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.306
He says he seeks to give the
two central institutions of

00:23:49.306 --> 00:23:51.962
Torah on the one hand,
and Temple on the other,

00:23:51.962 --> 00:23:54.081
a fair hearing.
So in his book,

00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:57.691
Sinai and Zion,
Levenson explores what he calls

00:23:57.691 --> 00:24:01.164
the two great mountain
traditions that express these

00:24:01.164 --> 00:24:03.820
central concepts:
the tradition of Mount

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.430
Sinai--that's where Israel
received the Torah,

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.579
and entered into this defining
covenantal relationship with

00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:14.000
God--and then on the other hand,
the tradition of Mount Zion.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.866
Zion will be the future site of
the nation's holy temple in

00:24:16.866 --> 00:24:19.474
Jerusalem.
Mount Zion is in Jerusalem,

00:24:19.474 --> 00:24:23.430
it's the Temple Mount today
where the mosque now is.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:27.335
Today, we'll consider
Levenson's analysis of the Sinai

00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:32.200
tradition as an entrée into the
Israelite concept of the Torah,

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.857
and the covenant bond,
its meaning and its

00:24:34.857 --> 00:24:37.378
implications.
Levenson stresses the

00:24:37.378 --> 00:24:40.180
importance of the covenant
formulary.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.327
There are Ancient Near Eastern
parallels to the Sinai covenant

00:24:44.327 --> 00:24:48.680
of the Bible--especially Hittite
treaties that date 1500 to 1200,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.131
or so;
also Assyrian treaties in about

00:24:51.131 --> 00:24:53.646
the eighth century,
but they are in many ways

00:24:53.646 --> 00:24:57.189
continuous with what you find in
the Hittite treaties--treaties

00:24:57.189 --> 00:24:59.190
between a suzerain and vassal.
 

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.395
Remember we talked about two
types of treaties:

00:25:01.395 --> 00:25:03.410
suzerainty treaties and parity
treaties.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.373
Parity treaties between equals,
but suzerainty treaties are

00:25:06.373 --> 00:25:08.928
between a suzerain,
who has a position obviously of

00:25:08.928 --> 00:25:10.869
power and authority,
and a vassal.

00:25:10.869 --> 00:25:14.256
He details the following six
elements, which I hope you can

00:25:14.256 --> 00:25:17.000
all see , especially in the
Hittite treaties.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.942
They're not all found in every
treaty, but they're often enough

00:25:19.942 --> 00:25:22.220
found that we can speak of these
six elements.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.920
First there is a preamble.
 

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.130
That's found in every one.
 

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.049
The suzerain identifies himself.
 

00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:29.318
Second of all,
there's generally an account of

00:25:29.318 --> 00:25:32.293
the historical circumstances
that are leading to the treaty:

00:25:32.293 --> 00:25:34.309
so some kind of historical
prologue.

00:25:34.309 --> 00:25:38.704
Then we usually have some sort
of set of stipulations and

00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:42.000
requirements,
upon the vassal generally.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.261
Fourth, there's generally some
arrangement, either for the

00:25:46.261 --> 00:25:49.550
publication of the treaty,
or its deposition,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.839
its safe-keeping in some sort
of shrine.

00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:55.975
There is generally a concluding
invocation of witnesses,

00:25:55.975 --> 00:25:59.509
usually the gods are invoked as
witnesses to a binding oath,

00:25:59.509 --> 00:26:04.483
some kind of covenantal oath
that brings the treaty into

00:26:04.483 --> 00:26:07.829
effect, and it's witnessed by
gods.

00:26:07.829 --> 00:26:11.147
Lastly, there will be very
often a list of blessings for

00:26:11.147 --> 00:26:14.103
the party who obeys,
and curses for the party that

00:26:14.103 --> 00:26:15.430
violates the pact.
 

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:19.115
The curses are particularly
emphasized in the Assyrian

00:26:19.115 --> 00:26:22.573
treaties.
Levenson then identifies many

00:26:22.573 --> 00:26:27.960
of these elements in Yahweh's
very first speech to Moses.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:33.889
Moses and the Israelites arrive
at Sinai, in Exodus 19,

00:26:33.889 --> 00:26:39.160
and God says the following in
verses 3b to 8:

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.781
The Lord called to him
from the mountain,

00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:45.202
saying, "Thus shall you say to
the house of Jacob and declare

00:26:45.202 --> 00:26:48.279
to the children of Israel:
'You have seen what I did to

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:51.084
the Egyptians,
how I bore you on eagles' wings

00:26:51.084 --> 00:26:52.319
and brought you to Me.
 

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:55.815
Now then, if you will obey Me
faithfully and keep My covenant,

00:26:55.815 --> 00:26:58.622
you shall be My treasured
possession among all the

00:26:58.622 --> 00:27:01.065
peoples.
Indeed, all the earth is Mine,

00:27:01.065 --> 00:27:04.166
but you shall be to Me a
kingdom of priests and a holy

00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:06.111
nation.'
These are the words that you

00:27:06.111 --> 00:27:07.970
shall speak to the children of
Israel."

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.431
Moses came and summoned the
elders of the people and put

00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:12.670
before them all that the Lord
had commanded him.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.630
All the people answered as one,
saying, "All that the Lord has

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.650
spoken we will do!"
 

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.772
And Moses brought back the
people's words to the

00:27:18.772 --> 00:27:20.066
Lord.
So Levenson,

00:27:20.066 --> 00:27:22.893
who draws actually on
long-standing work by other

00:27:22.893 --> 00:27:25.310
scholars,
and earlier in the twentieth

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.876
century even,
Levenson finds several of the

00:27:27.876 --> 00:27:31.236
main elements of the Hittite
suzerainty treaties in this

00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:34.290
speech.
So verse 4, "You've seen what I

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.734
did to the Egyptians,
how I bore you on eagles'

00:27:37.734 --> 00:27:40.579
wings," is the historical
prologue.

00:27:40.579 --> 00:27:43.166
That's the reason that we're in
the situation we're in now,

00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:44.369
and making this covenant.
 

00:27:44.369 --> 00:27:47.119
Verse 5 contains God's
stipulations.

00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:50.032
It's a very general
condition--"If you obey my

00:27:50.032 --> 00:27:51.817
laws."
Basically, keep my covenant,

00:27:51.817 --> 00:27:53.809
obey me faithfully,
that's the conditional.

00:27:53.809 --> 00:27:57.273
That's going to be filled out
and articulated at great length

00:27:57.273 --> 00:28:00.795
in the subsequent chapters when
all the laws they have to obey

00:28:00.795 --> 00:28:03.626
are spelled out.
The second half of verse 5 and

00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:06.030
6 gives the reward:
God is conferring on the

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.440
Israelites this elevated status
of royalty, of priesthood;

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.430
"You'll be to me a kingdom of
priests, and a holy nation."

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.611
In verse 8, the people solemnly
undertake to fulfill the terms

00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:18.279
of the covenant,
so we have at least three of

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:21.120
the steps that we find in the
Hittite treaties,

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.428
as well.
If we take a broader view of

00:28:23.428 --> 00:28:26.627
the full biblical account of
Israel's covenant with God,

00:28:26.627 --> 00:28:29.477
all six elements can be
identified in the biblical

00:28:29.477 --> 00:28:31.881
narrative.
They're scattered throughout

00:28:31.881 --> 00:28:32.920
the text, however.
 

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.707
We have the preamble,
and the historical background

00:28:35.707 --> 00:28:39.107
to the covenant in God's summary
introduction to the people in

00:28:39.107 --> 00:28:42.285
Exodus 20: "I am Yahweh who
brought you out of the land of

00:28:42.285 --> 00:28:44.009
Egypt."
It sums it all up:

00:28:44.009 --> 00:28:46.065
introduction,
who I am, and why we are

00:28:46.065 --> 00:28:47.509
historically connected.
 

00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:50.397
So this fact of God's bringing
Israel out of Egypt,

00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:53.400
presumably establishes God's
claim to sovereignty.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.377
The terms of the treaty are
then stipulated at great length

00:28:56.377 --> 00:28:59.149
in the instructions that are
found in Exodus chapter 20

00:28:59.149 --> 00:29:00.329
through chapter 23.
 

00:29:00.329 --> 00:29:04.546
Moses reads the book of the
covenant--it's called the Scroll

00:29:04.546 --> 00:29:08.619
of the Covenant--publicly:
this is said in Exodus 24:7.

00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:11.536
In Deuteronomy we read that it
will be deposited for

00:29:11.536 --> 00:29:13.309
safekeeping in a special ark.
 

00:29:13.309 --> 00:29:17.894
The Israelites vow that they'll
obey Exodus 24:3,

00:29:17.894 --> 00:29:20.439
also 7b.
The covenant is then sealed by

00:29:20.439 --> 00:29:24.040
a formal ritual.
In this case it's a sacrifice

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.217
in Exodus 24:8.
In a monotheistic system you

00:29:27.217 --> 00:29:30.533
can't really call upon other
gods to be witnesses to the

00:29:30.533 --> 00:29:34.116
sealing of the oath,
so we have heaven and earth

00:29:34.116 --> 00:29:37.860
being invoked as
witnesses--Deuteronomy 4:26;

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.722
Deuteronomy 30:19;
31:28--heaven and earth,

00:29:41.722 --> 00:29:45.583
the idea being perhaps the
inhabitants thereof should

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:48.299
witness.
As for blessings and curses,

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:51.623
we have a long list of each
found in Leviticus 26,

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:54.880
and Deuteronomy 28,
also interesting reading.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.880
Some of these curses,
particularly the ones in

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.814
Deuteronomy bear a very striking
resemblance to curses in an

00:30:01.814 --> 00:30:05.748
Assyrian treaty that we have
that dates to about 677 BCE the

00:30:05.748 --> 00:30:09.616
Assyrian king Esarhaddon--and
many of the curses are really

00:30:09.616 --> 00:30:11.549
almost word for word.
 

00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:14.972
So while no one passage
contains all of the elements of

00:30:14.972 --> 00:30:18.091
the Hittite treaty form,
there are enough of them

00:30:18.091 --> 00:30:21.891
scattered around to suggest it
as a model, as well as its later

00:30:21.891 --> 00:30:24.160
instantiation in Assyrian
culture.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.599
So what's the meaning of this?
 

00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:30.028
Why does it matter that Israel
understands its relationship

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:33.693
with God, and uses the covenant
as a vehicle for expressing its

00:30:33.693 --> 00:30:37.973
relationship with God,
the vehicle of the suzerainty

00:30:37.973 --> 00:30:40.298
treaty?
According to Levenson,

00:30:40.298 --> 00:30:44.078
the use of a suzerainty treaty
as a model for Israel's

00:30:44.078 --> 00:30:48.000
relationship to Yahweh,
expresses several key ideas.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.579
It captures several key ideas.
 

00:30:50.579 --> 00:30:54.964
First, the historical prologue
that's so central to the

00:30:54.964 --> 00:30:58.536
suzerainty treaty,
grounds the obligations of

00:30:58.536 --> 00:31:03.569
Israel to Yahweh in the history
of his acts on her behalf.

00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:05.842
So it's grounded in a
historical moment,

00:31:05.842 --> 00:31:09.397
and we'll come back to this and
what that might mean about her

00:31:09.397 --> 00:31:10.680
perception of God.
 

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.777
Second, the historical prologue
bridges the gap between

00:31:14.777 --> 00:31:18.243
generations.
Israel's past and present and

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:21.807
future generations form a
collective entity,

00:31:21.807 --> 00:31:26.200
Israel, that collectively
assents to the covenant.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.100
And even today,
at Passover ceremonies

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.019
everywhere, Jews are reminded to
see themselves,

00:31:33.019 --> 00:31:35.522
they're reminded of the
obligation to see themselves as

00:31:35.522 --> 00:31:37.329
if they personally came out of
Egypt,

00:31:37.329 --> 00:31:40.259
and personally covenanted with
God.

00:31:40.259 --> 00:31:44.757
The historical prologue,
thirdly, explains why Israel

00:31:44.757 --> 00:31:49.599
accepts her place in the
suzerain-vassal relationship.

00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:53.788
Israel's acceptance of a
relationship with God doesn't

00:31:53.788 --> 00:31:56.316
stem from mystical
introspection,

00:31:56.316 --> 00:32:00.109
or philosophical speculation,
Levenson says.

00:32:00.109 --> 00:32:02.846
Instead the Israelites are
affirming their identity and

00:32:02.846 --> 00:32:05.329
their relationship with God by
telling a story,

00:32:05.329 --> 00:32:10.390
a story whose moral can only be
that God is reliable.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.882
Israel can rely on God,
just as a vassal can rely on

00:32:13.882 --> 00:32:16.297
his suzerain.
The goal is not,

00:32:16.297 --> 00:32:20.027
Levenson says,
ultimately the affirmation of

00:32:20.027 --> 00:32:23.930
God's suzerainty in a purely
verbal sense.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:28.619
The point is not mere verbal
acclaim of God as suzerain.

00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:32.316
Levenson points out that the
affirmation of God's suzerainty

00:32:32.316 --> 00:32:35.574
is rendered in the form of
obedience to commandments,

00:32:35.574 --> 00:32:37.579
not mere verbal acclamation.
 

00:32:37.579 --> 00:32:40.442
Observance of God's
commandments is,

00:32:40.442 --> 00:32:43.958
as Levenson puts it,
the teleological end of

00:32:43.958 --> 00:32:46.690
history.
Why is that important?

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:50.426
Unless we recognize that the
road from Egypt leads

00:32:50.426 --> 00:32:54.086
inextricably to Sinai,
that the story of national

00:32:54.086 --> 00:32:57.670
liberation issues in and is
subordinate to,

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:01.002
is ultimately subordinate to,
the obligation to God's

00:33:01.002 --> 00:33:04.400
covenantal stipulations and
observance of his laws,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.606
then we run the risk of doing
what has been done for some

00:33:07.606 --> 00:33:10.126
centuries now:
of reading Exodus as first and

00:33:10.126 --> 00:33:12.759
foremost a story of a miraculous
delivery,

00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:15.240
rather than the story of a
relationship,

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.929
which is expressed through
obligations to the observance of

00:33:18.929 --> 00:33:20.647
specific laws,
commandments,

00:33:20.647 --> 00:33:22.109
and instructions.
 

00:33:22.109 --> 00:33:25.880
The suzerain-vassal model has
further implications.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.730
Levenson and other scholars,
point many of these out.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.547
Just as the Ancient Near
Eastern suzerainty treaties

00:33:32.547 --> 00:33:36.589
specified that vassals of a
suzerain are to treat other

00:33:36.589 --> 00:33:40.637
vassals of the suzerain well,
Israelites are bound to one

00:33:40.637 --> 00:33:43.208
another then as vassals of the
same suzerain,

00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:45.369
and are to treat one another
well.

00:33:45.369 --> 00:33:50.160
So covenant in Israel becomes
the basis of social ethics.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.767
It's the reason that God gives
instructions regarding the

00:33:53.767 --> 00:33:56.279
treatment of one's fellow
Israelites.

00:33:56.279 --> 00:34:00.739
So the suzerain-vassal
relationship grounds the social

00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:02.589
ethic within Israel.
 

00:34:02.589 --> 00:34:06.110
Also, just as a vassal cannot
serve two suzerains--that's

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.500
pretty explicit in all the
treaties,

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.768
you owe exclusive service to
your suzerain--so the covenant

00:34:12.768 --> 00:34:17.110
with God entails the notion of
Israel's exclusive service of

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.503
Yahweh.
The assertion is not that there

00:34:20.503 --> 00:34:24.170
is no other god,
but that Israel will have no

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.420
other god before Yahweh.
 

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.399
The jealousy of the suzerain is
the motivation for prohibitions

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:33.479
against certain intimate
contacts with non-Yahweh

00:34:33.479 --> 00:34:36.261
peoples,
because these alliances will

00:34:36.261 --> 00:34:40.500
end up entailing recognition of
the gods of these peoples.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.760
The covenant with Yahweh will
also, we shall see soon,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.780
preclude alliances with other
human competitors.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.258
If Israel serves a divine king,
she can't, for example,

00:34:52.258 --> 00:34:55.286
serve a human king,
and that's an idea that will

00:34:55.286 --> 00:34:57.670
express itself in biblical
texts,

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.878
as we'll see,
that are clearly opposed to the

00:35:00.878 --> 00:35:03.429
creation of a monarchy in
Israel.

00:35:03.429 --> 00:35:07.782
Not everyone was onboard with
the idea that Israel should be

00:35:07.782 --> 00:35:10.592
ruled by a king.
So there are texts that will

00:35:10.592 --> 00:35:13.294
object to the creation of the
monarchy of King Saul,

00:35:13.294 --> 00:35:14.829
and King David,
and so on.

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:18.172
There are also texts that are
going to object to alliances

00:35:18.172 --> 00:35:21.271
with any foreign king,
or subservience to any foreign

00:35:21.271 --> 00:35:24.090
king, whether it's Egypt or
Assyria or Babylonia.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.374
So subservience to a human
king, native or foreign,

00:35:27.374 --> 00:35:30.856
is in these texts considered a
rejection of the divine

00:35:30.856 --> 00:35:32.965
kingship,
which is the ideal--the

00:35:32.965 --> 00:35:35.530
exclusive kingship of
Yahweh--and it's seen as a

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:36.949
breach of the covenant.
 

00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:41.266
Now, Ancient Near Eastern
suzerainty models also speak

00:35:41.266 --> 00:35:45.420
repeatedly of the vassal's love
for the suzerain.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.449
Vassal so-and-so will love the
Assyrian lord so-and-so,

00:35:48.449 --> 00:35:51.422
and that's an element that is
not absent at all in the

00:35:51.422 --> 00:35:54.340
biblical texts that deal with
the covenant bond.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.949
The Israelites promise to serve
and to love Yahweh.

00:35:57.949 --> 00:36:01.024
That's an additional theme
that's associated regularly with

00:36:01.024 --> 00:36:02.949
the covenant.
It's one that we'll take up in

00:36:02.949 --> 00:36:04.682
greater detail,
though, when we get to the book

00:36:04.682 --> 00:36:06.776
of Deuteronomy,
where it is stressed to a

00:36:06.776 --> 00:36:09.610
greater degree than it is in
Exodus, but for now,

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.440
we can accept Levenson's claim
that Sinai represents an

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.686
intersection of law and love,
because of the use of the

00:36:17.686 --> 00:36:19.159
suzerainty model.
 

00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:22.577
So the covenant concept is
critical to the Bible's

00:36:22.577 --> 00:36:26.902
portrayal and understanding of
the relationship between God and

00:36:26.902 --> 00:36:29.866
Israel.
The entire history of Israel,

00:36:29.866 --> 00:36:34.109
as portrayed by biblical
writers, is going to be governed

00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:37.670
by this one outstanding reality
of covenant.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:42.361
Israel's fortunes will be seen
to ride on the degree of its

00:36:42.361 --> 00:36:44.949
faithfulness to this covenant.
 

00:36:44.949 --> 00:36:48.944
The book of Exodus closes,
with the construction of the

00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:52.570
sanctuary, and when the
sanctuary is completed,

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:55.630
the text says the presence of
the Lord filled the tabernacle.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.980
This is a sign of divine
approval.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.854
The long section where we have
the receipt of the instructions

00:37:01.854 --> 00:37:05.396
for the building of the temple,
and then we have an actual

00:37:05.396 --> 00:37:07.898
account of those instructions
being fulfilled,

00:37:07.898 --> 00:37:10.061
not the temple,
tabernacle, excuse me:

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:13.071
it's just a tent structure at
this stage--so receiving the

00:37:13.071 --> 00:37:16.610
instructions and then the actual
construction of the tabernacle,

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.101
that extends from Exodus 25 to
the end of the book,

00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:23.416
Exodus 40;
but it's interrupted in Exodus

00:37:23.416 --> 00:37:27.791
32 by the account of the
Israelites' apostasy with the

00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:32.579
golden calf, which is a great
and very ambiguous story.

00:37:32.579 --> 00:37:37.659
The moment of Israel's greatest
glory is to be the moment of her

00:37:37.659 --> 00:37:40.558
greatest shame.
As Moses receives God's

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:44.147
covenant on Mount Sinai--he's
there at the top of Sinai

00:37:44.147 --> 00:37:47.735
communing with God-- the
Israelites who are encamped at

00:37:47.735 --> 00:37:50.659
the foot of the mountain grow
restless,

00:37:50.659 --> 00:37:52.960
and rebellious,
and they demand of Aaron a god,

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.960
because they don't know what's
become of "this fellow Moses."

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.010
They say: what about this guy,
Moses?

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.909
They use a very colloquial kind
of term to dismiss him.

00:38:00.909 --> 00:38:04.675
So Aaron, feeling the heat,
makes a golden calf,

00:38:04.675 --> 00:38:08.316
and the people bow down to it,
and someone declares,

00:38:08.316 --> 00:38:10.778
"This is your God,
oh Israel, who brought you out

00:38:10.778 --> 00:38:12.059
of the land of Egypt."
 

00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:15.764
Well, an enraged God tells
Moses: You know what's going on

00:38:15.764 --> 00:38:18.065
down there?
And he tells him to descend

00:38:18.065 --> 00:38:19.090
from the mountain.
 

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.921
The people are sinning,
they've already gone astray,

00:38:21.921 --> 00:38:23.420
and he says:
I'm through.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.302
I want to destroy the nation,
and I'm going to start a new

00:38:26.302 --> 00:38:27.869
nation again from you,
Moses.

00:38:27.869 --> 00:38:31.140
Moses manages to placate God
momentarily, and then he turns

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.719
around to face the people.
 

00:38:32.719 --> 00:38:34.793
He comes down from the
mountain, he approaches the

00:38:34.793 --> 00:38:36.360
camp, he's stunned by what he
sees.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.053
He's carrying the tablets,
the instructions,

00:38:39.053 --> 00:38:43.000
and then he smashes them at the
foot of the mountain in fury.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.050
He manages to halt the
activities.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.099
He punishes the perpetrators,
he has a few choice words for

00:38:48.099 --> 00:38:51.199
Aaron.
This temporary alienation from

00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:56.113
God is ultimately repaired
through Moses' intense prayer

00:38:56.113 --> 00:38:57.900
and intercession.
 

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.247
It actually takes several
chapters to reach a resolution,

00:39:01.247 --> 00:39:03.280
and God pouts for quite a
while,

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.037
but a renewal of the covenant
does occur, and another set of

00:39:07.037 --> 00:39:10.094
stone tablets is given,
and according to one rabbinic

00:39:10.094 --> 00:39:12.770
text the broken tablets,
as well as the new tablets,

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.269
are both placed in the ark.
 

00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:19.241
And this embarrassing episode
is just the beginning of a

00:39:19.241 --> 00:39:23.069
sequence of embarrassing events
that will occur as the

00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:26.969
Israelites move from Egypt
towards the land that's been

00:39:26.969 --> 00:39:28.630
promised to them.
 

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.571
Most of these episodes will
occur in the book of Numbers,

00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:34.670
and they involve the rebellion
of the people in some way,

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:38.117
generally God's fury in
reaction to that rebellion,

00:39:38.117 --> 00:39:41.840
Moses' intervention usually on
behalf of the people,

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.489
and God's appeasement.
 

00:39:45.489 --> 00:39:49.124
The book of Numbers recounts
the itinerary of the Israelites

00:39:49.124 --> 00:39:52.697
throughout the 40 years of their
wanderings and encampments

00:39:52.697 --> 00:39:54.730
around the sacred tabernacle.
 

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.806
The tabernacle always moves in
the center of the tribes,

00:39:57.806 --> 00:40:00.658
and they're positioned in
certain specific positions

00:40:00.658 --> 00:40:02.840
around the tabernacle as they
move.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.780
They stay at Sinai for a year,
I believe, in the text,

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.720
before they begin their
movement, and Numbers contains

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.050
some law, and much narrative
material.

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.373
The material tells of God's
provision for the people in the

00:40:14.373 --> 00:40:17.353
desert, but it also tells of the
Israelites' constant

00:40:17.353 --> 00:40:19.130
complaining, and rebellion.
 

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.971
The Israelites rebel against
Moses and God,

00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:23.730
and they long for Egypt.
 

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.501
There are several times when
God threatens to exterminate

00:40:27.501 --> 00:40:30.329
them, but Moses manages to
dissuade him.

00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:32.014
In Numbers 14,
for example,

00:40:32.014 --> 00:40:35.578
when the Israelites complain
again, God is determined to

00:40:35.578 --> 00:40:37.959
destroy them,
and Moses intervenes,

00:40:37.959 --> 00:40:40.639
and the intervention leads to a
compromise.

00:40:40.639 --> 00:40:44.461
God swears that none of the
adults who witnessed the Exodus

00:40:44.461 --> 00:40:47.360
-- with the exception of Joshua
and Caleb,

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.235
who did not join in the
rebellion -- none of the adults

00:40:50.235 --> 00:40:53.324
who witnessed the Exodus would
see the fulfillment of God's

00:40:53.324 --> 00:40:56.079
salvation,
and enter the Promised Land.

00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:59.561
This means the Israelites will
have to wander for 40 years in

00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:02.927
the desert until all of those
who left Egypt as adults pass

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:05.743
away,
leaving a new generation that

00:41:05.743 --> 00:41:10.252
hasn't really tasted slavery,
to enter the land and form a

00:41:10.252 --> 00:41:12.443
new nation.
The book of Numbers,

00:41:12.443 --> 00:41:15.423
I think, is most remarkable for
the relationship that it

00:41:15.423 --> 00:41:17.320
describes between Moses and God.
 

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.134
I love reading these particular
stories, and just hearing the

00:41:20.134 --> 00:41:22.257
dialogue between them,
and imagining it,

00:41:22.257 --> 00:41:25.250
because the two of them
alternate in losing patience

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.800
with the Israelites,
and wishing to throw them over.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:32.400
But each time the one convinces
the other to be forbearing.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.424
The relationship between Moses
and God is a very intimate one,

00:41:35.424 --> 00:41:37.210
very much like a husband and
wife,

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:40.388
who are working together as
partners and parenting a

00:41:40.388 --> 00:41:43.196
difficult child.
They're partners in the

00:41:43.196 --> 00:41:47.594
preparation of Israel for their
new life, readying Israel for

00:41:47.594 --> 00:41:51.039
life in God's land as a nation,
as a people.

00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:55.452
I'm going to just give you two
examples of the way Moses and

00:41:55.452 --> 00:41:58.219
God act as a check upon each
other.

00:41:58.219 --> 00:42:02.271
The first excerpt is from
Numbers 14, and it shows Moses'

00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:05.019
ability to placate the wrath of
God.

00:42:05.019 --> 00:42:08.292
Now, in this story,
the Israelites express great

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:10.329
fear.
They've just heard a report

00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:13.369
from a reconnaissance team that
scoped out the land,

00:42:13.369 --> 00:42:15.442
and they come back and say:
Oh, boy, you know,

00:42:15.442 --> 00:42:18.159
it looks really bad--and that
they think that the chances of

00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:20.599
conquering the Promised Land are
very, very slim.

00:42:20.599 --> 00:42:22.550
The whole community broke
into loud cries,

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.920
and the people wept that night.
 

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.849
All the Israelites railed
against Moses and Aaron.

00:42:26.849 --> 00:42:29.325
"If only we had died in the
land of Egypt," the whole

00:42:29.325 --> 00:42:31.847
community shouted at them,
"or if only we might die in

00:42:31.847 --> 00:42:34.592
this wilderness!
Why is the Lord taking us to

00:42:34.592 --> 00:42:36.639
that land to fall by the sword?
 

00:42:36.639 --> 00:42:38.409
Our wives and children will be
carried off!

00:42:38.409 --> 00:42:40.690
It would be better for us to go
back to Egypt!"

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:43.519
And they said to one another,
"Let us head back for Egypt."

00:42:43.519 --> 00:42:45.759
… the Presence of the Lord
appeared in the Tent of Meeting

00:42:45.759 --> 00:42:46.670
to all the Israelites.
 

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.170
And the Lord said to Moses,
"How long will this people

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.143
spurn Me, and how long will they
have no faith in Me despite all

00:42:52.143 --> 00:42:54.550
the signs that I have performed
in their midst?

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.085
I will strike them with
pestilence and disown them,

00:42:57.085 --> 00:43:00.280
and I will make of you a nation
far more numerous than they!"

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.315
But Moses said to the Lord,
"When the Egyptians,

00:43:03.315 --> 00:43:07.190
from whose midst You brought up
this people in Your might,

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.319
hear the news,
they will tell it to the

00:43:09.319 --> 00:43:11.000
inhabitants of that land….
 

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.995
If then You slay this people to
a man, the nations who have

00:43:13.995 --> 00:43:16.738
heard Your fame will say,
'It must be because the Lord

00:43:16.738 --> 00:43:19.337
was powerless to bring that
people into the land He had

00:43:19.337 --> 00:43:21.841
promised them on oath that He
slaughtered them in the

00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:23.419
wilderness.'
Therefore, I pray,

00:43:23.419 --> 00:43:25.739
let my Lord's forbearance be…
abounding in kindness;

00:43:25.739 --> 00:43:27.969
forgiving iniquity and
transgression….

00:43:27.969 --> 00:43:30.076
Pardon, I pray,
the iniquity of this people

00:43:30.076 --> 00:43:32.734
according to Your great
kindness, as You have forgiven

00:43:32.734 --> 00:43:34.440
this people ever since Egypt."
 

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.702
And the Lord said,
"I pardon, as you have

00:43:36.702 --> 00:43:39.501
asked…."
So note God's offer to start

00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:41.219
all over again with Moses.
 

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:44.370
This is a pattern with this
god, you know--create,

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:46.750
gets upset, a flood wipes them
out,

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.454
let's start again,
oh, still not too good,

00:43:48.454 --> 00:43:50.699
let's choose one person,
Abraham, see how that goes;

00:43:50.699 --> 00:43:53.308
oh, disappointed,
let's go with Moses--so this is

00:43:53.308 --> 00:43:54.449
a bit of a pattern.
 

00:43:54.449 --> 00:43:57.924
But Moses refuses to accept the
offer, and instead he defends

00:43:57.924 --> 00:43:59.893
the Israelites,
and he averts their

00:43:59.893 --> 00:44:02.622
destruction.
He appeals primarily to God's

00:44:02.622 --> 00:44:06.289
vanity: What will the neighbors
think if you destroy them?

00:44:06.289 --> 00:44:07.750
They'll think you couldn't
fulfill your promise.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:11.269
They'll think you're not the
universal God of history.

00:44:11.269 --> 00:44:14.118
But the roles are reversed in
the following passage,

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:16.800
and this is where the text
blows hot and cold.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.518
In fact, there's a rabbinic
image, there's a rabbinic

00:44:19.518 --> 00:44:22.079
tradition that talks about this
period of time,

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:24.579
and has God and Moses talking,
and God says:

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:27.450
Listen, between the two of us,
whenever I blow hot,

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:29.421
you blow cold,
or when I pour hot water,

00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:31.518
you pour cold,
and when you pour hot,

00:44:31.518 --> 00:44:33.771
I'll pour cold,
and together we'll muddle

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:35.630
through, and get through here.
 

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.400
The Israelites won't be wiped
out.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.482
But in this next passage,
which is Numbers 11,

00:44:39.482 --> 00:44:41.936
Moses is the one who is
impatient with the Israelites'

00:44:41.936 --> 00:44:43.880
constant complaints and lack of
faith,

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.670
and he's ready to throw in the
towel.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:48.989
I'll just read this last
passage.

00:44:48.989 --> 00:44:52.769
The riffraff in their
midst felt a gluttonous craving;

00:44:52.769 --> 00:44:56.388
and then the Israelites wept
and said, 'If only we had meat

00:44:56.388 --> 00:44:58.744
to eat!
We remember the fish that we

00:44:58.744 --> 00:45:01.257
used to eat free in Egypt
Okay, we were slaves,

00:45:01.257 --> 00:45:02.590
but the food was free,
you know?

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:03.019
I just love that line.
 

00:45:03.019 --> 00:45:05.460
We used to eat this fish free
in Egypt.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.725
…the cucumbers,
the melons, the leeks,

00:45:07.725 --> 00:45:09.410
the onions, and the garlic.
 

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.100
Now our gullets are shriveled.
 

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.960
There is nothing at all!
 

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.060
Nothing but this manna to look
at!'

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.045
…
Moses heard the people weeping,

00:45:17.045 --> 00:45:19.359
every clan apart,
each person at the entrance of

00:45:19.359 --> 00:45:21.222
his tent.
The Lord was very angry,

00:45:21.222 --> 00:45:22.599
and Moses was distressed.
 

00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:25.890
And Moses said to the Lord,
"Why have You dealt ill with

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:28.821
Your servant [me],
and why have I not enjoyed Your

00:45:28.821 --> 00:45:30.997
favor,
that You have laid the burden

00:45:30.997 --> 00:45:32.519
of all this people upon me?
 

00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:34.788
Did I conceive all this people,
did I bear them,

00:45:34.788 --> 00:45:37.490
that You should say to me,
'Carry them in your bosom as a

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:40.164
nurse carries an infant,'
to the land that You have

00:45:40.164 --> 00:45:41.949
promised on oath to their
fathers?

00:45:41.949 --> 00:45:44.504
Where am I to get meat to give
to all this people,

00:45:44.504 --> 00:45:47.579
when they whine before me and
say, 'Give us meat to eat!'

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:50.148
I cannot carry all this people
by myself, for it is too much

00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:52.144
for me.
If You would deal thus with me,

00:45:52.144 --> 00:45:54.370
kill me rather,
I beg You, and let me see no

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:55.820
more of my wretchedness!"
 

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.801
Then the Lord said to Moses,
"Gather for Me seventy of

00:45:58.801 --> 00:46:01.951
Israel's elders of whom you have
experience as elders and

00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:04.940
officers of the people,
and bring them to the Tent of

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.679
Meeting and let them take their
place there with you.

00:46:07.679 --> 00:46:11.143
I will come down and speak with
you there, and I will draw upon

00:46:11.143 --> 00:46:13.880
the spirit that is on you and
put it upon them;

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.352
they shall share the burden of
the people with you,

00:46:16.352 --> 00:46:18.330
and you shall not bear it
alone.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.969
So again, hot and cold.
 

00:46:19.969 --> 00:46:23.068
And in many ways,
Moses sets the paradigm for the

00:46:23.068 --> 00:46:24.360
classical prophet.
 

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.309
He performs this double duty.
 

00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:29.467
He chastises and upbraids the
Israelites for their rebellion

00:46:29.467 --> 00:46:31.996
and failures.
When he's turning and facing

00:46:31.996 --> 00:46:33.969
the people, he's on their case.
 

00:46:33.969 --> 00:46:36.630
But at the same time,
he consoles the people when

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.289
they fear they've driven God
away irreparably,

00:46:39.289 --> 00:46:42.398
and when he turns to face God,
he defends the people before

00:46:42.398 --> 00:46:43.930
God.
He pleads for mercy when they

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.891
do in fact deserve
punishment--and he knows they

00:46:45.891 --> 00:46:46.809
deserve punishment.
 

00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:49.690
He even says as much,
but please have mercy.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.939
At times he expresses his
frustration with the difficulty

00:46:52.939 --> 00:46:56.480
of his task, and resentment that
it's been assigned to him.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.883
But we'll consider the
character and the role of Moses

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:03.672
in much greater detail when we
reach the book of Deuteronomy

00:47:03.672 --> 00:47:05.870
next Monday.
For the coming week,

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.856
I would like you to please pay
particular attention:

00:47:08.856 --> 00:47:11.550
we're dealing with two topics
that will be,

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:14.673
I think perhaps for some of
you, a little different,

00:47:14.673 --> 00:47:17.292
new, alien.
We're going to be dealing with

00:47:17.292 --> 00:47:19.904
biblical law on Monday,
and biblical ritual,

00:47:19.904 --> 00:47:21.666
purity text,
holiness, temple,

00:47:21.666 --> 00:47:24.126
on Wednesday.
These are worlds apart from

00:47:24.126 --> 00:47:26.859
many of the things we know,
so please, there's a lot of

00:47:26.859 --> 00:47:29.389
textual reading to do for Monday
and Wednesday.

00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:31.649
Please do it carefully,
and I might even hand out a

00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:34.000
little bit of a study guide to
help you with that.

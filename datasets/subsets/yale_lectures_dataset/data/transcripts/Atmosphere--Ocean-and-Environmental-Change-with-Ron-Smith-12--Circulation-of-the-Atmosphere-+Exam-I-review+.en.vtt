RONALD SMITH: You did
a lab this week, and it

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.767
was a little bit--

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.800
the weather discombobulated
us a little bit.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.933
There was fog hanging around.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.500
And some of you got
a good launch.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.733
Some of you didn't.

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:40.167
For those that didn't, depending
on what your TA

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:42.933
wants to do, there may be
another chance to do a launch

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.300
when you come to the
second meeting for

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.800
that lab next week.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
But remember, there are
two parts to that lab.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.600
You have to do the pilot balloon
launch, but you also

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.800
have to learn about how to
handle National Weather

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.133
Service balloon launches.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:02.967
So you have to be sure you get
both of those parts done in

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:06.400
the two periods when you
meet for this lab.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.067
So the exam, 10 questions.

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:16.667
You've got two more exams like
this coming in the course.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.300
They'll be a similar structure,
a mixture of short

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.233
problems to work out and
short written answers.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:27.167
They are a little bit long,
as you noticed.

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:30.833
I'll try not to make
them any longer.

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:33.300
But it is what it is.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.100
The average grade on this
I believe was 81.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.200
If you got anywhere in that
vicinity, plus or minus 10, I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.967
wouldn't worry about it.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.000
If you fell way below that, you
might want to talk to me

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.900
about how you're handling your
work in the course, whether

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.667
you're putting your emphasis
into the right areas of

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:55.400
study and so on.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.267
I'd be happy to talk to
anybody about that.

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:02.133
I'm going to go over each
question today, and if you

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:05.900
have any additional questions
while I go through these,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.933
please stop me, and we'll
spend some time on them.

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:15.767
Question one was about computing
the total mass of

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:17.233
Venus' atmosphere.

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:20.233
And we're going to use the same
principle we used to do

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:22.500
the Earth's atmosphere
in class.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.567
We use the hydrostatic relation
for the full column,

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:29.533
which says that the pressure at
the bottom of the column is

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:34.433
balancing the weight of
the air above it.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:37.300
So by looking at the ratio of
pressure to gravity, you can

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.533
get the mass per unit area in
a column of atmosphere.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:43.633
And then just multiply
that times the

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:45.700
surface area of the sphere.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.967
So the formula is this, but
you've got to be sure you use

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:51.633
Venus parameters everywhere--

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:54.467
Venus radius, Venus
surface pressure,

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.333
Venus surface gravity--

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.833
and then you get that number.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:00.800
Can someone check in their
notes, when we did this for

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.833
Earth, what did we find for the
total mass of the Earth's

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:05.333
atmosphere?

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:08.200
Could someone just remind
me of that?

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.233
I wanted to do that comparison,
but I don't have

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.467
my notes here.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.667
A similar calculation, but we
did it for Earth in class.

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:21.667
STUDENT: 5.4 times
10 to the 17th.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:27.833
PROFESSOR: 5.4 times 10
to the 17th.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.733
Yeah, so that's quite
a bit less, then.

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:36.967
And that's remarkable that
Venus, one of our nearest

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.500
neighbors, has an atmosphere
that is so much more

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.467
massive than ours.

00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:45.567
So it's not possible to assume
that all these planets have a

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:49.267
similar atmosphere when you see
that kind of a remarkable

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:53.367
difference between just
Venus and Earth.

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:56.800
Any questions on this?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.600
Question two was about
water vapor.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.467
It had two parts, first to
compute the partial pressure

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:05.367
of water vapor.

00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:08.667
And I gave you the density--

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:12.400
the mass density of water vapor,
and I gave you the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.967
temperature.

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:16.700
So you should have used the
perfect gas law for that.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.100
I've written it here.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.500
The partial pressure for water
is the density for water times

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.767
the gas constant for water
times the temperature.

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:28.567
And you're given 0.01 kilograms
per cubic meter for

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.267
the density, but now you've got
to be assured you use the

00:04:31.267 --> 00:04:32.833
right gas constant.

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:36.167
So the gas constant for water
is going to be the universal

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:40.200
gas constant, 8,314,
divided by the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.800
molecular weight for water.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.033
Water is H2O.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.433
The molecular weight of
oxygen is about 16.

00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:53.867
The molecular weight of each
hydrogen atom is 1, so that

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:55.467
adds up to 18.

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:56.567
That's why I have it there.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:00.967
So I've brought that value down
into here, 462 for the

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:01.700
gas constant.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.000
And then of course I had to
convert the temperature, which

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.600
was 20 Celsius, to Kelvin,
and that's what you get.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.900
And be sure to put units.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.567
Always have units on there.

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:13.800
That'll be Pascals if you're
following the normal

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.267
SI system of units.

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:18.600
The relative humidity is the
ratio of the partial pressure

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.500
of water vapor to the saturation
value at the

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.367
temperature that you have. And
there's a table here that

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:31.300
gives you a few values for
saturation vapor pressure for

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.100
water at given temperatures.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.967
And for 20 degrees, it's
23.4 millibars.

00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:40.567
Got to keep consistent units.

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:45.333
We're working in Pascals, so I
divided by 2,340, and I get

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:49.500
0.58, which is 58%.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:56.333
A couple of you put not P Sat
down here but P Total, the

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:58.633
total pressure, air
plus water vapor.

00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:03.233
Well, that's going to be much,
much larger than this value.

00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:06.833
The total pressure, for example,
in this room, P

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:11.100
Total, would be something like
1,013 millibars, two more

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.167
zeroes to get it in Pascals.

00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:17.733
And if I put that number into
there, I'm going to get a very

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:20.733
much smaller relative
humidity.

00:06:20.733 --> 00:06:22.633
But that'd be missing
the point.

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:28.900
Relative humidity is not the
ratio of water to air.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.100
It's the ratio of how much water
you have to how much

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.600
water vapor you can have, the
maximum that you can have at

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.300
the temperature that
you're given.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.567
Is that clear?

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.333
Question three, explain why
clouds form in rising air.

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:54.967
Well, the point is that clouds
form when air rises, because

00:06:54.967 --> 00:06:58.733
when air rises, it moves
to lower pressure.

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:01.200
Pressure decreases as you
go up in the atmosphere.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.200
When you put air into a lower
pressure, it'll expand.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.400
When air expands, it does work
on its environment, and its

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.367
temperature drops.

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:12.967
That's called adiabatic
cooling.

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:17.467
When you cool air, its
saturation vapor pressure

00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:20.767
drops-- that is, the amount that
can be held in the vapor

00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:22.733
state decreases--

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:26.867
and if that continues, then
eventually, the relative

00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:29.333
humidity will reach 100%
and then go beyond.

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:36.167
And the excess, then, must
condense out as liquid or ice,

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:38.700
some form of condensed water.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.967
So the idea for the answer to
that has to do with adiabatic

00:07:42.967 --> 00:07:49.000
cooling and the decrease in the
saturation vapor pressure

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.200
because of that cooling.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.500
Questions on that?

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.100
The greenhouse effect, why does
it warm rather than cool

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.233
the surface of the planet?

00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:02.533
The point is that the greenhouse
effect has to do

00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:08.867
with atmospheres absorbing some
fraction of the radiation

00:08:08.867 --> 00:08:12.000
that's trying to penetrate
through it.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.333
Now, that's a good starting
statement, but we've got to

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:16.333
get more specific than that.

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:21.333
It turns out that it's easier
for the Sun's rays to get in

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:25.367
than it is for the Earth
radiation to get out.

00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:30.400
If it were the opposite, then
I suppose the greenhouse

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.433
effect would be a cooling
mechanism, making it difficult

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:35.933
for the Sun's rays to get in.

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:38.800
But if it's easy for the Earth's
radiation to get out,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.600
that probably would cool.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.567
But it doesn't.

00:08:40.567 --> 00:08:46.433
So easy to get in, difficult
to get out, therefore, the

00:08:46.433 --> 00:08:49.767
Earth's temperature must warm
in order to reach that

00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:50.467
radiative balance.

00:08:50.467 --> 00:08:55.267
So what makes it easier to
get in than to get out?

00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:57.633
It's not the direction.

00:08:57.633 --> 00:08:59.667
It's the wavelength.

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:03.067
The wavelength of the radiation
coming from the Sun

00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:05.667
is centered around--

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:10.033
in the visible range, about
0.4 to 0.7 microns.

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:12.567
And because of the gases we have
in the atmosphere, the

00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:15.900
particular gases, the
atmosphere is mostly

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.533
transparent to those
wavelengths.

00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:22.900
On the other hand, the Earth's
surface being cooler, when it

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.100
radiates, it radiates at
a longer wavelength.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.200
And for those wavelengths, the
atmosphere is mostly opaque.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.167
So that's why the greenhouse
effect is there.

00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:42.100
And quite a few of you had a
garbled explanation of that.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.067
What gases contribute and why?

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:48.367
So it turns out that none of
the molecules we define as

00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:49.633
being air molecules--

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:51.500
that is, N2, O2, and argon--

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.700
none of them are active
greenhouse gases.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.467
Their structure is too simple.

00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:58.800
They don't have a dipole moment,
and they cannot absorb

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.633
or emit the infrared
radiation.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:06.200
But slightly more complex
molecules, like CO2, water

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:13.767
vapor, ozone, N2O, NO, they
have enough of a complex

00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:14.333
structure--

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:16.533
mostly asymmetry.

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:20.133
They break symmetry in a way
that allows them to have a

00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:23.433
positive-charged end and
a negative-charged end.

00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:26.733
And that means that they've got
a dipole, and they can--

00:10:26.733 --> 00:10:29.800
just like your cell phone, they
can emit and they can

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.800
absorb radiation using that
oscillating dipole.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.700
Questions on that?

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.467
Question five, a small
rocky asteroid.

00:10:45.967 --> 00:10:47.667
OK, I give you the
solar constant--

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:52.033
that's how much radiation
is reaching that--

00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:53.333
and I give you its albedo.

00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:56.000
So what are you going to do?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.433
Here's the thing here.

00:10:58.433 --> 00:11:01.667
So if you've got this little
asteroid, it's got a certain

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:03.267
value of the solar constant.

00:11:03.267 --> 00:11:06.900
It's going to be different for
Earth, because it's closer to

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.600
the Sun, so the solar constant's
going to be a

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.567
little bit larger.

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:13.033
Really, you've got
to make the same

00:11:13.033 --> 00:11:14.500
assumption we made in class.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.633
You're going to have to assume
that you've reached some kind

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:19.900
of a steady-state temperature,
where it's receiving an amount

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.800
of radiation per unit of time
and emitting at the

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.333
same rate to space.

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:27.733
And then you've got to find the
temperature of the object

00:11:27.733 --> 00:11:30.833
that allows it to be in that
steady-state balance.

00:11:30.833 --> 00:11:35.267
If the temperature's too cold,
it won't be radiating enough

00:11:35.267 --> 00:11:36.333
to be in steady-state.

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:40.200
If it's too hot, it'll be
radiating too much to be in

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:40.867
steady state.

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.033
So there's only one temperature
that'll allow it

00:11:43.033 --> 00:11:45.000
to balance its heat, and that's
the one that you can

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
derive from this formula.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.133
So solar constant, 1 minus the
albedo, over 4 times the

00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:51.233
Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

00:11:51.233 --> 00:11:55.967
So 2,000 watts per square meter,
1 minus the albedo, 4--

00:11:55.967 --> 00:11:57.733
there's the Stefan-Boltzmann
constant--

00:11:57.733 --> 00:12:02.633
take the fourth root, 257 K.

00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:03.900
Any questions on that?

00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:10.433
I think people did pretty
well on that one.

00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:14.767
Question six, explain why a
planet like Earth will have

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:18.600
lost its light gases over
geologic time but retained its

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.333
heavier gases.

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:24.667
So the point is the Earth is
in this middle category of

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:28.533
planets where it's large enough
to retain the heavier

00:12:28.533 --> 00:12:33.500
gases but not large enough to
retain the light gases.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.733
And the way one reasons that
out is to realize that the

00:12:36.733 --> 00:12:39.733
Earth has a certain
escape velocity--

00:12:39.733 --> 00:12:42.967
that's the velocity needed
for particles to escape--

00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:45.400
and that is independent of
the particle itself.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.500
That's just a fixed value.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.067
Then the light molecules
are moving rapidly.

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:56.867
The heavier molecules are
moving more slowly.

00:12:56.867 --> 00:13:00.333
And it turns out that enough
of the light molecules are

00:13:00.333 --> 00:13:04.100
exceeding the escape velocity,
so we will have lost that over

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.267
geologic time.

00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:09.667
But the heavier molecules are
moving slowly enough, so they

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:13.267
do not exceed the escape
velocity, and they can be

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:15.833
retained gravitationally
by the planet.

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:20.033
So most of you got that, while a
few of you buggered up those

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:21.367
descriptions a little bit.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.333
Question seven was just
a-- here it is--

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:29.600
it's just a cloud.

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:35.200
The earth is radiating, and the
cloud top is radiating.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.233
The temperature of the Earth I
gave you as plus 30, and this

00:13:41.233 --> 00:13:43.600
was minus 60.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.700
And I just asked you to compare
how these two surfaces

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.133
are radiating to space.

00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:52.467
The two things you had to do,
you had to compute the

00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:54.900
wavelength that was being
most strongly

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.167
emitted by each surface.

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:59.267
Each surface emits a broad
range of wavelengths, but

00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:03.000
there's a peak where it emits
more than at other

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.500
wavelengths.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.100
And that's given by Wien's
Law, which is here.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.800
So for the higher
temperature--

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.800
this is the constant divided by
the temperature in Kelvin--

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.333
it comes out to be
9.56 microns.

00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:19.700
And for the cooler temperature,
it's at about

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.967
13.6 microns.

00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:23.333
But both of those fall
into the thermal

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:26.833
infrared range of radiation.

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:30.200
And in terms of the flux, how
much radiation is being

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.000
emitted, it's the
Stefan-Boltzmann Law.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.667
Again, put in the temperatures
in Kelvin, and

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.833
you get 483 and 118.

00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:43.367
A big difference arises because
of that powerful power

00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:47.733
of four in the exponent there.

00:14:47.733 --> 00:14:50.367
Questions on that?

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:50.700
Yes.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.167
STUDENT: I just have a question

00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:53.133
about significant figures.

00:14:53.133 --> 00:14:56.933
So I know when you emailed us
that one time, you said to

00:14:56.933 --> 00:14:58.867
give us back one more
significant figure

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:00.867
than you gave us.

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:03.000
So I think I got some points off
for that, but if you only

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.800
gave us one significant figure,
would I give an answer

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.533
back with two?

00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:09.267
PROFESSOR: One or two
would be my

00:15:09.267 --> 00:15:10.433
recommendation.

00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:12.033
So here, I'm not sure
I've been completely

00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:14.200
consistent with that.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200
For example, when I gave you
the temperature on that

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.400
problem, I just gave it to
you as kind of a round

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.167
number, 30 and 60.

00:15:22.167 --> 00:15:24.833
So that's not many significant
figures.

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:28.600
On the other hand, the constants
are known to, in

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.900
fact, many more than this.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.600
I've truncated that a bit too.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.367
So you do have a bit
of a dilemma there.

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:38.467
Do you go with-- here, there's
four significant figures.

00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:40.467
Here, I gave it to
you in Celsius.

00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:42.467
There was only maybe
one or two.

00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:44.933
By the time I convert that to
Kelvin, it looks like maybe

00:15:44.933 --> 00:15:46.700
there's now three.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.000
So, yeah, this is tricky.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.067
And I hope we weren't unfair.

00:15:51.067 --> 00:15:55.333
But if you were going to give me
five or six decimal points

00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:57.333
there, I would have
taken off credit.

00:15:57.333 --> 00:16:00.967
Or if you'd truncated that off
to be, you know, 480 or

00:16:00.967 --> 00:16:02.867
something, I probably would have
taken off some credit.

00:16:02.867 --> 00:16:05.900
But if you're anywhere in this
ballpark, I hope we didn't.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.633
But show that to me if there's
a problem with that.

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:15.267
I think we can go on to
question eight, then.

00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:21.500
So this was one of those release
of a pollutant in an

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.500
unconfined atmosphere
with no wind.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.100
It says there's no
wind blowing.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.067
So I imagine a source that's
diffusing out in all three

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:33.200
directions--

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.367
north, south, and upwards--

00:16:35.367 --> 00:16:39.767
forming a growing hemisphere
of polluted air.

00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:42.100
And the radius of that
hemisphere is growing with

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.733
time according to the
square root of the

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:47.200
diffusivity times time.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.233
And so putting the numbers
in we had for that--

00:16:50.233 --> 00:16:52.033
be sure you work in seconds--

00:16:52.033 --> 00:16:53.733
I get 1,039 meters.

00:16:53.733 --> 00:16:56.133
And then the way I did the
problem was to compute the

00:16:56.133 --> 00:17:00.567
mass of air in that
hemisphere.

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:03.000
So that's the density of air
times the volume of the

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.500
hemisphere.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:12.700
And I got 2.8 times 10 to the 9
kilograms. Sorry, kilograms.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.000
And then this concentration
we're looking for is the mass

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.967
of the pollutant divided by the
mass of the air into which

00:17:19.967 --> 00:17:23.533
it has been mixed.

00:17:23.533 --> 00:17:27.767
And I said you put in 10 tons,
I think, so that's 10 to the

00:17:27.767 --> 00:17:31.133
fourth kilograms divided by
2.8 times 10 to the ninth

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:35.500
kilograms, just this number
brought down, and I got 3.57

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.333
times 10 to the minus six.

00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:40.767
In mass units, kilograms
per kilogram.

00:17:40.767 --> 00:17:46.600
So noticing the minus six, I
could write that as 3.57 parts

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.433
per million--

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.100
there's the million--

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.433
by mass.

00:17:50.433 --> 00:17:53.600
By mass because it's kilograms
per kilogram.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.133
So that's what I got for that.

00:17:57.733 --> 00:17:59.800
Questions there?

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.400
People did well on nine.

00:18:04.133 --> 00:18:04.233
I just gave the--

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:08.433
I reminded you of the lapse rate
for Earth, and I gave you

00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:10.567
the height of 30 kilometers.

00:18:10.567 --> 00:18:13.033
You had to put it into this
approximate formula for an

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:18.433
isothermal atmosphere, and you
got that for a mass density at

00:18:18.433 --> 00:18:22.100
that elevation in units of
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:18:24.633 --> 00:18:25.333
All right, the last one, then.

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:30.133
Supercooled water is liquid
water at a temperature below

00:18:30.133 --> 00:18:33.300
the normal freezing point of
water-- that is, below zero

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.867
degrees Celsius.

00:18:35.867 --> 00:18:39.167
It typically has the property
that it wants to freeze, and

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:43.400
if something comes along that
will give it that chance,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.600
it'll freeze instantaneously.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.533
But until you do that,
it will stay for a

00:18:48.533 --> 00:18:52.033
while as liquid water.

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:54.000
Unstable lapse rate.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.833
An unstable lapse rate is an
atmospheric lapse rate--

00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:01.133
which, as you know, is the
rate at which temperature

00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:06.367
changes with height, that's a
definition of a lapse rate--

00:19:06.367 --> 00:19:11.733
that is more negative than
the adiabatic value.

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:13.233
The dry adiabatic
value is minus

00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:14.833
9.8 degrees per kilometer.

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:17.667
So if it's more negative than
that, that would mean, for

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:24.033
example, minus 10, minus 11,
minus 12 degrees Celsius per

00:19:24.033 --> 00:19:26.467
kilometer would be an
unstable lapse rate.

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:30.333
If it's less negative or
positive, like minus five

00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:33.800
degrees per kilometer, minus
two, minus one, zero, plus

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.733
two, plus five, those would
all be stable lapse rates.

00:19:37.733 --> 00:19:40.500
And the characteristic of that
is that when a parcel rises,

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:48.233
then, it cools less rapidly than
the environment in which

00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:50.200
it's penetrating.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.700
And therefore, it ends up
warmer than its new

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.567
environment.

00:19:55.567 --> 00:19:58.633
And that'll allow it to continue
to rise, and it'll

00:19:58.633 --> 00:20:03.000
lead to convection if
you try to set up an

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.633
unstable lapse rate.

00:20:04.633 --> 00:20:08.033
Archimedes' Law, few
of you got this.

00:20:08.033 --> 00:20:15.067
I guess it's because it's not
in the book, and I only

00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:16.633
mentioned it once in class.

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:19.567
But still I was a little bit
surprised, because I think

00:20:19.567 --> 00:20:20.500
it's well known.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.200
But the Archimedes' Law I'm
referring to here is that the

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:31.767
buoyancy force that acts on an
object immersed in a fluid is

00:20:31.767 --> 00:20:36.533
equal to the weight of
the fluid displaced.

00:20:36.533 --> 00:20:39.433
So if I take a basketball and I
push it down into a swimming

00:20:39.433 --> 00:20:45.400
pool, I will feel a force trying
to push it back up

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.967
that's equal to the weight of
the water that would be there

00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:53.867
if the ball were not.

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:56.733
Now, that turns out to be pretty
simple to understand,

00:20:56.733 --> 00:21:01.300
because the pressure increases
as you go down in that pool,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.900
and therefore, the bottom of
the basketball feels higher

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.133
pressure than the top.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.667
And that's what's causing
the buoyancy force.

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:14.167
And the rate at which that
pressure increases as you go

00:21:14.167 --> 00:21:18.867
down is related to the density
of the surrounding fluid.

00:21:18.867 --> 00:21:21.300
That's why the surrounding fluid
comes in, because the

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.033
surrounding fluid determines
the rate at which pressure

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.233
increases with depth.

00:21:25.233 --> 00:21:28.300
And it's that increase that
gives you the buoyancy force

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.800
pushing up on the ball.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:36.033
So that's Archimedes' Law.

00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:38.267
The tropopause is the boundary
between the troposphere and

00:21:38.267 --> 00:21:39.567
the stratosphere.

00:21:39.567 --> 00:21:42.133
The troposphere is that first
layer where the temperature

00:21:42.133 --> 00:21:43.867
normally decreases
with height.

00:21:43.867 --> 00:21:47.333
The stratosphere is the next one
up where the temperature

00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:48.600
increases with height.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:54.500
Advection fog is fog caused by
moving warm air-- warm, moist

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.733
air over a cold surface.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:59.400
Advection means horizontal
movement.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.133
So that's a clue.

00:22:02.133 --> 00:22:05.500
And if you take warm, moist air
and move it over a cold

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.233
surface, it's going to lose
heat to that surface.

00:22:10.233 --> 00:22:12.500
As it cools down, the saturation
vapor pressure's

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.567
going to drop.

00:22:13.567 --> 00:22:18.233
And the familiar story, you're
going to form some condensed

00:22:18.233 --> 00:22:21.633
water droplets in that way,
and that's the fog.

00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:22.900
Questions on any of that?

00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:29.867
Sorry to take so long on that,
but I want to just be clear

00:22:29.867 --> 00:22:33.400
that you should spend some
time going over those.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.267
If you want to do better on the
next one, part of the key

00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:40.267
is to really go over the last
one and understand everything

00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:41.933
that you did and how you
could have done better.

00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:07.400
Let's see here.

00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:16.300
It'll be just a minute for
that light to come on.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.600
I want to start a new subject
today, which is the general

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.100
circulation of the atmosphere.

00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:35.433
There it is.

00:23:35.433 --> 00:23:39.467
So we just finished a big
section on water in the

00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:43.333
atmosphere, so this is
a new topic now.

00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:45.967
We're going to look at the
whole globe and try to

00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:50.267
understand the large-scale
air motions on the globe.

00:23:50.267 --> 00:23:52.967
I always have a debate
with myself at this

00:23:52.967 --> 00:23:54.367
point of the course.

00:23:54.367 --> 00:23:58.067
I wonder whether I should start
with the smaller-scale

00:23:58.067 --> 00:24:01.633
air motions like storms and then
talk about the general

00:24:01.633 --> 00:24:04.000
circulation, or whether I
should do the general

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.733
circulation first. And I never
know quite the answer.

00:24:07.733 --> 00:24:09.700
This year, we're going to start
with general circulation

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.567
first, then do storms. But then
as we get into seasons,

00:24:13.567 --> 00:24:17.000
we'll have to come back to
review this subject of the

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.833
general circulation
of the atmosphere.

00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:22.700
So the basic principles that
are going to control how we

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.900
think about this problem is
that differential heating

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.300
generates the circulation.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.033
Now, you know this.

00:24:29.033 --> 00:24:35.100
If I have a bonfire over here
or a hot stove or something,

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.500
it's going to heat
the air near it.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.500
That warm air wants to rise
because of its buoyancy, and

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.067
you're going to set up a
circulation in this room

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:48.267
driven by the fact that
you're heating the air

00:24:48.267 --> 00:24:49.933
here but not there.

00:24:49.933 --> 00:24:52.233
Differential heating means
you're applying different

00:24:52.233 --> 00:24:55.133
heating at different
locations.

00:24:55.133 --> 00:24:58.033
But that circulation, then,
is going to move heat--

00:24:58.033 --> 00:25:01.667
because the air carries heat
with it, it's going to move

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:06.833
heat from hot to cold regions
trying to balance out the

00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:08.200
local heat budgets.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.300
So we're going to see this
principle applied now to the

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.367
atmosphere as a whole.

00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:21.267
And you can imagine starting
with just this simple idea.

00:25:21.267 --> 00:25:28.600
Here's the globe, and the Sun
hits the equatorial regions

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.567
most directly.

00:25:29.567 --> 00:25:32.700
In the equatorial regions in the
middle of the day, the Sun

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.900
is directly overhead.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.600
So this cosine theta factor
is about one.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.567
You're getting the full
intensity of the Sun, 1,380

00:25:41.567 --> 00:25:46.100
watts per square meter, directly
hitting regions near

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.033
the Equator.

00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:51.400
And it turns out that there's
less thermal radiation being

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:58.300
emitted in the equatorial
regions than is being received

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:58.933
from the Sun.

00:25:58.933 --> 00:26:03.167
So while we assumed a week or
so ago that the Earth as a

00:26:03.167 --> 00:26:09.300
whole is in radiative balance,
that is not true for each

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.167
latitude belt.

00:26:11.167 --> 00:26:15.933
Each latitude belt is out of a
state of radiative balance.

00:26:15.933 --> 00:26:19.433
As I've shown here near the
Equator, getting more from the

00:26:19.433 --> 00:26:24.967
Sun than it's emitting to space,
and at the poles, where

00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:30.600
the radiation is coming in
tangentially, you're really

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.867
getting very little sunlight.

00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:34.533
Of course, with the tilt of the
Earth, you do get a little

00:26:34.533 --> 00:26:37.767
bit, but let's assume that ray
is just parallel here.

00:26:37.767 --> 00:26:40.833
It's just going to hit the
North Pole tangentially.

00:26:40.833 --> 00:26:43.800
It's not going to deliver any
solar energy that way.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.967
But the temperature of the pole
is not absolute zero, so

00:26:48.967 --> 00:26:50.300
it will be radiating to space.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.467
So there's an imbalance here.

00:26:51.467 --> 00:26:54.233
There's an excess of heat
here and a heat

00:26:54.233 --> 00:26:56.933
deficit near the poles.

00:26:56.933 --> 00:26:59.133
How can that be sustained?

00:26:59.133 --> 00:27:02.700
Well, the way that is sustained
is to have some

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.900
other mechanism for transporting
the heat from the

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.733
Equator to the pole.

00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:10.600
And that's where the general
circulation comes in.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.900
So not only is the difference in
heating going to produce a

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.100
circulation by buoyancy forces,
but that circulation

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.600
then is going to solve this
problem we have of how to

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.400
balance out the heat budget
at each latitude.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.933
So there's two ways to
look at this problem.

00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:32.167
Differential heating causes
the circulation, and the

00:27:32.167 --> 00:27:36.133
circulation helps us to balance
the heat budget at

00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:37.800
each latitude.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.500
I'm going to go through this
now in some detail, because

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.233
this is the key concept for
understanding the Earth's

00:27:44.233 --> 00:27:45.100
general circulation.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:49.200
So on the x-axis is latitude
from the North Pole down to

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.867
the Equator to the South Pole.

00:27:50.867 --> 00:27:54.167
And there are two curves here.

00:27:54.167 --> 00:27:58.100
The red curve is radiation
received from the Sun.

00:28:01.533 --> 00:28:06.967
That could be over a day or
over a year, averaged out.

00:28:06.967 --> 00:28:09.567
But anyway, there's a lot of
radiation being received from

00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:12.433
the Sun in the equatorial
region and much,

00:28:12.433 --> 00:28:16.200
much less at the poles.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.633
I brought the globe over here
just to remind you of this.

00:28:22.533 --> 00:28:27.567
If I forget the tilt for the
moment and the Sun's radiation

00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:31.100
is coming in like this and the
Earth is spinning-- let me get

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.500
it spinning in the right
direction, it

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500
spins towards the east--

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.433
you're going to get a lot of
heat distributed around the

00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:37.500
globe near the Equator.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.433
But the Sun's rays
are just coming

00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:41.500
tangentially near the poles.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:46.900
So on a per unit area basis, you
get very little radiation

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.700
near the poles.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.267
Now, that's probably
an annual average.

00:28:49.267 --> 00:28:54.367
And during Northern Hemisphere
summertime with this tilt, OK,

00:28:54.367 --> 00:28:55.633
there is a little
bit of radiation

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.633
received at the pole.

00:28:57.633 --> 00:28:59.100
In the Northern Hemisphere
winter,

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.567
there's absolutely none.

00:29:01.567 --> 00:29:04.100
So you don't get a zero value.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.367
You get something that's an
average of the seasons.

00:29:08.367 --> 00:29:12.000
But it's definitely much less
than what is received at the

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.233
Equator, just because of the
geometry of the sphere.

00:29:14.233 --> 00:29:17.067
It's nothing more than just the
geometry of the sphere and

00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:19.133
the fact that the Sun's
rays are coming in

00:29:19.133 --> 00:29:22.000
parallel to each other.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.133
Now, the equatorial regions
are warmer than the other

00:29:27.133 --> 00:29:30.200
parts of the planet, so they
radiate more by the

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.000
Stefan-Boltzmann Law.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.300
I have it right here.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.633
The hotter the surface, the
more it radiates, but not

00:29:36.633 --> 00:29:39.967
enough to make up
that difference.

00:29:39.967 --> 00:29:44.267
So there is a heat surplus
near the Equator.

00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:53.033
Near the poles, it radiates less
than at the equator, but

00:29:53.033 --> 00:29:57.467
not so much less that it doesn't
leave a deficit there.

00:29:57.467 --> 00:30:00.967
So we've got this problem of how
to balance the budget in

00:30:00.967 --> 00:30:03.400
the Equator and in the
high-latitude regions.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.367
And that is done, as I've said
before now, by a heat transfer

00:30:07.367 --> 00:30:12.567
mechanism that has to do with
the ocean and the atmosphere

00:30:12.567 --> 00:30:17.433
transporting heat to the
poles to balance

00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:21.300
out that heat budget.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.767
So here's what we estimate from
what we know about the

00:30:24.767 --> 00:30:27.800
atmosphere using balloon
soundings and so on

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.133
to work this out.

00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:33.533
What's plotted here on the
x-axis is the heat

00:30:33.533 --> 00:30:37.100
transport in watts--

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.000
it's a power unit--

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.600
as a function of latitude.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.867
North Pole, Equator,
South Pole.

00:30:44.867 --> 00:30:49.400
And the total is shown in the
black curve, the atmospheric

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.867
component in red, and
the ocean in blue.

00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:54.700
Now, something about
the units.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.700
It says capital P, capital
P capital W up there.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:03.500
The capital of the P means
"peta." You know the prefixes

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:09.733
"kilo" and "mega" and "giga"
and "tera." Well, you keep

00:31:09.733 --> 00:31:13.900
going up till you get to peta,
which is 10 to the 15th.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:18.767
So a petawatt is 10
to the 15th watts.

00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:22.867
So for example, at a
latitude of about

00:31:22.867 --> 00:31:25.600
30 or 40 north latitude--

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.167
and New Haven is right here at
40 north, just about in the

00:31:31.167 --> 00:31:33.400
peak of this curve--

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.133
there is about six petawatts
of energy being transported

00:31:38.133 --> 00:31:45.933
towards the North Pole by ocean
and air currents in the

00:31:45.933 --> 00:31:46.467
atmosphere.

00:31:46.467 --> 00:31:47.400
Most of it's by air currents.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.533
Now, do we know this?

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:52.167
When we walk outside today,
do we know this?

00:31:52.167 --> 00:31:55.233
Well, I would argue that, yes,
you probably do know this.

00:31:55.233 --> 00:31:59.800
Because from your experience
now, you know that on days

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.700
when it's especially warm,
the air is blowing

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.067
from the south, typically.

00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:08.867
On days when it's especially
cold, the air is

00:32:08.867 --> 00:32:10.033
blowing from the north.

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:14.200
So there's this transport
of air back and forth.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.367
You have roughly the same amount
of air moving north and

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:19.267
south, but when it's moving
northward, it is--

00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:21.067
you can put that down on
the floor, if you like.

00:32:21.067 --> 00:32:23.700
Sorry it's in your way.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.300
When it's blowing northward,
it's carrying more heat,

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.300
because it's hotter.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.467
And when it's flying southward,
it's carrying less

00:32:32.467 --> 00:32:33.633
heat, because it's colder.

00:32:33.633 --> 00:32:36.433
So just from that asymmetry
that you would notice on a

00:32:36.433 --> 00:32:40.700
day-by-day basis, you can
understand what's causing this

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.600
north-south heat transport.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.433
It's just air moving back and
forth, but carrying more heat

00:32:46.433 --> 00:32:50.033
on its way north than it
does on its way south.

00:32:52.733 --> 00:32:56.900
I'm going to illustrate that
first for the ocean.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:03.233
This is a crude diagram of the
gyres in each of the world's

00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:04.800
ocean basins.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.167
For example, in the North
Atlantic gyre, there is a warm

00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:10.400
current going northward.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.700
That's the Gulf Stream, shown in
red to indicate that it's a

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.267
warm current.

00:33:17.267 --> 00:33:20.200
There's a cold current
running southwards.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:20.700
So look.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.833
You're taking the same amount
of water north and south.

00:33:23.833 --> 00:33:27.067
You're not piling up water at
the pole or at the Equator,

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:30.533
but you are transporting
a net amount of heat--

00:33:30.533 --> 00:33:33.467
not a net amount of water, but
yes, a net amount of heat.

00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:36.633
Because the water going
northwards is warm.

00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:39.233
The water moving southwards
is cold.

00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.900
So they don't balance each other
out in terms of the heat

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.633
that they're carrying.

00:33:43.633 --> 00:33:47.000
And the same thing goes on in
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.933
For example, there are warm
currents and cold currents, so

00:33:50.933 --> 00:33:54.600
the net heat transport
is towards the south.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.500
That's why they plotted this
negative on the last plot.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:03.067
So if we call this plot the
northward heat transport, it's

00:34:03.067 --> 00:34:05.800
positive in the Northern
Hemisphere, because you're

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.967
transporting heat towards
the North Pole.

00:34:07.967 --> 00:34:10.400
It's negative in the Southern
Hemisphere, because you're

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.900
transporting heat towards the
South Pole, going in the

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:19.333
opposite direction, so we give
it a negative sign like that.

00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:21.900
So the oceans are doing some of
it, but the atmosphere does

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.433
most of it.

00:34:24.433 --> 00:34:26.667
Typically, if you have warm air
and cold air and the jet

00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:30.400
stream is running around the
Earth kind of in a zonally

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.700
symmetric fashion, well
then, you're not

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.700
transporting any heat.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.167
But very frequently, it'll break
down into a wave-like

00:34:37.167 --> 00:34:41.533
motion, where cold air will come
streaming down-- in fact,

00:34:41.533 --> 00:34:44.100
here's New Haven right
about here--

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.633
cold air will come streaming
down from the pole, heading to

00:34:46.633 --> 00:34:48.067
the Equator.

00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:51.367
That has to be replaced by an
equal amount of warm air

00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:53.267
moving poleward.

00:34:53.267 --> 00:34:58.367
And in so doing, you'll have a
net amount of heat transported

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:02.200
towards the pole, and that's
what'll balance out the heat

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:08.200
budget at each latitude.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.967
Just to remind you about this
basic physical principle, if

00:35:10.967 --> 00:35:16.433
you imagine a pipe carrying
a fluid, what do you

00:35:16.433 --> 00:35:17.267
know about the pipe?

00:35:17.267 --> 00:35:19.300
You probably know the
cross-sectional area of the

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:24.100
pipe, you know the speed of the
fluid in the pipe, and you

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.267
probably know the density of
the fluid in the pipe.

00:35:27.267 --> 00:35:30.233
Then if you wanted to
know the mass flux--

00:35:30.233 --> 00:35:32.533
how much water or how
much air is being

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:34.800
carried by that pipe--

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.200
it's simply the product rho UA,
and that'll have units of

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.833
kilograms per second.

00:35:42.833 --> 00:35:46.800
That'll be a mass flow rate.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.567
Well, its only a small step--

00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:51.233
once you understand that, it's
only a small step to go beyond

00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:53.400
that to understand how
much heat is being

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.467
transported in the pipe.

00:35:54.467 --> 00:36:00.833
Because we know the heat
capacity or the heat stored in

00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:05.300
a fluid is proportional to the
mass that you have times the

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.500
specific heat capacity times
the temperature.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.867
So this quantity C sub p--

00:36:11.867 --> 00:36:14.000
I've given the value
here for air--

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.200
it's called the specific heat
capacity at constant pressure.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:18.967
You can look it up.

00:36:18.967 --> 00:36:20.067
You can Google it.

00:36:20.067 --> 00:36:21.500
It has this value for air.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.833
The units here are joules per
kilogram per degree Kelvin.

00:36:26.833 --> 00:36:29.533
So the more mass you have,
the more heat is stored.

00:36:29.533 --> 00:36:31.633
And the hotter the temperature,
the more mass is

00:36:31.633 --> 00:36:32.100
[correction: energy]

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:36.000
stored in a particular
kilogram of air.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.900
So to go from the mass flux to
the heat flux, you just have

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.100
to multiply by these additional
two factors, the

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.867
heat capacity, which is the
amount of heat you have per

00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:50.367
degree of temperature, and then
the temperature itself.

00:36:50.367 --> 00:36:52.167
STUDENT: And so what are
the units on heat flux?

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:55.133
PROFESSOR: The units on heat
flux would be

00:36:55.133 --> 00:36:58.600
joules per second.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.000
Or you may know that
that is a watt.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
A joule per second is a watt.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.367
So the point is that when air
moves, heat moves too, because

00:37:12.367 --> 00:37:15.800
heat is stored in air.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.833
Now, this doesn't quite
convey the full

00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:20.167
picture I want to convey.

00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:23.667
If I went back to this picture,
what I'd like you to

00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:27.733
envision is two of
these pipes.

00:37:27.733 --> 00:37:32.600
One's carrying air southward,
and the other is carrying an

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.633
equal amount of air
mass northwards.

00:37:36.633 --> 00:37:39.733
The amount of mass flow in each
pipe is the same, but the

00:37:39.733 --> 00:37:42.567
amount of heat flow is not,
because the temperature is

00:37:42.567 --> 00:37:45.400
different for the two pipes.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:50.667
So no net transport of
mass, but yes, a net

00:37:50.667 --> 00:37:53.133
transport of heat.

00:37:53.133 --> 00:37:57.633
Because one stream of air is
cold, and the other stream of

00:37:57.633 --> 00:37:58.700
air is hot.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.300
So I don't think this is a
particularly difficult

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.467
concept, but it lies at the base
of understanding how the

00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:07.133
atmospheric general
circulation works.

00:38:07.133 --> 00:38:08.833
Are there questions on this?

00:38:08.833 --> 00:38:10.600
I'd love to take a minute
or two on questions.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:10.933
Yes.

00:38:10.933 --> 00:38:14.567
STUDENT: Why does that happen?

00:38:14.567 --> 00:38:17.500
Why does it not stay constant?

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.567
PROFESSOR: I'll get to the
question of why

00:38:19.567 --> 00:38:21.800
that happens in about a week.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.867
This happens because of an
instability that occurs along

00:38:25.867 --> 00:38:29.267
the jet stream that generates
what's called a mid-latitude

00:38:29.267 --> 00:38:30.800
frontal cyclone.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.200
It's the main weather producer
around the mid latitudes.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.533
And over the next six months,
your life will be largely

00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:40.300
controlled by these events.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.933
Storms that come through
New Haven are

00:38:41.933 --> 00:38:43.700
mid-latitude frontal cyclones.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.400
They are basically breakouts.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.933
The prison boundary has been
breached, and the cold air is

00:38:48.933 --> 00:38:51.767
breaking out and going south,
and the warm air is heading

00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:56.167
northwards when the jet stream
develops a little instability

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:58.933
in it and breaks down
in that way.

00:38:58.933 --> 00:39:01.633
So your book is good at
talking about these

00:39:01.633 --> 00:39:04.567
mid-latitude frontal cyclones,
and we'll be talking about it

00:39:04.567 --> 00:39:06.100
in this course as well.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.933
It's a spontaneous event.

00:39:07.933 --> 00:39:10.567
It happens throughout the
winter, just day after day

00:39:10.567 --> 00:39:16.167
after day, just one after the
other of these kind of

00:39:16.167 --> 00:39:19.100
breakout events.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:24.367
Now, the subject gets a little
more complicated, though,

00:39:24.367 --> 00:39:27.633
because of the effect of
the Earth's rotation.

00:39:27.633 --> 00:39:31.167
Remember, I'm talking
about the Earth

00:39:31.167 --> 00:39:34.033
spinning on its axis.

00:39:34.033 --> 00:39:36.667
And what does that do?

00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:40.000
Well, there's one obvious thing
it does and one perhaps

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.333
that's not so obvious.

00:39:41.333 --> 00:39:43.300
The obvious one is that
it distributes

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.800
the Sun's heat zonally.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:50.100
So if I just had this globe
sitting fixed without spinning

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.667
and the Sun was over there, it's
hitting this side of the

00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:56.533
Earth, but never this side.

00:39:56.533 --> 00:39:59.467
And so we'd have a hot spot
forming here, and this would

00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:03.433
be icy cold on the other side.

00:40:03.433 --> 00:40:07.967
Instead, because the Earth is
spinning on its axis, it's not

00:40:07.967 --> 00:40:12.000
a hot spot that forms, but a
hot region near the Equator

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.533
that forms. The spinning
of it distributes

00:40:14.533 --> 00:40:16.067
the Sun's heat zonally.

00:40:16.067 --> 00:40:18.233
We use the word "zonally"
when we're going this

00:40:18.233 --> 00:40:19.433
way around the Earth.

00:40:19.433 --> 00:40:21.967
And you end up with
a latitudinal--

00:40:21.967 --> 00:40:24.200
or sometimes we say
"meridional"--

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.400
temperature gradient,
or heating gradient.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.867
But zonally, the heat gets well
distributed because of

00:40:30.867 --> 00:40:32.533
the spinning of the Earth.

00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:33.867
So that's the first point.

00:40:33.867 --> 00:40:36.500
The other one that we'll
get to next week is

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.400
the Coriolis force.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.667
Whenever a planet spins,
it generates a somewhat

00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:46.967
mysterious new force called
the Coriolis force.

00:40:46.967 --> 00:40:50.200
Whenever a parcel tries to move
in a straight line on a

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.233
spinning planet, it
gets deflected.

00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:55.033
And we're going to talk
about that next time.

00:40:55.033 --> 00:40:58.767
And that really has a major
influence on the nature of the

00:40:58.767 --> 00:41:00.933
general circulation,
as we will see.

00:41:00.933 --> 00:41:03.433
And I'll give you a hint of
that here, and we'll do it

00:41:03.433 --> 00:41:05.133
more quantitatively next week.

00:41:05.133 --> 00:41:09.567
So for example, let's look at
the case when the planet is

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.800
not rotating.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:18.000
So the point that's right under
the Sun, if the Sun's

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.033
down there, would heat up.

00:41:21.033 --> 00:41:24.267
And every other place, you'd
get less and less sunlight.

00:41:24.267 --> 00:41:27.067
Whether you moved this way or
that way, you'd get less and

00:41:27.067 --> 00:41:30.500
less sunlight, and you'd get no
sunlight on the backside.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:35.933
So you'd have a subsolar hot
spot, just one very hot area

00:41:35.933 --> 00:41:37.833
right here.

00:41:37.833 --> 00:41:40.667
The low-level air would
move in towards it.

00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:43.767
Those are the red arrows.

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:47.233
And then, because the air gets
heated, it would rise, and

00:41:47.233 --> 00:41:50.200
then aloft, it would spread
out in all directions.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.067
And those are the thin
blue arrows.

00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:54.733
So that's just like I built
a bonfire here.

00:41:54.733 --> 00:41:56.867
You'd have air moving
in towards it from

00:41:56.867 --> 00:41:59.067
all directions rising.

00:41:59.067 --> 00:42:01.967
And then when it hit the
ceiling, it would go out in

00:42:01.967 --> 00:42:03.933
all directions.

00:42:03.933 --> 00:42:08.100
Now, this is not at all
what we have on Earth.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.800
This is the idealization or kind
of a thought experiment

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.800
of what the circulation would
be if the Earth was not

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.533
rotating on its axis.

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:19.567
So don't take this
as what happens.

00:42:19.567 --> 00:42:23.567
Take it as a building block to
understand what actually

00:42:23.567 --> 00:42:27.167
happens in the Earth's
atmosphere.

00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:32.333
So let me bring in now the
effect of distributing the

00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:32.900
heat zonally.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.600
So this would happen if
I had weak rotation.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.000
I learned a few weeks ago in
a lecture I went to on the

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.500
planet Titan that actually the
planet Titan fits into this

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.500
kind of a description.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:50.400
It rotates rapidly enough to
distribute the heat zonally

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.467
but not so rapidly
that the Coriolis

00:42:52.467 --> 00:42:54.700
force is a major player.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.900
So here's what happens.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:01.233
You get a hot equator, a fairly
uniform hot equator.

00:43:01.233 --> 00:43:06.933
Air moves towards it at low
levels, gets heated, rises,

00:43:06.933 --> 00:43:13.000
and then moves away from it,
poleward, at high elevations.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.433
It would sink somewhere out here
and fall to the surface,

00:43:17.433 --> 00:43:20.667
and then move towards the hot
line again, and then rise.

00:43:20.667 --> 00:43:24.100
You'd have a kind of planetary,
simple bonfire kind

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:30.167
of circulation towards and away
from this heated line

00:43:30.167 --> 00:43:32.033
caused by the solar heat.

00:43:32.033 --> 00:43:32.433
Yeah.

00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:34.533
STUDENT: Would the surface at
the equator be really hot and

00:43:34.533 --> 00:43:35.667
the surface at the poles
be really cold?

00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:36.933
PROFESSOR: It'd be cold.

00:43:36.933 --> 00:43:37.467
That's right.

00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:41.100
And the circulation would be a
rather simple one, rising near

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.767
the equator, sinking near the
poles, and then the air moves

00:43:44.767 --> 00:43:46.533
right back to the equator.

00:43:46.533 --> 00:43:48.000
But now, that's for
weak rotation.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.267
For the Earth, we rotate
somewhat faster than that.

00:43:51.267 --> 00:43:54.200
You know it takes 24 hours
for us to have a day.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.833
That's a pretty fast rotation.

00:43:57.833 --> 00:44:01.033
By the way, this is sometimes
called the single-cell

00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:02.500
circulation.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.033
Well, I guess there's two of
them, but on one side of the

00:44:05.033 --> 00:44:07.600
equator, there's just
one, rising,

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.200
sinking, rising, sinking.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.133
So the single cell refers to
what happens on either the

00:44:13.133 --> 00:44:16.300
northern or the southern
hemisphere.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.500
On Earth, you get something
that's closer to a three-cell

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:24.267
circulation, because the
rotation rate is larger.

00:44:24.267 --> 00:44:28.167
So the Coriolis force is
playing a larger role.

00:44:28.167 --> 00:44:33.367
You do get rising motion near
the Equator, but it only goes

00:44:33.367 --> 00:44:37.367
slightly north and south
and then sinks.

00:44:37.367 --> 00:44:41.200
And north of that, you get
westerlies and then easterlies

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.567
again, laid out like
I have very crudely

00:44:45.567 --> 00:44:47.567
on this line diagram.

00:44:47.567 --> 00:44:49.533
I'm going to show you a better
version of this in just a

00:44:49.533 --> 00:44:52.200
moment, but the main point
is to show how much more

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.133
complicated this is than that.

00:44:55.133 --> 00:44:58.367
And that all has to do with
the stronger action of the

00:44:58.367 --> 00:44:59.600
Coriolis force.

00:45:06.767 --> 00:45:10.867
So this is a more typical
artist conception of the

00:45:10.867 --> 00:45:16.567
three-circulation system.

00:45:16.567 --> 00:45:18.200
It's a little bit more
complicated, of course.

00:45:21.333 --> 00:45:26.600
The rising motion along the
Equator then gives you

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:31.200
poleward-moving air aloft that
descends at about 30 degrees

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.933
north and south latitude.

00:45:33.933 --> 00:45:36.833
This is a very strong
overturning cell.

00:45:36.833 --> 00:45:39.367
It's called the Hadley cell.

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:40.733
And you must know
about this one.

00:45:40.733 --> 00:45:43.767
This is really one of the
dominant features of the

00:45:43.767 --> 00:45:47.200
climatology on Planet Earth
is the Hadley cell.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.933
Rising motion near the Equator,
air moving poleward

00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:54.433
till it gets to about 30 degrees
and then sinks, and

00:45:54.433 --> 00:45:57.100
then returns towards
the Equator at the

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.967
surface of the Earth.

00:45:58.967 --> 00:46:03.567
Because of the deflecting force
from the Coriolis force,

00:46:03.567 --> 00:46:07.300
that air doesn't move directly
towards the Equator.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.267
It comes in from the
easterly direction.

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:14.967
So it forms what we call the
northeast trades, wind blowing

00:46:14.967 --> 00:46:17.767
from the northeast in the
Northern Hemisphere, and the

00:46:17.767 --> 00:46:21.600
southeast trade winds in the
Southern Hemisphere.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:29.267
North and south of that, there
is the Ferrel cell, which is a

00:46:29.267 --> 00:46:34.233
rather weak overturning in
the opposite direction.

00:46:34.233 --> 00:46:36.200
But that's not the
primary feature.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.933
I don't like this diagram,
because they show the Ferrel

00:46:38.933 --> 00:46:43.633
cell so clearly, but they don't
show the most obvious

00:46:43.633 --> 00:46:46.400
and dramatic feature of the
westerlies, and that's the

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.500
existence of these mid-latitude
frontal cyclones

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.433
that I was talking about
just a moment ago.

00:46:51.433 --> 00:46:54.333
And when I show you a movie, you
won't see the Ferrel cell,

00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:57.067
but you'll see those
mid-latitude frontal cyclones

00:46:57.067 --> 00:46:57.967
in that region.

00:46:57.967 --> 00:47:03.300
And then in the polar regions,
you get also a fairly weak

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:08.600
cell giving you some
easterly flow at

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.633
the very high latitudes.

00:47:11.633 --> 00:47:17.333
So this is the three-cell
pattern of general circulation

00:47:17.333 --> 00:47:19.233
for Planet Earth.

00:47:19.233 --> 00:47:27.167
And I want to show you a set of
satellite loops to try to

00:47:27.167 --> 00:47:28.867
illustrate a few of
these features.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.500
This is a global view pieced
together from a number of

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.533
geostationary satellites posted
at various longitudes

00:47:40.533 --> 00:47:41.700
around the globe.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:46.433
And it's looking at the emitted
long-wave radiation.

00:47:46.433 --> 00:47:48.300
So we won't see day
and night here.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:53.033
We're not counting on the Sun
to illuminate these clouds.

00:47:53.033 --> 00:47:56.767
If we did that, it would go
black, light, black, light as

00:47:56.767 --> 00:47:59.400
the Sun illuminated or not.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.233
But instead, we're looking at
the emitted radiation--

00:48:03.233 --> 00:48:05.467
Stefan-Boltzmann-type
emitted radiation

00:48:05.467 --> 00:48:06.900
in the thermal infrared--

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.000
and that'll tell us about where
the clouds are and where

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:10.700
the clear air is.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.800
For example, these light
areas are clouds.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.200
They're higher, so
they are colder.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.400
They emit less.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.967
Just like the problem you had
on the exam, they emit less

00:48:21.967 --> 00:48:23.200
because they're higher.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.367
And that reduction in
emission is shown

00:48:26.367 --> 00:48:30.100
here as a white region.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.200
The lower parts and the surface
of the ocean and the

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.433
surface of the planet
are hotter.

00:48:35.433 --> 00:48:37.733
They emit more.

00:48:37.733 --> 00:48:42.100
And that's illustrated
here by a dark pixel.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.300
So you're basically looking at
a moving temperature map of

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.500
the Earth, where the
temperature's mostly

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.767
controlled by the height of the
object that you're seeing.

00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:56.633
The clouds are high,
so they're cold.

00:48:56.633 --> 00:49:00.333
The ocean and the land are
low, so they're warm.

00:49:00.333 --> 00:49:02.267
I don't think I'll have much
time to talk about this, but I

00:49:02.267 --> 00:49:05.433
just want to leave you with this
image of how this moves.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.467
This is three or four days.

00:49:13.933 --> 00:49:18.033
And some of the things you see
here are the Intertropical

00:49:18.033 --> 00:49:21.100
Convergence Zone, where the
trade winds are converging and

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.900
the air is rising.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.033
And then your eye is really
caught by these mid-latitude

00:49:26.033 --> 00:49:26.900
frontal cyclones.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.400
I'm going to play that one more
time, and look at all

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.633
these little comma-shaped
cloud features here that

00:49:32.633 --> 00:49:36.033
represent this rapid flux
of heat northwards and

00:49:36.033 --> 00:49:40.600
southwards, trying to balance
the Earth's heat budget

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.867
latitude by latitude.

00:49:44.467 --> 00:49:45.400
I'll get this to show again.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.167
I'll show it just one more time,
and then we'll quit.

00:49:51.133 --> 00:49:53.700
We'll quit there and continue
this discussion next time.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.766
Prof: Today we will
begin Purgatorio which is

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.450
a word meaning place of
cleansing,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:18.170
purification and is the middle
section of the poem,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.260
literally a place of transition
between the world of Hell,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.610
and all the evil that we have
witnessed,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.340
and then, the realm of glory
which is going to be Paradise.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.573
Let me say a few things about
Purgatory, both as an idea and

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:47.440
as a poetic construction,
Dante's poetic construction.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.558
As an idea, the way Dante
understands it,

00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:57.550
Purgatory is part of human
geography.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.633
As you know,
it's located in the southern

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:02.960
hemisphere.
 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.402
There are two hemispheres in
medieval geography:

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:09.760
the northern hemisphere,
which is the one we inhabit,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.930
and then there is the southern
hemisphere,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.750
and Purgatory is an island.
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.845
I have tried to explain to you
last time the origin of this

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:20.409
place.
 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.512
In Dante's medieval poetic
thinking it's an island that

00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:32.162
emerged from the northern
hemisphere at the time of

00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:34.310
Lucifer's fall.
 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.110
The earth trembles and
retreats, that's the idea,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.769
as Lucifer approaches and thus
it creates the void which

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:47.920
becomes Hades,
the abyss, and the island--and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.280
the Purgatory emerges on the
other side,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.160
in the southern hemisphere.
 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.159
At the top of the Purgatory,
there is the island--there

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.379
is--the peak is the Garden of
Eden, there where God placed

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.640
Adam and Eve.
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.356
So that from this point of
view, Purgatory is part of human

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:10.460
geography, but it's historically
inaccessible to human beings.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.628
One hero that we already met,
Ulysses,

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:17.712
in Inferno XXVI,
tries to approach an island and

00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:21.269
retrospectively,
we can understand that that was

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.036
the island of Purgatory as if it
were a place of immortality that

00:02:26.036 --> 00:02:29.090
Ulysses wanted to reach and
could not.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.098
That journey of his ended in
shipwreck and tragically.

00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:38.878
Inferno XXVI is the text for
that kind of concern.

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:41.490
The other trait about
Purgatory, a moral trait,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.803
since this is now--we are going
to enter the realm of

00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:48.817
reconstruction of the human and
this sort of makes of sense that

00:02:48.817 --> 00:02:51.940
Dante should place it
immediately after Hell.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.889
It is as if only by knowing,
only by experiencing more or

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.661
less,
as metaphorically as we can,

00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:04.431
through the poetry of Dante,
the nature of evil and the

00:03:04.431 --> 00:03:07.474
horror of it,
can we begin to have an

00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:09.800
appreciation of the good.
 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.750
The good toward which--now the
pilgrim is going to climb.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.746
The other thing that you should
keep in mind about Purgatory,

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:23.411
and the difficulties that the
poet will have,

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.158
is the following.
 

00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:33.116
The perception of moral life
and political life in Inferno

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:37.835
was so satanic,
so narrow, so terrible that

00:03:37.835 --> 00:03:43.057
Dante's going to have a lot of--
quite a challenge to try to

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:48.770
explain the usefulness and the
possibility of reconstructing a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.610
moral world, then the political
world.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.222
He came very close to a total
rejection of the historical

00:03:57.222 --> 00:04:01.752
world and the political world,
and now he has to find out how

00:04:01.752 --> 00:04:04.468
that reconstruction is going to
be possible.

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:08.312
The way he will do this is,
literally, to go back to the

00:04:08.312 --> 00:04:09.430
natural world.
 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.808
Do not expect Dante to imagine
a place where there is some kind

00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:18.329
of redemptive intervention from
the outside that can tell us,

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.019
this is the way you do it.
 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.752
The natural world must be
capable of producing within

00:04:24.752 --> 00:04:29.577
itself some--at least contain
some seeds for a need to

00:04:29.577 --> 00:04:33.310
reconstruct--for a need for the
good.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.579
This is going to be part of his
strategy and his difficulties.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:42.920
A further trait of
Purgatory which was

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.209
really completely missing in
Inferno,

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:47.180
we had never had a sense of
time.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.404
Time was the biological clock
of the pilgrim who was the only

00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:55.583
living creature,
the only truly displaced

00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:59.202
figure, and he is the only
displaced figure throughout the

00:04:59.202 --> 00:04:59.709
poem.
 

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:01.545
In Purgatorio he will
find--in Purgatorio,

00:05:01.545 --> 00:05:02.769
they're all displaced figures.
 

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:06.124
So it's a more human world,
but here, now,

00:05:06.124 --> 00:05:08.660
they have this sense of time.
 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.209
In fact, the first thing that
we come to understand is

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:13.550
how--what time is.
 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.930
It's time understood as future
oriented,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.879
as a projection in some kind of
future,

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.113
and, at the same time,
this idea of time also turns

00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:27.910
out to be a return to the past.
 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.199
So that as the pilgrim is going
ahead,

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.122
he really discovers that he's
going backwards to the Garden of

00:05:35.122 --> 00:05:39.964
Eden: exactly there where Adam
and Eve were placed at the top

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.949
of Purgatory by God at the
time--

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.940
in the story that you have in
Genesis,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.829
for instance.
 

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:50.697
This idea of time,
this will become truly a

00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:52.949
leitmotif throughout Purgatory.
 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.612
The idea of what is the
relationship between the past

00:05:56.612 --> 00:05:59.564
and the future,
since the only real time is

00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:02.310
really the future from that
point of view,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.322
which makes you understand that
even the past was the future at

00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:08.199
some point, at least right?
 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.997
The future is the only thing
that Dante is going to be

00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:14.110
interested in and the future
will come in the possibility of

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.172
a future,
and the way it's related to the

00:06:17.172 --> 00:06:20.620
past will become the object of
his concerns,

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.358
the object of his thinking
openly as he goes through the

00:06:26.358 --> 00:06:29.490
various ledges of Purgatory.
 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.379
Poetically, the
Purgatory is divided into

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.209
two--into three parts,
I would say actually.

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:38.665
The first part is the so-called
anti-Purgatory,

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:41.069
made of souls who are waiting.
 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:44.338
They're not really penitent
yet, but waiting to be assigned

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:46.480
a particular place along the
ledges.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.639
And then, the so-called
penitents before going through

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.767
the process of cleansing,
beginning with pride,

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:57.129
and ending up with lechery at--
just before the pilgrim gets

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:59.040
into the Garden of Eden.
 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.115
The ordering of sins is the
exact reversal of the ordering

00:07:04.115 --> 00:07:06.699
of sins you had in Inferno.
 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.300
Here you begin with a spiritual
sin or intellectual sin,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.531
the question of pride,
and end up with the most

00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:17.129
physical and material of them
all,

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:22.321
lechery, which as you recall is
the inverted image of what

00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:27.785
happened in Inferno with Lucifer
and the sin of Lucifer being

00:07:27.785 --> 00:07:32.430
really a sin of pride at the end
of Canto XXIV.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.584
Well, having said this maybe
other things will come to mind

00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:40.600
as I go on today.
 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.509
Let me begin with some other--a
couple of details as I--just as

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:49.750
I get into--plunge into Canto I.
 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.949
What is the pilgrim now?
 

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.249
The poem--the journey began on
Good Thursday,

00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:57.910
as it's called.
 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.720
Dante spends the first night
but the journey--

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.531
the real journey begins on Good
Friday in a clear imitation of

00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:11.963
Christ's harrowing of Hell and
emergence into the light on

00:08:11.963 --> 00:08:13.680
Easter Sunday.
 

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.769
That's where we are now,
Easter Sunday morning.

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:21.028
If the Inferno begins at dusk
therefore, the idea of the

00:08:21.028 --> 00:08:25.134
approaching night that stands
for the unknowability of

00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:28.000
whatever he is going to
confront.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.620
Dante's fascinated with the
idea of the night throughout

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.740
Inferno.
 

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.712
Imagine--remember Ulysses who
travels following the sun and

00:08:37.712 --> 00:08:41.399
then ends up really gazing at
the night,

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:44.095
the unknowability of his
destiny, the unknowability of

00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:45.570
the place even where he is.
 

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.125
Now we begin with dawn and
therefore Canto I of Purgatorio

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.307
becomes that which in
Provençal literature is

00:08:52.307 --> 00:08:55.493
called an aubade,
from the word,

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:59.509
aube, alba in Italian,
aubade.

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:03.778
The song--the dawn song,
a song that in many ways

00:09:03.778 --> 00:09:08.313
reverses the grand tradition of
the erotic lyrics of

00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:13.383
Provençal poetry where
the dawn becomes the unhappy

00:09:13.383 --> 00:09:18.895
time for the parting of lovers
and here now its regained as the

00:09:18.895 --> 00:09:23.686
great time when,
finally, the pilgrim can go on

00:09:23.686 --> 00:09:28.211
and the poet can go on mapping,
literally now mapping the

00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:32.157
journey, sailing through or
sending as the metaphor that he

00:09:32.157 --> 00:09:35.538
asks--
that he adopts can be.

00:09:35.538 --> 00:09:38.048
The poem--the second part of
the poem,

00:09:38.048 --> 00:09:40.075
Purgatorio begins,
first of all,

00:09:40.075 --> 00:09:43.602
with an image of water and
therefore it carries further

00:09:43.602 --> 00:09:46.870
this motif of the cleansing and
purification,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.389
but really with a better
metaphor from our point of view.

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:54.440
"To course over better
waters the little bark of my wit

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.681
now lifts her sails,
leaving behind her so cruel a

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:03.222
sea, and I will sing of that
second kingdom where the human

00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:07.610
spirit is purged and becomes fit
to ascend to Heaven.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.844
But here let poetry rise again
from the dead,

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:15.019
O holy Muses,
since I am yours;

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:19.221
and here let Calliope rise up
for a while and accompany my

00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:23.422
song with that strain which
smote the ears of the wretched

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:26.960
pies so that they despaired of
pardon."

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.527
It's an extraordinary proem to
Purgatorio,

00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:32.460
for a number of reasons.
 

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.519
First of all,
Dante picks up the metaphor of

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:41.678
the epic topos,
the epic metaphor of the

00:10:41.678 --> 00:10:46.870
journey with which the poem
began,

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.529
'in the middle of the journey
of our life,' as you recall.

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:55.318
But now this idea of the
process as indicated with--first

00:10:55.318 --> 00:11:00.488
of all, it's sailing,
therefore literally recalling

00:11:00.488 --> 00:11:03.590
the sea voyage of Ulysses.
 

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.320
That's an oblique metaphor.
 

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.418
I want to draw your attention
to the use of this adjective--

00:11:10.418 --> 00:11:14.190
a comparative adjective--that's
what we call it in grammar,

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.440
as you recall:
"the better waters."

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:24.077
It's just Dante's emphasis,
exactly on the process and then

00:11:24.077 --> 00:11:26.940
the comparatively good.
 

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.330
This is not the best of waters;
it's not the worst of waters;

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.980
this is the better waters.
 

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.440
We are really on the way to
better things.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.340
It's a world of degree that
Dante introduces.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:46.785
Dante really believes in a sort
of hierarchy and a hierarchy of

00:11:46.785 --> 00:11:50.841
values, of states,
of powers, of beauty,

00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:52.610
of intellect.
 

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.561
The world cannot be--it's never
a dualistic world between what's

00:11:57.561 --> 00:11:59.288
bad and what's good.
 

00:11:59.288 --> 00:12:03.527
There's a lot of mediations,
meditating steps along the way,

00:12:03.527 --> 00:12:07.620
and now he already introduces
this whole question with the

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.918
notion of the better waters.
 

00:12:09.918 --> 00:12:12.788
"The little bark"
with its--this is not only a

00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:15.678
journey;
this is a journey of poetry.

00:12:15.678 --> 00:12:19.441
It is as if Dante now wants to
highlight a motif which is going

00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:23.019
to be very crucial throughout
the poem and in our reading of

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:23.870
this poem.
 

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.677
That the reading of this poem,
and I have been addressing this

00:12:26.677 --> 00:12:30.672
issue to some of your questions,
that there really is no sharp,

00:12:30.672 --> 00:12:34.642
no drastic discontinuity
between the journey of the

00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:37.740
pilgrim and the journey of the
poet.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.500
That the journey of the poet is
an extension;

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.162
it, in itself,
is a journey--in of itself is a

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:46.240
journey of knowledge and the
journey of discovery.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.293
Dante makes large claims for
poetry: poetry is a way of

00:12:51.293 --> 00:12:52.230
knowing.
 

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.788
It's just not a
re-commemoration of the past.

00:12:56.788 --> 00:12:59.971
Now here, he talks about the
journey as being the journey of

00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:02.668
the poet, "the little bark
of my wit."

00:13:02.668 --> 00:13:05.921
It's a conventional way of
thinking about the bark of

00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:09.315
poetry with which he is--
there seems to be a way of

00:13:09.315 --> 00:13:11.937
saying this is now more--
at this stage,

00:13:11.937 --> 00:13:15.932
at least, he wants us to think
about the journey of poetry and

00:13:15.932 --> 00:13:19.210
not just the journey that he
himself will use--

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.690
will undertake the journey of
the pilgrim,

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:28.527
the hard, difficult journey
filled with fear that he was

00:13:28.527 --> 00:13:32.028
experiencing in Inferno.
 

00:13:32.028 --> 00:13:34.849
I also want to draw your
attention to another little

00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:36.009
detail of the text.
 

00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:39.658
This is--the first time now
that Dante will use the future

00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:40.169
tense.
 

00:13:40.169 --> 00:13:41.808
"I will sing."
 

00:13:41.808 --> 00:13:44.587
We're in a world open to
futurity and,

00:13:44.587 --> 00:13:48.719
if it's open to futurity,
the only way of thinking about

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:52.700
futurity is made possible by a
belief in the new.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.741
You have to--you cannot really
think--yes, you can think of the

00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:00.067
future, but if the future is
exactly as it is today,

00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:02.350
then you really have no future.
 

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.684
Then you really think that all
is released into the domain of

00:14:06.684 --> 00:14:07.480
sameness.
 

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.373
If my day today is exactly
what--the world that I

00:14:11.373 --> 00:14:14.374
experienced yesterday,
there's no new,

00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:16.240
no idea of the new.
 

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.125
And Dante: here,
uses the future,

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:21.250
and clearly implying that there
is an alternative,

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.311
a difference,
a possibility of doing things

00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:27.298
in ways that have not been done
before.

00:14:27.298 --> 00:14:30.759
This is going to be a new
departure,

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:34.028
a new departure for thought,
a new departure for the

00:14:34.028 --> 00:14:37.212
imagination,
and now he says it has to be

00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:40.389
also a new departure for poetry
itself.

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:44.200
I emphasize this idea of the
future "will sing."

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.522
The first time that he--he
wasn't saying this in

00:14:46.522 --> 00:14:48.745
Inferno,
of course he couldn't even say

00:14:48.745 --> 00:14:50.080
that in the Vita nuova.
 

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.298
You remember that I pointed out
when we were reading that little

00:14:53.298 --> 00:14:56.092
autobiographical,
great, text called the Vita

00:14:56.092 --> 00:14:58.590
nuova, at the beginning of the
term,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:04.163
I indicated to you that there
is never the future tense used

00:15:04.163 --> 00:15:05.580
in that text.
 

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.315
It was all a book of memory
with the difficulties and the

00:15:09.315 --> 00:15:10.649
dangers of memory.
 

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:13.895
The dangers of memory being
that memory changes,

00:15:13.895 --> 00:15:16.658
can draw us into a world of
phantasms.

00:15:16.658 --> 00:15:19.831
That's one of the--it's not a
rejection of memory,

00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:23.070
only a way of highlighting its
possible dangers.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.851
And the belief that unless you
live with some idea of danger,

00:15:26.851 --> 00:15:29.750
maybe we're not really thinking
hard enough.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.219
Here now it's the--the only
time that the future was used in

00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:36.158
the Vita nuova was either in the
idea of death,

00:15:36.158 --> 00:15:40.655
when Dante has a prophetic
dream and he hears a voice that

00:15:40.655 --> 00:15:43.259
he perceives as a kind of soul.
 

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:47.469
So truth laden it is in that
voice that he thinks of it as a

00:15:47.469 --> 00:15:50.894
kind of prophecy,
as a sort of oracle speaking to

00:15:50.894 --> 00:15:52.750
him: you too will die.
 

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:57.024
Beatrice has just died and then
the death of Beatrice brings to

00:15:57.024 --> 00:16:00.538
his mind the fear and threat of
mortality to him.

00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:02.962
You too will die:
that's the way the future is

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.308
going to be understood.
 

00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:07.178
Then the poem,
the whole Vita nuova ends with

00:16:07.178 --> 00:16:10.856
a statement of hope,
and hope to work and write

00:16:10.856 --> 00:16:15.880
things whereby I can say things
about Beatrice that had never

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.235
been said about any woman and so
that becomes the two

00:16:20.235 --> 00:16:23.000
possibilities of the future.
 

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.792
The only--literally once
grammatically the future tense

00:16:25.792 --> 00:16:28.648
and the other with--
through this periphrastic

00:16:28.648 --> 00:16:31.059
construction,
this oblique construction about

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:32.890
the hope,
the verb use of the hope

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.629
in--with the idea of the future
indicated there.

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:41.003
Then, "but here let poetry
rise again from the dead,"

00:16:41.003 --> 00:16:45.452
and the prayer to the muses,
very much in the style of the

00:16:45.452 --> 00:16:48.190
epic tradition and especially of
the muses,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.908
to want the muse of epic
poetry, Calliope.

00:16:51.908 --> 00:16:56.950
Then the focus of Calliope will
really tell you something about

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.575
the kind of--
think retrospectively really

00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:03.941
explains,
"but let dead poetry rise

00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:06.118
again from the dead."
 

00:17:06.118 --> 00:17:10.695
The poem presents itself as
Calliope, was the mother of

00:17:10.695 --> 00:17:11.289
whom?
 

00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:13.099
Anybody remember?
 

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.798
Remember your mythology?
 

00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:18.940
Okay, no you don't now,
but it's the mother of Orpheus,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:25.259
so let dead poetry rise again
from the dead it's--

00:17:25.259 --> 00:17:28.348
Dante presents himself as he
were an orphic poet.

00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:31.580
He was not an orphic poet,
but it's really a poet in the

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.519
tradition of Orpheus who wants
to conquer death;

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:38.221
that's clearly not for him,
that's what the Orpheus descent

00:17:38.221 --> 00:17:42.048
into the underworld really is
the way of conquering death.

00:17:42.048 --> 00:17:46.088
The belief that poetry can do
the trick,

00:17:46.088 --> 00:17:49.858
that through poetry we
immortalize ourselves,

00:17:49.858 --> 00:17:52.858
we conquer death,
he is going to very soon to

00:17:52.858 --> 00:17:56.950
understand that that's not the
way he is going to do that.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.368
Then something in the second
paragraph I want to read it a

00:18:00.368 --> 00:18:03.432
little bit,
because it really gives you a

00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:07.650
different sense of the tonality
of Purgatorio,

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.420
because not only do you have
now morning and time,

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.230
you also for the first time
have light.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.848
Not the sort of spectacular
shades of light,

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:22.152
the blue, the reds,
the green with which he

00:18:22.152 --> 00:18:26.712
experiences and dramatizes
Paradise according to the

00:18:26.712 --> 00:18:30.410
lights emanating from the
various planets,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.779
the red of Mars,
the white of Jupiter,

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:37.886
the blue of Saturn and so there
is a kind of polychromic palette

00:18:37.886 --> 00:18:40.400
that is going to be deployed.
 

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.730
Here it's now a more human and
natural world,

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.954
the natural world,
and listen to this and this

00:18:45.954 --> 00:18:49.220
enables me to say something else
about the traits of Purgatorio.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.829
"The sweet hue of the
oriental sapphire which was

00:18:52.829 --> 00:18:57.191
gathering the serene face of the
heavens from the clear zenith to

00:18:57.191 --> 00:19:00.844
the first circle,
gladdened my eyes again as soon

00:19:00.844 --> 00:19:05.153
as I passed out of the dead air
which had afflicted my eyes and

00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:05.848
breast.
 

00:19:05.848 --> 00:19:09.980
The fair planet that prompts
to," Venus,

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:15.748
the morning star,
"to love made all the east

00:19:15.748 --> 00:19:18.246
laugh,
veiling the Fishes which were

00:19:18.246 --> 00:19:18.930
in her train.
 

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.509
I turned to the right."
 

00:19:20.509 --> 00:19:24.500
You remember that I sort of
tried to explain to you that,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.240
with one exception that I can't
explain,

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.310
nobody can explain,
and very few people have

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.740
noticed the--
Dante is now turning to the

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.940
right, which is to say that even
while going down,

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.105
spiraling down in the world of
Hell he actually was going to

00:19:41.105 --> 00:19:41.750
the right.
 

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.786
Though he said that he was
going to the left,

00:19:43.786 --> 00:19:46.470
and he was going to the left
because he was upside down.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.429
Now he is right side up and so
the directions of the human

00:19:51.429 --> 00:19:54.298
world are going to be regained.
 

00:19:54.298 --> 00:19:56.848
"I turned to the
right," he will never use

00:19:56.848 --> 00:19:59.105
this image again,
"and set my mind on the

00:19:59.105 --> 00:20:01.624
other pole,
and I saw four stars never seen

00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:03.871
before but by the first
people,"

00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:04.868
Adam and Eve.
 

00:20:04.868 --> 00:20:07.298
"The skies seem to rejoice
in their flames.

00:20:07.298 --> 00:20:10.962
O widowed region of the north,
since thou art denied that

00:20:10.962 --> 00:20:11.880
sight!"
 

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.828
The northern hemisphere is
where we are.

00:20:14.828 --> 00:20:16.440
Dante's in the southern
hemisphere.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.160
He is connecting with us,
telling us what we are deprived

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.288
of in--by not knowing,
by having lost Paradise.

00:20:25.288 --> 00:20:29.145
A couple of things that I will
not--since Dante will go back to

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.078
these images.
 

00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:37.971
The way he literally orients
himself: the metaphor he uses is

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:41.761
that of--
is the oriental light,

00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:46.768
and the way he's always
orienting or reorienting

00:20:46.768 --> 00:20:47.940
himself.
 

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.598
How do you know where you are,
is now in Purgatorio and also

00:20:51.598 --> 00:20:55.616
in Paradise,
when thinking about characters

00:20:55.616 --> 00:21:01.071
here on earth and recalling
their lives it's always by

00:21:01.071 --> 00:21:03.440
looking at the east.
 

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.048
It's always by looking in the
light of the east,

00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:10.625
and from this point of view
Dante really retrieves that most

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:14.200
incredible metaphor that is
available among the mystics,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.259
medieval mystics,
and I'm thinking--

00:21:16.259 --> 00:21:17.568
or thinkers.
 

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:19.730
I'm thinking of even Boethius,
Cassiodorus--

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.930
I hope they're not just names
for you--

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.180
who think--who believe that you
can only think,

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.278
that we in the west,
the western light,

00:21:28.278 --> 00:21:32.480
can only think by looking
toward the east.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.213
That the way in which we can be
orienting ourselves is by trying

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:40.068
to capture the source of that
light.

00:21:40.068 --> 00:21:42.565
I mean this in the most
metaphorical,

00:21:42.565 --> 00:21:45.824
and as we shall see,
the widest senses possible,

00:21:45.824 --> 00:21:48.318
but that's all he is saying
now.

00:21:48.318 --> 00:21:50.202
But at the same time,
in the language,

00:21:50.202 --> 00:21:52.796
it's incredible how it has
shifted between the first

00:21:52.796 --> 00:21:54.779
paragraph and the second
paragraph.

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:57.564
That which seems to be the
excitement for the light,

00:21:57.564 --> 00:21:59.420
and now he's experiencing
again;

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.990
it's Easter Sunday.
 

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.597
He understands the
Resurrection,

00:22:03.597 --> 00:22:07.470
this is going to hit him very
strongly now,

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.420
but it's also an elegiac--the
tonality is elegiac,

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.842
the idea of what we have lost,
the widowed region of the

00:22:17.842 --> 00:22:22.104
northern hemisphere,
the sense of general loss,

00:22:22.104 --> 00:22:26.169
though it's a provisional
privilege for him to see all

00:22:26.169 --> 00:22:28.500
this,
but this indicates and

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.778
introduces that the
extraordinary tension,

00:22:31.778 --> 00:22:33.420
poetic tension in
Purgatory.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.704
The dialectic between
excitement for the future and an

00:22:38.704 --> 00:22:40.798
elegy for the past.
 

00:22:40.798 --> 00:22:44.657
The pilgrim is caught in
between and we shall see the

00:22:44.657 --> 00:22:48.059
consequences between--
this is still at the level of

00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:51.933
tonality I would call it,
but we shall see what this

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:54.298
really means in a moment.
 

00:22:54.298 --> 00:22:57.781
As Dante approaches now,
"When I have withdrawn my

00:22:57.781 --> 00:22:59.328
gaze," and so on.
 

00:22:59.328 --> 00:23:02.700
This is line 25:
"When I have withdrawn my

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.068
gaze from them,"
turning to the stars,

00:23:06.068 --> 00:23:07.990
"turning a little toward
the other pole,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.778
where the Wain had already
disappeared,

00:23:09.778 --> 00:23:14.798
I saw beside me an old man
alone, worthy by his looks of so

00:23:14.798 --> 00:23:19.298
great reverence that no son owes
more to a father;

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:23.419
his beard was long and streaked
with white, and his hair the

00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:26.770
same, a double tress falling on
his breast,"

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.328
etc.
 

00:23:27.328 --> 00:23:31.863
This is going to be the
encounter with Cato and I want

00:23:31.863 --> 00:23:33.660
to talk about Cato.
 

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.901
Let me just give you a little
bit of extra Dantesque

00:23:38.901 --> 00:23:40.338
information.
 

00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:43.111
I mean in a way,
this is--you probably do not

00:23:43.111 --> 00:23:50.219
know that this representation,
we call this descriptio of the

00:23:50.219 --> 00:23:55.920
old man with the beard or
white--

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.500
streaked with white but on two
sides really is the paradigm--

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.558
the model that Michelangelo
writes--

00:24:05.558 --> 00:24:09.769
Michelangelo follows in his
conception of Moses.

00:24:09.769 --> 00:24:13.019
Though Dante doesn't lose sight
of the fact that this is Cato.

00:24:13.019 --> 00:24:17.888
Just a little piece of how
Michelangelo read this

00:24:17.888 --> 00:24:20.019
particular meeting.
 

00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:21.470
Who is this Cato?
 

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:27.683
Dante describes him as an old
man, and we also know that he's

00:24:27.683 --> 00:24:28.720
a Roman.
 

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.313
He's a pagan,
and he's not only a pagan,

00:24:31.313 --> 00:24:32.710
he's a man of laws.
 

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.450
The first thing that he wonders
and he says,

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.096
paragraph, "Who are ye
that I have fled,"

00:24:40.096 --> 00:24:45.673
these are just people who have
tried to literally escape from

00:24:45.673 --> 00:24:48.290
prison,
"the eternal prison

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.980
against the blind stream?'
 

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.611
he said..
 

00:24:50.611 --> 00:24:54.749
.'Who has guided you or who was
your lantern in coming forth

00:24:54.749 --> 00:24:58.676
from profound night that holds
in perpetual blackness the

00:24:58.676 --> 00:25:00.078
valley of Hell?
 

00:25:00.078 --> 00:25:02.628
Are the laws of the abyss thus
broken,"

00:25:02.628 --> 00:25:05.118
this is the Roman tradition of
the law,

00:25:05.118 --> 00:25:06.970
"are there laws of the
abyss."

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.401
In a way this is a man who is a
stranger to the world of

00:25:10.401 --> 00:25:11.150
Purgatory.
 

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.704
He certainly doesn't seem to
understand the heaven may have

00:25:15.704 --> 00:25:20.496
been some grace that maybe Dante
and his guide are here out of

00:25:20.496 --> 00:25:25.287
some providential intervention
which is not to be explained by

00:25:25.287 --> 00:25:29.402
laws or by natural,
or by the laws of nature,

00:25:29.402 --> 00:25:31.058
or by manmade laws.
 

00:25:31.058 --> 00:25:33.462
"Are the laws of the abyss
broken or has a new

00:25:33.462 --> 00:25:34.809
decree,"
he wonders,

00:25:34.809 --> 00:25:37.865
"been made in heaven that,
being damned,

00:25:37.865 --> 00:25:39.740
you come to my cliffs?'
 

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.558
My leader," Virgil.
 

00:25:42.558 --> 00:25:47.965
The two Romans talk now and I
who myself, "Then answered

00:25:47.965 --> 00:25:50.670
him: 'Of myself,
I came not.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.182
A lady,"
Beatrice, a recapitulation of

00:25:54.182 --> 00:25:56.938
Inferno I,
"descended from Heaven for

00:25:56.938 --> 00:26:00.058
whose prayers I succoured this
man with my companionship;

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:03.448
but since this is thy will to
have it made more plain how in

00:26:03.448 --> 00:26:06.778
truth it stands with us,
it cannot be mine to deny thee.

00:26:06.778 --> 00:26:10.650
This man never saw his last
hour, but by his folly was so

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.829
near to it that little time was
left to run.

00:26:13.829 --> 00:26:15.088
I was sent to him ...
 

00:26:15.088 --> 00:26:20.035
I have shown him all the guilty
race and now purpose to show him

00:26:20.035 --> 00:26:24.509
those spirits that cleanse
themselves under thy charge.

00:26:24.509 --> 00:26:28.200
How I have led him would be
long to tell thee;

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.176
there descends from above
virtue which aids me in bringing

00:26:32.176 --> 00:26:34.618
him to see thee and to hear
thee.

00:26:34.618 --> 00:26:36.788
May it please thee to be
gracious to his coming.

00:26:36.788 --> 00:26:41.738
He goes seeking liberty which
is so dear, as he knows who

00:26:41.738 --> 00:26:44.390
gives his life for it."
 

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.490
And the reference is clearly to
Cato himself who,

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:55.199
historically--a historical
figure--actually committed

00:26:55.199 --> 00:27:02.682
suicide in the civil war and
refusing to take sides between

00:27:02.682 --> 00:27:09.584
Pompey and Caesar,
as is told in the great epic by

00:27:09.584 --> 00:27:12.272
Lucan,
the Roman Spanish poet,

00:27:12.272 --> 00:27:14.818
who wrote the so-called Civil
War.

00:27:14.818 --> 00:27:21.782
A text that is very polemical,
in between-among other

00:27:21.782 --> 00:27:24.730
things--with Virgil.
 

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.346
"Thou knowest it,
since death for it was no

00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:30.130
bitter to thee in Utica,"
in North Africa,

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.143
"where thou didst leave
the vesture,"

00:27:33.143 --> 00:27:37.330
the body,
"which in the great day

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.640
will be so bright.
 

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.199
The eternal edicts are not
broken for us,

00:27:42.199 --> 00:27:45.269
for this man lives and Minos
does not bind me;

00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:48.048
but I am of the circle,"
Limbo,

00:27:48.048 --> 00:27:50.696
"where are the chased eyes
of thy Marcia,"

00:27:50.696 --> 00:27:52.747
his wife,
"who in her looks still

00:27:52.747 --> 00:27:54.272
prays thee,
O holy breast,

00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:56.368
that thou hold her for thine
own.

00:27:56.368 --> 00:27:59.756
For her love,
then, do thou incline to us,

00:27:59.756 --> 00:28:03.390
allow us to go through thy
seven kingdoms.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.884
I will report to her thy
kindness if thou deign to be

00:28:06.884 --> 00:28:08.900
spoken of there below."
 

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.105
And he responds,
"Marcia so pleased my eyes

00:28:12.105 --> 00:28:14.630
while I was yonder,' he said
then,

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.160
"that whatever kindness
she sought of me I did;

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.734
now that she dwells beyond the
evil stream she cannot move me

00:28:21.734 --> 00:28:25.549
more, by the law which was made
when I came forth from thence.

00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:28.900
But if a lady," etc.
 

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:33.298
This is an amazing from--in
substantial terms,

00:28:33.298 --> 00:28:38.913
an amazing beginning in the
poem because Dante meets Cato

00:28:38.913 --> 00:28:43.089
whom he defines--
we are being told there that

00:28:43.089 --> 00:28:48.190
he's an old man,
a pagan, and a suicide.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.910
There are traits that Virgil
singles out,

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:56.137
obliquely referring to his
adventures and that clearly

00:28:56.137 --> 00:28:59.088
contradict the world of
Purgatory,

00:28:59.088 --> 00:29:02.000
because the Purgatory is a
Christian canticle.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.233
This is Easter Sunday,
why have it inaugurated by the

00:29:06.233 --> 00:29:11.118
presence of the pagan who knew
nothing of the incarnation?

00:29:11.118 --> 00:29:15.435
Why have it--it's the Rome of a
renewed life,

00:29:15.435 --> 00:29:18.380
why start it with a suicide?
 

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.890
Someone who--we saw what Dante
thought of the suicides when--

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.308
in a complicated way throughout
Inferno,

00:29:25.308 --> 00:29:28.788
there were a number of suicides
inhabiting various aspects of--

00:29:28.788 --> 00:29:33.048
various regions of Hell,
but especially among the--

00:29:33.048 --> 00:29:37.470
with the violent against nature
Inferno XIII and so,

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.904
an old man, a suicide,
and a pagan:

00:29:39.904 --> 00:29:41.480
why does he do this?
 

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:47.700
A figure that he draws out of
the world of Lucan;

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.598
what we are told about him this
is--

00:29:50.598 --> 00:29:53.890
usually whenever you have
representations of the beyond,

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.750
you always have a young man,
for instance a juvenis,

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.894
or this is a character,
the Latin term meaning the

00:29:58.894 --> 00:30:01.144
young,
in Alain de Lille for example

00:30:01.144 --> 00:30:05.109
there's always a young man or a
young woman who is welcoming to

00:30:05.109 --> 00:30:07.834
indicate the renewed life,
the novelty,

00:30:07.834 --> 00:30:09.509
the freshness of a life.
 

00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:13.398
You certainly don't have an old
man and you certainly do not

00:30:13.398 --> 00:30:14.519
have a suicide.
 

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:18.898
Now the question of the suicide
is probably the easiest to

00:30:18.898 --> 00:30:23.509
determine because Cato's suicide
is a suicide for freedom.

00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:29.939
Let me say a couple of things
about freedom because it's--I

00:30:29.939 --> 00:30:35.259
call Purgatory,
really, the domain of freedom.

00:30:35.259 --> 00:30:37.308
It's really the place of
freedom.

00:30:37.308 --> 00:30:41.892
He begins here explaining,
as it were, a political,

00:30:41.892 --> 00:30:44.000
but also moral state.
 

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.297
It's political because it's a
refusal of the disarray and

00:30:49.297 --> 00:30:54.690
chaos brought in by the war
between Pompey and Caesar,

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.490
at the time of the civil war,
but it is also a moral state,

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.979
because Cato decides to put an
end to his life in a sort of

00:31:02.979 --> 00:31:07.994
sacrificial move;
as if to draw attention to the

00:31:07.994 --> 00:31:12.838
way in which the state had been
killed,

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:18.521
had been destroyed by the
rivalry between these two great

00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:24.608
figures who have not opposed,
but have a rivalry about power.

00:31:24.608 --> 00:31:28.849
Freedom is to the fundamental
problem, it's a Roman issue let

00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:29.838
me just say.
 

00:31:29.838 --> 00:31:33.702
Dante wants us to think of it
at the very beginning of

00:31:33.702 --> 00:31:37.055
Purgatorio,
in pagan intellectual terms,

00:31:37.055 --> 00:31:37.930
freedom.
 

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:42.388
The whole Purgatory ends
up with the pilgrim regaining

00:31:42.388 --> 00:31:44.926
and being crowned,
as he'll say,

00:31:44.926 --> 00:31:47.558
with the attainment of free
will,

00:31:47.558 --> 00:31:52.435
so the whole poem really moves
this idea of Cato's search for

00:31:52.435 --> 00:31:54.179
freedom,
press for freedom,

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:56.210
and the pilgrim's attainment of
free will.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:00.067
Now there is an obvious
relationship to begin with

00:32:00.067 --> 00:32:02.586
between freedom,
on the one hand,

00:32:02.586 --> 00:32:06.210
and, I would say,
the future on the other.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.801
The poem begins with the future
and now we are going to be said

00:32:09.801 --> 00:32:12.700
what are they--what is the
virtue of the future?

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:17.832
You cannot conceive of freedom,
unless you have an idea of the

00:32:17.832 --> 00:32:18.588
future.
 

00:32:18.588 --> 00:32:22.500
You cannot--you understand the
connection between the two?

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.553
You cannot conceive of a
novelty unless you have an idea

00:32:25.553 --> 00:32:28.440
of the future and unless you
have idea of freedom.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.787
The notion of originality is
actually, even poetic

00:32:31.787 --> 00:32:35.613
originality, is impossible,
unless it's tied to a certain

00:32:35.613 --> 00:32:36.980
idea of freedom.
 

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.820
It presupposes them all,
so that the attainment of

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.010
freedom really means poetic
originality, the idea of the

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.650
future.
 

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.170
The notion that things can be
different.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.952
If I am slave to the past,
if I am a slave to a political

00:32:49.952 --> 00:32:53.125
order,
if I am slave to my own vices,

00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:56.460
as internalized as that quest
can be,

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.038
then I really have no freedom.
 

00:32:58.038 --> 00:33:02.960
Cato embodies one who refuses
living--

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.700
if living means living in a
state of tyranny to civil war,

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.588
violence, and therefore to the
impossibility of a moral life.

00:33:12.588 --> 00:33:16.769
That's easy to determine,
that's easy to explain.

00:33:16.769 --> 00:33:20.848
I even think that the notion of
the old man can be explained.

00:33:20.848 --> 00:33:23.019
Dante wants to draw our
attention, first of all,

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:25.180
that somehow the search for the
future,

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:30.548
he's--it's not an alternative
to the past,

00:33:30.548 --> 00:33:33.220
it grows out of the past so
that we--

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.415
he's rejecting the idea that
there may be some sharp

00:33:36.415 --> 00:33:40.365
distinction between the two and
that the seeds of the future are

00:33:40.365 --> 00:33:44.980
already contained in the past,
in a figure such as an old man,

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.450
Cato.
 

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:48.686
The third problem is the
question his being a pagan,

00:33:48.686 --> 00:33:51.988
and this brings me back to that
which is the project,

00:33:51.988 --> 00:33:54.210
Dante's project,
in Purgatorio.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.431
The project is that there
is--he must make a careful

00:33:57.431 --> 00:33:58.820
distinction, which St.
 

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.788
Augustine could not make in the
City of God.

00:34:01.788 --> 00:34:05.390
Dante will make it,
that's his--that's Dante's

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.548
target, polemical target.
 

00:34:07.548 --> 00:34:12.898
Augustine really distinguishes
between the earthly city and the

00:34:12.898 --> 00:34:14.280
heavenly city.
 

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:18.822
And the heavenly city may live
on earth, but it's really a

00:34:18.822 --> 00:34:23.682
pilgrim church going on toward
the beatitude and the encounter

00:34:23.682 --> 00:34:24.719
with God.
 

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:30.300
The earthly city is corrupt and
in many ways not assimilable to

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.000
the world of the Redemption.
 

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.835
This--if you are an Augustinian
and you have very supple view of

00:34:38.835 --> 00:34:41.701
Augustine--
may strike you as crude,

00:34:41.701 --> 00:34:45.509
but I don't think that it
really violates the essence of

00:34:45.509 --> 00:34:49.317
that dual idea between the
earthly city and the heavenly

00:34:49.317 --> 00:34:50.010
city.
 

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:54.849
Dante is literally talking
against the Augustinian dualism.

00:34:54.849 --> 00:34:57.878
There is in nature,
that is within the pagan

00:34:57.878 --> 00:35:02.507
secular historical world,
there are seeds that can become

00:35:02.507 --> 00:35:06.110
crucial for the making of the
political,

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.065
for the making of a new moral
life that will be really

00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:12.911
consonant with,
not dissonant with,

00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:16.585
in accord with the Redemption,
and the Christian Redemption,

00:35:16.585 --> 00:35:17.929
that he will be actually
seeking.

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:20.349
Keep this very much in mind.
 

00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:23.179
A sign of this incredible
tension--

00:35:23.179 --> 00:35:27.039
time, the meaning of freedom,
the value of the pagan world,

00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:32.777
the insistence on the secular
as capable of producing some

00:35:32.777 --> 00:35:37.789
kind of seed for the future--
emerges really in the second

00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:40.824
paragraph,
when finally Virgil,

00:35:40.824 --> 00:35:45.518
to bend to the harshness,
to temper the harshness of

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:48.735
Cato, says look,
let us go through because I

00:35:48.735 --> 00:35:49.949
know your wife.
 

00:35:49.949 --> 00:35:52.710
Very Italian,
I know your wife and I'm going

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.510
to go very back,
that is to say I know who you

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.619
are so do me a favor because
I'll be doing her a favor,

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:02.027
let me go and Marcia--let
Marcia--I will go there and they

00:36:02.027 --> 00:36:04.539
will tell her what a great man
you are,

00:36:04.539 --> 00:36:07.250
what a good man you are.
 

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:12.811
What he is doing he's appealing
to Cato's effective memory and

00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:16.914
it is an appeal,
it's a solicitation that Cato

00:36:16.914 --> 00:36:18.010
refuses.
 

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:22.005
She can do nothing for me:
he refuses to be determined by

00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:22.789
the past.
 

00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:25.090
You see the ambiguities that
are running through.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.382
Dante understands that you have
to go through some other poet

00:36:28.382 --> 00:36:31.619
and the figuration understands
that you cannot really have a

00:36:31.619 --> 00:36:34.637
sense of the future without
being rooted in the past and

00:36:34.637 --> 00:36:38.369
then here you have Cato who can
only make sharp distinctions,

00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:40.119
she can do nothing about me.
 

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:42.018
I could tell you that this is a
very--

00:36:42.018 --> 00:36:49.059
the appeal to Marcia's memory
for Cato can become also--

00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:54.050
is full of ironies and I will
only tell you--

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:57.250
we can't--it would take us too
far afield,

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.030
I can tell you that in effect,
in the history of Cato,

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.050
Marcia had left.
 

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:07.795
She had asked Cato to divorce
her because she wanted to marry

00:37:07.795 --> 00:37:12.277
somebody else,
and at the death of the other

00:37:12.277 --> 00:37:17.690
husband Marcia asks Cato to take
her and he will.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.119
And Dante is--Dante recounts
this whole story in the

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:24.954
Banquet and views it as a
sign of the extraordinary

00:37:24.954 --> 00:37:26.768
generosity of this man.
 

00:37:26.768 --> 00:37:31.898
There is all of that lore in
the background of this reference

00:37:31.898 --> 00:37:34.585
to Cato,
but from our point of view

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:38.547
then, it is a question of the
power of memory and the limits

00:37:38.547 --> 00:37:39.420
of memory.
 

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:44.739
And then finally the--he will
go on saying--

00:37:44.739 --> 00:37:49.306
giving some--Cato will go on
giving some rules that he has to

00:37:49.306 --> 00:37:53.114
follow in the process of
cleansing: you go and wash

00:37:53.114 --> 00:37:56.159
yourself from the stain of
Inferno,

00:37:56.159 --> 00:37:58.800
he will tell him,
and gird your loins.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.460
They will be there.
 

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.070
He will mention and go to the
desert shore,

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.405
therefore go and--this is the
last paragraph:

00:38:06.405 --> 00:38:09.969
"The dawn,"
here is the dawn song,

00:38:09.969 --> 00:38:12.688
"was overcoming the
morning breeze which fled before

00:38:12.688 --> 00:38:14.490
it,
so that I descried far off the

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.599
trembling of the sea.
 

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:18.653
We made our way over the lonely
plain, like one who returns to

00:38:18.653 --> 00:38:20.806
the road he has lost and,
until he finds it,

00:38:20.806 --> 00:38:22.559
seems to himself to go in vain.
 

00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:25.780
When we were at a part where
the dew resists the sun and,

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.260
being in shade,
is little dispersed,

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.239
my Master gently laid both
hands outspread on the grass.

00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:33.827
I, therefore,
aware of his purpose reached

00:38:33.827 --> 00:38:36.480
toward him my tear-stained
cheeks."

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.445
That's the ritual of
purification which he,

00:38:40.445 --> 00:38:43.090
the pilgrim,
must undergo.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:43.414
"..
 

00:38:43.414 --> 00:38:45.934
.and on them he wholly restored
the color which Hell had hidden

00:38:45.934 --> 00:38:46.300
in me.
 

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.905
We came then on the desert
shore that never saw men sail

00:38:49.905 --> 00:38:53.510
its waters, who after had
experience of return."

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.309
Whom are you suppose to
overhear here?

00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:57.349
What is the reference to?
 

00:38:57.349 --> 00:39:01.268
Anybody?
 

00:39:01.268 --> 00:39:06.253
Absolutely, he makes it very
clear that Cato and Ulysses are

00:39:06.253 --> 00:39:07.690
the two pagans.
 

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:13.353
There is a difference:
he intrudes--he insinuates a

00:39:13.353 --> 00:39:18.679
distinction within the body of
pagan culture.

00:39:18.679 --> 00:39:21.538
Ulysses, on the one hand,
and his own transgressive

00:39:21.538 --> 00:39:24.416
search for knowledge,
in the belief that really there

00:39:24.416 --> 00:39:26.360
is no knowledge without
transgression,

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.150
which is considerable and would
be worth considering,

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:35.429
and on the other hand,
the experience of Cato himself.

00:39:35.429 --> 00:39:38.239
Now we are here with a
different pagan.

00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:40.969
"There he girded me as the
other had bidden."

00:39:40.969 --> 00:39:43.840
That's a phrase that comes
straight out of Inferno XXVI.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.590
"O marvel!
 

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.389
for as was the lowly plant he
chose such did it spring up

00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:50.590
again immediately in the place
where he had plucked it."

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.322
So Dante has to gird himself
the way journeymen would

00:39:54.322 --> 00:39:57.840
whenever they undertake a
journey in antiquity.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.586
Whether it is the biblical
journeyman or the Romans--the

00:40:01.586 --> 00:40:04.789
gird--they put this girdle
around themselves.

00:40:04.789 --> 00:40:07.690
They gird their loins.
 

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:14.304
It's a moment of containment of
self and that's the ritual he

00:40:14.304 --> 00:40:16.179
has to undergo.
 

00:40:16.179 --> 00:40:20.793
From my point of view,
though, the emphasis falls on

00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:25.500
the power of the natural world
to restore itself,

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.541
because immediately--and there
is an emblem of the Resurrection

00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:30.507
here now,
but we're still in the natural

00:40:30.507 --> 00:40:30.829
world.
 

00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:35.404
There is no element of grace:
the nature of the plant--in an

00:40:35.404 --> 00:40:39.746
inversion of what had happened
in Inferno XIII--the plant

00:40:39.746 --> 00:40:42.460
is--rises again,
is born again.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.780
And now we come to Canto II.
 

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:51.112
The situation changes somewhat,
but let me just begin another

00:40:51.112 --> 00:40:55.445
point of--
it starts with another search

00:40:55.445 --> 00:40:59.360
for orientation and I mean that
in--

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.179
it's an easy pun.
 

00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:04.954
The east, the Orient,
and orientation for the pilgrim

00:41:04.954 --> 00:41:08.219
and now it becomes more clearly
Jerusalem,

00:41:08.219 --> 00:41:10.635
and we'll see the reason why
it's going to be Jerusalem,

00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:11.250
in a moment.
 

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.068
Well, one reason why,
let me just say it immediately

00:41:13.068 --> 00:41:14.530
because it has nothing to do
with the--

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.344
this has to do more with let's
say the myth rather than with

00:41:18.344 --> 00:41:22.041
the text,
is that Hell and that Purgatory

00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:25.340
is at the antipodes of
Jerusalem,

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.630
against the feet of Jerusalem.
 

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:33.163
Jerusalem was known as the
navel of the earth and now we

00:41:33.163 --> 00:41:37.590
are in its--in Purgatory at its
antipodes.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:40.710
It starts, "Already the
sun had reached the horizon,

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:42.210
whose meridian circle covers
Jerusalem,"

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.949
so Jerusalem will become the
point of reference,

00:41:43.949 --> 00:41:47.413
"with its highest point,
and night, circling opposite to

00:41:47.413 --> 00:41:49.076
it,
was issuing from the Ganges

00:41:49.076 --> 00:41:51.672
with the Scales,
which fall from her hand when

00:41:51.672 --> 00:41:53.309
she exceeds the day..."
 

00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.659
etc.
 

00:41:53.659 --> 00:41:55.976
"I was,
white with rosy cheeks of fair

00:41:55.976 --> 00:41:59.010
Aurora, with her increasing age,
were turning orange.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:04.445
We were still beside the sea,
like those that ponder on the

00:42:04.445 --> 00:42:09.039
road, who go in heart and in
body linger."

00:42:09.039 --> 00:42:15.356
An extraordinary image of this
location of being both being

00:42:15.356 --> 00:42:21.239
body and mind and aware of a
break between the two,

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.670
who have expectations and hopes
of moving ahead,

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:28.360
and yet, they are kept in place
by the heaviness of the body.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.588
"And lo as on the approach
of morning Mars grows ruddy

00:42:32.588 --> 00:42:37.329
through the thick vapors low in
the west over the ocean floor,

00:42:37.329 --> 00:42:39.889
so appeared to me--may I see it
again!--

00:42:39.889 --> 00:42:43.900
a light coming so swiftly over
the sea that no flight could

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.559
match its speed."
 

00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:50.208
Here he sees a boat,
a fast boat bringing,

00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:57.012
carrying the souls of penitents
who are reaching the banks of

00:42:57.012 --> 00:42:58.599
Purgatory.
 

00:42:58.599 --> 00:43:03.422
The very opposite of what we
saw with Charon's boat in Hell,

00:43:03.422 --> 00:43:05.467
the boat of,
you remember,

00:43:05.467 --> 00:43:07.429
of the sinful souls.
 

00:43:07.429 --> 00:43:11.240
And then an angel of God,
"Then as the divine bird

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.780
came towards us more and more,
he appeared brighter,

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.550
so that my eyes could not
bear," line 38,

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.829
"I cast them down and he
came on the shore with a vessel

00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:24.000
so swift and light that the
water took in nothing of it.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.911
On the poop stood the heavenly
steersman such that blessedness

00:43:27.911 --> 00:43:30.989
seemed written upon him,
and more than a thousand

00:43:30.989 --> 00:43:32.849
spirits sat within."
 

00:43:32.849 --> 00:43:37.739
And they sing a psalm,
"In exitu Israel de

00:43:37.739 --> 00:43:42.628
Aegypto"--Psalm,
according to the Vulgate,

00:43:42.628 --> 00:43:43.480
113.
 

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:53.070
It's the psalm in which the
Jews are remembering their

00:43:53.070 --> 00:44:01.576
exodus from the bondage,
the slavery in Egypt to

00:44:01.576 --> 00:44:04.110
Jerusalem.
 

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:06.159
That's really the story.
 

00:44:06.159 --> 00:44:08.523
This book of Exodus,
"In exitu Israel de

00:44:08.523 --> 00:44:09.530
Aegypto."
 

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.980
You understand retrospectively
the reference to Jerusalem that

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.469
gives a kind of unity to this
whole canto.

00:44:15.469 --> 00:44:22.650
It's a psalm that--there are a
number of things about this.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:28.670
It's the only text that Dante
sites, textually cites.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.570
He might make references to the
Bible all the time,

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.719
but the only text of the Bible
that Dante really cites

00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:36.980
literally and takes from
textually,

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.719
is always the Book of Psalms.
 

00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:43.130
Probably an acknowledgment that
it's poetry and that he responds

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:45.259
to that poetry;
but especially,

00:44:45.259 --> 00:44:48.643
he does so, not only because--
it's probably the text

00:44:48.643 --> 00:44:53.079
where--for the first time,
we have a representation of

00:44:53.079 --> 00:44:56.449
subjectivity in Western
countries.

00:44:56.449 --> 00:45:01.358
It's the story of someone who
is looking inward and finding

00:45:01.358 --> 00:45:04.657
out the diseases of self,
the appetites,

00:45:04.657 --> 00:45:06.518
the passions,
etc.

00:45:06.518 --> 00:45:09.677
That may be one reason,
since he's engaged in that kind

00:45:09.677 --> 00:45:12.134
of--he himself,
that pilgrim--is engaged in

00:45:12.134 --> 00:45:13.480
that sort of quest.
 

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:17.911
But there is another reason,
I believe, because the Psalms

00:45:17.911 --> 00:45:21.954
are basically lyrical
recapitulations of the story of

00:45:21.954 --> 00:45:22.809
Exodus.
 

00:45:22.809 --> 00:45:25.880
Dante's saying that Exodus is
the figure,

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:31.039
that the Divine Comedy is the
lyrical representation of the

00:45:31.039 --> 00:45:33.356
story,
the biblical story of Exodus,

00:45:33.356 --> 00:45:36.056
that he too--
that this human history is

00:45:36.056 --> 00:45:40.277
engaged in that search,
a search from slavery to

00:45:40.277 --> 00:45:41.150
liberty.
 

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:45.193
Let me just pursue this a
little bit, from another point

00:45:45.193 --> 00:45:45.929
of view.
 

00:45:45.929 --> 00:45:49.809
In Canto I of Purgatorio
we saw that it was a vision of

00:45:49.809 --> 00:45:51.909
Roman political,
moral liberty.

00:45:51.909 --> 00:45:55.992
Now we have an idea that the
whole of history is really

00:45:55.992 --> 00:45:59.849
engaged in this exodus,
a journey toward liberty.

00:45:59.849 --> 00:46:03.387
Two types of liberties:
a Roman one and a Jewish one,

00:46:03.387 --> 00:46:05.699
to which Dante wants to
connect.

00:46:05.699 --> 00:46:09.998
It is as if he understands that
there are two traditions,

00:46:09.998 --> 00:46:13.760
both of which are based on a
quest for liberty.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.570
That there is a sense of,
in both of them,

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:21.088
though in different ways,
a sense of beginning that he

00:46:21.088 --> 00:46:24.896
must try to harmonize,
he must try to explore and

00:46:24.896 --> 00:46:25.929
probe in depth.
 

00:46:25.929 --> 00:46:28.730
What do they mean and what are
they about?

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:33.409
One, a kind of legal idea,
moral, political idea of

00:46:33.409 --> 00:46:36.019
liberty--
Cato--that comes to the point

00:46:36.019 --> 00:46:38.237
of self-destruction,
and the other one,

00:46:38.237 --> 00:46:40.159
the question of spiritual
exodus.

00:46:40.159 --> 00:46:45.440
By the way, a second thing I
can say about this reference to

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.989
Psalm 113 is that Dante uses it
as the basis for explaining his

00:46:50.989 --> 00:46:52.780
use of allegory.
 

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.282
You remember that I spoke about
the allegory of poets and

00:46:56.282 --> 00:46:57.909
allegory of theologians?
 

00:46:57.909 --> 00:47:01.878
And that the difference was the
historical basis of the

00:47:01.878 --> 00:47:02.760
narrative?
 

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.547
The story of Exodus for Dante
is historically true:

00:47:06.547 --> 00:47:07.760
it's an event.
 

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.728
So this gives a kind of
biblical, figural aura to

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:16.193
Dante's representation--his
allegorical representation,

00:47:16.193 --> 00:47:17.268
at least.
 

00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:22.255
The third thing that I have to
say is that the story of Exodus

00:47:22.255 --> 00:47:25.853
in many ways
embodies--crystallizes the real,

00:47:25.853 --> 00:47:29.449
intellectual issues of
Purgatory.

00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:32.230
What is the story of Exodus
about?

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.750
The leaving behind the house of
bondage,

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.130
as they call it,
the house of bondage,

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:44.164
the taking along the gold of
the Egyptians which really means

00:47:44.164 --> 00:47:46.579
the secular knowledge.
 

00:47:46.579 --> 00:47:50.963
That secular knowledge is also
part of what we must carry with

00:47:50.963 --> 00:47:53.480
us in the journey toward
freedom.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.909
But it also means that they
stay in the desert;

00:47:56.909 --> 00:47:59.710
the Jews stay in the desert for
forty days.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.891
They feel that they're
abandoned by Moses who has come

00:48:03.891 --> 00:48:08.860
up to receive the tables of the
law, and while they're abandoned

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.070
they engage in idolatry.
 

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:15.329
This is the story of Exodus,
a story of a people caught

00:48:15.329 --> 00:48:18.800
between idolatry and revelation
and promises,

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.780
and prophetic promises;
prophesy and idolatry.

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:28.251
The idolatry shows itself as a
statement or as an experience of

00:48:28.251 --> 00:48:33.369
nostalgia: that's what the
making of the golden calf is.

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:37.219
A statement--a way
of--desperate as they may be,

00:48:37.219 --> 00:48:40.610
because they are now leaderless
and they will be for a while,

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:45.920
then they engage in an act of
desire,

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.713
a longing for at least the
safety or what they perceive as

00:48:49.713 --> 00:48:52.309
the safety of the dwelling in
Egypt,

00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:55.420
mindless of the fact that they
were in bondage.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.773
It is as if safety,
the safety of living were

00:48:58.773 --> 00:49:04.269
preferable to them even in--
if that is the safety provided,

00:49:04.269 --> 00:49:07.806
procured,
and in the shadow of tyranny,

00:49:07.806 --> 00:49:08.800
of bondage.
 

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.987
These are the concerns that
Dante will have as he comes into

00:49:12.987 --> 00:49:13.840
Purgatory.
 

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.141
The whole of Purgatorio is
literally a journey of a way of

00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:20.500
looking back and forth between
the future and the past,

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.751
and the future and the past are
rivaling with each other for the

00:49:24.751 --> 00:49:27.250
control of the mind of the
pilgrim.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:33.273
Let's see how this is going to
be developed and I hope I have

00:49:33.273 --> 00:49:36.907
time to go--
give you time for questions

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:40.818
because I'm really--
I realize that I am saying a

00:49:40.818 --> 00:49:45.101
lot of things and there are a
lot of things I'm not even

00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:45.880
saying.
 

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.577
The poem, the canto,
shifts from these grand

00:49:50.577 --> 00:49:55.219
historical concerns,
these reflections on how the

00:49:55.219 --> 00:49:59.480
pagan world experiences
beginnings and new departures,

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.760
only with an ideology of
freedom, and this idea,

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:09.452
biblical idea of a new
beginning which is really a

00:50:09.452 --> 00:50:16.195
break with slavery,
the retrieval of the idea of

00:50:16.195 --> 00:50:19.704
freedom in--
a general one,

00:50:19.704 --> 00:50:22.050
in a historical way.
 

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:24.905
Now it shifts,
the narrative shifts,

00:50:24.905 --> 00:50:27.190
and it's all internalized.
 

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.766
The pilgrim moves within
himself and the first statement

00:50:30.766 --> 00:50:34.280
is that he does not know where
he is and that's an--

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:39.806
that is to say a way of
alluding to this exilic

00:50:39.806 --> 00:50:42.329
predicament he has.
 

00:50:42.329 --> 00:50:44.989
He literally has--he does not
know where to go.

00:50:44.989 --> 00:50:49.719
He already had indicated that
his state of mind as that of one

00:50:49.719 --> 00:50:53.364
who with the mind keeps going
towards someplace,

00:50:53.364 --> 00:50:56.389
but with the body he's kept
behind.

00:50:56.389 --> 00:51:00.452
Remember that line which
clearly dramatizes this split

00:51:00.452 --> 00:51:04.746
with a kind of inner self
dislocation for the pilgrim and

00:51:04.746 --> 00:51:08.067
now he just is--
now in meeting these penitent

00:51:08.067 --> 00:51:10.864
souls,
who are as lost as he is,

00:51:10.864 --> 00:51:15.750
about the place and they all
ask him for directions.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.597
Which--where they are singing
"In exitu...

00:51:18.597 --> 00:51:21.878
" they're in the desert,
the desert--to be in the

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:22.559
desert.
 

00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:24.559
What is the desert?
 

00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:28.001
The desert where one is,
the desert if you don't know

00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:31.572
which way to go,
the desert is the unmapped

00:51:31.572 --> 00:51:35.230
space between Egypt,
typologically speaking,

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.340
and Jerusalem.
 

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.030
It's some space in between.
 

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.679
You have no roots;
you have no paths.

00:51:40.679 --> 00:51:43.331
There are no carvings or
markers left for you,

00:51:43.331 --> 00:51:44.630
and so they ask him.
 

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:46.320
Can you?
 

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.838
Lines 6 and following:
"If you know,

00:51:48.838 --> 00:51:51.420
show us the way to go to the
mountain.'

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:54.353
And Virgil answered,
'You think, perhaps we are

00:51:54.353 --> 00:51:57.989
acquainted with this place,
but we are strangers."

00:51:57.989 --> 00:52:01.885
That's what it means to be an
exile and that's what it means

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:05.449
to write this poetry of exile
that Dante will write.

00:52:05.449 --> 00:52:08.952
This Purgatorio is this
place of the desert,

00:52:08.952 --> 00:52:13.157
there is a spirituality even of
the desert, and certainly the

00:52:13.157 --> 00:52:15.820
statement of the exilic
condition.

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.820
We really don't belong here.
 

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:22.148
We are always displaced and
going somewhere else and the--at

00:52:22.148 --> 00:52:25.228
the basis of Dante's own
religious longing,

00:52:25.228 --> 00:52:28.090
there is the sense of
displacement.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.655
There is the sense of we are
somehow out of--that our hearts

00:52:31.655 --> 00:52:33.710
are out of where they should be.
 

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:36.110
"We came but now,
a little while before you,

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.965
by another road which was so
rough and hard that now the

00:52:39.965 --> 00:52:42.630
climb will seem to us as a
pastime.'

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:46.105
The souls, who had perceived
from my breathing that I was

00:52:46.105 --> 00:52:48.733
still in life,
turned pale with wonder,

00:52:48.733 --> 00:52:52.539
and as to a messenger who bears
an olive branch that people

00:52:52.539 --> 00:52:56.150
crowed to hear the news and no
one heeds the crush,

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:59.954
so every one of these fortunate
souls fixed his eyes on my face

00:52:59.954 --> 00:53:03.389
as if forgetting to go and make
themselves fair."

00:53:03.389 --> 00:53:06.262
Now he, Dante,
becomes the object of

00:53:06.262 --> 00:53:09.219
temptation for the penitent
souls.

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:12.806
They should be going somewhere,
they should be going up the

00:53:12.806 --> 00:53:15.590
mountain and yet,
they stop where they are.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:20.860
So another way of thinking
about forgetfulness and the

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.739
sense of a name,
of a place to reach.

00:53:24.739 --> 00:53:26.360
Let's see how this is developed.
 

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.268
"I saw one of them come
forward with so many--so much

00:53:29.268 --> 00:53:32.230
affection to embrace me that it
moved me to do the same.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:35.599
O empty shades,
except in semblances.

00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:38.422
Three times I clasped my hands
behind him, and as often brought

00:53:38.422 --> 00:53:39.559
them back to my breast.
 

00:53:39.559 --> 00:53:41.746
Wonder, I think,
was painted in my looks,

00:53:41.746 --> 00:53:44.206
at which the shade smiled and
drew back and I,

00:53:44.206 --> 00:53:46.119
following him,
pressed forward.

00:53:46.119 --> 00:53:48.760
Gently, he bade me stand;
then I knew who it was,

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.885
and begged me that he would
stay a little and talk with

00:53:51.885 --> 00:53:52.579
me."
 

00:53:52.579 --> 00:53:56.260
This little detail of the
embrace, the failed embrace,

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.900
is one of the three failed
embraces;

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.304
a way of acknowledging for the
pilgrim an asset knowledge that

00:54:03.304 --> 00:54:07.708
there really--the souls you have
no substantiality that we can

00:54:07.708 --> 00:54:08.429
grasp.
 

00:54:08.429 --> 00:54:12.166
This is the first,
and there will be two more that

00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:14.760
I will talk about as we proceed.
 

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.206
"He answered me,
"Even as I loved thee in

00:54:19.206 --> 00:54:23.030
my mortal flesh,
so do I love thee freed;

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:25.239
therefore I stay.
 

00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:28.190
But thou, why are thou on this
journey?

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:32.494
'My Casella.'"
Dante meets a friend from his

00:54:32.494 --> 00:54:36.521
youth, a musician,
a musician who probably had

00:54:36.521 --> 00:54:40.099
even set to music Dante's own
poetry.

00:54:40.099 --> 00:54:43.059
A man from Siena who clearly
has died.

00:54:43.059 --> 00:54:48.340
So it's to relieve the hardship
of the journey.

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:52.880
This is apparent:
a moment of indulgence,

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.708
a way of meeting with a friend,
a little pastoral interlude if

00:54:57.708 --> 00:55:01.635
you wish,
to break up the hardness of the

00:55:01.635 --> 00:55:06.050
desert and the implications of
that metaphor.

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:09.077
The world of,
not a quest but now a pause,

00:55:09.077 --> 00:55:12.327
the pause of reflection,
the pause of relief,

00:55:12.327 --> 00:55:16.170
and the aesthetic relief that
this can give him.

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.014
"My Casella,
to return another time,

00:55:19.014 --> 00:55:22.630
where I am I take this road;
but from thee how has so much

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:23.550
time been taken.'
 

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.507
And he said...
 

00:55:24.507 --> 00:55:28.409
'No wrong is done me,"
he explains how he got here.

00:55:28.409 --> 00:55:31.746
"And I:
'If a new law does not take

00:55:31.746 --> 00:55:37.050
from thee memory or practice of
the songs of love which used to

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:42.099
quiet all my longings,"
this clearly is a reflection on

00:55:42.099 --> 00:55:47.489
the power of aesthetics and on
the limits of aesthetics,

00:55:47.489 --> 00:55:50.260
"may it please thee to
refresh my soul with them for a

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.766
while,
which he so spent coming here

00:55:52.766 --> 00:55:54.199
with my body."
 

00:55:54.199 --> 00:55:58.568
And so Casella starts singing a
song which is a poem that Dante

00:55:58.568 --> 00:56:03.079
himself wrote and now he sets it
in music as he probably may have

00:56:03.079 --> 00:56:04.630
done in this life.
 

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:08.418
"Love that discourses to
me in my mind,' he began then,

00:56:08.418 --> 00:56:12.400
so sweetly, that the sweetness
sounds within me still."

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:17.371
Here sweetness is to be
understood as the attribute of

00:56:17.371 --> 00:56:19.059
musical harmony.
 

00:56:19.059 --> 00:56:21.826
I know the sweetness,
and I indicated this when

00:56:21.826 --> 00:56:27.045
talking about the gluttons,
it's always the language of the

00:56:27.045 --> 00:56:31.646
palate and the savoring,
a certain savoring that goes on

00:56:31.646 --> 00:56:32.710
with the gluttons.
 

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:36.132
Here it's really a musical
attribute: the quality of the

00:56:36.132 --> 00:56:36.630
sound.
 

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:40.744
And, "My Master and I and
these people who were with him

00:56:40.744 --> 00:56:44.929
seem as content as if nothing
else touched the mind of any.

00:56:44.929 --> 00:56:47.190
We were all rapt and attentive
to his notes,

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:50.483
when lo,"
Cato, "the venerable old

00:56:50.483 --> 00:56:52.463
man,
crying: 'What is this,

00:56:52.463 --> 00:56:53.579
laggard spirits?
 

00:56:53.579 --> 00:56:56.760
What negligence,
what delay is this?

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:00.713
Haste to the mountain to strip
you of the slough that allows

00:57:00.713 --> 00:57:03.260
not God to be manifest to
you."

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:09.920
Okay, so here is an aesthetic
enclosure.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:14.969
The poet listens to his own
song, with a little touch of

00:57:14.969 --> 00:57:19.873
narcissistic temptation,
that his Casella is playing up

00:57:19.873 --> 00:57:21.554
to him,
reassuring him,

00:57:21.554 --> 00:57:25.369
giving him a sense that this is
you and I know who you are.

00:57:25.369 --> 00:57:29.170
And they're all rapt and they
forget about the ascent and then

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.601
of course Cato comes,
the ethical voice,

00:57:31.601 --> 00:57:33.159
the voice of the law.
 

00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:36.663
So you may have a kind of--you
may even want to write about

00:57:36.663 --> 00:57:40.590
this scene as a sort of conflict
between aesthetics and ethics.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.130
How are they working against
each other?

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:47.666
One thing is clear here,
that Dante is forgetful of the

00:57:47.666 --> 00:57:52.789
real lesson that he has learned
in the encounter with Cato.

00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:56.210
It just happened that Cato
himself--

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:59.503
therefore he intervenes and his
anger is the anger of the

00:57:59.503 --> 00:58:01.119
teacher,
because he says,

00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:03.969
I just explained to you what
the problems are.

00:58:03.969 --> 00:58:09.309
Cato--Virgil had approached
Cato, who had hoped that Cato

00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:15.224
could be swayed by the memory of
the past and Cato had rejected

00:58:15.224 --> 00:58:17.989
the power of that memory.
 

00:58:17.989 --> 00:58:22.579
He--the affection even and the
pleasure of that memory.

00:58:22.579 --> 00:58:25.849
Dante comes in Canto II and
he's involved in--

00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:29.329
let's call it even an
idolatrous moment,

00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:32.456
the moment where he just
witnesses something that he has

00:58:32.456 --> 00:58:34.550
been making,
that he has built,

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:37.405
he has composed,
is taken in by it but

00:58:37.405 --> 00:58:41.869
essentially that has the power
to distract him from his own

00:58:41.869 --> 00:58:42.639
ascent.
 

00:58:42.639 --> 00:58:47.518
He has forgotten the reasons
why he is here in Purgatory and

00:58:47.518 --> 00:58:51.652
so the whole of Purgatorio
begins with the explicit

00:58:51.652 --> 00:58:55.623
statement about the importance
of new beginnings,

00:58:55.623 --> 00:58:57.360
new departures.
 

00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.844
The recognition that everything
new in the future can only come

00:59:01.844 --> 00:59:06.184
out of some sense of the past
and then the discovery that the

00:59:06.184 --> 00:59:09.123
past can interfere,
can intrude,

00:59:09.123 --> 00:59:14.840
and therefore the steady
process of a continuous quest,

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.217
that a continuous rethinking
opens up in front of the pilgrim

00:59:18.217 --> 00:59:19.400
and in front of us.
 

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:23.043
The interesting thing,
and here I stop,

00:59:23.043 --> 00:59:27.356
Cato uses one word:
what kind of negligence is

00:59:27.356 --> 00:59:28.219
this?
 

00:59:28.219 --> 00:59:30.159
You know what the word means?
 

00:59:30.159 --> 00:59:30.773
Negligence?
 

00:59:30.773 --> 00:59:32.000
We are all negligent.
 

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.239
What are we when we are
negligent?

00:59:34.239 --> 00:59:37.375
What does the word contain
since they were talking about

00:59:37.375 --> 00:59:39.940
beginnings with--when we talk
about etymology,

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.219
which is the language of
beginnings?

00:59:42.219 --> 00:59:49.070
Negligence means not to choose:
what Cato is reproaching Dante

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:53.164
and his guide,
and all the other souls,

00:59:53.164 --> 00:59:57.809
he's reproaching the power of
poetry to produce this

00:59:57.809 --> 01:00:00.360
atmosphere of non-choice.
 

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.094
And obliquely,
that's then what his ethics is,

01:00:04.094 --> 01:00:08.079
and we are always engaged in an
act of choice.

01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:13.090
He speaks from the perspective
of freedom which literature,

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:17.568
the poetic text that Dante
evokes, has the power to tame

01:00:17.568 --> 01:00:19.670
and somehow,
for a moment,

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.500
at least here,
neutralize.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.858
You see the extraordinary
degree of self-reflection and

01:00:24.858 --> 01:00:28.280
self-reflexiveness of Dante,
from all points of view.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.976
Let me stop and see if there
are questions and I hope to be

01:00:32.976 --> 01:00:37.755
able to answer some of these
elements in the introduction of

01:00:37.755 --> 01:00:38.969
Purgatorio.
 

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.030
Yes?
 

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.375
Student:
In the beginning of Canto I

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:54.445
when he talks about leaving
behind her so cluelessly and

01:00:54.445 --> 01:00:57.461
he's talking about the bark of
his intellect leaving...

01:00:57.461 --> 01:01:00.588
Prof: The bark of his
wit, it's called in English,

01:01:00.588 --> 01:01:01.260
yes.
 

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.170
Student:
His wit--is it also a reference

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:10.099
to past poetry and the epic
tradition, because I read it as

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:14.349
sort of he's looking behind
Inferno, but it is also

01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:19.534
reference to how he's leaving
behind and excelling a past epic

01:01:19.534 --> 01:01:20.385
tradition?
 

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:24.550
Prof: The question is,
the metaphor,

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:27.822
at the beginning of
Purgatorio when the poet

01:01:27.822 --> 01:01:31.159
says that he's leaving behind
such a cruel sea,

01:01:31.159 --> 01:01:34.400
that cruel sea seems to be--and
is,

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.570
actually, we can agree easily,
a reference to Inferno,

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:42.385
but then the question is,
can it be also a reference to

01:01:42.385 --> 01:01:44.010
past epic traditions?
 

01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:45.956
It could be,
but you would have to be a

01:01:45.956 --> 01:01:48.159
little more specific about what
you mean.

01:01:48.159 --> 01:01:51.701
You mean the Odyssey for
instance, or the Aeneid,

01:01:51.701 --> 01:01:53.030
journeys by sea.
 

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:59.295
Dante is--the Divine Comedy is
constantly imbricated with these

01:01:59.295 --> 01:02:00.710
other poems.
 

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:05.860
And in fact,
the great poem that he recalls,

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:09.550
a past epic tradition is Lucan
and he chooses Lucan,

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:14.949
because Lucan is--so I'm coming
back to your question and trying

01:02:14.949 --> 01:02:18.119
to welcome it and say that
indeed,

01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:20.474
it's possible,
but I have to explain why I

01:02:20.474 --> 01:02:21.739
think it's possible.
 

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:27.831
Lucan's Pharsalia is a unique
text, in the epic tradition,

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:34.349
because it deliberately places
itself as a historical work.

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:39.750
The polemic of Lucan towards
Virgil is that Virgil--

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:43.117
sure he had been talking about
the foundation of Rome and for

01:02:43.117 --> 01:02:46.260
the Roman there is nothing more
historical than that--

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.750
as you know,
the Romans are the--some

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:51.239
practical people that will
count--

01:02:51.239 --> 01:02:55.880
will calculate history from the
foundation of the city.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.789
There's never a scheme about
the Garden of Eden,

01:02:59.789 --> 01:03:04.199
or Bede who starts writing
about unknown events in the

01:03:04.199 --> 01:03:06.030
past, or whatever.
 

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:10.349
The Roman starts with the
foundation of the city,

01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.980
Livy.
 

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.748
So Virgil writes about the
origin of Rome and from that

01:03:14.748 --> 01:03:17.679
point of view,
he's a historical author.

01:03:17.679 --> 01:03:21.802
He mixes his historical
accounts as so much myth making

01:03:21.802 --> 01:03:26.306
that Lucan rejects that form of
poetry and he writes an epic

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:28.139
about the civil war.
 

01:03:28.139 --> 01:03:31.750
Lucan writes about Caesar and
Pompey,

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:34.992
which clearly is a way of
adumbrating another more

01:03:34.992 --> 01:03:38.389
pressing civil war,
that between Antony and

01:03:38.389 --> 01:03:43.536
Augustus, and alluding to the
one between Sulla and Marias and

01:03:43.536 --> 01:03:48.516
the whole sequel of civil wars
that had punctuated and given

01:03:48.516 --> 01:03:52.143
its--
it's the quality,

01:03:52.143 --> 01:03:58.369
the distinctiveness of Roman
history.

01:03:58.369 --> 01:04:03.369
In a way, I would say that
Dante is rejecting a certain

01:04:03.369 --> 01:04:08.833
type of epic poetry that deals
with some kind of generalized

01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:11.150
metaphorical account.
 

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:14.150
Though for instance,
he's going to be Jason;

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:15.510
he's going to be Aeneas.
 

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:17.230
Now we have to keep that in
mind.

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:21.210
It would be a turn to,
at least in Canto I,

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.443
a turn toward a historical
world, a way of making

01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:26.869
Purgatory part of
history,

01:04:26.869 --> 01:04:29.650
because that's really the
secret of Purgatory.

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:32.389
Purgatorio began by
saying that it's part of human

01:04:32.389 --> 01:04:33.809
geography, do you remember?
 

01:04:33.809 --> 01:04:37.271
But not of human history:
Dante wants to make it part of

01:04:37.271 --> 01:04:38.280
human history.
 

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.768
We really can't go back to the
Garden of Eden,

01:04:41.768 --> 01:04:48.134
if not directly through some
reconstruction and shadowy

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:52.157
refiguration,
something that looks like the

01:04:52.157 --> 01:04:54.739
well being of the Garden of
Eden,

01:04:54.739 --> 01:04:57.050
something like a--not really
utopia,

01:04:57.050 --> 01:05:01.949
but something that can approach
the order of the Garden of Eden.

01:05:01.949 --> 01:05:05.579
I must have confused you with
this answer and if so--good,

01:05:05.579 --> 01:05:07.679
thank-you, well,
of course not.

01:05:07.679 --> 01:05:11.146
I think that I was going five
different directions and I

01:05:11.146 --> 01:05:12.469
apologize if I did.
 

01:05:12.469 --> 01:05:13.380
Yes?
 

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.927
Student:
In the beginning,

01:05:14.927 --> 01:05:17.682
you were talking about how the
journey of poetry is really

01:05:17.682 --> 01:05:20.681
important, and so if poetry has
the power too you can work your

01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:22.228
way to
&gt;,

01:05:22.228 --> 01:05:25.177
and then you were just talking
about how aesthetics can get in

01:05:25.177 --> 01:05:27.304
the way and how that poetry can
have a mutual

01:05:27.304 --> 01:05:28.514
&gt;
 

01:05:28.514 --> 01:05:28.851
effect.
 

01:05:28.851 --> 01:05:31.753
Can you just talk a little bit
more about the tension what he

01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:34.800
thinks the proper role of poetry
should be, what was it--let you

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.266
act and the community towards
action and then what's

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:38.523
&gt;.
 

01:05:38.523 --> 01:05:40.844
Prof: Yes,
great question and the question

01:05:40.844 --> 01:05:44.532
is,
that I was--I began by talking

01:05:44.532 --> 01:05:49.139
today about the journey of
poetry and really ended with the

01:05:49.139 --> 01:05:53.429
idea of the danger of poetry
that aesthetics have--

01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:58.775
confrontation that the poet
Dante has with a poet of his own

01:05:58.775 --> 01:05:59.500
youth.
 

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.181
So what gives about this
tension since I'm talking about

01:06:03.181 --> 01:06:05.860
a tension between two modes of
poetry.

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:09.780
I claim on the one hand that
poetry is for Dante a way of

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.929
knowing and then here seems to
get in the way,

01:06:12.929 --> 01:06:14.679
a scandal in a sense.
 

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.460
It really stumble--makes him
stumble.

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:24.289
What is this--the connection
between these two forms?

01:06:24.289 --> 01:06:27.018
That is really a great question.
 

01:06:27.018 --> 01:06:30.722
I think that Dante understands
that, first of all,

01:06:30.722 --> 01:06:34.199
let me just give him a great
deal of credit.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:39.273
By the time Dante writes,
poetry was still by and large a

01:06:39.273 --> 01:06:43.532
little game that the
Provençal poets were

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:48.789
playing in the courts of
Provence and northern Italy,

01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:52.639
were little games about secret
love stories,

01:06:52.639 --> 01:06:58.643
little games about hunting,
etc., or the great poems of the

01:06:58.643 --> 01:07:02.539
so-called Goliards,
the gluttonous ones,

01:07:02.539 --> 01:07:04.079
the belly worship.
 

01:07:04.079 --> 01:07:08.199
Dante comes along and says,
no, this vernacular poetry can

01:07:08.199 --> 01:07:12.393
really become the medium for
knowing everything that we can

01:07:12.393 --> 01:07:15.139
humanly can know about
ourselves,

01:07:15.139 --> 01:07:18.860
about God and about all the
things that we can--

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.525
we believe in and the things
that we would like to believe

01:07:21.525 --> 01:07:21.760
in.
 

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.429
All the hopes and defeats that
we have, so that's the great

01:07:25.429 --> 01:07:26.760
idea what it means.
 

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.677
From that point of view,
Dante engages poetry within

01:07:29.677 --> 01:07:32.880
this circle of knowledge,
of what I call the encyclopedic

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.309
compass of knowledge.
 

01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:37.592
So he involves all the
sciences, but at the same time,

01:07:37.592 --> 01:07:40.753
you ask me to think about that
dialectic, one is not

01:07:40.753 --> 01:07:42.860
conceivable without the other.
 

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:46.279
In order to really know,
the first thing that poetry has

01:07:46.279 --> 01:07:48.579
to do is show that it knows
itself.

01:07:48.579 --> 01:07:53.577
Usually the way--the reason why
poetry is treated as a lowly

01:07:53.577 --> 01:07:58.744
art, because it's meretricious,
it doesn't--it gives itself to

01:07:58.744 --> 01:07:59.929
everybody.
 

01:07:59.929 --> 01:08:04.144
I'm saying all of this because
the scene of Canto II really

01:08:04.144 --> 01:08:05.889
recalls a great scene.
 

01:08:05.889 --> 01:08:07.639
We haven't got time to go into
that.

01:08:07.639 --> 01:08:11.963
It recalls another great scene
and I think that Dante's really

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:15.579
rethinking the famous opening
scene of Boethius,

01:08:15.579 --> 01:08:18.252
The Consolation of Philosophy,
which I don't know if you have

01:08:18.252 --> 01:08:19.739
read,
but I have mentioned it,

01:08:19.739 --> 01:08:20.399
but you will.
 

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:24.369
You look like someone who would
go to the library now and pick

01:08:24.369 --> 01:08:27.300
up the--it's really a book--no
I'm serious.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:31.170
It's really a book where the
philosopher is sick in bed.

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:34.470
He is--he does not know he's
diseased.

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:38.171
In order to find comfort he
picks up a book of poetry,

01:08:38.171 --> 01:08:39.710
the muses go to him.
 

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.978
It's a book of poetry which
probably is what most people

01:08:42.978 --> 01:08:44.819
would do if they got the flu.
 

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:47.060
It's time to read good poetry,
right?

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:52.552
Then all of a sudden,
Lady Philosophy appears and

01:08:52.552 --> 01:08:56.994
banishes these muses,
get thee hence you harlots,

01:08:56.994 --> 01:08:59.734
he calls them,
of the theatre because you

01:08:59.734 --> 01:09:03.436
don't give any real remedy,
you just only provide

01:09:03.436 --> 01:09:05.118
provisional solace.
 

01:09:05.118 --> 01:09:09.101
What Dante is doing is--the
whole of the Boethius is

01:09:09.101 --> 01:09:12.460
philosophy is really better than
poetry,

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:16.489
a way of recasting the old
Platonic quarrel as we know from

01:09:16.489 --> 01:09:20.229
even the Republic,
right, between--the debate

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:22.948
between poetry and philosophy.
 

01:09:22.948 --> 01:09:26.564
What Dante is doing is--no,
no, poetry may have these

01:09:26.564 --> 01:09:30.319
dangerous temptations and
possibilities but that's what

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:33.380
makes it part of its own
self-knowledge.

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:37.641
I want to--I cannot guarantee
or promise that poetry will lead

01:09:37.641 --> 01:09:40.682
you to knowledge,
unless I show that the medium

01:09:40.682 --> 01:09:42.546
that I use,
knows itself,

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:45.149
it knows its own temptations.
 

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:48.439
It knows its own meretricious
possibilities,

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:50.430
you see what I'm saying?
 

01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:54.363
It always accompanies one--he
says, you want me to highlight

01:09:54.363 --> 01:09:57.430
the reasons of that dialectic,
that tension.

01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:01.226
And the only answer that I can
give is that one flanks the

01:10:01.226 --> 01:10:04.243
other constantly,
so that the voice of Cato and

01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:08.481
the voice of Casella there,
at the same time they belong,

01:10:08.481 --> 01:10:12.971
necessarily belong together in
the unfolding and the

01:10:12.971 --> 01:10:16.229
articulation of Dante's own
voice.

01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:18.436
This is--you cannot expect to
have one say,

01:10:18.436 --> 01:10:21.485
well then if this is really
dangerous, can I have something

01:10:21.485 --> 01:10:21.960
else?
 

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.189
No it's not either-or,
it's both-and.

01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:29.377
The either-or,
the ethical or aesthetic and

01:10:29.377 --> 01:10:34.159
ethical, as if there were two
opposed forms just will not do.

01:10:34.159 --> 01:10:40.770
Okay, other questions?
 

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.127
I wish you had another hour
here, so that I could really

01:10:48.127 --> 01:10:52.930
talk about some of these details
in the beginning of the poem.

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:55.885
Well since I hear none--no
other questions,

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:56.729
thank you.
 

01:10:56.729 --> 01:10:57.539
See you next time.

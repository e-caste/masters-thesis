00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.390
- So today, we're starting
in part three of the course

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.073
which I call the end
of the end of history.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.550
And the end of the end
of history harken back to

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.160
the book, "The End of History"
that we talked about earlier.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.160
What was this idea that democracy
and liberal institutions

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.980
and market capitalism had
come to the world to stay,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.590
was embodied in the
neoliberal consensus at home

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.120
and the Washington Consensus abroad.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.500
And as I have said several times,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.670
I'm calling this the early
post Cold War period.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.280
And so when I talk about the
end of the end of history,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.787
when did the end of the end
of history happen in the US?

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:01.950
And the truth is it
didn't happen all at once

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.740
and it was a bit like turning around

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.645
a massive ocean liner at sea.

00:01:07.645 --> 00:01:12.160
I would say that in the full consciousness

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.885
of mainstream elites,

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:16.106
it really ended with a bang

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:20.260
with the election of Donald Trump in 2016.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.260
Even after Brexit, many people in America

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.530
didn't think that was heralding something

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.330
that might be happening here.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.691
So I think that, but
then when that happened,

00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.100
I think people started to realize

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.380
we were living in a different world

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.211
than the comfortable world
or the end of history

00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:45.060
that we had come to identify.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.640
But if you want to say when
did it really start ending

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.450
as opposed to when did
people realize it was ending,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.162
I think that there was
a kind of bifurcation.

00:01:57.162 --> 00:02:00.003
At home, it really starts,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.570
I've dated it to the collapse

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.160
of Lehman Brothers on
September 15th of 2008

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.940
which was the beginning
of the financial crisis

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.490
which was gonna have huge knock on effects

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.240
for America's place in the global economy,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.290
for the Washington Consensus.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.313
There was gonna be this big retreat.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.790
Russia and China,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.470
as we're gonna talk about
this time next week,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.882
would fill a big part of the void

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:33.210
as the Washington Consensus went home

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.830
or as the purveyors of the
Washington Consensus went home

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.000
and the consensus itself
started to disintegrate.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.470
We started hearing about
the Beijing consensus,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.370
and of alternative
development models, and so on.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.370
So I think that was the beginning
of the collapse at home.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.380
Abroad, when we think about geopolitics

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.290
rather than economics,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.160
really it begins with,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.867
I've dated it to the day
before the invasion of Iraq,

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:11.550
so March 19th 2003,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.740
because I think that was
probably the high point

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.740
of American global geopolitical
influence in the world

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.990
for reasons that I'll talk about today.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.300
So a little taking stock.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.510
The Cold War had been won first of all

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.061
at a surprisingly low cost.

00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:37.740
The Soviet Union had knelt down and died.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.444
There was no big war.

00:03:39.444 --> 00:03:43.110
It was a fairly peaceful transition

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.640
and in terms of blood and treasure,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.634
much less than people
might have anticipated.

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:53.960
The 1990s and early 200s as I've just said

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.550
were the heyday of the
Washington Consensus

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.040
and democracy seemed to be on the march.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.913
To remind you of a statistic
I told you about earlier,

00:04:03.757 --> 00:04:06.140
at the turn of the 21st century

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.940
for the first time in human history,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.727
there were more democracies in the world

00:04:10.727 --> 00:04:12.463
than non-democracies.

00:04:12.463 --> 00:04:15.553
So there's a lot of confidence in that.

00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:20.553
9/11 gave the US huge leeway
to act internationally.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.540
There was a very broad perception

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.540
that we had been a victim of
an justified terrorist attack,

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.480
not universal, but
extremely broad consensus

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.030
that the US certainly was going to do

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.510
what was necessary to chase down

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.950
the terrorists that had attacked us

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.603
and nobody was gonna
second guess that move

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.670
that we began in Afghanistan,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.800
even if as it turned out later,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.270
there were pause not taken

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.423
and things that might have
been done differently.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.730
But it was a time of
unprecedented self confidence

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.080
in America's capacity to shape the world.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.599
And perhaps this video of George W. Bush

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.467
on the 1st of May 2003 encapsulates

00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:21.467
that self confidence about
as well as anybody could.

00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:25.720
(engine rumbling)

00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:35.054
(faint speaking)

00:05:53.564 --> 00:05:55.731
(fanfare)

00:05:57.005 --> 00:06:00.890
- In the outlaw regime that
has ties to terrorist groups

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.440
and seeks or possesses
weapons of mass destruction

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.620
is a great danger to the civilized world

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.203
and will be confronted.

00:06:10.048 --> 00:06:13.215
(audience applauding)

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.410
We've begun the search for hidden chemical

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.314
and biological weapons,

00:06:18.314 --> 00:06:21.170
and already know of hundreds of sites

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.000
that will be investigated.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.950
Thanks, we like it.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.300
Yeah, fantastic.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.902
The transition from dictatorship
to democracy will take time

00:06:29.902 --> 00:06:32.113
but it is worth every effort.

00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:37.863
Our coalition will stay
until our work is done.

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:39.722
(faint speaking)

00:06:39.722 --> 00:06:41.972
(laughing)

00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:48.304
- So that sums it up

00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:52.993
and another remarkable
statement of this was,

00:06:53.962 --> 00:06:58.440
this was a comment made by an
anonymous White House aide.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.970
Turned out later to be Karl Rove

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.543
to Ron Suskind, the journalist.

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:08.650
In October of 2004,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.150
he had been complaining about a story

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.720
that Suskind had written
about Karen Hughes

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.293
who had been the White
House Press Secretary.

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:22.277
So Rove said to Suskind,

00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:24.157
"You people seem to think

00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:27.137
"that we have to start with reality,

00:07:27.137 --> 00:07:29.487
"but we're an empire now and when we act,

00:07:29.487 --> 00:07:31.427
"we create our own reality.

00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:33.917
"And while you're studying that reality,

00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:35.977
"judiciously as you will,

00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:39.087
"we'll act again creating
other new realities

00:07:39.087 --> 00:07:40.947
"which you can study too,

00:07:40.947 --> 00:07:42.907
"and that's how things will sort out.

00:07:42.907 --> 00:07:45.257
"We are history's actors,

00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:50.257
"and you, all of you, will
be left to study what we do."

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.573
Right?

00:07:54.676 --> 00:07:59.230
It's hard to say anything
stronger than that

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.230
about confidence in America's
capacity to shape reality.

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:09.662
And just again to make the contrast,

00:08:09.662 --> 00:08:14.662
let's go back and see what
George W. Bush was saying

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.887
about US global strategic
ambitions and practices

00:08:19.887 --> 00:08:23.603
three years earlier when he
was running for the presidency.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.220
- Are we gonna step up
to the plate as a nation

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.610
the way we did after World War II,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.747
the way that generation of heroes said,

00:08:31.747 --> 00:08:35.890
"Okay, the United States
is gonna be the leader."

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.820
And the world benefited tremendously

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.270
from the courage that they
showed in those post war years.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.885
- I'm not so sure the
role of the United States

00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:43.750
is to go around the world

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.280
and say this is the way it's gotta be

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.610
'cause I am worried about

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.850
overcommitting our
military around the world.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.880
I want to be judicious in its use.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.050
I just don't think it's the
role of the United States

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.967
to walk into a country and say,

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:56.710
"We do it this way, so should you."

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.010
If we're an arrogant
nation, they'll resent us.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.640
If we're a humble nation but strong,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.450
they'll welcome us.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.820
And our nation stands alone right now

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.846
in the world in terms of power,

00:09:09.846 --> 00:09:12.050
and that's why we've got to be humble.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.720
If we're an arrogant nation,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.320
they'll view us that way,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.157
but if we're a humble
nation, they'll respect us.

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.350
And so I don't our troops oughta be used

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.850
for what's called nation building.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.700
I think what we need to
do is convince people

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.410
who live in the lands they
live to build the nations.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.180
Maybe I'm missing something here.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.910
I mean, we're gonna have kind
of a nation building core.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.890
I'm concerned that we're
over-deployed around the world.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.070
I don't want to be the world's policeman.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.420
And the exit strategy
needs to be well defined.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.630
- So what we see between
that speech in 2000

00:09:47.338 --> 00:09:50.729
or those various clips from 2000

00:09:50.729 --> 00:09:55.729
and the speech I showed
you last time from Rumsfeld

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.880
and the mission accomplished
speech and Rove's attitude

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.130
is a more or less complete take over

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.540
of the Republican administration

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.540
by the neoconservative wing
of the Republican party.

00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:14.980
Now, I have talked about neoliberalism

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.810
and the Washington Consensus,

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.500
neoliberalism being the
commitment to the trifecta

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.500
of low regulation, free
trade, and privatization,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.040
but I haven't talked about

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.260
neoconservatism yet in this course

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.830
and I'm here talking about today

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.650
the demise of the neoconservative dream,

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.330
but we need to be clear on

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.976
well, who were the neoconservatives

00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:46.865
and what was their dream that demised

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:49.510
or came to its demise?

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.510
So here's some reflections
by Irving Kristol

00:10:55.150 --> 00:11:00.150
who is widely known as the
godfather of neoconservatism.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:03.920
- [Interviewer] Irving Kristol,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.853
author of "The Autobiography
of an Idea: Neoconservatism."

00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:11.703
When was the first time you
ever heard that word uttered?

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.460
- It must have been some
time in the mid 1970s.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.680
It was not my term.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.420
I did not invent it.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.340
I believe it was invented by
someone who was criticizing me

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.897
and I thought that that
was a term of a (mumbles).

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.250
I decided that it was a
pretty good description

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.050
of in fact what I was
thinking and feeling,

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.710
so I ran with it.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.443
- [Interviewer] What does it mean?

00:11:36.443 --> 00:11:38.300
- What it means is that

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.570
it refers to a constellation
of opinions and views

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.480
that is not traditionally conservative,

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.270
but is conservative, and
is certainly not liberal.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.970
Things, particularly
intellectual political things,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.900
intellectual and political ideas

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.870
were more in flux in the 1970s

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.690
than either before or after.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.993
That was the decade of transition
so far as I was concerned.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.175
In 1968, I still voted
for Hubert Humphrey,

00:12:13.175 --> 00:12:18.175
but by 1974, I realized I was
going to become a Republican.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.500
And by that time, the term
neoconservatism had been invented

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.550
and I decided I was
also a neoconservative.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.060
- You say that you've been a neo-Marxist,

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.410
a neo-Trotskyist, a
neosocialist, a neoliberal,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.083
and finally, a neoconservative.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.006
- That pretty much phrases

00:12:39.006 --> 00:12:42.963
the trajectory of my political beliefs.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.560
I've never been comfortable
with any of those doctrines

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.643
because I always saw problems
inherent in those doctrines.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.860
Those who would 10 years ago

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.470
have been called neoconservatives

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.130
these days simply call
themselves conservatives.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.913
The conservative movement
has expanded to include us.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.100
- So there it is.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.963
Now you know what neoconservatism was.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.190
In fact, you can watch
that entire interview

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.713
from which I excerpted three minutes

00:13:19.713 --> 00:13:22.260
and still not be able to glean.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.242
You can glean what it wasn't,

00:13:24.242 --> 00:13:27.843
but it's very hard to get
a sense of what it was.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.350
But he nonetheless tells us

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.740
a couple of important
things about neoconservatism

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.623
that I think give clues to what it was.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.560
To start at the end,

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.970
it was clearly something
that had gone mainstream

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.020
by the time he was talking in 1995.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.100
So as he said, people were no longer

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.590
talking about neoconservatism as different

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.340
from mainstream conservatism by then.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.020
But then the second clue is
his own personal history.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.940
He started out on the left actually

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.550
as a kind of Trotskyist
critic of the Soviet Union

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.210
before World War II.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.410
As information was coming out on the left,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.361
people like the Webbs
and others in the UK,

00:14:12.361 --> 00:14:17.361
there started to be a left
critique of the Soviet Union.

00:14:20.472 --> 00:14:24.630
The people who ultimately
became the neoconservatives

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.780
sometimes were called liberal hawks.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.780
And they very much, another
one much later actually,

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.850
people called Christopher
Hitchens a neoconservative

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.285
for his support for the Iraq War.

00:14:39.285 --> 00:14:41.683
So it had a long lineage

00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:46.683
and its roots were in the pre World War II

00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:50.770
criticism of the USSR.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.890
And in the '60s and '70s,

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.980
it was fueled by people,

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.610
a lot of whom had started out

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.650
in the sort of Scoop Jackson Democrats

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.680
who didn't like the peace movement,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.910
didn't like the peace nix.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.150
They didn't like the new
left, didn't like the '60s,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.900
and all of that.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.480
And they tended to ally themselves

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.480
with the proponents of rollback
in various administrations,

00:15:20.943 --> 00:15:23.850
so in Republican administrations,

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.540
and they certainly were a lot
closer to Nixon's policies

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:34.590
than they were to the Democrats
who came subsequently.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.630
So they were for aggressive
prosecution of the Cold War,

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:45.515
staunchly anti-communist
and anti-socialist.

00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:47.990
In the post Cold War period,

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.190
of course, like everyone else,

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.460
the neoconservatives were rethinking

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.937
what their views should
be in this new world

00:15:57.937 --> 00:16:01.960
since their sort of
raison d'etre for decades

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.590
had been virulent anti-communism

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.068
and communism for all practical
purposes had gone away.

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:13.160
And this is when the
neoconservatives I think

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.290
started to differentiate themselves

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.810
from other conservatives,

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.384
certainly from libertarian conservatives

00:16:20.384 --> 00:16:24.330
and people who were
subsequently critics of theirs

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.320
come to be called paleoconservatives

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.670
or to call themselves paleoconservatives

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.910
'cause they didn't like being identified

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.780
with the neoconservative label.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.810
And the distinctive feature

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:42.000
of the post Cold War
neoconservatives were two, I think.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.280
One is that they wanted

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.320
to spread democracy around the world.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.320
They were interested in knocking
off non-democratic regimes,

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:55.050
but they also didn't doubt for a second

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.519
that democratic regimes
would be pro-American.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.875
So they really were if you like,

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:06.280
we might say today drinking the Kool Aid

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.950
of the early post Cold War consensus,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.501
but they thought that installing democracy

00:17:14.501 --> 00:17:19.152
in the Middle East or anywhere else

00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:22.020
would automatically produce regimes

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.470
that were friendly to the US.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.023
And indeed, just to give
two illustrations of that.

00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:31.950
One of the justifications
for the invasion of Iraq

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.343
was that it would be a
positive domino process.

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:39.635
We would democratize Iraq

00:17:39.635 --> 00:17:43.910
and we would get a friendly
western style regime there

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.384
and then that would have
knock on effects either.

00:17:46.384 --> 00:17:50.022
And partly because that didn't happen,

00:17:50.022 --> 00:17:54.260
there was huge pressure to
conduct elections in Lebanon

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.570
even though all the
experts were telling them

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.950
it would actually strengthen the position

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.900
of the anti-American militias.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.530
Or you can see in 2005 and six,

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:11.530
they pushed strongly for elections
in the West Bank and Gaza

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:17.950
and were stunned when Hamas
won the elections in Gaza.

00:18:18.324 --> 00:18:21.550
So there'd been this expectation.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.450
Not only is it easy to implant democracy,

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.700
but democracies will tend to
see the US as a benign force

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.400
and will be pro-American.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.690
And they were people like Eliot Abrams,

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.837
Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz,

00:18:35.837 --> 00:18:39.663
and Cheney who had been
the defense secretary

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.830
in George Herbert Walker
Bush's administration

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.190
and would come back with George W. Bush,

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.140
and of course, Donald Rumsfeld.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.510
And if you want to find a defining example

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.310
of neoconservative thinking,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.458
it's this document published in 1995

00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:07.127
called "From Containment
to Global Leadership:

00:19:07.127 --> 00:19:10.830
"America and the World
After the Cold War,"

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.830
written by this man Khalizad
who is currently by the way

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.940
Pompeo's envoy to Afghanistan

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.860
and he served in multiple administrations

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.340
in various capacities,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.640
but he produced this document in 1995

00:19:27.015 --> 00:19:31.360
basically in which he said
in the post Cold War era,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.210
America's got three
options geopolitically.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.004
It can go back to isolationism.

00:19:38.004 --> 00:19:40.500
He called it neoisolationism.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.020
People like this neo word.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.170
I don't know what the difference

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.220
between neoisolationism and isolationism.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.727
One is you withdraw from the world

00:19:48.727 --> 00:19:51.128
and the other is you
withdraw from the world, but.

00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:54.128
(audience laughing)

00:19:55.642 --> 00:19:58.720
The other would be to go
back to pre World War II,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.120
a multi-polarity where it
was all about balancing,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.080
much of the sort of balancing

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.163
that had gone in even in
the 19th century in Europe.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.660
And he made a case that
both of those things

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.760
would be very bad for the US,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.760
and instead, we should take
a global leadership role,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.520
and this is the key
claim in the report was

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.430
or the document was that he advocated

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.614
that the use of force and even
preemptive war if necessary

00:20:32.614 --> 00:20:36.100
to preserve US global hegemony.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.898
And so this is what differentiated
the neoconservatives

00:20:39.898 --> 00:20:42.450
from other conservatives.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.840
And it was that document

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.070
that really became the forerunner

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:51.070
for the 2002 and 2006
national security strategies

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.830
that were embodied in the Bush doctrine

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.970
that we talked about last time.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.770
So that's the sort of main elements

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.490
of the neoconservative creed

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.093
and the history or the
biography of it, if you like.

00:21:08.762 --> 00:21:11.860
So intellectuals have ideas,

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.860
but how did they become
important in politics?

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:21.170
And as with the neoliberal views,

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.757
it goes back to think tanks.

00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:26.650
I mentioned to you when
we were talking about

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.260
the resurgence of the Republican right

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.733
that after the Nixon administration
fell apart in the 1970s,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.680
there was this emergence
of activist think tanks

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.530
who were committed not to
winning the next election,

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.825
but rethinking the conservative
agenda for the medium term

00:21:46.825 --> 00:21:51.825
funded by Fulner, Koch,
and others in places

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.466
like The Heritage Foundation,
The Cato Institute,

00:21:56.466 --> 00:21:59.547
and related conservative think tanks

00:21:59.547 --> 00:22:04.030
who were mostly interested
in domestic politics,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.289
particularly rolling back the frontiers

00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:08.170
of the welfare state.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.730
And they got their great moment in 1994

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.894
when the Republicans took over the house

00:22:13.894 --> 00:22:16.410
for the first time in four decades

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.630
and Newt Gingrinch set himself up

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.199
as a kind of prime
minister on Capitol Hill.

00:22:21.199 --> 00:22:23.060
Had Bill Clinton on the run

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.243
having lost the midterm elections badly.

00:22:26.243 --> 00:22:29.730
And that was the opening
and we've been through that,

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.360
the contract with America and all of that.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.070
But there was also a
geopolitical rethinking

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.853
among these people
we're talking about now,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.830
and I'm calling it the neoconservatives.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.660
And they were also in think tanks.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.320
Some of them in not particularly
partisan think tanks

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.780
like the Rand Corporation

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.070
which is where that document
I just read from came out,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.050
and the Council on Foreign Relations

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.860
which certainly billed
themselves as nonpartisan

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.013
even if many people saw them
as sort of right of center.

00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:13.750
But then places like the
American Enterprise Institute

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.710
which are sort of activist
conservative think tanks.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.780
People like Perle were there

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.111
and a number of the other neoconservatives

00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:25.470
spent a lot of time there.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.520
And then perhaps most
important was a new think tank

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.110
created in 1997 by Bill Kristol,

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.040
that's Irving Kristol's son,

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.610
and Robert Kagan, the son of our colleague

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.050
Professor Kagan here in
the history department.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.410
And the Project for a New American Century

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:51.260
was probably the prime
incubator of neoconservatism

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.026
and many people who subsequently wound up

00:23:55.026 --> 00:24:00.026
in the Bush administration
spent time there

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.563
were passing through these think tanks.

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:07.530
And really, 9/11 was their moment.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.500
9/11 was the moment at which they realized

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.140
that there was a huge vacuum

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.060
in thinking about US strategic policy

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.810
and they could go for it.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.980
And as I think I mentioned
to you last time,

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.460
by December of 2001,

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.830
I'm sorry, by December of 2000,

00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:39.641
there were already conversations going on,

00:24:39.721 --> 00:24:41.704
I'm sorry, 2001,

00:24:41.704 --> 00:24:43.083
December of 2001,

00:24:43.083 --> 00:24:45.520
there were already conversations
going on in the White House

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.903
as to when they could reallocate troops

00:24:49.903 --> 00:24:52.773
from Afghanistan to Iraq.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.220
Now, many people might say,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:01.220
well, why did anybody
really want to attack Iraq?

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.356
It seems something of a puzzle.

00:25:04.356 --> 00:25:08.311
The neoconservatives
had this view about it,

00:25:08.311 --> 00:25:11.220
but we really have to back into it

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.183
and look a little bit at the
historical background here.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.440
So after Saddam Hussein was
kicked out of Kuwait in 1991,

00:25:26.306 --> 00:25:29.390
I described the containment regime

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.700
that the Bush administration constructed

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.260
with the no fly zones and
oil for food and all of that

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:42.013
that was essentially meant
to hem Saddam Hussein in.

00:25:42.013 --> 00:25:45.263
They rejected regime change and so on.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:50.950
They rejected internally
externally imposed regime change,

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.920
but the George Herbert
Walker Bush administration

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.686
was by no means opposed to fomenting

00:25:57.686 --> 00:26:00.880
the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.340
just didn't want to commit
American troops to that.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.500
And indeed, one of the things

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.230
he was greatly criticized for at the time

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.530
was encouraging the Shiites in the south

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:13.340
and the Kurds in the north
to overthrow Saddam Hussein.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.917
But when they made those efforts,

00:26:15.917 --> 00:26:18.559
there was no US backup and support

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:22.450
and that led to the
slaughter of many of them

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:27.055
by the (mumbles) regime.

00:26:27.055 --> 00:26:32.055
And beyond that, the CIA
in the years following

00:26:32.977 --> 00:26:35.870
spent a lot of time and resources

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.328
working with opposition groups in Iraq

00:26:38.328 --> 00:26:42.860
and expatriate groups outside of Iraq

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.630
to try and engineer the
overthrow of that regime

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.120
even though it wouldn't involve

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.003
American boots on the ground.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.840
And indeed, there was the creation

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.130
of something called the
Iraqi National Congress

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.570
led by a man called Ahmed Chalabi

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.670
who was an Iranian expatriate

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.350
who had been living in London for decades.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:09.690
He hadn't been in Iraq
for a very long time.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.700
And he worked very closely with the CIA

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:18.100
and others to get
American indirect support

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.240
for overthrowing the Iraqi regime.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.740
They put together this
Iraqi National Congress

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.130
which was basically an
umbrella organization

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:30.590
to try and get all the opposition
groups in Iraq together

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:35.590
and figure out how to knock
off the Saddam Hussein regime.

00:27:37.246 --> 00:27:40.508
This was formed in 1992.

00:27:40.508 --> 00:27:44.620
By 1994, it was falling apart in acrimony.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.780
The two Kurd groups were fighting

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:51.542
over the control of different
parts of the country,

00:27:51.542 --> 00:27:54.403
mostly having to do with oil,

00:27:55.366 --> 00:27:57.100
and some of them were actually working

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.453
with Saddam Hussein's regime.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.790
Chalabi convinced the US
nonetheless to persist

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.790
with the kind of remnants of
the Iraqi National Congress

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:10.800
which he headed

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.993
and ultimately became a
political party in the new Iraq.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.800
And he convinced the US, the
Clinton administration in 1995,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.174
to sponsor an attempt at overthrowing,

00:28:26.174 --> 00:28:30.650
sort of Clinton's I guess
little under publicized,

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.181
but Clinton's kind of bay of pigs

00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:37.200
in that Chalabi predicted and promised

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.800
that as soon as this got going,

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.980
the Iraqi military would welcome it

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.030
and they would overthrow Saddam

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.023
and they would liberate Iraq.

00:28:48.023 --> 00:28:49.960
It was quickly put down.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.683
100 people were executed,
many more imprisoned,

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.180
but it didn't end the love affair

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.190
between the Clinton administration

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:03.870
and particularly the
neoconservatives in these think tanks

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:08.870
and Ahmed Chalabi who
constantly worked to raise money

00:29:09.161 --> 00:29:14.161
and to get support for
overthrowing the regime.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.937
However, the Clinton administration

00:29:17.937 --> 00:29:20.524
wasn't that interested in this.

00:29:20.524 --> 00:29:24.804
It was basically being dragged along

00:29:24.804 --> 00:29:29.804
by the conservatives who now
controlled congress after 1994.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:36.210
Clinton was basically enforcing
the containment regime

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.860
that his predecessor had put in place.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.050
So for example, in December of 1998,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.830
there were three days of
bombing Saddam Hussein

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.643
which he described as follows.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.363
- Three days ago,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.110
despite clear warnings
from the United States

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.360
and the international community,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.730
Iraqi forces attacked and seized

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.493
the Kurdish controlled city
of Erbil in Northern Iraq.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.580
Limited withdrawals announced by Iraq

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.680
do not change the reality.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.280
Saddam Hussein's army today controls Erbil

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.280
and Iraqi units remain
deployed for further attacks.

00:30:19.664 --> 00:30:22.630
These acts demand a strong response

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.740
and they have received one.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.890
Earlier today, I ordered
American forces to strike Iraq.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.680
Our missiles sent the following
message to Saddam Hussein.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.010
When you abuse your own people
or threaten your neighbors,

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.333
you must pay a price.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.210
Our objectives are limited, but clear,

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.260
to make Saddam pay his price

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.070
for the latest act of brutality,

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.458
reducing his ability to
threaten his neighbors

00:30:49.458 --> 00:30:52.190
and America's interests.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:56.100
First, we are extending the
no fly zone in Southern Iraq.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.034
This will deny Saddam
control of Iraqi airspace

00:30:59.034 --> 00:31:03.710
from the Kuwaiti border to the
southern suburbs of Baghdad

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:06.196
and significantly restrict Iraq's ability

00:31:06.196 --> 00:31:10.020
to conduct defensive
operations in the region.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.350
Second, to protect the
safety of our aircraft

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.800
enforcing this no fly zone,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.480
our cruise missile struck Saddam's

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.093
air defense capabilities in Southern Iraq.

00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:25.030
Saddam Hussein's objectives may change,

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.070
but his methods are always the same.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:32.300
Violence and aggression against the Kurds,

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:37.250
against other ethnic minorities,
against Iraq's neighbors.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.040
Our answer to that recklessness

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.220
must be strong and immediate.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.370
As President Bush demonstrated
in Operation Desert Storm,

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.090
as we showed two years ago

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.900
when Iraq mast its forces
on Kuwait's border,

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.590
and as we showed again today,

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.320
we must make it clear that
reckless acts have consequences

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.840
or those acts will increase.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.820
We must reduce Iraq's ability
to strike out at its neighbors

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.112
and we must increase America's ability

00:32:06.112 --> 00:32:08.653
to contain Iraq over the long run.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.090
- So there you see

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.852
he's speaking the language of containment.

00:32:13.852 --> 00:32:17.659
They called it aggressive containment.

00:32:17.659 --> 00:32:21.653
It was the sort of policy he's
talking about in that clip.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.680
But the neoconservatives weren't happy

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.633
with aggressive containment.

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:30.570
You might think of them

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.330
as the latter day proponents of rollback.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.950
Indeed as mentioned last week,

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.950
the Bush doctrine was
really about rollback

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:45.480
of aggression of any sort
to anywhere in the world

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.240
at the time of America's choosing.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.510
So the neoconservatives weren't happy

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.070
with aggressive containment

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.630
and pushed the passage of something

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.283
called The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.143
The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998,

00:33:05.143 --> 00:33:10.143
just to give you some sense
of how much the democrats here

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.680
were either on the run

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.510
or lacking in an alternative
conception of their own,

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.100
a point to which I will return,

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.100
the act passed 360 to 38 in the house

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.300
and by unanimous consent in the senate.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.780
And that act declared

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.070
that it was a policy of the United States

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:35.080
to support efforts to remove the regime

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.990
headed by Saddam Hussein.

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.060
So clear commitment of the
United States government

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.361
to overthrowing the regime.

00:33:45.361 --> 00:33:48.640
It authorized 87 million dollars

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.460
to support seven designated groups

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.981
and it created the opportunity
to support more of them

00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:59.380
with the clear beneficiary
that everyone had in mind

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.940
was The Iraqi National Congress.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.651
And this would be cited by the
Bush administration in 2002

00:34:07.651 --> 00:34:12.480
in justification of the upcoming invasion.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.480
But let's just parse
the Iraq Liberation Act

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.940
a little more closely again

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.260
by watching Bill Clinton that same day,

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.230
from a little later that same day

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.363
than the earlier clip I showed you.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:31.840
- This crisis also demonstrates
unfortunately once again

00:34:32.733 --> 00:34:35.610
that Saddam Hussein remains an impediment

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:37.990
to the well being of his people

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:39.327
and a threat to the peace of his region

00:34:39.327 --> 00:34:40.943
and the security of the world.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.840
We will continue to contain
the threat that he poses

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.240
by working for the elimination

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.150
of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction capability

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:52.983
under (mumbles),

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:56.700
enforcing the sanctions
in the no fly zone,

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.290
responding firmly to
any Iraqi provocations.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.500
However, over the long term,

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.830
the best way to address that threat

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.820
is through a government in Baghdad,

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.950
a new government that is committed

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:13.060
to represent and respect its people,

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.800
not repress them,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.543
that is committed to peace in the region.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.440
Over the past year,

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.320
we have deepened our engagement

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.690
with the forces of change in Iraq,

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.320
reconciling the two largest
Kurdish opposition groups,

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.970
beginning broadcasts of a radio free Iraq

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.120
throughout the country.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.260
We will intensify that effort,

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.280
working with congress to
implement The Iraq Liberation Act

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.300
which was recently passed,

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.130
strengthening our political support

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.640
to make sure the opposition,

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.270
or to do what we can
to make the opposition

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.470
a more effective voice

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:49.633
for the aspirations of the Iraqi people.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:51.600
- So there you can see

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.290
he's still talking the
language of containment

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:59.780
even while addressing
The Iraqi Liberation Act.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.673
Notice the date.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.430
The date's a significant one,

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.477
December 19th 1998,

00:36:07.477 --> 00:36:09.110
and it explains the kind of

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.910
deer caught in the headlights
look on Bill Clinton's face

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.150
because that was the day

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.173
that the house voted to impeach him.

00:36:19.229 --> 00:36:24.229
So he was not a happy
camper, one might say,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.860
on that day while making that speech.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.410
So this was the tussle

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:32.970
that went on toward the
end of the administration.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.369
And the Clinton Administration
was never ever contemplating

00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:39.510
actually going in and overthrowing.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.987
In fact, of the 87 million dollars,

00:36:41.987 --> 00:36:44.240
only eight was ever allocated

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.513
by the end of the administration.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.760
So they were largely
going through the motions

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.760
and he was running scared of
the Republicans in congress.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.430
And so what happens after that

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:03.590
is that these ideas are all rolling around

00:37:06.544 --> 00:37:09.010
in the conservative think tanks

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.578
and being pushed by Chalabi,

00:37:11.578 --> 00:37:15.190
but they're not really
making their way into,

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.720
as you see, they didn't make their way

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.050
into the political
campaign of George W. Bush.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.940
And when 9/11 came along,

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.370
they thought this is our moment,

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.163
and it was their moment.

00:37:29.123 --> 00:37:32.940
And it was then produced

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.940
a huge conflict within the administration

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.660
because on the one hand,

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.560
you had the Pentagon
largely allied with Chalabi

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.970
who wanted to go in,

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.360
but the State Department

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:50.360
and the CIA were strongly
opposed to going in.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:56.190
And indeed, they said that
most of the intelligence

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.261
that they saw, if not all of it,

00:37:58.261 --> 00:38:00.270
did not show any connection

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:04.580
between Saddam Hussein's regime and 9/11,

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.130
or that there was any active program

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:10.350
of building weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.360
which were two of the war aims

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.360
most commonly cited in the
quest to go in to Iraq.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.840
In the Pentagon on the other hand

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.940
is where the neoconservatives were.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.330
And they were working with intelligence

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:31.230
that was largely provided
for them by Chalabi

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:37.350
which turned out later to be fake news.

00:38:38.573 --> 00:38:41.997
And this was the fight that was going on

00:38:41.997 --> 00:38:45.400
and that once 9/11 occurred,

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.005
the Pentagon people and
the neoconservatives

00:38:48.005 --> 00:38:51.748
basically got into the
driver's seat and took over

00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:56.370
partly because both Rumsfeld and Cheney

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.580
were sympathetic to their goals

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.640
and already in the administration.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.640
And so we had this invasion of Iraq

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:12.940
that was a colossal
catastrophe for America.

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:19.385
It was a colossal catastrophe
on a number of fronts

00:39:19.886 --> 00:39:24.424
and I would say that just
to give some statistics,

00:39:24.424 --> 00:39:28.543
first of all, in terms of US casualties,

00:39:29.886 --> 00:39:32.417
it should be 4,970.

00:39:32.417 --> 00:39:34.201
I'll fix that slide.

00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:39.201
Almost 5,000 killed, 32,000 wounded.

00:39:39.317 --> 00:39:44.317
Between 150,000 and 600,000
Iraqis, I'll fix that too,

00:39:45.229 --> 00:39:50.229
killed depending on which
estimates you go with.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.940
They had given as one of the
reasons for going into the war

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.320
was that the cost of containment,

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.090
but of course, it was nickels and dimes

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.780
compared to the 1.9 trillion

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.710
that the CBO was predicting
the war would cost in 2007

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:18.423
and now, our colleague
Bill Nordhaus has a paper

00:40:18.423 --> 00:40:23.423
estimating it costed in excess
of three trillion dollars.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.880
So the financial cost was just enormous

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:33.870
and it was a massive display
of American weakness.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.279
And this is why I mentioned
the date before the invasion

00:40:39.279 --> 00:40:43.502
as the key date if you want
to pinpoint the high point

00:40:43.502 --> 00:40:47.981
of American influence in the region.

00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:52.823
It was a massive display of
American weakness in two senses.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.193
One was that the US couldn't in fact,

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:03.710
the US couldn't win this war in any sense

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.670
that would enable them

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:10.960
to live up to the mission accomplished

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.987
that George Bush had announced on May 1st.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.670
So what they conflated was the capacity

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.761
to destroy a country's army

00:41:20.761 --> 00:41:24.700
with the capacity to actually
pacify and govern a country,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.500
to win a piece, if you like.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.500
And so they put in a barely
competent general very early on

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.060
and he couldn't run the country.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.380
They replaced him with Paul
Bremer, a neoconservative,

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.380
and he began by disbanding the Iraqi Army

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.400
and officer corps in particular

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.890
because they were Sunni

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:57.039
and the majority of the
population were Shiite,

00:41:57.039 --> 00:42:00.125
and disbanding the Iraqi civil service

00:42:00.125 --> 00:42:04.590
out of fear that they might
be loyal to Saddam Hussein.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.216
And so it effectively
created a failed state

00:42:08.216 --> 00:42:11.560
that descended into civil war.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.340
They discovered that their
investment in Ahmed Chalabi

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:20.340
had been extremely ill conceived

00:42:21.202 --> 00:42:26.202
because not only did he
give them bad intelligence

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.780
as he had been doing
all the way back to 1995

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.593
in the Clinton Administration,

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.230
he predicted that the Americans

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.570
would be greeted with
flowers in the streets

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:44.041
and that we would have no difficulty

00:42:44.041 --> 00:42:48.160
creating a democracy in Iraq.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.780
And interestingly enough,

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.720
they immediately appointed him president

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.078
of the transitional
governing council in Iraq.

00:42:59.078 --> 00:43:03.180
But when the 2005 elections
were finally held,

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.640
they had by then appointed
him deputy president

00:43:08.135 --> 00:43:11.840
or deputy prime minister
and minister of oil,

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.610
he didn't even win a seat in the elections

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.700
and so he had to leave the government.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.630
And he subsequently became involved

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:24.020
in a variety of corrupt schemes

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:27.690
and fell out of favor with the Americans

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:32.690
and finally died I believe in 2015.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:37.247
So it was a massive display
of American weakness

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:40.203
in that sense as well.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.830
And it's a lesson that
proponents of rollback

00:43:49.716 --> 00:43:52.447
failed to learn again,
and again, and again,

00:43:52.447 --> 00:43:56.430
and that I mentioned to you last week

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:01.430
which is that you can destroy
a country's army perhaps,

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.230
but destroying people's capacity to fight

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.630
when they have everything at stake

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.560
and you're fighting an elective war

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.591
is a very tough proposition.

00:44:11.591 --> 00:44:15.950
So this massive display
of American weakness,

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.840
the domino theory didn't work.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.203
Not only were we not getting democracy

00:44:21.203 --> 00:44:24.030
of any functioning sort in Iraq,

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:29.030
but it was not spreading
elsewhere in the Middle East.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.780
And you might wonder to yourself why?

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.350
Why would the neoconservatives believe

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:39.670
you could create democracies
in these countries

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.570
that had no history of democracy?

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:47.110
And I think that the puzzle there

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.740
is less difficult to understand

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.160
if you think back to what
they were looking at.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.730
What they were looking
at was Eastern Europe

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.960
after the collapse of communism.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.538
All of those countries that had
been occupied by the Soviets

00:45:01.538 --> 00:45:05.520
or had been occupied by the Soviets

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.353
and then run by Soviet puppet regimes,

00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:13.923
as soon as the Soviets fell apart,

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.710
democracy sprang up.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.698
There wasn't any difficulty

00:45:19.698 --> 00:45:24.480
in getting democracy installed
across Eastern Europe.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.983
And so they thought well,
that's what happens.

00:45:28.228 --> 00:45:32.340
You get rid of the oppressive dictator

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.970
and you create a democracy

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.720
and everything will be hunky dory.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.744
And not only that,

00:45:37.744 --> 00:45:40.710
those democracies in Eastern Europe

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.633
were largely pro-American.

00:45:44.568 --> 00:45:48.460
And so the conflation
of creating a democracy

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.800
and having a pro-American regime

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.853
you might say was understandable.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:57.209
What they were ignorant of
I think were several things

00:45:57.209 --> 00:46:00.489
and they would have had much better clues

00:46:00.489 --> 00:46:03.100
if instead of looking at Eastern Europe

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.850
where they were fairly
developed diversified economies

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:08.050
everywhere except Albania

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:13.020
that had prewar histories of
democracy in many of them,

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:13.910
they should have looked at

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.440
the (mumbles) former
republics of the Soviet Union

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.350
to think about what was likely to happen

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:25.350
when the Soviet Communist
systems disintegrated.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:26.703
And of course, there,

00:46:26.703 --> 00:46:29.730
there had not been
transitions to democracy.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:33.420
And those were countries with
much lower per capita income.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.760
We know that that's
important for democracy.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.270
They were undiversifiable,

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:39.110
countries like Kazakhstan

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:42.443
which is largely just an oil economy.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:48.394
So no diversification.

00:46:48.394 --> 00:46:51.992
If they had a high per capita income,

00:46:51.992 --> 00:46:54.860
it was oil curse high per capita income.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.880
So it was undiversified economy.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.880
We know that's not propitious
for democracy either.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:04.719
So for all of these reasons,

00:47:04.719 --> 00:47:08.240
it was really pie in the sky to believe

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:13.000
that you could just get
democracy to spring up.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.570
And indeed, if you think back

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:17.330
to the two most successful cases

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:21.115
of externally imposing
democracy on a country,

00:47:21.115 --> 00:47:24.000
we have to go back to
the post World War II

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.333
West Germany and Japan

00:47:27.333 --> 00:47:32.333
which were very unusual
for a number of reasons.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:36.240
One was that the populations themselves

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.930
blamed their prior regimes

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.520
for bringing disaster upon them, right?

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.800
In 2003 in Iraq,

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.230
the Iraqi population did
not blame Saddam Hussein

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.770
for the American invasion,

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:53.770
whereas the Germans and Japanese
had started aggressive wars

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:58.543
and so they recognized
they had themself to blame.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.641
They were occupied for decades

00:48:02.641 --> 00:48:07.641
by either occupying
forces or hovering forces.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.440
They were protected by the US
umbrella during the Cold War.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:17.585
They were supported economically
by the Marshall Plan

00:48:17.585 --> 00:48:22.340
and of course, they had
favorable demographics

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.933
for reasons I talked to you
about some lectures ago.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.640
None of these conditions
were remotely present

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.870
in the countries in the Middle East

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:37.697
that the Bush Administration
was hoping for

00:48:37.697 --> 00:48:40.840
and the neoconservatives
were hoping would produce

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.840
a domino effect of successful
pro-Western democracies

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.130
across the regions.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.700
So all of these were costs
of the invasion of Iraq,

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.610
but perhaps the greatest
cost of the invasion

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:01.933
was a loss of moral high
ground on the global stage.

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:08.860
- Last month, the US Army
announced 17 soldiers in Iraq

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.920
including a brigadier general
had been removed from duty

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.430
after charges of
mistreating Iraqi prisoners.

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.050
But the details of what happened

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.530
have been kept secret until now.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.560
It turns out photographs surfaced

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.140
showing American soldiers abusing

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.480
and humiliating Iraqi prisoners
at a prison near Baghdad.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.770
Americans did this to an Iraqi prisoner.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.400
According to the US Army,

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.840
the man was told to stand on
a box with his head covered

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.540
with wires attached to his hands.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:43.180
He was told that if he fell of the box,

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.266
he would be electrocuted.

00:49:45.266 --> 00:49:49.760
Abu Ghraib Prison under
Saddam Hussein was infamous.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.870
For decades, many who were
taken here never came out.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.400
And those prisoners who did make it out

00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.090
told nightmarish tales of
torture beyond imagining

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:04.290
and executions without reason.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:09.250
Abu Ghraib was the centerpiece
of Saddam's empire of fear.

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:10.650
We talked about the prison

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.640
and shared pictures of
what Americans did there

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.330
with two men who have extensive
interrogation experience,

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.180
former US Marine Lieutenant
Colonel Bill Collin,

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.920
and former CIA Bureau Chief Bob Bayer.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.690
- I visited Abu Ghraib a couple
days after it was liberated.

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:28.239
It was the most awful
sight I've ever seen.

00:50:28.239 --> 00:50:30.300
And I said if there's ever a reason

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.820
we want to get rid of Saddam Hussein,

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.150
it's 'cause of Abu Ghraib.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:36.070
There are bodies that were eaten by dogs,

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:39.533
torture, electrodes coming out of walls,

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.360
scratches.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.590
It was an awful place.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.580
- We went into Iraq to stop
things like this from happening,

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:47.893
and indeed, here they are
happening under our tutelage.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.800
- It was American soldiers

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.220
serving as military police as Abu Ghraib

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.000
who took these pictures.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.380
The investigation started

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.810
when one soldier got them from a friend

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:01.070
and gave them to his commanders.

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:02.790
We have a dozen of them.

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:05.330
There are many, many more.

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:07.290
The pictures show Americans,

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.970
men and women in military uniforms

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:12.730
posing with naked Iraqi prisoners.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:16.000
There are shots of the
prisoners stacked in a pyramid,

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.960
one with a slur written
on his skin in English.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.460
In some, the male prisoners are positioned

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.930
to simulate sex with each other.

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:26.600
And in most of the pictures,

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.152
the Americans are
laughing, posing, pointing,

00:51:30.152 --> 00:51:32.890
or giving the camera a thumbs up.

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:34.930
One of the soldiers facing court marshal

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:38.050
is Army Reserve Staff
Sergeant Chip Frederick.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.134
He is charged with maltreatment

00:51:40.134 --> 00:51:43.380
for allegedly participating
in setting up this photo

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.530
and for posing in a photograph
sitting on top of a detainee.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:51.210
Sergeant Frederick is also
charged with an indecent act

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:53.480
for observing this scene.

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.610
He is charged with assault for
allegedly striking detainees

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:01.230
and ordering detainees
to strike each other.

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.400
Sergeant Frederick's letters
and email messages home

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.550
offer clues to problems inside the prison.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:10.950
Frederick wrote that he was
helping the interrogators.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:13.776
Quote, military
intelligence has encouraged

00:52:13.776 --> 00:52:16.278
and told us great job.

00:52:16.278 --> 00:52:19.920
They usually don't allow others
to watch them interrogate,

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.530
but since they like the
way I run the prison,

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.430
they've made an exception.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:27.960
We help getting them to talk
with the way we handle them.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.230
We've had a very high rate

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.910
with our style of getting them to break.

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:34.860
They usually end up breaking within hours.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.730
According to the Army's own investigation,

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:39.580
that's what was happening.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.450
The Army found that interrogators

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.680
asked reservists working in the prison

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.990
to prepare the Iraqi detainees physically

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.280
and mentally for questioning.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.570
Attorney Gary Meyers and
a judge advocate in Iraq

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:54.380
are defending Chip Frederick.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.760
They say he should never have been charged

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.200
because of the failure of his commanders

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.050
to provide proper training and standards.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:03.850
How could such a person

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:06.400
described almost universally

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.510
by people who knew him as a good guy

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:10.290
get himself into this kind of jam?

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:12.050
- The elixir of power,

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:13.250
the elixir of believing

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:15.420
that you're helping the CIA for god's sake

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.530
when you're from a small town in Virginia,

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:19.210
it's intoxicating.

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:23.987
And so good guys sometimes do things

00:53:23.987 --> 00:53:27.730
believing that they
are being of assistance

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.149
and helping a just cause

00:53:29.149 --> 00:53:32.500
and helping people who
they view as important.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:33.920
- Sergeant Frederick says

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.940
he didn't see a copy of
the Geneva Convention rules

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:41.240
for handling prisoners of war
until after he was charged.

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.070
The Army investigation confirms

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:46.340
that soldiers at Abu Ghraib
were not trained at all

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:47.750
in Geneva Convention rules.

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:51.260
Frederick says there were
far too few soldiers there

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.660
for the number of prisoners.

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:55.173
About how many prisoners were there?

00:53:56.524 --> 00:54:00.913
- [Chip] There was, when I
left, there was over 900.

00:54:02.453 --> 00:54:05.170
And there was only five soldiers

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:08.160
plus two non-commissioned
officers in charge

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.270
for those over 900 inmates.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:14.030
- That may have been
a contributing factor,

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.930
but at the end of the day,

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:18.813
this is probably more about
leadership, supervision,

00:54:18.813 --> 00:54:22.960
setting standards, abiding
by the army values,

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.690
and understanding what's right

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:26.390
and having the guts to say what's right.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:28.719
- I see a lot of work
going on out here now.

00:54:28.719 --> 00:54:31.110
We're changing everything.

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:34.130
- [Dan] This is Brigadier
General Janis Karpinski

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.460
who ran Abu Ghraib for the Army.

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:40.470
She was also in charge of three
other Army prison facilities

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:43.250
housing thousands of Iraqi inmates.

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:44.970
The Army investigation determined

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:47.960
that her lack of leadership
and clear standards

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.120
led to problems system wide.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.420
General Karpinski talked

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:56.620
with 60 Minutes Steve Kroft
last October at Abu Ghraib

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.400
before any of this came out.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.540
- And this is international standards.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:04.585
It's the best care available
in a prison facility.

00:55:04.585 --> 00:55:07.150
- But the Army's own investigation

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.490
found serious problems behind the scenes.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:11.730
The Army has photographs

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:15.870
that show a detainee with
wires attached to his genitals

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:19.800
and another that shows a dog
attacking an Iraqi prisoner.

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.173
Were dogs ever used on the inmates?

00:55:23.099 --> 00:55:23.932
- [Chip] Yes, sir.

00:55:23.932 --> 00:55:26.620
They were used for intimidation factors.

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.660
- [Dan] And then there is
this picture of an Iraqi man

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:32.470
who appears to be dead and badly beaten.

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:33.780
- Dan, I'd like to sit here and say

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.550
these are the only prisoner abuse cases

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:36.383
that we're aware of,

00:55:36.383 --> 00:55:38.207
but we know that there
have been some other ones

00:55:38.207 --> 00:55:40.103
since we've been here in Iraq.

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.490
- [Dan] When Saddam
Hussein ran this prison,

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:46.040
Iraqis were too afraid
to come to Abu Ghraib

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:49.100
and ask for information
on their family members.

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.920
When we were there last month,

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.756
hundreds had gathered outside the gates

00:55:52.756 --> 00:55:55.578
worried about what's going on inside.

00:55:55.578 --> 00:55:56.910
(woman sobbing)
(people chattering)

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:58.830
- We will be paid back for this.

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:01.870
These people at some
point will be let out.

00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:03.050
Their families are gonna know.

00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:05.100
Their friends are gonna know.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.280
- [Dan] This is a hard
story to have to tell

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.783
when Americans are
fighting and dying in Iraq.

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:16.030
- So it's hard to overstate the shock

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:19.010
that that caused at home,

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:22.960
but the biggest cost I think
of Abu Ghraib was not at home

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.543
but it was the loss of
the moral high ground

00:56:27.543 --> 00:56:32.543
that the US had enjoyed until
that time across the region.

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:38.100
If you look at the polling
across much of the Middle East

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.530
about perceptions of the
US during this period,

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:46.403
I described it in the reading
that I assigned for today,

00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.750
it fell off a cliff.

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:52.483
And the notion that the US

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:58.894
was in some sense bringing a better world

00:56:58.894 --> 00:57:01.440
and had different kinds of practices

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:05.852
was this sort of flagrant
violation of Canon's dictum

00:57:05.852 --> 00:57:09.610
that we should not behave in the way

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.240
that our adversaries behave

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:15.690
and that the long term
strategy of containment

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:19.470
is for the hearts of minds
of people in the countries

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.030
that are being contained.

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:26.030
And of course, the fact that
this was all exposed in,

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:39.020
initially, this 60 Minutes
report was in April of 2004,

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.590
but the following month,

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:44.390
Seymour Hersh published a
huge expose in The New Yorker

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.460
where he had gotten hold
of the Army's report

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:50.993
which you saw referred to in that clip

00:57:50.993 --> 00:57:53.529
which revealed that they had known about

00:57:53.529 --> 00:57:55.560
what was going on in Abu Ghraib

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.923
and a number of other
prisons for many months.

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:03.229
And the story just didn't get any better.

00:58:03.229 --> 00:58:06.040
What turned out to be the case

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.490
in terms of prosecutions were minimal.

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:14.490
The general you saw there
was busted back to a colonel.

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:18.080
There was some other
disciplinary actions of officers.

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.688
Nobody above the rank of staff sergeant

00:58:20.688 --> 00:58:24.160
was convicted of any criminal offense

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:28.740
and only I think it was
seven or eight people

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.690
had any kind of criminal convictions,

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:34.930
the highest being a 10 year sentence.

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:39.550
So the perception was
that the US had allowed

00:58:40.654 --> 00:58:44.060
the same kind of abominable practices

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.990
that Saddam Hussein had engaged in

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:48.472
and as I said,

00:58:48.472 --> 00:58:52.140
the cost in terms of
loss of moral high ground

00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:56.920
is probably incalculable to this day.

00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.230
What made it even worse was
that President Bush announced

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:04.242
that the prison would be
closed the following year

00:59:04.242 --> 00:59:06.300
which was not done,

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:07.133
and in fact,

00:59:07.133 --> 00:59:09.550
it wasn't closed until
after the Americans left.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:14.320
A decade later, it was
closed by the Iraqis.

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.320
So this combination of a
demonstration of American weakness

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:24.750
and the loss of any kind of
claim to be acting in defense

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:30.530
of humanitarian ideals was destroyed.

00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:33.680
In a geo-strategic sense though,

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.568
I think the biggest cost

00:59:35.568 --> 00:59:39.120
and some might in some
sense call it a benefit

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:44.120
of the Iraq debacle was it
was a clear demonstration

00:59:46.645 --> 00:59:50.860
that the Bush doctrine was unsustainable

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:55.110
because the idea that you
could go around the world

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:56.470
knocking off regimes.

00:59:56.470 --> 01:00:00.312
This is the neoconservative dream,

01:00:00.312 --> 01:00:02.980
turns out to be a nightmare

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.930
because you go around the
world knocking off regimes

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:09.230
unless you have the
propitious circumstances

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:11.156
and the kinds of investments

01:00:11.156 --> 01:00:14.931
that we made in Germany and
Japan after World War II.

01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:18.066
The high probability
is you're going to get

01:00:18.066 --> 01:00:23.066
the sort of outcome that we saw in Iraq.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.180
And so the Bush doctrine

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.510
particularly given that
it's being prosecuted

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:35.070
in an era of cutting
back government spending

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.950
and downsizing the
military as Rumsfeld argued

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:40.240
in the clip I showed you

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.440
at the beginning of
last Thursday's lecture

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.440
and contracting out more and
more military activities,

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:54.397
you're not gonna be able
to go around the world

01:00:54.397 --> 01:00:55.970
doing the sort of thing

01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:00.320
we were trying to do
in Iraq and Afghanistan

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.546
and end up with,

01:01:01.546 --> 01:01:06.546
as Bush says in the clip
I showed you earlier,

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.460
a clear exit strategy.

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:15.460
And indeed, the Bush doctrine
was a complete repudiation

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.560
of the so-called Powell Doctrine

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.430
of you've got to go in
with overwhelming force

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.970
and a clear exit strategy.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:28.560
Instead, it's proxy
wars fought on the cheap

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.670
using expatriates and local militias

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:34.840
who have very different
agendas than one's own

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.893
and this is the result

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:41.170
that you shouldn't be surprised to see.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.691
But if not the Bush doctrine, what?

01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:47.920
If not the Bush doctrine, what?

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.920
Because the 1995 document from Rand said

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.780
what are the alternatives here?

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.917
The alternatives seem to be
neoisolationism as he called it,

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.600
going back to a multi-polar world

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.459
where in an era of nuclear proliferation,

01:02:11.459 --> 01:02:15.339
that seems very dangerous
and costly for the US.

01:02:15.339 --> 01:02:19.120
So you might say well,
where were the Democrats?

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.530
We have a democracy here.

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.810
We have an opposition party

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:26.390
and one would expect
that the opposition party

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:29.783
would be articulating
an alternative vision.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.253
And the Democrats though were
completely on the defensive.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.800
So here, I should give
you a personal anecdote.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.023
In September of 2008,

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.800
I was invited to speak
at the Yale Club of Tokyo

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.603
to a group of alumni.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.253
We do that all the time.

01:02:56.253 --> 01:02:59.060
We're asked to go and
talk about our research.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.520
So I answered with three possible topics

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.050
of things I was then working on

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.117
that I would be willing to speak out.

01:03:06.117 --> 01:03:08.372
And the answer came back

01:03:08.372 --> 01:03:11.967
that nobody would be
interested in any of them.

01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:13.739
(audience laughing)

01:03:13.739 --> 01:03:16.080
And what they wanted me to speak about

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.140
was what the Kerry Administration's

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:21.050
foreign policy was going to be.

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:24.227
This is September of
2000, I'm sorry, 2004.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.060
What the Kerry Administration's

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:33.240
foreign policy was going to be.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.690
So I ended up giving a talk on

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:39.280
why there wasn't gonna
be a Kerry Administration

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.690
and the central thesis of that talk

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:45.532
was you can't beat something with nothing.

01:03:45.532 --> 01:03:48.550
And the reality here,

01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:51.530
you can see if you now
go back over the lecture

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.090
that I've just given you.

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:54.679
You can see the clues

01:03:54.679 --> 01:03:58.880
that the Democrats really
had no alternative.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.469
First of all, think about that vote

01:04:01.469 --> 01:04:03.946
of The Iraq Liberation Act.

01:04:03.946 --> 01:04:08.946
I said it was only 50 or 60
votes against it in the house,

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.917
unanimous consent in the senate,

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:16.552
and Clinton signs it into law

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:20.380
in the midst of his impeachment hearings.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:24.410
The 87 million dollars
that I mentioned to you

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:27.490
that they authorized for spending

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.270
on opposition forces in Iraq,

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:32.840
that is the famous 87 million

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.784
that Kerry was later got
into trouble for saying

01:04:36.784 --> 01:04:39.550
well, I voted for the 87 million dollars

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:41.234
before I voted against it.

01:04:41.234 --> 01:04:46.234
And was used in ads against
him by President Bush

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.670
when he was running for
re-election that year.

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:54.670
And if you look at the
votes to authorize the war,

01:04:55.596 --> 01:04:58.830
Kerry had voted for the authorization

01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:02.240
of the invasion of Iraq in 2003

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.840
as had by the way Hillary Clinton.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.570
And so basically what was going on

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:13.570
was that the Democrats were
playing a game of triangulation.

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:16.840
And as we saw when we talked about

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.540
the anti-tax movement
in domestic politics,

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:24.730
the trouble with triangulation

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:28.100
is that it's good tactics
and it's bad strategy.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.300
It's good tactics

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.523
because if you move towards
your opponent's position,

01:05:33.782 --> 01:05:36.330
you can peel off some of their support

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:39.250
and people on your flank
really have no place to go.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.430
That was the theory behind it.

01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:44.500
But the reason it's bad strategy

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.730
is that once your opponent figures out

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:49.400
that this is what you're doing,

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.290
their incentive is to move the goal posts.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:56.124
And so in effect, the Republicans

01:05:56.124 --> 01:05:59.100
and particularly the neoconservatives

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.100
within the Republican party

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.100
had the Democrats on the run

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.850
because they were playing triangulation

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:10.370
to catch up to this target
that was moving steadily

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:12.450
in a neoconservative direction.

01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:13.887
The same thing happened

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:18.887
as happened with the anti-tax movement

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:24.280
where the Democrats by 2001
found themselves voting

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.010
for tax cuts that nobody
would have taken seriously

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:30.150
even six or seven years before

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:33.630
such as the repeal of the estate tax.

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:38.630
So the Democrats left any
alternative geopolitical strategy

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.250
to the Bush doctrine.

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:47.250
The Bush doctrine filled a
void and they just ran with it.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:53.120
And so one might think that
once 2008 rolled around

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:58.340
and the Democrats were again in control,

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.723
things might have played out differently.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:03.460
But we'll see next time

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.070
that that's not how history played out.

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:08.020
We'll see you then.

01:07:09.389 --> 01:07:11.806
(calm music)

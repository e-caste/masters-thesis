00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.317
Professor Shelly Kagan:
We've begun to turn to Plato's

00:00:04.317 --> 00:00:07.114
dialogue Phaedo,
and what I started doing last

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.642
time was sketching the basic
outlines of Plato's

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:12.600
metaphysics--not so much to give
a full investigation of

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.666
that--clearly we're not going to
do that here--but just to

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:19.054
provide enough of the essential
outlines of Plato's metaphysical

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:22.443
views so that we can understand
the arguments that come up later

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:25.186
in the Phaedo,
basically all of which or many

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:27.606
of which presuppose
something--certain central

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:30.780
aspects about Plato's
metaphysical views.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.320
The key point behind his
metaphysics then was the thought

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.544
that, in addition to the
ordinary empirical physical

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:40.010
world that we're all familiar
with,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.762
we have to posit the existence
of a kind of second realm,

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:49.769
in which exist the Platonic--as
they're nowadays called--the

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.910
Platonic forms or Platonic
ideas.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.158
The sort of thing that perhaps
we might call or think of as

00:00:56.158 --> 00:00:58.510
abstract objects or abstract
properties.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.755
And the reason for positing
these things is because we're

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:05.939
clearly able to think about
these ideas,

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.893
and yet, we recognize that the
ordinary physical

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:12.412
world--although things may
participate in them to varying

00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:16.370
degrees--we don't actually come
across these objects or entities

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.062
in the physical world.
So that we can talk about

00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:23.233
things being beautiful to
varying degrees,

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:27.949
but we never come across beauty
itself in the actual empirical

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:31.194
world.
We are able to talk about the

00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:36.230
fact that two plus one equals
three, but it's not as though we

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.266
ever come across numbers--number
three itself--anywhere in the

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.629
empirical world.
A further point that

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:49.274
distinguishes the empirical
world from this--this realm of

00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:54.244
Platonic ideal objects--is that
indeed they--there's something

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:57.480
perfect about them.
They don't change.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.075
In contrast,
physical objects are constantly

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:02.905
changing.
Something might be short at one

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:07.096
point and become tall at another
point, ugly at one point and

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:10.169
become beautiful--like the ugly
duckling.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.860
It starts out ugly and becomes
a beautiful swan.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.330
In contrast,
justice itself never changes.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.977
Beauty itself never changes.
We have the thought that these

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:27.218
things are eternal,
and indeed, beyond change,

00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:30.800
in contrast to the empirical
world.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.599
In fact, if you start thinking
more about the world from this

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.449
perspective, the world we live
in is crazy.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.430
It's almost insanely
contradictory.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.660
Plato thinks of it as crazy in
the way that a dream is.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.297
When you're caught up in the
dream, you don't notice just how

00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:51.119
insane it all is.
But if you step back and

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.275
reflect on it,
"Well, let's see,

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:57.170
I was eating a sandwich and
suddenly the sandwich was the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.645
Statue of Liberty,
except the Statue of Liberty

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:03.003
was my mother.
And she's flying over the

00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.710
ocean, except she's really a
piece of spaghetti."

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.600
That's how dreams are.
And when you're in it,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.680
it sort of all makes sense.
Right?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.416
You're kind of caught up,
but you step back and say,

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:16.748
"That's just insane."
Well, Plato thinks that the

00:03:16.748 --> 00:03:21.099
empirical world has something of
that kind of insanity,

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.254
something of that kind
contradictoriness,

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:28.039
built into it that we don't
ordinarily notice.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.550
"He's a basketball player,
so he's really,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.060
really tall,
except he's only six feet.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.857
So he's really,
really short for a basketball

00:03:35.857 --> 00:03:37.651
player.
This is a baby elephant,

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:39.941
so it's really,
really big--except it's a baby

00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.129
elephant, so it's really,
really small."

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.731
The world is constantly
rolling--this is a Platonic

00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:51.610
expression--rolling between one
form and the other.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.682
And it's hard to make sense of.
In contrast,

00:03:56.682 --> 00:04:00.320
the mind is able to grasp the
Platonic ideas,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.605
the Platonic forms;
and they're stable,

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:07.230
they're reliable,
they are--they're law-like and

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.820
we can grasp them.
They don't change;

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.341
they're eternal.
That's, as I say,

00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:16.888
the Platonic picture.
Now, it's not my purpose here

00:04:16.888 --> 00:04:22.433
to try to argue for or against
Platonism with regard to

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:26.619
abstract entities.
As I suggested in talking about

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:30.023
the example of math last time,
it's not a silly view,

00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:33.819
even if it's not a view that we
all take automatically.

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.538
But in thinking about math,
most of us are inclined to be

00:04:36.538 --> 00:04:38.884
Platonists.
We all do believe something

00:04:38.884 --> 00:04:41.677
makes it true that two plus one
equals three,

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:45.232
but it's not the fact that
empirical objects--We don't do

00:04:45.232 --> 00:04:48.724
empirical experiments to see
whether two plus one equals

00:04:48.724 --> 00:04:51.228
three.
Rather, we think our mind can

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:55.621
grasp the truths about numbers.
Plato thought everything was

00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:57.939
like that.
Well, I'm not going to argue

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.342
for and against that view--just
wanted to sketch it,

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.839
so as to understand the
arguments that turn on it.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:07.022
So for our purposes,
let's suppose Plato was right

00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:10.009
about that and ask,
what follows?

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.526
Well, Plato thinks what's going
to follow is that we have some

00:05:13.526 --> 00:05:16.639
reason to believe in the
immortality of the soul as,

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.594
again, as we indicated last
time, the picture is that the

00:05:22.594 --> 00:05:29.081
mind--the soul--is able to grasp
these eternal Platonic forms,

00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:32.597
the ideas.
Typically, we're distracted

00:05:32.597 --> 00:05:37.028
from thinking about them by the
distractions provided by the

00:05:37.028 --> 00:05:40.933
body--the desire for food,
drink, sex, what have you,

00:05:40.933 --> 00:05:43.550
sleep.
But by distancing itself from

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.391
the body, the mind,
the soul, is able to better

00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.723
concentrate on the forms.
And if you're good at that,

00:05:49.723 --> 00:05:53.227
if you practice while you're
alive, separating yourself from

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:55.554
the body,
then when your body dies,

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:59.429
the mind is able to go up to
this Platonic heavenly realm and

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:03.111
commune with gods and other
immortal souls and think about

00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:06.437
the forms.
But if you've not separated

00:06:06.437 --> 00:06:11.852
yourself from the body while in
life, if you're too enmeshed in

00:06:11.852 --> 00:06:15.285
its concerns,
then upon the death of your

00:06:15.285 --> 00:06:19.960
body your soul will get sucked
back in, reincarnated perhaps,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.695
in another body.
If you're lucky,

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:24.312
as another person;
if you're not so lucky,

00:06:24.312 --> 00:06:28.279
as a pig or a donkey or an ant
or what have you.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.117
So your goal,
Plato says, your goal should

00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:37.359
be, in life, to practice
death--to separate yourself from

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:40.356
your body.
And because of this,

00:06:40.356 --> 00:06:44.740
Socrates, who's facing death,
isn't distressed at the

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.685
prospect, but happy.
He's happy that the final

00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:53.660
separation will take place and
he'll be able to go to heaven.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.308
The dialogue ends,
of course, with the death

00:06:56.308 --> 00:06:59.327
scene--Socrates has been
condemned to death by the

00:06:59.327 --> 00:07:02.302
Athenians,
and it ends with his drinking

00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:06.310
the hemlock, not distressed but
rather sort of joyful.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.731
And the dialogue ends with one
of the great moving death scenes

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:15.081
in western civilization and as
Plato says--let's get the quote

00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:18.790
here exactly right--"Of all
those we have known,

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.230
he was the best and also the
wisest and the most upright."

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.086
Just before the death scene,
there's a long myth,

00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:31.356
which I draw your attention to
but I don't want to discuss in

00:07:31.356 --> 00:07:34.780
any kind of detail.
Plato says it's a story;

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.147
it's a myth.
He's trying to indicate that

00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:43.631
there are things that we can't
really know in a scientific way

00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:47.196
but we can glimpse.
And the myth has to do with

00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:50.605
these sort of pictures I was
just describing where we don't

00:07:50.605 --> 00:07:54.190
actually live on the surface of
the Earth of in the light,

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.916
but rather live in certain
hollows in the dark where we're

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:02.149
mistaken about the nature of
reality.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.716
Some of you who are maybe
familiar with Plato's later

00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:07.874
dialogue The Republic may
recognize at least what seems to

00:08:07.874 --> 00:08:09.361
me,
what we have here,

00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:13.229
is a foreshadowing of the myth
of the cave, or the allegory of

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:17.548
the cave,
which Plato describes there as

00:08:17.548 --> 00:08:21.119
well.
Our concern is going to be the

00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:25.980
arguments that make up the
center of the dialogue.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.918
Because in the center of the
dialogue, before he dies,

00:08:28.918 --> 00:08:31.079
Socrates is arguing with his
friends.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:32.850
Socrates is saying,
"Look, I'm not worried.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.074
I'm going to live forever."
And his disciples and friends

00:08:36.074 --> 00:08:38.159
are worried whether this is true
or not.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.735
And so the heart of the
dialogue consists of a series of

00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:45.504
arguments in which Socrates
attempts to lay out his reasons

00:08:45.504 --> 00:08:48.690
for believing in the immortality
of the soul.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.620
And that's going to be our
concern.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.102
What I'm going to do is
basically run through my attempt

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:59.747
to reconstruct--my attempt to
lay out the basic ideas from

00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:04.800
this series of four or five
arguments that Plato gives us.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.503
I'm going to criticize them.
I don't think they work,

00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:11.715
though I want to remark before
I turn to them that in saying

00:09:11.715 --> 00:09:15.000
this I'm not necessarily
criticizing Plato.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.455
As we'll see,
some of the later arguments

00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:23.985
seem to be deliberately aimed at
answering objections that we can

00:09:23.985 --> 00:09:27.700
raise to some of the earlier
arguments.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.776
And so it might well be that
Plato himself recognized that

00:09:32.776 --> 00:09:38.120
the initial arguments aren't as
strong as they need to be.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.232
Plato wrote the dialogues as a
kind of learning device,

00:09:44.232 --> 00:09:51.250
as a tool to help the reader
get better at doing philosophy.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.792
They don't necessarily
represent in a systematic

00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:59.163
fashion Plato's worked out
axiomatic views about the nature

00:09:59.163 --> 00:10:02.376
of philosophy.
It could be that Plato's

00:10:02.376 --> 00:10:06.863
deliberately putting mistakes in
earlier arguments so as to

00:10:06.863 --> 00:10:09.879
encourage you to think for
yourself,

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:13.250
"Oh, this is--here's a problem
with this argument.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.830
There's an objection with that
argument."

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.940
Some of these,
Plato then may address later

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.012
on.
But whether or not he does

00:10:21.012 --> 00:10:23.750
address them--we're not doing
Plato any honor,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.879
we're not doing him any
service,

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:29.884
if we limit ourselves to simply
trying to grasp,

00:10:29.884 --> 00:10:33.899
here's what Plato thought.
We could do the history of

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:36.280
ideas and say,
"Here's Plato's views.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.032
Aren't they interesting?
Notice how they differ from

00:10:39.032 --> 00:10:41.610
Aristotle's views.
Aren't they interesting?"

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.173
and move on like that.
But that's not what the

00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:48.046
philosophers wanted us to do.
The great philosophers had

00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:52.911
arguments that they were putting
forward to try to persuade us of

00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:57.377
the truths of their positions.
And the way you show respect

00:10:57.377 --> 00:11:01.503
for a philosopher is by taking
those arguments seriously and

00:11:01.503 --> 00:11:04.299
asking yourself,
do they work or not?

00:11:04.299 --> 00:11:09.189
So whether or not the views
that are being put forward in

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:12.419
Socrates' mouth are the
considered,

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:17.129
reflective judgments of Plato
or not, for our purposes we can

00:11:17.129 --> 00:11:21.995
just act as though they were the
arguments being put forward by

00:11:21.995 --> 00:11:24.336
Plato,
and we can ask ourselves,

00:11:24.336 --> 00:11:26.889
"Do these arguments work or
don't they?"

00:11:26.889 --> 00:11:30.169
So I'm going to run through a
series of these arguments.

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:32.471
I'm going to,
as I've mentioned before,

00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:35.922
be a bit more exegetical than
is normally the case for our

00:11:35.922 --> 00:11:38.545
readings.
I'm going to actually pause,

00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:42.348
periodically look at my notes
and make sure I'm remembering

00:11:42.348 --> 00:11:45.429
how I think Plato understands
the arguments.

00:11:45.429 --> 00:11:48.643
Of course, since the dialogue
is indeed a dialogue,

00:11:48.643 --> 00:11:52.243
we don't always have the
arguments laid out with a series

00:11:52.243 --> 00:11:56.538
or premises and conclusions.
And so it's always a matter of

00:11:56.538 --> 00:11:59.896
interpretation,
what's the best reconstruction

00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:03.029
of the argument he's gesturing
towards.

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:05.842
How can we turn it into an
argument with premises and

00:12:05.842 --> 00:12:09.056
conclusions?
Well, that's what I'm going to

00:12:09.056 --> 00:12:12.216
try to do for us.
Also going to give the

00:12:12.216 --> 00:12:15.103
arguments names.
These are not names that Plato

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:17.899
gives, but it will make it easy
for us to get a fix,

00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:20.423
roughly, on the different
arguments as we move from one to

00:12:20.423 --> 00:12:22.193
the next.
So the first argument,

00:12:22.193 --> 00:12:24.878
and the worry that gets the
whole things going,

00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:27.093
is this.
So, we've got this nice

00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:30.309
Platonic picture where Plato
says, "All right.

00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:32.960
So the mind can grasp the
eternal forms,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.629
but it has to free itself from
the body to do that."

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:39.726
And so, the philosopher,
who has sort of trained himself

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:41.809
to separate his mind from his
body,

00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:44.798
to disregard his bodily
cravings and desires--the

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:48.347
philosopher will welcome death
because at that point he'll

00:12:48.347 --> 00:12:50.558
truly,
finally, make the final break

00:12:50.558 --> 00:12:54.014
from the body.
And the obvious worry that gets

00:12:54.014 --> 00:12:57.752
raised in the dialogue at this
point is this:

00:12:57.752 --> 00:13:02.511
How do we know that when the
death of the body occurs the

00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:05.909
soul doesn't get destroyed as
well?

00:13:05.909 --> 00:13:07.570
That's the natural worry to
have.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:13.176
Maybe what we need to do is
separate ourselves as much as

00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:19.284
possible from the influence of
our body without actually going

00:13:19.284 --> 00:13:23.690
all the way and breaking the
connection.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.275
If you think about it like a
rubber band, maybe the more we

00:13:27.275 --> 00:13:29.809
can stretch the rubber band the
better;

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:33.532
but if you stretch too far and
the rubber band snaps,

00:13:33.532 --> 00:13:35.679
that's not good,
that's bad.

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:41.832
It could be that we need the
body in order to continue

00:13:41.832 --> 00:13:45.135
thinking.
We want to free ourselves from

00:13:45.135 --> 00:13:49.051
the distractions of the body,
but we don't want the body to

00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:52.899
die, because when the body dies
the soul dies as well.

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.911
Even if we are dualists,
as we've noticed before--even

00:13:55.911 --> 00:13:58.809
if the soul is something
different from the body--it

00:13:58.809 --> 00:14:01.732
could still be the case,
logically speaking,

00:14:01.732 --> 00:14:04.887
that if the body gets
destroyed, the soul gets

00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:08.394
destroyed as well.
And so, Socrates' friends ask

00:14:08.394 --> 00:14:12.463
him, how can we be confident
that the soul will survive the

00:14:12.463 --> 00:14:15.549
death of the body and indeed be
immortal?

00:14:15.549 --> 00:14:17.960
And that's what prompts the
series of arguments.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:24.963
Now, the first such argument I
dub "the argument from the

00:14:24.963 --> 00:14:31.062
nature of the forms."
And the basic thought is fairly

00:14:31.062 --> 00:14:35.686
straightforward.
The ideas or the forms--justice

00:14:35.686 --> 00:14:40.478
itself, beauty itself,
goodness itself--the forms are

00:14:40.478 --> 00:14:43.399
not physical objects.
Right?

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:47.980
We don't ever bump into justice
itself.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.951
We bump into societies that may
be more or less just,

00:14:50.951 --> 00:14:53.409
or individuals who may be more
or less just,

00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:55.809
but we never bump into justice
itself.

00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:57.870
The number three is not a
physical object.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.029
Goodness itself is not a
physical object.

00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:04.159
Perfect roundness is not a
physical object.

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:08.784
Now, roughly speaking,
Socrates' seems to think it's

00:15:08.784 --> 00:15:13.045
going to follow
straightforwardly from that that

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:17.669
the soul must itself be
something non-physical.

00:15:17.669 --> 00:15:23.140
If the forms are not physical
objects, then Socrates thinks it

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.445
follows they can't be grasped.
We can certainly think about

00:15:27.445 --> 00:15:30.060
the forms, but if they're
non-physical they can't be

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.470
grasped by something physical
like the body.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.591
They've got to be grasped by
something non-physical--namely,

00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:38.741
the soul.
But although that's,

00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:42.127
I think, the sketch of where
Socrates wants to go,

00:15:42.127 --> 00:15:44.960
it doesn't quite give us what
we want.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.417
On the one hand,
even if it were true that the

00:15:48.417 --> 00:15:52.951
soul must be non-physical in
order to grasp the non-physical

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:55.348
forms,
wouldn't follow that the soul

00:15:55.348 --> 00:15:57.370
will survive the death of the
body.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:01.307
That's the problem we've been
thinking about for the last

00:16:01.307 --> 00:16:03.379
minute.
And there's something puzzling.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:07.387
We might wonder,
well, just why is it that the

00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:12.204
body can't grasp the forms?
So there's a fuller version of

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:15.779
the argument that's the one I
want to focus on.

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:17.470
And indeed, I put it up on the
board.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:27.227
So Platonic metaphysics gives
us premise number one--that

00:16:27.227 --> 00:16:31.019
ideas, forms,
are eternal and they're

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:35.797
non-physical.
Two--that which is eternal or

00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:41.361
non-physical can only be grasped
by the eternal and the

00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:45.049
non-physical.
Suppose we had both of those.

00:16:45.049 --> 00:16:50.323
It would seem to give us three,
the conclusion we want--that

00:16:50.323 --> 00:16:55.060
which grasps the ideas or the
forms must be eternal or

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.823
non-physical.
What is it that grasps the

00:16:57.823 --> 00:17:00.500
ideas or the forms?
Well, that's the soul.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.630
If that which grasps the ideas
or the forms must be

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.761
eternal/non-physical,
well one thing we're going to

00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:07.783
get is,
since that which grasps the

00:17:07.783 --> 00:17:12.890
forms must be non-physical,
the soul is not the body.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.445
Since that which grasps the
ideas or forms must be eternal

00:17:17.445 --> 00:17:20.961
or non-physical--it's eternal,
it's immortal.

00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:24.095
All right.
Let's look at this again more

00:17:24.095 --> 00:17:27.770
carefully.
Ideas or forms are eternal;

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.286
they're non-physical.
Well, I've emphasized the

00:17:30.286 --> 00:17:33.232
non-physical aspect,
and I've emphasized as well

00:17:33.232 --> 00:17:37.323
that they're not changing.
But perhaps it's worth taking a

00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:41.210
moment to emphasize the eternal
aspect of the forms.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:47.384
Now, people may come and go,
but perfect justice--the idea

00:17:47.384 --> 00:17:51.500
of perfect justice--that's
timeless.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.823
Nothing that happens here on
Earth can change or alter or

00:17:56.823 --> 00:18:01.035
destroy the number three.
Two plus one equaled three

00:18:01.035 --> 00:18:05.059
before there were people;
two plus one equals three now;

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:08.180
two plus one will always equal
three.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.410
The number three is eternal,
as well as being non-physical.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.455
So the Platonic metaphysics
says quite generally,

00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:18.374
if we're thinking about the
ideas or the forms,

00:18:18.374 --> 00:18:21.040
the point to grasp is they're
eternal;

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.535
they're non-physical.
The crucial premise--since

00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:29.998
we're giving Plato number
one--the crucial premise for our

00:18:29.998 --> 00:18:35.336
purposes is premise number two.
Is it or isn't it true that

00:18:35.336 --> 00:18:40.986
those things which are eternal
or non-physical can only be

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:47.329
grasped by something that is
itself eternal and non-physical?

00:18:47.329 --> 00:18:51.358
Again, it does seem as though
the conclusion that he wants,

00:18:51.358 --> 00:18:53.720
number three,
follows from that.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.745
If we give him number two,
it's going to follow that

00:18:56.745 --> 00:18:59.592
whatever's doing the
grasping--call that the soul

00:18:59.592 --> 00:19:03.270
since the soul is just Plato's
word for our mind--if whatever's

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.532
doing the grasping of the
eternal and non-physical forms

00:19:06.532 --> 00:19:09.380
must itself be eternal and
non-physical,

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.670
it follows that the soul must
be non-physical.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:17.056
So the physicalist view is
wrong and the soul must be

00:19:17.056 --> 00:19:21.059
eternal.
The soul is immortal.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:26.974
So Socrates has what he wants,
once we give him premise number

00:19:26.974 --> 00:19:31.434
two, that the eternal,
non-physical can only be

00:19:31.434 --> 00:19:35.410
grasped by the eternal,
non-physical.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:43.786
As Socrates puts it at one
point, "The impure cannot attain

00:19:43.786 --> 00:19:47.694
the pure."
Bodies--corruptible,

00:19:47.694 --> 00:19:52.370
destroyable,
physical, passing--whether they

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.767
exist or not,
whether they exist for a brief

00:19:55.767 --> 00:19:58.860
period and then they cease to
exist--these impure objects

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.998
cannot attain,
cannot grasp,

00:20:00.998 --> 00:20:06.530
cannot have knowledge of the
eternal, changeless non-physical

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.501
forms.
"The impure cannot attain the

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:13.485
pure."
That's the crucial premise,

00:20:13.485 --> 00:20:18.100
and what I want to say is,
as far as I can see there's no

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.150
good reason to believe number
two.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.201
Now, number two is not an
unfamiliar--premise number two

00:20:24.201 --> 00:20:28.342
is not an unfamiliar claim.
I take it the claim basically

00:20:28.342 --> 00:20:32.184
is that, to put it in more
familiar language,

00:20:32.184 --> 00:20:35.412
it takes one to know one.
Or to use it,

00:20:35.412 --> 00:20:38.842
slightly other kind of language
that Plato uses at various

00:20:38.842 --> 00:20:41.130
points, "Likes are known by
likes."

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.877
But it takes one to know one is
probably the most familiar way

00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:47.555
of putting the point.
Plato's saying,

00:20:47.555 --> 00:20:52.540
"What is it that we know?
Well, we know the eternal forms;

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.659
takes one to know one.
So we must ourselves be

00:20:56.659 --> 00:20:58.832
eternal."
Unfortunately,

00:20:58.832 --> 00:21:01.047
this thought,
popular as it may be,

00:21:01.047 --> 00:21:04.370
that it takes one to know one,
just seems false.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.683
Think about some examples.
Well, let's see,

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:13.143
a biologist might study,
or a zoologist might study,

00:21:13.143 --> 00:21:15.614
cats.
Takes one to know one,

00:21:15.614 --> 00:21:18.550
so the biologist must himself
be a cat.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:25.721
Well, that's clearly false.
You don't have to be feline to

00:21:25.721 --> 00:21:30.190
study the feline.
Takes one to know one;

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.409
so, you can't be a Canadian and
study Mexicans,

00:21:34.409 --> 00:21:37.619
because it takes one to know
one.

00:21:37.619 --> 00:21:39.700
Well, that's just clearly
stupid.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.813
Of course the Canadians can
study the Mexicans and the

00:21:43.813 --> 00:21:48.341
Germans can study the French.
It does not take one to know

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:50.860
one;
to understand the truths about

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.500
the French, you do not yourself
need to be French.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:01.800
Or take the fact that some
doctors study dead bodies.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.599
Aha!
So to study and grasp things

00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:08.377
about dead bodies,
corpses, you must yourself be a

00:22:08.377 --> 00:22:10.764
dead body.
No, that certainly doesn't

00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:13.073
follow.
So if we start actually pushing

00:22:13.073 --> 00:22:16.294
ourselves to think about
examples--does it really take

00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:21.068
one to know one--the answer is,
at least as a general claim,

00:22:21.068 --> 00:22:26.247
it's not true.
It doesn't normally take one to

00:22:26.247 --> 00:22:30.446
know one.
Now, strictly speaking,

00:22:30.446 --> 00:22:36.440
that doesn't prove that premise
two is false.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.427
It could still be that,
although normally you don't

00:22:40.427 --> 00:22:44.973
have to be like the thing that
you're studying in order to

00:22:44.973 --> 00:22:48.682
study it,
although that's not normally

00:22:48.682 --> 00:22:54.410
true, it could be that in the
particular case of non-physical

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.627
objects,
in the particular case of

00:22:57.627 --> 00:23:01.268
eternal objects,
you do have to be eternal,

00:23:01.268 --> 00:23:05.656
non-physical to study them.
It could be that even though

00:23:05.656 --> 00:23:08.655
the general claim,
"it takes one to know one" is

00:23:08.655 --> 00:23:10.563
false,
the particular claim,

00:23:10.563 --> 00:23:14.309
"eternal, non-physical can only
be grasped by the eternal,

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:18.900
non-physical," maybe that
particular claim is true.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:24.210
And it's only the particular
claim that Plato needs.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:32.319
Still, all I can say is,
why should we believe two?

00:23:32.319 --> 00:23:37.099
Why should we think there's
some--Even though,

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:43.047
normally, the barrier can be
crossed and Xs can study the

00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:45.633
non-X,
why should that barrier

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:49.539
suddenly become un-crossable in
the particular instance when

00:23:49.539 --> 00:23:51.990
we're dealing with Platonic
forms?

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:58.009
Give us some reason to believe
premise two.

00:23:58.009 --> 00:24:01.520
I can't see any good reason to
believe premise two,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.310
and as far as I can see,
Plato doesn't actually give us

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.470
any reason to believe it in the
dialogue.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.539
Consequently,
we have to say,

00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:13.865
as far as I can see,
we haven't been given any

00:24:13.865 --> 00:24:18.005
adequate argument for the
conclusion that the soul--which

00:24:18.005 --> 00:24:22.292
admittedly can think about forms
and ideas--we have no good

00:24:22.292 --> 00:24:25.418
reason yet to believe,
to be persuaded,

00:24:25.418 --> 00:24:28.540
that the soul must itself be
eternal and non-physical.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.971
That's the first argument.
As I say though,

00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:38.758
Plato may well recognize the
inadequacy of that argument,

00:24:38.758 --> 00:24:42.815
because after all Socrates goes
on to offer a series of other

00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:46.859
arguments.
So let's turn to the next.

00:24:46.859 --> 00:24:51.144
I call the second argument "the
argument from recycling"--not

00:24:51.144 --> 00:24:54.857
the best label I suppose,
but I've never been able to

00:24:54.857 --> 00:25:00.322
come up with a better one.
And the basic idea is that

00:25:00.322 --> 00:25:05.043
parts get re-used.
Things move from one state to

00:25:05.043 --> 00:25:08.839
another state and then back to
the first state.

00:25:08.839 --> 00:25:12.110
So, for example,
to give an example that Plato

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.889
actually gives in the dialogue,
we are all awake now,

00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:20.564
but previously we were asleep.
We went from being in the realm

00:25:20.564 --> 00:25:24.119
of the asleep to being in the
realm of the awake,

00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:28.325
and we're going to return from
the realm of the awake back to

00:25:28.325 --> 00:25:32.460
the realm of the asleep and over
and over and over again.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.846
Hence, recycling.
I think that actually a better

00:25:36.846 --> 00:25:40.415
example for Plato's purposes,
not that I expect him to have

00:25:40.415 --> 00:25:43.369
this particular example,
but, would be a car.

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:52.100
Cars are made up of parts that
existed before the car itself

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.646
existed.
There was the engine and the

00:25:55.646 --> 00:25:58.819
steering wheel and the tires and
so forth.

00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:03.831
And these parts got assembled
and put together to make up a

00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:07.802
car.
So the parts of the car existed

00:26:07.802 --> 00:26:12.480
prior to the existence of the
car itself.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.001
And the time is going to come
when the car will cease to exist

00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:21.350
but its parts will still be
around.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.688
Right?
It'll get taken apart for

00:26:23.688 --> 00:26:26.997
parts, sold for parts.
There will be the distributor

00:26:26.997 --> 00:26:29.804
cap, and there will be the
tires, and there will be the

00:26:29.804 --> 00:26:32.299
carburetor, there will be the
steering wheel.

00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:35.844
Hence, the name,
that I dub the argument,

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:42.750
"the argument from recycling."
That's the nature of reality

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.248
for Plato.
And it seems like a plausible

00:26:46.248 --> 00:26:50.390
enough view.
Things come into being by being

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.529
composed of previously existing
parts.

00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:58.814
And then, when those things
cease to have the form they had,

00:26:58.814 --> 00:27:01.720
the parts get used for other
purposes.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.779
They get recycled.
If we grant that to Plato,

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:12.329
he thinks we've got an argument
for the immortality of the soul.

00:27:12.329 --> 00:27:16.758
Because after all,
what are the parts that make us

00:27:16.758 --> 00:27:18.553
up?
Well, there are the various

00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:21.289
parts of our physical body,
but there's also our soul.

00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:24.438
Remember, as I said,
in introducing the

00:27:24.438 --> 00:27:28.166
Phaedo,
Plato doesn't so much argue for

00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:31.480
the existence of something
separate,

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.587
the soul, as presuppose it.
His fundamental concern is to

00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:38.660
try to argue for the immortality
of the soul.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.790
So he's just helping himself to
the assumption that there is a

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.043
soul.
It's one of the parts that

00:27:44.043 --> 00:27:46.956
makes us, that goes up into
making us up,

00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:50.796
goes into making us up.
It's one of the pieces that

00:27:50.796 --> 00:27:53.854
constitutes us.
Given the thesis about

00:27:53.854 --> 00:27:57.748
recycling, then,
we have reason to believe the

00:27:57.748 --> 00:28:01.730
soul will continue to exist
after we break.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.960
Even after our death,
our parts will continue to

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.658
exist.
Our body continues to exist

00:28:08.658 --> 00:28:12.180
even after our death.
Our soul will continue to exist.

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:22.692
Well, there's a problem with
the argument from recycling,

00:28:22.692 --> 00:28:26.772
and it's this.
Even if the recycling thesis

00:28:26.772 --> 00:28:32.130
shows us that we're made up of
something that existed before

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:37.942
our birth and that some kinds of
parts are going to have to exist

00:28:37.942 --> 00:28:42.132
after our death,
we can't conclude that the soul

00:28:42.132 --> 00:28:46.697
is one of the parts that's going
to continue to exist after our

00:28:46.697 --> 00:28:47.360
death.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.559
Consider some familiar facts
about human bodies.

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:58.832
As we nowadays know,
human bodies are made up of

00:28:58.832 --> 00:29:01.954
atoms.
And it's certainly true that

00:29:01.954 --> 00:29:06.829
the atoms that make up my body
existed long before my body

00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:09.588
existed.
And it's certainly true that

00:29:09.588 --> 00:29:13.420
after my death those atoms are
going to continue to exist.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.743
So there's some--and will
eventually get used to make

00:29:16.743 --> 00:29:20.469
something else.
So Plato's certainly right

00:29:20.469 --> 00:29:24.529
about recycling as a fundamental
truth.

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:27.009
The things that make me up
existed before,

00:29:27.009 --> 00:29:29.670
and will continue to exist
after my death.

00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:39.018
But that doesn't mean that
every part of my body existed

00:29:39.018 --> 00:29:44.183
before I was born,
and that every part of my body

00:29:44.183 --> 00:29:48.380
will continue to exist after I
die.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:54.869
Take my heart.
My heart is a part of my body.

00:29:54.869 --> 00:29:58.429
Yet, for all that,
it didn't exist before my body

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:02.162
began to exist.
It came into existence as part

00:30:02.162 --> 00:30:05.377
of, along with,
the creation of my body,

00:30:05.377 --> 00:30:09.858
and it won't continue to exist,
at least not very long,

00:30:09.858 --> 00:30:12.339
after the destruction of my
body.

00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:15.264
There'll be a brief period in
which, as a cadaver I suppose,

00:30:15.264 --> 00:30:16.950
my heart will continue to
exist.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.180
But eventually my body will
decompose.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.038
We certainly wouldn't have any
grounds to conclude my heart is

00:30:24.038 --> 00:30:29.789
immortal, will exist forever.
That just seems wrong.

00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:35.324
So even though it's true that
some kind of recycling takes

00:30:35.324 --> 00:30:41.149
place, we can't conclude that
everything that's now a part of

00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:45.130
me will continue to exist
afterwards.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:49.227
It might not have been one of
the parts, one of the

00:30:49.227 --> 00:30:53.160
fundamental parts,
from which I'm built--like the

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.070
heart.
And if that's right,

00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:02.340
if there can be parts that I
have now that weren't one of the

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.148
parts from which I was made,
there's no particular reason to

00:31:07.148 --> 00:31:09.880
think it's going to be one of
the parts that's going to

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.346
continue to exist after I die.
Once we see that kind of worry,

00:31:14.346 --> 00:31:18.315
we have to see,
look, the same thing could be

00:31:18.315 --> 00:31:23.269
true for the soul.
Even if there is an immortal

00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:27.118
soul--Sorry.
Even if there is a non-physical

00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:31.349
soul that's part of me,
we don't yet have any reason to

00:31:31.349 --> 00:31:36.051
believe that it's one of the
fundamental building blocks that

00:31:36.051 --> 00:31:39.919
were being recycled.
We don't have adequate reason

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:43.869
to conclude that it's something
that existed before I was put

00:31:43.869 --> 00:31:46.577
together,
it's something that will be

00:31:46.577 --> 00:31:50.200
recycled and continue to exist
after I fall apart,

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.846
after my body decomposes,
after I'm separated from my

00:31:53.846 --> 00:31:59.119
body, or what have you.
Even if recycling takes place,

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:06.157
we don't have any good reason
yet to believe that the soul is

00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:12.177
one of the recycled parts.
So it seems to me "the argument

00:32:12.177 --> 00:32:16.990
from recycling," as I call it,
is not successful either.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.193
Now, as I say,
many times when you read the

00:32:26.193 --> 00:32:29.380
dialogue, this or other
dialogues by Plato,

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.639
it seems as though he's fully
cognizant of the objections that

00:32:34.639 --> 00:32:39.725
at least an attentive reader
will raise about earlier stages

00:32:39.725 --> 00:32:43.849
of the argument.
Because sometimes the best way

00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:48.569
to understand a later argument
is to see it as responding to

00:32:48.569 --> 00:32:51.690
the weaknesses of earlier
arguments.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:56.032
And I think that's pretty
clearly what's going on in the

00:32:56.032 --> 00:33:00.059
very next argument that comes up
in the dialogue.

00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:04.335
The objection I just raised,
after all, to the argument from

00:33:04.335 --> 00:33:08.167
recycling, said,
in effect, even though some

00:33:08.167 --> 00:33:13.970
kind of recycling takes place,
not all my parts get recycled,

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:18.705
because not all of my parts
were among the pre-existing

00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:22.740
constituent pieces from which I
am built up.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.148
We don't have any particular
reason to think my heart's one

00:33:26.148 --> 00:33:30.029
of the prior-existing pieces;
we don't have any good reason

00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:34.220
to assume that my soul's one of
the prior-existing pieces.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:40.351
Well, Plato's very next
argument attempts to persuade us

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:47.375
that indeed we do have reason to
believe that the soul is one of

00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:54.927
the prior-existing pieces.
And this argument is known as

00:33:54.927 --> 00:33:59.859
"the argument from
recollection."

00:33:59.859 --> 00:34:03.016
The idea is,
he's going to tell us certain

00:34:03.016 --> 00:34:06.942
facts that need explaining,
and the best explanation

00:34:06.942 --> 00:34:10.559
involves a certain fact about
recollecting,

00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:13.639
or a certain claim about
recollecting or remembering.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.422
But we can only remember,
he thinks, in the relevant way

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:20.724
if our soul existed before the
birth of our body,

00:34:20.724 --> 00:34:23.200
before the creation of our
body.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:29.250
All right.
What's the crucial fact?

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.905
Well, let's start by--Plato
starts by telling us,

00:34:32.905 --> 00:34:36.789
reminding us of what it is to
remember something.

00:34:36.789 --> 00:34:43.021
Or perhaps a better word would
be what is it to be reminded of

00:34:43.021 --> 00:34:49.049
something by something else that
resembles it but is not the

00:34:49.049 --> 00:34:56.524
thing it reminds you of.
I might have a photograph of my

00:34:56.524 --> 00:35:01.300
friend Ruth.
And looking at the photograph

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.810
reminds me of Ruth.
It brings Ruth to mind.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.846
I start thinking about Ruth.
I remember various things I

00:35:09.846 --> 00:35:13.157
know about Ruth.
The photograph is able to do

00:35:13.157 --> 00:35:16.010
that, is able to trigger these
thoughts.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.810
But of course,
the photograph is not Ruth.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.775
Right?
Nobody would--who's thinking

00:35:21.775 --> 00:35:25.969
clearly--would confuse the
photograph with my friend.

00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:30.579
But the photograph resembles
Ruth.

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:35.621
It resembles Ruth well enough
to remind me of her,

00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:40.662
and interestingly,
it can do that even if it's not

00:35:40.662 --> 00:35:44.734
a very good photograph.
You might hold up the

00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:48.308
photograph and I might say,
"Gosh, that really doesn't look

00:35:48.308 --> 00:35:52.583
very much like Ruth does it?"
Even though I see that it is a

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:56.760
photograph of Ruth;
it reminds me of her.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:02.974
Now, how could it be that a
photograph reminds me of my

00:36:02.974 --> 00:36:05.651
friend?
Well, this isn't some deep

00:36:05.651 --> 00:36:09.244
mystery.
Presumably the way it works is,

00:36:09.244 --> 00:36:13.440
as I just said,
it looks sort of like her.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.360
It doesn't have to look very
much like her.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.481
It looks sort of like her.
Your young brother or sister,

00:36:19.481 --> 00:36:24.098
or my little children,
can draw pictures of family

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:28.619
members that barely look like
family members.

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:32.880
My niece drew a picture of my
family once when she was three.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.769
It didn't look very much like
us at all, but we could sort of

00:36:36.769 --> 00:36:40.139
see the resemblance in a vague
kind of way, right?

00:36:40.139 --> 00:36:45.850
So it's got to look at least
somewhat like the missing

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:49.000
friend.
But that's not enough.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.539
You've never met Ruth,
let's suppose.

00:36:51.539 --> 00:36:54.257
I hold up the photograph
without having told you anything

00:36:54.257 --> 00:36:56.852
about her.
The photograph's not going to

00:36:56.852 --> 00:36:59.450
remind you of Ruth.
Why not?

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:05.073
Well, you don't know Ruth.
So the pieces we need are not

00:37:05.073 --> 00:37:10.319
only an image of Ruth,
even if an imperfect image of

00:37:10.319 --> 00:37:16.079
Ruth, we also need some prior
acquaintance with Ruth.

00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:17.510
That's pretty much what it
takes, right?

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:23.497
So on the one hand--temporal
sequence--first you know Ruth,

00:37:23.497 --> 00:37:27.420
you meet Ruth,
you get to know Ruth.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.836
Then at a later time you're
shown an image of Ruth--maybe

00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:38.349
not even an especially good
image of Ruth--but good enough

00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:41.221
to remind you.
And suddenly,

00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:45.310
you're remembering things you
know about Ruth.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.180
That's how recollection works.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:55.630
All right.
Now, Plato points out that we

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.440
all know things about the
Platonic forms.

00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:07.143
But the Platonic forms,
as we also know,

00:38:07.143 --> 00:38:10.949
are not to be found in this
world.

00:38:10.949 --> 00:38:14.067
The number three is not a
physical object,

00:38:14.067 --> 00:38:17.261
perfect roundness is not a
physical object,

00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:20.760
perfect goodness is not a
physical object.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:24.038
We can think about these things;
our mind can grasp them,

00:38:24.038 --> 00:38:27.349
but they're not to be found in
this world.

00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:31.918
Yet, various things that we do
find in this world get us

00:38:31.918 --> 00:38:34.410
thinking about those things.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.949
I look at the plate on my
kitchen table,

00:38:40.949 --> 00:38:45.460
it's not perfectly round,
it's got imperfections;

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.856
but suddenly I start thinking
about circles,

00:38:48.856 --> 00:38:57.030
perfectly round objects.
I look at somebody who's pretty.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:01.416
He or she is not perfectly
beautiful, but suddenly I start

00:39:01.416 --> 00:39:04.880
thinking about the nature of
beauty itself.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:10.366
Ordinary objects in the world
participate to a greater or

00:39:10.366 --> 00:39:14.090
lesser degree in the Platonic
forms.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:17.710
That's Plato's picture of
metaphysics.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.815
And we bump up against,
we look at, we have

00:39:21.815 --> 00:39:26.409
interactions with these everyday
objects and,

00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:32.151
somehow, they get us thinking
about the Platonic forms

00:39:32.151 --> 00:39:35.600
themselves.
How does it happen?

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:41.790
Plato has a theory.
He says, "These things remind

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:47.722
us of the Platonic forms."
We see something that's

00:39:47.722 --> 00:39:53.281
beautiful to some degree,
and it reminds us of perfect

00:39:53.281 --> 00:39:57.087
beauty.
We see something that's more or

00:39:57.087 --> 00:40:01.889
less round, and it reminds us of
perfect circularity.

00:40:01.889 --> 00:40:06.164
We see somebody who's fairly
decent morally,

00:40:06.164 --> 00:40:11.829
and it reminds us of perfect
justice or perfect virtue.

00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:18.413
It's just like the photograph,
perhaps the not very good

00:40:18.413 --> 00:40:24.160
photograph, that reminds me of
my friend Ruth.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.365
All right.
Well, there's an explanation of

00:40:26.365 --> 00:40:29.531
how it could be that things that
are not themselves perfectly

00:40:29.531 --> 00:40:31.946
round could remind us,
could make us think about

00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:34.582
perfect roundness.
But then Plato says,

00:40:34.582 --> 00:40:39.360
"Okay, but keep in mind
all of what you need in

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.778
order to have reminding,
to have recollecting take

00:40:43.778 --> 00:40:48.350
place."
In order for the photograph to

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:53.469
remind me of Ruth,
I have to already have met

00:40:53.469 --> 00:40:56.388
Ruth.
I have to already be acquainted

00:40:56.388 --> 00:40:57.030
with her.

00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:07.310
In order for a more or less
round plate to remind me of

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:13.631
roundness, Plato says,
I have to have already met

00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:19.450
perfect roundness itself.
In order for a more or less

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:22.636
just society to remind me of
justice itself,

00:41:22.636 --> 00:41:26.710
so that I can start thinking
about the nature of justice

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.973
itself,
I have to somehow have already

00:41:29.973 --> 00:41:32.980
been acquainted with perfect
justice.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:40.531
But how and when did it happen?
Not in this life,

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:44.258
not in this world.
In this world nothing is

00:41:44.258 --> 00:41:48.075
perfectly round,
nothing is perfectly beautiful,

00:41:48.075 --> 00:41:54.653
nothing is perfectly just.
So it's got to have happened

00:41:54.653 --> 00:41:58.743
before.
If seeing the photograph of my

00:41:58.743 --> 00:42:04.703
friend now can remind me of my
friend, it's got to be because I

00:42:04.703 --> 00:42:09.420
met my friend before.
If seeing things that

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:14.814
participate in the forms remind
me of the forms,

00:42:14.814 --> 00:42:22.045
it's got to be because I've met
or been acquainted directly with

00:42:22.045 --> 00:42:27.109
the forms before.
But you don't bump up against,

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:30.495
you don't meet,
you don't see or grasp or

00:42:30.495 --> 00:42:35.489
become directly acquainted with,
the forms in this life.

00:42:35.489 --> 00:42:40.570
So it's got to have happened
before this life.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:46.769
That's Plato's argument.
Plato says, thinking about the

00:42:46.769 --> 00:42:54.327
way in which we grasp the forms
helps us to see that the soul

00:42:54.327 --> 00:43:01.714
must have existed before birth,
in the Platonic heavenly realm,

00:43:01.714 --> 00:43:06.119
directly grasping,
directly communing with,

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:10.389
directly understanding the
forms.

00:43:10.389 --> 00:43:15.435
It's not taking place in this
life, so it has to have happened

00:43:15.435 --> 00:43:18.166
before.
Well, look, now we've got the

00:43:18.166 --> 00:43:20.769
kind of argument we were looking
for.

00:43:20.769 --> 00:43:24.382
Earlier the objection was,
we had no good reason to think

00:43:24.382 --> 00:43:27.931
the soul was one of the building
blocks from which we're

00:43:27.931 --> 00:43:31.227
composed;
we have no good reason to think

00:43:31.227 --> 00:43:36.062
it's one of the pieces that was
around before our body got put

00:43:36.062 --> 00:43:39.460
together, before our birth.
Socrates says, "No.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.870
On the contrary,
we do have reason,

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.634
based on the argument from
recollection,

00:43:44.634 --> 00:43:49.030
to conclude that the soul was
around before we were born."

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:56.508
All right.
So the next question is,

00:43:56.508 --> 00:43:59.420
is the argument from
recollection a good one?

00:44:02.489 --> 00:44:05.087
Now, let's say,
I'm not really much concerned

00:44:05.087 --> 00:44:08.097
with whether this was an
argument that Plato thought

00:44:08.097 --> 00:44:10.316
worked or not.
Our question is,

00:44:10.316 --> 00:44:12.920
do we think it works or
not?

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.873
Although this is a form of an
argument that Plato does put

00:44:15.873 --> 00:44:17.789
forward in other dialogues as
well,

00:44:17.789 --> 00:44:21.416
and so it strikes me so there's
at least some reason to think

00:44:21.416 --> 00:44:24.739
this is an argument that he felt
might well be right.

00:44:24.739 --> 00:44:29.357
The crucial premise--Again,
we're going to just grant Plato

00:44:29.357 --> 00:44:33.995
the metaphysics.
The crucial question is going

00:44:33.995 --> 00:44:40.738
to be, is it right that in order
to explain how it is we could

00:44:40.738 --> 00:44:47.149
have knowledge of the forms now
that we have to appeal to a

00:44:47.149 --> 00:44:53.449
prior existence in which we had
direct acquaintance?

00:44:53.449 --> 00:44:58.739
It's not obvious to me that
that's true.

00:44:58.739 --> 00:45:00.400
It's not obvious to me for a
couple of reasons.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.712
One question is this:
Is it really true that in order

00:45:04.712 --> 00:45:08.030
to think about the perfectly
straight,

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:12.851
I must have somehow,
somewhere at some point come up

00:45:12.851 --> 00:45:16.160
against, had direct knowledge
of,

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:22.236
the perfectly straight?
Isn't it enough for me to

00:45:22.236 --> 00:45:29.309
extrapolate from cases that I do
come up against in this life?

00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:32.179
I come across things that are
bent;

00:45:32.179 --> 00:45:34.797
I come across things that are
more straight,

00:45:34.797 --> 00:45:39.247
more and more straight.
Can't my mind take off from

00:45:39.247 --> 00:45:45.427
there and push straight ahead to
the idea of the perfectly

00:45:45.427 --> 00:45:51.500
straight, even if I never have
encountered it before?

00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:01.193
Let me stop with this idea.
Even if Plato is right,

00:46:01.193 --> 00:46:05.484
that we need to have
acquaintance with the Platonic

00:46:05.484 --> 00:46:09.690
forms themselves in order to
think about them,

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:14.754
and even if Plato is right that
we never get the acquaintance in

00:46:14.754 --> 00:46:18.204
this world,
in the interaction with

00:46:18.204 --> 00:46:23.745
ordinary physical objects,
why couldn't it be that our

00:46:23.745 --> 00:46:30.018
acquaintance with the Platonic
forms comes about in this life

00:46:30.018 --> 00:46:34.126
for the very first time?
That's the question,

00:46:34.126 --> 00:46:37.085
or that's the objection,
that we'll turn to at the start

00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:38.085
of next class.

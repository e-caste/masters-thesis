00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.247
Professor David Blight:
Faster than might seem

00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:24.656
appropriate, and faster than I
wish, we've come to the

00:00:24.656 --> 00:00:31.298
secession crisis.
I wish we had another week,

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:36.630
two, three weeks,
but we don't.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.720
Martyrdom;
what is a martyr?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.470
It's a term we hear all over
the place now.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.610
There are martyrs of this cause
and martyrs of that cause.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.510
John Brown was a martyr.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.125
The most important thing about
John Brown, as I tried to say

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:06.320
the other day--and I want to
conclude with several comments

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.695
about that now--is in how he
died and in the aftermath of his

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:14.363
death.
The United States was a

00:01:14.363 --> 00:01:18.189
Christian country.
Europe was essentially a

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.642
Christian civilization.
John Brown would be filtered

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:31.229
through a Christian imagination.
Either way, whether people came

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.811
to admire and sort of
agonizingly love him,

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:42.615
or agonizingly hate him.
"John Brown's raid on Harpers

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:46.360
Ferry was all his own," said
Frederick Douglass.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.655
"His zeal in the cause of
freedom was infinitely superior

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:56.310
to mine.
Mine was a taper light,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.563
his was the burning sun.
Mine was bounded by time,

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:06.870
his stretched away to the
silent shores of eternity.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.245
I could speak for the slave.
John Brown could fight for the

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:14.729
slave.
I could live for the slave.

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.729
John Brown could die for the
slave."

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:23.390
There's a clarity in that,
among the many eulogistic

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.146
statements about John Brown and
the many that Frederick Douglass

00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:32.520
himself made.
Douglass, you'll remember,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.509
had great ambivalence about
this man and chose not to join

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.030
him on the raid at Harpers
Ferry.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.210
Now, Brown was captured in the
raid.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.594
The raid only lasted 48 hours.
It was in some ways a military

00:02:46.594 --> 00:02:48.650
strategic blunder.

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.863
He was taken to a jail four
miles from Harpers Ferry,

00:02:55.863 --> 00:02:57.180
Charlestown,
Virginia,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.822
now West Virginia,
and he would reside there for

00:03:01.822 --> 00:03:07.685
about the next six weeks.
In that period he would be put

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:13.010
on trial, the most celebrated
trial, to that point,

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.471
in American history.
There were three charges,

00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.379
all of which were punishable by
death, at least in Virginia.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.013
Treason against the United
States--it was considered

00:03:27.013 --> 00:03:31.919
treason to attack a federal
arsenal--I suppose it still

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.098
would be although we don't try
too many people for treason

00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:40.919
anymore.
Two, inciting a slave

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.712
insurrection;
a pretty serious crime in

00:03:44.712 --> 00:03:49.090
Virginia.
And third, for murder.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.030
The trial began on the 27^(th)
of October.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.828
It lasted three and a half days.
The State of Virginia famously

00:03:56.828 --> 00:04:01.517
tried to provide a lawyer for
John Brown and Brown refused

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:05.657
that State's supplied lawyer.
He laid on a cot,

00:04:05.657 --> 00:04:10.800
because of his injuries and his
wounds, in the courtroom.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.142
This would be drawn and put in
lithographs and pictures all

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:23.084
over the country.
He was eventually defended in

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:31.079
court by three Northerners,
lawyers, who came down to help.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:34.290
The closing arguments were the
31^(st) of October.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.723
The jury deliberated for
forty-five minutes,

00:04:36.723 --> 00:04:39.610
returned a verdict of guilty on
all three counts,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.938
and it was announced he would
be hung about a month later,

00:04:46.938 --> 00:04:50.410
on December 2^(nd),
1859.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.320
From November 2^(nd) to
December 2^(nd),

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.536
that one month--November 2^(nd)
was the last day in court where

00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:05.449
they sentenced him--he had one
month in jail.

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.941
He apparently won over his
jailer who found John Brown one

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:12.250
of the most fascinating
characters he had ever seen.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.802
People came from the North and
were allowed to visit him,

00:05:16.802 --> 00:05:20.033
including his wife.
From jail he wrote

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:24.011
approximately 100 letters,
all over the country,

00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:27.527
to newspapers,
to editors, to magazines,

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:31.850
to members of his family,
particularly to his wife.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.384
He was writing his own epitaph,
he was creating his own

00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:38.459
romantic legend,
he was arguing his own case.

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.220
He, of course,
had pled innocent.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.146
There are many of those letters.
I had the great privilege to

00:05:48.146 --> 00:05:50.513
read a whole batch of the
originals once,

00:05:50.513 --> 00:05:53.590
housed at, of all places,
the Pennsylvania Historical

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.582
Society.
He wrote this one to his wife,

00:05:56.582 --> 00:06:00.730
which may be indicative of
Brown's vision of his own acts

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.990
and a vision that was now going
to stick,

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.750
in some ways,
in poetry and in song.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.428
"I have been whipped," he wrote
to his wife, "as the saying

00:06:13.428 --> 00:06:18.428
goes, but am sure I can recover
all the lost capital occasioned

00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:23.509
by that disaster by only hanging
a few minutes by the neck,

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:29.074
and I feel quite determined to
make the utmost possible out of

00:06:29.074 --> 00:06:30.260
my defeat."

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.530
I love you dear,
but I can't wait to hang.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:47.211
John Brown was a troubled man,
he was a morbid man,

00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:53.351
he was an Old Testament man,
but he probably was not crazy,

00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:58.515
as so many people said at the
time, and people have said ever

00:06:58.515 --> 00:07:01.751
since.
His altruism on behalf of black

00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:06.435
people was not utterly selfless,
but he was an extraordinary

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:09.865
example of an American,
a white American,

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:14.365
who put his money where his
mouth was--he didn't have any

00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:17.820
money--put his life where his
mouth was,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.966
and took it into the South.
Now, he was executed,

00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:28.894
hung out in a field,
outside of Charlestown,

00:07:28.894 --> 00:07:34.740
Virginia, guarded by some 3,000
American troops.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.711
There were all kinds of fears
of attempts to break him out and

00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:41.120
seize him by Northern Yankee
bands.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.861
There were all kinds of threats.
There were escape plans in the

00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:46.324
newspapers.
And by the way,

00:07:46.324 --> 00:07:49.287
one of the most startling
things about the John Brown

00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:52.296
story,
once it broke--there had never

00:07:52.296 --> 00:07:57.040
been a sensation quite like this
in American newspapers.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:04.449
Here was the South's oldest,
greatest, worst fear.

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:08.787
An abolitionist from the North
with a band of men and a bunch

00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:12.762
of weapons invading the South
and trying to incite slave

00:08:12.762 --> 00:08:17.316
insurrection--they've been kind
of predicting this all along and

00:08:17.316 --> 00:08:21.461
lo and behold it happened.
In a trunk of stuff back at the

00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:24.769
farm in Maryland that he had
rented for several months,

00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:31.950
where his men had gathered,
after his capture was found a

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:38.438
whole stash of letters and maps.
The old man had kept all kinds

00:08:38.438 --> 00:08:42.913
of maps of the South.
He had maps of sections of

00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:47.276
Alabama, Georgia.
He even had x'd certain towns

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.492
on those maps.
I don't know,

00:08:49.492 --> 00:08:53.301
the old guy just liked maps.
Maybe he just stayed up at

00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:56.866
night kind of playing with his
maps, like some of us do with

00:08:56.866 --> 00:09:00.372
our Rand McNally maps when we
want to wish ourselves out of

00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:03.559
where we are.
But when these maps were found,

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:07.149
and the press got hold of
these, all over the South,

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:11.890
these stories spread and local
newspapers would print stories

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.710
about the maps of their county
or their section of a state.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:22.424
There was hysteria.
Northern teachers,

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:26.409
working in the South,
were tarred and feathered.

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:30.792
An itinerant piano tuner in
Tennessee was lynched because he

00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:34.646
was from Massachusetts.
Fear set in across the South

00:09:34.646 --> 00:09:38.853
that there were going to be
other abolition emissaries--that

00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:43.370
was always the term used.
And there were predictions and

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.740
threats of all kinds,
especially in South Carolina.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.622
John Brown when he--and he did
read some of these

00:09:51.622 --> 00:09:56.773
newspapers--must have smiled.
Now he was hung,

00:09:56.773 --> 00:10:02.720
his body was delivered to his
wife.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.991
It traveled all the way by
train, all the way up to upstate

00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:12.990
New York to North Elba,
New York where he was buried;

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.167
a site in a very remote place,
I must say, in upstate New

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:19.171
York.
They have a gathering there

00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:22.190
every year of something called
The John Brown Society.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.976
It's run by a bunch of people
from New York City,

00:10:24.976 --> 00:10:28.574
and they have an annual speaker
and an annual pilgrimage to Old

00:10:28.574 --> 00:10:31.257
John Brown's grave.
And I had the privilege one

00:10:31.257 --> 00:10:34.201
year of giving that lecture in
the courthouse where his body

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:37.440
had laid in state.
It was interesting to meet the

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.432
erstwhile folks of the John
Brown Society,

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:43.134
who are a strange and
interesting lot,

00:10:43.134 --> 00:10:47.980
I can assure you.
But it's an isolated place.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:53.596
But pilgrimages already started
happening, especially among

00:10:53.596 --> 00:10:58.534
African-Americans in the north,
to that remote site,

00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:02.019
right in the wake of his
burial.

00:11:02.019 --> 00:11:06.375
The most important thing about
John Brown's raid and John Brown

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:11.000
was the aftermath;
it's what people made of him.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.413
In the North,
certain members of that Secret

00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:15.938
Six, so called,
of white abolitionists who had

00:11:15.938 --> 00:11:19.249
served him and helped him and
raised money for him and wrote

00:11:19.249 --> 00:11:23.069
letters with him,
fled the country,

00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:28.314
some to Canada.
Frederick Douglass himself--and

00:11:28.314 --> 00:11:33.303
there were letters discovered
between Douglass and John

00:11:33.303 --> 00:11:37.000
Brown--himself will flee the
country,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.087
out of Rochester,
New York, across Lake Erie into

00:11:41.087 --> 00:11:45.174
Canada and out the St.
Lawrence River to England,

00:11:45.174 --> 00:11:49.591
because of fear of his arrest.
And there was a warrant put out

00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:52.584
for Frederick Douglass's arrest
and a Federal Marshall arrived

00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:56.816
in Rochester,
New York only about a day after

00:11:56.816 --> 00:12:01.278
Douglass left town.
Intellectuals and poets and

00:12:01.278 --> 00:12:05.008
writers in the press,
Thoreau and Whittier and

00:12:05.008 --> 00:12:07.712
Emerson,
all over the North,

00:12:07.712 --> 00:12:10.448
and in England,
and in France,

00:12:10.448 --> 00:12:15.543
began to try their hand at the
meaning of John Brown as

00:12:15.543 --> 00:12:19.701
Christian hero,
as martyr of a cause,

00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:25.974
as a man who would do that
which the rest of them would not

00:12:25.974 --> 00:12:29.796
have done.
And I want to suggest--I'm

00:12:29.796 --> 00:12:35.373
going to give you really four
arguments, just try them on--of

00:12:35.373 --> 00:12:39.400
why John Brown matters,
why he mattered then,

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.078
and why he still matters in any
discussion we have in American

00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:47.759
society about what constitutes
terrorism now,

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:49.990
what constitutes revolutionary
violence.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.759
When is a cause so just that
the means justify the end?

00:12:55.759 --> 00:13:00.300
When is violence in a moral
cause justified?

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.934
Is it ever justified?
Go answer those questions in an

00:13:03.934 --> 00:13:06.794
ethics course,
go answer those questions in a

00:13:06.794 --> 00:13:10.242
politics course,
go answer those questions in a

00:13:10.242 --> 00:13:13.634
history course,
and you have one of the hardest

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:18.514
questions of all.
Was John Brown a midnight

00:13:18.514 --> 00:13:23.279
terrorist or a revolutionary
hero?

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:26.779
John Brown's a very troubling
legacy.

00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:31.699
Nobody should prettify him and
nobody should utterly dismiss

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:34.129
him.
I'd say he leaves us with four

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:37.455
essential questions;
and you can add to this if you

00:13:37.455 --> 00:13:39.686
want.
First, he really makes us face

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:42.320
this question of the meaning of
martyrdom.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.600
What is a martyr?
How do we define a martyr?

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.710
What constitutes the values or
elements of martyrdom?

00:13:53.710 --> 00:14:01.563
Two, how do we deal with
revolutionary violence,

00:14:01.563 --> 00:14:08.754
in history or today?
When can a cause be just--as I

00:14:08.754 --> 00:14:16.017
just said earlier--so just that
violence in its name is somehow

00:14:16.017 --> 00:14:19.998
justified?
Three--and here I'm going to

00:14:19.998 --> 00:14:25.002
give you a list within the
list--I think John Brown is our

00:14:25.002 --> 00:14:29.304
template in American
history--there are others you

00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:32.748
could point to,
the leaders of the Haymarket

00:14:32.748 --> 00:14:36.593
Riot.
There are many other cases in

00:14:36.593 --> 00:14:44.039
our history of people who acted
in a cause and used violence.

00:14:44.039 --> 00:14:49.033
But John Brown forces us to
face the almost natural

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:55.420
ambivalences about his acts.
He is disturbing and inspiring.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:00.136
Note all these opposites.
He in some ways worked for the

00:15:00.136 --> 00:15:05.659
highest ideals--human freedom
and the idea of equality--but he

00:15:05.659 --> 00:15:09.009
also used the most ruthless
deeds.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:11.022
There's a certain majesty about
his character,

00:15:11.022 --> 00:15:13.302
at least in the aftermath,
but there's also a lot of

00:15:13.302 --> 00:15:17.549
folly.
He was a monster, to some.

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:21.680
To others he's a saint,
he's a warrior saint.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:29.549
He killed for justice.
When does that work for you?

00:15:29.549 --> 00:15:33.658
He was a great example of what
had been brewing all over the

00:15:33.658 --> 00:15:37.766
culture, by the 1850s.
We've talked about this over

00:15:37.766 --> 00:15:41.596
and over, of this struggle
between human law,

00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:46.871
law fashioned in Congress,
law fashioned by people,

00:15:46.871 --> 00:15:52.892
and the so-called higher law.
When do you abide by a higher

00:15:52.892 --> 00:15:56.009
law than the laws of your
society?

00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:59.090
When is it just to break human
law in the name of higher law?

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:05.702
Who decides?
And lastly, I think he's one of

00:16:05.702 --> 00:16:13.450
those avengers of history who do
the work other people won't,

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.420
can't, or shouldn't.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.265
"Men consented to his death,"
said Frederick Douglass in one

00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:27.889
of those eulogy speeches much
later,

00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:32.028
in 1880, "Men consented to his
death and then went home and

00:16:32.028 --> 00:16:35.240
taught their children to honor
his memory."

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.436
And then fourth,
that last question that's

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:48.355
always laying out there.
John Brown was a white man who

00:16:48.355 --> 00:16:52.029
killed white people to free
black people.

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:54.519
And that's actually one of his
deepest legacies.

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:57.447
In my first years of teaching
in a big urban high school in

00:16:57.447 --> 00:16:59.668
Flint, Michigan,
I taught lots of young black

00:16:59.668 --> 00:17:01.889
people who thought John Brown
was black.

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:06.545
They had been taught that he
was black, sometimes in

00:17:06.545 --> 00:17:08.720
churches.
There's a church in

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.862
Springfield, Massachusetts,
that John Brown went to,

00:17:11.862 --> 00:17:15.250
attended--they say he was a
member--it's called the John

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.885
Brown Church and there's some
people there you still have to

00:17:18.885 --> 00:17:21.660
convince that he was white.
Does it matter?

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:28.078
Why does it matter?
Why has John Brown been such a

00:17:28.078 --> 00:17:34.161
romantic hero in black culture,
in poetry, in painting,

00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:37.172
in song?
Michael Harper,

00:17:37.172 --> 00:17:41.664
the great modern
African-American poet,

00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:46.509
has a little line in one of his
poems.

00:17:46.509 --> 00:17:52.160
The poem is called "History and
Captain Brown."

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.994
And the line is,
"Come to the crusade,

00:17:56.994 --> 00:18:04.049
not as negroes but as brothers,
like Brother Brown."

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:09.419
Well, you can try all those
questions on and if you come up

00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:13.400
with some perfect answers do let
me know.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.188
But before we leave John Brown
I want to leave you with my

00:18:18.188 --> 00:18:23.229
favorite passage ever written
about the meaning and memory of

00:18:23.229 --> 00:18:27.816
John Brown,
and you can see if it fits or

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.059
not.
It's in a speech by W.E.B.

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:33.783
DuBois, the greatest black
scholar, writer of the twentieth

00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:37.102
century.
DuBois gave a speech about John

00:18:37.102 --> 00:18:42.244
Brown at Harpers Ferry in 1932.
They were dedicating a plaque

00:18:42.244 --> 00:18:47.301
memorial--this had been done
before--but they were dedicating

00:18:47.301 --> 00:18:52.190
yet another sort of John Brown
marker at Harpers Ferry.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.012
And the ending of that speech,
I think it's the most poignant

00:18:57.012 --> 00:19:01.914
thing anybody ever said about
John Brown, and it's why he's so

00:19:01.914 --> 00:19:07.009
troubling.
This is DuBois's ending.

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:10.013
"Some people have the idea that
crucifixion consists in the

00:19:10.013 --> 00:19:13.874
punishment of an innocent man.
The essence of crucifixion is

00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:18.740
that men are killing a criminal,
that men have got to kill him,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.858
and yet that the act of
crucifying him is the salvation

00:19:23.858 --> 00:19:27.341
of the world.
John Brown broke the law,

00:19:27.341 --> 00:19:31.397
he killed human beings.
Those people who defended

00:19:31.397 --> 00:19:36.133
slavery had to execute John
Brown, although they knew that

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:40.869
in killing him they were
committing the greater crime.

00:19:40.869 --> 00:19:46.294
It is out of that human paradox
that there comes any

00:19:46.294 --> 00:19:47.890
crucifixion."

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.170
Okay, good morning.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.970
Sermon is over.
I've named my text.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:13.383
Now let's do some history.
The raid on Harpers Ferry and

00:20:13.383 --> 00:20:22.392
the execution of John Brown,
of course, came----on the eve

00:20:22.392 --> 00:20:32.349
of an extremely pivotal American
election, to say the least.

00:20:32.349 --> 00:20:36.191
You all know the Republican
Party had a good showing in 1856

00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:38.600
and nearly won,
its first time out.

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:43.220
Now what will this Republican
Party be by 1860?

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.410
How will it threaten the South?
Will it threaten the South?

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.880
John Brown's raid on Harpers
Ferry and his execution were a

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.505
template, all into that next
spring as the American political

00:20:56.505 --> 00:21:00.821
culture held its conventions and
nominated candidates and

00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:05.214
prepared for an election that
now people said might decide

00:21:05.214 --> 00:21:09.299
whether the Union would hold
together or not.

00:21:09.299 --> 00:21:12.239
The Democrats held their
convention in

00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:16.846
late-April/early-May in the
worst possible place they could

00:21:16.846 --> 00:21:18.865
hold it.
They had scheduled it well

00:21:18.865 --> 00:21:20.710
ahead of time in Charleston,
South Carolina.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:26.275
Charleston was a hotbed of
Southern rights and Southern

00:21:26.275 --> 00:21:31.738
nationalism, if you want to call
it that, and Southern

00:21:31.738 --> 00:21:36.625
secessionism--already it was.
Now, the front running

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:40.542
candidate of the Democratic
Party by 1860--and this man had

00:21:40.542 --> 00:21:44.190
been working for this for a
decade and a half--was,

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.529
of course, Stephen Douglas of
Illinois;

00:21:47.529 --> 00:21:51.559
the same Stephen Douglas of
Popular Sovereignty fame.

00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:57.049
But Stephen Douglas had made
one slip-up.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:22:00.079
Well he'd made more than one
but he'd made one,

00:22:00.079 --> 00:22:03.636
two really big slip-ups in
terms of his fellow Southern

00:22:03.636 --> 00:22:07.719
Democrats--and he's by far the
most prestigious person in their

00:22:07.719 --> 00:22:10.097
party.
But in one of his debates with

00:22:10.097 --> 00:22:12.583
Abraham Lincoln,
one of those incredible debates

00:22:12.583 --> 00:22:14.961
with Lincoln,
the one in Freeport,

00:22:14.961 --> 00:22:18.255
Illinois-- and much ado was
made about this,

00:22:18.255 --> 00:22:22.789
it was almost a throwaway line,
although it wasn't thrown

00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:27.109
away--Lincoln pushed Douglas and
he said, "Do you mean,

00:22:27.109 --> 00:22:30.470
then, Judge Douglas," as he
always called him,

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.009
he would never call him
Senator,

00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:35.210
"Judge Douglas do you mean then
that if the people who settle

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.818
the Western Territory,
your popular sovereignty

00:22:37.818 --> 00:22:41.779
business, that really means the
folks can vote it out,

00:22:41.779 --> 00:22:44.289
right, in spite of what the
Dred Scott decision says?

00:22:44.289 --> 00:22:47.702
The Dred Scott decision just
said that because of the Fifth

00:22:47.702 --> 00:22:50.996
Amendment you cannot stop a
person from taking his slaves

00:22:50.996 --> 00:22:53.517
anywhere he wants."
And Lincoln says,

00:22:53.517 --> 00:22:57.569
"But Judge, what's that done to
your popular sovereignty?"

00:22:57.569 --> 00:23:00.516
And Douglas said,
"Well the people can still

00:23:00.516 --> 00:23:04.423
vote, and if the people vote
slavery out then they vote it

00:23:04.423 --> 00:23:05.952
out."
And his fellow Southern

00:23:05.952 --> 00:23:08.254
Democrats immediately started
writing to him and wiring him

00:23:08.254 --> 00:23:10.599
and saying,
"Wait a minute Stephen,

00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:15.190
do we live in the land of the
Dred Scott decision or not?"

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:20.816
It became known to Southern
Democrats as the so-called

00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:24.907
Freeport Doctrine.
And Douglas kept trying to

00:23:24.907 --> 00:23:26.950
dance around it,
avoid it.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.036
In opposition to the so-called
Freeport Doctrine and in

00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:35.274
opposition to Douglas at this
Southern--at the Democratic

00:23:35.274 --> 00:23:39.814
Party convention--and by the way
that Democratic party is--by

00:23:39.814 --> 00:23:44.279
anyone with his eyes open--the
only truly national political

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:49.047
party left in America.
The hope of saving the Union,

00:23:49.047 --> 00:23:54.130
just in a political sense,
by 1860 was with the Democrats.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.349
This Republican Party,
as we're soon to see,

00:23:58.349 --> 00:24:02.569
was a Northern party,
almost exclusively.

00:24:02.569 --> 00:24:07.278
Countering Douglas,
Southern Democrats--led by none

00:24:07.278 --> 00:24:11.548
other than Jefferson Davis,
a Senator from Mississippi at

00:24:11.548 --> 00:24:14.359
that point, a long distinguished
member of Congress,

00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:18.231
Secretary of War,
commandant at West Point and so

00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:23.231
on--they came up with what they
now called a Slave Code for the

00:24:23.231 --> 00:24:26.779
Territories--that's what they
called it.

00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:30.926
And that Slave Code for the
Territories was now to be a

00:24:30.926 --> 00:24:35.680
protection in the Constitution,
an explicit protection in the

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.814
Constitution of slave ownership
anywhere in the Western

00:24:39.814 --> 00:24:42.569
Territories of the United
States.

00:24:42.569 --> 00:24:46.738
They wanted,
in essence, not just the Dred

00:24:46.738 --> 00:24:50.500
Scott decision,
Supreme Court case,

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.811
they wanted a federal--they
wanted not just the repeal of

00:24:53.811 --> 00:24:56.650
the Kansas-Nebraska Act
geographical division,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.525
not just the Dred Scott case
which said a person has a right

00:25:00.525 --> 00:25:02.890
to take slaves anywhere they
wish,

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:07.493
they wanted a explicit federal
guarantee of the right to slave

00:25:07.493 --> 00:25:12.323
ownership, and they wanted it to
be a Constitutional Amendment if

00:25:12.323 --> 00:25:17.055
necessary.
Now, this is why the Democratic

00:25:17.055 --> 00:25:21.680
Party tore itself apart at
Charleston.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.145
They had a two-thirds rule.
So even though Stephen Douglas

00:25:26.145 --> 00:25:30.507
did muster a small majority of
support in the first balloting,

00:25:30.507 --> 00:25:33.009
he could not win the
nomination.

00:25:33.009 --> 00:25:37.140
And when Douglas's supporters
managed to pass a platform

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.269
without the so-called Slave Code
for the Territories,

00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:45.662
southern delegates of eight
states--they'd all prepared for

00:25:45.662 --> 00:25:48.539
this--stalked out of the
convention.

00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:52.211
The convention ended,
they nominated nobody,

00:25:52.211 --> 00:25:56.822
and they split into two
parties, the Southern Democrats

00:25:56.822 --> 00:26:03.145
and the Northern Democrats.
And everybody knows that when a

00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:08.361
party does this,
it almost guarantees it will

00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:14.289
lose, and they did.
The Southern Democrats agreed

00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:20.930
to reconvene in Baltimore on
June 18^(th) and--I'm sorry,

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.647
the Northern Democrats
reconvened, the so-called

00:26:23.647 --> 00:26:26.885
official Democratic Party
reconvened at Baltimore on June

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:30.079
18.
They nominated Stephen Douglas,

00:26:30.079 --> 00:26:33.047
no surprise.
They called themselves the

00:26:33.047 --> 00:26:36.296
National Democrats.
The Southern Democrats,

00:26:36.296 --> 00:26:40.758
of those eight southern
states--it's the Deep South--met

00:26:40.758 --> 00:26:45.707
in Richmond, Virginia shortly
after that and nominated John C.

00:26:45.707 --> 00:26:50.088
Breckenridge of Kentucky--a
slaveholder but a moderate,

00:26:50.088 --> 00:26:54.470
known to be kind of an old
Henry Clay moderate,

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:59.955
although he'd never been a
Whig--to be their candidate for

00:26:59.955 --> 00:27:03.184
President.
And by the end of June,

00:27:03.184 --> 00:27:07.242
1860, the Democratic Party had
two candidates:

00:27:07.242 --> 00:27:10.760
Breckenridge,
the Southern Democrat;

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:16.546
Douglas, the Northern Democrat.
Now, the Republican Party had

00:27:16.546 --> 00:27:19.771
its convention in Chicago.
It was an extraordinary

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.257
convention.
There'd never been one quite

00:27:22.257 --> 00:27:26.250
like it in American history.
It was raucous.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.144
There were just parades and
waves of people,

00:27:29.144 --> 00:27:32.308
sometimes hired,
sometimes induced in by lots of

00:27:32.308 --> 00:27:35.269
drink to come into the so-called
wigwam,

00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:38.680
which was this big convention
hall of a kind they had

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.661
constructed in Chicago.
It was sometimes called the

00:27:41.661 --> 00:27:44.543
Shouters Convention because
these people were sort of hired

00:27:44.543 --> 00:27:46.680
to shout for one candidate or
the other.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.519
What fun and nonsense it must
have been.

00:27:50.519 --> 00:27:53.817
The leading candidate of the
Republicans, of course,

00:27:53.817 --> 00:27:55.369
was William H.
Seward.

00:27:55.369 --> 00:28:00.725
Seward of New York,
long term time senator from New

00:28:00.725 --> 00:28:06.509
York, had strong anti-slavery
credentials as a good,

00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:09.488
solid, free soiler,
and, indeed,

00:28:09.488 --> 00:28:13.619
even had fairly strong
abolitionist ties.

00:28:13.619 --> 00:28:18.330
And he'd been there at the
creation of the Republican

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.950
Party, and he had a kind of a
machine, of a sort.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:27.476
But there was this strange
insurgency out of Illinois

00:28:27.476 --> 00:28:31.480
behind a favorite son named
Abraham Lincoln,

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.964
who wasn't all that well known,
even though he had become

00:28:33.964 --> 00:28:36.759
fairly well known in his run
against Stephen Douglas in 1858;

00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:40.386
but of course he'd lost that
election, narrowly,

00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:43.924
to Douglas in '58.
He'd had one term in the U.S.

00:28:43.924 --> 00:28:47.980
House back in the late 1840s
during the Mexican War and then

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.799
he lost on his attempt at
re-election.

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:54.026
Two years in the House of
Representatives,

00:28:54.026 --> 00:28:58.039
a rather inexperienced,
but--it turns out--brilliant

00:28:58.039 --> 00:29:00.611
politician.
The platform of that Republican

00:29:00.611 --> 00:29:02.990
Party, which was very
important--in these years people

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.009
were reading platforms,
believe it or not.

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:09.160
Today, platforms,
schmatforms--right?

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.779
Southerners were really reading
the Republican Party platform.

00:29:13.779 --> 00:29:19.442
The platform of 1860 was a
little broader and had somewhat

00:29:19.442 --> 00:29:25.303
more moderate appeals in it than
their 1856 deeply free soil

00:29:25.303 --> 00:29:29.539
platform had had.
They made big appeals in 1860

00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:33.022
to create higher federal
tariffs, to create free

00:29:33.022 --> 00:29:37.617
homestead law in the West--these
were all appeals to the common

00:29:37.617 --> 00:29:40.730
man--and to the rights of
immigrants,

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:45.506
because the Republicans were
now successful by the late 1850s

00:29:45.506 --> 00:29:49.009
at all but dissolving that
Nativist Party,

00:29:49.009 --> 00:29:50.903
the Know-Nothings,
or the American Party,

00:29:50.903 --> 00:29:53.269
and were drawing most
nativists--not quite all--but

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:55.400
most nativists into the
Republican Party,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.231
and they'd managed this strange
marriage or a kind of a

00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:03.276
pro-immigrant platform at the
same time they're attracting

00:30:03.276 --> 00:30:07.534
nativists who are as worried
about slavery as they were about

00:30:07.534 --> 00:30:10.894
Catholics.
They appealed to a certain

00:30:10.894 --> 00:30:15.599
anti-Southern feeling,
there's no question about that.

00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:20.045
Now, Lincoln got the nomination
largely because,

00:30:20.045 --> 00:30:24.963
well, one, the convention was
held in his home state;

00:30:24.963 --> 00:30:29.125
two, William H.
Seward had made a fair number

00:30:29.125 --> 00:30:33.759
of enemies around the Republican
coalition.

00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:37.270
He was in the limelight too
long, in a sense,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.818
you could argue politically,
and a lot of Republicans were

00:30:41.818 --> 00:30:46.365
looking for a candidate who
seemed more moderate than that

00:30:46.365 --> 00:30:49.766
abolitionist Seward.
They wanted to run in this

00:30:49.766 --> 00:30:52.928
election in a way that the Upper
South, maybe the border states

00:30:52.928 --> 00:30:55.923
would actually support them.
And this Lincoln,

00:30:55.923 --> 00:31:00.494
after all he was born in
Kentucky, he's kind of a border

00:31:00.494 --> 00:31:06.160
state guy himself;
Seward's just a Yankee.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.858
So there's a certain irony in
that Lincoln got some support

00:31:10.858 --> 00:31:14.180
because he wasn't seen as
abolitionist.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.369
Now, that isn't necessarily as
true.

00:31:17.369 --> 00:31:21.527
Lincoln was on record all over
the place as saying such things

00:31:21.527 --> 00:31:24.920
as he had in 1859.
I quote him.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:30.103
"Republicans believe that
slavery is wrong and they insist

00:31:30.103 --> 00:31:35.105
and will continue to insist upon
a national policy which

00:31:35.105 --> 00:31:39.380
recognizes it and deals with it
as a wrong.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:46.340
There can be no letting down on
this."

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.410
It's reasonably clear language.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.864
This is Matthew Brady's famous
photographs that he took on the

00:32:07.864 --> 00:32:11.670
day of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper
Union Speech in New York,

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.693
the speech that introduced
Lincoln to the East and

00:32:14.693 --> 00:32:18.086
according to Harold Holzer in a
recent book made Lincoln

00:32:18.086 --> 00:32:21.665
president.
Now that's a bit overstated but

00:32:21.665 --> 00:32:25.520
it's pre-beard,
he didn't grow the beard till

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.567
the next year.
But the crisis was so serious

00:32:28.567 --> 00:32:30.501
now, with this Northern
anti-slavery,

00:32:30.501 --> 00:32:32.793
free soil,
Republican Party,

00:32:32.793 --> 00:32:37.760
two Democratic Parties,
one Southern and one Northern,

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.823
splitting themselves,
that a group of American

00:32:41.823 --> 00:32:45.148
politicos got together
practically overnight,

00:32:45.148 --> 00:32:50.647
late that summer,
1860, and decided to run yet a

00:32:50.647 --> 00:32:54.808
fourth candidate.
His name was John Bell of

00:32:54.808 --> 00:32:58.698
Tennessee, and they called
themselves the Constitutional

00:32:58.698 --> 00:33:02.452
Union Party.
They drew together some old

00:33:02.452 --> 00:33:04.695
Whigs.
The Whig Party doesn't exist

00:33:04.695 --> 00:33:08.008
anymore, there's still some old
Whigs looking for a political

00:33:08.008 --> 00:33:10.756
home.
They drew some Nativists and

00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:14.051
Know-Nothings,
and they drew border state

00:33:14.051 --> 00:33:18.993
people who were just frightened
of how this mess was possibly

00:33:18.993 --> 00:33:24.142
going to destroy the Union.
Their platform was extremely

00:33:24.142 --> 00:33:26.682
simple.
They pledged themselves simply

00:33:26.682 --> 00:33:30.450
to, quote, "defense of the Union
and enforcement of the law."

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:36.252
Now, who could be against that?
They were for the Union and

00:33:36.252 --> 00:33:38.530
law, both nice things.

00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:47.834
And, almost unbelievably,
this party had quite a few

00:33:47.834 --> 00:33:51.267
followers, overnight.
Now, when the election

00:33:51.267 --> 00:33:54.470
came--and I'll go back to the
map if you'll forgive me.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.130
It's worth looking at some
quick numbers,

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:10.785
more than worth it.
This is one of the great

00:34:10.785 --> 00:34:13.179
four-way races for the
presidency in American history.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:18.203
We've only had really one or
two other four-ways--1912 was a

00:34:18.203 --> 00:34:19.686
four-way.
And, of course,

00:34:19.686 --> 00:34:21.616
that guarantees almost you're
going to have a minority

00:34:21.616 --> 00:34:23.833
president;
that is, the one who wins is

00:34:23.833 --> 00:34:27.244
not going to win a majority.
And that's exactly what

00:34:27.244 --> 00:34:30.802
happened in this case.
Now Abraham Lincoln,

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:35.097
the Republican,
was not even on the ballot in

00:34:35.097 --> 00:34:38.656
ten Slave states.
The Republicans weren't even

00:34:38.656 --> 00:34:41.179
put on the ballot in all of the
Deep South.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.994
Lincoln carried all of the
Northern states,

00:34:43.994 --> 00:34:47.412
and all of their electoral
votes except three in New

00:34:47.412 --> 00:34:49.661
Jersey.
Breckenridge,

00:34:49.661 --> 00:34:55.474
the Southern Democrat,
carried all the Slave states

00:34:55.474 --> 00:35:00.241
except parts of the Upper
South--Virginia,

00:35:00.241 --> 00:35:04.659
Kentucky, Tennessee and
Missouri.

00:35:04.659 --> 00:35:06.980
I don't know how well you can
see that on that map.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.191
John Bell, the Constitutional
Union candidate--this overnight

00:35:12.191 --> 00:35:13.777
party that just said "please,
save the Union,

00:35:13.777 --> 00:35:17.067
whatever it takes;
we need a new national

00:35:17.067 --> 00:35:23.197
compromise"--Bell won Virginia,
Kentucky,and Tennessee,

00:35:23.197 --> 00:35:26.220
Upper South.
Stephen Douglas,

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.841
who'd been kind of running for
president in his heart for

00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:33.564
fifteen years,
won only one state,

00:35:33.564 --> 00:35:37.086
Missouri.
Lincoln received only 26,000

00:35:37.086 --> 00:35:40.889
votes in the South,
in all the Slave states.

00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:49.929
He received only about forty of
the total raw vote.

00:35:49.929 --> 00:35:53.818
Sixty percent of Americans who
voted in 1860--and they voted in

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.214
huge percentages,
seventy-five,

00:35:56.214 --> 00:36:01.683
eight percent turnout--sixty
percent of all those who voted,

00:36:01.683 --> 00:36:05.019
did not vote for Abraham
Lincoln.

00:36:05.019 --> 00:36:08.768
But he was elected,
and now, of course,

00:36:08.768 --> 00:36:13.010
the question was what would the
South do,

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:16.828
with all this rhetoric about
Southern unity and the

00:36:16.828 --> 00:36:18.890
possibility of secession.

00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:46.218
Well, the Secession Crisis is
an unprecedented moment in

00:36:46.218 --> 00:36:51.019
American history and happily we
haven't quite had it since.

00:36:51.019 --> 00:36:54.389
There are always rumors of
Texas wanting to secede and the

00:36:54.389 --> 00:36:57.049
upper peninsula of Michigan
wanting to secede,

00:36:57.049 --> 00:36:59.650
but nobody quite does secession
anymore.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.331
We got a lot of States Rights
going on but we don't

00:37:02.331 --> 00:37:09.000
necessarily do secession.
Would the South really do it?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.159
Now, Lincoln made one thing
clear within his party.

00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:17.453
He made almost no public
appearances after the Election

00:37:17.453 --> 00:37:21.125
of 1860, into that winter.
Inaugurations were not held in

00:37:21.125 --> 00:37:23.679
the nineteenth century until
March, as you may know.

00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:28.880
The interregnum was a long
time, four or five months.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.219
This was the secession winter
of 1860/61.

00:37:33.219 --> 00:37:36.712
But he made one thing very
clear within his party circles,

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:39.775
and there's quote after quote
about this in private

00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:42.905
correspondence.
He said whatever the South

00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:46.610
does, that he wanted the
Republican Party to stand

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:52.060
absolutely firm on one thing,
and that was opposition at all

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:57.010
costs to the expansion of
slavery into the West.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.370
He said that was the reason to
be, that was why they came into

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.769
existence, that is what they had
been arguing for six years,

00:38:01.769 --> 00:38:08.039
and they would not give up that
line, as he put it.

00:38:08.039 --> 00:38:12.218
On December 20^(th),
1860, South Carolina held a

00:38:12.218 --> 00:38:17.551
Secession Convention--December
20^(th)--and voted unanimously

00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:23.130
to secede from the Union.
They said in that act that they

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:28.840
were, quote, "not in rebellion
against the United States."

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.195
They said they were only
exercising, quote,

00:38:32.195 --> 00:38:36.110
their "sovereign power as a
state to withdraw."

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:40.013
They rooted their secession,
as they always had rooted state

00:38:40.013 --> 00:38:44.116
sovereignty and State's Rights
positions in the old notion of a

00:38:44.116 --> 00:38:48.858
compact theory of government,
that which a state chooses to

00:38:48.858 --> 00:38:53.886
join, and a central government
it shall have the right and

00:38:53.886 --> 00:38:57.860
power to withdraw from.
But the question now was,

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:01.059
would anybody join them?
And, by the way,

00:39:01.059 --> 00:39:05.619
they declared themselves the
Palmetto Republic.

00:39:05.619 --> 00:39:08.699
But would anybody join South
Carolina?

00:39:08.699 --> 00:39:11.659
And this is where your book,
by Charles Dew,

00:39:11.659 --> 00:39:15.031
Apostles of Disunion,
comes right into play

00:39:15.031 --> 00:39:18.815
here--that wonderfully short and
I think quite brilliant

00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:22.807
treatment of the secession
commissioners--as South Carolina

00:39:22.807 --> 00:39:27.142
was the first state to send out
secession commissioners to other

00:39:27.142 --> 00:39:30.789
states in the Deep South and
basically say,

00:39:30.789 --> 00:39:34.558
"Please join us,
we're hanging out on this limb,

00:39:34.558 --> 00:39:38.406
it's scary out here,
and here are the reasons you

00:39:38.406 --> 00:39:41.477
should join us."
The next state to go though

00:39:41.477 --> 00:39:43.760
wasn't until the Ninth of
January of '61.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.518
It was Mississippi.
Mississippi held a Secession

00:39:48.518 --> 00:39:51.570
Convention.
And then several Deep South

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.783
states fell like dominoes.
The next day,

00:39:54.783 --> 00:39:59.469
January 10, Florida seceded;
Alabama on January 11;

00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:03.461
Georgia--I'm going to come back
to Georgia in just a second

00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:07.796
because it's a very interesting
case--Georgia on January 19 in a

00:40:07.796 --> 00:40:13.405
very divided vote;
Louisiana on January 26 and

00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:17.946
Texas on February 1.
By February 1,1861,

00:40:17.946 --> 00:40:21.514
the seven states of the Deep
South--South Carolina,

00:40:21.514 --> 00:40:23.198
Georgia,
Florida, Alabama,

00:40:23.198 --> 00:40:25.155
Mississippi,
Louisiana, and Texas--had

00:40:25.155 --> 00:40:28.338
seceded from the Union.
They declared themselves the

00:40:28.338 --> 00:40:31.810
Confederate States of America.
They met at their first

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.878
declared capital of Montgomery,
Alabama and they,

00:40:34.878 --> 00:40:38.241
in effect,
appointed--there was no general

00:40:38.241 --> 00:40:42.570
election at first--they
appointed--the representatives

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:46.980
of the states--appointed
Jefferson Davis of Mississippi

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.636
as their President.
By the time Lincoln would take

00:40:51.636 --> 00:40:56.491
office in the first week of
March and deliver his first

00:40:56.491 --> 00:41:01.468
inaugural,
seven states of the Deep South

00:41:01.468 --> 00:41:12.010
had formed a new government.
Now, why did they do it?

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.349
I'm going to have to leave
you--we have about seven,

00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:16.321
eight minutes,
which is great--and I want to

00:41:16.321 --> 00:41:19.257
focus briefly on Georgia to show
you that secession was no simple

00:41:19.257 --> 00:41:23.185
process in many of these states,
and there was great division,

00:41:23.185 --> 00:41:27.255
which we will see later,
kind of, come out of its shell

00:41:27.255 --> 00:41:30.957
in the midst of the war,
and to some extent,

00:41:30.957 --> 00:41:34.937
afterwards in Reconstruction.
And then I want to at least

00:41:34.937 --> 00:41:37.631
leave you today with some
explanations of why secession

00:41:37.631 --> 00:41:42.001
happened,
interpretations we've developed

00:41:42.001 --> 00:41:46.989
over the years of why the South
seceded.

00:41:46.989 --> 00:41:50.400
And I may have to leave you
hanging as to just what happened

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.539
to the rest of the South and so
on.

00:41:52.539 --> 00:41:56.224
But the Upper South doesn't
budge, and there are many

00:41:56.224 --> 00:41:59.242
reasons for that--Virginia,
North Carolina,

00:41:59.242 --> 00:42:01.743
Tennessee, Kentucky,
Arkansas and so on,

00:42:01.743 --> 00:42:04.630
Maryland--there are many
reasons for that.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:08.931
There was a somewhat less
strong attachment to slavery in

00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:12.618
many of these regions,
especially in the mountain

00:42:12.618 --> 00:42:15.241
regions.
There were much more closer

00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:19.023
economic ties to the North that
now caused a whole variety of

00:42:19.023 --> 00:42:22.490
fears of what's going to happen
if there's conflict,

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:26.848
or two countries, or war.
Fear that the war would

00:42:26.848 --> 00:42:29.514
actually happen,
if there was war,

00:42:29.514 --> 00:42:34.442
on their soil--you didn't have
to be too bright to figure that

00:42:34.442 --> 00:42:37.187
out.
And many people in the Upper

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:41.078
South, some of whom have
actually voted for Bell in the

00:42:41.078 --> 00:42:45.890
Constitutional Union Party,
still had faith that somehow

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.110
America would reach a
compromise.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:53.409
That the party system would
somehow work this through.

00:42:53.409 --> 00:42:57.518
This was a very difficult
patch, but they'd work it

00:42:57.518 --> 00:43:00.099
through.
And there was a spirit,

00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:04.614
especially in the Upper South,
at first, and some of this in

00:43:04.614 --> 00:43:07.139
Georgia, too,
to wait for '64.

00:43:07.139 --> 00:43:10.894
Wait four years,
let this Lincoln Republican

00:43:10.894 --> 00:43:14.650
Party have its way for awhile,
we'll see.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.768
We, they would say,
still have a majority on the

00:43:17.768 --> 00:43:18.830
Supreme Court.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:29.150
Now explanations.
Now Georgia,

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:32.528
we can't leave Georgia,
because Georgia's secession

00:43:32.528 --> 00:43:35.771
vote was fascinating,
and that's what this map in

00:43:35.771 --> 00:43:38.959
some ways shows you.
I don't know if you can see

00:43:38.959 --> 00:43:42.347
this very well but the darker
greenish color up there--is that

00:43:42.347 --> 00:43:46.782
green to you or blue?
And the rest is kind of a puke

00:43:46.782 --> 00:43:48.986
yellow.
Those bluish,

00:43:48.986 --> 00:43:54.176
greenish regions are the
regions that tended to be

00:43:54.176 --> 00:43:58.586
against secession.
They're the regions that had

00:43:58.586 --> 00:44:01.680
the least slavery.
They're the mountainous regions.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:07.022
They're the upland regions.
And we've now had detailed

00:44:07.022 --> 00:44:10.452
studies of secession done,
and state by state--especially

00:44:10.452 --> 00:44:12.901
in Georgia,
in North Carolina,

00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:18.028
Alabama, other places--that
show us that by far the highest

00:44:18.028 --> 00:44:23.244
support for secession was in
those counties or those regions

00:44:23.244 --> 00:44:26.780
with the largest numbers of
slaves.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.170
And this is where Charles Dew
fits right in.

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:32.496
Read him closely.
What are those secession

00:44:32.496 --> 00:44:35.406
commissioners arguing when they
go from Alabama up to Tennessee

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:37.659
to try to convince the Tennessee
Legislature?

00:44:37.659 --> 00:44:41.811
Or the South Carolina Secession
Commissioner going to Virginia

00:44:41.811 --> 00:44:45.010
and sitting down in the Virginia
State House,

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.460
the Virginia Legislature and
arguing with these people,

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.320
"Come join us,
come joins us."

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.811
What do they argue?
And he's got document after

00:44:50.811 --> 00:44:53.640
document.
They're arguing for the

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.210
preservation of white security,
of white supremacy.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:01.570
They're arguing for the
preservation of a slave economy.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:05.873
They're arguing for the
preservation of white political

00:45:05.873 --> 00:45:08.932
supremacy.
They're arguing for resistance

00:45:08.932 --> 00:45:13.136
against any semblance that those
Republicans in the North may

00:45:13.136 --> 00:45:16.150
somehow represent about racial
equality.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:20.045
They're arguing for the
preservation of a slave labor

00:45:20.045 --> 00:45:23.396
system.
Put simply, they're arguing for

00:45:23.396 --> 00:45:26.590
the preservation of a slave
society.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:32.790
Was secession about slavery?
Read Charles Dew.

00:45:37.599 --> 00:45:41.550
All right, in the three minutes
I have, let me leave you with

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.030
some arguments.
Why did the South secede?

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:03.788
One, is what we might simply
call, what I've just argued,

00:46:03.788 --> 00:46:08.110
the preservation of a slave
society,

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:12.249
the preservation of a slave
system, the preservation of a

00:46:12.249 --> 00:46:16.537
certain kind of racial control
over a society that they now

00:46:16.537 --> 00:46:19.420
greatly feared would be
threatened.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.052
And this is,
in part, what happened in

00:46:21.052 --> 00:46:23.611
Georgia in their divided vote,
because in Georgia the upper

00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:26.127
counties of Georgia,
those more hilly,

00:46:26.127 --> 00:46:30.415
mountainous regions of north
Georgia, voted against

00:46:30.415 --> 00:46:34.320
secession.
The vote on secession in

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.320
Georgia on January 19,1861 was
166 to 130.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.116
130 of those people who were
elected to go to the Georgia

00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:46.710
Secession Convention as
delegates voted against it.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:50.329
And here was the theory that
was at stake.

00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:54.973
It was really an argument
between waiting till '64,

00:46:54.973 --> 00:46:59.059
or the argument used by
Southern slaveholders

00:46:59.059 --> 00:47:04.165
now--people from south Georgia,
and all over the Deep South--it

00:47:04.165 --> 00:47:06.380
was the theory of a shrinking
south.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:09.755
And I really do believe this is
one of the most compelling

00:47:09.755 --> 00:47:13.072
arguments they had about
secession and it's why they were

00:47:13.072 --> 00:47:16.093
able to muster enough folks to
go with them in their

00:47:16.093 --> 00:47:19.056
revolution.
The theory of a shrinking south

00:47:19.056 --> 00:47:22.400
was the idea that if the
Republicans gained control of

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.239
the federal government--through
patronage,

00:47:25.239 --> 00:47:27.247
through nominations to the
Supreme Court,

00:47:27.247 --> 00:47:29.906
through the much high numbers
they had in the House of

00:47:29.906 --> 00:47:32.837
Representatives,
and even now with California

00:47:32.837 --> 00:47:35.041
and so on, maybe even in the
U.S.

00:47:35.041 --> 00:47:39.310
Senate--that eventually--and if
they close off the expansion of

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:42.340
slavery in the West,
what does that do?

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:46.430
It cordons off and it contains
and it begins to smother

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.460
Southern society and the slave
system.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.660
And the theory was that on the
rim of the South,

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.294
in Kentucky,
in Missouri,

00:47:54.294 --> 00:47:57.222
in Maryland,
the price of slaves would begin

00:47:57.222 --> 00:47:59.629
to dwindle.
And then what do people do when

00:47:59.629 --> 00:48:01.000
the price of something goes
down?

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.926
They sell it off.
Where are they going to sell

00:48:02.926 --> 00:48:04.680
those slaves?
Can't sell them west,

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.049
can't sell them to the
Caribbean--international slave

00:48:08.049 --> 00:48:10.480
trade's illegal.
They're going to sell them into

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.070
the Deep South.
What happens?

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:16.349
The Deep South becomes more and
more and more,

00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:19.678
rather quickly,
a pressure cooker of

00:48:19.678 --> 00:48:25.194
increasingly large numbers of
slaves and no place to expand

00:48:25.194 --> 00:48:28.234
to.
Prices of slaves would continue

00:48:28.234 --> 00:48:31.731
to go down.
The value of their most

00:48:31.731 --> 00:48:37.495
precious asset was at stake,
as was their security,

00:48:37.495 --> 00:48:39.340
their safety.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.070
The second reason--and I'm
going to run out of time any

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.920
minute, I know.
Let me just lay these out.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:59.242
I'm going to name them,
and then I'm going to leave you

00:48:59.242 --> 00:49:02.479
dangling here.
The second is what I will call

00:49:02.479 --> 00:49:04.921
the fear thesis.
The third is what I will call

00:49:04.921 --> 00:49:08.027
Southern nationalism.
The fourth is what I will call

00:49:08.027 --> 00:49:10.642
agrarianism.
And the fifth is what I will

00:49:10.642 --> 00:49:14.377
call the honor thesis.
I will resume that argument

00:49:14.377 --> 00:49:19.630
when we resume next time.
But let me leave you with this.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:22.983
Lincoln does get inaugurated,
of course, in the midst of

00:49:22.983 --> 00:49:26.989
this.
He inherits a nation divided.

00:49:26.989 --> 00:49:32.589
And at the end of his first
inaugural speech comes those

00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:37.483
famous words--Lincoln was,
of course, capable of leaving

00:49:37.483 --> 00:49:41.499
passages for us to quote in
almost everything he delivered

00:49:41.499 --> 00:49:45.656
and almost everything that he
wrote--but he went to a little

00:49:45.656 --> 00:49:49.250
Shakespeare at the end of his
first inaugural.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.807
By the way, that first
inaugural was an olive

00:49:51.807 --> 00:49:55.236
branch--we will never touch
slavery where it already exists,

00:49:55.236 --> 00:49:57.619
we only intend to stop its
expansion.

00:49:57.619 --> 00:50:00.180
You are our brothers,
you are our countrymen.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:05.799
Come back, do not leave us.
Members of a country,

00:50:05.799 --> 00:50:09.349
he said, cannot divorce.
He used a divorce metaphor.

00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:13.220
And then he ended with,
"I am loathe to close.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:17.019
We are not enemies but friends.
We must not be enemies.

00:50:17.019 --> 00:50:21.203
Though passion may have
strained, it must not break our

00:50:21.203 --> 00:50:24.556
bonds of affection.
The mystic chords of memory,

00:50:24.556 --> 00:50:27.823
stretching from every
battlefield and patriot grave to

00:50:27.823 --> 00:50:32.017
every living heart,
will yet swell the chorus of

00:50:32.017 --> 00:50:37.896
the Union when again touched,
as surely they will be by the

00:50:37.896 --> 00:50:43.930
better angels of our nature."
That was beautiful poetry and

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.068
wishful thinking,
because in the wake of his

00:50:48.068 --> 00:50:53.650
inauguration and eventually in
the wake of Fort Sumter,

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:57.840
four more Southern states are
going to join the deep South and

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.000
I'll pick up that explanation
why next time.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.213
Professor Steven Smith:
It's so nice to see you again on

00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:10.803
this gorgeous autumn day.
And we had a wonderful,

00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:12.360
wonderful weekend,
didn't we?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.410
Yes, we did.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.344
Okay, today,
I want us to beginâ€¦ we move

00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:25.600
ahead.
We're moving ahead.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.360
Today we begin with Mr.
John Locke.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.952
For the next three classes,
Mr.

00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:36.984
Locke.
It is hard to believe that a

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:41.595
little book like this,
in this not terribly

00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:46.855
distinguished edition,
mind you, but nevertheless,

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:50.954
in this edition of just over a
hundred pages,

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:56.078
that a book of this length
could have such world shaping

00:00:56.078 --> 00:01:00.353
effects.
If anyone would ever doubt the

00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:04.030
importance of ideas,
political ideas,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.056
in history,
I would only say to you to

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:13.350
consult the history and the
influence of John Locke.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.242
Remarkable.
I want to talk today a little

00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:21.170
bit about Mr.
Locke.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.042
John Locke is,
for our purposes today,

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:28.313
I mean, there are many reasons
why one would read him in

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:32.975
different kinds of classes,
but for our purposes,

00:01:32.975 --> 00:01:38.989
John Locke gives the modern
state, the expression that is

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:43.950
most familiar to us.
His writings seem to have been

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.764
so completely absorbed and
adopted by Thomas Jefferson when

00:01:48.764 --> 00:01:53.496
he wrote the Declaration of
Independence that Locke

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:58.227
seems to have become virtually a
kind of honorary founding

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:01.950
father,
as it were, of America.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.574
Among other things,
John Locke advocates the

00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:11.629
natural liberty and equality of
human beings,

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.680
our natural rights to such
things as life,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.620
liberty, and what he calls
"estate" or property,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.202
the idea that government,
at least legitimate government,

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:28.861
is government by consent,
that legitimate government is

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:34.724
necessarily limited and limited
government constituted by a

00:02:34.724 --> 00:02:39.054
separation of powers,
and that when governments

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:43.548
become repressive or that when
governments become abusive of

00:02:43.548 --> 00:02:47.609
natural rights,
that the people have a right to

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.101
revolution.
In addition to this,

00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:53.294
John Locke was a famous
advocate of religious

00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:57.140
toleration.
His name is forever linked with

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.802
our ideas today of what we might
call liberal or constitutional

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:05.587
democracy.
He gives the modern

00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:09.538
constitutional state,
again, its definitive and,

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:13.070
in many ways,
most familiar expression.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.560
Yet, Locke did not arise ex
nihilo, nor did anyone.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.430
Locke's writings come from
somewhere and from some source.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.591
They were prepared,
in many ways,

00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:36.629
in part by Machiavelli,
who had died approximately a

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.400
century before Locke's birth.
But more importantly,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.283
by another English writer,
or by an English writer with

00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:48.088
whom we have spent some time,
namely Mr.

00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:52.719
Hobbes, Thomas Hobbes.
Hobbes took Machiavelli's idea

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.382
of The Prince and,
in effect, turned it into a

00:03:57.382 --> 00:04:00.699
theory or doctrine of
sovereignty.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.918
The Hobbesian sovereign is at
the basis of our ideas of

00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:08.668
impersonal, or what we might
call representative,

00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:14.007
government.
He transforms princely rule,

00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:19.514
Hobbes does,
into an office called the

00:04:19.514 --> 00:04:22.936
sovereign.
And this office is,

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:26.456
for Hobbes, the creation of a
social contract,

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:28.864
or covenant,
as he calls it,

00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:33.472
responsible to the agents or
persons who have created the

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:36.394
contract.
Hobbes had taught that the

00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:41.008
sovereign is representative of
the people who create his office

00:04:41.008 --> 00:04:44.579
in order to ensure peace,
justice, and order.

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:47.708
Without the power of the
sovereign, we would find

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:50.120
ourselves in a condition of
nature,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.738
a state of nature,
a term coined by Hobbes to

00:04:53.738 --> 00:04:58.754
indicate a world without civil
authority or at least with only

00:04:58.754 --> 00:05:03.615
weak civil authority,
unable to enforce common rules

00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:06.585
and laws.
Hobbes gave voice to the

00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:11.757
doctrine of secular absolutism,
one that invests the sovereign

00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:16.930
with absolute power to do
whatever is necessary to ensure,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.403
again, the rule of law,
justice, and political

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:24.820
stability.
And out of these rather harsh

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.079
and formidable premises,
Locke created a different,

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:36.728
what we would think of as a
more liberal constitutional

00:05:36.728 --> 00:05:40.372
theory of the state,
while being still,

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:43.580
in many ways,
very dependent on the premises

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.606
that Hobbes,
again, modifying Machiavelli,

00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:54.162
had undertaken.
Locke set out a process of

00:05:54.162 --> 00:05:59.724
domestication.
He set out to tame or to

00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:05.809
domesticate Hobbes's fierce or
harsh theory of absolute

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:12.569
government, which had found few
defenders in his own day.

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.131
Locke's most important work of
political theory,

00:06:17.131 --> 00:06:21.983
of political philosophy,
is his Two Treatises of

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:26.552
Civil Government,
of which we are only reading

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.493
the second.
The book we have before us is

00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:33.399
often simply referred to as the
Second Treatise,

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:37.670
but you will probably have
suspected, I think,

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.796
that the Second Treatise
was preceded by a first

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:45.805
treatise.
The First Treatise is

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.532
much longer than the Second
Treatise,

00:06:48.532 --> 00:06:51.259
and it was an elaborate and
painstaking,

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.296
one could almost say
deconstruction,

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:58.199
of the theory of the divine
right of kings,

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.734
which in his era,
had received expression by a

00:07:02.734 --> 00:07:07.370
man named Robert Filmer,
whose name appears,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.019
I think occasionally,
in the Second Treatise.

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:14.680
Filmer had written a book
called Patriarcha,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.713
and the Patriarcha had
argued that all political

00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:25.585
authority derives from the grant
of authority that God had given

00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:27.982
to Adam,
and therefore,

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:32.509
that all legitimate authority
has divine right behind it.

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.563
Locke's First Treatise
is a very important,

00:07:36.563 --> 00:07:40.699
but also, I have to say,
extremely tedious work,

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:46.310
and you should be grateful that
I am not assigning it to you.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.601
But it's a very interesting
book, in its own right,

00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:52.102
of in many ways,
biblical criticism and

00:07:52.102 --> 00:07:55.332
exposition.
But it's only in the Second

00:07:55.332 --> 00:07:59.668
Treatise that Locke set out
to set out his own positive

00:07:59.668 --> 00:08:02.360
theory of government,
as it were.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.296
This book was written,
we now believe,

00:08:06.296 --> 00:08:11.829
shortly before the famous Whig
Revolution of 1688,

00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:16.955
and in it, Locke sets out his
theory of parliamentary

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:21.949
supremacy, rule of law,
and constitutional government.

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:28.607
To put it maybe slightly oddly,
Locke was in his day,

00:08:28.607 --> 00:08:34.240
to some degree,
what Aristotle was to his.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.769
The Second Treatise is
intended as a practical book.

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:45.196
It was a book addressed not so
much to the philosophers of his

00:08:45.196 --> 00:08:50.885
age, but to Englishmen,
written to them in the everyday

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:55.462
language of their time.
He wrote to capture,

00:08:55.462 --> 00:09:00.571
in a way, the common sense of
his time, although this is not

00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.932
to say Locke was not,
at the same time,

00:09:03.932 --> 00:09:08.420
a deeply controversial figure.
Locke had the ability,

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.525
and it's a very desirable
ability, to take,

00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:16.300
in many ways,
radical or even revolutionary

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.950
ideas and express them in a kind
of language that makes people

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.220
believe that this is what they
had thought all along.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.009
And that is,
to some degree,

00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:29.860
the genius of the Second
Treatise.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.269
In many ways,
that is easier for us,

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:37.750
because Locke's language has
become, for us,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.136
the kind of I would almost say
common sense,

00:09:41.136 --> 00:09:44.916
or shorthand language,
for the way we think about

00:09:44.916 --> 00:09:47.173
politics.
And it was, again,

00:09:47.173 --> 00:09:51.489
a mark of his genius to be able
to create that language and give

00:09:51.489 --> 00:09:55.737
it a stamp that seemed to make
people believe that this is what

00:09:55.737 --> 00:09:58.820
they had simply been thinking
all along.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.029
Locke was himself a deeply
political man,

00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:04.676
but he was also,
at the same time,

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:09.490
as I've just been hinting,
perhaps, a very reticent one.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:15.479
He lived in a period of intense
religious and political

00:10:15.479 --> 00:10:19.452
conflict.
He was just a boy in school

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:24.447
when a king, Charles I,
was executed and he was an

00:10:24.447 --> 00:10:31.042
adult when another king,
James II, was overthrown and

00:10:31.042 --> 00:10:36.367
forced into exile.
He was a younger contemporary

00:10:36.367 --> 00:10:41.989
of Hobbes, but he lived in a
period of immense civil conflict

00:10:41.989 --> 00:10:44.942
and war.
Locke spent many years at

00:10:44.942 --> 00:10:48.634
Oxford, where he was both a
student and a fellow,

00:10:48.634 --> 00:10:52.503
and he was suspected,
throughout much of his time

00:10:52.503 --> 00:10:56.250
there, of harboring radical
political sympathies,

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.924
but he was so cautious and
careful in expressing them that

00:10:59.924 --> 00:11:03.964
after many years,
even those closest to him were

00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:07.529
unclear as to what his opinions
were.

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:12.223
The master of Locke's own
residential college at Oxford,

00:11:12.223 --> 00:11:14.697
Balliol College,
described Mr.

00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:18.793
Locke as the "master of
taciturnity," a master of

00:11:18.793 --> 00:11:22.889
taciturnity because he could not
discover,

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:29.443
through questioning and so on,
Locke's opinions on religious

00:11:29.443 --> 00:11:32.799
and political matters.
Just think of it.

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:37.608
There used to be a very
wonderful bust of Locke in the

00:11:37.608 --> 00:11:42.870
lobby of the British Arts Centre
and I used to recommend to

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.996
students,
when they were down in that

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:48.953
part of campus,
to stop in and look at his

00:11:48.953 --> 00:11:51.815
face,
because as with Machiavelli and

00:11:51.815 --> 00:11:54.470
others, the face is very
revealing.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:12:01.607
And I used to ask people to see
do you detect in here the sense

00:12:01.607 --> 00:12:07.938
of the master of taciturnity
that his college master had

00:12:07.938 --> 00:12:12.585
discussed?
Locke was a private secretary

00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:18.027
and a physician to a man named
Anthony Ashley Cooper,

00:12:18.027 --> 00:12:21.690
later known as Lord
Shaftesbury.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.437
Shaftesbury had a circle,
the Shaftesbury Circle,

00:12:26.437 --> 00:12:32.372
of political followers who were
opponents of the monarchy and

00:12:32.372 --> 00:12:36.230
who were forced into exile in
1683.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:41.133
Locke followed them into exile.
He spent several years in

00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:46.049
Holland in 1683 before returning
to England, again,

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:49.003
shortly before the Whig
Revolution, where his book,

00:12:49.003 --> 00:12:54.115
the Second Treatise,
 was published and where he

00:12:54.115 --> 00:12:59.497
lived until his death in 1704.
Just two years ago,

00:12:59.497 --> 00:13:02.992
in fact, Yale,
at the Beinecke Library,

00:13:02.992 --> 00:13:07.775
held a major conference in
commemoration of the 300th

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:11.730
anniversary of the death of Mr.
Locke.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.303
So those are a few things about
his contributions and his

00:13:16.303 --> 00:13:19.166
context.
I want to begin today the

00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:24.159
substantive part of this talk by
focusing on the theme that,

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:27.555
in many ways,
forms the central core of

00:13:27.555 --> 00:13:32.559
Locke's political doctrine,
his Theory of Natural Law.

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:35.679
This is a term that has come up
from time to time.

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:41.990
There is no modern thinker that
I'm aware of who makes natural

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.059
law as important to his doctrine
as does Locke.

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:52.048
The best way to observe the
working, or to reconstruct the

00:13:52.048 --> 00:13:57.299
working, of natural law is to
follow a procedure that we have

00:13:57.299 --> 00:14:01.088
seen before;
to think about what is the

00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:04.762
condition of nature,
the state of nature,

00:14:04.762 --> 00:14:10.090
where we can see the natural
law in its operative form.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.161
The state of nature,
for Locke, in many ways,

00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:18.048
as for Hobbes,
is not a condition of ruling

00:14:18.048 --> 00:14:22.120
and being ruled,
as it is for Aristotle.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.950
The state of nature is not a
political condition.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:31.152
Locke describes the state of
nature as a condition of perfect

00:14:31.152 --> 00:14:33.850
freedom.
While Aristotle said that we

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.203
were, by nature,
members of a family,

00:14:36.203 --> 00:14:40.406
a polis,
a moral community of some kind,

00:14:40.406 --> 00:14:44.799
bound by ties of civic or
family obligation,

00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:48.629
Locke understands,
by the state of nature,

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:54.139
a condition without civil
authority or civil obligations.

00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:59.195
The state of nature is not,
for him, an historical

00:14:59.195 --> 00:15:05.076
condition, although he does
occasionally refer to the vast

00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:10.338
tracts of North America as
suggesting a condition of

00:15:10.338 --> 00:15:13.259
nature,
but the state of nature is a

00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:17.523
kind of thought experiment.
What does human nature like in

00:15:17.523 --> 00:15:19.850
the absence of authority?

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.739
The state of nature,
Locke suggests to us,

00:15:28.739 --> 00:15:32.980
is not an amoral condition,
as it was for Hobbes.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.100
It is not simply a condition of
war, of all against all.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.933
The state of nature,
he tells us,

00:15:38.933 --> 00:15:43.914
is in fact a moral condition.
It is governed by a moral law,

00:15:43.914 --> 00:15:48.187
or a natural law,
that dictates peace and

00:15:48.187 --> 00:15:51.834
sociability.
There is a moral law of nature

00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:55.651
that determines that no one
should harm another person in

00:15:55.651 --> 00:15:58.309
their life, liberty,
or possessions.

00:15:58.309 --> 00:16:01.727
This natural law,
Locke affirms,

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:07.679
"willeth the peace and
preservation of all mankind."

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:11.919
So the natural condition,
for Locke, is a moral state,

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:16.399
one in which a natural law,
again, dictates the peace and

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:20.991
preservation.
It is not a war of all against

00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:23.293
all.
Locke's natural law,

00:16:23.293 --> 00:16:26.997
in some ways,
seems like a very traditional

00:16:26.997 --> 00:16:30.878
form of moral law,
familiar to readers of his

00:16:30.878 --> 00:16:33.992
time;
readers who would have been

00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:39.036
familiar with the natural law
tradition, going back to Cicero,

00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:40.690
the Roman Stoics,
St.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.832
Thomas Aquinas,
and in Locke's own day,

00:16:43.832 --> 00:16:49.289
an important Anglican divine by
the name of Richard Hooker.

00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:52.871
Locke's theory of moral law,
or natural law,

00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:57.286
sounds comforting and
traditional, and to some degree,

00:16:57.286 --> 00:17:00.447
it is.
All civil authority has its

00:17:00.447 --> 00:17:04.413
foundation in a law of reason
that is knowable,

00:17:04.413 --> 00:17:08.380
by virtue of our rational
capacities alone.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.153
The law of nature declares,
according to Locke,

00:17:12.153 --> 00:17:14.696
that we are,
in his famous term,

00:17:14.696 --> 00:17:19.043
the "workmanship of one
omnipotent and infinitely wise

00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:22.089
maker."
And as products of divine

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:26.603
workmanship, we ought never to
harm anyone in their lives,

00:17:26.603 --> 00:17:29.918
liberties, or possessions.
Locke, again,

00:17:29.918 --> 00:17:34.463
seems to effortlessly weave
together the Stoic tradition of

00:17:34.463 --> 00:17:39.479
natural law with these Christian
ideas of divine workmanship into

00:17:39.479 --> 00:17:43.506
one seamless whole.
You can see the way in which

00:17:43.506 --> 00:17:46.341
Locke's rhetoric here,
in his writing,

00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:50.710
brings together different
strands of the philosophical and

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.976
theological tradition,
weaving them together in a kind

00:17:54.976 --> 00:17:56.960
of effortless whole almost.

00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:03.960
Do not be simply seduced by
this.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:09.259
Why do I say that?
Because even within the same

00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:12.859
paragraphs, Locke's natural law,
the law that,

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:16.710
again,
mandates or dictates "peace and

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.759
preservation of all mankind,"
turns into a right of

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:25.398
self-preservation.
From the beginning,

00:18:25.398 --> 00:18:29.154
you have to say,
it is not altogether clear even

00:18:29.154 --> 00:18:33.390
whether the natural law is a
theory of moral duty,

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.164
duties that we have to preserve
other's duties and obligations,

00:18:38.164 --> 00:18:42.477
or whether it is a theory of
natural rights that mandates

00:18:42.477 --> 00:18:46.096
that the highest priority be
given to individual

00:18:46.096 --> 00:18:50.486
self-preservation and whatever
is necessary to achieve the

00:18:50.486 --> 00:18:55.141
preservation of the individual.
The state of nature is a

00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:57.549
condition without civil
authority.

00:18:57.549 --> 00:19:00.482
The law of nature,
in other words,

00:19:00.482 --> 00:19:05.458
has no person or office to
oversee its enforcement or its

00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:08.898
application.
So this state of nature that he

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.829
once describes,
or early describes in the book

00:19:11.829 --> 00:19:14.890
is a condition of peace and
mutual distrust,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.516
quickly degenerates into a
condition of civil war,

00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:22.660
or of war, where every
individual serves as the judge,

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.019
jury, and executioner of the
natural law.

00:19:27.019 --> 00:19:33.323
The state of nature quickly
becomes a Hobbesian condition of

00:19:33.323 --> 00:19:37.170
essentially every man for
himself.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.337
Consider the following passage
in section 11 of the Second

00:19:40.337 --> 00:19:43.148
Treatise.
"The damnified person," Locke

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:47.184
writes--someone who has been
mistreated in the condition of

00:19:47.184 --> 00:19:51.084
nature--the "damnified person,"
who has been injured or

00:19:51.084 --> 00:19:54.953
mistreated, "has this power of
appropriating to himself the

00:19:54.953 --> 00:19:58.155
goods or services of the
offender by the right of

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:01.613
self-preservation,
as every man has a power to

00:20:01.613 --> 00:20:05.460
punish the crime to prevent it
being committed again,

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.218
by the right he has of
preserving all mankind,

00:20:08.218 --> 00:20:12.079
and doing all reasonable things
he can in order to that end."

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:15.363
In other words,
if you have been wronged,

00:20:15.363 --> 00:20:19.960
or feel you have been wronged,
in the state of nature,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.861
you have, according to the
natural law, for Locke,

00:20:23.861 --> 00:20:26.250
the right to,
as he puts it,

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.173
appropriate to yourself the
goods or services of the

00:20:30.173 --> 00:20:33.516
offender.
And you have that--to take from

00:20:33.516 --> 00:20:36.093
them their goods,
their property,

00:20:36.093 --> 00:20:41.627
their services in some way,
whatever you feel appropriate

00:20:41.627 --> 00:20:47.970
as, again, the person who has
suffered some kind of wrong.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.319
Every person becomes,
as it were, judge and

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:54.109
executioner of the law of
nature.

00:20:54.109 --> 00:20:57.531
The fundamental law of nature,
Locke says here,

00:20:57.531 --> 00:21:00.210
is the right of
self-preservation.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:04.790
And this states that each
person is empowered to do,

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:09.282
again, whatever is in his
power, to preserve him or

00:21:09.282 --> 00:21:13.127
herself.
Again, consider the following

00:21:13.127 --> 00:21:17.325
in section 16:
"And one may destroy a man who

00:21:17.325 --> 00:21:21.475
makes war upon him."
May destroy another who makes

00:21:21.475 --> 00:21:24.665
war upon you.
"Or has discovered an enmity to

00:21:24.665 --> 00:21:28.867
his being, for the same reason
that he may kill a wolf or a

00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:31.663
lion,"
because such men "are not under

00:21:31.663 --> 00:21:34.359
the ties of the common law of
reason."

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:38.782
They "have no other rule but
that of force and violence," so

00:21:38.782 --> 00:21:42.230
also, they may be treated as
beasts of prey,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.235
"those dangerous or noxious
creatures that will be sure to

00:21:46.235 --> 00:21:49.750
destroy him whenever he falls
into their power."

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:54.510
Listen to that language.
From an original moral

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:59.369
condition, where we are under a
natural law not to harm others,

00:21:59.369 --> 00:22:05.143
a law to preserve and protect
the well-being of others of our

00:22:05.143 --> 00:22:10.819
kind, we have become like lions
and wolves to each other,

00:22:10.819 --> 00:22:13.309
beasts of prey and other
noxious creatures.

00:22:13.309 --> 00:22:19.115
What is the state of nature,
but, in the words of Dorothy

00:22:19.115 --> 00:22:22.329
Gale, "lions,
tigers, and bears,

00:22:22.329 --> 00:22:25.958
oh my!"
This is what we are to one

00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:29.209
another.
This is what I've come to think

00:22:29.209 --> 00:22:31.908
of as Locke's bestiary,
and in fact,

00:22:31.908 --> 00:22:36.533
the Second Treatise is
rife with language of comparing

00:22:36.533 --> 00:22:40.079
human beings and our behavior to
animals.

00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:41.980
He speaks about lions and
wolves.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:48.230
Elsewhere he speaks about
polecats and skunks and foxes.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.959
If, in fact,
we are all beings,

00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:56.236
as he says, created under a
natural law, we seem to quickly

00:22:56.236 --> 00:23:00.240
degenerate into almost bestial
behavior.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.087
Beasts of prey,
far from being cooperative and

00:23:04.087 --> 00:23:09.031
peace seeking creatures.
The very freedom that such

00:23:09.031 --> 00:23:14.998
beings as ourselves enjoy in a
state of nature leads us to

00:23:14.998 --> 00:23:19.772
abuse that freedom and,
in turn, requires or is at the

00:23:19.772 --> 00:23:22.510
basis of the need for civil
government.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.698
However, in the meantime,
the question that any reader of

00:23:29.698 --> 00:23:33.649
the Second Treatise has
to ask of themselves--and I hope

00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:37.345
you've put this forward in your
sections to one another--is

00:23:37.345 --> 00:23:41.751
whether the natural condition,
as Locke understands it,

00:23:41.751 --> 00:23:46.854
is one overseen by a moral law
of justifying or sanctifying

00:23:46.854 --> 00:23:51.585
peace and security,
or whether Locke's state of

00:23:51.585 --> 00:23:57.071
nature is simply a thinly veiled
description, a thinly

00:23:57.071 --> 00:24:02.244
papered-over description,
of the Hobbesian war of all

00:24:02.244 --> 00:24:06.488
against all.
Was Locke simply Hobbes,

00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:10.950
in some way,
in sheep's clothing?

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:21.074
Remember his famous taciturnity.
Locke seems to be speaking two

00:24:21.074 --> 00:24:24.160
very different languages,
in other words,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.865
one of traditional natural law
that holds out duties to others

00:24:28.865 --> 00:24:32.304
as primary and the other,
in some ways,

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:37.579
a modern Hobbesian conception
of natural rights that maintains

00:24:37.579 --> 00:24:41.990
the priority of right and each
individual's right to

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.858
self-preservation.
Is Locke, in other words--and

00:24:45.858 --> 00:24:49.420
this is perhaps more of an
historical than a theoretical

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.400
question--is Locke a member of
the ancient,

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.037
in some ways,
Ciceronian and Thomistic

00:24:55.037 --> 00:24:58.529
tradition of natural law or a
modern Hobbesian?

00:24:58.529 --> 00:25:03.847
Do his politics derive from a
theological conception of divine

00:25:03.847 --> 00:25:07.578
workmanship or an ultimately,
you might say,

00:25:07.578 --> 00:25:11.616
naturalistic conception or
account of the human passions

00:25:11.616 --> 00:25:17.053
and the struggle for survival?
Do his priorities go to duties

00:25:17.053 --> 00:25:21.140
or to rights?
Or is Locke simply confused?

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:26.141
Is he confusing two different
languages or is he being

00:25:26.141 --> 00:25:30.009
intentionally ambiguous in his
account?

00:25:30.009 --> 00:25:33.475
A recent book,
by a well-known scholar of

00:25:33.475 --> 00:25:37.287
Locke has argued,
I think quite powerfully in

00:25:37.287 --> 00:25:41.328
some ways,
that Locke's idea of equality

00:25:41.328 --> 00:25:46.010
in the state of nature
specifically relies upon a

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:51.960
certain kind of Christian
theological context of argument.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.768
Locke's statement in paragraph
four of the Second

00:25:55.768 --> 00:25:59.054
Treatise,
his statement that "there being

00:25:59.054 --> 00:26:03.459
nothing more evident than that
creatures of the same species

00:26:03.459 --> 00:26:06.619
and rank,
promiscuously born to all the

00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:10.346
same advantages of Nature,
should also be equal to one

00:26:10.346 --> 00:26:12.978
another."
That Locke's statement that

00:26:12.978 --> 00:26:16.951
creatures of the same species
and rank should be equal to one

00:26:16.951 --> 00:26:19.887
another,
this is said to rely upon and

00:26:19.887 --> 00:26:23.539
depend upon a very specific
religious argument.

00:26:23.539 --> 00:26:28.392
What it means to belong to a
species and why belonging to the

00:26:28.392 --> 00:26:33.244
same species confers a special
rank or dignity on each of its

00:26:33.244 --> 00:26:37.229
members only makes sense,
according to this recent

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:40.029
interpretation,
if you believe or if it is

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:43.785
believed that the species in
question has a specifically

00:26:43.785 --> 00:26:47.358
moral relation to God.
The question,

00:26:47.358 --> 00:26:55.200
I think, is whether Locke's
idea of equality in the state of

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.655
nature,
or his idea of the moral law in

00:26:58.655 --> 00:27:01.809
the state of nature,
relies upon this belief,

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:07.114
or whether it can be inferred
from such things as the basic

00:27:07.114 --> 00:27:12.045
principles of freedom,
whether this can be inferred,

00:27:12.045 --> 00:27:16.950
as it were, from purely non
theological, naturalistic

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.038
premises or grounds.
Locke, to be short,

00:27:21.038 --> 00:27:25.886
is silent in the Second
Treatise about the

00:27:25.886 --> 00:27:30.230
theological foundations of his
position.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.874
There are no discussions of
important theological figures,

00:27:33.874 --> 00:27:36.815
such as Jesus or St.
Paul or the New Testament,

00:27:36.815 --> 00:27:40.460
at least in the Second
Treatise; he discusses these

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.336
issues at length elsewhere.
These may be,

00:27:43.336 --> 00:27:45.457
in some way,
thought of as background

00:27:45.457 --> 00:27:48.049
considerations,
but the question remains,

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:53.014
I think, for us whether these
are deeply embedded in Locke's

00:27:53.014 --> 00:27:57.305
arguments about divine
workmanship or whether or not

00:27:57.305 --> 00:28:01.765
that language of divine
workmanship simply serves as a

00:28:01.765 --> 00:28:08.014
kind of window dressing,
again, for a purely secular

00:28:08.014 --> 00:28:16.430
naturalistic theory of human
nature and political authority.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.197
Very important issue,
I think, in coming to

00:28:23.197 --> 00:28:28.338
understand Locke and indirectly,
very important for how we come

00:28:28.338 --> 00:28:32.349
to think of the American regime
because--I'll just say,

00:28:32.349 --> 00:28:37.248
simply as a kind of footnote to
what I've been saying--if Locke

00:28:37.248 --> 00:28:41.742
is thought of in some ways,
as his doctrine as being,

00:28:41.742 --> 00:28:45.443
in some ways,
at the founding principles of

00:28:45.443 --> 00:28:48.663
the American regime,
the Declaration of

00:28:48.663 --> 00:28:51.960
Independence most notably,
it becomes very important.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.283
It becomes part of a
contemporary public argument

00:28:56.283 --> 00:29:01.688
whether those foundations owe
their authority to some kind of

00:29:01.688 --> 00:29:05.619
theological doctrine,
as Jefferson calls it in the

00:29:05.619 --> 00:29:07.599
opening of the
Declaration,

00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:10.059
"the Laws of Nature and
Nature's God,"

00:29:10.059 --> 00:29:15.829
seems in some way to have
Lockean overtones to it.

00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:20.808
Do our founding documents imply
a theology of some kind,

00:29:20.808 --> 00:29:24.430
"the Laws of Nature and
Nature's God,"

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:29.204
or are those principles,
again, purely of a naturalistic

00:29:29.204 --> 00:29:33.980
secular kind that can do without
theology altogether?

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.913
That is an argument,
a kind of scholarly and

00:29:37.913 --> 00:29:42.303
academic argument,
to be sure, but it spills over

00:29:42.303 --> 00:29:47.425
into many of our public debates
over the role or place of

00:29:47.425 --> 00:29:52.948
religion in public life,
whenever we talk about issues

00:29:52.948 --> 00:29:59.078
of the appropriateness of issues
like school prayer or should the

00:29:59.078 --> 00:30:04.635
Ten Commandments be publicly
displayed in courthouses or in

00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:09.221
other public places?
Or if you want to take another

00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:13.313
famous Jeffersonian position,
is there a kind of absolute

00:30:13.313 --> 00:30:16.416
firewall,
a wall of separation,

00:30:16.416 --> 00:30:22.567
between religion and the state?
These issues that we very much

00:30:22.567 --> 00:30:26.980
work on today and think about
are, you can see,

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:32.304
deeply embedded in how we think
about Locke and those opening

00:30:32.304 --> 00:30:36.740
sections of the Second
Treatise dealing with

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.289
natural law and the state of
nature.

00:30:40.289 --> 00:30:43.824
So you can see,
again, how these ideas

00:30:43.824 --> 00:30:49.363
penetrate deeply into the marrow
of our public or political

00:30:49.363 --> 00:30:50.510
culture.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.920
Are we so different?
Have we become so different?

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.394
Will people living
three-hundred years from now

00:31:01.394 --> 00:31:05.518
think of us as so different,
and our public debates so

00:31:05.518 --> 00:31:09.607
different, from those that
animated the public issues in

00:31:09.607 --> 00:31:12.960
the time of John Locke?
Maybe not.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:20.030
Maybe we aren't that different.
So enough for contemporary.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:31.724
Let me go back to Mr. Locke.
The core of Locke's theory of

00:31:31.724 --> 00:31:39.261
natural law in the state of
nature is arguably lodged in his

00:31:39.261 --> 00:31:45.618
account of property,
chapter 5 of the Second

00:31:45.618 --> 00:31:49.588
Treatise.
If you remember anything about

00:31:49.588 --> 00:31:52.710
Locke after this class,
remember chapter 5.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.881
It is, by all accounts--maybe
chapter 19 as well,

00:31:56.881 --> 00:32:02.529
"The Theory of Revolution," but
chapter 5, account of property;

00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:06.309
certainly, in many ways,
one of the most characteristic

00:32:06.309 --> 00:32:09.180
doctrines of Lockean political
thought.

00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:19.606
Locke's view of human nature is
that we are very much the

00:32:19.606 --> 00:32:25.252
property-acquiring animal.
Aristotle had said we were

00:32:25.252 --> 00:32:28.178
political by nature;
Locke says we are

00:32:28.178 --> 00:32:32.931
property-acquiring beings.
Our claims to property derive

00:32:32.931 --> 00:32:37.025
from our work.
The fact that we have expended

00:32:37.025 --> 00:32:41.346
our labor, our work,
on something gives us a title

00:32:41.346 --> 00:32:45.532
to it.
Labor confers value and is the

00:32:45.532 --> 00:32:49.573
source of all values.
The state of nature is a

00:32:49.573 --> 00:32:52.485
condition, he tells us,
of communal ownership,

00:32:52.485 --> 00:32:56.240
what Karl Marx would have
called "primitive communism."

00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.057
The state of nature is given to
all men in common,

00:33:00.057 --> 00:33:04.562
Locke says.
Parts of it become private

00:33:04.562 --> 00:33:11.279
property only when we add our
labor to something.

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:17.759
Let me read a famous formula
from sections 27 and 28.

00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:22.563
"Every man," Locke says,
"has property in his person:

00:33:22.563 --> 00:33:26.720
this no body has any right to
but himself."

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.821
We all, in other words,
come into the world with a

00:33:30.821 --> 00:33:35.090
certain private property,
property in our person.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.846
No one else has a right to that.
"The labour of his body," Locke

00:33:38.846 --> 00:33:42.279
continues, "and the work of his
hands, we may say,

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:46.994
are properly his for labour
being the unquestionable

00:33:46.994 --> 00:33:51.529
property of the labourer,
no man but he can have a right

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:55.539
to what is once joined to,
at least where there is enough,

00:33:55.539 --> 00:33:57.490
as good left in common for
others."

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:02.422
"That labour," Locke says,
"puts a distinction between him

00:34:02.422 --> 00:34:06.142
and the common:
that added something to them

00:34:06.142 --> 00:34:09.702
more than nature,
the common mother of all,

00:34:09.702 --> 00:34:13.384
had done;
and so they become his private

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:16.132
right."
So we have moved here,

00:34:16.132 --> 00:34:20.302
in this one paragraph,
from the state of nature,

00:34:20.302 --> 00:34:26.422
which he says is common to all,
to a condition of rudimentary

00:34:26.422 --> 00:34:31.022
private property,
which we have in our body,

00:34:31.022 --> 00:34:34.543
our person,
which he says also includes the

00:34:34.543 --> 00:34:37.480
labor of the body and the work
of the hands,

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.205
how we expend our activity.
That labor, he says,

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:45.310
which puts something between us
and the common,

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:50.219
becomes the source of ownership
of things around us,

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:55.199
and that ownership then,
in turn, becomes a right.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.858
So they become,
he concludes there,

00:34:57.858 --> 00:35:01.143
his private right,
the source of a right to

00:35:01.143 --> 00:35:03.849
property.
The natural law,

00:35:03.849 --> 00:35:09.655
as Locke seems to be saying,
dictates a right to private

00:35:09.655 --> 00:35:15.884
property and it is to secure
that right that governments are

00:35:15.884 --> 00:35:21.240
ultimately established.
In a striking formulation,

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:26.317
Locke tells us that the world
was created in order to be

00:35:26.317 --> 00:35:31.064
cultivated and improved.
Those who work to improve and

00:35:31.064 --> 00:35:34.485
develop nature,
who add to nature through the

00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:38.449
labor of their body and the work
of their hands,

00:35:38.449 --> 00:35:43.311
those who develop and improve
nature are the true benefactors

00:35:43.311 --> 00:35:48.225
of humanity, of humankind.
"God gave the world to men in

00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:52.605
common," he says,
section 34, "God gave the world

00:35:52.605 --> 00:35:56.303
to men in common,
but since He gave it to them

00:35:56.303 --> 00:35:59.916
for their benefit and the
greatest conveniences of life

00:35:59.916 --> 00:36:03.530
that they were capable to draw
from it," he writes;

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.138
the world was given for our
convenience, he says,

00:36:07.138 --> 00:36:10.746
to be drawn from,
"it cannot be supposed He meant

00:36:10.746 --> 00:36:14.730
it should always remain common
and uncultivated."

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.682
And then he adds,
"He gave it to the use of the

00:36:18.682 --> 00:36:24.182
industrious and the rational and
not to the fancy or covetousness

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:27.619
of the quarrelsome and
contentious."

00:36:27.619 --> 00:36:33.392
God gave the world for our
improvement of it and therefore,

00:36:33.392 --> 00:36:38.269
He gave it to the industrious
and the rational.

00:36:38.269 --> 00:36:44.578
Locke seems to suggest in that
very phrase that the state will

00:36:44.578 --> 00:36:49.209
be a commercial state,
that the Lockean republic or

00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:52.970
the Lockean state will be a
commercial republic.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.105
Think of that.
Ancient political theory,

00:36:56.105 --> 00:36:58.942
Plato, Aristotle,
regarded commerce,

00:36:58.942 --> 00:37:02.831
regarded property,
as in many ways subordinate to

00:37:02.831 --> 00:37:07.668
the life of a citizen.
Plato would have instituted a

00:37:07.668 --> 00:37:12.692
kind of communism of property
among the guardians of his

00:37:12.692 --> 00:37:16.386
Kalipolis.
Aristotle thought of the

00:37:16.386 --> 00:37:22.652
necessity of private property,
but simply as a means to allow

00:37:22.652 --> 00:37:28.500
a few of those citizens,
to engage in political life.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:33.861
Economy, you might say,
was always subordinate to the

00:37:33.861 --> 00:37:37.757
polity.
Locke turns this ancient and

00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:42.632
medieval doctrine,
as well, on its head in many

00:37:42.632 --> 00:37:45.079
ways.
The world belongs to the

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:48.877
industrious and the rational,
those who, through their own

00:37:48.877 --> 00:37:52.009
efforts,
through their labor and work,

00:37:52.009 --> 00:37:55.320
increase and enhance the plenty
of all.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:00.387
It is only a relatively short
step from John Locke to Adam

00:38:00.387 --> 00:38:04.590
Smith, in that respect,
the great author of The

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:08.322
Wealth of Nations,
again, just under a century

00:38:08.322 --> 00:38:12.511
after Locke's Second
Treatise. For Locke--and let

00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:17.005
me just go on a little more
about this--there are no natural

00:38:17.005 --> 00:38:20.952
limits to property acquisition.
And this is,

00:38:20.952 --> 00:38:25.943
in a way, the essential point.
The introduction of money or

00:38:25.943 --> 00:38:30.408
coinage into the state of
nature, an issue I'm not going

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:34.343
to talk much about here,
but that becomes an important

00:38:34.343 --> 00:38:38.130
moment in his chapter 5 in his
account of the state of nature,

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:43.544
the introduction of money makes
unlimited capital accumulation

00:38:43.544 --> 00:38:47.920
not only possible,
but even a kind of moral duty.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.514
It becomes our duty to enhance
and work upon the raw materials

00:38:52.514 --> 00:38:57.014
of the natural world around us.
By enriching ourselves,

00:38:57.014 --> 00:39:01.480
we unintentionally work for the
benefit of others.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.054
Consider the following
remarkable sentence:

00:39:05.054 --> 00:39:09.820
"A king of a large and fruitful
territory in America,"

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.702
he says, "feeds,
lodges, and is clad worse than

00:39:14.702 --> 00:39:19.736
a day labourer in England."
Because, of course,

00:39:19.736 --> 00:39:25.195
our work, Locke thinks,
has enhanced the plenty of all

00:39:25.195 --> 00:39:28.530
in some way.
The creation of a general

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:32.755
plenty, the common wealth--and
think of the way in which the

00:39:32.755 --> 00:39:36.050
revealing use of that term
"common wealth,"

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.406
the wealth of all--is due,
in many ways,

00:39:39.406 --> 00:39:44.569
to the emancipation of labor
from the previous kinds of moral

00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:49.388
and political restrictions
imposed upon it by the ancient

00:39:49.388 --> 00:39:52.529
philosophical,
as well as religious,

00:39:52.529 --> 00:39:54.455
traditions.
Labor becomes,

00:39:54.455 --> 00:39:58.998
for Locke, his source of all
value and our title to common

00:39:58.998 --> 00:40:03.860
ownership and in a remarkable
rhetorical series of shifts,

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.243
he makes not nature,
but rather human labor and

00:40:08.243 --> 00:40:13.007
acquisition the source of
property and of unlimited

00:40:13.007 --> 00:40:16.955
material possessions.
He begins this chapter,

00:40:16.955 --> 00:40:20.019
chapter 5, with the assertion,
think about it,

00:40:20.019 --> 00:40:23.559
that "God hath given the world
to men in common,"

00:40:23.559 --> 00:40:30.395
once again suggesting that the
original state is one of common

00:40:30.395 --> 00:40:33.900
ownership.
He then suggests that every

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.860
person is the owner of their own
bodies and that one acquires a

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:43.420
title to things through labor
that we have mixed with that

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.648
common world.
But what starts as a very,

00:40:46.648 --> 00:40:50.570
very modest title to the
objects that we have worked on,

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:56.208
his example is something as
simple as picking apples from a

00:40:56.208 --> 00:41:01.750
tree, the act of picking gives
us a title to the apple,

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:07.048
that very simple or rudimentary
form of property soon turns into

00:41:07.048 --> 00:41:12.177
a full scale explanation of the
rise of property and a kind of

00:41:12.177 --> 00:41:15.710
market economy in the state of
nature.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:20.477
"Labor accounts," he tells us,
"for ten times the amount of

00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:25.820
value that is provided by nature
alone," he says at section 37.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:30.780
Our labor enhances the value of
nature ten times.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.215
But he then goes on to add very
quickly, "I have here rated the

00:41:35.215 --> 00:41:39.580
improved land very low in making
its product but as one to ten

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.800
when it is much nearer a hundred
to one."

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.909
Our labor advances things a
hundred-fold.

00:41:46.909 --> 00:41:49.443
Shortly later,
in section 43,

00:41:49.443 --> 00:41:53.695
he says that the value of
anything is improved a

00:41:53.695 --> 00:41:58.394
thousand-fold due to labor.
Again, what began as a fairly

00:41:58.394 --> 00:42:02.249
rudimentary discussion of the
origins of private property at

00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:06.429
the beginning of chapter 5,
limited by the extent of our

00:42:06.429 --> 00:42:09.997
use and spoilage,
has, by the end of that same

00:42:09.997 --> 00:42:12.137
chapter,
you might say,

00:42:12.137 --> 00:42:16.842
morphed into an account of
large scale ownership with

00:42:16.842 --> 00:42:21.730
considerable inequalities of
wealth and possession.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:25.433
By the end of chapter 5,
there appears to be almost a

00:42:25.433 --> 00:42:29.422
direct link between Locke's
dynamic theory of property in

00:42:29.422 --> 00:42:32.841
chapter 5 and James Madison's
famous statement in

00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:35.050
Federalist No.
10.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:38.404
As Madison says,
"the protection of different

00:42:38.404 --> 00:42:42.597
and unequal faculties of
acquiring property is the first

00:42:42.597 --> 00:42:44.580
object of Government."

00:42:48.179 --> 00:42:51.745
Seems a very Lockean
proposition in The

00:42:51.745 --> 00:42:54.556
Federalist.
Locke gives,

00:42:54.556 --> 00:42:57.315
in other words,
to commerce,

00:42:57.315 --> 00:43:01.300
to money-making,
to acquisitiveness,

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.997
a kind of pride of place and a
sort of moral status,

00:43:05.997 --> 00:43:10.736
you might even call it,
that it never enjoyed in the

00:43:10.736 --> 00:43:16.235
ancient and medieval worlds.
The new politics of the Lockean

00:43:16.235 --> 00:43:20.650
state will no longer be
concerned with glory,

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:26.310
honor, thumos,
virtue, but Lockean politics

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:30.469
will be sober,
will be pedestrian,

00:43:30.469 --> 00:43:38.400
it will be hedonistic,
without sublimity or joy.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.919
Locke is the author of the
doctrine that commerce softens

00:43:43.919 --> 00:43:47.960
manners, that it makes us less
warlike,

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.880
that it makes us civilized,
something that reaches its,

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.712
you might say,
highest expression in the

00:43:54.712 --> 00:43:58.706
twentieth chapter or the
twentieth book of Montesquieu's

00:43:58.706 --> 00:44:03.526
Spirit of the Laws.
Commerce does not require us,

00:44:03.526 --> 00:44:06.969
for Locke, to spill blood or
risk life.

00:44:06.969 --> 00:44:10.726
It is solid,
reliable, thoroughly middle

00:44:10.726 --> 00:44:13.947
class in some ways.
Locke is, again,

00:44:13.947 --> 00:44:18.287
the great author of the idea
that the task of government is

00:44:18.287 --> 00:44:21.730
to protect not just the rights
of property,

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:27.654
but the right to acquire and
build upon the property that we

00:44:27.654 --> 00:44:31.551
already own.
So I want to end on this note

00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:36.876
and begin on Wednesday talking a
little bit about what we might

00:44:36.876 --> 00:44:41.000
call John Locke and the spirit
of capitalism.

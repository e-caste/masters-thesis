00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.294
Prof: So today I do want
to finish discussing the good,

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:07.220
old Albany Congress of 1754.
 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.910
I introduced it at the end of
Thursday's lecture--

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.950
and then we are moving on to
the Stamp Act,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.063
and by the end of today's
lecture we will have worked our

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:19.010
way towards yet another
congress.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.087
We're going to have a
bookend--a congress bookend

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:21.520
lecture.
 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.496
We're going to have worked our
way to the Stamp Act Congress by

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:27.693
the end of this lecture which--
as you'll see over the course

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:31.370
of the lecture--
ends up being a step towards

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.930
colonial unity.
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.380
But as I did mention in
Thursday's lecture,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.695
colonial unity was definitely
not a foregone conclusion in

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:43.944
this time period--
and I mentioned a total of

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:46.880
three attempts at colonial unity
last week.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.550
One of them was the Dominion of
New England,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.260
which was not prompted by
actions that the colonists took,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.117
but the other two were
prompted by the colonists and

00:00:56.117 --> 00:00:59.909
they were both prompted by fears
and a sense of a need for

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.039
self-defense.
 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.072
And the first that I mentioned
was the United Colonies of New

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:06.572
England,
which first met in 1643 and was

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:10.272
largely centered on fears of
Dutch expansion and fears about

00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:14.078
hostile Native Americans,
and then I ended by talking

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:17.470
about the Albany Congress which
met in 1754,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.260
also in part because of fears
about Native Americans--

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.470
again self-defense.
 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.798
So let's just look for a few
minutes at what happened in that

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:30.015
Albany Congress before we move
on to the events that end up

00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:31.680
surrounding the Stamp Act.
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.157
I think I mentioned at the very
end of the lecture that nine

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.750
colonies were invited to the
Albany Congress:

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.083
Massachusetts,
New Hampshire,

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:42.510
Connecticut,
Rhode Island,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.190
New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.810
Maryland, and Virginia.
 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.010
I'll read that again for you
guys: Massachusetts,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.050
New Hampshire,
Connecticut,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.705
Rhode Island,
New York, New Jersey,

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:54.620
Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and Virginia.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.044
Colonies further to the south
weren't invited because they

00:01:58.044 --> 00:02:01.587
were viewed as being too far
away from the probable cause of

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:04.117
conflict to invite,
and New Jersey and Virginia

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:06.454
decided not to come because it
seemed too expensive to send

00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:08.575
delegates,
which again tells you how even

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:11.378
at a time where people thought
there was some kind of a

00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:14.086
crisis--
even that in some cases didn't

00:02:14.086 --> 00:02:18.007
inspire people to join in on
this sort of joint colonial

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:18.720
effort.
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.514
Now the different delegates to
the Albany Congress had

00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:24.417
different instructions from
their various colonies about

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:26.580
what they were supposed to be
doing,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.681
and this ends up being a really
common problem with joint

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:33.315
colonial meetings,
this problem of having

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:36.351
different colonies even agree
fundamentally on what's supposed

00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:38.940
to be happening at the
congresses when they meet.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.676
And we're for sure going to see
this happen again at the

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.806
Constitutional Convention --
where, as we'll see,

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:45.461
you end up with a lot of
different instructions about

00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:46.800
what's supposed to be happening
there,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.062
and people sort of have to
figure out what direction to go

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:53.440
based on interpreting each
different set of instructions.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.020
So of the colonies that were at
the Albany Congress,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.127
only Massachusetts authorized
its delegates to go beyond

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:06.830
Indian affairs and intercolonial
defense to at least discuss the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.236
possibility of entering into
what they called "Articles

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:15.717
of Union and Confederation"
with the other colonies that

00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:18.650
were represented,
for purposes,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.460
as they put it--this was in
their instructions --

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.458
"for the general defense
of his Majesty's subjects and

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:29.169
interests in North America,
as well in time of peace,

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.639
as of war."
 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.419
So Massachusetts is the only
colony that includes that,

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.896
but it's not as though that
ideas at least about the

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:41.988
possibility of the union had
never occurred to anybody before

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:45.669
that poin,t and particularly
among several people.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.598
Benjamin Franklin--several
years before actually,

00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:51.941
as early as 1751--Franklin had
been one of a number of people

00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:55.227
who had thought maybe it makes
sense to at least think about

00:03:55.227 --> 00:03:57.400
some way of unifying the
colonies,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.270
and he had come up with his own
plan.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.441
He envisioned some kind of a
governor-general that would sort

00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:08.473
of preside over this sort of
layer of government that would

00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:11.943
exist over the colonies,
and the governor-general he

00:04:11.943 --> 00:04:14.150
thought would be paid for by the
crown,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.619
and then he also saw a kind of
general council that would

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:20.470
represent all the colonies and
it would be--

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.350
have delegates in it chosen by
colonial assemblies.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.089
So Franklin invents this thing,
1751, that he's--you could see

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:31.646
he's kind of trying to balance
royal authority and colonial

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.259
power.
 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.449
And that's his idea.
 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.755
So now a few years later,
1754, the Albany Congress at

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:43.062
least investigates the idea of
some kind of a union of

00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:46.446
colonies,
and they actually appointed a

00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:51.327
committee to prepare basically a
memorandum outlining what might

00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:53.110
be a proposed union.
 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.235
And the memorandum has a really
eighteenth-century kind of title

00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:58.432
attached to it;
the memorandum is titled

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:01.642
Short Hints Towards a Scheme
for a General Union of the

00:05:01.642 --> 00:05:04.009
British Colonies on the
Continent,

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.560
which is one of the
wonderful--Actually,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.259
that's short compared with some
eighteenth-century pamphlet

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.742
titles that go on;
when you're making footnotes

00:05:10.742 --> 00:05:13.459
you have these titles that go on
for five lines.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:16.338
But we'll call it "Short
Hints," which will be much

00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:16.769
easier.
 

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:19.538
So "Short Hints"
is this memorandum drawn up by

00:05:19.538 --> 00:05:22.228
this committee,
and "Short Hints"

00:05:22.228 --> 00:05:26.357
starts out by setting forth the
basic problem of thinking about

00:05:26.357 --> 00:05:30.819
what to do to even consider some
kind of form of colonial union.

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.930
What they say at the beginning
of this document is,

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.822
"In such a scheme (in a
scheme of colonial union) the

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:41.990
just prerogative of the Crown
must be preserved or it will not

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.860
be approved and confirmed in
England,

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.670
and the just liberties of the
people must be secured or the

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.680
several colonies will disapprove
of it and oppose it."

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.925
Okay.
 

00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:55.940
It's a pretty tricky balancing
act that we're talking about.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.540
So to accomplish both of these
things,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.759
"Short Hints"
proposed preserving individual

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.060
colonial charters and,
sort of along the lines of what

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.911
Franklin had envisioned,
erecting a sort of new

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:14.129
structure of government above
the colonial charters.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.699
So it does propose a Grand
Council which would have two

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.737
members from each colony,
and these members would be

00:06:22.737 --> 00:06:26.882
chosen by colonial assemblies--
so they're basing power in the

00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:29.565
colonies--
and these members of the Grand

00:06:29.565 --> 00:06:31.930
Council would serve for three
years.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.483
And, there would be a President
General that would be appointed

00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:38.988
by the Crown,
paid for by the British

00:06:38.988 --> 00:06:41.629
government,
who could veto or approve acts

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.184
of the Grand Council,
and would have the duty to

00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:46.480
carry them out.
 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.382
And the authority and power of
both the President and this

00:06:50.382 --> 00:06:53.259
Council would extend to Indian
affairs,

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.978
the purchase and settlement of
lands that are outside the

00:06:56.978 --> 00:06:59.370
boundaries of an existing
colony,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.240
and common defense.
 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.028
And each colony would
contribute to financing this new

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:08.079
level of government based on
some kind of a quota that they

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:09.290
would all agree on.
 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.572
So basically there--the
"Short Hints"

00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:14.303
is suggesting something along
the lines of what Franklin

00:07:14.303 --> 00:07:14.949
imagined.
 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:18.079
It's balancing royal authority
and the power of the colonial

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:21.033
legislatures,
trying to sort of pay homage to

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:23.694
both,
making a limited sphere in

00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:27.389
which this level of government
can operate.

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.726
And Franklin,
not surprisingly,

00:07:29.726 --> 00:07:33.855
ultimately was asked to
finalize a plan of union based

00:07:33.855 --> 00:07:37.750
on what's laid out in
"Short Hints."

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.636
And the Albany Congress
actually approved of this plan

00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:46.329
in July of 1754 and the Congress
then sent a copy to the colonial

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:49.190
assemblies for their
consideration.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.600
So, they come up with a plan;
they pass the plan;

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.999
and they actually pass it along
the colonies,

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:56.690
which was a significant step.
 

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.716
And this came to be known as
the Albany Plan of Union,

00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:05.199
which makes sense--Albany
Congress, Albany Plan of Union.

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:09.345
The Albany Plan of Union was
the most detailed proposal to

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:13.418
create a union among the
American colonies ever attempted

00:08:13.418 --> 00:08:15.310
before the Revolution.
 

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.689
However, the ending of this
will not be surprising.

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:24.038
Colonial legislatures were not
too excited by this idea for two

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:24.740
reasons.
 

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.081
Some colonial legislators
denounced it as an attack on the

00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:30.910
authority of the King.
 

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.779
Others were afraid that it
would undermine colonial

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:37.245
charters,
so although it tried to address

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:41.272
both halves of this equation,
people protested for both

00:08:41.272 --> 00:08:42.168
reasons.
 

00:08:42.168 --> 00:08:43.220
It's going to undermine the
Crown;

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.293
it's going to undermine the
colonies, the colonial

00:08:45.293 --> 00:08:45.928
legislatures.
 

00:08:45.928 --> 00:08:48.717
So not surprisingly,
it failed, and as Benjamin

00:08:48.717 --> 00:08:52.113
Franklin put it at the time--He
was extremely frustrated.

00:08:52.113 --> 00:08:52.720
Right?
 

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.720
He had the idea.
 

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.543
He actually watched the Albany
Congress kind of move in the

00:08:56.543 --> 00:08:58.928
direction, passes it,
goes out to the colonies.

00:08:58.928 --> 00:09:00.700
Franklin's probably thinking
'oh, I had this idea.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.509
It seemed like a good idea.
 

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:02.559
It might actually go into
effect.'

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:04.850
No.
 

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.620
So as he put it at the time,
"Everyone cries a union is

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.648
necessary but when they come to
the manner and form of the union

00:09:12.648 --> 00:09:16.100
their weak noodles are perfectly
distracted."

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.528
That's a very Franklinesque
kind of comment.

00:09:18.528 --> 00:09:21.121
"Weak noodles"
is also not a phrase you see in

00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:23.950
that many sort of [laughs]
documents from the time period.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.711
So Albany Plan of Union,
for one reason or another,

00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:31.851
fails like other attempts at
colonial unity that sort of

00:09:31.851 --> 00:09:32.980
faded away.
 

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.880
As we're going to see in
lectures coming up and even

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.765
partly in today's lecture,
it would end up taking a crisis

00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:45.808
that threatened not just
colonial well-being,

00:09:45.808 --> 00:09:50.019
but also what colonists
perceived to be their rights,

00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:54.344
to inspire the colonists to
really band together in shared

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.379
purpose as British-American
colonists.

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:01.533
And that brings us to the real
topic of today's lecture,

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.950
which is the Stamp Act crisis.
 

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.020
Now as I mentioned before -- I
think it's one or two lectures

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.192
ago--
before this crisis,

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:13.580
with the close of the French
and Indian War,

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.543
colonial love and respect for
things English was at a real

00:10:17.543 --> 00:10:21.855
high because during that war the
colonists had fought alongside

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:25.750
English soldiers against
England's long-time enemy,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.379
the French, and had won.
 

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:31.667
So the colonists after the
French and Indian War are at a

00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:34.828
moment of high patriotism,
but of course what they

00:10:34.828 --> 00:10:38.701
couldn't foresee was the chain
of events that were going to be

00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:41.240
set off by the French and Indian
War.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:47.440
The Crown had spent vast
amounts of money on the war--

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.850
money that somehow was going to
have to be regained--

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.154
and this sort of basic economic
reality was going to end up

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:59.163
launching a debate about
colonial rights and privileges

00:10:59.163 --> 00:11:03.619
that obviously down the road is
going to have some pretty big

00:11:03.619 --> 00:11:05.028
consequences.
 

00:11:05.028 --> 00:11:07.950
And now we're going to
basically look at what happens

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.375
in response to this budgetary
crisis about all the money spent

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.788
in fighting the French and
Indian War,

00:11:13.788 --> 00:11:19.208
and it begins with the opening
of the 1764 budget debate in the

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:23.003
House of Commons and so--
It always begins--It begins

00:11:23.003 --> 00:11:23.798
with a budget.
 

00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:27.177
It begins with a budget
problem, and George Grenville,

00:11:27.177 --> 00:11:30.298
who is the King's Prime
Minister, is the cause.

00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:34.860
And Grenville is given the task
of figuring out how to fund this

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.308
enormous war debt.
 

00:11:36.308 --> 00:11:40.066
So first, before 1764,
before the moment we're talking

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:44.317
about here, Grenville actually
had taxed people in England to

00:11:44.317 --> 00:11:46.870
help pay for this enormous debt.
 

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.000
So he established new taxes on
stamps;

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.725
he taxed windows--and actually
those of you who have been to

00:11:53.725 --> 00:11:57.767
England and you've probably seen
some buildings where the windows

00:11:57.767 --> 00:12:01.451
were bricked in;
that was to avoid the window

00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:01.798
tax.
 

00:12:01.798 --> 00:12:02.490
Right?
 

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.251
[laughs]
'I don't want to pay a tax on

00:12:04.251 --> 00:12:07.298
my window, so I will eliminate
my window by covering it over.'

00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:10.870
So Grenville established a
number of taxes in England.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.580
He established some duties on
domestic goods.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.673
And even the King reduced his
household expenses.

00:12:17.673 --> 00:12:18.190
Right?
 

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.404
Oh, [laughs]
even the King decided not to

00:12:20.404 --> 00:12:23.950
buy the really expensive kind of
whatever it is he was buying.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.580
'I'll go down one grade.'
 

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.639
I don't know how much he
reduced his expenses but he

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:32.058
tried, so the moral of this
is--England is taxed first.

00:12:32.058 --> 00:12:36.255
But next, logically enough,
Grenville turned to the

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.178
colonies.
 

00:12:37.178 --> 00:12:41.224
Now he didn't think and he
didn't argue that the colonies

00:12:41.224 --> 00:12:44.113
should be paying for,
generally speaking,

00:12:44.113 --> 00:12:46.279
the English national debt.
 

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:50.535
However, there was a standing
army of ten thousand men that

00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:54.351
had been left behind in the
colonies after the war to

00:12:54.351 --> 00:12:59.048
protect the colonies from the
French that were still there,

00:12:59.048 --> 00:13:00.690
to protect them from Native
Americans,

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.145
maybe to protect them from the
Spanish that were also somewhere

00:13:04.145 --> 00:13:05.538
there on the continent.
 

00:13:05.538 --> 00:13:09.155
And Grenville did feel that the
colonies should help pay for

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.240
that--for that army left behind.
 

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.850
He also thought that colonial
taxes were relatively low,

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.346
and he knew that smuggling with
the French during the war with

00:13:21.346 --> 00:13:25.918
the French had been a little bit
rampant in the colonies during

00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:28.129
the French and Indian War.
 

00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:29.649
It's not a good thing.
 

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:34.354
So basically he put all of that
together and he decided it would

00:13:34.354 --> 00:13:38.908
be both fair and necessary to
clamp down on colonial trade.

00:13:38.908 --> 00:13:44.431
So Grenville decided--and you
could see the logic behind what

00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:47.905
he's doing here--
that he would try to get some

00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:51.477
revenue from the colonies to
support the standing army that's

00:13:51.477 --> 00:13:52.610
in the colonies.
 

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.698
And the first thing that he
did, a sort of a logical thing

00:13:55.698 --> 00:13:59.058
to do based on what I just told
you, he decided he was going to

00:13:59.058 --> 00:14:00.740
try to stamp out smuggling.
 

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.791
He was going to try and at
least stop something that

00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:07.142
shouldn't be happening--and
money was leaking out through

00:14:07.142 --> 00:14:07.980
smuggling.
 

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.605
But once he began to focus on
this problem,

00:14:11.605 --> 00:14:16.440
it became easy to see why
smuggling was so widespread.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.216
Colonial customs collectors,
who were supposed to be in the

00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:22.690
colonies attending to their
duties,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.783
collecting customs,
often left the colonies and

00:14:25.783 --> 00:14:29.885
went back to England and left
their deputies in charge back in

00:14:29.885 --> 00:14:31.028
the colonies.
 

00:14:31.028 --> 00:14:33.794
I mentioned before that not
everybody was really excited to

00:14:33.794 --> 00:14:36.530
be based in the colonies,
and so here there were some

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.802
people at least who went back to
England and sort of left things

00:14:39.802 --> 00:14:41.360
in their deputies' control.
 

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.904
So not surprisingly,
what this meant in part was,

00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:49.041
some of the people left in
charge were probably less than

00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:51.110
focused on their duties.
 

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.470
There were some of these
deputies who actually collected

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.019
bribes.
 

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:58.261
There were some of them that
just allowed the smuggling to

00:14:58.261 --> 00:15:00.879
happen, rather than collecting
customs fees.

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:02.990
So you have a leaky system.
 

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.355
So Grenville--looking at what's
going on here,

00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:10.543
discovers the source of the
smuggling problem--orders the

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:13.759
collectors to get back to the
colonies.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:14.509
'Please. This is your job.
 

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:15.750
You must go back to the
colonies.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.298
I'm really sorry but you must
go back and do your job.'

00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:23.581
And he told colonial governors
to watch over what's happening

00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:27.649
and to report to him any
smuggling that they might see.

00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:30.065
Now clearly,
to the colonists,

00:15:30.065 --> 00:15:34.730
the British now seemed to be
paying attention to colonial

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.230
affairs a little bit more than
they were used to,

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.164
and taking action in ways that
perhaps they had not taken

00:15:43.164 --> 00:15:44.288
action before.
 

00:15:44.288 --> 00:15:45.633
Now these are pretty mild
steps.

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:45.980
Right?
 

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.895
'Smuggling isn't supposed to be
happening so I am going to act

00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:49.899
against smuggling.'
 

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:53.350
It's not an enormous strike by
Grenville,

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.956
but still, it certainly would
have indicated to the colonists

00:15:57.956 --> 00:16:02.485
that this period of salutary
neglect of colonial trade might

00:16:02.485 --> 00:16:05.250
be shifting into something else.
 

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.200
Customs collectors had to do
their job;

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.970
smuggling needed to be
suppressed;

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.134
and people who were caught
violating trade laws had to

00:16:15.134 --> 00:16:19.772
travel for their trial to a
Vice-Admiralty court in Halifax,

00:16:19.772 --> 00:16:21.029
Nova Scotia.
 

00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:21.908
Okay.
 

00:16:21.908 --> 00:16:24.018
That was highly unpopular,
not that Nova Scotia

00:16:24.018 --> 00:16:25.759
is--anything wrong with Nova
Scotia.

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:27.965
However, if you are a person
who is now being caught for

00:16:27.965 --> 00:16:29.730
doing something you've always
been doing,

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.200
smuggling, and some official
decides he's going to sort of

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.879
come after you and make you pay
for that,

00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:40.009
you needed to have a trial in
Nova Scotia.

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:43.947
You needed to post bond
yourself for the cost of the

00:16:43.947 --> 00:16:48.423
trial, and at these trials,
a Vice-Admiralty court does not

00:16:48.423 --> 00:16:49.658
have a jury.
 

00:16:49.658 --> 00:16:52.024
We're going to come back to
that, but obviously for all of

00:16:52.024 --> 00:16:54.100
these reasons this would not be
a popular thing.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.567
Clearly, Grenville was serious
about clamping down on

00:16:58.567 --> 00:16:59.600
smuggling.
 

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.113
Now, Grenville also established
some duties on foreign goods

00:17:06.113 --> 00:17:10.640
shipped in to the colonies,
like sugar.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.051
Foreign rum,
French wine:

00:17:13.051 --> 00:17:18.480
both were prohibited from
import in to the colonies.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.970
Items like iron and animal
hides were added to the general

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.690
list of goods that had a duty
attached to them.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.352
There were new higher duties
placed on coffee,

00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:36.827
on indigo, on certain kinds of
wine--all of these things

00:17:36.827 --> 00:17:39.269
largely non-British goods.
 

00:17:39.269 --> 00:17:43.414
And goods that had to pass
through England on their way to

00:17:43.414 --> 00:17:46.180
the colonies had their duty
doubled.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.877
The one little ray of sunshine
here amidst all of these duties

00:17:50.877 --> 00:17:55.500
is that the duty on foreign
molasses was reduced by half--

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.692
and molasses was really central
to New England distilleries

00:17:58.692 --> 00:18:01.606
producing rum,
so I think Grenville probably

00:18:01.606 --> 00:18:03.710
thought well,
that might be a good thing.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.950
Right?
 

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:04.230
Yeah.
 

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.867
'There's a lot of duties on
foreign imports but I'm reducing

00:18:06.867 --> 00:18:09.326
the duty on foreign molasses,
so those New Englanders at

00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:10.578
least should be pleased.
 

00:18:10.578 --> 00:18:14.259
It'll be a little cheaper for
them to produce rum.'

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:17.618
So lump together all of those
things: all of those duties,

00:18:17.618 --> 00:18:20.714
all of the new duties,
the changes in the cost of

00:18:20.714 --> 00:18:24.583
imported goods and the things
that no longer were going to be

00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:27.548
allowed to be imported in to the
colonies.

00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:31.236
That all gets known under the
sort of big name,

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.160
the Sugar Act of 1764.
 

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.730
The Sugar Act of 1764.
 

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.730
In England it was also known
logically enough as the American

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:40.430
Revenue Act.
 

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.005
[laughs]
It's a good way to remember

00:18:42.005 --> 00:18:43.940
exactly what it was supposed to
be doing.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.470
And, as I said,
Grenville thought 'well,

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.663
that whole molasses thing means
it's not going to be that

00:18:49.663 --> 00:18:51.974
objectionable to the colonists
because I'm actually offering

00:18:51.974 --> 00:18:54.599
them something as I'm charging
them more on some other things.'

00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:56.118
Now a side note here.
 

00:18:56.118 --> 00:18:58.324
We're going to see more of this
later, but I'm going to mention

00:18:58.324 --> 00:18:58.680
it here.
 

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.005
What we're seeing here is a
hint of a pattern that's going

00:19:02.005 --> 00:19:05.038
to reveal itself over the course
of the semester--

00:19:05.038 --> 00:19:08.991
is that clearly the British and
in this case Grenville is trying

00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:12.380
to anticipate the colonial
reaction to his actions,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.578
to what he's doing to British
policy.

00:19:14.578 --> 00:19:18.460
But here, as we'll see--there
are later examples as well--

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.598
he's wrong about the colonial
understanding of the British

00:19:22.598 --> 00:19:25.210
imperial system,
and of the colonists'

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.318
understanding of their place in
it.

00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:30.189
So what we're going to see
again and again and again in one

00:19:30.189 --> 00:19:32.413
way or another is:
the British assume that the

00:19:32.413 --> 00:19:35.432
colonists are going to do one
particular thing or that they're

00:19:35.432 --> 00:19:37.509
going to think in a particular
way,

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:41.279
and the colonists end up doing
or thinking something different.

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:44.575
Which in a sense makes sense
because you have royal officials

00:19:44.575 --> 00:19:46.818
in England;
they're an ocean away.

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:50.692
They don't necessarily
understand the evolving colonial

00:19:50.692 --> 00:19:51.410
mindset.
 

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.509
It's not like the colonists
themselves have been standing

00:19:53.509 --> 00:19:55.160
back and saying,
'We are evolving a different

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.910
mindset.' Right?
 

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.200
Things are sort of percolating
along and now,

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.414
the events that we're beginning
to talk about today are going to

00:20:01.414 --> 00:20:04.068
begin to reveal differences in
opinions and ideas.

00:20:04.068 --> 00:20:08.511
So, an ocean away they're
assuming that the colonists are

00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:11.904
going to act in a certain way,
the colonists don't

00:20:11.904 --> 00:20:13.618
necessarily, and it's part of
the point--

00:20:13.618 --> 00:20:15.328
part of the problem to the
colonists.

00:20:15.328 --> 00:20:18.930
These people are an ocean away,
and as we'll see,

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.881
don't necessarily understand
what's going on in the

00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:23.042
colonies--
or certainly,

00:20:23.042 --> 00:20:24.960
what the colonists are thinking
about what's going on.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.210
I'm going to come back to that
again in today's lecture.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.996
So Grenville thinks 'oh,
okay, probably this act all in

00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:36.288
all might balance itself out;
it won't be so bad.'

00:20:36.288 --> 00:20:40.585
But the colonists only saw that
the English suddenly seemed to

00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:44.105
be putting teeth into the
imperial system to really

00:20:44.105 --> 00:20:46.500
enforce rules and regulations.
 

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.390
And in enforcing these rules
and regulations,

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.906
they were demanding that
violators travel to Nova Scotia

00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:56.881
at their own cost,
posting bond for their own

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:59.140
trials even if they were
innocent,

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.269
and as I mentioned before this
Vice-Admiralty court in Nova

00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:04.662
Scotia,
which basically is a court for

00:21:04.662 --> 00:21:08.009
crimes at sea,
did not have a jury.

00:21:08.009 --> 00:21:14.923
At about the same time in 1764,
Grenville also decided he's

00:21:14.923 --> 00:21:20.170
going to clamp down on colonial
currency,

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:25.659
because during the war several
colonies and especially Virginia

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:29.288
had issued vast amounts of paper
money.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:33.452
And Grenville basically--He's
trying to assert control over

00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:35.318
the monetary system too.
 

00:21:35.318 --> 00:21:39.711
So in 1764, he passes the
Currency Act,

00:21:39.711 --> 00:21:46.529
and the Currency Act says the
colonies can't issue money;

00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:50.478
that any act passed by a
colonial legislature that

00:21:50.478 --> 00:21:53.460
violates this act is null and
void;

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:58.154
and that any colonial governor
who consented to such an act on

00:21:58.154 --> 00:22:02.334
the part of the colonies--
any colonial governor that

00:22:02.334 --> 00:22:05.450
allows his colony to produce
currency--

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.960
would be fined a thousand
pounds, which is a huge amount

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.540
of money at that point,
would be dismissed from office,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.012
and would be ineligible from
any public office in future.

00:22:16.012 --> 00:22:16.509
Okay.
 

00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:18.943
That's obviously a serious --
'We really, really,

00:22:18.943 --> 00:22:21.480
really mean this about the
whole currency issue.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.910
We're putting some serious
punishments on the line here.'

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.156
So taken altogether,
Americans--colonists--drew

00:22:29.156 --> 00:22:34.788
several not-so-happy conclusions
from all of these actions.

00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:38.577
So first, obviously they're
alarmed at the sudden clamping

00:22:38.577 --> 00:22:42.828
down on what in their eyes at
least had been a working system.

00:22:42.828 --> 00:22:43.010
Right?
 

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.829
'Everything has been okay.
 

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:45.160
The system's working.
 

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.430
We're profiting from what we're
doing.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.250
The Crown, the empire,
is profiting too.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.808
It's working perfectly well.'
 

00:22:50.808 --> 00:22:53.751
Now all of a sudden things are
being changed and teeth are

00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:56.230
being put in where there weren't
teeth before.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.704
Second, informed that they had
to go to Nova Scotia if they

00:22:59.704 --> 00:23:03.240
smuggled and that there'd be no
jury during their trial,

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.788
they began to feel like
second-class citizens being

00:23:06.788 --> 00:23:10.550
denied a basic fundamental
British right of a trial by

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.190
jury.
 

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:17.642
Third, they were alarmed at the
implications of the Currency Act

00:23:17.642 --> 00:23:22.190
because the implications are,
if you think about it,

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.596
Grenville basically saying he
can nullify an act passed by a

00:23:25.596 --> 00:23:26.808
colonial assembly.
 

00:23:26.808 --> 00:23:31.267
That's--in the minds of the
colonists--a pretty alarming

00:23:31.267 --> 00:23:32.240
precedent.
 

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.544
And then finally,
fourth, colonists were also

00:23:35.544 --> 00:23:39.750
alarmed that these new duties
and these new acts that are

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.182
being enforced were largely
intended to fund a standing army

00:23:44.182 --> 00:23:47.790
in the colonies,
a standing army that Parliament

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.624
saw as being protective,
but you can also see how the

00:23:50.624 --> 00:23:52.506
colonists might have seen this
as a threat.

00:23:52.506 --> 00:23:52.910
Right?
 

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.492
'Well, if we don't listen to
all of this stuff,

00:23:55.492 --> 00:23:58.920
there is a standing army here
that we're actually funding.'

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.785
So the colonists could have
seen that armed force as a sign

00:24:02.785 --> 00:24:06.650
of tyranny, as a threat to
enforce colonial cooperation.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.583
So for all of these reasons,
these acts are problematic,

00:24:10.583 --> 00:24:13.299
threatening,
frightening and get people

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:14.230
thinking.
 

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.588
As Massachusetts radical James
Otis said,

00:24:17.588 --> 00:24:22.380
"The passage of the Sugar
Act set people a thinking,

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.240
in six months,
more than they had done in

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.455
their whole lives before."
 

00:24:27.455 --> 00:24:28.098
Right?
 

00:24:28.098 --> 00:24:29.978
It's like, 'wow,
that was a lot,

00:24:29.978 --> 00:24:33.068
and suddenly we really are
evaluating how things are

00:24:33.068 --> 00:24:34.160
working here.'
 

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.940
And obviously what people are
thinking about is their basic

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.328
rights as English subjects.
 

00:24:41.328 --> 00:24:44.993
Now logically enough,
there was a colonial response

00:24:44.993 --> 00:24:48.730
to Grenville's actions and--as
we'll see, and also a

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.588
pattern--Massachusetts led the
way.

00:24:51.588 --> 00:24:54.898
So one example:
There was a Boston town meeting

00:24:54.898 --> 00:24:58.928
that met and decided to inform
the Massachusetts Colonial

00:24:58.928 --> 00:25:03.101
Assembly that they objected to
Grenville's actions and that

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:07.490
they proposed united action in
the colonies to protest.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.368
Now this is just a town meeting
saying,

00:25:09.368 --> 00:25:12.255
'well, we the town of Whatever
don't like what's going on and

00:25:12.255 --> 00:25:14.660
we think the colonies should
unite and protest.'

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.433
So it's not necessarily a
proposition that's going to get

00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:17.980
acted on.
 

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.038
Nothing really happens to this,
but it does represent a pretty

00:25:22.038 --> 00:25:25.191
radical suggestion and,
as I've already discussed,

00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:28.579
it's a radical suggestion that
is being launched for what feels

00:25:28.579 --> 00:25:30.328
like reasons of self-defense.
 

00:25:30.328 --> 00:25:33.868
So--but even though this
doesn't get passed,

00:25:33.868 --> 00:25:36.973
the language of this petition
that comes from this town

00:25:36.973 --> 00:25:40.250
meeting really reveals a lot
about some of the fundamental

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.863
fears of the colonists,
and I'm going to just quote a

00:25:43.863 --> 00:25:45.588
sentence or two from it.
 

00:25:45.588 --> 00:25:50.315
"But what still heightens
our apprehensions is that those

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:54.730
unexpected proceedings may be
preparatory to new taxations

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.660
upon us.
 

00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.703
This we apprehend annihilates
our charter right to govern and

00:26:00.703 --> 00:26:02.048
tax ourselves.
 

00:26:02.048 --> 00:26:04.645
It strikes at our British
privileges which as we have

00:26:04.645 --> 00:26:07.741
never forfeited them we hold in
common with our fellow subjects

00:26:07.741 --> 00:26:09.588
who are natives of
Britain."

00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:12.308
That's a pretty strong
statement.

00:26:12.308 --> 00:26:16.308
Clearly, the main problem here
isn't just financial.

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:19.278
We don't have a lot of people
who are just irked that they

00:26:19.278 --> 00:26:20.578
have to pay more money.
 

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:22.891
More important,
it's the meaning of what's

00:26:22.891 --> 00:26:25.259
going on that's upsetting the
colonists.

00:26:25.259 --> 00:26:26.858
It's the ways in which their
rights,

00:26:26.858 --> 00:26:29.720
as that petition put it,
as natives of Britain,

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.107
seemingly are being violated as
well as the sense on the part of

00:26:34.107 --> 00:26:38.148
these colonists that they can't
figure out yet quite how to

00:26:38.148 --> 00:26:40.029
voice their grievances.
 

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:42.618
They don't have a direct
representative in Parliament,

00:26:42.618 --> 00:26:43.976
they're upset,
they're trying to figure out

00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:46.621
what to do about it--
but I think that little hole in

00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:49.808
the system was also revealing
itself at this point.

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:53.501
Now the British government
didn't really listen to colonial

00:26:53.501 --> 00:26:56.393
protest as it was,
they didn't really sort of pick

00:26:56.393 --> 00:26:58.950
up on the tone of things going
on in the colonies.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:04.894
And in fact Grenville continued
along with his revenue plan,

00:27:04.894 --> 00:27:10.236
and in March of 1765 he
proposed and Parliament passed

00:27:10.236 --> 00:27:12.048
the Stamp Act.
 

00:27:12.048 --> 00:27:17.469
The Stamp Act said that stamped
paper had to be used for all

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:20.837
kinds of documents,
for legal documents,

00:27:20.837 --> 00:27:23.549
for college diplomas,
for land deeds,

00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:26.259
for contracts,
for bills of sale,

00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:28.598
for liquor licenses,
for playing cards,

00:27:28.598 --> 00:27:32.160
pamphlets, newspapers,
almanacs, broadsides.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.679
All kinds of paper products now
needed to be using this special

00:27:36.679 --> 00:27:40.980
stamped paper --and this special
stamped paper cost more.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.335
So basically,
the Stamp Act is placing a tax

00:27:44.335 --> 00:27:48.940
on all of these items by making
people buy stamped paper for

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.529
them, and stamped paper is more
expensive.

00:27:52.529 --> 00:27:57.650
So what's significant about the
Stamp Act: It's the first direct

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:02.119
tax levied by Parliament
directly upon the colonists.

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:05.230
It's not a duty on shipping.
 

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.925
It's a tax levied by Parliament
directly upon the colonists and

00:28:08.925 --> 00:28:11.430
what they're purchasing in the
colonies.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.200
So basically,
if you needed a legal document,

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.587
if you were printing
newspapers, you had to buy

00:28:17.587 --> 00:28:22.303
stamped paper from special stamp
agents who were appointed by the

00:28:22.303 --> 00:28:23.038
Crown.
 

00:28:23.038 --> 00:28:26.488
Now I can't resist adding here
only because -- I probably

00:28:26.488 --> 00:28:28.890
mentioned something like this
before.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.096
As an early American historian,
you don't get to sort of live

00:28:32.096 --> 00:28:33.378
your history that often.
 

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:33.859
Right?
 

00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:34.808
It's pretty far away.
 

00:28:34.808 --> 00:28:36.727
I look for opportunities to
live my history but it doesn't

00:28:36.727 --> 00:28:37.400
happen that often.
 

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.910
I've actually shot off a
dueling pistol.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:43.029
I tried to learn to ride.
 

00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:45.071
I tried basically to be an
eighteenth-century gentleman.

00:28:45.071 --> 00:28:45.368
Right?
 

00:28:45.368 --> 00:28:47.858
I took fencing lessons--I took
riding lessons--

00:28:47.858 --> 00:28:50.855
I shot off dueling pistols--and
I determined that I would have

00:28:50.855 --> 00:28:53.308
died a thousand times in the
eighteenth century.

00:28:53.308 --> 00:28:56.019
[laughter]
I was just bad on all counts.

00:28:56.019 --> 00:28:57.799
But in this case I wasn't
trying to be an

00:28:57.799 --> 00:28:59.180
eighteenth-century gentleman.
 

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.480
I actually was doing research
and I went down to the island of

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.022
Nevis in the Caribbean,
which is where Alexander

00:29:05.022 --> 00:29:06.160
Hamilton is from.
 

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.483
I was doing research on
Hamilton and I wanted to get in

00:29:09.483 --> 00:29:13.115
to this courthouse on the island
which is where they had the

00:29:13.115 --> 00:29:16.380
papers that related to the
history of the island.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.170
And I was told when I went to
do this--

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.930
I showed up at the courthouse
and they said,

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.519
'Well, you need to go see the
stamp man before you can come

00:29:22.519 --> 00:29:25.199
here because you need to buy a
stamp and then you need to put

00:29:25.199 --> 00:29:27.834
it in a book and you need to
swear an oath,' and there was a

00:29:27.834 --> 00:29:29.710
whole bunch of stuff I needed to
do.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.137
Nevis used to be a British
island, so I needed to find the

00:29:33.137 --> 00:29:33.858
stamp man.
 

00:29:33.858 --> 00:29:36.326
Okay, but--And oddly enough,
I didn't yet connect with what

00:29:36.326 --> 00:29:37.900
I was going to be experiencing
yet.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.980
I'm just like:
must find stamp man.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.028
[laughter]
So the stamp man I was told,

00:29:42.028 --> 00:29:45.210
I think, was in the--logically
enough in the post office.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.500
However, the stamp man's hours
were unclear to me.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.200
I couldn't figure out when he
was there.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.740
It took me a long time to find
the stamp man and to buy the

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.500
stamp, and then I had to go back
to the courthouse and I did.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.885
I had to paste it in a book and
I had to swear an oath of some

00:29:57.885 --> 00:29:58.160
kind.
 

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.476
And there was this whole sort
of colonial experience I was

00:30:01.476 --> 00:30:02.000
having.
 

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.078
But in the middle of this,
when I couldn't find the stamp

00:30:04.078 --> 00:30:05.604
man--
and I was dying to do this

00:30:05.604 --> 00:30:07.846
research--
it was not until I actually

00:30:07.846 --> 00:30:09.960
said out loud,
"Curse that stamp

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.710
man" that it was like:
okay,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.700
I'm living the Revolution.
 

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.368
[laughter] Hate that stamp tax.
 

00:30:17.368 --> 00:30:19.352
It took me a long time to
realize I was having my own

00:30:19.352 --> 00:30:20.838
little personal revolutionary
moment.

00:30:20.838 --> 00:30:23.940
And I should say that I don't
want Nevis to look bad.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.153
Actually, it was a wonderful
place to visit and the people

00:30:26.153 --> 00:30:27.630
were wonderful on that island to
me.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.932
It was just--I couldn't find
the stamp man and it--I just had

00:30:30.932 --> 00:30:32.308
a Revolution flashback.
 

00:30:32.308 --> 00:30:34.406
And I ultimately did the whole
ritual and got to use the

00:30:34.406 --> 00:30:36.768
records and they were great,
but I had my own little

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:39.739
personal stamp tax moment which
kind of blew my mind at the

00:30:39.739 --> 00:30:41.630
time,
not -- it would not be the

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.710
first thing I think I would get
to experience here in--

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.318
I guess at the time--in the
twentieth century.

00:30:46.318 --> 00:30:46.650
Okay.
 

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.220
So Stamp Act--I understood the
rage of the Stamp Act.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.568
Now back to Grenville,
Mr. Stamp Act.

00:30:53.568 --> 00:30:57.367
Clearly, all these things I'm
talking to you about--He's

00:30:57.367 --> 00:31:01.580
passing multiple acts trying to
get some control over colonial

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.410
finance.
 

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.699
And from his point of view,
he's doing this to pay for the

00:31:06.699 --> 00:31:09.710
protection of the colonies
themselves.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.193
So the money being raised from
all of these things actually

00:31:13.193 --> 00:31:16.740
would have gone into a fund for
defense of the colonies--

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.646
and even when you take all of
these fundraising activities

00:31:20.646 --> 00:31:23.415
together,
all of the money from all of

00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:27.518
these duties and taxes added up
to only about a third of the

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:31.690
cost of maintaining that
colonial military establishment.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.309
But to the colonists,
they were being taxed without

00:31:35.309 --> 00:31:38.496
their consent,
and their rights to some basic

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:42.190
fundamental British rights were
being abridged;

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.420
their basic rights as English
subjects were being attacked.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.104
And this is important to note
because I think we all have 'no

00:31:49.104 --> 00:31:51.743
taxation without representation'
sort of running through our

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:51.967
head.
 

00:31:51.967 --> 00:31:52.460
Right?
 

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.464
That's what the Revolution is
about--as though the Revolution

00:31:55.464 --> 00:31:58.220
is all about people who are
angry about paying taxes.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.750
But obviously it's about much
more than that.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.038
We're talking about fundamental
rights being violated,

00:32:03.038 --> 00:32:04.868
people feeling that there's
something more than just,

00:32:04.868 --> 00:32:07.287
'I don't like paying
taxes'--but it's what that

00:32:07.287 --> 00:32:09.055
means,
what this whole way of

00:32:09.055 --> 00:32:12.586
operating suggests and implies
about fundamental rights about

00:32:12.586 --> 00:32:15.588
the position of the colonists
within the empire.

00:32:15.588 --> 00:32:20.800
Now, the British response to
colonial grumbling about these

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.294
measures was to argue that
colonists were virtually

00:32:25.294 --> 00:32:29.560
represented in Parliament--
virtual representation--that in

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.189
Parliament there were members
who represented the entire

00:32:32.189 --> 00:32:34.529
British realm,
and so the colonists were

00:32:34.529 --> 00:32:35.890
virtually represented.
 

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.093
And the argument would have
been: there were also people in

00:32:39.093 --> 00:32:42.405
England proper who did not get
to directly vote for their own

00:32:42.405 --> 00:32:45.455
representatives in Parliament,
so colonial rights of

00:32:45.455 --> 00:32:47.368
representation aren't under
attack.

00:32:47.368 --> 00:32:50.022
What's happening in the
colonies isn't that different

00:32:50.022 --> 00:32:52.829
from what happened to some
people who would have been in

00:32:52.829 --> 00:32:53.798
England proper.
 

00:32:53.798 --> 00:32:57.156
But in the colonies,
where colonial representatives

00:32:57.156 --> 00:33:00.650
often got direct instructions
from town meetings--

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.578
where you're really seeing some
really direct representation--

00:33:03.578 --> 00:33:08.130
virtual representation was not
always a convincing argument.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.294
And actually,
as one Maryland petition at the

00:33:10.294 --> 00:33:12.163
time put it, virtual
representation is,

00:33:12.163 --> 00:33:14.328
quote, "fantastical and
frivolous."

00:33:14.328 --> 00:33:14.920
Right?
 

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.660
I love the alliteration there,
fantastical and frivolous.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.405
This whole virtual
representation thing,

00:33:20.405 --> 00:33:22.798
they weren't necessarily
buying.

00:33:22.798 --> 00:33:26.492
As someone argued at the time,
in England such an assertion

00:33:26.492 --> 00:33:30.186
about virtual representation
might be true because a member

00:33:30.186 --> 00:33:33.499
of Parliament probably had
similar interests to other

00:33:33.499 --> 00:33:37.156
inhabitants of England,
but what would a member of

00:33:37.156 --> 00:33:39.779
Parliament know of colonial
interests?

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:42.308
And even worse,
as some colonists reasoned,

00:33:42.308 --> 00:33:45.681
maybe members of Parliament
might actually have interests

00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:48.088
that were opposed to the
colonists'.

00:33:48.088 --> 00:33:51.537
Maybe they'd actually want to
tax the colonies more,

00:33:51.537 --> 00:33:54.848
so that they themselves would
have to pay less.

00:33:54.848 --> 00:33:58.980
So basically at the heart of
these colonial grievances were

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:03.038
assumptions about British rights
and British liberties.

00:34:03.038 --> 00:34:06.288
Liberties were rooted in
property.

00:34:06.288 --> 00:34:09.081
At the time,
a slave would have been defined

00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:12.849
as someone who depended entirely
on the will of others,

00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:16.166
so to be free and to be
independent you needed to be in

00:34:16.166 --> 00:34:18.070
control of your own property.
 

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:22.317
Directly taxing without consent
seemed to threaten colonial

00:34:22.317 --> 00:34:26.418
property rights and--again--to
fundamentally attack basic

00:34:26.418 --> 00:34:28.030
English liberties.
 

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.360
Okay.
 

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.458
So now we have a whole list of
grievances here bundled up under

00:34:32.458 --> 00:34:35.302
the idea of threatened liberties
and rights.

00:34:35.302 --> 00:34:36.030
Right?
 

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.978
We have the first direct tax
from parliament on colonists,

00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:43.650
and it might be the precedent
for more such things.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:48.550
We have violation of colonial
rights to a trial by jury.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.202
We have a seeming attack on the
colonial economy,

00:34:51.202 --> 00:34:54.630
where things are suddenly being
regulated in some way that they

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.400
haven't seemed to be before.
 

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.829
We have the threat of directly
overriding colonial legislation

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:02.210
and legislatures.
 

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.809
So you can see why all of these
things would have been pretty

00:35:05.809 --> 00:35:07.791
alarming,
but there were also two

00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:10.480
important unintended outcomes of
the Stamp Act,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.130
in addition to all of those
raised fears.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:18.775
Unintended outcome number one:
Because the Stamp Act attacked

00:35:18.775 --> 00:35:23.344
all of the colonies equally,
it actually helped to join them

00:35:23.344 --> 00:35:25.590
together in shared cause.
 

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:30.476
And second, unintended outcome
number two: by attacking people

00:35:30.476 --> 00:35:34.295
who used paper particularly--
right?--lawyers using legal

00:35:34.295 --> 00:35:37.347
documents,
newspaper writers and printers,

00:35:37.347 --> 00:35:40.911
merchants,
ship owners--the act also

00:35:40.911 --> 00:35:42.775
attacked,
specifically,

00:35:42.775 --> 00:35:45.139
the most vocal and prestigious
colonists,

00:35:45.139 --> 00:35:46.389
in addition to everybody else.
 

00:35:46.389 --> 00:35:50.599
So it was attacking people who
had the means to protest,

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:53.949
to say what they were upset
about legally--

00:35:53.949 --> 00:35:58.349
in writing--so it was easy for
people--

00:35:58.349 --> 00:36:02.532
they were logically the people
who would make the loudest

00:36:02.532 --> 00:36:03.280
protest.
 

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.626
So now in this climate of
increasing anxiety on the part

00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:08.628
of the colonists,
we arrive at a Revolutionary

00:36:08.628 --> 00:36:12.619
War moment that most Americans
know: Patrick Henry.

00:36:12.619 --> 00:36:16.077
Patrick Henry's dramatic
declarations in the Virginia

00:36:16.077 --> 00:36:19.800
House of Burgesses on May
30^(th) and 31^(st) of 1765.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.079
And what he's doing at the
time--We all know "Give me

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:24.440
liberty or give me death,"
but we don't really focus on

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.280
why he says that.
 

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.682
He actually was protesting
against the implications of the

00:36:28.682 --> 00:36:29.400
Stamp Act.
 

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.565
Now, I'm sure we all have
pictures in our head,

00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:34.010
images in our head.
 

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:36.494
There are a lot of bad
Revolutionary War movies but

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:39.378
probably even some of the bad
Revolutionary War movies have

00:36:39.378 --> 00:36:40.768
scenes of Patrick Henry.
 

00:36:40.768 --> 00:36:42.510
Well, it's another one of the
founders doing this.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.360
Patrick Henry;
that's what he does.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.050
'Give me liberty or give me
death.'

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.416
So we have a lot of images in
our head about what happened

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:50.079
there--
and then of course we have

00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:52.317
people crying "Treason,
treason,"

00:36:52.317 --> 00:36:55.144
and Henry doing a variety of
brave things and saying a

00:36:55.144 --> 00:36:58.239
variety of brave things as he
makes his bold statement.

00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:01.829
Now it's true that actually
Henry was a dramatic speaker.

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:03.260
He actually was.
 

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.833
Even Thomas Jefferson thought
so, and Thomas Jefferson did not

00:37:05.833 --> 00:37:06.719
like Patrick Henry.
 

00:37:06.719 --> 00:37:08.800
He thought Henry was lazy.
 

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.394
He didn't think Henry was
interested in reading books,

00:37:11.394 --> 00:37:13.599
which to Jefferson would be a
very bad sin.

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:15.610
He thought Henry was a little
reckless--

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.213
and Henry was a little bit of a
sort of rough and ready

00:37:18.213 --> 00:37:21.068
character--
but even Jefferson had to admit

00:37:21.068 --> 00:37:24.449
that Henry had a huge impact on
his audience,

00:37:24.449 --> 00:37:27.710
that he really--when he spoke,
he swayed people's emotions.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.344
And Jefferson also,
it must be said,

00:37:30.344 --> 00:37:33.056
was a notoriously bad public
speaker.

00:37:33.056 --> 00:37:33.809
Right?
 

00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:36.601
He had this quiet voice,
he mumbled, he was nervous,

00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:39.887
he hated speaking in front of
groups, so probably he was also

00:37:39.887 --> 00:37:41.750
a little bit jealous of Henry.
 

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.889
That didn't help him in his
attitude towards Patrick Henry.

00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:46.070
So Henry was actually a great
speaker,

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.914
but rather than stick with
legend and the great orator with

00:37:48.914 --> 00:37:51.635
the finger in the air,
I'm going to offer you here an

00:37:51.635 --> 00:37:54.529
eyewitness account of Henry's
speech from an unnamed French

00:37:54.529 --> 00:37:57.172
traveler who actually was
standing in the lobby of the

00:37:57.172 --> 00:38:00.010
Virginia House of Burgesses--
and Jefferson was there

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.500
too--watching the proceeding.
 

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.559
So this is how this French
traveler describes what he saw.

00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:08.835
"Arrived at Williamsburg
at 12 where I saw three Negroes

00:38:08.835 --> 00:38:11.728
hanging at the gallows for
having robbed Mr. Waltho of

00:38:11.728 --> 00:38:13.530
300 pounds' sterling."
 

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.650
So that's the first sight that
greets him.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.949
"I went immediately to the
Assembly which was seating,

00:38:18.949 --> 00:38:21.844
where I was entertained with
very strong debates concerning

00:38:21.844 --> 00:38:25.239
duties that the Parliament wants
to lay on the American colonies,

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:28.389
which they call of style stamp
duties.

00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:30.860
Shortly after I came in,
one of the members stood up and

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.510
said he had read that in former
times Tarquin and Julius had

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.396
their Brutus,
Charles had his Cromwell,

00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:38.025
and he did not doubt that some
good American would stand up in

00:38:38.025 --> 00:38:40.867
favor of his country;
but says he in a more moderate

00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:42.804
manner,
and was going to continue,

00:38:42.804 --> 00:38:44.789
when the Speaker of the House
rose,

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:47.925
and said, 'The last that stood
up had spoke treason' and he was

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:51.061
sorry to see that not one of the
members of the House was loyal

00:38:51.061 --> 00:38:53.539
enough to stop him before he had
gone so far.

00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:55.775
Upon which the same member
stood up again"

00:38:55.775 --> 00:38:58.302
and it says in parenthesis
"(I think his name is

00:38:58.302 --> 00:39:01.121
Henry) and said that if he had
affronted the Speaker of the

00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:04.231
House he was ready to ask pardon
and he would show his loyalty to

00:39:04.231 --> 00:39:07.099
His Majesty King George the
Third at the expense of the last

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:10.273
drop of his blood,
but what he had said must be

00:39:10.273 --> 00:39:13.804
attributed to the interest of
his country's dying liberty

00:39:13.804 --> 00:39:15.380
which he had at heart.
 

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.364
And the heat of passion might
have led him to say something

00:39:18.364 --> 00:39:21.295
more that he intended;
but, again, if he said anything

00:39:21.295 --> 00:39:24.139
wrong he begged the speaker and
the House's pardon.

00:39:24.139 --> 00:39:26.233
And some other members stood up
and backed him on which the

00:39:26.233 --> 00:39:27.210
affair was dropped."
 

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:27.465
Okay.
 

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:30.324
So that's the eyewitness
account, which is not quite like

00:39:30.324 --> 00:39:32.900
the legend,
but the fact is actually Henry

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.402
did speak pretty boldly and he
did talk about his country's

00:39:36.402 --> 00:39:38.826
dying liberty,
which says a lot about what

00:39:38.826 --> 00:39:42.998
we're talking about right now,
that--the colonial perception

00:39:42.998 --> 00:39:45.409
of lost English liberties.
 

00:39:45.409 --> 00:39:50.704
And ultimately in May of 1765,
the Virginia House of Burgesses

00:39:50.704 --> 00:39:55.391
did end up passing some
resolutions that are ultimately

00:39:55.391 --> 00:39:58.690
known as the Virginia
Resolutions.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.873
And the Virginia Resolutions
said that the colonists had come

00:40:02.873 --> 00:40:07.126
to Virginia with equal rights to
all British subjects and that

00:40:07.126 --> 00:40:11.704
they still retained them;
that Virginians alone had the

00:40:11.704 --> 00:40:14.699
right to directly tax
Virginians;

00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:18.434
and that only those who would
be affected by taxes had the

00:40:18.434 --> 00:40:19.809
right to pass them.
 

00:40:19.809 --> 00:40:21.289
I'll repeat that one more time.
 

00:40:21.289 --> 00:40:24.041
Virginia Resolutions,
May 1765--the colonists had

00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:27.539
come to Virginia with equal
rights to all British subjects;

00:40:27.539 --> 00:40:31.362
they still retained them;
Virginians alone had the right

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:35.327
to directly tax Virginians;
and only those who would be

00:40:35.327 --> 00:40:38.409
affected by taxes had the right
to pass them.

00:40:38.409 --> 00:40:39.869
I will stop there.
 

00:40:39.869 --> 00:40:41.869
We will go on.
 

00:40:41.869 --> 00:40:44.498
We are just--I keep saying
we're going to get to the Stamp

00:40:44.498 --> 00:40:45.190
Act Congress.
 

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.409
We're so close.
 

00:40:46.409 --> 00:40:48.329
We will begin with the Stamp
Act Congress,

00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:50.889
which will lead logically into
the topic of the next lecture,

00:40:50.889 --> 00:40:54.260
which is: what's going on in
Boston,

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.920
and the continued buildup.
 

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.333
We'll see how the Virginia
Resolutions spread to other

00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:00.871
colonies,
and how resistance begins to

00:41:00.871 --> 00:41:04.927
build because of the Stamp Act
and how events continued to

00:41:04.927 --> 00:41:06.849
unfold after that point.
 

00:41:06.849 --> 00:41:08.690
I will see you all on Thursday.
 

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:14.000

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.705
Prof: Where we ended
with last Wednesday was the tail

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:12.650
end of our discussion of the
anti-Enlightenment.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.432
And I think some of you
discussed in section the

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:20.939
difficulties that arise when you
think about the complete

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.400
rejection of the Enlightenment
project.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.534
For instance,
I think a very dramatic example

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:34.077
that fixes our intuitions very
quickly is the example that I

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:37.930
know some of you discussed which
is,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.420
that in the 1950s in the United
States there was no such thing

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.040
as marital rape.
 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
You can remember this from our
discussion of Mill.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.835
The wife was the chattel of the
husband and her legal identity

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:56.530
was suspended for the course of
the marriage.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.670
Not only could a husband not be
prosecuted for raping his wife,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.408
he could not be prosecuted for
assault.

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:08.162
He could not be prosecuted for
doing all kinds of things to her

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:12.379
that if he did it to some
unrelated person on the street

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:15.140
would land him in jail or worse.
 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.337
Now if you think about
MacIntyre's discussion of

00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:23.203
practices,
in the 1950s this was an

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:28.049
accepted norm of the prevailing
practice,

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.137
and the argument that this
should be seen as unjust or

00:01:32.137 --> 00:01:36.763
unacceptable wouldn't get any
purchase from an ethic that was

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:41.700
based on the idea that we must
accept inherited traditions,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.730
and norms, and practices.
 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:51.769
And so the one important
takeaway point from that is,

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:55.666
however difficult the
Enlightenment ideas of

00:01:55.666 --> 00:02:01.284
individual rights and trying to
make objective statements about

00:02:01.284 --> 00:02:06.450
what goes on within systems of
human association is,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.060
however difficult that
Enlightenment project is,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.477
giving up on it completely
presents even more insuperable

00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:17.020
problems,
because very few people are

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.175
really going to want to go all
the way with abandoning the idea

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:25.199
that the individual should be
subordinated to community norms

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.264
and practices,
and abandoning the notion that

00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:34.985
we can appeal only to tradition
in thinking about whether or not

00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:39.800
traditions as we've inherited
them are acceptable.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.652
And so, enter democracy,
the last section of the course

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:49.955
in which we're going to talk
about a tradition which I think

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:55.437
does a better job than any that
we have considered hitherto in

00:02:55.437 --> 00:03:00.919
delivering on the promise of the
mature Enlightenment,

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:06.161
the promise to recognize
individual rights as the most

00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:12.681
important normative ideal,
and to base politics on some

00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:19.465
commitment to objective
knowledge about human society

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:26.551
that goes beyond the beliefs,
commitments and practices of

00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:32.714
whoever happens to be around and
whatever values they happen to

00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:33.508
have.
 

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:37.810
Now one thing about democracy
that distinguishes it from all

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.818
of the traditions we've
considered thus far is that it's

00:03:41.818 --> 00:03:45.610
a tradition that was made famous
by its critics.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.050
If you think about the ones
we've considered thus far;

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.788
the social contract was made
famous by Hobbes and Locke.

00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:58.550
Utilitarianism was made famous
by Bentham.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.210
Marxism obviously made famous
by Marx.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.014
These were all ways of looking
at the world that had their

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:11.599
champions,
and it was the champions that

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.434
made the case for why we should
behave in accordance with their

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:17.370
dictates.
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.697
And with the anti-Enlightenment
as well, it was Burke as the big

00:04:21.697 --> 00:04:24.240
champion of the
anti-Enlightenment.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.586
And then we looked at some
modern anti-Enlightenment

00:04:27.586 --> 00:04:28.310
thinkers.
 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:36.990
Democracy was made famous by
its critics.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.540
Who do you think this is?
 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.399
Any guesses?
 

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:46.759
Who's that on the left,
that gent on the left?

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:47.610
Nobody know?
 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.098
Nobody want to guess?
 

00:04:49.098 --> 00:04:50.019
Who's that?
 

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:51.279
Student:  Aristotle?
 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.680
Prof: Close. Who?
 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.970
Student:  Plato.
 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.170
Prof: Okay,
who's the gent on the right?

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.581
Anyone?
 

00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:03.699
First one to get it gets a free
book.

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:04.170
Yeah?
 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.269
Student:  Tocqueville?
 

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:05.610
Prof: You got it.
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.959
Come and see me later you'll
get your free book.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:16.790
These are both people who were
not champions of democracy.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:26.134
They were worried about the
potential that democracy has for

00:05:26.134 --> 00:05:27.720
tyranny.
 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.110
Let's listen to Plato.
 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.930
I don't know if you can read
that, but I'll read it to you.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.209
And don't try and write it down.
 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:38.079
I will put it up on the server.
 

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:43.166
Plato has two very famous
analogies in The Republic

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:47.720
which sum up his appalling
disdain for democracy.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.675
He says, "Imagine then a
fleet or a ship in which there

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:58.050
is a captain who is taller and
stronger than any of the crew,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.060
but he is a little deaf and has
a similar infirmity in sight,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.430
and his knowledge of navigation
is not much better (kind of

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.290
dopey old captain).
 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.093
The sailors are quarrelling
with one another about the

00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:13.175
steering--
everyone is of opinion that he

00:06:13.175 --> 00:06:16.767
has a right to steer,
though he has never learned the

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:19.983
art of navigation and cannot
tell who taught him or when he

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.745
learned,
and will further assert that it

00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:26.247
cannot be taught,
and they are ready to cut in

00:06:26.247 --> 00:06:29.180
pieces anyone who says the
contrary.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.709
They throng about the captain,
begging and praying him to

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:36.074
commit the helm to them;
and if at any time they do not

00:06:36.074 --> 00:06:38.307
prevail,
but others are preferred to

00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:41.560
them, they kill the others or
throw them overboard,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.928
and having first chained up the
noble captain's senses with

00:06:44.928 --> 00:06:49.154
drink or some narcotic drug,
they mutiny and take possession

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:52.519
of the ship and make free with
the stores;

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:56.206
thus, eating and drinking,
they proceed on their voyage in

00:06:56.206 --> 00:06:58.990
such manner as might be expected
of them.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.240
Him who is their partisan and
cleverly aids them in their plot

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.490
for getting the ship out of the
captain's hands into their own

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.036
whether by force or persuasion,
they compliment with the name

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:14.206
of sailor,
pilot, able seaman,

00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:16.579
and abuse the other sort of
man,

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:21.120
whom they call a
good-for-nothing;

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.142
but that the true pilot must
pay attention to the year and

00:07:26.142 --> 00:07:29.579
seasons and sky and stars and
winds,

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:31.790
and whatever else belongs to
his art,

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.247
if he intends to be really
qualified for the command of a

00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:36.050
ship."
 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.553
"Now in vessels which are
in a state of mutiny and by

00:07:41.553 --> 00:07:46.574
sailors who are mutineers,
how will the true pilot be

00:07:46.574 --> 00:07:47.829
regarded?
 

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:52.199
Will he not be called by them a
prater, a star-gazer,

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.470
a good-for-nothing?"
 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.399
And then Plato's other famous
analogy,

00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:01.687
which looks at the masses
rather than how they would

00:08:01.687 --> 00:08:04.800
manipulate the government he
says,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.584
" Suppose a man was in
charge of a large and powerful

00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:11.446
animal,
and made a study of its moods

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:14.482
and wants;
he would learn when to approach

00:08:14.482 --> 00:08:17.615
and handle it,
when and why it was especially

00:08:17.615 --> 00:08:20.689
savage or gentle,
what the different noises it

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:25.399
made meant,
and what tone of voice to use

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:28.470
to soothe or annoy it.
 

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.101
All this he might learn by long
experience an familiarity,

00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:37.650
and then call it a science,
and reduce it to a system and

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.519
set up to teach it.
 

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:43.693
But he would not really know
which of the creature's tastes

00:08:43.693 --> 00:08:47.292
and desires was admirable or
shameful, good or bad,

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:51.221
right or wrong;
he would simply use the terms

00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:56.346
on the basis of its reactions,
calling what pleased it good

00:08:56.346 --> 00:08:58.908
what annoyed it bad."
 

00:08:58.908 --> 00:09:03.038
So Plato didn't have much
regard for democracy.

00:09:03.038 --> 00:09:08.279
Not surprisingly,
because in 399 BC the democracy

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:14.938
in Athens had executed his hero
and teacher Socrates precisely

00:09:14.938 --> 00:09:21.162
for pointing out the sorts of
lack of knowledge that he is

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:27.057
alluding to here both in the
ship's captain analogy and

00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:33.606
playing to the mob sentiments
that he's alluding to with this

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:39.503
analogy of the people in a
democratic system as being a

00:09:39.503 --> 00:09:42.558
powerful animal.
 

00:09:42.558 --> 00:09:47.087
And so Plato was very
unimpressed with democracy as a

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.440
potential system of rule.
 

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.490
He thought it would quickly
collapse into tyranny.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.676
The phrase "the tyranny of
the majority,"

00:09:57.676 --> 00:10:00.990
though, was made popular by
Alexis de Tocqueville.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.498
You've already run into this
when we talked about Mill's harm

00:10:05.498 --> 00:10:06.399
principle.
 

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:09.743
Tocqueville was a
nineteenth-century French

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:14.120
aristocrat who went to America
to try and understand how

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.418
American democracy worked
because it seemed to him less

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:22.876
destructive of freedom and
individual liberties than what

00:10:22.876 --> 00:10:26.298
was coming down the pike in
Europe.

00:10:26.298 --> 00:10:30.198
He thought the French
aristocracy and the French

00:10:30.198 --> 00:10:34.429
monarchy was way too
shortsighted in not seeing that

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:38.909
they had to understand the
egalitarian trends of modern

00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:43.057
history and to create
institutions that could lasso

00:10:43.057 --> 00:10:45.496
them,
and control them,

00:10:45.496 --> 00:10:47.149
and domesticate them.
 

00:10:47.149 --> 00:10:51.658
So people think of Tocqueville
often as a great defender of

00:10:51.658 --> 00:10:54.798
democracy,
and in a certain sense he was,

00:10:54.798 --> 00:10:57.639
but he was also a critic of
democracy,

00:10:57.639 --> 00:11:00.980
and I'll go into that in a
little bit more detail shortly,

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.437
but his main reason for
thinking that American democracy

00:11:06.437 --> 00:11:11.895
was a relatively good system was
its propensity to limit

00:11:11.895 --> 00:11:17.552
egalitarian impulses that he
thought were breaking out all

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.340
over Europe.
 

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:25.568
And so Tocqueville's summation
of his fear of the tyranny of

00:11:25.568 --> 00:11:31.058
the majority comes in
Democracy in America.

00:11:31.058 --> 00:11:36.028
He says, "When I see that
the right and the means of

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:41.440
absolute command are conferred
on a people or upon a king,

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.038
upon an aristocracy or a
democracy,

00:11:42.038 --> 00:11:47.490
a monarchy or a republic,
I recognize the germ of

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.970
tyranny,
and I journey onward to a land

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.200
of more hopeful institutions.
 

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.106
"In my opinion the main
evil of the present democratic

00:11:57.106 --> 00:12:00.610
institutions of the United
States does not arise,

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.019
as is often asserted in Europe,
from their weakness,

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:08.028
but from their overpowering
strength;

00:12:08.028 --> 00:12:12.390
and I am not so much alarmed at
the excessive liberty which

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.203
reigns in that country as at the
very inadequate securities which

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.158
exist against tyranny.
 

00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:25.429
"When an individual or a
party is wronged in the United

00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:30.000
States, to whom can he apply for
redress?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.277
If to public opinion,
public opinion constitutes the

00:12:34.277 --> 00:12:36.721
majority;
if to the legislature,

00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:40.250
it represents the majority,
and implicitly obeys its

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.037
injunctions;
if to the executive power,

00:12:43.037 --> 00:12:46.597
it is appointed by the
majority, and remains a passive

00:12:46.597 --> 00:12:50.038
tool in its hands;
the public troops consist of

00:12:50.038 --> 00:12:53.162
the majority under arms;
the jury is the majority

00:12:53.162 --> 00:12:55.950
invested with the right of
hearing judicial cases;

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.850
and in certain States even the
judges are elected by the

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:01.830
majority.
 

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.529
However iniquitous or absurd
the evil of which you complain

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:11.149
may be, you must submit to it as
well as you can."

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:15.384
So democracy brings with it
this problem of the tyranny of

00:13:15.384 --> 00:13:18.976
the majority and it was,
after all, we saw earlier in

00:13:18.976 --> 00:13:22.000
this course,
against that that John Stuart

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.538
Mill erected his harm principle.
 

00:13:24.538 --> 00:13:30.129
He too had this great fear of
tyranny of the majority.

00:13:30.129 --> 00:13:35.702
And so, as I said,
democracy was made famous first

00:13:35.702 --> 00:13:39.774
by its critics,
and they point out that it has

00:13:39.774 --> 00:13:43.687
this propensity to pander to
mass opinion without regard to

00:13:43.687 --> 00:13:48.402
whether it's true or false,
and to ride roughshod over the

00:13:48.402 --> 00:13:53.119
individual rights,
again, without regard to

00:13:53.119 --> 00:13:58.440
whether this produces domination
or worse.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.701
So that being the case,
it seems like prima facie not

00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:09.572
very encouraging to think that
democracy can deliver on the

00:14:09.572 --> 00:14:15.037
Enlightenment where we're
talking about politics that's

00:14:15.037 --> 00:14:21.918
based on science and politics
that respects individual rights.

00:14:21.918 --> 00:14:29.038
And so you might,
given reading Mill as you have,

00:14:29.038 --> 00:14:32.370
given what the little bit of
Plato and Rousseau that I've

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.613
just shown to you,
and your own thinking about

00:14:36.613 --> 00:14:41.158
politics as you confront it day
to day,

00:14:41.158 --> 00:14:47.095
you might well be skeptical of
the proposition that democracy

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:53.029
is going to deliver very well on
the mature Enlightenment.

00:14:53.029 --> 00:14:56.933
And so just how that might be
the case is what's going to

00:14:56.933 --> 00:15:00.769
concern us for this and then the
next three lectures.

00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:04.460
 
 

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.447
And we're going to start our
consideration of democracy with

00:15:09.447 --> 00:15:12.070
The Federalist Papers.
 

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.479
The Federalist Papers
are probably,

00:15:16.479 --> 00:15:21.427
along with Rawls,
the two most important pieces

00:15:21.427 --> 00:15:27.019
of political theory ever to come
out of America.

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:33.942
They were a series of articles
published in the newspapers of

00:15:33.942 --> 00:15:38.759
New York State,
as I'm sure most of you know,

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:44.048
in order to try and help get
the Constitution ratified.

00:15:44.048 --> 00:15:48.168
Although authored by these
three gentlemen,

00:15:48.168 --> 00:15:52.551
James Madison,
Alexander Hamilton and John

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:56.350
Jay,
they were signed with the

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:01.547
pseudonym Publius,
which was short for Publius

00:16:01.547 --> 00:16:07.471
Valerius Publicola who was
reputed to be the consul who had

00:16:07.471 --> 00:16:11.658
restored the Roman Republic in
509 BC;

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:15.883
whether he in fact did is a
matter that's debated by

00:16:15.883 --> 00:16:16.960
historians.
 

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.952
The Constitution,
by the time they wrote these

00:16:22.952 --> 00:16:27.879
the vast majority of these
papers,

00:16:27.879 --> 00:16:31.200
these letters to the people of
New York,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.426
had already been approved by
the majority of the thirteen

00:16:36.426 --> 00:16:42.394
states,
but few people believed that it

00:16:42.394 --> 00:16:50.190
would survive if it wasn't
adopted in New York.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:55.248
The Confederate Constitution
had required unanimity for the

00:16:55.248 --> 00:17:00.405
adoption of the Constitution,
but in the actual Constitution

00:17:00.405 --> 00:17:03.917
itself they had said,
"Well, nine out of the

00:17:03.917 --> 00:17:06.180
thirteen states will be
enough,"

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.637
but nobody really thought it
could survive if it was not

00:17:09.637 --> 00:17:11.210
adopted in New York.
 

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:20.048
And so the Federalists took
upon themselves the task,

00:17:20.048 --> 00:17:26.039
Hamilton, Madison and Jay,
of persuading the people of New

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:32.661
York to support the adoption of
The Constitution and indeed they

00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:36.548
were successful in that
endeavor.

00:17:36.548 --> 00:17:41.834
But they had the fear of this
problem of majority tyranny that

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:46.078
I've already alluded to with
respect to Plato,

00:17:46.078 --> 00:17:50.894
and Mill, and Tocqueville,
front and center in their

00:17:50.894 --> 00:17:52.500
considerations.
 

00:17:52.500 --> 00:18:00.392
And you shouldn't be surprised
that they would worry about

00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:04.327
that,
because if you imagine yourself

00:18:04.327 --> 00:18:09.800
back into the eighteenth century
thinking about democracy the

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.752
ancient ideal of democracy,
the ancient Athenian ideal of

00:18:14.752 --> 00:18:19.294
democracy had basically been a
notion of ruling and being ruled

00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:20.098
in turn.
 

00:18:20.098 --> 00:18:28.038
So if you have an academic
department, let's say.

00:18:28.038 --> 00:18:31.848
Let's set aside the issue of
untenured faculty.

00:18:31.848 --> 00:18:34.930
Just imagine a department of
tenured faculty.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.700
We have a circulating chair.
 

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.058
Somebody's chair for three
years, then somebody else,

00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:45.791
then somebody else,
that's the notion of ruling and

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.564
being ruled in turn,
and the reason you can do that

00:18:49.564 --> 00:18:53.838
is that everybody basically has
the same interest.

00:18:53.838 --> 00:18:57.984
You don't have to worry about
monitoring or controlling the

00:18:57.984 --> 00:19:01.368
current ruler,
because basically they have the

00:19:01.368 --> 00:19:04.215
same interest as you do,
and they're not,

00:19:04.215 --> 00:19:08.000
therefore, going to do anything
with the collective that you

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.538
wouldn't do yourself.
 

00:19:09.538 --> 00:19:13.503
So that's the ancient ideal of
democracy as ruling and being

00:19:13.503 --> 00:19:14.578
ruled in turn.
 

00:19:14.578 --> 00:19:17.952
It obviously,
in the case of Ancient Greece

00:19:17.952 --> 00:19:21.316
it excluded women,
it excluded slaves,

00:19:21.316 --> 00:19:26.171
so it was a certain truncated
conception of a democratic

00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:31.818
community about which people
have discoursed at great length.

00:19:31.818 --> 00:19:36.405
But given that the model was
the idea that you could have

00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:41.237
ruling and being ruled in turn
without loss because everyone

00:19:41.237 --> 00:19:45.423
was assumed,
basically, to have the same

00:19:45.423 --> 00:19:46.460
interest.
 

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.195
Now as soon as you get a
diversity of interests that

00:19:52.195 --> 00:19:58.830
mechanism of government goes off
the table as a way of doing

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:05.130
things because then you might
have subgroups who see that

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.634
they--
let's suppose you introduce

00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:10.308
non-tenured faculty.
 

00:20:10.308 --> 00:20:13.429
They're going to have a very
different interest than the

00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:14.450
tenured faculty.
 

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.961
And so the idea of ruling and
being ruled in turn wouldn't

00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:20.150
work anymore.
 

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.301
Once you have a serious
division of interest within the

00:20:25.301 --> 00:20:28.259
polity you have this problem.
 

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:32.075
And this is the problem Madison
articulates in Federalist No.

00:20:32.075 --> 00:20:34.680
10 when he says,
"By a faction,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.171
I understand a number of
citizens, whether amounting to a

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:42.298
majority or a minority of the
whole,

00:20:42.298 --> 00:20:46.900
who are united and actuated by
some common impulse of passion,

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.609
or of interest,
adverse to the rights of other

00:20:50.609 --> 00:20:53.498
citizens,
or to the permanent and

00:20:53.498 --> 00:20:57.130
aggregate interests of the
community."

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:03.599
So once you have factions you
have this problem.

00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:07.368
 
 

00:21:07.368 --> 00:21:13.048
If you're the majority faction
it doesn't matter to you,

00:21:13.048 --> 00:21:18.267
but it does if you're the
minority faction because things

00:21:18.267 --> 00:21:22.180
are going to happen that you
don't like.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.066
So the first thing Madison says
to himself is,

00:21:25.066 --> 00:21:28.210
"Well, could we get rid of
factions?"

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.635
and if you read Federalist
No.

00:21:30.635 --> 00:21:35.109
10 carefully you'll see
that he thinks that the costs of

00:21:35.109 --> 00:21:39.810
doing that would be so great in
terms of lost human freedom and

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.210
the kind of repression you would
have to engage in,

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.843
it would look like the French
Revolution or the Russian

00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:52.403
Revolution which,
of course, he didn't know

00:21:52.403 --> 00:21:57.048
about, but which he didn't know
about either of those things,

00:21:57.048 --> 00:22:03.137
but he wouldn't have been
surprised by them when he wrote

00:22:03.137 --> 00:22:03.900
this.
 

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.368
So you can't get rid of
factions.

00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:10.443
"The causes of factions
can't be removed,

00:22:10.443 --> 00:22:14.269
and therefore you have to look
at their effects."

00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:17.488
He says, "The latent
causes of faction are thus sown

00:22:17.488 --> 00:22:20.372
in the nature of man;
and we see them everywhere

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:23.915
brought into different degrees
of activity, according to the

00:22:23.915 --> 00:22:26.558
different circumstances of civil
society.

00:22:26.558 --> 00:22:30.984
So strong is this propensity of
mankind to fall into mutual

00:22:30.984 --> 00:22:33.907
animosities,
that where no substantial

00:22:33.907 --> 00:22:38.156
occasion presents itself,
the most frivolous and fanciful

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:41.759
distinctions have been
sufficient to kindle their

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:46.490
unfriendly passions and excite
their most violent conflicts.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.717
But the most common and durable
source of factions has been the

00:22:51.717 --> 00:22:55.680
various and unequal distribution
of property.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.444
Those who hold and those who
are without property have ever

00:23:00.444 --> 00:23:03.650
formed distinct interests in
society.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.743
Those who are creditors,
and those who are debtors,

00:23:06.743 --> 00:23:08.910
fall under a like
discrimination.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.890
A landed interest,
a manufacturing interest,

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.460
a mercantile interest,
a moneyed interest,

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.121
with many lesser interests,
grow up of necessity in

00:23:17.121 --> 00:23:20.571
civilized nations,
and divide them into different

00:23:20.571 --> 00:23:23.157
classes,
actuated by different

00:23:23.157 --> 00:23:25.200
sentiments and views.
 

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.375
The regulation of these various
and interfering interests forms

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:34.048
the principal task of modern
legislation,

00:23:34.048 --> 00:23:37.440
and involves the spirit of
party and faction in the

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.085
necessary and ordinary
operations of the

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.509
government."
 

00:23:41.509 --> 00:23:47.934
Managing factions so that they
don't destroy the common

00:23:47.934 --> 00:23:53.289
interest is the basic business
of politics.

00:23:53.289 --> 00:23:59.640
Now how do you do that?
 

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:10.200
Well, how do you manage the
effects of faction?

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.847
He goes on and he says,
" The smaller the society,

00:24:13.847 --> 00:24:17.901
the fewer probably will be the
distinct parties and interests

00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:20.621
composing it;
the fewer the distinct parties

00:24:20.621 --> 00:24:22.715
and interests,
the more frequently will a

00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:24.759
majority be found of the same
party;

00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:27.555
and the smaller the number of
individuals composing a

00:24:27.555 --> 00:24:30.452
majority,
and the smaller the compass

00:24:30.452 --> 00:24:35.901
within which they are placed,
the more easily will they

00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:41.279
concert and execute their plans
of oppression.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.650
Extend the sphere,
and you take in a greater

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.578
variety of parties and
interests;

00:24:45.578 --> 00:24:49.455
you make it less probable that
a majority of the whole will

00:24:49.455 --> 00:24:53.598
have a common motive to invade
the rights of other citizens;

00:24:53.598 --> 00:24:57.650
or if such a common motive
exists, it will be more

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:02.609
difficult for all who feel it to
discover their own strength,

00:25:02.609 --> 00:25:06.000
and to act in unison with each
other.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.630
Besides other impediments,
it may be remarked that,

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.896
where there is a consciousness
of unjust or dishonorable

00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:15.818
purposes,
communication is always checked

00:25:15.818 --> 00:25:20.025
by distrust in proportion to the
number whose concurrence is

00:25:20.025 --> 00:25:21.380
necessary."
 

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.210
"Hence,
it clearly appears,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.180
that the same advantage which a
republic has over a democracy,

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.470
in controlling the effects of
faction,

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.288
is enjoyed by a large over a
small republic--

00:25:33.288 --> 00:25:41.078
is enjoyed by the Union over
the States composing it.

00:25:41.078 --> 00:25:45.842
" I will talk in a little
while about what advantages

00:25:45.842 --> 00:25:50.019
Madison thinks a republic has
over a democracy,

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:53.856
but right now I want to focus
on this other point which is

00:25:53.856 --> 00:25:58.098
that a large republic has an
advantage over a small republic.

00:25:58.098 --> 00:26:02.778
A society that has no factions
at all presents no problems for

00:26:02.778 --> 00:26:06.690
democratic theory as we have
already talked about in

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:11.290
connection with the stylized
idea of ancient Greece as one in

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.818
which everybody has the same
interests,

00:26:14.818 --> 00:26:22.318
and you can have ruling and
being ruled in turn.

00:26:22.318 --> 00:26:26.880
What Madison is most afraid of
is a single faction,

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.953
a majority faction,
because if you have a society

00:26:31.953 --> 00:26:38.509
in which there's a majority that
agrees all the time or most of

00:26:38.509 --> 00:26:42.803
the time,
the problem is what about these

00:26:42.803 --> 00:26:43.529
people?
 

00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:47.910
They're going to be on the
losing end.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.108
So if you have a society in
which race,

00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:56.602
and class, and religion all
tend to fall along the same

00:26:56.602 --> 00:27:04.297
division these people are either
going to have to knuckle down to

00:27:04.297 --> 00:27:10.670
tyranny or they're going to
reach for their guns.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.700
They'll overthrow the system if
they can;

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.094
and if they cannot,
they might as well become

00:27:16.094 --> 00:27:17.019
criminals.
 

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:22.602
They're not going to have an
incentive to participate in the

00:27:22.602 --> 00:27:24.400
democratic order.
 

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:31.538
And so from Madison's point of
view this is the ideal society.

00:27:31.538 --> 00:27:35.577
We think modern Poland
ninety-nine percent Catholic or

00:27:35.577 --> 00:27:38.243
something like that,
but even there,

00:27:38.243 --> 00:27:40.529
there are other divisions.
 

00:27:40.529 --> 00:27:42.650
So even there it doesn't work.
 

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:47.191
But if you're going to have
factions the worst thing to have

00:27:47.191 --> 00:27:49.269
is one or a small number.
 

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:54.775
What you really want is lots of
factions, crosscutting cleavages

00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:59.318
as we talk about them in modern
political science.

00:27:59.318 --> 00:28:06.818
The notion here is if you're in
a majority on one question,

00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:11.430
but you know you might be in a
different majority or in the

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:16.278
minority on the next question
then you have both the reason to

00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:20.968
temper your own behavior when
you're in the majority and not

00:28:20.968 --> 00:28:25.880
tyrannize over the minority,
and if you're in the minority

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.920
you have reasons to accept your
loss this time around.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.307
As people always say,
when their team loses the World

00:28:34.307 --> 00:28:39.202
Series, "There's always
next year, there's always next

00:28:39.202 --> 00:28:40.470
time."
 

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.615
So next time you might be part
of some different coalition and

00:28:45.615 --> 00:28:48.230
you might be able to prevail.
 

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:56.096
So the best we could have would
be a world with no factions as

00:28:56.096 --> 00:28:58.780
all,
but that's unrealistic in

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.913
modern times,
particularly once you have an

00:29:01.913 --> 00:29:06.959
economic division of labor,
class divisions,

00:29:06.959 --> 00:29:16.269
as Tocqueville would point out
forty years later.

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:20.660
And so then what you need is
lots of factions,

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:26.417
and that's why Madison argued
you need a big republic because

00:29:26.417 --> 00:29:31.021
the larger the republic,
the more likely it is that

00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:35.279
you're going to have multiple
crosscutting cleavages,

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:39.884
and then the system--we
sometimes define democracy as

00:29:39.884 --> 00:29:43.779
institutionalized uncertainty of
outcomes.

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:45.480
You don't know.
 

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.700
You don't know what the
majority's going to decide.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:30:01.124
We don't know if--let's suppose
President Obama nominates

00:30:01.124 --> 00:30:07.038
Justice Wood for the Court.
 

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:10.772
We don't know what the outcome
will be so everybody will

00:30:10.772 --> 00:30:15.048
participate and lobby and so on
to try and affect the result.

00:30:15.048 --> 00:30:19.028
People will talk about
coalitions.

00:30:19.028 --> 00:30:23.323
A more dramatic case,
I think, when George Bush

00:30:23.323 --> 00:30:28.548
Senior nominated Clarence Thomas
to the Supreme Court.

00:30:28.548 --> 00:30:32.680
It split the African American
community right down the middle

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.810
because there were people who
were largely democrats who also

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.460
wanted an African American
justice on the court,

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:46.200
a good example of crosscutting
bases of political affiliation.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.597
And so the Madisonian idea is
that that's actually a good

00:30:51.597 --> 00:30:52.368
thing.
 

00:30:52.368 --> 00:30:56.252
This institutionalized
uncertainty of outcomes prevents

00:30:56.252 --> 00:31:00.640
the tyrannizing of some groups
over others and gives everybody

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.380
an incentive to remain committed
to the process.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.440
And that is what would
subsequently become called the

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.124
pluralist theory of democracy
associated most famously in the

00:31:13.124 --> 00:31:17.886
twentieth century with Robert
Dahl who was on the Yale faculty

00:31:17.886 --> 00:31:20.230
for decades and decades.
 

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.443
And he's still--he's about to
turn, actually,

00:31:23.443 --> 00:31:27.170
95 years old this year and he
lives in New Haven.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:32.084
He's probably the most famous
democratic theorist of the

00:31:32.084 --> 00:31:35.568
second half of the twentieth
century.

00:31:35.568 --> 00:31:39.297
The pluralist theory of
democracy builds on this

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:43.580
Madisonian idea that what you
want is institutionalized

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:48.181
uncertainty of outcomes that is
a byproduct of crosscutting

00:31:48.181 --> 00:31:52.288
cleavages,
multiple crosscutting cleavages.

00:31:52.288 --> 00:31:58.338
So that present winners have
reason to limit the amount in

00:31:58.338 --> 00:32:02.160
which they tyrannize over
losers,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.049
and present losers have
incentives to remain committed

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:08.400
to the process for the future.
 

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.160
There's always next year.
 

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.900
You want people to believe that
in order to keep them committed.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.038
 
 

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:25.740
But that wasn't enough for
Madison.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:30.791
That was the basis of his
argument for an extended union,

00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:33.950
but it wasn't enough for
Madison.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:39.250
He was worried,
just as Tocqueville articulated

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:45.125
it in the nineteenth century,
that the institutional

00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:49.618
structure could facilitate
tyranny.

00:32:49.618 --> 00:32:52.566
He says, "But the great
security against a gradual

00:32:52.566 --> 00:32:55.950
concentration of the several
powers in the same department,

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:01.846
consists in giving to those who
administer each department the

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:07.645
necessary constitutional means
and personal motives to resist

00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:10.740
encroachments of the others.
 

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.511
The provision for defense must
in this, as in all other cases,

00:33:15.511 --> 00:33:19.190
be made commensurate to the
danger of attack.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:23.210
Ambition must be made to
counteract ambition."

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.848
Maybe the most famous line
Madison ever wrote.

00:33:26.848 --> 00:33:30.910
Ambition must be made to
counteract ambition.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:34.227
"The interest of the man
must be connected with the

00:33:34.227 --> 00:33:36.460
constitutional rights of the
place.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:41.656
It may be a reflection on human
nature, that such devices should

00:33:41.656 --> 00:33:46.358
be necessary to control the
abuses of government."

00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:52.210
Another famous line:
"If men were angels,

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:56.759
no government would be
necessary.

00:33:56.759 --> 00:34:00.450
If angels were to govern men,
neither external nor internal

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.250
controls on government would be
necessary.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:08.106
In framing a government which
is to be administered by men

00:34:08.106 --> 00:34:10.905
over men,
the great difficulty lies in

00:34:10.905 --> 00:34:14.458
this: you must first enable the
government to control the

00:34:14.458 --> 00:34:17.842
governed;
and in the next place oblige it

00:34:17.842 --> 00:34:19.449
to control itself.
 

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:23.527
A dependence on the people is,
no doubt, the primary control

00:34:23.527 --> 00:34:27.539
on the government;
but experience has taught

00:34:27.539 --> 00:34:33.219
mankind the necessity of
auxiliary precautions."

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:45.413
So your basic guarantor is the
crosscutting cleavages among the

00:34:45.413 --> 00:34:49.634
people,
an extended republic,

00:34:49.634 --> 00:34:55.536
but that's not enough because--
and this is really a view that

00:34:55.536 --> 00:35:00.389
most famously associated with
the nineteenth-century liberal

00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:04.010
British thinker Lord Acton when
he said,

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.014
"Power corrupts,
and absolute power corrupts

00:35:08.014 --> 00:35:09.599
absolutely."
 

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:14.130
The notion is that you really
have to divide up power.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.050
You have to have an
institutional scheme--

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:22.092
this is his auxiliary
precautions--an institutional

00:35:22.092 --> 00:35:27.539
scheme which causes people in
the different branches of

00:35:27.539 --> 00:35:31.170
government to check one another.
 

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:37.286
And so we get what Madison
called a non-tyrannical republic

00:35:37.286 --> 00:35:40.030
rather than a democracy.
 

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.552
And in that sense Madison is a
critic of democracy just like

00:35:45.552 --> 00:35:48.829
Tocqueville, and just like
Plato.

00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:53.429
They want to say that pure
democracy leads to tyranny and

00:35:53.429 --> 00:35:58.275
we have to check it with an
institutional scheme that limits

00:35:58.275 --> 00:36:00.000
what can be done.
 

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.360
And so the American system so
called checks and balances,

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.139
which you all learned about in
high school civics courses,

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:15.280
structures the constitutional
system that they created.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.431
This is something that you can
tell from the passage from

00:36:19.431 --> 00:36:23.585
Tocqueville that I read you that
Tocqueville didn't fully

00:36:23.585 --> 00:36:28.257
understand or appreciate because
he thought that every branch of

00:36:28.257 --> 00:36:32.929
the government was ultimately
controlled by the majority.

00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:36.619
And the designers of The
Constitution intended,

00:36:36.619 --> 00:36:42.110
rather, to have them at least
controlled in different ways by

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:46.501
majority opinion,
but more importantly to set up

00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:50.768
a scheme in which they would
control one another.

00:36:50.768 --> 00:36:57.469
Ambition would be made to
counteract ambition.

00:36:57.469 --> 00:37:02.425
And so we've all been reading
in the newspapers this weekend

00:37:02.425 --> 00:37:07.380
at the moment of the retirement
of Justice John Paul Stevens

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.878
that he was one of the people,
for instance,

00:37:11.878 --> 00:37:18.715
who checked the expansion of
executive power after 9/11 in

00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:26.391
the Hamdan case by saying it was
unconstitutional to use military

00:37:26.391 --> 00:37:32.510
tribunals to try the Guantanamo
Bay detainees.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.771
From the point of view of
Madison the specific issue is

00:37:36.771 --> 00:37:41.126
not what's important here,
but rather that what we saw

00:37:41.126 --> 00:37:45.340
after 9/11 was this big
expansion of executive power,

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:52.719
and then you see an assertion
of power by a different branch,

00:37:52.719 --> 00:37:57.061
say to the executive, "No,
you can't do that,"

00:37:57.061 --> 00:38:02.106
and so a limiting of executive
power in this case by the

00:38:02.106 --> 00:38:03.849
judicial branch.
 

00:38:03.849 --> 00:38:07.338
And so what you have in the
American scheme,

00:38:07.338 --> 00:38:11.800
the American constitutional
scheme, is a large number of

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.099
veto points.
 

00:38:13.099 --> 00:38:17.630
First of all we have The Bill
of Rights.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:21.099
The Bill of Rights was enacted
after The Constitution,

00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:27.253
but only when undertakings had
been made that it would be

00:38:27.253 --> 00:38:32.090
enacted in most of the state
legislatures.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:36.139
So it was basically,
even though it came afterwards,

00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:39.947
there was an informal agreement
by the time The Constitution was

00:38:39.947 --> 00:38:42.909
adopted that there would be a
Bill of Rights ,

00:38:42.909 --> 00:38:45.960
what became the first ten
amendments,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.510
that would limit the power of
the central government.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.510
And so we have a Bill of Rights.
 

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:59.289
Then we have supermajority
requirements most obviously to

00:38:59.289 --> 00:39:03.625
change the Constitution,
huge supermajority

00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:05.380
requirements.
 

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.530
To amend the Constitution it's
very difficult.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:13.264
You need two-thirds in both
Houses of Congress and then

00:39:13.264 --> 00:39:15.409
three-quarters of the states.
 

00:39:15.409 --> 00:39:18.815
Some of your parents were
around at the last serious

00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:21.219
effort to amend the
constitution,

00:39:21.219 --> 00:39:23.920
namely the ERA,
the Equal Rights Amendment,

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.650
which failed to pass that
threshold,

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:30.389
very hard.
 

00:39:30.389 --> 00:39:33.690
But then we have other
supermajority requirements,

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:37.460
the filibuster rule in the
Senate which we may see come

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:41.300
into play in the Supreme Court
confirmation hearings.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:45.326
That's not in the Constitution,
but it's a supermajority

00:39:45.326 --> 00:39:49.059
requirement, nonetheless,
that we've embedded in our

00:39:49.059 --> 00:39:50.889
institutional scheme.
 

00:39:50.889 --> 00:40:00.315
Anytime you add supermajority
requirements you make it harder

00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:07.230
for the current majority to work
its will.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:10.940
Separation of powers,
already alluded to:

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:16.230
the Court versus the executive,
the legislature versus the

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.530
executive.
 

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:23.164
The notion that ambition of
players in one branch will

00:40:23.164 --> 00:40:29.440
counteract the ambition of
players in a different branch.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.753
Greatly debated subject,
how effective can the branches

00:40:34.753 --> 00:40:38.000
really be to check one another?
 

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.869
After all, the Court does not
have an army at its disposal.

00:40:44.869 --> 00:40:51.510
You guys are young enough to
remember the 2000 election when

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:58.038
we had a knife-edge result and
partisans on both sides were

00:40:58.038 --> 00:41:03.438
saying their candidate won,
and it was being litigated in

00:41:03.438 --> 00:41:07.222
various ways through the state
courts in Florida and we didn't

00:41:07.222 --> 00:41:08.650
have a clear result.
 

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:13.594
And finally the Supreme Court
in Bush v.

00:41:13.594 --> 00:41:19.552
Gore ruled in a very
controversial decision that

00:41:19.552 --> 00:41:27.403
President Bush was the winner,
or then-candidate Bush was the

00:41:27.403 --> 00:41:32.639
winner and Vice President Gore
was the loser.

00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:36.293
And Gore stood up on national
television and he said,

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:38.260
"I accept the result.
 

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.869
I don't agree with the result,
but I accept the result."

00:41:43.869 --> 00:41:47.789
He didn't have to.
 

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:50.713
You could imagine in many
countries at that point,

00:41:50.713 --> 00:41:54.056
the Clinton Administration
would have sent the tanks down

00:41:54.056 --> 00:41:55.489
Pennsylvania Avenue.
 

00:41:55.489 --> 00:41:57.889
What would the Court have been
able to do?

00:41:57.889 --> 00:42:00.639
Nothing.
 

00:42:00.639 --> 00:42:06.675
It's far from obvious in Iraq
that the loser of the election

00:42:06.675 --> 00:42:09.949
is going to accept the result.
 

00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:12.530
So there's great debate.
 

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:19.096
Madison makes heavy weather in
The Federalist Papers of

00:42:19.096 --> 00:42:25.231
the proposition that just
writing something on a parchment

00:42:25.231 --> 00:42:31.367
doesn't guarantee that people
are going to accept what you

00:42:31.367 --> 00:42:32.659
write.
 

00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:39.512
So what does it really mean to
say that there's separation of

00:42:39.512 --> 00:42:45.911
powers because the Court,
ultimately, is dependent upon

00:42:45.911 --> 00:42:50.659
people just going along with
what it says.

00:42:50.659 --> 00:42:55.454
And likewise with the
legislature, yes,

00:42:55.454 --> 00:43:01.889
there's this attempt to
separate--Congress votes.

00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:04.969
In theory only Congress can
declare war,

00:43:04.969 --> 00:43:08.219
and Congress has to fund the
military,

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:13.179
but in practice it's very
difficult for Congress to resist

00:43:13.179 --> 00:43:18.659
what the executive branch wants
to do on all of those things.

00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:24.106
And when we look at cases where
the Court faces down either the

00:43:24.106 --> 00:43:28.938
legislature or the executive
branch it's usually only in

00:43:28.938 --> 00:43:33.420
cases where what they're doing
is very popular.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:41.273
When they're telling Nixon to
turn over the tapes,

00:43:41.273 --> 00:43:51.050
1973-'74, it's a unanimous
court and it's a popular action.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.864
If Nixon had been at 95% in
opinion polls at that time it's

00:43:54.864 --> 00:43:58.809
less clear that the Court would
have faced down the executive

00:43:58.809 --> 00:44:01.976
branch,
or at least so some scholars

00:44:01.976 --> 00:44:02.570
claim.
 

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.550
So how much you really get
separation of powers is a

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:11.079
subject that's greatly debated
by political scientists,

00:44:11.079 --> 00:44:16.329
because at the end of the day,
despite what Madison says

00:44:16.329 --> 00:44:22.250
separation of powers is just
something written on parchment.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:26.880
As Dahl puts it in his critique
of Madison in the preface to

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.896
Democratic Theory,
his most important book which

00:44:31.896 --> 00:44:36.268
was published in 1956 and is
still in print.

00:44:36.268 --> 00:44:40.329
Very few of us can say we wrote
a book fifty years ago that's

00:44:40.329 --> 00:44:42.630
still in print,
but there it is.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:46.190
It is still in print.
 

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:52.387
Dahl says the problem with this
famous one-liner of Madison's is

00:44:52.387 --> 00:44:57.601
that there's actually no real
mechanism to ensure that

00:44:57.601 --> 00:45:01.440
ambition will counteract
ambition,

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.940
and it's rather simply that
people accept this scheme.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.809
But what if they didn't?
 

00:45:09.809 --> 00:45:15.110
What if in 1800 there had not
been a turnover of power?

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:17.849
We had a knife-edge election in
1800.

00:45:17.849 --> 00:45:24.445
Maybe that would have made
America much more prone to the

00:45:24.445 --> 00:45:31.510
seizure of power by those who
currently controlled the levers

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.869
of power,
the military and so on.

00:45:34.869 --> 00:45:40.282
The loser gave up in 1800 and
we began to create this culture

00:45:40.282 --> 00:45:45.063
of democratic turnovers,
where the government loses an

00:45:45.063 --> 00:45:47.949
election and gives up power.
 

00:45:47.949 --> 00:45:52.199
Very unusual thing,
but it happens.

00:45:52.199 --> 00:45:55.971
So separation of powers,
much debated,

00:45:55.971 --> 00:46:01.780
and I'm going to come back to
this, much debated as to how

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.960
effective and important it
really is.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.110
More veto points.
 

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.480
We have bicameralism.
 

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.409
As you know from reading The
Federalist papers,

00:46:13.409 --> 00:46:16.570
the founders were mostly
worried about the power of

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:20.235
Congress because it seemed like
it was going to be the most

00:46:20.235 --> 00:46:21.500
powerful branch.
 

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.039
The executive was weak and
designed to be weak,

00:46:25.039 --> 00:46:28.936
much weaker than it is today,
and so they thought the thing

00:46:28.936 --> 00:46:32.847
to do is to divide Congress,
have a bicameral system,

00:46:32.847 --> 00:46:37.036
and legislation has to be
passed in both houses and have

00:46:37.036 --> 00:46:43.289
them elected by different rules,
so we have Senate seats elected

00:46:43.289 --> 00:46:47.536
at large in the states,
whereas we have small

00:46:47.536 --> 00:46:51.516
congressional districts and
therefore we have very different

00:46:51.516 --> 00:46:55.429
incentives that the politicians
are going to react to,

00:46:55.429 --> 00:47:00.989
very different factions
overlapping with one another in

00:47:00.989 --> 00:47:06.960
different ways to get back to
the basic pluralist ideal.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:12.208
And then finally,
of course, last but by no means

00:47:12.208 --> 00:47:17.018
least in terms of veto points,
federalism.

00:47:17.018 --> 00:47:25.751
Federalism is another source of
veto points in what can actually

00:47:25.751 --> 00:47:27.000
happen.
 

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:37.610
Think in the last few years of
the debates about gay marriage.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:42.365
We have marital law as state
law, and for a long time there

00:47:42.365 --> 00:47:47.123
has been a federal law which
says if you get married in one

00:47:47.123 --> 00:47:52.289
state the marriage will be
recognized in every other state.

00:47:52.289 --> 00:47:56.239
So if people move and then
later on they get divorced or

00:47:56.239 --> 00:48:00.262
one dies it doesn't matter what
state you were in for the

00:48:00.262 --> 00:48:03.639
purposes of the divorce or for
probate law.

00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:07.447
You're still going to be
governed by--it's just this sort

00:48:07.447 --> 00:48:09.760
of utilitarian efficiency thing.
 

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.090
Every state can have
differences in its marital law,

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.996
but California's got to
recognize Connecticut's

00:48:17.996 --> 00:48:19.949
marriages as valid.
 

00:48:19.949 --> 00:48:25.797
Then along comes a socially
divisive issue like gay marriage

00:48:25.797 --> 00:48:31.744
and unsurprisingly some states
want to enact gay marriage and

00:48:31.744 --> 00:48:35.260
some don't,
but then this federal

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.858
requirement that all states
recognize one another's

00:48:39.858 --> 00:48:44.639
marriages suddenly becomes
ideologically charged.

00:48:44.639 --> 00:48:48.730
Whereas it was presented as
just a utilitarian efficient

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.782
thing,
now it becomes ideologically

00:48:51.782 --> 00:48:56.804
charged because if the state of
Massachusetts recognizes gay

00:48:56.804 --> 00:49:01.740
marriage then it implicitly
means that the state of Georgia

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.550
has to recognize it as well.
 

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.550
So you get an upsurge of
political activism,

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:14.282
and finally the Defense of
Marriage Act in Congress to

00:49:14.282 --> 00:49:21.398
preserve the rights of the
states to reject or accept gay

00:49:21.398 --> 00:49:23.050
marriage.
 

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:29.244
And so that's an example of the
veto power of states in play

00:49:29.244 --> 00:49:33.969
that rears its head in a setting
like that.

00:49:33.969 --> 00:49:38.755
And so what you have in the US
is not a democracy,

00:49:38.755 --> 00:49:41.980
certainly not a pure democracy.
 

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.996
You rather have--what they
designed was what they referred

00:49:46.996 --> 00:49:49.989
to as a non-tyrannical republic.
 

00:49:49.989 --> 00:49:52.969
They thought that that was the
best they could do.

00:49:52.969 --> 00:49:58.239
They had misgivings about a lot
of it, but they thought that

00:49:58.239 --> 00:50:03.688
this was the only way they could
create the union and head off

00:50:03.688 --> 00:50:04.940
civil war.
 

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.869
Of course they didn't head off
civil war.

00:50:06.869 --> 00:50:10.673
We had civil war anyway,
a subject I'll come back to on

00:50:10.673 --> 00:50:11.518
Wednesday.
 

00:50:11.518 --> 00:50:16.342
But we created this hybrid
between a non-tyrannical

00:50:16.342 --> 00:50:21.070
republic, if you like,
and a democratic system.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:25.512
And many of our arguments about
contemporary democracy are

00:50:25.512 --> 00:50:30.266
really arguments about how much
we should preserve this hybrid

00:50:30.266 --> 00:50:35.409
and how much we should have a
thoroughgoing democratic system.

00:50:35.409 --> 00:50:38.389
And I'll take that up on
Wednesday.

00:50:38.389 --> 00:50:44.000

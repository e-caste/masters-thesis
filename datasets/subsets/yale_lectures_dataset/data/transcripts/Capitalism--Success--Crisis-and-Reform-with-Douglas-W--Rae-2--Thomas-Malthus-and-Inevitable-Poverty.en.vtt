00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.430
Prof: Okay,
everybody has the handout?

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.078
Let's begin organizing the
day's work.

00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:11.908
I will begin by taking the
snapshot you have in front you

00:02:11.908 --> 00:02:17.425
and than using the data
animation on the board to give

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:21.590
you a sense of the dynamic
process,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.908
which is hidden in the static
diagram before you.

00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:31.359
Our real interest is in the
dynamic process and the statics

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.801
are just like,
for example,

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:38.970
a quote on the Dow Jones for
2:32 in the afternoon.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.949
It's a moving target and the
motion is what's interesting.

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.840
That's the first thing we're
going to do.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.663
The second thing is to look at
the "dismal science"

00:02:52.663 --> 00:02:58.008
of economics as conceived by
Thomas Malthus,

00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:03.848
whose principle work appeared
in 1798 and 1800,

00:03:03.848 --> 00:03:09.601
and which put forward a theory
to the effect that nearly

00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:15.457
universal poverty was an
essential and inevitable fact of

00:03:15.457 --> 00:03:17.550
human existence.
 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.240
Thank God he was wrong.
 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.431
Third, we'll look at Gregory
Clarke's exploration of Malthus'

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:29.389
world.
 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.960
Clarke is the author of
Farewell To Alms,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.669
which I hope all of you have
begun to find your way through.

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:38.860
It's available at Labyrinth.
 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.370
Clarke is something of a
curmudgeon, and he offers

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.878
interpretations,
which should provoke argument.

00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:55.474
For example,
he interprets the demography of

00:03:55.474 --> 00:04:00.158
England in the Malthusian
period,

00:04:00.158 --> 00:04:02.449
before the great surge in the
economy,

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:09.007
in essentially Darwinian terms,
Darwinian both with respect to

00:04:09.007 --> 00:04:12.234
culture,
so social Darwinism,

00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:15.710
but also with respect to
biology.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.293
He flirts with the idea that
the children of the wealthy were

00:04:22.293 --> 00:04:28.550
genetically superior to other
children being born in early

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.805
modern England and that that
fact has something to do with

00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:41.720
why the great economic surge
took place first in England;

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.959
actually more broadly the
United Kingdom.

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:50.036
Finally, and this is a long
agenda, finally I'm going to

00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:52.529
look at economic biology.
 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.430
In particular,
at what is called the world

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.810
demographic transition.
 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.759
The world demographic
transition takes--

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:11.927
it is as nearly regular as
clockwork and it takes societies

00:05:11.927 --> 00:05:15.891
from poverty,
short life spans,

00:05:15.891 --> 00:05:20.324
high birthrates,
high death rates to relative

00:05:20.324 --> 00:05:26.904
affluence combined with capital,
relative affluence with long

00:05:26.904 --> 00:05:29.101
lives,
low birthrates,

00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:34.423
low death rates and lurking
behind the diagram before you is

00:05:34.423 --> 00:05:39.384
the confluence of the great
economic surge and the world

00:05:39.384 --> 00:05:41.910
demographic transition.
 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.569
So forty-five minutes from now
we should be at that point.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.577
The diagram on the board is the
work of Swedish economist Hans

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:55.235
Rosling,
and it is a data animation,

00:05:55.235 --> 00:06:00.338
it's set up as follows:
income per capita is on the

00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:06.014
horizontal dimension,
and that income per capita is

00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:08.600
scaled logarithmically.
 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.047
I'll switch that out in a
minute but we'll start with the

00:06:13.047 --> 00:06:17.651
logarithmic scale and on the
vertical dimension is a linear

00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:20.750
scale for life expectancy at
birth.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.238
The bubbles represent
countries, the larger the bubble

00:06:25.238 --> 00:06:29.050
the greater the population of
the country,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:36.040
the bubbles are color coded to
the map upper right,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.040
so all of the western
hemisphere is shown in yellow;

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.300
Europe and North Asia in orange
and so forth,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.269
and notably Sub-Saharan Africa
in blue.

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:55.072
You'll also find special
interest in the green bubbles

00:06:55.072 --> 00:06:59.149
representing the states of the
Middle East.

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:03.334
Now let's just play this,
it is a time series,

00:07:03.334 --> 00:07:06.310
it's 200 years of time series.
 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:13.209
The bubbles start here in the
year 1806 and begin moving.

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:45.149
 
 

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:52.226
Yes, you're going to need a
microphone, let's hand it to

00:07:52.226 --> 00:07:53.000
you.
 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.721
Student:  Do the
diagonal lines indicate

00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:55.769
&gt;.
 

00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:55.790
Professor Douglas W.
 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.040
Rae:  Say again.
 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.629
Student:  Sorry,
do the diagonal lines--

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:02.838
Prof: Yeah they cast
doubt on the data.

00:08:02.838 --> 00:08:05.028
While you're on stage here what
did you just say?

00:08:05.028 --> 00:08:08.581
Student:  We just
watched 200 years of development

00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:10.740
for a whole series of countries.
 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.889
What I thought some of the more
interesting ones were the

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:15.805
countries that either--
they just showed a clear trend

00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:19.846
the entire time but there were a
few yellow balls sort of start

00:08:19.846 --> 00:08:23.430
overtaking all the other
countries around them as you're

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.670
passing them,
and also there were a few that

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.180
sort of went up and down,
and it went to the exact same

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.680
income per person for a long
period of time.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.340
Prof: Some of them seem
stuck.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.856
And was it mainly yellow balls
or were there some orange balls

00:08:35.856 --> 00:08:36.548
out there?
 

00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:38.549
Student:  No,
no in fact the ones going up

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.509
and down the most and then one
comes first--

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.750
Professor Douglas W.
 

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.293
Rae:  No,
no in the ones that were in the

00:08:42.293 --> 00:08:42.538
lead.
 

00:08:42.538 --> 00:08:43.693
Student:  Oh,
it was a bunch of orange,

00:08:43.693 --> 00:08:45.027
there were just a couple
yellow, and it was generally

00:08:45.027 --> 00:08:45.309
orange.
 

00:08:45.309 --> 00:08:45.950
Prof: Okay.
 

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.730
Now hand the microphone to
somebody else,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.414
we're just going to pass it
around here and get people

00:08:52.414 --> 00:08:53.250
talking.
 

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.940
No, no don't hand it on.
 

00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:01.759
If you were going to describe
to someone who wasn't here what

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:08.351
the main pattern was taking into
account the two variables,

00:09:08.351 --> 00:09:10.740
what would it be?
 

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.524
Student:  Generally
movement toward the upper right

00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:14.210
hand corner.
 

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.596
Prof: Okay lower left,
upper right and lower left,

00:09:17.596 --> 00:09:21.102
upper right and since they're
not here they don't know what

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.009
that means.
 

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:25.222
Student:  Toward greater
income per person as well as

00:09:25.222 --> 00:09:27.129
greater life expectancy at
birth.

00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:30.940
Prof: Okay,
so there is something by and

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.840
large good happening in the
data.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.690
Now there are--let's pass it
onto Yale Egyptology here.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:48.013
Does the--is the progress with
respect to biology and wealth

00:09:48.013 --> 00:09:54.220
evenly distributed or not so
evenly distributed?

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.686
Student:  No,
it's not evenly distributed

00:09:55.686 --> 00:09:57.875
because they all--
all the balls start down in the

00:09:57.875 --> 00:10:01.009
lower left hand corner at the
beginning very tightly packed,

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:04.288
while they all eventually move
up and over to the right.

00:10:04.288 --> 00:10:10.195
Some are still quite far to the
left and some are all the way to

00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:11.320
the right.
 

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.029
Prof: Would he actually
go backward?

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:16.178
Student:  Some might.
 

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:18.942
Prof: Okay it's hard to
ask you to remember all that

00:10:18.942 --> 00:10:21.799
with a rather complex basketball
game on the screen there.

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:26.220
Could we hand it on?
 

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:32.759
Would you--if you were a god,
or God's accountant,

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:37.139
and you were a God friendly to
humankind,

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:39.394
would you say,
by and large,

00:10:39.394 --> 00:10:44.658
what you're seeing there looks
like the world getting better?

00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:48.720
Student:  I would say so
because there was a general

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.370
improvement,
but at the same time,

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.269
you see some of the other
countries,

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:58.668
we'll say the purple ones,
which are located in Africa--

00:10:58.668 --> 00:11:01.120
Prof: I think they're
blue.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:07.394
Yes--
Student: 

00:11:07.394 --> 00:11:09.120
&gt;
 

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.851
but compared to the other
countries even though overall

00:11:12.851 --> 00:11:16.235
adjusted shift toward the upper
right hand corner,

00:11:16.235 --> 00:11:18.929
but it wasn't evenly
distributed.

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.360
Prof: Okay, terrific.
 

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.649
Pass the mic straight back,
please.

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:25.541
Do the dots,
or the bubbles,

00:11:25.541 --> 00:11:31.325
show all the inequality
involved with all the people in

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:35.610
the world or do they mask
something?

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:44.730
Let's take, for example,
the enormous--look at the very

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:51.320
large light blue bubble center
stage.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.570
It represents India.
 

00:11:54.570 --> 00:12:01.785
As far as we can tell from this
graph, everybody has the same

00:12:01.785 --> 00:12:07.918
income and probably works for
Wipro in Bangalore.

00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:16.629
In actual fact--I don't know do
you know anything about India?

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:48.440
Student: 
&gt;

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.139
Prof: Okay, good.
 

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:53.868
Now we could infer from that
that the vertical side,

00:12:53.868 --> 00:12:58.254
the vertical dimension of the
world economy can be thought of

00:12:58.254 --> 00:12:59.570
in two phases.
 

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:05.346
One is the difference between
countries measured here by mean

00:13:05.346 --> 00:13:09.562
GDP per capita,
and the differences within

00:13:09.562 --> 00:13:12.817
countries,
which would be represented by

00:13:12.817 --> 00:13:16.524
an income curve or a wealth
curve within each of the

00:13:16.524 --> 00:13:17.470
countries.
 

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:23.412
It turns out that there's quite
a lot of inequality inside the

00:13:23.412 --> 00:13:28.965
bubbles and that that inequality
is most pronounced in the

00:13:28.965 --> 00:13:34.808
countries which are in the early
stages of getting rich.

00:13:34.808 --> 00:13:38.820
The general pattern,
India is a good example,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.428
and the fiction work assigned
for the course,

00:13:41.428 --> 00:13:46.433
White Tiger,
is about that vertical

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:53.269
dimension and how exhilarating
it is on the one hand,

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:58.581
and the crushing disadvantage
it imposes on people who aren't

00:13:58.581 --> 00:14:02.389
part of the capitalist
development story.

00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:09.644
Okay, now I want to change the
diagram to get a little more

00:14:09.644 --> 00:14:15.023
finesse here,
and now I have made the income

00:14:15.023 --> 00:14:17.149
curve linear.
 

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:23.532
So it no longer exaggerates
movement at the low end of the

00:14:23.532 --> 00:14:27.173
scale,
and what I'd like you to do is

00:14:27.173 --> 00:14:32.528
watch this process and tell me
what you think you're seeing.

00:14:32.528 --> 00:14:36.419
These are the same data just
projected differently.

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:51.309
 
 

00:14:51.309 --> 00:15:05.178
Now watch for some shooters.
 

00:15:05.178 --> 00:15:08.916
Now let me do the last half of
that projection once more and

00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:11.070
then we'll try to talk about it.
 

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.070
Could we get a mic up and going
in that section please?

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:21.409
We're going to play from--let's
go around 1900 here.

00:15:21.409 --> 00:15:43.220
 
 

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:49.418
Okay, so over here,
who's got the mic?

00:15:49.418 --> 00:15:54.697
Can you describe the path that
the vast majority of the

00:15:54.697 --> 00:15:56.750
countries followed?
 

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:03.177
Student:  The majority
of the countries within the

00:16:03.177 --> 00:16:07.538
graph gain
&gt;

00:16:07.538 --> 00:16:11.654
Prof: Okay,
so what's just been said is

00:16:11.654 --> 00:16:16.595
that the majority of the
countries show modest gains in

00:16:16.595 --> 00:16:21.899
income per capita and
substantial gains in longevity,

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:26.830
so they move vertically,
more or less vertically,

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.850
and then they pass second base,
so to speak,

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:36.360
and turn right across the
income field.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.740
Let's run it once more.
 

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:43.875
Pass the mic please;
I'm going to ask the next

00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:48.424
person to take a shot at which
countries are the shooters,

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:50.899
which defy what I just said.
 

00:16:50.899 --> 00:17:15.490
 
 

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.348
Who's got the mic?
 

00:17:17.348 --> 00:17:18.740
Who do you think those shooters
are?

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.634
Student:  The shooters
seem to be Europe,

00:17:22.634 --> 00:17:25.950
and the Middle East,
and North Africa.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:31.300
Prof: Is there--what are
the--how would you go about

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:37.205
getting huge gains in income per
capita without going through the

00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:41.818
prior step of having people live
quite awhile?

00:17:41.818 --> 00:17:45.358
How would you get--what might
make that feasible?

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:48.931
Student:  Especially for
the green countries it seems

00:17:48.931 --> 00:17:52.140
that GDP per capita really
spiked in a few decades.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.782
Prof: Okay what--don't
hold us in suspense,

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:57.049
the green countries might have
a lot of?

00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:58.700
Student:  Oil.
 

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.950
Prof: Oil,
okay so the oil states,

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:07.555
if you bracket the oil states
you've got a very general

00:18:07.555 --> 00:18:13.366
worldwide pattern of modest
gains in income combined with

00:18:13.366 --> 00:18:17.519
substantial gains in public
health,

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:22.278
followed by continued gains in
public health,

00:18:22.278 --> 00:18:27.625
though at a decreasing rate
combined with large gains in

00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:29.568
income per capita.
 

00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:38.019
Now notice that the point made
five minutes ago still holds.

00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:43.452
When I say that the GDP per
capita of a country doubled in a

00:18:43.452 --> 00:18:48.518
period, does it mean that the
GDP of most people in that

00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:50.358
country doubled?
 

00:18:50.358 --> 00:18:57.211
The answer to that--can we get
the mic to center--I'm sorry

00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:59.930
where's the mic here?
 

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.210
There we go--yep go ahead.
 

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.367
Student:  Not
necessarily, because the chart

00:19:03.367 --> 00:19:05.828
doesn't take into account income
and inequality within the

00:19:05.828 --> 00:19:06.650
country itself.
 

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.996
Prof: Okay,
and let's think of the oil

00:19:08.996 --> 00:19:10.170
states for a minute.
 

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:16.220
What generally happens to the
vast share of--

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:22.124
large shares of revenue from
oil extraction in the middle

00:19:22.124 --> 00:19:25.920
decades of the twentieth
century,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.338
which is what we're talking
about?

00:19:27.338 --> 00:19:30.029
Student:  It remains
concentrated in the hands of a

00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:33.002
few, like, politically connected
individuals probably ruling the

00:19:33.002 --> 00:19:33.568
country.
 

00:19:33.568 --> 00:19:36.296
Prof: Okay,
they either remain in the hands

00:19:36.296 --> 00:19:39.039
of a local elite,
for the most part,

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:44.021
or they are siphoned off by a
large international energy

00:19:44.021 --> 00:19:48.328
company,
but the vast majority of people

00:19:48.328 --> 00:19:54.558
in such a society often don't
benefit very much from that,

00:19:54.558 --> 00:19:59.604
and that becomes a huge issue
in world politics and in

00:19:59.604 --> 00:20:02.460
attitudes toward capitalism.
 

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.623
Okay the URL of this data,
and I've explored here less

00:20:08.623 --> 00:20:16.038
than 1% of its potential,
is www.gapminder.org.com and it

00:20:16.038 --> 00:20:23.817
is a resource I would like you
to use in the background for

00:20:23.817 --> 00:20:25.828
this course.
 

00:20:25.828 --> 00:20:27.798
Just out of curiosity how many
of you had used it before?

00:20:27.798 --> 00:20:32.118
Okay the rest of you should
join in.

00:20:32.118 --> 00:20:37.940
This is the most useful
technique for staying awake

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:44.692
while thinking about numbers
late at night that I have ever

00:20:44.692 --> 00:20:45.740
seen.
 

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.986
I showed it to grandchildren
ranging down to four and they

00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:51.029
all love it.
 

00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:57.537
Alright now this is the diagram
that Clarke presents at the

00:20:57.537 --> 00:21:00.230
beginning of his book.
 

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:06.654
It's taken from Angus Maddison,
who is the lead researcher on

00:21:06.654 --> 00:21:12.759
everything before 1800 in
economic history these days,

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:17.421
and literally every--there are
perhaps fifty books that touch

00:21:17.421 --> 00:21:22.239
on this material and every one
of them is Maddison reformulated

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:23.558
and resliced.
 

00:21:23.558 --> 00:21:26.788
These are the four things I
told you we were going to do,

00:21:26.788 --> 00:21:28.230
we've done one of them.
 

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:34.269
Malthus and Clarke refer to the
left side before the great surge

00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:39.828
and the biology part about the
world demographic transition

00:21:39.828 --> 00:21:44.910
concerns the movement across
from left to right,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.910
which stands behind these
changes.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:54.788
Now Malthus and the logic of
perpetual poverty;

00:21:54.788 --> 00:22:03.161
Thomas Malthus was a Cambridge
wrangler, meaning he was at the

00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:09.200
very top of the student body at
Cambridge.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:16.369
He was a fellow of Jesus
College, he was a devout

00:22:16.369 --> 00:22:26.380
Christian, and he was a follower
of David Ricardo and David Hume.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.868
He was an empiricist.
 

00:22:28.868 --> 00:22:35.436
He looked at the world around
him and devised a simple model,

00:22:35.436 --> 00:22:41.894
and Clarke makes it a good bit
more complicated than Malthus

00:22:41.894 --> 00:22:42.880
does.
 

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.017
The reason for that is that
Clarke wants to make it look

00:22:47.017 --> 00:22:52.539
like contemporary economics,
and the actual equilibrium

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:58.920
story is very different from the
equilibrium story in

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.618
Microeconomics 101.
 

00:23:01.618 --> 00:23:06.861
The influence of David Ricardo,
there were three great

00:23:06.861 --> 00:23:12.596
classical economists Adam Smith
who we're going to study on

00:23:12.596 --> 00:23:15.740
Wednesday,
David Ricardo whom we're not

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.555
going to study,
and Karl Marx who we're going

00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:19.798
to study in a week.
 

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:26.502
The contribution of Ricardo to
Malthus was that Ricardo had

00:23:26.502 --> 00:23:33.900
devised what he called "the
iron law of real wages."

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:42.858
The gist of that was that no
matter what the technology,

00:23:42.858 --> 00:23:45.994
no matter what the
demographics,

00:23:45.994 --> 00:23:51.759
the inflation adjusted wages
paid to unskilled labor would

00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:58.838
always tend toward the bottom of
the scale we've been looking at,

00:23:58.838 --> 00:24:02.119
would always tend toward the
level of mere survival,

00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:04.759
or subsistence as they say.
 

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:12.161
In the back of Malthus'
thinking is both Ricardo's iron

00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:19.700
law and the empirics of 200
years of stagnate wages,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.308
which the English working class
had experienced.

00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:36.317
Ricardo's main intuition had to
do with two forms of arithmetic

00:24:36.317 --> 00:24:39.029
progression.
 

00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:42.490
On the left,
counting by hundreds,

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.420
from 100 to 1,000 in the
production of goods.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:53.410
In the center counting by
doubling at each cycle,

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:57.598
the population of the same
society,

00:24:57.598 --> 00:25:04.585
and on the right hand side,
product per capita derived

00:25:04.585 --> 00:25:11.440
obviously enough by dividing the
one by the other.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.548
Let's say the subsistence point
is half a bucket per person.

00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:21.058
You then--this was Malthus' big
point--

00:25:21.058 --> 00:25:26.295
that everything progresses
until you get to the point where

00:25:26.295 --> 00:25:31.169
people begin to fall below
subsistence level and with a

00:25:31.169 --> 00:25:34.868
very unequal distribution of
income,

00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:39.250
which was inevitable in this
period,

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.529
as it is inevitable in the
present period,

00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:44.308
or nearly so.
 

00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:49.970
You would find a solution--well
what would be the solutions?

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.637
There are two main kinds of
solutions, one let's generate a

00:25:53.637 --> 00:25:55.029
lot more production.
 

00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:59.426
Let's get the scale of
production to not be a linear

00:25:59.426 --> 00:26:02.098
flat line but get it do this.
 

00:26:02.098 --> 00:26:07.230
Get production to go north in
the same way population does and

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.098
Malthus asserted that that
couldn't be done.

00:26:11.098 --> 00:26:14.232
Now we'll see,
and we know in our own

00:26:14.232 --> 00:26:17.278
experience, that he was
mistaken.

00:26:17.278 --> 00:26:22.320
Production has done exactly
that through the introduction of

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.970
capital intensive production.
 

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:33.229
The pessimism in this scenario
can be linked to a correct

00:26:33.229 --> 00:26:41.930
intuition about England or any
other agricultural society in

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:48.420
the period from let's say 1200
to 1800,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.180
that's the period Clarke
chooses.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:55.880
The first thing that is--that
strikes you about this is

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.470
they're not making land anymore.
 

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.568
Only the Dutch make new land.
 

00:27:01.568 --> 00:27:09.420
So you're going to deal with a
fixed total of arable land.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:15.237
You have, and let's assume,
that you have a growing

00:27:15.237 --> 00:27:16.750
population.
 

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.601
The land mass is static,
the population is growing,

00:27:20.601 --> 00:27:25.300
let's just assume that for the
moment, and assume it's growing

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.150
in a Malthusian way.
 

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:33.126
Let's imagine this is actually
a photograph of berry pickers in

00:27:33.126 --> 00:27:37.609
Poland in the year 1909,
all the visual images here--or

00:27:37.609 --> 00:27:41.119
virtually all the visual images
here comes from Wikipedia

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:43.988
Common,
and since we're being filmed

00:27:43.988 --> 00:27:47.799
that's important so that we
don't violate anyone's

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:50.921
copyright,
because everything on Wikipedia

00:27:50.921 --> 00:27:52.558
Common is public domain.
 

00:27:52.558 --> 00:28:00.348
We get--that 70 is a little
hard to isn't it?

00:28:00.348 --> 00:28:05.715
We get land acre,
we've got 100 units of land for

00:28:05.715 --> 00:28:12.201
this berry farm and production
increases as we increase the

00:28:12.201 --> 00:28:16.450
number of workers from one to
12,

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:22.834
it starts at 50 with one worker
and ends up at 174 bushels or

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:24.750
buckets with 12.
 

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:30.681
Since the land is fixed the
marginal impact of each new

00:28:30.681 --> 00:28:37.381
worker is a little less than the
marginal impact of the worker

00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:38.588
before.
 

00:28:38.588 --> 00:28:45.787
The blue series boils it down
to bushels per worker,

00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:53.971
and we have cut 50 bushels to
15 bushels, by going from one

00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:57.500
worker to 12 workers.
 

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:04.053
This is all just made up stuff,
but it captures the intuition

00:29:04.053 --> 00:29:10.170
about diminishing returns to
intensification of labor.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:16.700
The constants in this story are
land and capital.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.568
We're not adding new land,
we're not adding new capital.

00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:23.710
We're just adding new workers
to an existing quantity of land.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:33.253
The intuition that guided
Malthus was that as you

00:29:33.253 --> 00:29:44.190
intensified labor you got
diminishing total returns,

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.785
the red arc,
which implied,

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:51.557
by perfectly simple logic,
a diminishing rate of

00:29:51.557 --> 00:29:54.058
production for each worker.
 

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:58.696
That intuition is really,
that along with the iron law of

00:29:58.696 --> 00:30:02.588
wages, is at the middle of
Malthus' thinking.

00:30:02.588 --> 00:30:06.471
On the cultural--who here went
to a high school where you

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:07.579
learned Latin?
 

00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:11.088
Ready for this one?
 

00:30:11.088 --> 00:30:14.140
Have we got a mic,
where's the microphone for him?

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:21.269
Student:  If one doesn't
lose, another doesn't acquire.

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:24.359
Prof: Okay,
if none loses no other

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:25.210
acquires.
 

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.630
Student:  No one loses,
and no one gains.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.088
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:30:29.088 --> 00:30:30.438
This was St.
 

00:30:30.438 --> 00:30:32.124
Thomas, and St.
 

00:30:32.124 --> 00:30:39.430
Thomas was expressing the core
conviction of classical Greece,

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.071
though not Rome,
classical Greece and

00:30:43.071 --> 00:30:48.838
Christianity in the middle Ages
and early modern times.

00:30:48.838 --> 00:30:54.138
All the scruples,
all the rules about usury being

00:30:54.138 --> 00:30:59.990
not okay, that is lending at
interest being a biblical

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:05.068
violation, all those ideas come
from this;

00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:10.750
that the total wealth produced
by and for mankind,

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:16.611
humankind, by and for
humankind, is essentially a

00:31:16.611 --> 00:31:21.644
fixed quantity,
so that as I get rich the act

00:31:21.644 --> 00:31:26.730
of getting rich imposes relative
poverty on others.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:33.088
In schematic form we have a two
person society and going away

00:31:33.088 --> 00:31:37.328
from the origin means getting
richer,

00:31:37.328 --> 00:31:41.210
the budget plane is a 45 degree
angle,

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:50.950
where X Y = a constant sum so
that movements of getting rich,

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.769
in either direction along that
budget plane,

00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:58.048
imply making others poor.
 

00:31:58.048 --> 00:32:02.608
This was a deeply held
assumption that the best

00:32:02.608 --> 00:32:06.970
educated and least educated
alike shared,

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:13.690
and it accounts partly for the
underlying trope in Malthus,

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:17.623
and it tells us something about
the brilliant originality of

00:32:17.623 --> 00:32:20.823
Adam Smith and his
contemporaries in the Scottish

00:32:20.823 --> 00:32:24.269
enlightenment when they said,
"not so."

00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:31.276
If you represent the same thing
with three--my artwork is a

00:32:31.276 --> 00:32:33.328
little limited.
 

00:32:33.328 --> 00:32:38.179
You have to imagine that these
are three dimensions like the

00:32:38.179 --> 00:32:42.123
two for me,
you and he, and that we've

00:32:42.123 --> 00:32:47.710
drawn--that the budget
constraint as a plane here,

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.788
and then you have to imagine
that the green dot is on that

00:32:50.788 --> 00:32:51.220
plane.
 

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.410
It takes a little imagining,
I've stared at it a while.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:00.237
The point is this:
that as you move the dot it's

00:33:00.237 --> 00:33:06.502
impossible to make any movement
which doesn't disadvantage one

00:33:06.502 --> 00:33:09.788
of the three people or more.
 

00:33:09.788 --> 00:33:15.289
The general assumption,
more or less analogous to zero

00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:21.518
sumness in game theory--how many
of you have done Ben Polak's

00:33:21.518 --> 00:33:22.660
course?
 

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.857
More or less analogous to the
zero sum theory,

00:33:26.857 --> 00:33:32.269
or to the way small children
think about sharing Lego's.

00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:36.547
If I put more in my contraption
there are fewer for you to use

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:38.088
in your contraption.
 

00:33:38.088 --> 00:33:42.710
That is a fundamental
assumption in this whole way of

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.153
looking at the world,
and it corresponds to reality

00:33:47.153 --> 00:33:49.019
most of the time.
 

00:33:49.019 --> 00:33:53.925
Most of the time in a low
capital, principally

00:33:53.925 --> 00:33:59.269
agricultural economy,
the world acts like this;

00:33:59.269 --> 00:34:06.421
new gold doesn't emerge,
new ways of producing at much

00:34:06.421 --> 00:34:13.608
higher rates are invisible,
and when we get to Marx we'll

00:34:13.608 --> 00:34:20.103
see that he puts this rabbit in
the hat by the way he defines

00:34:20.103 --> 00:34:23.407
the value,
the exchange value and the use

00:34:23.407 --> 00:34:27.139
value of goods,
he puts this zero sum condition

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:32.313
in by the way he measures labor
and uses labor to define the

00:34:32.313 --> 00:34:36.797
value of everything,
so that only by imposing

00:34:36.797 --> 00:34:42.940
surplus hours of work on the
working class can we get richer.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.090
Horse feathers!
 

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.280
Just not true.
 

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.380
but that's for another day.
 

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:58.793
Now Clarke's
explorations--who's had an hour

00:34:58.793 --> 00:35:03.099
or more with Clarke?
 

00:35:03.099 --> 00:35:07.030
That's a little worrying.
 

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:16.840
We got a mic here?
 

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.429
Is it on?
 

00:35:19.429 --> 00:35:21.860
Do you like Clarke or not like
him?

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.079
Student:  He's very
interesting.

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:26.260
I think he writes very well,
it's convincing,

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.489
and very clear.
 

00:35:27.489 --> 00:35:32.469
Prof: He's convincing,
he's clear, he is empirical.

00:35:32.469 --> 00:35:38.079
There's some kind of a chart of
table for everything,

00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:40.670
and he is opinionated.
 

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:45.934
It's not the kind of cool
dispassion that let's say Rick

00:35:45.934 --> 00:35:49.380
Levin might value in an
economist.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:55.280
It's a much more heated style
of argument.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.688
I actually think he's sometimes
a little off,

00:35:57.688 --> 00:36:00.920
but he's making the argument in
a really interesting way.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.590
One of the things he does is
shown in this chart,

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.949
which is taken from I believe
Page 31 in his book,

00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:13.969
and this is total population on
the vertical dimension,

00:36:13.969 --> 00:36:15.869
income per capita on the
horizontal dimension.

00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:21.585
The red dots represent
estimates taken once every ten

00:36:21.585 --> 00:36:27.739
years between 1200 and 1600,
and they form an interesting

00:36:27.739 --> 00:36:29.059
pattern.
 

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:33.960
He combines this with something
else so it's hard to define,

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.344
but if you decombine it,
it's almost as if there were a

00:36:37.344 --> 00:36:41.523
budget plane here,
and you can move up and down

00:36:41.523 --> 00:36:47.250
the budget plane but not through
it so that the total--

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:54.045
it's these dots moving away
that could be explained

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:56.900
Malthus-wise or St.
 

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:02.186
Augustine-wise by assuming that
there is a fixed total,

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:06.496
and you can use it to feed more
people worse,

00:37:06.496 --> 00:37:09.139
or fewer people better.
 

00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:14.945
Indeed, if you pull out the
data for the time of the great

00:37:14.945 --> 00:37:21.159
plague, population goes down and
per capita income goes up.

00:37:21.159 --> 00:37:28.947
Now how exact do you think our
records of incomes in England in

00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:30.329
1380 are?
 

00:37:30.329 --> 00:37:35.974
It's a stretch to try and make
this highly quantitative,

00:37:35.974 --> 00:37:39.260
but it's probably not far off.
 

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:44.954
He then--if you then add 1600
to 1800 you get something

00:37:44.954 --> 00:37:51.389
different and you begin to get a
surge in population that does

00:37:51.389 --> 00:37:57.190
not correspond to a huge loss in
per capita income.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.809
Implicit in that is the idea
that we are breaking through

00:38:01.809 --> 00:38:03.130
budget planes.
 

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.559
Not in big ways,
not in elegant ways,

00:38:07.559 --> 00:38:12.949
but there is something
happening which takes us further

00:38:12.949 --> 00:38:19.239
and further from the central
tenants of the Malthusian model.

00:38:19.239 --> 00:38:25.291
This is Clarke on real wages
from 1200 on the left to 1800 on

00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:30.838
the right and the spike in the
middle is at least partly

00:38:30.838 --> 00:38:36.588
attributable to the influence of
population decline in the

00:38:36.588 --> 00:38:39.010
century before it.
 

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.554
I've drawn it so it looks like
a much bigger mountain than it

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:45.923
is,
it's actually a very gentle

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:50.179
swell and you can find a version
of it no doubt more accurate

00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:51.809
than mine in Clarke.
 

00:38:51.809 --> 00:38:59.146
The consumption patterns of
ordinary workers in this period

00:38:59.146 --> 00:39:01.550
were very modest.
 

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:05.242
Food and drink accounted for
three quarters of spending and I

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:07.518
think this is pretty good
empirics.

00:39:07.518 --> 00:39:12.887
Clothing and bedding 10%,
housing and heating,

00:39:12.887 --> 00:39:16.110
light and soap,
not much.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:20.199
Life was pretty dark,
pretty limited.

00:39:20.199 --> 00:39:28.489
The level of discretionary
spending was very slight.

00:39:28.489 --> 00:39:32.170
There's a general rule called
Engel's Law,

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.869
and this is not the Engel's who
worked with Marx,

00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:39.119
this is Ernst Engels,
lived in the 1800s,

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:43.583
that as real incomes go up the
fraction spent on food goes

00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:46.266
down,
and while that's not exactly a

00:39:46.266 --> 00:39:50.315
blinding insight it nonetheless
has the advantage of being a

00:39:50.315 --> 00:39:51.550
true statement.
 

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:57.786
Within food the proteins,
principally meat,

00:39:57.786 --> 00:40:04.916
to a lesser degree fish,
systematically displaced

00:40:04.916 --> 00:40:12.639
starches until you get to our
stage of gluttony.

00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:19.934
The most interesting piece in
Clarke is his handling of wealth

00:40:19.934 --> 00:40:27.710
and reproduction and I will ask
you to read it for yourselves,

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:33.976
but the gist is this,
that the number of surviving

00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:40.757
children produced in each
generation was greater among

00:40:40.757 --> 00:40:46.130
wealthy families than among poor
ones.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:52.090
It's pretty easy to think of
reasons that might be true.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.246
For example,
money for heating your house

00:40:55.246 --> 00:40:57.219
and feeding the babies.
 

00:40:57.219 --> 00:41:06.679
The point that Clarke makes of
that is more controversial.

00:41:06.679 --> 00:41:11.606
Clarke wants to say that a
cascade of children born at the

00:41:11.606 --> 00:41:16.195
top of the pyramid,
a cascade of those children

00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:22.161
were forced to be downwardly
mobile for a long period of time

00:41:22.161 --> 00:41:28.027
populating each level of British
society with adults who had

00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:33.199
begun life with the advantages
of being on top.

00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:36.460
It's easy to make up a story,
which Clarke does,

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.197
to the effect that the
energetic effort you might

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:45.103
expect from those people who had
been pushed down might increase

00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:49.699
the intensity of effort and
competition in the economy.

00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:58.938
He then makes a series of
gestures towards biological

00:41:58.938 --> 00:42:01.070
Darwinism.
 

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:07.835
To the effect that Britain led
the industrial revolution

00:42:07.835 --> 00:42:13.617
because it had a
disproportionate number of very

00:42:13.617 --> 00:42:17.512
able people,
and the assumption here is that

00:42:17.512 --> 00:42:19.780
the rich were more able than the
poor.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:25.512
It had a disproportionate
number of very able people in

00:42:25.512 --> 00:42:28.909
all the levels of the pyramid.
 

00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:34.820
Now the empirics on that one
are really thin.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:40.559
There's an awful lot of vapor
in the intellectual process

00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:41.380
there.
 

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.411
This is characteristic of
Clarke, he's really interesting

00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:49.802
in throwing out thoughts that
should provoke an argument and I

00:42:49.802 --> 00:42:53.978
should think you should be able
to generate arguments among

00:42:53.978 --> 00:42:56.210
yourselves on that topic.
 

00:42:56.210 --> 00:43:02.221
Now biology gone good;
I'm going to tell this one in

00:43:02.221 --> 00:43:06.000
words and then give you the
diagram.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.980
In every society,
in the Malthusian phase,

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:20.411
life is short and babies are
plentiful so that a typical

00:43:20.411 --> 00:43:25.789
household might have eight or
ten children,

00:43:25.789 --> 00:43:30.449
of whom perhaps three or four
might survive into adulthood,

00:43:30.449 --> 00:43:35.847
and having survived into
adulthood many would die at your

00:43:35.847 --> 00:43:38.449
age or something like it.
 

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:43.097
The throughput of human beings
was extremely fast,

00:43:43.097 --> 00:43:48.980
that's a way to think of it in
relation to total population.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:55.085
Then the death rate falls,
and when the death rate falls

00:43:55.085 --> 00:43:59.969
the birthrate does not respond
right away.

00:43:59.969 --> 00:44:03.708
In fact, it takes several
generations typically for

00:44:03.708 --> 00:44:07.150
birthrates to adjust to falling
death rates.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:11.047
The consequence of that,
there were several,

00:44:11.047 --> 00:44:16.487
but the most fundamental for us
is that the population of the

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:19.570
world went north very rapidly.
 

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:23.559
They're having lots of babies
and people are living long

00:44:23.559 --> 00:44:24.139
lives.
 

00:44:24.139 --> 00:44:29.893
Then ultimately the birthrate
does fall and when it falls we

00:44:29.893 --> 00:44:35.650
have both the birthrate and the
death rate at low levels.

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:42.666
People live long lives and the
population of their societies

00:44:42.666 --> 00:44:46.949
becomes more or less static
again.

00:44:46.949 --> 00:44:50.760
It is then possible to go one
step beyond that,

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.927
and the one step beyond that is
that the birthrate overtakes the

00:44:55.927 --> 00:45:00.630
death rate on the low side,
and the society begins to do

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.230
two things at once.
 

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:06.623
It becomes smaller and to have
a higher and higher fraction of

00:45:06.623 --> 00:45:07.920
very old people.
 

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:13.059
Can anyone name a society that
is in that stage?

00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:14.070
Yes.
 

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:15.010
Student:  Japan.
 

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:15.219
Prof: Japan.
 

00:45:15.219 --> 00:45:16.070
Fine.
 

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.193
Japan is there,
Russia is pretty much there,

00:45:19.193 --> 00:45:22.244
much of Italy is right on the
edge of that,

00:45:22.244 --> 00:45:24.860
much of Eastern Europe is
there.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.635
Now the picture;
this is the population surge in

00:45:28.635 --> 00:45:31.632
every continent,
I'll post the slides and I'll

00:45:31.632 --> 00:45:35.030
post them in a way that you can
read them next time,

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:36.030
I promise.
 

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:41.860
All the continents turn north
beginning sometime after 1800

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:48.094
and that reflects the fact that
they are in the progress of the

00:45:48.094 --> 00:45:50.809
demographic transition.
 

00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:56.617
Now this is a conventional
representation of the transition

00:45:56.617 --> 00:45:58.320
in four phases.
 

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.728
In the first phase we have
death and birthrates somewhat

00:46:03.728 --> 00:46:06.579
unstable but steadily high.
 

00:46:06.579 --> 00:46:10.170
Then the death rate falls.
 

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:17.387
The major cause is clean water,
household hygiene,

00:46:17.387 --> 00:46:25.637
a little bit higher calorie
diet, and at the later stages

00:46:25.637 --> 00:46:30.940
some aspects of modern medicine.
 

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:35.550
The birthrate doesn't adjust,
and Phase II consists of the

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:40.324
period when the death rate is
falling fast and the birthrate

00:46:40.324 --> 00:46:44.369
remains more or less constant at
a high level.

00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:48.117
Then Phase III,
the birthrate is now stable at

00:46:48.117 --> 00:46:53.280
a relatively low level and the
birthrate is falling to meet the

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.530
death rate.
 

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:58.735
Then in Phase IV you've got
both of them at relatively low

00:46:58.735 --> 00:46:59.400
levels.
 

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.690
Now we come back,
at this point,

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.980
to the picture we began with.
 

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:10.500
Much of what you see in this
diagram,

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.838
and much of what you saw in the
dynamic animation at the

00:47:14.838 --> 00:47:20.286
beginning of the hour,
consists of passage through the

00:47:20.286 --> 00:47:22.980
demographic transition.
 

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:30.452
Most of what you see on the
left third is societies that are

00:47:30.452 --> 00:47:35.139
in Stage II or early in Stage
III,

00:47:35.139 --> 00:47:39.916
most of the middle is Phase III
where the birthrate is falling

00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:43.050
but you're still building
population,

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:46.108
and the prediction is that
we're going to build the world

00:47:46.108 --> 00:47:49.168
population from a little under
seven million [correction:

00:47:49.168 --> 00:47:50.972
billion]
to about eight and a half

00:47:50.972 --> 00:47:52.501
million [correction:
billion]

00:47:52.501 --> 00:47:57.786
before you guys are my age,
and mostly Stage IV out on the

00:47:57.786 --> 00:47:58.559
right.
 

00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:05.295
Now the pertinent fact that you
need to carry forward from that

00:48:05.295 --> 00:48:10.400
last little piece is this:
the world demographic

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:16.811
transition has happened in a
sequential fashion so there are

00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:19.309
temporal offsets.
 

00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:23.869
Societies that are in Phase IV,
low birthrate,

00:48:23.869 --> 00:48:29.746
low death rate tend to have a
lot of capital and tend to be

00:48:29.746 --> 00:48:32.280
short on cheap labor.
 

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:38.914
Societies that are in Phase II
or Phase III tend to be long on

00:48:38.914 --> 00:48:42.829
cheap labor and short on
capital,

00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:48.594
and the dynamic of world trade
which is such an important part

00:48:48.594 --> 00:48:53.697
of capitalism is a way of
arbitraging between early and

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:58.800
late phases in the world
demographic transition so that

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:04.565
cheap labor maximizes its value
by being combined with capital

00:49:04.565 --> 00:49:07.590
from Phase IV societies.
 

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:14.181
On Wednesday we'll come back to
the eighteenth century with Adam

00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:19.938
Smith, who is in my view,
the greatest of all writers on

00:49:19.938 --> 00:49:22.449
economy and society.
 

00:49:22.449 --> 00:49:28.000

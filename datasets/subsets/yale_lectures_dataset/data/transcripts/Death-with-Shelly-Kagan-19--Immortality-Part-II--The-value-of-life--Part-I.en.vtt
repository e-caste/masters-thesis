00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.586
Professor Shelly Kagan:
We've been talking about the

00:00:04.586 --> 00:00:08.013
question as to whether or not it
would be desirable to live

00:00:08.013 --> 00:00:11.498
forever, whether immortality
would actually be a good thing,

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:14.275
as most of normally presume,
or whether in fact,

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:17.820
as Bernard Williams argues,
it would be undesirable.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.467
The question we turned to was,
just let your imagination run

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:23.779
free.
Instead of asking what would it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.296
be like to continue living a
longer kind of trajectory that

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:30.812
humans have in the real world
where you just get sicker and

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:33.420
more and more frail and
incapacitated,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.016
ask yourself not whether
immortality of that sort

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:38.266
would be valuable,
but is it even so much as

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.455
possible to describe a
life that you would want to live

00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:44.390
forever?
That's the question I left you

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.931
with last time.
I think I already tipped my

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.350
cards on this matter.
I'm inclined to agree with

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.442
Williams.
I think that no matter how we

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:58.740
try to fill in the blank,
it's a very long blank.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.985
The crucial point here for us
is that immortality means not

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:05.286
just living a very long time or
even an extraordinarily long

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:07.810
time,
but literally living forever.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.361
I think it's very difficult,
indeed I think it's impossible,

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:14.250
to think of anything you'd want
to do forever.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.253
I have a friend who once
claimed to me that he wanted to

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:20.584
live forever so that he could
have Thai food every day for the

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:23.650
rest of,
well, the rest of eternity.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.453
I like Thai food just fine,
but the prospect of having Thai

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:31.060
food day after day after day
after day for thousands,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.554
millions, billions,
trillions of years no longer

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:38.431
seems an attractive proposal.
It seems like it becomes some

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.892
kind of a nightmare.
And the same way that I

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.938
indicated previously that
although I like chocolate--I

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:47.158
love chocolate--the
prospect of having to eat more

00:01:47.158 --> 00:01:50.090
and more and more and more and
more chocolate,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.300
eventually the idea becomes a
sickening one.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.036
Think of any activity.
Some of you may enjoy doing

00:01:56.036 --> 00:01:58.813
crossword puzzles,
and perhaps doing crossword

00:01:58.813 --> 00:02:01.590
puzzles a couple hours a day is
enjoyable.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.795
But imagine doing crossword
puzzles every day for 10 years,

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:07.825
1,000 years,
a million years,

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.580
a billion years,
a trillion years.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.840
Eventually, presumably,
so it seems to me,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.816
you'd end up saying,
"I'm really tired of crossword

00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:21.054
puzzles."
Sure, there'd be some new

00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:26.169
particular puzzle you hadn't
seen before, but you'd sort of

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:30.313
step up a level and say,
"Although I haven't seen this

00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:33.292
particular one before,
I've seen crossword puzzles

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:35.833
before.
There's really nothing new

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.967
under the sun here.
The fact that I haven't seen

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:42.438
this particular combination of
words isn't enough to make it

00:02:42.438 --> 00:02:45.190
interesting."
Well, crossword puzzles aren't

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.207
a very deep subject,
and we might wonder whether or

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:51.707
not we would do better if we
were engaged in something more

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:55.910
mentally challenging than that.
This may indicate something

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.069
unusual about me,
but I rather like math.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.729
And the prospect of having a
lot of time to pursue math

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:07.000
problems of a richer and deeper
sort seems fairly attractive.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.757
Yet even there,
when I imagine an eternity of

00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:12.389
thinking about math--or for that
matter,

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.468
an eternity of thinking about
philosophy, which I obviously

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:20.617
like even more than math--the
prospect seems an unattractive

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.253
one.
I can't think of any activity

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:26.462
I'd want to do forever.
Now, of course,

00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:30.099
that's a bit of a cheat because
the claim isn't to spend

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.199
eternity doing math problems and
nothing but math problems.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.150
Right now, with our 50,80,
100 years, we don't fill our

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.930
day doing only one kind of
activity.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.650
We fill our day with a mixture
of activities.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.973
But it doesn't really help
having Thai food for dinner and

00:03:49.973 --> 00:03:53.023
Chinese for lunch.
Or perhaps Chinese on Monday,

00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:55.985
Wednesdays, and Fridays and
Thai on Saturdays and Sundays

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.105
and spending two hours in the
afternoon doing math and three

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.379
hours in the morning doing
philosophy.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.699
That sounds like a pretty
pleasant life.

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.930
But again, if you think of the
possibility of doing that for

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.729
all eternity and never
getting away from it,

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.859
never being free from it,
the positive dream of

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.810
immortality, I think,
becomes a nightmare.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.591
Well again, maybe I'm not just
being creative enough in my

00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:26.935
imagination.
Different former colleague of

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:31.431
mine once talked about the
prospect of having a kind of

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:36.065
heavenly vision of the divine.
Maybe that would be desirable

00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:38.019
forever.
And she described it as,

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:41.613
think of what it's like to have
a really great conversation with

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:44.009
a friend that you wish would
never end,

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.530
except God's this infinitely
rich friend and so the

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.980
conversation ends up seeming
desirable forever.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.225
Well again, I can say the
words, but when I try to imagine

00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:58.279
that possibility and take it
seriously,

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.350
at least speaking personally,
it doesn't--it doesn't hold up.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.261
No friend that I've ever talked
with is one that I actually

00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.410
would want to spend
eternity talking to.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.632
And it's of course possible to
say, well, just imagine a friend

00:05:14.632 --> 00:05:17.439
that you would want to talk
through all eternity to.

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.604
But the whole point is,
I can't imagine what that would

00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:23.257
be like.
When I do my best to imagine

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:27.613
some kind of existence that
would be desirable or attractive

00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:32.279
forever, it just doesn't work.
It becomes a nightmare.

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.332
Well again, maybe what we need
to do is not so much just

00:05:35.332 --> 00:05:38.606
imagine the same cycling going
through week after week after

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:42.682
week, but whole careers.
Maybe you could spend 50 or 100

00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:46.100
years pursuing philosophy as
your career.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.519
And then 50 or 100 years
pursuing math as your career.

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:52.329
And 50 or 100 years traveling
around the world.

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:57.511
And 50 or 100 years being an
artist and working on your water

00:05:57.511 --> 00:06:01.500
colors, or whatever it is.
Well, that certainly seems like

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.779
we could probably get more time
out of that.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:07.445
But again, the crucial point to
remember is that forever is

00:06:07.445 --> 00:06:11.262
literally forever.
There's no life that I'm

00:06:11.262 --> 00:06:15.955
able to imagine for myself
that's one that I would want to

00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:17.520
take on forever.

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:24.713
Well, you might say surely
there could be creatures that

00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:28.350
would want to live
forever, that would enjoy an

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.718
eternal existence.
And I think that's probably

00:06:31.718 --> 00:06:33.635
right.
So scientists have learned how

00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:36.349
to do the following.
There are certain--you can take

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.610
a rat and put an electrode in
his brain.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.956
If you put the electrode in
just the right place,

00:06:40.956 --> 00:06:42.959
then when the electrode gets
turned on,

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:46.269
it stimulates the pleasure
center in the rat's brain and it

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:50.281
gets a little burst of pleasure,
a pretty intense burst of

00:06:50.281 --> 00:06:51.933
pleasure.
And in fact,

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:54.404
you can take the wire,
the electrode,

00:06:54.404 --> 00:06:58.384
and hook it up to a lever and
teach the rat how to push the

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:02.089
lever and give itself a little
burst of pleasure.

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.800
Now, what happens to rats when
you do this?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.595
Well, maybe unsurprisingly,
what they do is,

00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:11.296
they keep pressing the lever.
Indeed, they press the lever

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:14.608
and they'll stop eating,
they're no longer interested in

00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:16.724
sex.
They basically just give

00:07:16.724 --> 00:07:20.608
themselves this little orgasmic
burst of pleasure--well,

00:07:20.608 --> 00:07:23.357
until they die.
Now well, of course,

00:07:23.357 --> 00:07:27.422
it's too bad the rat dies,
but if we imagine the rat not

00:07:27.422 --> 00:07:31.856
being mortal--perhaps you've got
it on IV so it's getting its

00:07:31.856 --> 00:07:36.290
nutrients that way--then perhaps
it's easy to imagine the rat

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.319
simply pressing the lever
forever,

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:44.802
getting this intense burst of
pleasure and being content to do

00:07:44.802 --> 00:07:48.796
that for all eternity.
So if it's so easy to imagine

00:07:48.796 --> 00:07:50.949
that for the rat,
why not for us?

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.119
Why not just put our own
orgasmitron hat on with a

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:57.418
little--not rat lever,
but now human lever--with the

00:07:57.418 --> 00:08:01.040
electrodes stimulating our own
brains so that we get this

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.568
intense burst of pleasure?
And just imagine this intense

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.620
burst of pleasure going on
forever.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.850
What could be more desirable
than that?

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.235
Except, when I think about
that, and I invite you to think

00:08:17.235 --> 00:08:20.264
about that, I don't actually
find that an especially

00:08:20.264 --> 00:08:23.943
attractive prospect.
Mind you, it's not that I think

00:08:23.943 --> 00:08:27.649
we couldn't be stimulated to get
pleasure forever.

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:32.886
It's that there's something
that distinguishes humans from

00:08:32.886 --> 00:08:36.018
rats.
When I--No doubt I would enjoy

00:08:36.018 --> 00:08:38.713
it.
And no doubt you would enjoy it

00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:42.354
for a very long time.
But I imagine that after a

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:46.661
period, there'd be this--Well,
humans have this ability to

00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:51.230
look down on their experiences,
or step back from their

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.241
experiences, and assess them.
Even now, as I'm sitting here

00:08:55.241 --> 00:08:57.367
lecturing to you,
part of me, because of this

00:08:57.367 --> 00:09:00.233
very question that I'm raising,
is thinking about how's the

00:09:00.233 --> 00:09:02.181
lecture going,
and am I going to get through

00:09:02.181 --> 00:09:04.549
what I need to get through,
and so forth and so on.

00:09:04.549 --> 00:09:09.210
We can reflect on our first
order or base level experiences.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:15.259
Now, imagine then that you're
in the pleasure-making machine.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:18.080
After a while,
part of you is going to start

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.769
asking, "Huh,
say, it feels the same as it

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.726
was yesterday,
and the day before that and the

00:09:23.726 --> 00:09:26.018
day before that.
I imagine this is how it's

00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:28.706
going to feel tomorrow,
and the day after that and the

00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:31.750
day after that."
And eventually this question

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.389
would start, "Is this really all
there is to life,

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:37.990
just simple pleasure like
this?"

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.697
The thing about being human is,
unlike the rat,

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:46.210
you're not just going to stay
caught up in the moment.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.948
You're going to take this
meta-level or higher level

00:09:49.948 --> 00:09:53.467
standpoint, look down at the
pleasure and wonder,

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:56.399
"Is this all that there is to
life?"

00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:01.175
And I think eventually that
question would gnaw at you and

00:10:01.175 --> 00:10:06.028
sour and override the pleasure.
Eventually, you'd become

00:10:06.028 --> 00:10:10.205
horrified that you were,
in effect, stuck in this

00:10:10.205 --> 00:10:13.323
rat-like existence.
Of course, the human part of

00:10:13.323 --> 00:10:15.644
you is able to say there's
more to you than this

00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:18.052
rat-like existence.
But precisely,

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:24.426
the human part of you is going
to rebel at the unending parade

00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:29.111
of simple rat-like pleasures.
So, I don't think an eternity

00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:30.870
like that would be such a good
thing.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.759
Maybe it would be for a rat,
but not for a human.

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:38.730
Of course, we could perhaps
deal with that problem by making

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.279
us more rat-like in terms of our
thinking processes.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:46.990
Perhaps the right kind of
lobotomy would do the trick.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.513
I don't actually know exactly
what it would take,

00:10:50.513 --> 00:10:54.771
but you just cut off and snip
the relevant nerve endings so

00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:58.808
that we're no longer able to
engage in that higher order

00:10:58.808 --> 00:11:01.848
thinking.
No longer able to raise the

00:11:01.848 --> 00:11:04.289
question, "Is this all there
is?"

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:10.980
No longer able to step back
from the first order pleasure.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:16.159
No doubt, you can turn us into
creatures like rats in that way.

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:20.644
And then, I presume,
we would continue to enjoy it

00:11:20.644 --> 00:11:23.577
forever.
But the question isn't really,

00:11:23.577 --> 00:11:27.812
is there something you could do
to a human being so that he'd be

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:31.039
happy, or at least enjoying
himself, forever?

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:34.865
It's rather,
do you, sitting here now,

00:11:34.865 --> 00:11:40.345
thinking about that kind of
life, do you want that for

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:43.717
yourself?
Do you want to be lobotomized

00:11:43.717 --> 00:11:47.703
where that's the only way,
at least that we've got so far,

00:11:47.703 --> 00:11:51.200
to imagine a life that you
would enjoy forever.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.201
Sure.
Screw me up enough and maybe

00:11:54.201 --> 00:11:59.018
I'd enjoy being alive forever.
But that doesn't mean that I

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:03.324
now want that for myself.
That doesn't seem to me to be

00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:07.279
some gift you've given me.
That seems to me to be some

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:11.923
horrible penalty you've imposed
on me, that you've reduced me

00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:16.698
from being a human being,
able to engage in the full

00:12:16.698 --> 00:12:21.212
range of reflection,
and simply turned me into

00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:25.899
something like a rat.
So again, when the question is

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:30.687
posed, "Is there a kind of life
that I or you would want to live

00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:33.695
forever?"
the question I'm asking is a

00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:35.789
question to you,
here, now.

00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:39.175
Is there a kind of life that
you would want to live

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.938
forever?
Not that, if we altered you,

00:12:41.938 --> 00:12:45.500
that that product would want to
have forever.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.196
I can't see how to do it.
Well look, there's one other

00:12:50.196 --> 00:12:52.373
possibility.
Instead of imagining

00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:54.600
lobotomizing us,
turning us into rats,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.428
suppose we just say,
look, the problem is really

00:12:57.428 --> 00:12:58.533
this.
The problem,

00:12:58.533 --> 00:13:01.009
of course, is boredom.
The problem is tedium.

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:04.390
The problem is that you get
tired of doing math after a

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.206
while, 100 years,
1,000 years,

00:13:06.206 --> 00:13:08.460
a million years,
whatever it is.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.324
You say, "Yeah,
here's a math problem I haven't

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:13.129
solved before,
but so what?

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:17.340
I've just done so much math,
it holds no appeal to me

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.346
before."
Or, you cycle through all the

00:13:20.346 --> 00:13:24.058
great art museums in the world
and you say, "Yeah,

00:13:24.058 --> 00:13:28.489
I've seen these Picassos.
I've seen these Rembrandts

00:13:28.489 --> 00:13:31.029
before.
I've gotten what there is to

00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:33.490
get out of them.
Isn't there anything new?"

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.379
And the problem is no, no.
We've--even if there's

00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:39.696
literally new things,
they're not the new kinds of

00:13:39.696 --> 00:13:42.539
things that can still engage us
afresh.

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:43.950
Well, what's the solution to
that?

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:49.229
The solution to that might be a
kind of amnesia,

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:53.610
a kind of progressive lack of
memory.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.947
So here I am,
100 years, 1,000 years,

00:13:55.947 --> 00:13:58.740
around 500,000 years,
whatever it may be.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.470
You're getting pretty bored
with life.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.269
But if we now introduce some
progressive memory,

00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:08.391
so--a progressive memory
loss--so that I know longer

00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:12.110
remember what I did 100,000
years earlier.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.078
And by the time I'm a million,
I no longer remember what I was

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:18.419
doing when I was a lad of
500,000.

00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:21.982
And by the time I'm a million
and a half, I no longer remember

00:14:21.982 --> 00:14:24.260
what was happening in oh,
back, back.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.613
I know I was alive, perhaps.
Or maybe I don't even remember

00:14:26.613 --> 00:14:29.560
that I was alive.
I sort of remember the last

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.196
10-20,000 years and that's it.
And while we're at it,

00:14:34.196 --> 00:14:39.389
why don't we have overhauling
of your interests and desires,

00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:42.668
your tastes?
So your tastes in music evolve

00:14:42.668 --> 00:14:46.110
over thousands of years.
And your tastes in art or

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.571
literature.
Or, you like math now but then

00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:51.437
you lose your taste in math,
and you become the kind of

00:14:51.437 --> 00:14:54.250
person perhaps who's interested
in Chinese poetry,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.710
whatever it is.
Wouldn't that do it?

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.668
If we had this sort of
progressive all-radical

00:15:00.668 --> 00:15:03.429
alteration, not just minimal
alteration,

00:15:03.429 --> 00:15:07.763
but radical alterations of my
memory, my beliefs,

00:15:07.763 --> 00:15:11.434
my desires, my tastes.
Couldn't that be a kind of

00:15:11.434 --> 00:15:15.080
existence that would be forever
enjoyable and yet it wouldn't be

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.682
a rat-like existence?
I'd be engaged in studying

00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:23.230
Chinese poetry.
I'd be engaged in doing math.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.210
I'd be engaged in studying
astronomy, what have you.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.470
That's far better than the
rat's existence.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.264
And yet, at no point do I
become bored,

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:35.795
because, roughly,
I'm so different from period to

00:15:35.795 --> 00:15:38.830
period to period.
Well, I think actually,

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.135
you probably could tell a story
where that was true,

00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:45.830
especially if we throw in
enough doses of memory loss.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.677
But this case should remind you
of something,

00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:52.560
because this case is one that
we've actually discussed before

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.019
under the label of "Methuselah."
Methuselah, remember,

00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:58.709
when we talked about personal
identity, we imagined

00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:01.129
somebody--much shorter-lived at
that time.

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:05.709
I think it was several hundred
years, a hundred years old,

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:07.959
200 years old,
300 years old,

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:12.834
600,700, 800,900 years old.
By the time Methuselah was 900

00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:16.966
years old, he no longer
remembered anything about his

00:16:16.966 --> 00:16:20.547
childhood.
What I found when I thought

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:26.019
about the Methuselah case was,
even though it was me at age

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:28.406
800,
the same person as the one

00:16:28.406 --> 00:16:32.125
who's standing here in front of
you now, it didn't really

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:35.039
matter.
I said, "So what?"

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:38.788
When I thought about what I
wanted in survival,

00:16:38.788 --> 00:16:43.677
it wasn't enough that there be
somebody in the distant future

00:16:43.677 --> 00:16:46.009
that be me.
That wasn't good enough.

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:51.151
It had to be somebody with a
similar enough

00:16:51.151 --> 00:16:53.033
personality.
You tell me,

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:54.409
"Oh there's going to be
somebody alive.

00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:57.674
It'll be you,
but it'll be completely unlike

00:16:57.674 --> 00:16:59.072
you.
Different tastes,

00:16:59.072 --> 00:17:02.120
no memories of having taught
philosophy and so forth."

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.241
I say, that's all rather
interesting from a metaphysical

00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:07.397
point of view,
but speaking personally,

00:17:07.397 --> 00:17:11.022
I don't really care.
It's of no interest to me to

00:17:11.022 --> 00:17:15.467
survive, and merely saying the
mantra, "Oh, but it's me"

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:18.700
doesn't make it more desirable
to me.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.589
What I want isn't merely for
somebody to be me.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:25.349
I want them to be sufficiently
like me.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.972
And the problem with the
Methuselah case was,

00:17:27.972 --> 00:17:30.654
go far enough out,
it's no longer sufficiently

00:17:30.654 --> 00:17:33.647
like me.
So I don't really care that

00:17:33.647 --> 00:17:37.444
there'll be somebody out there
who's still me,

00:17:37.444 --> 00:17:41.703
if they're so unlike me now.
But that's, after all,

00:17:41.703 --> 00:17:45.810
what we've just described,
in imagining the cycling with

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.971
the memory loss.
Yeah, there'll be somebody

00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:52.521
around 100,000 years from now,
500,000 years from now,

00:17:52.521 --> 00:17:55.859
and maybe they'll be me.
I don't care.

00:17:55.859 --> 00:18:01.269
It doesn't give me what I
want when I want to

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:04.336
survive.
So perhaps we should put the

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:09.058
point in the form of a dilemma.
Could immortality be something

00:18:09.058 --> 00:18:12.907
worth having forever?
Well, on the one hand,

00:18:12.907 --> 00:18:17.044
if we make it be me and
similar to me,

00:18:17.044 --> 00:18:21.422
boredom's going to set in.
The only way to avoid that is

00:18:21.422 --> 00:18:23.930
to lobotomize me,
and that's not desirable.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.882
If we make--If we solve the
problem of boredom setting in

00:18:27.882 --> 00:18:32.329
with progressive memory loss and
radical personality changes,

00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:36.762
maybe boredom won't set in,
but it's not anything that I

00:18:36.762 --> 00:18:40.545
especially want for myself.
It just doesn't matter to me

00:18:40.545 --> 00:18:42.816
that it's me,
anymore than it would matter to

00:18:42.816 --> 00:18:46.123
me if they just tell me,
"Oh, there'll be somebody else

00:18:46.123 --> 00:18:48.930
around there who will like
Chinese poetry."

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:54.640
So, is there a way of living
forever that's attractive to me?

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.640
I can't think of what it would
look like.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.123
So, I agree with Bernard
Williams when he says

00:19:01.123 --> 00:19:03.910
immortality wouldn't be
desirable.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:08.121
It would actually be a
nightmare, something you would

00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:12.285
long to free yourself from.
Now, having said that,

00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:17.317
of course, that doesn't in any
way mean that it's a good thing

00:19:17.317 --> 00:19:21.029
that we die when we do at 50 or
80 or 100.

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:25.156
From the fact that after
100,000 years or a million years

00:19:25.156 --> 00:19:28.445
or whatever it is,
eventually life would grow

00:19:28.445 --> 00:19:32.914
tiresome, that hardly shows that
life has grown tiresome after 50

00:19:32.914 --> 00:19:35.907
years or 80 years or 100.
I don't believe

00:19:35.907 --> 00:19:39.917
we'll--I'll--come close to
scratching the surface of what I

00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:42.960
would enjoy doing,
by the time I've died.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.410
And I imagine the same thing is
true for you.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.660
So perhaps the best form of
life would be not immortality;

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.450
I think that would be not
particularly desirable.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.600
And not what we've got now,
where you live after a mere

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.525
drop of 50 or 80 or 100 years.
But rather, the best thing I

00:20:03.525 --> 00:20:08.720
suppose would be to be able to
live as long as you wanted.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.583
This is the sort of thing that
Julian Barnes basically imagines

00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:16.259
in the chapter "The Dream" that
I had you take a look at.

00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:21.016
Barnes envisions heaven as a
situation which you can stick

00:20:21.016 --> 00:20:26.105
around doing what you want to do
for as long as you want to do

00:20:26.105 --> 00:20:27.864
it.
But Barnes says,

00:20:27.864 --> 00:20:32.075
eventually you'll have enough.
And once you've had enough,

00:20:32.075 --> 00:20:35.618
you can put an end to it.
Still--the fact that we can put

00:20:35.618 --> 00:20:37.947
an end to it,
that's the point we've already

00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:40.276
been flagging,
that immortality would not be

00:20:40.276 --> 00:20:43.545
so good.
But the new thought here is

00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:48.769
what would be good would be
being able to live until you

00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:52.447
were satisfied,
until you'd gotten what goods

00:20:52.447 --> 00:20:54.550
there were to get out of life.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.564
What all this suggests,
then, and this is a point that

00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:04.431
I really made before,
is that the best understanding

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:07.496
of the deprivation account
doesn't say that what's bad is

00:21:07.496 --> 00:21:09.740
the mere fact that we're going
to die.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.103
If I'm right in thinking
immortality would be

00:21:12.103 --> 00:21:15.380
undesirable, then the fact that
we're going to die is good,

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.748
because it guarantees that we
won't be immortal,

00:21:17.748 --> 00:21:21.900
which would be a nightmare,
an unending nightmare.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.650
Still, even though it's not a
bad thing that we will die,

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:31.910
it could still be a bad thing
that we die when we do.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:37.680
It could still be the case that
we die too soon.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.493
According to the deprivaton
account, death is bad,

00:21:41.493 --> 00:21:44.683
when it's bad,
because of the fact that it

00:21:44.683 --> 00:21:48.029
deprives us of the good things
in life,

00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:51.800
insofar as we would have
continued to get good things in

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.932
life.
But if life would no longer

00:21:53.932 --> 00:21:57.788
have anything good to offer you,
if what you then would have had

00:21:57.788 --> 00:22:01.093
would have been something
negative instead of something

00:22:01.093 --> 00:22:03.286
positive,
then at that point,

00:22:03.286 --> 00:22:06.100
dying wouldn't actually be a
bad thing.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.432
It would be a good thing.
Death is bad insofar as it

00:22:10.432 --> 00:22:16.180
deprives you of a chunk of life
that would have been good.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:21.274
Insofar as it deprives you of a
future that would have been bad,

00:22:21.274 --> 00:22:25.480
then death's not actually bad,
it's actually good.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.327
Now, in stating this view this
way, I'm obviously presupposing

00:22:30.327 --> 00:22:35.071
that we can make these kinds of,
at least, overall judgments in

00:22:35.071 --> 00:22:38.950
terms of the quality of your
life, how well off you are.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:42.206
Is life giving you good things,
or is life giving you bad

00:22:42.206 --> 00:22:45.608
things?
Is it worth continuing to live,

00:22:45.608 --> 00:22:49.230
or is it not worth continuing
to live?

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.211
So, I want to turn to that
topic and spend oh,

00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:55.259
probably the better part of a
lecture or so.

00:22:55.259 --> 00:22:59.199
The rest of today and some of
next time talking about the

00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:02.645
question of, well,
what is it for a life to

00:23:02.645 --> 00:23:06.521
go well?
How do we assess what makes a

00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:10.390
life--a good life versus a bad
life?

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.440
And I don't mean morally good
life.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.269
I mean, good for the
person whose life it is.

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:21.162
A life that you think,
"I'm benefiting from having

00:23:21.162 --> 00:23:24.123
this life."
What are the ingredients or

00:23:24.123 --> 00:23:27.759
constituents or elements of a
good life versus a bad life?

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:29.943
And of course,
since it's not just black and

00:23:29.943 --> 00:23:32.940
white, good life or bad life,
but various shades of gray,

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.824
better lives and worse lives,
what's the yardstick by virtue

00:23:37.824 --> 00:23:41.550
of which we measure better and
worse lives?

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.664
What goes into a good life?
Now, in thinking about this

00:23:44.664 --> 00:23:47.984
question, this is--you might
think of the topic as the nature

00:23:47.984 --> 00:23:50.443
of wellbeing.
And like all the other topics

00:23:50.443 --> 00:23:53.210
we've talked about in this
class, it's a complicated

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.519
subject, about which one could
spend a great deal of time.

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:59.431
All we're going to do here is
really just, once again,

00:23:59.431 --> 00:24:02.906
scratch the surface.
But the very first point that

00:24:02.906 --> 00:24:05.720
needs to be made,
I think, is this.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.801
If you start listing all the
things worth having in life,

00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:13.882
it might seem as though you
couldn't possibly come to any

00:24:13.882 --> 00:24:17.080
general organizing principles.
Think about it.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.473
What's worth having?
Well yeah, jobs are worth

00:24:19.473 --> 00:24:20.930
having.
Money's worth having.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.940
Sex is worth having.
Chocolate's worth having.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.410
Ice cream's worth having.
Air conditioners are worth

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.172
having.
What are some of the things

00:24:27.172 --> 00:24:29.199
worth avoiding?
Well, being blind is worth

00:24:29.199 --> 00:24:32.890
avoiding.
Being mugged is worth avoiding.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.089
Diarrhea is worth avoiding.
Pain's worth avoiding.

00:24:36.089 --> 00:24:37.680
Getting unemployed is worth
avoiding.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.714
War is worth avoiding.
What kind of systematicity

00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:45.460
could we possibly bring to all
of this?

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.523
Well, the crucial,
I think, first distinction is

00:24:48.523 --> 00:24:51.451
this.
We need to separate between

00:24:51.451 --> 00:24:56.670
those things that are good
because of what they lead to.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.646
That is, more strictly,
only because of what

00:24:59.646 --> 00:25:02.076
they lead to.
And those things that are

00:25:02.076 --> 00:25:05.210
valuable for their own sake or
in their own right.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.360
Take something like a job.
A job's worth having.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.528
Why is a job worth having?
Well, a job's worth having

00:25:10.528 --> 00:25:12.023
because, well,
among other things,

00:25:12.023 --> 00:25:13.530
it gives you money.
All right.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.000
Money's worth having.
All right.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.708
Why is money worth having?
Well, money's worth having

00:25:18.708 --> 00:25:21.960
because, among other things,
you can buy ice cream with it.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.839
All right.
Why is ice cream worth having?

00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:28.709
Well, ice cream's worth having
because when I eat ice cream it

00:25:28.709 --> 00:25:31.120
gives me this pleasurable
sensation.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.686
All right.
Why is the pleasurable

00:25:33.686 --> 00:25:36.190
sensation worth having?
At this point,

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:37.740
we get a different kind of
answer.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.669
At this point,
we say something like,

00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:44.250
pleasure is worth having for
its own sake.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.000
The other things were valuable
as a means, ultimately to

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.837
pleasure.
But pleasure is worth having

00:25:50.837 --> 00:25:54.785
for its own sake.
The things that are valuable as

00:25:54.785 --> 00:25:58.819
a means we can say are
instrumentally valuable.

00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:03.632
The things that are worth
having for their own sake,

00:26:03.632 --> 00:26:07.690
philosophers call intrinsically
valuable.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.827
If we look back at that long,
open-ended list of things that

00:26:11.827 --> 00:26:15.233
were good or bad,
we'll find that most of the

00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:18.690
things on that list are
instrumentally good.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.089
They're good because of what
they lead to.

00:26:21.089 --> 00:26:23.430
Or, for that matter,
instrumentally bad.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:27.678
Why is disease bad?
Well, among other things,

00:26:27.678 --> 00:26:30.000
it means perhaps that you can't
enjoy yourself.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.005
So it deprives you of pleasure.
Or perhaps it means because

00:26:33.005 --> 00:26:34.670
you're sick, you can't hold your
job down.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.911
If you can't hold your job
down, you can't get the money

00:26:36.911 --> 00:26:39.572
and so forth and so on.
Ultimately, most of the

00:26:39.572 --> 00:26:43.430
negative things on that list
were instrumentally bad.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:48.440
Most of the good things on that
list were instrumentally good.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.646
If we want to get anyplace on
the question about the nature of

00:26:52.646 --> 00:26:56.132
the good life,
what we need to focus on is not

00:26:56.132 --> 00:27:00.897
the instrumental goods and bads,
but rather the intrinsic goods

00:27:00.897 --> 00:27:04.196
and bads.
You've got to ask yourself,

00:27:04.196 --> 00:27:07.630
"What's worth having for its
own sake?

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:12.500
What's worth having in and of
itself?"

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.172
Well, one natural suggestion is
that pleasure is worth having

00:27:16.172 --> 00:27:19.784
for its own sake and pain is
probably worth avoiding for its

00:27:19.784 --> 00:27:21.864
own sake.
So pain's probably

00:27:21.864 --> 00:27:26.259
intrinsically bad;
pleasure is intrinsically good.

00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:29.933
Notice by the by that logically
speaking, there is nothing that

00:27:29.933 --> 00:27:32.539
stops the very same thing from
being both.

00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:35.009
And actually you can get other
weird combinations.

00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:38.020
You go to the dentist and he
pokes you.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.599
He says, "Does this hurt?
Does that hurt?"

00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:41.890
in order to try to figure out
where there's gum disease.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.990
And the pain that he causes is
intrinsically bad.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.655
In and of itself it's bad.
Yet, for all that,

00:27:49.655 --> 00:27:53.703
it's being useful there.
It's providing a means of

00:27:53.703 --> 00:27:57.019
deciding where the gum has
decayed.

00:27:57.019 --> 00:28:00.528
And that allows the dentist to
improve your gums,

00:28:00.528 --> 00:28:03.380
which avoids more pain down the
road.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.623
So the pain you're suffering
now is actually

00:28:06.623 --> 00:28:10.319
instrumentally valuable,
useful as a means,

00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:13.789
even though it's
intrinsically bad.

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:20.329
Similarly, when I work,
I enjoy myself.

00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:24.750
And so the pleasure I'm getting
then is intrinsically good.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.329
But it's also instrumentally
good.

00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:30.204
The fact that I'm enjoying
myself makes it easier for me to

00:28:30.204 --> 00:28:32.682
work harder.
Perhaps I'm more productive,

00:28:32.682 --> 00:28:35.958
I do better at my job.
So the pleasure is both

00:28:35.958 --> 00:28:40.500
intrinsically valuable and
instrumentally valuable.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.900
So there's no claiming that
things have to be one or the

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.222
other, but not both.
Still, in trying to get clear

00:28:47.222 --> 00:28:51.215
about the nature of wellbeing,
the crucial thing to do is to

00:28:51.215 --> 00:28:54.869
focus not on the question about
instrumental value,

00:28:54.869 --> 00:28:59.319
but rather to focus on the
question of intrinsic value.

00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:04.289
What things are worth having
for their own sake,

00:29:04.289 --> 00:29:10.209
whether or not those things
also have instrumental value,

00:29:10.209 --> 00:29:13.917
or what have you?
What things are worth having

00:29:13.917 --> 00:29:16.893
for their own sake and what
things are worth avoiding for

00:29:16.893 --> 00:29:19.518
their own sake?
Well, in giving these examples,

00:29:19.518 --> 00:29:22.749
I've already indicated at least
two things that belong on the

00:29:22.749 --> 00:29:25.975
list.
It seems pretty plausible to

00:29:25.975 --> 00:29:29.769
think pleasure is intrinsically
good.

00:29:29.769 --> 00:29:34.399
One thing, maybe not the only
thing, but at least one thing,

00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:38.244
that goes into a life worth
having is enjoying it,

00:29:38.244 --> 00:29:41.133
is pleasure.
And one thing that seems

00:29:41.133 --> 00:29:44.401
intrinsically bad,
one thing that seems to reduce

00:29:44.401 --> 00:29:46.579
the value of a life,
is pain.

00:29:46.579 --> 00:29:48.832
Most of us agree then,
pleasure is intrinsically

00:29:48.832 --> 00:29:53.495
valuable;
pain is intrinsically negative,

00:29:53.495 --> 00:29:59.857
unvaluable, has anti-value.
Well, suppose we make for,

00:29:59.857 --> 00:30:04.810
the moment, the bold
conjecture, the philosophical

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.555
claim,
that not only is pleasure and

00:30:07.555 --> 00:30:10.784
the absence of pain,
not only is pleasure one

00:30:10.784 --> 00:30:13.570
good thing and pain one
bad thing.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:19.403
Suppose that's the entire list.
Suppose we conjecture that the

00:30:19.403 --> 00:30:24.799
only thing intrinsically
valuable is pleasure and the

00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:28.950
only thing intrinsically bad is
pain.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:36.011
That view is called hedonism.
So hedonism is a view that many

00:30:36.011 --> 00:30:38.680
people are attracted to,
perhaps some of you believe.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.650
It's got a very simple theory
of the nature of wellbeing.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:48.552
Being well off is a matter of
experiencing pleasure and

00:30:48.552 --> 00:30:52.910
avoiding or minimizing the
experience of pain.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:57.619
That's hedonism.
A little later we'll turn to

00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:01.075
the question of,
well, if hedonism is not the

00:31:01.075 --> 00:31:05.866
right story, what else belongs
on the list, or is it the right

00:31:05.866 --> 00:31:07.661
story?
We'll turn to that question a

00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:09.986
little bit later.
But notice that if we've got

00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:13.791
hedonism or, for that matter as
we'll see, some other theories

00:31:13.791 --> 00:31:16.520
of wellbeing,
if we've got hedonism,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.317
we're able to make the kinds of
evaluations that I was helping

00:31:21.317 --> 00:31:26.430
myself to when I started talking
a few minutes ago about well,

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.974
you know, if what life would
hold for you is bad overall,

00:31:29.974 --> 00:31:32.759
then you're better off dying
and so forth.

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:34.859
What's going on when we make
those judgments?

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:40.534
Well, the hedonist offers us a
very simple straightforward

00:31:40.534 --> 00:31:44.240
answer.
In deciding whether what life

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:49.279
holds for you is worth having,
better than nothing,

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:55.242
you, roughly speaking,
add up all the good times and

00:31:55.242 --> 00:32:02.257
subtract all the bad times and
see whether the net balance is

00:32:02.257 --> 00:32:07.026
positive or negative.
Add up all the pleasures,

00:32:07.026 --> 00:32:11.174
subtract all the pains.
If the balance is positive,

00:32:11.174 --> 00:32:15.410
your life is worth living.
And the more positive the

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.725
balance, the bigger the number,
the more your life is worth

00:32:19.725 --> 00:32:21.659
living.
If the balance is negative

00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:23.579
though, think about what that
would mean.

00:32:23.579 --> 00:32:29.689
If the balance was negative,
you're saying your future holds

00:32:29.689 --> 00:32:35.660
more pain overall than pleasure.
And that's a negative.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.598
You'd be better off,
well, you'd be better off dead,

00:32:38.598 --> 00:32:40.567
right?
Because if you were dead,

00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:42.859
you'd have neither pleasure nor
pain.

00:32:42.859 --> 00:32:46.121
That's going to presumably be
given--mathematically if we gave

00:32:46.121 --> 00:32:48.259
it a number, we'd slap a zero on
that.

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:50.220
No positive number,
no negative number.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.072
That's a zero.
Obviously, if the balance of

00:32:53.072 --> 00:32:56.700
pleasure over pain is positive,
that's better than zero.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.217
But if the balance of pain over
pleasure--If there's more pain

00:33:00.217 --> 00:33:02.812
than pleasure so that the
balance is negative,

00:33:02.812 --> 00:33:07.320
that's worse than zero.
That's a life not worth having.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.348
That's what the hedonist says.
Now, there's different ways of

00:33:11.348 --> 00:33:13.769
working out the details of the
hedonist view.

00:33:13.769 --> 00:33:17.604
It's not, after all,
as though all pleasures count

00:33:17.604 --> 00:33:20.500
equally or all pains count
equally.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.917
The pain of stubbing your toe
obviously doesn't count for

00:33:24.917 --> 00:33:28.309
nearly as much as the pain of a
migraine,

00:33:28.309 --> 00:33:32.140
which doesn't count nearly as
the pain of being tortured.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.621
And so we might need to work
out various, more complicated,

00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:39.711
formulas here,
where we multiply the pain

00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:44.269
times its duration and take into
account its intensity,

00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:46.990
get the sheer quantity
of pain that way.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.684
And similarly,
pleasures can be longer

00:33:50.684 --> 00:33:54.639
lasting, or more intense.
You can imagine how some of

00:33:54.639 --> 00:33:57.110
those details might go,
and then some of the questions

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.662
get rather tricky.
But for our purposes,

00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:03.329
we don't really need to worry
about the details.

00:34:03.329 --> 00:34:06.073
The thought is,
roughly, weigh up the pleasures

00:34:06.073 --> 00:34:08.220
and pains in some appropriate
way.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.630
Add up the pleasures.
Add up the pains.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.932
See whether the grand total of
pleasures is greater than the

00:34:14.932 --> 00:34:18.278
grand totals of pain.
The more positive the number,

00:34:18.278 --> 00:34:22.254
the better your life.
Now, armed with an approach

00:34:22.254 --> 00:34:27.530
like this, we can do more than
just evaluate entire lives.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.200
Well, one thing we can do is
just that.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.880
We can evaluate entire lives.
There you are at the pearly

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.309
gates and you look back on your
life and you could,

00:34:37.309 --> 00:34:39.502
in principle,
add up all the pleasures,

00:34:39.502 --> 00:34:42.271
add up all the pains,
subtract the pains from the

00:34:42.271 --> 00:34:47.050
pleasures and ask yourself,
"How good a life did I have?

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:51.050
How well off was I,
having lived that life?"

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.409
And perhaps then you could
imagine alternative lives.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:59.157
If only I had chosen to become
a doctor, instead of having

00:34:59.157 --> 00:35:03.697
chosen to become a lawyer.
How much better off or worse

00:35:03.697 --> 00:35:07.557
off would I have been?
Or if I decided to become an

00:35:07.557 --> 00:35:10.921
artist or a scholar or a beach
bum or a farmer,

00:35:10.921 --> 00:35:14.869
how much better off or worse
off would I have been?

00:35:14.869 --> 00:35:19.900
How much greater or smaller
would the number go?

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.561
Despite my talking about
numbers, of course,

00:35:22.561 --> 00:35:25.657
there's no particular
assumption that we can really

00:35:25.657 --> 00:35:29.753
give precise numbers to this.
And we certainly don't think

00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:34.153
that in fact most of us are in
the position to actually crank

00:35:34.153 --> 00:35:39.317
out any kind of accurate number.
Most of us don't know enough to

00:35:39.317 --> 00:35:44.009
know with a high degree of
accuracy how things would have

00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:49.539
gone had I decided to become a
farmer instead of a philosopher.

00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:52.947
Still, the hedonist isn't
saying from a practical point of

00:35:52.947 --> 00:35:56.151
view we can necessarily do this.
But in theory,

00:35:56.151 --> 00:35:59.580
in principle,
this is what we're wondering

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.512
about when we face choices.
We can ask ourselves,

00:36:03.512 --> 00:36:06.760
"What would our life look like?
Would it be better or worse?"

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.410
And the yardstick that we're at
least doing our best to apply is

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:15.840
one of measuring up the pleasure
and subtracting the pain.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.269
And of course,
the hedonist will also hasten

00:36:18.269 --> 00:36:21.602
to point out that just because
we can't do this perfectly or

00:36:21.602 --> 00:36:24.160
infallibly,
that doesn't mean we can't make

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.539
educated guesses,
right?

00:36:25.539 --> 00:36:31.126
You're trying to decide should
you go to Yale for college or

00:36:31.126 --> 00:36:36.997
should you go to Ohio State or
Harvard or wherever else you got

00:36:36.997 --> 00:36:39.308
into,
and you ask yourself,

00:36:39.308 --> 00:36:42.641
well, you try to project your
future and you ask,

00:36:42.641 --> 00:36:45.349
"Where do I think I'd be better
off?

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:48.487
Which of these branches that
are available to me,

00:36:48.487 --> 00:36:53.214
the branches of my life story,
which is the one in which the

00:36:53.214 --> 00:36:58.392
future from here on out holds
more pleasure and holds less

00:36:58.392 --> 00:37:00.461
pain?"
That's how the hedonist says we

00:37:00.461 --> 00:37:02.744
should think about it.
And notice by the by,

00:37:02.744 --> 00:37:06.613
that when we make choices about
our future, from the hedonist

00:37:06.613 --> 00:37:09.563
point of view,
at least, there's no particular

00:37:09.563 --> 00:37:13.151
need to dwell a whole lot on the
past, because what's done is

00:37:13.151 --> 00:37:15.779
done.
You're not going to alter how

00:37:15.779 --> 00:37:19.782
much pleasur you enjoyed
previously, how much suffering

00:37:19.782 --> 00:37:24.099
you've undergone previously.
What's open is the future.

00:37:24.099 --> 00:37:27.993
And so we're able to evaluate
not just lives as a whole,

00:37:27.993 --> 00:37:30.400
looking back at the pearly
gate.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.849
We're able to evaluate lives
from here on out.

00:37:35.849 --> 00:37:40.746
Which of the various futures
that are open to me are likely

00:37:40.746 --> 00:37:44.714
to give me the better life,
leave me better off,

00:37:44.714 --> 00:37:48.260
measured in terms of pleasure
or pain?

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.649
And we do our best,
however good or bad that may

00:37:51.649 --> 00:37:54.710
be.
We do our best to make such

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:58.217
comparative evaluations.
And of course,

00:37:58.217 --> 00:38:02.104
we can do more than just
evaluate the entire rest of my

00:38:02.104 --> 00:38:04.634
life.
We can evaluate the next year

00:38:04.634 --> 00:38:07.464
or the next six months or,
for that matter,

00:38:07.464 --> 00:38:09.719
just this evening.
I can talk about,

00:38:09.719 --> 00:38:13.557
well, what should I do tonight?
Should I stay home and work on

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:16.230
my paper?
Should I go to the party?

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.639
Where will I be better off
tonight?

00:38:19.639 --> 00:38:22.199
Well, I'll probably enjoy
myself more at the party than I

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:25.225
will working on the paper.
And the paper's not due for a

00:38:25.225 --> 00:38:31.106
while and so forth.
We make evaluations not just of

00:38:31.106 --> 00:38:36.840
entire lives,
but of chunks of lives.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.249
All right.
That's what we can do if we

00:38:40.249 --> 00:38:43.738
accept hedonism.
But haven't yet asked,

00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:46.719
should we accept
hedonism?

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:50.954
Now, it will not come as news
to me if I were to learn that

00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:53.728
several of you,
maybe even many of you,

00:38:53.728 --> 00:38:59.139
in this class accept hedonism.
It's a very popular view.

00:38:59.139 --> 00:39:02.347
Not just among philosophers
where it's a view that's been

00:39:02.347 --> 00:39:05.840
around as long as there's been
philosophy, but among people in

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.119
the street.
It's a very tempting view to

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:14.217
think, what makes life worth
having and the only thing worth

00:39:14.217 --> 00:39:18.879
having for its own sake,
is having pleasure and avoiding

00:39:18.879 --> 00:39:20.630
pain.
But for all that,

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:25.219
despite the popularity of that
view, I'm inclined to think it

00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:28.216
must be wrong.
It's not that I think pleasure

00:39:28.216 --> 00:39:32.510
isn't good and pain isn't bad.
Where hedonism goes wrong is

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:37.500
when they say it's the
only thing that matters.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.245
I'm inclined to think there's
more to the best kind of life

00:39:42.245 --> 00:39:46.010
than just having pleasure and
avoiding pain.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:51.991
Now, I already revealed that,
when I was talking about the

00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:56.151
rat lever machine.
I said, hook me up to that

00:39:56.151 --> 00:40:00.920
machine and I'll enjoy myself.
But I don't want that for

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.219
myself.
Why?

00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:07.208
Because there's more to
life than just pleasure and the

00:40:07.208 --> 00:40:10.480
absence of pain,
or so it seems to me.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.417
Still, we might say,
but the rat lever is not the

00:40:13.417 --> 00:40:15.559
only kind of pleasures there
are.

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:20.355
There's all these pleasures of
experiencing art and seeing a

00:40:20.355 --> 00:40:23.314
beautiful sunset.
And I don't know about you,

00:40:23.314 --> 00:40:25.776
but at least when I imagine the
rat lever thing,

00:40:25.776 --> 00:40:28.500
it's a sort of simple,
undifferentiated pleasure.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.261
So, that really won't do the
trick in giving us the best

00:40:33.261 --> 00:40:38.195
quality pleasures of the kinds
that humans most crave--the

00:40:38.195 --> 00:40:43.650
pleasures of friendship and
discussion and sexual intimacy.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.650
These pleasures the rat lever
machine wasn't giving us.

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:49.889
So couldn't hedonism still be
true?

00:40:49.889 --> 00:40:52.801
Couldn't it still be the case
that as long as we take into

00:40:52.801 --> 00:40:55.611
account the importance of
getting the right kinds

00:40:55.611 --> 00:40:57.694
of pleasures,
then really pleasure is what

00:40:57.694 --> 00:40:59.429
it's all about and all that it's
about?

00:40:59.429 --> 00:41:01.349
No, I think that's still not
right.

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:05.502
But indeed, we'll need to move
to something fancier than the

00:41:05.502 --> 00:41:08.715
rat lever machine.
Here, the relevant thought

00:41:08.715 --> 00:41:11.562
experiment was suggested by
Robert Nozick,

00:41:11.562 --> 00:41:15.728
a philosopher who died a few
years ago, taught for many years

00:41:15.728 --> 00:41:20.511
at Harvard.
Nozick invited us to imagine an

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:24.652
experience machine.
So, suppose that the scientists

00:41:24.652 --> 00:41:27.910
have discovered a way not just
to stimulate the particular

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.139
little pleasure center of the
brain,

00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:37.299
but basically to--give you
basically, completely realistic

00:41:37.299 --> 00:41:42.397
virtual reality.
So that when you are hooked up

00:41:42.397 --> 00:41:46.369
to the machine,
it seems to you exactly the

00:41:46.369 --> 00:41:51.570
same on the inside as it would
seem to you if you really

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:57.982
were--and now fill in the blank.
You could have the identical

00:41:57.982 --> 00:42:02.872
experience of climbing Mount
Everest, let's say,

00:42:02.872 --> 00:42:07.449
so that you'll feel the wind
bracing you.

00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:09.190
Of course, you won't really
feel any wind.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.418
Strictly speaking,
that's not true,

00:42:10.418 --> 00:42:11.900
because you're not up on Mount
Everest.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.543
There is no wind.
What's really going on is

00:42:14.543 --> 00:42:18.547
you're floating in the
psychologist's tank in their lab

00:42:18.547 --> 00:42:21.809
with the electrodes hooked up
your brain.

00:42:21.809 --> 00:42:26.650
But you don't know that you are
floating in the tank.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:32.334
Hooked up to the machine,
you believe you are climbing

00:42:32.334 --> 00:42:36.522
Mount Everest.
You feel the thrill of having

00:42:36.522 --> 00:42:41.893
made it to the top and the wind
bracingly striking your chin and

00:42:41.893 --> 00:42:46.582
you feel the satisfaction and
you've got the memories of

00:42:46.582 --> 00:42:50.930
having almost died when the rope
broke before.

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:56.614
It's not like being at the IMAX.
The crucial point,

00:42:56.614 --> 00:43:00.141
when you're at the IMAX is,
although it's very realistic,

00:43:00.141 --> 00:43:03.670
part of you is aware that
you're just in the theatre.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:09.441
But on the experience machine,
you don't know you're just in

00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:12.703
the lab.
When you're on the experience

00:43:12.703 --> 00:43:17.428
machine, you've got--your brain
is being stimulated in such a

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:21.365
way that you've got the
identical experience on the

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:25.932
inside to what it would feel
like if you really were

00:43:25.932 --> 00:43:29.768
doing these things.
So, imagine a life on the

00:43:29.768 --> 00:43:34.190
experience machine.
Imagine plugging in the tape.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.768
Says something about how old
this example is that we talk

00:43:36.768 --> 00:43:41.220
about plugging in the tapes.
Imagine plugging in the DVD,

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:46.375
or whatever it is,
with all of the best possible

00:43:46.375 --> 00:43:49.530
experiences.
Whatever you think those are.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.405
Here, you might imagine
different people disagreeing

00:43:52.405 --> 00:43:55.449
about--oh, but throw in
something--but if what you want

00:43:55.449 --> 00:43:57.929
to do is write the great
American novel,

00:43:57.929 --> 00:44:01.747
then you've got the experience
of staying up late at night not

00:44:01.747 --> 00:44:04.250
knowing how to make the plot
work out,

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:08.269
crushing pieces of paper and
throwing them away.

00:44:08.269 --> 00:44:09.971
Crushing your computer,
or whatever it is that you do

00:44:09.971 --> 00:44:11.280
as you write the great American
novel.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.690
Or you want to be finding the
cure for cancer.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:18.013
So you've got exactly the
experience you would have if you

00:44:18.013 --> 00:44:21.628
were working in your lab having
the brilliant breakthrough when

00:44:21.628 --> 00:44:25.009
you finally realize what the
combination is that would make

00:44:25.009 --> 00:44:27.400
the right antibody,
whatever it is.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:32.719
Or if you want to be observing
all the most beautiful sunsets

00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:37.331
and the most exotic locales,
you've got exactly the

00:44:37.331 --> 00:44:42.829
experience you would have if you
were doing all these things.

00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:45.619
That's life on the experience
machine.

00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:47.130
You're not doing any of
it.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.801
You're floating in the lab.
But the experiences are

00:44:50.801 --> 00:44:54.996
identical.
Now, ask yourself then,

00:44:54.996 --> 00:45:02.917
would you want to spend your
life hooked up to the experience

00:45:02.917 --> 00:45:05.475
machine?
Ask yourself,

00:45:05.475 --> 00:45:09.557
how would you feel if you
discovered now that you

00:45:09.557 --> 00:45:14.574
have been living your
life hooked up to an experience

00:45:14.574 --> 00:45:17.259
machine?
Now, I've got to make a

00:45:17.259 --> 00:45:20.364
footnote here.
This perfectly glorious

00:45:20.364 --> 00:45:25.685
philosophical example has been
ruined in recent years by the

00:45:25.685 --> 00:45:29.751
movie The Matrix.
Because whenever I tell this

00:45:29.751 --> 00:45:33.362
story now, people start saying,
"Oh, well the evil machines are

00:45:33.362 --> 00:45:36.566
busy using your body as a
battery" or whatever it was in

00:45:36.566 --> 00:45:37.849
the movie,
right?

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:40.523
And "What if people are
nefariously feasting on my liver

00:45:40.523 --> 00:45:42.710
while I'm having these little
experiences?"

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:48.211
Don't imagine any of that.
It's not that the evil

00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:53.071
scientist is just deliberately
deceiving you so as to conduct

00:45:53.071 --> 00:45:56.900
his nefarious experiments.
Nothing like that.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.216
And similarly,
while we're at it--this is not

00:45:59.216 --> 00:46:02.059
a Matrix-like worry--if
you're worried about,

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:04.629
yeah, but what's happening to
world poverty while I'm doing

00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:07.629
all of this?
Just imagine that everybody's

00:46:07.629 --> 00:46:11.894
hooked up to experience
machines, but everybody's got

00:46:11.894 --> 00:46:15.416
the best possible tapes.
Now you ask yourself,

00:46:15.416 --> 00:46:18.899
what I'm asking you to ask
yourself, is would you want to

00:46:18.899 --> 00:46:22.320
spend your life hooked up to the
experience machine?

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.349
I'm not talking about,
wouldn't it be interesting to

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:28.320
try it out for a week or a month
or even a year?

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.805
And indeed, the question,
strictly speaking,

00:46:32.805 --> 00:46:38.647
isn't even would life on the
experience machine be better

00:46:38.647 --> 00:46:42.571
than it is now?
Although it would make me very,

00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:46.141
very sad to discover this,
I suppose it's possible some of

00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:49.585
you have such bad lives that
moving on to the experience

00:46:49.585 --> 00:46:53.099
machine would be a step up.
That's not the question.

00:46:53.099 --> 00:46:57.306
The question is,
does life on the experience

00:46:57.306 --> 00:47:01.806
machine give you
everything worth having

00:47:01.806 --> 00:47:04.964
in life?
Everything worth having

00:47:04.964 --> 00:47:10.423
in life.
Is it the best possible form of

00:47:10.423 --> 00:47:15.348
human existence?
According to the hedonists,

00:47:15.348 --> 00:47:19.030
the answer's got to be,
it has to be "yes."

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:23.406
Life on the experience machine
is perfect, as long as you've

00:47:23.406 --> 00:47:27.465
got the right tape plugged in.
So, you've got the best

00:47:27.465 --> 00:47:31.348
possible balance of wonderful
pleasures and wonderful,

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:35.011
fantastic experiences,
since that's all there is to

00:47:35.011 --> 00:47:37.579
human wellbeing.
By hypothesis,

00:47:37.579 --> 00:47:41.749
the machine is giving us that.
There couldn't possibly be

00:47:41.749 --> 00:47:46.172
anything more.
There couldn't possibly be

00:47:46.172 --> 00:47:50.399
anything missing.
But when I think about the

00:47:50.399 --> 00:47:54.385
question, would I want to spend
my life hooked up to an

00:47:54.385 --> 00:48:00.230
experience machine?
the answer is "no."

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.809
And I imagine that for most of
you, when you ask yourself,

00:48:03.809 --> 00:48:07.515
would you want your entire life
to be spent hooked up to the

00:48:07.515 --> 00:48:11.679
experience machine?
your answer is "no."

00:48:11.679 --> 00:48:18.526
But if the answer is "no," then
that means hedonism's got to be

00:48:18.526 --> 00:48:21.993
wrong.
If life on the experience

00:48:21.993 --> 00:48:27.678
machine is not everything,
then there's more to the best

00:48:27.678 --> 00:48:32.639
possible life than getting the
insides right.

00:48:32.639 --> 00:48:35.466
The experience machine gets the
pleasures right,

00:48:35.466 --> 00:48:39.487
gets the experiences right,
gets the mental states right,

00:48:39.487 --> 00:48:43.808
it gets the insides right,
but if life on the experience

00:48:43.808 --> 00:48:48.050
machine isn't all that's worth
wanting out of life,

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:52.927
then there's more to the best
possible life than getting the

00:48:52.927 --> 00:48:56.130
insides right.
What we've got to turn to next

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:59.390
time, then, is the question,
what else might it be?

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.390
Okay.

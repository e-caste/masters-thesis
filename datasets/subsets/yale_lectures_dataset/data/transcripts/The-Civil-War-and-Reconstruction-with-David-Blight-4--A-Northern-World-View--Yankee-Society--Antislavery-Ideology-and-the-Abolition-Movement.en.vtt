00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.513
Professor David Blight:
The other day I laid

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:12.810
a--well, in part I laid a list
of pro-slavery arguments on you,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.815
and a lot of quotations to give
you a sense of the depth and

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:23.731
breadth of pro-slavery ideology,
and I didn't want to leave that

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.740
entirely without tying up a knot
or two.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.841
Just consider this as a sense
of the scale of pro-slavery

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:38.462
writing.
when slave-holding

00:00:38.462 --> 00:00:44.995
politicians--when the planter
elite of the American

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:49.700
South--begins to organize
toward,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.219
at least toward,
some kind of separation and

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.210
secession over this slave
society they want to protect,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.070
they are reading hundreds and
hundreds of pages about their

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.842
system.
In 1855 an anthology of

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:12.810
pro-slavery writings was
published in the South.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.448
It was about 450 pages long.
In 1860, that anthology was

00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:21.120
updated, particularly with the
works of George Fitzhugh,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.000
into a 900-page volume,
which was really in most ways

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.409
only excerpts of pro-slavery
writing.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:39.030
And it was a work on the desks
of most secessionists.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.124
And I also didn't want to leave
you thinking this was all about

00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:49.752
abstract ideology.
One of the best descriptions

00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:54.793
I've ever read of why slavery
persisted, of why people

00:01:54.793 --> 00:01:58.179
defended it,
and why people went to war for

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.511
it, came before the war,
in 1857, in a speech by the

00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:04.666
African-American woman,
novelist, writer,

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.750
poet, Frances Ellen Watkins
Harper.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.927
In an 1850s anti-slavery speech
she said, among other things,

00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:17.735
this conclusion--in effect,
she's answer the question now,

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:22.039
"why has slavery boomed and
persisted and grows still?"

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.379
And this is in the wake of the
Dred Scott decision.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.706
"Ask Maryland," she says,
"with her tens of thousands of

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:33.954
slaves if she is not prepared
for freedom, and hear her

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:37.701
answer.
I helped supply the coffles,

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:41.771
gangs to the South.
Ask Virginia with her hundreds

00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:45.928
of thousands of slaves if she is
not weary with her merchandise

00:02:45.928 --> 00:02:49.950
of blood and anxious to shake
the gory traffic from her hands

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.836
and hear her reply,
'Though fertility has covered

00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:58.469
my soul,'"--this is Virginia
speaking--"'though I hold in my

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.022
hand a wealth of water power
enough to turn the spindles to

00:03:03.022 --> 00:03:07.000
clothe the world,
yet one of my chief staples has

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.210
been the sons and daughters I
send to the human markets.'

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.864
Ask farther south and all the
cotton growing states chime in,

00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:20.752
'We have need of fresh supplies
to fill the ranks of those whose

00:03:20.752 --> 00:03:24.786
lives have gone out in
unrequited toil on our distant

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:28.023
plantations.'
A hundred-thousand newborn

00:03:28.023 --> 00:03:31.889
babies are annually added to the
victims of slavery," said

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.636
Frances Ellen Watkins Harper.
"Twenty-thousand lives are

00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:38.849
annually sacrificed on the
plantations of the South.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.848
Such a sight should send a
thrill of horror through the

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:47.439
nerves of civilization and impel
the heart of humanity to lofty

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.558
deeds.
So it might,

00:03:49.558 --> 00:03:55.648
if men had not found out"--and
here's her phrase worth

00:03:55.648 --> 00:04:02.197
remembering--"a fearful alchemy
by which this blood can be

00:04:02.197 --> 00:04:08.342
transformed into gold.
Instead of listening to the cry

00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:14.330
of agony they listen to the ring
of dollars and stoop down and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.184
pick up the coins."
A fearful alchemy--that's a

00:04:20.184 --> 00:04:25.423
useful definition of slavery.
Why did an inhumane

00:04:25.423 --> 00:04:28.466
institution--of course not
everybody who defended it

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:31.807
thought it was inhumane--but why
did that system survive,

00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:33.120
persist and grow?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.680
Because it was so damned
profitable.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.949
Last time I began with
Alexander H.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.887
Stephens's famous Cornerstone
Speech in 1861,

00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:48.958
the famous passage by the
Vice-President of the

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.363
Confederacy declaring slavery
the cornerstone of the

00:04:52.363 --> 00:04:55.399
Confederate Movement.
We go north today.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:58.329
We're going to look largely at
the nature of Northern society.

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:02.324
We're going to look to some
extent today and mostly next

00:05:02.324 --> 00:05:06.899
Tuesday at the roots and origins
of an anti-slavery ideology,

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:13.089
a growing anti-slavery ideology
in its many layered forms.

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:17.718
But I want to begin today with
another passage,

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:22.347
from the war years,
and ask now from a Northern

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:25.970
point of view,
how do we get to Uriah

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.763
Parmelee?
Now there's a nineteenth

00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:32.580
century name for you.
Nobody's named Uriah anymore.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.470
You know any Uriah's?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.101
Uriah Parmelee was a kid who
grew up on a Connecticut farm,

00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:47.854
and the best I've been able to
determine his family was part of

00:05:47.854 --> 00:05:52.898
this market revolution.
They ended up moving to a small

00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:57.238
town and no longer engaged in
subsistence agriculture,

00:05:57.238 --> 00:06:00.759
if his parents had,
or his grandparents.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.232
And by means I don't entirely
understand, Uriah Parmelee,

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:10.630
in the spring of 1861,
was an Abolitionist.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.557
He was a Junior at Yale College.
He'd gotten caught up in

00:06:15.557 --> 00:06:19.533
Abolitionism and anti-slavery,
as young people get caught up

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:22.769
in political fervor and
movements of their times,

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:26.336
sometimes.
As soon as the Civil War broke

00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:31.279
out and Lincoln called for
volunteers in late April 1861,

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.106
Uriah Parmelee dropped out of
his Junior year at Yale and he

00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:38.089
joined the first regiment he
could get into.

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.272
There wasn't one organizing yet
around New Haven or nearby in

00:06:42.272 --> 00:06:46.524
Connecticut so he went to New
York and he joined the Sixth New

00:06:46.524 --> 00:06:49.543
York Cavalry.
To his brother Parmelee

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:53.767
confided, "I am more of an
abolitionist than ever now,

00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:58.068
right up to the handle.
If I had money enough to raise

00:06:58.068 --> 00:07:01.858
a few hundred contrabands and
arm them I'd get up an

00:07:01.858 --> 00:07:07.736
insurrection among the slaves;
told the captain I'd desert to

00:07:07.736 --> 00:07:10.069
do it."
Nah.

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.030
A lot of chutzpah in that
passage;

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.877
he hasn't seen any real war yet.
He wants to be John Brown,

00:07:15.877 --> 00:07:19.596
at that point.
He's going to get himself a

00:07:19.596 --> 00:07:24.823
band of insurrectionists and go
down there and kill some

00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:27.199
slaveholders,
he says.

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.345
Parmelee, in letters back home
to his parents,

00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:33.352
his brothers,
his sisters--and he wrote lots

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:37.406
of them--he at first denounced
Lincoln's government for its

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:41.531
failure in 1861 and even into
early 1862 to come out against

00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:44.511
slavery,
to make it a war against

00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.218
slavery.
He denounces the government

00:07:47.218 --> 00:07:50.054
he's serving.
In a letter in late 1861 from

00:07:50.054 --> 00:07:52.592
the front, "The present
contest," he says,

00:07:52.592 --> 00:07:54.819
"will indeed settle the
question,

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:57.750
for some years at least,
as to whether union or

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.490
secession, the Constitution or
rebellion,

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.692
shall triumph.
But the great heart wound,

00:08:05.692 --> 00:08:11.440
slavery, will not be reached."
He's angry, he's pissed off,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.360
he wants the war to be against
slavery, and it's not.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.277
He goes on in a letter in
spring 1862--the war still isn't

00:08:20.277 --> 00:08:24.195
a war against slavery in any
official sense--and he writes

00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:27.769
home to his brother saying he
wishes he had the,

00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:32.343
quote, "moral courage to
desert," because he no longer

00:08:32.343 --> 00:08:38.139
wants to serve this cause.
But he doesn't desert.

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:41.081
By March 1863,
he had concluded that

00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:45.786
emancipation would indeed be
achieved--this is now in the

00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:49.820
wake of Congress's Confiscation
Acts in '62,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.689
Lincoln's preliminary
proclamation,

00:08:52.689 --> 00:08:56.992
the ultimate Emancipation
Proclamation as of January

00:08:56.992 --> 00:09:01.633
1863--and by March of that
spring he's convinced the war

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:07.840
has transformed.
He refused a furlough to stay

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.585
and fight.
He writes home,

00:09:10.585 --> 00:09:14.892
"I do not intend to shirk now
that there is really something

00:09:14.892 --> 00:09:17.629
to fight for;
I mean freedom.

00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:21.407
Since the 1^(st) of January it
has become more and more evident

00:09:21.407 --> 00:09:24.879
to my mind that the war is
henceforth to be conducted upon

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:28.144
a different basis.
Those who profess to love the

00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:31.064
Union are not so anxious to
preserve slavery,

00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:35.179
while those who are opposed to
the war acknowledge in all their

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:39.160
actions that its continuance
will put an end to this accursed

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.374
system.
So then I am willing to remain

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:45.650
and endure whatever may fall to
my share."

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.376
He was honored for bravery by
at least three commanding

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:57.445
officers in numerous battles,
especially the Battle of

00:09:57.445 --> 00:10:02.720
Chancellorsville in May of 1863;
he was promoted to Captain.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.205
He eventually switched;
his New York--this happened in

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:12.258
many regiments in the Civil
War--it took so many casualties

00:10:12.258 --> 00:10:15.821
it ceased to exist--and he
switched to a Connecticut

00:10:15.821 --> 00:10:19.942
regiment and he served that
Connecticut regiment through the

00:10:19.942 --> 00:10:23.011
summer of 1864.
The great war of attrition in

00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:25.523
Virginia.
He survived the Battle of the

00:10:25.523 --> 00:10:29.080
Wilderness, the Battle of
Spotsylvania Court House,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.812
the Battle of Cold Harbor,
the entire Siege of Petersburg

00:10:33.812 --> 00:10:39.220
from August of '64 all the way
until the end of March of 1865.

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:46.701
He was killed on April 1^(st),
1865, at the Battle of Five

00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:49.185
Oaks--excuse me,
at Five Forks,

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:53.203
just west of Richmond,
the last major engagement of

00:10:53.203 --> 00:10:54.570
the Civil War.

00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:02.799
And when you walk out today and
you go through Woolsey Hall,

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:05.179
if you haven't done this
before,

00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:08.564
you'll note,
if you haven't before,

00:11:08.564 --> 00:11:14.237
that that's full of the names
of Yale College men who have

00:11:14.237 --> 00:11:17.400
died in war.
And Uriah Parmelee's name will

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.070
be right on your right,
as you're walking through.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:26.850
He's this high on my arm or
shoulder, and there's his name.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.804
Dropped out,
Junior Year,

00:11:29.804 --> 00:11:35.905
to fight, to destroy slavery.
And he did, for four years,

00:11:35.905 --> 00:11:40.976
and died in the last battle.
But how do you get to Uriah

00:11:40.976 --> 00:11:45.725
Parmelee, a kid from
Connecticut, obviously bright

00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:50.279
enough or connected enough to
get into Yale,

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:55.889
who gave all that up for
something he saw as a lot

00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:59.973
higher?
If you can come to understand a

00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:05.783
Uriah Parmelee--or better yet,
if you can come to understand

00:12:05.783 --> 00:12:08.314
young,
white, northern,

00:12:08.314 --> 00:12:11.603
Yankee, Anglo-Saxon,
Protestants,

00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:15.715
who often were very
contemptuous of Irish

00:12:15.715 --> 00:12:20.030
immigrants,
and even more contemptuous of

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:24.173
black Americans,
who nevertheless believed the

00:12:24.173 --> 00:12:29.469
War of 1861 had to be fought,
and ultimately came even to

00:12:29.469 --> 00:12:34.342
support the destruction of
slavery--if you can understand

00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:38.519
why those Northern Yankees get
to that point,

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:42.429
you really will understand the
Civil War.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.750
Uriah Parmelee had an
inheritance;

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.771
at what level he exactly
understood it I can't

00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:52.435
necessarily know,
although his letters are

00:12:52.435 --> 00:12:56.960
extraordinarily rich.
Now, in that Northern

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.523
society--and here we're using
labels pretty loosely,

00:13:02.523 --> 00:13:06.559
but so be it--the northern
states;

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:10.830
and well I'll leave the outline
up for the moment.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.730
No I won't.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:33.265
Professor David Blight:
 That's a wonderful old

00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:39.992
painting from 1830 called "The
Yankee Peddler."

00:13:39.992 --> 00:13:46.169
Everybody's heard of Yankee
peddlers.

00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:50.375
They don't come door to door
anymore unless they're working

00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:53.200
for the Jehovah's Witnesses.
Oops.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:01.281
[Laughter]
Well, or the Environmental

00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:07.450
Action Committee or the,
let's see--never mind.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.860
What's the Yankee peddler
peddling?

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.519
Cloth.
Readymade, factory-made cloth

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:20.986
for a woman, a housewife,
who isn't making her own cloth

00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:25.639
anymore.
That's the Market Revolution.

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:32.212
There are a thousand ways to
see it, understand it and grasp

00:14:32.212 --> 00:14:35.042
it.
If the South was a slave

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:39.872
society--and we tried to
demonstrate that last time,

00:14:39.872 --> 00:14:44.185
we tried to define that.
Although it's not defined in

00:14:44.185 --> 00:14:47.383
that newspaper that you're
reading back there in row

00:14:47.383 --> 00:14:49.606
twelve,
the Market Revolution is not

00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:51.830
reported in this morning's
newspapers;

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.605
actually it probably is,
the markets are going bad,

00:14:54.605 --> 00:14:56.769
although they went back up
yesterday.

00:14:56.769 --> 00:15:01.816
But this Market Revolution is
not reported in that newspaper,

00:15:01.816 --> 00:15:04.970
I would venture.
Sorry to interrupt you.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.217
But if the South was a slave
society the North was a market

00:15:09.217 --> 00:15:11.686
society.
It was a booming market society

00:15:11.686 --> 00:15:14.759
by the 1820s and 1830s.
It was beginning to be a market

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:17.269
society even in the late
eighteenth century.

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:21.475
The northern states by the
Antebellum Period--1820s,

00:15:21.475 --> 00:15:25.845
1830s, 1840s--was beginning to
sort of hurtle toward a

00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:31.370
different future than what that
slave society was--perhaps--no,

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.970
not really slowly--it too was
hurtling toward a certain

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.341
future.
This market--this booming

00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:41.167
market society with its market,
commercial, consumerist

00:15:41.167 --> 00:15:44.380
mentalities,
and its belief--eventually,

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.806
its faith in,
its defense of--free labor for

00:15:47.806 --> 00:15:51.221
the common man,
its kind of fanfare for the

00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:54.670
common man ideology,
would be something a lot of

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:59.220
white southerners would actually
fear and be frightened by.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.930
What is the Market Revolution?
It's the time in which--it's

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.807
not a single moment in time or
course, it's a long process--but

00:16:06.807 --> 00:16:10.434
it's the time in which long
distance commerce began to take

00:16:10.434 --> 00:16:12.678
hold,
because of transportation

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:16.110
revolutions: canals,
roads, railroads in particular.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.463
It's a time of technological
innovation, tremendous

00:16:19.463 --> 00:16:23.018
technological innovation,
so much technological change

00:16:23.018 --> 00:16:25.970
that half the time it frightened
people.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.378
In fact you can find all over
American culture in 1800,1810,

00:16:30.378 --> 00:16:34.190
even into the 1820s,
a lot of fear of technology.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:40.986
What is this thing, a telegraph?
Now today you probably don't

00:16:40.986 --> 00:16:44.284
fear technology.
I still have a little bit of

00:16:44.284 --> 00:16:46.577
that, I'm still a little
nineteenth century in that

00:16:46.577 --> 00:16:49.304
sense.
I hate it when they tell me

00:16:49.304 --> 00:16:52.220
they want to buy me a new
laptop.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.740
Enough already.
I don't care if it's four years

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.420
old, I don't want another one.

00:16:58.629 --> 00:17:03.889
Don't make me learn something
new with my machine.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:06.313
The Market Revolution was
driven, of course,

00:17:06.313 --> 00:17:09.414
by the growth of cities,
which became market centers and

00:17:09.414 --> 00:17:12.307
manufacturing centers.
Maybe more importantly,

00:17:12.307 --> 00:17:15.970
the Market Revolution is that
time in American history--that

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.260
incredible time,
really, when you think about

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.406
the scale of change--when
eighteenth century subsistence

00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:27.099
farmers who engaged in what was
always called,

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.756
or we've always called,
mixed agriculture--that is,

00:17:30.756 --> 00:17:33.390
they grew all kinds of
foodstuffs,

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.531
almost always for
themselves--when that kind of

00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:41.039
eighteenth century style farming
gave way to commercial farming,

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:47.044
where farmers now produced cash
crops, for a much broader

00:17:47.044 --> 00:17:49.373
market.
A market on the East Coast if

00:17:49.373 --> 00:17:52.005
they were in upstate New York,
or out in Ohio eventually,

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:53.650
and a market of the whole
world.

00:17:57.279 --> 00:18:00.959
It's that period when
the home or the farm--still a

00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:04.897
majority of northern people by
the 1830s and 1840s were making

00:18:04.897 --> 00:18:07.867
their livings from
agriculture--but it's a time

00:18:07.867 --> 00:18:11.870
when that home and farm became
its own domestic factory,

00:18:16.059 --> 00:18:18.936
where people began to produce
in their homes,

00:18:18.936 --> 00:18:21.160
for markets,
not for themselves.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.773
The vast multitudes were still
farmers, but they began to now

00:18:24.773 --> 00:18:26.700
buy goods, manufactured goods,

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:31.822
readymade clothing and shoes,
cloth, candles,

00:18:31.822 --> 00:18:35.073
soap, all kinds of foodstuffs.
Stuff that the eighteenth

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:39.712
century farmer made for him and
herself now you bought from a

00:18:39.712 --> 00:18:43.270
peddler or you bought from a
store in town.

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:51.005
This all, of course,
leads to a change in what

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:54.756
European historians taught us to
call mentalities,

00:18:54.756 --> 00:18:58.794
mentalité.
It brought about fundamental

00:18:58.794 --> 00:19:02.245
alterations, slowly,
in ways sometimes people didn't

00:19:02.245 --> 00:19:06.416
even know it's happening;
fundamental alterations in

00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:09.655
aspirations, in habits,
in activities,

00:19:09.655 --> 00:19:14.470
in conceptions and definitions
of work, and leisure.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.200
What is work and leisure now in
a society where you don't have

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.069
to produce everything for
yourself?

00:19:22.069 --> 00:19:24.307
It produced,
it would produce fundamental

00:19:24.307 --> 00:19:26.600
alterations in the conception of
labor.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.910
Who's a worker?
What is labor?

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:35.154
Is a laborer any more just an
individual, or is a laborer part

00:19:35.154 --> 00:19:39.943
of a collective problem,
part of a collective mentality,

00:19:39.943 --> 00:19:44.967
part of a collective movement
against a much greater force now

00:19:44.967 --> 00:19:49.190
called capital,
manufacturing, the company?

00:19:53.009 --> 00:19:55.569
It's going to alter the very
idea of individual rights.

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:59.312
We have a habit in this society
to think that individual rights,

00:19:59.312 --> 00:20:01.630
when they drafted the Bill of
Rights,

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.427
was just laid down for us and
it's just traveled through time

00:20:04.427 --> 00:20:06.295
and here they are.
Just go back and look at the

00:20:06.295 --> 00:20:08.050
founders.
It's such nonsense.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.921
It's ahistorical.
The very idea of individual

00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:13.360
rights got reshaped by the
Market Revolution.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:22.029
What do you have a right to now?
New shoes?

00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:25.259
It's going to change the very
idea of mobility.

00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:29.599
Where can you go,
and how, by what means?

00:20:29.599 --> 00:20:32.950
It's going to really
change--and this is absolutely

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.233
crucial, indirectly,
in helping us understand this

00:20:36.233 --> 00:20:40.120
war that's going to come down
the way--it's going to change

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.940
for a lot of northern--millions
of northern people,

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.691
some of them now immigrants who
have come here with a clear

00:20:47.691 --> 00:20:50.515
purpose--that is,
to make a better life--it's

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:54.001
going to change their conception
of what they can give their

00:20:54.001 --> 00:20:54.710
children.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:01.512
And we're going to hear a lot
more later on,

00:21:01.512 --> 00:21:04.480
next week, week after,
about free labor ideology.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.071
The idea that if labor is left
free then that common man always

00:21:08.071 --> 00:21:10.833
has a chance.
If the land isn't taken up by

00:21:10.833 --> 00:21:14.162
large oligarchies--life
slaveholding class--then the

00:21:14.162 --> 00:21:17.937
small guy has a chance.
But rooted in free labor

00:21:17.937 --> 00:21:22.869
ideology is, among other ideas,
this notion of mobility.

00:21:22.869 --> 00:21:27.554
That a free laborer is a mobile
laborer, especially in a society

00:21:27.554 --> 00:21:32.089
like the United States that had
this thing called The West,

00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:39.500
the limitless--apparently to
them anyway--boundless West.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.985
Even such concepts,
such great American

00:21:41.985 --> 00:21:46.106
concepts--let's call it that--as
self-reliance about which Ralph

00:21:46.106 --> 00:21:49.965
Waldo Emerson may have written
his greatest essay--I go read

00:21:49.965 --> 00:21:53.890
Emerson's "Self-Reliance"
at least once a year.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.063
Just, I don't know,
to feel better or something.

00:21:57.063 --> 00:22:01.062
It's the quintessential sort
of expression of individualism,

00:22:01.062 --> 00:22:04.718
but it's more than that.
But even an ideal like

00:22:04.718 --> 00:22:09.498
self-reliance--I can remake my
world, I can be anything I

00:22:09.498 --> 00:22:13.339
want--is changed by the Market
Revolution.

00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:17.176
It doesn't mean people believe
any less in self-reliance,

00:22:17.176 --> 00:22:19.779
it's just they keep seeing
evidence,

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:24.178
they keep bumping into
realities that show them that in

00:22:24.178 --> 00:22:30.114
the face of the market now,
especially the boom and bust

00:22:30.114 --> 00:22:36.498
cycles of the market,
their individualism is not so

00:22:36.498 --> 00:22:40.772
powerful.
The Market Revolution would,

00:22:40.772 --> 00:22:45.864
on the level of ideas and
thinking and sort of common

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:49.140
behavior,
would bring about a kind of

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.339
combination of tremendous
optimism, possibly like we've

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:57.621
never experienced since;
although you can find other

00:22:57.621 --> 00:23:01.094
moments in American history,
like the 1950s,

00:23:01.094 --> 00:23:05.375
where a kind of broad,
broad social optimism took hold

00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:08.591
of Americans.
It's one of the reasons we had

00:23:08.591 --> 00:23:13.064
a Civil Rights Movement.
But at the same time the Market

00:23:13.064 --> 00:23:18.395
Revolution is going to bring a
certain sense of anxiety,

00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:23.727
even dread, even despair.
It will lead to great wealth,

00:23:23.727 --> 00:23:26.894
of course.
Fortunes will begin to be made

00:23:26.894 --> 00:23:31.098
in the textile industry and in
the railroad industry by the

00:23:31.098 --> 00:23:34.142
'40s and '50s,
and in a host of other ways,

00:23:34.142 --> 00:23:37.539
real fortunes.
And some fortunes will begin to

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:40.210
be made in simple financial
speculation.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.890
Wall Street will be born.

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:48.242
At the same time,
of course, as wealth grows,

00:23:48.242 --> 00:23:50.960
the inequality in wealth grows
too.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.523
Specialization will set in.
Workplaces that some--that your

00:23:55.523 --> 00:23:59.497
parents' generation may have
grown up understanding as a very

00:23:59.497 --> 00:24:02.651
personal place.
Even if you worked in a small

00:24:02.651 --> 00:24:06.438
shop, they only had eight
workers and you were related to

00:24:06.438 --> 00:24:11.850
half of them.
The workplace would become less

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:16.599
personal, bigger,
uncontrollable.

00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:20.309
Women went to work,
most famously in the Lowell

00:24:20.309 --> 00:24:24.260
factories in Massachusetts and
in other places.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:35.864
Among the many images of the
famous mill girls is this one,

00:24:35.864 --> 00:24:39.916
taken in 1850,
I believe, in Lowell,

00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:44.450
Massachusetts.
She looks about nine-years-old;

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.230
she may have been 12 or 13.
But for the first time,

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:54.362
in significant numbers,
young girls and young women

00:24:54.362 --> 00:24:58.911
left farms,
left the realm of domesticity,

00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:05.135
left that world in which they
presumably had been shielded as

00:25:05.135 --> 00:25:09.628
children,
and now entered a world where

00:25:09.628 --> 00:25:15.789
they were child laborers,
and in a world now that breeds

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:20.756
child labor,
and even defends child labor,

00:25:20.756 --> 00:25:24.452
you have problems.
The Market Revolution would

00:25:24.452 --> 00:25:27.710
also lead to a lot of natural
environmental degradation.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.522
People got to be--got worried
about rivers,

00:25:29.522 --> 00:25:32.263
they really did.
There's now an environmental

00:25:32.263 --> 00:25:36.609
history being written of the
impact of the Market Revolution.

00:25:36.609 --> 00:25:39.641
As I mentioned earlier it would
lead, of course,

00:25:39.641 --> 00:25:43.990
to big cycles of boom and bust.
A big depression hit in 1837.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.990
Another big depression hit in
1857.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.642
Much more on that 1857 panic,
as they were called then,

00:25:50.642 --> 00:25:53.941
a little later in the course,
because it's absolutely

00:25:53.941 --> 00:25:57.022
pertinent to what happened in
the great political debates of

00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:57.910
the late1850s.

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:04.219
Even the idea of what a child
is--since we've got a child up

00:26:04.219 --> 00:26:06.968
here--even the idea of--and
there's a growing little

00:26:06.968 --> 00:26:09.069
subfield now of children's
history,

00:26:09.069 --> 00:26:10.549
which is actually very
interesting;

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:13.436
there's a man named Jim Martin
at Marquette University who's

00:26:13.436 --> 00:26:15.539
pioneered this--even the idea of
a child,

00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:19.893
that a child's place in a
family undergoes a kind of

00:26:19.893 --> 00:26:24.245
revolution in 20 or 30 years.
In a working-class family,

00:26:24.245 --> 00:26:27.328
an immigrant working-class
family in particular,

00:26:27.328 --> 00:26:30.083
by the '30s and '40s,
a child meant income,

00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:32.944
a child meant a worker.
Everybody had to work,

00:26:32.944 --> 00:26:34.900
and usually outside of whatever
was home.

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:40.531
But what also set in,
in the growing middle-class,

00:26:40.531 --> 00:26:43.480
of course, was a more bourgeois
definition of childhood,

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.674
a more modern definition of
childhood, born somewhere there

00:26:47.674 --> 00:26:53.283
between 1800 and 1860,
where the child was to be a

00:26:53.283 --> 00:26:58.878
protected youth--shielded,
and not used,

00:26:58.878 --> 00:27:02.843
by a family.
Parenting, in this new

00:27:02.843 --> 00:27:07.460
bourgeois conception of family,
parenting was to be moral

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:13.019
guardianship.
Or so it seemed.

00:27:13.019 --> 00:27:15.957
What the Market Revolution was,
in so many ways,

00:27:15.957 --> 00:27:18.644
was an engine,
a tremendous--Charles Sellers

00:27:18.644 --> 00:27:22.393
has written a famous book on
this--it was a tremendous engine

00:27:22.393 --> 00:27:25.767
for what became arguably the
most prevalent idea of the

00:27:25.767 --> 00:27:28.579
entire nineteenth century in
America,

00:27:28.579 --> 00:27:32.000
and that's the notion of
progress.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.019
America was now going to be the
nation of progress.

00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:38.480
It was going to be the place of
progress.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.809
It seemed to have boundless
borders and boundless resources.

00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:46.240
It looked like it could expand
almost forever.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:52.918
It had tremendous riches in ore.
It had tremendous natural

00:27:52.918 --> 00:27:55.203
wealth.
It would therefore be the place

00:27:55.203 --> 00:27:58.503
of progress in the world.
And as Walt Whitman wrote in

00:27:58.503 --> 00:28:01.666
poem after poem,
and other poets did as well,

00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:06.339
and politicians said over and
over and over and over--America,

00:28:06.339 --> 00:28:10.923
and this United States,
this nation formed there--would

00:28:10.923 --> 00:28:16.990
be the beginning of a new man,
a new start for humankind.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:21.960
That's a big idea.
Of course we still want to be

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.330
that.
It's never vanished in our

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.777
culture.
We still sometimes want to be

00:28:27.777 --> 00:28:32.608
Winthrop's City on the Hill,
beacon of something for

00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:35.386
everybody.
But think with me just for one

00:28:35.386 --> 00:28:37.190
second about the idea of
progress.

00:28:41.009 --> 00:28:45.062
If you come to believe,
if you say to the world,

00:28:45.062 --> 00:28:49.545
"We are the hope of humans,
we are the hope of earth,

00:28:49.545 --> 00:28:52.157
we are progress.
And by the way,

00:28:52.157 --> 00:28:55.528
we, the people of progress,
are rooted in those principles

00:28:55.528 --> 00:28:58.662
of the Declaration of
Independence"--which are written

00:28:58.662 --> 00:29:00.910
down essentially as
creeds--"and,

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.914
oh and by the way,
we have a written

00:29:02.914 --> 00:29:05.319
Constitution--we actually wrote
it down,

00:29:05.319 --> 00:29:09.799
we have a Bill of Rights where
we declare these things on

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:12.520
paper, unlike the Brits."
What have you done?

00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:20.076
You've said:
"we are really special,

00:29:20.076 --> 00:29:27.220
and we are really important,
and we are really good."

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.329
You've kind of set yourself up,
haven't you?

00:29:29.329 --> 00:29:32.706
If somebody walks and you're
meeting them for the first time,

00:29:32.706 --> 00:29:35.631
"Hello, I'm a beacon of
progress and good and hope in

00:29:35.631 --> 00:29:37.857
the world, how do you do?"
[Laughter]

00:29:37.857 --> 00:29:41.190
You're probably going to think,
"oh shit, this"--instantly your

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.770
cynicism kicks in and then
"who's this jerk?"

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.890
The doctrine of progress I'm
simply saying has always bred

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.225
its contradictions.
And there were a whole bunch of

00:29:57.225 --> 00:29:58.849
them laying out there,
weren't there?

00:29:58.849 --> 00:30:00.920
They were laying all over the
place.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.170
But, you know,
you couldn't resist it.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:07.940
How could you resist a sense of
change in 1820s New York?

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:13.000
1830s Philadelphia?
1840s and '50s Ohio?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.352
1850s Chicago,
which was already by the 1850s

00:30:17.352 --> 00:30:21.309
the railroad capital of North
America?

00:30:21.309 --> 00:30:24.089
How could you resist that sense
of change?

00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:27.363
Tocqueville couldn't resist it,
it was the thing he couldn't

00:30:27.363 --> 00:30:30.081
stop writing about in
Democracy in America,

00:30:30.081 --> 00:30:32.190
and he was only observing in
1831.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.460
He didn't come back and see it
in the 1850s.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:40.343
He was just amazed at these
Americans, how they just moved

00:30:40.343 --> 00:30:44.679
all the time,
and they were just so full of

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:49.302
hope all the time.
He said Americans would always

00:30:49.302 --> 00:30:53.849
build a house but then move
before they put a roof on it.

00:30:53.849 --> 00:30:56.583
They were always mobile,
always going somewhere,

00:30:56.583 --> 00:30:57.630
always changing.

00:31:01.049 --> 00:31:03.520
Part of that change,
of course, bringing fear with

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.113
it, was immigration.
In the 1830s 600,000 immigrants

00:31:07.113 --> 00:31:11.438
came to the United States,
almost entirely from Western

00:31:11.438 --> 00:31:16.950
Europe;
in the 1840s alone 1.5 million;

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:22.609
and in the 1850s,
almost 3 million more.

00:31:22.609 --> 00:31:27.130
By 1852-53, Boston and New
York--think about

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:32.281
this--Boston--although we're
getting close to that

00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:39.009
again--Boston and New York had
50% foreign-born populations.

00:31:39.009 --> 00:31:41.223
One of every two people in New
York City in 1852 was born

00:31:41.223 --> 00:31:44.010
outside the United States.
Same in Boston.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:49.279
Close to that in Philadelphia.
The Northern cities,

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:51.691
seats of market culture,
commercialism,

00:31:51.691 --> 00:31:54.230
manufacturing,
were immigrant cities.

00:31:58.069 --> 00:32:00.743
All this, of course,
was fuelled by--I mentioned it

00:32:00.743 --> 00:32:03.577
already--a transportation
revolution symbolized by the

00:32:03.577 --> 00:32:05.590
Erie Canal,
finished in 1825,

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.720
which remained profitable all
the way out into the 1880s.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.609
The longest ditch in the world,
as it was called,

00:32:13.609 --> 00:32:16.849
300-and-some-odd miles out to
Buffalo.

00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:21.996
It was the romantic--and by the
way, about 3,300 miles of such

00:32:21.996 --> 00:32:26.299
canals would be built by the
middle of the 1850s,

00:32:26.299 --> 00:32:30.400
all for the purpose of
commerce, and to move people.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.793
Steamboats became the romantic
symbol of this great

00:32:33.793 --> 00:32:37.390
transportation revolution and
all of this movement.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:42.357
Although they too,
they too brought dread with

00:32:42.357 --> 00:32:46.346
them.
One-third of every steamboat

00:32:46.346 --> 00:32:52.089
built in the United States
before 1850 exploded and

00:32:52.089 --> 00:32:57.542
destroyed--became a wreck.
And there's no mistaking in

00:32:57.542 --> 00:33:01.709
Mark Twain's imagination,
if you remember the scene in

00:33:01.709 --> 00:33:05.280
Huck Finn--I mean,
among the hundred eternal

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.966
take-home images in Huck Finn is
that moment when Huck and Jim

00:33:09.966 --> 00:33:13.344
are on their raft,
it's a little foggy,

00:33:13.344 --> 00:33:18.283
they can't quite see--they can
hear--and pretty soon that

00:33:18.283 --> 00:33:23.400
steamboat just smashes into that
raft and over they go.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.410
Steamboats were wonderful and
exciting and romantic.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.500
You could go gamble on them,
you could go get sexed on them.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.880
They also might just blow you
up.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.913
[Laughter]
And then, of course,

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:40.160
railroads, which reshaped North
America.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.414
No continent,
you could argue,

00:33:42.414 --> 00:33:46.378
had ever been quite
made--readymade if you want--for

00:33:46.378 --> 00:33:49.410
railroads quite like North
America.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:52.944
It fit the environment
perfectly, once they could make

00:33:52.944 --> 00:33:56.480
these things actually go
twenty-five miles an hour.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.259
They never figured out how to
build gauges properly.

00:34:00.259 --> 00:34:03.816
There were some twelve to
fifteen different widths of

00:34:03.816 --> 00:34:07.509
railroads in the Northern states
alone by the 1850s,

00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:10.733
and you could go into one town
on a gauge, I don't know,

00:34:10.733 --> 00:34:14.132
three feet wide but on the
other side of town it would come

00:34:14.132 --> 00:34:17.328
out four feet wide.
Why they never quite sat down

00:34:17.328 --> 00:34:20.070
and standardized all this,
I have no idea.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:25.706
But railroads revolutionized an
American sense of time,

00:34:25.706 --> 00:34:29.810
their ability to travel.
It revolutionized

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.327
manufacturing,
it revolutionized how quickly

00:34:33.327 --> 00:34:37.990
you could get to markets,
and it made Chicago Chicago.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.605
It also made the first
multi-millionaires,

00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:48.982
the first massive fortunes,
and it became the first great

00:34:48.982 --> 00:34:53.907
example of the deep relationship
in the nineteenth century--back

00:34:53.907 --> 00:34:57.659
in our heyday of laisser-faire
government,

00:34:57.659 --> 00:35:02.551
ho-ho--of a relationship
between the Federal government

00:35:02.551 --> 00:35:06.236
and business.
The great American railroads

00:35:06.236 --> 00:35:09.226
were built by and large,
for decades,

00:35:09.226 --> 00:35:13.380
by government subsidies,
and a tremendous amount of

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.191
corruption.
The railroad had a lot to do,

00:35:16.191 --> 00:35:18.336
too, of course,
with linking northeast with

00:35:18.336 --> 00:35:21.062
northwest,
which has a lot to do with a

00:35:21.062 --> 00:35:24.967
certain sense of economic
isolation that set in in the

00:35:24.967 --> 00:35:26.280
South,
to some extent.

00:35:30.429 --> 00:35:33.610
And I'll just say a word
quickly, that don't

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:38.269
underestimate the influence here
of an ideology beneath this.

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:40.896
We usually only talk about
Manifest Destiny when we're

00:35:40.896 --> 00:35:43.920
talking about the westward
movement beyond the Mississippi.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.751
We only usually bring it up
when we're talking about the

00:35:46.751 --> 00:35:49.119
Mexican War and its aftermath,
or something.

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:52.940
But Manifest Destiny was a very
old American idea.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.749
It was probably coined by this
journalist named O'Sullivan,

00:35:56.749 --> 00:36:00.099
although now there's a new
theory that it wasn't.

00:36:00.099 --> 00:36:03.594
I leave it to my expert
colleagues in History of the

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:07.431
American West to decide exactly
who came up with the term

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:10.719
Manifest Destiny,
who actually first used it.

00:36:10.719 --> 00:36:14.401
But Manifest Destiny was in
some ways the fuel of the

00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:18.630
American imagination.
It combined so many ideas.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:23.237
Under that heading you might
call "American Progress" came

00:36:23.237 --> 00:36:27.360
the sense of American mission:
spreading liberty,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.949
spreading democracy,
spreading Christianity.

00:36:32.949 --> 00:36:37.661
A Christian civilization was
deeply at the root of this

00:36:37.661 --> 00:36:41.500
cluster of ideas we call
Manifest Destiny,

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:46.236
as was a virulent kind of
nationalism that boomed after

00:36:46.236 --> 00:36:51.059
the War of 1812 and through the
1820s into the 1830s.

00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:53.882
And Manifest Destiny was the
engine of capitalism,

00:36:53.882 --> 00:36:56.369
make no mistake.
Why did we want all that land

00:36:56.369 --> 00:36:58.730
in the Mexican Session?
Why did we want Oregon?

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:02.807
Why did we want California?
And deep at the root of

00:37:02.807 --> 00:37:05.538
Manifest Destiny,
of course--and there's book

00:37:05.538 --> 00:37:09.448
after book written on this--is a
deep and abiding American white

00:37:09.448 --> 00:37:13.480
supremacy.
It was the destiny of a white,

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.613
Anglo-Saxon,
Protestant, United States to

00:37:17.613 --> 00:37:24.019
take control and improve this
great land it had been given.

00:37:24.019 --> 00:37:28.962
Now, before I leave that,
let me just suggest--sometimes

00:37:28.962 --> 00:37:33.186
one of the ways,
when you want to understand how

00:37:33.186 --> 00:37:37.320
progress builds in its own
contradictions,

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.538
and why I think contradiction
is what makes American history

00:37:41.538 --> 00:37:44.469
interesting--we are our
contradictions.

00:37:44.469 --> 00:37:47.760
That's why the world is
fascinated with us.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:54.227
Look at the literature.
Go back all the way to James

00:37:54.227 --> 00:37:57.931
Fenimore Cooper.
His Leatherstocking

00:37:57.931 --> 00:38:02.417
Tales are full of a certain
anxiety about what might be

00:38:02.417 --> 00:38:06.516
happening to that frontier,
what's coming from east to

00:38:06.516 --> 00:38:08.860
west.
Read Thoreau's Walden.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.107
What's Thoreau up to?
I mean Thoreau may have been a

00:38:12.107 --> 00:38:16.624
snob, he may have been smarmy,
and he may have wanted you to

00:38:16.624 --> 00:38:20.070
think he was cool because he
sold pencils.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:28.143
[Laughter]
But he wrote one of the most

00:38:28.143 --> 00:38:34.590
brilliant critiques of change,
and what it can mean,

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:40.254
any American ever wrote.
When Thoreau sits on his little

00:38:40.254 --> 00:38:43.954
stool outside his cabin at
Walden Pond and he hears the

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:48.551
train go by over the ridge,
and he puts his hands over his

00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:53.889
ears--he doesn't want to hear
it--he's representing something.

00:38:53.889 --> 00:38:59.502
I'm not saying he was right,
and the damn fool should've got

00:38:59.502 --> 00:39:04.639
down and got real with the
railroads, but he didn't.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:08.370
What is Emerson up to in his
essay "Nature"?

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.781
In almost every poem Walt
Whitman wrote he seems to be

00:39:15.781 --> 00:39:18.824
fashioning himself,
if not the whole of this

00:39:18.824 --> 00:39:21.949
American people,
which sometimes he did call an

00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:23.660
American race,
as a new Adam.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.244
"I the singer of Adamic
songs"--he said it

00:39:29.244 --> 00:39:31.860
directly--"through the new
garden of the West,

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:36.784
the great city is calling,
as Adam early in the morning,

00:39:36.784 --> 00:39:41.400
walking forth from the bower,
refreshed with sleep;

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:47.010
behold me, where I pass,
hear my voice."

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:52.639
He goes on, I can do anything
in this American West,

00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:58.261
this American possibility.
But as soon as we read Whitman,

00:39:58.261 --> 00:40:02.343
then you realize there's
Nathaniel Hawthorne who in

00:40:02.343 --> 00:40:06.589
1844--even before Whitman
started writing most of his

00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:10.099
poems--Hawthorne was a pretty
dourful,

00:40:10.099 --> 00:40:13.644
he was an old Puritan,
he was a conservative,

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:17.429
dourful kind of--he was a real
New Englander.

00:40:17.429 --> 00:40:21.164
Hawthorne wrote a short story
you should read sometime,

00:40:21.164 --> 00:40:24.691
as a balance to all of this
optimism of this period,

00:40:24.691 --> 00:40:27.320
irresistible as that optimism
was.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:31.430
It's called "Earth's Holocaust."
Have you ever read that?

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.496
It's an incredible story.
He has this whole group of

00:40:34.496 --> 00:40:37.880
people out somewhere on the
American frontier and they're a

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.930
kind of a cult.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:47.570
They decide they're going to
have a bonfire and they build

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:54.010
this giant fire and into it they
throw everything from the past.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:57.642
They throw heraldry,
they throw every kind of

00:40:57.642 --> 00:41:02.596
vestige of Old World culture and
monarchy and aristocracy and

00:41:02.596 --> 00:41:06.308
civilization.
They throw all kinds of old

00:41:06.308 --> 00:41:09.900
books, great old books,
onto the bonfire.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.750
They burn everything from
Europe, everything that's old.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.706
It's a purification.
They're going to make a new

00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:22.307
world.
They don't need anything from

00:41:22.307 --> 00:41:24.569
the past.
And it's Hawthorne's satire,

00:41:24.569 --> 00:41:27.789
it's his critique of it.
It's apocalyptic,

00:41:27.789 --> 00:41:33.538
angry critique of all these
Americans who think they're

00:41:33.538 --> 00:41:37.690
inventing everything anew every
day.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.580
Hawthorne had a bummer,
I mean he--.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.750
Well enough, I guess, of that;

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.722
although if you want to
understand the optimism of that

00:41:51.722 --> 00:41:53.720
time just dip into Leaves of
Grass, read Whitman's Old

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.659
Pioneers.
He can't stop.

00:41:55.659 --> 00:42:00.502
I once counted the number of
times he used the word--the

00:42:00.502 --> 00:42:04.639
letter--O--in that poem,
and I quit counting.

00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:09.390
It's like America,
to Whitman, was "O!".

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.172
He just couldn't stop.
Well, and sometimes that "O

00:42:13.172 --> 00:42:16.780
America" meant the tinkerer,
it meant the inventor,

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.145
it meant the guy who invented a
new kind of sewing machine and

00:42:20.145 --> 00:42:23.758
took it in for a patent.
If you want to understand this

00:42:23.758 --> 00:42:26.081
Yankee, northern,
market economy,

00:42:26.081 --> 00:42:29.856
society, just look at some
histories of technological

00:42:29.856 --> 00:42:34.285
innovation throughout this era
and you realize there were just

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:37.769
thousands and thousands of
patents given,

00:42:37.769 --> 00:42:41.876
mostly to northerners,
for inventing this or that kind

00:42:41.876 --> 00:42:46.680
of thing or trinket or firearm
or method of producing something

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.554
or printing press or glass or
musical instrument or

00:42:50.554 --> 00:42:55.048
Connecticut clocks or the first
refrigerators or ice-making

00:42:55.048 --> 00:42:58.690
machines or new locks or new
elevators,

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:02.800
and on and on and on and on and
on it goes.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.487
I forget who--it may have been
Charles Seller--who said if you

00:43:06.487 --> 00:43:09.570
want to see the Market
Revolution happening go study

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:12.170
the Archives of the U.S.
Patent Office.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:17.211
I've always found that kind of
research rather boring,

00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:23.718
but I think he had a point.
Now, in any society changing

00:43:23.718 --> 00:43:28.671
this much, this fast,
doubling its own

00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:34.829
population--doubling--in
twenty-five years.

00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:40.003
If the rate of population
growth of the United States

00:43:40.003 --> 00:43:44.780
between 1820 and 1850 had
sustained over time,

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.967
we'd have today approximately
one and a half billion people in

00:43:48.967 --> 00:43:51.757
the United States.
Now it didn't,

00:43:51.757 --> 00:43:57.526
and we had these World Wars and
we had all this history in

00:43:57.526 --> 00:44:00.046
between.
What do we have now,

00:44:00.046 --> 00:44:02.633
300 million?
If the rate of growth had

00:44:02.633 --> 00:44:06.179
sustained, that's what the
population would've been.

00:44:06.179 --> 00:44:11.722
Any era of great change,
great ferment,

00:44:11.722 --> 00:44:18.285
usually causes reform,
anxiety, people who get

00:44:18.285 --> 00:44:25.978
worried, want to change things.
We've probably had four major

00:44:25.978 --> 00:44:31.154
periods in American history
of--there's one other picture I

00:44:31.154 --> 00:44:32.940
wanted to put up.

00:44:36.929 --> 00:44:39.370
Oh, I'll leave that little girl
up.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.203
She's much better than the--.
I had a picture of the Lowell

00:44:42.203 --> 00:44:44.429
Mills insignia but you don't
need that.

00:44:44.429 --> 00:44:48.670
We have probably four great
reform periods in American

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.396
history.
Now, and by reform I mean a

00:44:51.396 --> 00:44:55.250
period in which people became
professional reformers.

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:58.526
Movements, organizations,
societies--whole newspapers

00:44:58.526 --> 00:45:00.984
came into existence,
magazines came into

00:45:00.984 --> 00:45:03.820
existence--to either eradicate
something,

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.130
to change something,
or to build something.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:10.730
Fundamental challenges to the
social order.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.543
The first is this era,
of the 1820s,

00:45:13.543 --> 00:45:16.920
'30s, '40s and '50s,
Antebellum America,

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.285
exemplified most obviously by
the anti-slavery movement,

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:25.809
which is where we're going to
get to as we leave today.

00:45:25.809 --> 00:45:27.211
Of course, there were many
other reform movements at the

00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:30.464
time.
The second great reform era is

00:45:30.464 --> 00:45:34.460
the Progressive Era,
a great response to

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.923
urbanization,
industrialization and

00:45:37.923 --> 00:45:42.440
immigration, as it had never
quite happened before.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.012
The third is in all likelihood
the New Deal,

00:45:46.012 --> 00:45:50.249
the Great Depression,
the incredible emergencies and

00:45:50.249 --> 00:45:54.984
crises of what governments owe
their people and people owe

00:45:54.984 --> 00:45:59.719
their governments that the Great
Depression caused.

00:45:59.719 --> 00:46:03.701
And the New Deal brought a
fundamental new set of

00:46:03.701 --> 00:46:07.350
approaches, ideas,
which we're still debating

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.664
today;
it's all over our political

00:46:09.664 --> 00:46:11.590
culture whether it's named or
not.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.460
And the fourth one is the '60s.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:19.557
There it had less to do often
with social forms of

00:46:19.557 --> 00:46:22.626
reform--although that's not
entirely true--than it had to do

00:46:22.626 --> 00:46:25.590
with the Civil Rights revolution
and the Vietnam War.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:37.502
In American history our reform
crusades have usually had to do

00:46:37.502 --> 00:46:43.250
with one of several objects or
purposes or problems.

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.699
The first is the
industrializing process.

00:46:46.699 --> 00:46:51.510
And we've been living the
history of how to reform the

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:54.632
industrializing process,
and now the

00:46:54.632 --> 00:46:58.514
post-industrializing process,
ever since our first market

00:46:58.514 --> 00:47:01.079
revolution--we're still living
it.

00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:04.820
Why are we having a debate over
Social Security?

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.630
The second is racial equality,
and we're still having that

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:13.660
reform movement.
Well, or are we?

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.801
The third is gender equality;
that's at least as old as

00:47:16.801 --> 00:47:17.530
abolitionism.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:24.177
The fourth is war,
and we got peace movements in

00:47:24.177 --> 00:47:27.411
American history and anti-war
fervor and ferment,

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:30.039
of all kinds,
for a very long time.

00:47:30.039 --> 00:47:33.139
And the fifth kind of American
reform--and here it takes on

00:47:33.139 --> 00:47:38.727
sometimes some distinctive,
distinctly American forms--is

00:47:38.727 --> 00:47:43.599
religious and individual
morality;

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:47.947
movements of piety,
movements that try to define

00:47:47.947 --> 00:47:52.387
deviance in others,
and try to reform others to a

00:47:52.387 --> 00:47:56.180
certain personal conception of
faith,

00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:02.541
or religion, or behavior.
But whenever we've had a reform

00:48:02.541 --> 00:48:08.949
era there's been a big issue,
or two or three or four.

00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:12.492
That's why all these arguments
that we all get into these days

00:48:12.492 --> 00:48:15.745
about third-party political
candidates--what do we really

00:48:15.745 --> 00:48:19.305
need in our political culture,
what would break apart the

00:48:19.305 --> 00:48:22.720
stagnation of our two-party
system, if that's what people

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:28.072
want--or put more directly,
will Michael Bloomberg run or

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:30.691
not?
I always throw that back at

00:48:30.691 --> 00:48:33.969
people and say,
damn it, read some history.

00:48:33.969 --> 00:48:38.830
There's never been a successful
third-party political culture

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:43.366
take hold in this country
without one really big issue to

00:48:43.366 --> 00:48:47.460
drive it.
Name that issue that Michael

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:52.397
Bloomberg would use.
I'm a billionaire and you can

00:48:52.397 --> 00:48:53.890
be too?
[laughter] That's unfair.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:55.070
I know, he's a nice guy.

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.420
Let me just end here with this.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:12.367
To be anti-slavery in America
by the 1820s and 1830s was to

00:49:12.367 --> 00:49:17.909
face a host of barriers--and
I'll come back to these barriers

00:49:17.909 --> 00:49:22.614
next time--a host of barriers.
The sanctity of the U.S.

00:49:22.614 --> 00:49:25.353
Constitution,
the depth of that pro-slavery

00:49:25.353 --> 00:49:28.874
argument, which northern
abolitionists over time had to

00:49:28.874 --> 00:49:32.460
actually come to realize even
existed--and they began to

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.590
realize it existed in the 1820s
and '30s.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:39.433
They faced tremendous barriers.
There was no good reason in the

00:49:39.433 --> 00:49:42.440
world that an abolitionist in
the 1830s, '40s,

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.775
and even the '50s,
had any right to believe they

00:49:44.775 --> 00:49:47.210
would see the end of slavery in
their lifetime.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:02.791
And last point.
One of the barriers--think

00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:07.309
about this--one of the barriers
that an anti-slavery--if you

00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:10.449
were worried about slavery in
America,

00:50:10.449 --> 00:50:12.307
its expansion,
its influence in the

00:50:12.307 --> 00:50:15.694
government, what it did to free
labor, how it might retard that

00:50:15.694 --> 00:50:18.809
market revolution that you
wanted your children to benefit

00:50:18.809 --> 00:50:21.483
from,
whatever position you might end

00:50:21.483 --> 00:50:25.027
up taking between 1830 and 1860
that made you at least

00:50:25.027 --> 00:50:28.416
suspicious of slavery,
whatever you thought of

00:50:28.416 --> 00:50:32.745
African-Americans--one of the
barriers you're up against is

00:50:32.745 --> 00:50:37.000
the simple fact that the United
States was a republic,

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.305
and that the side that owned
those slaves,

00:50:40.305 --> 00:50:44.739
that vast slave society,
half of the United States--it's

00:50:44.739 --> 00:50:48.769
still half the States in
1850--they were free,

00:50:48.769 --> 00:50:53.822
their leaders at least,
were free to defend their

00:50:53.822 --> 00:50:56.929
system.
They were free to dissent.

00:50:56.929 --> 00:50:59.250
And they were republicans,
small r, too.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.796
The greatest tragedy of
American history arguably is

00:51:10.796 --> 00:51:15.360
that this struggle could not be
decided by debate.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.673
Okay, see you in the gym.

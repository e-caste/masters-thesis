00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.280
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.061
Now we move to our last author
in this course,

00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:09.930
to Émile Durkheim.
 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.970
There are really two Durkheims.
 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.900
We have seen certainly two
Marxs and two Webers.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.680
There are also two faces of
Émile Durkheim.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.289
To put it bluntly,
the young Durkheim has been a

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:40.565
functionalist and a positivist,
and then late in his life he

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:47.200
has--his epistemological turn--
he became a cultural analyst.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.627
Well it's not quite true,
because each author is more

00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:56.822
complex, and there were already
elements of his culturalism in

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.440
the early work.
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.899
But there was certainly a
dramatic change in the way how

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.260
Durkheim conceived what the job
of social sciences,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.183
later in his life,
in his book The Elementary

00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:15.688
Forms of Religious Life.
 

00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:19.727
I think it had a lot to do also
with his personal life,

00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:21.970
and we will talk about this.
 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.388
He was brought up in a
rabbinical family and was

00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:31.444
supposed to become a rabbi,
and then he revolted against

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:36.379
the parental household--
much like Nietzsche did--and

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:42.221
turned probably into an atheist,
but certainly not an active

00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:43.989
believer in Judaism.
 

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:49.703
And later in his life he became
again interested in religion,

00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:54.559
and not only philosophically,
but also existentially

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:57.129
interested in religion.
 

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:03.239
Well in the course we have only
four lectures on Durkheim.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.340
So I'll leave Durkheim the
culturalist out,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.080
and we will be doing work only
on his earlier work,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.568
The Division of Labor,
the wonderful book

00:02:18.568 --> 00:02:22.925
Suicide,
and a somewhat difficult book,

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:26.008
The Rules of Sociological
Method.

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:35.318
And I'll just leave The
Elementary Forms of Religious

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:39.372
Life;
I don't have time to fit this

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:39.870
into.
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.734
Durkheim had an extraordinary
impact on American social

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:46.818
science.
 

00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:51.508
Initially it was particularly
the younger Durkheim,

00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:56.758
the functionalist Durkheim,
who had such an extraordinary

00:02:56.758 --> 00:02:57.788
impact.
 

00:02:57.788 --> 00:03:04.853
Unlike Weber or Marx,
whose impact was broad and

00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:13.270
affected history and economics
and political science,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.460
Durkheim's impact was much more
focused on sociology.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.308
So in this course the only
author who, properly speaking,

00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:26.120
is a sociologist is
Émile Durkheim.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.473
All the others you discussed
were not really identified

00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:34.348
themselves as sociologists.
 

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:42.169
Later in his life Weber did,
but not on the whole.

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.702
Émile Durkheim
identified himself and his

00:03:47.702 --> 00:03:50.410
project as sociology.
 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.508
It, of course,
has a lot to do that these

00:03:54.508 --> 00:03:59.120
disciplinary boundaries between
economics,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.043
political science,
and sociology became much more

00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:05.758
sharply drawn by the end of the
nineteenth and early twentieth

00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:09.384
century,
and sociology as an academic

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:13.841
discipline was really
established by the late

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.069
nineteenth century.
 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.625
So this is Émile
Durkheim--born in 1858 and died

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:21.470
in 1917.
 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.278
Just very briefly about his
life.

00:04:25.278 --> 00:04:29.449
He was born in a small town,
Épinal in France.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.204
As I said, his father was a
rabbi and he was expected to

00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:37.819
become a rabbi himself.
 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.009
In '79, he was admitted to the
École Normale

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.774
Supérieure,
which is one of these very

00:04:45.774 --> 00:04:50.887
elite schools,
MIT version in France,

00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:57.940
and by the time he went to
university--

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.600
École Normale
Supérieure is a

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.350
university--
he lost his religious beliefs.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.415
He was for some time a
professor at the University of

00:05:13.415 --> 00:05:14.699
Bordeaux.
 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.637
Then he became politically
active in the 1940s,

00:05:18.637 --> 00:05:22.490
especially in the so-called
Dreyfus Affair;

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.060
and I will just briefly mention
what that was.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.545
Then in 1902,
he became professor at the

00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:34.514
University of Paris,
which is not quite as

00:05:34.514 --> 00:05:38.110
distinguished as École
Normale Supérieure.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:45.663
His son was killed in the war,
and shortly after this he died

00:05:45.663 --> 00:05:47.050
in Paris.
 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.740
So this is Alfred Dreyfus.
 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.742
This is a very important event
in French, and in many ways in

00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:56.410
European, history.
 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.000
What was the Dreyfus Affair?
 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.470
You probably all know.
 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.935
In 1894, Dreyfus,
who was Jewish,

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:13.449
was falsely accused to be a
German spy, and was imprisoned.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:19.199
That was obviously an
anti-Semitic trial,

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.778
and this mobilized the French
intellectuals,

00:06:22.778 --> 00:06:25.411
and not only French
intellectuals,

00:06:25.411 --> 00:06:28.680
but French intellectuals in
particular.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.790
Émile Zola,
whom some of you may have read,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.800
the leading French writer of
this epoch,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.788
wrote an important article
which appeared in the leading

00:06:43.788 --> 00:06:47.690
French daily newspaper:
J'Accuse--

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.822
"I accuse the French
judiciary of being

00:06:51.822 --> 00:06:53.839
anti-Semitic."
 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:59.141
Well Durkheim joined other
prominent French intellectuals

00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:01.319
to protest the trial.
 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.610
It took them a long time but
eventually they were successful.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.129
Dreyfus was eventually
exonerated of all charges and

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:14.350
made a Knight of the Legion of
Honor.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:20.110
So it was a happy ending of
French anti-Semitism,

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.670
for awhile.
 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.997
Then it came back with
vengeance during the occupation,

00:07:25.997 --> 00:07:27.439
Nazi occupation.
 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:32.254
The French are not as innocent
about anti-Semitism as you may

00:07:32.254 --> 00:07:33.940
want to believe it.
 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.750
Many were collaborating with
the Nazis.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.079
Well about the work.
 

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:45.579
In '93 he wrote a dissertation,
which probably is still his

00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:49.319
most influential book,
The Division of Labor in

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.029
Society,
and today's lecture will be

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:53.290
focused on this.
 

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.798
'95, it was followed by
The Rules of

00:07:56.798 --> 00:08:01.007
Sociological Method,
which is his most positivistic

00:08:01.007 --> 00:08:02.100
statement.
 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.000
The Division of Labor is
his most functionalist work.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.079
And then in '97 he wrote
Suicide.

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:14.824
Suicide is a very
important book because it's

00:08:14.824 --> 00:08:18.495
really the first piece of
rigorous empirical social

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:23.165
science,
which takes a very unusual,

00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:27.471
very rare phenomenon,
like suicide,

00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:32.916
and crunches numbers extremely
carefully to test whether he can

00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:38.009
identify social determinants of
such a rare phenomenon.

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:42.317
Fortunately even in countries
where many people commit

00:08:42.317 --> 00:08:45.570
suicide, it's still a rare
phenomenon.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:51.280
But he managed to come up with
a very provocative theory,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:57.399
what he demonstrated with very
careful empirical analysis.

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:02.490
We will be looking at two parts
of The Division of Labor.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.666
Today we will be looking at the
major arguments of Division

00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:08.940
of Labor.
 

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:16.870
And then also we will look at,
Thursday,

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.557
on his theory of anomie,
which is a central piece of the

00:09:21.557 --> 00:09:25.264
book,
Division of Labor,

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:29.500
but a kind of by-the-way
analysis.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:38.308
And, as I said,
in 1915 he wrote this book,

00:09:38.308 --> 00:09:40.129
The Elementary Forms of
Religious Life,

00:09:40.129 --> 00:09:44.110
which is a major break in his
work,

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.322
and shows his renewed interest
in the spiritual and the

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.769
metaphysical.
 

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:54.950
Okay, just very briefly,
what is in the books.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.556
As I said, The
Division of Labour was

00:09:58.556 --> 00:09:59.205
his Ph.D.
 

00:09:59.205 --> 00:10:00.360
dissertation.
 

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.004
But unlike many scholars whose
only good book is their

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:08.773
dissertation,
Durkheim followed it up with a

00:10:08.773 --> 00:10:11.490
number of good other books.
 

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.658
Many professors are actually
one book people,

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.976
or at least they should have
been, because their only good

00:10:19.976 --> 00:10:23.408
book was the dissertation and
what they published later only

00:10:23.408 --> 00:10:25.909
published because 'publish or
perish'--

00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:29.403
right?--to get tenure;
that's why they probably

00:10:29.403 --> 00:10:30.879
published too many books.
 

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:34.928
Anyway, he was inspired by
Montesquieu.

00:10:34.928 --> 00:10:40.749
Well Durkheim is very French,
and his roots are deeply in

00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:45.529
Montesquieu, and to some extent
in Rousseau;

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:47.860
he admired Rousseau as well.
 

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:55.240
But Montesquieu is really the
major inspiration behind him.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.946
And well what he does,
he uses law as a measure of

00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:05.860
social development--
much like Montesquieu did,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.640
sort of--
and he explains,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.155
by using the law,
the legal system how the

00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:19.230
division of labor evolved,
what were the stages of the

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.460
development of division of
labor.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.226
Well just a very brief
contrast.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:26.200
Right?
 

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:32.124
Marx was interested in economic
conflict--right?--in struggle

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:35.580
around scarce economic
resources.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.679
Weber was interested in
struggle for power.

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:41.120
So was Nietzsche.
 

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.908
Durkheim was interested in
social solidarity.

00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:49.960
Marx and Weber are conflict
theorists.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.340
They try to explain what breaks
up society.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.928
Durkheim is a theorist which
tries to understand what holds

00:11:58.928 --> 00:12:02.879
society together,
what brings us together,

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:05.962
why society is not falling
apart.

00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:07.120
Right?
 

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.970
Well in the book he makes a
crucial distinction between two

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.206
types of solidarity:
mechanical and organic

00:12:17.206 --> 00:12:18.720
solidarity.
 

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.610
And I will speak about this at
great length.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.455
This is another attempt to
develop a typology of evolution

00:12:29.455 --> 00:12:30.730
of societies.
 

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.817
You are already familiar with
Marx's modes of

00:12:33.817 --> 00:12:37.184
production--right?--the
evolution from slavery to

00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:39.149
feudalism to capitalism.
 

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:43.445
You are familiar with Max
Weber: traditional authority and

00:12:43.445 --> 00:12:45.480
legal-rational authority.
 

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.407
Now Durkheim's alternative is
mechanical and organic

00:12:50.407 --> 00:12:51.470
solidarity.
 

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.340
Right?
 

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:57.313
What Weber called traditional
authority is kind of mechanical

00:12:57.313 --> 00:13:01.245
solidarity for Durkheim;
or what Marx called

00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:06.110
pre-capitalist formations is
mechanical solidarity.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.977
Organic solidarity described
legal-rational authority or

00:13:10.977 --> 00:13:13.278
modernity or capitalism.
 

00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:19.350
Well he also identified
pathological forms of division

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.620
of labor, and this is what he
called anomie.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:30.253
And his idea of anomie is a
kind of similar or analogous

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:34.533
distinction,
what was alienation in Marx and

00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:37.629
what was disenchantment in
Weber--

00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:42.840
though there are very important
differences as well,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.178
and I will be talking about
this Thursday.

00:13:45.178 --> 00:13:49.491
Now on Suicide--as I
said, this is one of the first

00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:53.879
very rigorous empirical studies
of a social phenomenon--

00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:57.220
a phenomenon we think is not
quite social,

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.763
we think it is really an
individual decision whether you

00:14:00.763 --> 00:14:02.308
take your life or not.
 

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:06.568
But Durkheim actually was
capable to show that even in

00:14:06.568 --> 00:14:10.195
this very private action,
when you take your life,

00:14:10.195 --> 00:14:15.270
there are social determinants,
who is committing suicide or

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:15.850
not.
 

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.341
And he's making a distinction
between different types of

00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:22.331
suicide--
anomic, altruistic,

00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:28.421
egoistic and fatalistic ones--
and I will be talking about

00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:32.690
this after you return from
Thanksgiving's break.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.668
Now about the methodology.
 

00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:37.774
He was a methodological
collectivist,

00:14:37.774 --> 00:14:42.431
much like Montesquieu or
Rousseau, and very much unlike

00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:46.645
Hobbes, Locke or Mills;
you know, Marx being kind of

00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:50.889
halfway between methodological
individualism and collectivism.

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:54.738
As a theorist of revolutionary
consciousness,

00:14:54.738 --> 00:14:58.149
he was a methodological
collectivist.

00:14:58.149 --> 00:15:03.303
We will see Durkheim's notion
of collective conscience is not

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:08.629
all that different from Marx's
idea of class consciousness,

00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:11.740
which is not the sum
total--right?--

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.480
of the individual consciousness
of workers.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.336
But Marx, in his theory of
exploitation,

00:15:18.336 --> 00:15:23.774
as you have read his text,
reads almost like Adam Smith,

00:15:23.774 --> 00:15:25.751
or John Stuart Mill.
 

00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:26.840
Right?
 

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.105
It's self-interested,
rational individuals,

00:15:30.105 --> 00:15:34.149
from which he explains the
nature of exploitation.

00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:39.301
Well it's much more difficult
to figure out how Weber fits

00:15:39.301 --> 00:15:41.470
into these categories.
 

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.648
I think he's also vacillating
between collectivism and

00:15:45.648 --> 00:15:46.908
individualism.
 

00:15:46.908 --> 00:15:49.830
Later in his life he's becoming
more of a methodological

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:50.678
individualist.
 

00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:53.365
But Durkheim,
the consistency in Durkheim,

00:15:53.365 --> 00:15:56.966
is that from day one he's a
methodological collectivist,

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:59.980
and remains a methodological
collectivist.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.927
But at the same time he
believed in the existence of

00:16:04.927 --> 00:16:08.580
social facts,
and that social facts,

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.149
on the other hand,
can be observed with rigorous

00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:17.990
empirical methodology;
and this is what makes him,

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.418
in a way, a positivist.
 

00:16:20.418 --> 00:16:27.447
So this is just a brief
introduction to who the author

00:16:27.447 --> 00:16:28.110
is.
 

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.590
And now let me move to the
division of labor.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:58.779
&gt;
 

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:03.099
Well my computer is getting
slower, as the semester is

00:17:03.099 --> 00:17:04.240
progressing.
 

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.915
So it's probably time for the
semester to end,

00:17:07.915 --> 00:17:10.775
because my laptop,
though it is new,

00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:16.328
it still will become unbearably
slow by the end of the semester.

00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:21.430
Okay, so this is Émile
Durkheim and the division of

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.130
labor in society.
 

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:29.680
So how does Durkheim proceed in
the work?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.938
And today's presentation will
focus on the question why

00:17:35.938 --> 00:17:43.007
Durkheim begins the analysis by
taking the law as the point of

00:17:43.007 --> 00:17:44.630
departure.
 

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:56.236
And then we will proceed how he
makes the distinction between

00:17:56.236 --> 00:18:03.200
organic and mechanical
solidarity.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.676
So the question actually is,
for a methodological

00:18:07.676 --> 00:18:14.051
collectivist,
that you need to find some

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:21.769
collective expression,
in order to study society--not

00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:23.160
individuals.
 

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:29.469
And much like Montesquieu,
he believes that the law is

00:18:29.469 --> 00:18:36.212
such a collective phenomenon;
law, which can be studied and

00:18:36.212 --> 00:18:42.318
established without studying
individual views or individual

00:18:42.318 --> 00:18:43.267
opinions.
 

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:44.318
Right?
 

00:18:44.318 --> 00:18:51.112
It's parts of what--Durkheim's
terminology is the collective

00:18:51.112 --> 00:18:58.019
conscience, and which is above
individual consciousnesses.

00:18:58.019 --> 00:19:07.459
Okay, so that's--what are the
most important issues in the

00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:14.250
work, as far as we'll discuss it
today?

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.420
Well he's interested in
solidarity.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:25.938
As I pointed out,
we are--his real question is

00:19:25.938 --> 00:19:30.950
what holds society together?
 

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.198
We are so different,
societies should fall apart.

00:19:34.198 --> 00:19:34.740
Right?
 

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.538
He is writing in the late
nineteenth, early twentieth

00:19:38.538 --> 00:19:39.269
century.
 

00:19:39.269 --> 00:19:42.175
This is the time of
industrialization,

00:19:42.175 --> 00:19:43.588
of urbanization.
 

00:19:43.588 --> 00:19:48.940
People are dislodged from their
traditional communities,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.612
from the traditional villages,
pushed away from peasant

00:19:53.612 --> 00:19:56.967
agriculture,
and move into urban industrial

00:19:56.967 --> 00:19:57.788
employment.
 

00:19:57.788 --> 00:20:01.809
And the question is will
society break down,

00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:07.231
will social order break down,
if the traditional order does

00:20:07.231 --> 00:20:09.568
not keep us together?
 

00:20:09.568 --> 00:20:12.328
And this is what he tries to
figure out;

00:20:12.328 --> 00:20:18.079
what in a modern urban and
industrial society can keep us

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:19.210
together?
 

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.509
And he tries to find solidarity.
 

00:20:22.509 --> 00:20:31.069
And well what creates this
solidarity is collective

00:20:31.069 --> 00:20:33.808
consciousness.
 

00:20:33.808 --> 00:20:39.250
And the fundamental idea in
Durkheim about collective

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:44.929
consciousness--
as I said, it is analogous to

00:20:44.929 --> 00:20:50.980
the notion of the general will
in Rousseau,

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:56.220
or the notion of class
consciousness in Marx.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.578
So therefore it is not the sum
total of individual

00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:06.611
consciousnesses,
but something of shared norms,

00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:13.250
beliefs and values,
which exist prior an individual

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:17.878
is being born,
prior society actually existed,

00:21:17.878 --> 00:21:22.434
which is passed on from one
generation to the other.

00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:23.240
Right?
 

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.929
And therefore he tries to
show--right?--these collective

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:31.509
consciousnesses which persist
over time.

00:21:31.509 --> 00:21:34.867
And, of course,
the most obvious,

00:21:34.867 --> 00:21:40.430
most rigorous way to go about
this, to look at law.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.238
Because that's exactly what the
law is.

00:21:43.238 --> 00:21:43.828
Right?
 

00:21:43.828 --> 00:21:49.893
The law is changing over time,
but usually the change is very

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:54.338
slow and reaches over several
generations.

00:21:54.338 --> 00:21:59.770
So for somebody who is a French
social scientist,

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:05.088
and one unique--we already
talked about this.

00:22:05.088 --> 00:22:09.778
Well the French are very
methodological collectivists.

00:22:09.778 --> 00:22:14.028
The Anglo-Saxons tend to be
methodological individualists.

00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:17.570
And the French,
unlike the Germans,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:23.259
are very scientifique;
they are very much scientists.

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:30.259
The word scientifique in
German does not exist.

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:32.513
The Germans say,
"I'm

00:22:32.513 --> 00:22:37.434
Wissenschaftler";
Wissenschaft

00:22:37.434 --> 00:22:41.348
means--Wissen is
knowledge.

00:22:41.348 --> 00:22:47.480
Science in German is
constituted by all sorts of

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.785
knowledge.
 

00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:49.960
Right?
 

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.713
It's a much broader notion.
 

00:22:51.713 --> 00:22:52.170
Right?
 

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.396
In French, or in English,
with science we really mean

00:22:56.396 --> 00:23:00.298
rigorous science of the natural
science types.

00:23:00.298 --> 00:23:05.500
Well Durkheim did not go as far
as saying it is natural science.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.897
But certainly he was very
scientifique in

00:23:09.897 --> 00:23:14.483
insistence of rigorous analysis
of objective data.

00:23:14.483 --> 00:23:15.420
Right?
 

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.468
That's what--why the
Germans--Wiss

00:23:18.468 --> 00:23:22.278
enschaftler,
all those who study ideas are

00:23:22.278 --> 00:23:24.650
Wissenschaftlers.
 

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.368
It's a much broader notion.
 

00:23:27.368 --> 00:23:29.868
Natural scientists are also
Wissenschaftlers.

00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:33.986
But people who study humanities
and history of ideas are also

00:23:33.986 --> 00:23:35.769
Wissenschaftlers.
 

00:23:35.769 --> 00:23:40.182
People who are an expert on
Hobbes and spend their life

00:23:40.182 --> 00:23:43.451
writing on Hobbes is a
Wissenschaftler

00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:45.740
--right?--in German.
 

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.884
We can hardly say somebody who
does--right?--history of ideas

00:23:50.884 --> 00:23:52.428
to be a scientist.
 

00:23:52.428 --> 00:23:53.200
Right?
 

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.759
We are iffy.
 

00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:56.318
We call it humanities.
 

00:23:56.318 --> 00:24:00.846
We talk about social sciences
with a lot of anxiety,

00:24:00.846 --> 00:24:05.105
and real scientists ask us,
"Social science,

00:24:05.105 --> 00:24:06.970
what do you mean?
 

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.078
What is science about what you
are doing?"

00:24:09.078 --> 00:24:12.356
Well those of you who take
economics, they make sure it

00:24:12.356 --> 00:24:14.967
looks like science,
because you have all the

00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:16.910
equations on the blackboard.
 

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.970
So therefore a scientist can
relax.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:25.240
But if you are listening to my
lectures, and not a single

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.435
equation on the blackboard,
you probably have doubt that

00:24:29.435 --> 00:24:32.028
this is really social science.
 

00:24:32.028 --> 00:24:34.634
Anyway, he was
scientifique,

00:24:34.634 --> 00:24:38.769
in the sense of being very
rigorous in his analysis.

00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:46.895
Sort of what is collective
consciousness--I give here a

00:24:46.895 --> 00:24:49.454
citation for you.
 

00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:50.808
Right?
 

00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:57.346
It is a totality of beliefs and
sentiments which are common to

00:24:57.346 --> 00:25:03.026
the average member of
society--right?--but which has a

00:25:03.026 --> 00:25:04.740
life of its own.
 

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.920
Right?
 

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:13.210
That's what he calls collective
consciousness.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.384
So this is different from the
consciousnesses of the

00:25:17.384 --> 00:25:25.140
individuals;
though he's a scientist. Right?

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.028
He's scientifique.
 

00:25:27.028 --> 00:25:30.920
It has to be realized in
individuals.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.519
So therefore,
I mean, Durkheim would not

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:40.058
necessarily be opposed to carry
out even survey research,

00:25:40.058 --> 00:25:45.519
and ask individuals about their
customs or values,

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:50.328
and sort of aggregate this up
and try to find those patterns,

00:25:50.328 --> 00:25:53.559
especially over time and across
nations.

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:55.440
That's not really what he did.
 

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.838
But I think he would be open
for this kind of research,

00:25:59.838 --> 00:26:03.243
which, of course,
made him so influential in

00:26:03.243 --> 00:26:06.490
early American sociology in the
1930s,

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:11.248
'40s and '50s,
because American sociology has

00:26:11.248 --> 00:26:15.788
been very positivist and very
empirical.

00:26:15.788 --> 00:26:21.553
Well but the most obvious
example of collective conscience

00:26:21.553 --> 00:26:25.700
is the law--probably also the
language.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:31.102
Well there are differences in
law in pre-modern and modern

00:26:31.102 --> 00:26:32.240
societies.
 

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.939
Now we are getting into--he's
building the argument up to make

00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:43.882
the distinction between
mechanical and organic

00:26:43.882 --> 00:26:45.529
solidarity.
 

00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:50.598
And let me just go through of
this.

00:26:50.598 --> 00:26:57.538
&lt;&lt;technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:26:57.538 --> 00:27:03.934
So the argument is then in
pre-modern societies the law

00:27:03.934 --> 00:27:10.450
which existed is primarily a
repressive or penal law.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:17.901
Well there is--the purpose of
punishment is to punish evil

00:27:17.901 --> 00:27:19.338
behavior.
 

00:27:19.338 --> 00:27:24.630
And we tend to agree what is
evil behavior is,

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.568
and punishments therefore also
tends to be harsh,

00:27:28.568 --> 00:27:38.838
to prevent further aggressive
behavior by individuals.

00:27:38.838 --> 00:27:45.328
So this is the legal system of
pre-modern societies.

00:27:45.328 --> 00:27:49.670
Well I will give you a couple
of citations,

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.150
and I won't read them.
 

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:56.875
I will put them on the internet
and you can read it at your

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:57.690
leisure.
 

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:03.410
It kind of elaborates on the
points what I made.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:14.368
Okay, but in modern society the
legal system is very different.

00:28:14.368 --> 00:28:19.220
The legal system is based on
contract;

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.470
the essence of modern legal
system is contract.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.324
It's not that we do not have a
penal code--right?--the penal

00:28:26.324 --> 00:28:27.368
code survives.
 

00:28:27.368 --> 00:28:32.817
But what is novel is
contractual law,

00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:38.705
which is restitutive;
which is not about punishing

00:28:38.705 --> 00:28:42.660
evil, but simply restitute the
damage somebody,

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:47.300
by breaking a contract,
caused to the other contracting

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:47.988
partner.
 

00:28:47.988 --> 00:28:49.019
Right?
 

00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:53.133
And he said,
well this is a new type of law

00:28:53.133 --> 00:28:56.170
which emerges with modernity.
 

00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:03.328
Marx would say it is a new
legal system which emerges with

00:29:03.328 --> 00:29:06.026
legal--
with capitalism,

00:29:06.026 --> 00:29:11.507
and Weber would say this is the
essence of legal-rational

00:29:11.507 --> 00:29:12.779
authority.
 

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:24.250
Well why does he study law?
 

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.548
I don't want to elaborate on
this too long.

00:29:27.548 --> 00:29:34.025
That's obvious-- that the legal
system is the single best

00:29:34.025 --> 00:29:38.420
measure of what he tries to get
at,

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.251
collective conscience,
which can be studied the most

00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:43.153
objectively.
 

00:29:43.153 --> 00:29:43.828
Right?
 

00:29:43.828 --> 00:29:48.721
There are law books and legal
practices and minutes of

00:29:48.721 --> 00:29:52.230
recordings how the courts
operated,

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.950
and how law was made and
implemented,

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:01.808
which can be studied with a
great level of rigor.

00:30:01.808 --> 00:30:06.498
For instance,
it's very easy to study whether

00:30:06.498 --> 00:30:11.400
indeed contractual law is a new
form of law.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:16.085
You can go back to legal
history and to establish exactly

00:30:16.085 --> 00:30:18.680
when contractual law emerged.
 

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:24.261
This was actually also very
much on the mind of the young

00:30:24.261 --> 00:30:27.338
Weber,
when he was also looking at

00:30:27.338 --> 00:30:32.021
basically the emergence of
contractual law in late medieval

00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:36.680
Italy,
in his Ph.D.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.618
for the law degree.
 

00:30:38.618 --> 00:30:43.090
I think I already made this
point, what is interesting,

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:47.480
that Durkheim and Weber sort of
ignored each other.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.740
I don't think they ever cited
each other.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.327
I don't recall ever seeing a
citation to one another,

00:30:55.327 --> 00:30:59.210
though they were working on the
same area.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:03.118
Of course, they both did speak
both of the languages,

00:31:03.118 --> 00:31:06.501
and they were,
of course, aware that the other

00:31:06.501 --> 00:31:07.778
giant exists.
 

00:31:07.778 --> 00:31:09.884
They were probably,
in many ways,

00:31:09.884 --> 00:31:13.373
too close--too much in
competition with each other--to

00:31:13.373 --> 00:31:14.690
cite each other.
 

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.376
I mentioned already that
Durkheim did review Marianne

00:31:19.376 --> 00:31:22.624
Weber's book,
but never any of Weber's books,

00:31:22.624 --> 00:31:26.502
though Marianne was writing--
right?--about marriage law,

00:31:26.502 --> 00:31:30.058
which was of marginal interest
to Durkheim,

00:31:30.058 --> 00:31:33.766
and Weber was writing on
religion, which was so central

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.618
for Durkheim's interests.
 

00:31:35.618 --> 00:31:40.558
Nevertheless they kind of
ignored each other.

00:31:40.558 --> 00:31:44.769
Now about the two types of
solidarity.

00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:50.625
Well mechanical
solidarity--it's hard to

00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:54.680
remember the distinction.
 

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.574
One would think organic
solidarity must be

00:31:57.574 --> 00:32:01.740
old--right?--and mechanical must
be modern, the machines.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.019
Now the opposite is true.
 

00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:08.250
I kept making these mistakes
for the first two or three years

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:12.269
when I was reading Durkheim,
some forty-five years ago.

00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:20.613
Well mechanical solidarity is
which describes pre-modern

00:32:20.613 --> 00:32:29.107
societies, and this is a
solidarity which is based on the

00:32:29.107 --> 00:32:33.660
similarities of the parts.
 

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:39.250
Well this is why you can have a
penal law, because a penal law

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:44.660
does not make a distinction
between contractual partners;

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.308
it assumes a sameness of the
group as such.

00:32:49.308 --> 00:32:56.056
And mechanical
solidarity--right?--as I said,

00:32:56.056 --> 00:33:05.868
is primarily based that we see
ourselves similar in the group.

00:33:05.868 --> 00:33:10.458
Organic solidarity,
so will Durkheim argue,

00:33:10.458 --> 00:33:15.920
is one which is based on
differences in society.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.765
A higher level of division of
labor in society produces

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:22.650
organic solidarity.
 

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.615
Organic, he meant,
it is a kind of biological

00:33:25.615 --> 00:33:26.288
analogy.
 

00:33:26.288 --> 00:33:29.914
Modern societies,
like the human body.

00:33:29.914 --> 00:33:30.700
Right?
 

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.571
There are functional
differences between the human

00:33:33.571 --> 00:33:34.098
organs.
 

00:33:34.098 --> 00:33:36.525
That's why it is organic
solidarity.

00:33:36.525 --> 00:33:37.078
Right?
 

00:33:37.078 --> 00:33:40.986
The heart performs a different
function than the lung,

00:33:40.986 --> 00:33:44.301
but the lung could not live
without the heart.

00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:45.038
Right?
 

00:33:45.038 --> 00:33:47.818
This is why this is organic
solidarity.

00:33:47.818 --> 00:33:51.608
Society operates more like an
organism.

00:33:51.608 --> 00:33:55.450
In earlier times,
society was more operating like

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:59.368
a machine where you actually--a
part is taken out,

00:33:59.368 --> 00:34:02.890
mechanically it doesn't matter
all that much.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:03.849
Right?
 

00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:06.269
It is a simple machine, I mean.
 

00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:10.309
So that's the fundamental
distinction.

00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:14.146
By the way, also for
Durkheim--and this is also in

00:34:14.146 --> 00:34:18.744
the text what you are reading--
this distinction between

00:34:18.744 --> 00:34:23.278
mechanical and organic
solidarity is developed in order

00:34:23.278 --> 00:34:26.050
to describe societies as such.
 

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:30.715
But much like Weber's notion of
traditional authority and

00:34:30.715 --> 00:34:37.246
legal-rational authority,
he is also using this to

00:34:37.246 --> 00:34:42.518
understand society--
social solidarities in

00:34:42.518 --> 00:34:43.900
contemporary life.
 

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:52.456
So mechanical solidarity does
exist in contemporary society as

00:34:52.456 --> 00:34:53.440
well.
 

00:34:53.440 --> 00:35:00.978
And he makes this reference to
finding a marital partner,

00:35:00.978 --> 00:35:08.920
whom we want to date with,
and whom we consider to marry.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:14.934
And occasionally we are--we try
to find somebody who is more

00:35:14.934 --> 00:35:19.291
similar than we are,
and people will say,

00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:22.610
"Well you look
like"--

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:23.990
if you are
heterosexual--"like

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.170
brothers and sisters".
 

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.925
Or if you are gay,
"Well you look like

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:30.289
brothers"
or "You look like

00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:31.208
sisters."
 

00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:31.929
Right?
 

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:34.320
You look the same,
you look similar.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.998
And that can be--right?--a
consideration for a lasting

00:35:37.998 --> 00:35:38.969
partnership.
 

00:35:38.969 --> 00:35:43.280
I'm trying to find somebody who
likes the same stuff what I

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.840
like, who is like me.
 

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.510
Right?
 

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.172
But it can be the opposite as
well.

00:35:48.172 --> 00:35:48.800
Right?
 

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.635
You may be looking for a
person--you may follow the logic

00:35:52.635 --> 00:35:56.195
of organic solidarity,
right?--you may be looking for

00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:58.387
a person who will complement
you.

00:35:58.387 --> 00:35:59.210
Right?
 

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:04.778
I'm bad in keeping the books,
and therefore what I am trying

00:36:04.778 --> 00:36:09.876
to look for is somebody who will
balance the checkbook.

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:10.820
Right?
 

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:16.208
So occasionally looking for a
partner, we are looking for

00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:19.480
somebody who will complement us.
 

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.092
Now that
describes--right?--modern

00:36:22.092 --> 00:36:26.210
society, with a higher level of
division of labor.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:31.329
Division of labor,
he said, can bring us together,

00:36:31.329 --> 00:36:36.762
much like the bodily organism,
that we are performing

00:36:36.762 --> 00:36:40.420
different functions in society.
 

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:45.257
We complement each other--we
need each other--on the basis of

00:36:45.257 --> 00:36:49.130
our differences,
rather than our similarities.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:54.539
And, in fact,
the contractual law expresses

00:36:54.539 --> 00:37:00.079
the spirit of organic solidarity
as such.

00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:05.588
Well Durkheim will show us that
there is, in fact,

00:37:05.588 --> 00:37:11.434
a lot of trouble in the
transition from mechanical to

00:37:11.434 --> 00:37:17.076
organic solidarity;
and this is what he will call

00:37:17.076 --> 00:37:17.920
anomie.
 

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.458
In the transition from
mechanical to organic

00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:24.063
solidarity,
moving from a traditional

00:37:24.063 --> 00:37:28.152
society to a modern society,
our value system breaks down,

00:37:28.152 --> 00:37:31.869
we find ourselves in the
situation of anomie.

00:37:31.869 --> 00:37:36.610
But this is a topic I will be
talking about Thursday.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:38.860
Thank you very much.
 

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:44.000

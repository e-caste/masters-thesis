00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.566
Professor Donald
Kagan: We were examining

00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:09.178
Sparta, the most important,
I think, of the early

00:00:09.178 --> 00:00:12.216
poleis,
certainly once you get into the

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:17.300
seventh and sixth centuries.
And I was describing the formal

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.991
constitution of the Spartans,
having mentioned the kings and

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:26.943
the gerousia,
the council of elders

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:31.567
consisting of twenty-eight
elected men over sixty and the

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:34.870
two kings to create a body of
thirty.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.272
Then there is the Spartan
Assembly which consists of all

00:00:41.272 --> 00:00:47.113
the adult male Spartan citizens,
and as in most states,

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:52.249
it really originated from the
idea of having the fighting men

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:57.214
participate in decisions and
they're the kinds of decisions

00:00:57.214 --> 00:01:02.950
that undoubtedly were the first
decisions the assemblies made.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.032
And in the case of Sparta,
I would guess almost the only

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:10.966
decisions they made were
questions of whether to go to

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.217
war,
whether to make peace,

00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:16.230
whether to make alliances and
so forth.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.431
Now, it's worth mentioning
that that assembly--you want to

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:22.685
distinguish that assembly from
what I'll describe shortly about

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:25.750
the Athenian Assembly.
In this assembly,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.650
it is true that all adult male
Spartans were participants,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.903
and let me also say that they
came to the meeting dressed in

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:41.367
their military uniform,
apparently including their

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:46.360
shields, because when a question
was put to the Spartans,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.989
the way they responded was by
shouting and banging on their

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.941
shields.
Whereupon, the presiding

00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:59.647
official would try to determine
which side had the loudest

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:02.888
noise.
It's like a voice vote in one

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:06.506
of our own meetings,
only a little bit more

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:09.224
colorful.
And only, of course,

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:13.771
if the presiding official
decided that he couldn't tell

00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:18.261
which side had the most noise,
would they resort to a

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:22.775
separation like the British
Parliament, those in favor over

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.055
on that side,
those opposed on the other

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:30.439
side, and he would count and out
would come the result.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:37.076
It looks as though the
debates in the assembly were

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:43.098
probably infrequent,
because as best we can figure

00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:46.459
it out,
we would guess that most issues

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.830
that came before the
assembly--let me back up and say

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.590
probably not very many issues
came before the assembly,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.300
but those that did,
if there was an agreement on

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.090
the part of the gerousia
and the kings,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.496
in other words,
the upper groups in society,

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:08.139
if they agreed there would be
no need to go,

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.710
there might be some legal need
to go to the assembly,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.576
but there would be no debate
and the matter would simply go

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:15.853
forward.
However, some scholars go far

00:03:15.853 --> 00:03:19.163
too far in suggesting that there
never was a debate in the

00:03:19.163 --> 00:03:21.937
assembly.
There are debates reported to

00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:25.232
us in Thucydides,
which make it perfectly clear

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:28.815
that they did,
but it is worth pointing out

00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:33.969
that so far as our information
goes, the only people who spoke

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.180
at those assemblies were the
kings,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.815
the gerousia,
or a group of people I haven't

00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:45.710
mentioned to you yet,
the ephors,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.997
the five ephors.
I'll describe their situation

00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:52.584
for you, but for the moment they
are annually elected officials

00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:56.726
of the state.
In short, the average Spartan

00:03:56.726 --> 00:04:02.050
did not ever speak in the
assembly, it appears.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.667
So it's not a democratic
assembly, even though every

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:08.860
single citizen is there,
if he wants to be.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.121
So, that's part of the mixed
and rather confusing aspect of

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:19.166
the assembly.
Let me turn now to the

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:21.943
ephors.
These, according to Spartan

00:04:21.943 --> 00:04:26.305
tradition, were invented
somewhat late in the development

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:30.578
of the Spartan constitution.
The word ephor comes

00:04:30.578 --> 00:04:34.707
from the word which means to
oversee, to oversee what's going

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.773
on.
They were, in a certain sense,

00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:40.951
the overseers.
One of their duties was to keep

00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:44.115
watch on the kings and to see
that the kings didn't do

00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:47.388
anything improper,
illegal, irreligious,

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:52.676
or anything of that kind,
and some scholars have focused

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:56.971
on that and suggested that,
at least originally,

00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:59.582
that was what their main
function was:

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:02.970
to protect the Spartans from
excessive power,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.948
excessive behavior by the
kings, and that their sort of

00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:11.370
watching the king's thing was
always their chief function.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.554
That, I think, is not right.
I think by the time the

00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:19.107
Spartans appear to us in
history, let us say late in the

00:05:19.107 --> 00:05:22.853
sixth century and fifth century,
the ephors don't do

00:05:22.853 --> 00:05:25.233
that.
I mean, they still have the

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:28.250
technical constitutional
requirement to do that,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.689
but that's not what they're up
too.

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.909
When we see them they are
usually engaged in dealing with

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.354
foreign policy.
So, if a neighboring state

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:42.268
wanted to communicate something
to the Spartans,

00:05:42.268 --> 00:05:47.180
either it might be an offer of
an alliance or it might be an

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.509
order to do something or else
war would follow,

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.135
or a negotiation for peace,
any of those things,

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:56.649
first they would come to the
ephors,

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.622
of which there were five and
the ephors would then

00:06:00.622 --> 00:06:03.905
decide what should be done.
I would say,

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:07.350
in most cases,
they would, unless it was very,

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.719
very serious,
they would be able to give some

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:14.425
sort of answer to it,
but when it involved something

00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:17.000
fundamental like war and peace
or alliances,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.773
then they would have to go to
the assembly to get their

00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:25.763
approval.
But my guess is that it would

00:06:25.763 --> 00:06:29.328
have been wildly reckless and
therefore never done for the

00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:32.829
ephors not to go to the
gerousia first,

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:37.369
because the gerousia
was, by far, the most

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:40.680
significant council in the
state,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.700
most able to have the necessary
prestige and yet to be small

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.870
enough truly to discuss what
needed to be done.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.464
And since the gerousia
included the kings,

00:06:52.464 --> 00:06:55.329
it involved the most important
people in the state.

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:58.118
So, if the ephors wanted
to do something,

00:06:58.118 --> 00:07:00.967
it would be damn foolish not to
clear it with the

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:05.224
gerousia first;
although if they wished to be

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:08.500
reckless, they could do
otherwise.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.456
Now, another thing about
the ephors is that

00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:12.800
they're very different.
The people who are elected to

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.740
the gerousia are old men
who have proven themselves,

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.285
they are truly elected by a
process in which their

00:07:19.285 --> 00:07:21.889
individual qualities are
relevant,

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:26.339
and so they have tremendous
prestige in the Spartan state.

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:29.939
This is not true necessarily
and typically of the

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:34.376
ephors.
Aristotle tells us that they in

00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:40.849
fact were just any Joe Spartan,
that they were ordinary people,

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:46.033
not distinguished in any way.
Although we don't have a clear

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:48.860
picture of the way in which they
were chosen,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.955
it is clear that they were--it
looked it was some kind of a

00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:57.470
combination of election and
sortition;

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.428
there's a strong element of
chance involved in selecting who

00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:05.552
was going to be an ephor.
So, you must think of them,

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:09.577
not as distinguished people who
have some clout in their own

00:08:09.577 --> 00:08:11.900
person,
but ordinary people who only

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.298
achieve what clout they're going
to have by virtue of being

00:08:15.298 --> 00:08:19.000
chosen as ephors.
They're only there for a year.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.790
Now, the kings are there
for life and the gerousia

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.052
is there for life,
and I suppose the assembly is

00:08:25.052 --> 00:08:28.671
there for life,
but the ephors are only

00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:33.335
going to be ephors for a
year and only once in their

00:08:33.335 --> 00:08:35.854
life.
These are not politically

00:08:35.854 --> 00:08:39.129
powerful people.
I think the idea was to sort of

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:43.213
have a representation of the
ordinary Spartan to carry on the

00:08:43.213 --> 00:08:45.799
functions that I have talked
about.

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:48.394
On the other hand,
they were given the

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:52.602
responsibility of seeing that
the kings were in line and they

00:08:52.602 --> 00:08:56.459
had various techniques or
various policies and processes

00:08:56.459 --> 00:09:00.877
which had them make judgments as
to whether the kings were doing

00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:04.053
anything wrong,
and if they did,

00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:08.822
they could make that point.
They could go to Delphi and ask

00:09:08.822 --> 00:09:12.692
the god, if they were right in
thinking something was wrong,

00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:16.429
and if they came back the kings
would be put on trial.

00:09:16.429 --> 00:09:20.507
The ephors would be the
accusers, the trial would be

00:09:20.507 --> 00:09:24.374
held in the gerousia,
and don't imagine that that

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:27.926
didn't matter.
Kings were brought to trial in

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:32.347
this way frequently in the
history of Sparta and very often

00:09:32.347 --> 00:09:36.007
they were convicted,
and often exiled,

00:09:36.007 --> 00:09:41.307
and in other ways punished.
So, there's nothing just

00:09:41.307 --> 00:09:46.699
theoretical about this capacity
to control them and something

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:51.373
rather important about this
accidental element in who

00:09:51.373 --> 00:09:54.893
becomes an ephor.
All right,

00:09:54.893 --> 00:09:58.873
those are the elements of the
Spartan constitution and I think

00:09:58.873 --> 00:10:02.265
it's self evident that it
deserves a title of a mixed

00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:04.299
constitution.
At the same time,

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:07.385
you don't want to lose sight of
something even more basic than

00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:09.627
that.
Remember that all the

00:10:09.627 --> 00:10:14.090
Spartiates that there are,
whether they are ordinary

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.766
citizens,
all the way up through king,

00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:23.677
are a small minority of all the
people who are under the control

00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:27.393
of the Spartans.
People try to guess from the

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:30.845
evidence that we have what
percentage of the entire

00:10:30.845 --> 00:10:34.780
population of the Peloponnesus
or of their own part of the

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.679
Peloponnesus the Spartans
were--well,

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:41.782
it looks as though the number
of Helots may have been

00:10:41.782 --> 00:10:45.490
something like seven Helots to
every Spartan.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.599
Then you have to add to that
the number of perioikoi

00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:55.227
who were also not Spartiates.
So, whatever the mixed

00:10:55.227 --> 00:10:59.607
character of the constitution
was, when you look at the whole

00:10:59.607 --> 00:11:04.279
of Laconia and its possessions,
it is very much an oligarchy.

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:09.214
The Spartans normally will like
to see other states

00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:13.682
oligarchically governed.
They will not like to see

00:11:13.682 --> 00:11:17.213
either extreme.
They won't like democracies and

00:11:17.213 --> 00:11:21.094
they won't like any form of
autocracy which in Greece

00:11:21.094 --> 00:11:23.929
typically took the form of
tyranny.

00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:28.264
So, the Spartans gain a
reputation of being--because

00:11:28.264 --> 00:11:32.940
they often fight against
tyrants--they gain a reputation

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.995
of being hostile to tyranny,
which brings our attention to

00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:42.747
the subject of foreign policy,
very important for Sparta and

00:11:42.747 --> 00:11:46.918
for the Greek world,
because as I think I mentioned

00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:51.710
before, the Spartans became the
first state to be in command,

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.542
or in control,
or to be the leaders of a

00:11:54.542 --> 00:11:58.706
coalition of states.
Not for a specific purpose

00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:04.431
only, but a permanent coalition
of states which the ancient

00:12:04.431 --> 00:12:09.860
Greeks referred to as the
Spartans and their allies,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.117
which modern scholars have come
to call the Peloponnesian

00:12:13.117 --> 00:12:16.664
League, and I guess I will use
that term and you'll see it all

00:12:16.664 --> 00:12:20.245
over the place.
It's an imprecise term

00:12:20.245 --> 00:12:25.861
because some of the members of
the--let me say a better term

00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:29.669
for it would be the Spartan
alliance,

00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:32.700
which is what pretty much the
Greeks called it,

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.586
because not everybody in the
Peloponnese was a member of the

00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:40.407
Peloponnesian League and not
every member of the league was

00:12:40.407 --> 00:12:43.963
in the Peloponnesus,
but still we all will know what

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:47.115
we're talking about when we
speak of the Peloponnesian

00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:49.582
League.
I shall try to remember to

00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:53.039
speak of the Spartan alliance
most of the time.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.789
Well, how did it come to
exist?

00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:58.350
Again, as in most things in
Greek history,

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.035
the beginnings are shrouded in
legend and are not absolutely

00:13:02.035 --> 00:13:06.380
clear,
but perhaps the place to start

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:12.619
is to say maybe around 570 B.C.
The Spartans who had been

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:18.065
successful apparently in turning
around, to some considerable

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:23.511
degree their defeat back in the
seventh century in fight with

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:28.594
Argos and were expanding their
influence and power in the

00:13:28.594 --> 00:13:33.906
Peloponnesus,
suffered a defeat in the region

00:13:33.906 --> 00:13:39.883
of Arcadia to the north of
Laconia--that by the way is

00:13:39.883 --> 00:13:44.620
mountainous country and poor
typically,

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.136
relatively speaking and it
provided some of the toughest

00:13:49.136 --> 00:13:53.151
warriors in the Greek world.
So, it's no miracle that the

00:13:53.151 --> 00:13:55.090
Spartans had a hard time up
there.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.001
It looks as though at that
point, that somebody in Sparta

00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:05.000
came up with a bright idea which
changed the nature of the

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.527
Spartan situation,
and also introduced something

00:14:09.527 --> 00:14:13.379
new into the Greek world at the
same time.

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:20.370
They defeated the town of
Tegea, which is located just to

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.505
the north of Laconia.
It's a very important state for

00:14:24.505 --> 00:14:26.289
the Spartans,
not just because it's the

00:14:26.289 --> 00:14:28.120
neighbor right to the north of
them,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.794
but because remember what I
told you, if you want to get to

00:14:30.794 --> 00:14:33.470
Mycenae from Sparta you can't go
across those mountains,

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.929
you got to go up north and then
go left, go west into Mycenae.

00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:41.470
Tegea is right there where the
road turns west.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:45.230
So, its strategic importance is
very great.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:50.664
The Spartans got into this war
with Tegea and they gained

00:14:50.664 --> 00:14:56.196
control of Tegea where they
claimed to have discovered the

00:14:56.196 --> 00:15:02.825
bones of the great Homeric hero,
Orestes and taken it away from

00:15:02.825 --> 00:15:08.260
Tegea, the bones I mean,
and buried them at Sparta.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.109
Also, there was a legend
that maybe they propagated that

00:15:15.109 --> 00:15:17.250
showed up in some poetry we
have,

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.686
that Agamemnon had moved from
his home base in Mycenae to

00:15:21.686 --> 00:15:24.642
Sparta, an attempt,
in other words,

00:15:24.642 --> 00:15:29.382
to connect these Dorian
Spartans with the legends of the

00:15:29.382 --> 00:15:33.950
great men of the Achaean world
described by Homer.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.274
Finally, we are told late in
the sixth century,

00:15:37.274 --> 00:15:41.466
King Cleomenes who was one of
the aggressive Spartan rulers

00:15:41.466 --> 00:15:44.139
who expanded the power of
Sparta,

00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:48.639
said on one occasion,
"I am no Dorian,

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:52.840
I am an Achaean."
What's this all about?

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.069
Well, it looks like as the
Spartans begin to extend this

00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:59.240
league that I will be telling
you about in a minute,

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.792
they want to reduce the amount
of resistance that they're going

00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:07.553
to get into.
Dorian's versus Achaeans still

00:16:07.553 --> 00:16:11.379
seems to have some meaning to
the Greeks.

00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:15.305
Remember the business about
what happened in Sicyon when the

00:16:15.305 --> 00:16:19.030
tyrants of Sicyon made this
sharp distinction in favor of

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.344
Achaeans against Dorians.
It suggests that that division

00:16:23.344 --> 00:16:28.272
among the Greek peoples hadn't
died down yet and I think that's

00:16:28.272 --> 00:16:32.867
what's going on here.
Spartans are trying to claim

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:37.570
union with the Achaeans not
dominance over them.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:41.089
Anyway, nonetheless,
the Spartans start taking on

00:16:41.089 --> 00:16:45.015
other Greek states trying to
establish their domination and

00:16:45.015 --> 00:16:49.731
are very successful.
They defeated the powerful and

00:16:49.731 --> 00:16:55.295
important state of Argos.
And in the process they took

00:16:55.295 --> 00:17:01.169
away a piece of land that is
between the area of Argos and

00:17:01.169 --> 00:17:05.314
Sparta,
the name of it is Cynuria and

00:17:05.314 --> 00:17:10.039
they took it away,
next to their own state.

00:17:10.039 --> 00:17:12.753
That's interesting,
because the Argives never

00:17:12.753 --> 00:17:16.700
forgave that and never gave up
on the idea of getting it back.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.932
You find the Argives and the
Spartans fighting each other at

00:17:19.932 --> 00:17:22.891
least once a century and what
they're fighting about is

00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:26.988
gaining control of Cynuria.
Its common people referred to

00:17:26.988 --> 00:17:31.289
Cynuria as the Alsace-Lorraine
of the Peloponnesus.

00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:34.092
Everybody who doesn't have it
and wants it back between these

00:17:34.092 --> 00:17:34.700
two states.

00:17:37.809 --> 00:17:41.931
Finally, the Spartans also take
the island just off the

00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:46.130
southeastern edge of the
Peloponnesus called Cythera,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:50.461
which gives them a good
strategic base there as well,

00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:54.257
so they are expanding.
Now, what happens--I'll go

00:17:54.257 --> 00:17:57.732
back to Tegea for a moment
because that's the first case we

00:17:57.732 --> 00:18:01.441
hear and it's the model.
When they defeat the Tegeans,

00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:04.470
instead of simply annexing
their territory,

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.333
subordinating the people,
or subjecting the people to

00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:11.269
Spartan rule,
they do something different.

00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:15.880
They offer the Tegeans an
alliance.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.072
The character of the alliance,
certainly in the full fledged

00:18:20.072 --> 00:18:23.482
history of the Spartan
alliance--we can't be sure

00:18:23.482 --> 00:18:27.817
whether the words I'm going to
speak to you now were all there

00:18:27.817 --> 00:18:31.725
in the original oath that the
Spartans made their allies

00:18:31.725 --> 00:18:34.262
swear,
but it was there by the end of

00:18:34.262 --> 00:18:37.071
the fifth century anyway.
I think something like it,

00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:40.072
either was in the oath or was
understood, and that is:

00:18:40.072 --> 00:18:42.109
the state that was defeated
said,

00:18:42.109 --> 00:18:47.814
agreed to accept the leadership
of Sparta, and the word that's

00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:52.209
involved here is
hegemonia and the leader

00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:58.007
is called a hegemon and
that is something different from

00:18:58.007 --> 00:19:02.759
being your master here,
your despotes.

00:19:02.759 --> 00:19:07.637
It's a little bit less,
or at least you want it to seem

00:19:07.637 --> 00:19:12.604
that way and to have the same
friends and enemies as the

00:19:12.604 --> 00:19:17.111
Spartans had,
and to follow them wherever the

00:19:17.111 --> 00:19:21.876
Spartans should lead.
A short way of saying it

00:19:21.876 --> 00:19:26.810
was that they turned their
foreign policy over to the

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:31.460
Spartans and accepted their
leadership in war.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.916
What do they get in exchange?
One, the Spartans didn't take

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:37.348
away their land,
destroy their houses,

00:19:37.348 --> 00:19:40.109
make them slaves or anything
like that.

00:19:40.109 --> 00:19:43.880
Besides that,
they also provided them,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:50.095
promised them and provided them
protection against attack from

00:19:50.095 --> 00:19:53.930
somebody else.
When the Peloponnesian League

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.448
is in place, one of its
consequences for most of the

00:19:57.448 --> 00:20:00.156
time,
is the end of warfare between

00:20:00.156 --> 00:20:02.684
the states inside the
Peloponnesus,

00:20:02.684 --> 00:20:06.180
at least that was the
theoretical situation.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.865
As we shall see,
it will be broken from time to

00:20:09.865 --> 00:20:12.910
time, but still it's generally
true.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.815
So now, what does this mean?
The Spartans have done

00:20:15.815 --> 00:20:18.713
something that is similar to
what the Romans would do

00:20:18.713 --> 00:20:22.057
centuries later and really an
enormous achievement if you can

00:20:22.057 --> 00:20:24.554
do it.
When you conquer people,

00:20:24.554 --> 00:20:28.457
one of the problems you have,
is every state you conquer is

00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:31.582
potentially a problem.
You have to rule it,

00:20:31.582 --> 00:20:35.981
and that's going to take more
soldiers and you will have to do

00:20:35.981 --> 00:20:39.688
something with them.
You acquire responsibilities

00:20:39.688 --> 00:20:43.711
that are greater than they used
to be, but the point is,

00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:46.930
normally you don't gain any
fighting men.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:53.309
Spartan way of doing it means
you gain more troops for your

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:56.916
army.
When the Spartans go to their

00:20:56.916 --> 00:21:02.394
allies, and they want to go war,
they tell them send your

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:07.090
allotment of troops to the place
we tell you,

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.740
on the day we tell you.
That allotment could well be

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.287
two-thirds of their army.
They will go to where the

00:21:16.287 --> 00:21:20.883
Spartans want to go and the
general of the army overall will

00:21:20.883 --> 00:21:24.212
be a Spartan,
and they will be fighting for

00:21:24.212 --> 00:21:27.659
Spartan purposes,
unless the Spartans have chosen

00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:30.460
to fight for their allies'
purposes.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.962
But the Spartans now have
increased their military

00:21:33.962 --> 00:21:37.822
strength enormously by the
invention of this new thing,

00:21:37.822 --> 00:21:43.649
the Spartan Alliance.
Now, the debate continues

00:21:43.649 --> 00:21:51.450
to exist as to just what that
alliance was really like.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:56.085
Were the Spartans free to do
anything that they liked in

00:21:56.085 --> 00:22:01.227
foreign affairs or did they need
to have the approval of their

00:22:01.227 --> 00:22:05.246
allies before going to war?
I'm talking now about a

00:22:05.246 --> 00:22:08.549
constitutional question rather
than reality question.

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:11.089
Scholars bat it around both
ways;

00:22:11.089 --> 00:22:15.145
my prejudices are that the
leagues' constitution,

00:22:15.145 --> 00:22:19.286
whatever it may have been,
was less important than

00:22:19.286 --> 00:22:21.761
reality.
That is to say,

00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:26.730
not all states in the Spartan
Alliance were equal.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:33.099
Some were large and numerous,
and strong militarily.

00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:39.891
Some were also wealth,
and some were at some distance

00:22:39.891 --> 00:22:43.484
from Sparta.
Others were small,

00:22:43.484 --> 00:22:46.720
weak, poor, and close to
Sparta.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.362
I would say,
and I think the evidence will

00:22:49.362 --> 00:22:52.649
support this as a fact,
whatever the theory may have

00:22:52.649 --> 00:22:54.937
been,
that the closer you were to

00:22:54.937 --> 00:22:58.099
Sparta the smaller you were,
the weaker you were,

00:22:58.099 --> 00:23:01.090
the more you did what the
Spartans told you.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.359
How's that for a shock?
And vice versa.

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:06.960
The stronger,
the more distant,

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.466
the wealthier you were,
the more independent you were

00:23:11.466 --> 00:23:16.059
of the Spartans.I would say
much of the time,

00:23:16.059 --> 00:23:18.808
most of the time,
people did what the Spartans

00:23:18.808 --> 00:23:22.135
wanted them to do.
But we have many occasions in

00:23:22.135 --> 00:23:26.418
which states refused to do so
and even get in the way of the

00:23:26.418 --> 00:23:28.878
Spartans.
Now, I think the Spartans very

00:23:28.878 --> 00:23:31.738
often when they had to do
something called a meeting of

00:23:31.738 --> 00:23:35.502
the Spartan Alliance,
consulted their allies,

00:23:35.502 --> 00:23:41.895
but it's not necessary true
that they took a vote as to what

00:23:41.895 --> 00:23:45.610
the allies thought;
sometimes they did.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:49.559
I think sometimes they didn't;
it all depended on the

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:52.737
situation.
If you want your allies to come

00:23:52.737 --> 00:23:57.455
and fight with you it's better
to have them to do so willingly

00:23:57.455 --> 00:24:00.664
than under orders,
and so that will explain,

00:24:00.664 --> 00:24:03.515
in my opinion,
some of the reasons for calling

00:24:03.515 --> 00:24:05.859
it a Peloponnesian League
meeting,

00:24:05.859 --> 00:24:09.710
not necessarily that they were
required to do so.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.102
But I've given you a mixed and
rather vague picture,

00:24:13.102 --> 00:24:15.630
and I think that's the real
picture.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.797
I think you can't be very
sure, either because this

00:24:18.797 --> 00:24:22.492
evidence doesn't allow us to be
sure how the league was supposed

00:24:22.492 --> 00:24:24.779
to work and how it really did
work,

00:24:24.779 --> 00:24:30.431
but I also think nobody could
tell in advance how it was going

00:24:30.431 --> 00:24:35.250
to work, whatever the understood
constitution was.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.845
After all, one of the most
important things that is

00:24:38.845 --> 00:24:41.650
involved in membership in the
league,

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.463
is that when the Spartans say,
I want you to come and fight

00:24:45.463 --> 00:24:49.151
with me for these purposes,
you come and you bring your

00:24:49.151 --> 00:24:51.593
army to do it,
but we have a period in

00:24:51.593 --> 00:24:55.024
Thucydides' account of the
Peloponnesian War in which

00:24:55.024 --> 00:24:58.060
important states like Corinth
and Thebes,

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.398
among others, simply say "no."
And when the Spartans say,

00:25:02.398 --> 00:25:05.035
why aren't you doing what
you're supposed to do,

00:25:05.035 --> 00:25:08.458
they come up with a very nice
cock-and-bull story supported by

00:25:08.458 --> 00:25:11.881
theoretically religious motives
why they can't do what they're

00:25:11.881 --> 00:25:15.359
supposed to do and the Spartans
have to put up with it;

00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:16.990
there's nothing they can do
about it.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.679
So I think,
now that I've mentioned the

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:23.457
constitutional technicalities,
I think the real thing to ask

00:25:23.457 --> 00:25:27.299
in each case is what are the
realities of the situation,

00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:31.370
and by which I mean mainly,
questions of power that

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.220
determine what's going to
happen.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.244
All right, but by the end of
the sixth century there is this

00:25:38.244 --> 00:25:40.700
Spartan alliance and Sparta
alone,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.988
among the Greek states,
is a hegemonal power and able

00:25:44.988 --> 00:25:49.881
to use, by Greek standards,
a much vaster military force

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:55.331
than the Greeks have ever known,
so that when the Persian Wars

00:25:55.331 --> 00:25:59.291
come upon them,
there will be no hesitation and

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.596
no doubt;
the Greek league that will

00:26:01.596 --> 00:26:04.509
fight the Persians,
will be led by the Spartans.

00:26:04.509 --> 00:26:10.085
So great was their respect in
which they were held that not

00:26:10.085 --> 00:26:13.450
only did they command the
armies,

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.601
even though they had no navy
and no naval tradition,

00:26:16.601 --> 00:26:19.319
they were even put in charge of
the fleet,

00:26:19.319 --> 00:26:23.162
although they often had the
brains to use other people who

00:26:23.162 --> 00:26:26.329
had more experience to do the
actual leading.

00:26:26.329 --> 00:26:32.559
But Sparta is in this position
and I think that's important.

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:37.043
Well, let's step back a
moment and take a look at the

00:26:37.043 --> 00:26:41.767
Spartan state as we've been
describing it and ask what is it

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:45.210
that motivates the Spartans as a
state,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:51.470
first of all,
in its foreign policy?

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.013
Because, as we shall see,
there's this remarkable thing

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:58.951
that even though they are by far
the strongest military force

00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:02.504
among the Greeks,
they are more than usual

00:27:02.504 --> 00:27:06.761
reluctant to fight,
and they don't like to fight

00:27:06.761 --> 00:27:11.770
wars if they can avoid them,
especially they don't like to

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:16.248
go any great distance to fight a
war away from home and they

00:27:16.248 --> 00:27:20.954
don't like to fight for any long
period of time if they have to

00:27:20.954 --> 00:27:24.911
be away from home.
The reasons for that are really

00:27:24.911 --> 00:27:29.278
what I want to make you see.
At the core of it all,

00:27:29.278 --> 00:27:34.230
according to Thucydides,
it was the fear of the Helots.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:39.094
It's not just that the Helots
were so numerous compared to the

00:27:39.094 --> 00:27:43.800
Spartans, but I want to remind
you again of their tremendous

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.069
dissatisfaction with their
situation,

00:27:47.069 --> 00:27:50.938
their backs may have been
broken, but their spirits were

00:27:50.938 --> 00:27:53.669
not.
They always were hoping to have

00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:58.363
a rebellion in which they could
undue this extraordinarily heavy

00:27:58.363 --> 00:28:01.748
burden that they carried,
and somehow in spite of the

00:28:01.748 --> 00:28:04.200
hundreds of years in which this
has been going on,

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.213
they did not lose sight of
their nationality,

00:28:07.213 --> 00:28:11.116
of the fact that they were
Mycenaeans and that they were a

00:28:11.116 --> 00:28:13.827
people,
and that they had to throw off

00:28:13.827 --> 00:28:17.349
Spartan control of them if they
could possible could.

00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:20.270
Their feelings towards the
Spartans were as you might

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.496
expect.
There's a story of a rebellion

00:28:22.496 --> 00:28:25.950
I think I mentioned this to you
earlier, early in the fourth

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.235
century in Sparta,
somebody is trying to stir up

00:28:29.235 --> 00:28:33.417
the people against the Spartan
government and he mentions to

00:28:33.417 --> 00:28:37.599
the people he's trying to enlist
in his side the Helots,

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:42.849
he says, who would gladly eat
the Spartans raw.

00:28:42.849 --> 00:28:45.537
I think that's what you have to
have in your mind,

00:28:45.537 --> 00:28:48.390
if you want to understand what
the Spartans think.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.917
If we take our whole army,
leave town, go three days march

00:28:51.917 --> 00:28:55.940
away, how do we know we'll find
anybody alive when we get back?

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.485
That's always on their minds
and Helot rebellions,

00:28:58.485 --> 00:29:00.720
although they don't take place
every day,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.217
take place very sparsely,
but they keep happening so that

00:29:06.217 --> 00:29:11.063
the fear is never irrational.
To that is added the

00:29:11.063 --> 00:29:15.195
permanent enmity of Argos,
which never gives up the idea

00:29:15.195 --> 00:29:19.552
of returning to the great days
of Pheidon with Argos as the

00:29:19.552 --> 00:29:23.534
dominant state in the
Peloponnesus and that means that

00:29:23.534 --> 00:29:28.117
the Spartans have to be defeated
for that to happen and so the

00:29:28.117 --> 00:29:32.549
Argives come back to the
Spartans time after time,

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:35.678
good stretches in between,
because the Spartans always

00:29:35.678 --> 00:29:39.161
beat them and do great harm so
that it takes a long time for

00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:42.103
them to come back.
But they're there,

00:29:42.103 --> 00:29:45.309
they don't go away;
it's a problem.

00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:48.987
So, the Spartans,
of course, have a need of a

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:54.253
collection of states that stand
between them and their potential

00:29:54.253 --> 00:29:58.849
enemies of whom the Argives are
the most important.

00:29:58.849 --> 00:30:03.621
So, you can look at the
Peloponnesian league in general

00:30:03.621 --> 00:30:09.188
as the way in which the Spartans
dealt with the danger they felt

00:30:09.188 --> 00:30:13.692
internally and externally.
Another element that the

00:30:13.692 --> 00:30:16.869
Spartans always worry
about--remember why are the

00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:22.309
Spartans so successful?
Numerically they aren't many,

00:30:22.309 --> 00:30:28.849
enough to actually just defeat
anybody by numbers.

00:30:28.849 --> 00:30:30.430
It is, because they are the
best.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.788
Why are they the best?
It's because of this training

00:30:33.788 --> 00:30:37.268
system, these values,
this way of life that is the

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:40.871
purely Spartan way.
So, there are always,

00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:44.761
I would argue,
likely to be a majority at

00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:50.303
least of Spartans who are
suspicious of and hostile to any

00:30:50.303 --> 00:30:54.289
kind of change internally
certainly,

00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:56.484
and externally,
because external things have

00:30:56.484 --> 00:30:59.778
internal implications.
They're always worried about

00:30:59.778 --> 00:31:03.029
corruption seeping into the
Spartan system.

00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:07.681
Corruption normally has the
concept of money,

00:31:07.681 --> 00:31:11.954
wealth behind it.
If money comes into the picture

00:31:11.954 --> 00:31:16.117
and people start being bought by
it, they will cease to be

00:31:16.117 --> 00:31:19.549
thinking the way good Spartans
should think,

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:21.680
only of the state,
but they will think of

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.809
themselves and their wealth and
so on.

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:28.120
Another thing that corrupts
is the search for power beyond

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.230
what is appropriate in the
Spartan system.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.978
Remember that incredible
contradiction where everybody is

00:31:34.978 --> 00:31:39.425
a similar, almost an equal,
but each one isn't vying for

00:31:39.425 --> 00:31:43.900
honor, which is not available
universally to all,

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.331
and so that means if you are a
conservative Spartan,

00:31:47.331 --> 00:31:50.359
and the two words are
practically the same,

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:52.920
you're going to be worrying
about that.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.440
That leads to conservatism in
foreign policy.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.170
War, if you win,
you are going to have booty;

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.480
loot of some kind will come
back into Sparta.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.035
Moreover, some people will gain
reputations because of their

00:32:08.035 --> 00:32:11.470
fighting in the battle will
bring them excessive honor,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:15.444
will fill their heads with a
sense of their own greatness,

00:32:15.444 --> 00:32:19.420
and again, threaten the
stability of the Spartan state.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.589
So, all of that is going to
explain the paradox of the

00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:27.130
greatest military power in the
Greek world,

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:31.750
reluctant to fight and their
power is not used to acquire

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.159
economic benefits.
What they focus on is

00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:43.253
discipline and the state versus
freedom, individuality,

00:32:43.253 --> 00:32:48.160
and even family.
There you have this strange

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.903
society, a closed society that
does not normally permit people

00:32:52.903 --> 00:32:57.115
to come and visit Sparta,
and even those that it permits

00:32:57.115 --> 00:33:00.440
to come to Sparta during one
period of the year,

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.980
they actually force all
foreigners out of town and do

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:09.942
whatever strange things they do.
Now, when we're talking about

00:33:09.942 --> 00:33:13.927
the fully developed Spartan
state there are no exercises of

00:33:13.927 --> 00:33:18.049
the arts, such as existed before
this system was created.

00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:22.710
There are no luxuries legally
in Sparta.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:28.871
There are few creature comforts.
Again, I suspect at some fairly

00:33:28.871 --> 00:33:33.200
early time, there were
violations of these things,

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.084
as individuals who had the
power to do so,

00:33:36.084 --> 00:33:40.236
might well try to enjoy these
things in spite of their being

00:33:40.236 --> 00:33:42.815
barred.
But the main thing is,

00:33:42.815 --> 00:33:46.507
if you had them you couldn't
really show them,

00:33:46.507 --> 00:33:50.117
you couldn't flaunt it,
because that would be

00:33:50.117 --> 00:33:52.259
disastrous.
Why?

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:55.335
Because in a way,
necessity becomes a

00:33:55.335 --> 00:33:59.093
virtue.We human
beings--that's one of our

00:33:59.093 --> 00:34:02.509
typical ways of dealing with
things.

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:06.537
That is, we need to do
something, we have to and so one

00:34:06.537 --> 00:34:11.086
way we cope is to do it and say
it's the greatest thing in the

00:34:11.086 --> 00:34:14.326
world to do,
and doing anything else is no

00:34:14.326 --> 00:34:16.869
good.
That's what the Spartans did.

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:20.268
Their way of life was imposed
upon them by the decision to

00:34:20.268 --> 00:34:23.846
maintain their command of the
Helots, after that it all makes

00:34:23.846 --> 00:34:26.262
perfect sense.
Look what they had to give up,

00:34:26.262 --> 00:34:28.501
to do it.
They said, of course,

00:34:28.501 --> 00:34:32.254
we gave that up,
because that's what makes us

00:34:32.254 --> 00:34:37.117
the great people we are and
that's the system that was the

00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:40.628
Spartan way of life.
I remind you again that

00:34:40.628 --> 00:34:43.539
even though this is very extreme
and other Greeks say that

00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:45.480
they're not going to live that
way,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.692
they admire it tremendously,
because it suits the ideology

00:34:49.692 --> 00:34:53.682
of all polis that
subordinates individual family

00:34:53.682 --> 00:34:57.230
concerns to those of the
community at large.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.766
As I mentioned earlier,
the utopian philosophers of the

00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:03.909
fourth century,
Plato being the most striking,

00:35:03.909 --> 00:35:08.501
Aristotle to a lesser degree,
they admire this,

00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:14.091
although they have their
wrinkles about how it's going to

00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:17.255
be.
Nothing could be greater as a

00:35:17.255 --> 00:35:22.610
contrast to this way of thinking
than the way that the Athenians

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:26.860
will develop when they go
through their growth as a

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:31.682
polis.
So let's take a look now at

00:35:31.682 --> 00:35:35.950
Athens to see how they came
along.

00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:50.443
Athens, I hope you'll
remember from your maps,

00:35:50.443 --> 00:35:55.960
is located in the southeastern
portion of the Greek peninsula.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.690
It sticks out there into the
Aegean Sea.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:06.730
Its geography--it's about 1,000
square miles is Attica.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.580
I think we talked about it
already.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:15.641
The city is Athens;
the region in which they live

00:36:15.641 --> 00:36:19.187
is Attica;
the people are Athenians and

00:36:19.187 --> 00:36:21.761
that's an important point I
think I made too,

00:36:21.761 --> 00:36:25.095
which is everybody who is a
citizen who lives in Attica is

00:36:25.095 --> 00:36:27.729
an Athenian,
no matter if he lives sixty

00:36:27.729 --> 00:36:30.280
five or seventy miles away from
the city.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.598
He's still an Athenian.
One of the things they achieved

00:36:34.598 --> 00:36:38.974
early was the unification of
that whole region and they made

00:36:38.974 --> 00:36:42.914
it one polis,
although that certainly doesn't

00:36:42.914 --> 00:36:46.661
mean that there are no
independent villages and towns

00:36:46.661 --> 00:36:50.489
in the polis of Athens,
because they certainly are.

00:36:50.489 --> 00:36:57.890
Now, Attica was not one of
the most desirable,

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:05.139
certainly agriculturally rich
areas in Greece.

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:09.219
It was relatively speaking
rather barren.

00:37:09.219 --> 00:37:11.030
Now, there are of course great
exceptions;

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:15.846
the central valley so to speak,
of Attica has the richest soil

00:37:15.846 --> 00:37:20.347
and in the ancient world it was
able to grow the very best

00:37:20.347 --> 00:37:25.288
grain, including wheat.
But very much of the Athenian

00:37:25.288 --> 00:37:29.742
soil is mountainous and pretty
close to barren,

00:37:29.742 --> 00:37:34.099
so that you don't have a lot of
rich soil.

00:37:34.099 --> 00:37:36.869
This is not one of the most
admirable places to come.

00:37:36.869 --> 00:37:41.239
On the other hand,
it has certain advantages that

00:37:41.239 --> 00:37:46.155
the Athenians used well to
achieve wealth and power and

00:37:46.155 --> 00:37:48.904
greatness.
First of all,

00:37:48.904 --> 00:37:55.655
it has one splendid harbor;
up in the northwestern part of

00:37:55.655 --> 00:38:02.920
Attica is Piraeus.
It is the port of Athens.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.969
Once Athens becomes a naval
state and it is both spacious,

00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:11.070
it has three nice little
harbors,

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:16.385
and it is very easily defended,
because these harbors can be

00:38:16.385 --> 00:38:20.170
closed off and attacks can be
prevented.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.704
So, that is one strength.
Another,

00:38:23.704 --> 00:38:27.510
and this is very rare,
among Greek states,

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:33.360
Attica contained silver mines
in the south of the peninsula,

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.409
and that gave the state,
because these mines were

00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:42.274
ultimately owned by the state,
it gave the state a source of

00:38:42.274 --> 00:38:45.930
income that was very,
very unusual among the Greek

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.125
city states,
and the availability of that

00:38:49.125 --> 00:38:53.277
silver would turn out to be
crucial at various moments in

00:38:53.277 --> 00:38:56.924
Athenian history.
One reason why the soil wasn't

00:38:56.924 --> 00:39:01.179
so great for agriculture was
that a lot of it is red clay,

00:39:01.179 --> 00:39:06.101
but that turns out to be
wonderful for making pottery and

00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:11.178
of course Athenian pottery,
and I'm thinking especially

00:39:11.178 --> 00:39:16.048
about painted pottery,
fine ware, stuff that is meant

00:39:16.048 --> 00:39:21.157
for the upper classes,
stuff that artists will work on

00:39:21.157 --> 00:39:25.532
that will be exported,
all of that is made of that

00:39:25.532 --> 00:39:30.421
great red clay,
the basis for the pottery that

00:39:30.421 --> 00:39:35.026
the Athenians did.
Another natural resource of

00:39:35.026 --> 00:39:40.080
great value and great blessing
to those of us who can still see

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.644
the remains of the Athenian
experience is the marble that

00:39:44.644 --> 00:39:48.741
comes from Mount Penteli.
The Greeks call it now Pendel,

00:39:48.741 --> 00:39:51.659
and Pentelikon is what the
ancient Greeks called it.

00:39:51.659 --> 00:39:56.354
In the northeastern portion of
the Attica Peninsula and it

00:39:56.354 --> 00:40:00.059
produce--you can still go see it
wonderful,

00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:04.487
beautiful fine grain,
white marble and that's the

00:40:04.487 --> 00:40:09.559
stuff that the Parthenon and all
the other buildings,

00:40:09.559 --> 00:40:15.511
temples, on the Acropolis and
around Attica was made of and

00:40:15.511 --> 00:40:21.155
that enabled the Athenians to
build those temples as few

00:40:21.155 --> 00:40:24.845
cities could,
because there it was sitting in

00:40:24.845 --> 00:40:27.543
their territory,
not a source of the kind of

00:40:27.543 --> 00:40:31.434
tremendous expense it would be
for other states that would have

00:40:31.434 --> 00:40:35.919
to buy it and bring it in.
Now, on the other hand,

00:40:35.919 --> 00:40:41.844
Athens was able as I told you--
let's start in the early days to

00:40:41.844 --> 00:40:47.118
grow wheat and other grains,
but more to the point,

00:40:47.118 --> 00:40:52.800
it was very good for olive
trees and for grapevines,

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.124
so as we will see when the
Athenians begin to exploit all

00:40:57.124 --> 00:41:00.445
of their land,
not just the bottom land that

00:41:00.445 --> 00:41:04.274
works for grain,
but also the less desirable

00:41:04.274 --> 00:41:09.098
land and produced wine and olive
oil, that was a source of

00:41:09.098 --> 00:41:14.259
agricultural wealth that would
play an important part in their

00:41:14.259 --> 00:41:18.582
history.
Now, their own story about

00:41:18.582 --> 00:41:22.449
their past was something like
this.

00:41:22.449 --> 00:41:27.491
They, unlike the other
inhabitants of southern Greece,

00:41:27.491 --> 00:41:32.343
according to their story,
never experienced a Dorian

00:41:32.343 --> 00:41:36.653
invasion.
Now, the Dorians did come down

00:41:36.653 --> 00:41:43.006
and sort of bang at the door of
Attica, but they were driven by

00:41:43.006 --> 00:41:48.130
the Athenians and never made
their way into it.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.705
So, the Athenians claimed that
they were, in a certain sense,

00:41:52.705 --> 00:41:57.510
the purest of the pure Greeks
and they went to great lengths.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:02.102
One of their stories claims
they were, as the Greek word

00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:06.193
goes autochthonous,
that is, they were sprang from

00:42:06.193 --> 00:42:11.526
their own soil.
In fact, they said they were in

00:42:11.526 --> 00:42:16.360
Attica before the creation of
the moon.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.722
Guess you don't have to believe
that, but on the other hand,

00:42:19.722 --> 00:42:23.266
it's their picture;
we were always here,

00:42:23.266 --> 00:42:28.122
the original indigenous people.
Their tradition,

00:42:28.122 --> 00:42:31.979
and this one is surely right,
is that at an early time in

00:42:31.979 --> 00:42:35.425
their history,
Attica became a refuge for

00:42:35.425 --> 00:42:40.500
people escaping what they would
have regarded as the Dorian

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.987
invasion.
There's no doubt that people

00:42:43.987 --> 00:42:48.601
from the Peloponnesus after the
fall of the Bronze Age

00:42:48.601 --> 00:42:53.389
civilizations did a lot of
running away and some of them

00:42:53.389 --> 00:42:57.915
ran to Attica and were greeted
and settled down there

00:42:57.915 --> 00:43:01.773
permanently.
Some of the most important and

00:43:01.773 --> 00:43:06.106
most aristocratic Athenians
traced their ancestry not to the

00:43:06.106 --> 00:43:10.219
Athenians who were there before
the moon was created,

00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:14.172
but to people who had come in
this flight sometime after the

00:43:14.172 --> 00:43:15.780
end of the Bronze Age.

00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:25.789
It is a tradition not of
producing conflict but of

00:43:25.789 --> 00:43:28.809
producing harmony.
These exiles,

00:43:28.809 --> 00:43:32.266
we are told,
were brought into the Athenian

00:43:32.266 --> 00:43:36.380
people and lived among them as
Athenians, no split,

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.772
no division.
Similarly, there is nothing

00:43:40.772 --> 00:43:45.956
like the helot class in Athens.
There are no serfs,

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:50.262
there is no suppressed
population waiting to get at

00:43:50.262 --> 00:43:53.861
their rulers,
so that there's a kind of a

00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:58.221
historical good fortune,
which says Athens is going to

00:43:58.221 --> 00:44:03.783
be without internal strife.
I don't mean totally but to a

00:44:03.783 --> 00:44:09.010
great degree compared to the
other Greek states.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:12.860
Now, one important example of
what happens in Athens that

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.679
doesn't happen in other states
is this.

00:44:15.679 --> 00:44:20.656
There's a tradition in Athens
of an event called

00:44:20.656 --> 00:44:25.769
synoikismos;
it's on the site so you can

00:44:25.769 --> 00:44:29.730
look it up, which means
unification.

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:35.302
It really, if you take the word
apart, it means the bringing of

00:44:35.302 --> 00:44:39.540
households together.
There is no set of local

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:44.909
rebellions against the major
city, no need to go to war.

00:44:44.909 --> 00:44:51.563
Now, there were obviously wars
back there in the early days of

00:44:51.563 --> 00:44:57.998
the polis when the city
of Athens became the dominant

00:44:57.998 --> 00:45:01.404
city,
but we know so little of them,

00:45:01.404 --> 00:45:06.254
it's as though the memory has
been entirely forgotten and the

00:45:06.254 --> 00:45:10.942
picture that is painted is one
of everybody sort of happily

00:45:10.942 --> 00:45:15.219
living together,
no conflict.

00:45:15.219 --> 00:45:18.796
Compare that to Sparta
where it's obvious Sparta gained

00:45:18.796 --> 00:45:22.434
control of the Peloponnesus
through war and that many of the

00:45:22.434 --> 00:45:25.210
people there were very unhappy
with them,

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:30.173
not to mention the Helots.
But in neighboring Boeotia,

00:45:30.173 --> 00:45:36.733
the chief city of Thebes,
traditionally was at war trying

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:42.239
to subdue the other major cities
of Boeotia,

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:47.849
in order to make themselves the
boss and they never were fully

00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:51.332
successful in this.
So, Boeotia is torn,

00:45:51.332 --> 00:45:54.516
to some degree,
by this internal conflict,

00:45:54.516 --> 00:45:58.709
which makes it harder for
Thebes to achieve the kind of

00:45:58.709 --> 00:46:03.445
power in its own home territory
that the Athenians are able to

00:46:03.445 --> 00:46:04.610
achieve.

00:46:09.739 --> 00:46:15.290
Let's take a look at the
earliest society of Athens as

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:20.231
first we come to know it.
One thing about this is that

00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:24.855
the story often comes to us
through people like Aristotle

00:46:24.855 --> 00:46:30.139
who liked to make things neater
and put them nicely together,

00:46:30.139 --> 00:46:37.280
rather than to leave little
bumps or anything like that.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.435
The society we're talking
about, this earliest society,

00:46:41.435 --> 00:46:45.745
is aristocratic and remember
it's important to notice the

00:46:45.745 --> 00:46:49.670
difference between aristocratic
and oligarchic.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.889
Aristocratic implies means
ruled by the best,

00:46:53.889 --> 00:46:58.780
and best in that time means
simply best by birth.

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.344
It means best by birth and that
means if you're going to be in

00:47:41.344 --> 00:47:43.788
the ruling group,
in a dominant,

00:47:43.788 --> 00:47:49.052
an aristocrat--the only way to
get there is if your father was

00:47:49.052 --> 00:47:52.953
an aristocrat.
Doesn't matter how rich you

00:47:52.953 --> 00:47:57.349
are, doesn't matter what a
magnificent warrior you are,

00:47:57.349 --> 00:48:02.769
all that matters is birth and
that is different from oligarchy

00:48:02.769 --> 00:48:07.300
which gives rule to a few but
that usually means,

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:12.219
I would say just about every
case, that wealth plays a role

00:48:12.219 --> 00:48:17.223
that you can be one of the few
in the ruling group if you're

00:48:17.223 --> 00:48:20.635
rich enough.
I don't mean that they didn't

00:48:20.635 --> 00:48:24.534
have aristocrats within an
oligarchy, I'm sure that they

00:48:24.534 --> 00:48:28.219
did, it's that that was not the
critical element.

00:48:28.219 --> 00:48:32.078
Now, also in the Athenian
aristocracy, you can imagine

00:48:32.078 --> 00:48:36.300
that most aristocrats are rich
but some of them are not,

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.770
and that's the distinction that
matters and we will come back to

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:46.547
that point as we see Athens move
out of the aristocratic

00:48:46.547 --> 00:48:51.410
condition and into one that is
more based on wealth,

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:58.206
than it is merely on birth.
Well, we are told that in

00:48:58.206 --> 00:49:02.710
the earliest times,
Athens was divided up;

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:08.577
the people of Athens were
divided up into four tribes just

00:49:08.577 --> 00:49:14.239
as were all the other Ionian
cities and the Athenians of

00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:18.754
course were Ionians;
this is a point worth making,

00:49:18.754 --> 00:49:22.844
because most Ionians lived on
the coast of Asia Minor or on

00:49:22.844 --> 00:49:26.652
the Islands of the Aegean and
the Athenians were pretty

00:49:26.652 --> 00:49:30.601
much--I'm exaggerating but
mostly the only Ionians on the

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:32.975
mainland.
They sort of were an

00:49:32.975 --> 00:49:36.213
interesting middling group
between the Dorians of the

00:49:36.213 --> 00:49:39.699
Peloponnesus and the Greeks of
other types elsewhere,

00:49:39.699 --> 00:49:43.810
and the Athenians sort of stood
between the mainland where they

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:49.341
existed, where they were,
and the islands and across the

00:49:49.341 --> 00:49:50.090
seas.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:50:00.102
Each one of these four
traditional tribes contained,

00:50:00.102 --> 00:50:06.517
according to this tradition,
three subdivisions that were

00:50:06.517 --> 00:50:11.233
called phratres.
An easy way to translate

00:50:11.233 --> 00:50:16.207
phratres is brotherhood.
Notice it's again about family

00:50:16.207 --> 00:50:18.980
and birth.
You are in phratres;

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.754
you're in that phratres,
because so is your father and

00:50:22.754 --> 00:50:25.584
you inherit it,
and these phratres were

00:50:25.584 --> 00:50:29.838
very important.
I should have mentioned that

00:50:29.838 --> 00:50:35.626
the tribes had important
religious functions that also

00:50:35.626 --> 00:50:42.070
the army consisted of four
regimens, one for each tribe.

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:46.760
So, these tribes had great
reality for the Spartans.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.167
You went not only to the
religious festivals of the

00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:53.098
entire state,
but you went to those only for

00:50:53.098 --> 00:50:56.982
your fellow tribesmen,
which gave you a sense of

00:50:56.982 --> 00:51:01.630
belonging in that tribe,
and I think that's important.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:05.547
The phratres were
smaller versions of the same

00:51:05.547 --> 00:51:08.777
thing;
phratres had religious

00:51:08.777 --> 00:51:11.585
rites of their own,
and in fact,

00:51:11.585 --> 00:51:17.021
the phratres appears to
have been the unit that really

00:51:17.021 --> 00:51:22.366
mattered in terms of the place
where you sort of established

00:51:22.366 --> 00:51:26.053
your belonging.
I mean, if somebody came

00:51:26.053 --> 00:51:29.198
along to an Athenian in the
seventh century and said,

00:51:29.198 --> 00:51:32.223
you say you're an Athenian,
how do I know you're an

00:51:32.223 --> 00:51:34.181
Athenian?
Well, after you got through

00:51:34.181 --> 00:51:36.280
saying, well you can ask my
friends, my neighbors.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.699
Yeah what do they know?
You say, well how would you do

00:51:39.699 --> 00:51:42.428
it?
Well, I guess come down to a

00:51:42.428 --> 00:51:47.631
meeting of my phratres,
they will have a record of my

00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:52.216
being a member of that
phratres and that makes

00:51:52.216 --> 00:51:56.619
me an Athenian.
So that's the importance,

00:51:56.619 --> 00:52:01.053
in a way, one part of the
importance of the

00:52:01.053 --> 00:52:04.761
phratres.
Now, the phratres,

00:52:04.761 --> 00:52:08.096
because it was established by
birth and tradition,

00:52:08.096 --> 00:52:12.666
was an aristocratic stronghold.
Everywhere you can imagine,

00:52:12.666 --> 00:52:16.928
tribe, phratres,
and so on, some aristocratic

00:52:16.928 --> 00:52:22.360
family or families would have
had a leading role by tradition.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:26.251
The Greek religion did have
priests, but it didn't have a

00:52:26.251 --> 00:52:30.489
separate priestly class and
during the aristocratic period,

00:52:30.489 --> 00:52:34.520
and I would say probably
throughout its history,

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.949
Athenian religion had the
priesthoods,

00:52:37.949 --> 00:52:41.991
the chief religious places in
the state were held by

00:52:41.991 --> 00:52:46.269
aristocrats, which in a
primitive society in itself,

00:52:46.269 --> 00:52:50.519
gives them tremendous prestige
and a lot of clout.

00:52:50.519 --> 00:52:53.729
Probably,
although I'm not sure we have

00:52:53.729 --> 00:52:57.550
hard evidence on this,
probably the phratres

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:01.829
fought side by side in the
tribal regiments as well;

00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:05.519
of course they would always be
commanded by aristocratic

00:53:05.519 --> 00:53:06.190
leaders.

00:53:11.269 --> 00:53:15.559
Another way the Athenian people
were divided involved names of

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:20.269
classes of people and we'll come
back to that in another context,

00:53:20.269 --> 00:53:23.761
but one class,
the highest class in the

00:53:23.761 --> 00:53:28.079
aristocratic state were the
eupatrids,

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:32.791
it means the well-born,
the well-sired and it turns out

00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:36.823
that in the early polis,
no surprise,

00:53:36.823 --> 00:53:41.727
they dominated the best
farmland, they had the chief

00:53:41.727 --> 00:53:46.034
jobs in religion,
they were the government,

00:53:46.034 --> 00:53:51.757
because as early as we can tell
that there was a regime after

00:53:51.757 --> 00:53:57.417
the legendary kings are gone,
the number one governmental

00:53:57.417 --> 00:54:00.410
organization,
you might call it,

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:03.789
is the council of the
Areopagus;

00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:06.559
gets its name from the place
where it meets.

00:54:06.559 --> 00:54:09.921
If you look to the west side of
the Acropolis,

00:54:09.921 --> 00:54:14.028
immediately there's a pretty
good size hill which is the

00:54:14.028 --> 00:54:17.389
Areopagus, the hill of Ares,
the war god.

00:54:17.389 --> 00:54:21.528
There the council of the
Areopagus met and did what it

00:54:21.528 --> 00:54:26.291
had to do, and it's clear that
the members of the Areopagus in

00:54:26.291 --> 00:54:29.179
its earliest stage were
noblemen.

00:54:29.179 --> 00:54:32.941
We don't know enough to
know whether it was all noblemen

00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:36.829
or just the leaders of the clans
or whatever, but that's where

00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:39.707
decisions were made.
It's important though to

00:54:39.707 --> 00:54:42.851
realize that in these early days
of the polis they

00:54:42.851 --> 00:54:46.219
probably had very little to
decide and very little to do.

00:54:46.219 --> 00:54:51.117
Most of the real life of the
state in the earliest days would

00:54:51.117 --> 00:54:56.260
have been out in the countryside
where the overwhelming majority

00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:00.477
of the people lived.
You must imagine that it is

00:55:00.477 --> 00:55:03.654
something like,
nothing like precisely,

00:55:03.654 --> 00:55:08.670
but something like the feudal
manners that we find in western

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:12.599
Europe after the fall of the
Roman Empire.

00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:16.865
These noblemen would
typically have held a lot of

00:55:16.865 --> 00:55:21.338
land and have been well to do,
have had all the powers I've

00:55:21.338 --> 00:55:24.969
described, and were looked up to
and were listened to.

00:55:24.969 --> 00:55:29.083
They would have led the
military units into battle when

00:55:29.083 --> 00:55:33.805
that was necessary and we know
that one of the things that they

00:55:33.805 --> 00:55:38.300
did was to serve as the source
of justice in the state.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:41.090
If there was a quarrel between
a couple of guys,

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:44.369
they would bring it to a court.
You think of Hesiod,

00:55:44.369 --> 00:55:47.602
his complaints where his
noblemen, his barons were

00:55:47.602 --> 00:55:50.769
crooked, but that doesn't mean
they all were.

00:55:50.769 --> 00:55:53.130
In any case,
that's where you went.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:57.769
They settled any disputes that
you didn't settle by feud or by

00:55:57.769 --> 00:56:02.802
some other primitive technique.
It was pretty clear that it was

00:56:02.802 --> 00:56:07.440
right to have the noblemen do
it, not just because they're

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.916
aristocrats but because they
would know what the law was

00:56:11.916 --> 00:56:16.636
since there was no writing
before the eighth century and it

00:56:16.636 --> 00:56:21.061
was very rare after that,
there was nothing like a

00:56:21.061 --> 00:56:24.400
written law code until the
seventh century.

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.909
Before that,
if you wanted to get justice

00:56:26.909 --> 00:56:30.235
you went to a nobleman,
and if you wanted to go beyond

00:56:30.235 --> 00:56:32.914
that,
you went to the Areopagus,

00:56:32.914 --> 00:56:36.257
which is made of noblemen.
That's the picture in the

00:56:36.257 --> 00:56:38.690
earliest polis as best we
can reconstruct it.

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:47.180
Now, Aristotle tells us
that beginning in the early

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:50.239
seventh century,
the date he gives us,

00:56:50.239 --> 00:56:55.239
of course we shouldn't put too
much credence in it,

00:56:55.239 --> 00:56:58.940
it's too precise,
but it's 683 B.C.

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:02.547
This is the date he gives us
and he tells us on that

00:57:02.547 --> 00:57:05.730
occasion, we are introduced to a
new thing,

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:11.610
magistrates are chosen from the
aristocracy to do various jobs

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:18.011
in the city.
In Athens, the magistrates were

00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:24.537
called archons.
It means, in the most technical

00:57:24.537 --> 00:57:28.390
sense, rulers,
but it means really important

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:34.940
magistrates in the state.
One of these was called the War

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:38.980
archon,
polemarch,

00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:45.616
presumably he led the army.
Next came the archon who

00:57:45.616 --> 00:57:49.574
was actually the most important
archon,

00:57:49.574 --> 00:57:53.179
the one who gave his name to
the year.

00:57:53.179 --> 00:57:57.738
I think I mentioned the Greeks
did not have a system of dating,

00:57:57.738 --> 00:58:01.414
which has a starting point,
and so you can say one,

00:58:01.414 --> 00:58:03.400
two, three, four,
five.

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:07.300
Instead, like many ancient
peoples, they named the year

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.707
after the leading archon,
the leading magistrate of the

00:58:11.707 --> 00:58:14.333
state;
Mesopotamian cities did the

00:58:14.333 --> 00:58:17.302
same thing.
So that archon was

00:58:17.302 --> 00:58:22.057
called the archon
eponymous, the one who gives his

00:58:22.057 --> 00:58:25.589
name to the state.
So, if you wanted to know

00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:28.725
when did a thing happen,
somebody would say it was in

00:58:28.725 --> 00:58:31.500
the archonship of so and so,
and so and so.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.900
Well, you wouldn't have that in
your head, you would have to go

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.587
someplace and look it up where
there was a list of

00:58:37.587 --> 00:58:40.368
archons.
Anyway, he was the most

00:58:40.368 --> 00:58:43.943
important.
A third archon was known

00:58:43.943 --> 00:58:47.748
as the King archon,
the archon

00:58:47.748 --> 00:58:51.685
basileus.
His responsibilities were

00:58:51.685 --> 00:58:56.015
mainly religious,
but I should point out that all

00:58:56.015 --> 00:58:59.715
the archons,
whatever else they did,

00:58:59.715 --> 00:59:02.922
every one of them also did
justice, that is,

00:59:02.922 --> 00:59:07.620
they had courts to which people
could come to get their quarrels

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.087
settled.
Sometime after that,

00:59:10.087 --> 00:59:14.730
after these three major figures
that I have mentioned to you,

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:20.868
there was established a body of
men called thesmothetes,

00:59:20.868 --> 00:59:24.730
you'll see this on the list of
words,

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:29.573
which were six men whose
functions were apparently

00:59:29.573 --> 00:59:35.964
strictly judicial.
They presided over courts that

00:59:35.964 --> 00:59:41.409
you could to for specified
purposes.

00:59:41.409 --> 00:59:45.038
Every one of these nine
archons--they are

00:59:45.038 --> 00:59:49.449
sometimes referred to as the
college of nine archons.

00:59:49.449 --> 00:59:52.711
They had a secretary which
would have brought them up to

00:59:52.711 --> 00:59:55.440
ten, but only nine were true
archons.

00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:03.320
They were elected from the
aristocracy by the assembly of

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:10.078
all Athenian adult males.
That means mainly not

01:00:10.078 --> 01:00:14.319
aristocrats;
they chose from among the

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:17.788
aristocrats for these
archons,

01:00:17.788 --> 01:00:21.740
who served for one year and not
again.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:27.129
That's a very important concept.
Nobody in Athens holds an

01:00:27.129 --> 01:00:31.845
office at this time,
or as far as I can tell,

01:00:31.845 --> 01:00:36.133
at any time--well,
back up, at this time,

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:41.132
for more than a year.
The only thing in town that has

01:00:41.132 --> 01:00:44.985
continuity, that can develop
power and influence over a

01:00:44.985 --> 01:00:48.646
period of time,
is the council of the Areopagus

01:00:48.646 --> 01:00:52.940
and that's what aristocratic and
oligarchic regimes do.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.057
They are very nervous about
individuals who acquire too much

01:00:57.057 --> 01:01:00.337
power, popularity,
influence which will threaten

01:01:00.337 --> 01:01:02.920
the character of the
aristocracy.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.952
Aristocracies--this may
seem funny, but aristocracies

01:01:07.952 --> 01:01:12.006
love equality;
equality among aristocrats,

01:01:12.006 --> 01:01:18.015
and then tremendous inequality
between them and everybody else,

01:01:18.015 --> 01:01:22.280
sort of the way Yalies feel
about things.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.989
Yalies are very nervous about
anybody sticking his head up

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:30.790
above the crowd,
because the question is always

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:34.208
why not me?
You have high expectations of

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:38.339
yourself and so sometimes unless
you're invaded by later

01:01:38.339 --> 01:01:41.869
religious ideas that the Greeks
didn't have,

01:01:41.869 --> 01:01:46.889
you're not humble,
you're vying for honor.

01:01:46.889 --> 01:01:49.340
I always seek Greeks in front
of me when I see Yalies.

01:01:52.929 --> 01:01:56.469
An aristocratic republic is
what we have,

01:01:56.469 --> 01:01:59.389
not a monarchy,
but a republic.

01:01:59.389 --> 01:02:02.176
Dominated insofar as it's
dominated by anybody but

01:02:02.176 --> 01:02:05.019
individual aristocrats,
by the areopagus,

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:11.302
and at some point in the
history of that institution it

01:02:11.302 --> 01:02:17.119
consists now of men who have
been archon.

01:02:17.119 --> 01:02:21.062
The year after their
archonship they automatically go

01:02:21.062 --> 01:02:25.146
into the areopagus and
remain areopagites for

01:02:25.146 --> 01:02:28.114
life.
Well, that gives the counsel of

01:02:28.114 --> 01:02:32.030
the areopagus even more
power and influence,

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:35.308
because they consist now,
exclusively after awhile,

01:02:35.308 --> 01:02:39.243
of people who have been chosen
for their individual qualities

01:02:39.243 --> 01:02:43.112
to be the leading magistrates in
the state and now they will

01:02:43.112 --> 01:02:46.872
oversee what's going on,
and you can bet they will be

01:02:46.872 --> 01:02:50.714
looking very carefully over the
shoulders of the aristocratic

01:02:50.714 --> 01:02:54.811
archons whenever they are
in power to see that they're not

01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:57.743
screwing up,
but also to see that they are

01:02:57.743 --> 01:03:00.349
not getting too mighty and too
powerful.

01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:05.382
The weight and the power of
the Areopagus must have been

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:09.663
enormous in this system.
So the rich and the well-born,

01:03:09.663 --> 01:03:13.584
because they are pretty much
the same in the early days of

01:03:13.584 --> 01:03:17.548
the polis,
run the state in this official

01:03:17.548 --> 01:03:21.516
constitutional way,
but I would also remind you

01:03:21.516 --> 01:03:26.520
that on their estates out there
in the country they run the

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:31.438
thing just as well with the
farmers and everybody else out

01:03:31.438 --> 01:03:34.796
there,
kowtowing to them and seeking

01:03:34.796 --> 01:03:38.446
their favorite.
That's the kind of world that

01:03:38.446 --> 01:03:42.715
we have at the start.
Then it comes to Athens as it

01:03:42.715 --> 01:03:47.588
did to every other Greek state,
a little bit later it looks

01:03:47.588 --> 01:03:52.352
like in Athens,
all of the change and turmoil

01:03:52.352 --> 01:03:58.409
that we've seen in Argos and
Corinth and other place.

01:03:58.409 --> 01:04:03.432
If we are right in talking
about something like a hoplite

01:04:03.432 --> 01:04:06.840
revolution, it occurs in Athens
too.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.583
Athens grows slowly,
and again late,

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:16.358
but it begins to engage in
commerce to a greater degree

01:04:16.358 --> 01:04:21.027
than before,
and in ancient handcrafted

01:04:21.027 --> 01:04:26.031
manufacturing,
and just as it does elsewhere,

01:04:26.031 --> 01:04:32.059
it leads to new wealth and new
class distinctions,

01:04:32.059 --> 01:04:36.860
which are now based not on
birth but on wealth.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.960
We hear new terms,
not all of them new,

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.039
a couple of them new that come
into the picture.

01:04:44.039 --> 01:04:51.349
We hear about Athenians divided
into different classes.

01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:54.399
One of these you remember
was the Eupatridae,

01:04:54.399 --> 01:04:56.783
the well-born,
that's the old story and they

01:04:56.783 --> 01:04:59.713
were really only two,
those who were and those who

01:04:59.713 --> 01:05:02.743
weren't.
But now we hear about people

01:05:02.743 --> 01:05:06.723
called hippeis,
and it means horseman,

01:05:06.723 --> 01:05:10.241
cavalryman.
Well, you can't own a horse and

01:05:10.241 --> 01:05:13.510
ride a horse unless you have a
lot of money.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:17.675
Horses are expensive.
So, there are rich people now

01:05:17.675 --> 01:05:21.442
who are these cavalrymen.
Well, they've had cavalry in

01:05:21.442 --> 01:05:25.257
the past, they've always been
aristocrats, but what we will

01:05:25.257 --> 01:05:29.139
see in the future is that men
who are hippeis who are

01:05:29.139 --> 01:05:34.451
not necessarily aristocrats.
At the bottom of the barrel

01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:38.809
we hear about people called
thetes.

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:42.000
They've always been around,
they are the poor;

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.675
they don't own land.
They live at the mercy of

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.909
chance;
they work for other people.

01:05:47.909 --> 01:05:50.579
They do anything they can to
stay alive.

01:05:50.579 --> 01:06:00.690
But now comes the new thing,
people called zeugitai.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:04.289
What does it mean?
It means yoke fellows.

01:06:04.289 --> 01:06:08.849
Now, there are two senses of
the work yoke that seem to be

01:06:08.849 --> 01:06:11.899
involved in this.
You could say that,

01:06:11.899 --> 01:06:16.729
and this is one way that makes
sense, these were men who were

01:06:16.729 --> 01:06:21.559
sufficiently well off that they
could own a team of oxen,

01:06:21.559 --> 01:06:25.780
two oxen, who were yoked
together to pull the plow.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.679
That would make them
respectably well off farmers.

01:06:29.679 --> 01:06:34.809
We are talking about people of
the hoplite class.

01:06:34.809 --> 01:06:38.106
Another theory is that they
were indeed named that,

01:06:38.106 --> 01:06:40.480
because they were
hoplites,

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.243
because they lined up in the
phalanx and they were

01:06:44.243 --> 01:06:46.260
yoked together,
so to speak,

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.510
by their shields touching one
another.

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:52.952
It hardly matters which of
the stories you prefer or

01:06:52.952 --> 01:06:56.634
whether you choose both;
we're talking about the same

01:06:56.634 --> 01:06:59.789
people and that tells us the
important fact,

01:06:59.789 --> 01:07:03.532
that this new class of
independent family farmer has

01:07:03.532 --> 01:07:07.365
arrived in Athens,
and as in other states is not

01:07:07.365 --> 01:07:11.954
satisfied with his position in
the state, as his own importance

01:07:11.954 --> 01:07:15.210
to the state becomes greater and
greater.

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:19.008
We will come back to this story
when we talk about Solon,

01:07:19.008 --> 01:07:22.059
but think about these changes
as happening,

01:07:22.059 --> 01:07:26.150
as the next change that I want
to tell you about occurs.

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:30.064
A change that didn't happen,
but if it had,

01:07:30.064 --> 01:07:34.909
it would have changed the
entire course of events.

01:07:34.909 --> 01:07:38.921
According to tradition in
the year 632,

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:44.270
an Athenian nobleman who had
become famous because of his

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:50.192
victory in an athletic contest
and who had married the daughter

01:07:50.192 --> 01:07:55.350
of a very wealthy and powerful
tyrant in Megara,

01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:59.992
right next door to Attica.
So, this guy was a young big

01:07:59.992 --> 01:08:04.208
shot of extraordinary character
named, Cylon,

01:08:04.208 --> 01:08:08.616
attempted a coup
d'état trying to

01:08:08.616 --> 01:08:14.165
establish a tyranny in Athens,
just as his father-in-law had

01:08:14.165 --> 01:08:18.435
established one in Megara.
His father-in-law's name was

01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:21.340
Theagenes.
Well, as the story goes,

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:24.750
he tried his best to gain
control of the city.

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.489
What did you do in Athens in
the early days,

01:08:26.489 --> 01:08:28.270
if you wanted to take control
of the city,

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:31.820
is you take an armed force up
onto the Acropolis,

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:35.149
seize the Acropolis,
make it your fortress,

01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:39.180
and proclaim yourself boss and
see if you can make it stick.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:43.658
Well, he couldn't,
he was resisted by enough of

01:08:43.658 --> 01:08:47.260
his opponents that he was
defeated.

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:53.247
The leader of the resistance
was the family known as the

01:08:53.247 --> 01:08:56.955
Alcmaeonidae.
We will hear a lot about them

01:08:56.955 --> 01:09:00.402
in this course.
But they went up there,

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:05.508
locked up Cylon and his
supporters in the Acropolis,

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:09.098
in a temple.
You couldn't go into the temple

01:09:09.098 --> 01:09:12.399
for the purpose of killing
somebody, that would be

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:15.699
sacrilegious and so they were at
a standstill.

01:09:15.699 --> 01:09:19.140
Still if you're inside that
temple and trying to avoid being

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.990
killed, you still need food and
drink, and most important drink.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:27.627
So, how could they manage it?
Well, they took a cord,

01:09:27.627 --> 01:09:30.618
tied it to the temple,
held onto the cord,

01:09:30.618 --> 01:09:34.849
and went down to the well and
got their water claiming that

01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:39.080
they were just as sacrosanct as
they had been before,

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.037
and for a while it worked.
But the Alcmaeonidae said,

01:09:43.037 --> 01:09:46.315
baloney.
They cut the cord and killed

01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:50.436
the Cylonians.
That put an end to the

01:09:50.436 --> 01:09:55.294
Cylonian conspiracy but it
brought something to

01:09:55.294 --> 01:09:58.779
Alcmaeonidae as well,
a curse.

01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:04.435
The Alcmaeonids were declared
accursed and driven from the

01:10:04.435 --> 01:10:06.587
city.
Well, that's for the time

01:10:06.587 --> 01:10:09.970
being, later on we will hear
they're back again and they're

01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:13.055
very important.
But the curse continues to be

01:10:13.055 --> 01:10:16.704
attached to the family,
and as we get to the last end

01:10:16.704 --> 01:10:20.844
of the last third of the fifth
century and the Peloponnesian

01:10:20.844 --> 01:10:25.240
War is about to break out,
the enemies of Pericles will

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.920
pull out the curse of the
Alcmaeonidae to use against him,

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:35.359
because his mother was of
Alcmaeonids family.

01:10:35.359 --> 01:10:38.522
For the moment,
what we're talking about here I

01:10:38.522 --> 01:10:41.179
think though,
is here's the first sign that

01:10:41.179 --> 01:10:44.597
we see of trouble in paradise.
Nice, calm, happy

01:10:44.597 --> 01:10:49.143
synoecisized Athens has
got trouble right here in River

01:10:49.143 --> 01:10:50.560
City.
I mean in Athens.

01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:57.225
Why?
I think we must imagine that

01:10:57.225 --> 01:11:00.603
there are the kinds of
discontents that we have been

01:11:00.603 --> 01:11:04.512
talking about which find the
leader in the form of a man who

01:11:04.512 --> 01:11:07.560
is an outstanding figure for
some reason,

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.295
who is willing to try to
establish a tyranny,

01:11:11.295 --> 01:11:15.710
and use armed force to try to
achieve their goals.

01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:19.483
That it fails,
I think, is an indication that

01:11:19.483 --> 01:11:24.630
the same forces haven't reached
the power in Athens that they

01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:28.320
had reached in Megara,
Corinth, Sicyon,

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:32.427
and places like that,
but it's a warning about

01:11:32.427 --> 01:11:37.630
troubles ahead and I'll turn to
those troubles in the next

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:38.630
hour.

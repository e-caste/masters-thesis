00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.931
Professor Donald
Kagan: Considering the

00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:08.960
outbreak of the Peloponnesian
War,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.666
last thing we were talking
about was the alliance that was

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:20.574
made between Athens and Corcyra
and the significance of that

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:25.480
difficult decision the Athenians
had to make,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.412
which you will recall was
neither to accept the offer of

00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:34.627
the Corcyraeans of the
traditional offensive and

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:38.110
defensive alliance,
nor to reject it,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.955
but rather to make a different
kind of alliance than any we

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:48.269
know of before in Greek history,
a purely defensive alliance,

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.304
which I suggest to you really
should be understood less as a

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:57.400
military action than as a
diplomatic gesture,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.350
as a diplomatic signal.
If the Pericles I have in my

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.409
mind has anything to do with the
real Pericles who existed,

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.315
he is a man who is very
sophisticated about the idea of

00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:16.580
sending diplomatic signals by
action,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.189
rather than merely by words,
and that his intention here was

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.370
to avoid the unacceptable change
in the balance of naval power,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.585
which would have occurred if
the Corcyraeans had been

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:35.265
defeated by the Corinthians.
At the same time he was

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:39.255
trying to avoid blowing this
whole thing up into a major war

00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:43.110
against the Peloponnesians by
preventing the fighting.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.936
In fact, I don't know if I said
this flat out,

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:47.792
but let me say it now.
I think he hoped that when the

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:51.619
Corinthians approached Corcyra
and saw Athenian ships lined up

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.058
at the Corcyraeans,
the Corinthians would back off

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:59.311
and there would be no battle and
the result would be some other

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.849
way of getting out of this
crisis.

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.260
As it turned out his hopes were
dashed.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.966
At the Battle of Sybota,
which took place in September

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:14.567
433, to which the Athenians,
you remember sent ten ships

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.864
with three generals,
one of whom,

00:02:16.864 --> 00:02:20.740
the leading one was
Lacedaemonius the son of Cimon,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.473
who received orders that were
the most difficult kinds of

00:02:25.473 --> 00:02:29.699
orders you can imagine giving a
naval commander.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:34.062
His orders were to stay
there and if the battle

00:02:34.062 --> 00:02:37.639
commenced not to engage in that
battle,

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.458
unless and until that moment
when it appeared that the

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:45.996
Corinthians were not only going
to win but were going to land on

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:49.470
the island or Corcyra,
then and only then,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.440
should Lacedaemonius bring the
Athenian ships into combat.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.753
Now, how in the world,
in a naval battle especially

00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:01.800
where things don't stand still,
they're either moving around

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.986
themselves or the sea is moving
them around, how can you be sure

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:09.110
what's going to happen ten
minutes from now,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.340
half an hour from now?
It's impossible to be certain.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.736
So, it would have been a
difficult call and I do think

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:19.710
that Pericles anticipated that
there might be an engagement,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.540
which he would want to regret,
but he could blame

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.169
Lacedaemonius and the generals
for doing it.

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.327
However that may be,
that's all that the Athenians

00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:36.636
sent, and again,
we ought to realize the

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:40.030
Athenians had four hundred
triremes.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.643
They could have sent a
couple of hundred which would

00:03:44.643 --> 00:03:49.090
have guaranteed that if the
Corinthians had fought,

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.350
the Corinthians would have been
swept from the sea.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.307
Why didn't he do that?
It was obvious again that his

00:03:57.307 --> 00:04:02.330
intention was not to frighten or
anger the Spartans,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.866
the head of the Peloponnesian
League by such a crushing

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:11.990
victory, but instead to employ
the technique of deterrence.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.810
Now, the decision to send
only ten was debatable.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.115
After those ten had been sent
the question was raised again in

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:24.767
the Athenian assembly,
obviously by people who didn't

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:28.683
agree with Pericles' approach,
who insisted that there should

00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:32.601
be a larger fleet sent,
and Pericles apparently could

00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:37.045
not prevent them sending some
more ships, but the most they

00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:40.569
could get a vote for was twenty
more ships.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.245
So, now there's a second
Athenian detachment that is sent

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:50.590
some days after the first which
consists of twenty ships more;

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.442
keep that in mind.
Well, the battle which

00:04:54.442 --> 00:05:00.199
Thucydides describes in great
detail works as follows.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:07.354
The Corinthians do attack
against the combined forces of

00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:14.508
120 or is it 110 Corcyraean
ships and ten Athenians that are

00:05:14.508 --> 00:05:19.766
there with their 150,
and the Corinthians are

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:25.382
winning, and at a critical
moment Lacedaemonius engages the

00:05:25.382 --> 00:05:30.900
Athenians in the fight and so
what Pericles hoped to avoid

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.581
took place.
The Corinthians would have

00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:39.420
succeeded in winning the battle
and would have landed on the

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.133
island,
and presumably ultimately taken

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:48.826
charge of the Corcyraean fleet
when something happened that if

00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:54.800
it wasn't the very stern and
factually determined Thucydides,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.459
but it was a Hollywood movie,
you wouldn't believe it.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:01.634
Namely, as all of this is
happening, you can imagine

00:06:01.634 --> 00:06:05.480
somebody on one of the
Corinthian ships suddenly

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.146
looking behind and looking on
the horizon and seeing ships

00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:13.610
coming,
and then seeing that they were

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.209
Athenian ships,
at which point the Corinthians

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:19.065
panicked,
pulled back,

00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:22.870
gave up their victory and
withdrew from the fight.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.810
You can't blame the
Corinthians.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.635
Once they knew they were
Athenian ships they had every

00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.768
reason to think,
my God maybe there's 200

00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:32.913
Athenian ships coming at us and
so it turned of course there

00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:35.629
were only twenty,
but it was too late.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.777
So, the Battle of Sybota,
this naval battle I've

00:06:39.777 --> 00:06:43.924
described to you,
ends in this way and it leaves

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:48.228
things up in the air.
The Corinthians have not been

00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:52.497
deterred, they are determined
more than ever to continue the

00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:57.373
fight and on the other hand,
the Corcyraeans aren't backing

00:06:57.373 --> 00:07:02.817
down either, and so here we have
one of the issues that will be

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:08.279
decisive in bringing on the war.
Over that winter 433 to 432,

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:13.060
two events of importance in
this connection take place.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.601
We cannot be sure precisely
when in that year they took

00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:20.470
place and we can't even be sure
which of them came first.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.100
I'm turning first to
Potidaea.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.965
I'm doing what most scholars
do, but none of us have any

00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:31.090
reason to believe it happened
before the next thing I'll tell

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.019
you about.
City of Potidaea up in the

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:38.079
Chalcidic Peninsula,
those three fingers sticking

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:43.812
out into the Aegean from Thrace,
was, you will perhaps recall,

00:07:43.812 --> 00:07:49.930
a Corinthian colony and it was
extraordinarily lose to Corinth.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.771
Remember when I was talking
about colonies and the varieties

00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:55.180
of relations with the mother
city that they had,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.154
I told you that Potidaea had
unusually close relations with

00:07:59.154 --> 00:08:02.276
Corinth.
Each year the Corinthians sent

00:08:02.276 --> 00:08:06.905
out magistrates who in fact
governed Potidaea and this was

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:09.910
voluntary on the Potidaeans'
part.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.519
So, you have a very special
Corinthian-Potidaean thing.

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:17.736
Because of what had happened
and what was happening,

00:08:17.736 --> 00:08:21.540
the Athenians feared,
and it turned out rightly

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.340
feared,
that the Potidaeans might be

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.257
planning to rebel against them
and to join their Corinthian

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:30.157
friends.
In fact,

00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:35.561
the Potidaeans were planning
such a thing and in order to

00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:41.061
make their chances greater they
secretly sent a mission to

00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:46.754
Sparta in which they asked the
Spartans just as you remember

00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:51.289
the Thasians had done back there
in 465.

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:54.389
If we rebel,
will you invade Attica?

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:57.199
I assume it was the
ephors--this was a secret

00:08:57.199 --> 00:09:00.063
thing it would not have been
discussed in the Spartan

00:09:00.063 --> 00:09:03.174
assembly.
I believe a majority of the

00:09:03.174 --> 00:09:08.851
ephors must have said "we
will" and so the Potidaeans went

00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:12.887
forward with their rebellion.
The Athenians,

00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:18.020
before the rebellion broke out,
but suspecting such things as

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.100
being in the cards,
sent a fleet.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.443
There was a fleet of Athenian
ships that was going to

00:09:24.443 --> 00:09:28.173
Macedonia anyway for other
reasons and they were instructed

00:09:28.173 --> 00:09:32.447
by the assembly,
again, I'm sure it's Pericles

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:37.288
calling the shots,
to stop by at Potidaea on the

00:09:37.288 --> 00:09:40.171
way,
and when they were in Potidaea

00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:44.637
to take down the defensive walls
that the Potidaeans had on the

00:09:44.637 --> 00:09:47.100
seaside,
so that they would be

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.600
vulnerable to the Athenians
without question,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.100
which would presumably deter a
rebellion.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.035
But when that fleet went
out they found that the

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:59.279
Potidaeans were already in
rebellion,

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:06.562
they could not get at Potidaea,
and the Athenians subsequently

00:10:06.562 --> 00:10:12.770
sent a fleet to blockade the
city and sent an army to

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:19.629
blockade it on the land side,
and they were now at war with

00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:25.669
Potidaea, the colony of Corinth,
to suppress the rebellion.

00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:30.940
The Corinthians responded in an
interesting, complicated way.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:36.638
A band of--I think the number
was 2,000--I think it's 2,000

00:10:36.638 --> 00:10:42.141
Corinthian hoplites came to
Potidaea and helped defend it

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:49.684
against the Athenian attackers.
Thucydides describes them as

00:10:49.684 --> 00:10:53.285
privately sent.
That is to say,

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:58.393
he wants to make the point that
these were not sent officially

00:10:58.393 --> 00:11:01.948
as Corinthian soldiers;
they were what--we've seen

00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:04.600
these games being played in the
modern world too.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.972
They were volunteers,
just like the 40,000 Cuban

00:11:09.972 --> 00:11:15.230
volunteers that went to Angola
in the 1970s,

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:21.128
volunteers paid for,
supplied, and ordered there by

00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:24.336
Castro.
That's the kind of volunteers,

00:11:24.336 --> 00:11:27.269
I think, were in Potidaea at
this point.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:31.186
Why did the Corinthians go
through this masquerade,

00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:34.159
this very easily penetrated
masquerade?

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:38.790
Because they knew that the
Athenians under the treaty had

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.007
every right to suppress a
rebellion in their empire,

00:11:43.007 --> 00:11:46.149
but they didn't want it to
happen.

00:11:46.149 --> 00:11:49.704
If they had officially sent
their own forces to help they

00:11:49.704 --> 00:11:52.179
would have been guilty of
aggression,

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:55.226
they would have been guilty of
breaking the treaty by

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:57.570
interfering in the other fellows
zone,

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.928
and that would have had a very
bad effect on what the

00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:04.868
Corinthians were clearly deeply
concerned about now -- getting

00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:08.227
the Spartans to get the
Peloponnesian League into the

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:12.490
war against Athens to achieve
the goals that Corinth wanted.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.470
So, that explains this tricky
little business.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:20.346
So, now event number two.
The Athenians are actually

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:25.259
having already fought the
Corinthians at sea in the Battle

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:29.143
of Sybota,
were now engaged in a siege of

00:12:29.143 --> 00:12:35.129
a city which contained thousands
of Corinthian soldiers as well,

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:39.340
and yet nobody had declared war
on anybody.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.639
This is all happening
technically during peace time.

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:49.478
The other important event that
took place over that winter had

00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:53.863
to do with a town of Megara.
We've been hearing about that,

00:12:53.863 --> 00:12:56.889
of course, at least ever since
the first Peloponnesian War.

00:12:56.889 --> 00:13:02.184
What happened here was that at
a certain point in that winter,

00:13:02.184 --> 00:13:06.350
the Athenians passed a decree
of the assembly,

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:13.289
which forbade the Megarians
from trading--Let me back up;

00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:18.629
let me be very technical,
from using the harbor of the

00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:23.263
Piraeus, from using the
agora of Athens,

00:13:23.263 --> 00:13:28.200
or from using any of the ports
of the empire.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.090
I'm being extremely technical
and careful about this.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.965
If I were not I'd be simply
saying that they were barring

00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:38.980
the Megarian trade from anywhere
in the Athenian Empire.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:44.150
I don't do so,
because one brilliant late

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:52.034
Oxford scholar came up with a
theory about this event in which

00:13:52.034 --> 00:13:58.110
he tried to say no this was not
an embargo,

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:03.449
but it was in fact,
merely an attempt to shame,

00:14:03.449 --> 00:14:09.775
to disgrace the Megarians.
It was when the bill says you

00:14:09.775 --> 00:14:16.349
may not use the Agora of Athens
it means the Agora as the civic

00:14:16.349 --> 00:14:18.918
center.
This has nothing to do with

00:14:18.918 --> 00:14:20.997
trade.
I just want to mention it,

00:14:20.997 --> 00:14:26.437
so that I've done justice;
nobody has believed that theory

00:14:26.437 --> 00:14:30.600
yet and I don't think they
should.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.123
It's an embargo and its
intention is again--well,

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:37.279
why are we doing anything
against Megara?

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:42.317
I think the best explanation is
that when the Corinthians had

00:14:42.317 --> 00:14:46.179
fought the Corcyraeans in two
naval battles,

00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:50.710
you remember Leucimne in 435,
Sybota in 433.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:56.428
In the first one a number of
Peloponnesian allies and other

00:14:56.428 --> 00:15:01.950
allies too had assisted the
Corinthians in the battle.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:07.808
Now, at the second battle the
number of allies assisting the

00:15:07.808 --> 00:15:11.879
Corinthians was cut down
significantly.

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:15.545
In my opinion,
that is because the Spartans

00:15:15.545 --> 00:15:20.406
had made clear that they wished
for their allies to stay clear

00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:23.529
of this conflict,
that they didn't want to be

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:26.483
dragged into a war over it,
and I think the evidence for

00:15:26.483 --> 00:15:29.436
that is that when--you remember
that conference that the

00:15:29.436 --> 00:15:32.604
Corcyraeans asked for to meet
with the Corinthians to see if

00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:36.664
the couldn't work this out.
The Spartans accompanied them

00:15:36.664 --> 00:15:41.212
to that conference and clearly
that means they wanted such a

00:15:41.212 --> 00:15:44.887
conference to take place,
and they would have liked a

00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:47.415
peaceful outcome,
but the Corinthians wouldn't

00:15:47.415 --> 00:15:50.216
have any,
and so I think that it was the

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:54.398
clear signal that the Spartans
gave that we want you to cool

00:15:54.398 --> 00:15:58.509
this that explains why fewer
Peloponnesian allies showed up

00:15:58.509 --> 00:16:03.088
to help at the second battle,
but among those few were the

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.922
Megarians.
Why?Because we know the

00:16:05.922 --> 00:16:09.960
Megarians had a terrific grudge
against the Athenians,

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.853
of course, throughout all of
history but more to the point,

00:16:14.853 --> 00:16:18.987
at the end of the first
Peloponnesian War when the

00:16:18.987 --> 00:16:24.218
Megarians had rebelled against
the Athenians in their moment of

00:16:24.218 --> 00:16:28.774
greatest danger and then had
slaughtered as they had an

00:16:28.774 --> 00:16:33.976
Athenian garrison at the port,
there was tremendous ill will

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:37.419
between the two cities,
and the Megarians were just

00:16:37.419 --> 00:16:41.549
going to take a shot at giving
the Athenians a hard time.

00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:46.016
So, it was important for the
Athenians, or in any case,

00:16:46.016 --> 00:16:49.739
led by Pericles,
that was the way the assembly

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:54.123
decided not to allow what the
Megarians had done to go

00:16:54.123 --> 00:16:57.801
unpunished,
because they wanted to deter

00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:02.830
other Peloponnesian allies from
doing the same the next time.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.414
Well, what could they do?
Well, there are really two

00:17:06.414 --> 00:17:08.954
things they could do;
come to think of it before they

00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:11.069
came up with this idea there was
only one.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.256
They could march into Megara
and fight, but of course,

00:17:15.256 --> 00:17:19.601
that would be an attack
directly on an important ally of

00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:21.941
Sparta;
it would be a breach of the

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:24.775
thirty-years peace and it would
bring about the great

00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:27.579
Peloponnesian War.
Pericles didn't want to do

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.769
that, but he didn't the
Megarians to get away scott

00:17:30.769 --> 00:17:34.238
free,
and so he invented a new thing

00:17:34.238 --> 00:17:39.365
again, yet one more new idea,
which I again regard as

00:17:39.365 --> 00:17:44.887
fundamentally a diplomatic
device meant to deter the kind

00:17:44.887 --> 00:17:50.409
of behavior that was necessary
to deter and that was this

00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:53.154
decree.
And scholars have fought

00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:55.485
forever and a day about all
aspects of it,

00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:58.255
and most importantly,
about what it's for,

00:17:58.255 --> 00:18:01.557
why it's going on,
what's its purpose.Unless

00:18:01.557 --> 00:18:05.069
you understand it as I'm
suggesting you should,

00:18:05.069 --> 00:18:09.949
it really is hard to tell,
because it could not have

00:18:09.949 --> 00:18:15.977
driven the Megarians out of the
Peloponnesian League over to the

00:18:15.977 --> 00:18:18.880
Athenian side,
as it did not.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.121
The Megarians are absolutely
determined, remained terribly

00:18:22.121 --> 00:18:24.078
hostile.
Nothing, no matter how much

00:18:24.078 --> 00:18:26.339
they suffered could make them
change sides.

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:29.835
This was an oligarchic
pro-Spartan outfit that ran the

00:18:29.835 --> 00:18:32.540
place and hated the Athenians
terribly.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.858
Pericles had to know that.
He wasn't trying to wipe them

00:18:35.858 --> 00:18:38.849
out, he wasn't trying to take
them out of business,

00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:44.606
he was trying to show not so
much them, but other Spartan

00:18:44.606 --> 00:18:50.980
allies that the Athenians could
hurt them in ways that they had

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.839
not been hurt before without
going to war and dragging the

00:18:56.839 --> 00:19:00.974
Spartans in.
Any commercial Greek state

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:04.857
in the Peloponnesus,
and most of them had to do some

00:19:04.857 --> 00:19:08.357
kind of commerce,
and some of the most important

00:19:08.357 --> 00:19:12.311
ones were right on the seashore,
would have had to understand

00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:14.750
what the significance of this
was.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:20.021
So, there we have the Megarian
Decree, and it is the third of

00:19:20.021 --> 00:19:23.887
these provocations as the
Corinthians saw it,

00:19:23.887 --> 00:19:27.049
that helped to bring on the
war.

00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:31.325
We would use such terms as the
immediate causes,

00:19:31.325 --> 00:19:36.056
the official complaints,
as Thucydides would speak of

00:19:36.056 --> 00:19:40.315
them which are seen,
or were seen by contemporaries

00:19:40.315 --> 00:19:44.162
as being the causes of the war.
It's important to recognize

00:19:44.162 --> 00:19:47.789
that Thucydides whole work,
or at least certainly Book One,

00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:52.430
is dedicated to correcting what
he thinks is an error about

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.587
these things.
In his view,

00:19:54.587 --> 00:19:58.099
it's not these particularities
that matter;

00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:02.756
it's the truest cause that is
the growing power of Athens and

00:20:02.756 --> 00:20:07.102
the fear that it engendered
among the Spartans and that's

00:20:07.102 --> 00:20:12.092
what that's all about.
Well, the Corinthians in

00:20:12.092 --> 00:20:16.656
reaction to these events,
Corcyra, Potidaea,

00:20:16.656 --> 00:20:21.539
Megara pressed the Spartans to
take action,

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:27.770
pressed them to call a meeting,
which would allow the allies to

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.789
make their complaints to the
Spartans,

00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:34.963
and of course,
that wouldn't have had any

00:20:34.963 --> 00:20:39.485
success, if there had not been
Spartans who themselves had

00:20:39.485 --> 00:20:44.880
decided that war against Athens
was desirable and were prepared;

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.737
they would have had to be
influential Spartans who thought

00:20:48.737 --> 00:20:51.309
that -- members of the
gerousia,

00:20:51.309 --> 00:20:53.609
ephors,
possibly kings.

00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:57.559
We know at least one Spartan
king was not in favor of it.

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:59.660
In fact, the other Spartan king
was in exile.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.666
So this could not have been led
by kings, but rather by the

00:21:03.666 --> 00:21:07.555
other two groups of people.
But it's also clear that

00:21:07.555 --> 00:21:10.451
the majority of Spartans were
not convinced,

00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:14.223
because they would not have
needed to do what they did if

00:21:14.223 --> 00:21:18.224
that had been true.
They called a meeting of the

00:21:18.224 --> 00:21:23.419
Spartan assembly to which they
invited all states that had any

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:27.259
grievance against the Athenians,
and of course,

00:21:27.259 --> 00:21:30.392
you could see that the
magistrates clearly wanted to

00:21:30.392 --> 00:21:34.582
stir the people to war,
but they were not capable of

00:21:34.582 --> 00:21:39.490
delivering a majority,
and so the assembly takes place

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.750
and I hope that you read that
section very,

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.828
very carefully.
The Corinthians make the

00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:50.331
decisive speech,
the essence of it is--some of

00:21:50.331 --> 00:21:53.981
it is just sophistry,
but some of it is to make the

00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:57.299
case, let's not worry about all
these technicalities.

00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:00.279
Well, they might not worry
about those technicalities;

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:04.079
none of those technicalities
amounted to a breach of the

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:07.488
thirty-years peace.
So, they were asking the

00:22:07.488 --> 00:22:12.631
Spartans to violate their oaths
by launching a war that violated

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:16.478
their previous commitments,
and later in the war the

00:22:16.478 --> 00:22:19.858
Spartans themselves admitted
that they were troubled by the

00:22:19.858 --> 00:22:22.829
fact that they had been guilty
of such a breach.

00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:26.525
So what the Corinthians
were asking was very,

00:22:26.525 --> 00:22:29.681
very difficult,
and because--whenever they

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:32.529
talked about the
particularities,

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:35.005
they wanted to get passed them
as fast as they could,

00:22:35.005 --> 00:22:36.720
because they didn't work for
that.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.581
Instead they brought in a
larger issue that was much

00:22:40.581 --> 00:22:44.339
harder to defeat.
It was a statement about the

00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:48.149
Athenian character,
the kind of people that the

00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:51.731
Athenians were,
sort of all tied up in a phrase

00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:54.498
that the Corinthians used,
something like,

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:58.750
the Athenians were born neither
to live themselves in peace,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.710
nor to allow their neighbors to
live in peace.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:07.392
They painted a horrible picture
of a people who--of a state

00:23:07.392 --> 00:23:11.187
which was insatiable,
so ambitious that it would

00:23:11.187 --> 00:23:14.740
always be a menace to all its
neighbors.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.766
No sense worrying about the
details at any particular

00:23:17.766 --> 00:23:20.115
moment.
They were growing stronger and

00:23:20.115 --> 00:23:23.766
stronger, and stronger and it
was only a matter of time until

00:23:23.766 --> 00:23:27.539
they fell upon their neighbors
and destroyed their freedom.

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:32.040
The Athenians sent
ambassadors to Sparta.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.571
They had not been invited.
They were there,

00:23:34.571 --> 00:23:37.759
says Thucydides,
mysteriously on other business.

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:40.108
I always wonder,
what other business could they

00:23:40.108 --> 00:23:43.522
have had?
Were they negotiating a grain

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:46.590
treaty?
Was it an exchange for

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.376
violinists and piano players?
I mean, what in the world--I

00:23:51.376 --> 00:23:54.311
don't know, because,
of course, I think that was a

00:23:54.311 --> 00:23:56.574
cover story.
They were there with

00:23:56.574 --> 00:23:59.663
instructions.
The instructions were:

00:23:59.663 --> 00:24:02.380
go to that meeting,
listen.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.106
If you think that it's
important to do so,

00:24:05.106 --> 00:24:08.564
I want you to make the
following set of statements to

00:24:08.564 --> 00:24:12.021
the Spartans and so we have a
speech delivered by the

00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:15.745
Athenians after all the other
allies had complained about

00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:20.020
this,
that, and the other thing and

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:25.077
the essence of the Athenian
speech, I think,

00:24:25.077 --> 00:24:29.483
was first of all,
they did what they could to

00:24:29.483 --> 00:24:33.817
make a case for themselves,
but the heart and soul of what

00:24:33.817 --> 00:24:38.023
they said was this.
It came sort of at the end

00:24:38.023 --> 00:24:41.823
of their speech,
which was, don't imagine that

00:24:41.823 --> 00:24:47.059
if you go to war against us this
is going to be an easy war for

00:24:47.059 --> 00:24:49.553
you.
In effect they were suggesting

00:24:49.553 --> 00:24:52.180
what was true;
we are a different kind of a

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.325
state.
The Corinthians say,

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:54.911
we are a different kind of
state in one sense,

00:24:54.911 --> 00:24:56.850
but we're telling you we're a
different kind of state in

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.186
another sense.
We don't need to do what your

00:24:59.186 --> 00:25:02.463
defeated opponents regularly
have to do, that is to try to

00:25:02.463 --> 00:25:05.049
get out and fight you in a
hoplite battle.

00:25:05.049 --> 00:25:08.281
Because of our navy,
our walls, our money,

00:25:08.281 --> 00:25:12.932
our empire we don't need to
fight you on the land at all and

00:25:12.932 --> 00:25:16.619
we own the sea;
you cannot hurt us.

00:25:16.619 --> 00:25:19.740
So, you'll be damn fools to
take us on.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.497
Don't think you're going to win
this war or that it's going to

00:25:23.497 --> 00:25:26.841
be quick and easy.
That part of the speech was

00:25:26.841 --> 00:25:30.696
meant to deter the Spartans.
It has confused scholars,

00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:34.376
who like so many people think
that if you want to avoid war

00:25:34.376 --> 00:25:38.309
what you need to do is to be
very nice to the other fellow.

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:42.099
There's no guarantee of
that one way or the other.

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:47.024
But the other side of the
Athenian argument is very

00:25:47.024 --> 00:25:51.080
important too.
They said, on the other hand,

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.869
whatever grievances you or your
allies have against us,

00:25:55.869 --> 00:26:00.276
and that would have included
all of these things I have

00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:03.947
mentioned to you,
we are prepared to submit to

00:26:03.947 --> 00:26:07.130
arbitration as the treaty
requires.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:12.769
In effect, if you want to keep
your oaths you must not attack

00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:16.142
us;
you must submit all complaints

00:26:16.142 --> 00:26:18.860
to arbitration.
The Athenians,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.126
and again I'm sure this was
orchestrated entirely by

00:26:23.126 --> 00:26:26.760
Pericles,
hoped that this combination of

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.669
approaches would get these
Spartans to back off and allow

00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:34.300
the situation to cool down.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.869
Thucydides records two speeches
made by Spartans at that

00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:43.880
assembly, one by King
Archidamus,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.919
who was a personal friend of
Pericles, we learn from other

00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:54.223
sources, and who clearly from
what he says here does not want

00:26:54.223 --> 00:26:58.256
to go to war now,
and I would suggest doesn't

00:26:58.256 --> 00:27:01.319
want to go to war at any time at
all.

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:07.145
He makes a case against the
Corinthian argument and arguing

00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:12.220
for delaying going to war if one
goes to war at all,

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.279
and he hoped to put the matter
off for several years.

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:18.469
That he had to do I think
because he recognized that the

00:27:18.469 --> 00:27:21.890
speech of the Corinthians had
changed the mood in Sparta,

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.506
and he thought that if the
Spartans simply voted on the

00:27:25.506 --> 00:27:28.470
question of war now,
they would vote for it.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.980
So, he couldn't just say,
let's not go to war.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.050
He felt all he could say was,
this is not the time;

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.410
let's wait for several years.
We need money,

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.082
we need to calculate all that
kind of stuff,

00:27:39.082 --> 00:27:42.625
and so that was the argument
that he made and he backed up

00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:45.049
the Athenian argument
essentially,

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:48.109
saying this is not going to be
a quick easy war of the kind

00:27:48.109 --> 00:27:51.089
we're accustomed to.
If you go to war now,

00:27:51.089 --> 00:27:54.948
and this is another memorable
phrase that he employed,

00:27:54.948 --> 00:27:57.859
you will leave this war to your
sons.

00:27:57.859 --> 00:28:00.848
That means he was saying this
is going to take a generation to

00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:03.150
fight.
That was his argument.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:08.741
Then on comes the ephor
who is the president of the

00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:13.135
meeting on that day;
his name is Sthenelaidas and he

00:28:13.135 --> 00:28:16.740
gives a wonderfully short
Spartan laconic speech.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.221
He says, I've heard a lot of
long speeches,

00:28:19.221 --> 00:28:21.289
most of which I don't
understand.

00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:24.244
I'm just a simple Spartan is
what he's implying,

00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:27.136
unlike these con men,
unlike these sophist that

00:28:27.136 --> 00:28:31.754
you've been listening to.
What I know is these guys are

00:28:31.754 --> 00:28:37.633
now laying hands on our allies
and he was talking mainly about

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:41.795
the Megarian Decree.
So, the only question is,

00:28:41.795 --> 00:28:46.075
are we going to let them do
that or not, and I say let's

00:28:46.075 --> 00:28:48.700
not.
And then he called for the vote.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.940
Interesting thing happens there
too.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.910
You know how the Spartans
vote?

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.140
They bang on their shields and
the yell.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.165
Those in favor,
those who believe the Athenians

00:29:00.165 --> 00:29:03.210
have broken the treaty.
That's the way the thing was

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.509
put to them and they indicate in
the usual way and they all bang,

00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:09.944
and those who think not,
the same noise,

00:29:09.944 --> 00:29:13.906
and then he said,
I really couldn't tell which

00:29:13.906 --> 00:29:18.252
side was the louder.
So, let's have a division and

00:29:18.252 --> 00:29:22.256
count, which was unusual,
very unusual in the Spartan

00:29:22.256 --> 00:29:26.182
assembly.
At which time he found a very

00:29:26.182 --> 00:29:29.910
large majority in favor of the
war.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.290
You know I've gone on both ways
on the question of what did he

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.839
hear and what didn't he hear the
first time,

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:38.079
and so I still don't know for
sure what happened.

00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:40.670
I mean, one interpretation is
really couldn't tell;

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.213
it was very close.
Well, why wasn't it close on

00:29:43.213 --> 00:29:45.876
the division?
Because in a place like Sparta

00:29:45.876 --> 00:29:49.877
you don't want to show yourself
as being against war when other

00:29:49.877 --> 00:29:53.599
guys are in favor of it.
That's not what brave men and

00:29:53.599 --> 00:29:57.829
Spartans do, even though you
think that would be a good idea.

00:29:57.829 --> 00:30:01.468
The other possibility is he
knew right away there was a

00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:04.039
majority, and a clear majority
for war,

00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:07.910
but he wanted everybody else to
see how big that majority was.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.469
I don't know what I think.
I think I wrote in one book one

00:30:11.469 --> 00:30:12.950
thing and in another book
another thing.

00:30:20.069 --> 00:30:24.066
So, the Spartans voted that the
Athenians had broken the peace

00:30:24.066 --> 00:30:27.079
and the implication was we
should go to war;

00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:33.788
that took place at a meeting in
Sparta probably in July of 432,

00:30:33.788 --> 00:30:38.549
but the war doesn't start--let
me back up.

00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:43.099
The Spartans don't go marching
into Attica to fight the

00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:46.470
Athenians until probably March
of 431.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:52.432
Why did it take so long for the
Spartans to fulfill what they

00:30:52.432 --> 00:30:56.409
had just voted for?
There's no really good reason

00:30:56.409 --> 00:30:58.819
why they couldn't begin
immediately.

00:30:58.819 --> 00:31:02.251
Some scholars point out
July is too late to cut down the

00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:04.869
grain in Athens,
which would already have been

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:08.290
harvested and put away.
Fine, but that's not all the

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:12.509
Spartans have to do in Athens.
One of the things they do is to

00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:15.170
go out into the farms,
burn farmhouses,

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.180
destroy as many olive trees as
they can,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.633
cut down as many grapevines as
they can, all of that can be

00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:25.849
done in July and August,
and September just as well as

00:31:25.849 --> 00:31:27.279
it can be done at any other
time.

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:29.549
So, I don't think that's a good
reason.

00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:34.984
I think what happened was that
the heat that had been stoked up

00:31:34.984 --> 00:31:40.242
by the Corinthian argument and
those of their allies--we only

00:31:40.242 --> 00:31:45.023
have the Corinthian speech,
but you can bet the Megarians

00:31:45.023 --> 00:31:49.220
and the Potidaeans laid on a
pretty hot set of complaints as

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.289
well,
so did the Island of Aegina.

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:58.059
So, it was in the heat of anger
that the Spartans voted.

00:31:58.059 --> 00:32:01.494
It must be, I think,
that when they had a chance to

00:32:01.494 --> 00:32:05.615
think it over they thought that
maybe Archidamus knew what he

00:32:05.615 --> 00:32:09.049
was talking about and they
better think again.

00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:13.612
So, there is time in this
stretch of--what is--about nine

00:32:13.612 --> 00:32:17.930
months for the negotiations that
did indeed follow.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:22.983
Missions were sent from Sparta
to Athens to try--well,

00:32:22.983 --> 00:32:28.975
we shall see to try to do what.
The first mission sent to

00:32:28.975 --> 00:32:34.438
Athens made the demand that
there need be no war,

00:32:34.438 --> 00:32:40.470
if the Athenians would simply
drive out the curse.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.390
Well, we know what that is,
the curse of the Alcmaeonidae.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.720
What Alcmaeonidae are we
talking about?

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.162
Pericles mother is an
Alcmaeonid and he's the only

00:32:51.162 --> 00:32:55.243
prominent Alcmaeonid around.
This is an attempt to--you

00:32:55.243 --> 00:32:58.660
could think it to get Pericles
out of there;

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.049
you guys don't want war just
get rid of Pericles.

00:33:01.049 --> 00:33:03.390
Well, they knew the Athenians
weren't going to do that.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.852
The idea we are engaged here in
psychological warfare,

00:33:06.852 --> 00:33:10.160
to undermine Pericles,
who they see rightly as the

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.868
driving force behind the
Athenian policies,

00:33:12.868 --> 00:33:16.026
and they want to make his
political situation more

00:33:16.026 --> 00:33:18.670
uncomfortable and cause him
trouble.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:24.521
The Athenians basically say
take a walk and that's the first

00:33:24.521 --> 00:33:27.177
mission.
Next, the Spartans send a

00:33:27.177 --> 00:33:30.423
mission which in my--so the
first one, as I say,

00:33:30.423 --> 00:33:33.740
was not a serious effort at
avoiding the war,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.910
but the second one,
in my view was.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:41.182
This second mission said to the
Athenians we want you to

00:33:41.182 --> 00:33:44.730
withdraw your troops from
Potidaea;

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:49.999
we want you to leave Aegina
autonomous as you're supposed

00:33:49.999 --> 00:33:55.079
to, and we want you to withdraw
the Megarian Decree.

00:33:55.079 --> 00:34:00.045
In fact, if you will only
withdraw the Megarian Decree

00:34:00.045 --> 00:34:02.200
there will be no war.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.291
That really changed the
situation, because we now in

00:34:10.291 --> 00:34:15.628
Athens the issue could be boiled
down by the opponents of the

00:34:15.628 --> 00:34:18.727
war,
and Thucydides lets us see that

00:34:18.727 --> 00:34:23.502
there was strong opposition to
going to war on the part of some

00:34:23.502 --> 00:34:28.124
that--why in the world are we
going to war about this embargo

00:34:28.124 --> 00:34:33.340
we have laid on the Megarians?
Who cares about that?

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.559
So, in the great final debate
about this issue,

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:39.500
what should we do,
how should we answer the

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.099
Spartan offer on this occasion?
Many speeches were made,

00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:48.578
Thucydides tells us,
but the only one he reports is

00:34:48.578 --> 00:34:52.790
that of Pericles.
Pericles makes the case as to

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:57.381
why it is necessary not to
withdraw the Megarian Decree,

00:34:57.381 --> 00:35:02.889
and it is the classic argument
against appeasement out of fear.

00:35:02.889 --> 00:35:07.194
If we do withdraw this,
we will do so only because

00:35:07.194 --> 00:35:12.148
we're afraid that the Spartans
will attack us and we're afraid

00:35:12.148 --> 00:35:15.578
to fight them.
Now, if we give way on this

00:35:15.578 --> 00:35:18.932
point why should the Spartans
ever do anything,

00:35:18.932 --> 00:35:23.233
but threaten us again when they
want something that we don't

00:35:23.233 --> 00:35:27.050
want to do?
We will be under their power;

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:31.758
you cannot give way to that
kind of a menace and still

00:35:31.758 --> 00:35:36.466
maintain a free hand or any
level of equality with the

00:35:36.466 --> 00:35:39.758
potential opponent.
That, I think,

00:35:39.758 --> 00:35:45.197
was the essence of what he had
to say along with reminding the

00:35:45.197 --> 00:35:50.726
Athenians how wrong the Spartans
were and how inappropriate was

00:35:50.726 --> 00:35:55.385
their behavior,
because he said remember we

00:35:55.385 --> 00:36:01.242
have offered to submit every
complaint that they have to

00:36:01.242 --> 00:36:04.920
arbitration.
They refused to do that.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:11.324
How can we in all honor and in
all sense of security refuse to

00:36:11.324 --> 00:36:16.369
resist that kind of behavior?
He won the day;

00:36:16.369 --> 00:36:20.280
the Athenians refused to
withdraw the Megarian Decree.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:25.769
The course of war was clearly
set.

00:36:25.769 --> 00:36:29.634
But you know even then it
was months before the war began

00:36:29.634 --> 00:36:32.340
and it wasn't the Spartans who
began it.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:37.881
It all began when the Thebans
early or late in winter I guess

00:36:37.881 --> 00:36:43.146
of 431 made a sneak attack on
the Boeotian town of Plataea

00:36:43.146 --> 00:36:47.619
which was allied to Athens.
Why did they do it?

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:50.999
Scholars suggest one of two
possibilities,

00:36:50.999 --> 00:36:55.945
either because they knew that
there was going to be a war and

00:36:55.945 --> 00:37:00.232
they wanted to gain the
strategic advantage of having

00:37:00.232 --> 00:37:04.601
Plataea which is close to the
Athenian border in their

00:37:04.601 --> 00:37:08.374
control,
or the flip side could be they

00:37:08.374 --> 00:37:13.284
were afraid there would not be a
war and they were eager that

00:37:13.284 --> 00:37:17.685
there should be a war.
We just can't be certain about

00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:19.643
it.
But what we can be certain

00:37:19.643 --> 00:37:23.497
about was the attack on Plataea
led the Plataeans to ask their

00:37:23.497 --> 00:37:28.241
Athenian allies to help them,
the Athenians at the very least

00:37:28.241 --> 00:37:33.334
had to say they would although
in the fact they did not and

00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:38.777
that would compel the Spartans
to come in and help their Theban

00:37:38.777 --> 00:37:43.079
allies and that is indeed how
the war began.

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:47.697
When in probably March of
431 the Spartan and

00:37:47.697 --> 00:37:52.891
Peloponnesian army--we don't
know how big but very much

00:37:52.891 --> 00:37:58.470
bigger than the Athenian army
came marching into Attica and

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:03.280
the war--I'm sorry I've
forgotten one thing.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.813
Before the attack on Plataea,
the Spartans sent one more

00:38:08.813 --> 00:38:14.850
mission to Athens in which they
said, forget everything we've

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:20.151
said before.
If you want peace you must free

00:38:20.151 --> 00:38:24.364
the Greeks.
That was understood to mean you

00:38:24.364 --> 00:38:29.496
must give up your empire.
The Spartans did not for a

00:38:29.496 --> 00:38:33.800
minute expect the Athenians to
do that.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.570
This was psychological warfare
for what was to follow.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:43.539
That Spartans were to fight the
war on the program,

00:38:43.539 --> 00:38:48.310
we are the liberators of the
Greeks against these

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.840
imperialistic,
aggressive Athenians who are

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.569
destroying everybody's autonomy,
and making it impossible for

00:38:55.569 --> 00:38:59.485
everybody to live comfortably;
we are the liberators and

00:38:59.485 --> 00:39:04.782
that's what we're doing.
So, now we've seen that the

00:39:04.782 --> 00:39:11.203
Athenians had refused to rescind
the decree and the war had

00:39:11.203 --> 00:39:15.620
begun.
It's worth asking why did the

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:20.219
two sides make the decisions
they did.

00:39:20.219 --> 00:39:23.740
The Spartans refused to
arbitrate.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.970
Why?
Because their whole system

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:34.281
depended upon the allies of
Sparta being able to count on

00:39:34.281 --> 00:39:40.030
the Spartans to protect them
from a third party,

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.127
when it was necessary.
So, if the Spartans said,

00:39:43.127 --> 00:39:46.060
well we're not going to do
that, we'll leave it to some

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.441
arbitrator to take care of,
then they had to worry that the

00:39:49.441 --> 00:39:52.548
fundamental reason for the
league, which gave them their

00:39:52.548 --> 00:39:57.094
power and their security,
would disappear and that would

00:39:57.094 --> 00:40:01.879
be the end of that.
They also had to worry that if

00:40:01.879 --> 00:40:06.843
they did not do what the
Corinthians and the Megarians

00:40:06.843 --> 00:40:13.138
and others wanted them to do,
the Corinthians might leave the

00:40:13.138 --> 00:40:15.803
league.
That is what the Corinthians

00:40:15.803 --> 00:40:19.559
threatened them with in their
speech as a matter of fact,

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:22.946
which itself might be something
that would lead to the

00:40:22.946 --> 00:40:25.630
dissolution of the Peloponnesian
League,

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.850
which is so crucial to Sparta.

00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:33.929
So, all of that was on their
minds.

00:40:33.929 --> 00:40:37.083
Another reason that the
Spartans were not prepared to

00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:39.730
give way was that they really
didn't believe,

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.754
the majority did not believe
what the Athenians said about

00:40:43.754 --> 00:40:47.989
how the war would be fought or
about what Archidamus said,

00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:50.280
which was to back up the
Athenian claim.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.228
They could say what they want,
but there was no instance in a

00:40:54.228 --> 00:40:58.177
Greek history ever in which one
state invaded the land of the

00:40:58.177 --> 00:41:01.644
other state,
and the other state simply let

00:41:01.644 --> 00:41:06.026
them do what harm they wanted.
No matter what the Athenians

00:41:06.026 --> 00:41:10.001
might say, no matter what you
might think that the Athenians

00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:13.834
had the capacity to do that,
they wouldn't do that and

00:41:13.834 --> 00:41:17.393
Spartans could point--what
happened the last time we

00:41:17.393 --> 00:41:21.295
invaded Attica?
445 the Athenians came out and

00:41:21.295 --> 00:41:24.470
made a treaty with us,
they conceded,

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:28.528
they backed off,
why would it be otherwise this

00:41:28.528 --> 00:41:31.278
time?
I think that you must

00:41:31.278 --> 00:41:35.763
always be aware yourself when
you're thinking about outbreaks

00:41:35.763 --> 00:41:39.650
of wars anywhere that one of the
powerful issues,

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.095
one of the things that helped
people decide one way or another

00:41:43.095 --> 00:41:46.485
is their estimate of how that
war will be fought and what the

00:41:46.485 --> 00:41:50.126
price of that war will be,
and what the chances of victory

00:41:50.126 --> 00:41:51.860
are;
that's always in your mind.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.126
You're much less likely to go
to war if you feel very

00:41:54.126 --> 00:41:55.869
confident you're going to get
smashed,

00:41:55.869 --> 00:42:01.610
or that the cost of the war
will be intolerable and so on.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:07.161
So, that was another issue.
There is a real link,

00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:10.392
in other words,
between the strategy that the

00:42:10.392 --> 00:42:14.945
Spartans expected to be able to
employ and the policy that went

00:42:14.945 --> 00:42:17.603
with it.
Now, of course,

00:42:17.603 --> 00:42:23.071
their guess about how the war
would be fought turned out to be

00:42:23.071 --> 00:42:28.329
wrong and very costly to them.
What else could they have done?

00:42:28.329 --> 00:42:30.596
Well in theory,
at least, they could have

00:42:30.596 --> 00:42:32.750
called the Corinthian bluff and
say,

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:36.365
no we're going to obey our
oaths in the previous treaty,

00:42:36.365 --> 00:42:38.930
we're going to submit to
arbitration,

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:43.643
too bad if you don't like it.
What could the Corinthians have

00:42:43.643 --> 00:42:45.943
done?
Well, they might have tried to

00:42:45.943 --> 00:42:49.565
withdraw from the league and
their own withdrawal would not

00:42:49.565 --> 00:42:52.950
have been critical,
only if they had been able to

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:56.798
bring with them other states.
We can only guess as to how

00:42:56.798 --> 00:43:00.700
successful they might have been.
Perhaps, it's not out of the

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.683
question that Megara,
being as upset as they were

00:43:03.683 --> 00:43:06.859
would have joined them.
That would have been a real

00:43:06.859 --> 00:43:09.688
strategic problem,
because between the two of them

00:43:09.688 --> 00:43:13.326
they control the isthmus and it
means the Spartans can't get out

00:43:13.326 --> 00:43:17.786
of the Peloponnesus.
So, I don't know how much of a

00:43:17.786 --> 00:43:21.237
choice that really was.
On the other hand,

00:43:21.237 --> 00:43:23.453
I'm sure there must have been
Spartans who said,

00:43:23.453 --> 00:43:25.386
say who's in charge of this
league anyway,

00:43:25.386 --> 00:43:28.333
the Corinthians or us?
We make the policy,

00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:33.265
they do what we tell them,
we don't get dragged around by

00:43:33.265 --> 00:43:36.399
them,
but then the question would be,

00:43:36.399 --> 00:43:39.300
well what if these things do
happen?

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.026
So it was, as always,
not an easy call for either

00:43:43.026 --> 00:43:43.570
side.

00:43:46.809 --> 00:43:50.932
After all, the Spartans always
had to fear the helots,

00:43:50.932 --> 00:43:55.600
and Thucydides makes the point,
I think, that it is fear of the

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.989
helots that is always at the
core of Spartan policy

00:43:58.989 --> 00:44:01.898
decisions.
Recently, scholars have decided

00:44:01.898 --> 00:44:05.299
to challenge that but I don't
think they've been very

00:44:05.299 --> 00:44:08.814
successful with that.
Thucydides describes the

00:44:08.814 --> 00:44:13.119
motives that drive states to war
and gives a wonderful triad;

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:16.630
fear, honor,
and interest and in this

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:21.507
case--it's usually some
combination of all of these

00:44:21.507 --> 00:44:23.604
things.
In this case,

00:44:23.604 --> 00:44:27.070
all of them were engaged,
but I think fear is

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:30.300
legitimately the one that's
prominent.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:34.354
It's the one that Thucydides
puts at the head of the list,

00:44:34.354 --> 00:44:37.200
and you can see why it might be
right.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.913
What about Athens?
Why did the Athenians behave as

00:44:40.913 --> 00:44:44.060
they did?
Pericles and the Athenians

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:48.369
followed this moderate policy of
deterrence.

00:44:48.369 --> 00:44:52.722
They insisted upon the terms of
the treaty, they insisted upon

00:44:52.722 --> 00:44:55.219
their equality with the
Spartans,

00:44:55.219 --> 00:44:59.236
and therefore on arbitration,
no dictation,

00:44:59.236 --> 00:45:04.175
no appeasement out of fear.
The Megarian Decree was

00:45:04.175 --> 00:45:07.471
intended as a warning,
and, I think,

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:12.076
Pericles relied on the fact,
a very unusual situation,

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:15.651
Sparta has only one king at
this time and that King is

00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:19.698
Archidamus who is a friend of
Pericles and who is in favor of

00:45:19.698 --> 00:45:22.545
peace.
Kings are very influential

00:45:22.545 --> 00:45:26.335
in Sparta, and so Pericles might
well have thought with

00:45:26.335 --> 00:45:30.224
Archidamus on my side,
the Spartans will understand

00:45:30.224 --> 00:45:33.960
that I've no aggressive
intentions against them,

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.998
I don't want to wreck their
league, I don't want to do

00:45:36.998 --> 00:45:39.577
anything to them,
but they will simply have to

00:45:39.577 --> 00:45:43.475
arbitrate these problems,
and they'll see that and he was

00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:45.985
wrong.
He was confident hereto--it's

00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:50.274
the same issue of the question
of how does strategy and policy,

00:45:50.274 --> 00:45:53.110
how do these connect with one
another?

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:58.119
He believed that his strategy
could not fail.

00:45:58.119 --> 00:46:01.832
The Spartans could invade,
could do what harm they liked,

00:46:01.832 --> 00:46:05.810
the Athenians would be able to
live through whatever they did

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:09.538
without taking casualties,
simply losing property,

00:46:09.538 --> 00:46:13.619
because they had the empire
that they could live off,

00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:16.151
which would bring them the
money they needed to buy

00:46:16.151 --> 00:46:19.239
everything they wanted and they
had nothing to fear at sea.

00:46:19.239 --> 00:46:23.408
So, surely the Spartans,
after they cooled off,

00:46:23.408 --> 00:46:28.029
would see that they couldn't
win and then why fight,

00:46:28.029 --> 00:46:32.559
because they just couldn't harm
the Athenians.

00:46:32.559 --> 00:46:37.043
It was a strategy that was
totally rational and that's what

00:46:37.043 --> 00:46:40.869
was wrong with it.
It didn't take account of the

00:46:40.869 --> 00:46:45.463
irrationalities that governed
human beings so much of the

00:46:45.463 --> 00:46:48.219
time.
It didn't take account of the

00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:52.199
fact that the Spartans were both
angry and frightened,

00:46:52.199 --> 00:46:55.889
and finally that the Spartans
didn't have the imagination,

00:46:55.889 --> 00:46:59.125
and I mean I don't want to put
the Spartans down as

00:46:59.125 --> 00:47:01.650
particularly blind in this
respect.

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:05.519
It seems to me all Greeks would
have had the same doubts;

00:47:05.519 --> 00:47:07.465
they didn't have the
imagination to think that

00:47:07.465 --> 00:47:09.409
anybody would do what Pericles
had in mind.

00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:11.933
And even if it was explained to
them, they'd say they won't do

00:47:11.933 --> 00:47:13.728
it.
Because to do so from the

00:47:13.728 --> 00:47:16.715
Spartan and Greek perspective
would be cowardly,

00:47:16.715 --> 00:47:20.146
and would the Athenians be
willing to be shown up to be

00:47:20.146 --> 00:47:24.022
such terrible cowards as they
would have to be standing behind

00:47:24.022 --> 00:47:27.039
their walls,
watching the Spartans ripping

00:47:27.039 --> 00:47:29.410
up their homes,
destroying their crops,

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:33.279
and calling them every name in
the book as they shouted beneath

00:47:33.279 --> 00:47:38.039
their walls.
They thought not.

00:47:38.039 --> 00:47:42.118
So, Pericles and the
Athenians, I think,

00:47:42.118 --> 00:47:47.903
went wrong as the Spartans did
really in anticipating what was

00:47:47.903 --> 00:47:50.802
going to happen,
and finally,

00:47:50.802 --> 00:47:54.917
I would make this point.
I make it as a general point

00:47:54.917 --> 00:47:59.190
about the outbreaks of wars
anywhere, anytime and that is,

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:05.002
if you are going to use a
strategy of deterrence you must

00:48:05.002 --> 00:48:10.400
have available to you a powerful
offensive threat.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.538
It's one thing to say,
as Pericles was in effect

00:48:13.538 --> 00:48:16.409
saying, you can't hurt me so
don't fight.

00:48:16.409 --> 00:48:22.260
You have to be able to show the
enemy I can hurt you very badly;

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:26.123
so don't fight,
and Pericles had no intention

00:48:26.123 --> 00:48:31.480
of employing anything like a
very serious offensive threat.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.533
There were ways he might have
been able to do this or that,

00:48:34.533 --> 00:48:36.639
but that was not what was on
his mind.

00:48:36.639 --> 00:48:40.279
He expected that the Spartans
would behave fundamentally

00:48:40.279 --> 00:48:42.299
rationally.
They would calculate their

00:48:42.299 --> 00:48:44.530
chances of victory,
they would see they had none,

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:50.138
and they would negotiate,
which means accept arbitration

00:48:50.138 --> 00:48:54.207
and get out of this fix.
In my view,

00:48:54.207 --> 00:48:59.217
neither side wanted war,
but neither side was ready to

00:48:59.217 --> 00:49:03.659
yield for the reasons that I
have suggested.

00:49:03.659 --> 00:49:10.280
It's not that this was in my
view an irrepressible conflict.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.836
I use the terminology of the
American Civil War,

00:49:13.836 --> 00:49:18.075
because really that's what
Thucydides is saying about the

00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:21.324
Peloponnesian War;
that it was an irrepressible

00:49:21.324 --> 00:49:23.059
conflict.
I think not.

00:49:23.059 --> 00:49:28.300
I think mistakes were made,
mistakes of judgment on both

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:34.924
sides that produced the outcome.
Both sides felt that they could

00:49:34.924 --> 00:49:40.928
not back down and as Lincoln
would say of his great war,

00:49:40.928 --> 00:49:45.806
"and the war came."
I don't really think it was a

00:49:45.806 --> 00:49:49.650
case of one side deciding,
let's have a war.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:53.188
I think it was they both
stumbled into it as a

00:49:53.188 --> 00:49:58.143
consequence of the situation and
their misunderstandings of what

00:49:58.143 --> 00:49:59.480
was going on.

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:07.949
So, now to turn to the war
itself.

00:50:07.949 --> 00:50:12.525
I have long ago concluded that
running through the war at the

00:50:12.525 --> 00:50:17.177
pace that's available to me in
time will be too superficial to

00:50:17.177 --> 00:50:20.882
be anything but silly,
so I won't try to tell you what

00:50:20.882 --> 00:50:24.440
happened in the war but you have
a pretty good informant there,

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:29.276
his name is Thucydides and your
textbook can fill the rest of it

00:50:29.276 --> 00:50:31.831
in.
What I'd like to do in the time

00:50:31.831 --> 00:50:36.105
available to me to talk about
the war is to pursue a couple of

00:50:36.105 --> 00:50:40.449
topics in some depth to help you
understand some aspects of the

00:50:40.449 --> 00:50:43.971
war,
rather than the hopeless effort

00:50:43.971 --> 00:50:47.610
to describe the war to you so
briefly.

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:53.093
So, I want to talk to you first
about the main source that we

00:50:53.093 --> 00:50:58.302
have for understanding the war
and the great historian who

00:50:58.302 --> 00:51:01.016
wrote it,
Thucydides, in his history of

00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:01.490
the war.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:10.107
I guess when I give this as a
separate talk to people I use

00:51:10.107 --> 00:51:14.667
the title, "Thucydides the
Revisionist Historian of the

00:51:14.667 --> 00:51:20.429
Peloponnesian War,"
and let me just do that for you.

00:51:20.429 --> 00:51:25.490
Now, just that title ought
to raise a number of questions.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.719
Who is this guy?
Who is this Thucydides?

00:51:27.719 --> 00:51:32.665
Why should we be interested in
what he wrote over 2,400 years

00:51:32.665 --> 00:51:35.433
ago?
Also, what is a revisionist and

00:51:35.433 --> 00:51:39.173
how can Thucydides be a
revisionist when he seems to

00:51:39.173 --> 00:51:43.719
have been the first man to write
a history of the Peloponnesian

00:51:43.719 --> 00:51:46.576
War?
What was there for him to

00:51:46.576 --> 00:51:49.507
revise?
Well, Thucydides was an

00:51:49.507 --> 00:51:54.834
Athenian aristocrat who came of
age at the height of the

00:51:54.834 --> 00:52:00.719
greatness of Periclean Athens.
He appears to have been born,

00:52:00.719 --> 00:52:05.031
let us say about 460 B.C.
He was not yet thirty,

00:52:05.031 --> 00:52:10.217
when the Great War broke out,
with two interruptions that war

00:52:10.217 --> 00:52:15.541
lasted for twenty seven years,
and left Greece shattered,

00:52:15.541 --> 00:52:19.250
impoverished and permanently
weakened.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:24.733
Never again were the Greeks
masters of their fate and that

00:52:24.733 --> 00:52:29.452
war was his subject.
But why should a war among

00:52:29.452 --> 00:52:32.750
the ancient Greeks interest us
today?

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:37.403
One answer lies in Thucydides'
definition of his task and in

00:52:37.403 --> 00:52:40.480
the skill in which he carried it
out.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.750
He said, it may well be that my
history will seem less easy to

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:49.240
read and he means here,
less easy to read than

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:52.565
Herodotus with all those
wonderful funny stories that he

00:52:52.565 --> 00:52:56.137
tells,
because of the absence in it of

00:52:56.137 --> 00:53:00.329
a romantic element.
Take that Herodotus.

00:53:00.329 --> 00:53:04.977
It will be enough for me,
however, if these words of mine

00:53:04.977 --> 00:53:10.039
are judged useful for those who
want to understand clearly the

00:53:10.039 --> 00:53:13.110
events that happened in the
past,

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:17.514
and which human nature being
what it is, will at some time or

00:53:17.514 --> 00:53:22.679
other and in much the same ways,
be repeated in the future.

00:53:22.679 --> 00:53:27.201
My work is not a piece of
writing designed to meet the

00:53:27.201 --> 00:53:32.234
tastes of an immediate public
like Herodotus is who read his

00:53:32.234 --> 00:53:40.469
history out in public readings.
My work is a possession forever.

00:53:40.469 --> 00:53:45.110
Now, that may sound
immodest, but his expectation

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:49.958
obviously was justified.
For his work has lasted and

00:53:49.958 --> 00:53:55.859
been judged useful to this very
day, perhaps more influential in

00:53:55.859 --> 00:54:00.849
our time than any time before.
But what's a revisionist?

00:54:00.849 --> 00:54:03.930
In a sense, of course,
all historians are revisionist,

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.186
for each tries to make some
contribution that changes our

00:54:07.186 --> 00:54:10.592
understanding of the past.
When we use the term

00:54:10.592 --> 00:54:15.249
revisionist, we refer to a
writer who tries to change the

00:54:15.249 --> 00:54:19.988
readers' mind in a major way,
to provide a new general

00:54:19.988 --> 00:54:24.924
interpretation sharply and
thoroughly to change our way of

00:54:24.924 --> 00:54:29.449
looking at the matter.
The term seems to have been

00:54:29.449 --> 00:54:32.769
used first after the First World
War.

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:36.479
Most people who lived in the
allied nations believed that the

00:54:36.479 --> 00:54:40.312
central powers were responsible
for bringing it on and deserved

00:54:40.312 --> 00:54:43.589
to be punished for it.
Soon after the war,

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:48.162
some people began to argue that
Germany and Austria were no more

00:54:48.162 --> 00:54:52.154
responsible than Russia,
France, and England and perhaps

00:54:52.154 --> 00:54:54.221
less.
Soon historians,

00:54:54.221 --> 00:54:57.993
called revisionists,
argued in support of that

00:54:57.993 --> 00:55:01.321
position.
Before long the new view

00:55:01.321 --> 00:55:07.320
captured the minds of educated
people in England and America,

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.068
even some Frenchmen were
convinced and the Bolshevik

00:55:11.068 --> 00:55:14.743
government of Russia did not
need convincing of the

00:55:14.743 --> 00:55:17.610
wickedness of their czarist
regime;

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:21.559
since then the phenomenon has
been calming.

00:55:21.559 --> 00:55:23.842
A few writers,
most notably A.J.P.

00:55:23.842 --> 00:55:27.784
Taylor tried to revise the
common opinion that held Hitler

00:55:27.784 --> 00:55:32.210
responsible for the Second World
War, and had great success for a

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.944
while.
Later, the causes of the Cold

00:55:34.944 --> 00:55:38.556
War and of the American War in
Vietnam underwent similar

00:55:38.556 --> 00:55:41.483
treatment.
These attempts to reverse

00:55:41.483 --> 00:55:44.699
opinion have had great practical
importance.

00:55:44.699 --> 00:55:48.478
What happened in the past and
even more important,

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:53.104
what we think happened has a
powerful influence on the way we

00:55:53.104 --> 00:55:58.384
respond to our current problems.
What historians say happened,

00:55:58.384 --> 00:56:03.220
and what they say it means,
therefore, makes a very great

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:06.445
difference.
Let me just remind you about

00:56:06.445 --> 00:56:10.692
the controversy about the First
World War to illustrate that

00:56:10.692 --> 00:56:13.360
point.
The Americans and the English,

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:16.256
in particular,
came to feel that Germany was

00:56:16.256 --> 00:56:19.691
wrongly blamed and therefore
unjustly treated by the

00:56:19.691 --> 00:56:23.686
Versailles Treaty.
Americans used this as the main

00:56:23.686 --> 00:56:28.657
justification for rejecting that
treaty and then retreating into

00:56:28.657 --> 00:56:32.113
isolation from foreign affairs.
The English,

00:56:32.113 --> 00:56:35.530
of course, couldn't go that
far, but their belief that

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:39.655
Germany was falsely accused made
it easy to permit and to justify

00:56:39.655 --> 00:56:42.170
Hitler's violations of the
treaty.

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:46.699
Feelings of guilt helped
support a policy of disarmament,

00:56:46.699 --> 00:56:49.449
unpreparedness,
and appeasement.

00:56:49.449 --> 00:56:53.836
The English poet W.H.
Auden, responding to Hitler's

00:56:53.836 --> 00:56:58.059
invasion of Poland in a poem
called, "September 1,

00:56:58.059 --> 00:57:03.029
1939," a poem that was
subsequently deleted from

00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:07.721
collections of his poetry,
revealed how deeply the idea

00:57:07.721 --> 00:57:11.000
had penetrated and how late,
in spite of everything,

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.110
it lasted.
Here's what he says,

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:18.264
"Accurate scholarship can
unearth the whole offense from

00:57:18.264 --> 00:57:22.040
Luther until now that has driven
a culture mad.

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:27.100
Find what occurred at Lynce.
What huge Imago made a

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:31.837
psychopathic god?
I and the public know what all

00:57:31.837 --> 00:57:36.963
school children learn.
Those to whom evil is done,

00:57:36.963 --> 00:57:41.025
do evil in return."
So we are to understand Hitler

00:57:41.025 --> 00:57:44.742
and Nazi Germany as simply
responding to the bad deal they

00:57:44.742 --> 00:57:48.980
got at the Battle of Versailles
and that's all there is to it.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.963
More recent scholarship is
shown to most people's

00:57:51.963 --> 00:57:55.233
satisfaction that the opinions
of contemporaries were more

00:57:55.233 --> 00:57:58.857
right than the revisionists,
that the general blame for the

00:57:58.857 --> 00:58:02.432
First World War can be laid at
Germany's door and that guilty

00:58:02.432 --> 00:58:05.429
feelings were unjustified,
but it's too late.

00:58:05.429 --> 00:58:08.982
The revisionist historians did
their work so well,

00:58:08.982 --> 00:58:13.332
and it fit so nicely into the
climate of opinion of the 1920s

00:58:13.332 --> 00:58:16.812
and 30s that these people
captured the minds of a

00:58:16.812 --> 00:58:21.017
generation and helped to move
them in a direction that they

00:58:21.017 --> 00:58:25.244
wanted to go.
So, what historians write and

00:58:25.244 --> 00:58:31.119
what teachers teach can really
matter, mostly in the negative.

00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:34.575
I mean, if we teach you
anything right you forget it,

00:58:34.575 --> 00:58:37.099
but if we get it wrong you
remember.

00:58:37.099 --> 00:58:39.709
Thucydides,
as much as anyone who has ever

00:58:39.709 --> 00:58:43.130
written, believed in the
practical importance of history,

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:47.660
so, we should expect him to be
eager to set straight any errors

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:50.730
of fact or interpretation that
he found.

00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:55.861
But his revisionist tendencies
are clear on a larger scale than

00:58:55.861 --> 00:58:59.090
detail, he has the evidence of
Homer,

00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:02.429
for instance to show,
he uses it, that it was the

00:59:02.429 --> 00:59:06.047
poverty of the Greeks,
not the bravery of the Trojans

00:59:06.047 --> 00:59:08.829
that made the siege of Troy so
long.

00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:13.226
He seems to have been the first
one to present the view that the

00:59:13.226 --> 00:59:17.553
Peloponnesian War was one single
conflict that began in 431 and

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:21.389
ended in 427,
not a series of separate wars.

00:59:21.389 --> 00:59:26.159
But my question again is what
was there to revise?

00:59:26.159 --> 00:59:29.704
The answer, I think,
is the same as in the modern

00:59:29.704 --> 00:59:32.692
instances, I mentioned.
The not yet,

00:59:32.692 --> 00:59:36.025
fully formed,
or written opinions of

00:59:36.025 --> 00:59:40.122
contemporaries.
In modern times these are

00:59:40.122 --> 00:59:43.887
very easy to recover.
Some of us still remember them,

00:59:43.887 --> 00:59:46.539
and in any case,
modern revisionists always

00:59:46.539 --> 00:59:51.800
confront and argue against them.
Thucydides' method is different.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:59.872
He argues with no one and he
vents no alternative view even

00:59:59.872 --> 01:00:03.415
to refute it.
There are a couple of

01:00:03.415 --> 01:00:07.019
exceptions, but even then he
doesn't mention anybody,

01:00:07.019 --> 01:00:10.000
who holds the view he's going
to refute.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.016
He just puts forward the view.
He gives the reader only the

01:00:15.016 --> 01:00:19.925
necessary facts and conclusions
that he has distilled from them

01:00:19.925 --> 01:00:23.329
after careful investigation and
thought.

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:29.336
He has been so successful that
for more than 2,400 years few

01:00:29.336 --> 01:00:35.139
readers have been aware that any
other opinion existed.

01:00:35.139 --> 01:00:39.641
But a careful reading of
Thucydides himself and of a few

01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:44.552
other ancient sources shows that
there were other opinions in

01:00:44.552 --> 01:00:48.971
Thucydides' time and that his
history is a powerful and

01:00:48.971 --> 01:00:54.046
effective polemic against them.
One interesting dispute

01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:58.063
involved the causes of and
responsibility for the war,

01:00:58.063 --> 01:01:03.353
which I've been chatting about.
To the ordinary contemporary,

01:01:03.353 --> 01:01:08.873
the war must have seemed the
result of a series of incidents

01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:13.530
beginning about 436 B.C.
at Epidamnus.

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:18.055
There, a Civil War brought
about the conflict with Corcyra,

01:01:18.055 --> 01:01:22.424
the quarrel threatened the
general peace when Athens made

01:01:22.424 --> 01:01:26.403
an alliance--I'm sorry with
Corcyra against Sparta's

01:01:26.403 --> 01:01:30.309
Corinthian ally,
during the winter Potidaea.

01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:32.593
I'm not going to go through
that because you know all about

01:01:32.593 --> 01:01:32.790
it.

01:01:35.949 --> 01:01:39.033
The opposition to the war,
I remind you,

01:01:39.033 --> 01:01:43.855
focused on the Megarian Decree,
as its cause and held Pericles

01:01:43.855 --> 01:01:47.650
responsible for both the decree
and the war.

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:52.874
In 425 the comic poet
Aristophanes presented a play

01:01:52.874 --> 01:01:57.939
called, Acharnians.
The war had by that time

01:01:57.939 --> 01:02:02.751
dragged on for six long and
painful years and his comic

01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:07.030
hero, Dikaiopolis,
has decided to make a separate

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:11.411
peace for himself.
This so angers the patriotic

01:02:11.411 --> 01:02:16.323
and bellicose chorus that the
hero is forced to explain that

01:02:16.323 --> 01:02:20.070
it was not the Spartans who
began the war.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:24.772
Here's what Dikaiopolis
says, "Some vice ridden

01:02:24.772 --> 01:02:28.440
wretches, men of no honor,
false men,

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.537
not even real citizens,
they kept denouncing Megara's

01:02:32.537 --> 01:02:37.579
little coats and if everyone,
anyone ever saw a cucumber,

01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:41.526
a hair, a suckling pig,
a clove of garlic,

01:02:41.526 --> 01:02:46.437
or a lump of salt all were
denounced as Megarian and

01:02:46.437 --> 01:02:49.660
confiscated."
Then he goes on,

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:55.156
"Some drunken Athenians stole a
Megarian woman and in return

01:02:55.156 --> 01:03:00.279
some Megarians stole three
prostitutes from the house of

01:03:00.279 --> 01:03:03.559
Aspasia,
Pericles' mistress."

01:03:03.559 --> 01:03:07.291
Next the infuriated Pericles,
I quote, again,

01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:11.871
"Enacted laws which sounded
which sounded like drinking

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:15.144
songs,
that the Megarians must leave

01:03:15.144 --> 01:03:18.989
our land, our market,
our sea, our continent.

01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:22.185
Then, when the Megarians were
slowly starving,

01:03:22.185 --> 01:03:26.375
they begged the Spartans to get
the law of the three harlots

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:30.280
withdrawn.
We refused though they asked us

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.880
often, and from that came the
clash of shields."

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.817
Now, using the evidence of
Athenian comedy to understand

01:03:38.817 --> 01:03:41.820
contemporary politics is a
tricky business.

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:46.478
Just imagine the trouble
somebody 2,000 years from now

01:03:46.478 --> 01:03:51.840
would have making sense of a Jay
Leno monologue or a skit from

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.148
Saturday Night Live.
Aristophanes is clearly having

01:03:56.148 --> 01:04:00.178
fun by connecting the Megarian
Decree, which we know was

01:04:00.178 --> 01:04:03.555
supported by Pericles,
with the rape of women,

01:04:03.555 --> 01:04:06.713
which according to Homer
started the Trojan War,

01:04:06.713 --> 01:04:10.406
and according to Herodotus,
was said to have caused the war

01:04:10.406 --> 01:04:12.840
between the Greeks and the
Persians as well.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:17.656
Still he does make the Megarian
Decree and the Athenian refusal

01:04:17.656 --> 01:04:21.539
to withdraw it central to the
coming of the war,

01:04:21.539 --> 01:04:26.639
both in Acharnians and in
another comedy he wrote called

01:04:26.639 --> 01:04:30.747
Peace, performed in 421.
In the latter play,

01:04:30.747 --> 01:04:34.289
he makes Hermes the god,
explain to the war weary

01:04:34.289 --> 01:04:38.570
Athenian farmers how peace was
lost in the first place,

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:42.878
I quote, "The beginning of our
trouble was the disgrace of

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:45.930
Phidias."
He is referring to the great

01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:50.689
sculptor who had been charged
with impiety in connection with

01:04:50.689 --> 01:04:55.210
the great statue of Athena that
he had constructed for the

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:57.530
Parthenon.
Then Pericles,

01:04:57.530 --> 01:05:02.455
"fearing he might share in the
misfortune, because Phidias was

01:05:02.455 --> 01:05:06.130
his close friend,
dreading your ill nature,

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:09.758
that is the Athenians and your
stubborn ways,

01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:14.951
before he could suffer harm set
the city aflame with that little

01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:19.675
spark the Megarian Decree."
Well, the full context reveals

01:05:19.675 --> 01:05:23.845
that the connection between the
attacks on the great sculptor

01:05:23.845 --> 01:05:26.623
Phidias,
Pericles' friend and associate,

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:30.000
and the Megarian Decree was
Aristophanes' own joke,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.322
but it was taken seriously by
other ancient writers,

01:05:34.322 --> 01:05:38.814
and it surely reflected charges
that were made by real

01:05:38.814 --> 01:05:41.949
contemporary enemies of
Pericles.

01:05:41.949 --> 01:05:46.620
The hard kernel of opinion
central to all this is the

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:52.188
common belief that the cause of
the war was the Megarian Degree

01:05:52.188 --> 01:05:56.230
and that Pericles was
responsible for it.

01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:59.938
Well, of course,
that view, at the very most,

01:05:59.938 --> 01:06:04.420
is an over simplification and
any good historian would have

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.820
rejected it as a sufficient
explanation.

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:11.670
Thucydides, in fact,
gives it very little attention.

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:16.030
He doesn't mention it in its
natural place in the narrative.

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:19.889
He doesn't give its date.
He doesn't tell us the purpose,

01:06:19.889 --> 01:06:22.969
and he doesn't tell us how it
worked in practice.

01:06:22.969 --> 01:06:27.244
He does not conceal the fact
that the peace was conditional

01:06:27.244 --> 01:06:30.855
on its withdrawal,
or that it became the center of

01:06:30.855 --> 01:06:35.425
the final debate in Athens.
His way of refuting the common

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:39.844
opinion was to indicate its
unimportance by the small place

01:06:39.844 --> 01:06:44.128
it occupies in his account,
and to include it among all the

01:06:44.128 --> 01:06:47.480
specific quarrels that he
regards as insignificant.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.894
His own explicit interpretation
is a sweeping revision of the

01:06:52.894 --> 01:06:57.225
usual explanation,
and it's the one I've told you

01:06:57.225 --> 01:07:00.663
about before.
He states that same

01:07:00.663 --> 01:07:05.298
explanation, in other words,
twice more in his account of

01:07:05.298 --> 01:07:09.932
the wars' origins and the whole
first book is a carefully

01:07:09.932 --> 01:07:14.650
organized unit meant to support
that interpretation.

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:18.742
So skillfully and powerfully
did he work that his

01:07:18.742 --> 01:07:23.686
interpretation has convinced all
but a few readers over the

01:07:23.686 --> 01:07:26.995
centuries.
I should point out that in

01:07:26.995 --> 01:07:31.715
spite of my clearing up that
error, it's been available for

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:34.989
about forty years now.
I hate to tell but most people

01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:36.850
still agree with Thucydides and
not with me.

01:07:39.949 --> 01:07:46.599
The revisionist view quickly
and lastingly became orthodoxy.

01:07:46.599 --> 01:07:53.007
Another controversy surrounds
Pericles most unusual strategy

01:07:53.007 --> 01:07:59.849
for waging the war and I'll talk
to you about that next time.

01:07:59.849 --> 01:08:05.230
So, let me move onto the next
point.

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:06.220
Just give me a second.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.120
Here we go.

01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:34.840
Sorry about this.

01:08:42.529 --> 01:08:47.485
The point that I want to
make--the other instance that I

01:08:47.485 --> 01:08:52.260
want to bring to your attention
is in the summary that

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:57.666
Thucydides makes of Pericles'
career and of his importance to

01:08:57.666 --> 01:09:02.510
Athens in Chapter 65 of Book II,
after Pericles' death.

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:06.088
He interrupts the narrative to
give you this really lengthy

01:09:06.088 --> 01:09:10.273
evaluation.
One of the things he says in

01:09:10.273 --> 01:09:17.402
that evaluation is that Athens
in the time of Pericles was a

01:09:17.402 --> 01:09:23.237
democracy in name,
but the rule of the first

01:09:23.237 --> 01:09:27.916
citizen in fact.
That is a remarkably powerful

01:09:27.916 --> 01:09:32.156
statement.
He is saying that Periclean

01:09:32.156 --> 01:09:39.648
Athens was not a democracy and
that it was in effect some kind

01:09:39.648 --> 01:09:47.140
of an autocratic government with
Pericles as the autocrat.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:54.082
I would say that all the
evidence we have suggests that

01:09:54.082 --> 01:09:58.645
that is not accurate.
Just a few points to illustrate

01:09:58.645 --> 01:10:01.339
why that is so--I mean,
one way to do that I think is

01:10:01.339 --> 01:10:04.368
by comparison.
People have suggested that what

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:07.279
Thucydides is saying is like
what Augustus,

01:10:07.279 --> 01:10:10.189
the Emperor or Rome said about
himself,

01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:14.764
that he ruled not by any
particular power,

01:10:14.764 --> 01:10:20.899
not by potestas,
but by his auctoritas,

01:10:20.899 --> 01:10:25.050
that is to say by the influence
that his persona and his

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:28.219
achievements,
and all those things had over

01:10:28.219 --> 01:10:31.373
his fellow citizens.
Well, in the case of

01:10:31.373 --> 01:10:34.843
Augustus it was a flat lie.
Augustus had a monopoly of all

01:10:34.843 --> 01:10:37.890
the armed force there was in the
Mediterranean.

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:42.227
He also had a vast treasury
that he could use for his own

01:10:42.227 --> 01:10:45.180
purposes.
He was, as all historians in

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:49.604
the modern world made perfectly
clear, he was an emperor who

01:10:49.604 --> 01:10:52.789
ruled,
no matter what instruments he

01:10:52.789 --> 01:10:57.215
used, it was a one-man rule.
In a second you can see how it

01:10:57.215 --> 01:11:00.966
doesn't apply to Pericles.
Pericles had no armed forces

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:04.699
available to him;
he could not enforce anything

01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:09.727
by pulling out some soldiers to
do anything that he wanted to

01:11:09.727 --> 01:11:12.351
do.
Any use of any armed forces

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:16.358
always had to be voted by the
assembly, and debated,

01:11:16.358 --> 01:11:19.422
and discussed,
and a majority determined

01:11:19.422 --> 01:11:23.766
whether it could be done.
Moreover, every month the

01:11:23.766 --> 01:11:26.310
question was raised,
as you know,

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:30.602
is Pericles like all the other
generals, okay or has he

01:11:30.602 --> 01:11:33.933
violated anything.
Charges could be brought

01:11:33.933 --> 01:11:36.941
against him, he could be brought
to court and that's what

01:11:36.941 --> 01:11:39.680
happened to him in the middle of
the war in 430.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:44.616
His enemies did bring charges
against him, he was convicted,

01:11:44.616 --> 01:11:48.800
he was removed temporarily from
the generalship,

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.350
and he had to pay a very,
very heavy fine.

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:54.010
This is not the business of
dictators.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:59.140
So, very briefly,
Thucydides is wrong about that.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:04.536
Why did he want to say that?
This gets to my own explanation

01:12:04.536 --> 01:12:08.873
of how we can understand.
I've made the argument that

01:12:08.873 --> 01:12:11.439
he's wrong about the origins of
war.

01:12:11.439 --> 01:12:16.986
Next time, I'll make the case
that he was wrong in fully

01:12:16.986 --> 01:12:22.936
supporting Pericles strategy in
the Peloponnesian War as the

01:12:22.936 --> 01:12:26.522
correct one.
I'll make the claim that the

01:12:26.522 --> 01:12:29.001
opposite is true.
If I'm right,

01:12:29.001 --> 01:12:32.350
why in the world did he say the
things he did?

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:34.720
I think we need to understand
his situation.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.402
In 424 he was a general
commanding Athenian naval forces

01:12:39.402 --> 01:12:42.924
in the north.
He was away from the place

01:12:42.924 --> 01:12:47.587
where they expected him to be
when there was a suddenly

01:12:47.587 --> 01:12:51.818
surprise seizure of the
important Athenian city of

01:12:51.818 --> 01:12:55.556
Amphipolis,
a charge was brought against

01:12:55.556 --> 01:13:00.270
him, he was brought to trial,
and he was found guilty and

01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:04.893
sent into exile.
He spent the last twenty years

01:13:04.893 --> 01:13:09.649
of the war in exile.
Probably, I would guess,

01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:15.699
among fellow exiles and fellow
opponents of the Athenian

01:13:15.699 --> 01:13:19.094
democracy,
because he is very clearly a

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:21.479
critic of the Athenian
democracy.

01:13:21.479 --> 01:13:24.411
There he had to speak all
the time to people who said,

01:13:24.411 --> 01:13:26.936
wait a minute Thucydides,
let me get this right,

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.848
you think Pericles was a
terrific guy,

01:13:28.848 --> 01:13:31.363
don't you?
Yeah, I do, he would have had

01:13:31.363 --> 01:13:34.144
to say that.
They said, besides didn't you

01:13:34.144 --> 01:13:37.917
get elected general in 424 and
wasn't that about the most

01:13:37.917 --> 01:13:41.960
radical year in the entire
history of Athenian democracy?

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.464
Weren't you a great pal?
How could it be a blue blood

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:48.593
like you, who knows what
nonsense democracy is,

01:13:48.593 --> 01:13:51.789
how could you possibly hold
those positions?

01:13:51.789 --> 01:13:55.117
And in my view,
his history is his answer to

01:13:55.117 --> 01:13:58.505
those questions.
You think that the war is about

01:13:58.505 --> 01:14:02.302
the Megarian Decree and that
Pericles is responsible for it,

01:14:02.302 --> 01:14:06.104
you're completely wrong.
The war was inevitable,

01:14:06.104 --> 01:14:11.488
and became so as soon as the
Athenian Empire came on board to

01:14:11.488 --> 01:14:16.583
challenge the Spartan hegemony.
Your view is naīve and

01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:19.140
ignorant.
So, please pay attention to my

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.359
history when I get it fully
written.

01:14:21.359 --> 01:14:27.300
You think that Pericles was
a democrat you bloody fool;

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.880
he was a man who ruled over
others;

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.800
he did not take his orders from
the assembly.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.329
You think that we lost the war,
because we had a bad strategy?

01:14:41.329 --> 01:14:46.072
The truth is the strategy was
right, and if his successors had

01:14:46.072 --> 01:14:49.726
not abandoned that,
they would have held out and

01:14:49.726 --> 01:14:52.916
won the war.
So, you see all of your main

01:14:52.916 --> 01:14:56.880
ideas about what's happened to
us in the past are wrong,

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.193
and that is why I did what I
did and I was right to do so

01:15:02.193 --> 01:15:06.869
every step of the way.
That was his history and in my

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:10.390
view was not merely an account
of the past;

01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:15.120
it was an apologia pro vita
sua, a defense of his own

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.529
life and of the great decisions
that were made in it.

01:15:19.529 --> 01:15:22.720
Of course, what I've just said
is highly controversial.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.000
Next time we'll talk about the
strategy in the war.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.770
Prof: I guess what I'll
do today is talk a little bit

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.250
about the fall of communism.
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.618
It's hard to believe,
because all that happened,

00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:10.691
and now, next year it will be
the twentieth anniversary of the

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:11.750
fall of the Wall.
 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.240
You guys were not born yet,
a few of you.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.400
Some of you were born in 1990.
 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.340
Is that possible?
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.860
Were you born in 1990,
some of you?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.660
See, that's after the Wall fell.
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.096
I can remember seeing on TV the
quick trial of the Ceaucescu

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:33.608
couple, and them being gunned
down in the garden behind their

00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:34.360
house.
 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.200
They were really a nasty pair.
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.760
But now it seems like old
history.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.924
I'm going to talk a little bit
about that and then talk about

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:46.772
kind of global challenges,
and themes that we've talked

00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:47.300
about.
 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.088
We talk about immigration;
we talk more about

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:52.770
globalization.
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.570
But I'm going to talk a little
bit about that,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.810
too.
 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.730
Let's do that.
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.190
Then we're out of here.
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.796
Again, it seems like this
is--to some of you it's not

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:06.629
history at all.
 

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.503
It's something that we all
lived through,

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:13.239
and in a way anticipated,
and then saw developing.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.052
We were in France when all that
was happening,

00:01:15.052 --> 00:01:16.662
and just listening on the
radio, and BBC,

00:01:16.662 --> 00:01:17.590
and all this stuff.
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.000
It was really quite amazing.
 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.310
The big difference, of course,
that made possible the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.938
dramatic,
dramatic changes that happened

00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:36.540
in Eastern Europe between 1989
and 1992 must begin with a guy

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.013
who,
independent of the fact that

00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:41.120
the Soviet system just didn't
work,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.113
but with a guy whose declining
reputation in Russia I find just

00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:49.580
incredible.
 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.560
That's Mikhail Gorbachev.
 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.080
It was relegated a few years
ago, he actually did a TV ad for

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.450
Burger King, at that point,
because he needed the money.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.274
The fall of his image in the
former Soviet Union and Russia I

00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:13.360
find extraordinarily hard to
imagine.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.349
It made all the difference in
the world that when people in

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.564
Hungary and in Czechoslovakia,
which then split between the

00:02:22.564 --> 00:02:27.145
Czech Republic and Slovakia,
and in Poland--and in other

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:29.628
places,
but mostly those three

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:32.658
places--when they began to push
for reforms,

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:36.068
and they decide that they
wanted to reform communism,

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:37.979
and they didn't want even
communism at all.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:44.139
The big difference was in 1953
when there were riots in East

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:50.196
Berlin, and I'm old enough to
remember crossing the border,

00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:53.120
the Wall in East Berlin.
 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.970
They were squished like grapes.
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.580
In 1968,
when Dubcek,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.560
who ends up basically with
janitorial duties after that,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.229
tried to put a human face on
communism and reform communism,

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.020
there were,
as the expression goes,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.968
tanks before teatime.
 

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:19.627
The Soviet tanks rolled in and
squished them,

00:03:19.627 --> 00:03:22.068
too, like grapes.
 

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:25.919
They had their martyrs in
Wenceslaus Square.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.688
One guy burned himself to death
in protest.

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:36.019
It's still a memory embedded in
the collective memory of that

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:36.729
place.
 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.008
But there was a big difference.
 

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:40.305
There was a big,
big difference,

00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:44.452
in that Gorbachev made clear
that there wouldn't be tanks

00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:45.860
before teatime.
 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.610
When he went to Berlin,
and when he went to Prague and

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.199
his name became a sign of
protest,

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.264
when they were chanting,
"Gorby,

00:03:58.264 --> 00:04:01.156
Gorby,"
they're chanting for the

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:04.449
demands of reform in their own
states.

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.870
When the various groups had
been meeting off and on,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.460
particularly in Poland and
Hungary,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.180
where dissidence was most
developed,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.988
and where there was an
alternate kind of civic society

00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:22.141
or civic space developed,
Gorby's name had become

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:25.959
symbolic with the possibility of
change.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:29.648
He made clear that there
weren't going to be tanks sent

00:04:29.648 --> 00:04:29.990
in.
 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.557
At that point,
these huge changes were

00:04:32.557 --> 00:04:33.459
inevitable.
 

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:38.370
But these changes in Eastern
Europe in the former satellite

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.509
states really were facilitated,
were accentuated,

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.961
were made inevitable by the
fact that communism didn't work

00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:48.836
in the Soviet Union,
that the lines were longer and

00:04:48.836 --> 00:04:49.240
longer.
 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.870
There was more attention to
consumer goods.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.889
But also that Gorbachev was a
very different leader.

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.750
Gorbachev was educated.
 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.057
Unlike Brezhnev,
who was his extremely elderly

00:05:03.057 --> 00:05:07.247
predecessor, he could give a
speech without reading it off

00:05:07.247 --> 00:05:08.350
note cards.
 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.000
Well, Ronald Reagan really
couldn't either.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.160
But Gorbachev was compelling.
 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.279
He was smart.
 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.300
He was educated.
 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.060
He understood the system.
 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.370
He had come up through the
system.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.079
And he was committed to change.
 

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.302
But until the very end,
even when they kind of kidnap

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:25.533
him--not kind of,
they kidnapped him,

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:28.569
and he was held under house
arrest in Crimea.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.730
He stuck until the end with the
belief that communism could be

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.363
reformed,
and that you could put a human

00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:38.473
face,
Ã  la Dubcek--he

00:05:38.473 --> 00:05:40.230
didn't look at Dubcek as a
model,

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.850
but on communism.
 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.882
Until the very end,
he believed that you could have

00:05:45.882 --> 00:05:49.511
communism, this good idea gone
terribly wrong,

00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:51.769
that could be reformist.
 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:54.060
He's very, very different than
his predecessors.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.329
Khrushchev has often been
underappreciated.

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:02.391
Khrushchev, after all,
did come out against Stalinism

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.139
in the famous Party Congress,
and all of that.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.867
Khrushchev was a very wily guy
who knew a lot about agriculture

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:14.528
and, in some ways,
was a compelling character.

00:06:14.528 --> 00:06:18.726
But his disappearance in
1964--isn't that when Khrushchev

00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:21.947
leaves power,
in 1964?--he was followed by a

00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:25.019
couple of really orthodox
Stalinians.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:31.180
Gorbachev's rise really must be
seen in that context.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.139
Gorbachev was born in southern
Russia in 1931.

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.983
He worked his way up,
as you had to,

00:06:36.983 --> 00:06:38.459
in the party organization.
 

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:42.050
He studied law at the
University of Moscow.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.079
He knew the West and respected
many things about the West.

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:51.495
He also knew how just
devastating Stalinism had been

00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:53.399
for his own country.
 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:57.351
Both his grandfathers had been
arrested on false charges when

00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.339
he was a boy.
 

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:00.088
He was very talented.
 

00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:03.755
He knew how to manipulate the
system, and he becomes secretary

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:05.980
to the Communist Central
Committee.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.437
Like Khrushchev before,
in his origins,

00:07:10.437 --> 00:07:15.600
he was responsible for Soviet
agriculture.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.016
Unlike his predecessors,
really including Khrushchev,

00:07:19.016 --> 00:07:20.660
he was less xenophobic.
 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.327
He had less of this suspicion
of non-Russians,

00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:29.891
and the Soviet Union was
dominated by Russia,

00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:33.730
let us leave no doubt about
that.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.569
So, he believed that the
communist dream had been

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:42.077
destroyed by Stalinism,
and by the rigidity of the

00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:45.831
structure,
and by the inability to enact

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.190
serious economic reforms.
 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.649
The Soviet Union,
like the other powers,

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:57.329
had simply miserable economies,
miserable economic situations.

00:07:57.329 --> 00:08:01.533
The East European satellite
states were in many ways

00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:06.069
victimized by unfavorable
economic arrangements with the

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.120
Soviet Union,
who exploited them.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.646
But nonetheless,
they were able to be kept

00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:16.850
afloat by the Soviet Union.
 

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:22.846
He embraces the--only two
terms, I didn't send these out,

00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:26.060
to be remembered,
I suppose.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.964
One is the policy of
liberalization which is called

00:08:28.964 --> 00:08:31.694
glasnost,
openness in government combined

00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:34.308
with a greater degree of free
expression.

00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:37.649
He takes people who are
liberals, who are real reformers

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:40.745
not just party hacks,
and he gives them positions of

00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:41.899
responsibility.
 

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:45.336
He realized that if you live in
northern Russia,

00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:47.750
you can see Finnish television.
 

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.634
If you live in Estonia,
where the language is somewhat

00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:54.638
similar to Finnish,
that most difficult of

00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:57.788
languages, you can see what's
going on.

00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:00.720
These images of,
as in East Berlin,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.600
West Berlin and of a different
way of life.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.884
You can't simply pretend that
there wasn't a better way of

00:09:07.884 --> 00:09:09.210
life for many people.
 

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.235
There were lots of people in
the former Soviet Union who may

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:15.363
have had their doubts within the
following ten years about the

00:09:15.363 --> 00:09:17.460
kind of runaway,
bandit capitalism,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.807
the high-crime capitalism that
developed in the victimized

00:09:21.807 --> 00:09:24.899
Russia,
and Bulgaria, in particular,

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:26.519
and in other places as well.
 

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:30.183
He spoke openly,
publicly about the failings of

00:09:30.183 --> 00:09:31.220
the system.
 

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.537
That was the hush-hush where
you didn't talk about the

00:09:33.537 --> 00:09:34.629
failings of the system.
 

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:37.320
You were always talking about
the "radiant future."

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.250
Remember the radiant future.
 

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.799
But the future wasn't radiant.
 

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:42.039
There were long lines.
 

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:45.360
It just simply didn't work.
 

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.759
He realized that if you're
going to supply the cities with

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:51.442
consumer goods,
you have to return to the free

00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:52.100
market.
 

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.366
You really have to return to
the old New Economic Policy that

00:09:57.366 --> 00:10:01.230
you already know about in the
early 1920s.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.590
Also, the second is
perestroika,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.500
the restructuring of the whole
system with the belief,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.317
that he had,
that communism could be made

00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:18.052
responsible to the desires of
ordinary people in the Soviet

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.240
Republic.
 

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.309
He said--and he could toss off
memorable phrases very easily,

00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:27.100
he was an extremely bright guy.
 

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.379
He's still very much alive.
 

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:31.009
"We need a revolution of
the mind."

00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:35.058
You had to recommence with zero.
 

00:10:35.058 --> 00:10:40.065
You had to begin from the
beginning and reconstruct this

00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:45.980
reformed communism that would be
responsive to ordinary people.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.471
It didn't work out the way he
thought it was going to work

00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:49.840
out.
 

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.950
The entire system collapsed.
 

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:58.496
Three things made this
possible, the fall of communism

00:10:58.496 --> 00:11:04.360
in the Soviet Union and in
Eastern and Central Europe.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.446
First, within all of these
states--but most notably the

00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:11.548
Baltic states where people held
hands,

00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:14.759
they formed a human chain all
the way across Lithuania,

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:17.840
Latvia, and Estonia holding
hands,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.008
a human chain across the entire
Baltic region--these places had

00:11:22.008 --> 00:11:25.720
strong nationalist movements,
such as the Lithuanian movement

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.080
that we discussed earlier.
 

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.288
These continued.
 

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:35.509
But also in Eastern Europe,
particularly in Hungary and in

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:39.308
Poland, but also in Ukraine.
 

00:11:39.308 --> 00:11:41.460
Remember, Ukrainian is a
different language.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.038
It's a related but different
language.

00:11:43.038 --> 00:11:46.261
There's still huge problems
because so many Russians still

00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:47.279
live in Ukraine.
 

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:50.092
We don't have time to talk
about the ethnic complexities of

00:11:50.092 --> 00:11:50.870
these regions.
 

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.366
The Russians who were left in
Latvia, there were more Russians

00:11:55.366 --> 00:11:59.568
in Latvia than in Estonia or
Lithuania, faced all sorts of

00:11:59.568 --> 00:12:00.970
discrimination.
 

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.440
This is a problem.
 

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.936
Anyway, these cultural demands,
these nationalistic demands

00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:11.509
could not be placated by talk
about a reformed communism.

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:15.123
In the Soviet Union,
the idea that the republics

00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:17.428
were equal was a sheer myth.
 

00:12:17.428 --> 00:12:20.899
The idea that there would be
tolerance,

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:25.889
toleration of different ways of
looking at the world--basically,

00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:29.822
there was some showcase stuff
about the flowering of the

00:12:29.822 --> 00:12:31.928
cultures,
but it was basically myth.

00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:35.740
Secondly, in 1989 in these
countries,

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.448
amid economic crisis,
the great horrors of

00:12:39.448 --> 00:12:42.284
deprivation,
the long lines of people

00:12:42.284 --> 00:12:47.049
wearing threadbare coats waiting
for trams that were late,

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:50.972
a reform movement,
a politically democratic

00:12:50.972 --> 00:12:53.370
movement emerges in all of these
states.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.345
In Russia it was led by the
Nobel-Prize-winning physicist

00:12:57.345 --> 00:13:00.113
Andrei Sakharov,
who had helped develop,

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:02.740
of all things,
the hydrogen bomb.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.759
Then, whereas the works of
Solzhenitsyn--Solzhenitsyn,

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:12.019
whose vision--you have to
separate Solzhenitsyn's critique

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:16.053
of the gulag from his vision of
the return of the czar,

00:13:16.053 --> 00:13:17.250
or whatever.
 

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.043
Solzhenitsyn,
I used to run into him here in

00:13:19.043 --> 00:13:20.379
the Sterling Memorial Library.
 

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:23.107
He was here for a year or two
working in the stacks,

00:13:23.107 --> 00:13:24.500
in the collection there.
 

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.150
Solzhenitsyn,
whereas before his stuff on the

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:34.964
gulag was passed from hand to
hand, typed scripts passed

00:13:34.964 --> 00:13:40.250
secretly from hand to hand,
you could read it.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:45.075
You could read Solzhenitsyn on
what was the increasingly no

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:49.567
longer hidden secret of the
gulag, and what happened to

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:51.980
people sent to the gulag.
 

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.543
These dissidents begin to reach
an increasing audience within

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.333
all of these countries,
within all of the Soviet

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:00.649
Republics and in the United
States.

00:14:00.649 --> 00:14:04.292
Gorbachev comes to Washington,
D.C.

00:14:04.292 --> 00:14:07.538
in the Mall,
and he scares the hell--in a

00:14:07.538 --> 00:14:10.350
country that had had political
assassinations,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.092
you will remember this one--out
of those people who were

00:14:13.092 --> 00:14:14.389
supposed to protect him.
 

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:18.136
He leaves the limousine,
and he plunges into the crowd,

00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:21.537
and gives the Russian
equivalent of high fives and

00:14:21.537 --> 00:14:23.548
shakes hands with people.
 

00:14:23.548 --> 00:14:26.388
They were just scared to death
someone was going to blow them

00:14:26.388 --> 00:14:26.720
away.
 

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.173
He charms the Reagans,
and of course his intellectual

00:14:31.173 --> 00:14:34.428
capacity was many times those
folks.

00:14:34.428 --> 00:14:36.986
His interest,
I shouldn't have said capacity,

00:14:36.986 --> 00:14:37.860
his interest.
 

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.288
He charms people.
 

00:14:39.288 --> 00:14:42.880
He was a real live,
functioning intellectual in

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.408
politics, obviously committed in
putting his reputation and

00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:50.610
putting the whole estate on the
line.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.570
This was the second thing.
 

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:57.462
Third, it was the extenuation,
acceleration of this economic

00:14:57.462 --> 00:14:58.210
crisis.
 

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.000
Things weren't getting better.
 

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.730
Poland is the great example of
that, the reason that Solidarity

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.379
starts in 1980 in the shipyards
of Gdansk.

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:08.389
It's bizarre to go back there.
 

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:09.580
They're probably going to close.
 

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.250
There's huge pictures of the
pope all over the place.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.960
But it still is a sight of
memory when you go to Gdansk.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.191
The reason that solidarity
starts with Lech Walesa--and not

00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:23.110
just alone--and my friends in
Poland,

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.759
who are a little bit younger
than Lech Walesa,

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.640
and lots of other people--is
because there wasn't enough to

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:28.940
eat.
 

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.379
You had a terrible situation.
 

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:31.558
So they unionized.
 

00:15:31.558 --> 00:15:33.736
They said, "We're going to
put forth our claims,"

00:15:33.736 --> 00:15:35.538
like unions had done in France,
and in Italy,

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:37.019
and in Spain,
and in other places,

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:40.932
as people had wanted to do in
the early days of the Soviet

00:15:40.932 --> 00:15:42.986
regime,
and they had been squished like

00:15:42.986 --> 00:15:43.340
grapes.
 

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.788
Everybody's been squished like
grapes.

00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:49.625
The economic crisis makes these
three things merge:

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:52.527
nationalism,
democratic reform,

00:15:52.527 --> 00:15:56.298
and the desire for economic
change.

00:15:56.298 --> 00:16:02.639
You've got this charming man
who takes big-time decisions.

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:03.990
Lots of Jews,
for example,

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.879
wanted to leave the Soviet
Union.

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:09.000
They were victimized by
anti-Semitism there.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.158
They were often treated as
second-class citizens.

00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:14.120
Gorbachev says,
"Fine."

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.370
He says, "Yes,
you can emigrate.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.779
You can go to Israel or the
United States."

00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:18.830
So, things change.
 

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:23.118
There's palpable change,
and people have a sense of

00:16:23.118 --> 00:16:27.491
what's going to happen,
that new things are going to

00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:28.350
occur.
 

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.432
The speed with which this
happened took Western leaders by

00:16:32.432 --> 00:16:33.220
surprise.
 

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.320
They were not Thatcher.
 

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.240
That's a good example.
 

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:44.633
They were not ready for the
speed at which these changes

00:16:44.633 --> 00:16:46.769
were coming.
 

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:50.210
When people are shouting,
"Gorby, Gorby,

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.825
Gorby,"
the subtext is that we want the

00:16:53.825 --> 00:16:56.600
reforms in Hungary,
in Poland,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.490
in Czechoslovakia,
and in other countries as well,

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.420
but the movements were much
smaller in Bulgaria or in

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.531
Romania,
which was under the police

00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:07.680
state of Ceausescu.
 

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.940
You had the same situation in
Albania, kind of the cult of

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.907
Hoxha, who was very tied to
communist China,

00:17:16.907 --> 00:17:18.200
etc., etc.
 

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:24.488
He makes clear in Strasbourg,
in a speech to the Council of

00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:28.613
Europe in July 1989,
that he rejects the Brezhnev

00:17:28.613 --> 00:17:31.608
doctrine,
his predecessor Leonid

00:17:31.608 --> 00:17:34.205
Brezhnev,
that the Soviet Union,

00:17:34.205 --> 00:17:37.298
as in 1953,
and as in 1968,

00:17:37.298 --> 00:17:40.080
or in 1956 in Hungary--I
remember when I was a really

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.680
little kid,
I remember Hungarian children

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:49.478
who had been lucky enough to
escape the revolution coming to

00:17:49.478 --> 00:17:53.410
Ainsworth School in Portland,
Oregon.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.115
He said, "Any interference
in domestic affairs and any

00:17:56.115 --> 00:17:58.450
attempts to restrict the
sovereignty of states,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.039
both friends and allies or any
others,

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.420
are inadmissible."
 

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:08.788
Gorbachev says that these
movements in Hungary and Poland

00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:10.608
are inspiring.
 

00:18:10.608 --> 00:18:15.078
He found them personally
inspiring.

00:18:15.078 --> 00:18:18.007
So, the rest,
as they say,

00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:19.528
is history.
 

00:18:19.528 --> 00:18:22.528
You've all seen images of the
Wall,

00:18:22.528 --> 00:18:27.170
first of young students your
age, your age,

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.500
putting flowers in the guns of
the Vopos,

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.210
who were the East German
guards,

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.500
flowers in the guns.
 

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.700
Then the whole goddamned thing
just collapses.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.368
Suddenly people are pouring
over the Wall.

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:43.151
People on trains are--and the
East German government,

00:18:43.151 --> 00:18:47.369
Honecker was one of the very,
very worst of all of them.

00:18:47.369 --> 00:18:49.009
He really was just awful.
 

00:18:49.009 --> 00:18:52.930
The Stasi infiltrated almost
every organization.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.863
There's a great movie called
The Lives of Others,

00:18:55.863 --> 00:18:57.088
a great, great movie.
 

00:18:57.088 --> 00:18:59.933
If this course went this far,
I would recommend you see

00:18:59.933 --> 00:19:02.040
The Lives of Others,
about spying,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.568
and integrity,
and just all sorts of things.

00:19:04.568 --> 00:19:07.067
Honecker was saying,
"Give these people,

00:19:07.067 --> 00:19:09.108
return them to East
Germany."

00:19:09.108 --> 00:19:11.183
The Hungarians say,
"No, we won't return them

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:12.200
to East Germany."
 

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.575
They start taking down the
barbed wire borders around their

00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:16.390
own country.
 

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.089
The whole thing just happens
like that.

00:19:19.089 --> 00:19:26.000
The Berlin Wall collapses,
and within a month Ceaucescus,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.477
for better or for worse,
have been gunned down in a

00:19:29.477 --> 00:19:33.509
garden after a very hasty
televised trial.

00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:34.799
They were very bad people.
 

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:35.769
There's no doubt it.
 

00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:36.880
But there was no due process.
 

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.599
But that was the end of that.
 

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:42.077
And Honecker,
whose slogan was "Always

00:19:42.077 --> 00:19:43.739
forward,
never backward"

00:19:43.739 --> 00:19:47.098
until the very end--and the
Czech leader was very much the

00:19:47.098 --> 00:19:49.743
same,
and the Bulgarian and Romanian

00:19:49.743 --> 00:19:53.096
leaders,
and Albanian leaders--Albania

00:19:53.096 --> 00:19:58.480
is a case apart--were going to
keep the whole thing alive.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:04.083
The whole communist system was
going to survive,

00:20:04.083 --> 00:20:06.108
no matter what.
 

00:20:06.108 --> 00:20:07.490
Of course, it didn't work out
that way.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.240
In Czechoslovakia the group of
writers and intellectuals,

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:17.592
including VÃ¡clav Havel,
who had signed Charter 77 and

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:20.380
were put in jail as a result of
that,

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.588
who demanded reform.
 

00:20:21.588 --> 00:20:23.900
You already had in
Czechoslovakia,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.058
and in Poland,
and in Hungary,

00:20:28.058 --> 00:20:31.220
you already had intellectuals
who were anti-communist,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.130
or who were reforming
communists,

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.548
meeting sometimes very openly.
 

00:20:34.548 --> 00:20:37.976
In these countries that
transition to democracy or to

00:20:37.976 --> 00:20:41.731
parliamentary rule would be
easier, because the passing of

00:20:41.731 --> 00:20:43.380
the torch was easier.
 

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.345
In Czechoslovakia you know
there were some parliamentary

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:47.099
antecedents.
 

00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:49.150
Poland also did.
 

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.402
Hungary less so,
but you had this sort of

00:20:52.402 --> 00:20:56.549
flourishing, alternative civil
society that had been

00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:57.769
developing.
 

00:20:57.769 --> 00:21:01.348
So, the passing to the new
generation,

00:21:01.348 --> 00:21:03.400
despite all the economic
problems,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.460
and despite the ethnic tensions
that would remain,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.573
was much easier than it would
be in Bulgaria,

00:21:11.573 --> 00:21:13.200
for example.
 

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.089
In Bulgaria,
what the leadership does,

00:21:15.089 --> 00:21:17.588
they feel cornered,
so they try to accentuate

00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:19.798
anti-Turkish feelings,
because there were many Turks

00:21:19.798 --> 00:21:20.598
who lived in Bulgaria.
 

00:21:20.598 --> 00:21:23.890
Lots of Turks flee and then
they go to Turkey.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.198
In fact, they find that things
are worse in Turkey and many of

00:21:26.198 --> 00:21:27.220
them go back to Bulgaria.
 

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.625
The tensions between the
Romanians and the Hungarians in

00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:35.150
Romania helps generate change
for reform,

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:40.806
because outside of Bucharest
the big calls for reform and the

00:21:40.806 --> 00:21:46.366
organization is the work of
Hungarians who are living in the

00:21:46.366 --> 00:21:49.288
Hungarian parts of Romania.
 

00:21:49.288 --> 00:21:52.077
But the transition to
parliamentary regime would be

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:53.750
much harder in those places.
 

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.740
The case of Bulgaria is
particularly interesting.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.430
It's also the one I know the
least about.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:04.828
They have just had the change
is so slow in many ways they're

00:22:04.828 --> 00:22:06.108
happening.
 

00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:11.262
The kind of banditization,
or the kind of infiltration of

00:22:11.262 --> 00:22:17.430
major crime networks in Bulgaria
really continue to run the show.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.237
You find that to an extent,
as everybody knows,

00:22:20.237 --> 00:22:20.970
in Russia.
 

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.568
But that's another case.
 

00:22:23.568 --> 00:22:29.325
So, the Velvet Revolution
occurs in Czechoslovakia,

00:22:29.325 --> 00:22:35.310
where the entire Politburo,
that is the ruling group,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.108
resigned on November 19,1989.
 

00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:43.942
This is just a matter of a
short period of time after the

00:22:43.942 --> 00:22:47.048
Berlin Wall essentially goes
down.

00:22:47.048 --> 00:22:53.321
One of the interesting things
about all this is that despite

00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:58.848
the huge ethnic tensions in many
of these places,

00:22:58.848 --> 00:23:02.042
you didn't have the kind of
awful blood bath that you would

00:23:02.042 --> 00:23:06.428
have in ex-Yugoslavia,
which was primarily the work of

00:23:06.428 --> 00:23:11.080
the Serbs in those horrible,
horrible wars that began

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.240
bloodletting,
ethnic cleansing.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.290
Mass murder is a less fancy way
of putting it than ethnic

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.160
cleansing.
 

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.065
For example,
you had all these tensions

00:23:22.065 --> 00:23:25.303
between Poles and Ukrainians,
because of the parts of Eastern

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:27.430
Poland had passed back and
forth,

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:31.358
and lots of Ukrainians live in
that part of Poland,

00:23:31.358 --> 00:23:35.009
and lots of Poles live near
Lviv in Ukraine.

00:23:35.009 --> 00:23:40.467
Actually, for all of the
persecution of ethnic Russians

00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:43.598
living in Latvia,
above all,

00:23:43.598 --> 00:23:45.308
but also in Estonia and
Lithuania,

00:23:45.308 --> 00:23:51.817
you really didn't have the
kinds of massacres that happened

00:23:51.817 --> 00:23:53.950
in ex-Yugoslavia.
 

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.019
Two reasons for that.
 

00:23:57.019 --> 00:24:00.048
One is because of the ethnic
religious complexity,

00:24:00.048 --> 00:24:04.717
in that the massacres were
primarily perpetuated against

00:24:04.717 --> 00:24:09.894
Muslims by Orthodox Serbs who
were inspired by one of the real

00:24:09.894 --> 00:24:13.700
villains of the last century,
or any century,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.673
Slobodan Milosevic,
who died during his trial in

00:24:16.673 --> 00:24:18.724
the Hague,
who kept talking about a

00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:21.359
"Greater Serbia"
to include Kosovo,

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:22.578
to include everywhere else.
 

00:24:22.578 --> 00:24:26.509
Also on a more minor scale,
those carried out by some

00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:29.608
Croatians against Muslims and
all that.

00:24:29.608 --> 00:24:34.992
That was one major reason why
you didn't have that same thing,

00:24:34.992 --> 00:24:38.170
that is, the religious
difference.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.589
Secondly is that in Ukraine
nobody was really talking about

00:24:41.589 --> 00:24:43.358
"Greater Ukraine."
 

00:24:43.358 --> 00:24:46.423
People in Poland weren't
talking about "Greater

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:49.067
Poland,"
imagining annexing anybody they

00:24:49.067 --> 00:24:51.940
could possibly do,
the way Hitler had done,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:57.304
or the way that Milosevic
perpetuated his sleazy career as

00:24:57.304 --> 00:25:03.046
leader of the Yugoslav and then
Serb Communist Party by giving

00:25:03.046 --> 00:25:07.470
inflammatory speeches in Kosovo,
etc., etc.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.269
So, the whole thing collapses.
 

00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:14.980
Of course, this doesn't
eliminate problems.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.201
If you don't have a real
tradition of parliamentary rule,

00:25:18.201 --> 00:25:21.250
how do you suddenly create
parties that are viable?

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.390
How do you create this sort of
civic culture?

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.940
That's not very easy.
 

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.919
Also, the Americans,
particularly from the

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:30.288
University of Chicago economic
school,

00:25:30.288 --> 00:25:32.740
were giving advice in Poland
saying,

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.229
"You just need an
automatic infusion of

00:25:34.229 --> 00:25:34.680
capitalism.
 

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.710
That will solve
everything."

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.183
That's not what happens at all.
 

00:25:37.183 --> 00:25:40.096
If anything,
it increases the gap between

00:25:40.096 --> 00:25:42.019
the very,
very wealthy people,

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:45.028
who formerly would have been
party cadres in the Communist

00:25:45.028 --> 00:25:46.769
Party and very ordinary people.
 

00:25:46.769 --> 00:25:50.592
Anyone who follows contemporary
Russia now knows all that,

00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:54.615
or in the CÃ´te d'Azur in
Nice, in the Negresco Hotel in

00:25:54.615 --> 00:25:55.220
Nice.
 

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.729
I shouldn't knock the Negresco,
I've stayed there while guiding

00:25:57.729 --> 00:25:58.579
a Yale alumni tour.
 

00:25:58.579 --> 00:26:01.028
But anyway,
you find these extraordinarily

00:26:01.028 --> 00:26:04.108
wealthy Russian billionaires
buying up everything,

00:26:04.108 --> 00:26:09.650
including soccer teams in
England,

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:15.599
while there's still people with
not enough to eat.

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:16.630
There are other problems.
 

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.508
These ethnic challenges,
of course, are nowhere more

00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:22.670
graphically and horribly
revealed than in the Balkans.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.670
The problem of all of these
communist systems--;they said

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:30.098
above all, you must have
large-scale industry.

00:26:30.098 --> 00:26:33.279
So, they start building these
awfully soon out-of-date

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:36.220
factories that crank out
pollution at unimaginable

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.880
levels.
 

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.288
One of the effects is,
for example,

00:26:40.288 --> 00:26:43.078
the obstruction of the Black
Forest in Germany by these

00:26:43.078 --> 00:26:45.868
clouds of pollution coming from
the Czech Republic,

00:26:45.868 --> 00:26:50.102
to say nothing of the fact that
a lot of the Soviet nuclear

00:26:50.102 --> 00:26:52.730
installations were in
Kazakhstan,

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.065
and other places,
and trying to get these

00:26:55.065 --> 00:26:59.413
diffused and immobilized,
particularly when the United

00:26:59.413 --> 00:27:02.670
States has been,
under this last regime,

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.598
has been trying to restart the
arms race.

00:27:05.598 --> 00:27:09.230
This is a personal comment,
but too bad.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.150
I'm talking about how Europeans
view America.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.640
The Americans now have this
idea to put bases in Poland.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.919
This is a terrible idea,
because these bases could be

00:27:18.919 --> 00:27:21.819
transformed into offensive
weapons, as well.

00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:27.890
This can very well, as Putin,
who sometimes can't be trusted,

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.069
and who was a vigorous,
aggressive Russian nationalist,

00:27:31.069 --> 00:27:37.011
for better or for worse,
that this could start again,

00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:39.619
unleash,
whatever you call it,

00:27:39.619 --> 00:27:43.548
this arms race,
and that would be awful.

00:27:43.548 --> 00:27:44.720
So, there's still lots of
problems.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.650
What can I say?
 

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.914
Yet every time I go to Poland,
which, as I said,

00:27:47.914 --> 00:27:50.132
is very frequently now,
and to other countries,

00:27:50.132 --> 00:27:51.529
there is just great hope.
 

00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:54.950
There wasn't a lot of hope in
1987 or in 1986.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:59.670
Suddenly, there was this new,
incredibly transformed world.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.609
In many places it was easier to
tear down,

00:28:03.609 --> 00:28:06.190
to say what you are against,
that you didn't want this

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.939
unreformed communist state,
or you didn't want communism at

00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:11.338
all,
than it was to sort of

00:28:11.338 --> 00:28:15.769
miraculously create this new
affair or world.

00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:17.259
In Warsaw I'm constantly amazed.
 

00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:19.680
Warsaw was completely rebuilt.
 

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.450
When I was a kid I was there.
 

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:24.210
All you saw was rubble,
basically.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.798
Now when I walk on the Hotel
Bristol,

00:28:26.798 --> 00:28:28.000
a very fancy,
famous hotel,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.352
and I turn left,
it looks like the

00:28:29.352 --> 00:28:32.727
Champs-ElysÃ©es,
or the Rue Saint-HonorÃ©

00:28:32.727 --> 00:28:34.750
in Paris,
all these fancy shops.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.635
As we go out to the university,
then you see all these people

00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:39.660
still wearing the same
threadbare coats,

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.756
waiting in line for the trams
as before the communist

00:28:42.756 --> 00:28:43.529
revolution.
 

00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:45.598
Yet, things are better.
 

00:28:45.598 --> 00:28:47.508
One of the reasons,
by the way, things are better

00:28:47.508 --> 00:28:49.694
in Poland is that they never did
completely collectivize

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:50.608
agriculture at all.
 

00:28:50.608 --> 00:28:53.452
Petites
propriÃ©taires,

00:28:53.452 --> 00:28:58.084
small units still existed,
and so the transition there was

00:28:58.084 --> 00:29:00.440
easier than other places.
 

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.150
Well, what can I say?
 

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.868
This is what I'm going to say
now is how Europeans view

00:29:05.868 --> 00:29:06.490
Europe.
 

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.327
Also, as kind of a European,
how they view the United

00:29:09.327 --> 00:29:09.818
States.
 

00:29:09.818 --> 00:29:13.335
I might certainly be tempted at
the end to talk a little bit

00:29:13.335 --> 00:29:15.538
about that, and about human
rights.

00:29:15.538 --> 00:29:20.220
We talk about globalization and
all of that.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.345
JosÃ© BovÃ©
lived in Los Angeles for two

00:29:25.345 --> 00:29:26.150
years.
 

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:30.628
He's actually a city guy,
but he made his reputation in

00:29:30.628 --> 00:29:36.378
the south of France marching,
and with tractors blocking

00:29:36.378 --> 00:29:41.955
French Air Force installations,
trying to keep part of lower

00:29:41.955 --> 00:29:46.568
Massif Central called Larzac
from being turned into a place

00:29:46.568 --> 00:29:49.500
for bomb testing,
and all that business.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.990
Then he took his campaign
against McDonalds.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:56.060
McDonalds, MacDo,
became identified with

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.690
globalization and with
Americanization.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.191
So, the old anti-American
sentiment among intellectuals,

00:30:02.191 --> 00:30:03.920
and JosÃ©
BovÃ© is that.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.270
When he came to Yale a couple
years ago, Jim Scott brought him

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.849
here to Yale.
 

00:30:06.849 --> 00:30:09.710
My daughter took him to Rudy's.
 

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:10.730
That's what she did.
 

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:15.185
When he came here,
he came here as sort of a

00:30:15.185 --> 00:30:18.400
symbol of anti-globalization.
 

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.299
All of you have seen images of
people in Seattle throwing

00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:26.132
themselves against the police,
or in Nice against police

00:30:26.132 --> 00:30:28.640
barricades, or in Italy as well.
 

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.038
Globalization is sort of a
catchall.

00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:32.853
But if you don't believe that
we live in a more global

00:30:32.853 --> 00:30:34.721
society,
look at the impact of the

00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:38.423
economic crisis and how quickly
that spread within the last two

00:30:38.423 --> 00:30:39.019
months.
 

00:30:39.019 --> 00:30:42.750
It's an obvious thing that we
live in a world where Adidas,

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.519
and all these shoes,
and shirts, and T-shirts,

00:30:46.519 --> 00:30:50.665
are often outsourced to the
poorest people they can find in

00:30:50.665 --> 00:30:52.740
Indonesia and other places.
 

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.544
When you have some problem with
your cell phone--I still don't

00:30:55.544 --> 00:30:58.621
have a cell phone,
or whatever--but you'll end up

00:30:58.621 --> 00:31:02.845
talking to somebody in India or
Pakistan as easily as you are

00:31:02.845 --> 00:31:05.450
talking to somebody in New
Jersey.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:10.791
One aspect of globalization
that is so much more visible now

00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:15.400
than even fifteen years ago,
and which fits exactly into one

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.630
of the themes of this course,
is obviously immigration.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.910
There are no borders anymore.
 

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.029
The creation of the European
Union,

00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:25.748
for better or for worse,
means that you can go

00:31:25.748 --> 00:31:30.468
essentially from Calais all the
way to Lithuania and never have

00:31:30.468 --> 00:31:32.599
your ID checked not once.
 

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:34.348
I travel on my French ID there.
 

00:31:34.348 --> 00:31:37.666
It's only in England and in
coming back to the United States

00:31:37.666 --> 00:31:39.578
that you need a passport at all.
 

00:31:39.578 --> 00:31:42.740
But the result is you've got
all of these immigrants.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:47.373
You've all seen pictures of
bodies bobbing in the sea of

00:31:47.373 --> 00:31:52.006
Moroccans, and people from Mali,
or Tunisia, or Senegal,

00:31:52.006 --> 00:31:54.450
trying to get into Spain.
 

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.338
Once you got into Spain you've
essentially got it made.

00:31:57.338 --> 00:32:02.356
The same passages that Spanish
refugees fled Franco's terror

00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:07.459
during and after the Spanish
Civil War bring people from Mali

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:08.818
into France.
 

00:32:08.818 --> 00:32:14.217
Of course, female and male sex
trafficking from Moldavia in

00:32:14.217 --> 00:32:17.990
particular,
from Bulgaria and from Albania,

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.838
those are the three major
points,

00:32:19.838 --> 00:32:21.670
is something that is just
everywhere.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.970
Immigrants are not new.
 

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:28.720
In the 1960s these governments
said, "Please."

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.970
They put up signs.
 

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.750
"Please come to work in
France."

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.460
"Come to work in Germany,
in Istanbul."

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.710
So many Turks went to Germany.
 

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.642
Then, all of a sudden,
when the bottom of the economy

00:32:40.642 --> 00:32:45.450
falls out with the Arab oil
embargo in 1973 and 1974,

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.009
then some of these people who
helped make the economy run,

00:32:48.009 --> 00:32:51.612
and who still help make the
economy run--there's a whole

00:32:51.612 --> 00:32:55.542
underground economy and do jobs
of lots of other people--they

00:32:55.542 --> 00:32:57.808
suddenly they say,
"We don't want them."

00:32:57.808 --> 00:33:00.890
One of the risks that's an
obvious risk to anyone who has

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.200
studied Germany in the 1920s and
1930s,

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.711
which you have,
is that economic crisis causes

00:33:05.711 --> 00:33:09.009
people to scapegoat and to
stereotype into scapegoat.

00:33:09.009 --> 00:33:12.113
In countries like France where
the Gaullists made their pact

00:33:12.113 --> 00:33:14.952
with the devil and joined with
the National Front in an

00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:17.973
over-the-top,
aggressively racist political

00:33:17.973 --> 00:33:20.549
party whose leader was a
torturer,

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:26.857
Jean-Marie Le Pen in Algeria,
and who described the Holocaust

00:33:26.857 --> 00:33:29.834
as "a minor detail"
of World War II and whose

00:33:29.834 --> 00:33:32.480
supporters are
nÃ©gationnistes,

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.440
negationists who believe that
there wasn't a Holocaust.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.969
When they start,
when their discourse becomes

00:33:37.969 --> 00:33:41.130
extremely, extremely--not only
prevalent but acceptable,

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.740
then you have a problem.
 

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.836
Even in Switzerland,
where it is very hard to become

00:33:45.836 --> 00:33:48.519
a resident of Switzerland,
which does have a large

00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:50.938
immigrant population,
you had a party of the extreme

00:33:50.938 --> 00:33:51.298
right.
 

00:33:51.298 --> 00:33:53.923
In Denmark, one of the most
tolerant places one could ever

00:33:53.923 --> 00:33:56.684
imagine, you had one of the most
over-the-top--and still have

00:33:56.684 --> 00:33:58.019
right wing organizations.
 

00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:02.258
JÃ¶rg Haider,
who just got himself killed

00:34:02.258 --> 00:34:05.949
running his car off the road a
couple weeks ago in Austria,

00:34:05.949 --> 00:34:08.666
he was,
unapologetic is probably a bit

00:34:08.666 --> 00:34:11.266
too strong,
but he said things were much

00:34:11.266 --> 00:34:14.599
better when the Nazis were in
control of the economy.

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:16.219
We didn't have all these other
people around.

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.269
Economic crisis,
and national stereotyping,

00:34:19.269 --> 00:34:22.030
and racism is a recipe for
disaster.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.719
Even in countries where
democracy really,

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.072
really works,
again returning to the case of

00:34:27.072 --> 00:34:30.396
Poland,
when you have black players

00:34:30.396 --> 00:34:33.780
being taunted in soccer games.
 

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.648
Poland, as in other countries,
as in Spain,

00:34:36.648 --> 00:34:40.815
one of the worst of a kind of
racist baiting that goes on when

00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:42.250
these clubs play.
 

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.260
In France, with Paris
Saint-Germain,

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.610
that's another classic example,
or Lazio,

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:52.255
which is the Mussolini
granddaughter's favorite team in

00:34:52.255 --> 00:34:54.039
Italy,
then you've got a real problem.

00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:56.851
When it becomes acceptable,
and maybe some of you may

00:34:56.851 --> 00:34:59.699
consider unfair,
but when Sarkozy,

00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:02.699
president of France,
he's the son of Hungarian

00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:05.268
immigrants,
and when he borrows the

00:35:05.268 --> 00:35:08.460
language,
the language of racism,

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.224
the language of Le Pen,
to help put him over the

00:35:11.224 --> 00:35:13.920
top--and when someone
interviewed Le Pen and said,

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.300
"Why do you do so badly in
the elections?"

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.998
he said, and he was right for
once, he said,

00:35:16.998 --> 00:35:19.409
"Because they said the
same things we're saying."

00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:20.750
Then you've got a problem.
 

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:25.032
"Fortress Europe"
may be trying--all these human

00:35:25.032 --> 00:35:29.090
rights documents give people the
right to emigrate,

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.539
but not to immigrate.
 

00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:33.679
How these countries,
including ours,

00:35:33.679 --> 00:35:39.083
treat people who are legal
immigrants and those who are

00:35:39.083 --> 00:35:45.088
illegal immigrants is a true
test of the kinds of values that

00:35:45.088 --> 00:35:46.489
they have.
 

00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:50.250
This is an obvious thing to
say, but this is the future.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.586
This is an ongoing problem,
an ongoing challenge,

00:35:54.586 --> 00:35:57.750
in every single European
country.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:06.210
Toleration, civic harmony,
generosity, caring in hard

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.280
times is under assault.
 

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.639
Our country has never been
immune from that as well.

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:19.097
This is an obvious case,
but it's something that's going

00:36:19.097 --> 00:36:22.340
to concern people that work on
Europe.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.552
Look at the role of xenophobia
in the rise of the right in the

00:36:26.552 --> 00:36:29.110
1920s and, above all,
in the 1930s.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.059
It's the same thing over and
over again.

00:36:31.059 --> 00:36:34.750
Just to end with this.
 

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.829
There's the question of human
rights.

00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:41.539
Europeans have a hard time
understanding the United States.

00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:43.230
They don't understand capital
punishment.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.670
They don't understand why you
can just pick up a gun.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.873
You can't vote,
but you can buy a machine gun

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:53.170
at some gun show almost anywhere
you are, north or south.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:54.690
They can't understand that.
 

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:58.166
One of the other things they
can't understand is why in this

00:36:58.166 --> 00:37:00.230
country we have a deep,
abiding,

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:03.391
institutionalized believe in
the right to bear arms,

00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:05.681
etc., etc.,
but in civic rights or civil

00:37:05.681 --> 00:37:09.389
rights,
your rights as defined by being

00:37:09.389 --> 00:37:15.472
a member of the state--but we
have often not accepted human

00:37:15.472 --> 00:37:17.989
rights as a category.
 

00:37:17.989 --> 00:37:20.380
Europeans are often just
mystified by this.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.619
Let me give you an example
there.

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:26.380
Again, this is not politics,
but I can't help saying this.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:31.228
It's very difficult to explain
to people how it is that the

00:37:31.228 --> 00:37:36.242
United States in the last few
years finds itself on a list of

00:37:36.242 --> 00:37:38.500
countries that torture.
 

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.570
Not big-time,
not Nazi Germany,

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:47.710
not Stalin, not even the level
of Pinochet, who they tried to

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:52.420
extradite and they tried to do
everything.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:57.746
Not on the level of Milosevic,
who finally was carted off to

00:37:57.746 --> 00:37:58.739
tribunal.
 

00:37:58.739 --> 00:38:02.117
But the United States,
in the smirks of President

00:38:02.117 --> 00:38:05.001
George Bush, and Cheney,
and these people,

00:38:05.001 --> 00:38:08.449
these people put us on the list
of torturers.

00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:13.143
Guantanamo hurt the United
States, the view that people

00:38:13.143 --> 00:38:17.402
have of the United States,
in ways that are simply

00:38:17.402 --> 00:38:18.880
unimaginable.
 

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.737
The idea that these
people--some of them are some

00:38:20.737 --> 00:38:22.510
really bad people,
other people just got sort of

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.235
caught up in the wrong
thing--but even if they're bad

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:25.628
people,
they never had charges pressed

00:38:25.628 --> 00:38:26.110
against them.
 

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:30.304
You see them chained to the
ground with their little orange

00:38:30.304 --> 00:38:31.099
uniforms.
 

00:38:31.099 --> 00:38:33.664
You see the images that came
out of the prisons,

00:38:33.664 --> 00:38:37.101
or you have Blackwater or these
private contractors gunning down

00:38:37.101 --> 00:38:38.630
civilians with impunity.
 

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.659
This stuff didn't used to
happen in this country.

00:38:40.659 --> 00:38:43.039
Even during Vietnam,
when Lieutenant Calley,

00:38:43.039 --> 00:38:46.304
who murdered all those people
in Vietnam--you don't remember

00:38:46.304 --> 00:38:46.969
Vietnam.
 

00:38:46.969 --> 00:38:49.838
Bob sitting amng you and a few
others remember Vietnam--;Calley

00:38:49.838 --> 00:38:50.579
went on trial.
 

00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:54.108
But when states become involved
with this, with kidnapping

00:38:54.108 --> 00:38:57.018
people off the streets,
what do they call it?

00:38:57.018 --> 00:39:02.244
And secret plane flights to
England, or to wherever,

00:39:02.244 --> 00:39:07.775
this is what made the United
States lose so much of its

00:39:07.775 --> 00:39:10.440
image, of its respect.
 

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.070
It's incredible.
 

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:15.570
Even in a place that I live
with 330 people--and people are

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:19.264
not terribly politicized,
politics is still families that

00:39:19.264 --> 00:39:22.818
have hated each other for
generations--but there is this

00:39:22.818 --> 00:39:24.418
image of,
"How could this happen in

00:39:24.418 --> 00:39:25.050
the United States?"
 

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.461
It was always the place that
you wanted to go to,

00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:28.820
because things were fair.
 

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.010
Things were right.
 

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:33.360
I believe, nobody asked me,
but since we're talking about

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.829
the view of Europeans,
I believe that people like Bush

00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:38.449
and Cheney ought to go before
the tribunal at The Hague,

00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:40.420
if human rights is going to
mean anything.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.068
Because they are from the most
powerful country in the world

00:39:43.068 --> 00:39:45.896
doesn't mean that they shouldn't
face the same kind of standards

00:39:45.896 --> 00:39:47.019
that you all believe.
 

00:39:47.019 --> 00:39:48.590
It should be that way.
 

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:53.800
Bernard Kouchner is a sort of
moderate politician in France.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.887
He's somewhat socialist,
but he's in the government of

00:39:57.887 --> 00:39:59.199
Sarko, Sarkozy.
 

00:39:59.199 --> 00:40:01.856
He was the one who helped one
of the original creators of

00:40:01.856 --> 00:40:03.990
MÃ©decins sans
frontiÃ¨res,

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.320
Doctors Without Borders.
 

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.503
French, but not just French,
Americans and other people,

00:40:08.503 --> 00:40:11.400
many of you may do this,
go off and try to help.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.795
I have a friend who's a
physician's assistant who goes

00:40:13.795 --> 00:40:16.510
off to Guatemala all the time to
help people in Nicaragua.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.690
Kouchner is a really good guy.
 

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:21.800
He's very pro-American.
 

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.565
He said--this is just chilling,
it ought to be chilling for

00:40:26.565 --> 00:40:29.690
you--he said that the magic is
done.

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.389
"The magic is over."
 

00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:32.559
That's exactly what he said.
 

00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:33.679
He said it in English, too.
 

00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:35.840
He said, "The magic is
over."

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.909
What was the magic?
 

00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:40.860
It was what this country
represents to Europeans.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.199
The magic is over.
 

00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:45.614
Then he paused and he said,
"Things will never be the

00:40:45.614 --> 00:40:46.420
same again."
 

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:54.581
So, I guess just in conclusion,
it's up to you to believe in

00:40:54.581 --> 00:40:57.960
human rights and believe in the
value of people,

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.670
whether they're clandestine,
or legal immigrants or not,

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.833
and that human rights should be
written on the face of this

00:41:04.833 --> 00:41:07.920
country as well,
and that you can return and

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.440
restore that magic.

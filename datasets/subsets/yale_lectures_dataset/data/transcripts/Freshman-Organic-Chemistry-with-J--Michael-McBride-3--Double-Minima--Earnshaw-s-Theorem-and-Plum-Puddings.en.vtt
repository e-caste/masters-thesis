00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.190
Prof: This is the slide
from the end of last time,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.570
we didn't quite finish it.
 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.730
Equilibrium versus Resonance.
 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.191
Remember, equilibrium is a case
where you have two different

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:13.794
species,
different structures,

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:16.030
and you go back and forth
between them,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.000
maybe fast, maybe slow.
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.420
Like the hydrogen could be
attached to the top or it could

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.580
be attached to the bottom
oxygen,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700
and those are different,
two different,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.630
what's called isomers;
we'll get to that later on.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.838
Or you could imagine the same
thing if you take the hydrogen

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:32.671
off,
you could have a short double

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.380
bond to oxygen and a long single
bond to oxygen,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.703
or they could exchange as to
which oxygen was long and which

00:00:38.703 --> 00:00:39.380
was short.
 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.960
So you could have an
equilibrium there.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.836
But it turns out you don't,
that in fact it's not two

00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:50.400
different species,
it's one species.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.290
It's a single minimum not a
double minimum.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.320
Now how do you know this?
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.286
How do you know it's just one
nuclear geometry with an

00:00:58.286 --> 00:00:59.910
intermediate bond distance?
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.176
The only way you know is by
experiment or by some really

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:05.849
fancy calculation that you have
to believe.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:08.799
A lot of people would believe
experiments before calculations;

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.769
some are the other way around.
 

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.399
But there's evidence from a
technique called electron

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.098
paramagnetic resonance,
or EPR, that shows that indeed

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:21.030
this is one species,
a single minimum.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.772
If you have an extra electron
on it and you have a carboxylate

00:01:25.772 --> 00:01:30.438
anion, then again it's just one
species, a single minimum.

00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:34.723
And there's evidence of that
from infrared spectroscopy that

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:37.120
we'll talk about next semester.
 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.379
But don't be disappointed that
you're not able to predict this.

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:45.715
A lot of really smart,
experienced people couldn't

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:46.599
predict it.
 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.530
This is lore.
 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.575
If you look it up in the Oxford
English Dictionary it says that

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:57.578
lore is, "That which is
learned; learning,

00:01:57.578 --> 00:01:59.340
scholarship,
erudition.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.402
Also, in recent use,
applied to the body of

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:05.902
traditional facts,
anecdotes, or beliefs relating

00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:08.599
to some particular
subject."

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.729
So a lot of things are lore.
 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.908
You just have to learn them.
 

00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:16.460
You can't predict them ahead of
time, they're way too subtle.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.973
So don't be disappointed,
because you haven't had enough

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:24.775
time yet to get the lore;
you're not supposed to know it

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:25.038
yet.
 

00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:28.485
It would be nice if Lewis
theory was so accurate and

00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:31.930
straightforward that if you draw
two structures,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.781
there are two
structures and it's a double

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:35.300
minimum.
 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.894
But that's not true,
and you have to know from

00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:40.720
something, and you don't have
time to know yet.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.030
As time goes on maybe you'll
figure it out.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.882
This is from a good textbook;
it might be the one that we'll

00:02:47.882 --> 00:02:49.199
adopt next semester.
 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.221
It's a quote that says,
"Empirical rules"

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:54.940
(it's going to give)
"Empirical rules for

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.900
assessing the relative
importance of the resonance

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.620
structures of molecules and
ions."

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.191
That is, if you have two
different pictures that you can

00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:06.242
draw for the thing,
does it look halfway in between

00:03:06.242 --> 00:03:07.753
them,
almost all like one,

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:10.473
almost all like the other,
or some fraction of the way

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:11.120
between them.
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.680
How far is it,
one way or the other?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.282
These are two different
pictures you draw to try to show

00:03:16.282 --> 00:03:18.080
different aspects of the same
thing.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.188
But there is one real thing.
 

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:24.507
The molecule doesn't know about
resonance, it just knows what it

00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:24.848
is.
 

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:27.318
The problem is with our
notation.

00:03:27.318 --> 00:03:28.710
Okay, but anyhow here's what
they say.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.235
So rules that will allow you to
use this concept more

00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:35.355
productively by deciding which
ones are better,

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:38.068
which look more like the real
thing.

00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:40.199
Okay, so it gives rules and it
numbers them.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:44.669
"(1) Resonance structures
involve no change in the

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.358
positions of nuclei;
only electron distribution is

00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:49.389
involved."
 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.986
That is, when you draw these
two structures you don't move

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:54.205
the atoms,
you just change where you draw

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:57.405
a single bond or a double bond
or a dotted bond or something

00:03:57.405 --> 00:03:58.110
like that.
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.346
And in fact that's not even
true because it's not -- the

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:07.122
electrons know where they want
to be, it's the way we draw them

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.740
that's uncertain.
 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.355
So when you draw two different
resonance structures,

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:13.562
you're not changing where the
electrons are,

00:04:13.562 --> 00:04:15.819
you're just changing the lines
you draw.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.730
Is that clear?
 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.889
It's our notation that's at
fault.

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.593
"(2) Structures in which
all first-row atoms have filled

00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:29.494
octets are generally important;
however, resulting formal

00:04:29.494 --> 00:04:31.754
charges"
(we talked last time about how

00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:34.382
you get formal charges)
"and electronegativity

00:04:34.382 --> 00:04:36.851
differences"
(and of course we have to know

00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.726
what electronegativity is,
but you've heard about it at

00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:44.603
least) "can make
appropriate nonoctet structures

00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:46.839
comparably important."
 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:49.343
So if you have a bad charge
distribution,

00:04:49.343 --> 00:04:52.850
even though you have octets,
it still might not be a very

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.040
good structure.
 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.810
"(3) The more important
structures are those involving a

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.886
minimum of charge
separation"

00:04:59.886 --> 00:05:03.091
(so you don't want to have
formal charge separation)

00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:07.430
"particularly among atoms
of comparable electronegativity.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.670
Structures with negative
charges assigned to

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.379
electronegative atoms may also
be important."

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.855
So if you're going to get a
charge, put it where it wants to

00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:16.149
be.
 

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.259
Now, look at this more
carefully.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.379
Number two, it says 'generally
important.'

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.826
It doesn't say "always
important,"

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:26.420
but "generally."
 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.814
That's not such a great rule
because you have to know when

00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:31.899
there's going to be an
exception.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:40.002
Or 'however;'
this doesn't sound like the Ten

00:05:40.002 --> 00:05:43.500
Commandments graven in stone.
 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.694
Or "can make" a thing;
not that "it will,"

00:05:47.694 --> 00:05:49.029
but "it can."
 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.615
Or '"particularly"
or "may also be

00:05:52.615 --> 00:05:53.959
important."
 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:59.346
These are all weasel words
because the rules are not rules,

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:02.040
and this is all lore again.
 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.841
So people write these rules but
really the people who are

00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:07.694
writing the rules know the
answers ahead of time and think

00:06:07.694 --> 00:06:10.598
"Ah, it generally works
that way and mostly we can get

00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:11.850
away with it."
 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.894
But these are not rules like
the rules you want to learn in

00:06:14.894 --> 00:06:15.420
physics.
 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.000
You want to learn these because
it's sort of handy,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.790
but don't believe them.
 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.449
And notice at the top that it's
"empirical"

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:23.860
rules.
 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.218
It's not a fundamental theory,
these are just ways of sort of

00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:31.778
correlating a bunch of the lore
that's come in.

00:06:31.778 --> 00:06:35.377
And what's important is the
experiments, not theories like

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:35.819
this.
 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.810
And we'll get better theories
later.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.653
Okay, so the goal of this Lewis
stuff was from the number of

00:06:42.653 --> 00:06:46.497
valence electrons it would be
nice to be able to predict the

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:48.892
constitution,
that is, the valence numbers

00:06:48.892 --> 00:06:51.769
for the different atoms,
how many atoms of one kind or

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:54.230
another get together to make a
molecule.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.305
Reactivity, we've seen a little
bit of that at least,

00:06:57.305 --> 00:07:00.620
that unshared pairs can get
together with vacant orbitals

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.040
and make a new bond.
 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.057
That wasn't something that was
part of the original rules of

00:07:06.057 --> 00:07:06.740
valence.
 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.959
And maybe something about
charge distribution as well.

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:15.778
Now let's look at the case of
O_2 and O_3, and apply some of

00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:16.839
this stuff.
 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.372
So O_2_,
you can have -- complete

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:22.449
the octets by bringing two
oxygen atoms together and

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.560
forming two bonds between them.
 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.540
So that looks pretty good,
and it's a double bond,

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.858
and we can draw it that way
with just lines and forget the

00:07:30.858 --> 00:07:34.295
unshared pairs if we're not
particularly concerned with them

00:07:34.295 --> 00:07:35.459
at a given time.
 

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:37.600
Okay, now suppose you make O_3.
 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.956
You could do the same kind of
trick there and make a

00:07:39.956 --> 00:07:43.050
three-membered ring,
or you could make it linear,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.970
or bent instead of a
symmetrical three-membered ring.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.360
So you could have an
equilateral triangle like that,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.108
or you could have it like this,
have O_2_ and bring

00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:56.920
in another oxygen on one of the
lone pairs.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.470
Now that's not an equilateral
triangle;

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.516
it's a triangle,
or it could conceivably be a

00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:03.516
straight line,
we're not quite sure what the

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:04.959
geometric implications are.
 

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:10.708
Okay, but we could call it an
open structure as compared to

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:12.790
the ring structure.
 

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.312
And we can draw it like that,
and the formal charges would be

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:16.959
as shown.
 

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.430
Why?
 

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.865
Because that pair that
originally belonged only to the

00:08:21.865 --> 00:08:25.365
original top oxygen of O_2 is
now shared with the other

00:08:25.365 --> 00:08:26.079
oxygen.
 

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:29.199
So one of them loses
half-interest in a pair,

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:33.100
the other gains half-interest
in the pair and it's plus,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.808
minus.
 

00:08:33.808 --> 00:08:39.178
So the trivalent oxygen is
positive, as you would expect.

00:08:39.178 --> 00:08:43.634
Now, what is the true structure
of the molecule ozone,

00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:44.139
O_3?
 

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:47.929
Well you have to do some
experiment to find that out or

00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:51.440
some high-faluting calculation
that you believe;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.678
a quantum mechanical
calculation.

00:08:52.678 --> 00:08:55.629
So it could be a ring or it
could be an open structure.

00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:58.837
And notice, in the open
structure you should have two

00:08:58.837 --> 00:09:01.995
resonance structures,
because you could draw it that

00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:04.000
way,
or you could draw it that way,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.633
and it could be two minima --
it could be a double minima --

00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:10.681
double minimum situation,
or it could be distorted one

00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.649
way or the other and click back
and forth.

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:17.235
Or it could be that the true
structure is in between with

00:09:17.235 --> 00:09:19.120
equal bond distances.
 

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.538
So we have to find out
something about this.

00:09:21.538 --> 00:09:25.615
Now one way of finding it out
is to do calculations and draw a

00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:29.827
graph that shows what the answer
is, and that's what we're going

00:09:29.827 --> 00:09:30.830
to do here.
 

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.720
It's based on some fairly
recent high-level calculations.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.200
But the problem is drawing the
graph,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.990
because if you want to be able
to show the structure,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.673
you have to -- how many
variables do you have to specify

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:49.908
to say what the structure of O_3
is?

00:09:49.908 --> 00:09:52.899
How many numbers would you have
to have?

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:55.120
It's three particles, right?
 

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.360
So if you gave this distance
and this distance and this

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.759
distance, that would fix the
triangle.

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:05.000
Or you could give this distance
and this distance and the angle

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.480
here.
 

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.308
That would also specify the
triangle.

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:12.385
But any way you slice it,
you have to have three numbers

00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:15.392
to tell the structure,
and then you have to have

00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:18.019
another number in your graph to
say what the energy is,

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:20.908
when it has that structure.
 

00:10:20.908 --> 00:10:24.259
So you have to plot four
variables.

00:10:24.259 --> 00:10:28.474
And that's not trivial on a
piece of paper,

00:10:28.474 --> 00:10:32.889
to plot a graph with four
variables in it.

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:37.082
So three distances plus energy,
or two distances and an angle

00:10:37.082 --> 00:10:39.178
and energy you need to plot.
 

00:10:39.178 --> 00:10:41.467
So if you're good at plotting
things and have had a lot of

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:44.143
experience,
great, but if you need a little

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:48.370
warm-up exercise you could look
at this webpage that you get by

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.517
clicking up at the top there,
and it uses these graphs to

00:10:52.517 --> 00:10:56.804
give you a little exercise in
plotting things that are in many

00:10:56.804 --> 00:10:57.788
dimensions.
 

00:10:57.788 --> 00:11:01.336
But we're not going to do that
in class, that's just to do on

00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:03.700
your own or with a discussion
section.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.558
And we'll show the specific
example of how we're going to do

00:11:07.558 --> 00:11:09.129
it in the case of O_3.
 

00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:14.149
So to specify O_3 we need four
dimensions.

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:18.477
Now here we have a plot that
shows one distance,

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.610
a second distance and the
angle.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.490
So that'll specify where the
three oxygens are.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.740
But Rutenberg and his coworkers
here, in 1997,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.423
when they did the fancy
calculation, did it a little

00:11:31.423 --> 00:11:32.580
differently.
 

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.830
They constrained it.
 

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.889
They didn't allow everything to
vary.

00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:40.865
They said we're going to
require the two distances to be

00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:41.860
the same.
 

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.841
So now instead of three
variables, you have only two,

00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:50.129
and you can plot those two on a
two-dimensional paper;

00:11:50.129 --> 00:11:52.259
you can plot two things.
 

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:57.110
So here we're going to plot the
position.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.898
If the two distances are equal,
then if you know the position

00:12:00.898 --> 00:12:04.558
of the top right you know the
position of the top left,

00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:07.529
because the original oxygen is
at the origin 0,0.

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:09.720
Everybody with me on that?
 

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.357
So we're going to look only at
where the top right oxygen is,

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:16.753
and the other one will be
someplace symmetrically related

00:12:16.753 --> 00:12:17.360
to it.
 

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.942
So we're going to blow that up,
and here's the plot they give

00:12:20.942 --> 00:12:21.360
then.
 

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.913
So now any point on this will
specify a precise geometry of

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.830
the three oxygens.
 

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.730
Everybody with me?
 

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.480
We choose a point that tells
where the top right one is.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.325
The bottom one is at 0,0,
and the top left is just on the

00:12:37.325 --> 00:12:41.240
other side, in the corresponding
mirror-image position.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.288
So any point on that thing will
specify the structure.

00:12:44.288 --> 00:12:47.937
But now we still -- but that's
used up our two dimensions of

00:12:47.937 --> 00:12:48.679
the paper.
 

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:52.538
How do we show the energy?
 

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:56.058
Can you think of a
three-dimensional graph you've

00:12:56.058 --> 00:12:56.940
ever used?
 

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.990
Student:  Color codes.
 

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.509
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:00.000
Student:  Color codes.
 

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.070
Prof: You could color
code it.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.110
You could make red really high
and blue really low.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.110
That would be one way to do it.
 

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.302
There are earlier ways,
before printing made it -- or

00:13:10.302 --> 00:13:12.759
computers made it easy to make
colors.

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:13.278
Student:  Contour lines.
 

00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:14.200
Prof: Did you ever go
hiking?

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.669
Yes what?
 

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.860
Student:  Contour lines.
 

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.942
Prof: Contour lines,
like a geological map,

00:13:19.942 --> 00:13:20.610
right?
 

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.866
Okay, so we can draw contour
lines that show what the energy

00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:26.019
is for every one of these
geometries.

00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:29.452
And so if that -- notice that
at that position,

00:13:29.452 --> 00:13:34.155
that X, it turns out to be what
the red structure would be here,

00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:37.610
which is a ring;
equilateral, okay?

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.590
And this structure is open.
 

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.501
And I chose those particular
ones because when you do the

00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:49.870
fancy calculation,
those turn out to be the ones

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.230
that are at the bottom of
valleys,

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.029
low energy.
 

00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:58.620
And if you distort away from
those, the energy goes up.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.024
Now you can go up -- any
direction you go from one of the

00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:03.000
bottoms of the valleys you go up
in energy,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.058
but there's some particularly
interesting positions.

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:09.850
A particularly interesting
position is that one,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.970
because that's the pass,
that's the lowest you can go,

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.982
the lowest energy that's
required to go from one valley

00:14:15.982 --> 00:14:16.820
to the other.
 

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.255
Everybody, I think,
has probably done enough hiking

00:14:19.255 --> 00:14:21.840
to realize that that's the way
you'd like to hike,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.277
or that if you spilled a cup of
water up at the pass it would

00:14:27.277 --> 00:14:29.178
run down both ways.
 

00:14:29.178 --> 00:14:33.663
Now in fact we can use that
concept to make it even a

00:14:33.663 --> 00:14:36.535
simpler graph,
where we don't need to draw

00:14:36.535 --> 00:14:39.830
contour lines,
because we could take the

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.196
steepest descent path --
if you pour the water out at

00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:47.259
the pass and follow how it'll
trickle down,

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:49.480
it'll take the steepest way to
go down.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.149
It turns out it crosses every
contour perpendicularly.

00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:57.788
So you follow that and it would
go down to the bottom,

00:14:57.788 --> 00:15:00.567
and then if you kept going,
like if you dropped a marble or

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.166
something,
and it rolled down to the

00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:03.259
bottom it would keep going.
 

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:06.879
So there is a particularly
interesting path.

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:10.784
Not that the true molecule
would necessarily have to follow

00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:14.354
that path, but it's a
well-defined path that gets from

00:15:14.354 --> 00:15:16.240
one valley to the other.
 

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.226
So now what you could do is
take a knife and slice this

00:15:21.226 --> 00:15:26.490
thing along that green line and
unfold it so it's flat.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.190
Does everybody see how that
would be?

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.534
Like I remember once when I was
young we took a family vacation

00:15:32.534 --> 00:15:36.808
and the AAA sent you a map that
showed where you would go,

00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:40.678
but it also showed -- along a
particular highway --

00:15:40.678 --> 00:15:43.981
and it also showed another map
that showed how high you were

00:15:43.981 --> 00:15:46.389
all the time as you went along
the roads.

00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:47.350
Got the idea?
 

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.376
So this is exactly that kind of
thing, where as you go along

00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:52.840
that green road there are
different altitudes.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.500
So we could just -- we could
draw it this way.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.460
Does everyone see how that
works?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.714
So it's not quite as specific
about geometry anymore,

00:16:02.714 --> 00:16:07.376
the way the previous one was,
but it shows how much energy

00:16:07.376 --> 00:16:09.750
you need as you go along.
 

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.620
And a particularly important
one -- well there are two things

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.960
that are really important.
 

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.558
One is how high one valley is
compared to the other,

00:16:17.558 --> 00:16:20.725
how much more stable one is,
and the other is how much

00:16:20.725 --> 00:16:24.139
higher is the pass,
how hard is it to get from one

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:25.120
to the other?
 

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.075
Okay, so there now is,
in a two-dimensional graph that

00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:33.254
you can draw on a piece of
paper, is something that gives

00:16:33.254 --> 00:16:35.120
you this information.
 

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.426
Okay, but this required that we
choose R_12 equals R_23,

00:16:40.426 --> 00:16:44.190
in order to make this
simplification.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.315
The guys who did the
calculations said if we don't

00:16:47.315 --> 00:16:50.759
make R_12 equal to R_23,
then it turns out that all the

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.440
structures are still higher in
energy.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.801
So these are the lowest energy
structures, although they can't

00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:00.090
plot them on a piece of paper.
 

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:07.675
So the lowest energy structure
is this open form and it does

00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:11.019
have R_12 equal to R_23.
 

00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:13.240
It's a resonance structure,
halfway between;

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.071
not one double bond and one
single bond but a symmetrical

00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:18.588
one.
 

00:17:18.588 --> 00:17:21.444
Okay, so it's a symmetrical
single minimum,

00:17:21.444 --> 00:17:23.009
found by calculation.
 

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:26.623
And there's experimental
evidence that supports that too,

00:17:26.623 --> 00:17:28.430
but it's more complicated.
 

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.710
Now how about the charge
distribution?

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.146
What would the Lewis structures
that we've drawn here predict

00:17:35.146 --> 00:17:37.068
about charge separation?
 

00:17:37.068 --> 00:17:39.305
Would there be charge anyplace,
do you think,

00:17:39.305 --> 00:17:41.439
on the basis of this,
in the real molecule,

00:17:41.439 --> 00:17:42.710
which is symmetrical?
 

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.460
What do you think?
 

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.549
Anybody got a suggestion?
 

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:47.240
Yes?
 

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.358
Student: Well,
it would be positive on the

00:17:49.358 --> 00:17:51.170
central oxygen because even
converted,

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.180
regardless of which of the two
structures are on that side,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.720
that --
Prof: Both structures

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.480
have it positive in the middle,
so that looks like a good

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:57.920
prediction.
 

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.078
Student: And the ends
would be negative.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.308
Prof: Right,
and then partially negative but

00:18:01.308 --> 00:18:02.869
equally negative on the two
ends.

00:18:02.869 --> 00:18:06.190
Now is that true?
 

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.839
Well here's a picture that,
based again on -- so the

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:12.009
prediction is positive in the
middle, negative on the ends.

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:12.750
Is it true?
 

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.960
Well there's the structure,
the minimum energy according to

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.298
calculation, quantum-mechanical
calculation.

00:18:20.298 --> 00:18:24.627
And we can draw what's called
the surface potential of that

00:18:24.627 --> 00:18:28.210
structure, which again comes
from calculation.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:34.308
So you put a proton -- you
define the molecular surface --

00:18:34.308 --> 00:18:36.557
and that is a little bit of a
problem but we'll talk about

00:18:36.557 --> 00:18:38.750
that later,
where the molecular surface is

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.318
-- but then you put a proton at
a point on it;

00:18:41.318 --> 00:18:44.779
and we talked about this
before, for ammonium chloride.

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:47.813
You put a proton on and you
find -- or no,

00:18:47.813 --> 00:18:52.029
it was the BNH_6 we talked
about the surface potential.

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:53.960
Here's the same thing for O_3.
 

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.848
And you'll notice the surface
potential is high in the middle,

00:18:57.848 --> 00:19:01.096
a bad place to put a proton
because there's positive charge

00:19:01.096 --> 00:19:03.643
there,
and it's low on the two ends,

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.250
at least some place on the two
ends.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:11.700
So more or less the Lewis
structure predicted this right.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.400
So that's great.
 

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.703
We're not confident that it
will always work but maybe the

00:19:18.703 --> 00:19:23.608
lore will build up that way;
and it does.

00:19:23.608 --> 00:19:26.230
Okay, so charge distribution
also.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.893
So reactivity we saw was a
special attribute of this nice

00:19:29.893 --> 00:19:32.332
Lewis theory,
and charge distribution,

00:19:32.332 --> 00:19:34.769
at least qualitatively if not
in detail,

00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:39.140
for O_3_ and also for
the BNH_6.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.910
Now how about specific
distances and specific angles?

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.575
We'll get into that later on as
to whether you can do that from

00:19:48.575 --> 00:19:51.210
something like a Lewis
structure.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.960
And how about the energy
content?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.699
Well that's not so good
actually, with just Lewis

00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:01.660
structures, but we'll test it
later.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.410
Okay, so the Lewis-dot
structures.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.681
It attempts to provide a
physical basis for the valence

00:20:08.681 --> 00:20:13.269
rules, based on completing
octets and sharing electrons for

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:14.058
bonds.
 

00:20:14.058 --> 00:20:17.238
What it gives that's new is
reactivity due to unshared pairs

00:20:17.238 --> 00:20:19.069
where both of the
"hooks"

00:20:19.069 --> 00:20:21.279
in the bond come from the same
atom,

00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:23.140
you might say.
 

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.269
And it's convenient for
electron bookkeeping.

00:20:26.269 --> 00:20:29.880
It certainly tells you what the
molecular charge is.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.082
The formal atomic charges are
qualitatively realistic,

00:20:35.082 --> 00:20:39.990
as we've just seen,
at least in the case of O_3.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.740
And there's this question of
stability and resonance.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.066
But resonance actually is not
something nature knows anything

00:20:47.066 --> 00:20:47.509
about.
 

00:20:47.509 --> 00:20:52.239
It's just a correction we try
to apply to having made drawings

00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:54.099
based on Lewis theory.
 

00:20:54.099 --> 00:20:58.598
It's not something serious.
 

00:20:58.598 --> 00:21:02.069
Now, but this leaves us with
some serious questions.

00:21:02.069 --> 00:21:03.529
Why does Lewis theory work?
 

00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:07.680
What's so great about octets;
why not have a different number?

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.406
Or if you have a sestet,
instead of an octet,

00:21:13.406 --> 00:21:15.490
how bad is it?
 

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.028
Or how bad are structures that
have charge separation?

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:21.708
It said in those rules that you
don't want to have charge

00:21:21.708 --> 00:21:22.329
separation.
 

00:21:22.329 --> 00:21:23.490
Well how bad is it?
 

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.395
Suppose you had a choice,
you either had to have a sextet

00:21:26.395 --> 00:21:28.730
instead of an octet,
or you had to have charge

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.509
separation.
 

00:21:29.509 --> 00:21:33.588
Which one would win?
 

00:21:33.588 --> 00:21:36.980
How bad is "bad"
charge separation?

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.490
Remember it said that if you
put the negative charge on an

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.972
electronegative atom,
that's not so very bad,

00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:46.240
but how bad?
 

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.598
Now last year in the Wiki there
came an interesting comment.

00:21:49.598 --> 00:21:51.705
Somebody said,
"I have a question when

00:21:51.705 --> 00:21:53.058
drawing these structures.
 

00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:56.117
Is it more important to try to
fill the octet or to have the

00:21:56.117 --> 00:21:59.019
lowest formal charge on as many
atoms, especially carbon,

00:21:59.019 --> 00:21:59.849
as possible?
 

00:21:59.849 --> 00:22:02.038
And why?"
 

00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:06.848
That's a good question,
because Lewis doesn't tell you

00:22:06.848 --> 00:22:08.118
that at all.
 

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:11.123
And there's further the
question, "Is this at all

00:22:11.123 --> 00:22:11.858
true?"
 

00:22:11.858 --> 00:22:13.328
Are there
electrons --

00:22:13.328 --> 00:22:14.368
this is a really important
question,

00:22:14.368 --> 00:22:16.028
we're going to spend some time
on it --

00:22:16.028 --> 00:22:20.494
are there electrons in between
the nuclei that hold them

00:22:20.494 --> 00:22:24.368
together,
pairs of electrons?

00:22:24.368 --> 00:22:27.230
It'll take us several lectures
to get to answer that question.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.926
Are there electron pairs
between nuclei and are there

00:22:30.926 --> 00:22:33.058
unshared ones on some atoms?
 

00:22:33.058 --> 00:22:34.980
What's the nature of the force
laws?

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.890
That's what we're after,
remember, here altogether.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.068
Now, as to whether Lewis theory
is right,

00:22:42.068 --> 00:22:46.542
there's a very fundamental
theorem in physics that was

00:22:46.542 --> 00:22:49.920
developed in 1839 by Samuel
Earnshaw,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.038
who was a tutor at Cambridge.
 

00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:56.182
And the statement of the
theorem is that in systems

00:22:56.182 --> 00:22:59.578
governed by inverse-square force
laws,

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:04.919
things like gravity,
magnetism, electrostatic

00:23:04.919 --> 00:23:09.444
interaction,
there can be no local minimum

00:23:09.444 --> 00:23:12.430
or maximum of potential energy.
 

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.960
He proved it mathematically.
 

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.949
It's not our business to repeat
his proof, but that's the

00:23:16.949 --> 00:23:17.910
statement of it.
 

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.240
But we want to understand what
that means.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.538
One thing that means is that if
you have Coulombic interaction,

00:23:25.538 --> 00:23:29.244
positive/negative,
you can't have a minimum energy

00:23:29.244 --> 00:23:33.705
structure that has a nucleus
here and eight electrons at the

00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:36.320
corner of a cube,
because there are

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.788
inverse-square force laws and
that can't be a minimum energy;

00:23:39.788 --> 00:23:45.108
if it distorted,
it would keep going.

00:23:45.108 --> 00:23:49.201
Now we can visualize Earnshaw's
theorem here in terms of for

00:23:49.201 --> 00:23:53.432
electrostatics by the analogy
that you've all seen of magnetic

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:57.295
lines of force;
everybody's seen something like

00:23:57.295 --> 00:23:59.019
this I think,
right?

00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:00.930
And the idea,
if it's electrostatic,

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.451
rather than magnetic,
the idea is that lines of force

00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:08.176
emerge from a positive charge
and converge on a negative

00:24:08.176 --> 00:24:10.401
charge,
and then you'd make them

00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:12.990
continuous by drawing these
lines of force;

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.940
which iron filings of course
did in that case.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.996
And this was the idea of
Michael Faraday,

00:24:19.996 --> 00:24:24.429
whom we met a little while
back, and he thought these lines

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:27.410
of force were real physical
things.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.836
Most people don't think that
now, they think they're just

00:24:31.836 --> 00:24:35.392
graphs that involve
inverse-square force laws,

00:24:35.392 --> 00:24:38.078
but he thought they were real.
 

00:24:38.078 --> 00:24:42.794
And the neat thing about them
is they not only show the

00:24:42.794 --> 00:24:47.769
direction of the force that a
charged body would feel,

00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:50.189
because of the other charged
body, the one that created the

00:24:50.189 --> 00:24:52.420
lines of force,
they not only show the force,

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.238
the direction of the force,
they also show how strong the

00:24:57.238 --> 00:24:58.390
force is.
 

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:02.900
And the strength of the force
is by the density of lines.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.210
The denser the lines,
the stronger the force.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:10.480
Everybody's familiar with this
idea?

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.147
Speak up if things are not
familiar because I'm assuming

00:25:14.147 --> 00:25:15.750
they are, if I say so.
 

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:16.619
Okay?
 

00:25:16.619 --> 00:25:17.358
So you've seen that.
 

00:25:17.358 --> 00:25:18.920
Now let's just think about that
a little bit.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.338
Suppose you look at the line
density here.

00:25:21.338 --> 00:25:24.376
Through that little line,
there are three lines of force

00:25:24.376 --> 00:25:25.038
that pass.
 

00:25:25.038 --> 00:25:29.124
So let's say that means there
are three, the force is three at

00:25:29.124 --> 00:25:32.539
that -- and it's obviously
pointing to the right.

00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:33.180
Okay?
 

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.529
Now suppose you checked it out
at that distance.

00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:38.630
Stronger force or weaker force?
 

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.450
Students:  Weaker force.
 

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:39.920
Prof: Weaker.
 

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.759
In fact only one or one and a
half, or something like that,

00:25:42.759 --> 00:25:44.720
lines of force are going
through that.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.396
Now, how does it depend on
distance, the number of lines

00:25:49.396 --> 00:25:54.160
going through this standard
linked line, the blue one?

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.483
Well you see that in flatland
-- we're just doing this in two

00:25:57.483 --> 00:25:59.623
dimensions,
we'll get to three in just a

00:25:59.623 --> 00:26:00.917
second --
in flatland,

00:26:00.917 --> 00:26:04.219
in two dimensions,
the circumference through which

00:26:04.219 --> 00:26:08.483
all these lines of force pass,
the length of the circumference

00:26:08.483 --> 00:26:10.460
is proportional to the radius.
 

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.078
Right?
 

00:26:11.078 --> 00:26:15.558
So if you go out twice as far
there's twice the circumference.

00:26:15.558 --> 00:26:19.299
So the density of lines passing
through it is half as big.

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:21.710
Everybody got that?
 

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.808
Okay, so that means the force,
which is proportional to the

00:26:25.808 --> 00:26:28.920
line density,
must be proportional to 1/r.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.150
Okay?
 

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.490
So then as you move out twice,
there'll be half as many lines;

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.329
move out three times,
a third as many lines.

00:26:38.329 --> 00:26:38.808
Okay?
 

00:26:38.808 --> 00:26:39.930
But this is just in two
dimensions.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:45.030
Now let's think about,
how's it going to be different

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.190
in three dimensions?
 

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.710
Katelyn?
 

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.730
Speak up a little bit,
my hearing isn't so great.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.623
I said I went to my 50th high
school reunion,

00:26:54.623 --> 00:26:55.150
right?
 

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.786
Student:  Instead of a
line it would be more like a

00:26:57.786 --> 00:26:59.220
square, some sort of an area.
 

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.792
Prof: Yes,
it would be a two-dimensional

00:27:00.792 --> 00:27:02.058
area that this stuff's going to
be.

00:27:02.058 --> 00:27:04.846
Now if you have a certain
number of lines passing through

00:27:04.846 --> 00:27:08.098
at a certain distance,
and you go out twice as far,

00:27:08.098 --> 00:27:11.329
what's the density of the lines
going to be?

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:13.069
Can you think?
 

00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:14.109
Anybody help?
 

00:27:14.109 --> 00:27:15.710
Yes?
 

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.829
Student:  It'll be
inverse-square.

00:27:17.829 --> 00:27:20.087
Prof: Inverse-square,
because now we're not talking

00:27:20.087 --> 00:27:21.920
about the circumference of a
circle,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.259
we're talking about the area of
a sphere as we go out.

00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:26.970
Right?
 

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.913
So if we go to three dimensions
here and take your area and move

00:27:30.913 --> 00:27:34.292
it out, the surface is going to
be proportional to r^2,

00:27:34.292 --> 00:27:35.420
as you go out.
 

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.200
So the line density is going to
be 1/r^2.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.650
So if you have an
inverse-square force law,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.358
then you can draw lines of
force.

00:27:46.358 --> 00:27:50.077
The lines of force won't work
if you don't have an

00:27:50.077 --> 00:27:54.174
inverse-square force law,
because they have to drop off

00:27:54.174 --> 00:27:57.588
this way in order to give lines
of force.

00:27:57.588 --> 00:28:03.308
So in 3D such diagrams work
only for inverse-square forces.

00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:08.599
You can't draw a thing like
that for Hooke's law.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:09.019
Right?
 

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:12.380
Now, so here's a whole bunch of
charges, positive and negative,

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.440
and the lines of force between
them.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.910
And notice something
interesting.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:22.221
The lines of force start on
positive charges and end on

00:28:22.221 --> 00:28:24.088
negative charges.
 

00:28:24.088 --> 00:28:29.152
There's no other place in space
where all the lines go away from

00:28:29.152 --> 00:28:30.920
it, or go toward it.
 

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.420
Everybody see that?
 

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:37.739
It's only at the charges that
they all go away or all go

00:28:37.739 --> 00:28:38.609
toward.
 

00:28:38.609 --> 00:28:39.548
Right?
 

00:28:39.548 --> 00:28:43.673
And that has a very important
meaning, that you can't have

00:28:43.673 --> 00:28:47.654
someplace off in free space
where all the lines of force

00:28:47.654 --> 00:28:49.029
would converge.
 

00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:53.130
Notice if you were to have
something that was positively

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.577
charged,
and it's at a minimum of

00:28:55.577 --> 00:28:58.358
energy, then any place you
displace it,

00:28:58.358 --> 00:29:02.664
it'll get pushed back,
if it's at a lowest point in

00:29:02.664 --> 00:29:03.440
energy.
 

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.470
You push it any direction,
it'll come back.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.680
That is, all the lines of force
must converge on that point.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.980
Okay, everybody with me on that?
 

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.450
But it can't be.
 

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.769
The only place that all the
lines of force converge is on a

00:29:17.769 --> 00:29:19.108
negative charge.
 

00:29:19.108 --> 00:29:22.240
It can't be any place -- if you
have inverse-square laws,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.786
you can't have someplace in
space which is the lowest energy

00:29:25.786 --> 00:29:30.848
place for the charge to be,
except on another charge.

00:29:30.848 --> 00:29:32.980
The same is true,
you can't have a maximum

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.450
either.
 

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.660
That's a visualization of
Earnshaw's theorem.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.519
So if you have inverse-square
force laws,

00:29:38.519 --> 00:29:41.380
or any combination of
inverse-square force laws,

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.108
like a combination of gravity
and electrostatics and

00:29:45.108 --> 00:29:49.473
magnetics,
you can't get a minimum energy

00:29:49.473 --> 00:29:52.910
structure,
unless everything just falls

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.759
together or blows apart.
 

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:55.868
Okay?
 

00:29:55.868 --> 00:29:58.969
So Earnshaw's Theorem:
"In systems governed by

00:29:58.969 --> 00:30:02.564
inverse-square force laws there
can be no local maximum (or

00:30:02.564 --> 00:30:05.849
minimum) of potential energy in
free space."

00:30:05.849 --> 00:30:07.278
Okay?
 

00:30:07.278 --> 00:30:12.913
And that's why I don't just
float here, I have to be on the

00:30:12.913 --> 00:30:13.690
floor.
 

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.940
Right?
 

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:24.728
Did you ever see anything truly
levitating, something that just

00:30:24.728 --> 00:30:34.358
sits in space and doesn't move,
not touching anything else?

00:30:34.358 --> 00:30:37.740
That's been levitating for ten
or fifteen years.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:44.303
It's not plugged into anything,
it's just this thing right

00:30:44.303 --> 00:30:45.108
here.
 

00:30:45.108 --> 00:30:49.050
What do you conclude from
seeing that, about the force

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.910
laws that are involved?
 

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.670
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.670
Prof: There must be some
force involved in that that's

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.980
not an inverse-square force law;
otherwise it wouldn't work.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.402
You can read about it on the
Web, if you want to,

00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:04.318
it's not the business of this
class.

00:31:04.318 --> 00:31:09.884
There is a non-inverse-square
force law involved in that

00:31:09.884 --> 00:31:12.920
little magnet sitting there.
 

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.712
The only stationary points
allowed by Earnshaw's theorem

00:31:17.712 --> 00:31:21.808
are saddle points where it's
flat in energy,

00:31:21.808 --> 00:31:23.893
for all directions,
but you go one direction and

00:31:23.893 --> 00:31:26.165
then you go down,
go the other direction and you

00:31:26.165 --> 00:31:26.490
go up.
 

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:29.980
That's like a potato chip or a
saddle.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.465
So you can have saddle points,
but you can't have absolute

00:31:33.465 --> 00:31:35.240
minima or maxima of energy.
 

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.779
There's the picture of that
thing.

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:47.009
Let me do the -- this reminds
me to get back to seeing who's

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:47.750
here.
 

00:31:47.750 --> 00:35:08.929
&lt;&lt;Professor McBride takes
attendance &gt;&gt;

00:35:08.929 --> 00:35:12.204
Prof: Now we'll
continue, got a few more minutes

00:35:12.204 --> 00:35:12.630
here.
 

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.409
And yet it stands still.
 

00:35:14.409 --> 00:35:17.072
So there must be something
that's not an inverse-square

00:35:17.072 --> 00:35:17.960
force law there.
 

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.769
Okay, so J.J. Thomson,
in 1897, discovered the

00:35:22.769 --> 00:35:24.159
electron.
 

00:35:24.159 --> 00:35:27.360
So the idea is maybe electrons
have something to do with bonds;

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.920
that's what brought Lewis into
the game.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.750
But Thomson himself came up
with what came to be called --

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.516
and I don't know by who first,
I've tried to find out and

00:35:38.516 --> 00:35:40.483
can't --
the "plum-pudding"

00:35:40.483 --> 00:35:40.800
atom.
 

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.929
Has anyone ever heard of that?
 

00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:43.780
Yes, okay.
 

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.646
And I suspect that when people
told you about the plum-pudding

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:49.550
atom they sort of snickered.
 

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.369
Am I right?
 

00:35:50.369 --> 00:35:52.510
This was sort of a naïve
idea.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.230
It's not that naïve at all.
 

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.260
Let me show you why.
 

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.253
Here's the book by
J.J. Thomson called The

00:35:58.253 --> 00:36:01.722
Corpuscular Theory of
Matter, and if you look in

00:36:01.722 --> 00:36:05.260
there you'll find out what he's
talking about.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.469
He says -- he has a model of
electron configuration --

00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:12.586
he says: "Consider the
problem of how to arrange 1,2,

00:36:12.586 --> 00:36:14.391
3, up to n
corpuscles"

00:36:14.391 --> 00:36:16.469
(that's what he called
electrons,

00:36:16.469 --> 00:36:20.958
he called them corpuscles);
"Consider the problem as

00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:25.929
to how they would arrange
themselves if placed in a sphere

00:36:25.929 --> 00:36:31.250
filled with positive electricity
of uniform density."

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.900
So that's the idea of the
plum-pudding.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.929
You have this sphere of uniform
positive density --

00:36:36.929 --> 00:36:39.739
why it should be like that
nobody knows --

00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:42.947
but suppose you have a sphere,
and you put the electrons in

00:36:42.947 --> 00:36:44.994
it,
like plums in a plum-pudding,

00:36:44.994 --> 00:36:47.239
which is like a fruitcake in
England.

00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:53.023
Okay, now notice that he said,
"placed in a sphere

00:36:53.023 --> 00:36:56.909
filled with positive
electricity."

00:36:56.909 --> 00:36:59.460
Why did he do that?
 

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.427
Why didn't he just have -- like
Rutherford ultimately did it --

00:37:02.427 --> 00:37:05.489
a nucleus with positive charge
and electrons around and about?

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:10.221
Why did he put the electrons
inside the positive

00:37:10.221 --> 00:37:11.010
charge?
 

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.889
Zach?
 

00:37:12.889 --> 00:37:13.820
Student:  Was it lowest
potential energy?

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.050
Prof: I can't hear very
well.

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.500
Student:  Lowest
potential energy?

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.079
Prof: No.
 

00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:19.409
Yes?
 

00:37:19.409 --> 00:37:20.329
Student:  Well they were
thinking

00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.920
&gt;
 

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.699
maybe that they were going in.
 

00:37:21.699 --> 00:37:23.688
Prof: No,
no, they weren't thinking about

00:37:23.688 --> 00:37:25.507
things moving,
they wanted them just sitting

00:37:25.507 --> 00:37:25.929
there.
 

00:37:25.929 --> 00:37:30.018
Student:  Maybe because
on a macroscopic scale opposite

00:37:30.018 --> 00:37:31.092
charges attract.
 

00:37:31.092 --> 00:37:33.871
So maybe he might not --
Prof: Yes,

00:37:33.871 --> 00:37:35.889
but that's well known,
Coulomb's law.

00:37:35.889 --> 00:37:39.889
Yes Keith -- or Kevin, right?
 

00:37:39.889 --> 00:37:41.480
Student:  If you have
them all,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.719
you have a positive sphere and
if you have the negative

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:46.402
corpuscle inside,
then they'll cancel each other

00:37:46.402 --> 00:37:48.070
out and be a neutral body.
 

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.237
Prof: Yes,
but that could be -- it

00:37:50.237 --> 00:37:53.219
wouldn't have to be a big sphere
of uniform density,

00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:55.880
you could have a little
particle of positive charge,

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.269
of the same charge, right?
 

00:37:57.269 --> 00:37:58.789
It'd be the same deal.
 

00:37:58.789 --> 00:38:01.675
Student:  They didn't
know that the inverse existed,

00:38:01.675 --> 00:38:03.666
so they thought that --
Prof: No,

00:38:03.666 --> 00:38:04.539
none of this is it.
 

00:38:04.539 --> 00:38:06.880
It's what we've just been
talking about.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.469
Yes?
 

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:11.025
Student:  Isn't it about
accounting for the bonding

00:38:11.025 --> 00:38:13.492
between the electrons and the
protons and containing the

00:38:13.492 --> 00:38:14.119
electrons?
 

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:16.760
Prof: No,
bonding hasn't come up yet.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.989
This is something very
fundamental.

00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:18.750
Yes?
 

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.110
Student:  He was a big
fan of plum-pudding.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.579
&gt;
 

00:38:22.579 --> 00:38:24.219
Prof: He probably liked
plum-pudding at Christmas.

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:25.739
Student:  Did he have
experimental evidence?

00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:26.750
Prof: I can't hear.
 

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:27.909
Student:  Did he have
experimental evidence?

00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:29.039
Prof: No.
 

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:30.130
Yes?
 

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.626
Student:  Because
Earnshaw said that there should

00:38:32.626 --> 00:38:34.719
be no minimum or maximum --
Prof: Ah ha!

00:38:34.719 --> 00:38:39.172
Earnshaw said you can't have an
energy minimum for separate

00:38:39.172 --> 00:38:41.721
particles,
but if you put the negative

00:38:41.721 --> 00:38:45.505
ones inside the positive ones,
then you could get a stable

00:38:45.505 --> 00:38:46.300
structure.
 

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.536
It's Earnshaw's theorem that
required it to be a

00:38:50.536 --> 00:38:51.889
plum-pudding.
 

00:38:51.889 --> 00:38:53.329
Okay?
 

00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:56.623
Now why a sphere,
why not a doughnut or some

00:38:56.623 --> 00:39:00.070
other shape, a barbell or
something, right?

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:05.126
And he said that the positive
charge is distributed in a way

00:39:05.126 --> 00:39:08.900
most amenable to mathematical
calculation.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.510
He chose a sphere so it would
be simple.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.617
You've heard about spherical
cows and so on like that,

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:15.730
that physicists like to
calculate.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.061
Let's suppose there's a cow,
let it be a sphere,

00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:19.630
right?
 

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.550
So that's what he did.
 

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.670
That's why it's a sphere.
 

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:28.166
Okay, we can solve the special
case where the corpuscles are

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:31.304
confined to a plane,
if you do it in two dimensions

00:39:31.304 --> 00:39:33.889
-- it's difficult mathematically
in three dimensions --

00:39:33.889 --> 00:39:35.530
but you can do it in two
dimensions.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.610
And he gives a picture in this
book,

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:42.253
like this, which is a solenoid
magnet that attracts little

00:39:42.253 --> 00:39:46.675
needles that are magnetized,
and those needles are stuck

00:39:46.675 --> 00:39:50.159
into corks,
which float in the water, right?

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:52.242
So they have to,
the corks have to stay at the

00:39:52.242 --> 00:39:53.909
level of the surface of the
water.

00:39:53.909 --> 00:39:55.719
So it's a two-dimensional
problem.

00:39:55.719 --> 00:39:58.365
The needles are parallel,
the magnets,

00:39:58.365 --> 00:40:00.369
so they repel one another.
 

00:40:00.369 --> 00:40:03.679
But the big magnet attracts
them to the center.

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:04.179
Okay?
 

00:40:04.179 --> 00:40:07.494
So what he does is toss a
certain number of needles and

00:40:07.494 --> 00:40:10.440
corks in there and see what
pattern they form.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.670
Okay?
 

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.199
So here are some patterns.
 

00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:17.909
You can get these on the Web,
at Greg Blonder's website here.

00:40:17.909 --> 00:40:19.840
So if you have just one,
it goes to the center;

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.190
no big deal.
 

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:24.909
If you have two, you get a line;
there's no big deal about that.

00:40:24.909 --> 00:40:26.980
Three make an equilateral
triangle.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.619
Put in four, they make a square.
 

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:31.750
Put in five,
you make a pentagon.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.010
No one's surprised so far I
suspect.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.291
Except that sometimes when you
put in five and shake it up,

00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:39.670
you get a square with one in
the middle.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:46.000
Can you see where this might be
going?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.619
Let's keep going.
 

00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:51.780
Okay, if you put in six,
you get one inside a pentagon;

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:59.179
seven, one inside a hexagon;
eight, one inside a heptagon;

00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:04.539
nine, two inside;
ten, two inside.

00:41:04.539 --> 00:41:08.969
And sometimes it's like that,
and sometimes it's like that.

00:41:08.969 --> 00:41:13.110
These are experimental, right?
 

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.847
And if you put in eleven,
it's three inside,

00:41:16.847 --> 00:41:20.963
and then three inside nine;
although sometimes you get two

00:41:20.963 --> 00:41:22.835
-- pardon me,
I'm screwing up here --

00:41:22.835 --> 00:41:24.824
sometimes you get --
there are two different

00:41:24.824 --> 00:41:26.565
patterns --
sometimes you get three inside

00:41:26.565 --> 00:41:28.376
eight,
sometimes you get two inside

00:41:28.376 --> 00:41:29.599
nine, for that number.
 

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:32.840
Okay, and then you can get four
inside nine,

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.248
four inside ten,
five inside ten,

00:41:35.248 --> 00:41:38.994
and then after five,
if you put in more,

00:41:38.994 --> 00:41:44.505
if you put in sixteen,
you get one inside five inside

00:41:44.505 --> 00:41:45.000
ten.
 

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.070
What is this reminding you of?
 

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:47.699
Yes?
 

00:41:47.699 --> 00:41:48.860
Student:  Of orbitals.
 

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.400
Prof: The shell
structure of atoms.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.570
Right?
 

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:55.300
As you go down the periodic
table you complete a shell.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.126
So it's a model of shells,
and then you can get more and

00:41:58.126 --> 00:41:58.949
more and more.
 

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:04.340
So this is what Thomson was
thinking about.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.309
But that's just two dimensions.
 

00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.820
Right?
 

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.309
Three dimensions is a bigger
problem.

00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:11.599
But he could say,
he was able to say something

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:13.719
mathematically about eight.
 

00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:17.920
"The equilibrium of eight
corpuscles at the corners of a

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.670
cube is unstable."
 

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.791
Even if you have the spherical
charge -- so it's not exactly

00:42:22.791 --> 00:42:26.230
Earnshaw -- still you can't get
eight at the corners of a cube.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.409
Now Lewis comes alon,g and in
1923,

00:42:30.409 --> 00:42:33.952
as I've told you before,
he writes: "I have ever

00:42:33.952 --> 00:42:38.108
since regarded the cubic octet
as representing essentially the

00:42:38.108 --> 00:42:41.309
arrangement of electrons in the
atom."

00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:44.956
This is long after Thomson had
written this about not being

00:42:44.956 --> 00:42:46.090
able to do that.
 

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:50.610
So was Lewis ignorant of
Earnshaw's theorem?

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:55.204
Because by 1923 they know that
the nucleus is not a

00:42:55.204 --> 00:43:00.440
plum-pudding -- that is the
positive sphere -- that it's a

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.360
point.
 

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.570
So was Lewis just naïve?
 

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.050
No, look what he wrote, in 1916.
 

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:11.594
"The electric forces
between particles which are very

00:43:11.594 --> 00:43:15.324
close together do not obey the
simple laws of inverse-squares

00:43:15.324 --> 00:43:18.000
which holds at greater
distances."

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.619
So Coulomb's law breaks down.
 

00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:22.900
You don't have inverse-square.
 

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.190
So then you don't have
Earnshaw's theorem,

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.429
and you don't have to worry,
and you can get a structure if

00:43:28.429 --> 00:43:30.719
it's not an inverse-square force
law.

00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:31.570
Okay?
 

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.079
No trouble.
 

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:33.369
But what is the force law?
 

00:43:33.369 --> 00:43:36.748
Well Thomson thought the same
thing in 1923 in his book The

00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:38.300
Electron in Chemistry.
 

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.849
He wrote: "If electron
nuclear attraction were to vary

00:43:41.849 --> 00:43:45.492
strictly as the inverse-square,
we know by Earnshaw's theorem

00:43:45.492 --> 00:43:48.780
that no stable configuration is
possible with the electrons at

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.851
rest or oscillating about
positions of equilibriumâ€¦

00:43:51.851 --> 00:43:55.137
I shall assume that the law of
force between a positive charge

00:43:55.137 --> 00:43:57.940
and an electron is expressed by
this equationâ€¦

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.905
Then a number of electrons can
be in equilibrium about a

00:44:00.905 --> 00:44:03.706
positive charge without
necessarily describing orbits

00:44:03.706 --> 00:44:05.268
around it."
 

00:44:05.268 --> 00:44:07.914
And look at the -- we're going
to end right now by looking at

00:44:07.914 --> 00:44:08.619
this equation.
 

00:44:08.619 --> 00:44:10.784
What's that bit of it,
the first bit,

00:44:10.784 --> 00:44:12.409
the "one"
part?

00:44:12.409 --> 00:44:13.260
Students:  Coulomb's law.
 

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.639
Prof: That's Coulomb's
law.

00:44:15.639 --> 00:44:18.389
But he's got a correction to
Coulomb's law,

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:22.719
here at the end,
c/r, where c is a distance --

00:44:22.719 --> 00:44:25.110
you divide it by r and you get
a number --

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:30.179
and c is a distance that's on
the scale of atomic lengths.

00:44:30.179 --> 00:44:30.909
Right?
 

00:44:30.909 --> 00:44:36.349
And that means that as long as
c is very small -- pardon me,

00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:40.590
as long as -- okay so have I
got this right?

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:46.458
Okay, so when distance r gets
smaller than c,

00:44:46.458 --> 00:44:50.460
then the force changes sign.
 

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.360
Okay?
 

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.867
So what was attractive becomes
repulsive, and then you can have

00:44:54.867 --> 00:44:57.300
the electrons sitting around the
nucleus.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.739
Okay?
 

00:44:58.739 --> 00:45:02.699
So we'll see what happened
three years later next time.

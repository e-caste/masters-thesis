00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.473
Prof: All right,
class, I thought I'd start as

00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:08.550
usual by telling you what
happened last time.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.526
Not the whole thing,
but just the highlights so you

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:15.390
can follow what's happening
today.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.521
The main things I did last time
were the notion of an electric

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.904
field, which is going to be with
you from now till the end of the

00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:26.830
course.
 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.887
The idea of the electric field
is that if you've got lots of

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:34.347
charges,
q_1,

00:00:34.347 --> 00:00:37.510
q_2,
q_3,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.010
instead of worrying about the
force they exert on each other,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.713
you ask yourself,
at a generic point where

00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:49.398
there's nothing,
if I put 1 coulomb here,

00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:51.450
what will it experience?
 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.850
What force will it experience?
 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.270
You compute that.
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.100
So in your mind,
imagine a coulomb,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.791
and you find the force due to
q_1,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.030
it looks like that.
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.728
q_2 may exert
a force that way.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.653
q_3 could be
of opposite sign,

00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:06.409
so maybe it will exert a force
that way.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.519
You add all these vectors,
they add up to something.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:15.860
That something is called the
electric field at that point.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.879
There is nothing there except
the electric field,

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.897
but it's very real,
because if you put something,

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:23.659
something happens to it.
 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.080
So the electric field is
everywhere.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.930
The charges are in a few places.
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.364
Electric field is defined
everywhere, except right on top

00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:34.062
of the charges,
which is where it probably is

00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:34.860
infinite.
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830
Once you know the electric
field anywhere,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.560
if you put another charge
q,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.921
a real charge,
it will experience a force

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:45.334
equal to qE,
because electric field was the

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.629
force you would have had on the
1 coulomb,

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:50.349
and if you put q
coulombs, it will be qE.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.810
That's the electric field.
 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.404
So you can imagine computing it
for any given distribution of

00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:59.700
charges, because you know what
each one of them does.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.418
Then I said there's one nice
way to visualize the electric

00:02:03.418 --> 00:02:06.159
field, which is to draw the
field lines.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.616
You go to each point and you
ask, if I put a charge here,

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:12.639
a positive test charge,
which way will it move?

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.854
Then you follow that thing as
it moves and you get that line

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:20.139
and you get that line and you
get that line.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.229
You can draw these lines.
 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:27.949
The lines give you one piece of
information which is very

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.647
obvious, namely,
if you are here,

00:02:30.647 --> 00:02:33.430
the force is along that line.
 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.526
But I also pointed out to you,
you get more than just the

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:37.910
direction of the force.
 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.180
You also can understand the
strength of the force.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.703
The strength of the force is
contained in the density of

00:02:44.703 --> 00:02:45.598
these lines.
 

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.160
Now density has to be defined
carefully.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.080
It's not like mass per unit
volume.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.568
It's an area density.
 

00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:54.000
That means if you get yourself
1 square meter,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.750
you know, meter by meter piece
of wood,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.970
like a frame,
and you hold it there,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.620
perpendicular to the lines and
see how many lines go through,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.250
that's called the area density
of lines.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.860
That you can see will fall like
1/r^(2),

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.250
because if you draw a sphere of
radius r,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.271
that area is 4Πr^(2),
and the same number of lines

00:03:14.271 --> 00:03:16.270
are going through that as any
other sphere,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.340
so it will be proportional to
1/r^(2).

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.310
But so is the electrical field
proportional to 1/r^(2),

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.099
and I said, let us agree that
we will draw

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:33.060
1/ε_0
lines per coulomb.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.598
This is a necessity;
it's just a convenience.

00:03:36.598 --> 00:03:40.569
It's like saying I want to
measure distances in inches and

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.590
centimeters for daily life.
 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.890
You can measure them in parsecs
and angstroms,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.090
but you'll be dealing with
nasty numbers.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.656
So it's a convenience,
and the convenience here is,

00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:51.710
let's pick
1/ε_0

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.840
lines per coulomb.
 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.060
You'll see the advantage of
that, because if you ask,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.574
what's the density of lines
here on a sphere of radius

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:02.295
r,
if there's charge q at

00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:04.677
the center,
I got that many lines,

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:08.128
and the area of the sphere is
4Πr^(2),

00:04:08.128 --> 00:04:10.520
so the density of lines per
unit area,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.010
you see, is precisely equal in
magnitude to the electric field

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.189
at that point.
 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.810
If you had not drawn
1/ε_0,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.937
but maybe
5/ε_0

00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:22.827
lines,
then the line density will be 5

00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:24.000
times the electric field.
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.649
It will still represent the
electric field,

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.339
but we don't want to simply
represent it.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:29.060
We want it to be the electric
field.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.050
It makes it easier.
 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.935
Then I said,
let's take a slightly more

00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:38.720
complicated situation,
two charges.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.935
This is called a dipole,
one pole and another pole,

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:44.509
and you can draw the field
lines here.

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.026
You can see if you put a test
charge, it'll run away from the

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:49.199
plus to the minus.
 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.620
If you leave it somewhere here,
it'll go like that and loop

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.629
around and come back,
and you can calculate them.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.009
This is no longer guesswork.
 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.810
If you had enough time,
I hope you all agree,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.918
you can go to any point you
like and find the force of

00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:06.173
attraction due to this one,
the force of repulsion due to

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:09.581
that one,
add them up and you will get an

00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:11.600
arrow that direction.
 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.910
So one can draw these lines,
and the lines tell you a story.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.942
Then I said,
let us find the field in an

00:05:19.942 --> 00:05:24.079
analytic expression due to the
dipole.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:25.028
Yes?
 

00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:26.120
Student:  I have a
question about the dipole.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.358
If you put a test particle
going in the positive direction

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:31.689
of the x axis,
would it also _________?

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:32.360
Prof: No.
 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.459
She's got a good point.
 

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:37.860
If you put somebody here,
it will never loop around.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.810
Can you see why?
 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.137
Because as it goes further
away, this is trying to pull it

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:45.670
back.
 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.447
It's always going to be closer
to this guy, so it's never going

00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:49.120
to come back.
 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.000
This line will go like that and
this line will go like this.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.629
But anything else at any other
angle will loop around and come

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.389
back.
 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.547
All right, now the field
strength, if you want to

00:06:05.547 --> 00:06:07.528
calculate it,
you can use the formula for

00:06:07.528 --> 00:06:09.589
E due to this one and
E due to that one and add

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:11.160
them,
and I did that for you.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.560
I don't want to go into the
details,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.992
but I remind you in all cases,
the electric field fell like

00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:22.367
1/r^(3),
because the field of each

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.240
charges goes like
1/r^(2).

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.622
And if these were on top of
each other, they will completely

00:06:27.622 --> 00:06:28.769
cancel each other.
 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:32.800
So the reason you have a
non-zero field is thanks to

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.670
a.
 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.295
Therefore the answer has to
contain an a in front of

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:38.470
it, at least n the first
approximation.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.848
But that a,
from dimensional analysis,

00:06:40.848 --> 00:06:44.091
has to come with a 1/r
so that the whole thing has the

00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:45.660
same dimension as before.
 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.209
That's where you get
a/r^(3).

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:53.327
That a times q
times 2 and so on,

00:06:53.327 --> 00:06:56.889
that became the dipole moment.
 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:58.810
That was true here.
 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.730
We verified that's true here.
 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.023
Later on, we'll verify it
everywhere, because there are

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:06.889
easier ways to calculate than
what I'm using.

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:10.949
Then I said,
forget about the field due to

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:11.939
charges.
 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:15.850
Let's look at what charges do
when you put them in a field.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.220
So I took two examples.
 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.680
One was a very simple example.
 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.209
These are two parallel plates.
 

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:24.630
They are not two lines;
they are plates coming out of

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.410
the blackboard.
 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.290
They're filled with charge and
this has got charge on it.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.009
This has got - charge on it.
 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.824
And therefore,
the electric field will look

00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:36.550
like this, right?
 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.851
Because if you leave a test
charge, it will go away from the

00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:41.699
positive, towards the negative.
 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:43.916
Then I said,
suppose there really is a

00:07:43.916 --> 00:07:47.151
particle here with some
velocity, v_0,

00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:48.350
what will it do?
 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.815
You can see that the force on
this guy is going to be q

00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:54.060
times E.
 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.060
E is pointing down.
 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.125
If you divide by the mass,
that's the acceleration,

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.579
also pointing down,
and it's constant.

00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:04.237
So that's like a particle in a
gravitational field,

00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:06.629
except g is replaced by
this number.

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:11.499
So it will just curve like
that, and you can calculate the

00:08:11.499 --> 00:08:12.610
trajectory.
 

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.274
The final thing I did was,
what happens when you put a

00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:19.740
dipole in a uniform field.
 

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.894
Here as well,
I think I was rushing near the

00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:24.649
end, and even I couldn't read my
stuff in the corner.

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:26.170
So I will go over that.
 

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.154
If there's something that you
didn't follow,

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:30.509
then I will be happy to repeat
that part for you.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:33.058
But you should understand what
the question is.

00:08:33.058 --> 00:08:37.619
There is an electric field
which is pointing like this,

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:41.501
as if you have two plates here,
charge is here,

00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:43.360
- charge is there.
 

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.408
They're producing a constant
electric field in the horizontal

00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:49.418
direction.
 

00:08:49.418 --> 00:08:54.828
In that environment,
I take an electric dipole whose

00:08:54.828 --> 00:08:59.390
- charge and charge,
q and -q,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.210
happen to be oriented like
that.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.080
Question is,
what will happen to this guy?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.816
If you want,
you can imagine that it's a

00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:11.062
little massless stick,
and one end you glue q

00:09:11.062 --> 00:09:13.639
coulombs,
other end you glue -q

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:15.950
coulombs,
and your let it sit there.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.200
What will it do?
 

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.070
First of all,
it won't feel any net force,

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.702
because the force in this
direction is q times

00:09:22.702 --> 00:09:25.691
E and the force that
direction is also q times

00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:27.182
E,
if you want,

00:09:27.182 --> 00:09:30.250
it's -q times E
and they cancel.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.240
But that doesn't mean it won't
react.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.832
It will react,
because you can all see

00:09:34.832 --> 00:09:38.616
intuitively, it's trying to
straighten this guy out and

00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:40.860
applying a torque like that.
 

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.549
You follow that?
 

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:44.288
That's what it will do.
 

00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:49.076
And the way to find the torque,
the torque is the product of

00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:53.538
the force and the distance
between the point of rotation

00:09:53.538 --> 00:09:56.523
and the force,
and the sine of the angle

00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:58.495
between them,
that is to say,

00:09:58.495 --> 00:09:59.970
sine of this angle.
 

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.791
What the sine of the angle does
is to take the component of the

00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:06.009
force perpendicular to this
axis,

00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:08.821
because if you resolve the
force into that part and that

00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.782
part,
this part is no good for

00:10:10.782 --> 00:10:11.428
rotation.
 

00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:13.870
That's trying to stretch the
dipole along its own length.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.443
It's the perpendicular part
that's going to rotate

00:10:17.443 --> 00:10:20.798
something, so you get that times
sine theta.

00:10:20.798 --> 00:10:23.559
That you can write now as the
vector equation

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:26.928
p x E.
 

00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:31.409
Because p is equal
to--I'm sorry.

00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:33.509
I need a 2 here.
 

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:35.753
I forgot the 2,
because this charge will have a

00:10:35.753 --> 00:10:38.875
torque and that charge will have
a torque and the two torques are

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:39.509
additive.
 

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:41.240
They are both going the same
way.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.645
Then 2q times a
is p, and this is

00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:47.602
E and the
sinθ comes in the

00:10:47.602 --> 00:10:48.759
cross product.
 

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:51.798
I'm assuming all of you know
about the cross product.

00:10:51.798 --> 00:10:56.714
Okay, final thing I did,
which is, if you have a force,

00:10:56.714 --> 00:11:01.720
you can associate with that
force a potential energy.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.972
Again, this is something you
must have seen last time,

00:11:05.972 --> 00:11:07.899
but I will remind you.
 

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:11.312
As long as it's not a
frictional force,

00:11:11.312 --> 00:11:16.344
you can say the force is
connected to potential energy in

00:11:16.344 --> 00:11:18.769
this following fashion.
 

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:22.532
Or the potential energy at
x minus potential energy

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:25.700
at some starting point
x_0 --

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.320
I'm sorry, x_0
- x is the integral of

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.168
the force from
x_0 to

00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:34.168
x.
 

00:11:34.168 --> 00:11:37.615
This is the relation between
the force, as delivered to the

00:11:37.615 --> 00:11:41.178
potential, and the potential is
the integral of the force.

00:11:41.178 --> 00:11:44.350
For example,
for a spring,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.534
U is
½kx^(2),

00:11:48.534 --> 00:11:52.340
and F = -kx.
 

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.207
If you go to this one,
we tell you

00:11:55.207 --> 00:11:59.729
U(x_0) -
U(x) is equal to the

00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:04.945
integral of -kx dx
from x_0 to

00:12:04.945 --> 00:12:06.250
x.
 

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:11.177
So that gives you
kx_0^(2)/2

00:12:11.177 --> 00:12:14.090
− kx^(2)/2.
 

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:20.153
And by comparison,
you can see U(x) =

00:12:20.153 --> 00:12:23.538
½kx^(2).
 

00:12:23.538 --> 00:12:25.470
Actually, this is not the
unique answer.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.558
Do you know why?
 

00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:30.570
Given this formula,
can I immediately say this guy

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.518
corresponds to that,
this one corresponds to that

00:12:33.518 --> 00:12:34.009
one?
 

00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:39.139
Is there some latitude here?
 

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:40.808
Yes?
 

00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:41.928
Student:  You can always
add in a constant.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.198
Prof: You can add a
constant to both,

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:46.678
because if I said that,
that certainly works.

00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:48.943
If I add 92 to both,
it still works,

00:12:48.943 --> 00:12:52.308
because the 92 extra doesn't
matter when you take the

00:12:52.308 --> 00:12:53.279
difference.
 

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:57.863
So it's conventional to simply
pick the constant so that the

00:12:57.863 --> 00:12:59.649
formula looks simple.
 

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:03.879
Coming to other expression,
if you had a torque,

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:06.980
which is
pEsinθ,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.908
you can ask--that's the
torque--it's minus,

00:13:09.908 --> 00:13:12.340
because it's trying to reduce
the angle θ--

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.759
you can ask what U leads
to that.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:18.960
And you can see it's
-pEcosθ.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.476
See that, take the -U
and take the derivative,

00:13:21.476 --> 00:13:22.639
you'll get the torque.
 

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:25.714
But if you got two vectors,
p and E and you

00:13:25.714 --> 00:13:29.116
see the cosθ,
I hope you guys know that you

00:13:29.116 --> 00:13:31.158
can write it as a dot product.
 

00:13:31.158 --> 00:13:37.048
So that's the end of what I did
last time, okay?

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:39.538
The potential energy is
proportional to the dot product

00:13:39.538 --> 00:13:40.830
of p with E.
 

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.167
The torque is equal to the
cross product of p with

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:46.019
E.
 

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:49.366
And what does
pEcosθ mean

00:13:49.366 --> 00:13:52.409
if you plot it as a function of
angle?

00:13:52.409 --> 00:13:56.370
It will look like this.
 

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.710
This is Π and this is 0.
 

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.890
That means it likes to sit here
and if you deviate a little bit

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.129
and let it go there,
it'll rattle back and forth,

00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:10.490
just like a mass spring system.
 

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.715
In fact, you can very easily
show, near the bottom of the

00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:18.033
well, the potential energy is
proportional to

00:14:18.033 --> 00:14:19.769
θ^(2).
 

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:23.239
That's because
cosθ can be written

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:25.653
as 1 −
θ^(2)/2

00:14:25.653 --> 00:14:28.429
θ^(4)/4!,
etc.

00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:30.190
for small angles.
 

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.783
If you just keep that term,
you will find it looks like

00:14:32.783 --> 00:14:33.120
this.
 

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.590
Not very different from
U = kx^(2).

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:42.445
So what x does with
forces, θ does with

00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:43.450
rotations.
 

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.000
All right, so this is what we
did last time.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.269
Now I'm going to do the new
stuff.

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:56.763
So new stuff is going to give
you--I think it's useful,

00:14:56.763 --> 00:15:01.754
because it tells you the level
at which you should be able to

00:15:01.754 --> 00:15:03.419
do calculations.
 

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:06.600
So here's a typical problem.
 

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:13.436
You have an infinite line of
charge, of which I will show

00:15:13.436 --> 00:15:19.662
that part, and somebody has
sprinkled on it λ

00:15:19.662 --> 00:15:22.470
coulombs per meter.
 

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.278
So it is not a discrete set of
charges;

00:15:25.278 --> 00:15:29.070
it's assumed to be continuous
and it's everywhere.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.448
I'm just showing a few of them,
and if you cut out one meter,

00:15:32.448 --> 00:15:35.038
you'll find there's λ
coulombs there.

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:38.950
And you want to compute the
electric field you will get due

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.308
to this distribution,
everywhere.

00:15:41.308 --> 00:15:45.245
So you want to go somewhere
here and ask what's the electric

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:45.779
field.
 

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:51.850
That's what we're going to do.
 

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.960
Let's go here.
 

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.029
You will see why.
 

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:58.379
Now first of all,
you've got to have an intuition

00:15:58.379 --> 00:16:02.460
on which way the electric field
will point.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.320
You have a feeling?
 

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.200
Yes.
 

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.269
It will point here, this way.
 

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:13.399
Why not like that?
 

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.210
Yeah?
 

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:20.000
Student: 
&gt;

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.038
Prof: Okay.
 

00:16:21.038 --> 00:16:23.169
She said the horizontal parts
will cancel.

00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:24.590
That's correct.
 

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:28.636
Another argument from symmetry
is that if anybody can give you

00:16:28.636 --> 00:16:31.490
a reason why it should tilt to
the left,

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.909
I can say, "Why don't you
use the same argument to say it

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:35.139
will tilt to the right?"
 

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:38.245
Because this is an infinitely
long wire and things look the

00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:41.460
same if you look to the left and
if you look to the right.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.788
And the field you get should
have the same property.

00:16:43.788 --> 00:16:46.714
If this was a finite wire,
I wouldn't say that,

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:49.511
because in a finite wire,
that can be a tilt,

00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:50.720
somewhere here.
 

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.356
But infinite wire,
it cannot tilt to the left or

00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:55.826
to the right,
because each point has the same

00:16:55.826 --> 00:16:58.799
symmetric situation to its right
and to its left.

00:16:58.799 --> 00:17:00.850
In a finite wire, it's not true.
 

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.513
Life to the left is different
from the life to the right,

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.891
but for infinite wire,
you know it cannot be biased

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.079
one way or the other.
 

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.430
It's got to go straight up.
 

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.567
Secondly, you can find the
field here, here,

00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:16.092
here or at anywhere at the same
distance, you've got to get the

00:17:16.092 --> 00:17:17.259
same answer.
 

00:17:17.259 --> 00:17:19.450
Again, because if you move two
inches to the right,

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.858
it doesn't make any difference
with an infinite wire.

00:17:21.858 --> 00:17:25.568
You've still got infinite wire
on either side.

00:17:25.568 --> 00:17:29.005
So we'll pick a typical point
and calculate the field and we

00:17:29.005 --> 00:17:32.500
know that answer is going to be
good throughout that line.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.140
So now I take this point here.
 

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.868
I want the field here.
 

00:17:36.868 --> 00:17:38.740
I'm going to make that my
origin.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:45.200
Then I take a piece of wire of
length dx.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:51.410
dx is so small that I
can treat it as a point.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.182
Now the dx I've drawn is
not a point, but in the end,

00:17:54.182 --> 00:17:56.957
we're going to make dx
arbitrarily small so that it's

00:17:56.957 --> 00:17:57.710
good enough.
 

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:03.079
It's like a point and it is at
a distance x from the

00:18:03.079 --> 00:18:07.710
origin, and let's say that
distance is a.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.321
So let's find the field due to
just this guy,

00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:11.509
the shaded region.
 

00:18:11.509 --> 00:18:12.529
Think of a charge.
 

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:14.700
How much charge is sitting here?
 

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.113
I hope you all agree,
the charge sitting in this

00:18:17.113 --> 00:18:19.269
region is just λ
times dx.

00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:21.400
That's just the definition.
 

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.080
If you've got that many
coulombs, imagine a test charge

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.900
of 1 here.
 

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.355
Well, it will push it this way,
and the field due to that,

00:18:29.355 --> 00:18:31.415
I'm going to draw as
infinitesimal,

00:18:31.415 --> 00:18:33.720
so I'm going to call it
dE.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.510
You can call it E,
but dE is to remind you,

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.152
it's a tiny field,
due to a tiny section

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.098
dx.
 

00:18:41.098 --> 00:18:44.779
Now that electric field is
biased to the left,

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:47.130
but for every such section you
find here,

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.376
I'll find a section on the
other side that's precisely

00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:52.890
biased to the right by the same
amount.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.057
Therefore the only part that's
going to survive due to this

00:18:56.057 --> 00:18:57.720
guy,
combined with this,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:05.085
will be the portion here,
which is the vertical part of

00:19:05.085 --> 00:19:07.380
that force.
 

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.998
So let me find the contribution
first, only from this one,

00:19:10.998 --> 00:19:14.108
then we will add the
contribution for this one.

00:19:14.108 --> 00:19:16.720
For that one,
you just find the vertical

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.589
projection.
 

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.470
So how much is that?
 

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.002
Remember, the Coulomb's law for
the electric field is

00:19:23.002 --> 00:19:26.470
q/4Πε
_0r^(2).

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.358
So this is the q.
 

00:19:28.358 --> 00:19:31.338
That's the 4Πε
_0.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:38.324
r^(2) is that distance
squared, which is x^(2)

00:19:38.324 --> 00:19:40.098
a^(2).
 

00:19:40.098 --> 00:19:44.368
That's really like the field of
a point charge at that distance.

00:19:44.368 --> 00:19:48.326
But now this is the magnitude
of the electric field vector at

00:19:48.326 --> 00:19:52.480
this angle, but I want the part
along the y direction.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.519
So I've got to take cosine of
that θ.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:57.380
You guys follow that?
 

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.599
If you took this vector,
this part is

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:01.390
dEcosθ.
 

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.288
That part is
dEsinθ.

00:20:03.288 --> 00:20:05.588
But that angle and that angle
are equal,

00:20:05.588 --> 00:20:08.019
and cosθ for this
triangle,

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:13.967
you can see,
is a divided by

00:20:13.967 --> 00:20:21.140
(a^(2)
x^(2))^(½).

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.308
So this is the electric field
in the y direction.

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.945
I'm going to call it
dE,

00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:32.078
in the y direction,
due to the segment dx.

00:20:32.078 --> 00:20:35.368
The total electric field is
obtained by adding all the

00:20:35.368 --> 00:20:39.155
dEs or adding all
the contributions from all the

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.769
segments on this line.
 

00:20:40.769 --> 00:20:51.380
And that goes from - infinity
to infinity.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:57.480
All right, so now it's a matter
of just doing this integral.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.521
So this gives me
(λa/4

00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:07.277
Πε
_0)

00:21:07.277 --> 00:21:22.259
dx/(x^(2) a^(2))^(3/2),
integrated from - to infinity.

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:26.484
Now I can make life a little
easier by saying that this

00:21:26.484 --> 00:21:29.848
function is an even function of
x.

00:21:29.848 --> 00:21:32.772
That means when you change
x to -x,

00:21:32.772 --> 00:21:33.868
it doesn't care.
 

00:21:33.868 --> 00:21:37.098
Therefore the contribution from
a positive x region is

00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:40.490
the same as the contribution
from a negative x region.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.318
That also makes sense in this
picture here,

00:21:42.318 --> 00:21:44.960
because if you look at the
field I'm computing,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.981
this section and this section
give equal contributions in the

00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:49.038
y direction.
 

00:21:49.038 --> 00:21:51.170
But even if you did not know
any of that background,

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.318
as a mathematician,
if you see this integral,

00:21:53.318 --> 00:21:55.671
you would say,
"Hey, put a 0 there and

00:21:55.671 --> 00:21:58.357
put a 2 here"
namely,integrate over half the

00:21:58.357 --> 00:22:00.377
region,
because the second half is

00:22:00.377 --> 00:22:01.828
giving you the same answer.
 

00:22:01.828 --> 00:22:05.553
So you double the integral,
but cut the region of

00:22:05.553 --> 00:22:07.259
integration in half.
 

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:11.366
So at this point,
you are free to look up a book,

00:22:11.366 --> 00:22:15.560
if it was an exam,
but maybe not even if it was an

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.528
exam at your level.
 

00:22:17.528 --> 00:22:22.230
You should be able to do this
integral.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:27.769
So integrals have been around
from the time of Newton and the

00:22:27.769 --> 00:22:32.978
question of an integral is,
find the area of some graph

00:22:32.978 --> 00:22:36.410
with this particular functional
form.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.441
And the answer to any integral
is that function whose

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:41.190
derivative is the integrand.
 

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.032
So what you have to do is guess
many answers until you get the

00:22:45.032 --> 00:22:45.788
right one.
 

00:22:45.788 --> 00:22:48.288
But people have been guessing
for hundreds of years,

00:22:48.288 --> 00:22:51.082
and there's big tables of
integrals with all the integrals

00:22:51.082 --> 00:22:51.720
you want.
 

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.107
But you should still be able to
do some integrals from scratch

00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:57.720
and I'm going to tell you how to
do this one.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.145
But before you do the integral,
you've got to have some idea

00:23:01.145 --> 00:23:03.470
what the answer is going to look
like.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.608
I want you to get some feeling
about this.

00:23:07.608 --> 00:23:10.640
Answer depends on what,
is the first question.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.230
What's the answer going to
depend on?

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.490
Student:  a.
 

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.608
Prof: a,
you understand?

00:23:17.608 --> 00:23:20.994
Whatever this is depends only
on a because 0 and

00:23:20.994 --> 00:23:24.818
infinity are not going to be
present as part of the answer.

00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:27.145
If the lower limit was 5,
it can depend on 5,

00:23:27.145 --> 00:23:29.842
but it doesn't depend on any
other thing, other than

00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:30.528
a.
 

00:23:30.528 --> 00:23:34.670
Then from dimension analysis,
I got a length squared to the

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.138
3/2,
that's length cubed,

00:23:36.138 --> 00:23:39.288
and a length on the top,
so whole thing should look like

00:23:39.288 --> 00:23:41.180
something over length squared.
 

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.025
The only length I have is
a, so it's going to look

00:23:45.025 --> 00:23:47.910
like 1 over a^(2) times a
number.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.828
Once you got the number,
you're done.

00:23:51.828 --> 00:23:55.011
So I'm going to do all the work
now to show you that the number

00:23:55.011 --> 00:23:56.088
is actually just 1.
 

00:23:56.088 --> 00:24:00.253
This number will turn out to be
1, in which case,

00:24:00.253 --> 00:24:04.070
you will find it's
λ/2Πε

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.980
_0a.
 

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.868
Well, let's see how we get the
number to be 1.

00:24:10.868 --> 00:24:15.920
So does anybody know what trick
you use to do this integral?

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.460
This is whatever,
math 120 or-- yes?

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.670
Student:  Use
substitution?

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:21.339
Prof: Yes.
 

00:24:21.339 --> 00:24:22.630
What substitution?
 

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.730
Student:  x^(2)
a^(2) = U.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.609
Prof: That won't help
you.

00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:28.868
Yes?
 

00:24:28.868 --> 00:24:30.380
Student:  Can you use
trigonometric substitution?

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.049
Prof: Yes.
 

00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:32.259
Trigonometric substitution.
 

00:24:32.259 --> 00:24:37.858
Which one?
 

00:24:37.858 --> 00:24:41.630
Okay, look--no,
no, I don't blame you.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.190
I know the answer because I've
seen it, but if I have to work

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.410
on it, I'll try for a while
before I got it right.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.804
The whole idea is,
we don't like all these 3

00:24:48.804 --> 00:24:49.640
_______ here.
 

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.190
We want to turn that into
something nice.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.700
So I'll tell you what the
answer is.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.740
You can all marvel at how
wonderfully it works.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.205
So what we are going to do is
to introduce an angle

00:25:00.205 --> 00:25:05.566
theta--nothing to do with the
angle in the problem--so that x

00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:07.710
= tanθ.
 

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.269
That means instead of going
over all values of x,

00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:13.318
I'll go with the suitable
values of θ--

00:25:13.318 --> 00:25:16.118
I'm sorry, this would not even
be correct dimensionally.

00:25:16.118 --> 00:25:20.640
x =
atanθ.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.420
You can see that every x
that I want,

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.439
I can get by some choice of
theta, because tanθ

00:25:25.439 --> 00:25:28.356
goes from 0 to infinity when
θ goes from 0 to

00:25:28.356 --> 00:25:28.920
Π/2.
 

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.108
You cannot say x =
acosθ,

00:25:31.108 --> 00:25:31.710
for example.
 

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.029
You are doomed.
 

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:34.380
If x is
acosθ,

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.400
the biggest x you can
get is a,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.779
whereas I want this x to
go from 0 to infinity.

00:25:38.779 --> 00:25:40.130
So when you make the change of
variables,

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.308
you've got to make sure that
for every x you want,

00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:44.858
there is some θ
that will do it.

00:25:44.858 --> 00:25:47.375
Then the next thing you do,
you say

00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:51.446
dx/dθ =
a times derivative of

00:25:51.446 --> 00:25:55.368
tanθ which is
sec^(2)θ.

00:25:55.368 --> 00:26:01.618
Then you write that as
dx = that.

00:26:01.618 --> 00:26:04.951
What that means is an integral
dx is related to an

00:26:04.951 --> 00:26:07.450
integral dθ
by this factor.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.720
Therefore going to the
integration here,

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.355
I'm just doing that part,
which is going to be a

00:26:13.355 --> 00:26:16.450
sec^(2)θ
dθ.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.740
θ goes from 0 to
Π/2.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.838
Now let's look downstairs.
 

00:26:21.838 --> 00:26:25.180
Downstairs I've got
x^(2) a^(2).

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.015
x itself is
atanθ,

00:26:29.015 --> 00:26:33.200
therefore a^(2) times 1
tan^(2)θ.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.210
1 tan^(2)θ happens
to be sec^(2)θ.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:44.180
That to the power 3/2,
which is what I want,

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.484
will give me an
a^(3)sec^

00:26:48.484 --> 00:26:51.539
(3)θ.
 

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:52.538
So what do we get?
 

00:26:52.538 --> 00:26:56.602
You can see as promised I get a
1/a^(2) and I get integral of

00:26:56.602 --> 00:26:59.348
1/secθ,
which is

00:26:59.348 --> 00:27:05.890
cosθdθ from 0
to Π/2.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.900
Yes.
 

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.395
And integral of
cosθ is

00:27:13.395 --> 00:27:18.150
sinθ from Π/2 to
0.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.490
That just happens to be 1.
 

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:26.759
So the final answer is what I
gave you here,

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:28.589
E.
 

00:27:28.589 --> 00:27:29.528
Well, E is the vector.
 

00:27:29.528 --> 00:27:32.692
I've just shown you the
magnitude, but we've all agreed

00:27:32.692 --> 00:27:34.098
what the direction is.
 

00:27:34.098 --> 00:27:38.660
The direction is away from the
wire.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:45.771
So if you like,
if you look at this wire from

00:27:45.771 --> 00:27:52.400
the end, the lines will look
like this.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.474
If the infinite wire is coming
out of the blackboard towards

00:27:55.474 --> 00:27:58.185
you and you look at it this way,
if you go too close,

00:27:58.185 --> 00:27:59.750
you'll poke your eyes out.
 

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.657
Look from here,
you'll see the lines are going

00:28:02.657 --> 00:28:04.210
out radial everywhere.
 

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.410
The question is,
how do the fields get weak?

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.940
How does it weaken with
distance?

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.440
It weakens like 1/a.
 

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.108
That's a big of a surprise,
right?

00:28:14.108 --> 00:28:17.481
The field away from the wire
doesn't fall like 1 over

00:28:17.481 --> 00:28:20.788
distance squared,
but falls like 1 over distance.

00:28:20.788 --> 00:28:23.864
The reason is that every
individual portion of the wire

00:28:23.864 --> 00:28:26.882
has a contribution that does
fall like 1 over distance

00:28:26.882 --> 00:28:29.160
squared, but it is an infinite
wire.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.336
When you add it all up,
the net answer goes like 1 over

00:28:32.336 --> 00:28:33.220
the distance.
 

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.778
The field away from a wire
falls like the distance from the

00:28:35.778 --> 00:28:38.424
wire, on the perpendicular from
the wire and there's pointing

00:28:38.424 --> 00:28:39.440
away from the wire.
 

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.150
That's it.
 

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:49.730
Okay, so that's one calculation.
 

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.648
Then I'm going to do one more
and that's going to be the end

00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:55.509
of the tough calculations.
 

00:28:55.509 --> 00:29:04.150
Second calculation is going to
be an infinite sheet.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:08.315
On the infinite sheet,
the appropriate quantity is

00:29:08.315 --> 00:29:12.818
called the charge density,
which is coulombs per meter

00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:13.838
squared.
 

00:29:13.838 --> 00:29:16.535
That means if you cut out a
tiny piece, the charge on it

00:29:16.535 --> 00:29:18.740
will be sigma times the area of
that piece.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.150
So there is positive charge
everywhere here,

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:26.829
and the number of coulombs per
unit area is called sigma.

00:29:26.829 --> 00:29:28.009
These are standard.
 

00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:32.336
λ is coulombs per meter,
σ is used for coulombs

00:29:32.336 --> 00:29:33.509
per unit area.
 

00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:37.948
The question is,
what's going to be the electric

00:29:37.948 --> 00:29:42.009
field at some point away from
that plane?

00:29:42.009 --> 00:29:46.348
Once again, I think we can all
agree that the electric field at

00:29:46.348 --> 00:29:50.618
some point from the plane will
not depend on where in front of

00:29:50.618 --> 00:29:52.788
the plane you are standing.
 

00:29:52.788 --> 00:29:55.130
Are you standing here or are
you standing there?

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.779
It doesn't matter,
because it's an infinite plane.

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:01.538
If I moved 1 inch--I'll tell
you why it won't matter.

00:30:01.538 --> 00:30:04.458
If I moved 1 inch and the
answer changed,

00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:09.056
I should get the same change if
I didn't move and somebody moved

00:30:09.056 --> 00:30:11.608
the sheet 1 inch the other way.
 

00:30:11.608 --> 00:30:14.553
But when I move an infinite
sheet the other way by 1 inch,

00:30:14.553 --> 00:30:16.000
it looks exactly the same.
 

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.058
It's got to produce exactly the
same field.

00:30:19.058 --> 00:30:22.025
So you can always ask,
what will happen if I move to

00:30:22.025 --> 00:30:25.688
the left, the same as what will
happen if the sheet moves to the

00:30:25.688 --> 00:30:26.269
right?
 

00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:28.429
The sheet moving to the right
looks exactly like the sheet

00:30:28.429 --> 00:30:28.769
before.
 

00:30:28.769 --> 00:30:31.230
The answer won't change,
therefore the answer won't

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.250
change for you if you move to
the left.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.288
I've got infinite plane below
you.

00:30:35.288 --> 00:30:38.232
As long as you don't change the
distance from the plane,

00:30:38.232 --> 00:30:41.282
you navigate perpendicular to
it, no matter where you are,

00:30:41.282 --> 00:30:43.048
you will get the same answer.
 

00:30:43.048 --> 00:30:46.777
Same answer,
meaning same direction of the

00:30:46.777 --> 00:30:48.960
field, same magnitude.
 

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.170
And that direction has to be
perpendicular to the plane,

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.390
again for symmetry reasons.
 

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.080
If you tilt it in any one
direction, you have no reason to

00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.598
do it.
 

00:30:59.598 --> 00:31:02.670
For example,
if you tilt it this way,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.009
I can take the infinite plane
and rotate it,

00:31:05.009 --> 00:31:06.910
then the tilt will be in some
other direction,

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.786
maybe like that,
but the rotated infinite plane

00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:10.848
looks the same.
 

00:31:10.848 --> 00:31:13.136
In other words,
if the cause does not change,

00:31:13.136 --> 00:31:14.750
the effect should not change.
 

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.598
If I can do certain things to
the infinite plane that leave it

00:31:18.598 --> 00:31:20.575
invariant,
then I can do the same

00:31:20.575 --> 00:31:22.990
transformation to the location
of the point,

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.038
and that shouldn't have a
different answer.

00:31:26.038 --> 00:31:28.776
So the plane has the property
that when you slide it up and

00:31:28.776 --> 00:31:31.532
down parallel to itself,
or twist it and turn it,

00:31:31.532 --> 00:31:34.365
it looks the same,
therefore the field pattern

00:31:34.365 --> 00:31:35.960
should have that property.
 

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.134
Therefore the field has to be
the same at all distances from

00:31:39.134 --> 00:31:42.470
the plane anywhere on top of the
plane, and it's going to point

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:43.170
this way.
 

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.900
But you can also find out in a
minute--by the way,

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.519
you don't need any of the
symmetry arguments.

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:51.750
You just do the calculation by
brute force, it will have these

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.440
properties.
 

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.285
But it's good to know what to
anticipate, because maybe you

00:31:55.285 --> 00:31:56.608
made a mistake somewhere.
 

00:31:56.608 --> 00:31:58.380
It's good to know some broad
features.

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.930
So none of this is needed to
calculate, even in that problem.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.799
Go ahead and find the electric
field not where I found it,

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:06.210
but 2 inches to the right.
 

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.690
You'll find the answer looks
the same.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.828
So those symmetry properties
will come out of the wash,

00:32:11.828 --> 00:32:14.588
but it's good for you to
anticipate that,

00:32:14.588 --> 00:32:16.758
and that's where you should
look at the symmetry of the

00:32:16.758 --> 00:32:17.118
source.
 

00:32:17.118 --> 00:32:19.336
For example,
the source was a ball of

00:32:19.336 --> 00:32:19.890
charge.
 

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.834
You know if you rotate the
ball, when I'm not looking to

00:32:22.834 --> 00:32:25.348
rotate the ball,
it's going to look the same.

00:32:25.348 --> 00:32:27.723
That means the field pattern
should have the property,

00:32:27.723 --> 00:32:29.381
when you rotate it,
it looks the same,

00:32:29.381 --> 00:32:31.980
because the same cause should
produce the same effect.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:36.018
Anyway, going to this problem
now, let's find the electric

00:32:36.018 --> 00:32:36.940
field here.
 

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.368
Okay, now this is going to be a
stretch for me to draw,

00:32:40.368 --> 00:32:42.791
so I'm going to try,
but you'll have to go look at

00:32:42.791 --> 00:32:45.710
some textbook if you want a
really nice looking picture,

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.180
but this is the best I can do.
 

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:54.795
I take a ring of radius
r and thickness

00:32:54.795 --> 00:32:56.558
dr.
 

00:32:56.558 --> 00:33:08.423
I take an annulus,
and I ask, what will that ring

00:33:08.423 --> 00:33:13.118
do to this point?
 

00:33:13.118 --> 00:33:19.910
So let's take a tiny part of
that ring, this guy.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.053
Well, for that,
you just did what you did,

00:33:22.053 --> 00:33:23.358
you draw the line here.
 

00:33:23.358 --> 00:33:29.559
You'll produce a dE
that looks like this.

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:32.828
What is its magnitude?
 

00:33:32.828 --> 00:33:36.328
Magnitude is just given by
Coulomb's law.

00:33:36.328 --> 00:33:39.818
The q there is sigma
times the tiny area,

00:33:39.818 --> 00:33:40.710
dA.
 

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:46.230
Let's call this dA.
 

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.910
dA is the name for a
small area.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.460
σ times dA is the
name for a small charge.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.377
That charge will produce a
force,

00:33:54.377 --> 00:33:59.119
1/4Πε_0,
square of the distance,

00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:00.578
r^(2) a^(2).
 

00:34:00.578 --> 00:34:03.170
Finally, here is where the
symmetry comes in,

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.410
can you see that for every
section here,

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:09.710
I can find an opposite section
that will cancel everything but

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.389
the part perpendicular to the
plane?

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.179
So I should only keep this
portion of it.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:18.409
Namely, I should take the
cosθ.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.672
The cosine of that
θ is the distance

00:34:21.672 --> 00:34:27.992
a,
just like in the other problem,

00:34:27.992 --> 00:34:35.449
a/(r^(2)
a^(2))^(½).

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.039
This is now dE.
 

00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:38.733
If you want,
you can put this following

00:34:38.733 --> 00:34:40.161
symbol,
dE_perp,

00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.900
meaning perpendicular to the
plane.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.840
Yes?
 

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.990
Student:  Do you need to
multiply by 2 again,

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:49.269
because you're __________?
 

00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:51.500
Prof: Let's be careful.
 

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.813
Her question was,
should I multiply by 2,

00:34:53.813 --> 00:34:55.780
because of this guy here,
right?

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.865
In fact, I should multiply by
all kinds of other numbers,

00:34:58.865 --> 00:35:01.291
because so far,
I've found the field only due

00:35:01.291 --> 00:35:02.670
to this segment here.
 

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:07.483
I've got to add the field due
to that and that and that and so

00:35:07.483 --> 00:35:08.429
on, right?
 

00:35:08.429 --> 00:35:10.429
What will that contribution be?
 

00:35:10.429 --> 00:35:13.186
For every one of them,
this factor,

00:35:13.186 --> 00:35:17.079
(r^(2)
a^(2))^(3/2) is the same.

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:20.920
They all contribute to the same
factor, so when I added the

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.768
shaded region,
I'll just get the area of the

00:35:23.768 --> 00:35:24.960
shaded region.
 

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.800
All these dAs,
if you add them up,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.530
what will I get?
 

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:34.170
It will be sigma over
4Πε

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.989
_0.
 

00:35:35.989 --> 00:35:40.331
Now you've got to ask yourself,
what's the area of an annulus

00:35:40.331 --> 00:35:43.590
of radius r and thickness
dr?

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.438
So take that annulus,
take a pair of scissors and you

00:35:46.438 --> 00:35:49.672
cut it, and you stretch it out
like that, it's going to look

00:35:49.672 --> 00:35:50.440
like this.
 

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.679
This is dr and this is
2Πr.

00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:58.559
So the area of an annulus is
just 2Πr dr.

00:35:58.559 --> 00:36:05.192
So the sum of all these areas
is 2Πr dr and then

00:36:05.192 --> 00:36:11.010
I've got here (r^(2)
a^(2))^(3/2).

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:15.076
But now this is the dE,
due to annulus of thickness of

00:36:15.076 --> 00:36:15.889
dr.
 

00:36:15.889 --> 00:36:20.070
Then I've got to integrate over
all values of r,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.090
but r goes from 0 to
infinity.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:31.572
So I have here
σ/2ε_0

00:36:31.572 --> 00:36:37.771
times rdr,
divided by (r^(2)

00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:43.389
a^(2))^(3/2),
0 to infinity.

00:36:43.389 --> 00:36:45.639
Student: 
&gt;

00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:47.630
Prof: Did I miss a pi?
 

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:51.300
Student:  Shouldn't it
be sigma over ____ pi?

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.630
Prof: There is a 2 pi
here.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:53.050
Student:  Oh, okay, yeah.
 

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:59.050
Prof:
2ε_0.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.929
So do you understand what I did?
 

00:37:00.929 --> 00:37:05.902
I broke the plane into
concentric rings and I took one

00:37:05.902 --> 00:37:09.750
ring and looking head on at that
ring,

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.739
I took a portion of that ring
and see what field is produces.

00:37:13.739 --> 00:37:16.356
And I know that even though the
field due to that is at an

00:37:16.356 --> 00:37:18.121
angle,
the only part that's going to

00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:20.360
remain is the part perpendicular
to the plane,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.543
because the counterpart to this
one on the other side will

00:37:23.543 --> 00:37:26.949
produce a similar field with the
opposite angle here that will

00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:29.760
cancel,
so only the part perpendicular

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.760
will survive.
 

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:34.041
Then I found out that the
contribution from every

00:37:34.041 --> 00:37:36.639
dA had exactly these
factors.

00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:38.650
They all had the same r
and they all had the same

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.905
a,
so some of all the dAs,

00:37:40.905 --> 00:37:43.690
all I have to add is
2Πr dr.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.385
And that's the contribution
from this annulus,

00:37:46.385 --> 00:37:49.501
then I still have to look at
annulus of every radius,

00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:51.659
so that's the integral over dr.
 

00:37:51.659 --> 00:37:52.849
Yes?
 

00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:55.030
Student:  What happened
to the a _______?

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.690
I thought it was a
over--

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:57.690
Prof: Oh, I'm sorry.
 

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:58.539
It's there.
 

00:37:58.539 --> 00:37:59.880
Thank you.
 

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:08.449
There is an a still here.
 

00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:10.481
Yeah, I would have caught that
guy in a while,

00:38:10.481 --> 00:38:12.289
but I'm always happy when you
do that.

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.820
That's correct.
 

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.739
Okay, so now about how this
integral.

00:38:17.739 --> 00:38:24.170
Do you have any idea what you
might do now?

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.809
Yes?
 

00:38:24.809 --> 00:38:26.090
Student:  Use
substitution.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:26.590
Prof: Right.
 

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:27.090
What substitution?
 

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.387
"Use substitution"
is a pretty safe answer,

00:38:30.387 --> 00:38:33.179
but you've got to go a little
beyond that.

00:38:33.179 --> 00:38:37.360
Student:  Substitute
r^(2) a^(2) for

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.480
the ________.
 

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.170
Prof: Yes.
 

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:43.485
You can do that in this
problem, because there's an r

00:38:43.485 --> 00:38:44.820
on the top.
 

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.641
If you didn't have the
r, you couldn't do that,

00:38:46.641 --> 00:38:47.260
but now you can.
 

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.400
I'll tell you how it works.
 

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.925
First of all,
you can always do that

00:38:50.925 --> 00:38:54.030
tanθ substitution
even here.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.349
It will always work.
 

00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:57.284
The tanθ
substitution,

00:38:57.284 --> 00:38:59.619
if you put it here,
it will still work.

00:38:59.619 --> 00:39:02.170
You can go home and verify
that, but I will do it a

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.190
different way now.
 

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:08.851
I will say, let w =
r^(2),

00:39:08.851 --> 00:39:14.949
then dw is equal to
2r dr.

00:39:14.949 --> 00:39:18.000
So if I come here,
I can write it as

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.659
aσ/
4ε_0.

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:25.429
I borrow a 2 top and bottom to
make it dw.

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:31.965
w also goes from 0 to
infinity, but now I get

00:39:31.965 --> 00:39:35.170
(w a^(2))^(3/2).
 

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:39.757
Now this is simple integral,
dx/x some number

00:39:39.757 --> 00:39:44.344
to some power is x^(n
1)/(n 1), but n is now -3 over

00:39:44.344 --> 00:39:44.820
2.
 

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.789
So you get aσ/
4ε_0,

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:54.449
divided by (w
a^(2))^(-½),

00:39:54.449 --> 00:39:58.510
divided by -½,
which is -2 on the top,

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:05.130
and that goes from infinity to
0.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.219
So I'm not going to do this
much slower than this.

00:40:07.219 --> 00:40:10.007
This is the kind of integral
that you can see right away,

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:12.050
or you can go and work out the
details.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.510
This is something you should do.
 

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.130
If you have trouble with such
integrals,

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.407
then you should work harder
than people who don't have

00:40:18.407 --> 00:40:22.344
trouble with such integrals,
because you should be able to

00:40:22.344 --> 00:40:26.940
do x^(n 1)/(n 1),
and know that n 1 is -½,

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.849
and when it comes upstairs,
it becomes -2.

00:40:30.849 --> 00:40:34.067
Now if you look at this
integral, in the upper limit

00:40:34.067 --> 00:40:36.652
omega's infinity,
you get 1 over infinity,

00:40:36.652 --> 00:40:37.599
which is 0.
 

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:41.139
The lower limit when omega is
0, you get 1/a,

00:40:41.139 --> 00:40:43.110
and that will cancel the
a here,

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:49.119
and you will get
σ/2ε_0.

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:52.030
So that's the final answer.
 

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:57.271
So the electric field of this
infinite plane,

00:40:57.271 --> 00:41:03.349
if you look at it from the
side, looks like this.

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:08.300
The
σ/2ε_0.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.179
So what do you notice about
this one that's interesting?

00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:14.719
Student:  It doesn't
depend on the distance.

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:16.849
Prof: It doesn't fall
with distance.

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:19.998
No matter how far you go from
this infinite plane,

00:41:19.998 --> 00:41:21.539
the field is the same.
 

00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:24.753
Again, each part of it makes a
contribution that falls like 1

00:41:24.753 --> 00:41:26.039
over distance squared.
 

00:41:26.039 --> 00:41:29.496
As you go further and further
out, you might think the field

00:41:29.496 --> 00:41:31.079
should get weaker,
right?

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:32.380
How could it not get weaker?
 

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.710
They're moving away from
everything.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.530
At least with the line charge,
it didn't go weaker like

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:39.619
1/r^(2),
but it did get weaker.

00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:43.039
How can you go further and
further from a plane?

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:45.929
You are going further away from
everybody?

00:41:45.929 --> 00:41:49.570
How could it not matter?
 

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:54.739
Yes, any ideas?
 

00:41:54.739 --> 00:41:56.599
For example,
if you go very close to the

00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:57.650
plane, what happens?
 

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:02.913
If you go really close to the
plane what happens is,

00:42:02.913 --> 00:42:07.969
the field in each section here
looks like this.

00:42:07.969 --> 00:42:12.440
Therefore the part that's
useful is very small.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.630
If you go further away,
you get things like that.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.791
Maybe it's a little weaker,
but the part that's useful,

00:42:18.791 --> 00:42:20.550
this one, is getting bigger.
 

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:23.952
So by magic,
these tendencies cancel in the

00:42:23.952 --> 00:42:24.440
end.
 

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.000
It doesn't depend on distance.
 

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.054
Now unless you do the integral,
you will not know it doesn't

00:42:28.054 --> 00:42:30.101
depend on the distance,
because you can give arguments

00:42:30.101 --> 00:42:32.728
for why it'll get weaker,
arguments for why it'll get

00:42:32.728 --> 00:42:33.320
stronger.
 

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.188
The fact that it'll precisely
be independent of distance,

00:42:36.188 --> 00:42:37.880
you have to do the calculation.
 

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.829
Yes.
 

00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:41.340
Student:  What's the
negative sign?

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.570
Prof: Negative sign
where, here?

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.909
Student:  Yes.
 

00:42:43.909 --> 00:42:47.547
Prof: -2 is there,
but the upper limit is

00:42:47.547 --> 00:42:48.400
infinity.
 

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:55.960
Student:  Oh, okay.
 

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.500
Prof: All right.
 

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.925
Now here's the third problem,
and the good news is,

00:42:58.925 --> 00:43:01.789
I'm not going to solve it for
you, but I'll tell you what it

00:43:01.789 --> 00:43:02.130
is.
 

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:06.768
Here is a solid ball of charge.
 

00:43:06.768 --> 00:43:12.679
It's got some charge density
ρ coulombs per meter cubed.

00:43:12.679 --> 00:43:14.059
So ρ is the standard name.
 

00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:17.945
You use density for mass over
volume and you use the same

00:43:17.945 --> 00:43:20.719
symbol rho for charge per unit
volume.

00:43:20.719 --> 00:43:24.373
So somebody's assembled a blob
of electrical charge,

00:43:24.373 --> 00:43:27.739
and 1 cubic meter of that has
ρ coulombs.

00:43:27.739 --> 00:43:31.409
You want to find the field due
to this one.

00:43:31.409 --> 00:43:34.039
Now when you do a similar
problem in gravitation,

00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:37.920
it is generally assumed that
when you're outside the sphere,

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.233
the whole sphere acts like a
point charge with the entire

00:43:41.233 --> 00:43:43.070
charge sitting at the center.
 

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.369
But you actually have to prove
that.

00:43:45.369 --> 00:43:48.159
That's what took Newton a long
time to prove.

00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:50.684
He knew it was true but he
couldn't prove it,

00:43:50.684 --> 00:43:53.208
because for that,
you've got to be able to do

00:43:53.208 --> 00:43:54.469
integral calculus.
 

00:43:54.469 --> 00:43:56.518
And even today,
to find the field due to a

00:43:56.518 --> 00:43:58.820
sphere using integration is
quite difficult.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.519
Think about what you have to do.
 

00:44:00.519 --> 00:44:02.059
You want to sit somewhere here.
 

00:44:02.059 --> 00:44:03.516
First of all,
for a sphere,

00:44:03.516 --> 00:44:05.869
we know the field is going to
be radial.

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:08.369
It doesn't matter where you
pick, everything looks the same.

00:44:08.369 --> 00:44:13.059
You can decide to be
horizontally here at that point.

00:44:13.059 --> 00:44:16.920
Then you've got to divide the
sphere into tiny pieces,

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.983
tiny little cubes,
each with some charge rho times

00:44:19.983 --> 00:44:22.896
the volume of the cube,
and that will exert a force

00:44:22.896 --> 00:44:23.420
like this.
 

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.525
And you've got to integrate
over the volume of the sphere,

00:44:26.525 --> 00:44:29.139
but each portion is at a
different distance and a

00:44:29.139 --> 00:44:30.230
different angle.
 

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:31.809
You've got to add it all up.
 

00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:35.530
That's why it's a tough problem.
 

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.813
So to solve that tough problem,
we're now going to use a very

00:44:39.813 --> 00:44:43.670
powerful trick and that trick is
called Gauss's law.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:55.590
So we're going to learn today
about the Gauss's law.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.228
Now a prelude to that,
you need a little more

00:44:59.228 --> 00:45:03.199
mathematical definitions,
but they're not bad.

00:45:03.199 --> 00:45:05.909
I just have to tell you what
the definition is.

00:45:05.909 --> 00:45:12.184
Suppose I have in three
dimensions a tiny little area,

00:45:12.184 --> 00:45:16.802
like a snowflake,
but it's flat and it's

00:45:16.802 --> 00:45:20.000
rectangular, let's say.
 

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.929
I want to tell you everything
about it.

00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:29.030
I want you to be able to
visualize the area.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:33.789
What can I do to specify this
little thing?

00:45:33.789 --> 00:45:36.719
First I have to tell you how
big it is.

00:45:36.719 --> 00:45:40.679
If it's a tiny area,
let this area be dA

00:45:40.679 --> 00:45:43.416
meters squared,
but that doesn't tell me the

00:45:43.416 --> 00:45:45.929
orientation of this area,
because that area could be like

00:45:45.929 --> 00:45:47.463
this,
it could be like this,

00:45:47.463 --> 00:45:49.300
it could be tilted in many
ways.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:54.467
So I want to tell you it's an
area in a certain plane,

00:45:54.467 --> 00:45:56.320
what should I do?
 

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:03.260
How do I nail down the plane in
which the area is located?

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.179
Yeah?
 

00:46:04.179 --> 00:46:06.213
Student:  Define the
vector that's perpendicular to

00:46:06.213 --> 00:46:06.750
that surface.
 

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:10.170
Prof: Define a vector
normal to that surface,

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:16.195
because if you draw that
vector, then there's only one

00:46:16.195 --> 00:46:19.380
plane perpendicular to it.
 

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.019
Then we can follow,
we can then form a vector,

00:46:22.019 --> 00:46:23.039
dA.
 

00:46:23.039 --> 00:46:28.731
It's a tiny vector whose
direction is perpendicular to

00:46:28.731 --> 00:46:35.500
its area and whose magnitude is
the value of the area itself.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.800
So areas can be associated with
vectors.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.503
You may not have thought about
it that way, but you can by this

00:46:42.503 --> 00:46:42.940
process.
 

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:47.615
I've told you,
there's only one ambiguity even

00:46:47.615 --> 00:46:48.239
now.
 

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:50.090
Do you know what that one-- yes?
 

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:51.150
Student:  Which
direction.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:53.143
Prof: There are two
normal's you can draw to an

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:53.670
area, right?
 

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:57.654
We've got an area like this,
it can come out towards you or

00:46:57.654 --> 00:46:58.960
go away from you.
 

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.518
Therefore simply drawing that
rectangular patch is not enough

00:47:02.518 --> 00:47:03.409
to nail that.
 

00:47:03.409 --> 00:47:06.829
That's like saying,
"Here is a vector."

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:07.789
That's not enough.
 

00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:09.750
Where is the head and where is
the tail?

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.760
That's not a vector.
 

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.239
That is a vector.
 

00:47:13.239 --> 00:47:16.574
Similarly, this area has to be
specified some more and here is

00:47:16.574 --> 00:47:18.159
what you're supposed to do.
 

00:47:18.159 --> 00:47:20.958
You take that area here,
I'm just drawing it another

00:47:20.958 --> 00:47:23.976
place, draw some arrows,
then circulate around it in one

00:47:23.976 --> 00:47:25.130
sense or another.
 

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:28.219
I picked a particular sense in
which they're going around.

00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:30.570
Then use the famous right hand
rule,

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:34.170
where your fingers curl along
the arrow and your thumb points

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:37.840
in some direction,
that is the direction,

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.469
the area of the vector.
 

00:47:40.469 --> 00:47:43.315
If the arrows are running round
the opposite way,

00:47:43.315 --> 00:47:46.219
then your thumb will point into
the blackboard.

00:47:46.219 --> 00:47:50.110
So an area like this is like a
vector without a head.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.070
Area like this is a signed area.
 

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:56.619
It's an area that's got a
magnitude and unique direction.

00:47:56.619 --> 00:48:01.195
So get used to the notion that
a tiny planar area can be

00:48:01.195 --> 00:48:03.360
represented as a vector.
 

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.369
Another way to see that is,
if you took any area,

00:48:06.369 --> 00:48:11.969
a rectangular area like
this--square is a special case--

00:48:11.969 --> 00:48:15.141
if you took two vectors
A and B that form

00:48:15.141 --> 00:48:18.481
the two edges,
then A x B is

00:48:18.481 --> 00:48:20.389
just double the area.
 

00:48:20.389 --> 00:48:22.250
It's the fact that given two
vectors,

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.409
I can find the third vector
perpendicular to them,

00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:27.768
up to a sign,
is what makes a cross product

00:48:27.768 --> 00:48:30.030
possible,
only in three dimensions.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.507
You cannot have a cross product
of two vectors and four

00:48:32.507 --> 00:48:34.389
dimensions because in four
dimensions,

00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:37.570
if I pick two vectors,
they'll be two other directions

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:39.369
perpendicular to that plane.
 

00:48:39.369 --> 00:48:42.010
Only in 3D, there's only one
direction left.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:43.699
The question is,
is it in or out?

00:48:43.699 --> 00:48:45.753
That you pick a sign in the
cross product,

00:48:45.753 --> 00:48:48.610
A x B is
something that goes from A to B.

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.369
Or for an area,
you draw arrows around the edge

00:48:51.369 --> 00:48:52.869
in a certain direction.
 

00:48:52.869 --> 00:48:54.409
So area is a vector.
 

00:48:54.409 --> 00:48:57.987
You have to get used to that
notion, along with all the other

00:48:57.987 --> 00:48:59.119
vectors you know.
 

00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:02.260
Now I'll tell you why that
becomes useful.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:14.039
So we're going to take--let's
see--

00:49:14.039 --> 00:49:18.672
there is a rectangular tube
which has got a height h

00:49:18.672 --> 00:49:22.650
and a width w,
and some fluid is flowing along

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:26.507
the tube with the velocity
v along the length of the

00:49:26.507 --> 00:49:27.039
tube.
 

00:49:27.039 --> 00:49:27.789
You got that?
 

00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:29.480
It's like an air duct.
 

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.039
Stuff is going through that
tube.

00:49:31.039 --> 00:49:33.429
It's got a rectangular cross
section.

00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:40.500
The cross section area is
hw.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.255
If the fluid is going velocity
V along the length of the

00:49:44.255 --> 00:49:46.800
tube,
what is the flow rate,

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:52.329
which is equal to meter cubed
of stuff flowing per second.

00:49:52.329 --> 00:49:56.010
I'm going to denote it by the
symbol Φ.

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.855
If I wait 1 second and I watch
all the fluid go by me,

00:49:59.855 --> 00:50:03.409
past any cross section,
how much stuff goes by?

00:50:03.409 --> 00:50:06.380
I think you can all see,
if I wait 1 second,

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:11.239
the fluid whose front was here
would have advanced to here,

00:50:11.239 --> 00:50:13.260
and the volume here will be
v times 1,

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.079
because in 1 second,
it goes a distance v.

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:24.800
So the flow rate will be
hwv or area times

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.800
v.
 

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.969
That makes sense?
 

00:50:27.969 --> 00:50:30.018
The faster it's going,
the more stuff you get.

00:50:30.018 --> 00:50:32.050
The bigger the cross section,
the more stuff you get.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:34.210
This doesn't depend on a
rectangular cross section.

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.530
It can be cylindrical pipe
carrying oil.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:40.590
Again, the flow rate is area
times velocity.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:44.820
But I'm going to write this in
terms of vectors,

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.599
because I know the velocity is
a vector.

00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:50.590
But now I have also learned
area is a vector,

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:54.360
because area vector here,
you can draw a vector

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.103
perpendicular to this area,
and I'll draw up this

00:50:58.103 --> 00:51:01.219
convention that it's area
vectors along this way,

00:51:01.219 --> 00:51:02.860
rather than the other way.
 

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:08.300
Then I can write this
v⋅A.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.632
Let's check that
v⋅A is

00:51:10.632 --> 00:51:11.119
correct.
 

00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:15.025
v⋅A
is the length of v,

00:51:15.025 --> 00:51:18.719
the size of v,
the size of A and cosine

00:51:18.719 --> 00:51:20.849
of the angle between them.
 

00:51:20.849 --> 00:51:22.929
Here we've got to be very
careful.

00:51:22.929 --> 00:51:25.079
The velocity vector is like
this.

00:51:25.079 --> 00:51:28.231
It's perpendicular to the plane
but don't say it's cosine of 90

00:51:28.231 --> 00:51:28.739
degrees.
 

00:51:28.739 --> 00:51:31.840
The area vector is
perpendicular to the area

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.489
itself.
 

00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:33.650
Do you understand that?
 

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:38.048
When I take the dot product and
I will ask for the angle between

00:51:38.048 --> 00:51:42.170
the area vector and the velocity
vector, that angle is 0.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.360
For the area,
there's a little confusion.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.467
The vector representing it
happens to be perpendicular to

00:51:47.467 --> 00:51:49.190
the plane of the area itself.
 

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:51.159
So if you remember that,
then

00:51:51.159 --> 00:51:54.891
v⋅Ais
vA times cos 0,

00:51:54.891 --> 00:51:58.269
so this indeed is one way to
write the flow.

00:51:58.269 --> 00:52:02.050
This flow is also called a flux.
 

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:06.469
But now let us do the following.
 

00:52:06.469 --> 00:52:23.389
Let's take the same problem,
and I have this area here.

00:52:23.389 --> 00:52:29.030
Let me now take a tilted area
like this.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:32.500
It also goes from the ceiling
to the floor but still turned at

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.980
an angle θ.
 

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:38.400
So it's a bigger area than the
original one.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.190
How much bigger?
 

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:44.400
That area prime,
I claim, is equal to the base

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.018
w, times this side.
 

00:52:47.018 --> 00:52:52.710
This side is
h/cosθ.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:56.719
θ is the angle
between these two planes.

00:52:56.719 --> 00:52:59.266
It's a bigger area,
but you all know that just

00:52:59.266 --> 00:53:02.550
because it's a bigger area,
it doesn't intercept more fluid

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:03.400
per second.
 

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:08.030
Any stuff crossing this guy
also crosses this at the same

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.610
rate.
 

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:10.610
So how am I going to get the
same rate?

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:13.329
The flux is not going to be
v times A'.

00:53:13.329 --> 00:53:17.690
It's going to be
vA'cosθ.

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:22.840
But θ is the angle
between the area vector and the

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.829
velocity vector,
which is the same angle here.

00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:31.500
So the moral of the story is,
v⋅A',

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:36.590
or v⋅A in
general is the flux or the flow,

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:40.570
off of any vector across an
area.

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:43.769
If it's a fluid that's flowing,
then v⋅A is

00:53:43.769 --> 00:53:45.449
the fluid flow past that area.
 

00:53:45.449 --> 00:53:48.510
If you need the dot product,
you need the cosine of the

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:51.458
angle, because the area,
if it's not perpendicular to

00:53:51.458 --> 00:53:53.159
the flow, it's not useful.
 

00:53:53.159 --> 00:53:55.858
In fact, you can take a huge
area parallel to the flow and

00:53:55.858 --> 00:53:57.090
nothing goes through it.
 

00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:00.442
So area is most effective if
the plane of the area is normal

00:54:00.442 --> 00:54:02.885
to the fluid,
or the area vector is parallel

00:54:02.885 --> 00:54:04.760
to the velocity of the fluid.
 

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.570
So that's that lesson.
 

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.940
Okay, this had nothing to do
with the electric field,

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.309
but we're going to come to the
electric field now.

00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:15.000
This is just a warm up.
 

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Let's come to the electric
field and see what's going on.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:32.668
So I take a charge q and
I draw the lines coming out of

00:54:32.668 --> 00:54:33.789
it.
 

00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:43.030
How many lines do I get
crossing a sphere S?

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.443
Well, we know that we have
agreed to draw

00:54:45.443 --> 00:54:48.159
1/ε_0 lines
per coulomb,

00:54:48.159 --> 00:54:54.202
so this q here,
that many lines cross the

00:54:54.202 --> 00:54:55.360
sphere.
 

00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:00.126
I'm now going to relate it to
something I can do with the

00:55:00.126 --> 00:55:02.510
electric field as follows.
 

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:09.396
I'm going to say that if I go
to that sphere,

00:55:09.396 --> 00:55:14.250
I look at the electric field.
 

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:19.639
Electric field is in that
direction, E.

00:55:19.639 --> 00:55:22.554
And any portion of the
sphere--and I want this is where

00:55:22.554 --> 00:55:25.416
you got to __________
imagine--take a tiny part of the

00:55:25.416 --> 00:55:26.010
sphere.
 

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:31.969
There's a tiny area that's got
a size dA.

00:55:31.969 --> 00:55:35.949
What is its direction?
 

00:55:35.949 --> 00:55:39.769
Direction of the area vector is
radial.

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:40.460
You understand?
 

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.132
The area is on the surface and
normal to that is the radial

00:55:44.132 --> 00:55:47.679
vector, which I always denote by
e_r.

00:55:47.679 --> 00:55:54.726
The electric field is equal to
q/4Πε

00:55:54.726 --> 00:55:59.257
_0(1/
r^(2))e

00:55:59.257 --> 00:56:01.900
_r.
 

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.077
Therefore
E⋅dA =

00:56:06.077 --> 00:56:10.661
q/4Πε
_0(1/

00:56:10.661 --> 00:56:14.226
r^(2))dAe
_r

00:56:14.226 --> 00:56:17.590
⋅e_r.
 

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.226
This is a dot product of the
area vector with the electric

00:56:20.226 --> 00:56:20.920
field vector.
 

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.849
The two unit vectors are
parallel.

00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:29.260
The dot product of that guy
with itself is just 1.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.840
So this is the number of lines
crossing the tiny area,

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:36.489
because electric field
numerically is equal to the line

00:56:36.489 --> 00:56:37.300
density.
 

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.186
So those lines crossing this
area, this is the number of

00:56:40.186 --> 00:56:42.443
lines crossing that patch,
which is given by

00:56:42.443 --> 00:56:44.280
E⋅dA.
 

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:49.826
If you add up all the lines,
you must add up all the

00:56:49.826 --> 00:56:51.239
dAs.
 

00:56:51.239 --> 00:56:55.740
Sum of all the dAs on a
sphere of radius r is

00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:00.552
just q/4Πε
_0r^(2) times sum

00:57:00.552 --> 00:57:03.579
of all the dAs on a
sphere,

00:57:03.579 --> 00:57:06.670
that is just 4Πr^(2) .
 

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:10.773
So you get
q/ε

00:57:10.773 --> 00:57:13.289
_0.
 

00:57:13.289 --> 00:57:16.067
In other words,
either you can draw the picture

00:57:16.067 --> 00:57:19.447
and it's immediately obvious to
you the lines crossing is

00:57:19.447 --> 00:57:21.862
q/ε
_0 by

00:57:21.862 --> 00:57:24.400
construction,
or you can remember, "Hey,

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.416
the electric field is a direct
measure of the number of lines

00:57:27.416 --> 00:57:29.831
per unit area,"
and the electric field times

00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:32.748
area times the cosine of the
angle between the area and the

00:57:32.748 --> 00:57:36.170
electric field will count the
lines going through a tiny area.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.534
If I add them all up,
I'd better get

00:57:38.534 --> 00:57:41.103
q/ε
_0,

00:57:41.103 --> 00:57:42.590
and indeed you do.
 

00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:45.369
So the moral of this little
exercise is that

00:57:45.369 --> 00:57:48.422
the surface integral,
let's call it the surface

00:57:48.422 --> 00:57:54.429
integral of the electric field,
on a surface is equal to

00:57:54.429 --> 00:58:02.554
q/ε
_0 where this was

00:58:02.554 --> 00:58:04.429
a sphere.
 

00:58:04.429 --> 00:58:06.483
In other words,
even if you've never heard of

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.864
field lines, just take the
electric field and do the

00:58:08.864 --> 00:58:10.500
surface integral,
you get this.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.170
So surface integral is a new
concept.

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:16.099
You probably have not done that
before and I've got to remind

00:58:16.099 --> 00:58:18.250
you how it is done at least
operationally.

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:21.253
If you've got a computer,
you can find the surface

00:58:21.253 --> 00:58:23.340
integral of anything as follows.
 

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:27.070
Take the surface over which
you're doing an integration.

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:31.581
Divide it into tiny pieces,
each is a little area

00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:32.710
dA.
 

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:35.561
Take the dot product of the
dA with the electric

00:58:35.561 --> 00:58:38.940
field there, and sum over all
the patches covering the sphere.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.739
Then take the limit in which
every patch gets vanishingly

00:58:41.739 --> 00:58:42.139
small.
 

00:58:42.139 --> 00:58:44.827
That is called the surface
integral of the electric field

00:58:44.827 --> 00:58:48.436
and we see that if you do that,
you get the charge inside

00:58:48.436 --> 00:58:51.679
divided by
ε_0.

00:58:51.679 --> 00:58:54.400
But that was on a sphere,
and the interesting thing was,

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.219
the answer was independent of
the radius of the sphere,

00:58:57.219 --> 00:59:01.070
because the 1/r^(2) in
the field canceled the

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.110
r^(2) in the area.
 

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:05.503
But it is even better than
that, because it's clear to you

00:59:05.503 --> 00:59:07.561
know,
without any calculation,

00:59:07.561 --> 00:59:10.860
that if I took some crazy
surface like this,

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:14.869
the lines crossing that is also
the same.

00:59:14.869 --> 00:59:17.576
Because the lines leave the
origin, they go radially

00:59:17.576 --> 00:59:18.159
outwards.
 

00:59:18.159 --> 00:59:19.768
They don't terminate on
anything.

00:59:19.768 --> 00:59:22.130
They're only supposed to
terminate on other charges,

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.400
therefore you can count them
anywhere you like.

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.494
You can take a census here,
you can take a census there or

00:59:27.494 --> 00:59:27.929
there.
 

00:59:27.929 --> 00:59:30.949
You're always going to get the
same number of lines.

00:59:30.949 --> 00:59:33.911
Therefore
q/ε_0

00:59:33.911 --> 00:59:38.931
 is also going to be
equal to the line count on some

00:59:38.931 --> 00:59:42.139
weird surface enclosing the
charge.

00:59:42.139 --> 00:59:45.480
So how am I going to count the
lines on a weird surface?

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.190
I take the surface,
divide it into little pieces,

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:53.103
but now the area vector and the
electric field vector may not be

00:59:53.103 --> 00:59:55.710
parallel,
because it's not a sphere.

00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:58.777
But it is still true that if
you're trying to count the lines

00:59:58.777 --> 01:00:00.820
going through,
just like in the velocity,

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.018
you must take the dot product
of these.

01:00:03.018 --> 01:00:07.489
Therefore you will again find
E⋅dA

01:00:07.489 --> 01:00:11.632
for any surface,
any closed surface,

01:00:11.632 --> 01:00:17.038
is equal to
q/ε_0

01:00:17.038 --> 01:00:19.030
.
 

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.518
If you got lost in the
mathematics, the physical

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:22.789
picture is very clear.
 

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:25.369
If you want to count how many
lines leave the charge,

01:00:25.369 --> 01:00:27.750
you can surround it with any
surface you like.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.157
If it's a sphere,
it's very easy for you to do

01:00:30.157 --> 01:00:30.800
the check.
 

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.460
If it's a crazy surface,
it's harder but they all come

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.119
from the fact that
E⋅dA,

01:00:36.119 --> 01:00:41.289
count the number of lines and
that's independent of the

01:00:41.289 --> 01:00:43.110
surface at stake.
 

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:49.123
So now that it what is called
Gauss's law, so I'm going to

01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:51.340
write it down here.
 

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.030
What I've shown you is the
following.

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:58.628
Here is some strange closed
surface that's a charge q

01:00:58.628 --> 01:00:59.329
inside.
 

01:00:59.329 --> 01:01:07.224
Then E⋅dA
on that surface is equal to

01:01:07.224 --> 01:01:12.954
q_inside
/ε

01:01:12.954 --> 01:01:15.630
_0.
 

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:21.766
This is not yet the theorem,
but this is the case for 1

01:01:21.766 --> 01:01:22.789
charge.
 

01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:29.590
If the charge were outside,
suppose the charge were here,

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:33.876
then the lines would go like
this, and the total number

01:01:33.876 --> 01:01:37.210
leaving the surface would
actually be 0.

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:38.090
You might say,
"How is that?

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:40.097
I see all these lines
penetrating the surface,"

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:42.697
but you've got to remember,
if you take an area vector

01:01:42.697 --> 01:01:45.369
here, with the definition for a
closed surface,

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:49.739
the area vector is the outward
pointing normal.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:52.460
For a closed surface,
every area is a vector pointing

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.030
out from the closed surface.
 

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:57.389
Then you can see that in this
surface, lines are coming out;

01:01:57.389 --> 01:02:00.489
on this surface,
lines are going in.

01:02:00.489 --> 01:02:02.751
It's very clear what's going in
is coming out,

01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:04.409
because nothing is terminating.
 

01:02:04.409 --> 01:02:07.989
Therefore if you took a surface
that did not enclose the charge,

01:02:07.989 --> 01:02:10.630
this answer would be 0,
but if it enclosed the charge,

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:14.802
it will be the charge inside,
but it won't matter where it

01:02:14.802 --> 01:02:15.170
is.
 

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:18.829
You can also see that you can
move this charge around anywhere

01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:22.429
you like, you don't change the
number of lines coming out.

01:02:22.429 --> 01:02:26.164
Then the most important
generalization is,

01:02:26.164 --> 01:02:29.809
if instead of 1 charge,
I have 2 charges,

01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:31.539
what do you do?
 

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:36.025
If you had 2 charges,
let us take the total

01:02:36.025 --> 01:02:40.940
E⋅dA
on a surface.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:45.181
The total electric field is the
electric field due to the first

01:02:45.181 --> 01:02:48.559
charge on that surface,
the electric field due to the

01:02:48.559 --> 01:02:52.699
second charge on the surface,
thanks to superposition.

01:02:52.699 --> 01:02:57.239
It's the fact that the electric
field is additive over charges.

01:02:57.239 --> 01:02:59.099
But this one is
q_1

01:02:59.099 --> 01:03:01.320
/ε
_0.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.880
This is q_2
/ε

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.530
_0.
 

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:10.139
Therefore, we can now write,
generalizing to any number,

01:03:10.139 --> 01:03:13.487
whether one draws a double
integral with this thing,

01:03:13.487 --> 01:03:15.719
meaning it's a closed surface.
 

01:03:15.719 --> 01:03:18.202
You can also have an open
surface, take the skin off an

01:03:18.202 --> 01:03:19.489
orange and cut it in half.
 

01:03:19.489 --> 01:03:24.353
That hemispherical skin is also
a surface, but to signify it's a

01:03:24.353 --> 01:03:27.210
closed surface,
we do it like this.

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:32.014
On a closed surface of
E⋅dA =

01:03:32.014 --> 01:03:35.572
q_enclosed
/ε

01:03:35.572 --> 01:03:41.565
_0,
which means sum of all the

01:03:41.565 --> 01:03:43.429
q's.
 

01:03:43.429 --> 01:03:46.599
And sometimes we write this as
follows.

01:03:46.599 --> 01:03:50.811
Suppose inside you don't have a
discrete set of charges that you

01:03:50.811 --> 01:03:53.599
can count,
but a continuous blob of

01:03:53.599 --> 01:03:57.360
charge, and the charge has a
certain density,

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:05.849
ρ is the charge density.
 

01:04:05.849 --> 01:04:08.219
What is the
q_enclosed?

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:14.923
I claim the answer is due to a
volume integral of ρ

01:04:14.923 --> 01:04:22.373
or any point r inside,
times dxdydz inside that

01:04:22.373 --> 01:04:23.739
volume.
 

01:04:23.739 --> 01:04:27.409
You know, if you want to say
how many coulombs are there,

01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:30.360
well divide the volume into
tiny cubes of size

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.539
dxdydz.
 

01:04:31.539 --> 01:04:32.789
That times the ρ
of r,

01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:33.764
meaning ρ
at x,

01:04:33.764 --> 01:04:35.989
y and z,
is the charge inside the cube.

01:04:35.989 --> 01:04:43.003
You add it all up,
you get the charge enclosed in

01:04:43.003 --> 01:04:46.949
that funny shaped object.
 

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:55.237
So this is the final form of
Gauss's law that we're going to

01:04:55.237 --> 01:04:56.079
use.
 

01:04:56.079 --> 01:04:57.889
I'm going to use the symbol,
which is very useful.

01:04:57.889 --> 01:05:15.369
 
 

01:05:15.369 --> 01:05:17.309
This is the theorem of Gauss.
 

01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:18.599
And S = DV.
 

01:05:18.599 --> 01:05:24.260
DV is the boundary of V.
 

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:27.309
In other words,
V is like a potato,

01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:30.090
the skin of the potato is DV.
 

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:32.969
Therefore if the potato is full
of charge,

01:05:32.969 --> 01:05:35.994
it will emit some electric flux
and the surface integral

01:05:35.994 --> 01:05:38.965
electric flux over the skin of
the potato is the charge

01:05:38.965 --> 01:05:40.230
enclosed inside it.
 

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:43.181
The charge enclosed inside it
is not simply some constant

01:05:43.181 --> 01:05:45.764
density times volume,
if the charge density varies

01:05:45.764 --> 01:05:47.030
from point to point.
 

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:50.139
In each neighborhood inside
their volume,

01:05:50.139 --> 01:05:53.519
you take a tiny section,
a tiny little cube of size

01:05:53.519 --> 01:05:55.565
dxdydz,
see how much is in there,

01:05:55.565 --> 01:05:58.588
as the function of x,
y and z,

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:02.219
and you do the integral over
the volume.

01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:05.641
Now these integrals may be hard
to do, but you should know at

01:06:05.641 --> 01:06:07.010
least what I'm saying.
 

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:11.418
This is just a way of counting
the total charge inside a volume

01:06:11.418 --> 01:06:14.690
when the charge is continuously
distributed.

01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:18.626
So I'm going to show you one
application of this and we'll

01:06:18.626 --> 01:06:20.699
come back to more next time.
 

01:06:20.699 --> 01:06:29.159
And the one application I'm
going to show you is to find the

01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:37.619
electric field due to a solid
ball, solid ball of charge.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:41.550
So I'm going to use Gauss's
theorem to do that.

01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:45.159
This is true for any surface
you pick.

01:06:45.159 --> 01:06:47.170
It doesn't matter what surface
you pick.

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:51.204
So if I want to find the
electric field here,

01:06:51.204 --> 01:06:56.340
I'm going to pick a surface of
radius little r.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:01.719
Let the sphere have a radius
big R.

01:07:01.719 --> 01:07:07.789
I want to find the field here
and I'm going to use Gauss's

01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:08.429
law.
 

01:07:08.429 --> 01:07:11.974
So on the left hand side and
the right hand side are two

01:07:11.974 --> 01:07:13.199
different things.
 

01:07:13.199 --> 01:07:17.559
On the right hand side,
what is the charge enclosed?

01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:19.349
That region.
 

01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:24.139
Well, the charge enclosed is
just some number q.

01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:27.949
This whole thing is q,
q spread over a sphere

01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:29.460
of radius r,
over

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.630
ε_0.
 

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:38.914
That's going to be the surface
integral of the electric field

01:07:38.914 --> 01:07:40.980
on that sphere.
 

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:48.119
E⋅dA
on that sphere.

01:07:48.119 --> 01:07:52.431
Now normally,
if you knew the value of an

01:07:52.431 --> 01:07:58.146
integral over a region,
you cannot deduce anything but

01:07:58.146 --> 01:08:01.489
the integrand,
unless what?

01:08:01.489 --> 01:08:05.927
There's one exception where if
you know the integral of a

01:08:05.927 --> 01:08:09.019
function, you can find the
integrand.

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:10.409
You know when that might be?
 

01:08:10.409 --> 01:08:14.280
Here's a function.
 

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.204
I tell you its integral from
here to here,

01:08:16.204 --> 01:08:17.850
but I don't show you the
picture.

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:18.510
What's the integrand?
 

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:20.189
You don't know.
 

01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:23.260
But if I also tell you the
function is a constant,

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.895
and I tell you the integral,
and you know the width of this

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:29.340
region, you can find the
integrand.

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:33.786
So you're going to cook this up
so that this whole integral is a

01:08:33.786 --> 01:08:36.680
constant times the area of
integration.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:41.435
And we argue that if you've got
a spherical charge density,

01:08:41.435 --> 01:08:45.288
the electric field must be
radial everywhere.

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:47.777
You've not proven this,
but you argue that because it's

01:08:47.777 --> 01:08:50.448
the only distribution with lines
coming out everywhere,

01:08:50.448 --> 01:08:55.319
invariant under every possible
rotation of the sphere.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:59.385
Because if you rotate the
sphere, I won't know you rotated

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.880
it, so the field pattern cannot
look different.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.266
If the field pattern looked
different when you rotated it,

01:09:05.266 --> 01:09:07.613
then you have a problem because
the cause looks the same,

01:09:07.613 --> 01:09:09.079
but the effect looks different.
 

01:09:09.079 --> 01:09:10.500
That's not allowed.
 

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.774
The only allowed this is the
radially outgoing electric

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:14.260
field.
 

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:16.824
Therefore the electric field is
radial and also constant

01:09:16.824 --> 01:09:19.016
throughout the sphere,
because all points on the

01:09:19.016 --> 01:09:20.229
sphere are equivalent.
 

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:23.479
There's no reason why this is
any better than that.

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:25.680
The sphere looks the same for
all directions.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.317
Therefore this whole integral
is going to be 4Πr^(2)

01:09:30.317 --> 01:09:34.270
times the electric field at that
radius r,

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:39.033
because the area vector and the
electric field vector are both

01:09:39.033 --> 01:09:41.247
parallel,
so in this dot product,

01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:42.578
forget the dot product.
 

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:43.948
It's just E times
dA.

01:09:43.948 --> 01:09:45.738
There's no cosθ,
just 1.

01:09:45.738 --> 01:09:48.662
You can pull the E out
of the integral,

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:52.430
because E is constant in
magnitude on the sphere.

01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:54.655
And the integral of the
dA is just

01:09:54.655 --> 01:09:55.770
4Πr^(2).
 

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:59.152
Therefore you deduce
E(r) is

01:09:59.152 --> 01:10:03.359
q/4Πε
_0r^(2).

01:10:03.359 --> 01:10:04.630
It's a very profound result.
 

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:07.886
It looks very simple,
but it is true for not a point

01:10:07.886 --> 01:10:11.399
charge, but for the spherical
distribution of charge.

01:10:11.399 --> 01:10:15.953
That the field goes like that
of a point charge sitting at the

01:10:15.953 --> 01:10:19.090
origin, is a consequence of
Gauss's law.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:23.260
If the charge inside was not
uniform,

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.988
suppose it's a charge q,
but there's more stuff here,

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.891
less stuff here,
this theorem would still be

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:32.403
true up to this point,
but you can never deduce that

01:10:32.403 --> 01:10:34.729
E is a constant on a
sphere,

01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:37.020
because even though a sphere is
nice and symmetrical,

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.618
the charge distribution is not.
 

01:10:38.618 --> 01:10:40.720
It could be big here,
it could be small here.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.262
You know something about the
integral over a surface of a

01:10:44.262 --> 01:10:47.109
varying function,
then Gauss's law is no good,

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.060
not useful.
 

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.180
True, but not useful.
 

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:53.350
Gauss's law is useful only when
in a given problem,

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:55.948
there's only one number you
don't know.

01:10:55.948 --> 01:10:59.771
That number here happens to be,
what's the strength of E

01:10:59.771 --> 01:11:01.189
at a radius r?
 

01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:04.152
I know it's direction is
radial, I know it's magnitude is

01:11:04.152 --> 01:11:06.797
constant on the sphere by
symmetry, but what is the

01:11:06.797 --> 01:11:07.380
number?
 

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:10.889
You can trade that one number
for this one number on the left

01:11:10.889 --> 01:11:13.287
hand side,
q/ε_0,

01:11:13.287 --> 01:11:14.750
you can calculate it.
 

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:19.100
I'll come back and do more
examples for you guys next time.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:24.000

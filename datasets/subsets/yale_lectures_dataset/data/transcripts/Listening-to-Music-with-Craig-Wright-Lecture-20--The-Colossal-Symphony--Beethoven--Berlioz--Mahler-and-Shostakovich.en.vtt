00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.010
Prof: Okay. Good morning.
 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.364
You are the last people left
standing.

00:00:07.364 --> 00:00:08.090
Right?
 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.077
I can tell you at the beginning
of this semester which of these

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.390
lectures will have the lowest
attendance rate.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.810
And it's this one.
 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.430
And I'll tell you where it's
going to peak again--as we get

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.650
closer to the final exam.
 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.270
But you are the good folks.
 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.805
You're here.
 

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:22.680
You're sticking with it,
so good for you.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.368
If you can make it to section
tonight and tomorrow,

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:26.390
that's great too.
 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.140
What are we doing today?
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.675
Well, last time we left off
talking about opera in the

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:31.680
nineteenth century.
 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.050
And the session before that,
we were talking about the

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.420
development of the piano in the
nineteenth century.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.010
Today, what do we want to do?
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.230
We're going to talk about the
development of the symphony,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.130
specifically the symphony
orchestra,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.910
in the course of the nineteenth
century--

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.540
and it did undergo significant
changes,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.950
as we will see.
 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.850
What symphonies have we visited
here in our course?

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.865
Who can give me the name of a
symphony that we've studied?

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:01.289
Roger.
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.320
Student:
&gt;

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.591
Prof: Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony.

00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.549
We did a lot with that at the
very beginning of the class.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.140
Any other symphony?
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.459
Elizabeth.
 

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:09.218
Student: Beethoven's
Sixth.

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:12.069
Prof: Beethoven's Sixth,
which was the basis of the

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:13.019
Saybrook concert.
 

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:14.129
Any other symphonies?
 

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:16.078
Angela.
 

00:01:16.078 --> 00:01:17.069
Student: Beethoven's
Ninth.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:18.260
Prof: Beethoven's Ninth.
 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.110
Yes, we talked about that in an
early lecture.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.540
&gt;
 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.640
So we've done a lot of
Beethoven.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.709
We haven't--and Thaddeus.
 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:27.938
Student: The
"Surprise Symphony."

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:29.379
Prof: The "Surprise
Symphony."

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.599
Good.
 

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:30.674
The "Surprise
Symphony"

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:31.280
of Joseph Haydn.
 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.640
So we've done some Haydn.
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.690
Anything else?
 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.920
We haven't mentioned somebody I
thought you might mention.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.310
&gt;
 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.019
Student: Mozart.
 

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.827
Prof: Mozart.
 

00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:41.029
Okay.
 

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:42.160
Mozart's G Minor Symphony.
 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.569
So we've done Mozart,
Haydn, and Beethoven for the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.732
most part,
but there's a lot of symphonic

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.660
composition after these
individuals,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.558
extends into the early
twentieth century and that's

00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:53.530
what we're going to track today.
 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.422
So today's lecture will
generally be about the symphony

00:01:58.422 --> 00:02:00.959
from one M to the other M.
 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.790
You hear about the three B's in
music.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.159
Well, these are the two M's,
from Mozart to Gustav Mahler.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.360
Let's start with Mozart.
 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.657
Let's play just a little bit of
his "Eine kleine

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:12.292
Nachtmusik,"
"A Little Night

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:13.000
Music."
 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.120
It's a sort of divertimento,
evening music for

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.229
entertainment.
 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.520
Let's listen to a little bit
about it and then I'll say

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.030
something.
 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:49.340
&gt;
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.770
What can we say about that
music?

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.319
Well, we've talked a lot about
this before.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.599
It's very patterned.
 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.940
It's very symmetrical.
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.940
It's balanced.
 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.508
We have antecedent and
consequent phrases and they come

00:03:00.508 --> 00:03:02.460
in the music with the classical
period.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.479
What about the orchestra?
 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:08.125
Well, it's rather small in that
it's dominated principally by

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:09.210
the strings.
 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.893
And we had a couple of
Listening Exercises where we'd

00:03:11.893 --> 00:03:14.937
see the strings play the themes
and then the woodwinds maybe

00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:17.258
come back to echo them or to
answer them.

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:20.439
But most of the musical
material is getting presented by

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.250
the strings.
 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.336
The texture--well,
the texture is rather thin here

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:30.008
because it's not a very big
orchestra, a thin texture.

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.910
And what can we say also about
the texture?

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.997
Well, it tends to be rather
polyphonic, homophonic or

00:03:36.997 --> 00:03:38.020
monophonic?
 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.199
Well, in that case, homophonic.
 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.160
Basically, you got a melody
plus accompaniment.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.163
And we could also
say--something that we've talked

00:03:47.163 --> 00:03:50.720
about--that this music has a
kind of rhetorical strategy to

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.150
it.
 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.810
We have this idea of music.
 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.930
It sounds like a melody,
it sounds like a theme,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.720
or music that sounds like it's
coming between themes,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.818
of leading us somewhere,
transitional music,

00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:03.469
music that may be a contrasting
theme,

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.908
music that ends a section.
 

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:09.183
So it's music that does
something, music that's trying

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:12.830
to get us from point A to point
B and point C and so on,

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.710
so it's a sort of rhetorical
music,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.350
teleological music if you will.
 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.360
Okay.
 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.670
Now, let's turn to a piece of
romantic music.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.764
And before we do that I'm going
to say a thing or two about this

00:04:28.764 --> 00:04:29.870
romantic music.
 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.531
It's a piece by Tchaikovsky
from his Romeo and

00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:36.125
Juliet,
and I think we have the titles

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.925
of the pieces that we'll be
listening to on the board up

00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:40.833
there today--
so from his Romeo and

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:41.379
Juliet.
 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.870
And you've probably heard this
music before because it used to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.790
be--a lot of it used to be used
in cartoon music.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.851
Anytime there was a love scene
this particular music would come

00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:52.180
on.
 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.019
So what are its qualities here?
 

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:56.896
Well, first of all,
it has a long,

00:04:56.896 --> 00:05:00.211
sweeping melody here in
romantic music,

00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:05.879
a long, sweeping melody that is
rather asymmetrical in shape.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.271
Instead of having neat units of
two plus two plus two,

00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:12.661
it could go on over bars or
maybe it'll be a seven-bar

00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:14.709
phrase, something like that.
 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:17.560
So the melodies tend to be long;
they tend to be asymmetrical.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.401
Rhythm--think about rhythm in
the music that we've been

00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:22.470
listening to.
 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.411
My paradigm here is the
beginning of the Brandenburg

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:34.470
Fifth Concerto Grosso,
in which the rhythm starts out

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.500
&gt;.
 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.610
It's very regular.
 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.428
It's like a machine gun,
almost, or a sewing machine,

00:05:41.428 --> 00:05:43.759
or some kind of repetitive
process there.

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:49.848
When we get into the classical
period, rhythm is somewhat more

00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:55.639
relaxed but it is still a
pattern, &gt;

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.040
but here, with this music in
the romantic period,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.439
the themes are not only long
and asymmetrical;

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.831
the rhythms don't seem to shake
out in patterns that allow us to

00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.180
tap our feet or allow us to
conduct it easily.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.740
So we have ties over bars.
 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.829
We have lots of syncopation.
 

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:18.697
We have irregular phrasing,
somewhat irregular metrical

00:06:18.697 --> 00:06:20.410
patterns as well.
 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.714
Tempo--we've talked a little
bit about this before and this

00:06:23.714 --> 00:06:25.709
idea of tempo rubato
here.

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:28.494
In romantic music,
we get wild swings of tempo in

00:06:28.494 --> 00:06:32.379
that it can be coming along at a
regular pace and then slow way,

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.413
way down and then speed up to
get back on track and slow down

00:06:35.413 --> 00:06:36.019
and so on.
 

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:41.245
And this is part and parcel of
the romantic aesthetic in the

00:06:41.245 --> 00:06:46.028
sense that it tends to swing
wildly from one extreme to

00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:49.600
another,
wildly in terms of rhythm and

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.019
wildly in terms of dynamics.
 

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:54.281
We can go from very,
very quiet to very,

00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.720
very loud in a way that Mozart
couldn't.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.139
Remember we were talking about
Mozart's piano,

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.204
which weighed about one tenth
of what this piano weighs up

00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:02.689
here.
 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.740
This piano probably weighs
about eight hundred pounds.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.769
Mozart's probably weighed about
one hundred pounds.

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:09.399
So this is a much bigger
instrument.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:12.250
You can play very quietly on it
or you can make a huge sound on

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.310
it;
same thing with the orchestra

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.899
and we'll come back to that
point today.

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:18.709
Mozart had a modest orchestra.
 

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:21.500
Mahler at the end of this
period had a huge orchestra.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.399
So this allows for these wild
swings.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:27.646
The romantic period is sort of
a bipolar period,

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:30.478
I guess, in terms of music in
that regard.

00:07:30.478 --> 00:07:31.100
Okay.
 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.303
Having said that,
let's listen to what we might

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:37.788
call a prototypical moment in
romantic music out of

00:07:37.788 --> 00:07:41.550
Tchaikovsky's overture to
Romeo and Juliet.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:08:04.470
&gt;
 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.637
Now it starts to build,
a little bit of melodic

00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:16.040
sequence working up here,
&gt;

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.500
reaching higher and higher each
time.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:52.928
&gt;
 

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:55.029
So it's a really remarkable
passage.

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:58.424
It's made possible by this
newly enlarged orchestra so

00:08:58.424 --> 00:09:01.500
let's talk about this orchestra
for a moment,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.385
and we're going to reference
here our four "food

00:09:04.385 --> 00:09:07.440
types" or our four
instrumental groups for the--

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.548
for classical art music,
starting with the strings.

00:09:11.548 --> 00:09:14.950
We don't really have any new
instruments here in the romantic

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:15.460
period.
 

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.101
We still have basically the
four string instruments of

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:21.573
violin, viola,
cello and double bass,

00:09:21.573 --> 00:09:23.428
but they are different.
 

00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:26.288
They're different from the
instrument that Mozart was

00:09:26.288 --> 00:09:26.840
playing.
 

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.649
What happened?
 

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:30.629
Well, in the nineteenth century
the construction of the violin

00:09:30.629 --> 00:09:32.389
was changed rather
significantly,

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:35.509
and I think I could just hold
my hand out here,

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:37.070
maybe demonstrate this kind of
thing.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.958
First of all,
there was a higher bridge put

00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:41.700
on it.
 

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.144
If you have the bridge holding
up the strings in an

00:09:44.144 --> 00:09:46.639
eighteenth-century violin it
might be like that--

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.059
a nineteenth-century violin
like that,

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:49.080
higher bridge.
 

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.120
That allows you to have more
tension.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.246
It puts more tension on the
entire instrument and at the

00:09:58.246 --> 00:10:02.153
same time,
the strings that had been used,

00:10:02.153 --> 00:10:05.227
which were made of--
anybody have a sense of what

00:10:05.227 --> 00:10:07.679
violin strings in the eighteenth
century were made of?

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:10.000
Chelsea.
 

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.120
Student: Catgut.
 

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.669
Prof: Catgut sometimes,
yes.

00:10:12.669 --> 00:10:14.419
Yes, animal lovers, catgut.
 

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:16.678
More normally sheep gut. Okay?
 

00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:20.417
So sheep gut,
and that wouldn't--the tension

00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:25.283
that could be put on that was
not as great as if you were

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:27.370
using a wire string.
 

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.931
So in the nineteenth century,
technological advances,

00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:32.711
wire strings,
more tension,

00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:34.559
higher bridge,
and to--well,

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:37.298
also the fingerboard was
extended.

00:10:37.298 --> 00:10:40.254
It's longer so oftentimes with
a Stradivarius they'd chop off

00:10:40.254 --> 00:10:41.980
the fingerboard and put
another--

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.320
a new fingerboard on it and put
it all back together again.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.000
What else?
 

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.080
I know I'm missing one other
important thing.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.340
Well, maybe that will have to
do it for the moment,

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.577
and what we'll end up with--oh,
I know.

00:10:59.577 --> 00:11:00.600
The bow.
 

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.567
If you look at an
eighteenth-century bow and go to

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:04.977
our collection of historical
musical instruments on Hillhouse

00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:07.070
Avenue,
the amount of horsehair there

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.070
is rather narrow.
 

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.679
It's almost double when you get
to the nineteenth-century bow.

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:12.740
So the bow is bigger.
 

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.399
So the whole thing is more
powerful,

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:16.769
and I've asked Jacob just to
bring in his viola,

00:11:16.769 --> 00:11:20.278
which is fundamentally a
nineteenth-century viola in

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:22.567
construction,
and just rip through a couple

00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:24.365
of things,
just to give you a sense of the

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:25.460
volume of the instrument.
 

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.610
 
 

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.100
Play anything.
 

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:46.158
&gt;
 

00:11:46.158 --> 00:11:46.412
Okay.
 

00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:49.140
So that's all I wanted him to
do but just to give you a

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.908
sense--that's a big,
rich sound.

00:11:50.908 --> 00:11:52.994
Play a couple of--can you play
a couple of chords like maybe

00:11:52.994 --> 00:11:55.043
the ending of something with
double- and triple-stops--with

00:11:55.043 --> 00:11:55.610
much volume?
 

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:06.200
&gt;
 

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.514
Okay.
 

00:12:06.514 --> 00:12:09.293
So big, powerful
nineteenth-century violin as

00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:12.200
opposed to the smaller one that
Mozart had.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.830
Let's talk about the woodwinds.
 

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.447
Here in this family,
new instruments were

00:12:16.447 --> 00:12:17.298
introduced.
 

00:12:17.298 --> 00:12:19.241
First of all,
we have the piccolo up at the

00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:19.519
top.
 

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.250
We've heard the piccolo before.
 

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.476
Remember in the storm scene of
the "Pastoral

00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:27.567
Symphony,"
number six, the Beethoven storm

00:12:27.567 --> 00:12:28.240
scene.
 

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.871
If you wanted to get a sense of
the whistling wind up there,

00:12:30.871 --> 00:12:31.808
that's what he did.
 

00:12:31.808 --> 00:12:33.590
He had the piccolo play way,
way up high.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.840
Then you could hear it.
 

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.220
It just kind of gave that
effect.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.470
At the other end there of the
extreme we have the double--

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.860
the contra--or double bassoon
being added,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.389
the low bassoon playing down an
octave lower than--

00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:48.486
is that correct,
Lynda, playing down an octave

00:12:48.486 --> 00:12:49.700
or even lower than that?
 

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.542
Lynda: Oh,
maybe about that.

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:52.408
It's enormous.
 

00:12:52.408 --> 00:12:54.830
Prof: It's enormous,
and actually I think the

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.868
bassoon--the contrabassoon plays
lower than any instrument in the

00:12:57.868 --> 00:12:59.674
orchestra--
is that correct--in terms of

00:12:59.674 --> 00:13:00.379
actual frequency.
 

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:04.205
So it's adding to both the high
and the low range of the

00:13:04.205 --> 00:13:06.985
woodwind family,
and a new instrument was

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:08.028
introduced.
 

00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:10.322
Actually, it had been around in
certain quarters,

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:12.231
a new instrument called the
English horn,

00:13:12.231 --> 00:13:15.048
and I think we have that up
there on our list of terms.

00:13:15.048 --> 00:13:18.951
Is the English horn from
England and is it a horn?

00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:19.350
No.
 

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.604
It's actually from France and
Germany and it's a woodwind

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:23.360
instrument.
 

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.139
It's not a brass instrument at
all.

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:28.500
It's kind of a low or tenor
oboe.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.005
So it's a kind of oboe in a
tenor range but it has a

00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:36.269
beautiful, rich quality to it,
a somewhat nostalgic quality.

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:39.760
Arguably, the most famous
English horn passage is the one

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.249
that you're about to hear,
which comes from the slow

00:13:43.249 --> 00:13:46.607
movement of Dvorak's "New
World Symphony"

00:13:46.607 --> 00:13:48.302
which,
as you might suspect,

00:13:48.302 --> 00:13:50.250
was written here in the United
States,

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.509
actually, in Spillville,
Iowa--in New York City and in

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:54.678
Spillville, Iowa.
 

00:13:54.678 --> 00:13:57.485
So here's a little bit of the
English horn solo out of the

00:13:57.485 --> 00:13:59.110
"New World Symphony."
 

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:59.029
&gt;
 

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:00.519
It's lovely, lovely, lovely.
 

00:15:00.519 --> 00:15:02.080
It's funny about music,
what it can do for you.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.995
My mother's family was actually
from Iowa, a farm family from

00:15:05.995 --> 00:15:09.062
Iowa, and as a child they took
me to Spillville,

00:15:09.062 --> 00:15:09.649
Iowa.
 

00:15:09.649 --> 00:15:11.754
"Get in the car;
we're going to get culture this

00:15:11.754 --> 00:15:12.240
afternoon.
 

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.340
No more softball games.
 

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.370
We're going for culture."
 

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.052
So I went to Spillville,
and I can't hear that music

00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:19.682
without thinking of that
particular family or those

00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:21.259
particular people in Iowa.
 

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:21.864
It's weird.
 

00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:25.052
It's kind of--as we've said
before, music provides an entry

00:15:25.052 --> 00:15:27.798
to the inner recesses of your
memory sometimes.

00:15:27.798 --> 00:15:30.270
In any event,
aside from that discursus,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.058
let us continue now with the
brass family.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.701
We--what were the two
instruments in the orchestra

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:38.827
that we have encountered up to
this point in terms of brass

00:15:38.827 --> 00:15:39.690
instruments?
 

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.250
What have we heard in a
symphony?

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.298
Elizabeth.
 

00:15:43.298 --> 00:15:44.330
Student: The trumpet and
the trombone.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.038
Prof: The trumpet and
the trombone.

00:15:46.038 --> 00:15:48.320
Okay, fair enough,
trumpet and trombone.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.087
There's one other important one
that actually was in the

00:15:51.087 --> 00:15:52.700
orchestra before the trombone.
 

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.710
Chris.
 

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:54.389
Student: The French horn.
 

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:56.777
Prof: The French horn,
and in point in fact the

00:15:56.777 --> 00:15:58.850
trumpet and French horn were in
there first.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.648
Then Beethoven,
with the Fifth Symphony brings

00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:03.976
in the trombone,
but it's not until the

00:16:03.976 --> 00:16:06.740
nineteenth century that the
trombone gets added to the

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.419
orchestra.
 

00:16:07.419 --> 00:16:09.330
Where does Beethoven do so?
 

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:14.447
Well, he does it in the finale
of his Fifth Symphony when he

00:16:14.447 --> 00:16:19.825
wants this particularly powerful
brass sound so let's listen to

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:24.682
the opening of the finale of the
Fifth Symphony where the

00:16:24.682 --> 00:16:30.061
trombones are brought into the
orchestra for the first time for

00:16:30.061 --> 00:16:32.750
this particular effect.
 

00:16:32.750 --> 00:17:04.849
&gt;
 

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.980
Okay. Here we go.
 

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:25.848
&gt;
 

00:17:25.848 --> 00:17:28.980
So that's how Beethoven gets
his kind of heroic effect.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.638
He's doing three things there
in the finale:

00:17:31.638 --> 00:17:34.854
One, switching from minor
&gt;

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:36.709
to &gt;
 

00:17:36.709 --> 00:17:37.390
major.
 

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.588
He has--it's a very triadic
theme and he's bringing in the

00:17:41.588 --> 00:17:44.868
heavy artillery,
the newly invented heavy

00:17:44.868 --> 00:17:47.544
artillery--
or at least newly introduced

00:17:47.544 --> 00:17:49.880
heavy artillery--
the trombone there.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.478
And it gives it this powerful,
if you will,

00:17:52.478 --> 00:17:55.199
in the vernacular,
sort of "ballsy"

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:56.868
effect with that brass.
 

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:59.798
And this got extended to the
low brass as well.

00:17:59.798 --> 00:18:02.807
The one family of the brasses
that we've talked about that we

00:18:02.807 --> 00:18:05.515
haven't really explained in
terms of the history of the

00:18:05.515 --> 00:18:07.068
orchestra is the tuba here.
 

00:18:07.068 --> 00:18:09.140
When does the tuba get
introduced?

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.138
Well, it gets introduced right
about this time,

00:18:12.138 --> 00:18:15.528
about eighteen twenty-five,
eighteen thirty or so.

00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:20.172
The first composer to use the
tuba in an orchestral piece was

00:18:20.172 --> 00:18:23.963
Hector Berlioz in the
Symphonie Fantastique

00:18:23.963 --> 00:18:28.528
that we're going to be embracing
in sections this week.

00:18:28.528 --> 00:18:32.261
So we have the tuba coming in
here, and actually it was,

00:18:32.261 --> 00:18:35.789
as you can see there,
originally an instrument called

00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:37.078
the ophicleide.
 

00:18:37.078 --> 00:18:41.176
It was a French instrument and
Berlioz heard this as a kind of

00:18:41.176 --> 00:18:44.940
giant keyed bugle in the
military bands of the period.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.259
Think of the French Revolution.
 

00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:49.154
Think of the Napoleonic wars,
all of these troops marching up

00:18:49.154 --> 00:18:50.987
and down with the brass bands
along the

00:18:50.987 --> 00:18:52.578
Champs-Elysées.
 

00:18:52.578 --> 00:18:53.465
He hears this.
 

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.823
He brings this military
instrument in to the symphonic

00:18:56.823 --> 00:19:00.558
orchestra to add depth to the
lower part of the brasses.

00:19:00.558 --> 00:19:04.380
Let's go back to our Dvorak
piece here,

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.115
the Dvorak "New World
Symphony,"

00:19:06.115 --> 00:19:09.666
second movement,
and here we can hear the power

00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:14.430
and the depth of the newly
enlarged brass section,

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:45.019
&gt;
 

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:48.593
way down there,
that low note played by the

00:19:48.593 --> 00:19:50.038
tuba and so on.
 

00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:55.358
So that's something of the
brass group as an ensemble.

00:19:55.358 --> 00:19:57.848
Let's think of these
instruments individually.

00:19:57.848 --> 00:20:00.808
If we look back at a symphony
by Mozart, not only is the

00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:03.500
orchestra stronger,
but how he is using these brass

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.328
instruments is very different.
 

00:20:05.328 --> 00:20:08.564
We looked at the French horn
before, and we're now going to

00:20:08.564 --> 00:20:10.068
focus on the French horn.
 

00:20:10.068 --> 00:20:11.278
In the very beginning of our
course,

00:20:11.278 --> 00:20:13.578
we had a professional French
hornist in here,

00:20:13.578 --> 00:20:16.148
Eva Heater, and she
played--does anybody remember

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:19.359
anything of interest about the
instrument that she played and

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:21.930
how it differed from the modern
French horn?

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.450
What didn't that instrument
have that the modern French horn

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.910
has?
 

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.338
Roger.
 

00:20:29.338 --> 00:20:30.390
Student:
&gt;

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.775
Prof: Keys.
 

00:20:31.775 --> 00:20:32.160
Okay.
 

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.930
Keys or valves,
yeah.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.099
That's it exactly:
keys or valves.

00:20:36.099 --> 00:20:38.088
That gets put on the instrument.
 

00:20:38.088 --> 00:20:41.551
Instead of sliding in these
crooks and changing the length

00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:44.250
of the pipe that way,
they figured a way of having

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.068
valves and you could do it
quickly and--

00:20:46.068 --> 00:20:48.190
with keys, but that's a
nineteenth-century invention.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.412
An eighteenth-century horn just
over-blew and it could play some

00:20:52.412 --> 00:20:54.960
things such as
&gt;

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.765
very easily,
repeated pitches,

00:20:56.765 --> 00:20:58.259
&gt;.
 

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:04.588
Remember our horn concerto of
Mozart or &gt;.

00:21:04.588 --> 00:21:07.048
It could over-blow up the
harmonic frequencies,

00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:11.269
up the partials as we said
before, with ease,

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:14.215
but it couldn't play chromatic
kinds of things and as a result

00:21:14.215 --> 00:21:17.066
it's kind of stuck there in the
background kind of providing

00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:20.108
what I like to think of as a
sonic glue for the orchestra,

00:21:20.108 --> 00:21:24.434
but it rarely plays any solos
in the orchestral fabric outside

00:21:24.434 --> 00:21:25.568
of a concerto.
 

00:21:25.568 --> 00:21:30.022
Well, let's see what happens to
the French horn inside of the

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:33.288
orchestra here in the nineteenth
century,

00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:37.156
where it begins to come forth
as a solo instrument because the

00:21:37.156 --> 00:21:40.644
melody it can play is so much
more complex and much more

00:21:40.644 --> 00:21:41.660
interesting.
 

00:21:41.660 --> 00:22:26.384
So here's a famous French horn
lick out of Brahms's First

00:22:26.384 --> 00:22:59.130
Symphony, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:12.730
and back to the horns
&gt;.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.960
Listen to the depth.
 

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.839
It's a lovely passage but it's
featuring the brasses and

00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:22.380
particularly the solo French
horn.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.634
I guess the thing also to
notice here is how slow the

00:23:25.634 --> 00:23:28.390
music is going--slowly the music
is going.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.410
It's all slowed down,
kind of going at a crawl here.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.559
And that's an interesting point
about the whole

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:39.671
nineteenth-century notion of
time and what they thought about

00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:44.069
time and the passage of time--
the early nineteenth century,

00:23:44.069 --> 00:23:48.067
the beginning of the discovery
of the whole discipline of

00:23:48.067 --> 00:23:52.064
paleontology and how old the
earth was and how many years

00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:54.920
civilization had existed and so
on.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.470
And it is all getting extended.
 

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.940
Instead of biblically,
five to seven thousand years,

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.118
now it's twenty-five million
years,

00:24:01.118 --> 00:24:04.038
which of course has been
greatly extended since then,

00:24:04.038 --> 00:24:06.690
but everything here is being
allowed to slow down.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.423
And by way of reference,
let's go back to our Mozart

00:24:10.423 --> 00:24:13.720
here and think about how he
constructed it.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:20.440
&gt;
 

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.528
Well, there we have,
again, the beginning of

00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:24.133
"Eine kleine
Nachtmusik"

00:24:24.133 --> 00:24:26.660
and he has a chordal pattern,
triadic, going up.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.932
That pattern lasts about four
seconds, if you

00:24:28.932 --> 00:24:30.118
&gt;
 

00:24:30.118 --> 00:24:33.436
two, three, four,
come down, one,

00:24:33.436 --> 00:24:38.308
two, three, four--four seconds
on each chord.

00:24:38.308 --> 00:24:41.744
He's moving through his
material rather quickly and

00:24:41.744 --> 00:24:43.670
we'll say why in a moment.
 

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:47.480
Now, by way of contrast,
let's go to music,

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.597
oh, sixty or so
later--years--or so later in the

00:24:50.597 --> 00:24:54.511
middle of the nineteenth century
and focus on an overture by

00:24:54.511 --> 00:24:57.107
Wagner here,
overture to The Flying

00:24:57.107 --> 00:25:00.227
Dutchman,
and we're going to listen to

00:25:00.227 --> 00:25:05.260
just the end of this and sort of
think about how long Wagner can

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.940
sit on each chord.
 

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.605
Mozart thought he could sit on
each chord here for about four

00:25:09.605 --> 00:25:10.048
seconds.
 

00:25:10.048 --> 00:25:12.029
How long does Wagner sit on a
chord?

00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:31.828
&gt;
 

00:25:31.828 --> 00:25:34.038
All one chord,
&gt;

00:25:34.038 --> 00:25:38.750
change, another chord,
&gt;

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.200
all one chord,
&gt;

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.297
just triadic notes of that one
chord, changes that to minor,

00:25:45.297 --> 00:25:48.839
just drops the third down,
same chord, &lt;&lt;music

00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:50.160
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:58.676
and now back to the original
chord, holding that one chord

00:25:58.676 --> 00:26:03.460
&gt;.
 

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.660
Where are we on the counter
there?

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.700
Lynda: Nine fifty-two.
 

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.340
Prof: Nine fifty-two,
so we had fifty-two seconds of

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:15.261
music there and we went through
three chords so we're averaging

00:26:15.261 --> 00:26:18.200
about eighteen seconds per
chord,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.846
something like that,
four or five times more than

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:23.289
Mozart was doing.
 

00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:25.220
How can Wagner do that?
 

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.038
What's the difference?
 

00:26:28.038 --> 00:26:31.390
Why did Mozart have to move
through his chords faster?

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.710
What's happening in this music?
 

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:41.461
Supposing you tried to play
that Wagner music with Mozart's

00:26:41.461 --> 00:26:42.859
orchestra.
 

00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:46.160
It wouldn't work.
 

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.720
Mozart had this dinky,
little orchestra.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.700
How many people were in
Mozart's orchestra?

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.950
Well, depends on where he was
at a given time.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.618
Haydn's first orchestra had
sixteen people in it.

00:26:55.618 --> 00:26:59.070
Mozart, when he gave a concert
in Vienna usually wanted about

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.509
thirty to thirty-three.
 

00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:04.078
We get to Beethoven,
we're up to fifty to sixty in a

00:27:04.078 --> 00:27:08.420
typical Beethovenian orchestra
in Vienna eighteen ten or so.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.616
As we move in to the later part
of the century,

00:27:10.616 --> 00:27:13.196
these orchestras keep adding
more and more instruments,

00:27:13.196 --> 00:27:14.440
more and more players.
 

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.584
You got to--well,
if we get--have all this brass

00:27:16.584 --> 00:27:19.458
we got to balance them with more
string players so we're getting

00:27:19.458 --> 00:27:23.289
up to eighty,
ninety, one hundred by the end

00:27:23.289 --> 00:27:29.009
of the nineteenth century so
this is an important point.

00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:33.176
Mozart had a very small
orchestra and as a result--or

00:27:33.176 --> 00:27:37.986
maybe he could get away with
what he had because he had great

00:27:37.986 --> 00:27:39.107
musical ideas.
 

00:27:39.107 --> 00:27:39.990
Right.
 

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.788
He had to have great musical
ideas because the sound itself

00:27:43.788 --> 00:27:45.690
wasn't going to rescue him.
 

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.450
With Wagner and these later
composers, they may not always

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.420
have to have the greatest of
musical ideas.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:57.569
The triad is not a particularly
novel musical idea,

00:27:57.569 --> 00:28:02.617
but he can get away with just
taking &lt;&lt;plays

00:28:02.617 --> 00:28:04.368
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:28:04.368 --> 00:28:08.650
--he can get away with doing
that and it sounds great.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.309
Everybody--didn't you like that
Wagner?

00:28:10.309 --> 00:28:12.259
Didn't that sound terrific?
 

00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:14.440
And it's just because he's got
this huge orchestra.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.769
Sound, per se,
is replacing musical idea.

00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:23.578
Mozart, terrific ideas;
Wagner, terrific orchestra,

00:28:23.578 --> 00:28:26.380
and he knew how to use it.
 

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:31.858
So a bigger orchestra allows
longer movements.

00:28:31.858 --> 00:28:35.178
I have said before I think that
it's axiomatic in music that the

00:28:35.178 --> 00:28:38.548
more people you have on a stage
or involved in a performance,

00:28:38.548 --> 00:28:41.578
the longer that performance is
going to take.

00:28:41.578 --> 00:28:45.792
And with regard to the
symphony, how long does a

00:28:45.792 --> 00:28:49.470
movement within a Mozart
symphony take?

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.535
If you were to look at the CDs
up here of a Mozart symphony,

00:28:52.535 --> 00:28:53.730
what would you guess?
 

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.443
First movement of Mozart's G
Minor Symphony:

00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:57.960
how long does that go?
 

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.269
Hm?
 

00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.950
Student: Seven.
 

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:01.546
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:29:01.546 --> 00:29:02.009
Who said that?
 

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:02.538
I can't--okay.
 

00:29:02.538 --> 00:29:05.025
Oscar says seven minutes,
yeah, and actually that's about

00:29:05.025 --> 00:29:06.490
right for the G Minor Symphony.
 

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.618
It's one of the shorter ones of
Mozart but let's say five to ten

00:29:09.618 --> 00:29:11.160
minutes, ten minutes outside.
 

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.346
If we get to Beethoven,
how long will a movement of

00:29:14.346 --> 00:29:15.430
Beethoven take?
 

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:19.515
Well, about twenty minutes
sometimes with his bigger

00:29:19.515 --> 00:29:22.640
symphonies like three,
five and nine.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.058
When we get to Mahler and
Bruckner,

00:29:26.058 --> 00:29:31.009
the length of the movements can
go on even more,

00:29:31.009 --> 00:29:33.903
and an entire symphony of
Mahler might go on for an hour

00:29:33.903 --> 00:29:35.700
and a half,
so these are bigger.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.574
The big orchestra has led to
longer symphonies and the sound

00:29:40.574 --> 00:29:44.210
obviously is very luxuriant,
very opulent.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.409
The sound in music probably
never gets any more opulent than

00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:52.108
it does here at the end of the
nineteenth century.

00:29:52.108 --> 00:29:57.227
Two other aspects involved here
having to do with the physical

00:29:57.227 --> 00:30:00.078
world and, in a way,
technology.

00:30:00.078 --> 00:30:03.056
Of course, the nineteenth
century is the period of the

00:30:03.056 --> 00:30:06.469
Industrial Revolution,
and some of these innovations,

00:30:06.469 --> 00:30:08.880
in terms of metallurgy and
design,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.118
got applied to musical
instruments.

00:30:11.118 --> 00:30:13.694
For example,
how many have ever played the

00:30:13.694 --> 00:30:14.700
flute in here?
 

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.940
Okay, a number of people--both
male and female--

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.872
and if you look--remember the
video we saw of a Baroque flute

00:30:21.872 --> 00:30:25.278
it actually had a very
rudimentary key pad on it,

00:30:25.278 --> 00:30:27.903
and you look at a modern flute
and it's got this keyed system

00:30:27.903 --> 00:30:31.172
with all these things up there,
all of the different keys and

00:30:31.172 --> 00:30:33.265
extenders,
and that's all an invention of

00:30:33.265 --> 00:30:34.348
the nineteenth century.
 

00:30:34.348 --> 00:30:38.203
They completely reconfigured
the flute and how you play it in

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:39.808
the nineteenth century.
 

00:30:39.808 --> 00:30:42.436
And we've talked about all
these other instruments that got

00:30:42.436 --> 00:30:42.798
added.
 

00:30:42.798 --> 00:30:45.839
So a kind of technological
revolution was applied to

00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:49.695
musical instruments too,
but the most interesting thing

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:53.440
is, when you got all these
instruments together,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.980
how much sound they could make.
 

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.823
Let's say you were in the--you
lived in the nineteenth century

00:30:59.823 --> 00:31:03.162
and you wanted to hear the
biggest sound that could be

00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:03.730
made.
 

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.269
What do you think you would do?
 

00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:07.890
Where would you hear the
loudest sound?

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:12.140
 
 

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.849
Jennifer.
 

00:31:14.849 --> 00:31:15.690
Student: Organ?
 

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:16.424
Prof: An organ.
 

00:31:16.424 --> 00:31:16.592
Okay.
 

00:31:16.592 --> 00:31:17.058
That's good.
 

00:31:17.058 --> 00:31:20.988
That's pretty good,
though it wouldn't have sounded

00:31:20.988 --> 00:31:24.915
as loud then as it does now
because now we're using

00:31:24.915 --> 00:31:28.630
something else I'll get to,
but that's a good start.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.049
Okay? Anything else?
 

00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:31.088
It doesn't have to be musical.
 

00:31:31.088 --> 00:31:35.450
What would give the biggest
sound?

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.680
Sarah.
 

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.700
Student:
&gt;

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.440
Prof: I beg your pardon.
 

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.900
Acoustics in music halls.
 

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.382
Yeah, we're going to come to
that, but just in the real

00:31:44.382 --> 00:31:44.750
world.
 

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.380
You're in the city of London.
 

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.279
What's going to annoy you the
most, make the biggest sound?

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:50.328
Roger.
 

00:31:50.328 --> 00:31:52.348
Student:
&gt;

00:31:52.348 --> 00:31:53.858
Prof: A big--possibly a
bell.

00:31:53.858 --> 00:31:56.230
Yeah, but that's back--we've
had those since the Middle Ages.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.732
I was thinking of two things:
cannons, okay,

00:31:59.732 --> 00:32:02.911
huge fire power there,
huge, loud sound,

00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:05.730
deafening roar;
and one other thing that came

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.094
in in the nineteenth century:
steam engines and all the

00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:10.813
things that it could produce--
trains, steam whistles,

00:32:10.813 --> 00:32:11.920
this kind of thing.
 

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.161
But the third thing really is
this orchestra when all of these

00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:18.348
new instruments are coming
together in such large numbers.

00:32:18.348 --> 00:32:21.721
And once you have them all
together you got to have a place

00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:25.037
to put them so they started
building new concert halls and

00:32:25.037 --> 00:32:28.118
concert halls are particularly
good acoustically.

00:32:28.118 --> 00:32:30.532
The model for this,
and I don't know if I put

00:32:30.532 --> 00:32:31.520
this--yes, we did.
 

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:31.960
Okay.
 

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.869
It's up there on the board.
 

00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:33.940
It's in Vienna.
 

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.804
It's called the
Musikverein and it's a

00:32:36.804 --> 00:32:39.279
famous hall and it's a
remarkable hall,

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:42.598
maybe the most perfect musical
hall ever built.

00:32:42.598 --> 00:32:45.848
That was the prototype,
and then other concert hall

00:32:45.848 --> 00:32:48.838
builders around the world began
to adopt it.

00:32:48.838 --> 00:32:51.220
We adopted it here in the
United States.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.384
Can anybody think of a concert
hall in the United States that

00:32:55.384 --> 00:32:59.270
is particularly famous and
acoustically beautiful outside

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.019
of Carnegie Hall that I'll talk
about in a moment?

00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:04.720
What other one?
 

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.031
There's one other one,
early concert hall in the

00:33:07.031 --> 00:33:07.819
United States.
 

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.410
Symphony Hall in Boston.
 

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:11.137
If you're ever in
Boston--anybody from

00:33:11.137 --> 00:33:12.119
Massachusetts here?
 

00:33:12.119 --> 00:33:13.589
Anybody been to Symphony Hall?
 

00:33:13.589 --> 00:33:14.690
Okay. Go in there.
 

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.190
It's a knockoff of the
Musikverein so if you

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.990
want to see what Vienna looks
like go to Symphony Hall in

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.538
Boston.
 

00:33:20.538 --> 00:33:25.960
There is another one that is
very close to us here that's

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.089
pretty close to the--this design
and where is that?

00:33:31.089 --> 00:33:33.210
Built about the same time.
 

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:37.569
Our own Woolsey Hall,
a big hall seating about

00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:40.380
twenty-five hundred people.
 

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.237
If you're ever in Woolsey,
notice the fundamentally

00:33:43.237 --> 00:33:44.779
rectangular design on it.
 

00:33:44.779 --> 00:33:46.720
Go in and look at the floor.
 

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.588
It has a suspended floor there.
 

00:33:49.588 --> 00:33:52.538
And it has a suspended floor
for a particular reason.

00:33:52.538 --> 00:33:56.135
That floor serves as a
resonator and there are other

00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:59.308
resonators around that we
needn't go into,

00:33:59.308 --> 00:34:01.916
but next time you're in Woolsey
go in and bounce because that's

00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:03.028
in--
on that floor.

00:34:03.028 --> 00:34:06.710
It's designed to have the sound
resonate more.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.090
Now, what's the problem with
Woolsey?

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:15.010
Why don't string quartets like
playing in Woolsey?

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.530
Hm?
 

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.219
Student:
&gt;

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:19.460
Prof: It's too booming.
 

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.400
Okay. It's too resonant.
 

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.360
But what was the model?
 

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.768
What the model is--you
get--Roger.

00:34:26.768 --> 00:34:27.760
Student:
&gt;

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.762
Prof: Well,
it was partly built for the

00:34:29.762 --> 00:34:30.119
organ.
 

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:33.088
Yes, it was built for the organ
but Woolsey Hall can sound

00:34:33.088 --> 00:34:35.639
absolutely marvelous for a
symphony orchestra--

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:38.010
not booming and not overly
resonant,

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.260
if what happens?
 

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.239
Robert.
 

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.369
Student:
&gt;

00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:46.000
Prof: If it's full of
people, because people absorb

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.369
sound.
 

00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:48.969
So all of the boomingness,
the long reverberation cycle,

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.070
gets sucked out of it into our
bodies--

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:54.128
as sound absorbers--and it
produces this absolutely

00:34:54.128 --> 00:34:57.739
spectacular symphonic sound so
that was the model and that's

00:34:57.739 --> 00:34:59.762
the--
and I was struck the other day

00:34:59.762 --> 00:35:01.039
when I went to Nashville.
 

00:35:01.039 --> 00:35:04.429
They've done a knockoff of the
Musikverein in Nashville

00:35:04.429 --> 00:35:07.320
in that Schermerhorn Symphony
Hall down there too.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.748
It's brazen but just take that
design from Vienna and put it

00:35:11.748 --> 00:35:16.329
right there in the middle of
Nashville--pretty interesting.

00:35:16.329 --> 00:35:16.630
Okay.
 

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:20.130
So that's another thing we have
to kind of keep track of.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.570
Carnegie Hall is a little bit
different in terms of its

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:25.309
design.
 

00:35:25.309 --> 00:35:26.083
All right.
 

00:35:26.083 --> 00:35:30.492
Now let's take a look at what I
call the main line here of

00:35:30.492 --> 00:35:33.916
symphonic composers--
and it's mostly a German

00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:36.262
tradition,
right, a German symphonic

00:35:36.262 --> 00:35:36.949
tradition.
 

00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:39.806
But that became the model for
the United States,

00:35:39.806 --> 00:35:42.360
and that's why they brought
Dvorak here;

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.396
Tchaikovsky came to the United
States and was involved in the

00:35:45.396 --> 00:35:48.027
opening of Carnegie Hall in New
York City in eighteen

00:35:48.027 --> 00:35:50.362
ninety-three--
as you can see,

00:35:50.362 --> 00:35:54.440
running from Mozart down to
Gustav Mahler.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.489
Not all of them were German.
 

00:35:56.489 --> 00:35:59.750
Who up there is not German?
 

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:00.940
Roger.
 

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.849
Student: Tchaikovsky.
 

00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:03.309
Prof: Tchaikovsky was
from where?

00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.829
Student: Russia.
 

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:04.842
Prof: Russia.
 

00:36:04.842 --> 00:36:06.059
Who else is not German?
 

00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:08.389
Oscar.
 

00:36:08.389 --> 00:36:08.909
Student:
&gt;

00:36:08.909 --> 00:36:10.210
Prof: I beg your pardon.
 

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.079
Student: Berlioz.
 

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:14.409
Prof: Berlioz?
 

00:36:14.409 --> 00:36:14.637
Yes.
 

00:36:14.637 --> 00:36:15.434
Oh, I'm sorry.
 

00:36:15.434 --> 00:36:16.630
Of course, Berlioz.
 

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.217
He is, of course,
French and we'll talk about him

00:36:19.217 --> 00:36:20.349
in section tonight.
 

00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:21.429
Anybody else?
 

00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:25.440
Well, Dvorak. He's Czech.
 

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:25.746
Okay.
 

00:36:25.746 --> 00:36:29.235
So--but they are all in this
fundamentally German-educated

00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:31.929
tradition extending really from
Bach in--

00:36:31.929 --> 00:36:34.610
but he didn't write
symphonies--into Mozart,

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.679
Haydn, Beethoven down to Mahler.
 

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:39.307
So we're going to go to the end
of the line now and talk a

00:36:39.307 --> 00:36:40.829
little bit about Gustav Mahler.
 

00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:43.510
Any of you listened to--ever
heard a symphony of Mahler?

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.518
If you've heard any music of
Mahler, raise your hand.

00:36:46.518 --> 00:36:46.963
Okay.
 

00:36:46.963 --> 00:36:50.869
I would say about a third of
our class has.

00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:54.309
Let's talk about that just for
a moment.

00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:58.458
I would say that if you haven't
been introduced to Mahler,

00:36:58.458 --> 00:37:00.059
don't miss this one.
 

00:37:00.059 --> 00:37:03.951
It's really great stuff and I
hope to be able to convince you

00:37:03.951 --> 00:37:07.713
of that here today if you're
kind enough to come along with

00:37:07.713 --> 00:37:11.539
us here in this trip along the
road of high art music--

00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:15.260
and we don't want to miss the
pinnacle,

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.760
in a way, of high art music.
 

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.900
For me these two M's are very
important, Mozart and Mahler.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.021
They write some really
astonishing music,

00:37:23.021 --> 00:37:24.559
in different kinds of ways.
 

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:26.610
So Gustav Mahler--who was he?
 

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.780
Well, he was a Jew born in
Moravia,

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.860
which is a section of
Czechoslovakia,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.260
got his musical education in
Vienna,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.710
was a pianist and principally a
conductor.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.380
He earned his living conducting.
 

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.534
And he went all around the
world conducting,

00:37:41.534 --> 00:37:44.690
and we'll talk more about that
next time--where he conducted.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:48.199
And he composed mostly in the
summertime.

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:51.074
He would go out to the Alps in
one of these mountain retreats

00:37:51.074 --> 00:37:53.760
in--where he could have solitude
and he would compose.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.489
And in the course of time,
he wrote principally nine

00:37:56.489 --> 00:37:59.702
symphonies and something we're
going to talk about next time,

00:37:59.702 --> 00:38:01.469
which is the orchestral song.
 

00:38:01.469 --> 00:38:07.708
But we're focusing on just one
symphony today--indeed his first

00:38:07.708 --> 00:38:09.420
symphony, 1888.
 

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.076
It starts in an unusual way
with a kind of homage to

00:38:13.076 --> 00:38:16.159
Beethoven because the beginning
of this--

00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:19.057
Mahler's first symphony--sounds
like the beginning of

00:38:19.057 --> 00:38:22.911
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony,
but let's just listen to a bit

00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:23.420
of it.
 

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.248
Oftentimes with Mahler people
talk about the

00:38:26.248 --> 00:38:29.340
"cosmic"
quality of Mahler's music.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:29.980
Well, what does that mean?
 

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.630
What kind of sound is cosmic?
 

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.119
Well, maybe it's kind of open.
 

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:34.320
Maybe it's kind of hollow.
 

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.601
Maybe it seems to be endlessly
spacey in that way,

00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:40.413
so here's a good example of
Mahler's style,

00:38:40.413 --> 00:38:42.690
particularly his cosmic style.
 

00:38:42.690 --> 00:39:18.289
&gt;
 

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:21.396
And those trumpets are sort of
off-stage trumpets,

00:39:21.396 --> 00:39:24.820
perhaps giving you more a sense
of far-out distance.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.989
So that's the beginning of the
first movement,

00:39:28.989 --> 00:39:32.181
and I've put this diagram up
here because it's interesting

00:39:32.181 --> 00:39:35.483
that so much of the material
that he is working with derives

00:39:35.483 --> 00:39:39.550
from a particular complex,
a particular cell of material.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.818
Mahler is a developer and
that's, generally speaking,

00:39:42.818 --> 00:39:46.530
what this German main line
tradition is into--not always.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.880
Tchaikovsky's not a developer.
 

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.719
He has trouble when it comes to
developing themes,

00:39:50.719 --> 00:39:52.730
but Beethoven--Mozart's a
developer,

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.289
Beethoven is a developer,
Brahms is a developer,

00:39:55.289 --> 00:39:58.268
Mahler is a developer,
and what they develop is,

00:39:58.268 --> 00:40:00.679
as I say, a nexus of musical
material.

00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:13.570
So this here is the initial
idea &gt;

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:22.010
and we can go back to our
technique &gt;

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.617
and then we'd go back down to
the &gt;

00:40:24.617 --> 00:40:26.500
, which would lead back to the
tonic.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.280
So we could have one more X
down here but it's the same X as

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:29.800
up there.
 

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.378
All right.
 

00:40:30.378 --> 00:40:33.500
So that's the essential motive
of the first movement.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.130
Let's go on to hear just a
little bit of the second

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.077
movement, which is a delightful
scherzo here of the first

00:40:39.077 --> 00:40:41.130
symphony of Mahler,
just a scherzo.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:56.750
&gt;
 

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:00.436
And now we're going to go on to
a very strange movement,

00:41:00.436 --> 00:41:03.119
the third movement,
the slow movement.

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:05.782
Remember in symphonies we
usually have fast,

00:41:05.782 --> 00:41:07.639
slow, scherzo,
fast, finale.

00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:10.150
Well, in the late eighteenth,
early nineteenth century,

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.639
sometimes they'd switch those.
 

00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:14.992
They'd put the scherzo number
two and then the scherzo minuet

00:41:14.992 --> 00:41:18.010
number two and then the slow
movement number three,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.260
so here we got the slow
movement as number three.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.780
Let's listen to a bit of it.
 

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.695
See if you can recognize the
melody that Mahler's working

00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:25.320
with here.
 

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:52.440
&gt;
 

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.199
I saw a smile come over Jacob's
face out there.

00:41:56.199 --> 00:41:57.250
Jacob.
 

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:57.740
Student:
"Frère

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:57.980
Jacques."
 

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.092
Prof: "Frère
Jacques"

00:42:00.092 --> 00:42:01.918
or in German "Bruder
Martin,"

00:42:01.918 --> 00:42:04.081
"Brother Martin,"
"Frère

00:42:04.081 --> 00:42:06.099
Jacques,"
but what happened to brother

00:42:06.099 --> 00:42:08.068
Martin or "Frère
Jacques"

00:42:08.068 --> 00:42:08.789
here?
 

00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:12.300
He got zapped into the--
Student: Minor.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.409
Prof: Minor. Okay.
 

00:42:13.409 --> 00:42:15.989
So this is a kind of gloomy
"Frere Jacques."

00:42:15.989 --> 00:42:18.510
It's a weird movement.
 

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:22.496
In a way, it's taking the
familiar and making it weirdly

00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:23.440
unfamiliar.
 

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.780
So that's what happens here in
the slow third movement.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.293
Now we're going to pass on to
the fourth movement 'cause

00:42:31.293 --> 00:42:35.255
that's the big-ticket item for
today--this morning--and I think

00:42:35.255 --> 00:42:37.110
we have time to cover it.
 

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:41.465
It's going to start out with
this gigantic kind of opening

00:42:41.465 --> 00:42:44.673
fireworks of just pure
orchestral sound and

00:42:44.673 --> 00:42:47.713
introduction,
and then a couple of themes

00:42:47.713 --> 00:42:52.400
will crop out,
&gt;

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:59.670
and then a little bit later
&gt;.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:03.429
So we'll have these two themes
here that we'll be working with

00:43:03.429 --> 00:43:07.130
and we'll pick up some other
themes a little bit later on.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.585
So let's hear--and we'll all
get ready for a big explosion

00:43:10.585 --> 00:43:12.769
here, the beginning of the
finale.

00:43:12.769 --> 00:44:32.380
&gt;
 

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.764
So that's the first theme
material there and you have

00:44:35.764 --> 00:44:37.775
the--
using the same kind of X-ing

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:40.000
process that we began our course
with,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.179
we can make use of it here to
kind of track or remember these

00:44:43.179 --> 00:44:44.239
particular themes.
 

00:44:44.239 --> 00:44:48.490
Myself, I can't always hear
them but if I can visualize them

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:49.500
it helps me.
 

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.202
All right.
 

00:44:50.202 --> 00:44:54.000
So we're going to now go on to
the second theme area.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.798
He's essentially following our
sonata-allegro form here and we

00:44:57.798 --> 00:44:59.170
have a long passage.
 

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.998
It goes on for about three
minutes, but it's a

00:45:01.998 --> 00:45:04.639
quintessential moment of
romantic music.

00:45:04.639 --> 00:45:08.257
It's along the same lines of
the Tchaikovsky that we heard

00:45:08.257 --> 00:45:08.829
before.
 

00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:11.583
So let's just start out here
and we'll listen and we'll

00:45:11.583 --> 00:45:14.849
comment on what's romantic about
the music that we're hearing.

00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:17.210
&gt;
 

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:18.771
End of transition.
 

00:45:18.771 --> 00:45:20.679
Here comes the theme.
 

00:45:20.679 --> 00:46:13.619
&gt;
 

00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:14.760
What's romantic about that?
 

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.309
Thoughts. Elizabeth.
 

00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:18.989
Student: There's a lot
of slurred notes.

00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:20.170
Prof: Okay.
 

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.268
A lot of &gt;.
 

00:46:22.268 --> 00:46:24.440
Yeah, it's a lot of slurred
notes.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.356
Whether that kind of inspires
this to romance I'm not really

00:46:27.356 --> 00:46:30.260
sure, but it's not precise;
it's not marching along;

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.768
it's not discrete frequencies.
 

00:46:31.768 --> 00:46:35.599
Now what instrument is carrying
the melody here,

00:46:35.599 --> 00:46:40.409
is particularly good at that
kind of--what's the German word

00:46:40.409 --> 00:46:41.550
in Vienna?
 

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.902
Schlagober,
or something like that for

00:46:43.902 --> 00:46:46.574
whipped cream kind of sound,
probably some German--

00:46:46.574 --> 00:46:48.340
&gt;
 

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:52.039
Elizabeth, what instrument is
playing that?

00:46:52.039 --> 00:46:52.750
Student: The violins.
 

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:56.271
Prof: The violins,
and this is because the violins

00:46:56.271 --> 00:47:00.170
have this capacity for vibrato
and to slide between pitches.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.525
It gives this this kind of
romantic effect so it's not

00:47:03.525 --> 00:47:06.630
marching along in any kind of
precise way here.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.454
All right.
 

00:47:07.454 --> 00:47:12.159
So that's my principal point--a
warm, lush string sound.

00:47:12.159 --> 00:47:13.030
Let's go on.
 

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:18.110
&gt;
 

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:31.260
 
 

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:35.641
I think we really have only
about two minutes left and I do

00:47:35.641 --> 00:47:38.155
want to if--
everybody was good enough to

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:40.860
show up on time so I want to let
you leave on time.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.266
Let's go--just to give you a
sense of the sound here,

00:47:44.266 --> 00:47:46.559
let's go to the very end of
this.

00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:51.309
 
 

00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:52.329
It's a long movement.
 

00:47:52.329 --> 00:47:53.469
It's about twenty minutes long.
 

00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:56.715
We got about two minutes--two,
three minutes to go,

00:47:56.715 --> 00:48:00.677
and you're going to hear this
extreme orchestral contrast here

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:02.820
as it gets bigger and bigger.
 

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.889
Notice that we had a minor
theme here.

00:48:04.889 --> 00:48:08.719
The same theme comes back but
he takes out all of the

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:12.179
chromatic minor sound and makes
it all major.

00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:15.059
We're going to get lots of
heroic trumpets going on with

00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:16.579
that addition to our theme.
 

00:48:16.579 --> 00:48:17.929
Think about this.
 

00:48:17.929 --> 00:48:23.521
This I like to think of as the
last gasp of the traditional

00:48:23.521 --> 00:48:26.510
high art classical orchestra.
 

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:30.570
It never got any better than
this.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:34.135
It never got any bigger than
this for reasons that we'll

00:48:34.135 --> 00:48:35.949
maybe comment on after it.
 

00:48:35.949 --> 00:48:38.090
So let's listen and then one
comment at the end.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:51:11.409
&gt;
 

00:51:11.409 --> 00:51:13.170
And one final thought.
 

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.460
Why did it stop here?
 

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:20.384
Why did--what happened in the
history of art music to change

00:51:20.384 --> 00:51:21.469
everything?
 

00:51:21.469 --> 00:51:23.019
Anybody have any idea?
 

00:51:23.019 --> 00:51:25.880
Daniel.
 

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:26.570
Student:
&gt;

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.210
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:32.106
That's what happened:
electronically produced sound

00:51:32.106 --> 00:51:36.860
where you could control the
decibel level and reproduce it.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.059
People started staying home and
playing recordings and they

00:51:40.059 --> 00:51:43.041
could manipulate the volume any
way they wanted at that

00:51:43.041 --> 00:51:44.199
particular point.
 

00:51:44.199 --> 00:51:46.119
Okay. Thanks for staying on.
 

00:51:46.119 --> 00:51:47.400
Have a great break.
 

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.664
We may--I hope to see you in
sections tonight and Friday and

00:51:50.664 --> 00:51:52.159
Monday when you get back.
 

00:51:52.159 --> 00:51:58.000

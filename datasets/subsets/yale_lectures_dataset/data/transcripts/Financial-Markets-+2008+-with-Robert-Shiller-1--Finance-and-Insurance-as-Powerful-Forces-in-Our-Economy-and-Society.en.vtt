00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.223
Professor Robert Shiller:
This is Economics 252,

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:12.420
Financial Markets,
and I'm Bob Shiller.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.123
Let me begin by introducing the
teaching fellows for this

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:22.320
course;
and so I have them up here.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.103
We have five teaching fellows
at this time and they're from

00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:33.786
all over.
I like to put their pictures up

00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:38.137
so you'll know who they are.
The teaching fellows are very

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:42.711
international and that reflects
my intention to make this a

00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:47.128
course that is also very
international because finance is

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:50.520
something about the whole world
today,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.902
not just the United States.
So we cover the world very well

00:00:54.902 --> 00:00:59.061
with our T.A.'s.
Usman Ali is from Pakistan,

00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:05.269
Lahore, and he graduated from
the LUMS, Lahore University of

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.843
Management Sciences.
He's a PhD candidate now in

00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:14.469
Economics and he's doing his
doctoral dissertation on stock

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.174
analysts' recommendations and
the relation to returns in the

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:22.197
stock market.
He's also interested in

00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:25.373
behavioral finance,
which is the application of

00:01:25.373 --> 00:01:28.426
psychology to finance.
The second teaching

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:32.334
assistant--I see him right
there, if you could raise your

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:36.822
hand--Santosh Anagol,
who is a representative of the

00:01:36.822 --> 00:01:40.479
United States,
although he seems to have

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.687
connections to India as well.
He actually has a publication

00:01:45.687 --> 00:01:50.484
already in the American Economic
Review on the Return to Capital

00:01:50.484 --> 00:01:53.809
with Ghana.
He did this jointly with the

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:57.116
Chairman of the Economics
Department here,

00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:01.554
Chris Udry and he has spent
time in India looking at the

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:05.162
village economies.
You were going to be giving

00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:07.895
away cows, did you do that?
Student: No,

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.689
I'm still working on cows but
we're not giving them away.

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.030
Professor Robert
Shiller: Okay,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.240
that's the last time you'll
hear about cows in this course.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.647
The idea was to give cows away
to village farmers and to

00:02:17.647 --> 00:02:20.710
observe the outcome.
It's a big change in some of

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.080
these very poor villages to get
a cow.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.939
Christian Awuku-Budu is from
Ghana, Accra,

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.987
but he, again,
went to college in the United

00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:36.638
States at Morehouse College.
He is also a PhD candidate in

00:02:36.638 --> 00:02:41.915
Economics at Yale and he's been
doing research on financial

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:51.580
markets in developing countries.
Yaxin Duan is from China.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.970
She got her undergraduate
degree from Nanjing University.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.873
No?
You are from Nanjing,

00:02:57.873 --> 00:03:00.720
did I get a detail wrong?
Where did you go to college?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:11.516
Okay, well I'm sorry about that.
She is also a PhD candidate in

00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:15.689
Economics and is doing research
on the behavior of options

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.569
prices in a phenomenon called
the "options smile,"

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.180
as she's smiling at me right
now.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.178
She is also interested in
behavioral finance,

00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:30.129
which is great to me because
that's one of my interests.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.229
She is shown here standing
precariously on a cliff.

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:41.247
It makes me nervous to look at
it overlooking Machu Picchu in

00:03:41.247 --> 00:03:43.964
Peru.
She also loves astronomy,

00:03:43.964 --> 00:03:47.590
which is incidentally an
interest of mine too,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.780
but you won't hear about it
again in this course.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.447
Finally, Xiaolan Zhou is our
fifth teaching assistant and

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:03.210
she's also from China,
Hubei Province.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.310
She graduated from Wuhan
University and is a PhD

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.807
candidate in Economics at Yale.
She is doing research on bank

00:04:12.807 --> 00:04:13.620
mergers.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.929
Let me say, I've been teaching
this course now for over twenty

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:31.430
years and I'm very proud of all
of my alumni.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.920
Many of them are in the field
of finance.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.767
In fact, I like sometimes when
I give--I give a lot of public

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.890
talks.
When I give a talk on Wall

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.606
Street or even somewhere else in
the world I sometimes ask my

00:04:44.606 --> 00:04:46.959
audience, "Did you take my
course?"

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:50.814
It's not infrequent that I'll
get one or even two people

00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:54.879
raising their hand that they
took Economics 252 from me.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:00.511
But I'm also proud of my alumni
in this course who are not in

00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:04.947
the world of finance.
I think this course goes

00:05:04.947 --> 00:05:10.547
beyond--It's not just for people
who are planning careers in

00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:15.957
finance because finance is a
very important technology and

00:05:15.957 --> 00:05:20.987
it's very important to know
finance to understand what

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:27.106
happens in the real world.
Just about any human endeavor

00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:30.074
involves finance.
Now, you might say,

00:05:30.074 --> 00:05:33.125
"I could be a poet and what
does that have to do with

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:35.339
finance?"
Well, it probably ends up

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.719
having something to do with
finance because as a poet you

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.220
probably want to publish your
poetry and you're going to be

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.944
talking to publishers.
Before you know it,

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:48.284
they're going to be talking
about their financial situation

00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:51.861
and how you fit into it.
I believe it's fundamental and

00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:55.558
very important.
I think you will find this

00:05:55.558 --> 00:06:00.493
course as not a vocational
course--not primarily a

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:05.932
vocational course--but an
intellectual course about how

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:09.739
things really work.
I see finance as the

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:12.379
underpinning of so much that
happens.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:15.741
It's a powerful force that goes
behind the scene and I hope we

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:17.670
can draw that out in this
course.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.783
There is another course--we
have two basic courses in

00:06:21.783 --> 00:06:24.709
finance for undergraduates at
Yale.

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:30.660
The other one is Economics 251,
Financial Theory;

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.019
this is Financial Markets,
that one is Financial Theory.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.803
Last year it was taught by
Rafael Romeu,

00:06:37.803 --> 00:06:42.071
because John,
Geanakoplos who usually teaches

00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:48.279
the course, was on leave and so
we had to find someone else.

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:54.588
I assume that next fall John
Geanakoplos will be teaching 251

00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:56.319
again.
So what happened?

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.120
Why do we have these two
courses?

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.610
Well it was something like
eight years ago that we reached

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.329
the present situation with two
finance courses.

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:12.432
John Geanakoplos and I had a
meeting and we tried to divide

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:16.110
up the subject matter of finance
into two courses.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.615
We thought Financial Theory and
Financial Markets would be the

00:07:19.615 --> 00:07:22.988
two.
But the problem was that both

00:07:22.988 --> 00:07:29.149
John and I are interested in
both theory and applications.

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:33.752
John Geanakoplos is actually
Chief Economist for a large

00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:38.019
investment called Ellington
Capital in Greenwich,

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:39.958
Connecticut,
which you'll see a lot in the

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.610
news.
It has been very successful.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:47.122
He is very much interested in
the real world and I am

00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:52.764
interested in financial theory,
so we find it--we decided,

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:57.136
after talking about it,
that we really can't divide up

00:07:57.136 --> 00:08:02.085
the subject matter of finance
into separate courses on theory

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:06.322
and practice.
If you tried to do one alone it

00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:10.228
would not work,
so we decided to divide it up

00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:15.465
imperfectly and there may be
some repetition between our two

00:08:15.465 --> 00:08:20.002
courses.
Both of them are self-contained

00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:24.803
courses, so you could take
either 251 or 252,

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:29.379
or you could take both.
I think maybe the best option

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:32.799
is to take both if you're really
interested in the subject

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.400
matter.

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:43.259
It is true though that his
course is more tuned into

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:48.715
theoretical detail than mine.
John is a mathematical

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:54.482
economist and we both love
mathematics, but maybe John is

00:08:54.482 --> 00:08:58.190
going to do more of it than I
am.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:03.291
This course actually will not
use a heavy amount of

00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:08.741
mathematics.
I try to keep it so that people

00:09:08.741 --> 00:09:16.783
who are not comfortable with a
lot of math can take this course

00:09:16.783 --> 00:09:24.696
and I wanted to emphasize that
this is--I've said that it's--I

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:32.480
think this course is vocational
preparation in a sense.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.352
I pride myself on the fact that
people who have taken this

00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:39.750
course find it useful in their
subsequent lives,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.418
but on the other hand,
I think that it's really

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:47.547
interesting.
At least I find it really

00:09:47.547 --> 00:09:50.620
interesting and so I hope that
you will too.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.885
Now I don't know,
I may be different than other

00:09:52.885 --> 00:09:55.940
people, but I think organic
chemistry is really interesting.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.309
How many of you have that
feeling?

00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:02.621
Can I get a show of hands,
who is interested in organic

00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:06.145
chemistry?
I'm not getting a lot of hands

00:10:06.145 --> 00:10:07.988
raised.
Unfortunately,

00:10:07.988 --> 00:10:12.872
I've never taken a course in
it, but I've started reading it

00:10:12.872 --> 00:10:17.259
lately out of just my broad
intellectual interest.

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:20.200
That is a course that has a bad
reputation, doesn't it?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.931
Because people say I've got to
take that if I want to be

00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:26.022
pre-med.
But, you know,

00:10:26.022 --> 00:10:31.269
to me there's a lot of detail
in organic chemistry.

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:35.557
To me, when you read the detail
you're getting into something

00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:40.060
deep and important about the way
everything works and so I start

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.580
to find it interesting.
So I don't know how people feel

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.760
about taking--maybe I'm turning
you off by saying this--There's

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.120
going to be a lot of detail in
this course.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.868
Maybe I made a big mistake by
likening it to an organic

00:10:52.868 --> 00:10:56.269
chemistry course--I don't mean
to turn you off.

00:10:56.269 --> 00:11:00.817
The idea in this course is that
by being a financial markets

00:11:00.817 --> 00:11:04.440
course, you have to know how the
world works.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.047
We're going to be thinking
about that in connection with

00:11:08.047 --> 00:11:10.932
Financial Theory,
but we have to get into the

00:11:10.932 --> 00:11:16.617
details;
so we are going to be learning

00:11:16.617 --> 00:11:18.740
about facts.

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:27.419
Let me start by talking about
the textbook.

00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:35.487
So the principal textbook is
Frank Fabozzi,

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:42.210
the other authors are
Modigliani,

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:47.009
Jones and Ferri,
Foundations of Financial

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:53.956
Markets and Institutions.
This textbook is very detailed

00:11:53.956 --> 00:12:00.813
and it may be--I've had some
reaction by students--more than

00:12:00.813 --> 00:12:03.370
you wanted to know.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.470
I actually had a great
experience reading it.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.675
Actually, it was an earlier
edition, when I first assigned

00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:17.049
this book in the year 2000,
I took it with me on vacation.

00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:20.480
I was going to the Bahamas with
my family and with Jeremy

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.399
Siegel's family--we'll come back
to Jeremy Siegel in a minute.

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:28.759
I sat down by the pool with
this book.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:32.360
Other people were reading
novels and I don't know what

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.177
else, but I was reading Fabozzi.
I had such a great time with

00:12:37.177 --> 00:12:40.580
it, so I'm telling you my
experience.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.898
Maybe it was because it was
filling in gaps in my

00:12:42.898 --> 00:12:45.700
knowledge--things I've always
wanted to know and was always

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.469
curious about.
That's partly what you have to

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:52.014
develop when you get interested
in a field: some sense of

00:12:52.014 --> 00:12:56.552
curiosity about all the details.
So I read the whole book,

00:12:56.552 --> 00:13:02.590
650 pages, maybe I kind of read
fast because I knew a lot of it.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.941
It might take you a little
longer to get through it,

00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:09.029
but I wanted you to have the
same experience.

00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:13.825
I've been assigning this book,
now it's in another edition

00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:18.116
and--Fabozzi is working on a
fourth or next edition,

00:13:18.116 --> 00:13:22.358
I forget what number.
I've been assigning--I've

00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:27.406
gotten some complaints from
students that this book is tough

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:31.769
going because there's so much
information in it.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.133
I used to tell people,
" I'm assigning the whole book

00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:36.270
and you have to know everything
in the book."

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.690
That's a little ambitious.
I finally backed down because I

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.299
met a man on Wall Street,
a very prominent Wall Street

00:13:46.299 --> 00:13:47.673
person,
and he said,

00:13:47.673 --> 00:13:50.450
"You know, my son started to
take your course."

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.179
I said, "What do you mean
started the course?"

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:57.117
He said, "Well,
he dropped out when he saw this

00:13:57.117 --> 00:14:00.429
book and the requirements."
I didn't like that.

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:02.090
I don't want students to drop
out.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:07.070
So what I decided is that you
need to know the whole book in

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:12.051
the sense that you need to know
all of the key terms and key

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:14.179
points.
Now if you look at the

00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:16.961
structure of this book,
it has sections that say Key

00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:21.197
Points and Key Terms.
Anything that's mentioned there

00:14:21.197 --> 00:14:27.240
is fair game for me in an exam
and that's the way I've done it.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.470
There are key points and key
terms.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:35.198
Also, anything in my lecture is
of course fair game for the

00:14:35.198 --> 00:14:38.106
exam.
Let me also add that I have a

00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:42.615
reading list that has clickable
things on it and also things

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:45.519
that are on reserve in the
library.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:48.409
Anything that's clickable is
required reading.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:52.003
I don't expect you go to the
library, however,

00:14:52.003 --> 00:14:56.315
because I think that we're
moving into an age where you

00:14:56.315 --> 00:14:59.269
tend to want to be online,
right?

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:04.840
So the library books are all
optional background.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:10.460
Fabozzi, a faculty member here
at Yale, has offered to give

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:16.662
me--we have at least one chapter
from the new edition that hasn't

00:15:16.662 --> 00:15:20.700
come out yet.
I'm going to put that on

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.040
reserve in the library;
but again, I think that the

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.798
edition that you have is
reasonably up to date and so

00:15:28.798 --> 00:15:32.049
that's all that I'm expecting
you to read.

00:15:32.049 --> 00:15:36.881
The other author,
Franco Modigliani--in the book,

00:15:36.881 --> 00:15:41.210
the second author--was my
teacher at MIT.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:46.813
He died in 2003.
He is also a Nobel Prize winner

00:15:46.813 --> 00:15:50.250
and I think has a remarkable
intellect.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.826
So this book,
Fabozzi, et al.--Fabozzi,

00:15:53.826 --> 00:15:58.909
Modigliani, Jones and Ferri--is
a very solid book about

00:15:58.909 --> 00:16:04.428
financial markets.
The second book that I'm

00:16:04.428 --> 00:16:13.050
assigning is Jeremy Siegel,
Stocks for the Long Run.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.860
This is an old friend of mine.
I met him in graduate school.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.055
Funny story,
I met him because at MIT they

00:16:24.055 --> 00:16:28.341
signed us all up for chest
x-rays alphabetically--that's

00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:31.769
the way MIT does things,
an orderly way.

00:16:31.769 --> 00:16:35.467
Shiller and Siegel are next to
each other in the alphabet,

00:16:35.467 --> 00:16:39.490
so I was standing in line with
him for an x-ray and was talking

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.279
with him and I've known him ever
since.

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:46.177
A funny coincidence is that
since our names are close in the

00:16:46.177 --> 00:16:49.547
alphabet--you often find our
books right together in

00:16:49.547 --> 00:16:53.313
bookstores because Shiller and
Siegel--if they're shelving

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:56.220
alphabetically--would end up
together.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.937
He wrote a book called
Stocks for the Long Run,

00:16:59.937 --> 00:17:03.872
starting in 1993.
It just came out with the

00:17:03.872 --> 00:17:08.869
fourth edition and that book was
a best seller.

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.049
I think it sold over a half
million copies.

00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:15.820
I'm not sure where it is now
but it has done very well.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.375
It's been a perennial classic.
It emphasizes the long run

00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:26.920
performance of the stock market,
but it's really a general

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:33.456
treatise of financial markets.
I get a very good reaction from

00:17:33.456 --> 00:17:37.539
students about this book.
This one is very readable.

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:41.119
It's not as intense as Fabozzi,
et al.

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:45.021
Jeremy Siegel holds the unique
distinction--Business

00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:49.790
Week did a poll asking MBA's
about their favorite professor.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.224
This was about ten years ago.
They ranked business school

00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:55.720
professors according to their
popularity.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.413
He came out number one in the
United States as business school

00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:02.839
professor.
I think you'll like this book.

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:06.930
The next book is my own and
called Irrational

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.474
Exuberance.
This is the last book--That's a

00:18:11.474 --> 00:18:17.602
phrase that was coined by Allen
Greenspan in 1996 and it refers

00:18:17.602 --> 00:18:23.829
to the stock market boom of the
2000s--of the 1990s and the boom

00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:29.759
and the bust--well I think it's
related to the bust that came

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:32.410
out later,
after 2000.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:38.062
I wrote this book in 2000 right
at the peak of--fortunately

00:18:38.062 --> 00:18:41.960
right at the peak of the stock
market.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.289
But what I'm assigning to you
is the second edition,

00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:48.749
which came out in 2005,
pretty much at the peak of the

00:18:48.749 --> 00:18:52.661
housing market.
We're going to talk about both

00:18:52.661 --> 00:18:58.539
the housing market and the stock
market in these different books.

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:02.417
These books are all on sale at
Labyrinth Books,

00:19:02.417 --> 00:19:06.970
which is an independent
bookstore here in New Haven.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.108
I put it there because,
well, I think the major chain

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:15.724
bookstores fulfill an important
function but I also like to

00:19:15.724 --> 00:19:20.086
support independent bookstores.
I don't know if you know the

00:19:20.086 --> 00:19:23.519
story, but Labyrinth Books is
independent, it's not a chain,

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:26.591
and independent bookstores are
trying–struggling--to

00:19:26.591 --> 00:19:28.009
survive.
This is finance.

00:19:28.009 --> 00:19:31.426
In the book business,
there's something difficult

00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:34.630
about maintaining an independent
operation.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.029
Labyrinth was at Columbia
University and Yale.

00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:42.183
For some reason they shut down
their Columbia bookstore,

00:19:42.183 --> 00:19:45.279
but they've opened up now in
Princeton.

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:48.456
There was this famous bookstore
in Princeton on Nassau Street

00:19:48.456 --> 00:19:51.210
called Micawber's,
which is a wonderful bookstore.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.549
I've been in there a number of
times.

00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:55.160
But they just went out of
business.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.230
Labyrinth has moved in to take
their place.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:06.893
Anyway, that's where all the
books are and they are available

00:20:06.893 --> 00:20:07.760
now.

00:20:19.599 --> 00:20:21.590
We're going to have these
lectures on Mondays and

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.390
Wednesdays.
We're going to have T.A.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.250
sections in the second part of
the week.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.117
We're going to ask you to look
at your schedule sometime before

00:20:30.117 --> 00:20:34.047
our next lecture and think about
when you can come to a teaching

00:20:34.047 --> 00:20:37.089
assistant section.
They will be Wednesday,

00:20:37.089 --> 00:20:40.789
Thursday, and Friday and we
have six problem sets.

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:47.177
The six problem sets are due
generally on Mondays and we'll

00:20:47.177 --> 00:20:52.574
go over the problem sets in the
teaching sections,

00:20:52.574 --> 00:20:56.980
several days after you turn
them in.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.045
This is one of the biggest
classes at Yale,

00:21:00.045 --> 00:21:04.351
but I think we've got it so it
will be a good and satisfying

00:21:04.351 --> 00:21:07.994
experience for you.
We have very qualified--I'm

00:21:07.994 --> 00:21:11.269
very impressed with our teaching
assistants.

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:16.135
The important thing is for you
to stay with them and get to

00:21:16.135 --> 00:21:19.659
know them and I urge you to
attend the T.A.

00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:22.151
sections.
The course is going to be

00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:26.660
graded.
We have two mid-terms and one

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.236
final.
The in class mid-terms--the

00:21:30.236 --> 00:21:33.987
grades will be roughly 10%
problem sets,

00:21:33.987 --> 00:21:37.737
20% first mid-term,
30% second mid-term,

00:21:37.737 --> 00:21:41.323
40% final.
But we will also use judgment

00:21:41.323 --> 00:21:45.906
and I'm going to appeal to the
T.A.'s to help me on judging the

00:21:45.906 --> 00:21:46.720
grading.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.551
Also, I ask the teaching
assistants to give me little

00:21:56.551 --> 00:21:59.720
capsule descriptions of you so
that if in ten years,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.031
or 20 years from now,
I get a call from a reporter

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:07.289
asking about this illustrious
person who was once my student,

00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:10.119
I can have something to prod my
memory.

00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:13.562
That's why I hope you'll stay
with--you'll each find a

00:22:13.562 --> 00:22:16.940
teaching assistant and will stay
with that person.

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:28.579
I want to say something about a
particular interest of mine

00:22:28.579 --> 00:22:35.713
because it is part of this
course, although not the entire

00:22:35.713 --> 00:22:39.635
course.
Behavioral finance refers to a

00:22:39.635 --> 00:22:44.895
revolution in finance that has
occurred over the last ten or 20

00:22:44.895 --> 00:22:49.052
years and that is
incorporated--Behavioral finance

00:22:49.052 --> 00:22:54.058
is the theory of finance mixed
in with the theories of other

00:22:54.058 --> 00:22:57.901
social sciences,
notably psychology,

00:22:57.901 --> 00:23:02.680
sociology, political science,
and anthropology.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:08.871
I think it's the most important
revolution in finance of the

00:23:08.871 --> 00:23:12.649
last couple decades.
Maybe I'm biased because I've

00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:16.399
been very much involved in it.
I've been organizing workshops

00:23:16.399 --> 00:23:20.467
in behavioral finance at the
National Bureau for Economic

00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:24.535
Research since 1991 with Dick
Thaler at the University of

00:23:24.535 --> 00:23:27.466
Chicago.
We think that we're avant-garde

00:23:27.466 --> 00:23:31.586
of a major revolution.
The unity of the social

00:23:31.586 --> 00:23:35.960
sciences is, I think,
very important.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.299
It's a mistake to try to
consider finance in isolation.

00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:45.670
There is a whole array of other
information related to finance.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.678
This will be a theme of my
course and also a theme of this

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:52.279
book, Irrational
Exuberance.

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:58.529
That's what exuberance refers
to--it's a psychological term.

00:23:58.529 --> 00:24:05.160
So that's an important element
of this course.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.964
Another thing that I will be
talking about is less important

00:24:10.964 --> 00:24:14.998
to this course but you have
heard of this:

00:24:14.998 --> 00:24:20.293
the subprime crisis.
This is the big financial event

00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:25.309
that is hitting the United
States and the entire world

00:24:25.309 --> 00:24:29.066
right now.
I'm actually writing another

00:24:29.066 --> 00:24:32.788
book about this.
It's not done in time for you

00:24:32.788 --> 00:24:37.544
to read but I think I will have
it done at some time during this

00:24:37.544 --> 00:24:41.170
semester.
What does it mean?

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:48.784
"Subprime" refers to the
mortgages that were made mostly

00:24:48.784 --> 00:24:56.259
over the last ten years or so to
subprime borrowers.

00:24:56.259 --> 00:25:01.050
A "subprime borrower" is
somebody who has a poor credit

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:06.372
history or some other indication
that would suggest that they

00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:12.049
might not be able to repay the
mortgage--they might default.

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:15.144
The industry,
subprime lending,

00:25:15.144 --> 00:25:20.302
has grown dramatically over the
last ten years and,

00:25:20.302 --> 00:25:25.460
as you probably know,
it's in big trouble now.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.932
What's happening is the housing
market is dropping,

00:25:29.932 --> 00:25:34.852
home prices are falling,
people are defaulting in record

00:25:34.852 --> 00:25:38.430
numbers, and there are
foreclosures.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.230
What happens if you don't pay
your mortgage?

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.575
If you buy a house and you
don't pay the mortgage,

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:47.808
the contract says you lose the
house--you're out--you've got to

00:25:47.808 --> 00:25:51.289
pay or it goes back to the
mortgage originator.

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:57.316
This crisis is very interesting
to me because it's had so many

00:25:57.316 --> 00:26:01.960
ramifications throughout the
financial world.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.027
It's exposing defects in many
of our biggest financial

00:26:06.027 --> 00:26:10.710
institutions and every day we
see more news about failures,

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.093
huge losses,
resignations,

00:26:13.093 --> 00:26:16.430
or firings of top finance
people.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.720
So it's a very interesting time
in finance.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:25.379
These things happen from time
to time, but they happen with

00:26:25.379 --> 00:26:30.941
enough regularity that there's
something we really want to

00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:35.039
understand as a systematic
phenomenon.

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:38.109
So that's another thing that I
will be talking about.

00:26:38.109 --> 00:26:42.120
Let me make another point about
technology.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:53.016
Finance, I believe,
is a technology and that means

00:26:53.016 --> 00:26:59.460
it is a way of doing things.
It has a lot of detail.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:07.450
A financial instrument is like
an engineering device.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.405
Here I'm tying to the
engineering--Is anyone here from

00:27:11.405 --> 00:27:13.390
engineering?
A couple of you,

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.799
well this could be--In fact,
some engineering schools offer

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:19.210
courses in finance,
did you know that?

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.360
Engineers find it congenial
because they have a way of

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.590
thinking constructively about
the world that is kind of

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:33.553
parallel to finance.
We have theories--mathematical

00:27:33.553 --> 00:27:41.039
theories--that lead us to devise
financial structures,

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:46.941
which are complicated devices
just like engines or nuclear

00:27:46.941 --> 00:27:49.809
reactors.
They have a lot of components

00:27:49.809 --> 00:27:53.631
and they have to work right.
When people first devise some

00:27:53.631 --> 00:27:57.309
new financial instrument it
typically has trouble.

00:27:57.309 --> 00:28:00.709
Like when they devised the
first engines or the first

00:28:00.709 --> 00:28:03.847
nuclear reactors,
it didn't work so well at first

00:28:03.847 --> 00:28:07.900
and then from the experience of
many people working on it,

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.430
over many years,
a body of knowledge emerges and

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:16.214
that's what we call technology.
So technology is a powerful

00:28:16.214 --> 00:28:20.910
force in our society and I
respect power of this kind.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.269
That's why I like to follow it
up.

00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:26.890
But technology is also
dangerous.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.869
Nuclear power,
for example,

00:28:28.869 --> 00:28:33.437
may be our salvation when we
run out of oil--or virtually run

00:28:33.437 --> 00:28:37.777
out of oil--it seems to be
coming up over the next several

00:28:37.777 --> 00:28:41.279
decades--we're going to have to
do that,

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.319
we're going to need nuclear
power.

00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:45.849
But it's also dangerous,
as you know.

00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:49.650
The same thing is true about
finance.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.920
I think that,
in a sense, the subprime crisis

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.529
that we have is an example of
the dangers of new technology.

00:28:57.529 --> 00:29:02.792
We have been seeing financial
technology advance in recent

00:29:02.792 --> 00:29:08.239
years and this advancement of
technology has brought us some

00:29:08.239 --> 00:29:11.187
problems.
Some people want to go back,

00:29:11.187 --> 00:29:14.808
some people think there's a lot
of anger about the subprime

00:29:14.808 --> 00:29:18.553
prices and there's some anger
expressed against the financial

00:29:18.553 --> 00:29:22.017
community.
I think that we should be very

00:29:22.017 --> 00:29:26.986
careful not to let that deflect
us from the recognition that

00:29:26.986 --> 00:29:32.041
this is important technology and
that it's not the technology

00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:35.450
that's at fault;
we have to get it right and

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:40.454
then it will be powerful.
I've had some experience giving

00:29:40.454 --> 00:29:44.320
talks in less developed
countries.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.787
I'm not a development economist.
Now a development

00:29:47.787 --> 00:29:52.624
economist--that's Santosh's
field--Development economics is

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:57.211
a very important field in
economics that is helping less

00:29:57.211 --> 00:30:02.129
developed countries emerge.
I'm very proud to say that Yale

00:30:02.129 --> 00:30:06.336
has a strong department at the
Growth Center on development

00:30:06.336 --> 00:30:10.009
economics.
I'm not a development economist.

00:30:10.009 --> 00:30:12.480
Nonetheless,
when I've spoken in less

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.636
developed countries,
I find that they're really

00:30:15.636 --> 00:30:19.456
interested in finance.
I think that's because there's

00:30:19.456 --> 00:30:23.394
a growing recognition that
that's what you need to know and

00:30:23.394 --> 00:30:27.331
that the countries that are
emerging successfully are those

00:30:27.331 --> 00:30:31.065
that have well developed
financial institutions that are

00:30:31.065 --> 00:30:35.059
adopting the technology.
They have to adapt it to their

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:37.453
own situation,
but in many ways they're

00:30:37.453 --> 00:30:40.298
copying technology.
There's nothing bad about

00:30:40.298 --> 00:30:43.099
copying technology,
that's what everybody does.

00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:46.379
When somebody invented the
automobile, before you knew it

00:30:46.379 --> 00:30:50.068
everyone was driving automobiles
and they all looked pretty much

00:30:50.068 --> 00:30:52.210
the same.
When someone invented the

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:55.357
airplane, before you knew it
every country had an airplane

00:30:55.357 --> 00:30:57.400
because there was a best
practice,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.085
there was a best technology and
it was not unique to any one

00:31:01.085 --> 00:31:05.489
country.
So that's why I view this

00:31:05.489 --> 00:31:11.840
course as fundamentally about
technology.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.378
I want to say something about
morality and about mixed

00:31:24.378 --> 00:31:27.880
feelings that people have about
finance.

00:31:35.609 --> 00:31:38.143
I know that undergraduates--I
don't know how you feel about

00:31:38.143 --> 00:31:40.833
finance.
Some people have a reaction--If

00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:44.977
you say you're taking a course
in finance, they think that

00:31:44.977 --> 00:31:49.121
maybe you're selling out or
maybe you value money too much

00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:53.119
and that you should really be in
some other field.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:32:00.460
This is a longstanding conflict
in our thinking.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:05.663
There is some contempt for
finance, I believe,

00:32:05.663 --> 00:32:11.329
because it makes so much money
for many people.

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:13.390
Many of our students go into
finance.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.518
Yale is very strong in
providing people to the

00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:19.160
financial community and,
I have to say,

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.881
they do very well.
My first advice is if you want

00:32:22.881 --> 00:32:25.804
to make money,
which I don't particularly

00:32:25.804 --> 00:32:30.480
advise, but if you do it's not a
bad idea to go into finance.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.596
Just as, you know,
you can make a lot of money

00:32:32.596 --> 00:32:36.085
with organic chemistry too.
I think that what you have to

00:32:36.085 --> 00:32:40.337
do as a young person is develop
your human capital and that

00:32:40.337 --> 00:32:47.476
means knowing how to do things.
But there is hostility toward

00:32:47.476 --> 00:32:56.287
finance that I think is very
fundamental to a lot of our

00:32:56.287 --> 00:33:00.002
thinking.
I wanted to say something about

00:33:00.002 --> 00:33:04.566
that.
Part of it is that some people

00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:10.253
in finance get so rich.
If you look at the list of the

00:33:10.253 --> 00:33:13.261
richest people,
they're all connected to

00:33:13.261 --> 00:33:17.269
finance, right?
I mean they understand it.

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:20.426
Maybe they're not–-Maybe
they're in publishing or some

00:33:20.426 --> 00:33:23.636
other field but they understand
finance and a lot of them are

00:33:23.636 --> 00:33:27.119
directly in finance.
So what do we make of that?

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:33.266
Well part of it is that we get
very--We get a sort of jealousy

00:33:33.266 --> 00:33:39.110
of these people because why
should someone have billions of

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.549
dollars?
Did they really deserve that?

00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:46.895
Some people who make a lot of
money get

00:33:46.895 --> 00:33:53.755
self-important–who make a
lot of money--and they end up

00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:59.130
not making a lot of friends in
the process.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:04.152
The Yale University Press is
publishing a new book by Steve

00:34:04.152 --> 00:34:08.878
Fraser about Wall Street.
He gives examples in this book

00:34:08.878 --> 00:34:13.654
about hostility toward--it goes
way back--In Fraser's book he

00:34:13.654 --> 00:34:18.670
gives an example of--I've never
heard of this person before,

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:24.813
but William Durr,
who was a financier in colonial

00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:31.340
America in the 1700s,
made a lot of money and helped

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:38.380
finance the Revolutionary War in
the United States.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.360
He ended up being chased down
the street by an angry mob.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.360
People hated him and why was
that?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.945
Well it was partly because he
got so rich and he started

00:34:50.945 --> 00:34:55.155
wanting to show off.
He had what they called "livery

00:34:55.155 --> 00:34:59.598
servants," not just servants,
but servants who were wearing

00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:05.407
livery, like a military uniform.
It looked like aristocracy

00:35:05.407 --> 00:35:12.986
coming back in the form of rich
financial successes and we don't

00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:16.050
like that.
There is a feeling of hostility

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.168
toward that.
There has been a long

00:35:19.168 --> 00:35:26.751
discussion about what people owe
each other and how okay it is to

00:35:26.751 --> 00:35:33.793
try to make money.
I don't know if you remember--I

00:35:33.793 --> 00:35:42.314
have to start erasing here--one
of the most well known Yale

00:35:42.314 --> 00:35:50.247
professors of the nineteenth
century was William Graham

00:35:50.247 --> 00:35:53.954
Sumner,
who wrote a famous piece

00:35:53.954 --> 00:35:58.329
called, What Social Classes
Owe to Each Other.

00:35:58.329 --> 00:36:03.719
Sumner graduated from Yale in
1863.

00:36:03.719 --> 00:36:06.910
He was a member of Skull and
Bones--have you heard of that?

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:10.603
You know that group?
He spent his entire career at

00:36:10.603 --> 00:36:14.106
Yale and he wrote--He was Head
of our social sciences

00:36:14.106 --> 00:36:16.735
department,
before we had separate

00:36:16.735 --> 00:36:20.260
departments of economics and
psychology, etc.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:26.163
He was a very prominent
exponent of the idea that people

00:36:26.163 --> 00:36:30.349
should go out for their own
interest.

00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:35.706
One social class does not owe
anything to another and we

00:36:35.706 --> 00:36:41.550
should not feel guilty about
pursuing financial interests.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:47.750
That led to an attitude among a
good segment of our society that

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:53.654
it's okay to go out and make
money because making money means

00:36:53.654 --> 00:36:59.559
doing productive things for the
economy and ultimately it's a

00:36:59.559 --> 00:37:02.020
benefit to society.

00:37:05.469 --> 00:37:07.530
But we have some discomfort
with that.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.789
Another book,
which I haven't put on reserve

00:37:17.789 --> 00:37:21.653
yet but I'm going to,
is by Peter Unger,

00:37:21.653 --> 00:37:26.730
who is a philosopher.
It's a remarkable book called

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:31.663
Living High and Letting
Die that refers to a more

00:37:31.663 --> 00:37:35.429
broad philosophical issue that
we have.

00:37:35.429 --> 00:37:41.088
It is that most of us are
really making money for

00:37:41.088 --> 00:37:47.926
ourselves--that's what we do
with our lives--and whether or

00:37:47.926 --> 00:37:54.099
not that is moral.
It's not just rich people who

00:37:54.099 --> 00:38:01.504
do that--the rest of us do it
also--and in Peter Unger's book

00:38:01.504 --> 00:38:07.696
he--On the first page,
he has an address and it's an

00:38:07.696 --> 00:38:12.624
address for UNICEF,
which is the United Nations

00:38:12.624 --> 00:38:17.371
Children's Fund,
and he starts out his book with

00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:21.920
that address where you could
send money right away.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.162
I thought it was very
impressive that he put that on

00:38:25.162 --> 00:38:28.786
page one of the book because it
puts the reader in a moral

00:38:28.786 --> 00:38:31.715
dilemma.
He points out that it's

00:38:31.715 --> 00:38:36.045
estimated that for every $3 you
send to UNICEF,

00:38:36.045 --> 00:38:40.831
you can save a life.
That's because there are people

00:38:40.831 --> 00:38:44.889
in this world who are not
getting medical care.

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:49.957
There are people who are dying
of diseases for which there are

00:38:49.957 --> 00:38:54.610
known cures because they don't
have the best medicine,

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.352
which are often not even
expensive but they're living in

00:38:57.352 --> 00:39:01.852
such poverty.
So he says, why don't you stop

00:39:01.852 --> 00:39:06.230
right now and send $100 to
UNICEF.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:11.123
It was very impactful to start
a book that way because I doubt

00:39:11.123 --> 00:39:16.257
that hardly any readers actually
write out a check on the spot to

00:39:16.257 --> 00:39:18.377
UNICEF;
but if you don't,

00:39:18.377 --> 00:39:22.454
then you are in some sense
responsible for the loss of 30

00:39:22.454 --> 00:39:25.891
lives.
It's quite striking and it

00:39:25.891 --> 00:39:32.309
helps you to reflect on what
makes us behave the way we do.

00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:37.763
By the way, when you go back to
your computer,

00:39:37.763 --> 00:39:43.216
Google UNICEF,
and you can give $100 to UNICEF

00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:47.645
within the hour.
Maybe I could ask for a show of

00:39:47.645 --> 00:39:49.909
hands of how many people did
that.

00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:54.443
I expect that not many of you
will and I don't think that

00:39:54.443 --> 00:39:58.086
proves that you are bad
people--this is a very

00:39:58.086 --> 00:40:02.538
interesting philosophical
question--but what it means is

00:40:02.538 --> 00:40:07.315
that there is a moral dilemma
underlying all of our economic

00:40:07.315 --> 00:40:12.172
lives and I think this moral
dilemma is the same as the moral

00:40:12.172 --> 00:40:16.711
dilemma in finance.
It's just that people in

00:40:16.711 --> 00:40:22.007
finance are sometimes very
successful and they could give a

00:40:22.007 --> 00:40:28.157
lot more than $100 to UNICEF.
One thing that I wanted to

00:40:28.157 --> 00:40:33.744
emphasize in this course,
or try to emphasize,

00:40:33.744 --> 00:40:40.199
is that part of finance is
actually philanthropy.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:45.401
The most important--The most
successful people in finance,

00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:50.694
I believe, end up giving the
money away and that means--you

00:40:50.694 --> 00:40:56.038
can't consume a billion dollars.
There's no way that you can do

00:40:56.038 --> 00:40:58.547
that.
You can only drive one car at a

00:40:58.547 --> 00:41:02.202
time and if you have five
cars--well I mean that's kind

00:41:02.202 --> 00:41:06.195
of--all right you could have
five cars and you could drive a

00:41:06.195 --> 00:41:09.816
different one everyday,
but it's starting to seem a

00:41:09.816 --> 00:41:11.480
little ridiculous,
right?

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.671
At any rate,
you're not using them and

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.869
they're going to end up being
used by somebody else.

00:41:16.869 --> 00:41:22.656
So I think the outcome should
be philanthropy and those of you

00:41:22.656 --> 00:41:27.400
who are successful really ought
to give it away.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:32.152
I'm bringing in outside
speakers as part of this course

00:41:32.152 --> 00:41:36.023
and, among them,
I'm going to bring in people

00:41:36.023 --> 00:41:39.719
who I think have been
philanthropists.

00:41:39.719 --> 00:41:45.068
That's the mode of thinking
that is most attractive when you

00:41:45.068 --> 00:41:49.742
think about financial markets.
So let me tell you about--I

00:41:49.742 --> 00:41:52.500
have slots now for four outside
speakers.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.453
I've lined up two of them and
let me tell you about the two

00:41:56.453 --> 00:42:01.730
that I've already lined up.
The first one is our own David

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.213
Swensen.
David Swensen came to Yale

00:42:06.213 --> 00:42:14.007
University in 1985 from Wall
Street, although he was a Yale

00:42:14.007 --> 00:42:19.336
graduate.
At that time the Yale endowment

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:25.210
was actually slightly under one
billion dollars.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:29.594
What is the endowment of Yale?
The endowment is defined as the

00:42:29.594 --> 00:42:33.050
financial assets that Yale
University owns.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.631
Yale also has an art
collection, which is worth many

00:42:36.631 --> 00:42:40.634
billions, but we don't count
that as part of the endowment

00:42:40.634 --> 00:42:45.057
because they will never sell it
so it doesn't provide income for

00:42:45.057 --> 00:42:47.469
us.
Yale also has a physical plant,

00:42:47.469 --> 00:42:49.881
like this beautiful building
that we're in,

00:42:49.881 --> 00:42:52.579
but that's not part of the
endowment either.

00:42:52.579 --> 00:42:56.034
The financial assets that Yale
had, at that time,

00:42:56.034 --> 00:43:02.067
were about one billion dollars.
Since then, David Swensen has

00:43:02.067 --> 00:43:09.508
invested or has managed the
investment of this endowment and

00:43:09.508 --> 00:43:16.506
it has done phenomenally well.
Yale now has over twenty-two

00:43:16.506 --> 00:43:19.949
billion dollars in its
endowment.

00:43:19.949 --> 00:43:31.177
The return he got from 1996 to
2006 was 17% a year on

00:43:31.177 --> 00:43:37.572
investments.
Last year the return on the

00:43:37.572 --> 00:43:42.070
Yale portfolio was 28% in one
year.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.945
Now I don't know how impressed
you are, the year before that it

00:43:45.945 --> 00:43:49.450
was 22% in one year.
Now some of this might be luck

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:53.215
but I don't think it's all luck
because he's done this

00:43:53.215 --> 00:43:57.154
consistently for so many years.
If you look up around this

00:43:57.154 --> 00:43:59.733
campus now, you'll see a lot of
construction,

00:43:59.733 --> 00:44:02.840
a lot of things are being
spruced up and improved.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.960
I think David Swensen has had a
big hand in doing that because

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.570
we have the money that makes it
possible.

00:44:15.179 --> 00:44:17.950
The endowment at Yale is
something like two million

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:21.387
dollars per student now that's
just sitting there as money that

00:44:21.387 --> 00:44:22.440
could be spent.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.844
How did he do this?
That's one of the amazing

00:44:28.844 --> 00:44:31.451
things.
It seems to have something to

00:44:31.451 --> 00:44:34.670
do, I think, with academic
understanding.

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:39.988
That being part of a university
community is a good thing for

00:44:39.988 --> 00:44:44.420
investing and you can see some
evidence in that.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.674
Harvard University,
Princeton University,

00:44:46.674 --> 00:44:49.774
and other universities have
done extremely well on their

00:44:49.774 --> 00:44:52.658
endowments;
however, not quite as well as

00:44:52.658 --> 00:44:53.933
Yale.
Yale, I think,

00:44:53.933 --> 00:44:57.713
is the number one performer so
it's very interesting that we're

00:44:57.713 --> 00:45:01.860
able--it's very significant that
we're able to get David Swensen.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.659
He doesn't do a lot of public
speaking but he is willing,

00:45:06.659 --> 00:45:11.287
for young people like you,
to do this--so that's one of

00:45:11.287 --> 00:45:15.157
our outside speakers.
He also has two books about

00:45:15.157 --> 00:45:19.951
investing that we'll talk about.
The second person I have set up

00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:25.226
now to come--although the date
on the syllabus online is going

00:45:25.226 --> 00:45:28.340
to be changed--is Andrew
Redleaf,

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:35.102
who is also a Yale graduate and
who set up a hedge fund called

00:45:35.102 --> 00:45:40.179
Whitebox Advisors.
It has done phenomenally well

00:45:40.179 --> 00:45:41.560
in investing.

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:51.022
I think--I have on the syllabus
a New York Times article about

00:45:51.022 --> 00:45:53.263
him.
He's a very original and

00:45:53.263 --> 00:45:57.847
creative thinker who looks at
things from a unique perspective

00:45:57.847 --> 00:46:01.679
and I find it very interesting
talking with him.

00:46:01.679 --> 00:46:04.784
To do well in investing you
have to have your own

00:46:04.784 --> 00:46:08.535
independent view of things and
really be thinking about how

00:46:08.535 --> 00:46:11.639
things work and he is someone
who does that.

00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:14.833
Incidentally,
the New York Times had another

00:46:14.833 --> 00:46:18.621
article about Redleaf,
saying that he was really one

00:46:18.621 --> 00:46:23.077
of the first persons to clearly
delineate the subprime crisis

00:46:23.077 --> 00:46:26.396
that we're now in.
He saw it coming and,

00:46:26.396 --> 00:46:28.809
I have to say,
profited from it.

00:46:28.809 --> 00:46:32.471
If you know the subprime crisis
is coming, then there's always a

00:46:32.471 --> 00:46:35.320
way to profit from that and
that's what he did.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:41.660
But he also has a philanthropic
side so it all comes out very

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:47.158
well.
I think in the remaining time I

00:46:47.158 --> 00:46:56.676
will just go through an outline
of the course and that means go

00:46:56.676 --> 00:47:05.118
through the topics of the
various lectures and then I'll

00:47:05.118 --> 00:47:11.221
let you go for today.
So the way this course is

00:47:11.221 --> 00:47:16.119
divided up is different than the
Financial Theory course.

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:19.639
If you look at John
Geanakoplos's course on

00:47:19.639 --> 00:47:23.494
Financial Theory,
his mathematical concepts are

00:47:23.494 --> 00:47:26.929
central to his outline of the
course;

00:47:26.929 --> 00:47:30.127
but this being a Financial
Markets course,

00:47:30.127 --> 00:47:33.714
I'm dividing it up more in
terms of markets and

00:47:33.714 --> 00:47:37.758
institutions.
I still want to start with some

00:47:37.758 --> 00:47:42.757
theory and I thought that--well
I will--I plan to start by

00:47:42.757 --> 00:47:48.020
talking about the most basic
concepts of risk management,

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:52.809
which underlie finance.
That will be Wednesday's

00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:55.456
lecture.
I call it the universal

00:47:55.456 --> 00:47:59.329
principle of risk management
pooling and the hedging of risk.

00:47:59.329 --> 00:48:03.100
I think it's the most important
theoretical concept that

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.283
underlies finance and insurance,
which we'll also talk about a

00:48:07.283 --> 00:48:11.812
little bit in this course.
The idea is that if you spread

00:48:11.812 --> 00:48:15.849
risks they don't disappear,
they're still there,

00:48:15.849 --> 00:48:19.823
but they're spread out over
many people and the impact on

00:48:19.823 --> 00:48:23.766
any one person is reduced.
So a basic principle of

00:48:23.766 --> 00:48:29.380
insurance is that if each person
or each family suffers the risk,

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.210
for example,
that a parent,

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.590
father or mother,
might die then it is a terrible

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:37.969
blow to the family;
but it's not a blow to society

00:48:37.969 --> 00:48:41.548
as a whole because people die
and it has a certain statistical

00:48:41.548 --> 00:48:44.510
regularity.
It makes sense that we pay

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:49.367
families who have lost a father
or a mother so that they can

00:48:49.367 --> 00:48:53.219
keep going.
It benefits everyone to have a

00:48:53.219 --> 00:48:57.486
situation in place for that.
I wanted to talk about that

00:48:57.486 --> 00:49:01.044
with a little bit of reference
to probability theory and so

00:49:01.044 --> 00:49:05.030
that's what I will be covering.
The next lecture will be among

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:08.449
the more mathematical,
although it's very elementary.

00:49:08.449 --> 00:49:11.871
If you had a course in
probability and statistics,

00:49:11.871 --> 00:49:15.921
then you'll find it easy to
follow, but it's self-contained

00:49:15.921 --> 00:49:18.826
again.
I feel like I have to introduce

00:49:18.826 --> 00:49:22.813
concepts like variance and
co-variance and correlation in

00:49:22.813 --> 00:49:27.386
order to talk about finance;
so that's what we'll do in

00:49:27.386 --> 00:49:31.106
Lecture Two.
The following lecture--I want

00:49:31.106 --> 00:49:35.304
to come back to some basic
themes that--the third

00:49:35.304 --> 00:49:40.727
lecture--about technology and it
relates to another book that I

00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:44.125
wrote.
I'm not assigning it,

00:49:44.125 --> 00:49:50.388
but I wrote a book called
New Financial Order in

00:49:50.388 --> 00:49:54.679
2003 about technology and
finance.

00:49:54.679 --> 00:49:58.616
A theme of that book was
that--I've already said this to

00:49:58.616 --> 00:50:02.910
you, but it's a very important
point--financial technology is

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:07.204
evolving and improving just the
way engineering technology or

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:10.210
biochemical technology is
improving.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:16.192
It's getting better year by
year and the course of finance

00:50:16.192 --> 00:50:20.179
over your lifetime will be
dramatic,

00:50:20.179 --> 00:50:23.838
so the financial institutions
that we have ten years from now

00:50:23.838 --> 00:50:27.070
will look very different from
the ones we have now.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.496
We have to understand--in
understanding the progress of

00:50:35.496 --> 00:50:39.271
financial technology--is its
fundamental relation to

00:50:39.271 --> 00:50:42.918
information technology.
Computers, the Internet,

00:50:42.918 --> 00:50:46.558
and communication devices are
fundamental to financial

00:50:46.558 --> 00:50:50.747
progress and they make things
possible that wouldn't have been

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:54.126
possible before.
Oftentimes, inventions that

00:50:54.126 --> 00:50:57.355
seem, in the abstract,
to be good ideas may be

00:50:57.355 --> 00:51:01.516
impossible because something
that you have to do to make it

00:51:01.516 --> 00:51:05.748
actually come into practice is
too expensive and so it's not

00:51:05.748 --> 00:51:08.690
economic to produce the
invention.

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:14.388
But then developments in other
fields can change the relative

00:51:14.388 --> 00:51:20.276
prices and suddenly make an idea
that had been hypothetical and

00:51:20.276 --> 00:51:26.299
unapplied suddenly work well.
So financial inventions also

00:51:26.299 --> 00:51:30.562
involve experimentation.
Like in any other invention,

00:51:30.562 --> 00:51:34.168
nobody knows what will work and
abstract theory doesn't guide

00:51:34.168 --> 00:51:35.250
you completely.

00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:44.781
Once an invention is seen to
work it is rapidly copied around

00:51:44.781 --> 00:51:48.170
the world.
We can see various breaks in

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:52.906
financial history when some new
idea was suddenly proven

00:51:52.906 --> 00:51:54.841
workable.
Traditionally,

00:51:54.841 --> 00:51:58.126
financial inventions were not
granted patent rights,

00:51:58.126 --> 00:52:01.475
but now in the United States
and in a number of other

00:52:01.475 --> 00:52:05.920
countries it has become possible
to patent financial inventions.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:13.057
I know I've done that in my
life and so I think it gives a

00:52:13.057 --> 00:52:17.440
different perspective on
finance.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.720
Then I want to talk about
insurance.

00:52:27.159 --> 00:52:31.859
The institution of insurance is
something that really came

00:52:31.859 --> 00:52:36.476
in--it's one of the earliest--I
consider it a division of

00:52:36.476 --> 00:52:41.093
finance--really came in the
1600s when probability theory

00:52:41.093 --> 00:52:44.384
was invented.
The mathematical theory of

00:52:44.384 --> 00:52:48.298
probability was unknown until
that time and you can see that

00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:51.880
insurance suddenly made an
appearance at that time.

00:52:58.619 --> 00:53:03.524
This will be an historical as
well as a theoretical discussion

00:53:03.524 --> 00:53:07.709
of insurance.
Then I will move to portfolio

00:53:07.709 --> 00:53:13.360
diversification and supporting
financial institutions.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.909
This is again a more
theoretical lecture.

00:53:17.909 --> 00:53:20.889
It will be about the capital
asset pricing model.

00:53:20.889 --> 00:53:26.381
It will be about the securities
market line, about the beta,

00:53:26.381 --> 00:53:31.258
about the mutual fund theorem,
and it will also be about

00:53:31.258 --> 00:53:35.966
institutions that we have--about
investment companies and their

00:53:35.966 --> 00:53:38.622
management.
So it's really parallel to an

00:53:38.622 --> 00:53:42.902
insurance discussion.
Insurance pools risks like life

00:53:42.902 --> 00:53:48.055
risks or fire risks by writing
policies to individual

00:53:48.055 --> 00:53:51.932
policyholders.
Portfolio management pools

00:53:51.932 --> 00:53:56.317
risks in a different way:
by assembling a diversified

00:53:56.317 --> 00:54:01.293
portfolio or a portfolio that's
negatively correlated with a

00:54:01.293 --> 00:54:05.907
risk that someone has.
Then I want to go to the

00:54:05.907 --> 00:54:12.473
efficient markets theory.
"Efficient markets" is a theory

00:54:12.473 --> 00:54:18.719
about--well it came in about
three decades ago,

00:54:18.719 --> 00:54:23.351
maybe it's closer to four
decades ago--it's a theory that

00:54:23.351 --> 00:54:28.645
financial markets work very well
and incorporate information very

00:54:28.645 --> 00:54:30.986
well.
The efficient markets

00:54:30.986 --> 00:54:34.256
hypothesis was
encouraged--actually the idea

00:54:34.256 --> 00:54:38.742
goes back over 100 years--it's
encouraged by the observation

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:43.381
that financial markets seem to
respond with great speed to new

00:54:43.381 --> 00:54:46.817
information and,
when new information appears,

00:54:46.817 --> 00:54:49.960
prices will suddenly adjust in
the financial markets.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.793
Certain kinds of financial
markets called "prediction

00:54:52.793 --> 00:54:54.699
markets," which may,
for example,

00:54:54.699 --> 00:54:58.366
predict the outcome of an
election have been seen to be

00:54:58.366 --> 00:55:03.069
very accurate predictors,
often better than pollsters can

00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:06.965
manage.
So there seems to be some deep

00:55:06.965 --> 00:55:11.111
wisdom of the market.
I think that "efficient

00:55:11.111 --> 00:55:13.820
markets" is an important
concept.

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:18.996
On the other hand--and this is
something that I want to

00:55:18.996 --> 00:55:24.461
emphasize--you don't want to
carry that too far and one of

00:55:24.461 --> 00:55:29.829
the lessons of behavioral
finance is that markets are not

00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:33.760
really efficient in a global
sense.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.679
Human psychology drives markets
a great deal.

00:55:37.679 --> 00:55:42.007
If markets were perfectly
efficient, David Swensen could

00:55:42.007 --> 00:55:46.795
not have done what he did.
It would not be possible to

00:55:46.795 --> 00:55:52.129
make excess returns in finance.
I believe it's clear that it is

00:55:52.129 --> 00:55:56.521
and that people who do so are
people who understand more than

00:55:56.521 --> 00:55:59.230
the core efficient markets
theory.

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:03.243
They understand something about
human nature and how human

00:56:03.243 --> 00:56:06.130
nature interacts with our
institutions.

00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:11.265
The next lecture is about
behavioral finance and I want to

00:56:11.265 --> 00:56:16.039
talk in that lecture about
research and psychology,

00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:18.872
things that come out of another
department here,

00:56:18.872 --> 00:56:22.969
the psychology department,
which has traditionally been

00:56:22.969 --> 00:56:27.530
ignored in economics and finance
but is coming back.

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:32.639
I want to talk about Kahneman
and Tversky's Prospect Theory,

00:56:32.639 --> 00:56:38.009
which is a very important and a
little technical--psychologists

00:56:38.009 --> 00:56:42.340
can become mathematical and
technical as well.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.657
It'll be an important part of
our understanding of financial

00:56:45.657 --> 00:56:48.935
markets.
Then I want to talk in the next

00:56:48.935 --> 00:56:53.053
lecture about regulation,
which means government

00:56:53.053 --> 00:56:57.695
oversight of financial markets
and not just government

00:56:57.695 --> 00:57:01.050
oversight,
there are also the so-called

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:04.838
self-regulatory organizations
that are created in the

00:57:04.838 --> 00:57:07.679
financial industry to self
regulate.

00:57:07.679 --> 00:57:10.479
So, for example,
FINRA, which used to be called

00:57:10.479 --> 00:57:13.400
The National Association for
Security Dealers,

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.884
is a membership organization of
people in the financial

00:57:17.884 --> 00:57:21.869
community and it imposes rules
on its members.

00:57:21.869 --> 00:57:24.846
It's not a government
organization but it is a

00:57:24.846 --> 00:57:25.640
regulator.

00:57:28.769 --> 00:57:33.491
The problem is that not
everyone is nice and not

00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:39.117
everyone is high-minded so
financial markets--the success

00:57:39.117 --> 00:57:43.236
of financial markets is,
in many ways,

00:57:43.236 --> 00:57:47.333
a success of regulation.
Governments establish

00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:51.705
regulators who set down rules
for participants in financial

00:57:51.705 --> 00:57:56.303
markets and these rules may be
perceived as onerous and costly

00:57:56.303 --> 00:57:59.469
to people in the financial
community,

00:57:59.469 --> 00:58:03.171
but ultimately it's their
salvation and it's what makes

00:58:03.171 --> 00:58:07.976
everything possible.
After that, I want to talk

00:58:07.976 --> 00:58:13.755
about the debt markets.
Debt is the simplest of

00:58:13.755 --> 00:58:19.272
financial instruments.
It consists of a promise to

00:58:19.272 --> 00:58:24.941
pay, usually denominated in
currency, and there are both

00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:29.579
long-term and short-term debt
instruments.

00:58:29.579 --> 00:58:33.021
The shortest term debt
instrument in the United States

00:58:33.021 --> 00:58:37.555
is the Federal Funds Rate,
which is an overnight rate--one

00:58:37.555 --> 00:58:42.634
day maturity--and the longest
issued by the Government is a

00:58:42.634 --> 00:58:47.557
thirty-year government bond,
which will be repaid three

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:51.128
decades in the future.
There have also been one

00:58:51.128 --> 00:58:54.838
hundred-year bonds and there
have also been perpetuities

00:58:54.838 --> 00:58:56.903
that--in the UK,
for example,

00:58:56.903 --> 00:59:00.689
the British Consoles--have no
expiration date and they have

00:59:00.689 --> 00:59:05.469
infinite maturity.
So the debt market is something

00:59:05.469 --> 00:59:11.960
worthy of studying because it
really represents a market for

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.052
time itself.
What is it that we're talking

00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:17.389
about when we talk about the
rate of interest?

00:59:17.389 --> 00:59:21.462
It has units of time,
it represents the price of

00:59:21.462 --> 00:59:26.313
time, and it is something that
fluctuates through time in

00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:31.732
interesting patterns.
They are very important drivers

00:59:31.732 --> 00:59:37.607
of our economy and our lives.
The theory of the term

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:45.168
structure is the theory of how
interest rates differ according

00:59:45.168 --> 00:59:50.116
to maturity or term.
There are not only debt

00:59:50.116 --> 00:59:55.493
instruments that are payable in
currency, but there are also

00:59:55.493 --> 01:00:00.870
indexed debt instruments that
are indexed to the price level

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:04.789
so that they give real interest
rates.

01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:08.710
We've had episodes in our
history when real interest rates

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:13.042
have made major moves and these
movements are very important for

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:18.049
what is happening in our lives.
Most recently--A few years ago,

01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:23.079
we were living in a regime of
negative real interest rates,

01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:27.530
when the Fed was pursuing a
very aggressive monetary policy.

01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:31.532
I suspect that with the
subprime crisis the Fed will be

01:00:31.532 --> 01:00:36.277
pushing real interest rates down
dramatically again and we may be

01:00:36.277 --> 01:00:40.280
in a period of negative real
interest rates again.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.741
After that I want to talk about
the stock market and I want

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:48.890
to--there's a lot to talk about.
Of course, stocks are shares in

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:54.728
companies and they're traded on
stock exchanges and they're

01:00:54.728 --> 01:01:00.566
interesting to analyze because
there's sort of an ambiguity

01:01:00.566 --> 01:01:07.210
about stocks that is not widely
perceived by a lot of people.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:12.772
That is, share repurchase can
change the units of measurement

01:01:12.772 --> 01:01:18.241
in a security and companies have
to decide how leveraged the

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:21.424
stock will be,
which changes the stock

01:01:21.424 --> 01:01:24.123
price--leverage,
meaning how much debt the

01:01:24.123 --> 01:01:27.512
company takes on.
Moreover, companies have to

01:01:27.512 --> 01:01:31.119
decide how much dividends to pay
on the stock.

01:01:31.119 --> 01:01:34.848
That's a decision of the
management of the company and we

01:01:34.848 --> 01:01:38.776
have to understand how they make
that decision and what that

01:01:38.776 --> 01:01:41.640
means to people who are valuing
stocks.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.985
It's a very simple idea.
The idea of dividing a company

01:01:44.985 --> 01:01:48.568
up into shares and selling them
off, but in practice it involves

01:01:48.568 --> 01:01:51.921
a lot of complexities.
We'll be talking about the

01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:56.304
Modigliani-Miller Theorem and
related issues in this lecture

01:01:56.304 --> 01:02:00.911
as well as something about the
behavior of the stock market and

01:02:00.911 --> 01:02:04.699
its tendency to go through
dramatic movements.

01:02:04.699 --> 01:02:07.669
For example,
like it has done recently if

01:02:07.669 --> 01:02:11.010
you've been following it earlier
this year.

01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:15.976
The next lecture will be about
real estate and that brings us

01:02:15.976 --> 01:02:20.943
into the subprime crisis and
connects with interests that are

01:02:20.943 --> 01:02:26.893
central to my own thinking.
The housing market is a huge

01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:30.666
market.
Right now the total value of

01:02:30.666 --> 01:02:36.180
single-family homes in the
United States is about twenty

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:42.295
trillion dollars and the market
has been becoming increasingly

01:02:42.295 --> 01:02:46.509
speculative.
Home prices have become

01:02:46.509 --> 01:02:50.744
unstable.
Nationally, home prices in the

01:02:50.744 --> 01:02:57.139
United States rose 85% between
1997 and 2006 in real terms--in

01:02:57.139 --> 01:03:02.107
inflation-corrected terms.
We've seen almost a doubling in

01:03:02.107 --> 01:03:05.340
the price of the average home in
the United States.

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.545
Why did that happen?
Now they are falling and in

01:03:09.545 --> 01:03:15.567
real terms home prices have
fallen almost 10% since the peak

01:03:15.567 --> 01:03:18.687
in 2006.
This is not just a U.S.

01:03:18.687 --> 01:03:22.569
phenomenon;
many countries around the world

01:03:22.569 --> 01:03:27.972
are experiencing home price
booms and the beginnings of what

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:33.925
might be a home price bust.
I want to consider the market

01:03:33.925 --> 01:03:39.672
for homes and the market for
mortgages, which are the

01:03:39.672 --> 01:03:45.787
instruments that finance homes.
To what extent was the housing

01:03:45.787 --> 01:03:50.423
boom that we saw in recent years
the result of revolution in

01:03:50.423 --> 01:03:54.240
financial technology?
There have been many changes in

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.038
our mortgage institutions that
might be part of the reason for

01:03:58.038 --> 01:04:02.525
the boom in home prices.
There's also a question of

01:04:02.525 --> 01:04:07.628
psychology.
The following lecture will be

01:04:07.628 --> 01:04:13.013
about banking,
the supply of money and the

01:04:13.013 --> 01:04:17.249
money multiplier.
It's also about:

01:04:17.249 --> 01:04:20.663
how banks operate;
what their function is in our

01:04:20.663 --> 01:04:22.659
society;
and, why they are such

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:27.037
important institutions that have
gone back for hundreds of years

01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:30.026
and remain powerful,
central features in our

01:04:30.026 --> 01:04:32.682
economy.
It's also about bank

01:04:32.682 --> 01:04:37.940
regulation, such as the Basel
Accord, Basel I and Basel II.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:42.391
I also want to talk about the
impact of information and

01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:46.380
technology on banking.
The following lecture is about

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.500
monetary policy.
What do central banks do?

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.983
In the United States,
the central bank is called the

01:04:52.983 --> 01:04:55.129
Federal Reserve.
In the United Kingdom,

01:04:55.129 --> 01:04:58.079
it's the Bank of England.
In Japan, it's the Bank of

01:04:58.079 --> 01:04:59.842
Japan.
And in Europe,

01:04:59.842 --> 01:05:05.593
it's the European Central Bank.
All of these banks are really

01:05:05.593 --> 01:05:09.920
in control of short-term
interest rates and these

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:15.058
interest rates are used to try
to manage and stabilize the

01:05:15.058 --> 01:05:17.855
economy.
In response to the subprime

01:05:17.855 --> 01:05:20.445
crisis that we are now in,
our central bank,

01:05:20.445 --> 01:05:23.558
the Federal Reserve,
has been cutting interest rates

01:05:23.558 --> 01:05:26.735
aggressively to try to save the
economy that appears to be

01:05:26.735 --> 01:05:30.653
declining.
I want to try to understand in

01:05:30.653 --> 01:05:36.295
that lecture--help us to
understand how this works and

01:05:36.295 --> 01:05:41.511
how we're getting
solutions--possible solutions to

01:05:41.511 --> 01:05:45.067
these problems.
Then I want to talk about

01:05:45.067 --> 01:05:47.604
investment banking.
An investment bank is a

01:05:47.604 --> 01:05:50.210
different kind of bank.
I was talking,

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:53.659
up to this point,
about commercial banks.

01:05:53.659 --> 01:05:57.880
An investment bank is not a
bank that accepts deposits;

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.849
it doesn't deal with the
general public.

01:06:00.849 --> 01:06:04.938
Instead it deals with financial
institutions and it gets

01:06:04.938 --> 01:06:08.506
involved in underwriting
securities for financial

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:11.923
institutions.
It's a very important industry

01:06:11.923 --> 01:06:16.590
and it's also one in which many
of our students have found jobs,

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:20.529
so I think it's important for
us to try to understand the

01:06:20.529 --> 01:06:24.598
history of investment banks,
the role they have in our

01:06:24.598 --> 01:06:28.360
financial community,
and how they're regulated.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:32.587
Then I want to talk about money
managers--professional money

01:06:32.587 --> 01:06:35.309
managers--people like David
Swensen.

01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:39.935
This is a community of people
in a different segment of the

01:06:39.935 --> 01:06:42.766
financial industry.
These are people who manage

01:06:42.766 --> 01:06:43.280
portfolios.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.611
We want to think about what
kinds of forces operate on them

01:06:53.611 --> 01:06:58.214
and what kind of--I'm interested
in viewing them partly as people

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:02.530
who are experts in a certain
kind of technology who live in a

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:06.917
very competitive environment and
try to understand why some of

01:07:06.917 --> 01:07:10.010
them succeed much more than
others.

01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:12.679
It also relates to behavioral
finance.

01:07:12.679 --> 01:07:18.030
That is, ultimately they are
human beings like anyone else

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:23.850
and some of their differences in
success or failure may have to

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:28.262
do with their own
interconnections and their own

01:07:28.262 --> 01:07:32.579
psychology and interpersonal
psychology.

01:07:32.579 --> 01:07:35.030
Then I want to talk about
brokerages.

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:40.117
Those are institutions that
arrange for or manage the buying

01:07:40.117 --> 01:07:45.119
and selling of financial assets,
such as the New York Stock

01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:48.361
Exchange.
Now the brokerage industry--The

01:07:48.361 --> 01:07:51.920
New York Stock Exchange goes
back into the eighteenth

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.032
century, it's very old.
In fact, the idea of the stock

01:07:56.032 --> 01:07:59.610
exchange goes back to the
fourteenth century,

01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:04.211
when in Flanders the first
stock exchange called The Bourse

01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:07.741
was established.
So it goes back many hundreds

01:08:07.741 --> 01:08:11.146
of years but it's in rapid
change now because of

01:08:11.146 --> 01:08:15.771
information technology.
It's one of the most rapidly

01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:21.841
changing, hard to keep up with
areas because someone can set up

01:08:21.841 --> 01:08:27.910
an electronic exchange overnight
and suddenly become a base for

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:32.609
trading trillions of dollars of
securities.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:37.459
It fits in well with the theme
of this course about technology

01:08:37.459 --> 01:08:42.229
because in understanding what's
happening with brokerages,

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:45.839
our technology,
the new information technology,

01:08:45.839 --> 01:08:49.753
is central.
Then I want to move to futures

01:08:49.753 --> 01:08:54.858
markets and forward markets.
A forward contract is a

01:08:54.858 --> 01:09:00.176
contract made between two
parties for execution in the

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:03.082
future.
Generally these are called

01:09:03.082 --> 01:09:07.033
over-the-counter contracts
because they're not arranged

01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:10.557
through exchanges.
We also have standardized

01:09:10.557 --> 01:09:15.010
contracts that are traded on
exchanges and they're called

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:18.877
futures contracts.
The futures contracts were

01:09:18.877 --> 01:09:24.115
invented in Japan in the 1600s
at Osaka and they were developed

01:09:24.115 --> 01:09:28.491
for the rice market in Japan.
They were uniquely Japanese

01:09:28.491 --> 01:09:32.082
until pretty much the nineteenth
century and then they were

01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:35.550
copied all over the world and
are now very important.

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:40.056
I'm going to talk about one
futures market that I have been

01:09:40.056 --> 01:09:43.771
instrumental in developing.
I've been working with the

01:09:43.771 --> 01:09:46.976
Chicago Mercantile Exchange to
create a futures market for

01:09:46.976 --> 01:09:49.928
single-family homes,
which is sort of my connection

01:09:49.928 --> 01:09:52.856
to the futures industry.
Of course, there are many

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:55.270
futures markets that we'll talk
about.

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:59.197
They're very interesting to me
and I wonder why the business

01:09:59.197 --> 01:10:01.659
community isn't more aware of
them.

01:10:01.659 --> 01:10:05.674
A futures market has a
prediction going out years into

01:10:05.674 --> 01:10:09.462
the future of what every
financial variable will be

01:10:09.462 --> 01:10:11.982
doing,
so you can see the future in a

01:10:11.982 --> 01:10:13.979
sense through the futures
prices.

01:10:13.979 --> 01:10:17.342
It's not always correct to
think of it that way--we have to

01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:19.720
get into the theory of futures
markets.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.266
In many cases that is not the
right way to think about futures

01:10:24.266 --> 01:10:28.067
prices, but there are very
important futures markets

01:10:28.067 --> 01:10:32.762
that--In the next lecture I want
to talk about the various kinds

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:37.377
of futures markets that matter.
We have a stock index futures

01:10:37.377 --> 01:10:40.579
market and notably we have an
oil futures market.

01:10:40.579 --> 01:10:46.011
The oil futures market is very
significant because it

01:10:46.011 --> 01:10:52.069
represents the price of energy
on dates into the future.

01:10:52.069 --> 01:10:56.170
We can now see the price of oil
going out years into the future.

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:59.439
We've just hit $100 barrel
price of oil,

01:10:59.439 --> 01:11:03.505
but what does that mean?
Does that mean we're going to

01:11:03.505 --> 01:11:07.403
live in a world with $100 oil?
Well not if you look at the

01:11:07.403 --> 01:11:10.473
futures market,
which is in backwardation now

01:11:10.473 --> 01:11:14.310
and it's predicting major drops
in the price of oil.

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.204
Then I want to talk about
options markets--this is getting

01:11:17.204 --> 01:11:21.388
close to the end of the course.
An option is the right to buy

01:11:21.388 --> 01:11:23.826
something.
Typically, we think of it as a

01:11:23.826 --> 01:11:27.380
stock option.
An option is a contract that

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:32.079
says you can buy so many shares
of a company.

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:35.934
The options have been traded
for several decades,

01:11:35.934 --> 01:11:40.029
starting with the Chicago Board
Options Exchange.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.140
But now there are many options
exchanges.

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:47.180
We have prices of options that
change minute by minute.

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:50.029
Now what do these changes and
these prices mean?

01:11:50.029 --> 01:11:56.219
The options are a very useful
technology for managing risks

01:11:56.219 --> 01:12:01.769
and I think that we'll see a
rapid--Over the next few

01:12:01.769 --> 01:12:04.960
decades,
we'll see rapid expansion in

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.779
the scope of options contracts
traded on the exchanges.

01:12:08.779 --> 01:12:12.556
Finally, for the last lecture
for this semester,

01:12:12.556 --> 01:12:17.378
I want to pull this together
and talk about one of the themes

01:12:17.378 --> 01:12:21.636
that is summarized in terms of a
theme of this course:

01:12:21.636 --> 01:12:27.063
the democratization of finance.
Finance used to be a very

01:12:27.063 --> 01:12:32.951
esoteric field that only a few
people in London and Paris and

01:12:32.951 --> 01:12:37.857
other world centers
understood--Amsterdam and other

01:12:37.857 --> 01:12:42.764
places where financial
technology emerged--but it's

01:12:42.764 --> 01:12:48.029
becoming democratized.
With each year that goes by the

01:12:48.029 --> 01:12:52.166
concepts of finance are being
applied more broadly and

01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:56.931
involving more and more people.
With electronic technology,

01:12:56.931 --> 01:13:01.702
it's becoming more economical
to offer sophisticated financial

01:13:01.702 --> 01:13:05.415
services to everyone.
This is something that we're

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:08.008
seeing.
I think the subprime crisis

01:13:08.008 --> 01:13:12.297
that is the current financial
crisis highlights this very

01:13:12.297 --> 01:13:15.310
well.
What does subprime mean?

01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:19.779
Well I think it stands for the
general population.

01:13:19.779 --> 01:13:23.906
The subprime mortgage market
was bringing people into the

01:13:23.906 --> 01:13:27.960
mortgage market who in prior
decades would not have been

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.350
involved--would not have had any
mortgage.

01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:33.424
The problem,
of course, with the

01:13:33.424 --> 01:13:36.770
democratization of finance is
that if you raise the

01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:39.380
participation in financial
markets,

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.642
then you bring in people who
are: less and less

01:13:41.642 --> 01:13:44.382
knowledgeable;
less and less understanding of

01:13:44.382 --> 01:13:48.155
concepts of finance;
and less capable and more

01:13:48.155 --> 01:13:52.518
vulnerable to exploitation.
So the democratization of

01:13:52.518 --> 01:13:55.923
finance is, I think,
the ultimate mission of--I find

01:13:55.923 --> 01:13:59.994
central to this course but it
brings with it dangerous hazards

01:13:59.994 --> 01:14:04.000
and we have to think very
carefully about how we do it.

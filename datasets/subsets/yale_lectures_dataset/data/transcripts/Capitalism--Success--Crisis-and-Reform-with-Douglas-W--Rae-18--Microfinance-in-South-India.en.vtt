00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.720
Prof: Today's case,
SELCO SEWA,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:19.290
is a wonderful transition to
Collier's Bottom Billion

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.779
and a--
I want to start with some

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.390
frameworks and I'm going to do
these briefly.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.930
I'll post them this evening so
you can look back at them.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.459
I want to introduce--these are
very standard MBA-ish,

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:36.640
shorthand frameworks for
thinking about cases.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.496
You heard, I think most of
this, but I should rub it in a

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:40.910
bit.
 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.550
One is called SWOT,
and this one has really no

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.301
analytical content to it,
it's just a way of organizing

00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:58.554
your thoughts on a topic,
strengths, weaknesses,

00:00:58.554 --> 00:01:01.048
opportunities,
threat.

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:05.096
In the temporal dimension
typically the strengths and

00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:09.611
weaknesses are things which are
immediately present in your

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.468
situation,
and the opportunities and

00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:19.384
threats are things you might
have happen to you or might

00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:21.319
cause to occur.
 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:27.668
A lot of back of the envelope
thinking about business cases is

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:30.790
organized in this shorthand.
 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.989
You might make yourself a grid
like,

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:38.209
this and let the column heading
be SWOT,

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:45.060
and then let the row headings
be whatever you choose,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.720
but one candidate is the Porter
forces,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.720
which we've seen before.
 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.596
How fierce is the direct
competition in your business

00:01:56.596 --> 00:02:00.995
from other people doing more or
less exactly what you do and

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:03.680
trying to do it better than you?
 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.516
What's the threat that others
not now doing it will enter the

00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:09.818
business and increase
competition?

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:15.834
How likely is it that people
will find substitutes for your

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:20.085
whole industry,
that your industry will be

00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:24.128
undermined by an adjacent
industry?

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:32.770
I could tell--I was able to
determine which letter it was.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.068
Can you hold that up and tell
us what it's about?

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:48.340
Student: 
&gt;

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.514
crimes of sexual violence that
are inflicted upon civilians as

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:56.568
a result of the mineral
conflict,

00:02:56.568 --> 00:03:00.753
such as copper and coltan,
which were frequently found in

00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:03.828
our own devices such as iPods,
cell phones,

00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:06.870
and cameras so just trying to
draw attention to the crisis.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.128
Prof: Terrific.
 

00:03:09.128 --> 00:03:13.990
It's certainly an eye-catching
accessory as you walk in.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.139
The threat of substitution then
the power of your suppliers in

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.568
the SELCO case,
think about where you're buying

00:03:23.568 --> 00:03:29.479
the basic components of these
generation and lighting systems.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:35.419
If there's only a limited
number of sources,

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.328
or perhaps even just one
source, then they're in a

00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:42.199
position to squeeze you on
price,

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.080
and that's an important
strategic consideration.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.760
Buyers;
if buyers have a lot of

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.858
leverage, or as in the SELCO
case, not a lot of money,

00:03:54.858 --> 00:04:00.340
then buyers become a central
point of strategic focus.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.908
You could, if you wanted,
and I often do this,

00:04:04.908 --> 00:04:08.628
you could combine SWOT across
the top with supply--

00:04:08.628 --> 00:04:18.300
with Porter in the rows so that
if you take potential entrants,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.329
threat of entry,
your strengths might be that

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.430
there's no money to be made in
this field,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.269
so not many people are going to
want to do it,

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:29.665
or it might be that there are
huge switching costs so that

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.170
once people have bought your
equipment,

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.295
it is very difficult for them
to switch to other people's

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:37.180
equipment.
 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.079
The weakness might be that
you're making money,

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:45.314
and that the Financial
Times just ran a large

00:04:45.314 --> 00:04:49.300
article about how lucrative your
business is,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.379
which is likely to attract the
attention of others.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:59.064
Opportunities;
perhaps--how is barriers to

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:02.319
entry an opportunity?
 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:07.250
Perhaps you can build pricing
advantages--

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.403
if you increase the scale of
your operation your unit costs

00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:17.379
may get low enough that whenever
a new entrant comes,

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.990
you can crush him with low
prices.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:28.285
Threat;
similarly, somebody else may

00:05:28.285 --> 00:05:33.283
jump in and get the higher scale
of production much lower unit

00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:35.170
costs and crush you.
 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:41.519
You can walk all the way
through the twenty cells there,

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:46.240
but it--frameworks like this
are meant to be useful and when

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.834
they're useful they--
you use them,

00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:52.208
and if there's a particular
cell here that doesn't make any

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:55.538
sense,
you just put an X through it

00:05:55.538 --> 00:05:56.620
and go on.
 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.387
Another concept that we've used
briefly and it gets to be

00:06:01.387 --> 00:06:06.240
important in cases like SELCO is
vertical integration,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.300
which I've drawn horizontally,
as almost everyone else does.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.910
The rough idea here is that on
the left is the supply of raw

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.839
materials, and then making of
the product;

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.649
its assembly,
its distribution and sale all

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:25.920
the way out here.
 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.160
The sale end is called the
forward part of integration,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.660
so forward integration.
 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.964
The raw materials and
intermediate products is called

00:06:34.964 --> 00:06:38.774
backward integration,
and so defying all logic,

00:06:38.774 --> 00:06:42.170
backward plus forward makes
vertical.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.170
Don't ask me how that came
about.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:51.490
Behind that process,
which we think of in very

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.889
physical terms,
is an intellectual and

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:00.877
managerial layer,
which starts not with raw

00:07:00.877 --> 00:07:03.110
materials but with a business
plan,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.026
and a product design,
and the assembly of a

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:10.430
management team,
and the creation of channels

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.180
for distributing the product.
 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.413
Again, left to right,
and if you think about the

00:07:17.413 --> 00:07:24.319
SELCO case--where's their main
focus on this arrow at SELCO?

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.610
What are they mostly paying
attention too?

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:35.610
Back left, you got to shout if
you don't have a microphone.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.843
Student:  They--most of
their staff is focused on

00:07:39.843 --> 00:07:42.769
distribution and sales within
India.

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:47.642
Prof: Okay,
absolutely, so the forward

00:07:47.642 --> 00:07:54.399
integration of SELCO is its most
obviously unusual feature.

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:58.706
They're reaching into very
difficult markets to do the

00:07:58.706 --> 00:08:02.524
sales and very awkward places to
do the service,

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.370
which has to go with the sales.
 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:11.228
If you look now at--another way
of looking at the backward to

00:08:11.228 --> 00:08:15.565
forward story,
it's--I reproduced what was

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:20.819
already there but then I've
added service out there.

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:25.415
It turns out that taking
responsibility for durable goods

00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:29.206
that you sell,
there's not much long term

00:08:29.206 --> 00:08:33.629
responsibility for toothbrushes
or toothpicks,

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:38.595
but there is a lot of service
responsibility for any form of

00:08:38.595 --> 00:08:41.092
machinery,
especially when people are

00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:43.899
going to organize their lives
around the machinery.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:52.162
The classic insight on--classic
example on this is on McCormick

00:08:52.162 --> 00:08:56.158
farm machinery in the 1800s.
 

00:08:56.158 --> 00:08:59.929
The brilliant thing they did,
which none of their competitors

00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:02.870
did,
was to manufacture only during

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.706
the winter season and use the
same people that were running

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:12.792
the manufacturing plant to be
servicing agents for the farmers

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:17.461
during the growing season so
that the advantage of buying

00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:21.879
their stuff had everything to do
with service.

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:26.073
Now think about the laptop in
front of you,

00:09:26.073 --> 00:09:29.470
take yours, is service an
issue?

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.259
Student:  Service,
like getting the service?

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:35.668
Prof: Well does it just
run forever and keep you happy?

00:09:35.668 --> 00:09:37.990
Student:  It sometimes
has problems.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.269
Prof: Okay and what do
you do?

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:42.350
Student:  I've sent it
off to the Mac Store.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.038
Prof: Okay,
or you call them up and talk to

00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:46.190
a so-called genius?
 

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.311
What a thought,
the "genius bar,"

00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:56.197
and Mac's competitive advantage
is partly the elegance of the

00:09:56.197 --> 00:09:59.927
equipment,
but a lot of it is that their

00:09:59.927 --> 00:10:03.428
servicing is way better than
anybody else's.

00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:08.975
Who's got a kind of computer
that service is hard to find

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:09.570
for?
 

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.048
You're all perfectly happy with
the support you get for your

00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:14.960
computers?
 

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.548
Well that's wonderful;
improbable, but wonderful.

00:10:21.548 --> 00:10:31.364
Okay, so you get with SELCO a
huge emphasis on the service end

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:34.259
of the business.
 

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:39.480
Okay now let's turn to the case
itself.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:45.109
There's an A part and a B part,
the B part is really kind of

00:10:45.109 --> 00:10:49.690
more like a teaching note than
an actual case.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:59.198
The focus is on a certain rural
part of India and on sales to

00:10:59.198 --> 00:11:08.548
people who are either in
business on a very small scale,

00:11:08.548 --> 00:11:13.312
entrepreneurs of some kind,
or householders in an area that

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:15.528
is off the electric grid.
 

00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:20.458
It's an interesting fact about
India that the electric grid is

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:23.450
highly problematic and
incomplete,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:29.625
and the first mass development
of wind turbines was actually

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:35.590
begun in India by a textiles
manufacturer who got tired of

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:42.080
all the down time in his
reliance on grid electric power,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:47.149
and started developing turbines
for his own use,

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:52.529
and then had the insight that
turbines were a more profitable

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:57.639
business then textiles for him
and switched altogether.

00:11:57.639 --> 00:12:03.080
It's now headquartered in
Denmark and it's a huge company.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:11.678
The alternatives to what these
guys are doing,

00:12:11.678 --> 00:12:14.889
the ones mentioned in the case
are the grid,

00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:19.067
Pico Hydro, and its very hard
for me to envision how you do

00:12:19.067 --> 00:12:21.658
distributed generation with
water.

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.918
Well anybody got a thought
about this?

00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:27.921
You live next to a running
stream and you build a little

00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:30.945
water wheel--
it's got to be something a

00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:35.821
little glitzier than that--
and wind turbine on a micro

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:36.470
scale.
 

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:44.740
Now what are the inherent
disadvantages of the distributed

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:51.558
generation strategy that SELCO
is engaged in?

00:12:51.558 --> 00:12:58.547
If you were looking at it from
a business point of view what

00:12:58.547 --> 00:13:04.470
would be factors that would
strike you as scary?

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:09.730
Yes.
 

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.078
Student:  Every time
they entered a new market they

00:13:13.078 --> 00:13:16.428
had to convince the financial
institution to finance their

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:19.720
products to the market that they
were catering too,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.298
so it was almost a barrier of
entry for them,

00:13:23.298 --> 00:13:26.577
because the kind of people they
wanted to sell their products

00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:29.801
too did not have the resources
and it was also a new concept

00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:32.782
that they were introducing,
because financing was never

00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:35.110
done with respect to energy
before in the country.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.649
Prof: Okay so one
problem that is inherent in the

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:44.604
market segment they choose to
serve is that you've got a twin

00:13:44.604 --> 00:13:48.320
door-to-door finance at the
micro level,

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.219
with door-to-door sale of the
generating equipment and the

00:13:53.219 --> 00:13:56.610
lighting equipment,
so that's one difficulty.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:07.558
Are there are any others?
 

00:14:07.558 --> 00:14:09.592
Student:  Some days
there's no sun,

00:14:09.592 --> 00:14:12.370
and then obviously a solar
system isn't going to work.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.484
Prof: There are--and
there are some seasons in which

00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:20.212
that happens repeatedly,
though in the part of India

00:14:20.212 --> 00:14:22.480
they're doing it,
it's a pretty sunny place.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:37.350
But--okay so that's a genuine
drawback, other thoughts?

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.096
Student:  Essentially
they're competing with the

00:14:41.096 --> 00:14:42.000
government.
 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.298
If the government chose to
expand the grid in the region

00:14:45.298 --> 00:14:48.418
they're doing business,
that would put their business

00:14:48.418 --> 00:14:50.519
plan at a decided disadvantage.
 

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:57.203
Prof: Okay there's a lot
said there, all in one elegant

00:14:57.203 --> 00:14:58.408
sentence.
 

00:14:58.408 --> 00:15:02.889
The biggest piece of it,
as I heard it,

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:10.200
was the threat that the grid
might expand into a given area.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.586
Why would people,
once the grid came--switch from

00:15:14.586 --> 00:15:18.058
SELCO's equipment to grid
equipment?

00:15:18.058 --> 00:15:26.152
Student:  Probably cost,
it's more efficient to generate

00:15:26.152 --> 00:15:33.200
electricity in a power plant
than in your own house.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.879
Prof: Okay and is there
a general concept here?

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:40.830
Student:  Economies of
scale.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.788
Prof: Economies of
scale, right?

00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:48.386
The whole point of centralized
generation is huge economies of

00:15:48.386 --> 00:15:54.094
scale so that if you--
if the grid is run reasonably

00:15:54.094 --> 00:16:00.378
efficiently it will time after
time trump distributed

00:16:00.378 --> 00:16:02.070
generation.
 

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:07.549
Why would we do this business?
 

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:09.720
What's the point?
 

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.616
Is this something that a
brilliant young reptile from The

00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:20.389
Harvard Business School is going
to jump in to make his fortune?

00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:25.129
Sasha what do you think?
 

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:26.529
Student:  No.
 

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:28.509
Prof: No, and why not?
 

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:30.778
Student:  I think there
are too many risks.

00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:36.850
Prof: Too many risks,
and how big an upside is there?

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.663
Student:  I'm not sure
how you would quantify the

00:16:39.663 --> 00:16:42.629
upside, but I'm not convinced
that it's huge enough to take

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:43.500
advantage of.
 

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.029
Prof: Okay.
 

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:46.879
Does anybody remember the
financing story for this?

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:51.139
What subsidies are required?
 

00:16:51.139 --> 00:20:32.340
Let's watch a little bit of
film and get further along with

00:20:32.340 --> 00:23:01.078
the actual story [video
17:00-23:00].

00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:08.299
Okay the--if you had to
summarize what was just said

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:15.380
there in twenty words or less,
what would it be?

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:22.368
Sasha?
 

00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:24.916
Student:  I think
ultimately they don't want to be

00:23:24.916 --> 00:23:27.054
a bottom line company,
that their mission is not

00:23:27.054 --> 00:23:28.009
purely financial.
 

00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:30.714
Prof: Okay,
now help people who don't talk

00:23:30.714 --> 00:23:33.759
bottom line counts to understand
what you just said.

00:23:33.759 --> 00:23:36.625
Student:  Some of you
talk about a double or a triple

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:39.589
bottom line and then you have
people who are looking at social

00:23:39.589 --> 00:23:42.212
returns and environmental
returns in addition to purely

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.380
financial returns.
 

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.029
Prof: Okay so--that's
terrific.

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:52.343
So heretofore we have talked as
if companies had one bottom line

00:23:52.343 --> 00:23:57.150
and their net results were
correctly reflected in a profit

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.088
and loss statement.
 

00:23:59.088 --> 00:24:06.551
What Sasha is suggesting is
that a firm like SELCO or a bank

00:24:06.551 --> 00:24:13.130
like SEWA thinks about more than
one bottom line,

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:21.496
and they want to say that some
net losses in the financial

00:24:21.496 --> 00:24:30.009
bottom line may be balanced and
overcompensated by gains in

00:24:30.009 --> 00:24:37.348
environmental territory or in
social services.

00:24:37.348 --> 00:24:47.713
This is capitalism hybridized
with non-profit service sector

00:24:47.713 --> 00:24:53.013
institutions;
SELCO and SEWA are neither of

00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:58.067
them, institutions which would
have been designed if you

00:24:58.067 --> 00:25:01.558
thought about just one bottom
line.

00:25:01.558 --> 00:25:08.067
The merit in them has to be
captured in social,

00:25:08.067 --> 00:25:14.009
and to some extent,
environmental terms.

00:25:14.009 --> 00:25:22.230
Now what's the market's message
to village India about the

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:30.018
availability of light and
electric current for purposes

00:25:30.018 --> 00:25:37.230
like running small machinery or
heating water?

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.190
What's the market say?
 

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:46.011
Yes, this is the case where
there's exactly,

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:51.970
as economists say,
an equilibrium outcome.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:56.009
What's--somebody got a hand up
over there, there we are.

00:25:56.009 --> 00:26:00.505
Student:  I mean for the
darkness area there's simply

00:26:00.505 --> 00:26:04.923
insufficient demand to justify
expanding the infrastructure

00:26:04.923 --> 00:26:08.200
drastically across much of rural
India.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.900
Prof: Okay all right,
so that's good.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.546
Adam Smith distinguishes
between total demand and what he

00:26:14.546 --> 00:26:16.240
called effective demand.
 

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.115
Total demand is how many people
put up their hands if you say

00:26:20.115 --> 00:26:21.990
would you like electricity.
 

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:28.606
Effective demand is people who
would do that and back it up

00:26:28.606 --> 00:26:33.970
with money, and effective demand
is very low.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:39.665
Now not only is it low but
overcoming it with a grid

00:26:39.665 --> 00:26:43.798
structure is inherently
difficult,

00:26:43.798 --> 00:26:47.825
because while there are some
customers capable of paying

00:26:47.825 --> 00:26:50.460
market rate for grid
electricity,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.294
the vast majority of customers
in many of these regions are

00:26:55.294 --> 00:26:59.796
below that income level and
could not afford any of the

00:26:59.796 --> 00:27:00.630
above.
 

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.304
In addition to that,
their poverty is reinforced by

00:27:04.304 --> 00:27:06.730
the absence of energy supplies.
 

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:11.875
If you don't have the energy
supplies to do small-scale

00:27:11.875 --> 00:27:17.861
production,
or to illuminate a market

00:27:17.861 --> 00:27:24.569
during evening hours,
or any of a hundred other such

00:27:24.569 --> 00:27:29.270
things,
the low level of commerce is

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:36.930
kept low by the absence of
efficient energy supplies.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.990
The justification for an
enterprise like this has

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:47.472
everything to do with finding a
way around the market

00:27:47.472 --> 00:27:53.781
equilibrium at zero,
which prevails in some of these

00:27:53.781 --> 00:27:54.730
places.
 

00:27:54.730 --> 00:28:02.130
There's another feature in the
film clip.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.730
What's the attitude toward
customers?

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:10.250
How does their attitude compare
with--well let's establish the

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.028
high end of the scale.
 

00:28:12.028 --> 00:28:16.570
How does Yale do it providing a
choice of courses for you to

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.109
take?
 

00:28:17.109 --> 00:28:21.940
Ridiculously well, right?
 

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.670
A third of Yale courses have
fewer than ten students;

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.910
think that over.
 

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.342
Imagine that you're brought a
cost accountant in here to look

00:28:32.342 --> 00:28:37.082
at Yale College,
20% of my brothers and sisters

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:42.440
on the faculty would be looking
for a job,

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.765
and the enormous wealth of the
institution is what makes this

00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:52.108
possible,
and it's a wonderful thing.

00:28:52.108 --> 00:28:59.255
Now if you were--now go back
to, what's your least favorite

00:28:59.255 --> 00:29:04.058
company that you deal with
routinely?

00:29:04.058 --> 00:29:09.019
Most of you have an unfavorite
company?

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:14.094
I see a good nod right back in
the sixth row,

00:29:14.094 --> 00:29:15.940
third seat in.
 

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.963
Student:  My least
favorite company ever is

00:29:17.963 --> 00:29:18.750
Connecticut Limo.
 

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:26.509
Prof: Okay Connecticut
Limo, dare I ask?

00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:30.855
Student:  They don't
give customers what they

00:29:30.855 --> 00:29:35.200
promise, they're always late,
they're too expensive,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.990
and they're mean.
 

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.618
Prof: Mean!
 

00:29:39.618 --> 00:29:41.630
Okay, anybody else got an
unfavorite?

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.819
Over here--
Student:  McDonald's.

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:52.569
Prof: McDonald's;
what's your grudge against them?

00:29:52.569 --> 00:29:54.529
Student:  I have many.
 

00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:59.133
First how they market to
children, and how unhealthy

00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:01.569
their food is in general.
 

00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:02.180
Prof: Okay.
 

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:07.305
How many of you have eaten at
McDonald's sometime in the last

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:08.328
two weeks?
 

00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:11.039
That's a really interesting
datum;

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:13.990
we're at about 3%.
 

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:19.505
I'll bet you are the lowest
McDonald's demographic in the

00:30:19.505 --> 00:30:20.490
country.
 

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:26.185
Okay, but your objection to
McDonald's isn't--is it that

00:30:26.185 --> 00:30:32.089
they don't offer a wide enough
range of customizations?

00:30:32.089 --> 00:30:34.338
Student:  Partly.
 

00:30:34.338 --> 00:30:40.690
Prof: Okay I mean if I
were them I would say to you,

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.608
come on what's the beef,
we offer you twenty sandwiches,

00:30:44.608 --> 00:30:49.670
five breakfasts,
is it one flavor or more--

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.788
or two of ice cream?
 

00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:54.880
Two of ice cream,
that's quite a lot.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.720
Your beef is of another nature
isn't it?

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.940
Student:  That they
popularize unhealthy food.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:08.064
Prof: Okay so you--if
you were king,

00:31:08.064 --> 00:31:13.460
would you put them out of
business?

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.230
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.680
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.061
I have a good friend and
prominent faculty colleague

00:31:21.061 --> 00:31:24.311
named Kelly Brownell,
is Kelly Brownell visible to

00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:26.170
all of you, some of you?
 

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.480
Brownell is the leading
advocate of the fat tax.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.347
He himself is a big guy
actually, but he wants to tax

00:31:35.347 --> 00:31:40.684
restaurant fat so that there
would be an excise tax on the

00:31:40.684 --> 00:31:46.021
Big Mac of three or four bucks
because it is just one huge

00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:48.548
clump of cholesterol.
 

00:31:48.548 --> 00:31:56.019
We're off topic here,
the least favorite--

00:31:56.019 --> 00:32:01.724
my least favorites are several
airlines and providers of

00:32:01.724 --> 00:32:06.090
internet service,
and providers of television

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:06.769
signal.
 

00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:11.622
It's because they're rigid,
their business strategy

00:32:11.622 --> 00:32:15.990
involves a rigid interface with
customers,

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:20.078
and the Delta shuttle between
here and Washington--

00:32:20.078 --> 00:32:23.180
brutal, just brutal the way
they do it.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.660
That--and there's a reason for
that.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.519
It's not just because they're
bad people,

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:33.512
they're not even bad people,
it's because there are huge

00:32:33.512 --> 00:32:38.160
economies in not listening to
the details of what people want.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.237
Do you want a ticket on the
shuttle or do you not want a

00:32:41.237 --> 00:32:42.578
ticket on the shuttle?
 

00:32:42.578 --> 00:32:47.558
It will leave at 8:17,
full stop, end of conversation,

00:32:47.558 --> 00:32:49.788
and it isn't even actually a
conversation,

00:32:49.788 --> 00:32:55.147
it is an interplay with a
website, and the website is

00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:58.558
often kludgey,
uninformative and so on.

00:32:58.558 --> 00:33:02.492
But in a cost benefit ratio
from their point of view it

00:33:02.492 --> 00:33:03.950
works really well.
 

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:09.880
When you look at SELCO,
the first--

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.190
my first impulse would be to
say, simplify,

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.741
don't customize,
and get one product that you

00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:23.019
can generate at much lower cost
and stay with it.

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:26.884
Remember how,
in the dialogue in the film

00:33:26.884 --> 00:33:32.779
clip, and in the case he talks
about one size fits all doesn't

00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:33.650
work.
 

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.404
What he means is that people
who can barely afford this

00:33:38.404 --> 00:33:43.511
equipment are inclined to take
it only if you match it very

00:33:43.511 --> 00:33:46.328
well with their preferences.
 

00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:53.710
Now is that--somebody defend
SELCO please.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.990
They're highly defendable.
 

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:59.515
Student:  I mean I guess
this goes back to the bottom

00:33:59.515 --> 00:34:02.464
line we talked about,
and whereas SELCO and SEWA,

00:34:02.464 --> 00:34:04.710
it's not just a for profit
bottom line;

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.153
they really want to help
people, and that comes up a lot

00:34:07.153 --> 00:34:09.409
in the case,
wherein they thought that what

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.802
the name of the manager of SELCO
is that he really wanted to help

00:34:12.802 --> 00:34:13.650
these people.
 

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.965
Unless he tries to at least,
to some extent,

00:34:15.965 --> 00:34:19.253
customize his products he won't
be able to help as many people

00:34:19.253 --> 00:34:20.599
as he would like too.
 

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:23.949
Prof: Okay that's good,
hand the microphone on here.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.789
Student:  It's also sort
of about growing the market,

00:34:26.789 --> 00:34:29.719
because if you provide a
customized solution to,

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:33.777
say, a street vendor,
and that vendor is able to

00:34:33.777 --> 00:34:36.831
light his storefront,
make more money,

00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:40.447
and maybe in the future when
he's adding another side to his

00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:44.250
storefront he'll come back to
you and buy the full package.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.027
Prof: Okay,
so there is a sort of

00:34:47.027 --> 00:34:51.016
multiplier effect when on the
commercial side of this you

00:34:51.016 --> 00:34:52.940
customize it correctly.
 

00:34:52.940 --> 00:35:00.117
Now the major issue in the
background here is--what's the

00:35:00.117 --> 00:35:04.219
size of this market worldwide?
 

00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:06.289
Ballpark?
 

00:35:06.289 --> 00:35:09.699
Student:  One billion
about.

00:35:09.699 --> 00:35:11.500
Prof: Somewhere around a
billion,

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.900
so there are a hell of a lot of
customers out there,

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:23.909
and if that's so,
scalability as it's called,

00:35:23.909 --> 00:35:28.590
becomes a pressing question for
a firm like SELCO.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:36.637
Scalability would mean that you
could drive your costs low

00:35:36.637 --> 00:35:43.838
enough and develop your
distribution system strongly

00:35:43.838 --> 00:35:49.768
enough that you can reach vastly
more.

00:35:49.768 --> 00:35:52.719
They are--when the case is
written,

00:35:52.719 --> 00:35:55.039
they're still well under 10,000
households,

00:35:55.039 --> 00:35:59.753
and at well under 10,000
households this is an

00:35:59.753 --> 00:36:02.523
experiment,
a noble experiment,

00:36:02.523 --> 00:36:03.690
but merely that.
 

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.599
It is a demonstration project.
 

00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:13.018
Now a background fact about
them which isn't in the case is

00:36:13.018 --> 00:36:19.438
this: I had lunch today with a
Yale College alum who worked

00:36:19.438 --> 00:36:26.300
last year for an India company
that manufactures equipment like

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:32.599
this,
GWP, and GWP assigned her the

00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:41.170
task of finding a sales
relationship with SELCO,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:47.416
so she spent a year working
with SELCO trying to sell them a

00:36:47.416 --> 00:36:52.596
high quality,
but completely standardized

00:36:52.596 --> 00:36:59.440
system that was designed to
achieve scale economies.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:07.893
Her experience was entirely
frustrating, because SELCO

00:37:07.893 --> 00:37:15.869
ultimately wasn't interested in
achieving scale.

00:37:15.869 --> 00:37:21.177
They were interested in serving
the immediate customer base in

00:37:21.177 --> 00:37:22.570
front of them.
 

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.050
Okay what does that mean?
 

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:30.927
I think it means that SELCO is
a service company and is

00:37:30.927 --> 00:37:34.360
destined to remain a very small
one.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:42.222
Now in the case there's--in the
B case there is some discussion

00:37:42.222 --> 00:37:47.170
about their not for profit
financing.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:50.800
Anybody remember the amount of
financing they have?

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:57.391
No reason you should $462,000,
which isn't a monumental sum

00:37:57.391 --> 00:38:03.755
but it's a pretty hefty sum if
you're talking about a few

00:38:03.755 --> 00:38:06.369
thousand customers.
 

00:38:06.369 --> 00:38:12.809
The rhetoric in the B case is
no, no we're going to get to

00:38:12.809 --> 00:38:19.586
300,000 customers and the unit
cost will be $1 and change per

00:38:19.586 --> 00:38:25.010
customers of the subsidy will be
that small.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.099
Well I actually don't think
they're going to get there.

00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:32.838
I don't think it can be done
with this level of

00:38:32.838 --> 00:38:34.139
customization.
 

00:38:34.139 --> 00:38:38.628
Okay, so now the task is each
of you is a management

00:38:38.628 --> 00:38:43.425
consultant,
and you're brought in by the

00:38:43.425 --> 00:38:50.755
board of the funder for SELCO,
and you've got to figure out

00:38:50.755 --> 00:38:55.869
how to take the baby out of the
bathwater,

00:38:55.869 --> 00:38:59.070
get rid of the bathwater and
come up with something scalable.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.869
How would you go about that?
 

00:39:01.869 --> 00:39:06.309
Anybody got a thought?
 

00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:14.809
Would we fire management or not?
 

00:39:14.809 --> 00:39:18.184
Over--yes--
Student:  First I would

00:39:18.184 --> 00:39:20.918
try to get them to stop being
dependent on one geographic

00:39:20.918 --> 00:39:21.309
area.
 

00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:24.679
It seems like they really
concentrated between Bangalore

00:39:24.679 --> 00:39:28.704
and I think it was Ahmadabad,
and like clearly there are a

00:39:28.704 --> 00:39:32.230
lot of poor regions in India,
and once they get out of

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.849
those--that specific region,
I'm pretty sure they will be

00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:36.380
forced to look at it a bit
differently.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.059
Prof: Okay so let me see
if I understood that.

00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:43.579
You want them to move into
higher income groups?

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:46.545
Student:  No,
I want them to go to another

00:39:46.545 --> 00:39:47.409
poor region.
 

00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:49.614
Prof: Okay you want them
to go to another poor

00:39:49.614 --> 00:39:50.760
neighborhood and do what?
 

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.840
Student:  Clearly by
seeing that there are--

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.510
like since there are so many
different cultures within India,

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.740
and so many different needs,
that they continue this model

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.090
of customization they will see
they will ultimately fail,

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.519
and they need to start moving
into something else.

00:40:04.519 --> 00:40:06.039
Prof: Okay.
 

00:40:06.039 --> 00:40:09.942
I'm going to pretend to be
another person--a person on the

00:40:09.942 --> 00:40:10.489
board.
 

00:40:10.489 --> 00:40:12.974
"Look, we've already
figured out these guys are

00:40:12.974 --> 00:40:14.679
running straight into a dead
end.

00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:17.344
I'm inpatient,
all you're going to do is

00:40:17.344 --> 00:40:19.260
demonstrate failure again.
 

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.280
Find me a better solution."
 

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:29.170
Now anybody think they've got
one?

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:35.309
Yes, far back.
 

00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:38.856
Student:  I just figure
out a couple of SELCO's

00:40:38.856 --> 00:40:41.177
products,
a couple of their best products

00:40:41.177 --> 00:40:44.260
that numerically meet the needs
of the most number of people,

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.851
and then I would expand by
pushing those products and of

00:40:47.851 --> 00:40:51.771
course in the process you would
lose out on customization and

00:40:51.771 --> 00:40:54.951
individual solutions,
but if your goal is to provide

00:40:54.951 --> 00:40:57.717
illumination to the maximum
number of people just kind of

00:40:57.717 --> 00:41:00.039
focus on what you're good at and
skip that--

00:41:00.039 --> 00:41:03.702
Prof: Focus on a few
products, sounds like a good

00:41:03.702 --> 00:41:04.170
idea.
 

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:08.150
Now what about people who
are--remember there's talk in

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.139
the case about a pyramid.
 

00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:13.244
There's even a picture of a
pyramid and we're talking about

00:41:13.244 --> 00:41:16.510
serving people near the bottom
of the pyramid economically.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:22.094
Is there a way that you might
think about serving people at

00:41:22.094 --> 00:41:27.679
the bottom of pyramid by also
serving people a layer or two

00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:30.570
above them in the pyramid?
 

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:36.829
Yes.
 

00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:39.393
Student:  If you can
charge the people a little bit

00:41:39.393 --> 00:41:42.184
higher up the pyramid more than
the systems, they can subsidize

00:41:42.184 --> 00:41:43.130
the people below.
 

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.018
Prof: Okay,
so if you can take a--

00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:51.536
you probably have to have the
product differentiated a little

00:41:51.536 --> 00:41:57.237
bit to produce a higher margin
product which is very similar to

00:41:57.237 --> 00:42:02.405
your straight product,
and build a distribution

00:42:02.405 --> 00:42:06.318
channel in--
so that the same distributors

00:42:06.318 --> 00:42:11.239
can cover the higher margin
product and also the low margin

00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:15.989
product for the people at the
bottom of the pyramid,

00:42:15.989 --> 00:42:21.157
and achieve some scale
economies so that you begin to

00:42:21.157 --> 00:42:24.239
make the pump run on its own.
 

00:42:24.239 --> 00:42:32.034
The video clip we just watched,
they talk about how when they

00:42:32.034 --> 00:42:37.230
let distributors do what they
wanted,

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.728
the distributors ended up
drifting into higher income

00:42:39.728 --> 00:42:42.708
strata,
and that's not very surprising

00:42:42.708 --> 00:42:46.039
because the margins can be much
higher.

00:42:46.039 --> 00:42:50.438
In the bottom channel,
unless you get the thing very

00:42:50.438 --> 00:42:54.307
standardized,
the margins have to be negative

00:42:54.307 --> 00:42:57.360
because people just can't afford
it,

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.815
so high customization at the
very bottom looks like a highly

00:43:01.815 --> 00:43:05.500
problematic strategy,
inspiring as it may be.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:15.235
Is there--are there other lines
of production unrelated to

00:43:15.235 --> 00:43:26.340
electricity that strike you as
interestingly analogous to this?

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.418
For example,
let's say the nub of this idea

00:43:29.418 --> 00:43:31.469
is distributed production.
 

00:43:31.469 --> 00:43:34.800
Instead of centralized grid
production we're doing

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.199
distributed electric production
of electricity,

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:43.420
just as we have distributed
computing on all these laptops.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:47.731
Are there other highly
distributed strategies that

00:43:47.731 --> 00:43:52.130
might be of service in bottom
billion countries?

00:43:52.130 --> 00:44:03.809
Okay, talk--say more--
Student:  You could

00:44:03.809 --> 00:44:08.230
distribute mobile phones instead
of building a land line.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.010
Prof: Okay has anybody
thought of that yet?

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.949
Student:  I'm sure, yeah.
 

00:44:13.949 --> 00:44:15.980
Prof: Big time, right?
 

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.271
I mean the story here is land
lines become--completely

00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:22.873
saturate the market and then
cell phones are a layer on top

00:44:22.873 --> 00:44:23.619
of that.
 

00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:27.132
In all the countries we'll be
talking about with

00:44:27.132 --> 00:44:30.318
The Bottom
Billion, cell phones just

00:44:30.318 --> 00:44:34.922
leap over land lines,
right, and are technologically

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:40.554
superior to land lines from
almost every point of in a very

00:44:40.554 --> 00:44:42.690
low income setting.
 

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.960
That's a good suggestion.
 

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.670
Any others occur to anyone?
 

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.659
Jennifer?
 

00:44:48.659 --> 00:44:50.360
Student:  Water
purification.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.784
Prof: Okay water
purification and the technology

00:44:54.784 --> 00:44:57.159
there is--how do you do it?
 

00:44:57.159 --> 00:45:00.751
Student:  Well instead
of running pipes to transport

00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:04.342
clean water to remote places you
could just build their own

00:45:04.342 --> 00:45:06.510
filters or dig their own wells.
 

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:09.730
Prof: Okay you could
build your own filters,

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.539
dig your own wells might or
might not work,

00:45:11.539 --> 00:45:15.369
depending on the water tables
depth and quality,

00:45:15.369 --> 00:45:19.923
but yes it's a very good point
and right at the end of the

00:45:19.923 --> 00:45:23.119
semester we'll see a case in
Bolivia--

00:45:23.119 --> 00:45:28.909
Cochabamba, Bolivia where we
try to fix a water supply system

00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:34.311
using straight capitalist
technique and get into a lot of

00:45:34.311 --> 00:45:35.469
trouble.
 

00:45:35.469 --> 00:45:38.268
We get into a lot of trouble
for the--

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:43.775
basically because the pricing
model for the capitalist to make

00:45:43.775 --> 00:45:49.371
money leads to too high a price
for people who are right at the

00:45:49.371 --> 00:45:53.380
bottom of Bolivia's pyramid,
which is not very different

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.833
from India's pyramid,
except it's got a lot less

00:45:55.833 --> 00:45:56.679
growth in it.
 

00:45:56.679 --> 00:46:00.599
That's--anybody else got one?
 

00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:05.159
Student:  Fighting
malaria,

00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:07.431
for example,
you could focus on like big

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.530
projects who alter the
landscape,

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:12.300
like draining swamps versus
just giving people,

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.449
giving mosquito nets in their
own homes.

00:46:14.449 --> 00:46:19.311
Prof: Okay,
and the Gates' agree with you,

00:46:19.311 --> 00:46:22.960
and are throwing billions at
them.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:29.983
In general, there's this whole
family of models for multiple

00:46:29.983 --> 00:46:36.081
bottom line businesses,
and some not so multiple bottom

00:46:36.081 --> 00:46:38.431
line,
some straight out for profit

00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:39.150
businesses.
 

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:44.690
Where having decentralized
production as in SELCO's

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:49.789
equipment, is a terrifically
valuable asset.

00:46:49.789 --> 00:46:56.833
Now for Monday the main metric
that is used in the world for

00:46:56.833 --> 00:47:03.278
progress, and what defines the
bottom billion as bottom

00:47:03.278 --> 00:47:06.980
billion, is GDP per capita.
 

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:12.159
In my part of Monday's class,
which I'm about to record,

00:47:12.159 --> 00:47:17.170
I'm going to pick at--I'm going
to start with the proposition

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:21.679
maximize GDP per capita and make
the country better.

00:47:21.679 --> 00:47:26.016
Paul Collier more or less
advocates that in The Bottom

00:47:26.016 --> 00:47:27.099
Billion.
 

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:33.586
I'm sympathetic to that view
but I'll set up some critical

00:47:33.586 --> 00:47:39.050
screens to pass it through and
explain those,

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:43.914
and you'll see that video at
the beginning of class on Monday

00:47:43.914 --> 00:47:48.534
and then after my little video
there is a Ted talk by Paul

00:47:48.534 --> 00:47:53.400
Collier explaining what he
thinks his book has to offer.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:58.000

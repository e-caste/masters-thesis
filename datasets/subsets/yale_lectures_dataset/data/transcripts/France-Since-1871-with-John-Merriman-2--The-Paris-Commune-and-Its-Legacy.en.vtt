00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.652
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, today I want to talk

00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:06.717
about the Paris Commune.
This is how I end the previous

00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:10.799
course, but it's the most
appropriate place to start this

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.275
one,
because the Paris Commune hung

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:19.120
over Europe for the next twenty
or thirty years.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.254
And, in my view,
the Paris Commune and the

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:27.590
massacre that followed the Paris
Commune,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.714
the massacre of thousands and
thousands of people,

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:33.010
anticipated the twentieth
century,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.960
when you became guilty for just
being who you were.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.971
"À
Paris tout le monde

00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:44.060
était coupable,"--"in
Paris everybody was guilty,"

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.307
shouted out one of the
prosecutors as they shot men and

00:00:48.307 --> 00:00:50.194
women down.
It would be,

00:00:50.194 --> 00:00:54.444
and I'll conclude with this,
the largest massacre that would

00:00:54.444 --> 00:00:59.054
take place until the massacre of
Armenians by Turks in the latter

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:04.230
years of the nineteenth century,
and in World War One,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.609
as well, in 1915,
and it sadly anticipates the

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:14.510
horror shows of the twentieth
century.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.656
"À
Paris tout le monde

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:18.654
était coupable."
You were guilty because you

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:22.005
were left in Paris,
because you were too poor to

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:26.400
get out.
So, what was the Paris Commune?

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.673
Some of you already know this,
but let me talk about that and

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:34.840
then give you my view on it.
The Paris Commune has to be

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.300
placed in the context of two
things going on.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.024
One is that during the Second
Empire, which was that regime of

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:49.186
Napoleon III that lasted from
1852 to till he was really

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:52.940
rounded up by the Prussians in
1870.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.892
There was in the late 1860s a
revival of republican and

00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:03.192
socialist organization,
and of anarchist

00:02:03.192 --> 00:02:06.829
disorganization,
if you will.

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.931
In June of 1868 the Emperor
legalizes public meetings,

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:17.848
which had been illegal,
and in Paris and in very many

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:21.995
places, particularly on the edge
of Paris, on the margins of

00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:24.430
urban life,
you had meetings in large

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.156
warehouses, and in big
cafés where people

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:30.753
discussed politics and imagined
reforms that they wanted in the

00:02:30.753 --> 00:02:33.446
Empire,
or many of them wanted a

00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:38.270
republic, or some sort of
democratic, socialist republic.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.351
So, there's a political
mobilization in the late 1860s,

00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:46.660
and in the beginning of 1870
there's a wave of strikes.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.620
Strikes had been illegal in
France until 1864.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.470
Unions would be illegal in
France until 1881;

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.659
but, so, you had a wave of
strikes.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.933
So, that's really the first
context and the mobilization of

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:11.479
many ordinary people living in
Paris.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.107
The second context is the
Franco-Prussian War,

00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:19.300
which you can read about in
Chip Sowerwine's book.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.414
But, basically what happens is
that Louis Napoleon,

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:26.460
Napoleon III,
gets suckered into a war

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.986
without any allies at all
because of various dumb things

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:34.690
that he'd done against the very
clever,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.284
extremely aggressive Otto von
Bismarck, the Prussian

00:03:40.284 --> 00:03:43.756
chancellor.
It involved one of those

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:48.360
obscure things that one had to
learn in Western Civ.,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.901
the way it was taught a long
time ago--well I suppose it's

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.318
worth remembering anyway--it
involved the candidacy of a

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.278
Royal Family member,
a rather obscure one,

00:03:58.278 --> 00:04:01.983
for the throne of France,
which would have left France

00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:05.129
surrounded by the Royal Family
of Prussia,

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.998
Hollenzollerns,
a name that in this course you

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:11.951
need not retain unless it's in
some extraordinarily complicated

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.182
crossword puzzle.
But Napoleon protests

00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:19.867
vigorously, and then,
trying to add insult to injury,

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:25.274
his ambassador literally chases
the German emperor around his

00:04:25.274 --> 00:04:29.779
garden and is fairly abusive in
a verbal way,

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:35.420
and Bismarck seizes on this to
stoke up anger against France

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.339
and then reveals to the European
world,

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:43.544
or those people who cared,
that Napoleon III had earlier

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:48.130
tried to make a deal which in
exchange for supporting Prussia

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.639
against Austria he would receive
Belgium and Luxemburg,

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.350
which of course the British
could never tolerate.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.747
And so, what happens is that he
goes to war in the summer of

00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:05.899
1870, without any allies,
against Prussia and its South

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:08.923
German allies,
and he thinks he's going to

00:05:08.923 --> 00:05:11.410
win.
But--as my team was in the

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.350
Michigan State game last
Saturday, with me present,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.498
a very sad person you're
looking at--he was blown out,

00:05:20.498 --> 00:05:25.064
and on September 4th,
1870, there is yet another

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:29.932
insurrection in Paris.
A crowd storms down to the town

00:05:29.932 --> 00:05:33.709
hall, they seize power,
they proclaim a republic,

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:38.619
they name streets different
names, and they want to prolong

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:42.259
the resistance against the
Prussian Army,

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:47.556
which has through betrayal and
cleverly organized military

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:52.110
victories--is sweeping aside
French resistance.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.238
And Napoleon III,
who's very sick,

00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:57.850
he would die a couple of years
later, probably of stomach

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.632
cancer,
is captured in the Battle of

00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:06.571
Sedan, s-e-d-a-n,
which is a textile town near

00:06:06.571 --> 00:06:11.509
the Belgian border in the north
of France,

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.759
and he goes off to--is sent
packing off to Britain.

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.524
Now, what happens then is that
there are those who want to keep

00:06:21.524 --> 00:06:25.582
fighting.
It's quite clear that one of

00:06:25.582 --> 00:06:31.319
the demands of Prussia--;and,
as of late January,

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.444
a unified Germany--the German
Empire was proclaimed in the

00:06:35.444 --> 00:06:39.279
Hall of Mirrors in the
Château of Versailles,

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.472
by coincidence--but one of the
demands is that there'll be a

00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:47.553
huge indemnity,
which the French will have to

00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:52.211
pay, and that Alsace and
Lorraine, those Eastern

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:56.115
provinces,
largely German speaking,

00:06:56.115 --> 00:07:00.911
I remind you,
would be amputated and would be

00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:06.010
annexed by Germany.
And, after the Paris region,

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.316
Alsace and Lorraine were the
two most industrialized and

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:18.671
prosperous parts of France.
And, so, in Paris people find

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:22.210
themselves surrounded.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.294
They find themselves
surrounded, and Paris is--it's

00:07:36.294 --> 00:07:41.099
nothing like- -it's one-third
the size of London at this same

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:42.912
time,
or at any other time,

00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:44.629
but it has a huge
circumference.

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:49.236
There is a wall around Paris
and there are exterior forts,

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:53.600
but you've got an enormous
number of people besieged by

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.590
Prussian and other German
forces,

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.480
holding on.
At one point,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.079
a French politician whom you'll
meet in the textbook,

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.143
at least,
called Gambetta,

00:08:03.143 --> 00:08:07.168
who died very young,
flies away in a balloon,

00:08:07.168 --> 00:08:12.747
flies down toward Tours on the
Loire Valley to try to raise up

00:08:12.747 --> 00:08:18.560
resistance there,
but things get quickly very

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.948
grim indeed.
In October, a French general

00:08:22.948 --> 00:08:27.790
capitulates rather scandalously
in the town of Metz,

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.862
in the east,
which would become a German

00:08:29.862 --> 00:08:32.838
town--in fact you go to Metz,
maybe some of you have been

00:08:32.838 --> 00:08:35.460
there,
Metz--you'll see this

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.088
huge sort of lugubrious railroad
station that was clearly built

00:08:40.088 --> 00:08:44.120
in the Second Reich of the
Kaisers and of Bismarck.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.792
And, so, Paris is surrounded in
this sort of glory that was

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:54.291
supposed to be,
the Empire has collapsed on the

00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:57.070
head of France.
And, to be sure,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.139
there were lots of crowds in
Paris.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:02.158
There were the inevitable
crowds who shouted for war,

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:05.235
which was sort of odd because
Paris was increasingly a

00:09:05.235 --> 00:09:07.813
leftwing city,
because the vast majority of

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:10.223
the population of Paris were
ordinary people,

00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:13.535
were workers,
more about that another time

00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:19.865
when I talk about Paris;
but, the siege goes on and on,

00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:26.782
and Paris changes appearances.
Military dress or parts of

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:31.120
uniform become seen just about
everywhere.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.863
The problem is feeding all of
these people,

00:09:35.863 --> 00:09:44.429
how are you going to feed them?
You've got all sorts of animals.

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:47.074
You've got horses which you
need for the army but also which

00:09:47.074 --> 00:09:50.031
they start slaughtering;
you've got cattle but you have

00:09:50.031 --> 00:09:52.360
enough food to last for maybe a
month;

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.929
there's always a lot to drink
because of the caves,

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:59.813
that is, the wine cellars that
people had, but things get worse

00:09:59.813 --> 00:10:02.329
and worse.
The last regular mail delivery

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:04.844
was on September 19th,
and thereafter they used

00:10:04.844 --> 00:10:07.786
balloons.
The balloon was invented in the

00:10:07.786 --> 00:10:12.360
Ardèche by Montgolfier in
the late eighteenth century,

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.580
and the balloon becomes a sort
of symbol of perhaps liberty.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.500
The people in Paris are
awaiting some sort of military

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.700
help from the provinces,
but it simply goes on and on.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.924
And during the siege there were
sixty-five balloon flights

00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:31.299
carrying two and a half million
letters,

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:34.967
weighing a grand total of
10,000 kilograms,

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:41.150
so roughly about 20,000 pounds.
One astronomer actually left

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:46.220
Paris to go off and to observe
an eclipse.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.895
They begin using pigeons in
order to fly messages out,

00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:53.418
and then the Germans,
who were of course portrayed as

00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:56.590
committing atrocities--and
they'd committed a few,

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.704
they'd shot some people up in
the northeast,

00:10:59.704 --> 00:11:02.529
but nothing like would occur in
1914,

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:05.017
and, of course,
nothing at all like what would

00:11:05.017 --> 00:11:07.670
occur in very different
circumstances in 1939,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.333
1940.
The Germans bring in these

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:16.340
falcons and they go out and they
munch the pigeons;

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.203
and so this was another reason
for them, just like the Germans,

00:11:20.203 --> 00:11:24.130
these poor little pigeons who
became the sort of sacred bird,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.916
I guess a pigeon's a bird.
Pigeons--people,

00:11:26.916 --> 00:11:29.340
including me,
eat pigeons;

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.519
pigeoneau is actually
quite good.

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.555
But, anyway,
it seemed like an awful thing

00:11:33.555 --> 00:11:36.484
to do when they're bringing
these falcons and hawks who were

00:11:36.484 --> 00:11:38.419
imported to intercept these
people.

00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:42.483
Now, the Paris population
included national guardsman,

00:11:42.483 --> 00:11:46.009
come from the outside to take
refuge inside.

00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:48.960
So, it's rather like a medieval
siege, from that point of view.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.855
You've got people from the
outskirts coming in for food and

00:11:52.855 --> 00:11:55.555
safety;
but, the population is slightly

00:11:55.555 --> 00:11:59.139
over two million people,
and that's a lot of mouths to

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:01.623
feed.
You've got 1,500 Americans,

00:12:01.623 --> 00:12:05.149
several of whom leave accounts
of the whole thing,

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:08.820
40,000 Belgians,
30,000 Swiss and 5,000 English.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.357
So, you're starting out with
about--please don't write these

00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:16.287
down--24,000 cattle,
150,000 sheep,

00:12:16.287 --> 00:12:19.909
6,000 hogs, and that is not
enough to eat,

00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:24.769
and people become quite
obsessed with what they're going

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:27.865
to eat.
And you're looking at somebody

00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:31.800
who basically does not like dogs
at all but who loves cats,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.990
and canine butchers replaced
horse butchers.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.625
The horses had mostly been
eaten up or had been

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:39.343
commandeered,
as I said before,

00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:42.238
by the army.
You can still in France today

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:45.990
find not canine butchers,
you can find horse butchers,

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.459
and it's always a red front
with a gold head of a horse,

00:12:49.459 --> 00:12:52.754
appropriately enough.
But people began to eat

00:12:52.754 --> 00:12:56.604
first--not first,
but they ate the animals in the

00:12:56.604 --> 00:12:59.693
zoo and what's his name,
Castorin Pollocks,

00:12:59.693 --> 00:13:01.692
who many Parisian children,
generations,

00:13:01.692 --> 00:13:04.950
had gone to visit the zoo,
find themselves eaten;

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.837
and they can't eat the tigers
because they're afraid to open

00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:09.357
the cages, and,
unfortunately,

00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:11.959
the tigers simply croaked
because they're not going to

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.409
waste food on them,
from their point of view;

00:13:14.409 --> 00:13:16.100
but, they begin eating dogs and
cats.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.199
And, so, you had this rather
odd situation where instead of

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:23.309
dogs guarding their masters or
mistresses,

00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:26.609
you had the masters and
mistresses guarding the dogs

00:13:26.609 --> 00:13:29.519
against people who would take
the dogs and,

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.250
unfortunately,
kill them and eat them.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.880
And they eat cats as well,
and, of course,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.416
rats.
And Paris had and still has

00:13:38.416 --> 00:13:42.671
millions of rats.
Even if you come home about two

00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:46.995
or 2:30 in the morning near our
apartment you can still see

00:13:46.995 --> 00:13:50.500
rather large rats dashing across
the street;

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.740
some of them look so bloated
they look like sangliers,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.780
or wild boar,
which you can see occasionally

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.381
in parts of rural France.
There were tales,

00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:06.308
inevitable tales of--and with
French food, as you know,

00:14:06.308 --> 00:14:10.779
presentation accounts for
something very much.

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:13.110
When food arrives you're likely
to say "c'est bien,

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.588
bien presentée";
it has all sorts of

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.685
meanings to it,
it's well presented,

00:14:17.685 --> 00:14:21.340
but it's how it looks but how
it's served and of course how it

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.468
tastes,
where you would

00:14:23.468 --> 00:14:28.728
have--unfortunately this pains
me when I think of my poor

00:14:28.728 --> 00:14:34.269
little kitty--a cat with mice
artfully placed around the cat

00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:36.905
carcass;
one has to call it that--what

00:14:36.905 --> 00:14:41.137
do you have?--carcass of cat.
And people simply got by as

00:14:41.137 --> 00:14:44.227
best they could.
And so they have this--and

00:14:44.227 --> 00:14:47.285
Bismarck had predicted that the
siege would end if Parisians

00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:49.668
went several weeks without their
café

00:14:49.668 --> 00:14:52.340
au lait,
the whole thing would be over.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.260
But, they create a Central
Commission of Hygiene and

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.123
Sobriety which tell
people--encourage people to eat

00:14:58.123 --> 00:15:00.893
healthfully,
and don't just get wasted all

00:15:00.893 --> 00:15:04.919
the time--which is what I would
have done, I'll tell you that.

00:15:04.919 --> 00:15:08.330
No, I take that back,
do not film that.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.637
Here's the proposed menu.
You don't have to know French

00:15:13.637 --> 00:15:15.095
to know this,
but here's a menu that

00:15:15.095 --> 00:15:16.720
they're--this is early in the
siege.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.725
The word for French is
cheval,

00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:21.212
and here's a menu;
but these people must have been

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:24.044
friqués, or
fairly wealthy to have been able

00:15:24.044 --> 00:15:26.653
to eat like this.
You don't even have to know

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:28.719
French to get this.
It starts it with a

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:30.464
consumée de
cheval, cheval

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:31.669
braisé
au chou,

00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:33.503
collet de cheval à
la mode,

00:15:33.503 --> 00:15:35.519
côte de cheval
braisé,

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:39.821
fillet de cheval rôti,
boeuf et cheval salé

00:15:39.821 --> 00:15:43.899
froid--you couldn't do much
with horse ice-cream,

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:46.830
so it sort of trailed by the
end.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:51.351
And somebody once wrote many a
superb champion of Longchamps,

00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:55.492
that is the racetrack,
met their end on the table of

00:15:55.492 --> 00:16:00.156
some well-heeled person from the
western fancy districts of

00:16:00.156 --> 00:16:02.628
Paris.
But, it ceased being funny,

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:05.931
and it was nothing like the
siege of Leningrad where

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:09.493
something like a million people
died in World War Two of

00:16:09.493 --> 00:16:11.969
starvation;
but, there were all sorts of

00:16:11.969 --> 00:16:14.900
little caskets being dragged
along to what passed then for

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.820
mortuaries.
Old people and young people,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.088
the youngest died in droves;
and, of course,

00:16:21.088 --> 00:16:24.053
sheer drunkenness becomes an
enormous problem,

00:16:24.053 --> 00:16:27.941
and so did venereal disease
because of the--Paris at any one

00:16:27.941 --> 00:16:30.364
time,
depending on who's counting,

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:34.208
but the number of prostitutes
was at least 10,000 and probably

00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:36.980
about 25,000,
and so venereal disease becomes

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.220
rampant;
and there are also very strange

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.889
cases of mental illness that
were predictable.

00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:46.728
There are people who are
brought into mental institutions

00:16:46.728 --> 00:16:49.110
who literally think that they're
Joan of Arc,

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:54.566
who was burned au
Calvados--I shouldn't say

00:16:54.566 --> 00:16:59.799
that--but, in Rouen in the
fifteenth century;

00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:02.543
or there are people that
believe that they're God,

00:17:02.543 --> 00:17:05.789
or that they're Saint Louis and
can somehow save France.

00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:10.886
So, hunger sets in and it
becomes extremely sad and

00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:16.390
tragic, and attempts to break
out simply don't work;

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.619
but, it had its light moments,
and I can never resist those.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.557
They do a contest--those of you
who like to enter

00:17:22.557 --> 00:17:25.372
contests--saying,
"how can we break out of this

00:17:25.372 --> 00:17:27.819
awful mess, oh,
whatever can we do?"

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.564
And just three of the
suggestions that came in,

00:17:30.564 --> 00:17:33.547
that I would have rewarded them
some sort of prize,

00:17:33.547 --> 00:17:36.529
were the following,
or maybe just two of them.

00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:40.730
One, somebody says that all of
these prostitutes are a valuable

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.253
resource for Paris--Berlin had
its own sad legions of

00:17:44.253 --> 00:17:48.318
prostitutes as well--and that
they must be equipped with what

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:51.188
they called Prussic,
as in Prussian,

00:17:51.188 --> 00:17:54.438
but Prussic needles that would
have a poison,

00:17:54.438 --> 00:17:59.019
and then the prostitutes would
go out to encounter in some sort

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:02.269
of cash exchange Prussian
soldiers and,

00:18:02.269 --> 00:18:06.310
at some key moment in the
exchange, would stab them in the

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:12.407
neck very gently with this pin;
that would be the end of their

00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:18.920
eating sauerkraut and then Paris
would free itself.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.938
Somebody else suggested that
because of the influence of

00:18:21.938 --> 00:18:24.901
Wagner and because of the
traditional kind of om-pah

00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:28.085
music that the Parisians
always associated with Germans

00:18:28.085 --> 00:18:30.938
that you would take the
orchestras of Paris and teach

00:18:30.938 --> 00:18:34.286
them how to play om-pah
music--this is what they called

00:18:34.286 --> 00:18:35.910
it,
not the Prussians,

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.896
of course--and that one day
they simply would open up one of

00:18:38.896 --> 00:18:41.252
the gates of Paris,
heavily defended,

00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:45.490
and would march out playing
this music and then behind them

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.339
would become this huge Trojan
horse,

00:18:48.339 --> 00:18:51.912
which they would call the
musical mitrailleuse,

00:18:51.912 --> 00:18:55.827
or the musical machinegun,
which would then open up and

00:18:55.827 --> 00:18:59.738
start blasting away the poor
Prussians, who were always

00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:02.545
assumed to be,
by the sneaky Parisians,

00:19:02.545 --> 00:19:05.500
to be very dumb,
but of course they weren't.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.181
And the other,
somebody wrote in and said,

00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:08.740
well let's just take this huge
tarp,

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.269
put it on the Place de la
Concorde, put bacon and other

00:19:12.269 --> 00:19:15.995
things and use pigeon power,
and all the pigeons would come

00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:18.642
to that place,
and then you engulf the pigeons

00:19:18.642 --> 00:19:22.055
and you have this powerful
balloon that can carry all these

00:19:22.055 --> 00:19:24.880
people in some sort of airborne
stagecoach,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.910
or diligence,
out of Paris.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.097
But, the thing,
it becomes less and less funny

00:19:31.097 --> 00:19:33.866
and not at all.
And, at the very beginning

00:19:33.866 --> 00:19:36.329
there was a train that went
around the Wall of Paris,

00:19:36.329 --> 00:19:38.372
more about the walls of Paris
another time,

00:19:38.372 --> 00:19:41.096
that's fun to talk about,
and Parisians would take picnic

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:42.950
lunches,
and they'd get on the train,

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.399
and then they'd hear these
large explosions and realize

00:19:45.399 --> 00:19:47.940
that they could get killed by
these large explosions.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.946
And, so, as things are going
downhill many people in Paris

00:19:52.946 --> 00:19:56.019
said look, we must keep
fighting,

00:19:56.019 --> 00:19:59.081
but we must imagine a different
world where--we have,

00:19:59.081 --> 00:20:02.437
we're being betrayed by the
provinces that are not helping

00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:05.769
us,
and we need to have help from

00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:08.589
the provinces.
And, in January,

00:20:08.589 --> 00:20:11.782
somebody puts up a sign,
a big red sign,

00:20:11.782 --> 00:20:16.039
red being the color of the
Left--red was illegal,

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:19.480
the color red was illegal
between 1849 and 1851,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.286
because it was believed to
excite one group of people

00:20:23.286 --> 00:20:26.803
against another,
which is an exact quote from

00:20:26.803 --> 00:20:30.690
the French Law--and it's a big
red poster that says,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.492
"make way for the Commune,
that the people of Paris would

00:20:34.492 --> 00:20:37.887
have the right to defend
themselves and to create a

00:20:37.887 --> 00:20:43.984
better world in the future."
Now, let me scramble for my

00:20:43.984 --> 00:20:46.310
implement here.

00:20:52.109 --> 00:20:55.166
And this is a conservative
response to the mobilization of

00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:57.632
French workers,
and this says the working class

00:20:57.632 --> 00:21:00.259
population won't at all listen
to bad advice.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:02.930
And, notice here,
this guy, this is your basic

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.599
Parisian urchin who in 1830 in a
Delacroix,

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:07.569
a famous Delacroix painting
called Liberty Leading the

00:21:07.569 --> 00:21:10.135
People is sort of the hero,
but here he's sort of the bad

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:12.509
guy, he's sort of a Gavroche
gone totally wrong,

00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:16.771
and here is temptation,
and here's this working class

00:21:16.771 --> 00:21:20.460
family that will surely resist
all of this.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.710
And this is--God,
I love this--one picture,

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.140
you first see the first picture
you can actually see of Paris,

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:31.392
this is what they call a
daguerréotype from

00:21:31.392 --> 00:21:34.559
1837, the faubourg du
temple.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.266
And you can actually,
instead of imagining what

00:21:36.266 --> 00:21:37.640
things look like,
you can see them.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.813
And here, this is from the
steps of Montmartre,

00:21:39.813 --> 00:21:42.460
way before the god-awful
Sacré-Coeur was built,

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.589
the basilica--more about that
some other time,

00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:49.691
when I'm in a real frenzy of
contempt for the destruction of

00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:52.334
the Parisian skyline.
But, anyway,

00:21:52.334 --> 00:21:56.553
this is looking down from
Montmartre, and here you've got

00:21:56.553 --> 00:22:00.019
the image of-- the female image
of liberty,

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:04.859
Marianne, and she comes in as
the provisional government that

00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:09.089
is going to capitulate France,
it's going to give up,

00:22:09.089 --> 00:22:13.440
but not that it's going to make
a damn bit of difference.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.911
And then Adolph Thiers,
who somebody once called a

00:22:17.911 --> 00:22:23.419
miserable gnome--t-h-i-e-r-s,
Adolph Thiers is there and he's

00:22:23.419 --> 00:22:28.172
cutting off the right arm of
France, which is Alsace and

00:22:28.172 --> 00:22:30.829
Lorraine,
with Strasbourg and Colmar,

00:22:30.829 --> 00:22:34.490
and la route des vins
and all these important things.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:38.461
And here, this is Marianne
being martyred by the French

00:22:38.461 --> 00:22:42.552
provisional government,
and in the back is the--is it

00:22:42.552 --> 00:22:46.279
the dawning of the social
republic of the Left,

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:50.472
that is these ordinary people
who have fought so long and so

00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:54.355
hard.
So, France capitulates,

00:22:54.355 --> 00:23:01.421
not Paris, but France,
the provisional government

00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:09.369
capitulates in the end of
January of the year 1871,

00:23:09.369 --> 00:23:14.031
and the Prussian troops cavalry
march down--I guess horses don't

00:23:14.031 --> 00:23:18.839
march, they trot--but they trot
down the Champs-Elysées,

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:22.138
and then the concierges
from that area go and

00:23:22.138 --> 00:23:24.789
symbolically,
and for real intent also,

00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:28.094
clean up the stones afterwards,
and there's a huge indemnity

00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:31.631
that has to be paid off,
and France will lose

00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:34.977
Alsace-Lorraine.
So, France has this provisional

00:23:34.977 --> 00:23:37.776
government--you can read about
this stuff, it's not that

00:23:37.776 --> 00:23:40.233
interesting;
well, it's passionately

00:23:40.233 --> 00:23:42.986
interesting.
But, in February of 1871 there

00:23:42.986 --> 00:23:46.819
are elections and the provinces,
particularly the conservative,

00:23:46.819 --> 00:23:51.399
western provinces like Brittany
return this extremely monarchist

00:23:51.399 --> 00:23:56.052
dominated National Assembly that
is going to determine the future

00:23:56.052 --> 00:23:58.908
of France.
And the landlords come back to

00:23:58.908 --> 00:24:01.911
Paris, because they had
somewhere to go during the

00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:03.872
siege, and they say,
"you pay up,

00:24:03.872 --> 00:24:06.140
you pay up money with
interest";

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.537
and the provisional government
says, "yes, you pay up money

00:24:08.537 --> 00:24:11.355
with interest."
And people had no money,

00:24:11.355 --> 00:24:14.440
and there's just incredible
anger.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.637
And Thiers, who in 1848 had
advised another regime that fell

00:24:19.637 --> 00:24:21.839
to revolution,
that is,

00:24:21.839 --> 00:24:25.592
of the July Monarchy,
the plotting Louis-Philippe,

00:24:25.592 --> 00:24:28.349
to withdraw the troops from
Paris,

00:24:28.349 --> 00:24:33.504
in the account of--if there's
any trouble in Paris--he already

00:24:33.504 --> 00:24:36.588
had this in mind.
On March 18th,

00:24:36.588 --> 00:24:41.553
1871, he sends troops to
Montmartre, the hill of

00:24:41.553 --> 00:24:45.990
Montmartre, the highest point in
Paris,

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.812
which had only been annexed in
1860, on January 1st;^(

00:24:49.812 --> 00:24:53.129
)Montmartre which still had this
somewhat rural

00:24:53.129 --> 00:24:56.880
atmosphere--there's still a wine
produced there,

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.079
the vineyard is about as big as
this room, it's just so they can

00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:04.680
sell the label of wine from
there--because the National

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.480
Guard of Paris that had defended
Paris so heroically,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.841
they've still got these guns,
and, so, they have these guns

00:25:12.841 --> 00:25:17.127
and, so, they send the troops to
get the guns early in the

00:25:17.127 --> 00:25:19.504
morning.
The women who are at the market

00:25:19.504 --> 00:25:21.740
see the troops coming,
they call the men folk.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.952
The men folk take two generals
of the provisional government,

00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:27.950
they put them up against the
wall and they shoot them,

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.685
and Thiers says now we're going
to get these bastards,

00:25:30.685 --> 00:25:32.440
and he pulls all the troops
out,

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.060
headquartered appropriately
enough in Versailles,

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.700
and Paris is surrounded again
by,

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.320
in this case,
somebody else's government,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.809
that is, the provisional
government.

00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:48.454
So, the Commune begins on the
18th of March,

00:25:48.454 --> 00:25:53.640
1871, and it lasts until the
end of May, 1871.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.839
Lenin once called it the
"Festival of the Oppressed";

00:25:56.839 --> 00:26:00.252
and Lenin was wrong about many
things, he was right about a few

00:26:00.252 --> 00:26:03.390
things but wrong about many,
but he got that one right.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.803
And, so, for the first time
ordinary Parisians found

00:26:06.803 --> 00:26:09.480
themselves masters of their own
lives.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.831
The wealthy people mostly got
out again, and the commune holds

00:26:14.831 --> 00:26:16.018
on.
The commune,

00:26:16.018 --> 00:26:19.950
the numbers of the commune were
swollen by political refugees.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.079
This is a woman called Elisbeth
Dmitrieff, who was a Russian

00:26:23.079 --> 00:26:25.890
militant who was one of the
leaders of the commune.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:30.537
And, as in the French
Revolution, that is 1789 and

00:26:30.537 --> 00:26:35.658
following, and as in 1848,
clubs of women began to form

00:26:35.658 --> 00:26:38.630
demanding rights.
And the commune,

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.246
despite the fact that there's
lots of--you could hear in the

00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:45.740
distance the guns sometimes
getting closer and closer,

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.750
and attempts to break out fail
miserably, they pass all sorts

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.089
of impressive social
legislation.

00:26:52.089 --> 00:26:56.680
They create nurseries for
working women;

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.079
they give contracts to make
National Guard uniforms to

00:27:00.079 --> 00:27:03.897
women's unions;
they plan what will be a lay,

00:27:03.897 --> 00:27:09.607
secularized education system;
they ban night baking because

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:15.781
it was not good for the health
of people working in bakeries in

00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:20.128
the middle of the night.
And here's a woman's club

00:27:20.128 --> 00:27:22.247
making demands.
Nobody is yet,

00:27:22.247 --> 00:27:25.950
except these women,
thinking of female suffrage.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:31.615
So, it's kind of an important
moment in the history of women,

00:27:31.615 --> 00:27:36.714
and also it explains the
viciousness of the attempt--of

00:27:36.714 --> 00:27:40.094
the massacre,
really, of ordinary working

00:27:40.094 --> 00:27:44.236
class women when the whole thing
falls apart, because women were

00:27:44.236 --> 00:27:48.716
conceived of as being uppity,
as putting forth claims that

00:27:48.716 --> 00:27:52.450
they shouldn't be making,
by conservatives.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:53.957
And a couple of the
communards--one is a

00:27:53.957 --> 00:27:55.170
woman that you'll read about
later,

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.004
called Louise Michel,
who spends half her time in

00:27:59.004 --> 00:28:02.200
exile in London,
who was an anarchist,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.039
basically, was very important,
along with Elisabeth Dmitrieff.

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:09.683
And, so, you're surrounded--and
people, they don't agree on

00:28:09.683 --> 00:28:12.163
everything.
You've got Jacobins,

00:28:12.163 --> 00:28:15.798
Jacobins who are the sort of
centralized radical republicans

00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:18.509
or socialists from the French
Revolution;

00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:21.083
you've got anarchists who
wanted not to take over the

00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:23.364
state but to destroy it,
I'm going to talk about

00:28:23.364 --> 00:28:26.044
anarchists another time because
I'm writing a book about one of

00:28:26.044 --> 00:28:28.054
them;
and you've got moderate

00:28:28.054 --> 00:28:32.179
republicans who simply wanted
Paris to have more liberties

00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:35.870
vis-à-vis the strongly
centralized state,

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:39.873
more about that next time.
You've got moderate socialists,

00:28:39.873 --> 00:28:42.789
you've got this whole kind of
different people,

00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:45.460
and they're meeting around
tables, and talking,

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.911
and arguing,
and debating,

00:28:46.911 --> 00:28:48.677
and yelling,
and hugging,

00:28:48.677 --> 00:28:51.890
long into the night,
as the guns draw nearer.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.689
There were communes in other
cities, too, with a variety of

00:28:56.689 --> 00:28:59.578
demands, in Limoges,
in Le Creusot,

00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:02.326
in Saint-Étienne,
in Narbonne,

00:29:02.326 --> 00:29:06.990
in Lyon and in Marseilles,
and even an attempt in Bordeaux.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:11.672
And Paris keeps waiting for
these armies of citizens to

00:29:11.672 --> 00:29:15.488
come--and citoyennes,
female citizens,

00:29:15.488 --> 00:29:20.007
also to come and rescue them;
but, in the meantime you've got

00:29:20.007 --> 00:29:23.269
people from the northern and
northeastern quarters of Paris,

00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:26.833
the poor, living on the edge of
Paris who come down into the

00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:29.343
fancy quarters,
for the very first time when

00:29:29.343 --> 00:29:31.940
they're not working as someone's
maid, and they,

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.790
some--and the painter,
Gustav Courbet,

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.720
the naturalist painter from
near Besançon,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.371
thus Burial at Ornans,
he says, "why don't we,

00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:45.390
as a symbol,
get rid of this horrible statue

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.674
of Napoleon that's standing on
the Vendôme column in the

00:29:49.674 --> 00:29:53.985
Place Vendôme?"
The Place Vendôme is near

00:29:53.985 --> 00:29:56.089
Palais Royale,
very fancy.

00:29:56.089 --> 00:29:58.278
It's known to Americans who
have visited,

00:29:58.278 --> 00:30:00.685
there are many,
but others because that's the

00:30:00.685 --> 00:30:02.710
Ritz Hotel where
what's-her-name,

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.912
Princess Diana left ten years
ago now and never made it,

00:30:05.912 --> 00:30:09.163
unfortunately for her,
out of the Pont d'Alma,

00:30:09.163 --> 00:30:11.424
the tunnel.
He says let's tear the whole

00:30:11.424 --> 00:30:14.761
damn thing down.
And, so, this is an entry path

00:30:14.761 --> 00:30:19.608
to see this, to see this thing
brought down as a symbol of

00:30:19.608 --> 00:30:24.447
centralized oppression.
And this is the result,

00:30:24.447 --> 00:30:28.200
this is the crashing.
And, so, people would come down

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.319
and they'd have their pictures
taken with a picture,

00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:33.763
as if it was part of the true
cross of the crashed

00:30:33.763 --> 00:30:38.538
Vendôme column;
because for once they had won,

00:30:38.538 --> 00:30:43.463
for once they had won.
And, so, they have to defend

00:30:43.463 --> 00:30:45.628
Paris.
And, so, you've got all these

00:30:45.628 --> 00:30:48.439
cannons that you just saw
before, and you've got--they

00:30:48.439 --> 00:30:51.091
still have their uniforms and
they build these huge

00:30:51.091 --> 00:30:52.980
barricades.
The first barricades,

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.003
by the way, were built in Paris
in the late sixteenth century,

00:30:56.003 --> 00:30:59.421
so there's a long tradition.
And you could build barricades

00:30:59.421 --> 00:31:02.869
across smaller streets,
but not across big boulevards,

00:31:02.869 --> 00:31:05.621
and that was part of the
rebuilding of Paris in the 1850s

00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:08.618
and '60s, more about that in a
minute and much more about that

00:31:08.618 --> 00:31:10.250
later,
because it's fascinating;

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.869
at least, I think it's
fascinating.

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:14.541
And here you go,
right down by the Seine,

00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:17.479
there's some Monet and Manet
paintings, both,

00:31:17.479 --> 00:31:20.151
that are further back,
from further back,

00:31:20.151 --> 00:31:23.415
looking over.
Here, you've got your basic

00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:27.924
barricade--and these things are
torn up, these are where trees

00:31:27.924 --> 00:31:32.195
came out of, as in 1968;
and here's your sort of kiosk

00:31:32.195 --> 00:31:35.570
of modernity,
somebody selling newspapers on

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.372
these boulevards,
or near these boulevards,

00:31:38.372 --> 00:31:40.000
and here's some of these
people.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.500
And most of them would be dead
within a month of this photo.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:53.482
And there you are looking at
them, trying to protect their

00:31:53.482 --> 00:31:54.340
city.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.321
Now, who, first of all,
who were the communards,

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:04.609
who were the people that was
left?

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:07.902
Well, when revolutions are
victorious everybody rushes

00:32:07.902 --> 00:32:10.743
forward and says "moi,
j'étais là,"

00:32:10.743 --> 00:32:13.109
I was there, and they give their
name and their address and,

00:32:13.109 --> 00:32:15.902
"why don't you reward me,
or at least pay attention to

00:32:15.902 --> 00:32:18.895
the fact that I was there?"
In Paris, you got the Victory

00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:21.725
Column of the Revolution of
1830, where the Bastille once

00:32:21.725 --> 00:32:24.349
stood,
and it's got the names of all

00:32:24.349 --> 00:32:28.539
the people that were killed in
three days of July 1830;

00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:33.396
but, in something like this you
have a body count of more than

00:32:33.396 --> 00:32:35.427
15,000 people.
So, we know who the

00:32:35.427 --> 00:32:37.460
communards were,
they were ordinary people;

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.116
they were the ordinary workers,
men and women who simply

00:32:41.116 --> 00:32:45.430
couldn't get out.
They weren't all socialists;

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.042
as I said, some were
anarchists, some were moderate

00:32:48.042 --> 00:32:50.289
republicans, but they were who
were left.

00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:54.253
They were--their very presence
there, that's where they lived,

00:32:54.253 --> 00:32:57.956
but their defense of Paris
reflects tensions between urban

00:32:57.956 --> 00:33:00.619
France and conservative rural
France.

00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:04.036
The armies that they were
opposing, the French armies,

00:33:04.036 --> 00:33:07.195
were largely staffed by
peasants from conservative

00:33:07.195 --> 00:33:09.357
areas,
or from National Guards brought

00:33:09.357 --> 00:33:11.559
in from towns like Vannes,
or Évreux,

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:14.740
or all sorts of places,
are brought in.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.219
And, so, the commune--it's
somewhat semi-proletarian,

00:33:18.219 --> 00:33:21.704
they're mostly working people.
They're particularly people

00:33:21.704 --> 00:33:24.444
from the poorer quarters of the
north and the northeast,

00:33:24.444 --> 00:33:26.990
more about that later.
They are who,

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.141
the people that were left.
They are artisans,

00:33:31.141 --> 00:33:34.690
craftsmen, day laborers,
domestic servants;

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.130
they are the people who were
left.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:42.742
And, what they were trying to
do was imagine a new world which

00:33:42.742 --> 00:33:45.933
would be less centralized;
but, for the socialists,

00:33:45.933 --> 00:33:47.410
they wanted more
centralization.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:52.619
So, it was a very complex,
complex period indeed.

00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:58.949
But it reflects the
artisinal base that was

00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:03.470
still part of the French
economy,

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:09.292
for sure, with the emphasis on
skilled production of handbags,

00:34:09.292 --> 00:34:13.519
and of gloves,
and of finely crafted tables.

00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:16.580
The cabinet makers were always
terribly important in the French

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.607
Revolution, and they still are,
and there are still--all the

00:34:19.607 --> 00:34:22.703
stores, or most of the stores on
one particular street in Paris

00:34:22.703 --> 00:34:25.099
near the Bastille are still
furniture stores.

00:34:25.099 --> 00:34:27.691
The kind of myth of the commune
was, of course,

00:34:27.691 --> 00:34:30.902
that from the conservatives'
point of view--was that these

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:34.075
were the furies of hell,
the men and the women who rose

00:34:34.075 --> 00:34:36.534
up to slay their social betters.
Well, of course,

00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:38.782
that's not the case,
that's a sort of a myth for the

00:34:38.782 --> 00:34:41.581
French Revolution as well.
And then you had you had your

00:34:41.581 --> 00:34:44.729
basic republican interpretation
that said they were defending

00:34:44.729 --> 00:34:47.929
the Republic against this sort
of monarchy to be restored,

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.639
and that certainly is part of
that as well;

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.835
but, it also had its socialist
component and Marx,

00:34:55.835 --> 00:34:59.487
for Marx this was terribly
important and for Lenin it was

00:34:59.487 --> 00:35:01.905
as well.
It seemed to be Armageddon for

00:35:01.905 --> 00:35:04.523
the ruling classes,
but it seemed to be that here

00:35:04.523 --> 00:35:07.849
was this proletariat--even
though Marx got that all wrong,

00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:09.556
because these are not
industrial workers,

00:35:09.556 --> 00:35:11.603
for the most part,
but these are the workers that

00:35:11.603 --> 00:35:13.309
will one day break off their
chains.

00:35:13.309 --> 00:35:17.058
And, so, you can see how this
would have an impact on every

00:35:17.058 --> 00:35:20.225
country, on the United
States--those of you who've

00:35:20.225 --> 00:35:23.422
taken American history,
this sort of view that

00:35:23.422 --> 00:35:27.385
immigrants were increasingly
bringing socialism and anarchism

00:35:27.385 --> 00:35:30.923
to the United States.
The commune is important in the

00:35:30.923 --> 00:35:34.073
big Hay Market Affair,
the collective memory of the

00:35:34.073 --> 00:35:37.980
commune in the Hay Market Affair
in Chicago and the people hung

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.993
there in--when was it--1886.
But, the most important,

00:35:42.993 --> 00:35:49.960
really the most important
result of it was the massacre,

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.836
I think, itself,
because when finally the troops

00:35:52.836 --> 00:35:56.569
of the provisional government
come pouring through the Western

00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:58.665
gate,
a gate that had essentially

00:35:58.665 --> 00:36:00.898
been left open,
in a place called Passy,

00:36:00.898 --> 00:36:03.989
where there's some very nice
art nouveau buildings,

00:36:03.989 --> 00:36:07.182
by the way, but which was very
collaborationist also in World

00:36:07.182 --> 00:36:09.630
War Two, though not
everybody--what they do,

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.639
the troops do,
is they use the boulevards that

00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:19.074
had built by Napoleon III as a
way of getting to those working

00:36:19.074 --> 00:36:23.440
class neighborhoods that had
always risen up.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.168
And Napoleon III and his
Prefect of the Seine--a name you

00:36:27.168 --> 00:36:30.757
don't have to remember now,
but sometime it would be nice

00:36:30.757 --> 00:36:33.958
to remember, called Hausmann,
a name so important that it

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:36.630
became a verb;
to hausmann something was to

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.399
bulldoze it;
a man dissed by my late friend

00:36:39.399 --> 00:36:43.291
Richard Cobb as the "Alsatian
Attila"--he had plowed through

00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:47.249
working class neighborhoods and
built the boulevards that--of

00:36:47.249 --> 00:36:50.482
the modern Paris that one
celebrates and where one

00:36:50.482 --> 00:36:54.070
celebrates.
He did it to bring more light,

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:58.710
he did it to bring more air,
he did it to free the flow for

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.109
capital, money;
that's why the department

00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:03.642
stores are on the boulevards.
I'll do this again,

00:37:03.642 --> 00:37:07.715
not this whole lecture but that
part again--and he did it

00:37:07.715 --> 00:37:11.498
because you can't build
barricades across boulevards,

00:37:11.498 --> 00:37:13.826
wide ones.
1944, August,

00:37:13.826 --> 00:37:16.489
we jump ahead,
the boulevard,

00:37:16.489 --> 00:37:22.196
the barricades are across the
same streets where they were in

00:37:22.196 --> 00:37:26.599
many cases in 1792 and in 1789.
And the problem,

00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:29.968
in 1968 it was very hard to
build a barricade across the

00:37:29.968 --> 00:37:32.356
Boulevard St.
Michel, which was built by

00:37:32.356 --> 00:37:35.570
Hausmann at this time.
So, the troops come pouring in.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:39.653
This is down the Rue de Rivoli,
which was completed in the

00:37:39.653 --> 00:37:43.019
1850s and '60s,
and the damage is staggering.

00:37:43.019 --> 00:37:46.347
This is the Church of the
Madeleine, which is still there,

00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:49.831
and this is the Rue Royale.
These streets do not matter,

00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:53.350
it's just the visual images
with what is really going on

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:56.032
that counts.
The Hôtel de Ville,

00:37:56.032 --> 00:37:58.661
which was destroyed.
Interestingly enough,

00:37:58.661 --> 00:38:02.035
ten years ago somebody found
photos taken by this Parisian of

00:38:02.035 --> 00:38:05.241
the siege in the Commune in the
back of the Hôtel de

00:38:05.241 --> 00:38:07.341
Ville;
they were found ten years ago,

00:38:07.341 --> 00:38:09.692
they had survived.
I just saw an exposition of

00:38:09.692 --> 00:38:12.937
them at the Bibliothèque
Historique de la Ville de Paris

00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:15.920
in January, of photos that had
never been seen before;

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.764
but, anyway,
this is the Hôtel de

00:38:17.764 --> 00:38:20.483
Ville which is down by Notre
Dame, though it's not in the

00:38:20.483 --> 00:38:23.030
cité.
Don't worry about these places.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.050
And then, they put the women on
trial.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.334
There had been a rumor that
female incendiaries,

00:38:28.334 --> 00:38:31.269
in French les
pétroleuses,

00:38:31.269 --> 00:38:37.014
had been setting fire to fancy
houses and had been burning down

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:42.432
the Bank of France.
And so this rumor was part of

00:38:42.432 --> 00:38:48.420
the fear of "upitty women"
putting forth demands,

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:53.069
and they squished them like
grapes, and they hauled them off

00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:55.950
and shot them.
Goncourt, one of the writers,

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.800
the Goncourts,
the one who hadn't died yet,

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.336
was no friend of ordinary
people, but there's an amazing

00:39:01.336 --> 00:39:04.195
scene in his memoirs when he's
down by the Hôtel de Ville

00:39:04.195 --> 00:39:06.269
and he sees these women chained
together,

00:39:06.269 --> 00:39:08.326
being walked around,
and he says,

00:39:08.326 --> 00:39:10.639
"Well what--where are they
going?"

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:13.592
And, so, the guy next to him
says, "Well they're going to

00:39:13.592 --> 00:39:15.665
shoot them."
He said, "What do you--they're

00:39:15.665 --> 00:39:19.870
going to shoot them?
You don't shoot women, do they?"

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.509
Well they did.
And he describes it and it's

00:39:23.509 --> 00:39:25.472
terrifying.
I used to read it,

00:39:25.472 --> 00:39:28.519
but I could never get through
it--terrifying.

00:39:28.519 --> 00:39:30.291
And then he hears the coup
de grâce,

00:39:30.291 --> 00:39:31.619
it's the shots,
one after another,

00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:34.245
and then he sees a priest
staggering out,

00:39:34.245 --> 00:39:37.133
overwhelmed by it all,
and then he moves onto

00:39:37.133 --> 00:39:40.465
something else.
The Execution,

00:39:40.465 --> 00:39:44.736
this is Manet,
who is horrified by the whole

00:39:44.736 --> 00:39:47.530
thing.
Manet wasn't there.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:53.050
Courbet also did an execution
scene.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:58.637
And, in the end what there was
was this, "à

00:39:58.637 --> 00:40:03.581
Paris tout le monde
était coupable,"

00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:08.315
Paris, everybody was guilty.
Little coffins,

00:40:08.315 --> 00:40:11.977
people were smaller then.
You can still see in the

00:40:11.977 --> 00:40:15.521
Pantheon--the sort of secular
monument to some very wonderful

00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:19.337
people like Émile Zola,
but also just Napoleonic

00:40:19.337 --> 00:40:23.849
generals, one after another--you
can still see bullet holes

00:40:23.849 --> 00:40:25.686
there,
from the Commune,

00:40:25.686 --> 00:40:29.027
not just from World War Two,
from where people were

00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:31.385
executed.
And lots of people who were

00:40:31.385 --> 00:40:34.727
chimney sweeps were executed
because they had been cleaning

00:40:34.727 --> 00:40:37.320
chimneys and they had gun--the
equivalent,

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.830
they had charcoal on their
cheeks and people,

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:43.254
they would rip off your shirt
to see if you had a bruise from

00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:48.468
a recoiling rifle.
And it wasn't a neutral

00:40:48.468 --> 00:40:50.894
massacre.
What is was,

00:40:50.894 --> 00:40:53.417
they went to areas of Paris
like Belleville,

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:57.012
which is in the northeast,
which had long been assumed to

00:40:57.012 --> 00:40:59.157
be a radical place,
and Montmartre,

00:40:59.157 --> 00:41:02.563
and that's where their
collective memory of the "forces

00:41:02.563 --> 00:41:05.497
of order,"
as they liked to call it,

00:41:05.497 --> 00:41:09.631
was very, very precise,
and that's where they went in

00:41:09.631 --> 00:41:14.583
and massacred them.
And that is the most chilling

00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:18.559
probably legacy of the whole
thing.

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:21.631
Now, I know it's easy to look
at me and say,

00:41:21.631 --> 00:41:25.559
"God, there's an old leftie,
why doesn't he grow up?"

00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:27.882
That's what my wife says
sometimes, "why don't you grow

00:41:27.882 --> 00:41:29.851
up?"
But, "why don't you get over

00:41:29.851 --> 00:41:32.311
this?"
I remember when I was a student

00:41:32.311 --> 00:41:35.587
in Paris I remember going up
to--there's a place at

00:41:35.587 --> 00:41:38.573
Père Lachaise Cemetery,
and there's the Wall of the

00:41:38.573 --> 00:41:39.670
Féd&amp;ea
cute;rés,

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.500
it's called the Wall of the
Fédérés,

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.860
and that's where they massacred
lots of people.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.857
And people used to go up there
on May Day, and sometimes on the

00:41:46.857 --> 00:41:50.171
anniversary of the commune,
just to see where these people

00:41:50.171 --> 00:41:54.250
fell, with enormous more dignity
than the people who shot them.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:59.920
And this was the ultimate
lesson of the Commune that would

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.743
hang over Europe.
For the Left,

00:42:02.743 --> 00:42:06.190
it was a sign that the state is
strong, powerful,

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:10.351
and can be vicious.
Don't let anyone ever tell you

00:42:10.351 --> 00:42:15.169
that the victims of terrorism in
any century are anywhere

00:42:15.169 --> 00:42:19.730
approximately near the victims
of state terrorism.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.943
No matter how awful terrorism
was in the anarchist attacks at

00:42:23.943 --> 00:42:27.473
the beginning of the 1890s,
and I'm going to talk to you

00:42:27.473 --> 00:42:29.659
about it because I'm interested
in them;

00:42:29.659 --> 00:42:33.112
but, this was the real lesson
of all of this,

00:42:33.112 --> 00:42:36.330
as the state,
ever more stronger in Europe

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.646
since the consolidation of
territorial monarchies in the

00:42:40.646 --> 00:42:44.690
fifteenth century,
the state growing in power with

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.313
absolutism, growing in power
with the revolution with

00:42:48.313 --> 00:42:50.691
Napoleon,
growing in power with

00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:54.924
unification of national states.
The state could strike back

00:42:54.924 --> 00:42:58.902
with unparalleled savagery
against those people who got in

00:42:58.902 --> 00:43:02.864
the way,
and that's what happened at the

00:43:02.864 --> 00:43:08.139
commune, in the Paris Commune.
How many people died?

00:43:08.139 --> 00:43:13.809
Minimum estimate 15,000,
probably closer to 25,000.

00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:17.820
Yet, when they did the census
of 1872 in Paris alone there

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.829
were 10,000 less shoemakers than
there had been before.

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:25.889
Shoemakers were an
extraordinarily radical trade.

00:43:25.889 --> 00:43:29.650
Were they all hiding in their
aunt's house in Orléans?

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:34.721
Where were they?
The flames engulfed the bodies,

00:43:34.721 --> 00:43:38.462
they were gone,
and the amnesty for the

00:43:38.462 --> 00:43:42.960
communards,
the people in the commune,

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.008
wouldn't come till 1879,
but it hung like a shadow over

00:43:48.008 --> 00:43:53.710
European politics and French
politics for years and years.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.219
And, you know,
when you go up there,

00:43:56.219 --> 00:44:00.306
as you go up to Montmartre,
it's incredible--because I was

00:44:00.306 --> 00:44:03.219
there once very,
very late in the afternoon,

00:44:03.219 --> 00:44:06.342
and oddly enough I met this
woman who went there every day

00:44:06.342 --> 00:44:08.510
and I said,
"why do you go there every day?"

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.994
And she said she had some sort
of lung disease and she couldn't

00:44:10.994 --> 00:44:13.480
get out of Paris but she could
go into Père Lachaise,

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.219
and she knew where every tomb
was.

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:17.358
And she took us up to see the
Wall of the

00:44:17.358 --> 00:44:20.460
Fédérés,
I was with some friends of my

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.254
mother long ago,
and I remember looking at that

00:44:24.254 --> 00:44:27.485
and just thinking.
I remember when I was a kid,

00:44:27.485 --> 00:44:30.441
I read this book by Thomas
Wolfe called Look Homeward

00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:33.057
Angel,
and in the end he says--what

00:44:33.057 --> 00:44:36.276
does he say?--he said,
"oh lost, and by the wind

00:44:36.276 --> 00:44:40.230
grieved,
ghost, come back again."

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:44.102
That was the commune and we're
going to go on to the State next

00:44:44.102 --> 00:44:48.000
time.
Have a good day.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.983
Professor Donald
Kagan: Before I start on

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:05.720
today's topic,
which is Greek tyranny,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.299
I have been asked to say a word
on the subject--well,

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.260
to answer the question really
best I can,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.056
if the hoplite phalanx was so
stunningly successful in the

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:24.345
period of the sixth,
fifth, fourth centuries B.C.,

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:29.310
why was it that other peoples,
other than the Greeks,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.174
the ones who came in contact
with them and saw it and were

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:36.100
victimized by it,
why didn't they adopt it?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.712
Well, let me make it perfectly
clear like all the other

00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:43.794
interesting questions in this
course, I cannot give you a firm

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:47.320
answer.
I can only give you opinions.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.288
But that whole subject now is
so wonderfully more

00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:56.250
controversial than it was
probably ever before in history,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.142
because everything now in
history that bears on the

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:07.307
western world and its relations
with some other world is part of

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:12.885
a great political assault by
those people who are eager to

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:19.050
pull down anything that seems to
be admirable or special,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.068
or positive about the West.
And needless to say,

00:01:23.068 --> 00:01:28.162
they say that it really was bad
or to say wasn't so terrific,

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:31.682
or it didn't exist.
So, that's the context in

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:34.856
which, not the students'
question, but the larger

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:38.030
question is getting kicked
around these days.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.051
Well, I think part of the
reason for unhappiness about it

00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:48.072
is that I think the answer lies
in the character precisely of

00:01:48.072 --> 00:01:52.865
the polis.
The fact that it had an ethos,

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:57.418
a set of values,
which placed so powerfully at

00:01:57.418 --> 00:02:01.769
the center of the minds of the
citizens,

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:08.502
the notion that the combination
of courage in a military setting

00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:14.593
which was the inheritance of
Homer and the new ideology of

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:20.684
devotion to the polis as
the most important kind of

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:25.280
commitment that a citizen could
have.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.124
This produced an attitude which
was that it was the job of a man

00:02:31.124 --> 00:02:34.650
who was a citizen of a
polis,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.681
beyond anything else,
to fight bravely in the ranks

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:44.697
of his army.
As it happened,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:48.398
they developed--I think this
latter part of the story,

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:51.889
is simply accidental--they
happened to develop this

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.079
technique which employed the
weapons and defensive armor that

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.919
they had and then because they
had those things,

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:05.003
and because this ethos was
present, it was possible to put

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:09.819
together this fighting unit
which was the phalanx which

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.814
depended so enormously heavily
upon the commitment to the

00:03:14.814 --> 00:03:18.099
commonality,
to the common cause that was

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.259
characteristic of the
polis.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.702
Now, every state of every
kind, every people,

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:28.006
and every tribe has some degree
of this kind of commitment to

00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:31.879
one another or else they
wouldn't exist as a unit.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.108
But there are really very sharp
differences of degree in terms

00:03:38.108 --> 00:03:42.906
of how powerfully this
commitment really affects

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:46.186
people.
You would find in the same

00:03:46.186 --> 00:03:49.751
people, at different times in
their history,

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:54.727
the power of this idea and this
commitment and it's beyond an

00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:58.090
idea somehow.
It's sort of really bred and

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.099
trained into the bones of every
Greek man in the polis

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.438
beginning sometime,
I would say,

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:08.344
in the seventh century or
earlier and carrying forward,

00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:12.178
so long as the polis
remained an autonomous and

00:04:12.178 --> 00:04:15.878
independent unit.
So, Greeks against Persians is

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:19.462
the best case we have,
because the Greeks fought the

00:04:19.462 --> 00:04:23.750
Persians more than they fought
other non-Greek peoples and the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.248
Persians were very formidable.
Let's remember the Persians had

00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:32.589
defeated every other power there
was in the world that they knew,

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:36.979
and controlled and dominated a
vast, vast empire by anybody's

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.515
standards, but certainly by the
standards of the world in which

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:44.664
they knew.
So, for the Greeks to defeat

00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:48.002
the Persians,
there was nothing routine about

00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:50.414
that;
that was always going to be

00:04:50.414 --> 00:04:52.819
surprising and needing
explanation.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.476
So really a way to focus the
question that I'm addressing is

00:04:56.476 --> 00:04:58.769
how come the Persians didn't do
it?

00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:01.047
There I think,
in that case,

00:05:01.047 --> 00:05:05.528
the answer is not so very hard,
because the Persian Empire was

00:05:05.528 --> 00:05:10.009
a composite unit made up of lots
of places and vast numbers of

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.829
people who had been conquered by
the Persians,

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:17.798
and whose relationship to the
great King of Persia was really

00:05:17.798 --> 00:05:21.379
an almost technical sense,
that of slaves.

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.170
They needed to do,
they had to do,

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.155
they were expected to do,
whatever the Persian king told

00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:30.016
them to do.
Now, he was not fanatical and

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:36.109
he did not make requests that
typically were impossible for

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:40.295
people to do.
In fact, the Persian rule over

00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:43.718
their conquered peoples was,
in many ways,

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:48.144
easier and more generous and
less intrusive than other

00:05:48.144 --> 00:05:50.032
peoples.
For instance,

00:05:50.032 --> 00:05:53.430
in the realm of religion,
the Persians did not bother;

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.949
they didn't interfere with
people's exercise of religion.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.367
Those of you who have read a
book called, The Old

00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:03.383
Testament,
will remember that the Persians

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:07.740
show up at important places and
they get treated very nicely.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.273
There's a bad Persian or two
here or there,

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:13.349
but he gets put down,
but the Persians treat and the

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.329
Persians were among the people
who treated the Jews very well,

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:21.327
because they didn't care what
the Jews did in their religious

00:06:21.327 --> 00:06:25.058
life, so long as they did the
two important and essential

00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:27.589
things that the Persians
required,

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:31.516
which was you had to do
military service for the king at

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.230
his demand and you had to pay
taxes.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.204
If you did those things and
made no trouble that's all you

00:06:37.204 --> 00:06:39.240
had to worry about from the
Persians.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.758
Well okay,
why didn't the Persians then

00:06:42.758 --> 00:06:45.437
adopt it?
Because the greater part of

00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:49.569
their army wasn't Persian even.
So, the kinds of allegiance

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.198
that's necessary for this kind
of fighting wasn't motivated by

00:06:54.198 --> 00:06:58.022
most of these people.
A second reason was the

00:06:58.022 --> 00:07:01.678
Persians themselves and their
Arian allies,

00:07:01.678 --> 00:07:05.736
the Medes,
had achieved their success

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:11.589
militarily as cavalrymen and
that was their nature,

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:15.234
and that was what they
practiced and elevated to the

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:18.092
highest levels,
so that the best Persians

00:07:18.092 --> 00:07:21.642
fought in the cavalry.
They had infantry and some of

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:25.203
their infantry was relatively
very good, but there wasn't that

00:07:25.203 --> 00:07:28.529
kind of--all that matters in a
polis basically,

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.552
I'm exaggerating only very
slightly, is how you fight in

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:35.623
the infantry.
Happily, that question isn't so

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:39.060
bad because when we get to the
story of the Spartans,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.723
which comes after our story of
the tyrants, I will read to you

00:07:43.723 --> 00:07:48.310
some of the poetry which was the
material with which Spartans

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.599
were trained,
and you'll quickly see why the

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:58.079
Greek ethos, the Greek feeling
of absolute commitment,

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:02.257
voluntary absolute commitment,
even at the risk of your life

00:08:02.257 --> 00:08:06.434
for the polis was the
central most important force in

00:08:06.434 --> 00:08:10.297
society.So,
the answer is essentially a

00:08:10.297 --> 00:08:14.959
moral commitment,
based upon training and belief.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:19.207
This is why the Greeks did the
phalanx, and plus the historical

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:22.769
accident of their having
developed that technique.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:25.282
It should be pointed out that
there were peoples in the

00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:27.515
Ancient Near East,
before the Greeks ever came to

00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:32.452
be anything,
who had closely ordered,

00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:38.773
armed infantry soldiers.
The Assyrians are a very good

00:08:38.773 --> 00:08:41.264
example.
But if you examine Assyrian

00:08:41.264 --> 00:08:44.822
fighting, it's not quite the
same thing as the Greek

00:08:44.822 --> 00:08:47.028
fighting,
and if I knew more about

00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:50.049
Assyrian fighting I might be
able to say still more.

00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:53.186
I don't know how much is
actually known in detail,

00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:56.898
but there was obviously an
element in the Greek story which

00:08:56.898 --> 00:09:00.500
went beyond merely equipment,
and order, and so on.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.100
It had to do with what was in
their heads.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.520
I think if you know about
warfare in the modern world,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.857
even today, so much of what
determines whether armies

00:09:11.857 --> 00:09:16.361
succeed or fail in their
missions has to do with what's

00:09:16.361 --> 00:09:19.802
in their head.
Every army, I think,

00:09:19.802 --> 00:09:25.118
let's say every good army even,
is good at certain things and

00:09:25.118 --> 00:09:28.894
they are trained,
and their culture prepares if

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:32.419
they are successful to do
certain kinds of things.

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:35.600
If you take them and make them
fight in a different way,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.011
until they are able to make an
adjustment which is sometimes

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:42.755
never,
they can fight with that same

00:09:42.755 --> 00:09:45.094
skill.
So, there is a very close

00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:47.809
union, I would say,
and I'll come back and I'll say

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:50.090
a smarter guy than I,
said it long ago.

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:56.989
There's a close connection
between the nature of the

00:09:56.989 --> 00:10:01.283
society that produces and uses
the military force and the kind

00:10:01.283 --> 00:10:04.309
of fighting that military force
can do.

00:10:04.309 --> 00:10:08.728
I'm really just giving you a
little riff on a tune written by

00:10:08.728 --> 00:10:12.246
Aristotle back in his day,
when he connects closely to

00:10:12.246 --> 00:10:15.320
character, which I think I
mentioned that the other day.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.820
The character of a regime and
the character of the fighting;

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.787
I did tell you about that.
You know if it's going to be

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:24.548
cavalry based,
it's going to be aristocratic

00:10:24.548 --> 00:10:27.256
or oligarchic.
If it's going to be navel

00:10:27.256 --> 00:10:30.553
based, it's going to be
democratic, and so on and so

00:10:30.553 --> 00:10:34.174
forth, so I hope that's of some
help in dealing with that

00:10:34.174 --> 00:10:37.280
question.
Let's turn now precisely to

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.120
this phenomenon which is Greek
tyranny.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.279
Tyranny emerges in the seventh
century B.C.,

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:52.110
maybe it might have--no I think
it emerges,

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:59.948
I would think,
for many of the same reasons

00:10:59.948 --> 00:11:03.696
and in response to some of the
very same developments that I

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:06.999
described for you in talking
about the great burst of

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:10.620
colonization that began in the
eighth century in the Greek

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.486
world.
All of those tumultuous,

00:11:13.486 --> 00:11:18.592
troubling, changing forces that
were at work in society were at

00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:22.710
work in bringing about this new
kind of regime,

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:28.402
which lasted from one to three
generations among the Greeks

00:11:28.402 --> 00:11:33.326
before it faded away.
It was a transitional phase in

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:37.326
Greek society,
rather than one that lasted for

00:11:37.326 --> 00:11:40.992
a terribly long time,
but it was not trivial,

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.990
and, as I say,
in some cases it went for three

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.630
generations.
Okay, what is tyranny?

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.512
Let's begin with the word.
The word tyranneia is

00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:56.063
tyranny, the word
tyrannos is tyrant,

00:11:56.063 --> 00:12:01.460
and etymologically the word is
not a Greek word.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.532
It was a borrowed word that the
Greeks took from somebody else

00:12:05.532 --> 00:12:09.538
and then applied it to certain
elements that emerged in their

00:12:09.538 --> 00:12:12.748
society.
Chances are it was borrowed

00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:18.277
from Lydia, that kingdom in Asia
Minor that was inland from the

00:12:18.277 --> 00:12:23.995
Greek settlements on the coast.
The first Lydian king,

00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:31.320
of whom we hear that could fit
as the first tyrant from Greek

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.960
perspective was a man called
Gyges,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.473
who ruled in Lydia from
something like the years 685 to

00:12:41.473 --> 00:12:46.497
657, something like that.
The first time the word

00:12:46.497 --> 00:12:52.510
tyrannos or some version
of it appears in Greek that we

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.750
have comes in the fragments of
the poet,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.190
Archilochus,
and he is a fascinating

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.623
character.
We do have fortunately a few

00:13:04.623 --> 00:13:09.625
nice fragments of his poetry.
In fact, for the first time in

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:12.049
the last couple of decades,
for the first time,

00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:17.334
since they were lost,
we actually have a full lyric

00:13:17.334 --> 00:13:22.600
poem by Archilochus.
But in any case he has this bit

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.481
of poetry that is preserved in a
late writer's collection which

00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:32.293
says,
"I don't care for the wealth of

00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:36.429
golden Gyges,
nor have I ever envied him.

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:43.816
I am not jealous of the works
of the gods and I have no desire

00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:48.915
for lofty tyranny."
This is where the word tyranny

00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:52.488
comes into the picture.
Even in that small

00:13:52.488 --> 00:13:55.893
collection of words,
you get some idea of what the

00:13:55.893 --> 00:13:59.548
Greeks meant by tyranny.
They were talking about

00:13:59.548 --> 00:14:03.648
tremendous power from their
perspective and its golden

00:14:03.648 --> 00:14:06.510
Gyges, and that's not an
accident.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:12.283
They mean wealthy Gyges;
tyrants are people who have

00:14:12.283 --> 00:14:18.990
lots of wealth and lots of
power, and they also rule.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:26.403
One translation that poets give
for tyrannidos is lofty

00:14:26.403 --> 00:14:31.629
despotism, that he rules not as
an equal,

00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:38.110
he rules not as a legitimate
king, he rules as a master

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.269
ruling slaves is the implication
of that.

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:47.606
It comes from the Greek
perspective, it comes from the

00:14:47.606 --> 00:14:50.470
east, it is not native to
Greeks,

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.351
it is something new in the
Greek experience,

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:57.169
they haven't had kings like
that even in their legends.

00:14:57.169 --> 00:15:02.561
So, that's going to be a
central idea that surrounds the

00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:06.340
concept of tyranny.
The Greek word that comes

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.367
closest to it,
but it doesn't do the same job

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:13.007
is monarchos,
our word monarch and that

00:15:13.007 --> 00:15:17.039
simply means a ruler who is one,
a single ruler.

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:19.783
Well, you know you need a
word for that in Greek because

00:15:19.783 --> 00:15:21.690
that's not the natural thing in
Greece.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.802
As you know already,
every regime that we have

00:15:24.802 --> 00:15:27.429
discussed from the Homeric world
on,

00:15:27.429 --> 00:15:32.336
post Bronze Age,
shows multiple kings as in the

00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:36.389
Iliad and the
Odyssey,

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:39.579
yes there is the generalissimo,
you remember Agamemnon,

00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:43.090
but everybody there is a king.
There's not just one king;

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.693
so that's the Greek way of
looking at things,

00:15:45.693 --> 00:15:49.008
whereas, the rest of the world
and if the Greeks had only

00:15:49.008 --> 00:15:51.706
known,
any where you look in the rest

00:15:51.706 --> 00:15:54.724
of the world,
the typical regime is monarchy

00:15:54.724 --> 00:15:58.830
of one kind or another,
absolute power.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:03.329
Nobody in Greece has absolute
power in the Greek point of

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:08.290
view, but kings elsewhere do.
But there's another sense

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:12.379
that Greeks attach to the word
tyrannos or

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:16.298
tyranneia,
and that is that the power is

00:16:16.298 --> 00:16:20.485
not legitimately acquired.
The Greeks could understand

00:16:20.485 --> 00:16:23.519
that there'd be somebody called
the basileus,

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:27.630
and that reason he was
basileus was that his

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.728
father was, and that the regime
of that state is royal and this

00:16:32.728 --> 00:16:35.769
is a perfectly legitimate
regime.

00:16:35.769 --> 00:16:39.676
The Greeks, although they don't
practice kingship during the

00:16:39.676 --> 00:16:42.921
period that we study,
they don't regard that as an

00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:46.649
illegitimate form of regime.
Kingship is legitimate;

00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:51.629
tyranny is not and I want to
spell that out for you.

00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:54.122
But before we get to my
spelling it out for you,

00:16:54.122 --> 00:16:57.305
let me just give it a few more
of the characteristics that it

00:16:57.305 --> 00:17:00.700
comes to have by classical times
in the minds of the Greeks.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.460
It is, as I say,
despotically exercised.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.910
It is not legitimate and one
aspect of its not being

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.819
legitimate is that it is not
responsible.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:16.028
A tyrannos does not have
to explain himself and nobody

00:17:16.028 --> 00:17:20.766
would dare insist that he do.
He need not consult anybody if

00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:23.716
he doesn't want to.
He doesn't need to have the

00:17:23.716 --> 00:17:26.683
approval of anybody.
All of that makes him

00:17:26.683 --> 00:17:29.854
illegitimate.
Irresponsible is another I

00:17:29.854 --> 00:17:33.959
think that fits into the
picture, because we shall see

00:17:33.959 --> 00:17:38.762
that certainly by the Classical
Period the Greeks felt that any

00:17:38.762 --> 00:17:43.332
regime to be legitimate must be
responsible in the technical

00:17:43.332 --> 00:17:46.581
sense.
It must be answerable to

00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:51.718
somebody because all human
beings, was the philosophical

00:17:51.718 --> 00:17:55.641
core of this idea,
are not to be trusted by

00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:58.941
complete power.
They will abuse it,

00:17:58.941 --> 00:18:03.083
they will abuse it with
violence, and that violence will

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:07.233
very often mean sexual violence,
but it will take every other

00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:07.990
form as well.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.705
Let's go back to
Archilochus' few words which are

00:18:14.705 --> 00:18:17.319
so rich in telling us so much
about it.

00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:20.730
He says, "I am not jealous of
the works of the gods."

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.279
What's that got to do with
anything?

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:25.542
Well, the Greek view of tyranny
was that tyrants,

00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:28.940
and one of the things that's
wrong with tyrants,

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.846
is that they see themselves as
rivaling the gods,

00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:35.940
as thinking themselves to be
divine,

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.238
or at least thinking that they
could act as though they were

00:18:39.238 --> 00:18:41.186
gods.
And because they have the power

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:43.144
and the wealth,
and because they have no

00:18:43.144 --> 00:18:46.486
responsibility to anybody,
presumably they can,

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:51.769
and this is one of the things
that makes them terrible.

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:57.637
It's this act of behaving as
though they were gods that

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:01.440
Greeks called hubris,
this arrogant,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.896
this violent,
arrogant kind of exercise of

00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:07.200
power.

00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:15.459
That is the way things looked
fundamentally in the Classical

00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:18.157
Period.
But even in the Classical

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:21.361
Period there was a remnant of
what I think,

00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:24.490
and most scholars I think would
agree,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:29.038
was the special characteristic
of the idea in its earlier

00:19:29.038 --> 00:19:33.180
days--which was not so much how
evil tyranny was,

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.152
because in the early days it's
not clear that they thought it

00:19:38.152 --> 00:19:42.792
was, but because of the fact
that it was not legitimately

00:19:42.792 --> 00:19:45.369
acquired.
It was not part of the

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:48.655
normal way things happened,
and I've mentioned this to you

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:51.194
earlier.
A good example of that is

00:19:51.194 --> 00:19:54.470
Oedipus Tyrannos,
Oedipus the King.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:59.779
Notice that nobody translates
it as Oedipus the tyrant.

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:02.750
They are right not to do so,
because it would mislead us.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.450
The way we use the word tyrant,
it's always bad.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:09.319
There's no good tyrant.
But you will often see it

00:20:09.319 --> 00:20:13.960
translated, Oedipus
Rex, into the Latin,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.029
but Rex means king.
So, Oedipus the King is okay.

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:20.742
Actually, it's not bad to say
Oedipus Rex,

00:20:20.742 --> 00:20:24.380
because the Romans had this
idea that kings were bad;

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.208
so there's a little bit of that
glittering around the edge,

00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:29.890
but for the Greeks that's not
there at the beginning.

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:37.849
The contemporaries of Gyges
and the tyrants that came after

00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:41.390
him in Greece probably didn't
use the term yet.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.637
It probably sprang up at a
later time, but we can't be sure

00:20:45.637 --> 00:20:48.180
of that.
For the Greeks it originally

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.541
meant something much more
neutral, without this great

00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:55.215
moral baggage to carry with it.
It simply meant more than

00:20:55.215 --> 00:20:56.809
anything else,
two things.

00:20:56.809 --> 00:20:59.857
One man rule,
well that would always raise an

00:20:59.857 --> 00:21:02.904
eyebrow, but you could imagine
it being okay,

00:21:02.904 --> 00:21:06.089
and the fact that it was
unconstitutional.

00:21:06.089 --> 00:21:10.101
It did not come about in a way
that followed tradition,

00:21:10.101 --> 00:21:12.998
which was what Greek
constitutions were,

00:21:12.998 --> 00:21:15.970
traditional sets of laws or
customs.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.720
Okay, that's the general
picture;

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.880
let's take a look at tyranny as
it emerges in Greece,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.000
and we don't know very much
about it.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.220
Here's another one of these
cases where we are dependent on

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.348
later sources,
we have no--I think I'm right

00:21:32.348 --> 00:21:36.350
in saying nothing really
contemporary at all that speaks

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.770
about any tyrant and so that's a
problem,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.716
but we have to deal with that.
Then there are very limited

00:21:42.716 --> 00:21:45.969
tales that are told about them,
so that we have to piece

00:21:45.969 --> 00:21:49.399
together a lot of information
and ask ourselves what it all

00:21:49.399 --> 00:21:51.353
means.
In any case,

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:57.868
the first tyrant named in the
Greek tradition is a man called

00:21:57.868 --> 00:22:02.140
Pheidon of Argos,
who is mentioned by Aristotle

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.835
in his Politics,
and he says some interesting

00:22:05.835 --> 00:22:08.494
things.
I'll come back in a moment,

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:12.793
but here are some of the facts
or alleged facts that surround

00:22:12.793 --> 00:22:16.776
Pheidon in the Greek tradition.
He is the King of Argos,

00:22:16.776 --> 00:22:20.450
and Argos you know in the
Homeric tradition is a very big,

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:25.381
powerful, important place;
Argos includes Mycenae and all

00:22:25.381 --> 00:22:29.136
of that.
So, this would be a king of a

00:22:29.136 --> 00:22:34.724
large and important area.
The Argives and Pheidon as

00:22:34.724 --> 00:22:39.290
king of Argos,
were engaged in a conflict with

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:44.363
Sparta as to who would be the
dominant force in the

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:48.861
Peloponnesus,
and they fought a battle at a

00:22:48.861 --> 00:22:54.482
place called Hysiae in the 668
in which the Argives in a fight

00:22:54.482 --> 00:22:58.000
undefeated the Spartans,
and really defeated him;

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.569
it wasn't just a little
skirmish.

00:22:59.569 --> 00:23:03.297
They were now the top dog,
as proven by the following

00:23:03.297 --> 00:23:06.809
other alleged facts about what's
going on here.

00:23:06.809 --> 00:23:11.646
Pheidon got himself elected
chairman, president of the

00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:15.699
Olympic Festival.
That was a tremendous honor and

00:23:15.699 --> 00:23:19.589
it indicated deference to him
and scholars suggest,

00:23:19.589 --> 00:23:23.427
if it really happened,
it would have suggested that

00:23:23.427 --> 00:23:27.495
the Argives and Pheidon were the
dominant force in the

00:23:27.495 --> 00:23:30.661
Peloponnesus.
And there is further evidence,

00:23:30.661 --> 00:23:33.206
and this is really rather
better evidence,

00:23:33.206 --> 00:23:36.120
I think even than that.
It is the fact,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.890
I don't hesitate to use that
fact, that Pheidon or Argos

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:46.180
apparently imposed a system of
uniform weights and measures on

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:51.123
the entire Peloponnesus and
those remained the weights and

00:23:51.123 --> 00:23:55.980
measures employed in the
Peloponnesus thereafter,

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.930
so that they were called the
Pheidonian measures.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.396
You don't do that if you're not
in effective control of the

00:24:04.396 --> 00:24:06.755
region.
Nothing is more basic than

00:24:06.755 --> 00:24:10.647
determining something like that.
So I think that lends

00:24:10.647 --> 00:24:14.710
considerable plausibility to the
general story.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:19.622
It is also said that he was
a leader of the army,

00:24:19.622 --> 00:24:24.724
which was a hoplite army,
and that his success depended

00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:29.920
upon his successful leadership
of the hoplite army.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.593
Well, that fits in with one
general interpretation that

00:24:33.593 --> 00:24:36.789
scholars have used about the
rise of tyrants.

00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:41.988
Nobody claims it's universal,
but one feature that seems to

00:24:41.988 --> 00:24:47.187
be plausibly present is that the
new way of fighting in the

00:24:47.187 --> 00:24:51.244
hoplite phalanx,
which was to turn out to be

00:24:51.244 --> 00:24:56.109
decisive, well that brought
about the leaders who were very

00:24:56.109 --> 00:25:00.722
good leaders of hoplite
phalanxes and should they decide

00:25:00.722 --> 00:25:05.420
to seize power in any state
where they had been doing the

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.683
leadership,
they could typically count on

00:25:08.683 --> 00:25:12.189
their army, the army they had
led to assist them--all which

00:25:12.189 --> 00:25:15.817
makes obvious sense if you're
going to get the fighting force

00:25:15.817 --> 00:25:18.779
around and they like you and
you're popular,

00:25:18.779 --> 00:25:21.640
and you want to be a boss,
that's your best shot.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.375
So, tradition also lends some
small support to the idea that

00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:29.109
maybe that's how Pheidon brought
himself to the kingship.

00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:32.225
Before I depart,
I just feel it necessary to

00:25:32.225 --> 00:25:35.059
make one small point.
I said weights and measures.

00:25:35.059 --> 00:25:38.881
There are elements in the
ancient tradition that also say

00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:42.429
that Pheidon was the first
man--I want to put it very

00:25:42.429 --> 00:25:45.283
carefully and literally,
because it's all part of the

00:25:45.283 --> 00:25:48.924
argument.
He was the first man to strike

00:25:48.924 --> 00:25:53.109
silver coins on the island of
Aegina.

00:25:53.109 --> 00:25:58.755
Coins have not been present in
Greece prior to this time and

00:25:58.755 --> 00:26:03.731
the most well-informed and
professionally skilled and

00:26:03.731 --> 00:26:07.182
capable people,
and almost everybody who

00:26:07.182 --> 00:26:09.970
studies the subject says,
this is false.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.557
There were no coins in the
Greek world yet and there aren't

00:26:13.557 --> 00:26:16.650
going to be any for a very long
time afterwards.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:23.535
So, this is merely a myth.
I'm sorry to say that in spite

00:26:23.535 --> 00:26:26.214
of the fact that I am not an
expert, or a numismatist,

00:26:26.214 --> 00:26:28.690
and everybody's against me,
they're all wrong.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.967
I won't put you through the
pain of listening to the

00:26:34.967 --> 00:26:38.296
argument, but just keep in the
back of your mind one day

00:26:38.296 --> 00:26:41.747
somebody's going to find hard
evidence that I'm absolutely

00:26:41.747 --> 00:26:45.765
right about this,
and so then you can tweak and

00:26:45.765 --> 00:26:49.549
say, aha because that's it.
But right now no sensible

00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:52.549
person that has any credit in
the field at all believes me.

00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:54.001
There are about two or three
people maybe,

00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:54.780
but that's about it.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.119
Another very interesting
important element about Pheidon.

00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:08.100
Aristotle tells us he was a
king who became a tyrant,

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.616
and by now you know the Greek
words, he was basileus,

00:27:12.616 --> 00:27:17.099
who became tyrannos.
Now, how did he do that?

00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:20.865
You would think if a man was
king and that implies

00:27:20.865 --> 00:27:25.244
legitimacy, how do you become an
illegitimate thing like a

00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:27.503
tyrant?
We can only speculate,

00:27:27.503 --> 00:27:31.228
but I think from what we've
learned already about the early

00:27:31.228 --> 00:27:33.990
Greek kings in those towns that
had any,

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.519
that they were Homeric kings.
They were not really monarchs;

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:40.849
they were not really powerful
rulers.

00:27:40.849 --> 00:27:44.380
They did not simply dominate
everybody and give orders.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.264
They were maybe the most
striking, or the best connected,

00:27:48.264 --> 00:27:51.871
or the best descended of a
bunch of noblemen who were

00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:55.620
roughly equal.
Well, if we imagine that's the

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.538
way Pheidon began and then--I'm
just making up the story you

00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:05.372
understand--then he himself led
the Argive phalanx to these

00:28:05.372 --> 00:28:09.791
tremendous successes,
defeating the Spartans,

00:28:09.791 --> 00:28:15.470
establishing Argos as the
president of the Olympic Games,

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:20.968
giving weights measures and
heaven help us maybe coins to

00:28:20.968 --> 00:28:26.958
the people of the Peloponnesus
and then began to act as though

00:28:26.958 --> 00:28:30.953
he really was the boss,
because he could,

00:28:30.953 --> 00:28:35.535
and people recognized that and
said, you know he's not just

00:28:35.535 --> 00:28:38.993
king anymore,
he has made himself a

00:28:38.993 --> 00:28:42.860
tyrannos.
Something like that would make

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.830
sense of Aristotle's statement.
Now, this raises the

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.746
question, which is to be raised
whenever we think about

00:28:50.746 --> 00:28:54.009
tyrannos coming to power
in Greece.

00:28:54.009 --> 00:28:56.888
Okay, he wants to be king,
he's popular and all those

00:28:56.888 --> 00:29:00.664
things, but what does it take?
Well, it takes military force

00:29:00.664 --> 00:29:04.949
because there are people who are
going to resist and so I would

00:29:04.949 --> 00:29:08.192
suggest,
again nothing original about

00:29:08.192 --> 00:29:13.069
this, that the positive
connection with the hoplite army

00:29:13.069 --> 00:29:18.390
now emerging in these states has
to be part of the story.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:22.539
Why would these hoplites
support a tyranny?

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:27.389
It doesn't really accord with
their own long range interest or

00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:31.523
the autonomy and the
independence that are so clearly

00:29:31.523 --> 00:29:35.339
a part of what it is to be a
hoplite farmer.

00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:39.737
Well, I think the best answer
would be that that's what had to

00:29:39.737 --> 00:29:44.206
be done to break the monopoly of
power and influence of the old

00:29:44.206 --> 00:29:47.200
aristocracy,
which would have been

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.458
presumably resisting the changes
in society that were part of

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:56.809
that hoplite uprising,
that development of hoplites,

00:29:56.809 --> 00:30:01.128
the movement towards a hoplite
community and so they joined

00:30:01.128 --> 00:30:05.298
with a leader who had what it
took to make it work and to

00:30:05.298 --> 00:30:09.393
destroy the power of the
aristocracy and to create a new

00:30:09.393 --> 00:30:13.339
kind of state with a new kind of
constitution.

00:30:13.339 --> 00:30:17.534
But the first step would have
been a tyranny,

00:30:17.534 --> 00:30:23.348
because that's the way they got
to where they had to go in the

00:30:23.348 --> 00:30:26.973
first instance.
Now, this is easy to

00:30:26.973 --> 00:30:29.089
connect again,
theoretically,

00:30:29.089 --> 00:30:33.774
because we just don't have the
kind of hard evidence that would

00:30:33.774 --> 00:30:38.308
make it possible to be sure--to
join this hoplite development

00:30:38.308 --> 00:30:42.539
with other changes that are
occurring in society,

00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:46.735
and that is to say,
the economic change that means

00:30:46.735 --> 00:30:51.616
trade is becoming more and more
important and so is simple

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:54.809
industry.
There are now people in society

00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:58.029
who by virtue of what they do to
make a living,

00:30:58.029 --> 00:31:02.915
get ahead, don't fit in to the
traditional aristocratic system,

00:31:02.915 --> 00:31:07.170
who don't have what they want
in terms of influence,

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.984
power, recognition,
because there hasn't been a

00:31:09.984 --> 00:31:13.899
place for such people before and
the people who are in charge are

00:31:13.899 --> 00:31:16.529
not about to give it away very
readily,

00:31:16.529 --> 00:31:21.130
and so they might very well
also assist.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.663
Let us imagine,
the hoplite farmers as being

00:31:23.663 --> 00:31:26.549
the guys who do the fighting for
the most part,

00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:30.763
but joined and supported by
these other elements in society

00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:33.670
who need a change for the same
reason.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:39.103
That fits rather nicely with
where we find the earliest

00:31:39.103 --> 00:31:42.290
colonies.
Argos is a special place

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:46.450
but Argos, in addition to being
a fine agricultural area,

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:50.240
also from an early time had
commercial activity.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.397
So, that would be good.
But then on top of that,

00:31:52.397 --> 00:31:55.468
the next three towns I'm going
to mention as being very active

00:31:55.468 --> 00:31:58.740
in colonization--you're familiar
with that from our last talk,

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:03.397
Corinth and a little town that
I haven't mentioned before,

00:32:03.397 --> 00:32:08.382
but it's right next to Corinth
and surely was part of the same

00:32:08.382 --> 00:32:12.550
set of developments that we've
described there,

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.627
a place called Sicyon.
It also has an early tyrannical

00:32:16.627 --> 00:32:20.887
family and Megara which is
located--I should say Sicyon is

00:32:20.887 --> 00:32:24.700
sort of to the south and to the
west of Corinth,

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.720
and Megara is to the north and
to the east or Corinth.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.093
It's right on and around the
Isthmus of Corinth that some of

00:32:32.093 --> 00:32:36.170
these early states that have
tyrants come into being,

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:40.804
just as these are states that
are very, very active in the

00:32:40.804 --> 00:32:43.735
colonial movement.
If we go away from the

00:32:43.735 --> 00:32:46.167
mainland, again,
Miletus has a tyrant at a

00:32:46.167 --> 00:32:48.719
fairly early time,
just as you would expect,

00:32:48.719 --> 00:32:51.329
because it fits into the whole
picture.

00:32:51.329 --> 00:32:55.809
You don't have tyrannies
very early, if at all,

00:32:55.809 --> 00:32:59.821
in places like Athens.
We will have a famous tyrant,

00:32:59.821 --> 00:33:04.138
but that will come later.
Thebes will not have a tyrant

00:33:04.138 --> 00:33:08.430
in spite of the mythology
surrounding Oedipus.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:12.975
Sparta, of course,
never has the tyrant so all of

00:33:12.975 --> 00:33:18.278
this is sort of reasonable
support for the interpretation

00:33:18.278 --> 00:33:23.102
that most scholars take.
So, you have all of this stuff,

00:33:23.102 --> 00:33:26.395
the pressure of a growing
population, new groups

00:33:26.395 --> 00:33:30.039
challenging the aristocracy,
hoplites among them.

00:33:30.039 --> 00:33:34.599
If you go to Corinth the story
of the establishment of a

00:33:34.599 --> 00:33:39.160
tyranny there involves an
individual called Cypselus,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.610
and the stories that are told
about Cypselus fit pretty

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.549
decently into what we've been
talking about.

00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:49.013
He is specifically a
polemarch,

00:33:49.013 --> 00:33:52.101
which means the war
archon,

00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:57.111
the war leader.
He was commander of the army in

00:33:57.111 --> 00:34:03.680
Corinth, and at that time that
would have been a hoplite army.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.529
But he was not a king like
Pheidon;

00:34:07.529 --> 00:34:10.960
he was, according to the
myth--I shouldn't say myth,

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.986
because it isn't a myth.
According to the legend--no,

00:34:13.986 --> 00:34:17.289
it's not really even a legend;
let's say tradition.

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:22.306
According to the tradition,
Cypselus was a descendant from

00:34:22.306 --> 00:34:27.059
a mixed marriage between a
patrician, an aristocrat and

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:31.912
somebody who was not.
So, that's a very sort of

00:34:31.912 --> 00:34:35.845
typical historical development;
people who become

00:34:35.845 --> 00:34:38.744
revolutionaries and
troublemakers are often people

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:42.007
on the margin,
but who have by birth some kind

00:34:42.007 --> 00:34:46.304
of a connection or think they
have some kind of a connection

00:34:46.304 --> 00:34:49.289
with the higher ranks and are
annoyed,

00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:53.135
irritated, angry,
jealous and therefore likely to

00:34:53.135 --> 00:34:58.823
take the trouble to seize power.
I mean, Napoleon descended from

00:34:58.823 --> 00:35:02.170
some kind of Corsican
aristocracy.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:07.155
Of course, the French thought
that that was--what is it when a

00:35:07.155 --> 00:35:09.280
word contradicts itself?

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.759
What's the word?
No not paradox,

00:35:15.759 --> 00:35:20.095
oxymoron, that's right.
The French thought it was an

00:35:20.095 --> 00:35:24.400
oxymoron, a Corsican aristocrat;
I mean ridiculous.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.179
But that was his feeling and
that kind of French attitude

00:35:28.179 --> 00:35:31.690
helped, I think explain,
the drive that he had to get

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:36.418
ahead to the way he did.
Anyway, Cypselus was one of

00:35:36.418 --> 00:35:40.092
that group.
Corinth, I might point out,

00:35:40.092 --> 00:35:44.917
was an unusual polis
before the emergence of the

00:35:44.917 --> 00:35:47.927
tyranny,
because most polis as

00:35:47.927 --> 00:35:51.839
best we can figure it out,
they had an aristocracy that

00:35:51.839 --> 00:35:55.889
consisted of many,
many, many, many families,

00:35:55.889 --> 00:36:00.949
but Corinth had the narrowest
of all aristocracies.

00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:05.960
One family who were called the
Bacchiads completely monopolized

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.647
the regime and so that meant it
would be easier once you've

00:36:10.647 --> 00:36:15.791
started to make trouble,
to find help against them from

00:36:15.791 --> 00:36:20.690
a rather powerful people who
were in other states,

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:26.280
likely to be part of the
regime, but here were cut out.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:32.425
So, Cypselus puts together
a force of military folks with

00:36:32.425 --> 00:36:37.956
some folks who are discontented
and finally attacks the

00:36:37.956 --> 00:36:42.402
Bacchiads,
either killed them or drove

00:36:42.402 --> 00:36:48.650
them into exile and then he
establishes his own regime,

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.564
which is in fact,
one of the most successful

00:36:51.564 --> 00:36:55.360
tyrannies, at least as judged by
the most basic thing,

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.075
how long do they last?
Cypselus, in effect,

00:36:58.075 --> 00:37:02.899
died in bed leaving the tyranny
to his son and then his son had

00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:07.800
another son who became tyrant
and he was driven out finally,

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.972
and he was the last of them.
So the Cypselid tyranny is a

00:37:11.972 --> 00:37:16.750
very successful one and we know
something about it.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.126
The colonization movement,
which the Corinthians had

00:37:20.126 --> 00:37:23.171
already started,
but it really took a real hold

00:37:23.171 --> 00:37:27.495
in the time of the Cypselus,
and so Corinth is colonizing

00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:31.750
quite vigorously in the time of
the Cypselid tyranny,

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:37.945
mostly, out in the west,
that sort of empty territory

00:37:37.945 --> 00:37:43.316
from a Greek point of view,
and so you will see Corinthian

00:37:43.316 --> 00:37:47.020
colonies stretching out along
the shore, the north shore of

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.330
the Gulf of Corinth,
and north shore is less Greek

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.519
and more barbaric than the south
shore which is the Peloponessus.

00:37:54.519 --> 00:37:59.199
Then if you go to the end of
Greece as far west as you go,

00:37:59.199 --> 00:38:04.289
and make a right turn and head
up into the Adriatic region--I'm

00:38:04.289 --> 00:38:08.300
sorry,
the Ionian Sea and beyond that

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.131
the Adriatic.
Corinthian colonies are

00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:13.964
right along in there and they
suggest, and I think they're

00:38:13.964 --> 00:38:16.250
supported by other
archaeological evidence,

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:21.206
that commerce was one of the
things that was very important

00:38:21.206 --> 00:38:25.650
for Cypselus and Corinth is
booming from a commercial

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:31.119
economic point of view in the
years of the Cypselid tyrants.

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:34.425
None of that is surprising,
all of this is very

00:38:34.425 --> 00:38:38.951
characteristic of this phase of
Greek tyranny that we're talking

00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:40.970
about.
In addition to that,

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.937
we know that Cypselus like just
about all the tyrants used his

00:38:44.937 --> 00:38:48.839
power to do something that the
Greek governments normally did

00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:52.629
not do,
namely, collect taxes from

00:38:52.629 --> 00:38:56.738
their people.
You have to understand that the

00:38:56.738 --> 00:39:01.073
idea of taxation being normal
would have gotten a Greek

00:39:01.073 --> 00:39:05.204
foaming at the mouth.
When there is no tyranny,

00:39:05.204 --> 00:39:09.260
there's no taxes,
no direct tax I should say.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:14.129
The normal form of taxation
that existed in the Greek world,

00:39:14.129 --> 00:39:18.173
when it was in its independent
polis phase,

00:39:18.173 --> 00:39:21.309
is simply customs duties on
trade.

00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:26.510
But the hoplite farmer wasn't
going to be taxed.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:32.121
Paying taxes is what barbarians
did to their kings,

00:39:32.121 --> 00:39:36.347
a very powerful feeling.
People like that in America

00:39:36.347 --> 00:39:38.140
today used to be called
republicans.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.789
No surprise that Cypselus
and his descendants,

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:52.739
just like the other tyrants,
were very wealthy.

00:39:52.739 --> 00:39:56.432
There was undoubtedly wealth
they seized when they took

00:39:56.432 --> 00:40:00.673
power, but there was also wealth
that they could enjoy from the

00:40:00.673 --> 00:40:05.050
tremendous income that would
come from the booming commerce,

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.554
and then finally taxation.
Just put it right smack from

00:40:08.554 --> 00:40:12.901
somebody hands into theirs and
so tremendous wealth is another

00:40:12.901 --> 00:40:15.110
picture that goes with this.

00:40:19.429 --> 00:40:23.024
If you go to Sicyon,
another element comes into the

00:40:23.024 --> 00:40:26.690
picture, which may or may not
have occurred in other

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:30.429
tyrannical towns.
We do know that it played a

00:40:30.429 --> 00:40:33.553
role in Sicyon.
There, the founder of the

00:40:33.553 --> 00:40:36.871
tyranny was a man called
Orthagoras, and again,

00:40:36.871 --> 00:40:41.200
one thing we are told about him
is that he was polemarch,

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.929
leader of the phalanx.
So we understand that.

00:40:45.929 --> 00:40:50.578
Another story says that he was
a cook and they didn't mean an

00:40:50.578 --> 00:40:53.289
Escoffier, or anything like
that.

00:40:53.289 --> 00:40:56.373
I mean that was not a high
ranking position,

00:40:56.373 --> 00:41:00.461
and so I think the implication
was he came from a very low

00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:02.260
source.
We don't know what to do with

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.125
that;
it sounds surprising,

00:41:04.125 --> 00:41:08.480
but maybe it's true.
Anyway, we get down to the

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:13.880
point where one of his
descendants is still tyrant;

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.869
I think it's his son,
Cleisthenes of Sicyon.

00:41:17.869 --> 00:41:20.008
Well, now you want to keep that
name in your mind and you want

00:41:20.008 --> 00:41:23.734
to keep it straight,
there will be a descendant of

00:41:23.734 --> 00:41:28.521
that guy, who will be an
Athenian, whose name is

00:41:28.521 --> 00:41:31.471
Cleisthenes,
he will not only be later but

00:41:31.471 --> 00:41:33.518
thoroughly different;
not a tyrant,

00:41:33.518 --> 00:41:37.080
quite different from that.
So just remember this is

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.116
Cleisthenes of Sikyon as opposed
to Cleisthenes,

00:41:40.116 --> 00:41:42.799
the Athenian.
Well, the picture that

00:41:42.799 --> 00:41:45.717
Herodotus, who is one of our
main sources here,

00:41:45.717 --> 00:41:49.626
the main source I guess,
gives us in Sicyon,

00:41:49.626 --> 00:41:56.448
is one of political oppression
of a kind that we haven't run

00:41:56.448 --> 00:42:03.385
into yet because it is based
on--really on ethnic origins and

00:42:03.385 --> 00:42:07.462
ethnic differences.
Here we see,

00:42:07.462 --> 00:42:13.977
I think without any question,
a case of the pre-Dorian Greeks

00:42:13.977 --> 00:42:20.057
who have been defeated and
conquered by Dorians and these

00:42:20.057 --> 00:42:26.679
groups have been kept separate
throughout the centuries,

00:42:26.679 --> 00:42:31.619
and one was top dog and the
other was the underdog.

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:37.110
So, what has happened obviously
is that part of the tyrants

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:42.980
coming to power must have been a
reversal of that situation,

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:51.470
because the leading forces are
anti-Dorian, very powerfully

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:54.746
anti-Dorian.
They hate Argos,

00:42:54.746 --> 00:42:57.813
because Argos in the
Iliad and the

00:42:57.813 --> 00:43:00.726
Odyssey,
the great leader of the

00:43:00.726 --> 00:43:03.966
Peloponnesians,
the wrong guys,

00:43:03.966 --> 00:43:09.769
and of course Argos in their
day is a Dorian city.

00:43:09.769 --> 00:43:11.405
You don't have to go back to
the Iliad and the

00:43:11.405 --> 00:43:13.887
Odyssey.
I should have--I mean back to

00:43:13.887 --> 00:43:17.110
the days of Pheidon,
the Argives would have ruled

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:20.200
Sicyon presumably if Pheidon was
in charge.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.756
Well, they didn't like that;
they had achieved I presume,

00:43:23.756 --> 00:43:27.894
an overthrow of that.
So, they're anti-Argos,

00:43:27.894 --> 00:43:33.119
anti-Dorian and they introduced
changes in the tribes.

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:36.192
If you go to any Dorian town in
the Greek world,

00:43:36.192 --> 00:43:39.722
there are three tribes,
they have the same names in all

00:43:39.722 --> 00:43:43.580
Dorian towns and that's the way
the world is organized.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.955
So what did they do?
These guys, the Orthagorids

00:43:48.955 --> 00:43:53.444
changed the tribes.
That's interesting too because

00:43:53.444 --> 00:43:56.810
we'll see that Cleisthenes the
Athenian does the same thing.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.900
That's amazing;
that's very rare.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.692
When you're talking about
changes in tribal things,

00:44:02.692 --> 00:44:06.409
you're getting at the oldest
possible memories,

00:44:06.409 --> 00:44:08.621
and traditions,
and beliefs,

00:44:08.621 --> 00:44:12.469
and associations that primitive
peoples have.

00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:16.365
So, when you're fussing with
that you're really making a

00:44:16.365 --> 00:44:19.198
great problem,
but you'll see in a moment

00:44:19.198 --> 00:44:21.889
what's driving this sort of
thing.

00:44:21.889 --> 00:44:25.823
Instead of having three tribes
thereafter, from once the

00:44:25.823 --> 00:44:28.326
Orthagrads got there,
they had four,

00:44:28.326 --> 00:44:31.760
but they changed the names of
the old three.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.186
The old three now were
called--I'm translating the

00:44:37.186 --> 00:44:40.730
Greek words, ass men,
pig men,

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:45.855
and swine men whereas the
non-Dorians were the

00:44:45.855 --> 00:44:50.639
archelaoi,
leaders of the people.

00:44:50.639 --> 00:44:55.080
You can see very objective set
of names and evaluations;

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.504
so you've got vengeance here.
You've got a group long

00:44:59.504 --> 00:45:03.819
annoyed, long angered,
long feeling oppressed,

00:45:03.819 --> 00:45:08.900
taking out their hatred when
the victory comes in.

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.282
But once you're past this
peculiarity, this particular

00:45:12.282 --> 00:45:15.728
ethnic conflict in this town
that had such an important

00:45:15.728 --> 00:45:18.203
effect,
you find that the tyrants are

00:45:18.203 --> 00:45:20.650
pretty much like all the other
tyrants.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:24.654
They have great wealth and
we'll come back in just a moment

00:45:24.654 --> 00:45:27.139
to indicate how striking that
was.

00:45:27.139 --> 00:45:31.468
They engage in conspicuous
display, which is what tyrants

00:45:31.468 --> 00:45:35.720
also do, and they are filled
with a tremendous ego and a

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.739
terrific sense of their own
importance and self,

00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:43.198
and so the kind of thing that
made Archilochus say,

00:45:43.198 --> 00:45:47.003
"I'm not going to try to vie
with the gods the way these

00:45:47.003 --> 00:45:49.463
tyrants do."
Well, the story that

00:45:49.463 --> 00:45:52.000
Herodotus tells and I think you
will enjoy it,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.270
in his wonderful prose if you
haven't gotten to it yet.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.599
Cleisthenes of Sicyon now is in
charge;

00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:09.399
we're in the sixth century
B.C., and he has a daughter and

00:46:09.399 --> 00:46:15.097
he wants her to have the very
best husband that there was

00:46:15.097 --> 00:46:19.034
available in Greece.
Just like your parents,

00:46:19.034 --> 00:46:22.866
he felt the same way as your
parents do, but he was going to

00:46:22.866 --> 00:46:25.659
see to it that it was going to
work out.

00:46:25.659 --> 00:46:28.784
By the way, he himself was a
very significant figure,

00:46:28.784 --> 00:46:32.690
and this again makes him not so
very unusual among the tyrants.

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:38.007
He entered in the Olympic
competition, and in those days,

00:46:38.007 --> 00:46:42.090
in probably forever in the
Olympic Games,

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:46.060
I mean the ancient Olympic
Games, the most prestigious,

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.590
the most important contest was
the four-horse,

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.708
horse race, the chariot race.
For one thing,

00:46:52.708 --> 00:46:55.170
you couldn't do that unless you
were very rich.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:58.296
So, it meant that the noblest
and wealthiest people were

00:46:58.296 --> 00:47:00.570
competing against one another in
this.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.155
Well, he was the winner in the
four-horse chariot race which

00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:07.316
made him an international
celebrity on top of all the

00:47:07.316 --> 00:47:09.929
other things that he had going
for him.

00:47:09.929 --> 00:47:12.582
So, he decides by God he's
going to have the best guy in

00:47:12.582 --> 00:47:14.269
Greece be his daughter's
husband.

00:47:14.269 --> 00:47:18.994
He invites all the best
aristocratic,

00:47:18.994 --> 00:47:25.293
richest, handsomest,
most athletic guys in all of

00:47:25.293 --> 00:47:31.329
Greece to come to Sicyon and
spend a year,

00:47:31.329 --> 00:47:36.388
at his expense,
and treated royally all that

00:47:36.388 --> 00:47:43.328
time to compete for the hand of
his daughter and so they all

00:47:43.328 --> 00:47:45.971
are.
Herodotus reads off the

00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:49.374
names of all of these amazing
young men who come to the

00:47:49.374 --> 00:47:52.554
competition,
pretty much I think,

00:47:52.554 --> 00:47:59.147
copying Homer's catalog of the
ships in the Iliad and

00:47:59.147 --> 00:48:03.558
they come.
Well, after the bulk of this

00:48:03.558 --> 00:48:08.420
year, it is clear two finalists
are emerging.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:14.192
One of them is called
Hippocleides and the other is

00:48:14.192 --> 00:48:18.022
called Megacles.
Megacles, we better take

00:48:18.022 --> 00:48:21.820
seriously because he's an
Athenian and he will be the

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.179
ancestor of Cleisthenes of
Athens later on.

00:48:25.179 --> 00:48:28.303
But anyway, they're competing
in every respect,

00:48:28.303 --> 00:48:31.969
and we're down to the last
kinds of things and it looks

00:48:31.969 --> 00:48:36.211
Hippocleides has on the edge.
He seems to be the number one

00:48:36.211 --> 00:48:40.420
candidate and he has quite a few
belts at the party when we're

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.250
reaching the final stages of all
this,

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:49.510
and next he jumps on a table
and he begins dancing wildly.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:53.185
I mean like beyond what is seen
to be seemingly dancing,

00:48:53.185 --> 00:48:56.460
we expect a young nobleman to
be a good dancer,

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:00.478
but this guy is doing stuff
that nobody ever heard of and

00:49:00.478 --> 00:49:03.780
this is making Cleisthenes a
little nervous.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:08.179
I mean who is this guy?
What's happening here?

00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:13.617
Then he flips upside down and
begins to dance on his hands,

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:18.773
with his feet flipping around
in the air, at which point

00:49:18.773 --> 00:49:24.316
Herodotus tells us.
Cleisthenes speaks up and says,

00:49:24.316 --> 00:49:29.451
son of Tysander you have danced
your bride away,

00:49:29.451 --> 00:49:35.569
he lost and Megacles got to
marry Aragriste and the story

00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:38.169
goes on.
Well, what are we to

00:49:38.169 --> 00:49:40.411
believe of that tale?
I don't know,

00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:45.258
but this much I think is clear.
Such a legend does not come

00:49:45.258 --> 00:49:48.375
from nothing.
The picture is first of all of

00:49:48.375 --> 00:49:52.170
a man who is fabulously wealthy.
Think of the kind of

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.019
entertaining he is said to have
done.

00:49:55.019 --> 00:50:00.276
Also, fabulously full of
himself, just imagine saying my

00:50:00.276 --> 00:50:06.010
daughter will only marry the
very best young man there is,

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:09.324
and you will all have to go out
there and compete for her hand

00:50:09.324 --> 00:50:11.770
and I'll tell you who she's
going to marry.

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:17.312
Who can then act the way he did.
I think that's a picture that

00:50:17.312 --> 00:50:22.682
he probably was extreme in all
of these respects and that kind

00:50:22.682 --> 00:50:25.940
of situation was part of the
tale.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:30.449
So, let me just sum up some
things.

00:50:30.449 --> 00:50:35.130
Untraditional root to power is
important.

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:38.159
Gyges, perhaps you remember the
story of Gyges.

00:50:38.159 --> 00:50:43.659
Gyges was sort of the prime
minister of the King of Lydia

00:50:43.659 --> 00:50:49.256
and the king had this incredibly
beautiful wife and he was

00:50:49.256 --> 00:50:53.342
terribly proud of her,
and so he said to Gyges,

00:50:53.342 --> 00:50:57.110
you can't believe how gorgeous
my wife is, and Gyges says,

00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:58.860
of course she's wonderfully
beautiful.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.530
You can't tell with her clothes
on for God's sake.

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.702
He says, come on, come with me.
Gyges says, no,

00:51:05.702 --> 00:51:08.659
no, no please your majesty.
He says, come with me.

00:51:08.659 --> 00:51:13.145
So, there's Gyges hidden behind
a curtain and here's his wife

00:51:13.145 --> 00:51:16.510
disrobing and indeed she was as
advertised.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:25.265
The king goes out,
and Gyges would have slipped

00:51:25.265 --> 00:51:29.258
away, but the queen spots him
and, of course,

00:51:29.258 --> 00:51:34.346
she's totally disgraced.
She's deeply embarrassed just

00:51:34.346 --> 00:51:36.717
to put it very,
very mildly,

00:51:36.717 --> 00:51:41.497
and so she says to him,
unless you do what I tell you I

00:51:41.497 --> 00:51:46.250
will tell my husband that you
sneaked in and did this and he

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:51.506
will kill you.
But what I want you to do is to

00:51:51.506 --> 00:51:55.719
kill him and marry me.
That's how you can make it up.

00:51:55.719 --> 00:52:00.400
What could Gyges do?So he
did;

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.618
that's how he became king.
This is not your normal

00:52:04.618 --> 00:52:07.330
constitutional procedure even in
Lydia.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:12.960
So that's Gyges;
Pheidon I've talked to you

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.720
about already.
Theagenes of Megara I haven't

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.318
mentioned, but he comes to power
by force, with the use of the

00:52:19.318 --> 00:52:22.090
soldiers and same thing is true
of Cypselas.

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:27.099
All these tyrants get there by
means that are not traditional.

00:52:27.099 --> 00:52:30.095
They have personal power,
whatever else is going on,

00:52:30.095 --> 00:52:32.210
they have control of the
military,

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:36.863
and the military gives them
what they need in the way of

00:52:36.863 --> 00:52:40.191
command.
They have to have skill--the

00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:44.710
founder of the dynasty at least
has to have skill.

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:48.306
In order to be a soldier he has
to be a good talker to get

00:52:48.306 --> 00:52:51.679
people to go along with him.
He's got to have talent.

00:52:51.679 --> 00:52:54.844
It's not the easiest thing in
the world to overthrow a

00:52:54.844 --> 00:52:57.710
traditional regime and make
yourself the boss.

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:01.045
He would have had these
qualities, but he's got to have

00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:04.072
support out there from the
various elements that I

00:53:04.072 --> 00:53:07.558
mentioned to you,
prestige from some great deed,

00:53:07.558 --> 00:53:11.133
whatever it might be,
military victory or athletic

00:53:11.133 --> 00:53:12.520
victory perhaps.

00:53:16.679 --> 00:53:19.677
When he has wealth,
once he's acquired wealth,

00:53:19.677 --> 00:53:23.407
he can use it further to
strengthen his position and they

00:53:23.407 --> 00:53:27.678
typically do,
because he introduces something

00:53:27.678 --> 00:53:32.314
new, mercenary soldiers.
It's one thing to seize the

00:53:32.314 --> 00:53:36.047
power with the help of the
hoplites, but to hold onto it

00:53:36.047 --> 00:53:39.780
you're going to need something
more solid than that.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.654
First of all,
hoplites don't stick around in

00:53:41.654 --> 00:53:43.625
uniform;
they go back and work their

00:53:43.625 --> 00:53:46.068
fields.
So, they're not around to

00:53:46.068 --> 00:53:50.999
suppress anything that needs to
be suppressed most of the time,

00:53:50.999 --> 00:53:54.340
but beyond that tyrants grow
unpopular.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:58.429
This is one of the great rules
of politics in any system.

00:53:58.429 --> 00:54:01.811
The one question that's in the
minds of all people who have

00:54:01.811 --> 00:54:04.900
anything to do with it,
and that is what have you done

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.881
for me lately?
Any benefit that people might

00:54:07.881 --> 00:54:11.210
have achieved from the
establishment of the tyranny

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:14.939
gets to be taken for granted
after awhile they ask why is

00:54:14.939 --> 00:54:19.391
this guy taking taxes from me?
Why is he such a big shot and

00:54:19.391 --> 00:54:21.499
I'm not?
That's just going to be

00:54:21.499 --> 00:54:25.029
inevitable, and so if you're
going to keep your power and

00:54:25.029 --> 00:54:28.552
keep people down,
you can't just rely on the

00:54:28.552 --> 00:54:33.338
citizen body and so tyrants
typically hire foreigners to

00:54:33.338 --> 00:54:38.740
serve as mercenaries for them.
Now, another thing is that

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:43.548
while these tyrannies last,
it is typical that they should

00:54:43.548 --> 00:54:48.356
accomplish very significant
things that most anybody would

00:54:48.356 --> 00:54:52.658
agree were positive
contributions to the life of the

00:54:52.658 --> 00:54:58.530
community they ruled.
You find economic prosperity.

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.833
This is one of the things that
is characteristic of these

00:55:01.833 --> 00:55:05.924
regimes--diversified economies,
because they support trade and

00:55:05.924 --> 00:55:09.784
industry, and sometimes even
agriculture, the spread of

00:55:09.784 --> 00:55:13.408
wealth to new groups,
because there's much more money

00:55:13.408 --> 00:55:17.101
around, there are people who
don't fit into the old system in

00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:20.609
which the land was simply
dominated by the aristocrats and

00:55:20.609 --> 00:55:23.810
where there was no other way to
make any money,

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:29.656
or gain any wealth.
So, all of that is happening,

00:55:29.656 --> 00:55:34.750
and of course,
many of the tyrants foster and

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:40.265
engage in colonization,
which has all the benefits I

00:55:40.265 --> 00:55:44.982
mentioned last time as well.
Now, there's another thing

00:55:44.982 --> 00:55:47.599
that is characteristic of
tyrannies.

00:55:47.599 --> 00:55:51.624
When they make themselves
tyrant, they come to live,

00:55:51.624 --> 00:55:56.280
whether they did before or not,
in what is the major city of

00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.329
that whole polis;
the capital so to speak.

00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:03.550
It's always been a place that
would have a special place;

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:08.212
it's where the acropolis is and
therefore where the worship of

00:56:08.212 --> 00:56:11.188
the gods takes place.
There's worship of the gods

00:56:11.188 --> 00:56:13.400
everywhere, but that's a special
place for them.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.195
There was always a special
place, but now that becomes the

00:56:16.195 --> 00:56:19.087
center of the community,
and as a result where the

00:56:19.087 --> 00:56:21.869
tyrant is, that's where all the
action is.

00:56:21.869 --> 00:56:26.969
People begin to move into that
capital city if they leave the

00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:31.474
land of their fathers,
and some number of them in fact

00:56:31.474 --> 00:56:33.595
do.
If you're going to conduct

00:56:33.595 --> 00:56:36.410
commercial activity,
if you're conducting factory

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.517
work,
and you're going to be somehow

00:56:38.517 --> 00:56:41.792
involved in the various aspects
of government and things that

00:56:41.792 --> 00:56:44.824
have to do with the tyrant,
you want to be there,

00:56:44.824 --> 00:56:48.742
and the tyrants have courts,
and so people come to be in the

00:56:48.742 --> 00:56:53.485
court of the tyrant.
So, what you have is a kind of

00:56:53.485 --> 00:56:59.059
urbanization that is
characteristic of this period.

00:56:59.059 --> 00:57:02.828
Well, if you're going to have
more people living in this town

00:57:02.828 --> 00:57:06.094
than ever did before,
there's all sorts of things you

00:57:06.094 --> 00:57:09.335
need.
Number one, no question number

00:57:09.335 --> 00:57:13.175
one, water supply;
how you supply people with

00:57:13.175 --> 00:57:18.539
enough water to meet their needs
when they weren't there before,

00:57:18.539 --> 00:57:23.351
and the answer is you have to
bring water into the city by a

00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:28.139
variety of ways,
any way that you really can.

00:57:28.139 --> 00:57:33.561
They do aqueducts of a certain
kind, they dig wells and have

00:57:33.561 --> 00:57:36.869
fountains coming from those
wells;

00:57:36.869 --> 00:57:40.039
they build fountain houses to
cover those fountains.

00:57:40.039 --> 00:57:42.599
In short, they bring a water
supply.

00:57:42.599 --> 00:57:45.539
Also, if you're going to
have these common places where a

00:57:45.539 --> 00:57:47.989
lot of people live who didn't
live there before,

00:57:47.989 --> 00:57:52.518
drainage is essential or else
you'll have terrible disease

00:57:52.518 --> 00:57:54.832
breaking out.
It's not that they were

00:57:54.832 --> 00:57:57.907
scientists and knew about germs,
it's just that if you know when

00:57:57.907 --> 00:58:00.884
there's a lot of people there
and there's a lot of water lying

00:58:00.884 --> 00:58:02.780
around,
people seem to die,

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.610
so you don't have to be genius
for that.

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:10.527
There are sewer systems
introduced by these tyrants

00:58:10.527 --> 00:58:15.040
which never existed before.
Since they are trying to

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.016
encourage trade,
there was always a place--I

00:58:18.016 --> 00:58:22.017
shouldn't say there was always,
but at some point in the

00:58:22.017 --> 00:58:26.341
development of the polis,
there emerged a kind of central

00:58:26.341 --> 00:58:30.323
place in the city called the
agora which was a place

00:58:30.323 --> 00:58:34.030
that people came together for
different purposes.

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:36.173
It looks like,
in the beginning,

00:58:36.173 --> 00:58:39.216
political meetings,
meetings of the assembly,

00:58:39.216 --> 00:58:41.706
for instance,
might take place in the

00:58:41.706 --> 00:58:45.065
agora.
It pretty early seemed to have

00:58:45.065 --> 00:58:48.679
had some religious significance,
and then over time,

00:58:48.679 --> 00:58:52.375
not at the beginning though but
over time, they became

00:58:52.375 --> 00:58:55.114
commercial centers.
If you use the word

00:58:55.114 --> 00:58:58.869
agora in Greece today,
you're talking about a shop

00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:02.489
because that's how much that
comes to be the thing.

00:59:02.489 --> 00:59:07.302
But we need to keep in mind
that it is a religious center,

00:59:07.302 --> 00:59:11.777
it becomes a civic center,
and it also of course was a

00:59:11.777 --> 00:59:17.208
commercial center as well.
So the agoras come from

00:59:17.208 --> 00:59:21.851
these tyrannical periods.
Public buildings are

00:59:21.851 --> 00:59:26.026
created by the tyrant for
whatever use he needs,

00:59:26.026 --> 00:59:29.579
but he might be building
courthouses,

00:59:29.579 --> 00:59:32.538
he might be building places for
magistrates to stay,

00:59:32.538 --> 00:59:33.640
things like that.

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:41.414
But also, he has a tendency to
try to make them very

00:59:41.414 --> 00:59:45.879
attractive, very impressive,
so that people will be

00:59:45.879 --> 00:59:49.630
impressed with him for having
done so.

00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:54.783
You know the phenomenon;
people like to have their name

00:59:54.783 --> 00:59:57.627
on a building.
I'm told they will actually

00:59:57.627 --> 01:00:01.078
give you millions and millions
of dollars to put their name on

01:00:01.078 --> 01:00:04.505
a building.
I'm told there are places where

01:00:04.505 --> 01:00:09.434
they will even give you lots of
money to put their names on

01:00:09.434 --> 01:00:13.074
bathroom stalls,
but only the tyrants in their

01:00:13.074 --> 01:00:17.263
day would have been rich enough
to do the kind of thing we're

01:00:17.263 --> 01:00:21.017
talking about,
including, and this is a very

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:23.849
large thing I believe,
temples.

01:00:23.849 --> 01:00:27.766
The Greeks had been building
temples I'm sure for a long

01:00:27.766 --> 01:00:30.329
time, but essentially out of
wood.

01:00:30.329 --> 01:00:33.224
But now with people having the
kind of wealth that were being

01:00:33.224 --> 01:00:37.187
accumulated by these tyrants,
they begin to build them of

01:00:37.187 --> 01:00:42.670
stone and where possible of very
fine stone such as marble,

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:46.838
and I think we have to imagine
the construction of such a

01:00:46.838 --> 01:00:51.304
building in an old town like any
one of the Greek city states

01:00:51.304 --> 01:00:54.650
had,
it would have had at tremendous

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:56.705
impact.
This is something I'd like to

01:00:56.705 --> 01:00:58.515
pass on to you,
when you think about the

01:00:58.515 --> 01:01:00.632
Greeks.
Here's one of the places where

01:01:00.632 --> 01:01:04.046
they're so stunningly different
from us that we need to make an

01:01:04.046 --> 01:01:06.800
imaginative leap to understand
what's going on.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:13.800
Remember this is a world
that has next to no writing.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.727
There are a few people who know
how to write,

01:01:16.727 --> 01:01:21.579
but it's not part of life.
Of course, there's no paper.

01:01:21.579 --> 01:01:26.745
So, just get writing out of
your life for the most part,

01:01:26.745 --> 01:01:31.084
but there's no movies,
there's no television,

01:01:31.084 --> 01:01:34.778
there's no radio,
there's no newspapers,

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:41.006
there are very few buildings.
Now suddenly up pops--let's go

01:01:41.006 --> 01:01:47.400
to Corinth and suddenly up pops
this incredible thing made of

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.092
stone,
a temple to the gods,

01:01:51.092 --> 01:01:58.250
decorated beautifully,
painted typically blue and red,

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:04.701
and gold with a big statue of
the goddess and anybody in town

01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:09.406
can go by and look at that.
That would have made a

01:02:09.406 --> 01:02:13.443
sensational experience and
people would have been talking

01:02:13.443 --> 01:02:17.769
about it in various elements of
detail forever and a day,

01:02:17.769 --> 01:02:21.986
and they would not forget,
who it was that constructed

01:02:21.986 --> 01:02:25.099
that temple.
So, that's an example of what

01:02:25.099 --> 01:02:27.777
I'm talking about.
Beyond that,

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:33.704
the tyrants were patrons of the
arts, by which I mean

01:02:33.704 --> 01:02:36.667
architects,
sculptors, painters,

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:39.607
painters of this,
that, and the other thing,

01:02:39.607 --> 01:02:43.739
but vase painters as well,
potters of a very special kind.

01:02:43.739 --> 01:02:49.179
But that's not all--poets,
singers, liar players,

01:02:49.179 --> 01:02:53.599
all of those kinds of
entertainments,

01:02:53.599 --> 01:02:58.472
which had been monopolized by
the aristocracy to the degree

01:02:58.472 --> 01:03:02.825
they existed at all,
would now be more broadly

01:03:02.825 --> 01:03:08.738
available and the tyrants took
pride in bringing the world's

01:03:08.738 --> 01:03:14.151
best to their cities and
allowing at least some of them

01:03:14.151 --> 01:03:18.059
to hear and see what was going
on.

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:22.331
When we get to Athens I'll be
more specific when we have more

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:27.675
specific information about it.
So that is all part of a story

01:03:27.675 --> 01:03:32.784
that would have made the
tyrannies much more widely

01:03:32.784 --> 01:03:39.119
supported and not so easy to
knock over as you might think.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:42.815
People would have had many,
many reasons for gratitude to

01:03:42.815 --> 01:03:46.972
the tyrants and would have been
very pleased by much of what the

01:03:46.972 --> 01:03:49.983
tyrants were doing.
Of course, the old aristocrats

01:03:49.983 --> 01:03:52.920
would have been typically very
unhappy about everything they

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.159
were doing, because they had
been cut out.

01:03:55.159 --> 01:03:58.544
But if you go to everybody
else, their feelings I think

01:03:58.544 --> 01:04:02.243
would have been mixed because
first--I don't know which came

01:04:02.243 --> 01:04:04.755
first,
but they would be impressed and

01:04:04.755 --> 01:04:08.698
enjoy these positive things.
But they would also be troubled

01:04:08.698 --> 01:04:12.844
by something that was counter to
their own traditions and to

01:04:12.844 --> 01:04:16.639
central elements of their own
beliefs and concerns.

01:04:16.639 --> 01:04:21.477
I keep thinking about those
hoplite farmers,

01:04:21.477 --> 01:04:26.989
who have grown to be confident
and independent,

01:04:26.989 --> 01:04:30.958
desired to be autonomous,
didn't want to be told what to

01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:35.000
do and yet there was somebody
who was doing just that.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.920
So, this is the conflict that
there is.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.535
In fact, what we see is a
steady decline in the popularity

01:04:42.535 --> 01:04:46.179
of tyrannies from generation to
generation.

01:04:46.179 --> 01:04:49.420
The founder of the tyranny,
he's probably still popular

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.380
when he dies.
He did it;

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.772
most people are very conscious
of what he achieved,

01:04:53.772 --> 01:04:57.213
and he's a glorious figure.
But his son is only tyrant

01:04:57.213 --> 01:05:00.831
because he was his son;
it doesn't come from his

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:04.990
personal qualities and when the
people become more and more

01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:08.787
aware of the shortcomings,
fewer and fewer people are

01:05:08.787 --> 01:05:12.288
interested in the achievements
even though they may do

01:05:12.288 --> 01:05:15.095
wonderful things.
By the time you get to the

01:05:15.095 --> 01:05:19.185
third generation that's the end.
The third generation of tyrant

01:05:19.185 --> 01:05:22.420
gets thrown out if you've made
it that far.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:28.362
When the tyranny is
overthrown, the typical

01:05:28.362 --> 01:05:35.210
successor to the tyrannical
regime is an oligarchy.

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:40.523
I would say it would include
many of the old aristocrats who

01:05:40.523 --> 01:05:45.476
had the best land and the
greatest wealth and indeed the

01:05:45.476 --> 01:05:50.429
chances are those people would
be the leaders of the new

01:05:50.429 --> 01:05:53.817
regime.
But they would very quickly,

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:58.570
because it was not a monarchy
of any kind, would very quickly

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:03.559
form into factions that would be
competing with one another,

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:07.679
based on all kinds of different
things, which would compete with

01:06:07.679 --> 01:06:10.360
one another the leader of each
faction,

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.675
for becoming the leading
faction, the dominant figures in

01:06:14.675 --> 01:06:17.897
the state.
But also, and this is much more

01:06:17.897 --> 01:06:21.900
important, the really
fundamental thing is typically,

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.328
almost always,
the hoplite class of

01:06:25.328 --> 01:06:31.380
independent farmer would have
participated in this regime.

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:35.429
He would have been a full
fledged citizen.

01:06:35.429 --> 01:06:39.095
Fighting would be done chiefly
by the phalanx,

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:42.190
with these folks doing the
fighting.

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:46.125
These men would be the economic
backbone of the community,

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:48.679
turning out the grain and the
wine,

01:06:48.679 --> 01:06:52.939
and the olive oil and whatever
else, vegetables that they had

01:06:52.939 --> 01:06:56.701
to produce and being the
independent fellows that they

01:06:56.701 --> 01:06:58.292
were.
Finally,

01:06:58.292 --> 01:07:02.815
they would have played a part
in the political life of the

01:07:02.815 --> 01:07:04.907
city.
Here, it would vary from town

01:07:04.907 --> 01:07:07.383
to town.
You might have a relatively

01:07:07.383 --> 01:07:11.656
narrow oligarchy in which the
council was what counted and

01:07:11.656 --> 01:07:15.654
that would be typical,
the council would count but it

01:07:15.654 --> 01:07:19.761
might be very narrowly defined,
or it could be very broadly

01:07:19.761 --> 01:07:22.773
defined,
where it might include all the

01:07:22.773 --> 01:07:25.380
hoplites, or something in
between.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:29.938
But not ever until we get to
Athens would you get a

01:07:29.938 --> 01:07:35.318
democracy, the definition being
that every adult male who is

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:39.968
born of native parents is a
citizen and who has some

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:44.739
significant political rights.
That doesn't come yet.

01:07:44.739 --> 01:07:48.226
You have an oligarchy meaning
short of that,

01:07:48.226 --> 01:07:51.550
but with the variations I've
indicated.

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:55.121
Corinth, for instance,
after they get rid of the

01:07:55.121 --> 01:07:58.313
tyrant finally,
becomes famous in the Greek

01:07:58.313 --> 01:08:02.796
tradition for the moderation and
therefore the longevity and

01:08:02.796 --> 01:08:06.139
peacefulness of its oligarchic
regime.

01:08:06.139 --> 01:08:10.430
I think we should imagine that
the Corinthians became a hoplite

01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:14.651
city--Not that they didn't have
aristocrats who had wealth and

01:08:14.651 --> 01:08:17.238
importance,
but that the hoplites really

01:08:17.238 --> 01:08:19.340
played a central part in the
picture.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:26.198
Just to raise the question,
I remember I raised it about

01:08:26.198 --> 01:08:28.180
colonization;
let me raise it about tyranny.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:33.302
What were the contributions
made by this development in

01:08:33.302 --> 01:08:38.710
Greek history to the life of
Greece and they were many.

01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:43.755
Obviously, economical growth in
the way I've pointed out,

01:08:43.755 --> 01:08:47.180
social change up to a certain
point,

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:52.163
but certainly doing away
forever with the aristocracy of

01:08:52.163 --> 01:08:57.691
birth as the normal basis for
citizenship and participation in

01:08:57.691 --> 01:09:01.500
the state.
I would go further.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:06.483
I would say that by destroying
that and substituting for some

01:09:06.483 --> 01:09:10.720
kind of an economic basis for
what role you play,

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.606
they actually opened the door
for a form of government that

01:09:14.606 --> 01:09:18.687
didn't come in many places,
but did come in some,

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:22.859
and I'm talking about a Greek
democracy.

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:28.001
Let me revert finally to
the question of how did Greeks

01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:31.989
think about tyranny after
tyranny was gone?

01:09:31.989 --> 01:09:37.720
It played a terrific role in
Greek thinking and had a lot to

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:43.257
do with the way the Greeks felt
about their relations with

01:09:43.257 --> 01:09:47.239
foreign powers and their own
regimes.

01:09:47.239 --> 01:09:50.070
One thing I'll just say in
passing, and come back to it

01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:53.231
next time.
Sparta, because of its behavior

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:57.640
in the sixth century and a
little bit into the fifth,

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.875
developed a reputation as being
the state that was the enemy of

01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:06.422
tyranny.
They never developed a tyranny,

01:10:06.422 --> 01:10:10.520
and indeed, they often fought
against tyrants.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.213
When tyranny was gone,
that was seen to be a great

01:10:14.213 --> 01:10:18.207
credit to them and helped
explain how it happened that

01:10:18.207 --> 01:10:22.428
Sparta emerged and rose to the
level as the leader of the

01:10:22.428 --> 01:10:27.779
Greeks which they certainly were
at the time of the Persian Wars.

01:10:27.779 --> 01:10:33.157
Beyond that though,
the picture that comes down to

01:10:33.157 --> 01:10:38.861
us will be a double picture,
in which opposite elements

01:10:38.861 --> 01:10:43.500
exist but certainly the dominant
one is negative.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:47.497
Tyrannies are arbitrary,
they are violent,

01:10:47.497 --> 01:10:52.859
tyrants are arrogant,
they do not permit free speech,

01:10:52.859 --> 01:10:56.964
which by the way the Greek
democrats placed in a very

01:10:56.964 --> 01:11:01.778
central place in the important
things that are necessary for a

01:11:01.778 --> 01:11:04.053
man,
a Greek, a citizen,

01:11:04.053 --> 01:11:08.466
a person who is not a
barbarian, the ability to come

01:11:08.466 --> 01:11:13.224
forward into the center of
political life and speak your

01:11:13.224 --> 01:11:16.291
mind.
When you didn't have that to

01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:20.459
some considerable degree,
you were a slave and tyrants

01:11:20.459 --> 01:11:24.563
didn't permit that.
There was no true political

01:11:24.563 --> 01:11:28.344
life for citizens,
they were de facto

01:11:28.344 --> 01:11:33.619
subjects of this tyrant who
himself was an irresponsible,

01:11:33.619 --> 01:11:38.475
not responsible to another
body, and therefore,

01:11:38.475 --> 01:11:45.020
potentially dangerous and very
easily could become a despot,

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:50.605
which is a Greek word.
Herodotus uses tyranny

01:11:50.605 --> 01:11:54.460
critically--well,
you know, by and large,

01:11:54.460 --> 01:12:00.361
he depicts the King of Persia,
who finally invades Greece

01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:06.118
first in 490 and then another
king in 480, these men are

01:12:06.118 --> 01:12:09.426
tyrants,
because they fit precisely the

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:12.949
categorization of tyranny as the
Greeks know it.

01:12:12.949 --> 01:12:16.839
In Aeschylus' play,
Prometheus Bound,

01:12:16.839 --> 01:12:22.085
Zeus himself is seen to be a
tyrant and the word is used of

01:12:22.085 --> 01:12:26.970
him by characters in the play
for the same reason.

01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:30.999
He is punishing Prometheus for
his good deeds towards men,

01:12:30.999 --> 01:12:35.100
which make men more divine than
they would otherwise be.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.319
Zeus is very angry.
That's because he gave him fire;

01:12:38.319 --> 01:12:41.577
Zeus is very,
very angry with him and he

01:12:41.577 --> 01:12:44.918
locks him up,
chains him to a rock in the

01:12:44.918 --> 01:12:49.678
Caucus Mountains while birds are
pecking away at his liver

01:12:49.678 --> 01:12:53.711
forever and ever,
a typical Greek hell of the

01:12:53.711 --> 01:12:56.426
worst kind.
And we are led in,

01:12:56.426 --> 01:13:01.655
what we have of that play,
to think that Zeus is doing

01:13:01.655 --> 01:13:05.806
terrible things.
He is behaving tyrannically,

01:13:05.806 --> 01:13:09.789
that is, not good even for the
king of the gods.

01:13:09.789 --> 01:13:12.804
Plato, of course,
will regard tyranny later on as

01:13:12.804 --> 01:13:16.258
a terribly evil thing and
because of his anti-democratic

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:19.001
prejudices,
will say tyranny is the natural

01:13:19.001 --> 01:13:22.430
outcome of democracy because
people can't rule themselves.

01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:25.748
They're not competent to do so,
and it's only a matter of time

01:13:25.748 --> 01:13:28.197
before some strong,
violent, selfish man makes

01:13:28.197 --> 01:13:29.340
himself a tyrant.

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:36.039
It is a distinguishing
feature in Greek thought.

01:13:36.039 --> 01:13:40.890
Tyranny or monarchy,
these are not appropriate for

01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:43.739
free men.
That is to say Greeks;

01:13:43.739 --> 01:13:48.857
Greeks, they felt were by
nature free and they couldn't be

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:52.090
free so long as there was
tyranny.

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:56.925
But tyranny was in fact a
natural way of life for

01:13:56.925 --> 01:14:01.560
barbarians, who were not by
nature free men.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.046
So it's helpful.
And this is a form of

01:14:05.046 --> 01:14:09.245
ethnocentric stuff,
but the Greeks spelled it out

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:11.997
very carefully,
thought about it very

01:14:11.997 --> 01:14:15.250
carefully, and if you had said,
well why do you say that?

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:18.173
Well, they would;
deep down they might hold what

01:14:18.173 --> 01:14:21.791
we would call a sort of racial
prejudice, but I think they

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.329
would have made a better case
for it.

01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:27.631
They would have said,
to be a free man as Aristotle

01:14:27.631 --> 01:14:30.470
said, you need to live in a
polis,

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:33.469
because that's the only place
where it's possible to live as a

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.824
free man.
So, because Greeks chose to

01:14:35.824 --> 01:14:38.310
live in polis,
they are free.

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:42.749
People who choose to live as
the slaves of monarchs and

01:14:42.749 --> 01:14:46.859
tyrants, that's because they are
natural slaves.

01:14:46.859 --> 01:14:50.749
And that prejudice is very
deep, and so when the Greeks end

01:14:50.749 --> 01:14:55.250
up having to fight the Persians,
there's a lot more going on

01:14:55.250 --> 01:15:00.350
than just we're being invaded
and we have to defend our land.

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:03.376
Next time I'll look at the
great exception to all of the

01:15:03.376 --> 01:15:06.844
things we've been talking about:
Sparta, the state like no other

01:15:06.844 --> 01:15:07.844
Greek state.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.808
Prof: Now that we've
discussed smallpox and its

00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:08.938
impact on the human body--
its symptomatology--this

00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:14.280
morning I want to concentrate
instead on the impact on

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.113
history,
and I want to concentrate on

00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:20.830
three aspects in particular.
 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.350
The first part would be to look
at its impact in Europe.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.660
The second, and much more
dramatic story,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.050
is the impact that you're
reading about in Elizabeth Fenn,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.710
which is what happened with
smallpox in the New World,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.810
and also in Australia and New
Zealand.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.466
The third task for the morning
is to come to the very different

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:56.123
story, which is smallpox and the
development of a public health

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.450
strategy;
in this case,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.310
the development of the strategy
of vaccine.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.238
So, those are the three topics
I'd like to deal with this

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:06.938
morning.
 

00:01:06.938 --> 00:01:13.719
And, so, let's begin with the
impact of smallpox in Europe.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.180
Smallpox has a legend about it.
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.580
The legend, it goes like this.
 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.197
That it was brought back to
Europe from the Middle East by

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:31.060
returning Crusaders in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.940
As you know,
the Crusades lasted from 1095

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.637
to 1291,
and those are said to be,

00:01:39.637 --> 00:01:44.030
this time of armies in movement
and transit,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.950
to be the means of transmitting
smallpox back to Western Europe.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.322
There's no reason for us to
accept the truth of that legend

00:01:57.322 --> 00:01:58.620
as accurate.
 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.650
But there is something
interesting about it.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.287
First, that there's some
support, which is that Saint

00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:11.342
Nicaise,
who was a Crusader of the Order

00:02:11.342 --> 00:02:15.718
of Saint John,
he had an unhappy experience in

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.310
the Middle East.
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.520
He was captured and beheaded.
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.369
But thereafter he became the
patron saint of smallpox

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:28.949
sufferers.
 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:34.280
A cult of Saint Nicaise--he's
from Reims,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.639
in particular--spread across
the continent,

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.853
and churches were devoted to
him, and there were

00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:44.750
representations of this saint in
stained glass widows,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.680
in effigies,
and statues like this.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.089
This is Saint Nicaise at Reims
Cathedral, Saint Nicaise and an

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.930
angel.
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.549
There isn't any hard evidence
that smallpox did return with

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.716
the Crusaders;
although, we all know that

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:11.050
warfare is a time that favors
the spread of infectious

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.770
diseases,
and it's probably true that

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.038
smallpox had already been
present in Europe for centuries.

00:03:20.038 --> 00:03:22.669
But there's something about
this date,

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.920
which is that what it tells us
is not when smallpox actually

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.140
began,
but when it first began to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.020
attract attention.
 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.970
In any case,
we know too that smallpox,

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.479
although it was present in
Europe during the Crusades,

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:47.952
the conditions at that time led
to its beginning to have a more

00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:52.824
important impact,
that reached its highpoint in

00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:58.013
the late-seventeenth and then
throughout the eighteenth

00:03:58.013 --> 00:03:59.068
century.
 

00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:04.167
And that had to do with
preconditions that enabled it to

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:08.024
flourish,
preconditions associated with

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:11.918
industrial development,
the commercialization of

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.751
agriculture,
and rapid, unplanned

00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:17.810
urbanization.
 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:25.223
In the eighteenth century,
smallpox had clearly replaced

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:33.310
plague as the greatest and most
feared killer of its time.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.990
Now, in its history,
the fact that a sufferer--

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.221
and we mentioned this last
time--who recovered possessed a

00:04:43.221 --> 00:04:46.670
robust,
lifelong immunity to this

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.000
disease was important.
 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.769
No one was naturally infected
twice with smallpox.

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:58.709
So, a typical pattern emerged
in the cities of Europe,

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:03.502
and that was that smallpox
became an ever-present disease

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:08.209
that most people who survived
childhood had suffered.

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:13.742
The adult population therefore
possessed what we might call an

00:05:13.742 --> 00:05:18.370
extensive herd immunity to
smallpox as a disease.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.740
So, it became an endemic
disease of childhood.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.708
But at intervals,
perhaps every generation or so,

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:34.607
smallpox would erupt as a major
epidemic among the general

00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:36.160
population.
 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.940
A couple of factors came into
play, to reinforce this pattern.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.319
Obviously not every child
contracted the disease,

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:52.199
and so over time there'd be a
slow accumulation of non-immune,

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:59.220
susceptible adults who could
fall ill of the disease.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.103
It was also true that European
cities in the early modern era

00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:08.497
were so unhealthy that they
sustained or expanded their

00:06:08.497 --> 00:06:11.920
population,
not by growth from within,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.920
but by a constant influx of
people from without.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.189
Peasants driven off the land,
perhaps by hunger or warfare,

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:26.730
or the search for work,
failed harvests.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.113
And these newcomers,
in large numbers,

00:06:30.113 --> 00:06:35.141
to use contemporary medical
jargon, were immunologically

00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:38.771
naï¿½ve;
that is, they were susceptible

00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:43.500
and added to the pool of
susceptibles in urban centers.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.149
In every generation or so,
urban centers,

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:51.891
whose children had already
suffered smallpox as an endemic

00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:56.625
childhood disease,
suffered major epidemics among

00:06:56.625 --> 00:07:00.310
not only children but young
adults,

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.060
adolescents and older people.
 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.673
So, smallpox is an example of a
disease--and we'll see malaria

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:14.642
as another one--for which
there's no simple distinction

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:17.680
between endemic and epidemic.
 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.211
Smallpox was both endemic year
in and year out,

00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:27.430
in Europe, and it was also
epidemic sporadically every

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.500
generation or so.
 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.045
It thrived in crowded urban
environments,

00:07:33.045 --> 00:07:37.567
with throngs of people,
and poorly vented houses and

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:38.810
workshops.
 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.379
Now, in the eighteenth century,
statistics are elusive.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.668
But smallpox is commonly
thought--and this is just a

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:52.089
guesstimate--
to have caused perhaps a tenth

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:56.410
of all deaths in the century in
Europe,

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:03.310
and a third of all deaths among
children under ten-years-of-age.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.122
Half the population of the
continent is estimated to have

00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:11.990
been scarred or disfigured by
this disease.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:17.399
And smallpox was also the
leading cause of blindness.

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:21.839
Across Europe,
perhaps half-a-million--this is

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:28.449
again only a guesstimate--people
died annually from this disease.

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:31.769
In other words,
it was the equivalent of--

00:08:31.769 --> 00:08:34.139
the largest city in Europe at
the time,

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.340
in the eighteenth century,
was Naples,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.231
with half a million people--it
was if a city of that size

00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:45.600
disappeared from this single
disease every year.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.269
The nineteenth century English
poet and historian,

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:55.509
Thomas Babington Macaulay,
wrote this about smallpox.

00:08:55.509 --> 00:09:00.149
"The havoc of plague had
been far more rapid.

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:04.884
But the plague has visited our
shores only once or twice in

00:09:04.884 --> 00:09:06.190
living memory.
 

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:12.131
But smallpox was always there,
filling the churchyards with

00:09:12.131 --> 00:09:15.828
corpses,
tormenting with constant fear

00:09:15.828 --> 00:09:18.928
all whom it had not yet
stricken,

00:09:18.928 --> 00:09:22.129
and leaving on those,
whose lives it spared,

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:27.086
the hideous traces of its
power, turning the babe into a

00:09:27.086 --> 00:09:31.128
changeling,
at which the mother shuddered,

00:09:31.128 --> 00:09:36.775
and making the eyes and cheeks
of the betrothed maiden objects

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:39.740
of horror to her lover."
 

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.285
Two of the most famous
descriptions of smallpox in this

00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:48.327
century were those that
described it as "the

00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:52.706
speckled monster"
and "the most terrible of

00:09:52.706 --> 00:09:55.990
all the ministers of
death."

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.871
Furthermore,
like plague though,

00:09:58.871 --> 00:10:04.077
smallpox was an airborne
disease--unlike plague--but like

00:10:04.077 --> 00:10:05.379
influenza.
 

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:08.816
And it was an affliction that
was universal,

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:13.291
and had no predilection for any
subset of the population,

00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:14.970
such as the poor.
 

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.080
It wasn't really in that sense
a social disease.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.674
Even royal families were
scourged by smallpox in the

00:10:23.674 --> 00:10:27.190
seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:33.363
Famous sufferers and victims
included King Louis XIV and

00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:38.100
Louis XV of France;
William II of Orange;

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.192
Peter II of Russia;
the Holy Roman Emperor,

00:10:43.192 --> 00:10:44.558
Joseph I.
 

00:10:44.558 --> 00:10:49.870
In England, smallpox was even
directly responsible for a

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.610
dynastic change.
 

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.519
It extinguished the House of
Stuart.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:11:00.389
The last Stuart heirs to the
throne all died of smallpox,

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:04.710
between the death of Queen
Mary, in 1694,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.929
and the death of
eleven-year-old Prince William,

00:11:07.929 --> 00:11:11.798
also from smallpox, in 1700.
 

00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:16.086
So this was a clear case in
which a disease produced a

00:11:16.086 --> 00:11:20.168
constitutional crisis,
and led to the Act of

00:11:20.168 --> 00:11:24.184
Settlement of 1701,
that prevented another Catholic

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:28.157
from being crowned,
and brought in the House of

00:11:28.157 --> 00:11:29.038
Hanover.
 

00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:33.908
So, smallpox had a major impact
in Western Europe.

00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:38.820
But its impact is not a simple
repetition of the story of

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.610
plague.
 

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.928
Although it was dreaded,
smallpox did not give rise in

00:11:44.928 --> 00:11:50.145
Europe to mass hysteria,
scapegoating and a religious

00:11:50.145 --> 00:11:51.250
frenzy.
 

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:56.168
And there are reasons for that
we can surmise.

00:11:56.168 --> 00:12:00.841
Unlike plague,
smallpox was not a sudden

00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:06.590
outside invader that took
society by surprise.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:11.919
Nor did it maximize its fury by
targeting young adults and the

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:16.900
middle-aged, who were the
mainstays of families and of the

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.950
economy.
 

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.950
Smallpox was an endemic disease
that was ever-present,

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.350
and so it was considered almost
normal,

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.629
especially because it targeted
infants and children,

00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:33.102
as a rule;
although, as I've said,

00:12:33.102 --> 00:12:36.830
it did lead sporadically to
broader epidemics.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:42.120
So, as a result everyone had
some experience with smallpox,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.070
and half the people you might
meet on the street,

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.649
in a city of Western Europe,
would be pockmarked,

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:54.899
as a reminder of its passage.
 

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:59.863
So familiar was smallpox that
it bred a kind of fatalism,

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:04.649
the belief that it was
inevitable in people's lives.

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:08.351
And this attitude was so
pervasive that it wasn't

00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:12.283
uncommon even for parents to
expose healthy children

00:13:12.283 --> 00:13:16.778
intentionally to mild cases,
in the hope that they could

00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:20.528
protect them from something much
more catastrophic.

00:13:20.528 --> 00:13:24.570
We could look at this attitude
by--or appreciate it--

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.408
by thinking about European
literature,

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:31.519
particularly British
literature, let's say in the

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.879
eighteenth century.
 

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:35.370
Let's think,
for example,

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:40.038
of Henry Fielding's novel
Tom Jones.

00:13:40.038 --> 00:13:44.389
In that, when it was useful to
have a change in plot,

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:49.730
all the author had to do was to
introduce the idea of smallpox,

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.250
because no one would question
that that was appropriate,

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.850
or consider that this was a
clumsy or artificial artifice.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.860
Everyone expected smallpox.
 

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.524
And in Fielding's novel,
Joseph Andrews,

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:09.590
we find that there's a heroine
who is pockmarked.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:14.543
Or consider Thackeray's The
Adventures of Henry Esmond,

00:14:14.543 --> 00:14:19.740
set in the eighteenth century,
where smallpox drives the plot.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.066
Smallpox, quite simply,
was just there,

00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:26.216
and it came to seem,
for many people,

00:14:26.216 --> 00:14:31.120
a terrible but everyday part of
the human condition.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.668
So, smallpox didn't cause great
European cities,

00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:38.668
like London,
to empty of their population,

00:14:38.668 --> 00:14:41.850
when people took the road in
flight,

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.870
as plague did in the
seventeenth century and,

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.942
as we shall see,
that cholera was to do again in

00:14:48.942 --> 00:14:51.110
the nineteenth century.
 

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:56.484
And there wasn't an urge to
seek scapegoats for what seemed

00:14:56.484 --> 00:14:59.820
an almost natural or normal
event.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.176
But this is a generalization,
and there are reports of some

00:15:04.176 --> 00:15:08.532
who lost their nerve at the
approach of smallpox and sought

00:15:08.532 --> 00:15:10.110
refuge in flight.
 

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.250
Let's return to our novel,
Henry Esmond.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.518
There's a heroine,
Lady Castlewood,

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:23.190
who contracts smallpox as an
adult, in a country village.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.645
Her husband--and this was
surprising because we're told

00:15:27.645 --> 00:15:32.350
early on that he was an
extraordinarily brave soldier,

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:36.620
but he was a man who couldn't
bear to face a disease that he

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.298
couldn't fight and threatened
him,

00:15:39.298 --> 00:15:42.340
not only with death,
but this seemed to matter

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.110
perhaps more to him than death
itself--

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.577
he thought he was extremely
handsome and he was afraid that

00:15:49.577 --> 00:15:52.350
he would be maimed if he
survived.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.308
So, unwilling to put his fair
complexion,

00:15:56.308 --> 00:16:01.184
and his even fairer hair,
at risk, Lord Castlewood took

00:16:01.184 --> 00:16:04.967
to his heels,
and he deserted his household

00:16:04.967 --> 00:16:06.418
for the duration.
 

00:16:06.418 --> 00:16:09.710
But he wasn't part of a mass
exodus.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.928
Although Thackery does have
Henry Esmond,

00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:17.958
the hero of the story,
tell us himself that smallpox

00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.774
was,
in his words,

00:16:19.774 --> 00:16:24.278
"the most dreadful scourge
of the world."

00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:27.950
We also know that as a result
of her ordeal,

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.323
Lady Castlewood lost her
beauty, and that her gallant

00:16:32.323 --> 00:16:34.865
husband,
on his return,

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:39.019
no longer loved her as he once
did.

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:42.375
As readers then,
we know that one of the effects

00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:46.303
of smallpox was that it had a
big impact on the marriage

00:16:46.303 --> 00:16:47.090
market.
 

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:52.346
It disfigured people and made
them less likely to succeed in

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:54.129
those sweepstakes.
 

00:16:54.129 --> 00:16:58.518
We learn that Lady Castlewood,
according to the author:

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:03.149
"Her beauty was very much
injured by the smallpox.

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:06.230
When the marks of the disease
cleared away,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.338
the delicacy of her color and
complexion was all gone.

00:17:10.338 --> 00:17:13.608
Her eyes had lost their
brilliancy.

00:17:13.608 --> 00:17:16.930
Her hair fell and her face
looked old.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:22.248
It was as if a coarse hand had
rubbed off the delicate tints of

00:17:22.248 --> 00:17:26.021
that sweet picture,
and brought to it a dread

00:17:26.021 --> 00:17:26.880
color.
 

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.180
Also it must be owned,
her ladyship's nose was greatly

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.578
swollen and red."
 

00:17:34.578 --> 00:17:37.201
In any case,
as you can imagine,

00:17:37.201 --> 00:17:41.598
having scars and pockmarks was
also a source of great

00:17:41.598 --> 00:17:45.318
psychological distress and
unhappiness,

00:17:45.318 --> 00:17:50.267
and this too was part of the
plot of Thackeray's novel as it

00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:53.371
unfolds,
and part of what we should

00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:57.482
remember as the impact of
smallpox on the terrible

00:17:57.482 --> 00:17:59.328
eighteenth century.
 

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:04.951
But that was smallpox in
Europe: a major source of

00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:09.278
anxiety;
a major impact on population;

00:18:09.278 --> 00:18:13.859
a source of the Cult of Saint
Nicaise;

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:19.019
a major factor in demography.
 

00:18:19.019 --> 00:18:23.782
But there's a more dramatic
story that we need to come to,

00:18:23.782 --> 00:18:27.794
as we cross the waters and turn
to the New World,

00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:30.970
or also Australia and New
Zealand.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.950
This is the story of what
happened when the disease was

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.930
suddenly introduced to
populations in part of the world

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:46.614
where it was a new invader;
where it arrived from outside,

00:18:46.614 --> 00:18:51.886
had never been an endemic
infection and therefore against

00:18:51.886 --> 00:18:57.442
which the native or aboriginal
population had no immunity at

00:18:57.442 --> 00:18:58.288
all.
 

00:18:58.288 --> 00:19:01.765
Then it produced real
catastrophes,

00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:05.444
events described as
"virgin soil

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:07.490
epidemics."
 

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:12.181
These were catastrophes that
accompanied European expansion

00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:15.660
to the New World,
Australia, New Zealand.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.567
And there smallpox,
and another childhood disease

00:19:19.567 --> 00:19:24.125
that accompanied it,
measles, had a transformative

00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:29.496
importance in clearing the land
and promoting settlement by

00:19:29.496 --> 00:19:33.200
Europeans with their robust
immunity.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.803
The impact of smallpox and
measles was greater than that of

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:41.170
gunpowder.
 

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.719
In the New World,
you'll be reading about this in

00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:48.490
detail in that wonderful book by
Elizabeth Fenn,

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.269
Pox Americana,
and you might want to be

00:19:52.269 --> 00:19:57.980
reminded of the simple fact that
the author was actually a Yalie,

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.109
and that the book that you're
reading began life here,

00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:05.568
as a Ph.D. dissertation.
 

00:20:05.568 --> 00:20:08.165
In any case,
though, I want to have a

00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:12.348
division of labor between the
lectures and the reading,

00:20:12.348 --> 00:20:17.782
and so I won't repeat the story
that Fenn tells so movingly and

00:20:17.782 --> 00:20:18.660
so well.
 

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.251
But there are a few points that
I would like to highlight as

00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:27.298
specific examples,
and a couple of general points.

00:20:27.298 --> 00:20:31.409
And first the general idea we
should remember is that of

00:20:31.409 --> 00:20:35.369
something sometimes referred to
as "the Columbian

00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:36.788
exchange."
 

00:20:36.788 --> 00:20:41.838
That is to say that the
European encounter with the New

00:20:41.838 --> 00:20:46.702
World brought about the
large-scale exchange from one

00:20:46.702 --> 00:20:50.348
side of the Atlantic to the
other,

00:20:50.348 --> 00:20:56.118
and in the reverse direction,
of fauna and flora.

00:20:56.118 --> 00:21:00.768
Certainly, as you know,
Europeans brought back the

00:21:00.768 --> 00:21:04.373
potato, maize and quinine,
as examples,

00:21:04.373 --> 00:21:06.460
from the Americas.
 

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.982
And there's been a debate as to
whether this also involved a

00:21:10.982 --> 00:21:12.670
microbial component.
 

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.761
And there are those who
speculate that Columbus and his

00:21:16.761 --> 00:21:21.461
sailors brought back the disease
syphilis, as well from the New

00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:22.220
World.
 

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.980
We'll be returning to that
argument later in the semester,

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.240
when we come to talk about
syphilis as a disease.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.726
What's beyond doubt though is
that there was also a terrible

00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:39.298
movement of microbes in the
other direction,

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:45.359
as Europeans unintentionally
introduced smallpox and measles

00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:47.210
to the Americas.
 

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.328
Let's illustrate with a
specific example of the

00:21:51.328 --> 00:21:56.491
Columbian exchange--
the exchange Fenn tells us

00:21:56.491 --> 00:22:02.508
about--by looking at this
much-travailed island of

00:22:02.508 --> 00:22:07.173
Hispaniola,
the mountainous Caribbean

00:22:07.173 --> 00:22:12.028
island where Columbus landed in
the 1490s.

00:22:12.028 --> 00:22:16.272
Hispaniola--that is,
what is modern Haiti and the

00:22:16.272 --> 00:22:18.130
Dominican Republic.
 

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:23.403
And as we know from today's
news, Haiti has a long history

00:22:23.403 --> 00:22:26.643
of natural and manmade
catastrophes,

00:22:26.643 --> 00:22:31.269
and the arrival of Columbus was
certainly one.

00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:37.102
The aboriginal inhabitants,
a tribe known as the Arawaks,

00:22:37.102 --> 00:22:40.226
are estimated,
or guesstimated,

00:22:40.226 --> 00:22:46.578
to have numbered something like
a million people in 1492.

00:22:46.578 --> 00:22:52.916
Columbus described Hispaniola
as almost an earthly paradise,

00:22:52.916 --> 00:22:56.568
a place of great natural
beauty.

00:22:56.568 --> 00:23:00.836
And he reported that the
Arawaks were a welcoming and

00:23:00.836 --> 00:23:04.856
non-warlike people,
who greeted the Spanish warmly

00:23:04.856 --> 00:23:07.730
and showed them great kindness.
 

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:12.710
But unfortunately for them,
the kindness wasn't reciprocal.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.970
The Spaniards were interested
in profit, and international

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.538
power politics.
 

00:23:19.538 --> 00:23:23.430
And Hispaniola was
strategically located.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:27.748
It also possessed fertile soil,
a favorable climate,

00:23:27.748 --> 00:23:32.660
and land that the Spanish Crown
coveted for cultivation.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:38.018
So, European interest was based
on commerce, profit and

00:23:38.018 --> 00:23:41.690
international power
considerations.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:46.347
The Spaniards militarily
dispossessed the Arawaks of

00:23:46.347 --> 00:23:50.915
their land, and intended to
reduce them to slavery,

00:23:50.915 --> 00:23:54.568
first in mines and then on the
land.

00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:59.224
They were assisted in the
process, up to a point,

00:23:59.224 --> 00:24:03.588
by two great assets:
gunpowder and disease.

00:24:03.588 --> 00:24:09.278
And as you know from reading
Fenn, the aboriginal population

00:24:09.278 --> 00:24:14.679
of the Americas lacked immunity
to European diseases like

00:24:14.679 --> 00:24:17.088
smallpox and measles.
 

00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:21.327
There's no evidence that there
was a plot of genocide or

00:24:21.327 --> 00:24:26.105
bioterror in the intentional use
of disease as a means to clear

00:24:26.105 --> 00:24:28.338
the land and resettle it.
 

00:24:28.338 --> 00:24:33.640
What happened was spontaneous,
and not intentional.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.277
But the encounter between the
Europeans and the indigenous

00:24:38.277 --> 00:24:42.587
peoples of Hispaniola resulted
in an extraordinary and

00:24:42.587 --> 00:24:44.460
terrifying die-off.
 

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:49.777
Between 1492 and 1520,
the Native population was

00:24:49.777 --> 00:24:54.529
reduced from a million people to
15,000.

00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:59.680
Disease thoroughly cleared
Hispaniola for European

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.410
colonization,
virtually without resistance.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:08.935
On the other hand,
smallpox thwarted the Spanish

00:25:08.935 --> 00:25:14.038
intention in Hispaniola to
enslave the aboriginals.

00:25:14.038 --> 00:25:19.838
They simply died off at too
extraordinary a rate.

00:25:19.838 --> 00:25:23.625
It therefore led the Spaniards,
out of necessity,

00:25:23.625 --> 00:25:27.647
to turn to a different source
of labor for mines and

00:25:27.647 --> 00:25:28.910
plantations.
 

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.493
And since Africans and
Europeans shared disease

00:25:32.493 --> 00:25:36.078
reservoirs that were partially
overlapping,

00:25:36.078 --> 00:25:39.742
their people were resistant to
many of the same epidemic

00:25:39.742 --> 00:25:43.140
diseases that had destroyed the
Native Americans.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.932
So, disease was a major factor
in the establishment of the

00:25:47.932 --> 00:25:52.221
African slave trade and the
development of New World

00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:53.230
slavery.
 

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.298
The Spaniards hardly delayed.
 

00:25:56.298 --> 00:26:02.015
1517 marked the beginning of
the importation of African

00:26:02.015 --> 00:26:04.450
slaves to Hispaniola.
 

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.932
Santo Domingo,
by 1789, received into its

00:26:08.932 --> 00:26:15.880
ports every year some 1,600
ships, employing 24,000 sailors.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:21.266
And it accounted for 11 million
pounds of the French total of 17

00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:23.660
million pounds of exports.
 

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.430
Its trade was the foundation of
the wealth of port cities,

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.480
like Nantes,
Bordeaux and Marseilles,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.375
its cotton, a basis for the
French textile mills in

00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:38.170
Normandy,
and the growth was exponential.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.619
Between 1783 and 1789,
production doubled,

00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:49.460
and with it the importation of
slaves: 10,000 a year in 1764;

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:55.670
15,000 in 1771;
27,000 in 1786;

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.568
40,000 in 1787.
 

00:26:59.568 --> 00:27:02.440
The leading port of Santo
Domingo,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.038
the prosperous city of Le
Cap-Francois,

00:27:06.038 --> 00:27:10.407
had 20,000 people and was
called "the Paris of the

00:27:10.407 --> 00:27:11.460
West."
 

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.784
The Columbian exchange played a
major role in the history of

00:27:16.784 --> 00:27:21.836
Hispaniola, and that was writ
large in the New World as a

00:27:21.836 --> 00:27:22.740
whole.
 

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:30.452
A similar story could be told
about Hernan Cortez and his

00:27:30.452 --> 00:27:35.863
fellow conquistador,
Francisco Pizarro,

00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:43.463
with regard to the Aztec Empire
of Mexico and the Incan Empire

00:27:43.463 --> 00:27:47.298
of Peru,
which were destroyed not only

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:50.625
by gunpowder,
but also by smallpox,

00:27:50.625 --> 00:27:54.978
that destroyed agriculture,
led to famine,

00:27:54.978 --> 00:28:00.588
destroyed the aboriginal
military capacity to resist,

00:28:00.588 --> 00:28:04.105
and had, we're told,
a tremendous psychological

00:28:04.105 --> 00:28:07.045
impact,
because their gods seemed not

00:28:07.045 --> 00:28:08.318
to protect them.
 

00:28:08.318 --> 00:28:13.449
And, so, there was a wave of
conversion to the European god,

00:28:13.449 --> 00:28:16.838
who seemed to protect his own
people.

00:28:16.838 --> 00:28:21.358
Now, you also know,
from reading Elizabeth Fenn,

00:28:21.358 --> 00:28:27.818
that although this process was
primarily unintentional,

00:28:27.818 --> 00:28:32.980
there were moments within it,
within the larger catastrophe,

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.618
of occasional acts of
intentional genocide.

00:28:37.618 --> 00:28:43.407
And one was by Lord Jeffrey
Amherst--whom we're portraying

00:28:43.407 --> 00:28:48.788
here--who intentionally gave
Native Americans infected

00:28:48.788 --> 00:28:50.108
blankets.
 

00:28:50.108 --> 00:28:55.156
I thought I'd perhaps tell you
a little anecdote that I won't

00:28:55.156 --> 00:28:57.259
vouch for historically.
 

00:28:57.259 --> 00:29:02.320
I know of it from oral history,
from friends I had at the time

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.382
who attended Amherst College and
told me about a demonstration

00:29:07.382 --> 00:29:10.368
that I think took place in 1968.
 

00:29:10.368 --> 00:29:14.509
But that was that the
plates--you've just seen Lord

00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:18.259
Jeffrey,
who actually intentionally

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:23.608
aimed at the die-off of
aboriginal populations,

00:29:23.608 --> 00:29:30.146
and intentionally gave Native
Americans blankets infected with

00:29:30.146 --> 00:29:31.970
smallpox scabs.
 

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:37.252
Well, the plates at Amherst
College in the 1960s looked like

00:29:37.252 --> 00:29:40.124
this,
and they show Sir Jeffrey

00:29:40.124 --> 00:29:44.089
scourging the Indian population
with a whip,

00:29:44.089 --> 00:29:45.529
on horseback.
 

00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:50.211
And, so, in 1968,
learning about the experience

00:29:50.211 --> 00:29:53.784
of genocide,
there was a demonstration when

00:29:53.784 --> 00:29:57.804
the students of Amherst College
stood up and smashed all the

00:29:57.804 --> 00:29:59.779
plates in the dining hall.
 

00:29:59.779 --> 00:30:03.708
In any case,
it was also the case that this

00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:09.038
sort of tremendous die off that
affected the Americas,

00:30:09.038 --> 00:30:12.670
cleared the land for European
settlement,

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.380
was repeated,
again not intentionally,

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.390
but with regards in Australia
to the Aboriginals,

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:24.338
and in New Zealand with regards
the Maoris.

00:30:24.338 --> 00:30:29.030
But you have that story told
vividly, and on a large canvas,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.450
by Elizabeth Fenn's Pox
Americana.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.068
So, I'll leave you to read
about that.

00:30:35.068 --> 00:30:39.210
I'd like to turn now to our
third point of the morning,

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:43.182
which was the importance of
smallpox for an entirely

00:30:43.182 --> 00:30:47.078
different reason,
and that is the development of

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:50.200
a new and major public health
strategy;

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:55.792
the strategy of inoculation
initially, and that becomes more

00:30:55.792 --> 00:30:59.868
definitively the strategy of
vaccination.

00:30:59.868 --> 00:31:04.480
Well, let's begin with
inoculation.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.828
What is inoculation?
 

00:31:07.828 --> 00:31:13.246
It was an empirical
practice--we might call it a

00:31:13.246 --> 00:31:17.337
folk art--
and it was developed in various

00:31:17.337 --> 00:31:22.930
parts of the world as a result
of two very simple observations.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:29.990
The first was that smallpox was
clearly contagious.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:34.730
The second was that those who
had recovered from the disease--

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:39.345
and it was easy to know who had
suffered from it because they

00:31:39.345 --> 00:31:43.920
were scarred and pockmarked,
or also they were often

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.967
blind--and it was a simple
observation that they never

00:31:48.967 --> 00:31:52.108
caught smallpox a second time.
 

00:31:52.108 --> 00:31:57.584
So, the idea developed that it
might be a wise measure to

00:31:57.584 --> 00:32:02.180
induce a mild case of smallpox
artificially,

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.890
to protect a person,
or especially a child,

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:11.282
from the risk of acquiring a
naturally occurring but severe

00:32:11.282 --> 00:32:14.910
and life-threatening or maiming
case.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:19.531
And the practice that resulted
was called variously

00:32:19.531 --> 00:32:24.432
inoculation, variolation,
or, in a gardening metaphor,

00:32:24.432 --> 00:32:25.818
engrafting.
 

00:32:25.818 --> 00:32:29.557
There were variations,
but the major technique was

00:32:29.557 --> 00:32:33.220
that liquid material from a
smallpox pustule--

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:39.419
you saw those last time--of a
patient selected for having a

00:32:39.419 --> 00:32:44.868
very mild case was allowed to
soak into a thread.

00:32:44.868 --> 00:32:49.019
The thread was then inserted
into a superficial cut,

00:32:49.019 --> 00:32:53.383
made with the lancet--this
sharp instrument that you've

00:32:53.383 --> 00:32:57.692
seen pictures of,
in an earlier lecture--into the

00:32:57.692 --> 00:33:00.818
arm of the person to be
protected,

00:33:00.818 --> 00:33:05.588
and fastened there for
twenty-four hours.

00:33:05.588 --> 00:33:10.559
Twelve days later,
the subject usually fell ill

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:15.017
with smallpox;
hopefully suffered from a mild

00:33:15.017 --> 00:33:20.130
case for about a month;
convalesced for a further month;

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:24.358
and then remained immune for a
lifetime;

00:33:24.358 --> 00:33:29.578
hopefully not pockmarked or
blinded.

00:33:29.578 --> 00:33:34.895
This practice of inoculation
was common in places like Turkey

00:33:34.895 --> 00:33:39.769
in the eighteenth century,
but not in Western Europe.

00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:45.967
A major role in bringing this
practice to Britain and Western

00:33:45.967 --> 00:33:51.315
Europe was played by this lady,
the wife of the British

00:33:51.315 --> 00:33:56.090
Ambassador to Turkey,
Lady Mary Montague,

00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:00.578
who lived from 1689 to 1762.
 

00:34:00.578 --> 00:34:03.538
And she was preoccupied with
smallpox,

00:34:03.538 --> 00:34:08.655
in part because her own beauty
had been compromised by a severe

00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:13.152
attack of the disease,
and she elected to protect her

00:34:13.152 --> 00:34:16.480
own children by having them
inoculated,

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.849
by the practice I've just
described,

00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:21.889
while they were in
Constantinople.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:28.717
She returned to England in 1721
and launched a one-person,

00:34:28.717 --> 00:34:35.306
a one-lady, mission to convince
society to introduce the

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:38.659
practice of inoculation.
 

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:43.585
She devoted herself to
propagandizing British society

00:34:43.585 --> 00:34:45.289
in the practice.
 

00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:49.106
She was able to convince the
Princess of Wales,

00:34:49.106 --> 00:34:53.172
who had her daughters
inoculated, and the practice

00:34:53.172 --> 00:34:54.750
spread rapidly.
 

00:34:54.750 --> 00:35:00.891
This was the first major public
health advance in dealing with

00:35:00.891 --> 00:35:02.000
smallpox.
 

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.110
And, as I tried to suggest last
time,

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:09.215
I would argue that it had a
role--note that I'm saying only

00:35:09.215 --> 00:35:12.425
a role,
not the role--as part of

00:35:12.425 --> 00:35:15.789
the background for the coming of
the Enlightenment.

00:35:15.789 --> 00:35:19.536
Indeed, leading
philosophes became ardent

00:35:19.536 --> 00:35:23.295
advocates of inoculation;
people in France,

00:35:23.295 --> 00:35:27.360
like Voltaire and Charles de la
Condamine;

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.139
or on this side of the water,
people we might also describe

00:35:32.139 --> 00:35:35.518
as philosophes,
like Benjamin Franklin and

00:35:35.518 --> 00:35:37.250
Thomas Jefferson.
 

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:40.306
Inoculation,
appropriately,

00:35:40.306 --> 00:35:45.135
gained most favor in England;
the epicenter,

00:35:45.135 --> 00:35:47.849
perhaps, of smallpox in Europe.
 

00:35:47.849 --> 00:35:51.891
But it gradually spread also to
France, Holland,

00:35:51.891 --> 00:35:53.440
Germany, Sweden.
 

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.427
In Russia, the procedure was
introduced by Catherine the

00:35:57.427 --> 00:36:00.625
Great,
who imported an English

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:04.719
physician to inoculate her in
1768,

00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:10.590
after which the nobility
rapidly adopted the practice.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:14.730
The cresting wave then,
of the smallpox epidemic,

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:19.284
in the eighteenth century in
Europe was met by the first

00:36:19.284 --> 00:36:23.260
practical measure of public
health against it.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:28.795
Well, why did inoculation work,
at least to the extent that it

00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:29.340
did?
 

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.806
And I would say that
inoculation was a partial

00:36:33.806 --> 00:36:34.800
success.
 

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.836
Biological processes were at
work that are still poorly

00:36:38.836 --> 00:36:39.809
understood.
 

00:36:39.809 --> 00:36:43.543
But there are a couple of
relevant factors that we could

00:36:43.543 --> 00:36:44.018
note.
 

00:36:44.018 --> 00:36:49.396
One was that as a matter of
practice, this procedure took

00:36:49.396 --> 00:36:53.909
infective material only from
very mild cases.

00:36:53.909 --> 00:37:00.936
That was--the selection then of
cases was one reason behind its

00:37:00.936 --> 00:37:02.070
success.
 

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:07.355
The infective matter also was
made to enter the body through

00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:11.164
the skin,
in a way that doesn't happen in

00:37:11.164 --> 00:37:16.132
nature,
and, for reasons that aren't

00:37:16.132 --> 00:37:21.349
understood,
attenuates the virulence of the

00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:22.090
virus.
 

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:27.322
So, the portal of entry into
the body also seems to have made

00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:28.630
a difference.
 

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:32.250
And lastly, for all that one
knows,

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.018
those who were inoculated were
also selected,

00:37:36.018 --> 00:37:41.952
and you were only chosen for
inoculation if you were healthy

00:37:41.952 --> 00:37:43.260
and robust.
 

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.230
There were, however, problems.
 

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:52.239
Inoculation was also a
partially flawed procedure.

00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:56.159
All too often,
despite all precautions,

00:37:56.159 --> 00:38:01.007
it failed to produce the
desired mild infection,

00:38:01.007 --> 00:38:05.960
but led instead to severe
illness and death;

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.554
and invariably it caused a
month or two of immense

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.679
suffering.
 

00:38:11.679 --> 00:38:16.032
It was also costly,
since physicians insisted on a

00:38:16.032 --> 00:38:21.186
lengthy period of preparation
when they were performing the

00:38:21.186 --> 00:38:22.429
procedure.
 

00:38:22.429 --> 00:38:26.373
Wanting to ensure that those
they inoculated were in

00:38:26.373 --> 00:38:29.463
excellent health,
they selected patients

00:38:29.463 --> 00:38:33.326
carefully, and then isolated
them for a month before the

00:38:33.326 --> 00:38:36.003
procedure,
during which they regulated

00:38:36.003 --> 00:38:39.760
their diet,
their fresh air, their exercise;

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.610
and this was obviously an
expensive process.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:48.380
So, inoculation was simply not
accessible to the poor.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:55.739
Another factor was that
inoculation could run the risk,

00:38:55.739 --> 00:39:00.460
because it introduced actual
smallpox cases,

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.670
and therefore it ran the risk
of setting off an epidemic,

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:08.204
unintentionally,
that those who contracted the

00:39:08.204 --> 00:39:12.369
disease would then spread it to
others around them.

00:39:12.369 --> 00:39:15.795
And to prevent that,
smallpox inoculation

00:39:15.795 --> 00:39:18.804
hospitals--
such as one in London,

00:39:18.804 --> 00:39:22.635
that opened in 1746--
were set up to care for the

00:39:22.635 --> 00:39:26.675
patients who'd been inoculated,
and to quarantine them,

00:39:26.675 --> 00:39:30.030
so that they were no longer a
risk to others.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.847
But nevertheless,
there was a spirited debate

00:39:33.847 --> 00:39:39.141
over the whole issue of whether,
on balance, inoculation saved

00:39:39.141 --> 00:39:42.179
many more lives than it killed.
 

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:48.623
Well, that brings us to this
figure, a decisive figure in the

00:39:48.623 --> 00:39:54.637
history of medicine and public
health, and that is Edward

00:39:54.637 --> 00:39:55.820
Jenner.
 

00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:00.206
It was in the context of this
smallpox catastrophe of the

00:40:00.206 --> 00:40:03.900
eighteenth century,
and of disappointments and

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.630
anxieties surrounding
inoculation,

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:10.215
that we see a decisive
discovery in the history of

00:40:10.215 --> 00:40:15.222
medicine and public health,
associated with this English

00:40:15.222 --> 00:40:16.829
country doctor.
 

00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:21.161
To understand what happened,
we need to remember what we

00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:25.199
said last time;
and that is that there were

00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:29.699
three species of the genus of
orthopoxviruses:

00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:32.800
Variola major,
Variola minor,

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.800
and cowpox.
 

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.382
The first two are exclusively
infectious to human beings,

00:40:40.382 --> 00:40:44.170
but the third mainly affects
cattle.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:47.380
But the point is that,
under the right conditions,

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.000
cowpox can be transmitted to
humans,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.940
among whom it induces a mild
illness,

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:58.659
but it provides--and this was
the crucial point--

00:40:58.659 --> 00:41:05.518
a robust crossover immunity to
Variola major.

00:41:05.518 --> 00:41:09.905
Now, in Britain,
the people thought most likely

00:41:09.905 --> 00:41:13.340
to contract cowpox were
milkmaids.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:17.182
And Jenner--and this is why I
stressed that he was a country

00:41:17.182 --> 00:41:21.021
doctor;
this is his home in Barkley in

00:41:21.021 --> 00:41:24.659
Gloucester,
in the west of England--he made

00:41:24.659 --> 00:41:29.048
an observation that could only
have been made by a doctor with

00:41:29.048 --> 00:41:32.329
a rural practice,
in a dairy county,

00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:36.659
at a time of severe prevalence
of smallpox.

00:41:36.659 --> 00:41:41.356
And this observation was that
milkmaids never seemed to come

00:41:41.356 --> 00:41:43.030
down with smallpox.
 

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.532
Jenner, like others--he wasn't
the first to make this

00:41:46.532 --> 00:41:50.440
observation, but he took it to
heart and attempted the next

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.530
step of an experimentation.
 

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:58.059
A crucial experiment occurred
in 1796.

00:41:58.059 --> 00:42:03.695
The milkmaid Sarah Nelms
contracted cowpox,

00:42:03.695 --> 00:42:09.599
and this is the--we'll see the
experiment.

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:16.510
Edward Jenner took the
infective material from Sarah

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:23.152
Nelms and vaccinated the
eight-year-old son of his

00:42:23.152 --> 00:42:28.201
gardener,
on his property,

00:42:28.201 --> 00:42:35.773
in 1796, and then,
after a period of time,

00:42:35.773 --> 00:42:44.780
had a challenge in vaccination
with live smallpox virus.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:49.974
And happily the experiment was
a great success,

00:42:49.974 --> 00:42:55.507
and Edward Phipps demonstrated
that he was immune,

00:42:55.507 --> 00:42:59.460
by this procedure,
to smallpox.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:04.690
And, so, soon thereafter,
Edward Jenner--

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.570
whatever one thinks,
by modern terms,

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:12.099
of the medical ethics of that
particular experiment--

00:43:12.099 --> 00:43:18.260
in 1798 Edward Jenner wrote one
of the most influential works in

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:23.996
the history of medicine,
inquiring into the causes and

00:43:23.996 --> 00:43:28.268
effects of the Variola
vaccinae.

00:43:28.268 --> 00:43:32.268
His genius was not just to
devise the experiment;

00:43:32.268 --> 00:43:37.128
that was scientifically flawed,
perhaps, in the sense that he

00:43:37.128 --> 00:43:40.530
extrapolated from a very small
database.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:44.090
But in any case,
the point is that he recognized

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.349
the significance of what he'd
discovered.

00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:51.514
He thought that he saw
immediately the possibility of

00:43:51.514 --> 00:43:54.719
eradicating smallpox from the
planet,

00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:58.628
an idea whose importance the
British Parliament recognized

00:43:58.628 --> 00:44:01.920
soon afterwards when it declared
vaccination,

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.409
"the greatest
discovery"--

00:44:03.409 --> 00:44:07.159
I'm quoting--"in the
history of medicine."

00:44:07.159 --> 00:44:10.594
Jenner wrote,
in 1801, that he longed for,

00:44:10.594 --> 00:44:15.286
"the annihilation of the
smallpox, the most dreadful

00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:17.800
scourge of the human race.
 

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.460
That must be the final result
of this practice."

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.393
So, Jenner had the genius to
see the full implication of his

00:44:26.393 --> 00:44:28.847
discovery,
and then he devoted the

00:44:28.847 --> 00:44:32.438
remainder of his life
single-mindedly to the cause of

00:44:32.438 --> 00:44:35.199
promoting this revolutionary
method,

00:44:35.199 --> 00:44:38.440
not only in Britain but also
globally.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.853
It was also the first example
of a new and highly effective

00:44:42.853 --> 00:44:45.744
style of public health,
by vaccination,

00:44:45.744 --> 00:44:49.170
a method that's proved its
effectiveness;

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:53.291
certainly with regard to
smallpox, but you could also

00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:55.668
mention polio,
tetanus, rabies,

00:44:55.668 --> 00:44:59.710
influenza, diphtheria,
shingles, and a host of other

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:00.900
diseases.
 

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.639
And Jenner soon made
influential converts,

00:45:04.639 --> 00:45:09.306
who established vaccination as
a major instrument of public

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:13.902
health: Napoleon in France,
Pope Pius VII in Rome,

00:45:13.902 --> 00:45:19.659
Benjamin Waterhouse and Thomas
Jefferson on these shores.

00:45:19.659 --> 00:45:23.123
Jenner's method,
then, was a means to combat

00:45:23.123 --> 00:45:24.010
smallpox.
 

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:29.365
And unlike inoculation,
vaccination didn't introduce an

00:45:29.365 --> 00:45:35.021
infection of smallpox itself,
and therefore had no risk of

00:45:35.021 --> 00:45:38.889
setting off an unintended
epidemic.

00:45:38.889 --> 00:45:43.510
It also had a low risk of
serious complications for the

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:47.360
individual patient,
and no risk at all for the

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.559
community.
 

00:45:48.559 --> 00:45:51.389
But there were problems with
Jenner's method,

00:45:51.389 --> 00:45:55.998
and it was to require a series
of subsequent improvements to

00:45:55.998 --> 00:45:59.750
make vaccination a fully
successful procedure.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.969
The problems involved such
things as he required,

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:05.402
at the time,
an arm-to-arm method,

00:46:05.402 --> 00:46:09.679
and this entailed the risk of
spreading other diseases,

00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:14.094
in particular syphilis,
while trying to present

00:46:14.094 --> 00:46:15.150
smallpox.
 

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:19.204
There were also failed
vaccinations that led to

00:46:19.204 --> 00:46:22.641
complications,
and Jenner made a crucial

00:46:22.641 --> 00:46:23.699
mistake.
 

00:46:23.699 --> 00:46:28.617
He made it an article of
dogmatic faith that the immunity

00:46:28.617 --> 00:46:32.922
derived from smallpox
vaccination artificially was

00:46:32.922 --> 00:46:36.422
life-long,
just like the natural immunity

00:46:36.422 --> 00:46:40.150
that was acquired,
and he steadfastly refused to

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:43.989
consider evidence that ran
counter to his dogma.

00:46:43.989 --> 00:46:49.110
In fact, artificial immunity
wears off,

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.643
it's now known,
after a period that's not quite

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.972
understood,
but ten, fifteen,

00:46:54.972 --> 00:46:57.110
twenty years,
and requires,

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:01.610
to still be valid,
re-vaccination.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:07.340
This blindness on Jenner's part
discredited vaccination in some

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.550
quarters,
and was one factor--these

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:14.672
various limitations then--
for one of the most powerful

00:47:14.672 --> 00:47:17.518
mass movements of the nineteenth
century,

00:47:17.518 --> 00:47:20.099
and one that's still with us
today,

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:23.750
and that is the antivaccination
movement.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:28.425
Vaccination became one of the
contested debates of

00:47:28.425 --> 00:47:31.289
nineteenth-century medicine.
 

00:47:31.289 --> 00:47:35.759
In Britain, an Antivaccination
League was founded,

00:47:35.759 --> 00:47:39.500
and became a major political
influence.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.610
There were various sources of
opposition.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:46.438
There was the empirical
observation of failure,

00:47:46.438 --> 00:47:49.516
as I've said,
when people who had been

00:47:49.516 --> 00:47:53.179
vaccinated actually contracted
smallpox.

00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:56.956
There was the opposition of
liberals and libertarians to

00:47:56.956 --> 00:48:00.804
what they regarded as the
excessive power of the state in

00:48:00.804 --> 00:48:03.139
making vaccination compulsory.
 

00:48:03.139 --> 00:48:05.110
And there was religious
opposition,

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:09.889
people who considered it an act
of impiety to introduce material

00:48:09.889 --> 00:48:14.943
from animals into a human body,
and there were sardonic posters

00:48:14.943 --> 00:48:19.574
featuring people undergoing
vaccination while they sprouted

00:48:19.574 --> 00:48:21.889
horns or turned into cows.
 

00:48:21.889 --> 00:48:26.835
But despite vaccination,
there was, in Britain,

00:48:26.835 --> 00:48:33.179
an Act of 1840 that provided
for free infant vaccination.

00:48:33.179 --> 00:48:37.336
And from that time,
the annual toll from smallpox

00:48:37.336 --> 00:48:40.827
began to plummet,
despite the fact that the

00:48:40.827 --> 00:48:44.907
nineteenth century provided
conditions that would have been

00:48:44.907 --> 00:48:48.704
favorable to promoting the
disease: improved and speedy

00:48:48.704 --> 00:48:50.876
transport,
with steamships,

00:48:50.876 --> 00:48:55.192
canals and the railroads;
crowding with a population that

00:48:55.192 --> 00:48:59.574
was ever more mobile,
massive growth and urbanization

00:48:59.574 --> 00:49:01.260
and large cities.
 

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:07.188
And those changes and advances
were reproduced across Europe

00:49:07.188 --> 00:49:09.199
and North America.
 

00:49:09.199 --> 00:49:12.090
And there were technological
improvements as well--

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:16.710
all of which leads me to the
end of this morning--

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:21.248
which is to say in 1959,
the World Health Organization

00:49:21.248 --> 00:49:26.559
undertook the unprecedented step
of launching a global smallpox

00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:30.670
eradication program by means of
vaccination.

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:36.239
In 1977, the final natural case
occurred.

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:39.835
And in 1980,
smallpox was declared,

00:49:39.835 --> 00:49:45.018
by the WHO, eradicated
everywhere on the globe.

00:49:45.018 --> 00:49:50.224
So, vaccination then comes with
this extraordinary history of

00:49:50.224 --> 00:49:53.869
public health,
of combating a major disease

00:49:53.869 --> 00:49:57.860
like smallpox and actually
eradicating it.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.195
What we'll want to do,
as we move through the course,

00:50:02.195 --> 00:50:06.697
is to ask what are the
conditions that make vaccination

00:50:06.697 --> 00:50:10.199
an appropriate tool for public
health?

00:50:10.199 --> 00:50:12.059
When is it not appropriate?
 

00:50:12.059 --> 00:50:16.349
Why are there such difficulties
with poliomyelitis,

00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:18.579
as we're speaking today?
 

00:50:18.579 --> 00:50:22.965
Was smallpox the beginning of a
wave of diseases to be

00:50:22.965 --> 00:50:25.780
eradicated this way,
one by one?

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:31.300
Or was smallpox an exception,
a special case?

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.619
Well, stay tuned,
and we'll deal with that.

00:50:33.619 --> 00:50:39.000

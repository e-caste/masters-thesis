00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.233
PAUL FREEDMAN: So
today is an exciting day,

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:10.600
because the papers are due,
because the midterm is soon,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.100
but most of all, because we're
finishing up our talk on the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.167
Merovingians.

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:15.900
Questions?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.167
Comments?

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.300
Cat names?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.767
So the Merovingians.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:26.833
Remember that the reason we're
studying them is as an example

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:32.233
of barbarian kingship, barbarian
states, and the

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.533
post-Roman world.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:42.300
"Post-Roman" meaning that the
Roman Empire is gone, but the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.467
society is not completely
severed.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:52.400
Its connections with the Roman
tradition are not severed.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.267
This is most obvious in the
Church and the survival of

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:05.367
Latin learning, bishops,
Christianity, literacy.

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:10.200
But even though we seem to be
in an environment of rather

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.900
primitive, and even, we could
use the word loosely,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.900
barbarian kings, I hope that
we'll see that within

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.633
Gregory's narrative, there is
evidence of a kind of royal

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:28.500
administration and a certain
sense of purpose.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.767
We are entering a period in
which we have to start asking,

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:39.533
"what held society together?"
This becomes a question when

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.900
two things start to fail.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.300
One is the government.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.700
Where it's really not clear that
there is a government,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.633
other than powerful
people plundering

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:52.900
less powerful people.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.000
And the other factor is when
the people themselves don't

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.600
really believe that there is
any force holding their

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.033
society together, anything that
they unconsciously give

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.033
deference to.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:14.767
So we're all familiar with what
are called now "failed

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:18.033
states." That is, polities
that have an official

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:21.833
existence, but that cannot seem
to keep the most basic

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:26.300
form of order within their
borders, whatever those

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.100
borders may be.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.567
So unfortunate states like
Somalia, or no longer, but ten

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.700
years ago, Liberia,
Sierra Leone, were

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.433
examples of failed states.

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:44.300
And this is a phenomenon
that has grown in the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.967
contemporary world.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.033
In the Middle Ages-- and here
we're talking about the period

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:56.667
from the collapse of Roman
authority in the West in the

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:01.200
fifth century until at least
the twelfth century--

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.500
there are various kinds
of societies

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.133
that are held together.

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:12.033
They're not as anarchaic
as Somalia, actually.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:15.600
But they are not held together
by government in the sense

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.700
that we understand it.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.367
They are held together partly
by informal social

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:24.500
networks and ties.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:33.333
Things like kinship, family,
private vengeance, religion.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.400
But by having to ask the
question "What holds society

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.433
together?" you are already
making a kind of statement

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.500
about the sort of society
you're talking about.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.300
I would say that the United
States has, for most of its

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.267
history, been a polity in which
this kind of question

00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:59.767
didn't have to be asked.

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:03.000
It's not that people loved
the government, or even

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.567
particularly deferred to it.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:08.400
But that in their everyday
life, in their everyday

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.600
gestures and in their everyday
assumptions, they assumed that

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.100
were protected.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.400
They normally did not have to go
out with a weapon in order

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.233
to feel that they would
not be robbed.

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:27.733
There are exceptional
communities where

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:29.633
that's not been true.

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:35.400
But generally speaking, you
could assume that the police

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.300
or the police forces intimidated
criminals or

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.300
potential evildoers.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.000
You would, you know, send your
bills in by mail, assuming

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.100
that they would arrive, that a
government agency would take

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.000
care of the transport of them.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.467
You might try not to pay as
much taxes as you perhaps

00:04:56.467 --> 00:05:01.200
owed, but you wouldn't really
try to just be under the radar

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.700
of the government, because
you would assume that

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.600
you couldn't do that.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.433
You would have to make some
kind of tax payment.

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:08.800
And on and on.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.233
Educating your children,
signing up for Social

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:17.733
Security, being part
of a community.

00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:22.600
The mark of privilege, then,
historically, is not having to

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.633
think about the ties that hold
your society together.

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:31.067
If you had to come up with a
standard with which to measure

00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:35.233
human happiness, that might
not be such a bad one.

00:05:35.233 --> 00:05:37.733
Now, there are other forms
of human happiness.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:39.300
Total independence.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.867
The idea of the person who lives
out somewhere on the

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:47.267
farm and is completely
self-sufficient, has all of

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:50.100
the food that they need, either
that they catch or

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.167
cultivate, lives in some kind of
wonderful climate in which

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.100
the food grows on trees.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.900
Dreams of authors of the
nineteenth century in Europe

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.433
and America about the
South Sea Islanders.

00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:08.900
So we have in our imagination
the idea of living a blissful

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.733
life without any particular
social ties, or only the most

00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:15.967
casual ones.

00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:24.300
But I think we all know that
usually, such an existence,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.100
when it, in fact, exists at
all, is an invitation for

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.667
someone else to plunder
it and to steal it.

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:34.767
Part of the reason for social
ties is company.

00:06:34.767 --> 00:06:37.833
Part of the reason for social
ties is protection.

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:42.000
So when asking what held
Barbarian societies together,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
we're asking something that's
more than just a banal

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.267
question of medieval
sociology.

00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:54.567
We're asking a question about
the fundamental nature of a

00:06:54.567 --> 00:07:00.300
society that is not so
unsuccessful as people think.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.433
You know, again, nobody wakes
up in 560 AD saying how

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:10.200
unfortunate it is that they're
alive in the Dark Ages.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.233
They didn't call it
the Dark Ages.

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:15.533
They didn't think it
was the Dark Ages.

00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:20.267
And it wasn't the Dark
Ages, I hope to show.

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:23.867
Now, Gregory of Tours is a great
source because he gives

00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:26.000
a lot of very miscellaneous
information.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.867
He's perhaps a source who
likes violence, though.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.567
He likes violence for
reasons we were

00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:34.300
talking about last week.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.500
He wants to show that on the
one hand, the life of human

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.567
beings is terrible and full of
outrage and violence, but that

00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:45.167
it is redeemed by God's
solicitude.

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:50.233
And that those people who
recognize God's power, as

00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:53.367
manifested through bishops,
saints, the rites of the

00:07:53.367 --> 00:07:58.433
church, will, if not prosper
always in this life, at least

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:03.100
receive a reward that is
commensurate with their

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.800
loyalty to God.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.600
Gregory is a pessimist.
One of the reasons--

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.867
one of the themes that
guides this work--

00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:13.633
I was going to say one of the
reasons he wrote this work,

00:08:13.633 --> 00:08:16.200
but I don't want to kind of
venture that far out.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.933
One of the aspects that unites
this work is a sense of the

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:27.800
decline of the Franks, from
the model, Clovis, to the

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.100
fools that he feels he has to
deal with, like Chilperic.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.200
Three generations--

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.500
the generation of Clovis, the
generation of Clovis's sons,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.433
the generation of Clovis's
grandsons.

00:08:39.433 --> 00:08:42.567
Each one worse than
the one before it.

00:08:42.567 --> 00:08:45.467
So if he had grudgingly
acknowledged that the sons of

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:49.067
Clovis fulfilled, in some sense,
a mission in accord

00:08:49.067 --> 00:08:54.200
with God's plan, he was much
more clearly hostile to this

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.900
third generation of Merovingian
leaders.

00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:07.300
He says at one point in a part
that is not in Murray, "To

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.967
this day, one is still amazed
and astonished at the

00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:13.167
disasters which befell these
people." And I think I

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.733
mentioned this little
passage before.

00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:18.633
"We can only contrast how their
forefathers used to

00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:21.733
behave, and how they themselves
are behaving

00:09:21.733 --> 00:09:22.833
today."

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:28.600
So he is scolding the current
generation and exalting the

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.867
older ways.

00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:34.033
He is scolding them for
their violence.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.700
But what about the
fact that, as we

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.800
emphasized, Clovis was violent?

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:47.433
What he's really scolding them
for, then, is not violence as

00:09:47.433 --> 00:09:53.267
such, but violence channeled
to unproductive ends.

00:09:53.267 --> 00:09:58.033
Violence is inevitable,
in Gregory's world.

00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:03.567
Violence in defense of the
true faith is not only

00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:07.833
acceptable, but necessary
in order to defend that.

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:12.100
And Gregory's interest, as I
hope I'll show, in the true

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.967
faith, is not just a defense of
Christianity as a religion,

00:10:15.967 --> 00:10:20.700
but Christianity as the thing
that holds society together.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.400
If you asked Gregory what holds
society together, he

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.733
would give some kind of answer
on the order of the bishops,

00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:34.900
the saints, the supernatural,
the Church.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.733
And then if you said, "Well,
what is the role of the king

00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:41.233
in this?" It's basically
to terrorize people.

00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:48.867
To make sure that the mere
threat of divine vengeance is

00:10:48.867 --> 00:10:53.367
backed up by threats of
a more immediate sort.

00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:56.500
Throughout the history of the
Franks, although not excerpted

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.467
so much in the edition we're
using, there are examples of

00:11:00.467 --> 00:11:05.833
people who hold God, Saint
Martin, or the bishop, or some

00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:09.400
other saint in contempt, and
who pay for it, often with

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.467
their lives.

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:17.800
So in Gregory's official
presentation of events, any

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.967
defiance of God is met
with a thunderbolt.

00:11:22.967 --> 00:11:25.700
But he's not actually a fool.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:31.100
I know in the dark moments of
2 AM, reading Gregory, that

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.933
thought may have crossed
your mind.

00:11:32.933 --> 00:11:39.667
And I know that you repressed it
very quickly, and it's evil

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:41.000
of me even to raise it.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.600
But lest you think that he's
just a credulous guy who lived

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.233
in the sixth century AD and
whatever, he is perceptive,

00:11:50.233 --> 00:11:53.233
and he understands that most
people, most of the time,

00:11:53.233 --> 00:11:55.700
thunderbolt of God
notwithstanding, need

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.200
something a little
more immediate to

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.800
whip them into shape.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.933
That is, to follow a kind
of basic civil order.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.467
And that is supposed
to be the ruler.

00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:10.300
So it's fine for the ruler
to be violent.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.900
And it's even OK if some people
get caught in the jaws

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.967
of the state, if we can call
it that, or let's say, the

00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:22.400
jaws of the king, who should
not have been punished.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.000
But look at the people
he's dealing with.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.067
He's dealing with people who
were violent, as well as kind

00:12:33.067 --> 00:12:36.067
of silly and quixotic.

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:42.733
He has this little conversation
with Chilperic

00:12:42.733 --> 00:12:47.667
that reminds one of
pseudo-learned people,

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:50.933
bloodthirsty dictators with
pseudo-learning, on the order

00:12:50.933 --> 00:12:53.200
of Muammar Gaddafi.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.833
People who sort of study some
stuff, and decide that they're

00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:59.067
experts on it because they're
able to terrorize their

00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:00.267
population.

00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:03.867
"So Chilperic issued
a circular"--

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.033
this is on page 111--

00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:08.400
"a circular to the effect that
the Holy Trinity was to refer

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.000
not to distinct persons,
but only God.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.367
That it's unseemly for God to
be called a person, like a

00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:16.200
mortal of flesh and blood.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.300
He also declared that the Father
is the same as the Son,

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.333
and the Holy Spirit is the same
as the Father and Son."

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:23.967
Well, you know, people had died,
and they certainly had

00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:26.567
written huge controversial
works, and had lots of

00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:28.433
councils over this issue.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:31.267
And this is not right.

00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:35.267
Nobody actually really believes
this in Christianity.

00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:37.267
"This is how it appeared the
prophets and patriarchs, he

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:40.967
said, and this is how the law
itself proclaimed Him."

00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:44.567
Meaning Christ. And he then
tells Gregory, "OK.

00:13:44.567 --> 00:13:46.833
This is the law I want you and
the other members of the

00:13:46.833 --> 00:13:50.967
church to believe." And Gregory
said, "Give up this

00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:52.000
false belief.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.167
You must observe the doctrines
passed onto us by other

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:58.300
teachers of the Church, who
followed in the footsteps of

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.067
the apostles, the teaching
furnished by Hilary and

00:14:02.067 --> 00:14:08.700
Eusebius, and the confession you
yourself made at baptism."

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.067
He's got to say this.

00:14:10.067 --> 00:14:12.767
I mean, he is very courageous
to say this to the king.

00:14:12.767 --> 00:14:14.367
But the king--

00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:19.867
it is like somebody who is
extremely powerful denying

00:14:19.867 --> 00:14:23.767
very basic scientific facts.

00:14:23.767 --> 00:14:27.400
Stalin tried to impose the
biological theories of

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:35.167
Lysenko, which basically went
against the consensus of

00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:38.267
evolutionary biology
at the time.

00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:42.000
So this kind of pseudo-learning
is a feature

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.733
of people who, since they're
being acclaimed as geniuses

00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:47.633
and as leaders, assume that
their expertise carries over

00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:48.567
to all sorts of fields.

00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:50.367
Well, the king grows angry.

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:53.400
He says, "It's quite obvious
that I regard Hilary and

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.367
Eusebius as my bitterest
opponents on this issue." Not

00:14:57.367 --> 00:15:00.100
only have Saints Hilary and
Eusebius been dead for years,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.667
but they're saints, they're
theologians.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:05.800
You know, it would be like me
saying, "Well, obviously

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.267
Charlemagne and Clovis are my
enemies." A statement that is

00:15:10.267 --> 00:15:11.500
ridiculous.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.633
And note Gregory's response: "It
would suit you better to

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:21.000
watch out you do not make God or
his saints angry." And that

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.367
could really serve as one of the
themes of the entire work.

00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:27.700
"For you should know that the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.067
are all distinct in person."
And then he goes on to the

00:15:31.067 --> 00:15:35.567
theological justification.

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:39.100
And then the king's response
is, "I'm going to find some

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.800
people smarter than you are."
And Gregory says, "Such a

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.033
person will not be smarter,
but an idiot.

00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:49.700
Anyone who wants to follow what
you propose would be an

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.200
idiot." "Grinding his teeth at
this response, he said, no

00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:00.267
more." And another bishop
is consulted.

00:16:00.267 --> 00:16:01.267
So the king gives this up.

00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:04.000
And then he starts writing a
treatise on the alphabet and

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.100
wants to add some letters, and
tells the teachers that the

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.367
educational system needs
to be modified to

00:16:11.367 --> 00:16:12.533
include these letters.

00:16:12.533 --> 00:16:15.167
Well, I go into this digression
to show you, first

00:16:15.167 --> 00:16:18.067
of all, Chilperic actually
is literate.

00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:19.867
He is actually educated.

00:16:19.867 --> 00:16:23.867
He's at least educated enough to
have half-baked ideas, and

00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:27.767
that's more than some kings of
this time and later will be.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.433
He tried writing poetry,
as well.

00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:37.433
He also tried to depose Gregory
as bishop, which is in

00:16:37.433 --> 00:16:40.167
some later books.

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:41.467
Who are these people, then?

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.100
What is the basis
of their power?

00:16:46.467 --> 00:16:50.333
The kingship is, in large
measure, based

00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:53.667
on inherited status.

00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:57.467
The Merovingian family had
an aura of sacredness and

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:01.600
prestige that made it impossible
to conceive of

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.900
anybody not of their
bloodline ruling.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.033
This power is partly the
prestige of Clovis, who is

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:20.033
seen as really the father of his
people, bringing them into

00:17:20.033 --> 00:17:23.567
what would become France, or
the Land of the Franks, and

00:17:23.567 --> 00:17:26.667
converting to Christianity.

00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:29.767
But a lot of the prestige
is what might be called

00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:33.333
"pre-Christian."
The long hair.

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:38.100
The riding around in carts,
four-wheeled carts.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.467
And we've seen that the long
hair is quite crucial.

00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:45.067
Once it's cut in a humiliating
manner, the representative of

00:17:45.067 --> 00:17:51.500
the family loses some crucial
kind of prestige.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.067
Remember that choice presented
to Queen Clotilde: the

00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:57.500
scissors or the sword.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.900
You want your grandchildren
scalped, or at least, given a

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.467
military haircut, or--

00:18:06.467 --> 00:18:09.133
actually, a monastic haircut,
in this context--

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:10.467
or do you want them killed?

00:18:10.467 --> 00:18:12.900
And she is so angry at this
that she, in fact, says

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:20.633
"killed." That shows you, at
least, the humiliation that is

00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:23.267
involved in this haircutting.

00:18:23.267 --> 00:18:28.433
These kings also practice
something on

00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:30.800
the order of polygamy.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.333
They are Christians, but they
are still tribal leaders in a

00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:39.400
society in which the possession
of the women, in

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.967
the plural, is a
sign of status.

00:18:48.233 --> 00:18:54.167
One passage that describes a
number of different things

00:18:54.167 --> 00:19:05.167
fairly usefully is on page 58.

00:19:05.167 --> 00:19:06.500
And this is the marriage.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.667
And again, it seems random when
you're reading through

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:11.067
it, but then that's the point
of lecture, is to highlight

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.200
the seemingly random,
isn't it.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.633
On page 58, Chilperic's wives.

00:19:17.633 --> 00:19:21.500
"Chilperic asks for
Brunhilda"--

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.267
this other, Visigothic queen
of one of his brothers--

00:19:26.267 --> 00:19:30.167
"asks for the hand of her
sister, Galswinthe, although

00:19:30.167 --> 00:19:35.067
he already had several
wives." OK.

00:19:35.067 --> 00:19:38.867
So he promises the envoy he will
put away the other wives.

00:19:38.867 --> 00:19:43.167
He will renounce them, and he
will be married only to

00:19:43.167 --> 00:19:43.900
Galswinthe.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.500
And so with these assurances,
her father sent his daughter,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.867
as he had send the first,
along with a

00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:52.067
great deal of wealth.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:58.133
This is what's called a dowry,
D-O-W-R-Y, a payment made by

00:19:58.133 --> 00:20:02.733
the bride's family
to the groom.

00:20:02.733 --> 00:20:05.100
"When she came to King
Chilperic, she was received

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.300
with great honor and
made his wife.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.733
And, for the time being, his
love for her was considerable,

00:20:10.733 --> 00:20:14.967
for she had brought great
treasure." OK.

00:20:14.967 --> 00:20:19.900
It's not a, you know, a "we both
like horseback riding"

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.933
kind of relationship, although
they probably did.

00:20:25.967 --> 00:20:29.300
"But because of his love
for Fredegunde"--

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.567
who is another wife, a
low-status wife, a wife who

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:39.000
didn't bring him much money,
but who was mesmerizing, or

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.067
beautiful, or certainly
had a hold over him.

00:20:43.067 --> 00:20:45.400
"Because of his love for
Fredegunde, whom he had

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.867
before, a disgraceful conflict
arose to divide them.

00:20:48.867 --> 00:20:51.500
Galswinthe had already been
converted to the Catholic

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.000
creed." That is, she had been
a Visigothic princess raised

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.367
as an Arian.

00:20:56.367 --> 00:20:58.667
She's now been converted.

00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:01.533
"She complained to the king of
the wrongs that she constantly

00:21:01.533 --> 00:21:06.967
had to endure, and said that
he no respect for her.

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:09.267
Finally, she asked him to give
her her freedom to return to

00:21:09.267 --> 00:21:11.967
her native land if she left
the treasures that she had

00:21:11.967 --> 00:21:16.000
brought him." Which seems
like a reasonable deal.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.400
"But he made up various excuses,
he mollified her with

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.367
sweet words, and in the end,
he had her strangled by a

00:21:21.367 --> 00:21:26.200
slave, and he himself found
the corpse on the bed."

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.333
Why didn't he just let her
go, keeping the treasure?

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:32.700
Um, humiliating, probably.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.433
Better to kill her.

00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:40.233
Why didn't he do what
he said he did?

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:43.433
You know, he's a barbarian
ruler.

00:21:43.433 --> 00:21:47.767
"After her death, God revealed
a great sign of his power.

00:21:47.767 --> 00:21:51.033
A lamp burned before her tomb,
suspended by a cord.

00:21:51.033 --> 00:21:53.667
Without anyone touching it, the
cord broke, and the lamp

00:21:53.667 --> 00:21:55.267
fell to the pavement.

00:21:55.267 --> 00:21:58.333
The hard pavement gave way
before it, and the lamp, as it

00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:01.300
had landed on some kind of soft
substance, was buried in

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.667
the middle and not all broken.

00:22:03.667 --> 00:22:06.767
To those who saw it, this did
not happen without a great

00:22:06.767 --> 00:22:08.200
miracle."

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.467
Well, as miracles go in Gregory
of Tours, this is

00:22:10.467 --> 00:22:11.833
pretty pedestrian.

00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:13.333
A freak accident.

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:18.767
The lamp breaks, the exterior
breaks, but the actual lamp

00:22:18.767 --> 00:22:20.433
part does not.

00:22:20.433 --> 00:22:23.833
But it is a sign in Gregory, and
these things don't happen

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:26.867
at random in Gregory.

00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:29.633
"The king wept over the body,
and then after a few days,

00:22:29.633 --> 00:22:32.633
took Fredegunde back
again as his wife.

00:22:32.633 --> 00:22:34.833
When he did this, his brothers
attributed Galswinthe's

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:39.400
killing to his orders and
toppled him from power." The

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.800
editor points out that probably

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.133
they didn't, actually.

00:22:42.133 --> 00:22:45.000
This is a little bit too pat,
and it may be a case of

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.767
Gregory arranging the world so
that the evil get punished in

00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:51.933
ways that they ought to, rather
than in the ways that

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:55.133
they do or don't.

00:22:55.133 --> 00:23:05.533
But nevertheless, the portrait
is of a polygamous king, a

00:23:05.533 --> 00:23:10.733
king who accumulates treasure,
a king who is unscrupulous

00:23:10.733 --> 00:23:18.433
enough to kill his wife, does
not seem to hide it very much.

00:23:23.533 --> 00:23:29.567
However, vengeance is taken on
him both by supernatural

00:23:29.567 --> 00:23:34.400
powers and by natural forces.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.967
So in talking about the bases of
kinship, we have blood, and

00:23:39.967 --> 00:23:43.300
then war leadership.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.867
I have tried not to
overemphasize the violence of

00:23:46.867 --> 00:23:49.500
this society, but it is
a society in which war

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:56.067
leadership is one of two major
criteria of political

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:58.600
leadership, the other being
spiritual leadership, that

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.167
we're going to talk
about towards

00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:03.033
the end of the lecture.

00:24:03.033 --> 00:24:09.233
The loyalty of the king's
entourage was based on his

00:24:09.233 --> 00:24:13.533
ability to reward them
with plunder.

00:24:13.533 --> 00:24:19.800
Remember that King Chlothar goes
out to fight the Saxons,

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.700
but the Saxons actually give him
a good deal, and offer to

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.600
give up a lot of their
territory.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.700
And he says to his men,
"I think this is

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.633
a reasonable thing.

00:24:30.633 --> 00:24:32.667
The Saxons are pretty
well armed.

00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:36.600
They're going to negotiate with
us." It's on pages 50-51.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.867
But the men won't accept that.

00:24:37.867 --> 00:24:41.467
They haven't come on this
military expedition for

00:24:41.467 --> 00:24:42.967
political reasons.

00:24:42.967 --> 00:24:44.533
They want plunder.

00:24:44.533 --> 00:24:47.000
And so they force him, they
threaten to kill him if he

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.633
doesn't lead them into battle.

00:24:50.633 --> 00:24:55.467
So in certain respects,
we're back to the

00:24:55.467 --> 00:24:56.633
situation of Clovis.

00:24:56.633 --> 00:24:58.667
On the one, hand he seems
very powerful.

00:24:58.667 --> 00:25:02.000
On the other hand, he seems
intimidated by his followers.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.533
And this is an accurate picture
of the position of

00:25:05.533 --> 00:25:06.767
rulership at this time.

00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:09.033
The king has to reward
his followers.

00:25:09.033 --> 00:25:14.033
Because they're not following
him for reasons of abstract

00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:15.467
political loyalty.

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:18.167
They're not Merovingian
patriots.

00:25:18.167 --> 00:25:20.667
They don't have a
national anthem.

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:22.933
They don't have a flag.

00:25:22.933 --> 00:25:25.067
They have a pledge of
allegiance, but it's a private

00:25:25.067 --> 00:25:27.400
pledge of allegiance, of
warrior to warrior.

00:25:32.367 --> 00:25:37.467
He has two ways of rewarding
them-- plunder or land.

00:25:37.467 --> 00:25:41.767
He can't pay them a salary,
because the economy does not

00:25:41.767 --> 00:25:47.833
produce revenue in
quite this way.

00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:51.533
It does, but it doesn't produce
enough to reward

00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:53.767
soldiers in the way
they want to be.

00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:58.433
Therefore, a successful leader
is one who leads his troops

00:25:58.433 --> 00:26:02.100
into victory in battle.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.967
If he doesn't expand his
possessions, if he doesn't

00:26:05.967 --> 00:26:10.200
lead them successfully, he's
going to have to start giving

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.267
away lands that belong to the
king, or to the state, if we

00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:15.067
can call it that.

00:26:15.067 --> 00:26:20.300
And once he starts doing that,
he's going to start having an

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:27.267
erosion of his own revenue to
the weakening of his dynasty

00:26:27.267 --> 00:26:30.400
and his power.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.667
For the time being, in the world
of Gregory of Tours, the

00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:35.333
kings are wealthy.

00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:41.600
There is a description of an
extraordinary dowry sent with

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.667
a princess named Rigunth, beyond
the page assignments

00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:51.833
that you read.

00:26:51.833 --> 00:26:59.267
And there was so much stuff that
"it took fifty wagons to

00:26:59.267 --> 00:27:03.233
carry the gold and silver and
other ornaments." "The Franks

00:27:03.233 --> 00:27:06.267
offered many gifts, some giving
gold, some silver, many

00:27:06.267 --> 00:27:15.500
giving horses, and most
garments." "The mother of the

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.467
princess brought so much gold
and silver and garments that

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:20.033
when the king saw it, he thought
he was left with

00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:21.867
nothing." Ha ha ha.

00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:28.333
In fact, the quantities of gold,
silver, silks and other

00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:30.767
fine fabrics are quite
impressive.

00:27:30.767 --> 00:27:33.033
Kings are very wealthy.

00:27:33.033 --> 00:27:36.167
And they're wealthy because
of plunder, but

00:27:36.167 --> 00:27:38.267
also because of taxes.

00:27:38.267 --> 00:27:41.300
If you read Gregory carefully,
you will see that the kings

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.500
are collecting taxes.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.967
In order to collect taxes,
you've got to have some sort

00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:49.867
of records.

00:27:49.867 --> 00:27:52.567
You've got to know
where people are.

00:27:52.567 --> 00:27:55.067
You've got to have a kind of
a register of property.

00:27:55.067 --> 00:27:58.900
I'm distinguishing taxes
from plunder.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.400
You can plunder your
own people.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.367
That is, you can just ride
around and take cattle that

00:28:05.367 --> 00:28:11.700
happen to be passing by, or burn
people's farms, or shake

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.800
them down, you know, threaten to
cut off their ears if they

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:22.067
don't cough up a certain amount
of money in treasure.

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:25.100
The problem with that is, of
course, you start killing your

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.767
own economy, and even Barbarian

00:28:26.767 --> 00:28:28.767
kings recognize that.

00:28:28.767 --> 00:28:35.167
But they do then have a kind
of administration.

00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:39.000
And here again, we have an
interesting interaction of

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.867
what might be called the
practical and the

00:28:43.867 --> 00:28:45.033
superstitious.

00:28:45.033 --> 00:28:47.767
The death of Chilperic's
son by dysentery,

00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:49.600
described on page 105.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.800
There's a serious epidemic.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.133
The epidemic is, of course,
announced by portents.

00:28:56.133 --> 00:28:59.400
Whoever heard of an epidemic
disease that wasn't preceded

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:06.333
by coments, or eclipses, or, you
know, heavenly phenomena?

00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:08.500
"While the kings were quarreling
again, dysentery

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.767
affected nearly all of Gaul.

00:29:10.767 --> 00:29:13.600
High fever with vomiting,
extreme pain in the kidneys,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.100
headaches, and neck pain,
saffron-colored

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.033
or even green vomit.

00:29:19.033 --> 00:29:20.867
Some people thought
it was a secret

00:29:20.867 --> 00:29:24.333
poison." Blah blah blah.

00:29:24.333 --> 00:29:26.433
It affected children.

00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:29.533
"We lost children so sweet and
dear to us, whom we sat on our

00:29:29.533 --> 00:29:36.800
laps, or carried in our arms,
and nursed with such care."

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.300
Chilperic's younger
son became sick.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.600
When they saw that the end was
near, they baptized him.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.833
He was doing a little better
when his older brother named

00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:50.400
Clodebert was stricken
by the same disease.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.367
Now, these are the children of
Fredegunde, the lower-status

00:29:55.367 --> 00:29:59.667
but extremely powerful
concubine, wife, whatever you

00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:02.000
want to call her.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.667
"And Fredegunde, seeing that
they were in danger of death,

00:30:04.667 --> 00:30:09.600
became repentant." And she says,
"For a long time, the

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.867
divine goodness has endured
our evildoing.

00:30:13.867 --> 00:30:17.400
Often it has rebuked us with
fevers and other afflictions,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.767
and repentance did not follow.

00:30:19.767 --> 00:30:22.567
Look, now we are losing
our sons.

00:30:22.567 --> 00:30:27.167
The tears of the poor, the
laments of widows, and the

00:30:27.167 --> 00:30:30.467
sighs of orphans are
killing them.

00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:33.367
We are left without a reason
for gathering up anything.

00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:36.400
We pile up riches and do not
know for whom we gather it.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.033
Our treasury will be left
without an owner, full of

00:30:39.033 --> 00:30:40.267
plunder and curses.

00:30:43.367 --> 00:30:46.933
Were our storehouses not already
overflowing with wine,

00:30:46.933 --> 00:30:50.333
were our barns not already
full of grain, were our

00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:54.200
treasuries not laden with gold,
silver, precious stones,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.833
necklaces, and the rest of the
trappings of emperors?

00:30:57.833 --> 00:30:59.333
Look, we are losing
what we held to

00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:00.767
be even more beautiful.

00:31:00.767 --> 00:31:06.267
Now please, come, let us burn
all the unjust registers."

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:09.900
In other words, let's burn
the tax registers.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:14.333
Let's burn the records we
have of who owes what.

00:31:14.333 --> 00:31:16.400
"And let what was sufficient
for your father, King

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.767
Chlothar, be sufficient
for us."

00:31:21.767 --> 00:31:23.333
"And then she ordered
brought forward the

00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:25.067
registers that Marcus"--

00:31:25.067 --> 00:31:26.433
we don't know who he is--

00:31:26.433 --> 00:31:28.400
"had delivered from
her cities.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.633
She had them thrown in the fire
and then turned to the

00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:35.833
king," who's not eager to have
his registers burned, but

00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:38.333
finally he does.

00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:40.633
And they stop future
assessments.

00:31:40.633 --> 00:31:41.867
And the kids die anyway.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.433
"After this, King Chilperic was
generous to cathedrals,

00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:54.200
basilicas, and the poor." He's
sort of learned his lesson.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.667
But it's very interesting, this
idea that what is killing

00:31:57.667 --> 00:32:02.400
their children is the vengeance
of God, and that the

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.133
poor, the widows, the orphans,
the people that they have

00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:09.567
oppressed, have a kind of
power of vengeance by

00:32:09.567 --> 00:32:14.167
mobilizing this supernatural
force.

00:32:14.167 --> 00:32:16.433
On the one hand, this is
a regular old story.

00:32:16.433 --> 00:32:21.033
People, when they are faced
with difficult situations,

00:32:21.033 --> 00:32:25.200
often pray, often promise,
make some sort of deal.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.900
Get me out of this, oh Lord,
and I will A) never do it

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:35.667
again, B) do something else,
C) I'll be really grateful.

00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:38.733
And sometimes it appears
to work, and

00:32:38.733 --> 00:32:40.333
sometimes it doesn't.

00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:45.167
But it is a perfectly
understandable emotion.

00:32:45.167 --> 00:32:50.067
But the belief that supernatural
forces affect

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:55.800
politics, the belief in the
political leaders themselves,

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.667
the knowledge that they are
evil, and that God has, at

00:33:01.667 --> 00:33:06.433
least for a while, committed
this evil is very, very

00:33:06.433 --> 00:33:10.767
powerful, and very, very
uppermost in the mind of even

00:33:10.767 --> 00:33:15.633
an uneducated and, as Gregory
himself demonstrates, normally

00:33:15.633 --> 00:33:21.167
thoroughly unscrupulous
character like Fredegunde.

00:33:21.167 --> 00:33:25.067
So what makes a good ruler,
according to Gregory?

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:28.000
Not peacefulness, since he
believes the job of the ruler

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.700
is to inflict fear, at
the minimum, and

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.733
damage, more likely.

00:33:35.733 --> 00:33:39.667
At one point, he describes
Theudebert, one of the sons of

00:33:39.667 --> 00:33:41.833
Clovis, one of the members of
the second generation, the

00:33:41.833 --> 00:33:44.900
closest thing he has
to a good ruler.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.467
He says of Theudebert, "He
ruled his kingdom justly,

00:33:48.467 --> 00:33:53.667
respected his bishops, was
liberal to churches, relieved

00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:57.400
the wants of the poor, and
distributed many benefits with

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:04.200
piety and goodwill." So he
is a just ruler, and

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.867
an effective one.

00:34:05.867 --> 00:34:12.667
But after that, all of his
good qualities amount to

00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:16.700
treating the Church well and
treating the poor well, and

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.600
the Church is supposed
to represent.

00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:26.500
So in the remainder of the time,
we should consider, what

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.433
is the Church?

00:34:27.433 --> 00:34:29.500
What do we mean by the Church?

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.767
Any questions so far?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.367
The Church in this society is
represented by bishops and

00:34:39.367 --> 00:34:40.167
monasteries.

00:34:40.167 --> 00:34:43.800
We will be talking about
monasteries next week.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.300
The difference is that bishops
rule from the cities even if

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.533
they are just a little shell
remnants of Roman cities.

00:34:51.533 --> 00:34:55.167
Nevertheless, they rule from
a population center.

00:34:55.167 --> 00:34:58.967
They are involved with ordinary
people, or at least

00:34:58.967 --> 00:35:05.267
their administrative apparatus
deals with regular life.

00:35:05.267 --> 00:35:09.500
Monasteries are more a retreat
from regular life, where

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.533
monks, as you'll read in the
Rule of Saint Benedict, live

00:35:12.533 --> 00:35:15.533
in a kind of isolated
community,

00:35:15.533 --> 00:35:18.633
renouncing the world.

00:35:18.633 --> 00:35:22.467
Now, in actual practice, there
would be more similarities

00:35:22.467 --> 00:35:26.267
than differences, particularly
as these monasteries were

00:35:26.267 --> 00:35:29.900
involved with the world
quite a lot.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.900
But it is the bishops that
represent, to the extent that

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.167
any aspect of society does, a
continuation of the Roman

00:35:38.167 --> 00:35:44.900
order, a continuation of the
notion that there is a kind of

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.100
educated ruler of
local society.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.067
So the bishops are members
of prominent families.

00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:54.333
They're often members of
Roman prominent family.

00:35:54.333 --> 00:35:59.367
Remember that Gregory
was Bishop of Tours?

00:35:59.367 --> 00:36:03.767
The great relic of Tours was
the cape of Saint Martin.

00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:10.600
His family had been bishops
of Tours because they were

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.567
locally prominent under the
Roman Empire, and continued

00:36:13.567 --> 00:36:16.167
this prominence under
the Merovingians.

00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:18.233
Not necessarily peacefully
or easily.

00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:23.133
As I said, Chilperic tried to
have him deposed, and you've

00:36:23.133 --> 00:36:26.333
seen the episode in which they
don't get along very well.

00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:30.267
But nevertheless, his family,
of what he calls senatorial

00:36:30.267 --> 00:36:34.167
rank, even though there's no
Senate anymore, were locally

00:36:34.167 --> 00:36:35.600
quite prominent.

00:36:39.167 --> 00:36:42.333
This relic that they guard
is not the only

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:44.167
reason for their power.

00:36:44.167 --> 00:36:48.800
But bishops, as well as monks,
are associated with some kind

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.567
of saint protector.

00:36:50.567 --> 00:36:54.767
And the saint protects
churches that have

00:36:54.767 --> 00:36:56.167
relics of the saint.

00:36:56.167 --> 00:37:04.900
A relic could be a bone, like
an arm or a jaw, or it could

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.200
be a piece of clothing
associated with the saint.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.400
In the case of Saint Martin--

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.067
Saint Martin it was a military
figure, whose most famous act

00:37:13.067 --> 00:37:18.233
of piety was he was stopped by
a beggar while on horseback,

00:37:18.233 --> 00:37:24.100
and he split his cloak with a
sword, and gave part of it too

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.967
clothe this beggar.

00:37:26.967 --> 00:37:33.733
And this relic itself, the
cloak, or a cappa, was held by

00:37:33.733 --> 00:37:35.433
the church of Saint
Martin of Tours.

00:37:35.433 --> 00:37:39.667
And indeed, it is thought that
the word "chapel" comes from

00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:43.633
the word for "cape." It's sort
of a sacred space within a

00:37:43.633 --> 00:37:49.667
church where, in this era,
relics would have been kept.

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:53.667
We'll talk a lot about relics
and why they are powerful, but

00:37:53.667 --> 00:37:56.967
for now, I do want to talk
about the mobilization of

00:37:56.967 --> 00:37:58.833
sacred power.

00:37:58.833 --> 00:38:02.333
Because we don't have to ask
the question, well, did it

00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:03.100
really work?

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.067
Did this really happen?

00:38:05.067 --> 00:38:08.467
Did Saint Martin really revenge
himself on people who

00:38:08.467 --> 00:38:10.500
plundered lands belonging
to him?

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.000
The important thing is to
realize that the conception of

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.467
the saint is not merely that
of a pious respect, but of

00:38:18.467 --> 00:38:22.900
fear of a living presence.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.867
Somebody who, although dead,
is not dead in the normal

00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:32.267
understanding of the word
"dead." The bishops and monks

00:38:32.267 --> 00:38:36.933
mobilize a kind of locus
of sacred power.

00:38:40.567 --> 00:38:44.167
Now again, at 2 AM, after you
were done thinking that

00:38:44.167 --> 00:38:48.033
Gregory was a fool, it may have
occurred to you that this

00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:50.933
sounds a lot like
polytheism This

00:38:50.933 --> 00:38:53.833
seems to multiply deities.

00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:57.867
It seems to multiply the sites,
the places where the

00:38:57.867 --> 00:39:00.767
sacred has an effect.

00:39:00.767 --> 00:39:04.267
And shame on you for
such a thought.

00:39:04.267 --> 00:39:06.933
How can this be polygamous, just
because there seem to be

00:39:06.933 --> 00:39:09.667
a bunch of different people
wielding sacred power?

00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:16.200
We don't have to
deal with this.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.867
Certainly, there seem to be a
lot of people, most of them

00:39:19.867 --> 00:39:22.633
not alive, wielding
sacred power.

00:39:22.633 --> 00:39:25.200
And it's a rather threatening
kind of power, at that.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.667
The bishop is a religious
leader.

00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:38.333
Some of them are religious
leaders in the sense of

00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:43.333
powerfully religious forces,
but most of them are more

00:39:43.333 --> 00:39:46.800
squires than preachers.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:53.400
That is, they are landowners,
patrons, more or less generous

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.933
to the poor or to the people
of the area that they rule.

00:39:59.933 --> 00:40:03.333
It's not a religion of
deep introspection.

00:40:03.333 --> 00:40:05.967
We don't have a lot of
mystical thinkers

00:40:05.967 --> 00:40:08.133
in the sixth century.

00:40:08.133 --> 00:40:12.533
We don't have a whole lot of
ethical concern, except for

00:40:12.533 --> 00:40:18.800
the notion of the poor as a
collection of people with

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.133
certain rights to
the ear of God.

00:40:22.133 --> 00:40:25.833
The poor does not mean exactly
what it means now--

00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:29.667
the marginal, the people below
some kind of income level.

00:40:29.667 --> 00:40:34.900
It means basically ordinary
people without any particular

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.767
unusual power in society.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.467
In certain respects, the Church
is an aspect of the

00:40:45.467 --> 00:40:47.167
power of the king.

00:40:47.167 --> 00:40:50.033
In certain respects,
it defies the king.

00:40:50.033 --> 00:40:54.533
Gregory himself, and his work
is full of other examples of

00:40:54.533 --> 00:40:57.867
bishops who stand up
to the ruler and

00:40:57.867 --> 00:41:00.233
remonstrate with the ruler.

00:41:00.233 --> 00:41:02.067
That is, scold the ruler.

00:41:07.967 --> 00:41:12.733
But they can't really do
this by themselves.

00:41:12.733 --> 00:41:17.733
They have to mobilize at least
the potentiality of a kind of

00:41:17.733 --> 00:41:22.767
power that goes beyond merely
the prestige of their family

00:41:22.767 --> 00:41:25.500
or the prestige of
their office.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.867
So for example--

00:41:26.867 --> 00:41:28.333
and again, this is something
that's not

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:32.467
in the Murray addition--

00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:36.867
an example of the power
of Saint Martin.

00:41:36.867 --> 00:41:40.533
This is at a monastery, the
Monastery of Latte where some

00:41:40.533 --> 00:41:42.933
other relics of Saint
Martin are kept.

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:45.700
"A force of hostile troops
approached and prepared to

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.500
cross the river which runs by,
so that they might loot the

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.033
monastery of Latte." L-A-T-T-E.
Latte, but I think

00:41:55.033 --> 00:41:57.933
it's pronounced "lot."

00:41:57.933 --> 00:41:59.033
"'This is the monastery
of Saint

00:41:59.033 --> 00:42:01.067
Martin,' cried the monks.

00:42:01.067 --> 00:42:05.433
'You Franks must not cross over
here.' Most of those who

00:42:05.433 --> 00:42:07.467
heard this were filled with
the fear of God and so

00:42:07.467 --> 00:42:10.233
withdrew." Oh, uh, I
just thought it was

00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:11.533
a regular old monastery.

00:42:11.533 --> 00:42:13.800
Sorry.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.333
"Twenty of their number,
however, who did not fear God,

00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:20.800
had no respect for the blessed
saint, and they climbed into

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.733
the boat and crossed
the river.

00:42:23.733 --> 00:42:26.533
And driven on by the devil
himself, they slaughtered the

00:42:26.533 --> 00:42:32.100
monks, damaged the monastery,
and stole its possessions."

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:37.600
They made the, you know, gold
and silver chalices, all of

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.633
these properties that they had
taken, "into bundles, and

00:42:41.633 --> 00:42:43.200
piled on their boat.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.700
Then they pushed off
into the stream.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.267
But the keel began to sway to
and fro, and they were carried

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:51.033
round and round.

00:42:51.033 --> 00:42:53.800
They lost their oars, which
might have saved them.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.567
They tried to reach the bank by
pushing the butts of their

00:42:57.567 --> 00:42:59.433
spears into the bed
of the river, but

00:42:59.433 --> 00:43:01.300
the boat split apart.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.200
They were all pierced through
by the points

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.333
of their own lances.

00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:07.767
They were killed by their
own javelins.

00:43:07.767 --> 00:43:10.933
Only one of them remained
unhurt, a man who had rebuked

00:43:10.933 --> 00:43:13.433
the others for what
they were doing.

00:43:13.433 --> 00:43:17.100
If anyone thinks this happened
by chance, let them consider

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.733
the fact that one innocent man
was saved among so many who

00:43:20.733 --> 00:43:22.500
were doing evil.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.267
After their death, the surviving
monks retrieved the

00:43:25.267 --> 00:43:27.200
corpses from the bed
of the river.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.600
They buried the dead bodies
and replaced their own

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.633
possessions in

00:43:30.633 --> 00:43:32.333
their monastery." OK?

00:43:32.333 --> 00:43:35.733
So this is what happens
to people who plunder

00:43:35.733 --> 00:43:36.833
monasteries.

00:43:36.833 --> 00:43:40.300
On the one hand, the story is
useful for the fact that they

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.667
plunder monasteries anyway.

00:43:43.667 --> 00:43:45.700
And without asking the question,
did their boat

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.233
really sink?

00:43:48.233 --> 00:43:54.133
We can see a notion of the
violence of society being

00:43:54.133 --> 00:43:56.667
directed to illegitimate
ends, and then being

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:59.933
punished by the Church.

00:43:59.933 --> 00:44:03.100
In terms of the question that we
have been asking, what held

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.533
society together, a lot of the
answer has to be the church

00:44:07.533 --> 00:44:10.800
and its perceived mobilization
of spiritual power.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:18.600
It's not the only answer, but
it is an important aspect of

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.400
the cohesiveness of
a violent but not

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.567
completely unstable society.

00:44:27.567 --> 00:44:28.867
Let me give you one
more example.

00:44:34.967 --> 00:44:39.067
"Palladius inherited the office
of count in the region

00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:44.200
of Javols." J-A-V-O-L-S. A
quarrel ensued between him and

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:51.100
Bishop Parthenius, in which this
count insults the bishop,

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.200
abuses him, accuses them of
all sorts of crimes, and

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.367
seized the property of the
Church, which is, of course,

00:44:56.367 --> 00:44:58.500
what he really wanted to do.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.267
They both go to the
King's court.

00:45:00.267 --> 00:45:04.900
Palladius accused the bishop of
being weak and effeminate.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.633
"'Where are your darling boys,'
cried he, 'with whom

00:45:07.633 --> 00:45:11.033
you live in shame and
debauchery?' The vengeance of

00:45:11.033 --> 00:45:15.033
God soon brought an end to these
attacks." The following

00:45:15.033 --> 00:45:22.333
year, Palladius lost his
countship and became terrified

00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:27.633
that King Sigibert wanted him
killed, and eventually he

00:45:27.633 --> 00:45:28.867
commits suicide.

00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:34.100
"I find it hard to believe that
this horrible deed could

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.300
have been achieved without
the help of the devil.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.367
For the first would was enough
to kill him, unless the devil

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:41.400
came to his assistance to give
him strength to carry out his

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.900
terrible plan through
to the end.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.700
He stabbed himself twice.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:48.733
His mother rushed in, beside
herself with grief, fainted in

00:45:48.733 --> 00:45:49.800
front of her son.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.300
The whole family bewailed
his fate.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.367
He was buried at the monastery
of Cournon, but not in

00:45:55.367 --> 00:45:58.700
Christian ground, and no mass
was sung over him."

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.467
Moral of the story?

00:46:00.467 --> 00:46:01.733
And Gregory is great
at telling you the

00:46:01.733 --> 00:46:03.333
moral of the story.

00:46:03.333 --> 00:46:06.933
"It is clear that this fate
befell him only because he had

00:46:06.933 --> 00:46:10.600
wronged his bishop." OK?

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.333
Message of the book--

00:46:12.333 --> 00:46:17.200
don't mess around with
these bishops.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.567
This is a world in which
spiritual power is effectively

00:46:21.567 --> 00:46:24.867
mobilized to social cohesion.

00:46:27.433 --> 00:46:29.100
Gregory dies in 594.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:34.167
I just want cast an eye forward,
because we're going

00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:38.900
to pick the story up with the
successors to the Merovingian

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.400
dynasty, the Carolingians.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.533
Carolingians, retrospectively
named for their most famous

00:46:45.533 --> 00:46:47.133
member, Charlemagne--

00:46:47.133 --> 00:46:49.533
"Carolus" in Latin.

00:46:49.533 --> 00:46:53.833
The Merovingian-Carolingian
transition is in the middle of

00:46:53.833 --> 00:46:55.733
the eighth century.

00:46:55.733 --> 00:47:02.033
So this dynasty had another 150
years or so after Gregory,

00:47:02.033 --> 00:47:07.133
and they continued to be
involved in civil war.

00:47:07.133 --> 00:47:11.467
Eventually there was a terrible
feud between our

00:47:11.467 --> 00:47:17.200
friend Fredegunde, wife of
Chilperic, and Brunhild,

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.233
married to Sigibert.

00:47:19.233 --> 00:47:24.500
Brunhild was sister of the
murdered Galswinthe, whom

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.267
Fredegunde had basically
gotten murdered.

00:47:33.233 --> 00:47:36.433
So Brunhild tries to avenge
her murdered sister.

00:47:36.433 --> 00:47:38.033
Sigebert makes war
on Chilperic.

00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:46.633
Fredegunde hires assassins
to kill Sigebert.

00:47:46.633 --> 00:47:51.800
And you've seen that Brunhild
married the wayward son of

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:55.267
Chilperic named Merovech.

00:47:55.267 --> 00:47:58.200
Merovech eventually
commits suicide.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.633
Brunhild, eventually after
these guys pass from the

00:48:01.633 --> 00:48:07.167
scene, rules, and so
does Fredegunde.

00:48:07.167 --> 00:48:09.567
Chilperic is assassinated.

00:48:09.567 --> 00:48:12.300
Fredegunde rules in the
name of her son.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:19.900
And so, in fact, in the late
sixth century, the rulers are

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.967
these two powerful and
feuding women.

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:27.967
In 613, Chlothar the second,
son of Fredegunde and

00:48:27.967 --> 00:48:33.633
Chilperic, capture the aged
Queen Brunhild and had her

00:48:33.633 --> 00:48:35.067
torn apart by wild horses.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:42.267
What is happening here, behind
the unedifying drama of

00:48:42.267 --> 00:48:48.567
violence and feud within a
dysfunctional family--

00:48:48.567 --> 00:48:53.033
dysfunctional, a word unknown
in Merovingian Frankish, I'm

00:48:53.033 --> 00:48:54.733
pretty convinced--

00:48:54.733 --> 00:49:00.533
is that certain regions of the
Frankish realm are identified.

00:49:00.533 --> 00:49:04.633
If you look on the last of the
maps in the appendix to the

00:49:04.633 --> 00:49:08.167
Murray addition, you'll see
reference made to the two

00:49:08.167 --> 00:49:12.033
regions that don't really
correspond to today.

00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:18.600
One is Austrasia, which is a
kind of land that encompasses

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:24.033
the Rhine regions, Belgium, a
bit of Holland, Northeastern

00:49:24.033 --> 00:49:28.233
France, and Neustria, which is
more the heart of France.

00:49:28.233 --> 00:49:29.600
Paris, the Seine.

00:49:33.467 --> 00:49:37.067
These will become sort of two
subrealms of the Merovingian

00:49:37.067 --> 00:49:39.933
Frankish kingdom.

00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:43.333
And our people that we're going
to be following towards

00:49:43.333 --> 00:49:46.000
the end of the course, the
Carolingians, will be

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
associated with Austrasia.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.500
We turn to England
for Wednesday.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:57.333
If you still have your papers
and want to give them to us,

00:49:57.333 --> 00:49:58.233
please do so.

00:49:58.233 --> 00:49:59.467
I'll see you on Wednesday.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.300
Professor Steven Smith:
Okay, where are we?

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.755
Today, we're going to
study--I'm going to talk about

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:13.173
Aristotle's--you might call it
Aristotle's comparative politics

00:00:13.173 --> 00:00:16.930
and focusing on the idea of the
regime.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.271
This is the theme that you
remember in the opening day I

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:28.002
said was really the central
concept or the leading thread of

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:33.635
this course and it's in books
III through VI of Aristotle's

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:39.268
Politics that he develops
his idea of the regime and

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:43.885
regime politics.
Book I, that we spoke about

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:48.880
last time, really in a way tells
us something about the--you

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.960
might say almost the metaphysics
of Aristotle's politics.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.558
Today Aristotle speaks more
empirically, more politically

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:06.375
about what a regime is.
His idea of regime

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.227
politea,
again, the same word,

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:13.267
the same word that was used for
the title of Plato's

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:17.070
Republic is the
centerpiece of Aristotle's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.610
politics literally.
It occupies the theme of the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.330
middle three books,
books III through VI.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.680
These books are difficult in
many ways;

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.326
they're complicated.
They're not everybody's

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:35.071
favorite part of the book,
but they are my favorite part

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:38.885
because it tells us more
precisely than anywhere else how

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:43.107
Aristotle understands the nature
of politics and that after all

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:45.900
is what we are most interested
in.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.898
A regime refers to both the
formal enumeration of rights and

00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:56.030
duties within a community,
but it also addresses something

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.639
closer to what we would call the
way of life or the culture of a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.900
people.
Their distinctive customs,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.913
manners, laws,
habits, moral dispositions and

00:02:08.913 --> 00:02:12.928
sentiments,
and Aristotle's constitutional

00:02:12.928 --> 00:02:17.220
theorizing begins by asking a
simple question.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.750
What is the identity of a city?
What gives it its identity and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.310
enduring existence over time?
His answer is the regime;

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.810
the regime is what gives a
people and a city its identity.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.330
Aristotle distinguishes between
what he calls the matter and the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.977
form of the regime.
Let me examine both of these in

00:02:47.977 --> 00:02:51.004
turn.
The matter, the substance,

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:56.770
the material basis of a regime
concerns its citizen body.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.971
That is to say the character of
those who constitute a city and

00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:05.999
here he rejects a number of
alternatives for what

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:10.775
constitutes a citizen body.
He rejects the idea that the

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.127
city is defined simply by a
group of people who inhabit a

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:18.780
common territory,
the same space as it were.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.158
The identity of a polis
he writes is not constituted by

00:03:23.158 --> 00:03:25.273
its walls.
That is to say,

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:28.616
it is not constituted by
geography alone,

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:31.960
and similarly,
he rejects the idea that a

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.556
regime can be understood as a
defensive alliance against

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:39.865
invasion by others.
In our terms,

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:43.273
for example,
NATO would not be a regime,

00:03:43.273 --> 00:03:47.030
a purely military or defensive
alliance.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.950
Finally, he denies the
possibility that a regime exists

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.160
that whenever a number of people
come together to establish

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.210
commercial relations with one
another,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.563
organizations like NAFTA,
or the WTO, the World Trade

00:04:03.563 --> 00:04:07.270
Organization do not a regime
make.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:14.160
A regime cannot be understood
simply as a commercial alliance.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.926
What is a regime then?
It is evident Aristotle said,

00:04:16.926 --> 00:04:20.429
is that a city is not a
partnership in a location or for

00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:24.250
the sake of not committing
injustice against one another,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.180
or for transacting business,
so what is a citizen body?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.941
The citizens who constitute a
regime, he tells us,

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:41.870
do more than occupy the common
space but are held together,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.199
according to Aristotle,
by bonds of common affection.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.624
It is affection,
loyalty and friendship that

00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:56.687
make up a regime.
This sort of thing he says,

00:04:56.687 --> 00:05:00.667
this political partnership is
the work of affection,

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:04.959
philia is his word,
is the work of affection.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.340
"Affection is the intentional
choice of living together."

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.591
1280a, if anyone's interested.
"It is the intentional choice

00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:17.213
of living together."
Friendship, he writes,

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:21.547
"is the greatest of good things
for cities, for when people feel

00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:25.468
affection for each other they
are less likely to fall into

00:05:25.468 --> 00:05:29.081
conflict."
But what kind of friendship is

00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:33.193
he talking about?
Is it the kind of friendship

00:05:33.193 --> 00:05:38.411
that you feel for your best
friend, or for your parents or

00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:41.657
siblings?
What kind of a friendship are

00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:45.435
these bonds of affection,
that he says hold the city

00:05:45.435 --> 00:05:48.250
together and that make it a
regime?

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.308
Political friendships,
he tells us,

00:05:56.308 --> 00:06:01.185
are not the kind of thing that
require us to forego our own

00:06:01.185 --> 00:06:05.557
individual identities in a way
that one might find in

00:06:05.557 --> 00:06:10.699
passionate relations of love,
right?

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.866
Rather, they presuppose
relations, that is to say

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:17.230
political relations,
not between lovers or even best

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.443
friends of some kind,
but between civic partners who

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:26.058
may in fact be intensely
rivalrous and competitive with

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:31.100
one another for positions of
political office and honor.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.626
Civic friendship,
civic philia is in other

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:38.888
words not without a strong
element of what might be thought

00:06:38.888 --> 00:06:43.223
of as sibling rivalry in which
each citizen strives to outdo

00:06:43.223 --> 00:06:46.750
the others for the sake of the
civic good.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.488
Many of you have siblings and
know a little bit about what

00:06:51.488 --> 00:06:55.624
sibling rivalry is like.
Siblings, as everyone knows,

00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:59.292
may be the best of friends,
but this does not exclude

00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:04.801
strong elements of competition,
rivalry, and even conflict for

00:07:04.801 --> 00:07:10.089
the attention of the parents,
and fellow citizens,

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:12.009
for Aristotle,
are like siblings,

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.949
each competing with one another
for the esteem,

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:18.820
the affection,
and the recognition of the city

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.379
that serves for them as a kind
of surrogate parent.

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:27.130
That is the way that Aristotle
understands a civic body,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.472
a citizen body.
So that when he says that

00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:35.359
citizens are held together by
ties of common affection he

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:40.800
means something very specific.
The civic bond is more than an

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.005
aggregate of mere self-interest
or rational calculation as was

00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:51.382
going to be defended by someone
like Thomas Hobbes or by most of

00:07:51.382 --> 00:07:56.161
today's modern economists who
believe that society can be

00:07:56.161 --> 00:08:01.367
understood simply as a series of
rational transactions between

00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:06.487
buyers and sellers of different
goods and that can be modeled

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:10.839
along some kind of game
theoretic lines.

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:13.589
Aristotle denies this,
explicitly denies this.

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:17.472
He seems to have known
something about the modern

00:08:17.472 --> 00:08:22.567
economic theory of society long
before modern economics was even

00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:25.662
developed.
But again, when Aristotle

00:08:25.662 --> 00:08:30.058
speaks of the kinds of affection
that hold a citizen body

00:08:30.058 --> 00:08:33.360
together,
he does not mean anything like

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.689
the bonds of personal intimacy
that characterize private

00:08:37.689 --> 00:08:40.075
friendships.
What he means,

00:08:40.075 --> 00:08:44.552
when speaking about civic
affection, is more like the

00:08:44.552 --> 00:08:48.598
bonds of loyalty,
camaraderie that hold together

00:08:48.598 --> 00:08:53.352
members of a team or a club.
These are more than,

00:08:53.352 --> 00:08:56.700
again, ties of mutual
convenience.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.344
They require loyalty,
trust, what social scientists

00:09:01.344 --> 00:09:06.082
today sometimes call social
capital, that successful

00:09:06.082 --> 00:09:09.519
societies require social
capital.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:14.067
A distinguished political
scientist at another university,

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:16.860
I will not mention its name
here,

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.432
at another university,
has spoken about the importance

00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:26.350
of social capital or trust as a
sort of basic relation,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.889
the basic component of a
healthy democracy.

00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:34.828
Aristotle knew that,
he didn't use a kind of ugly

00:09:34.828 --> 00:09:38.519
social scientific word like
social capital;

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.899
rather he spoke about civic
friendship and philia.

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:47.412
The political partnership he
says must therefore be regarded

00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:51.848
as being for the sake of noble
actions and not just for the

00:09:51.848 --> 00:09:56.579
sake of living together.
The city, as he likes to say or

00:09:56.579 --> 00:10:01.926
the regime exists not merely for
the sake of life but for what he

00:10:01.926 --> 00:10:07.235
understands to be the good life,
the life of friendship,

00:10:07.235 --> 00:10:11.696
the life of again,
competitive relations for

00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:17.403
positions of honor and office.
So we can say that a regime is

00:10:17.403 --> 00:10:21.590
in the first instance
constituted by its citizen body.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.830
Citizens are those who share a
common way of life.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.553
The citizen in an unqualified
sense, Aristotle writes,

00:10:29.553 --> 00:10:35.079
is defined by no other thing so
much as sharing in decision and

00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:38.220
office.
Or, as he puts it a little bit

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.038
later, whoever is entitled to
participate in an office

00:10:42.038 --> 00:10:46.071
involving deliberation or
decision-making is a citizen of

00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:49.025
the city.
Listen to the words he uses

00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:53.537
there in describing a citizen.
A citizen is one who takes

00:10:53.537 --> 00:10:57.916
sharing in decision and office,
who participates in

00:10:57.916 --> 00:11:01.070
deliberation and
decision-making.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.309
A citizen is one therefore who
not only enjoys the protection

00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:09.549
of the law, is not merely you
might say a passive beneficiary

00:11:09.549 --> 00:11:12.799
of the protection of society and
its laws,

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:17.346
but is one who takes a share in
shaping the laws and who

00:11:17.346 --> 00:11:21.480
participates in political rule
and deliberation.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.441
Aristotle even notes,
you probably observe,

00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:27.049
that his definition of the
citizen,

00:11:27.049 --> 00:11:31.030
he says, is most appropriate to
citizens of democracy,

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.612
where in his famous formulation
everyone knows how to rule and

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:39.575
be ruled in turn.
It is this reflection and the

00:11:39.575 --> 00:11:44.510
character of the citizen that
leads him to wonder whether the

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:49.610
good citizen and the good human
being are one and the same.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.091
Can a person be both,
as it were, a good man,

00:11:53.091 --> 00:11:55.860
a good person and a good
citizen?

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.159
Famous discussion in
Aristotle's book;

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:10.799
Aristotle's answer to this is
perhaps deliberately obscure.

00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:14.739
The good citizen,
he tells, us is still relative

00:12:14.739 --> 00:12:17.060
to the regime.
That is to say,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.591
the good citizen of the
democracy would not necessarily

00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:23.736
be the same person,
or the same kind of person as

00:12:23.736 --> 00:12:26.679
the good citizen of a monarchy
or an aristocracy.

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:30.352
Citizen virtue is relative,
or we might say,

00:12:30.352 --> 00:12:33.495
regime relative.
Only in the best regime,

00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:37.574
he says, will the good citizen
and the good human being be the

00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:41.009
same.
But what is the best regime?

00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:45.610
At least at this point he has
not told us.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.222
The point he's trying to make
is there are several kinds of

00:12:49.222 --> 00:12:53.022
regimes and therefore several
kinds of citizenship appropriate

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.994
to them.
Each regime is constituted by

00:12:55.994 --> 00:13:00.212
its matter, that is to say,
by its citizen body as we've

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:04.306
been talking about,
but also now by its form,

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:09.101
by its formal structures.
That is to say every regime

00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:12.835
will also be a set of
institutions and formal

00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:16.740
structures that give shape to
its citizens.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.437
Regimes or constitutions you
might say are forms,

00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:26.526
or formalities that determine
how power is shared and

00:13:26.526 --> 00:13:32.765
distributed among citizens.
Every regime is an answer,

00:13:32.765 --> 00:13:37.944
consciously or not,
to the oldest political

00:13:37.944 --> 00:13:41.890
question of all,
who governs?

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.769
Who should govern?
Every regime is an answer to

00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:51.208
that question because every
regime sets forward a way of

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:54.710
distributing,
formally distributing powers

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.580
and distributing offices among
its citizen body.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.463
So we move now from the matter
of the regime,

00:14:01.463 --> 00:14:05.330
as to what constitutes its
citizens and its citizen body,

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.436
to the question of the form of
the regime, its forms,

00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:13.148
its formalities,
its structures and institutions

00:14:13.148 --> 00:14:17.017
you might say.
Entirely too much of modern

00:14:17.017 --> 00:14:22.726
political science is focused on
simply the forms and formalities

00:14:22.726 --> 00:14:26.460
of political life,
not enough, in my opinion,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.049
with questions of the citizen
body and what makes,

00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:33.328
what constitutes,
the character or the virtue in

00:14:33.328 --> 00:14:35.840
Aristotle's terms of its
citizens.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.895
But nevertheless,
Aristotle gives extraordinary

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:42.947
importance and attention to the
forms or formalities that make

00:14:42.947 --> 00:14:45.440
up a regime.
What does he mean by that?

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.200
Aristotle defines the strictly
formal criteria of a

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.513
politea twice in his
politics and I'm sure you noted

00:14:58.513 --> 00:15:04.480
both times where they appeared?
Yes.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.770
Book III, chapter 6,
famous definition:

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.099
"The regime," he says,
"is an arrangement of a city

00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:16.979
with respect to its offices,
particularly the one who has

00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:21.221
the authority over all matters.
For what has authority in the

00:15:21.221 --> 00:15:23.620
city is everywhere that
governing body,

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.210
and the governing body is the
regime."

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.756
The regime is an arrangement of
a city, he says,

00:15:32.756 --> 00:15:36.679
with respect to its offices and
every city will have a governing

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:39.137
body,
that governing body being a

00:15:39.137 --> 00:15:42.793
regime.
The second definition appears

00:15:42.793 --> 00:15:47.059
at the beginning of Book IV,
chapter 1.

00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:50.539
"For a regime," he writes,
"is an arrangement in cities

00:15:50.539 --> 00:15:53.946
connected with offices,
establishing the manner in

00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:56.778
which they have been
distributed, what the

00:15:56.778 --> 00:15:59.679
authoritative element of the
regime is,

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:05.070
and what the end of the
partnership is in each case,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:10.355
a similar but slightly
different definition of what

00:16:10.355 --> 00:16:16.379
constitutes the formal structure
of regime politics."

00:16:16.379 --> 00:16:21.093
But from these two definitions
appearing in book III,

00:16:21.093 --> 00:16:25.806
chapter 6 and Book IV,
chapter 1 we learn a number of

00:16:25.806 --> 00:16:29.328
important things.
First, is to repeat,

00:16:29.328 --> 00:16:33.861
a regime concerns the manner in
which power is divided or

00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:38.357
distributed in a community.
This is what Aristotle means

00:16:38.357 --> 00:16:42.345
when he uses the phrase,
"an arrangement of a city with

00:16:42.345 --> 00:16:45.324
respect to its offices."
In other words,

00:16:45.324 --> 00:16:49.064
every regime will be based on
some kind of judgment of how

00:16:49.064 --> 00:16:51.820
power should be distributed to
the one,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:57.570
to the few or the many to use
the Aristotelian categories of

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:03.125
political rule or some mixture
of those three classes that

00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:07.617
constitute every city.
In every regime one of these

00:17:07.617 --> 00:17:10.622
groups, he says,
will be the dominant class,

00:17:10.622 --> 00:17:13.873
will be the dominant body,
the ruling body,

00:17:13.873 --> 00:17:18.308
as he says, in that definition
and that ruling body will in

00:17:18.308 --> 00:17:20.426
turn,
he says, define the nature of

00:17:20.426 --> 00:17:21.050
the regime.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.670
But Aristotle tells us
something more than this.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.947
A regime, his regime typology
is, to say, his division of

00:17:34.947 --> 00:17:39.529
power, his division of regimes
and to the rule of the one,

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:46.200
the few and the many is based
not only on how powers are

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.809
distributed in a purely factual
way,

00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:55.396
he also distinguishes between
regimes that are well ordered,

00:17:55.396 --> 00:18:02.650
well governed,
and those that are corrupt.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.609
What does he mean in terms of
this distinction?

00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:10.425
Aristotle's distinction seems
to be not only empirical,

00:18:10.425 --> 00:18:14.170
again, based on the factual
distribution of powers.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.401
It seems to have a--what we
might call today a normative

00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:19.927
component to it,
it makes a distinction or a

00:18:19.927 --> 00:18:22.747
judgment between the
well-ordered and the deviant

00:18:22.747 --> 00:18:25.480
regimes,
the corrupt regimes.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.722
On the one side,
he tells us,

00:18:27.722 --> 00:18:32.368
the well ordered regimes are
monarchy, aristocracy and what

00:18:32.368 --> 00:18:35.119
he calls polity,
rule of the one,

00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:38.568
the few, and the many,
and on the corrupt side he

00:18:38.568 --> 00:18:41.369
calls, he describes them as
tyranny,

00:18:41.369 --> 00:18:44.304
oligarchy and democracy also
ruled by the one,

00:18:44.304 --> 00:18:47.344
the few, and the many.
But what criteria,

00:18:47.344 --> 00:18:50.785
we want to know,
does he use to distinguish

00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:53.570
between these,
as it were, six-fold

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.364
classification of regimes?
How does he distinguish the

00:18:58.364 --> 00:19:02.289
well-ordered regimes from the
corrupt regimes?

00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:06.465
Here is where Aristotle's
analysis gets,

00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:10.961
in some ways,
maddeningly tricky because in

00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:15.187
many ways,
of his general reluctance,

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:18.859
to condemn any regime out of
hand.

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:24.045
If you were to read more than I
had assigned for you in class,

00:19:24.045 --> 00:19:29.233
if you were to read throughout,
through all of Book VI for

00:19:29.233 --> 00:19:34.275
example, you would find
Aristotle not only giving advice

00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:40.143
to Democrats and democracies and
other regimes on how to preserve

00:19:40.143 --> 00:19:44.154
themselves,
you would find a lengthy

00:19:44.154 --> 00:19:48.605
description of how tyrants
should moderate,

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:54.117
or how tyrants learn to
preserve and defend their own

00:19:54.117 --> 00:19:56.691
regime.
It seems as if,

00:19:56.691 --> 00:20:01.115
it seems almost as if,
living before the incarnation

00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:06.321
of pure evil in the twentieth
century with the rise of modern

00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:10.463
totalitarianisms,
that Aristotle seemed to think

00:20:10.463 --> 00:20:14.333
that no regime was so bad,
no regime was so devoid of

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:18.576
goodness that its preservation
was not worth at least some

00:20:18.576 --> 00:20:20.880
effort,
think of that.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.206
Rather, in many ways,
he provides reasoned arguments

00:20:25.206 --> 00:20:30.211
for the strengths and weaknesses
of several different regime

00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:32.944
types.
Let's consider the one that's

00:20:32.944 --> 00:20:36.130
closest to our own,
democracy, let's consider what

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.120
Aristotle has to tell us about
that regime.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.913
In fact, it would be an
interesting question for people

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:52.796
to consider, to know how would
Aristotle confront or what would

00:20:52.796 --> 00:20:57.049
his analysis be if a regime like
Hitler's Germany,

00:20:57.049 --> 00:21:01.725
Stalin's Russia,
the Iran of Khomeini,

00:21:01.725 --> 00:21:08.423
regimes that are clearly
tyrannies but do they even go

00:21:08.423 --> 00:21:12.942
beyond in some way,
the tyrannies that Aristotle

00:21:12.942 --> 00:21:16.223
spoke about and what kind of
advice, what would he have to

00:21:16.223 --> 00:21:18.487
say about them?
Anyway let's think about

00:21:18.487 --> 00:21:19.050
democracy.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.181
Interestingly,
we find Aristotle defending

00:21:26.181 --> 00:21:32.427
democracy on the grounds that it
may contain collectively greater

00:21:32.427 --> 00:21:37.599
wisdom than a regime ruled by
the one or the few.

00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:40.470
In Book III,
chapter 11, for example,

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.740
he writes, "For because they
are many,"

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.999
that is to say the citizen
body, the ruling body of the

00:21:46.999 --> 00:21:50.680
democracy, "each can have a part
of virtue and prudence and on

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.279
their uniting together,
and on their joining together

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:58.490
he says, "the multitude with its
many feet and hands and having

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.831
many senses becomes,"
he writes, "like a single human

00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:07.730
being, and so also with respect
to character and mind."

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.057
Think of that,
the people in a democracy he

00:22:10.057 --> 00:22:12.440
says, "coming together,
uniting together,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.879
become like a single human
being with many hands and feet,"

00:22:16.879 --> 00:22:20.630
and he says, "with greater
character and mind."

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.823
We even hear more than any
single individual,

00:22:23.823 --> 00:22:28.032
and then, in the same text,
we also hear Aristotle praising

00:22:28.032 --> 00:22:32.267
the practice of ostracism,
that is to say exiling,

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:37.456
banishing those individuals
deemed to be pre-eminent in any

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:42.795
particular virtue or quality.
He makes a similar point in

00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:47.288
Book III, chapter 15,
in describing the process of

00:22:47.288 --> 00:22:52.514
democratic deliberation as a
superior means of arriving at

00:22:52.514 --> 00:22:56.412
decisions.
He compares it to a potluck

00:22:56.412 --> 00:22:58.082
dinner;
any one of them,

00:22:58.082 --> 00:23:00.793
he says, that is to say any one
of the citizens,

00:23:00.793 --> 00:23:03.793
taken singly is perhaps
inferior in comparison to the

00:23:03.793 --> 00:23:06.914
best.
But the city is made up of many

00:23:06.914 --> 00:23:11.839
persons, just as a feast to
which many contribute is finer,

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:16.094
is better, than a single and
simple one and on this account a

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:20.420
crowd also judges many matters
better than a single person.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.343
Furthermore,
what is many,

00:23:22.343 --> 00:23:26.959
he says, is more incorruptible
like a greater amount of water

00:23:26.959 --> 00:23:30.730
than many is more incorruptible
than the few.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.771
So he gives there a powerful
argument in defense of

00:23:34.771 --> 00:23:37.599
democracy, like a potluck
dinner;

00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:42.333
each individual cook may not be
as good as the best chef but

00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:47.307
many taken together will provide
many more dishes and many more

00:23:47.307 --> 00:23:50.492
variety,
for a variety of tastes than

00:23:50.492 --> 00:23:52.080
does a single chef.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.938
He says, furthermore,
a crowd, the many,

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:03.230
is more incorruptible than the
few.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.584
Less light incorruptible,
here, I take it in a kind of

00:24:06.584 --> 00:24:10.228
ordinary sense of the term,
less susceptible to bribery,

00:24:10.228 --> 00:24:14.296
you can't bribe a lot of people
in the way that you can a single

00:24:14.296 --> 00:24:17.157
individual.
Are Aristotle's views on

00:24:17.157 --> 00:24:20.420
democracy correct here in his
analysis?

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:26.775
Do in fact many chefs make for
a better dinner than a single

00:24:26.775 --> 00:24:29.084
chef?
Well, I don't know,

00:24:29.084 --> 00:24:34.319
would you rather have dinner at
the Union League with one chef,

00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:38.493
a master chef or would you
rather have dinner with a bunch

00:24:38.493 --> 00:24:42.740
of your friends each providing
some piece of the dinner?

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:46.680
Well, it's an interesting
argument;

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.657
it's open to debate anyway.
Yet at the same time,

00:24:50.657 --> 00:24:56.120
is Aristotle seen defending
democracy, providing reason and

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.829
many sensible arguments for
democratic regimes?

00:25:00.829 --> 00:25:03.870
You find him,
in the same section of the

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.236
book, providing a defense of
kingship and the rule of the

00:25:08.236 --> 00:25:09.954
one.
In Book III,

00:25:09.954 --> 00:25:15.426
chapter 16, he considers the
case of the king who acts in all

00:25:15.426 --> 00:25:18.710
things according to his own
will.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.809
Sounds like a kind of absolute
monarch of some kind;

00:25:21.809 --> 00:25:26.383
this is the part of Aristotle's
politics that seems closest in a

00:25:26.383 --> 00:25:29.940
way to the idea of a platonic
philosopher-king,

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.686
a king who rules without law
and rules for the good of all,

00:25:34.686 --> 00:25:38.369
simply on the basis of his own
superiority.

00:25:38.369 --> 00:25:42.050
Aristotle coins a term for this
kind of king overall,

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.670
he calls it the
pambasileia,

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:50.256
baseleia being the Greek
word for king,

00:25:50.256 --> 00:25:56.216
like the name Basil,
it's the Greek word for king

00:25:56.216 --> 00:26:00.809
and pan meaning
universal,

00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:03.578
pambasileia,
the universal king,

00:26:03.578 --> 00:26:07.504
the king of all.
Aristotle does not rule out the

00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:11.890
possibility of such a person
emerging, a person of,

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:17.625
what he calls excessive virtue,
almost hyperbolic excellence,

00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:23.075
he says, who stands so far
above the rest as to deserve to

00:26:23.075 --> 00:26:27.702
be the natural ruler overall.
But how, we want to know,

00:26:27.702 --> 00:26:30.470
does Aristotle reconcile his
account of the term

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.890
baseleia,
the king of overall,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.595
with his earlier emphasis upon
democratic deliberation and

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:39.065
shared rule,
the citizen,

00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:46.789
recall, is one who takes turn
ruling and being ruled in turn.

00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:50.289
When readers look at
Aristotle's account of kingship

00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:54.200
and particularly this notion of
the pambasileia,

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.499
the king overall,
this suggestion must at least

00:26:58.499 --> 00:27:04.106
occur that there is a hidden
Alexandrian or Macedonian streak

00:27:04.106 --> 00:27:09.153
to Aristotle's political
thinking that owes more to his

00:27:09.153 --> 00:27:13.640
native Macedon than to his
adopted Athens,

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:19.239
the idea of universal kingship.
Think of Alexander the Great

00:27:19.239 --> 00:27:22.654
later on, and in fact,
in one of my favorite passages

00:27:22.654 --> 00:27:26.483
in the book,
which you will read for next

00:27:26.483 --> 00:27:32.880
time, I cannot resist quoting
already a passage from Book VII,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.217
and near the end of the book,
Book VII, chapter 7,

00:27:36.217 --> 00:27:38.670
where Aristotle writes as
follows.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:44.975
He writes, "The nations in cold
locations, particularly in

00:27:44.975 --> 00:27:49.400
Europe, are filled with
spiritedness."

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.087
There is that platonic word
again, thumos, are filled

00:27:53.087 --> 00:27:56.003
with thumos,
 "but lacking in discursive

00:27:56.003 --> 00:27:59.171
thought," lacking in the
deliberative element in other

00:27:59.171 --> 00:28:02.014
words.
Hence, they remain free because

00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:04.989
they're thumotic,
but they lack political

00:28:04.989 --> 00:28:07.175
governance.
"Those in Asia,

00:28:07.175 --> 00:28:11.376
on the other hand," he writes,
thinking probably here of

00:28:11.376 --> 00:28:14.837
Persia,
places like Egypt and Persia,

00:28:14.837 --> 00:28:19.581
"have souls endowed with
discursive thought but lack

00:28:19.581 --> 00:28:22.576
spiritedness,
lack thumos,

00:28:22.576 --> 00:28:25.670
hence they remain ruled and
enslaved."

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:30.042
But then he goes on to say,
"The stock of Greeks share in

00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:34.414
both, just as it holds," he
says, "the middle in terms of

00:28:34.414 --> 00:28:36.993
location.
For it," that is to say the

00:28:36.993 --> 00:28:40.177
Greeks, "are both spirited,
are both thumotic and

00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:42.319
endowed with deliberative
thought,

00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:46.508
and hence, remained free and
governed itself in the best

00:28:46.508 --> 00:28:49.249
manner."
"And," he writes and he

00:28:49.249 --> 00:28:54.586
concludes, "at the same time is
capable of ruling all should it

00:28:54.586 --> 00:28:59.325
obtain a single regime."
That these Greeks are capable

00:28:59.325 --> 00:29:01.574
of ruling all,
he says, all,

00:29:01.574 --> 00:29:04.559
who is all?
What does he mean by the all

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:05.920
here?
The Greeks?

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.901
The rest of the world?
Should our--are capable of

00:29:10.901 --> 00:29:16.244
attaining it seems a single
hegemony, a single regime,

00:29:16.244 --> 00:29:20.579
are if in fact,
circumstances developed.

00:29:20.579 --> 00:29:25.080
So here is a passage in which
Aristotle clearly seems to be

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.046
pointing to the possibility of a
kind of universal monarchy under

00:29:30.046 --> 00:29:35.460
Greek rule,
at least as a possibility.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:41.483
This passage I read at length,
is important for a number of

00:29:41.483 --> 00:29:45.430
reasons, let me just try to
explain.

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:53.057
In the first place,
it provides us with crucial

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:57.671
information about Aristotle's
thinking about the relations of

00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:01.601
impulse and reason,
of thumos and reason,

00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:05.462
as you might say the
determinants of human behavior

00:30:05.462 --> 00:30:09.400
or the crucial pet term in that
passage is this,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.142
again this platonic term
spiritedness which is both a

00:30:14.142 --> 00:30:19.158
cause of the human desire to
rule and at the same time a

00:30:19.158 --> 00:30:24.539
cause of our desire to resist
the domination of others.

00:30:24.539 --> 00:30:28.415
It is the unique source of
human assertiveness and

00:30:28.415 --> 00:30:31.499
aggressiveness,
as well as the source of

00:30:31.499 --> 00:30:34.900
resistance to the aggression of
others.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.043
It's a very important
psychological concept in

00:30:38.043 --> 00:30:42.506
understanding politics.
And second, the passage tells

00:30:42.506 --> 00:30:46.910
us something about certain
additional factors.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:51.804
Extra, in many ways,
extra-political factors such as

00:30:51.804 --> 00:30:57.178
climate and geography as
components in the development of

00:30:57.178 --> 00:31:01.323
political society.
Apparently, quality such as

00:31:01.323 --> 00:31:05.540
thumos and reason,
thumos and deliberation,

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.079
are not distributed equally and
universally.

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:12.656
He says, he distinguishes,
between the people's of the

00:31:12.656 --> 00:31:16.435
north, he calls them the
Europeans, spirited and war-like

00:31:16.435 --> 00:31:20.997
but lacking thumos;
those of Persia and Egypt

00:31:20.997 --> 00:31:27.190
containing highly developed
forms of intellectual knowledge,

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.277
no doubt thinking about the
development of things like

00:31:30.277 --> 00:31:33.714
science and mathematics in Egypt
but lacking this quality of

00:31:33.714 --> 00:31:37.210
thumos which is so
important for self-government,

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.300
for self-rule.
These are, one might think

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.746
about this, these things,
he says, are at least in part

00:31:44.746 --> 00:31:49.274
determined by certain kinds of
natural or geographic and

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:54.349
climatic qualities.
A modern reader of this passage

00:31:54.349 --> 00:31:59.849
that comes to mind is
Montesquieu, in his famous book,

00:31:59.849 --> 00:32:02.604
the Spirit of the Laws,
with its emphasis upon the way

00:32:02.604 --> 00:32:07.053
in which geography and climate,
and environment become in part

00:32:07.053 --> 00:32:12.725
determinants of the kind of
political culture and political

00:32:12.725 --> 00:32:16.930
behavior exhibited by different
peoples.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.951
Finally, this passage tells us
that under the right

00:32:19.951 --> 00:32:22.670
circumstances,
at least Aristotle suggests,

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:27.738
the Greeks could exercise a
kind of universal rule,

00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:31.419
if they chose.
He does not rule out this

00:32:31.419 --> 00:32:34.641
possibility.
Perhaps it testifies to his

00:32:34.641 --> 00:32:39.184
view that there are different
kinds of regimes that may be

00:32:39.184 --> 00:32:43.010
appropriate to different kinds
of situations,

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.876
to different situations.
There is no one-size-fits-all

00:32:46.876 --> 00:32:51.673
model of political life,
but good regimes may come in a

00:32:51.673 --> 00:32:55.328
variety of forms.
There seems to be at least

00:32:55.328 --> 00:32:59.156
built in to Aristotle's account
of politics, a certain

00:32:59.156 --> 00:33:02.447
flexibility,
a certain latitude of

00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:08.963
discretion that in some passages
even seems to border on a kind

00:33:08.963 --> 00:33:12.007
of relativism.
But nevertheless,

00:33:12.007 --> 00:33:16.446
Aristotle understands that a
person, this pambasileia,

00:33:16.446 --> 00:33:20.294
this person of superlative
virtue is not really to be

00:33:20.294 --> 00:33:23.882
expected.
Politics is really a matter of

00:33:23.882 --> 00:33:28.732
dealing with less than best
circumstances which is perhaps

00:33:28.732 --> 00:33:33.836
one reason why Aristotle gives
relatively little attention to

00:33:33.836 --> 00:33:37.069
the structure of the best
regime.

00:33:37.069 --> 00:33:39.791
Such a regime,
which I do want to talk about

00:33:39.791 --> 00:33:42.450
Wednesday is something to be
wished for,

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.376
but is not for practical
purposes something to which he

00:33:46.376 --> 00:33:49.708
devotes a great deal of time.
Most regimes,

00:33:49.708 --> 00:33:54.103
and for the most part,
will be very imperfect mixtures

00:33:54.103 --> 00:33:58.250
of the few and the many,
the rich and the poor.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.320
Most regimes,
for the most part,

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.127
most politics for the most
part, will be struggles between

00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:07.200
what he calls oligarchies and
democracies,

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:12.559
rule by the rich oligarchies,
ruled by the poor democracies.

00:34:12.559 --> 00:34:15.533
In that respect,
Aristotle seems to add an

00:34:15.533 --> 00:34:19.376
economic or sociological
category to the fundamentally

00:34:19.376 --> 00:34:22.349
political categories of few and
many.

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:25.998
The few are not simply defined
quantitatively but they are

00:34:25.998 --> 00:34:28.750
defined, as it were,
also sociologically.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.119
The rich, the poor,
again defined as,

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:36.050
the many and defined by him as
the poor.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:40.730
It was not, you have to see
when you read these passages,

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:45.493
it was not Karl Marx but rather
it was Aristotle who first

00:34:45.493 --> 00:34:49.839
identified the importance of
what we would call class

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:55.063
struggle, in politics.
Every regime is in many ways a

00:34:55.063 --> 00:35:00.526
competition between classes.
But where he differs from Marx,

00:35:00.526 --> 00:35:04.929
is not that he believes that
the fundamental form of

00:35:04.929 --> 00:35:09.849
competition between classes is
not just for resources,

00:35:09.849 --> 00:35:14.049
it is not a struggle over who
controls what Marx calls the

00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:18.214
means of production,
it is a struggle over positions

00:35:18.214 --> 00:35:22.809
of honor, of status and
position, of positions of rule.

00:35:22.809 --> 00:35:25.878
Struggle is,
in short, political struggle

00:35:25.878 --> 00:35:28.755
not economic struggle.
Every regime,

00:35:28.755 --> 00:35:32.098
he believes,
will be in some ways a site of

00:35:32.098 --> 00:35:36.000
contestation with competing
claims to justice,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.832
with competing claims to
political rule for who ought to

00:35:39.832 --> 00:35:40.320
rule.

00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:48.612
There is, in other words,
not only a partisanship between

00:35:48.612 --> 00:35:51.900
regimes, but partisanship within
regimes,

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.724
where citizens are activated,
different groups of citizens,

00:35:55.724 --> 00:35:59.615
different classes of citizens
are activated by rivalrous and

00:35:59.615 --> 00:36:03.110
competing understandings of
justice and the good.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.434
The democratic faction,
he tells us,

00:36:05.434 --> 00:36:08.556
believes because all are equal
in some respects,

00:36:08.556 --> 00:36:11.280
they should be equal in all
respects.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.018
The oligarchs,
he tells us,

00:36:13.018 --> 00:36:15.894
because people are unequal in
some respects,

00:36:15.894 --> 00:36:18.769
they should be unequal in all
respects.

00:36:18.769 --> 00:36:23.665
For Aristotle the point and
purpose of political science is

00:36:23.665 --> 00:36:26.619
to mediate the causes of
faction,

00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:30.824
to help causes of faction that
lead to revolution and civil

00:36:30.824 --> 00:36:33.088
war.
Aristotle's statesman,

00:36:33.088 --> 00:36:36.828
Aristotle's statecraft,
his political science,

00:36:36.828 --> 00:36:39.820
is a form of political
mediation,

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:44.340
how to bring peace to conflict
ridden situations.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.576
It is always surprising to me
that many people think that

00:36:48.576 --> 00:36:53.115
Aristotle ignored or has no real
theory of political conflict

00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:57.729
when it seems to me conflict is
built in to the very structure

00:36:57.729 --> 00:37:00.679
of his understanding of a
regime.

00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:04.255
And again, not just conflict
between rival regimes but

00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:08.303
conflict built into the nature
of what we would call domestic

00:37:08.303 --> 00:37:11.514
politics,
different classes contending

00:37:11.514 --> 00:37:15.851
with different conceptions of
justice and how can the

00:37:15.851 --> 00:37:21.632
political scientist bring peace,
bring moderation to these

00:37:21.632 --> 00:37:25.640
deeply conflict ridden
situations?

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:32.840
Aristotle proposes--how does he
propose to do this?

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.965
He proposes a couple of
remedies to offset the

00:37:36.965 --> 00:37:42.099
potentially warlike struggle
between various factions.

00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:45.670
And the most important of these
remedies is the rule of law.

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:55.586
"Law insures," he says,
"the equal treatment of all

00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:59.565
citizens and prevents arbitrary
rule at the hands of the one,

00:37:59.565 --> 00:38:04.073
the few, or the many."
Law establishes what he says is

00:38:04.073 --> 00:38:09.280
a kind of impartiality for law,
he says, is impartiality.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.878
"One who asks the law to rule,"
he says, in Book III,

00:38:13.878 --> 00:38:18.830
chapter 16, "is held to be
asking God and intellect alone

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:23.340
to rule while one who asks man,
asks the beast.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.526
Desire is a thing of this sort,
and spiritedness," he writes

00:38:27.526 --> 00:38:31.582
again, "thumos,
spiritedness perverts rulers

00:38:31.582 --> 00:38:35.531
and the best men,
hence law is intellect without

00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:38.442
appetite.
Even the best men," he says,

00:38:38.442 --> 00:38:40.820
"can be perverted by
spiritedness.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:47.662
Law is the best hedge we have
against the domination of

00:38:47.662 --> 00:38:52.305
partiality and desire."
But this is not the end of the

00:38:52.305 --> 00:38:54.699
story.
In fact, it is only the

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:57.717
beginning.
Aristotle raises the question,

00:38:57.717 --> 00:39:01.454
a very important question,
whether the rule of law is to

00:39:01.454 --> 00:39:05.530
be referred to the rule of the
best, the best individual.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:09.417
Typically again,
he seems to answer the question

00:39:09.417 --> 00:39:14.132
from two different points of
view, giving each perspective

00:39:14.132 --> 00:39:17.983
its due, its justice.
He begins in many ways by

00:39:17.983 --> 00:39:22.121
appearing to defend Plato's view
about the rule of the best

00:39:22.121 --> 00:39:25.976
individual.
"The best regime," he says,

00:39:25.976 --> 00:39:29.679
"is not one based on written
law."

00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:32.687
Law, and his reason seems to be
something like this,

00:39:32.687 --> 00:39:34.869
law is at best a clumsy
instrument,

00:39:34.869 --> 00:39:40.482
a clumsy tool because laws only
deal with general matters and

00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:45.159
cannot deal with particular
concrete situations.

00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:48.348
Furthermore,
law seems to bind the hands of

00:39:48.348 --> 00:39:52.979
the statesmen and legislators
who always have to be responding

00:39:52.979 --> 00:39:56.699
to new and unforeseen
circumstances and yet at the

00:39:56.699 --> 00:40:00.420
same time Aristotle makes the
case for law.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.460
The judgment of an individual,
no matter how wise,

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:09.159
is more corruptible whether due
to passion or interest,

00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:14.780
or simply the fallibility of
human reason than is law.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:19.041
He notes, as a practical
matter, no one individual can

00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:20.730
oversee all things.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.699
Only a third party,
in this case law,

00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:33.510
is capable of judging
adequately.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:37.579
Again, he seems to give reasons
and good reasons for both cases.

00:40:37.579 --> 00:40:41.510
So he, but he moves to
question, should law be changed?

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.309
Is law changeable?
If so, how?

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:47.356
And once again,
he puts forward different

00:40:47.356 --> 00:40:50.156
arguments;
in Book II, chapter 8,

00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:55.128
he compares law to other arts
and sciences and suggests why

00:40:55.128 --> 00:40:59.930
sciences such as medicine and
has exhibited progress,

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:04.551
this should be true for law.
The antiquity of a law alone is

00:41:04.551 --> 00:41:10.005
no justification for its usage.
Aristotle seems to reject,

00:41:10.005 --> 00:41:13.538
you might say,
Burkean conservatism long

00:41:13.538 --> 00:41:17.454
before the time.
Antiquity or tradition alone is

00:41:17.454 --> 00:41:20.711
no justification,
yet at the same time he seems

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:23.260
to recognize that changes in
law,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.929
even when the result is
improvement, are dangerous.

00:41:26.929 --> 00:41:32.066
He writes, "It is a bad thing
to habituate people to reckless

00:41:32.066 --> 00:41:36.064
dissolution of laws.
The city will not be benefited

00:41:36.064 --> 00:41:40.222
as much from changing law as it
will be harmed through being

00:41:40.222 --> 00:41:42.829
habituated to disobey the
rulers."

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:46.795
In other words he's saying,
lawfulness, like every other

00:41:46.795 --> 00:41:50.424
virtue, is a habit,
it is a habit of behavior,

00:41:50.424 --> 00:41:55.058
and the habit of destroying,
disobeying even an unjust law

00:41:55.058 --> 00:41:58.230
will make people altogether
lawless.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.039
This emphasis upon law is a
constraint on human behavior.

00:42:07.039 --> 00:42:10.957
In many ways seems to introduce
a strong element of

00:42:10.957 --> 00:42:14.170
conventionalism in Aristotle's
thought.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:17.430
This is the view that justice
is determined by laws,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.139
by customs, by traditions,
that it is conventions,

00:42:21.139 --> 00:42:25.310
nomos in the broadest
sense of the term that

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.230
constitutes justice.
As I indicated,

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:31.833
there's also seems to be a
certain degree of relativism

00:42:31.833 --> 00:42:35.702
associated with this since
conventions vary from society to

00:42:35.702 --> 00:42:38.637
society.
The standards of justice will

00:42:38.637 --> 00:42:41.703
seem to, again,
be regime dependent and this

00:42:41.703 --> 00:42:45.696
seems to be entirely consistent
with parts of Aristotle's

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:49.230
anthropology.
After all, if we are political

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:52.755
animals by nature,
then the standards of justice

00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:57.758
must derive from politics,
a right that transcends society

00:42:57.758 --> 00:43:00.860
cannot be a right natural to
man.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:12.652
Yet Aristotle's conception of
our political nature seems to

00:43:12.652 --> 00:43:17.646
require standards of justice
that are natural or right for

00:43:17.646 --> 00:43:20.818
us.
Rule of law presupposes that

00:43:20.818 --> 00:43:25.480
there is a form of justice or
right natural to us.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.498
But what is the Aristotelian
standard of natural right or

00:43:29.498 --> 00:43:30.790
natural justice?

00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:36.880
Aristotle makes a surprising
assertion;

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.472
unfortunately,
it's an assertion in a book

00:43:39.472 --> 00:43:43.359
you're not reading.
A book, the Nicomachean

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:48.380
Ethics, Book V,
chapter 7, he says there that,

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:52.052
" all natural right is mutable
or changeable,

00:43:52.052 --> 00:43:56.309
all standards of natural
justice are changeable."

00:43:56.309 --> 00:44:00.368
And by this he means that
natural right is revealed not in

00:44:00.368 --> 00:44:03.429
general propositions or
universal maxims,

00:44:03.429 --> 00:44:06.924
as for example,
Immanuel Kant would argue later

00:44:06.924 --> 00:44:11.025
on, but in the concrete
decisions of a community or its

00:44:11.025 --> 00:44:14.139
leaders about what is right or
wrong.

00:44:14.139 --> 00:44:18.101
Natural right is mutable
because different circumstances

00:44:18.101 --> 00:44:21.269
will require different kinds of
decisions.

00:44:21.269 --> 00:44:25.710
So does this mean then that for
Aristotle there are no

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:29.900
universally valid standards of
justice or right?

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.127
That all that ends in
circumstances that justice,

00:44:33.127 --> 00:44:36.960
like the good citizen is,
as it were, regime dependent?

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.718
Is this not to fall into the
boundless field of

00:44:40.718 --> 00:44:45.540
Machiavelianism that declares
right and wrong to be entirely

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.152
relative to circumstance,
context dependent,

00:44:49.152 --> 00:44:51.500
is that what Aristotle is
saying?

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.657
Not at all.
Aristotle emphasizes the

00:44:55.657 --> 00:45:00.068
mutable character of natural
right in part to preserve the

00:45:00.068 --> 00:45:04.789
latitude, the freedom of action
required by the statesmen.

00:45:04.789 --> 00:45:09.683
Every statesman must confront
new and sometimes extreme

00:45:09.683 --> 00:45:14.123
situations that require
inventiveness and creative

00:45:14.123 --> 00:45:16.789
action.
And in such situations where

00:45:16.789 --> 00:45:19.889
the very survival of the
community may be at stake,

00:45:19.889 --> 00:45:24.879
we might call these emergency
situations, the conscientious

00:45:24.879 --> 00:45:29.179
statesmen must be able to
respond appropriately.

00:45:29.179 --> 00:45:33.134
Nine-eleven for example,
a moral law that refused to

00:45:33.134 --> 00:45:37.942
allow the statesmen to protect
the community in times of crisis

00:45:37.942 --> 00:45:41.510
would not be a principle of
natural right,

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.160
it would be a suicide note.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:51.120
To a considerable degree
Aristotle, Aristotelian

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.255
standards of natural right
reside in the specific

00:45:54.255 --> 00:45:57.839
decisions,
the concrete decisions of the

00:45:57.839 --> 00:46:01.301
ablest states;
these cannot be determined in

00:46:01.301 --> 00:46:05.321
advance but must be allowed to
emerge in response to new,

00:46:05.321 --> 00:46:08.909
and again, different and
unforeseen situations.

00:46:08.909 --> 00:46:12.324
What is naturally right,
what is right by nature in

00:46:12.324 --> 00:46:16.491
peace time, will not be the same
as what is naturally right or

00:46:16.491 --> 00:46:18.950
right by nature in times of war.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.682
What is right in normal
situations will not be the same

00:46:24.682 --> 00:46:26.800
as what is right in states of
emergency.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.189
The statesmen in the
Aristotelian sense is the one

00:46:30.189 --> 00:46:34.340
who seeks to return as quickly
and efficiently as possible to

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.998
the normal situation.
This is what distinguishes

00:46:37.998 --> 00:46:42.076
Aristotle from Machiavelli,
and all those later thinkers

00:46:42.076 --> 00:46:45.340
who take their bearings from
Machiavelli.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:49.396
I'm thinking of thinkers like
Hobbes, like Carl Schmitt,

00:46:49.396 --> 00:46:52.420
and Max Weber in the twentieth
century.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:56.320
All of these thinkers take
their bearings from the extreme

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.016
situation, situations of civil
war, of social collapse,

00:47:00.016 --> 00:47:01.590
of national crisis.

00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:10.085
The Aristotelian statesman will
not be unduly affected by the

00:47:10.085 --> 00:47:12.889
occasional need to depart from
the norm,

00:47:12.889 --> 00:47:16.025
whether this means this is
spent in the case,

00:47:16.025 --> 00:47:19.516
to take an American case,
the suspension of habeas

00:47:19.516 --> 00:47:23.093
Corpus,
as Abraham Lincoln did in the,

00:47:23.093 --> 00:47:27.470
during the Civil War,
or the regrettable need to

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:31.945
engage in domestic espionage.
But in any case,

00:47:31.945 --> 00:47:37.459
the Aristotelian statesman's
goal will be restoration of the

00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:42.786
conditions of constitutional
government and rule of law as

00:47:42.786 --> 00:47:47.460
quickly and again as efficiently
as possible.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:53.482
On that grim note,
I think I'll let you go and we

00:47:53.482 --> 00:47:58.000
will conclude Aristotle next
time.

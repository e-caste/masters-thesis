WAI CHEE DIMOCK: So we'll
get started

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.100
on The Great Gatsby.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.633
I'm sure that you guys have your
own views on the novel.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.133
So what I'll be talking about
today is in some sense a more

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:25.967
focused or sharp-edged take on
Gatsby, which you're certainly

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.367
free to dispute in section.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:32.100
But I want to begin with
Maxwell Perkins.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.667
And his name actually came up
last time when Fitzgerald read

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:40.933
the In Our Time stories, the
Paris edition, the person he

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.500
wrote to was Maxwell Perkins
to say that he's the real

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.133
thing, you have to get him.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.333
So Maxwell Perkins, obviously
very, very important.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.900
I would say that he really
is the muse of the 1920s.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.333
So the muse doesn't have to be
a woman, doesn't have to be a

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.267
romantic relation.

00:00:56.267 --> 00:01:01.333
He's just a very, very good
reader, careful reader,

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.800
critical reader, as we'll see.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.167
And this is a book about Maxwell
Perkins and his three

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:16.400
sons, Fitzgerald on the left,
Hemingway in the middle, and

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.633
Thomas Wolfe on the right.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.500
And these people wrote
to him constantly.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.033
He really was their mentor and
muse to all three of them.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.733
And so Hemingway and Fitzgerald
have that

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.733
in common as well.

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:35.033
It's great to have an
editor that you're

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.233
both responding to.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:43.700
So anyway, Maxwell Perkins was
the one who read the initial

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.233
drafts of The Great Gatsby,
and this is what he said

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:51.233
November 20, 1924.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:54.333
"Gatsby is somewhat vague.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:58.667
The reader's eyes can never
quite focus upon him.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.200
His outlines are dim.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.600
Now everything about Gatsby is
more or less a mystery, i.e.,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.000
more or less vague, and this may
be somewhat of an artistic

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.633
intention, but I think
it is mistaken.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:17.567
Couldn't he be physically
described as distinctly as the

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:22.733
others, and couldn't you add
one or two characteristics

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:26.300
like the use of that phrase 'old
sport,' not verbal, but

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.733
physical ones, perhaps?"

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:31.933
So very upfront about what he
likes, and in this case, what

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:33.833
he doesn't like.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:37.800
And he's also giving us
the terminology, loose

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.967
terminology, vague and
loose, to think

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:41.900
about The Great Gatsby.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.900
And this is what Fitzgerald
says back in turn

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.233
December 20, 1924.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:54.500
"Strange to say my notion of
Gatsby as vacant was OK.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.633
This is a complicated idea,
but I'm sure you'll

00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:59.500
understand.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.367
I know Gatsby better than
I know my own child.

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:07.833
My first instinct after your
letter was to let him go and

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.967
have Tom Buchanan dominate
the book.

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:13.733
But Gatsby sticks in my heart.

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:17.933
I had him for a while, then
lost him, and now I know I

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:22.000
have him again."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.133
You can't have a better
description of an author's

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:28.200
relation to his creation.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.933
And I think that this is
actually probably quite

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:34.933
common, the feeling that you
know this character better

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:37.967
than you know your
family members.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:43.933
But in this case, also being
quite deliberate and stubborn

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:47.667
in not giving in to Maxwell
Perkins' suggestion that he

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:51.233
should make Gatsby less vague.

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:55.267
And one other quote from
Fitzgerald to Perkins.

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:59.233
This is much later, in 1940.

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:01.800
"I wish I was in print.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.967
It would be odd a year or so
from now when Scottie"--

00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:06.667
his daughter--

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:12.367
"assures her friends I was an
author and finds that no book

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:14.867
is procurable.

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:19.333
Will the $0.25 press keep Gatsby
in the public eye, or

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:21.700
is the book unpopular?

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.000
Has it had its chance?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But to die so completely
and unjustly after

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.167
having given so much.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:34.067
Even now, there is little
published in American fiction

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:37.100
that doesn't slightly
bear my stamp.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.133
In a small way, I was
an original."

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:46.400
It's really heartbreaking that
Fitzgerald in fact never knew

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.233
that The Great Gatsby would
become the kind of

00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:50.400
book that it is.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.100
He would be totally
flabbergasted.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.633
His idea was that this was
something that would just

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:58.133
completely disappear.

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:00.167
So I think that we
can see several

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.833
things from this exchange.

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:10.567
First is that Fitzgerald really
didn't know how this

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:12.433
book was going to end up.

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:16.800
So it's completely a matter of
hindsight that we are able to

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.200
say now that this is the
American classic.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.500
He didn't know that it wasn't
a classic back then.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.367
It was experimental.

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:26.767
So we shouldn't lose
sight of that fact.

00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:30.433
It was an experiment, and he
really didn't know if it was

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:32.067
going to come out well or not.

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:36.733
In fact, his hunch in 1940 was
that it was going to be a

00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:39.467
failure, that it was going to
go nowhere; that it wasn't

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:44.333
going to be picked up by anyone,
that all this effort,

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:48.000
so much given to the
novel, all that was

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.067
going to come to nothing.

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:53.133
So I think that this in itself
suggests to us the

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:57.467
experimental nature, that he was
trying something new and

00:05:57.467 --> 00:06:00.767
because we're so used to it now,
in some sense, it stops

00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:01.667
being new to us.

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:05.733
So it's very important to go
back to that original sense of

00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:09.700
things being in flux and not
being sure if this was the way

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.667
things were going to go.

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:16.033
The other interesting point
about this letter is that

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:20.667
Fitzgerald said that, "In a
small way, I was an original."

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:23.567
So this is not actually
modesty.

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:27.467
I think that he's very proud of
the fact that in a small--

00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:29.267
well, no, it is modesty too.

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:33.367
But I think that he's also
taking pride in the fact that

00:06:33.367 --> 00:06:37.167
his greatness resides in his
smallness, that it's really in

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:41.900
the small details of The Great
Gatsby that he would most like

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.400
to be read.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.767
So we are very much operating
on the micro register today,

00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:52.633
respecting Fitzgerald's
sense of what kind of

00:06:52.633 --> 00:06:55.233
an author he was.

00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:57.267
And what I'd like
to do today--

00:06:57.267 --> 00:07:01.800
this is basically the outline
for today's lecture--

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.967
is to take the terminology
from Maxwell Perkins--

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:08.100
"vagueness"--

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.433
and use a slightly more formal
term and also stretching it a

00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:12.800
little bit.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.200
So the term that I'd like to
propose for us to consider

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.767
today is a synonym for
"vagueness," is

00:07:21.767 --> 00:07:25.100
"counter-realism." We know that
there's a lot that is

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.267
realistic in The Great Gatsby,
but there's also a strain of

00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:30.367
counter-realism.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:34.500
And maybe that's why it gives
the impression of being vague.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.633
And I'd like to tease out some
of the attributes or

00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:42.833
manifestations of the

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:46.667
counter-realist mode of writing.

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:47.600
First of all--

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.633
and I'll explain all this--
but there's some desire to

00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:52.667
capture motion.

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:57.233
This is actually something that
was done in 19th-century

00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:00.333
photography, daguerreotype,
trying to capture motion.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:05.900
This was started actually very
much by using machines and the

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.867
early camera to capture
motion.

00:08:08.867 --> 00:08:13.533
And I think that Fitzgerald
was trying to do something

00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:15.767
like that in The Great Gatsby.

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:19.967
Another component of this
counter-realism is the

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:23.033
uncertain boundaries between the
animate and the inanimate,

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:27.033
and related to that, human
attributes, properties of

00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:30.500
human personalities or
properties of the human body

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.367
being channeled or
routed through

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.233
properties of the machine.

00:08:35.233 --> 00:08:40.900
And then going back to our
discussion of comedy and

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.567
tragedy, there's a variety of
high-tech comedy and a variety

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.700
of high-tech tragedy in this
novel, but they're also

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.800
interconnected.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.867
So let's first look at what
Fitzgerald is trying to do in

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.300
capturing motion.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.267
But I thought that I would just
give you a completely

00:08:58.267 --> 00:09:03.167
static image of the mansion.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:06.600
This is the Guggenheim
Mansion.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.933
Merve actually mentioned that
she went to a wedding there.

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:10.767
STUDENT: My senior prom.

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:13.667
PROFESSOR: Your senior prom.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.700
And so you can go and visit.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.500
But this is the Guggenheim
Mansion, so it's over-the-top.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.800
But this is the nature of those
mansions at Sand's Point

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.067
or East Egg, where Tom
and Daisy live.

00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:33.167
And so this is a very static--

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:37.767
very impressive but static
image of a mansion.

00:09:37.767 --> 00:09:44.367
Let's see how Fitzgerald
describes

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:49.267
that Buchanan mansion.

00:09:49.267 --> 00:09:55.567
"The lawn started at the beach
and ran toward the front lawn

00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:59.767
for a quarter of a mile, jumping
over sun-dials and

00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:03.067
brick walls and burning
gardens--

00:10:03.067 --> 00:10:07.633
finally when it reached the
house drifting up the side in

00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:11.867
bright vines as though from
the momentum of its run."

00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:19.400
It's completely not a static
description at all.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.133
There's a little bit of static
description of what the house

00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:25.800
looks like, but I think this is
really what jumps out at us

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:32.433
is the translation of a static
physical object into motion.

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:36.067
This is not even trying to
capture something that is

00:10:36.067 --> 00:10:41.167
actually moving but trying to
attribute motion to something

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:45.033
that is otherwise stationary
and static.

00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:51.633
And this is quite early, so
we don't quite know why

00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:53.767
Fitzgerald would choose
to write in this way.

00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:56.667
But definitely, this is a very,
very deliberate way of

00:10:56.667 --> 00:11:00.333
writing, so make sure to keep
that in mind is that there's

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.233
quite often a kind
of conversion.

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:04.933
Conversion takes place all
the time in Fitzgerald.

00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:08.333
We've seen that he converts
qualities of

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.367
sound into visual images.

00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:13.233
And he also converts stationary

00:11:13.233 --> 00:11:17.033
objects into moving objects.

00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:22.433
So there's a quality that's
certainly more dynamic.

00:11:22.433 --> 00:11:28.600
But it also gives a sense that
even right here, we can say

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.267
that it's almost as if
the lawn has agency.

00:11:32.267 --> 00:11:34.400
It's not just sitting there.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.800
It's not just a lawn that
is mowed by someone.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.767
It starts somewhere, it goes
someplace, it jumps over

00:11:42.767 --> 00:11:45.867
things, it generates
its own momentum.

00:11:45.867 --> 00:11:53.467
So the least we can say is that
inanimate objects have

00:11:53.467 --> 00:11:56.700
life and motion and agency.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.967
And that has tremendous
implications both for those

00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:04.333
inanimate objects and possibly
also for animate objects, like

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.233
human beings.

00:12:05.233 --> 00:12:08.067
When you have inanimate
objects taking on the

00:12:08.067 --> 00:12:12.867
properties of animate human
beings, what happens to human

00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:15.967
beings, who are supposedly
in possession of those

00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:17.033
properties?

00:12:17.033 --> 00:12:19.633
So this is just a very--

00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:23.867
this is not a dramatic moment,
but it says a lot about the

00:12:23.867 --> 00:12:27.833
strategy that Fitzgerald uses.

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:34.867
So let's go on now and look more
at the boundaries between

00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.267
the animate and the inanimate,
because I think that this is

00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:41.800
really a major strategy
performed

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.367
throughout The Great Gatsby.

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:48.300
So this is an image of Corona,
which is the original for the

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.933
Valley of Ashes that

00:12:50.933 --> 00:12:52.700
Fitzgerald describes somewhere.

00:12:55.533 --> 00:12:59.467
Just this no-man's land,
even in this very

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:02.767
desolate visual image.

00:13:02.767 --> 00:13:08.500
But still we can visualize
such a place,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.333
desolate as it is.

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:12.833
Let's look at the
way Fitzgerald

00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:15.800
describes this place.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.700
"About halfway between West Egg
and New York, the motor

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.067
road hastily joins the railroad
and runs beside it

00:13:24.067 --> 00:13:29.300
for a quarter of a mile, so as
to shrink away from a certain

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.867
desolate area of land.

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:34.100
This is a valley of ashes--

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.933
a fantastic farm where ashes
grow like wheat into ridges

00:13:38.933 --> 00:13:43.367
and hills and grotesque gardens,
where ashes take the

00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:48.700
forms of houses and chimneys and
rising smoke and, finally,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:54.033
with a transcendent effort of
men who move dimly and already

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.667
crumbling through
the powdery air.

00:13:56.667 --> 00:14:01.367
Occasionally, a line of grey
cars crawls along an invisible

00:14:01.367 --> 00:14:06.467
track, gives out a ghastly
creak, and comes to rest, and

00:14:06.467 --> 00:14:10.400
immediately the ash-grey men
swarm up with leaden spades

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.167
and stir up an impenetrable
cloud, which screens their

00:14:14.167 --> 00:14:17.233
obscure operations
from your sight."

00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:20.600
I honestly don't know what
Fitzgerald is talking about,

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.767
whether he's really talking
about actual ash-grey men.

00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:26.000
Who are those men?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.833
They don't look like people
who work at gas stations.

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.867
We just don't know
what they are.

00:14:30.867 --> 00:14:36.967
So by the time we get to the
end of the passage, the

00:14:36.967 --> 00:14:41.300
ontological status of the
passage is really in doubt.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.200
We don't know if this is just
hallucination, if this is an

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.533
optical illusion, or something
even worse than that, a

00:14:50.533 --> 00:14:53.833
hallucination on the
part of Nick.

00:14:53.833 --> 00:15:02.667
So we can now see the fact that
inanimate objects have

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:07.833
agency and are capable of
moving, that they tend to

00:15:07.833 --> 00:15:13.300
render the visual field very
wobbly, very shaky.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.633
It's quite often out of focus.

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:18.433
Quite often, it's like a camera
that is moving, this

00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:20.167
blurry image.

00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:24.233
So we don't exactly know
what we're looking at.

00:15:24.233 --> 00:15:28.767
But even though we can't exactly
say, we can name the

00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:31.200
thing that we're looking at.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.400
There is something grotesque
about this scene, and the

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.433
grotesqueness comes
not so much from

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:40.233
the landscape itself.

00:15:40.233 --> 00:15:44.700
In the original landscape, it's
just sad, but it's not

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.133
especially grotesque.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:51.467
The grotesqueness comes really
completely from Fitzgerald's

00:15:51.467 --> 00:15:53.933
rhetoric, from his rhetorical

00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:58.367
intensification of that
landscape.

00:15:58.367 --> 00:16:03.867
Ashes growing like wheat and
into ridges and hills and

00:16:03.867 --> 00:16:07.500
grotesque gardens, ashes taking
the form of houses, and

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.000
so on, and maybe ashes turning
into those ash-grey men, maybe

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.600
they're just optical illusions,
that they're not

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.667
really biological
human beings.

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:17.267
We don't know.

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:23.033
So it seems as if there's
a grotesque fecundity to

00:16:23.033 --> 00:16:24.233
inanimate objects.

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:27.567
Ashes are capable
of reproduction.

00:16:27.567 --> 00:16:31.000
They are capable of reproducing
themselves in a

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.033
way that we tend to think that
only animate things are

00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:35.933
capable of doing.

00:16:35.933 --> 00:16:39.533
Reproduction is not a property,
is not a prerogative

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:41.167
of inanimate objects.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.000
But here, it seems as if it
actually is within the

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.333
province of inanimate objects
to be grotesquely

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:50.300
reproductive.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:56.433
So already what we're beginning
to see is the

00:16:56.433 --> 00:17:02.933
writing-over of a lot of the
things that we had imagined to

00:17:02.933 --> 00:17:07.200
be on the human side
of the equation.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.000
All those things that we have
that are in our possession

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.800
that we are the sole owners of,
all those things are being

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.467
written over to inanimate
objects that might or might

00:17:19.467 --> 00:17:20.800
not be benign to us.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.533
Because we don't really know
what the relation is between

00:17:23.533 --> 00:17:26.233
these inanimate objects
and us.

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:33.033
But I think there's yet another
twist to this passage,

00:17:33.033 --> 00:17:38.300
and it has to do with a very
unobtrusive but I would say

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:48.433
nontrivial phrase, which is "the
motor road hastily joins

00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:55.167
the railroad and runs beside it
for a quarter of a mile."

00:17:55.167 --> 00:17:58.267
Do you guys remember anything,
hearing that phrase before?

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.200
"The lawn started at the beach
and ran toward the front lawn

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:15.367
for a quarter of a mile." So
this is the verbal echo, a

00:18:15.367 --> 00:18:19.633
very small but telling detail
that suggests that those two

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:21.400
passages are connected.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.200
We can really see what
a craftsman he is, a

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.200
genius in a small way.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.800
But that's why he's so great
is that it's just this

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.133
completely seemingly factual
phrasing that serves as the

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:39.200
bond between those
two passages.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.800
So the suggestion would seem to
be that there's kind of an

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:49.367
underside to the Buchanan
garden, grand mansion, and on

00:18:49.367 --> 00:18:52.300
and so on, that this is
really the underside.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.433
And in fact, the two of them
actually have a lot in common.

00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:56.700
There's a lot of
common ground.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:04.733
And the life, the strange and
obscure but very fertile and

00:19:04.733 --> 00:19:07.600
menacing life of the inanimate
object would seem to be the

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.267
common ground between
those two.

00:19:09.267 --> 00:19:14.300
So we don't have to read very
far into Great Gatsby to know

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.300
that there's something very
wrong with that marriage

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.033
between Tom and Daisy.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:25.233
And the landscape itself suggest
that the desolation is

00:19:25.233 --> 00:19:28.967
never really absent from
that household.

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:32.067
So I know that we are all
thinking about Gatsby because

00:19:32.067 --> 00:19:37.967
really Maxwell Perkins objected
mostly to the

00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:40.567
portrait of Gatsby, that
he's very vague.

00:19:40.567 --> 00:19:48.167
So here is this 1974
version embodied by

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:50.333
Robert Redford of Gatsby.

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:57.400
And I have to say, when
I see this, it's not--

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.433
I wouldn't say it's not not my
image of Gatsby, but it's also

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:03.200
not my image of Gatsby either,
because I really haven't

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.333
really visualized Gatsby
all that much.

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:08.733
So I have a funny relation
to this.

00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:14.367
It's OK, but I guess I really
could do without him.

00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:20.467
But anyway, it is an interesting
foil to what

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:24.267
Fitzgerald is trying to
do, because I don't--

00:20:24.267 --> 00:20:27.733
certainly we should see the
movie and everything, but the

00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:29.367
book is trying to do something
very different.

00:20:29.367 --> 00:20:30.500
He's not trying to
create a Robert

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.633
Redford-like image of Gatsby.

00:20:33.633 --> 00:20:42.667
So this is why Maxwell Perkins
thinks that Gatsby is vague.

00:20:42.667 --> 00:20:48.833
"If personality is an unbroken
series of successful gestures,

00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:51.167
then there was something
gorgeous about him, some

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:55.200
heightened sensitivity to the
promises of life, as if he

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.767
were related to one of those
intricate machines that

00:20:58.767 --> 00:21:01.733
register earthquakes
10,000 miles away."

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:04.767
There is almost no physical
description.

00:21:04.767 --> 00:21:08.167
This is very early-- it's true,
we haven't seen Gatsby--

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:13.833
but there really is never
a full-fledged physical

00:21:13.833 --> 00:21:16.333
description of Gatsby.

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:19.467
And instead, we get these
very, very oblique, very

00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:26.633
abstract descriptions of Gatsby
telling us about his

00:21:26.633 --> 00:21:31.467
personality, but not even
supplying us with adjectives

00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:32.733
to name that.

00:21:32.733 --> 00:21:36.833
So we can just look at the
simple level of syntax.

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:40.333
Its heading is circuitous.

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:42.933
It's in the conditional tense.

00:21:42.933 --> 00:21:45.533
"If"-- begins with
the word "if"--

00:21:45.533 --> 00:21:48.733
"If personality is an unbroken
series." So right there, it's

00:21:48.733 --> 00:21:50.267
not even a declarative
sentence.

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:54.233
It's a conditional sentence,
"if" and "then" construction.

00:21:54.233 --> 00:22:01.400
So Nick is not even fully
committing himself to that

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.633
description.

00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:05.800
He's holding back
to some degree.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.367
And not only that, not only
is this very obtrusive

00:22:09.367 --> 00:22:15.767
conditionality to the syntax,
but then out of nowhere,

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:20.600
there's this description that
he's related to this machine,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.833
seismograph machine that
"register earthquakes 10,000

00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:30.667
miles away." It really isn't a
very vivid analogy at all.

00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:32.233
It's not a graphic analogy.

00:22:32.233 --> 00:22:34.733
Gatsby does not look
in the least like

00:22:34.733 --> 00:22:35.867
that kind of machine.

00:22:35.867 --> 00:22:38.500
We don't know what he looks
like, but we know for sure he

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.100
doesn't look like one
of those machines.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:45.500
So it is not an analogy
that's helping us

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.767
to visualize Gatsby.

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:52.867
And quite the contrary, it's
making it-- so that's why I

00:22:52.867 --> 00:22:56.133
think that the movie is
really its own entity.

00:22:56.133 --> 00:22:58.867
It's not really related
to the book.

00:22:58.867 --> 00:23:01.067
It's a totally different
medium.

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:05.533
This is the linguistic medium
that Fitzgerald is working

00:23:05.533 --> 00:23:06.833
with and is trying to do
something different.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.667
And I have to say, it
is an open question.

00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:17.633
Some of us actually are more
stimulated by the visual

00:23:17.633 --> 00:23:19.933
medium than by the linguistic
medium.

00:23:19.933 --> 00:23:23.367
So I'm not saying here
that the movie is

00:23:23.367 --> 00:23:26.367
inferior to the novel.

00:23:26.367 --> 00:23:32.733
But I do think that we have to
be sure to give the linguistic

00:23:32.733 --> 00:23:35.867
medium its due, in the sense
that it really is trying to do

00:23:35.867 --> 00:23:37.500
something different.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:44.467
So we don't know what Gatsby is
like, other than that he is

00:23:44.467 --> 00:23:50.433
someone who seems to be
working with great--

00:23:50.433 --> 00:23:55.433
be able to work with great
distances, register an

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.267
earthquake 10,000 miles away.

00:23:57.267 --> 00:24:01.867
That is really not a skill or
talent that is necessary in

00:24:01.867 --> 00:24:02.167
The Great Gatsby.

00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:04.267
There are no earthquakes
in The Great Gatsby.

00:24:04.267 --> 00:24:11.233
But there is something that
calls for a long-distance

00:24:11.233 --> 00:24:16.667
tenacity and persistence, which
is actually across time,

00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:20.300
being able to be faithful
to one idea.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.333
So it's not 10,000 miles away
but over a number of years

00:24:24.333 --> 00:24:29.000
remaining stubbornly attached
to that one idea of a woman.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.967
So right there, there's also
a substitution or a

00:24:32.967 --> 00:24:38.600
transposition of a temporal
attribute onto a spatial

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.533
attribute as well.

00:24:39.533 --> 00:24:44.533
But in any case, by not
completely pinning Gatsby

00:24:44.533 --> 00:24:49.867
down, I think that Fitzgerald
is really inviting us to

00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:52.967
project our own meaning or
project our own reading of

00:24:52.967 --> 00:24:56.600
Gatsby into this very, very
loosely assembled, very

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.300
pointed, but oddly enough,
pointed but not focused.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.533
It's a paradox.

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:05.133
But I think that that's really
the effect that Fitzgerald is

00:25:05.133 --> 00:25:06.533
trying to cultivate.

00:25:06.533 --> 00:25:13.933
So we spent quite a bit of time
talking about comedy and

00:25:13.933 --> 00:25:19.033
tragedy last couple
of classes.

00:25:19.033 --> 00:25:26.300
And I want to bring those back
and talk a little bit, once

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.800
again, about them as a mixture,
that they are not two

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.433
very discrete genres
in the three

00:25:33.433 --> 00:25:35.067
authors that we are reading.

00:25:35.067 --> 00:25:41.000
They tend to be very much
cross-over genres

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.967
in The Great Gatsby.

00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:49.967
And here, because machines are
so important in this novel,

00:25:49.967 --> 00:25:53.433
comedy is quite often channeled

00:25:53.433 --> 00:25:57.267
through high-tech gadgets.

00:25:57.267 --> 00:26:03.233
And here is one very
local, very--

00:26:03.233 --> 00:26:07.033
basically just-right-there
instance of comedy.

00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:10.733
"Every Friday five crates of
oranges and lemons arrived

00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:12.733
from a fruiterer in New York.

00:26:12.733 --> 00:26:15.233
Every Monday these same oranges
and lemons left his

00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:18.200
back door in a pyramid
of pulpless halves.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.433
There was a machine in the
kitchen which could extract

00:26:21.433 --> 00:26:24.867
the juice of 200 oranges in
half an hour if a little

00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:29.133
button was pressed 200 times
by a butler's thumb."

00:26:29.133 --> 00:26:32.667
So I think that Fitzgerald
is having fun with this.

00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:37.300
This is comedy both as it comes
to us but also comedy in

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.500
the act of composition.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.367
This is obviously an author
who's having a good time

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:43.733
writing about this.

00:26:43.733 --> 00:26:47.467
So the reduction of the butler
to just his thumb and the

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:52.033
thumb reduced once more to
a completely utilitarian

00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:56.467
function of pressing this button
200 times in half an

00:26:56.467 --> 00:26:58.833
hour and producing the effect
on our oranges.

00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:01.800
So this is hilarious.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.700
I guess it's terrible if we
think about it from the

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.267
butler's point of view, that
this is what he has to do.

00:27:08.267 --> 00:27:14.200
But maybe it's repetitive,
monotonous, terrible labor,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.867
really, if we think that that's
what we have to do.

00:27:16.867 --> 00:27:19.900
But as Fitzgerald is telling
the story, it's really not

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.500
supposed to be tragic.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.700
It is comic, although I would
say that the tragedy or at

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:32.133
least the phenomenon of just
unbearable, repetitive labor

00:27:32.133 --> 00:27:34.667
is actually not so far
away from it either.

00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:37.933
That is the nature
of comedy here.

00:27:37.933 --> 00:27:40.000
So we'll move on.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.367
That little machine, even though
it's memorable, it's

00:27:43.367 --> 00:27:46.267
not a star player in
The Great Gatsby.

00:27:46.267 --> 00:27:49.667
The telephone is
a star player.

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:55.033
And this is an image of just
what the telephone-- very

00:27:55.033 --> 00:27:59.933
glamorous-looking machine,
very beautiful.

00:27:59.933 --> 00:28:04.800
So you can see why people would
want to write works of

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.333
literature about such
a beautiful machine.

00:28:10.933 --> 00:28:14.733
You guys know I'm going to talk
about that phone ringing

00:28:14.733 --> 00:28:18.533
when the Buchanans are having
dinner, so we'll get there.

00:28:18.533 --> 00:28:24.633
But for now, I just want to have
a little detour by way of

00:28:24.633 --> 00:28:29.933
the great poet who mostly is
known for his writing about

00:28:29.933 --> 00:28:32.633
nature and is not known for his
writing about technology,

00:28:32.633 --> 00:28:37.633
Robert Frost. But Robert Frost
actually has a poem called

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:41.100
"The Telephone." And I think
it's a very, very useful

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.067
counterpoint, actually,
to Fitzgerald.

00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:45.633
And you'll see whether
he's really

00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:47.033
talking about a telephone.

00:28:47.033 --> 00:28:53.633
The title of the poem is "The
Telephone." And quite often in

00:28:53.633 --> 00:28:55.567
Frost is this is a dramatic
dialogue.

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.933
It's a dialogue between
two people.

00:28:57.933 --> 00:29:01.033
"Having found the flower
and driven the bee

00:29:01.033 --> 00:29:03.900
away, I leaned my head.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.800
And holding by the stalk, I
listened and I thought I

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.267
caught the word --

00:29:09.267 --> 00:29:10.133
What was it?

00:29:10.133 --> 00:29:11.800
Did you call me by my name?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.133
Or did you say--

00:29:13.133 --> 00:29:15.333
Someone said, 'Come'--

00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:18.733
I heard it as I bowed.

00:29:18.733 --> 00:29:21.000
I may have thought as
much, but not aloud.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.700
Well, so I came."

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:29.933
So it's a lovely poem, and it's
a love poem about two

00:29:29.933 --> 00:29:32.300
people who are in love.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.233
We don't know the gender,
actually, but I think it's a

00:29:35.233 --> 00:29:37.200
man and a woman.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:43.933
It's someone really wanting to
see someone and just finding

00:29:43.933 --> 00:29:49.567
an excuse to come and see that
person and claiming that he's

00:29:49.567 --> 00:29:52.033
hearing a voice telling
him to come.

00:29:52.033 --> 00:29:56.533
And that is the telephone,
in big quotation marks.

00:29:56.533 --> 00:29:59.067
Frost, he knows about the
telephone, but he's really not

00:29:59.067 --> 00:30:00.767
talking about the machine.

00:30:00.767 --> 00:30:13.833
He's talking about the
impalpable audible bond or the

00:30:13.833 --> 00:30:18.800
bond of audibility that just
brings one person to the

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.467
presence of another person.

00:30:21.467 --> 00:30:25.600
And that is the telephone line,
it is that emotional

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.100
cord that really binds
one person.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.267
And that is the most powerful
telephone line of all.

00:30:32.267 --> 00:30:36.333
So it's a lovely poem, and it's
very much humanizing the

00:30:36.333 --> 00:30:43.300
telephone, turning it into an
emotional, romantic context

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.833
charged with human emotions.

00:30:44.833 --> 00:30:47.733
And it's really the fact that
it's the carrier of human

00:30:47.733 --> 00:30:52.067
emotions that makes the
telephone such an important

00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:53.367
human vehicle.

00:30:53.367 --> 00:30:58.967
It has been completely
assimilated into the everyday

00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:02.767
world of just human intimacy.

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:09.067
So let's see what Fitzgerald
does with the telephone.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.033
"The telephone rang inside,
startlingly, and as Daisy

00:31:16.033 --> 00:31:19.600
shook her head decisively at
Tom, the subject of the

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.833
stables, in fact all subjects,
vanished into air.

00:31:24.833 --> 00:31:27.600
Among the broken fragments of
the last five minutes at

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.900
table, I remember the candles
being lit again, pointlessly,

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.933
and I was conscious of wanting
to look squarely at everyone,

00:31:37.933 --> 00:31:40.600
and yet to avoid all eyes.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.000
I couldn't guess what Daisy and
Tom were thinking, but I

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.367
doubt if even Miss Baker, who
seemed to have mastered a

00:31:48.367 --> 00:31:53.133
certain hardy skepticism, was
able to put this fifth guest's

00:31:53.133 --> 00:31:57.867
shrill metallic urgency
out of mind."

00:31:57.867 --> 00:32:03.800
So on the other end of the
spectrum from Robert Frost,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.233
surprisingly, actually.

00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:06.933
Because he's on the other
side of the spectrum.

00:32:06.933 --> 00:32:10.433
Actually, the telephone actually
is also charged with

00:32:10.433 --> 00:32:11.867
intense emotions.

00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:13.767
This is not just a machine.

00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:21.900
So we can almost always say
that machines are always

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.800
carriers of human emotions
in one way or another.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.733
And that's why they're
important machines.

00:32:28.733 --> 00:32:32.600
If they were just like that
button that the butler presses

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:38.667
with his thumb, it wouldn't
be a very

00:32:38.667 --> 00:32:39.800
important presence at all.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.200
But the telephone is a very
important presence in The

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.767
Great Gatsby.

00:32:43.767 --> 00:32:50.167
And what's interesting about
this particular scenario

00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:57.033
constructed around this
high-tech machine in the 1920s

00:32:57.033 --> 00:33:05.133
is the association of this
high-tech machine with an

00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:09.433
intrusive force into a
traditional household.

00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:15.167
Before the telephone rang,
it was a pleasant dinner.

00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:22.300
And Daisy and Tom and her
cousin, Nick, and good friend,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.700
Jordan Baker, are all
sitting down to a

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.233
very civilized dinner.

00:33:27.233 --> 00:33:30.233
And in the course of that
civilized dinner, suddenly,

00:33:30.233 --> 00:33:34.633
the appearance of barbarian
hordes that was mentioned by

00:33:34.633 --> 00:33:36.567
Tom, because he's reading this
book about The Rise of the

00:33:36.567 --> 00:33:38.567
Colored Empires.

00:33:38.567 --> 00:33:47.067
So there's the first intrusion
of somebody not wanted, but

00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:48.767
not quite dismissible.

00:33:48.767 --> 00:33:52.300
That is not a trivial reference,
because actually

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.267
Daisy then picks it up and
talks about her white

00:33:54.267 --> 00:33:55.367
girlhood and so on.

00:33:55.367 --> 00:34:01.467
So The Rise of the Colored
Empires by Goddard that Tom

00:34:01.467 --> 00:34:03.867
has been reading, that
actually is the first

00:34:03.867 --> 00:34:07.933
intrusive, uninvited guest. It's
just a book, but it very

00:34:07.933 --> 00:34:11.800
much was an uninvited
guest to the dinner.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.933
And then there's a second
uninvited guest coming by way

00:34:15.933 --> 00:34:18.100
of the telephone.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.400
So we can say there's a causal
relation between them.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.167
It's not as if the telephone is
always bringing in people

00:34:27.167 --> 00:34:30.133
from a different social
class, really.

00:34:30.133 --> 00:34:36.933
And we know later that Myrtle,
who's calling here, is of such

00:34:36.933 --> 00:34:39.200
a unacceptable social class.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.600
Even though she's OK as a
mistress, it's not OK for her

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.967
to mention Daisy's name.

00:34:43.967 --> 00:34:47.833
When she mentions Daisy's name,
Tom breaks her nose.

00:34:47.833 --> 00:34:51.400
So that is the taboo
that Tom would not

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.133
allow Myrtle to break.

00:34:55.133 --> 00:34:58.400
Someone like her has no right
to mention his wife's name.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.267
That comes later.

00:35:00.267 --> 00:35:05.433
Right now, all we know is that
there's a lot of malice on the

00:35:05.433 --> 00:35:08.600
part of Myrtle.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.133
If you want to talk to someone
discreetly, you don't call

00:35:11.133 --> 00:35:12.833
during dinnertime.

00:35:12.833 --> 00:35:18.467
So it was a call that comes
bearing malice to begin with

00:35:18.467 --> 00:35:21.567
and is met with--

00:35:21.567 --> 00:35:26.333
well, malice or just the luxury
of being able to ignore

00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:35.567
her, which is the freedom that
Daisy and Tom are summoning at

00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:37.167
this moment.

00:35:37.167 --> 00:35:43.733
So all the social antagonisms
that are bubbling, actually,

00:35:43.733 --> 00:35:46.767
beneath the surface of The
Great Gatsby, all those

00:35:46.767 --> 00:35:52.133
antagonisms are being
foregrounded by virtue of this

00:35:52.133 --> 00:35:55.167
high-tech machine.

00:35:55.167 --> 00:36:01.267
And we also shouldn't forget,
The Great Gatsby is not a book

00:36:01.267 --> 00:36:02.167
about race.

00:36:02.167 --> 00:36:07.133
We have to be very careful that,
even though there's a

00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:09.567
reference to Rise of the Colored
Empires, it's not

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.067
primarily about race.

00:36:11.067 --> 00:36:15.800
But race is also not unimportant
in The Great

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.933
Gatsby, which is very,
very strange to me.

00:36:17.933 --> 00:36:20.233
Somebody should write a paper
about this, beginning with the

00:36:20.233 --> 00:36:21.767
reference to Rise of the
Colored Empires.

00:36:21.767 --> 00:36:27.167
There's actually a persistent
undercurrent of blackness,

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:30.267
actually, in this novel.

00:36:30.267 --> 00:36:34.900
So there also is a kind
of undercurrent of

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.833
[? Germanism, ?]

00:36:35.833 --> 00:36:38.867
that Gatsby is supposed to be in
the pay of the German army.

00:36:38.867 --> 00:36:41.900
He's supposed to be a cousin
of the Kaiser.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.333
All of those are really, really

00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:45.233
peculiar and quite insistent.

00:36:45.233 --> 00:36:49.467
So as you go on to write papers,
something to notice.

00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:52.000
These very marginal references,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.467
they are not trivial.

00:36:54.467 --> 00:37:03.033
So let's look now at really
the star player, the star

00:37:03.033 --> 00:37:06.233
high-tech player who's going to
be the star player all the

00:37:06.233 --> 00:37:09.433
way through The Great Gatsby,
which is the car.

00:37:09.433 --> 00:37:12.733
And we should call it
automobile, because it's a

00:37:12.733 --> 00:37:15.300
more dignified name.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.033
So here's the automobile.

00:37:17.033 --> 00:37:21.100
And this is the 1920s
Rolls-Royce.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.367
And this actually is a pretty
good representation, or at

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:32.200
least this is the car that was
used in The Great Gatsby.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.100
And we see Nick and
Gatsby there.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.067
Sam Waterston is Nick,
Robert Redford.

00:37:40.067 --> 00:37:42.367
So it looks very much
like that car.

00:37:42.367 --> 00:37:46.133
And to get a better view
of the Rolls-Royce--

00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:50.167
sorry, all respect for the
Rolls-Royce, but this doesn't

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:53.600
seem like a very impressive
vehicle.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:38:00.700
I can work up some excitement
about it, but I wouldn't say

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.900
it's really that stunning.

00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:07.167
Sorry.

00:38:07.167 --> 00:38:09.933
It looks more stunning with
human beings in it.

00:38:09.933 --> 00:38:13.067
But on the whole,
it's just a car.

00:38:13.067 --> 00:38:19.000
But here is Fitzgerald's
description of the

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Rolls-Royce.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.533
"I had seen it.

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:24.567
Everybody had seen it.

00:38:24.567 --> 00:38:29.200
It was a rich cream color,
bright with nickel, swollen

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.600
here and there in its monstrous
length with

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.667
triumphant hat-boxes and
supper-boxes and tool-boxes,

00:38:37.667 --> 00:38:42.600
and terraced with a labyrinth of
wind-shields that mirror a

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.900
dozen suns.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.967
Sitting down behind many layers
of glass in a sort of

00:38:48.967 --> 00:38:52.633
green leather conservatory,
we started to town."

00:38:52.633 --> 00:38:56.000
This is not a description
of that car.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.733
No.

00:38:56.733 --> 00:38:57.233
No.

00:38:57.233 --> 00:39:03.700
This is pure fabrication
on Fitzgerald's part.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.367
And there's a reference
back to classical

00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:11.033
mythology to a labyrinth.

00:39:11.033 --> 00:39:13.267
I don't know what car would
have a "labyrinth of

00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:17.033
wind-shields." So it seems that
Fitzgerald is not really

00:39:17.033 --> 00:39:20.500
talking about a car so much as
just an occasion to use the

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.633
classical mythology.

00:39:21.633 --> 00:39:25.100
And this is, in fact, the
stuff that modern

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.700
mythology is made of.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.833
This is the car.

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:32.100
It's the heart and soul
of modern mythology.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.667
And it's high-tech mythology
that this is what enables us

00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:42.233
to create myths about ourselves
and about other

00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:44.867
human beings that we
are intrigued by.

00:39:44.867 --> 00:39:48.933
So in many ways, this is
Nick's tribute to this

00:39:48.933 --> 00:39:57.767
completely mysterious and
seemingly superhuman person--

00:39:57.767 --> 00:40:02.100
or not superhuman in the way
that he's better than all of

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.833
us, but in the sense that he's
not quite human, both maybe

00:40:05.833 --> 00:40:10.633
subhuman and superhuman
combined, that there's

00:40:10.633 --> 00:40:15.267
something about him that he's
just not like the rest of us.

00:40:15.267 --> 00:40:20.333
And so as a consequence of
Gatsby not being quite like

00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:25.333
the rest of us, his car also
has to be not quite like

00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:27.200
anything else on
Earth, really.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.400
It has to be basically this
creature of language.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:39.867
But what is also interesting is
that there's a gesture or

00:40:39.867 --> 00:40:45.367
an attempt to go back, actually,
to that original

00:40:45.367 --> 00:40:51.200
image of the Valley of Ashes and
the grotesque fecundity of

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.133
the ashes, inanimate objects
capable of reproduction.

00:40:56.133 --> 00:41:01.700
Here, the car is a "green
leather conservatory." We

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.900
don't know what vegetation
is in that conservatory.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.433
It could be that it is not--

00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:11.233
obviously, it's not
real vegetation.

00:41:11.233 --> 00:41:17.067
It is whatever is growing
in Gatsby's heart.

00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:19.667
Something has to be growing
there in order for it to

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:21.933
survive all those years.

00:41:21.933 --> 00:41:26.433
And oddly enough, whatever is
growing there can be preserved

00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:31.167
and nourished only by high-tech

00:41:31.167 --> 00:41:33.267
machines that he really--

00:41:33.267 --> 00:41:38.800
Gatsby is very much a self-made
man, and he's also

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:44.133
self-making a particular kind
of romantic relation.

00:41:44.133 --> 00:41:49.933
But the nourishment that that
kind of self-making needs is

00:41:49.933 --> 00:41:54.067
actually high-tech sustenance,
high-tech maintenance and

00:41:54.067 --> 00:41:56.733
high-tech sustenance.

00:41:56.733 --> 00:42:03.500
So in all those ways, we can
see that the inanimate has

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:08.167
taken over and is really
contributing and shaping the

00:42:08.167 --> 00:42:09.600
human world.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:16.867
I want to end with two more
images of the automobile.

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:19.500
And this is looking ahead.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:28.033
And the first one is a very
marginal and not especially

00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:32.567
noticeable detail that I think
that we should, in fact, try

00:42:32.567 --> 00:42:35.433
to notice and try to
do something with.

00:42:35.433 --> 00:42:43.733
This is when Nick is going
to New York with Tom.

00:42:43.733 --> 00:42:48.733
"A dead man passed us in a
hearse heaped with blooms,

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:52.767
followed by two carriages with
drawn blinds, and by more

00:42:52.767 --> 00:42:55.700
cheerful carriages
for friends.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.733
As we crossed Blackwell's
Island, a limousine passed us,

00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:04.633
driven by a white chauffeur,
in which sat three modish

00:43:04.633 --> 00:43:08.600
negroes, two bucks,
and a girl.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.567
I laughed aloud as the yolks
of their eyeballs rolled

00:43:12.567 --> 00:43:14.933
toward us in haughty rivalry."

00:43:14.933 --> 00:43:20.133
This is really what I mean by
race being a very unexpected

00:43:20.133 --> 00:43:23.133
undercurrent in The
Great Gatsby.

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:28.633
This really is a completely
unnecessary detail.

00:43:28.633 --> 00:43:34.633
We'll never see that limousine
driven by the white chauffeur

00:43:34.633 --> 00:43:41.467
with the two black men and
a young black woman

00:43:41.467 --> 00:43:44.967
sitting in that car.

00:43:44.967 --> 00:43:51.233
It's the reversal of the iconic
image of what skin

00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:56.367
color the chauffeur usually is
of and the skin color of the

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:59.400
people who are usually sitting
in the limousine.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.633
So a complete reversal
of the color

00:44:02.633 --> 00:44:05.800
scheme inside a limousine.

00:44:08.333 --> 00:44:13.200
But even though that's a
striking visual detail, it is

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.567
not necessary.

00:44:15.567 --> 00:44:18.133
There's no obvious
necessity for its

00:44:18.133 --> 00:44:20.033
placement in the novel.

00:44:20.033 --> 00:44:24.067
So this is one instance
where something is--

00:44:24.067 --> 00:44:27.167
I would say it is
under-determined in the sense

00:44:27.167 --> 00:44:30.367
that the passage right there,
and in fact the rest of the

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:34.500
novel, is not giving us an
adequate explanation.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.433
Under-determined, not enough
information is given to us to

00:44:38.433 --> 00:44:41.200
enable us to make sense
of this particular

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.233
moment in the novel.

00:44:43.233 --> 00:44:46.133
The only way we can make
sense of it is through

00:44:46.133 --> 00:44:47.267
interpretation.

00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:52.033
So interpretation is actually a
necessary link in order for

00:44:52.033 --> 00:44:55.767
this passage to make
sense, to be an

00:44:55.767 --> 00:44:57.233
organic part of the novel.

00:44:57.233 --> 00:45:05.900
So I would argue that in some
sense, race is being adduced

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:16.800
sometimes as a visual analog
to people crossing class

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.733
boundaries, that there's
something--

00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:23.433
this is an act of transgression
or a reversal of

00:45:23.433 --> 00:45:25.200
social hierarchy.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:35.533
Myrtle intruding into the dinner
of her social betters--

00:45:35.533 --> 00:45:38.367
and I'm using that phrase
deliberately.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.333
That has to be in
quotation marks.

00:45:42.333 --> 00:45:47.733
But the offense, part of the
offense of Myrtle is that she

00:45:47.733 --> 00:45:50.900
really should stick to her
social station and stick to

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.133
her place, and she's intruding
into this private space of her

00:45:54.133 --> 00:45:55.567
social betters.

00:45:55.567 --> 00:46:01.067
And in some sense, this is the
same kind of transgression or

00:46:01.067 --> 00:46:06.000
intrusion or reversal of the
traditional hierarchies in the

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.533
three African-Americans being
driven by a white chauffeur.

00:46:10.533 --> 00:46:14.700
So all of that is almost as if
Fitzgerald can't really talk

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.767
about it in terms of Gatsby,
who's actually the person

00:46:18.767 --> 00:46:23.167
who's most responsible for that
kind of transgression.

00:46:23.167 --> 00:46:26.967
And Gatsby is really related
to Myrtle in that way.

00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:29.733
When thinking about who gets
killed at the end of the

00:46:29.733 --> 00:46:33.400
novel, that is one bond between
Gatsby and Myrtle.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:37.267
But there are numerous other
bonds between them, and race,

00:46:37.267 --> 00:46:43.400
a kind of oblique racial
transposition actually is one

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.033
of the common grounds between
Gatsby and Myrtle.

00:46:46.033 --> 00:46:52.300
So this is a very intriguing
moment in The Great Gatsby.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:59.400
And this is just to round up
what we know, the plot of The

00:46:59.400 --> 00:46:59.700
Great Gatsby.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.267
I don't think I'm giving
anything away.

00:47:02.267 --> 00:47:07.067
This is actually the moment when
Fitzgerald actually uses

00:47:07.067 --> 00:47:10.933
the word "tragedy." "The 'death
car,' as the newspapers

00:47:10.933 --> 00:47:12.800
called it, didn't stop.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.667
It came out of the gathering
darkness, wavered tragically

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:20.467
for a moment, and then
disappeared around the next

00:47:20.467 --> 00:47:24.167
bend." We know that this is the
moment when Myrtle gets

00:47:24.167 --> 00:47:25.967
killed, and of course,
she's-- sorry.

00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:32.933
The book doesn't really rest
on that one detail.

00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:36.333
You can know it and
still think it's a

00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:37.433
great novel to read.

00:47:37.433 --> 00:47:39.833
But this is what happens
to Myrtle.

00:47:39.833 --> 00:47:45.833
And in some sense, there's
an echoing already.

00:47:45.833 --> 00:47:52.067
There was a dead man in a
hearse in that previous

00:47:52.067 --> 00:47:54.333
passage about an automobile.

00:47:54.333 --> 00:48:00.333
And in this passage, that
was just a completely

00:48:00.333 --> 00:48:02.267
inconspicuous reference
that it just

00:48:02.267 --> 00:48:04.100
happened to be a hearse.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:09.033
In the second mention of the
car, it actually is a real

00:48:09.033 --> 00:48:13.300
hearse, not in the sense that
there's a dead body in it, but

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.633
in the sense that it's the
carrier of death, it's the

00:48:15.633 --> 00:48:19.333
bringer, conveyor, of
death to Myrtle.

00:48:19.333 --> 00:48:22.867
So we can get a sense of what a
careful writer Fitzgerald is

00:48:22.867 --> 00:48:24.433
right here.

00:48:24.433 --> 00:48:28.433
He's someone who works over
details over and over again so

00:48:28.433 --> 00:48:30.067
that there're all
these intricate

00:48:30.067 --> 00:48:33.600
interconnections in the novel.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:39.167
And in that way, even though it
is every bit as complicated

00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:42.800
as Faulkner, it's not as
difficult to read on the face

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.233
of it as Faulkner.

00:48:44.233 --> 00:48:47.233
But it's a novel that we should
read over and over

00:48:47.233 --> 00:48:49.567
again as well just to get
all those echoes and

00:48:49.567 --> 00:48:51.033
interrelations.

00:48:51.033 --> 00:48:54.033
So we'll come back on Thursday
and wrap up The Great Gatsby.

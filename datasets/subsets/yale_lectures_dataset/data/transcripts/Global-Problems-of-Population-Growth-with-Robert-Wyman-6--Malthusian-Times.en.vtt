00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.058
Prof: Last time we
started talking about tropical

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:13.121
places where high productivity
agriculture is generally just

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:14.580
not possible.
 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.914
Hence, without productive
agriculture you can't support

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:21.890
dense populations.
 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.885
Those cultures grew up in
time--in places where plenty of

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:34.630
land, land was not filled up,
it was people that were scarce.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.676
While individual women of
course still had to control

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:40.020
their fertility so that the
children--

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.628
the infants that they had
didn't die and there's many,

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:46.080
many things that they do for
that.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.152
The community cultural controls
on fertility are generally

00:00:50.152 --> 00:00:53.725
absent because from the
community point of view you

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:56.485
always wants to be,
at that time,

00:00:56.485 --> 00:01:01.313
larger and among other reasons
to protect your community from

00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:06.060
the ravages of hostile neighbors
because almost all of these

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.459
communities are--
just read any history of any

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:14.590
part of the world constant,
constant warfare,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.220
as we've discussed a lot.
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.021
Of many places in the world,
which one could describe,

00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:25.253
traditional Africa provides
some of the best examples of how

00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:27.188
these cultures operate.
 

00:01:27.188 --> 00:01:29.659
Again, I want to emphasize that
this a tradition--

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.325
a picture of a traditional time
and things are changing now

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:36.170
extremely rapidly everywhere in
the world,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.000
including of course Africa.
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.446
As I showed you last time,
Africa really is different than

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:46.739
the rest of the world.
 

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.525
I showed statistics comparing
Morocco on the north coast of

00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:54.050
Africa, included in the
Mediterranean cultural zone.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.132
You cross the Sahara,
you're in Niger,

00:01:57.132 --> 00:02:00.382
or you're in Mali,
and totally different

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:01.549
situation.
 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.920
The number of children is much
high--

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.700
people have is much higher,
I showed you that,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.020
the number of children that
they want is much higher,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.120
infant mortality has come down
in both places,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.818
in Morocco the fertility
responds to it,

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:19.979
in Niger the fertility does not
respond to it.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:26.293
While we're going--so we're
going to discuss this region and

00:02:26.293 --> 00:02:31.858
using a lot of generalizations
which will not fit any

00:02:31.858 --> 00:02:34.318
particular culture.
 

00:02:34.318 --> 00:02:39.989
If you add up all the birthrate
statistics, Sub-Saharan African

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.470
has about twice the birth rate
of North Africa.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.400
Again, it's all Suni Muslim
we're talking about,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.024
so religion is not the
difference, but the something

00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:52.370
else about the southern culture
which we've been talking about.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.428
It probably starts with the
agriculture and then goes into

00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:58.758
other fields.
 

00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:03.960
Of all the things that are
changing in Africa,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.840
fertility--the attitudes toward
fertility--

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.825
again I'm always using
fertility as the number of

00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:13.311
children a woman actually has
and not her ability to have

00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:14.120
children.
 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.252
The attitudes towards fertility
are sort of the most resistant

00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:17.870
to change.
 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.370
These societies have what you
might call a culture of

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.650
reproduction in which the
central idea is that of lineage,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.979
a family and its line of male
ancestors.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:35.840
The prime duty in these
cultures is to keep the lineage

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.560
going.
 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.560
Of course you've all read stuff
about China, China is

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.789
not--traditional China is not
particularly different than

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:43.310
this.
 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.470
The important thing is to
provide descendants for the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.430
ancestors.
 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.721
Not only is your own future--if
you don't have the son as your

00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:55.077
own future as a shade,
as sort of a spirit that hovers

00:03:55.077 --> 00:03:57.610
around,
is dependent on continuation of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.240
the line.
 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.735
The whole history of ancestors,
stretching back,

00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:04.860
is dependent on your having
descendants.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.744
The future line which is
perceived as sort of almost in

00:04:09.744 --> 00:04:12.598
existence,
of potential existence,

00:04:12.598 --> 00:04:16.980
the whole line from the distant
past going through you to the

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.509
distant future is all dependent
on you having descendants,

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.810
male descendants in the line.
 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.290
The central purpose,
the central goal,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.463
the central job of existence is
to continue this line of

00:04:33.463 --> 00:04:34.779
fertility.
 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:42.649
Now the traditional religion is
based on this lineage idea.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:47.557
Because it's your own--the gods
are in a sense your own

00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:49.500
ancestors,
people that you knew,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.971
people that you talk too,
they stay more close to you

00:04:52.971 --> 00:04:54.449
after they die.
 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.930
Unlike Western gods where you
pray but it's never clear

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.079
whether your prayers are being
answered or not,

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:07.146
in an ancestor worship
situation, the answer is right

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:10.507
there,
and you can talk back and forth

00:05:10.507 --> 00:05:11.449
with them.
 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.834
They're not distant,
eerie, supernatural kind of

00:05:14.834 --> 00:05:19.083
characters but rather like a
grandfather who just stays near

00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:20.740
us after his death.
 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.718
This kind of description comes
from the ethnographers,

00:05:24.718 --> 00:05:29.072
the anthropologists that go and
talk to the people in these

00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:30.949
traditional cultures.
 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.149
The lineage head,
who is almost always the old--

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:36.579
often the oldest male member of
the lineage,

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:40.807
he often can communicate
directly with these ancestors or

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:45.564
there may be a soothsayer in the
community and then the head man

00:05:45.564 --> 00:05:49.716
will commission the soothsayer
to ask the ancestors some

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.680
particular question.
 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.084
The ancestors are quite
available to discuss the most

00:05:55.084 --> 00:05:58.949
ordinary and mundane issues of
life or they can discuss very

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.259
weighty affairs.
 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.569
This doesn't require waiting
for some big holiday or some

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.327
huge amount of time,
it can be--the whole thing can

00:06:06.327 --> 00:06:08.800
be transacted in 15 minutes or
maybe a half an hour.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.939
Sometimes they're contacted,
they provide their answers,

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:16.100
and you've got the answer that
you need.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.129
One of the interesting,
with respect to this course,

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.081
one of the interesting things
that goes on is that family

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.399
planning is being introduced
into Africa,

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.850
has been now for quite a while,
and it's becoming available.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.899
The people are thinking it
over; it's a hot topic.

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:32.951
They're discussing it,
they're trying to figure out

00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:34.470
whether it's good for them or
not,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.170
whether it's permissible for
them or not,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.579
what's going to happen if you
use it,

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:40.170
what's going to happen if you
don't use it.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:46.110
It's a very hot topic and of
course they want the wisdom of

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.569
the ancestors on this.
 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:52.923
In the middle of this,
one set of demographers went

00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:55.911
into--
in Ghana there's a group of

00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:58.406
Nankana--
the name of the people there,

00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:01.533
and they went into their
villages and they wanted to see

00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:02.838
how this worked out.
 

00:07:02.838 --> 00:07:07.201
If this discussion with the
ancestors, as they call the

00:07:07.201 --> 00:07:10.274
traditional religion,
would be hostile to the

00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:13.286
introduction of family planning
because elsewhere in the world

00:07:13.286 --> 00:07:15.509
of course the more conservative
the more--

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:17.750
it doesn't depend on the
individual religion,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.959
a particular religion as I have
said and will say again,

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:23.949
but it does depend on the
religiosity of the person.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.819
The more religious a person is,
in almost any tradition,

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.930
the more hostile they will be
to change,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.261
and in particular to the
adoption of new reproductive

00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:36.009
practices like family planning.
 

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:39.247
They're interested in this
issue how this would work out in

00:07:39.247 --> 00:07:41.089
traditional villages in Africa.
 

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:43.764
He asked the village head
man--one of the

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:47.708
anthropologists--to inquire of
the spirits how many children

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:51.240
should a family have;
a simple question.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.238
Here's what the spirit said,
"Listen to what I have to

00:07:56.238 --> 00:08:01.238
say, children are the lineage,
if there are no children the

00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:03.050
lineage will end.
 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.932
We ancestors want many children;
the women should give birth to

00:08:07.932 --> 00:08:09.439
many children."
 

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:12.863
That was a pretty clear answer;
there was no futzing around

00:08:12.863 --> 00:08:13.959
with that one.
 

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:17.646
But being Western skeptics,
they didn't really believe that

00:08:17.646 --> 00:08:21.161
the ancestor was saying that,
so he was saying,

00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:26.300
well the headman put into the
mouths of the spirits whatever

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.865
the headman believed,
and that was not--made the

00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:32.158
anthropologists quite satisfied
with this.

00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:35.940
He was a good scientist and he
did the control experiment,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.509
he asked the headman,
the same headman who had just

00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:41.129
reported the conservative views
of the ancestors.

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:44.035
Well what do you think,
he got a completely different

00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:44.538
answer.
 

00:08:44.538 --> 00:08:48.029
"Women need to have just
enough children.

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:50.750
Currently it is very difficult
to fend for the children.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.928
There's no food to feed them.
 

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:56.508
If they are in school it is
difficult to pay their school

00:08:56.508 --> 00:08:59.000
fees and to buy them school
uniforms.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.125
Taking them to the hospital
when they are sick demands a lot

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:02.710
of money.
 

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.740
That is why we need to give
birth to few children."

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.705
Well that's a little different
take, and so then the

00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:13.379
demographer's brain starts
rolling and says;

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:15.879
now I got the scene,
now I got it right.

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:18.879
The ancestors are giving the
traditional point of view,

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:20.892
well that's true,
that was what the older

00:09:20.892 --> 00:09:24.129
generation believed,
but the headmen are part of the

00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:28.287
current generation and they're
going to take current views into

00:09:28.287 --> 00:09:31.440
consideration and take a more
moderate view.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.280
They interviewed the next--they
went to the next village and

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.123
interviewed the next lineage
head and that hypothesis didn't

00:09:39.123 --> 00:09:39.970
stand up.
 

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.231
Speaking for himself,
the headman said,

00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:45.804
"I would like them to have
many children because a large

00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:47.889
following it makes one a chief.
 

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:49.918
There is power in numbers."
 

00:09:49.918 --> 00:09:52.931
This is the idea that if you
have only a few people in your

00:09:52.931 --> 00:09:54.798
village you're not very
powerful,

00:09:54.798 --> 00:09:56.808
your neighbors can ignore you,
they can take advantage of you,

00:09:56.808 --> 00:10:00.333
but if you have a big set of
descendants and a big family and

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.291
extended family,
a big village then you're a

00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:07.110
powerful chief and he wanted
children so that he would be

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.929
powerful.
 

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.892
But then this same guy was
asked to see what the ancestors

00:10:16.892 --> 00:10:19.240
have to say about it,
and the ancestors said,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.168
"Everybody should have a
small number of children,

00:10:22.168 --> 00:10:26.918
but they should not refuse to
have children altogether."

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.960
Since the ancestors are close
at hand,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.700
it's perfectly reasonable that
they're aware of current trends,

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.191
and one of the ancestors said,
"It is now difficult to

00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:40.840
get an education as well as to
do farming.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.679
If a problem crops up and the
child is sick then money is

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:44.340
everything.
 

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.259
You have to buy medicine,"
meaning modern medicine,

00:10:47.259 --> 00:10:50.291
"And even if you go to the
herbalist,"

00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:53.011
traditional medicine,
"You need to take a

00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:54.820
fowl," a chicken or
something,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.450
"along to pay for the
treatment.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.086
It's no longer the same as in
the olden days when everybody

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:01.340
did farming."
 

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.211
That's the ancestor speaking,
very well aware of current

00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:06.759
trends and problems.
 

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:10.027
After they interviewed a whole
lot of these Nankana villages in

00:11:10.027 --> 00:11:12.028
Ghana they summarized the
research,

00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:16.658
and the result was no pattern
of responses at all.

00:11:16.658 --> 00:11:20.759
Sometime the headman and his
ancestors they agreed;

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:23.933
sometimes they disagreed;
sometimes it was the ancestor

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:27.288
taking the conservative line;
sometimes it was the headman

00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:29.269
taking the conservative line.
 

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:33.115
It was indeed like a discussion
between a man and say his

00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:37.029
grandfather that was going on
and they will have different

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:40.668
points of view and individuals
will be different.

00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:45.490
This contact with the ancestors
seems quite natural.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:52.587
You read this story--you hear
this story as 'oh my God,' but

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:57.279
it's perfectly natural to the
people.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:00.408
These people in northern Ghana
they have no word for

00:12:00.408 --> 00:12:01.330
supernatural.
 

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.480
It just doesn't exist.
 

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.697
They don't have any--they don't
have scientific explanations for

00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:07.836
anything,
so all explanations are sort of

00:12:07.836 --> 00:12:11.830
somewhere floating around,
some are empirical and

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.443
observational,
and some of them are

00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:17.357
supernatural,
and so there's no boundary

00:12:17.357 --> 00:12:21.168
between these kinds of
explanations for things,

00:12:21.168 --> 00:12:24.936
and so they don't have such a
word and they don't distinguish

00:12:24.936 --> 00:12:29.080
these kinds of discussions with
the ancestors from real things,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.899
real dreams or daydreams or
anything else.

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:37.840
It's all a very fluid kind of
thing.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.445
To people living in that kind
of a culture the Western idea of

00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:46.351
an unwavering set of rules,
cast in stone in some book

00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:49.113
thousands of years ago,
like the Bible,

00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:52.111
like the Koran,
would seem ludicrous to

00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:52.980
Nankana.
 

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.634
To them, our system of a book
that says everything you need to

00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:04.570
know is as crazy as our view of
them talking to the ancestors.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.139
You should then compare this
kind of individualistic,

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:12.544
flexible style of religion to
the mass monotheistic religions

00:13:12.544 --> 00:13:16.070
that we have in the northern
temperate zones,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.759
at least the Western northern
temperate zones.

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:22.462
These religions are all part of
a big political structure which

00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:25.570
requires uniformity of the
subjects of some king,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.288
or some emperor,
and submission to that person.

00:13:29.288 --> 00:13:31.048
Of course, as you probably all
know,

00:13:31.048 --> 00:13:36.938
the word Islam itself means
'submission' and the ideal in

00:13:36.938 --> 00:13:40.620
monotheistic religions is
often--

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:02.340
notice the uniformity.
 

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.320
This is women at prayer and
notice the--

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.072
as you see--when you see a
bigger picture of this there's

00:14:08.072 --> 00:14:11.269
just a sea of women at some big
event all dressed identically,

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:13.080
all looking identical.
 

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.745
When I was in Morocco I got a
little instruction book that is

00:14:17.745 --> 00:14:20.778
given to children about how to
pray,

00:14:20.778 --> 00:14:24.461
and every detail is specified
down to when you bow down during

00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:27.360
prayer the position of the toes
is specified--

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.850
are they curled under,
are they spread out,

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.308
you have to know that.
 

00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:36.340
Conformity is a very important
part of mass religion.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.846
Of course in the west how is
conformity enforced in

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:40.899
Christianity?
 

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:44.956
You burn the heretics,
a long history of burning and

00:14:44.956 --> 00:14:48.464
killing by the dominant church,
wherever it is,

00:14:48.464 --> 00:14:50.450
you just slaughter the people
that--

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.873
even on very tiny theological
differences if they don't

00:14:53.873 --> 00:14:57.105
believe exactly as the
authorities think they should

00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:00.563
believe,
off with their head,

00:15:00.563 --> 00:15:07.282
so it's a very different kind
of pattern of cultural

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:14.788
understanding of religion and
ancestors and the world.

00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:20.631
Given this intensity of
devotion to the lineage,

00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:26.350
the main virtue in Africa then
is fertility.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.950
The main sin is to be barren,
is not have children.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:35.907
An inability to have children,
barrenness, is not just a

00:15:35.907 --> 00:15:40.955
passive thing that happens to
you but it's punishment for

00:15:40.955 --> 00:15:44.288
something bad that you have
done.

00:15:44.288 --> 00:15:48.428
There's very little distinction
between infertility,

00:15:48.428 --> 00:15:51.081
the woman just can't get
pregnant, and of course they

00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:54.038
don't accept the idea that it
might be the man's fault,

00:15:54.038 --> 00:15:55.350
but the woman doesn't get
pregnant,

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.610
she's infertile,
she has miscarriages,

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.580
goes partway through the
pregnancy,

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.230
or infant deaths.
 

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.488
The important thing is to have
descendants who can carry on the

00:16:04.488 --> 00:16:07.636
line and however--
whatever the mechanism is by

00:16:07.636 --> 00:16:10.345
which a man or woman,
or the family,

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:12.950
is incapable of having
descendants,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.070
that's the worst sin and it's
your fault.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.009
It's not a passive thing that
happens to you.

00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:24.558
Barren women can be divorced,
they can be shunned,

00:16:24.558 --> 00:16:27.057
and sometimes they need
to--they're not even allowed to

00:16:27.057 --> 00:16:29.139
live in the center of the
village because--

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:31.283
of course they have no
scientific explanation for

00:16:31.283 --> 00:16:33.404
barrenness,
but maybe it's catching in some

00:16:33.404 --> 00:16:35.235
sense,
either by evil spirits which

00:16:35.235 --> 00:16:38.125
are keeping the woman from
getting pregnant and you don't

00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:40.190
want the evil spirits to attack
you,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:46.774
or some other reason they can
often be required to live on the

00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:49.149
edge of the village.
 

00:16:49.149 --> 00:16:52.014
Given this emphasis on,
one way or another,

00:16:52.014 --> 00:16:54.812
getting pregnant,
monogamy is not strictly

00:16:54.812 --> 00:16:58.355
enforced;
it's not the kind of obsession

00:16:58.355 --> 00:17:00.480
that it is in the West.
 

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.451
Here's a wonderful
story--recent 2000,

00:17:03.451 --> 00:17:06.746
this is The People Newspaper
from Nairobi,

00:17:06.746 --> 00:17:07.548
Kenya.
 

00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:11.559
"A group of women stormed
the Kenya police station to

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:15.853
demand that officers either make
love to them or close illegal

00:17:15.853 --> 00:17:17.118
drinking dens.
 

00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:24.038
They said the drinking made
their husbands impotent.

00:17:24.038 --> 00:17:29.071
The women said the population
of the district was falling off

00:17:29.071 --> 00:17:33.769
as a result of the poor sexual
performance of the men.

00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:37.519
The women,"
it was Kanda actually,

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:40.326
north of Nairobi,
"brought the businesses in

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:43.132
town to a halt with their
daylong protest against

00:17:43.132 --> 00:17:45.529
excessive drinking by their men
folk.

00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:48.538
'Our men have turned to
vegetables;

00:17:48.538 --> 00:17:51.098
they leave home early and come
back intoxicated.

00:17:51.098 --> 00:17:53.436
There is no one to meet the
sexual needs of the

00:17:53.436 --> 00:17:57.250
wives.'"
Guess which group it was where

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.548
these women came from?
 

00:17:59.548 --> 00:18:02.808
It was 24 Catholic Church
groups in Kenya.

00:18:02.808 --> 00:18:07.482
They came together and demanded
that the officer in charge of

00:18:07.482 --> 00:18:12.390
the police station order his men
to make love to these women.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.786
The newspaper discretely does
not say how the police responded

00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:19.288
to this demand.
 

00:18:19.288 --> 00:18:23.523
Now--so the women must be
fertile and the men must be

00:18:23.523 --> 00:18:27.922
believed to be potent or
fertile, of course it's harder

00:18:27.922 --> 00:18:31.180
to tell whether the man is or
isn't.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.548
The men of course,
in a sense, want to keep the

00:18:34.548 --> 00:18:38.211
fertility of the women for
themselves but it's more

00:18:38.211 --> 00:18:42.386
important to have children no
matter who is the biological

00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:43.338
father.
 

00:18:43.338 --> 00:18:48.068
Not only in the family but once
a child is born,

00:18:48.068 --> 00:18:51.430
perhaps under obviously
uncertain circumstances,

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.009
the village will accept--the
community accepts the children.

00:18:54.009 --> 00:19:00.317
They need people;
they want strength in numbers,

00:19:00.317 --> 00:19:06.126
and so promiscuity is not
frowned on particularly by the

00:19:06.126 --> 00:19:07.500
community.
 

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.269
Everybody knows it goes on and
just keeps quiet.

00:19:10.269 --> 00:19:16.318
I was reading this week and
last a history of a Lesotho.

00:19:16.318 --> 00:19:19.009
How many--Lesotho is a small
country--you've been there?

00:19:19.009 --> 00:19:21.769
No, okay.
 

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:25.288
A small enclave totally
surrounded by South Africa.

00:19:25.288 --> 00:19:31.348
This was a history before the
Europeans came about the 1700s.

00:19:31.348 --> 00:19:34.019
There was a king then and the
king,

00:19:34.019 --> 00:19:36.920
it was a very small group at
that time,

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.900
not much more than a village,
and when the third son--

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.256
this is sort of a quote,
"When the third son of the

00:19:44.256 --> 00:19:47.795
king died he left a widow who
was still of childbearing age

00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:49.868
but had no surviving children.
 

00:19:49.868 --> 00:19:53.012
By custom the widow should have
gone to live with her husband's

00:19:53.012 --> 00:19:55.903
younger brother so that she
could continue the seed of her

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:57.068
dead husband."
 

00:19:57.068 --> 00:20:01.428
Exactly as we see in the Old
Testament that we talked about

00:20:01.428 --> 00:20:02.328
last time.
 

00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:05.981
The widow didn't agree and she
went off and actually got

00:20:05.981 --> 00:20:10.098
pregnant by sort of a no good
who wasn't even of that tribe.

00:20:10.098 --> 00:20:16.259
Now this is a real no-no
and--but nevertheless the child,

00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:19.019
since that woman was legally
part of a certain lineage,

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:23.304
that child by someone who
wasn't even a member of the

00:20:23.304 --> 00:20:28.413
tribe and against the convention
was still accepted as a member

00:20:28.413 --> 00:20:31.048
of the king's lineage there.
 

00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:34.970
It turns that the child of
this--illegitimate in a sense--

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.490
child became the greatest king
that Lesotho has ever known,

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:44.160
a very important guy named
Moshoeshoe.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.050
Moshoeshoe himself,
the grandson of the time I'm

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.609
talking about,
he was reputed to have 140 to

00:20:51.609 --> 00:20:52.769
200 wives.
 

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:54.470
You read the history,
they of course--

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.656
they have whatever written
records they have and the first

00:20:56.656 --> 00:20:58.892
one says well--
when he was young he has 35

00:20:58.892 --> 00:21:03.011
wives, then he has 80 wives,
and every time this is reported

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:06.144
as he gets older,
and probably accumulates more

00:21:06.144 --> 00:21:08.619
wives,
the number goes up.

00:21:08.619 --> 00:21:10.618
The last report was 200 wives.
 

00:21:10.618 --> 00:21:12.915
Of course we don't know
anything about the accuracy of

00:21:12.915 --> 00:21:13.220
this.
 

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.391
But it was said most of his
latter wives were regarded as

00:21:17.391 --> 00:21:19.028
distinctly inferior.
 

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:22.641
Moshoeshoe would summon
whomever he wished to spend the

00:21:22.641 --> 00:21:25.717
night with him,
and he undoubtedly sired a vast

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:26.519
progeny.
 

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:30.030
He also offered these lesser
wives to visitors for the night

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.157
by way of hospitality,
but according to custom,

00:21:33.157 --> 00:21:36.709
any children these visitors
produced were regarded as

00:21:36.709 --> 00:21:38.690
Moshoeshoe's own children.
 

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:45.578
Again, in the West,
chastity, monogamy is valued,

00:21:45.578 --> 00:21:48.450
who the father is.
 

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.116
In under-populated cultures,
in cultures that have responded

00:21:52.116 --> 00:21:55.660
to under population it's the
children that are wanted,

00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.460
and the mechanism of
biologically fathering a child

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.858
is much less important.
 

00:22:02.858 --> 00:22:05.278
I experienced this myself quite
surprisingly.

00:22:05.278 --> 00:22:08.040
I think I mentioned I had been
in Borneo living with some

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.556
headhunters for a while,
and I got along pretty well

00:22:10.556 --> 00:22:11.740
with the young guys.
 

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.786
Sort of the guys stay together
and so after I was there a

00:22:14.786 --> 00:22:17.670
little bit they offered me their
sisters and said,

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.359
'you shouldn't be sleeping
alone,' and for discretion,

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:25.538
I won't tell you what happened.
 

00:22:25.538 --> 00:22:30.674
Even nowadays many African
scholars maintain that African

00:22:30.674 --> 00:22:35.902
societies don't even really
distinguish between legitimate

00:22:35.902 --> 00:22:38.470
and illegitimate births.
 

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.890
15% to 25% of women in various
west and east African countries,

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.088
including Kenya for instance,
report premarital births,

00:22:46.088 --> 00:22:50.365
so they may or may not marry
the guy that's there before

00:22:50.365 --> 00:22:51.220
marriage.
 

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.030
As all these estimates of
behavior that is now becoming

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.844
with the Christianization and
the Islamization becoming

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:03.518
somewhat questionable,
if the official statistics are

00:23:03.518 --> 00:23:08.038
15% to 25% for sure it's a lot
larger than that.

00:23:08.038 --> 00:23:13.814
Of course the husband again
isn't really wildly happy about

00:23:13.814 --> 00:23:20.086
all this playing around and--but
what's most important to him is

00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:21.578
his status.
 

00:23:21.578 --> 00:23:25.308
Again, the biological parentage
of the child is less important.

00:23:25.308 --> 00:23:29.044
He knows whatever child his
wife has will be officially his,

00:23:29.044 --> 00:23:32.400
but he doesn't want to get to
be known as impotent.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.558
His potency is what matters to
him.

00:23:35.558 --> 00:23:40.017
As long as the woman--and this
happens a lot because very often

00:23:40.017 --> 00:23:43.900
the man is quite significantly
older than the wife,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.086
especially younger--as he gets
older and accumulates more

00:23:47.086 --> 00:23:48.661
wives,
then younger wives,

00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:51.789
and so his potency may really
be flagging quite a bit,

00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:53.640
so it's a real concern.
 

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.317
As long as--if the wife--as
long as the wife is discreet and

00:23:58.317 --> 00:24:03.074
doesn't make a public display
that this kid is really someone

00:24:03.074 --> 00:24:05.769
else's then not a big problem.
 

00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:09.750
The legal father accepts the
child;

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.808
the community accepts the child.
 

00:24:13.808 --> 00:24:16.108
Anthropologists of course
thought this was very

00:24:16.108 --> 00:24:19.431
interesting and they--
one wonderful--Susan Watkins

00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:22.308
from The University of
Pennsylvania,

00:24:22.308 --> 00:24:26.348
a sociologist,
works in Kenya in the Luo,

00:24:26.348 --> 00:24:28.430
with the Luo on the west of
Kenya;

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.828
Luo people.
 

00:24:29.828 --> 00:24:34.578
She got together a focus group
of women to discuss this issue.

00:24:34.578 --> 00:24:36.685
It's a long thing,
I'll just tell you a little bit

00:24:36.685 --> 00:24:38.612
from it,
and so Susan says,

00:24:38.612 --> 00:24:42.321
"So sometimes women were
unfaithful,"

00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:46.838
pretending a Western
perspective and the women said,

00:24:46.838 --> 00:24:49.624
"Yes being unfaithful
started a long time ago,"

00:24:49.624 --> 00:24:52.058
another woman:
"Long ago the older woman,

00:24:52.058 --> 00:24:54.506
the elder women,
would tell us that the only

00:24:54.506 --> 00:24:57.691
time you could sleep with
another man was if your husband

00:24:57.691 --> 00:24:59.910
was not able to make you
pregnant,

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.848
but it's not that way
anymore."

00:25:03.848 --> 00:25:07.310
The moderator again asks,
"Once you got the baby of

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.080
the other man,
was it for your husband or the

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.338
other man?"
 

00:25:11.338 --> 00:25:14.346
Notice the for is taken for
granted that this is a gift,

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:17.353
and who did you make the gift
for, is it a gift for your

00:25:17.353 --> 00:25:19.538
husband or a gift for the other
man.

00:25:19.538 --> 00:25:23.257
The women are somewhat
incredulous, "Of course it

00:25:23.257 --> 00:25:24.798
is for your husband.
 

00:25:24.798 --> 00:25:27.470
The other man is just like a
bull;

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:32.394
doesn't your cow wander and
mate with another bull from the

00:25:32.394 --> 00:25:33.500
next field?
 

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.827
When the cow gives birth,
is the calf yours or is the

00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:40.740
calf the owner of the other
bull?

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.250
Of course it's yours."
 

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.400
All the women join in.
 

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.940
It's a wonderful kind of little
story.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.895
In this the women are kind of
incredulous that Susan Watkins

00:25:50.895 --> 00:25:52.548
herself does not have any cows.
 

00:25:52.548 --> 00:25:57.470
They sort of presume that in
their answers that she does.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:02.085
It's also pretty obvious how
sort of matter of fact the women

00:26:02.085 --> 00:26:05.084
are about men's limited
biological role,

00:26:05.084 --> 00:26:06.700
as one might say.
 

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.153
There's no romanticization of
the relationship,

00:26:10.153 --> 00:26:14.358
none of the Western fetish
about biological paternity.

00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:18.803
Not only is extra-marital
fertility not frowned on in the

00:26:18.803 --> 00:26:22.461
same way that is,
at least officially here in the

00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:26.118
West,
but premarital promiscuity is

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:28.650
reasonably acceptable.
 

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:32.113
Maybe not surprisingly,
you all know about truck

00:26:32.113 --> 00:26:36.461
drivers going around spreading
AIDS from village to village,

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.819
guess who else spreads AIDS?
 

00:26:38.819 --> 00:26:42.217
School teachers;
so a school teacher is someone

00:26:42.217 --> 00:26:45.000
who has an education,
has been perhaps in the capital

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.690
or some big city,
has actually been to some sort

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.848
of secondary or college
education,

00:26:49.848 --> 00:26:52.838
and has an income,
a white collar job,

00:26:52.838 --> 00:26:54.680
a steady income from the
government--

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.358
teachers are in much demand.
 

00:26:56.358 --> 00:26:59.080
This is a very high status
person and he's

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.798
assigned--finishes college,
he's assigned to some village

00:27:02.798 --> 00:27:03.858
in the bush.
 

00:27:03.858 --> 00:27:07.018
He's maybe the--the only--the
highest status person,

00:27:07.018 --> 00:27:10.608
so what do the parents of all
the eligible daughters do?

00:27:10.608 --> 00:27:14.673
They bring their daughter to
them and offer him,

00:27:14.673 --> 00:27:19.258
'try out my daughter,' and
which sometimes they do and

00:27:19.258 --> 00:27:21.420
sometimes they don't.
 

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.571
The statistics are now very
clear that these teachers have

00:27:26.571 --> 00:27:31.816
picked up AIDS in the city and
they are one of the roots of

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:34.980
spreading AIDS in the villages.
 

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.932
Along with this loose attitude
toward paternity,

00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:41.327
toward who is exactly the
father, the children then are

00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:44.029
held a lot to a large degree in
common.

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:46.922
The idea of a nuclear family,
we have a mother and a father

00:27:46.922 --> 00:27:50.268
of well defined pair,
their children no question

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:56.567
about who are their children,
an idea of a nuclear family is

00:27:56.567 --> 00:27:58.808
not common there.
 

00:27:58.808 --> 00:28:04.423
30% to 50%--when they survey,
30% to 50% of the children are

00:28:04.423 --> 00:28:09.846
not living in the compound with
their biological mother or

00:28:09.846 --> 00:28:12.318
father in either case.
 

00:28:12.318 --> 00:28:32.592
Nuclear family is--very,
very simple things define a

00:28:32.592 --> 00:28:39.348
nuclear family.
 

00:28:39.348 --> 00:28:43.334
How frequently does he eat his
main meal--does a man eat his

00:28:43.334 --> 00:28:45.089
main meal with his wife?
 

00:28:45.089 --> 00:28:46.380
This gets studied.
 

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.140
How often he eats his main meal
with his children?

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.038
These are things that we take
just absolutely for granted.

00:28:52.038 --> 00:28:55.618
How frequently does his wife go
with him when he visits friends?

00:28:55.618 --> 00:28:59.113
How frequently does his wife go
with him when he visits

00:28:59.113 --> 00:28:59.890
relatives?
 

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:03.458
How much of his free time does
he spend with his wife and

00:29:03.458 --> 00:29:04.160
children?
 

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.665
The studies of this over the
years, there's a good study in

00:29:07.665 --> 00:29:10.689
Kenya for instance,
and the answer to all these are

00:29:10.689 --> 00:29:12.078
"rarely".
 

00:29:12.078 --> 00:29:18.568
There's a very low degree of
nucleation of the families.

00:29:18.568 --> 00:29:22.137
Again, this is changing and
families are becoming more and

00:29:22.137 --> 00:29:25.707
more nucleated and one of the
things that's studied is the

00:29:25.707 --> 00:29:28.962
percentage of people in
marriages that are considered

00:29:28.962 --> 00:29:29.838
nuclear.
 

00:29:29.838 --> 00:29:33.606
The last statistic that I saw
was 21%--only about one-fifth of

00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:36.818
families were what we would call
nuclear families.

00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:42.570
Just that idea of a tight-knit
family, exclusive in many ways,

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:46.058
is just not a common sort of
thing.

00:29:46.058 --> 00:29:51.324
Another result of this attitude
is what we might call

00:29:51.324 --> 00:29:53.450
quasi-prostitution.
 

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:57.751
In that traditional system the
father, the husband,

00:29:57.751 --> 00:30:03.000
is not necessarily required to
provide economic support to the

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.118
children.
 

00:30:04.118 --> 00:30:06.515
He is probably a rich man or
has some land,

00:30:06.515 --> 00:30:09.480
he gives that to his wife,
if he has several wives he

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.420
divides it up among the wives.
 

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.068
They then grow the food on the
land;

00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:17.433
they also have to do some work
on his land because men don't

00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:19.487
want to work,
and so the wife has the

00:30:19.487 --> 00:30:21.538
responsibility for the children.
 

00:30:21.538 --> 00:30:25.555
She must get the money for
health, she must get the money

00:30:25.555 --> 00:30:28.493
for education,
she does the farming on her

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:29.140
land.
 

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.415
This puts the women in
difficult strait and they're

00:30:32.415 --> 00:30:36.217
always needing resources and if
another man can come in and

00:30:36.217 --> 00:30:39.690
provide some resources for her
and her children,

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.759
well that's okay.
 

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:45.586
And so a fair amount of sex
involves, shall we say,

00:30:45.586 --> 00:30:47.500
a gift from the person.
 

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.842
It's certainly not considered
prostitution in that culture but

00:30:51.842 --> 00:30:54.118
we might use that word for it.
 

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:59.848
It's a very necessary part of
the whole system that resources

00:30:59.848 --> 00:31:05.769
can come into the mother/child
family other than from the legal

00:31:05.769 --> 00:31:10.450
husband who may or may not
provide very much.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:15.025
Now all of the--the whole way
this society is set up favors

00:31:15.025 --> 00:31:19.680
having a large number of
children in many different ways.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.058
For instance,
consider land tenure.

00:31:22.058 --> 00:31:25.356
The idea of private property
that one guy owns one plot of

00:31:25.356 --> 00:31:27.971
land,
it's a new idea there and

00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:32.876
traditionally the village or the
community held a bunch of

00:31:32.876 --> 00:31:33.910
property.
 

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.910
They would defend this against
other villages,

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.210
so in a sense it was some
communities' property,

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:44.730
and there was constant raiding
and constant contestation,

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.710
but they would try to defend
their territory.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.307
Within the territory the land
did not belong to any individual

00:31:51.307 --> 00:31:54.730
and this was totally rational
because again very high death

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.912
rates,
hard to keep people alive,

00:31:56.912 --> 00:32:00.088
so one family would die out,
have no descendants,

00:32:00.088 --> 00:32:02.980
another family would have many
children.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.828
So each generation the land
just gets redistributed;

00:32:07.828 --> 00:32:10.609
more or less equal amounts of
land per child,

00:32:10.609 --> 00:32:14.212
however many children that you
have, and again land is not

00:32:14.212 --> 00:32:15.730
especially limiting.
 

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.928
The result is that if a male
wants to be powerful and have a

00:32:20.928 --> 00:32:25.057
lot of land,
which means that if one part of

00:32:25.057 --> 00:32:28.230
land goes fallow for some
reason,

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.053
he has other land,
so he wants to have a lot of

00:32:30.053 --> 00:32:30.490
children.
 

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.680
They all are guaranteed land,
and the more children he has,

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.654
sons usually the case,
the more his financial

00:32:38.654 --> 00:32:41.413
security,
his hunger security,

00:32:41.413 --> 00:32:43.338
and his power goes up.
 

00:32:43.338 --> 00:32:49.538
The society supports this by
giving land to whatever children

00:32:49.538 --> 00:32:50.779
there are.
 

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:55.411
This is now breaking up because
it's becoming impossible,

00:32:55.411 --> 00:33:00.455
and again, there are studies in
Kenya that in 1981 the average

00:33:00.455 --> 00:33:03.019
land holding was 5.1 acres.
 

00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:07.036
The agronomists say,
and the local people are aware

00:33:07.036 --> 00:33:09.801
of this,
that about 4 acres of--with

00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:12.798
their technology of farming at
that time,

00:33:12.798 --> 00:33:17.509
about 4 acres of good land are
required,

00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:20.778
and intense cultivation you
have to really work it,

00:33:20.778 --> 00:33:25.173
were required to support a
family of the size of the

00:33:25.173 --> 00:33:27.068
father's generation.
 

00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:31.756
Even at that time the system
was to divide the land more or

00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:34.180
less equally among the sons.
 

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:39.277
Well if you take 5.1 acres and
the average number of children

00:33:39.277 --> 00:33:42.930
was four you get down to about
one acre,

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:48.498
which is way below the amount
of land that can support a

00:33:48.498 --> 00:33:49.410
family.
 

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:54.444
A crisis has eventuated and a
variety of things happened that

00:33:54.444 --> 00:33:57.548
when the economy is good in
Kenya,

00:33:57.548 --> 00:34:00.596
which is occasionally,
there are jobs in the cities

00:34:00.596 --> 00:34:03.338
and everyone hopes that one of
their sons,

00:34:03.338 --> 00:34:06.409
at least one will go off to the
city and get a job and send back

00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:08.989
remittances,
but a lot of the time the

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:13.059
economy is bad and the sons have
to stay on the land,

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:17.920
or migrate to the city without
a job and become this kind of

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.570
urban proletariat.
 

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:34.228
Under the influence of this
pressure the number of children

00:34:34.228 --> 00:34:38.755
that of--
the average males wants has

00:34:38.755 --> 00:34:41.150
gone down from five to about
three,

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:44.208
but still if you have two or
three acres and you divide it up

00:34:44.208 --> 00:34:46.349
three ways it's an impossible
situation.

00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:50.510
The sons cannot live on the
land that you have given.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.045
So while everybody is
aware--there's no ignorance or

00:34:53.045 --> 00:34:55.713
stupidity involved--
everybody is aware of the

00:34:55.713 --> 00:34:59.117
situation,
the cultural prodding is so

00:34:59.117 --> 00:35:02.023
strong,
the history is so strong that

00:35:02.023 --> 00:35:06.000
the father's don't want to
reduce their desire for sons.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.614
What has actually happened is
the number of sons desired has

00:35:11.614 --> 00:35:15.659
shrunk but from 4.5 to three,
and currently,

00:35:15.659 --> 00:35:20.090
if they divide up their land
each child gets a half an acre,

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:24.800
whereas four are necessary to
support the family.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.440
In respect to the work on the
farm,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.077
that the man will usually own
it, that varies in different

00:35:32.077 --> 00:35:35.264
parts of Africa,
own it in some sense while he's

00:35:35.264 --> 00:35:35.710
alive.
 

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:39.590
It goes back to the village on
his death.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:43.766
In this slash and burn
agriculture that really

00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:48.313
pre-modern people use,
the women do almost all the

00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:49.150
work.
 

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:52.132
The only thing that the men do
is work that women are basically

00:35:52.132 --> 00:35:55.235
physically incapable of doing,
which in this case if you're

00:35:55.235 --> 00:35:57.391
living in the forest,
is clearing the land,

00:35:57.391 --> 00:36:00.918
chopping down the trees,
hauling away the logs,

00:36:00.918 --> 00:36:03.210
and this the men do.
 

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:08.974
It's heavy labor but it lasts
about two weeks out of the year

00:36:08.974 --> 00:36:15.030
and the whole rest of the year
it's the women doing the work.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:20.659
This--and men don't like--in
traditional these--

00:36:20.659 --> 00:36:23.436
I mean traditional--every
period is traditional,

00:36:23.436 --> 00:36:26.742
some period it is traditional,
but whatever period you're

00:36:26.742 --> 00:36:30.405
talking about is traditional to
some later period so it's not a

00:36:30.405 --> 00:36:31.409
great term.
 

00:36:31.409 --> 00:36:37.257
Giving you a comparison in 1784
when the United States was being

00:36:37.257 --> 00:36:40.452
settled,
there were 6,000 Iroquois

00:36:40.452 --> 00:36:45.666
spread across New York state but
they were competing for land

00:36:45.666 --> 00:36:49.840
with 240,000 New Yorkers of
European descent;

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.929
6,000 versus 240,000.
 

00:36:52.929 --> 00:36:55.380
One tribe, the Oneida from
upstate--

00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:00.389
and I was actually born up
there, had only 600 members to

00:37:00.389 --> 00:37:04.856
the whole tribe,
but they inhabited 6,000,000

00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:06.340
acres of land.
 

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:11.465
This is what's talked about by
population--low population

00:37:11.465 --> 00:37:15.219
density, 600 people on 6,000,000
acres.

00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:17.983
As in Africa,
the women did most of the

00:37:17.983 --> 00:37:22.275
farming, they had a kind of
slash and burn agriculture also,

00:37:22.275 --> 00:37:25.329
and the women did most of the
farming.

00:37:25.329 --> 00:37:29.036
Well some of the colonists were
friendly to the Indians and

00:37:29.036 --> 00:37:32.742
wanted to help the Indians so
they would suggest repeatedly

00:37:32.742 --> 00:37:35.300
that why don't you take up
farming,

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.824
that with your hunter and
gatherer culture you're never

00:37:38.824 --> 00:37:42.349
going to have enough people to
resist the Europeans.

00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:45.423
If you want to resist the
Europeans and maintain some of

00:37:45.423 --> 00:37:48.219
your land you have to increase
your population,

00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:52.780
and the only way to do that is
you've got to go to agriculture.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.688
The men refused to do that and
they--one quote one of the

00:37:56.688 --> 00:37:59.619
Iroquois, "Farming is
women's work.

00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:05.402
Man was not made to go to work
in the earth like a hedge hog,

00:38:05.402 --> 00:38:08.969
but to go to war and
hunting."

00:38:08.969 --> 00:38:13.809
Given that women are doing the
work in many cultures,

00:38:13.809 --> 00:38:17.902
they are very valuable,
and so bride price comes from

00:38:17.902 --> 00:38:21.181
this idea that--
in some sense you're buying a

00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:24.842
woman and she is going to work
for you and there is a very

00:38:24.842 --> 00:38:28.632
rough generalization that in
cultures where the women do the

00:38:28.632 --> 00:38:30.891
work,
and the farming work

00:38:30.891 --> 00:38:34.327
especially, the man--
the bride price will go from

00:38:34.327 --> 00:38:36.239
the man to the woman's family.
 

00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:39.780
In other places like India,
many places in India where the

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:43.505
women do not do the work but are
sequestered and kept at home

00:38:43.505 --> 00:38:48.273
maybe covered up or something,
but only do internal household

00:38:48.273 --> 00:38:50.349
work, then it reverses.
 

00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:54.869
Then the man is taking care of
the woman and the woman's family

00:38:54.869 --> 00:38:59.099
must pay the man or the man's
family, a dowry situation.

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:03.311
The issue of dowry and bride
price is extremely complicated

00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:07.523
and cultures handle it very
differently, but that's sort of

00:39:07.523 --> 00:39:09.630
the rough generalization.
 

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:14.112
Polygyny results from this;
since land is traditionally not

00:39:14.112 --> 00:39:18.420
limiting but the number--you
need women to work the land.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.226
Men of course want as many
wives as possible,

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:26.119
possibly also for sexual
reasons of course.

00:39:26.119 --> 00:39:30.494
Again, comparing North Africa
with Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:39:30.494 --> 00:39:35.449
in North Africa and the Middle
East about 1% to 7% of men are

00:39:35.449 --> 00:39:36.768
polygamists.
 

00:39:36.768 --> 00:39:40.739
It happens, it's condoned,
but it's kind of a rare thing

00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:42.760
in the Mediterranean zone.
 

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:47.193
Even in the nineteenth century,
Mormons, again desert people in

00:39:47.193 --> 00:39:50.554
the United States,
less than 10% of the men were

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:51.699
polygamists.
 

00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:54.523
The maximum of course is 50%,
polygamy can never go beyond

00:39:54.523 --> 00:39:57.099
50% of the men because if one
man have two wives,

00:39:57.099 --> 00:40:00.929
then another man has no wives,
so 50% of the--

00:40:00.929 --> 00:40:04.983
maximum 50%--if they're limited
to two wives and maximum 50% of

00:40:04.983 --> 00:40:06.880
the men can be polygamists.
 

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.358
And if some are allowed more
than two wives,

00:40:09.358 --> 00:40:12.702
or can manage to get more than
two wives, then that maximum

00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:13.510
goes down.
 

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:18.108
In Sub-Saharan Africa,
and this is 1989 data,

00:40:18.108 --> 00:40:23.856
in different places 12% to 38%
of the African men are in

00:40:23.856 --> 00:40:26.469
polygamous marriages.
 

00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:30.219
If they're limited to two and
50% is a max,

00:40:30.219 --> 00:40:34.179
those places where polygamy is
38% of the men,

00:40:34.179 --> 00:40:38.438
means that most of the women
are in polygamists

00:40:38.438 --> 00:40:39.920
relationships.
 

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:45.150
Again, as we saw in New Guinea,
now a widow is very valuable,

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.289
again the women are doing the
work for you,

00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:49.891
and so in Senegal,
for instance,

00:40:49.891 --> 00:40:54.172
95% of the women who are
widowed remarry within five

00:40:54.172 --> 00:40:59.039
years and 75% of these widows
are married polygamously to a

00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:01.809
man that already has wives.
 

00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:06.190
Compare that to an equally
poverty stricken culture like

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:10.809
Bangladesh this almost never
happens, that widows don't get

00:41:10.809 --> 00:41:13.039
remarried in Bangladesh.
 

00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:18.420
Polygamy, contrary to the way
we often perceive it as an abuse

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.387
of women,
it is not usually considered an

00:41:21.387 --> 00:41:24.135
abuse there,
and women will often choose a

00:41:24.135 --> 00:41:26.929
polygamous marriage over a
monogamous one.

00:41:26.929 --> 00:41:30.222
Because what they want is a man
with resources,

00:41:30.222 --> 00:41:34.159
and such a man will probably
already have some wives.

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:39.079
The other wives act as a safety
net and a support group,

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:42.204
so if the woman gets sick,
or her farming doesn't go well

00:41:42.204 --> 00:41:44.976
that year,
or for whatever reason she can

00:41:44.976 --> 00:41:49.141
have a group of other women who
will help her in a mutual kind

00:41:49.141 --> 00:41:50.369
of aid society.
 

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:52.773
When a woman gets sick,
and again sickness in

00:41:52.773 --> 00:41:55.869
pre-medical societies,
their sick a much greater

00:41:55.869 --> 00:41:58.289
fraction of the time then we
are,

00:41:58.289 --> 00:41:59.786
and it's a big part of their
lives and they have to prepare

00:41:59.786 --> 00:42:00.018
for it.
 

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:03.514
They have children to take care
of and yet they're sick,

00:42:03.514 --> 00:42:05.420
the other women can come in.
 

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:10.275
Also if they're circumcised and
not--in some of the severe ways

00:42:10.275 --> 00:42:14.820
and not say enjoying sexuality;
the burden sometimes in many of

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.670
these cultures the idea of
female pleasure,

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.460
in some case it's known,
in some cases it's not known,

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.695
and it may be very painful if
she's had a circumcision

00:42:23.695 --> 00:42:26.119
operation,
so the burden--so sexuality can

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:28.119
be considered a burden on the
women,

00:42:28.119 --> 00:42:32.179
but if there's many wives that
burden is spread around.

00:42:32.179 --> 00:42:40.552
In many ways polygamy is an
advantageous situation for a

00:42:40.552 --> 00:42:43.139
woman to be in.
 

00:42:43.139 --> 00:42:47.489
One anecdote here:
in Kenya a white French woman

00:42:47.489 --> 00:42:52.489
anthropologist married an
illiterate Maasai warrior.

00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:55.170
She said, and she wrote a
biography,

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:58.349
she said that despite their
cultural differences she and her

00:42:58.349 --> 00:43:01.461
Maasai husband,
as well as his other wives,

00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:03.050
got along famously.
 

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:06.853
She wrote this memoir and it
was originally entitled,

00:43:06.853 --> 00:43:09.559
The Six Wives of My
Husband.

00:43:09.559 --> 00:43:13.202
In a later edition it was
amended to The Nine Wives of

00:43:13.202 --> 00:43:14.309
My Husband.
 

00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:19.518
In between he took three more
wives.

00:43:19.518 --> 00:43:24.501
I think you get the idea of
what goes on in a society where

00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:28.280
land is not limiting,
people are limiting.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.907
Now to contrast this whole
system to that--in the temperate

00:43:30.907 --> 00:43:33.889
zones;
agriculture is much more

00:43:33.889 --> 00:43:37.710
productive in the temperate
zones.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:42.018
The key switch is where a
single man can,

00:43:42.018 --> 00:43:44.900
by his agricultural efforts,
or a woman depending,

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:48.579
can produce more food then he
and his--

00:43:48.579 --> 00:43:51.507
whatever his family unit is,
can consume so that there's an

00:43:51.507 --> 00:43:52.670
agricultural surplus.
 

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:57.355
In hunter/gatherer societies
there's basically no surplus and

00:43:57.355 --> 00:44:01.103
a lot of the early traditional
African societies,

00:44:01.103 --> 00:44:03.679
there's basically no surplus.
 

00:44:03.679 --> 00:44:05.581
With this surplus,
of course, they have more

00:44:05.581 --> 00:44:07.349
children, the children are kept
alive;

00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:11.210
there's enough food for the
children, and the population

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:14.367
starts growing,
and eventually you fill up the

00:44:14.367 --> 00:44:15.000
land.
 

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.847
In this Lesotho story that
I'm--this history-- there's

00:44:18.847 --> 00:44:22.460
several books on the history,
the Bantu people,

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.059
who again, I mentioned this,
started in West Africa,

00:44:26.059 --> 00:44:29.215
move east to just under the
Sahel and then come down the

00:44:29.215 --> 00:44:33.257
east coast of Africa,
and at the period in the 1700s

00:44:33.257 --> 00:44:38.384
they're sort of moving into
southern Africa where conditions

00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:40.210
are pretty decent.
 

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.329
Who's there? The Bushmen.
 

00:44:42.329 --> 00:44:46.204
And they are kind of pushing
the Bushmen out of this part of

00:44:46.204 --> 00:44:47.650
Africa in the 1700s.
 

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.012
The land is,
as they see it,

00:44:49.012 --> 00:44:51.030
is open because the Bushmen are
very,

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.485
very sparse,
they're not a threat of any

00:44:54.485 --> 00:44:59.980
sort and mostly the Bantus seem
to take the Bushmen's wives.

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.581
They don't seem to bother to
kill the Bushmen,

00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:03.969
just take their wives.
 

00:45:03.969 --> 00:45:09.480
Later on, by the 1800s,
the land starts to get filled

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.780
up and then not only do the
Basotho of Lesotho,

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.280
the people call themselves
Basotho,

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.538
start having conflicts among
themselves but the neighboring

00:45:19.538 --> 00:45:22.144
groups,
another Bantu group the Zulu--a

00:45:22.144 --> 00:45:25.840
big group generally called Zulu
start getting politic--

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.710
they start getting politically
organized,

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:32.496
they try to get land and you
have tremendous wars in Zululand

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:36.882
which also slops over into the
Basutoland and tremendous

00:45:36.882 --> 00:45:40.050
destruction,
tremendous dislocation.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:44.164
Again, eventually the land
fills up when you have the kind

00:45:44.164 --> 00:45:46.980
of decent agriculture that you
have--

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.706
you can have in the Lesotho,
which was again temperate zone

00:45:50.706 --> 00:45:54.690
and that south enough in Africa
to be below the desert zone.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:58.579
The land fills up and all kinds
of things change.

00:45:58.579 --> 00:46:02.987
People come into conflict,
and because individuals can

00:46:02.987 --> 00:46:07.809
produce more children than are
needed to work the land,

00:46:07.809 --> 00:46:11.139
each individual can produce
more food than is required,

00:46:11.139 --> 00:46:16.514
the excess children must go off
and become basically landless

00:46:16.514 --> 00:46:21.980
peasants looking for scarce work
or go into some villages,

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:25.559
which eventually become cities,
and become landless laborers,

00:46:25.559 --> 00:46:27.610
and the urban poor.
 

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:31.139
Meanwhile, since there is this
excess,

00:46:31.139 --> 00:46:35.514
now it becomes worthwhile for
some people to get control of

00:46:35.514 --> 00:46:37.568
others,
because that surplus,

00:46:37.568 --> 00:46:41.342
in a situation where each man
just produces enough for himself

00:46:41.342 --> 00:46:45.253
and his wife and children,
if it's the man doing the work,

00:46:45.253 --> 00:46:48.699
then there's no sense capturing
him and enslaving him

00:46:48.699 --> 00:46:50.759
politically--
controlling him politically

00:46:50.759 --> 00:46:52.610
because he doesn't have any
surplus to give you,

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.230
for you to take.
 

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.559
Once agriculture is productive
enough so that he has surplus

00:46:57.559 --> 00:47:00.889
then he has something worth
taking and you start getting the

00:47:00.889 --> 00:47:02.927
chief--
the chief's want to become

00:47:02.927 --> 00:47:05.380
kings and they want to take over
your land,

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.530
and they want to control you,
and they want to get your

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:07.929
surplus.
 

00:47:07.929 --> 00:47:10.543
Actually civilization starts
that way because with the

00:47:10.543 --> 00:47:12.369
surplus they buy luxury
ornaments,

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:14.510
and they have craftsmen,
and they have trade,

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:17.885
and they have scholars,
and they have priests and all

00:47:17.885 --> 00:47:21.844
this kind of stuff because not
every man is needed to farm the

00:47:21.844 --> 00:47:22.429
land.
 

00:47:22.429 --> 00:47:25.409
You both have,
as a result of an increasing

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:29.648
population density,
the rise of civilization and

00:47:29.648 --> 00:47:35.771
the rise of a lot of the horrors
of civilization in these massive

00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:38.449
wars and massive poverty.
 

00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:43.239
This understanding of the
dangers of overpopulation have

00:47:43.239 --> 00:47:48.556
been perceived for a long time,
surprisingly early in history,

00:47:48.556 --> 00:47:53.311
when local regions got filled,
but even surrounding them there

00:47:53.311 --> 00:47:55.480
could be lots of empty space.
 

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.840
Here's a Greek epic from around
700 B.C.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.695
"There was a time when the
countless tribes of man

00:48:02.695 --> 00:48:05.409
oppressed the surface of the
earth,

00:48:05.409 --> 00:48:08.148
of the deep bosomed
earth," deep bosom meaning

00:48:08.148 --> 00:48:09.686
deep soil,
deep soil earth,

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:12.429
"and Zeus saw it and he
had pity on the earth,

00:48:12.429 --> 00:48:16.137
and in his wise heart resolved
to relieve the all-nurturing

00:48:16.137 --> 00:48:19.653
earth of men by causing the
great struggle of the Trojan

00:48:19.653 --> 00:48:22.128
War,
that the load of death might

00:48:22.128 --> 00:48:23.690
empty the world."
 

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:27.530
Again, this is his explanation
for the--

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:31.467
whoever wrote this
epic--explanation for the Trojan

00:48:31.467 --> 00:48:33.855
War,
that it was a Malthusian thing,

00:48:33.855 --> 00:48:37.233
that the earth got too crowded,
people couldn't support

00:48:37.233 --> 00:48:40.389
themselves anymore and they had
to be cleaned off.

00:48:40.389 --> 00:48:44.186
About 900 years later,
Tertullian, a Roman theologian

00:48:44.186 --> 00:48:49.880
echoes this;
200 A.D.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.635
"The earth is currently
more cultivated and developed

00:48:52.635 --> 00:48:53.699
than at early times.
 

00:48:53.699 --> 00:48:57.010
Now all places are accessible,
all are full of activity;

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.101
everywhere there is a dwelling,
everywhere a multitude,

00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:03.079
everywhere a government,
everywhere there is life.

00:49:03.079 --> 00:49:04.969
We are burdensome to the world.
 

00:49:04.969 --> 00:49:07.657
The resources are scarcely
adequate to us,

00:49:07.657 --> 00:49:11.461
and complaints are everywhere
while already nature does not

00:49:11.461 --> 00:49:12.840
sustain us."
 

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.146
Tertullian continues,
"Truly pestilence and

00:49:16.146 --> 00:49:18.615
hunger,
and war, and flood must be

00:49:18.615 --> 00:49:22.420
considered as a remedy for
nations like a pruning back of

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:26.090
the human race becoming
excessive in numbers."

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:28.639
That's quite lovely.
 

00:49:28.639 --> 00:49:33.474
Of course the Europeans are not
the only ones to worry about

00:49:33.474 --> 00:49:34.539
population.
 

00:49:34.539 --> 00:49:38.869
In China, in 500 B.C.,
Han Fei Tzu complained,

00:49:38.869 --> 00:49:43.219
"People at present think
that five sons are not too many,

00:49:43.219 --> 00:49:46.338
and each son has five sons
also, and before the death of

00:49:46.338 --> 00:49:49.570
the grandfather there are
already 25 descendants."

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.630
The women aren't counted.
 

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.454
"Therefore,
people are more and wealth is

00:49:53.454 --> 00:49:53.739
less.
 

00:49:53.739 --> 00:49:57.079
They work hard and receive
little."

00:49:57.079 --> 00:50:06.146
This growing population density
is well understood to be causing

00:50:06.146 --> 00:50:07.730
problems.
 

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:11.644
One of the problems that
happens at population density is

00:50:11.644 --> 00:50:14.440
that communicable
diseases--there's many,

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.699
many problems.
 

00:50:15.699 --> 00:50:20.039
As the population gets denser,
the wars become larger,

00:50:20.039 --> 00:50:23.445
maybe not as a percentage of
the population but you have

00:50:23.445 --> 00:50:26.789
these enormous wars with
enormous numbers of deaths.

00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:32.460
Another thing is disease starts
spreading, communicable disease

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:38.222
because the population is dense
enough that the disease does not

00:50:38.222 --> 00:50:39.320
die out.
 

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.264
Again, this is local even
though at the time of the

00:50:42.264 --> 00:50:45.693
Peloponnesian War in Greece,
about 420 B.C.,

00:50:45.693 --> 00:50:51.576
it was written about in 420,
a lot of that world was not

00:50:51.576 --> 00:50:54.938
crowded,
but Athens--the Athens area was

00:50:54.938 --> 00:50:57.768
indeed crowded,
and Athens itself was crowded,

00:50:57.768 --> 00:51:01.157
and during the war they had a--
everybody had to get into the

00:51:01.157 --> 00:51:04.440
city and the city was blockaded
and the population density in

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.849
the city was large enough that a
plague,

00:51:06.849 --> 00:51:10.050
some sort of plague,
we don't know what the disease

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.139
was, broke out.
 

00:51:11.139 --> 00:51:15.213
This is Thucydides describing
this, "Words indeed fail

00:51:15.213 --> 00:51:19.780
when one tries to give a general
picture of this disease."

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.920
He's writing The
Peloponnesian War as--how

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.240
many of you read The
Peloponnesian War or some

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.000
pieces of it?
 

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.960
A few;
it's very interesting.

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.246
"Words indeed fail when
one tries to give a general

00:51:32.246 --> 00:51:35.385
picture of this disease,
and as for the sufferings of

00:51:35.385 --> 00:51:38.090
individuals,
they seemed almost beyond the

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.500
capacity of human nature to
endure.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.440
People were dying like sheep,
they died like flies,

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.699
the bodies of the dying were
heaped one on top of the other,

00:51:47.699 --> 00:51:51.367
and half dead creatures could
be seen staggering about in the

00:51:51.367 --> 00:51:53.331
streets,
or flocking around the

00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:55.389
fountains in the desire for
water.

00:51:55.389 --> 00:51:59.291
The temples in which they took
up their quarters were full of

00:51:59.291 --> 00:52:03.130
the dead bodies of people who
had died inside them."

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:07.641
He goes on to describe the
result of this plague which is

00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:11.349
the people going through
emotional despair,

00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:18.864
civil society just collapses,
and all kinds of lawlessness

00:52:18.864 --> 00:52:20.579
breaks out.
 

00:52:20.579 --> 00:52:24.257
In later Europe,
Europe underwent huge

00:52:24.257 --> 00:52:27.139
vicissitudes of population.
 

00:52:27.139 --> 00:52:29.539
In the classic ages,
up through Rome,

00:52:29.539 --> 00:52:33.005
through the whole Roman Empire,
the population of the

00:52:33.005 --> 00:52:36.139
Mediterranean world was clearly
increasing;

00:52:36.139 --> 00:52:39.659
whatever data we have always
points to that.

00:52:39.659 --> 00:52:44.887
Then starting with the Dark
Ages, maybe as early as 300 or

00:52:44.887 --> 00:52:47.132
400,
Europe gets invaded by all

00:52:47.132 --> 00:52:49.414
kinds of "barbarian
hordes,"

00:52:49.414 --> 00:52:51.820
as they are perceived by the
Romans.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.461
First, it's the Germanic
tribes, then it's the Huns,

00:52:55.461 --> 00:52:58.889
then it's the Saracens,
then it's the Vikings.

00:52:58.889 --> 00:53:02.347
By the year 1000,
European population is

00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:05.958
extremely cut down;
European civilization is cut

00:53:05.958 --> 00:53:09.518
down, and we don't really have
good ideas of why all these

00:53:09.518 --> 00:53:10.829
invasions stopped.
 

00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:13.648
One history that I particularly
like says the reason they

00:53:13.648 --> 00:53:16.518
stopped, there was nothing left
worth taking in Europe.

00:53:16.518 --> 00:53:23.614
About 1000 the invasions
stopped and then civilization

00:53:23.614 --> 00:53:28.528
started recovering,
and it only took about 200

00:53:28.528 --> 00:53:32.239
years for Europe to basically
repopulate itself.

00:53:32.239 --> 00:53:35.255
When you have land,
when you have space,

00:53:35.255 --> 00:53:39.739
people then have a lot of
children, and keep them alive.

00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:42.206
In these good years,
it was good climate at that

00:53:42.206 --> 00:53:45.302
time also,
life expectancies in the 1200s

00:53:45.302 --> 00:53:48.119
were between 35 and 40 years
old,

00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:53.130
which is very good for this
very early era.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.976
Then around 1250 the population
stopped increasing,

00:53:55.976 --> 00:53:59.449
and for another 100 years or
so, it was more or less level.

00:53:59.449 --> 00:54:03.224
When you find a level
population that means there's

00:54:03.224 --> 00:54:06.998
something limiting,
some block, and they can't grow

00:54:06.998 --> 00:54:08.659
beyond this block.
 

00:54:08.659 --> 00:54:15.081
Historians attribute it to the
whole sort of a state of culture

00:54:15.081 --> 00:54:19.949
there, so the land was not owned
by peasants.

00:54:19.949 --> 00:54:23.172
So the peasants--if you your
own land you'll have a lot of

00:54:23.172 --> 00:54:26.170
interest in farming it maximally
and improving it,

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:28.730
and doing stuff and when
someone else owns the land,

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:31.054
you don't have much interest in
that and the worse the

00:54:31.054 --> 00:54:33.679
conditions you're under,
the less interest you have in

00:54:33.679 --> 00:54:36.510
improving the land for the
landowner because he's going to

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.639
take as much as he can away from
you and leave you just the bare

00:54:39.639 --> 00:54:41.280
amount that you can live on.
 

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.634
At this time the Catholic
Church was by far the biggest

00:54:45.634 --> 00:54:49.505
landowner in Europe,
and they owned 30% to 50% of

00:54:49.505 --> 00:54:52.650
all the productive lands in
Europe.

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:55.824
The peasants on the land were
serfs and lived in this extreme

00:54:55.824 --> 00:54:58.840
poverty, and they were not
allowed to leave the estate;

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.829
they were stuck to living in
that kind of condition.

00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:07.340
The ones that--well the church
itself got very rich.

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.847
This is a period of the
tremendous dominance of the

00:55:09.847 --> 00:55:10.300
church.
 

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:18.664
The income from church lands,
going to church nobility and to

00:55:18.664 --> 00:55:21.900
Rome,
was ten times larger and all

00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.284
the church lands--
you had all the crown lands of

00:55:25.284 --> 00:55:26.710
the crowns in Europe.
 

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:31.028
The church got ten times as
much income from their lands as

00:55:31.028 --> 00:55:33.860
did the so-called civil
authorities.

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:36.746
The civil authorities
controlled what was left of the

00:55:36.746 --> 00:55:38.739
land,
the kings and so forth,

00:55:38.739 --> 00:55:42.847
and it turns out that the serfs
on the civil land had somewhat

00:55:42.847 --> 00:55:45.516
better conditions,
somewhat more rights than on

00:55:45.516 --> 00:55:46.110
church lands.
 

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:49.418
On church lands they were
really the lowest of the low,

00:55:49.418 --> 00:55:52.728
but on civil lands they had
somewhat better situations,

00:55:52.728 --> 00:55:55.179
but they were still deep in
poverty.

00:55:55.179 --> 00:55:57.739
Because of this serfs just
continued,

00:55:57.739 --> 00:56:00.360
they were totally uneducated
and totally illiterate,

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.152
and so they continued to farm
the small plots just as they had

00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:07.788
done for centuries,
and so the productivity of the

00:56:07.788 --> 00:56:12.400
land did not increase and the
population could not increase.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.164
Europe was full so there was no
place that a serf could just get

00:56:16.164 --> 00:56:19.869
away and start his own farm with
someone else because that land

00:56:19.869 --> 00:56:22.139
was owned already by someone
else.

00:56:22.139 --> 00:56:24.110
In the cities which were
beginning a little bit,

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:26.730
the Guilds were trying to keep
members away,

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:28.954
they were closed,
they only took children of the

00:56:28.954 --> 00:56:33.061
members of the Guild,
there was no way for someone to

00:56:33.061 --> 00:56:36.130
rise up and become a craftsman.
 

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:43.590
Historians describe this in
about 1300 as a Malthusian

00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:48.717
situation that it's--
we'll talk more about Malthus

00:56:48.717 --> 00:56:50.947
later,
but a demographic and economic

00:56:50.947 --> 00:56:53.909
situation where you just can't
support more people.

00:56:53.909 --> 00:56:57.298
The productivity of your system
is just not enough to provide

00:56:57.298 --> 00:57:00.632
for any more population then you
have and that if population

00:57:00.632 --> 00:57:02.780
rises something is going to
come--

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:07.079
happen to knock it down again.
 

00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:10.172
The thing that happened in
Europe in this era is the

00:57:10.172 --> 00:57:10.719
plague.
 

00:57:10.719 --> 00:57:17.780
The plague first hit Europe in
Sicily in 1347,

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:20.811
the previous time it had been
there was six to seven centuries

00:57:20.811 --> 00:57:22.673
ago,
in what's called the Justinian

00:57:22.673 --> 00:57:25.472
Pandemic,
near the end of the Roman

00:57:25.472 --> 00:57:26.190
Empire.
 

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:30.315
The plague spread throughout
Europe killing millions and

00:57:30.315 --> 00:57:31.889
millions of people.
 

00:57:31.889 --> 00:57:35.820
There was wave after wave of
this and there was a wave in

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:39.190
1347, as I said,
the biggest and initial wave.

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:43.146
Then again in 1360,1371,
1381,1388, 1398,

00:57:43.146 --> 00:57:48.885
and every few years the plague
would come through again and

00:57:48.885 --> 00:57:51.260
kill lots of people.
 

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:55.882
Numbers are hard to come by,
most estimates say that about

00:57:55.882 --> 00:57:59.210
1/3 of Europe was killed by the
plague.

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:04.809
Numbers can range from 1/6 of
Europe to 1/2 of Europe,

00:58:04.809 --> 00:58:08.918
but massive,
massive death and brought

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:15.250
Europe back down to below what
you might call its carrying

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:20.360
capacity with the then current
technology.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.954
Plague--they don't know why the
plague came into Europe at

00:58:22.954 --> 00:58:25.418
exactly this time,
and it may have been a random

00:58:25.418 --> 00:58:28.358
event but the--
one of the more reasonable

00:58:28.358 --> 00:58:32.706
ideas is that plague kills,
and plague is endemic in Asia,

00:58:32.706 --> 00:58:35.369
but it has to get from Asia to
Europe,

00:58:35.369 --> 00:58:38.471
and if someone were traveling
from Asia to Europe they would

00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:40.976
be dead--
before this period--they would

00:58:40.976 --> 00:58:43.159
be dead long ago from the
plague.

00:58:43.159 --> 00:58:47.760
But in the early Middle Ages,
travel--

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.389
shipping and all kinds of
travel were getting better and

00:58:51.389 --> 00:58:53.626
faster,
and so one of the things the

00:58:53.626 --> 00:58:57.231
plague may have been able to get
to Europe because a ship leaving

00:58:57.231 --> 00:58:59.880
the Black Sea is where they
caught it from,

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:04.170
could get to Sicily before
everyone who had the plague--

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:07.170
everybody on the ship was dead.
 

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:09.570
That's one hypothesis.
 

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:13.815
It took from this nice high
level in 1250 and so forth,

00:59:13.815 --> 00:59:17.590
stagnant period,
and then it was knocked down.

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:21.833
It took hundreds of years,
minimum 200 years before the

00:59:21.833 --> 00:59:25.449
population of Europe recovered
to its 1300--

00:59:25.449 --> 00:59:29.364
1340 levels--and some
historians think it didn't

00:59:29.364 --> 00:59:35.329
really recover until about 1715,
so 400 years or something to

00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:37.400
recover from this.
 

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.536
The plague continued for
hundreds of years and more than

00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:45.599
300 years after the plague
started, it killed more than

00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:48.909
70,000 people in London alone;
one city.

00:59:48.909 --> 00:59:50.780
This is Daniel Defoe,
The Journal of the Plague

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:53.726
Year;
some of you have probably read

00:59:53.726 --> 00:59:57.601
that, really horrible,
so that's 1664 and 1665,

00:59:57.601 --> 01:00:01.559
more than 300 years after the
plague starts.

01:00:01.559 --> 01:00:04.199
One of the reasons it's
persisted is they--

01:00:04.199 --> 01:00:06.335
the people had absolutely no
idea what was causing the

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:08.246
plague,
absolutely no idea what to do

01:00:08.246 --> 01:00:10.219
to protect yourself from the
plague,

01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:15.021
no real idea of contagion or
contamination and there was no

01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:16.760
science whatsoever.
 

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.550
This was before the
enlightenment,

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:21.429
before rational attitudes
towards all these things.

01:00:21.429 --> 01:00:25.704
What would someone believe back
then not having any sort of real

01:00:25.704 --> 01:00:29.434
understanding of the whole
disease process and infection

01:00:29.434 --> 01:00:30.250
process?
 

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.349
Pretty obvious,
it's God's punishment.

01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:35.664
Humans are sinful,
we all know that and so God is

01:00:35.664 --> 01:00:36.768
punishing you.
 

01:00:36.768 --> 01:00:38.750
Well what do you do if you've
been a bad boy?

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:40.340
You have to get punished.
 

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.570
Penitence.
 

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:44.947
And people would whip
themselves, they're called the

01:00:44.947 --> 01:00:48.987
flagellants and--have any of you
seen The Seventh Seal?

01:00:48.987 --> 01:00:51.465
Ingmar Bergen;
this is a great movie,

01:00:51.465 --> 01:00:54.795
it starts--it's set at this
time in Europe and the opening

01:00:54.795 --> 01:00:58.032
scene is sort of a bleak,
barren European landscape with

01:00:58.032 --> 01:01:01.170
a long line of Pilgrims going
through each one with a whip,

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:04.730
beating the guy bloody,
the guy in front of him.

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:08.744
This is atoning for their sins
and this was a way that they

01:01:08.744 --> 01:01:10.960
intended to try to stay alive.
 

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.710
What was the actual result of
this?

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:17.965
They're weakening themselves,
they're cutting holes in their

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:20.889
skin which is a barrier to
penetration--flea bites;

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:23.791
flea bites carry plagues--so
these were sick,

01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:27.550
desperate people and they were
going from town to town.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:29.820
They would pick up plague in
one town,

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.666
carry it to the next,
carry it to the next,

01:01:32.666 --> 01:01:36.190
carry it to the next,
so the very mechanisms by which

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:40.121
they were trying to keep the
plague away was exactly one of

01:01:40.121 --> 01:01:43.849
the major mechanisms of the
spread of the plague.

01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:48.420
You read the history at the
time, there are all kinds of

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:52.989
crazy--what we consider crazy
things that they tried.

01:01:52.989 --> 01:01:56.342
So syphilis was introduced to
Europe at about that time from

01:01:56.342 --> 01:01:59.284
the new world,
so we're talking 150 years

01:01:59.284 --> 01:02:03.463
later, and while it was a new
thing on the horizon and a

01:02:03.463 --> 01:02:07.793
number of doctors somehow got
the idea that syphilis would

01:02:07.793 --> 01:02:10.530
protect you against the plague.
 

01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:14.708
One of the standard cures was
to get infected with syphilis as

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:17.380
a form of protection from the
plague.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.771
As far as we can tell,
this was a remedy taken up only

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:26.005
by rich people;
whether it's true or not I

01:02:26.005 --> 01:02:27.309
don't know.
 

01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:31.750
The plague, being a very major
demographic event,

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:34.250
knocking the population of
Europe way down,

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:38.590
was one of the seminal
landmarks in European

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:44.244
civilization and marked a
complete change in how European

01:02:44.244 --> 01:02:46.969
civilization developed.
 

01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:51.146
I described medieval Europe as
having this sort of Malthusian

01:02:51.146 --> 01:02:54.273
kind of land lock,
that things were unchanging and

01:02:54.273 --> 01:02:57.389
couldn't change because no one
was allowed to do change,

01:02:57.389 --> 01:03:00.719
and then all of a sudden you
get the Black Death,

01:03:00.719 --> 01:03:03.385
and then immediately after the
Black Death you get the

01:03:03.385 --> 01:03:04.090
renaissance.
 

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:05.429
What happens is a lot of
fluidity,

01:03:05.429 --> 01:03:06.980
people can leave the church
estates,

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.690
can leave their lords' estates,
there's plenty of empty land,

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:12.460
they go out there,
they can farm themselves,

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.789
the Guilds don't have members,
they can join Guilds,

01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:17.750
they can do technology,
they can move around,

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:21.260
all kinds of things turn up.
 

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:25.074
The first and most virulent
wave of the plague lasted from

01:03:25.074 --> 01:03:28.085
1340s to 1400,
and the next generation was the

01:03:28.085 --> 01:03:29.960
core of the renaissance.
 

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.721
So 1420, Brunelleschi designs
the Great Dome over the

01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:37.661
cathedral in Florence,
Ghiberti is creating the Great

01:03:37.661 --> 01:03:41.429
Bronze Doors for the Door of
Florence's Baptistery,

01:03:41.429 --> 01:03:43.900
and Donatello makes the first
David.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.050
I don't know if you ever--you
know Michelangelo's David,

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:49.541
but Donatello made a very
delicate one before him which is

01:03:49.541 --> 01:03:52.420
sort of very different but
equally beautiful.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.800
Da Vinci, Michelangelo all
worked in the 1400s,

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.369
Machiavelli,
the Medicis,

01:03:57.369 --> 01:04:00.840
all of this century and at the
end of the century,

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.150
1492, Columbus discovers
America.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:08.239
You have--you go from this
extremely tight,

01:04:08.239 --> 01:04:12.367
locked in medieval thing
lasting hundreds of years where

01:04:12.367 --> 01:04:16.945
basically almost everybody is
miserable unless you were a lord

01:04:16.945 --> 01:04:21.373
or a bishop and then boom you
reduce the population pressure

01:04:21.373 --> 01:04:24.599
and the world explodes in
creativity.

01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:28.077
Now that's--not everybody had
to agree that that was the

01:04:28.077 --> 01:04:31.429
seminal event that caused the
renaissance in some--

01:04:31.429 --> 01:04:35.081
nothing is that simple,
but it clearly was one of the

01:04:35.081 --> 01:04:39.154
major things that one has to
consider in describing why did

01:04:39.154 --> 01:04:41.050
the Renaissance happen.
 

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:42.826
There were of course
antecedents to the renaissance

01:04:42.826 --> 01:04:44.431
before that,
and as I've said,

01:04:44.431 --> 01:04:48.335
European civilizations started
recovering in the year 1000 well

01:04:48.335 --> 01:04:49.659
before the plague.
 

01:04:49.659 --> 01:04:52.639
There's a simplistic
explanation but certainly an

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.000
important part of what was going
on.

01:05:01.639 --> 01:05:07.411
Now we're almost out of time,
but even after the renaissance,

01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:12.028
and continuing up into
surprisingly modern times,

01:05:12.028 --> 01:05:15.300
people still lived very badly.
 

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.289
Better than before but still
badly,

01:05:17.289 --> 01:05:20.762
so from the time of the Black
Death until the industrial

01:05:20.762 --> 01:05:23.480
revolution started making things
better,

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.559
we're talking something like
1350 to maybe 1850,

01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:31.110
we can push that back to 1800
if you want.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:35.606
We have about 500 years,
again, where the population

01:05:35.606 --> 01:05:40.130
pressure is not great,
civilization is improving--is

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:43.329
making great advances in terms
of art,

01:05:43.329 --> 01:05:45.590
or culture, exploration of the
world,

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:50.105
but the common man doesn't
really see much improvement in

01:05:50.105 --> 01:05:51.960
the situation at all.
 

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.518
The population is still
overwhelmingly made up of

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:58.907
peasants,
just living on the edge of

01:05:58.907 --> 01:06:01.670
existence,
and this is a description,

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:05.324
a typical house in Europe in
the late Middle Ages is made of

01:06:05.324 --> 01:06:08.360
wood or various scraps of
vegetable material,

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.590
mixed with mud or clay.
 

01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:14.050
The roof is of straw or reeds,
the floor is of dirt,

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:16.969
and there's a pit in the middle
for fire.

01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:21.206
If it is winter the family
huddles cold together around the

01:06:21.206 --> 01:06:24.786
fire in semi-darkness,
with the animals nearby for

01:06:24.786 --> 01:06:27.193
warmth;
one of the reasons for living

01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:30.570
with the animals is for the
warmth that the animals produce.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.193
They don't understand
ventilation and in ventilation

01:06:33.193 --> 01:06:34.998
you bring in cold air,
you heat it,

01:06:34.998 --> 01:06:37.554
and you let it go out so they
don't want the cold air coming

01:06:37.554 --> 01:06:40.635
in so they close themselves up,
but they need a fire to keep

01:06:40.635 --> 01:06:42.981
from freezing,
so the room is filled with

01:06:42.981 --> 01:06:46.110
smoke with maybe a small hole
for the smoke to go out,

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:52.219
so they're not breathing fresh
air.

01:06:52.219 --> 01:06:56.099
This is a description of the
late Middle Ages,

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:59.719
300 years later there's little
progress.

01:06:59.719 --> 01:07:04.230
One of the great French
historians, George Huppert has

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:09.507
studied a village in France in
the 1600s, and there's a village

01:07:09.507 --> 01:07:11.889
about 500 to 700 people.
 

01:07:11.889 --> 01:07:16.280
"One-third of the babies
died in their first year,

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.889
another third died before
adulthood,

01:07:18.889 --> 01:07:22.253
thus only one-third survived to
reach their reproductive

01:07:22.253 --> 01:07:23.050
ages."
 

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:27.556
Remember I showed you that
graph from Roman times,

01:07:27.556 --> 01:07:32.250
same story, 1500 years and
basically no progress.

01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:35.938
"The little children who
managed to survive were good

01:07:35.938 --> 01:07:38.853
looking but,
if they reached the age of 10

01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:41.326
or 12,
they had already assumed the

01:07:41.326 --> 01:07:44.300
generally unpleasant appearance
of adults.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.744
The people tended to be
stunted, bent over,

01:07:47.744 --> 01:07:50.369
and of a yellowish complexion.
 

01:07:50.369 --> 01:07:51.619
They did not look healthy.
 

01:07:51.619 --> 01:07:53.916
Their bellies were
distended,"

01:07:53.916 --> 01:07:56.619
lack of protein,
"They moved slowly,

01:07:56.619 --> 01:08:00.860
they had poor teeth,
their growth was retarded."

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.130
He has village records from
this era,

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:07.742
"Of the 350 births only
145 would reach adulthood and

01:08:07.742 --> 01:08:10.795
marry in turn,
but of the 75 female survivors

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.751
marriage was almost
universal,"

01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:15.768
again if a woman managed to
survive she was going to be

01:08:15.768 --> 01:08:17.779
married and start childbearing.
 

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:21.117
Since they were unhealthy,
they didn't have good

01:08:21.117 --> 01:08:24.640
nutrition,
the girls did not reach menses

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.501
until about the age of 18,
and finally they started

01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:32.713
menstruating and became fertile,
and so they married late about

01:08:32.713 --> 01:08:35.354
age 23,
they just weren't healthy

01:08:35.354 --> 01:08:38.850
enough to engage in a marriage
before then.

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:42.966
Childbearing was almost
universal--marriage and

01:08:42.966 --> 01:08:47.529
childbearing was almost
universal and we'll see this

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:51.145
again in China,
but maternal death severely cut

01:08:51.145 --> 01:08:53.149
short the period of
childbearing.

01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:57.180
Having a child itself was
extremely dangerous and of the

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:59.204
third--
of the one-third that reached

01:08:59.204 --> 01:09:02.336
marriageable age,
most couples had only one or

01:09:02.336 --> 01:09:06.890
two children before either the
husband or the wife died.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:11.360
So again the limitation on the
number of children is poor

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.266
nutrition,
late maturity,

01:09:13.266 --> 01:09:17.597
leading to late marriage,
and then early death and they

01:09:17.597 --> 01:09:20.439
have only one or two children.
 

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:23.738
The end result of his
statistics isthat,

01:09:23.738 --> 01:09:27.180
by the time 100 female children
of the preceding generation had

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.680
died or finished their
reproductive years,

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.210
they had produced only 70
daughters.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.630
The population was not
replacing itself.

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:37.994
This is one of those situations
where, if no one comes in from

01:09:37.994 --> 01:09:40.810
the outside, that village is
going to go extinct.

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:44.479
There were other places with
apparently somewhat better

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:48.421
agriculture that did produce a
surplus of children and they

01:09:48.421 --> 01:09:52.501
wandered around looking for some
home and the village made up

01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:55.560
this deficit by marrying excess
people.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.823
Maybe the daughter
of--daughters of transient

01:09:57.823 --> 01:10:01.685
artisans or laborers,
and again, as we saw in the

01:10:01.685 --> 01:10:05.380
under populated areas of New
Guinea,

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:10.859
when a man died leaving a wife,
no time was wasted.

01:10:10.859 --> 01:10:13.420
The widows and widowers
remarried right away.

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:18.832
If--since land was so scarce
that a lot of the marriages,

01:10:18.832 --> 01:10:24.726
and another reason for the late
marriage, was they had to wait

01:10:24.726 --> 01:10:27.238
until the father died.
 

01:10:27.238 --> 01:10:30.668
That was important for working
the land that there was so much

01:10:30.668 --> 01:10:32.750
that could support so many
people,

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:36.319
and you had so much labor that
was required to work that land,

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:38.461
the father died,
that's one--they die fairly

01:10:38.461 --> 01:10:40.590
young,
when they're still being able

01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:42.238
to work,
so that labor is gone,

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:45.055
you have to take in a wife to
replace the labor of the dead

01:10:45.055 --> 01:10:47.932
father,
then the children come on and

01:10:47.932 --> 01:10:50.520
the generation keeps repeating.
 

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:55.827
This situation in France was
characteristic of France for 400

01:10:55.827 --> 01:11:01.222
years, and during that time the
population just hovered around

01:11:01.222 --> 01:11:02.550
20 million.
 

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:08.270
It came out of the Black Death
and it rose to 20 million and

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:13.992
then they were not able to get
over that for the ballpark of

01:11:13.992 --> 01:11:15.350
400 years.
 

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:24.198
In--I think--I'll just tell you
that the population started to

01:11:24.198 --> 01:11:29.420
recover then late in this
period,

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.453
and by 1560 it had really
returned to the 20 million

01:11:32.453 --> 01:11:35.283
before the Black Death;
this is France,

01:11:35.283 --> 01:11:38.600
but then religious fervor
starts up.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.706
In the wars of the sixteenth
and seventeenth century and you

01:11:41.706 --> 01:11:44.328
know --
the wars between the Catholics

01:11:44.328 --> 01:11:47.935
and the Protestants in Europe,
and previously,

01:11:47.935 --> 01:11:52.850
the Christians had religious
wars always against Islam.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.448
They were--that was the main
enemy,

01:11:54.448 --> 01:11:57.667
the Turks were very strong and
much more advanced then the

01:11:57.667 --> 01:12:00.377
Europeans and they were
battering at the doors of

01:12:00.377 --> 01:12:01.000
Europe.
 

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.850
They surrounded Vienna,
and so all of the military

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:09.328
activity was of religious origin
was against the Turks.

01:12:09.328 --> 01:12:13.068
That threat receded and now you
have the reformation and now you

01:12:13.068 --> 01:12:15.646
have two--
both Christian religious groups

01:12:15.646 --> 01:12:18.600
in Europe and they start going
after each other.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.610
About a quarter to half of the
German speaking people of

01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:26.988
Central Europe were killed in
this period, it was really most

01:12:26.988 --> 01:12:28.520
severe in Europe.
 

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.341
In France it was sort of
stamped out that early on in

01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:36.529
this period Protestants were
doing very well in France.

01:12:36.529 --> 01:12:39.630
They had a large fraction of
the population.

01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:41.025
Have you heard of St.
 

01:12:41.025 --> 01:12:42.288
Bartholomew's Day?
 

01:12:42.288 --> 01:12:48.140
On that day the--it also had to
do with the royal succession--

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:51.502
the Catholic forces got
together and just slaughtered

01:12:51.502 --> 01:12:55.319
all the Protestants they could
find and that sort of stopped

01:12:55.319 --> 01:12:57.260
the reformation in France.
 

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:00.945
Europe again went through then
130 years of this

01:13:00.945 --> 01:13:05.653
Catholic/Protestant bloodletting
before they finally realized

01:13:05.653 --> 01:13:08.868
that this was not a wise thing
to do.

01:13:08.868 --> 01:13:14.029
We'll continue with what
happens to European civilization

01:13:14.029 --> 01:13:19.560
after these slaughters--the
religious slaughter dies down.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.369
See you on Tuesday.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.064
Prof: Let me give a
forward to you of today in

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:10.690
relationship to the week
afterward.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.030
Today we have Jim Alexander on
Enron,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.950
and we'll do this as a
conversation,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.490
except that at a certain point
he's going to just do a little

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.476
straight lecturing on some
basics related to unfamiliar

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:33.730
ideas in the HBS case,
or potentially unclear ideas.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:42.787
This is a--the Enron case is
arguably the most important

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:51.350
meltdown in modern history of
American capitalism.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.051
It is certainly the one which
had riveted the world's

00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.939
attention more than any other,
and Jim was there at the

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:04.819
beginning--
not at the beginning,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.438
but there in an almost perfect
vantage point.

00:01:09.438 --> 00:01:16.030
So we're fortunate to have him
today.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.959
Before I go further I should
say it's his birthday,

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:29.430
and he, I think he doesn't want
me to tell you how old he is.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.110
Student: Happy
twenty-eighth!

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.670
Jim Alexander:
 Thank you.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.250
I needed that.
 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.569
Prof: On Monday we'll
have Richard Medley,

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.375
founder of Medley Global
Advisors, and that case is about

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.686
his selling--
Medley selling Medley Global

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:50.129
Advisors and quitting.
 

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:53.712
The question is:
How could a business have tens

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:58.310
of millions of dollars worth of
value when it is in entirely

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.049
framed around the personality of
one person?

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.299
The answer is he got it done,
and he will be a very

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.000
interesting guest.
 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.122
He's completely unpredictable
and he is famous,

00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:17.913
or infamous,
for George Soros' attack on the

00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:20.030
pound sterling.
 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.903
This was nearly twenty years
ago, when Soros' famous hedge

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:33.900
fund decided it was going to
attack the pound sterling,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.857
and Richard Medley was then
working for Soros and Medley had

00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:45.916
inside information about the
behavior of the central banks of

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:49.678
continental Europe,
and was able to predict their

00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:50.139
behavior.
 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:56.360
So Soros--the Soros fund made
well over a billion dollars on

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.370
one transaction in an attack on
the value of the pound.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.707
The attack was controversial
and Medley's role in it was

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:10.020
controversial,
and we'll have some fun with

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.520
him about that.
 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.218
You should begin now reading
Posner;

00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:22.389
the pages are small,
but it's a dense book.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.382
It's a challenging book,
and you'll need it for

00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:29.089
Wednesday of next week when we
have Will Goetzmann in as a

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.740
guest.
 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.490
Will is the director of the
Yale International Center for

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.437
Finance,
and like Jim,

00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:44.310
a Yale College alum,
and again like Jim,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.810
something of a renaissance man.
 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.180
He's going to be talking about
the crash of 2008,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.137
which is a pretty intricate
story, and the Posner is easily

00:03:56.137 --> 00:04:01.681
the best book written about it,
though not easily the easiest

00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:03.310
book written about it.
 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.484
Without further ado,
Jim is a 1973 graduate of Yale

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:18.949
College and let's talk to him
about your life after Yale.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.665
There is life after Yale
College and how it began for you

00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:26.980
and how it carried forward until
the date you arrived at Enron.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.790
Jim Alexander:
 I'll shorten the version.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.430
The details get to be sort of
tedious.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.389
Prof: Only for you,
not for us.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.706
Jim Alexander:
 Okay, well anyway,

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:44.242
I went to HBS because all the
smart people were going into law

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.170
or medicine.
 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.230
I had a primitive sense of
markets and I knew that I should

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.079
avoid the smart people,
much as I did in my classes.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:54.867
I then, from HBS went to Aetna
Life and Casualty,

00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:58.970
investing their money,
bond investment department;

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.540
till my then wife announced
either we could leave Hartford

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.564
or she could leave Hartford,
at which point I sort of

00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:07.410
started searching for a job in
New York,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.189
and landed one at a venerable
old firm called Kuhn,

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:12.670
Loeb &amp; Co.,
may it rest in peace,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.043
which promptly merged out of
existence about nine months

00:05:16.043 --> 00:05:17.269
after I joined it.
 

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:20.699
At the time it merged into
Lehman Brothers,

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.108
at the time I listened to my
uncle, who was a client of

00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:27.639
Lehman, and avoided Lehman.
 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.670
And I went to work at First
Boston;

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.079
another may it rest in peace
actually, sort of firm.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:40.709
Then in an astonishing move of
true idiocy,

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:43.512
I went to back to Lehman in
1981 in their energy department

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:45.350
because I was interested in
energy,

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.064
until Shearson acquired Lehman
and it had all the human

00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:51.788
characteristics of Lehman,
and the economic

00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:54.959
characteristics of Shearson;
i.e., the worst of both worlds.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:59.156
Then I, being the flying
Dutchman of finance,

00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:05.069
went to Drexel until it went
poof and it went broke in 1990.

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.151
I then had one last job in
conventional investment banking

00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:13.661
with a New Orleans firm till the
head of the firm announced that

00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:17.456
I had an "uneconomic
attachment to quality,"

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:22.110
which was about the worst thing
he could say about anyone,

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.065
so I took my quixotic approach
and became a consultant charging

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:32.964
sort of minimum wage by
investment banking standards

00:06:32.964 --> 00:06:35.322
and--
Prof: Which is maximum

00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:37.230
wage by college professor
standards.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.110
Jim Alexander:
 I don't know.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.404
Economic college professor
standards it's not--I think

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.160
Steve Ross makes a lot of money.
 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.009
Prof: He doesn't make it
here or at MIT though.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.149
Jim Alexander:
 That's a separate issue.

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:58.959
Anyway--so I was--one of my
past clients,

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.911
and I was there,
actually, at the start of

00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:03.293
Enron,
because I was there--we helped

00:07:03.293 --> 00:07:07.134
refinance Enron's huge amounts
of debt that were about to go

00:07:07.134 --> 00:07:10.649
into default until we had done
something when the--

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:14.360
when Enron was created in 1984
or 1985,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.028
I think.
 

00:07:16.028 --> 00:07:20.269
One of my clients who had been
at Enron,

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:21.810
I became an
investment--conventional

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.898
investment banking--
I became a consultant to Enron,

00:07:25.898 --> 00:07:30.728
started working on their
attempt to roll up their

00:07:30.728 --> 00:07:36.639
aggregate into one legal entity,
all of their foreign projects.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:42.053
After a while the complexities
were such that virtually no one

00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:47.288
had the institutional memory
required to be able to complete

00:07:47.288 --> 00:07:52.613
the deal except for one or two
people and they needed someone

00:07:52.613 --> 00:07:56.531
who knew what their--
knew the story to be able to

00:07:56.531 --> 00:08:01.497
really stay on with the company,
and they asked me if I wanted

00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:05.370
to do that and I ended up
agreeing.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.810
Then I was there a full nine
months until--

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.363
this was in 1994,
I was there about nine months

00:08:13.363 --> 00:08:15.524
before I,
the general counsel and the

00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:18.730
controller,
all resigned in the fall of

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:19.310
1995.
 

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.187
Prof: So you spent those
nine months, all of them,

00:08:23.187 --> 00:08:27.271
I think, as Chief Financial
Officer of Enron Global Pipeline

00:08:27.271 --> 00:08:28.379
&amp; Power?
 

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:31.045
Jim Alexander:
 Yes I was--those nine

00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:34.392
months were spent at the
subsidiary level as the CFO of

00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:37.428
this one little subsidiary
company of theirs.

00:08:37.428 --> 00:08:43.649
But during that time anyone who
walked the halls of Enron could

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:49.235
pick up lots of information,
and the only issue was whether

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:54.427
you wanted to ignore it or not,
and of course a lot of people's

00:08:54.427 --> 00:08:58.486
excellent livelihoods depended
on their ignoring the

00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:02.149
information freely available in
the halls,

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:06.230
which turned out generally to
be quite accurate.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.693
Prof: Was the ethical
texture of Enron noticeably

00:09:11.693 --> 00:09:17.953
different from the general mind
run of investment banking as you

00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:20.240
had experienced it?
 

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.731
Jim Alexander:
 Well that's an excellent

00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:22.090
question.
 

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:28.028
The problem is there--you can
either trace a declining curve--

00:09:28.028 --> 00:09:32.413
constantly declining curve in
investment banking from the time

00:09:32.413 --> 00:09:35.288
I entered investment banking in
1975,

00:09:35.288 --> 00:09:41.296
or postulate a somewhat easier,
sort of old style investment

00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:43.740
banking and new style.
 

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.190
The old style really was a
gentleman's game,

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.509
I'm not talking about pre-SEC,
pre-1929 crash,

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:55.538
but certainly when I entered
there was an old generation that

00:09:55.538 --> 00:09:58.590
was quite ethical,
upright, and gentlemanly.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:04.683
Of course those people died out
or were pushed off the edge and

00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:09.106
were replaced by people quite a
different ilk,

00:10:09.106 --> 00:10:12.450
who were much more like Enron.
 

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.490
Prof: Much more like
Enron?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.480
Jim Alexander:  Yeah.
 

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.317
Prof: So Enron is a very
young entity,

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:20.929
and grew up in the period after
the fall, so to speak?

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:24.019
Jim Alexander:  Yes.
 

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:25.201
Prof: would you let them
off the hook a little about that

00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:25.370
or not?
 

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.710
Jim Alexander:
 Enron off the hook?

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.158
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:10:28.158 --> 00:10:29.428
Jim Alexander:
 In--by what?

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:30.379
Prof: I don't think you
will.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:31.528
Jim Alexander:
 By saying,

00:10:31.528 --> 00:10:33.250
how would I let them off the
hook, by the way?

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.331
Prof: Well you'd say
they were brought up by wolves

00:10:37.331 --> 00:10:39.840
and therefore behave like
wolves.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.980
Their--all the advice they got
was--

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.499
Jim Alexander:
 Well if you are a wolf you

00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:44.669
are typically brought up by
wolves.

00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:47.048
Prof: That's correct.
 

00:10:47.048 --> 00:10:50.046
Jim Alexander:
 The--one of the things as

00:10:50.046 --> 00:10:52.470
I've been listening to your
course,

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.720
all the lectures and looking at
the readings,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.160
one of the things that I've
been trying to piece in my own

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.230
mind together is:
What went wrong?

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.413
When did, in the course of
development of the theory of

00:11:08.413 --> 00:11:12.456
capitalism,
did the theoreticians decide

00:11:12.456 --> 00:11:19.187
there was no need for morality,
and when did morality get

00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:22.009
replaced by efficiency?
 

00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:33.270
At Enron it would be a
situation where the ethical

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:39.094
extremes--
the ethical environment was so

00:11:39.094 --> 00:11:44.813
completely different that it
begs the question of what is

00:11:44.813 --> 00:11:46.039
morality?
 

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.240
And what do we base it on?
 

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.105
Because the people who work
there would find any concepts of

00:11:54.105 --> 00:11:58.559
morality laughable and merely a
trap for the unwary.

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:02.158
Prof: Fascinating.
 

00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:07.980
The case has lots of jargon in
it that is business speak,

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.455
and Leslie Hough and some
others have suggested that it

00:12:12.455 --> 00:12:17.511
might be useful to go through
some of that background language

00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:22.105
before we do the case,
and I'm going to descend to the

00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:24.690
audience and take in the
lecture.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.678
Jim Alexander:  Lecture!?
 

00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:32.712
Well--anyway--well Enron,
like a number of other firms,

00:12:32.712 --> 00:12:37.741
got very involved in
commodities and commodity

00:12:37.741 --> 00:12:42.100
financing, and commodity
contracts.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:48.690
If you're the typical commodity
small producer--

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:54.168
often times over leveraged,
hand to mouth existence,

00:12:54.168 --> 00:12:58.626
really can't take a big flying
leap and then hope to make a lot

00:12:58.626 --> 00:13:01.028
of money--
what you typically start to do

00:13:01.028 --> 00:13:03.340
is, in the case of an oil and
gas producer,

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.570
let's say gas producer in
particular,

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.182
I have a general view as to
what I'm going to produce each

00:13:09.182 --> 00:13:09.690
month.
 

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.441
These are prices not production
amounts, but I have a general

00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:16.191
idea of what I'm going to
produce in January,

00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:17.879
February and on and on.
 

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:19.658
It's very hard to shut down a
gas well,

00:13:19.658 --> 00:13:23.947
it's typically not really done,
you typically just produce flat

00:13:23.947 --> 00:13:27.683
out and then try to do the best
you can with your price

00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:28.860
realizations.
 

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.979
When I know I'm going to be
producing a certain amount,

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:35.330
and the first question is okay
do I take a flyer or not?

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.538
Most people who have a lot of
debt or are squeezed for other

00:13:38.538 --> 00:13:42.176
reasons don't take a flyer,
so what they do is they can go

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:46.346
to a commodities broker and say,
what price will you give me for

00:13:46.346 --> 00:13:48.610
each month for the rest of the
year?

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:54.048
Or else they can go to a
commodities exchange and get the

00:13:54.048 --> 00:13:55.408
same result.
 

00:13:55.408 --> 00:13:59.817
What they do is they'll say,
okay, I'll sell you the

00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:05.177
equivalent of 1,000 barrels of
oil and gas terms in January for

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:08.428
$5,
equivalent price in February,

00:14:08.428 --> 00:14:13.283
and it'll be slightly declining
in spring as a result of

00:14:13.283 --> 00:14:18.850
expected lack of demand for gas,
than it'll level out in summer

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.320
and then it'll start going up.
 

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.001
The commodities broker will
commit to buy a certain amount

00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:27.070
each month.
 

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.278
Now if you're the producer
though,

00:14:30.278 --> 00:14:32.940
there's only one problem:
you don't--

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.014
you expect to be able to
produce, but what if something

00:14:35.014 --> 00:14:36.090
goes wrong with your well?
 

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.341
Well if something goes wrong
with your well you're committed

00:14:39.341 --> 00:14:40.500
to sell each month.
 

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.522
What often times will happen is
that instead of actually

00:14:44.522 --> 00:14:48.178
committing to sell a certain
amount each month,

00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:53.769
the producer will buy a put so
that in case the price does go

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:59.544
down he can make money but he's
not obligated to sell a certain

00:14:59.544 --> 00:15:00.570
volume.
 

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.826
What you start doing is having
many variations on a theme of

00:15:04.826 --> 00:15:09.230
helping producers and consumers
who are on the other side,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.024
who also want to hedge,
they want to determine their

00:15:12.024 --> 00:15:13.230
costs of goods sold.
 

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.000
You start having very many
types of mechanisms,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.931
contractual mechanisms to allow
producers to fix to varying

00:15:21.931 --> 00:15:27.658
extents the likelihood of
certain outcomes for their firm

00:15:27.658 --> 00:15:32.330
for the year,
and they get hugely complex.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.210
This is just the start.
 

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.509
There are huge numbers of
variations on the theme;

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:41.320
ways that you can lock in
certain types of spreads,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.663
ways that you can hedge all
sorts of variables beyond just

00:15:45.663 --> 00:15:48.178
the price in south Louisiana.
 

00:15:48.178 --> 00:15:53.038
That's what Enron got in the
business of doing.

00:15:53.038 --> 00:15:56.322
If you look at it the first
twelve months there's a very

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:57.645
broad,
liquid market,

00:15:57.645 --> 00:16:00.399
whether it was done by the
commodity exchanges,

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:03.652
or competing traders,
everyone--a very clear forward

00:16:03.652 --> 00:16:05.418
market,
everyone can see this.

00:16:05.418 --> 00:16:13.340
If you're looking at taking
positions as an Enron,

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.308
to the extent they relate to
widely traded commodities,

00:16:17.308 --> 00:16:21.220
in short periods of time going
into the future,

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.120
it's very obvious what you have.
 

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.250
You can tell whether you're
making money every day by what

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.216
happens to the commodity
relative to the risk positions

00:16:29.216 --> 00:16:30.700
you've put yourself in.
 

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:35.548
That's--if Enron had stayed
with this type of situation,

00:16:35.548 --> 00:16:39.693
they wouldn't have made a lot
of apparent money,

00:16:39.693 --> 00:16:42.340
but they'd be alive today.
 

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.926
It's a tough business,
it's a low margin business,

00:16:45.926 --> 00:16:50.097
but you can make a lot of money
in it if you stick to your

00:16:50.097 --> 00:16:51.048
knitting.
 

00:16:51.048 --> 00:16:54.739
If you want to make a lot of
money very quickly,

00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:57.879
you start looking at other
approaches.

00:16:57.879 --> 00:17:05.440
If you sort of look--and this
is for a trading company,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.915
and manufacturing companies
have different types of

00:17:08.915 --> 00:17:12.023
situations--
but you start with the lowest

00:17:12.023 --> 00:17:15.190
risk type of asset and that
would be cash.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:22.218
Presumably fairly highly rated,
short-term loans to the best

00:17:22.218 --> 00:17:27.460
types of corporations,
or ideally the U.S.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.902
Government;
that's great but that's a very

00:17:29.902 --> 00:17:30.838
low return asset.
 

00:17:30.838 --> 00:17:34.308
Marketable securities,
still very liquid,

00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:39.108
but you're starting to increase
the volatility of the returns,

00:17:39.108 --> 00:17:44.573
and you can make more money
here, but it's another place

00:17:44.573 --> 00:17:48.115
where you have to--
you really have an information

00:17:48.115 --> 00:17:48.650
advantage.
 

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.825
What we're doing is we're
descending--we're going from

00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:55.358
things that are easily valued to
more and more difficult.

00:17:55.358 --> 00:17:58.411
Exchange traded derivatives,
that's the type of thing I was

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:01.695
talking about where you have a--
it's called a forward market

00:18:01.695 --> 00:18:04.582
where people can sell or buy
commodities for very clear

00:18:04.582 --> 00:18:07.681
prices,
and it's very well known what

00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:12.329
exactly the market is,
although the farther you go out

00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:15.670
on the forward market,
the less liquid it is.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:21.325
Even here we're starting to get
to a situation where I know that

00:18:21.325 --> 00:18:24.756
I've committed to--
say, if I'm an Enron I've

00:18:24.756 --> 00:18:28.467
committed to buy the equivalent
of a million barrels of oil a

00:18:28.467 --> 00:18:32.808
year out;
well, how do you value that?

00:18:32.808 --> 00:18:36.134
You get one value if you're
saying well, I'm going to

00:18:36.134 --> 00:18:38.692
liquidate it,
and another value if you're

00:18:38.692 --> 00:18:41.568
saying how much would someone
pay for it.

00:18:41.568 --> 00:18:44.463
So even there you're starting
to have divergences in terms of

00:18:44.463 --> 00:18:46.779
how you look at value,
which can be exploited.

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:50.733
Then we started going--as we
get further down in terms of the

00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:55.250
levels of certainty,
you have certain types of

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:59.170
derivatives like options,
which might,

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.608
instead of being a year out,
might be five years out.

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:06.088
People can take these sorts of
algorithms,

00:19:06.088 --> 00:19:10.753
useful in inferring--or infer
the algorithm from the existing

00:19:10.753 --> 00:19:15.073
trading of short-term options,
apply them to long term

00:19:15.073 --> 00:19:18.808
options, and you get a value
which is plausible.

00:19:18.808 --> 00:19:23.838
So it's based upon clear market
inputs, but a result which is

00:19:23.838 --> 00:19:28.868
not self evident because there
is no clear trading market.

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:32.316
Finally, and this is what Enron
really got into,

00:19:32.316 --> 00:19:35.910
you have an unimaginably
diverse one off deals.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.170
I'll give you an example.
 

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.327
A family wishes to buy price
protection twenty years out

00:19:40.327 --> 00:19:42.740
against increases in Yale
tuition costs.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.243
That sounds farfetched but
that's the sort of thing that

00:19:47.243 --> 00:19:50.751
Enron was doing--
not with Yale tuition costs but

00:19:50.751 --> 00:19:54.088
taking very exotic situations
and then pricing them.

00:19:54.088 --> 00:20:01.097
I sort of took an example
$40,000 $50,000 $60,000 $70,000

00:20:01.097 --> 00:20:04.075
a year,
year's out, and I'm sure we'd

00:20:04.075 --> 00:20:07.644
all have a point of view as to
how Yale's tuition is going to

00:20:07.644 --> 00:20:08.180
go up.
 

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.445
I mean if it continues constant
it goes up probably about

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:15.789
inflation plus 2% or 3% a year,
you'd have a curve but it would

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:18.644
be very judgmental,
there would be some

00:20:18.644 --> 00:20:22.477
plausibility to it,
but who knows and no one else

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:24.838
is making a market in this.
 

00:20:24.838 --> 00:20:29.140
If you're Enron and you've
staked a huge amount of money,

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.123
for example on this one trade,
how do they decide how much

00:20:32.123 --> 00:20:34.058
money they've made in a given
year?

00:20:34.058 --> 00:20:37.537
Well the answer is they use
their own curves,

00:20:37.537 --> 00:20:41.884
and if they want to make more
money they just change the

00:20:41.884 --> 00:20:43.150
assumptions.
 

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.160
Who's to say they're wrong?
 

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.400
No one, and that was what was
happening.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:56.740
You have one off assets,
risk positions,

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.220
which were nearly impossible to
value,

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:04.602
where the ability to recognize
income could be affected with

00:21:04.602 --> 00:21:06.608
the stroke of a pen.
 

00:21:06.608 --> 00:21:12.721
If you're able to recognize
income pretty much any way you

00:21:12.721 --> 00:21:16.462
want,
perversely your view of the

00:21:16.462 --> 00:21:21.250
risk of that type of asset--
it'll slowly start creeping

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:25.131
into your mind that it's a low
risk asset because it always has

00:21:25.131 --> 00:21:28.950
this wonderful profitability
that never seems to go down,

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.140
never problematic.
 

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.394
Now normally you would expect
external auditors to question

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:37.917
these assumptions,
but Arthur Andersen was making

00:21:37.917 --> 00:21:41.000
$50 million bucks a year off of
Enron;

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.450
are they going to question
anything?

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.868
No.
 

00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:49.058
They could basically create
income any time they want.

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:51.337
The problem,
though, is you end up having

00:21:51.337 --> 00:21:54.700
increasing divergence between
the income you're creating and

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.163
cash,
real cash flow,

00:21:56.163 --> 00:21:59.675
and you're having increasing
divergence between what I might

00:21:59.675 --> 00:22:03.308
call the intrinsic risk of an
asset category and the risk that

00:22:03.308 --> 00:22:06.702
you perceive based upon your own
manipulative control over

00:22:06.702 --> 00:22:08.490
recognition of profits.
 

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:14.925
That becomes the source of
Enron's own downfall is that

00:22:14.925 --> 00:22:21.242
they--right at the start of each
transaction they were

00:22:21.242 --> 00:22:24.700
manipulating the numbers.
 

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.828
It wasn't a top down type of
adjustment like Worldcom,

00:22:27.828 --> 00:22:30.701
where basically all the people
at the subsidiary level were

00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:33.144
doing honest things,
and then at the top they

00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:35.098
started monkeying with the
results.

00:22:35.098 --> 00:22:38.969
At Enron every single
transaction was gamed to figure

00:22:38.969 --> 00:22:42.557
out how it could create income,
maximize income,

00:22:42.557 --> 00:22:46.759
short term income,
but once you start doing that

00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:50.612
it starts becoming harder,
and harder, and harder to

00:22:50.612 --> 00:22:52.266
figure out,
well, where should I be

00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:53.220
investing my money?
 

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.478
Where should I be placing
my--how should I be adjusting my

00:22:56.478 --> 00:22:57.450
risk portfolio?
 

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.118
How much debt should I take on?
 

00:22:59.118 --> 00:23:01.273
Because no one has any idea
what the risk is,

00:23:01.273 --> 00:23:03.818
and no one has any idea what
the profitability is.

00:23:03.818 --> 00:23:08.598
That sounds crazy but that's
what it was.

00:23:08.598 --> 00:23:13.011
One of the things--so you have
on the asset side of the

00:23:13.011 --> 00:23:17.832
business where you're actually
taking risks on behalf of the

00:23:17.832 --> 00:23:22.980
firm and working with outsiders
and making money that way,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.579
that was all screwed up.
 

00:23:24.579 --> 00:23:25.730
They had another problem.
 

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:31.349
We have basically--every public
company has to provide annually

00:23:31.349 --> 00:23:36.788
something called a balance
sheet, and an income statement.

00:23:36.788 --> 00:23:41.400
The balance sheet is supposed
to represent the market value,

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.285
but in general terms,
the market value of what you

00:23:45.285 --> 00:23:49.170
own and the obligations you have
to outsiders,

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.115
which offset some of those
assets and give you a net

00:23:53.115 --> 00:23:55.792
result,
which is what the stockholders

00:23:55.792 --> 00:23:57.380
really have in the firm.
 

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.356
You might have a $1,000 worth
of assets, you might have debt,

00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:04.273
long-term debt,
and it could be a mortgage to

00:24:04.273 --> 00:24:05.598
someone of $500.
 

00:24:05.598 --> 00:24:09.162
You subtract that and you get
stockholder's equity because

00:24:09.162 --> 00:24:12.723
stockholders own the residual
when a firm is liquidated of

00:24:12.723 --> 00:24:15.348
$500,
so assets always by definition

00:24:15.348 --> 00:24:18.111
equal the sum of debt--
of liabilities and

00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:19.528
stockholder's equity.
 

00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:23.843
You may say well--if you're
Enron--well, I don't want to

00:24:23.843 --> 00:24:25.490
show all that debt.
 

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.566
What you can do,
and I think the techniques

00:24:28.566 --> 00:24:32.521
would take too long today--I
mean I wasn't set up to go

00:24:32.521 --> 00:24:34.500
through the techniques.
 

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.521
I can if people really want,
but it would have to be another

00:24:37.521 --> 00:24:37.828
day.
 

00:24:37.828 --> 00:24:44.828
Basically the accounting rules,
like the Internal Revenue Code,

00:24:44.828 --> 00:24:48.588
have this series of precise
procedures,

00:24:48.588 --> 00:24:53.880
criteria tests for determining
how accounting will work.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:01.201
The problem with that is that
if you are really smart you can

00:25:01.201 --> 00:25:08.155
figure out how to end up with
the economic equivalent of a

00:25:08.155 --> 00:25:15.232
given treatment but have it
appear just the way you want in

00:25:15.232 --> 00:25:17.430
the account.
 

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:22.811
Right here, I could take this
debt and I could move it and

00:25:22.811 --> 00:25:28.288
associated assets $500 out of
each column and I end up with

00:25:28.288 --> 00:25:33.200
$500 of assets and $500 of
stockholder's equity;

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.618
smaller firm,
to be sure, but no debt.

00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:40.380
There are techniques which
exploit loopholes,

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.488
so that something that is in
economic terms a debt suddenly

00:25:44.488 --> 00:25:48.564
disappears,
or that if I want to be able to

00:25:48.564 --> 00:25:53.538
sell assets to myself I can
create an alter ego,

00:25:53.538 --> 00:25:57.288
something that looks a little
bit like an independent company

00:25:57.288 --> 00:25:58.038
but isn't.
 

00:25:58.038 --> 00:26:01.009
I can recognize gain on the
sale even though I'm really

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:04.094
selling it to myself,
and that's because the

00:26:04.094 --> 00:26:08.666
loopholes in the accounting
allow you to achieve form over

00:26:08.666 --> 00:26:09.710
substance.
 

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.982
To break the code though you
have to have a complacent

00:26:13.982 --> 00:26:17.508
auditor,
and in the case of Arthur

00:26:17.508 --> 00:26:19.700
Andersen,
over half of their services

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.546
weren't even auditing services,
they were consulting services,

00:26:22.546 --> 00:26:24.450
so they were completely bought
off.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:29.539
You also have to have--
Prof: Can you rub that

00:26:29.539 --> 00:26:30.789
point in a little more.
 

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:32.068
Jim Alexander:  Well--
Prof: Make sure they

00:26:32.068 --> 00:26:32.779
don't miss that.
 

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:35.714
Jim Alexander:
 Okay, so the way the

00:26:35.714 --> 00:26:38.720
system worked when I started in
finance,

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:46.230
you had people of high
reputation who were the--

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.170
you might call them sort of the
trust gatekeepers.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.124
They would have included major
accounting firm,

00:26:53.124 --> 00:26:57.336
high quality law firm,
and a high quality board of

00:26:57.336 --> 00:26:58.538
directors.
 

00:26:58.538 --> 00:27:06.316
The problem is that very often
the reality of the--put it

00:27:06.316 --> 00:27:13.537
another way--the perception of
reputation, and trust,

00:27:13.537 --> 00:27:18.118
and quality lags the reality.
 

00:27:18.118 --> 00:27:20.534
In other words,
if you want to make a lot of

00:27:20.534 --> 00:27:23.977
money in a short period of time,
you take a firm that has

00:27:23.977 --> 00:27:28.727
existing good reputation,
and you use that reputation to

00:27:28.727 --> 00:27:34.078
be able to generate high profits
in the short-term.

00:27:34.078 --> 00:27:37.451
The way you do that is you say,
Arthur Anderson,

00:27:37.451 --> 00:27:41.539
well the high quality firm,
so I don't have to worry about

00:27:41.539 --> 00:27:43.980
funny stuff in the accounting.
 

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.740
I don't have to worry if I'm a
reader of those financial

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.009
statements,
an investor,

00:27:47.009 --> 00:27:50.564
I don't have to worry about
whether they're basically

00:27:50.564 --> 00:27:54.527
disguising debt or whether
they're basically creating their

00:27:54.527 --> 00:27:59.279
own earnings out of thin air,
because Arthur Andersen is a

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.880
high quality firm.
 

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.094
Generations of people could
have built up the reputation of

00:28:04.094 --> 00:28:06.788
the firm,
but maintaining a reputation,

00:28:06.788 --> 00:28:10.950
like maintaining a building,
requires a lot of ongoing

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.940
investment.
 

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.603
And if you really want to get a
lot of cash flow in a short

00:28:14.603 --> 00:28:17.614
period of time,
you just let it start to

00:28:17.614 --> 00:28:20.588
disintegrate,
but people won't notice what's

00:28:20.588 --> 00:28:22.950
really going on for a long
period of time,

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:27.818
and while you're fooling them,
you if you're Arthur Andersen,

00:28:27.818 --> 00:28:30.536
and Enron, one of their
clients, can make a lot of

00:28:30.536 --> 00:28:30.980
money.
 

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.380
Because this is easy money.
 

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.310
This is easy,
because basically you don't

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.784
have to create value,
you merely have to engage in an

00:28:37.784 --> 00:28:42.038
exchange with another member of
the capitalist society who

00:28:42.038 --> 00:28:45.000
thinks they're informed,
but isn't.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.366
That's--I mean when we think
about how capitalism creates

00:28:48.366 --> 00:28:51.673
value, to my way of thinking,
its part--it's a series of

00:28:51.673 --> 00:28:53.900
informed and voluntary
exchanges.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.788
What does it mean to be
informed?

00:28:57.788 --> 00:29:02.938
One of the problems with
capitalism as it exists and not

00:29:02.938 --> 00:29:08.647
as I read some of these crazy
economists, is--almost no one is

00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:11.548
true rational economic man.
 

00:29:11.548 --> 00:29:13.769
There are probably a few
geniuses that are,

00:29:13.769 --> 00:29:16.990
but most people don't have the
time,

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.440
don't have the intellect,
or don't have the cynicism to

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.118
understand what they're up
against.

00:29:21.118 --> 00:29:23.890
So they say,
well, a good firm I don't have

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.210
to worry about it.
 

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.220
Well the answer is you do have
to worry about it.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.798
That's why, in my view,
this all came a cropper in the

00:29:31.798 --> 00:29:36.375
last ten or twenty years,
is that the self imposed

00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:42.534
restrictions which limited
short-term self interest kept

00:29:42.534 --> 00:29:47.460
the whole system stable for many
decades.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.710
Once people started to say,
"Well I don't have to

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.949
worry about ethics,
I mean that's--I just have to

00:29:53.949 --> 00:29:57.794
worry about being rational and
realizing my own goals,"

00:29:57.794 --> 00:30:01.573
well the answer at that point
is the whole system starts to

00:30:01.573 --> 00:30:04.090
go,
and this is a perfect example

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.653
because these are people,
the people who engaged in this

00:30:07.653 --> 00:30:10.846
sort of deception,
did not have any ethics and

00:30:10.846 --> 00:30:13.910
would actually view ethics as
laughable.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.238
That's really important to
realize what people are up

00:30:17.238 --> 00:30:20.006
against and that is--
their view is if they're

00:30:20.006 --> 00:30:23.136
creating economic efficiency
even though they lost sight of

00:30:23.136 --> 00:30:25.358
that too,
who cares about ethics?

00:30:25.358 --> 00:30:27.328
Ethics is another constraint of
the little man.

00:30:27.328 --> 00:30:36.461
Prof: Let's just make
sure you link this to off

00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:40.769
balance sheet accounts.
 

00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:42.259
Did you see the connection
there?

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:46.655
Jim Alexander:
 The techniques

00:30:46.655 --> 00:30:49.710
are--they're intricate.
 

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:56.529
I was going to bring a piece of
paper and have it xeroxed but

00:30:56.529 --> 00:31:03.462
it's a diagram of a transaction
among eight different entities

00:31:03.462 --> 00:31:08.920
involving probably 1,500 pages
of documents.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:16.162
To be able to exploit every
loophole possible to create an

00:31:16.162 --> 00:31:20.990
alter ego entity which you
control,

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:25.893
but what looks independent
enough to be able to shuffle off

00:31:25.893 --> 00:31:29.358
maybe a billion dollars worth of
debt,

00:31:29.358 --> 00:31:30.650
a billion dollars worth of
assets.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:37.948
I didn't--it's one of these
things where here's the problem:

00:31:37.948 --> 00:31:44.009
in modern finance one of the
tools of the trade is

00:31:44.009 --> 00:31:45.990
obfuscation.
 

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:54.596
The transactions are meant to
be mind bogglingly complex so

00:31:54.596 --> 00:31:59.592
lesser people,
lesser intellects who rely on

00:31:59.592 --> 00:32:04.108
reputation to simplify their
lives will fall for it.

00:32:04.108 --> 00:32:06.660
They'll say,
"I don't understand this

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.269
stuff, but I know that guy on
the board, now he's a quality

00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:11.140
guy."
 

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.740
The problem then is,
well, how do you know?

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.309
"Well I've asked Joe,
Joe says he's a quality

00:32:17.309 --> 00:32:17.940
guy."
 

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.920
Well how does he know?
 

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.558
How can you ultimately
investigate all these things?

00:32:21.558 --> 00:32:24.220
Well the answer is,
you don't have the time,

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.848
and you may not have the
intellect,

00:32:25.848 --> 00:32:28.751
and you certainly don't have
the money to be able to hire

00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:29.528
people to do.
 

00:32:29.528 --> 00:32:33.720
That's how you can start to
game this whole system because

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.911
there are a lot of people who
expect that the old rules of

00:32:37.911 --> 00:32:41.856
reputation and quality,
which were developed after the

00:32:41.856 --> 00:32:45.380
1929 crash as part of an overall
change in our system,

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.588
still prevailed.
 

00:32:46.588 --> 00:32:49.252
They didn't,
because basically everyone

00:32:49.252 --> 00:32:53.106
started being lulled into this
strange sort of idea that

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:56.987
markets are perfect,
and rational people will always

00:32:56.987 --> 00:33:00.006
come up with the most
economically beneficial

00:33:00.006 --> 00:33:00.828
solution.
 

00:33:00.828 --> 00:33:04.566
I agree with that,
if, in fact,

00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:08.661
there are some limits,
because the fact is,

00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:10.818
when I think of capitalism
creating value,

00:33:10.818 --> 00:33:13.609
I think of it getting around
constraints.

00:33:13.609 --> 00:33:15.578
What types of constraints?
 

00:33:15.578 --> 00:33:20.115
The constraints are physical
constraints, or maybe legal

00:33:20.115 --> 00:33:25.146
constraints where the law really
is sort of a dead letter or a

00:33:25.146 --> 00:33:26.220
bad idea.
 

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.952
Like creating the wheel,
you have a--getting around some

00:33:29.952 --> 00:33:33.347
of the constraints of gravity,
or creating writing,

00:33:33.347 --> 00:33:35.858
getting around other
constraints.

00:33:35.858 --> 00:33:40.074
I mean those are--those in my
way of thinking are very

00:33:40.074 --> 00:33:43.970
beneficial ways of solving--of
problem solving.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.188
The other constraints that
people have started to view as

00:33:48.188 --> 00:33:53.160
just a minor problem for lesser
people, are ethical constraints.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.234
Prof: So there's an
intersection between sheer

00:33:58.234 --> 00:34:01.750
complexity and ethical
relaxation?

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:07.519
A year ago when things got
really ugly,

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:12.416
Steve Schwartzman put together
a little roundtable which I

00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:16.963
attended in New York,
and Nancy Peretsman made the

00:34:16.963 --> 00:34:22.021
most interesting point,
which is the one you just made,

00:34:22.021 --> 00:34:26.240
that if there are asset
categories which are so

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.010
intricate that nobody has really
worked through,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:35.041
nobody has really worked
through all the mechanics of the

00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:39.503
thing in a way that allows them
to understand the impact of all

00:34:39.503 --> 00:34:44.753
the variables of the system,
then the--all the sort of

00:34:44.753 --> 00:34:51.420
market mechanisms which enforce
a degree of rationality are

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.559
disconnected from the
instrument.

00:34:55.559 --> 00:34:58.784
Jim Alexander:
 Yes, I agree that if

00:34:58.784 --> 00:35:02.704
there's--
if you had accountants and

00:35:02.704 --> 00:35:08.666
boards of directors who,
in effect, did not give traders

00:35:08.666 --> 00:35:13.449
the benefit of the doubt,
it probably would be okay.

00:35:13.449 --> 00:35:18.427
But the fact is most people
will give the benefit of the

00:35:18.427 --> 00:35:23.858
doubt to people they view as
smarter, and that is--that's the

00:35:23.858 --> 00:35:25.940
road to extinction.
 

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.710
Prof: Right,
that is the road to extinction.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.530
Let's talk about the road to
Houston.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.731
You--the book,
Smartest Guys in the

00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:38.971
Room, where you are referred
to, at one point,

00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:43.989
as the fly in the ointment from
Enron's point of view.

00:35:43.989 --> 00:35:49.184
The most conspicuous characters
there are Lay,

00:35:49.184 --> 00:35:51.840
Skilling, and Fastow.
 

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.539
Tell us a little bit about
those guys.

00:35:56.539 --> 00:36:01.869
Jim Alexander:
 Well Lay was someone who

00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:06.039
always operated from 30,000
feet,

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:10.329
a big picture guy,
super--all about strategy,

00:36:10.329 --> 00:36:13.590
never got into the operating
details,

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.920
never really wanted to know
anything.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.596
If you produced consistent
results, there were absolutely

00:36:18.596 --> 00:36:19.599
no questions asked.
 

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:23.300
He didn't want to know.
 

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.469
Prof: Decent guy in your
impression?

00:36:25.469 --> 00:36:30.250
Jim Alexander:
 He was at least as nice as

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.840
most people I met,
yeah.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:39.199
Prof: How do nice and
decent connect in your mind?

00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:42.619
Jim Alexander:
 Not at all but--

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:46.340
Prof: Okay so he was--
Jim Alexander:

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.489
 --decent,
decent I mean

00:36:48.489 --> 00:36:53.420
that's--interpersonally he was
not abrasive that's one way.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.010
Prof: Okay.
 

00:36:55.010 --> 00:37:05.347
Jim Alexander:
 Skilling was the genius,

00:37:05.347 --> 00:37:16.809
true genius who spanned a huge
range of intellectual

00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:20.179
expertises.
 

00:37:20.179 --> 00:37:24.916
There are a lot of people in
life who can only look at the

00:37:24.916 --> 00:37:28.239
details, but are very good at
details;

00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:31.740
and there are other people who
seem only to be able to grasp

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.530
the big picture,
but then cannot convert it into

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.369
actual specifics of action.
 

00:37:36.369 --> 00:37:39.954
Skilling was able to move
seamlessly from the most

00:37:39.954 --> 00:37:43.684
detailed aspects of each
transaction to the broadest

00:37:43.684 --> 00:37:48.219
reach of corporate vision in a
way I've never seen before.

00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:51.570
He was very, very skilled.
 

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.503
Prof: So he was,
quite literally,

00:37:53.503 --> 00:37:55.039
the smartest guy in the room?
 

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:57.269
Jim Alexander:
 Yes, I think he was.

00:37:57.269 --> 00:37:59.809
Prof: As for Fastow?
 

00:37:59.809 --> 00:38:04.413
Jim Alexander:
 Arthur Andersen has been

00:38:04.413 --> 00:38:10.016
killed off, so one cannot--one
can without legal risk say

00:38:10.016 --> 00:38:14.420
whatever you want about Arthur
Andersen.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:20.458
There are others that--there's
another party that I'll leave it

00:38:20.458 --> 00:38:25.329
as the elephant in the room,
that helped Fastow.

00:38:25.329 --> 00:38:29.949
Let's just say that the
professionals who should have

00:38:29.949 --> 00:38:34.393
been showing some small degree
of allegiance to the

00:38:34.393 --> 00:38:39.547
shareholders instead helped
Fastow concoct all these gnarly

00:38:39.547 --> 00:38:42.423
schemes,
because he himself was

00:38:42.423 --> 00:38:44.389
completely unable to do so.
 

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:48.570
He was just someone who was
a--like Rosencrantz and

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:52.248
Guildenstern,
one of the indifferent children

00:38:52.248 --> 00:38:53.670
of the earth.
 

00:38:53.670 --> 00:39:01.030
Prof: He was not a peer
of Skilling's?

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.769
Jim Alexander:
 No, he was a joke.

00:39:02.769 --> 00:39:04.360
He was a joke.
 

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.250
He was a foil.
 

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.659
All he was--he was--you had to
have somebody that was basically

00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:13.070
in there in addition to the
professionals from the outside,

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:17.670
and he was there but he didn't
do anything.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.496
Prof: Fastow gets
positioned on both sides of many

00:39:20.496 --> 00:39:22.010
transactions,
was his story.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:27.646
And they talked their way
through the obvious conflict of

00:39:27.646 --> 00:39:34.090
interest by claiming his special
expertise justifies the role.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.215
Jim Alexander:
 They were able to get

00:39:36.215 --> 00:39:39.083
deals done much more quickly
because he knows the assets so

00:39:39.083 --> 00:39:39.530
well.
 

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:43.391
Prof: Now--
Jim Alexander:

00:39:43.391 --> 00:39:45.023
 So they waived the
corporate conflict of interest

00:39:45.023 --> 00:39:45.699
policy in his case.
 

00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:52.547
Prof: Now if Skilling
and Lay had been able to program

00:39:52.547 --> 00:39:58.481
you entirely as they wished
would your role have been

00:39:58.481 --> 00:40:02.018
analogous to Fastow's role?
 

00:40:02.018 --> 00:40:03.025
Jim Alexander:
 Sure, sure,

00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:03.239
sure.
 

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:11.563
Skilling asked me to--in effect
to be Fastow when I started at

00:40:11.563 --> 00:40:13.452
EPP,
and I just said,

00:40:13.452 --> 00:40:17.014
"No I was hired to be CFO
of EPP and that's all I'm going

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:17.889
to do."
 

00:40:17.889 --> 00:40:22.956
Prof: Okay,
so let's talk about the early

00:40:22.956 --> 00:40:27.809
days when you're in the role of
CFO at EPP.

00:40:27.809 --> 00:40:32.900
How does the--what's it like
when you get up in the morning

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.849
and go to work,
and the phone rings and you're

00:40:36.849 --> 00:40:39.570
off to the day's adventure.
 

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.344
Jim Alexander:
 Well, all right,

00:40:42.344 --> 00:40:46.070
so EPP was 51% owned by Enron,
49% by the public.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:53.266
The--while I was the CFO and
then later President of EPP,

00:40:53.266 --> 00:41:00.463
the CEO and Chairman of the
Board was Rod Gray who was an

00:41:00.463 --> 00:41:06.085
executive at Enron;
the parent is where he made

00:41:06.085 --> 00:41:09.539
most of his money from the
parent.

00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:16.125
What would happen is that Rod
would come up with some new

00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:22.592
scheme for Enron to be able to
dump some expenses on the

00:41:22.592 --> 00:41:25.791
minority--
on EPP, but really I wasn't

00:41:25.791 --> 00:41:28.065
concerned about Enron,
I was concerned about the

00:41:28.065 --> 00:41:28.889
minority shareholders.
 

00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:31.835
Minority shareholders,
which was not theirs to pay in

00:41:31.835 --> 00:41:35.472
my view,
and maybe once a week he would

00:41:35.472 --> 00:41:41.802
come up with some new scheme and
maybe over the first six months

00:41:41.802 --> 00:41:48.030
it probably totaled $50 or $75
million dollars worth of schemes

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:52.449
that we just had to keep
shooting down.

00:41:52.449 --> 00:41:56.376
Of course once he did that,
every time Enron wanted to sell

00:41:56.376 --> 00:42:00.456
us a project,
the process being so tainted,

00:42:00.456 --> 00:42:06.242
we had to trade very hard
because in effect I was trading

00:42:06.242 --> 00:42:08.309
with my own boss.
 

00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:20.039
Prof: What risks did you
feel yourself exposed too in

00:42:20.039 --> 00:42:23.420
that situation?
 

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:27.523
Jim Alexander:
 Well I didn't worry about

00:42:27.523 --> 00:42:31.889
legal risks because I was doing
the right thing.

00:42:31.889 --> 00:42:34.309
I just assumed I had no career,
I was going to have no career.

00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:40.079
But on the other hand,
it was a little company,

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:44.786
and I had helped father this
little company that Enron was

00:42:44.786 --> 00:42:48.844
trying to tear apart,
and so I would be goddamned if

00:42:48.844 --> 00:42:53.199
they were going to get away with
it until they finally announced

00:42:53.199 --> 00:42:56.380
they were taking away my
accounting staff,

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.893
and than they were going to
bill me for the cost but have

00:42:59.893 --> 00:43:02.780
them report to Skilling's group
and that's--

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.768
Prof: That's a
convenient--

00:43:03.768 --> 00:43:05.380
Jim Alexander:
 That was very convenient.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.025
At that point the general
counsel, the controller and I

00:43:08.025 --> 00:43:08.760
all resigned.
 

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:16.369
By the way, the only disclosure
of a resignation was mine.

00:43:16.369 --> 00:43:18.724
They never disclosed the fact
that general counsel resigned or

00:43:18.724 --> 00:43:19.730
the controller resigned.
 

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:26.030
The person who replaced me
ultimately indicted--

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.730
I'm not sure whether she was
sent to jail,

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:33.648
indicted, paid a big fine,
and I think turned state's

00:43:33.648 --> 00:43:34.690
evidence.
 

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.335
Prof: There was one more
sentencing to prison this very

00:43:37.335 --> 00:43:37.639
week.
 

00:43:37.639 --> 00:43:39.780
Jim Alexander:
 I saw that.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.119
Yeah I know I thought it was
all over.

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:44.961
Prof: Now Spinnaker
Exploration was the next chapter

00:43:44.961 --> 00:43:46.420
for you, am I right?
 

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:51.336
Jim Alexander:
 Yeah, I helped start

00:43:51.336 --> 00:43:56.018
Spinnaker the year after I got
fired--

00:43:56.018 --> 00:43:58.340
or actually that--my position
is I was fired,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.650
their position is I quit at
Enron.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:05.043
It was a--just as Enron was
based on making money off of

00:44:05.043 --> 00:44:09.454
false information,
Spinnaker was an attempt to

00:44:09.454 --> 00:44:13.280
make money off of good
information.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.429
It's completely different ways
of playing information.

00:44:17.429 --> 00:44:20.032
Prof: Give us the
capsule of the business model

00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:20.820
for Spinnaker.
 

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.393
Jim Alexander:
 It was a--it was engaged

00:44:23.393 --> 00:44:27.146
in exploration for oil,
mostly gas in the Gulf of

00:44:27.146 --> 00:44:32.199
Mexico, with the basic strategic
point of view that most

00:44:32.199 --> 00:44:35.690
independent oil and gas
companies,

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.387
whether through the
overconfidence of their CEOs or

00:44:39.387 --> 00:44:42.646
macho man mentality,
systematically undervalue

00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:45.643
information,
and would rather drill ten dry

00:44:45.643 --> 00:44:49.750
holes than spend 10% of the
money buying a good data set.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:54.697
So we got the best data we
could, seismic data which allows

00:44:54.697 --> 00:44:59.643
you probable inferences about
the structures underneath the

00:44:59.643 --> 00:45:04.590
earth and sometimes some direct
insight into whether gas is

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:05.699
around.
 

00:45:05.699 --> 00:45:07.369
Anyway, we bought a lot of
seismic data,

00:45:07.369 --> 00:45:09.349
spent a lot of time with
processing,

00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:13.115
spent a lot of time making sure
we had the best exploration

00:45:13.115 --> 00:45:17.666
group we could find,
and went into business on that

00:45:17.666 --> 00:45:18.380
basis.
 

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:24.409
Consistent with our view that
information is key,

00:45:24.409 --> 00:45:27.989
not only do we try to get the
best external information,

00:45:27.989 --> 00:45:32.105
but we also made sure that
internally there was a free flow

00:45:32.105 --> 00:45:34.641
of information so that,
for example,

00:45:34.641 --> 00:45:37.931
every Monday we had a meeting
with all the employees where

00:45:37.931 --> 00:45:40.010
everything was up for
discussion.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.659
There were no questions barred
and all the answers were candid

00:45:43.659 --> 00:45:47.367
on the basis that it doesn't do
any good to have great external

00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:50.480
information if the internal
flows are not good,

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.362
and the internal flows won't be
good unless you truly care about

00:45:54.362 --> 00:45:55.780
what employees think.
 

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.858
Prof: Spinnaker was
actually--was and is a quite

00:45:59.858 --> 00:46:01.518
spectacular success.
 

00:46:01.518 --> 00:46:03.548
Jim Alexander:
 Well it was bought by

00:46:03.548 --> 00:46:06.286
Norsk Hydro a couple of years
ago but it was a multibillion

00:46:06.286 --> 00:46:08.599
dollar company certainly when it
was bought,

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:12.056
and it was started in a $50
million dollar venture capital

00:46:12.056 --> 00:46:13.268
deal at the start.
 

00:46:13.268 --> 00:46:19.083
Prof: Spinnaker,
I've heard you say,

00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:27.664
that Spinnaker was the inverse
of every decision rule common to

00:46:27.664 --> 00:46:29.050
Enron.
 

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.947
Jim Alexander:
 Whenever we weren't sure

00:46:30.947 --> 00:46:32.679
what to do, we thought what
would Enron do,

00:46:32.679 --> 00:46:33.630
we did the reverse.
 

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:42.242
Prof: Well that's--let's
finish we've got about 90

00:46:42.242 --> 00:46:43.780
seconds.
 

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:51.333
Let's finish with--Jim is a
scholar of the Old Testament at

00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:54.849
the Yale Divinity School.
 

00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:57.260
Jim Alexander:
 Scholar is a little

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.320
strong--student.
 

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:03.514
Prof: I don't know many
people who have read as many

00:47:03.514 --> 00:47:08.530
sources on arcane aspects of the
Old Testament as you.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.099
I think you're pretty serious.
 

00:47:10.099 --> 00:47:12.460
Jim Alexander:
 I like esoterica of all

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:12.880
types.
 

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.860
That's why I was in project
finance.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:23.143
Prof: Give us--are we
all--is American capitalism in a

00:47:23.143 --> 00:47:29.909
state of advanced moral and
ethical decay or--

00:47:29.909 --> 00:47:30.768
Jim Alexander:
 Not necessarily.

00:47:30.768 --> 00:47:34.438
If people can grasp the
requirements,

00:47:34.438 --> 00:47:39.739
the need for ethics just to
keep the system going.

00:47:39.739 --> 00:47:42.693
If people don't come to grips
with that I think it's just

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:44.329
going to get worse and worse.
 

00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:47.010
Prof: There's a big
point there.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:52.184
Think now back to Smith's
invisible hand,

00:47:52.184 --> 00:47:59.559
and to Hayek and the creative
powers of a free society.

00:47:59.559 --> 00:48:05.753
All of that thinking has built
into it at the very most basic

00:48:05.753 --> 00:48:12.052
level, an assumption about truth
telling and access to broadly

00:48:12.052 --> 00:48:14.530
correct information.
 

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:23.530
And every single tenant of the
tradition which runs from Adam

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:31.329
Smith through modern economics
is founded on that.

00:48:31.329 --> 00:48:35.329
And for Smith the ethical side
was explicit with a theory of

00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:36.550
moral sentiment.
 

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:41.458
The way economics is taught,
and the way business management

00:48:41.458 --> 00:48:46.449
is taught, the emphasis on an
ethical commitment to prove has

00:48:46.449 --> 00:48:48.780
been somewhat submerged.
 

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:55.242
It doesn't have the simple
status for us intellectually

00:48:55.242 --> 00:48:59.670
that it did for Smith's
generation.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.900
I think that's a fair statement.
 

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:08.139
Jim this has been,
as it always is,

00:49:08.139 --> 00:49:15.480
very illuminating,
and even inspiring.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.400
Thank you very much.
 

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.000

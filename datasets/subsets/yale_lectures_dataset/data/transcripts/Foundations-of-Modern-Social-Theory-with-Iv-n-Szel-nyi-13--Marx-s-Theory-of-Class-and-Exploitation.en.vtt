00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.920
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.770
So we got to the end of Karl
Marx today.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.811
And after a long detour we are
finally at the Marx you are

00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:22.170
probably the most familiar with,
or the kind of Marx you have

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.820
heard the most about.
 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.850
The major-- my major aim so far
in this course was to shake a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.880
little the stereotypes which was
in your head about Marx,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.840
to show you that Marx was a
much more complex thinker,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.550
full with contradictions,
and in a search for truth.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.664
Whether he arrived at truth,
that's another question,

00:00:56.664 --> 00:00:59.180
but he was desperately
searching for it.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.168
So we went around different
epochs of Marx.

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:07.500
Right?
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.864
In The Paris
Manuscripts,

00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:16.617
the first attempt to write a
big work, we saw him as a

00:01:16.617 --> 00:01:18.030
Hegelian.
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.980
The central concept is still
alienation, a Hegelian concept.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.780
Then he breaks away. Right?
 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.215
He turns into a historical
materialist in The German

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:35.543
Ideology,
but does not quite get it yet.

00:01:35.543 --> 00:01:36.550
Right?
 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.120
Too much under the influence of
Adam Smith.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.501
The division of labor is still
important and private property

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.641
does not get the centrality of
the analysis,

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:50.000
what it's supposed to have for
the theory.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.459
Then you read the
Grundrisse,

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.676
in which he kind of--now
private property is in the

00:01:57.676 --> 00:02:04.054
central place,
but he tries to bring back the

00:02:04.054 --> 00:02:07.349
idea of alienation.
 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.726
And he also considers that in
The German Ideology he

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:17.808
became too deterministic;
history is more open than he

00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:19.560
may have believed.
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.617
And then finally he finishes
the book--at least the first

00:02:24.617 --> 00:02:29.223
volume of the book he always
wanted to write--Das

00:02:29.223 --> 00:02:30.669
Kapital.
 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:37.154
And in the Kapital,
only the first volume was

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:41.382
finished by him,
and it was the only first

00:02:41.382 --> 00:02:45.080
volume what he thought was ready
for publication,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.020
and came out in 1867.
 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.360
He offers a very coherent,
very cogent argument.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.258
It's not a messy text like the
Paris Manuscript or

00:02:57.258 --> 00:03:01.020
The German Ideology or
the Grundrisse.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.378
Marx felt this is ready to be
printed;

00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:07.468
and it was ready to be printed
for sure.

00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:12.034
And this is now his major
contribution,

00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:15.520
the theory of exploitation.
 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.240
That is undoubtedly Marx's
major contribution to social

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.360
theory.
 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.590
Whether it is right or wrong,
this is another question.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.728
I think there are few people
who would accept his theory of

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:34.940
exploitation the way how it was
formulated.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.962
But there are still quite a few
theorists around here who are

00:03:40.962 --> 00:03:45.681
attracted to the idea of
exploitation and try to

00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:51.304
re-conceptualize the notion of
exploitation in one way or

00:03:51.304 --> 00:03:52.710
another.
 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.347
And it's also something which
has very much entered the public

00:03:57.347 --> 00:03:58.259
discourse.
 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.218
You yourself use it.
 

00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:03.740
Occasionally you feel I have
been exploited.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.447
And it actually has quite a bit
to do with what Marx thought

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.751
about exploitation,
when you say,

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:13.151
"This is an exploitative
relationship."

00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:13.789
Right?
 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.899
So the term is with us.
 

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:21.855
Okay, then of course in order
to have the theory of

00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:26.016
exploitation,
this is necessary for Marx to

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:31.269
have a tight conception of the
theory of classes.

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:36.560
And the text I asked you to
read for his theory of classes

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.459
is an old text,
much precedes the theory of

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:45.009
exploitation,
The Communist Manifesto.

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.410
It's also only a pamphlet,
it is a political pamphlet.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.120
It's not aimed for a scholarly
audience.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.213
It does not argue its case in
the scholarly way,

00:05:00.213 --> 00:05:05.524
as most of the argument is put
forward in the chapters I asked

00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:08.312
you to read from Kapital.
 

00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:09.269
Right?
 

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:14.939
But it has very important
theoretical insights.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:20.761
In fact, though Marx does not
have the theory of exploitation,

00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:25.819
he still comes very close to a
mature class theory.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:31.319
What is interesting though,
today we identify Marx as

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:37.244
certainly one of the great
theorists who created the idea

00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:38.620
of class.
 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.089
The other one is,
by the way, Max Weber.

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:45.209
What is also interesting about
both of them,

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:50.959
that they never wrote any
coherent analysis what class is.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:54.199
Well in The Communist
Manifesto,

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.110
Marx and Engels write a fair
deal about class,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.418
but they don't have the
conceptual apparatus yet really

00:06:03.418 --> 00:06:05.088
to do it right.
 

00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:08.660
And by the time he has,
after he finished the first

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.072
volume of Kapital,
he actually makes an attempt,

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:18.151
what eventually was published
by Engels as the third volume of

00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:19.649
Kapital.
 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:23.898
And here, in chapter 52,
he said, "Now this is time

00:06:23.898 --> 00:06:26.680
to write my theory of
class."

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.790
He writes a page and a half,
and then he abandons it.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.829
He said, "I can't do it;
too difficult." Right?

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:39.952
So it leaves to
you--right?--and the next text--

00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:44.165
test in this course,
to figure out what the right

00:06:44.165 --> 00:06:48.377
theory of classes are,
and what's wrong about it.

00:06:48.377 --> 00:06:49.430
Right?
 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.339
In fact, Weber is pretty much
in the same bind.

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:57.629
He writes a little more than
one-and-a-half page,

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.000
but not much more.
 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.209
We will talk about this when we
come to Max Weber.

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:08.545
But classes certainly still do
haunt us.

00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:09.639
Right?
 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.910
We cannot get the idea of class
out of our hair.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:19.879
Even in the United States the
notion is around us;

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:26.158
though there is no other modern
society which is so free from

00:07:26.158 --> 00:07:31.600
the idea of class and
exploitation as the US of A.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.322
But even in the US of A,
we still talk at least about

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.050
the middle class.
 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.740
So the term is not completely
alien from us.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.797
Okay, so let's jump into this,
and let's do it this time in a

00:07:47.797 --> 00:07:52.045
reverse order--
that I start with the mature

00:07:52.045 --> 00:07:56.963
theory,
1867, and then informed by this

00:07:56.963 --> 00:08:03.651
theory I go back to 1848,
The Communist Manifesto,

00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:05.709
and deal with this.
 

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:11.545
So the major themes for the
lecture today is I want to

00:08:11.545 --> 00:08:17.160
elaborate on the theory of
exploitation in Marx,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:24.482
his idea of classes in history,
and finally to ask the

00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:28.860
question,
how many classes are there?

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.567
Marx seems to have
contradictory answers to this

00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:34.668
question.
 

00:08:34.668 --> 00:08:39.571
And this is certainly a
question which still fascinates

00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:45.198
people who are studying society,
social stratification or class

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:46.470
structure.
 

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:51.053
Of course the answer seems to
be obvious probably to most of

00:08:51.053 --> 00:08:51.519
you.
 

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:55.105
Yeah, in the United States
there is one class,

00:08:55.105 --> 00:08:59.620
the middle class;
we are all middle class. Right?

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.070
That's the typical American
answer to this.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.129
But for an analyst it's a bit
dubious answer;

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:10.019
if there are classes,
how on earth there is only one?

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:13.408
Anyway, we will talk about this
a great deal.

00:09:13.408 --> 00:09:18.548
So let's move to the question
of theory of exploitation.

00:09:18.548 --> 00:09:25.086
And I will have to start this
with the labor theory of value,

00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:30.534
and to go back to Adam Smith
and to see how Marx is

00:09:30.534 --> 00:09:32.168
proceeding.
 

00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:38.495
Then I want to make a step
further, Marx's distinction

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:44.938
between commodity production and
the capitalist mode of

00:09:44.938 --> 00:09:46.730
production.
 

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:52.676
This is again taking his point
of departure as Adam Smith's,

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:56.908
Adam Smith's idea of commercial
society.

00:09:56.908 --> 00:10:00.888
And what Marx does,
well there are different types

00:10:00.888 --> 00:10:03.000
of commercial societies.
 

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.629
One he calls the petty
commodity production,

00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:10.850
and the other one capitalist
mode of production.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.816
As we all know,
he never used the term

00:10:14.816 --> 00:10:16.210
capitalism.
 

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:21.048
He comes the closest to this
concept by using the term

00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:23.970
capitalist mode of production.
 

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:29.522
Neither Smith nor Marx had the
concept of capitalism,

00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:30.590
as such.
 

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:36.133
Then in order to understand
what is unique about the

00:10:36.133 --> 00:10:42.226
capitalist mode of production,
we have to understand Marx's

00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:45.629
theory of labor power as a
commodity.

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:49.605
And I will explain to you why
this is so central to Marx's

00:10:49.605 --> 00:10:52.952
theory of exploitation,
and then Marx's theory of

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:53.649
class.
 

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:56.620
Okay, so that's about it.
 

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.840
And now the labor theory of
value.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:08.043
The point of departure is John
Locke and Adam Smith.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.330
Right?
 

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:15.549
As you recall,
already John Locke suggested

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:21.028
that all value is created by
labor;

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:27.139
or, I mean, he's a little more
cautious, at least 90% of all

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:30.038
value is created by labor.
 

00:11:30.038 --> 00:11:33.759
How on earth he comes up with
this figure?

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:38.177
He's not very accurate about
this, not very forthcoming.

00:11:38.177 --> 00:11:38.820
Right?
 

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.450
Social scientists today would
be a bit upset.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.725
"Where do you get this
number from?"

00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:46.129
Right?
 

00:11:46.129 --> 00:11:48.070
He doesn't tell us.
 

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.419
But the bottom line is well
taken.

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:50.990
Right?
 

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:55.677
You remember
clearly--right?--his wonderful

00:11:55.677 --> 00:11:57.240
proposition.
 

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.879
"The water in the well
belongs to everybody.

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:10.172
But who doubts that those who
fetch it--the water--that water

00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:12.690
belongs to him or her?
 

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:18.178
Because it is his or her
product, labor product.

00:12:18.178 --> 00:12:22.601
And what is the value of that
water, what you are carrying

00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:26.171
away from the well,
what you did fetch from the

00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:26.870
well?
 

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.250
Exactly the amount of labor you
had to put in,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.580
in order to fetch that."
 

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.350
Clear, right?
 

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.236
A nice theory of
property--right?--and a nice

00:12:38.236 --> 00:12:42.654
labor theory of value,
though it's not quite called

00:12:42.654 --> 00:12:45.039
this way by John Locke.
 

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:46.860
But so is by Adam Smith.
 

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.413
And, as you recall,
Adam Smith claims at one point,

00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:57.298
"All value is created by
labor."

00:12:57.298 --> 00:13:07.693
Well but of course Adam Smith,
when he comes to explaining the

00:13:07.693 --> 00:13:16.212
distribution of wealth,
takes a step back from this

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.940
proposition.
 

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.658
And we discussed that when we
discussed Adam Smith.

00:13:22.658 --> 00:13:26.149
Let me just remind you what the
step backward.

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:26.769
Right?
 

00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:32.404
The tension--right?--in Adam
Smith was that on one hand he

00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:36.360
claims all value is created by
labor,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.807
and then when it comes to the
question but how is wealth or

00:13:41.807 --> 00:13:43.779
income distributed.
 

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:50.200
He said, "Well it ought to
be distributed between the three

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.869
factors of
production--right?--labor,

00:13:53.869 --> 00:14:00.700
capital and land;
wages, profit and rent.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.799
And they have to be equally
distributed in a just way,

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:08.436
between these three factors of
production."

00:14:08.436 --> 00:14:09.210
Right?
 

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.418
And I think you remember we
clarified that this is not a

00:14:14.418 --> 00:14:17.259
contradiction in Adam Smith.
 

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:23.386
Somehow when he's claiming that
all value is created by labor,

00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:27.205
he almost has a theory of human
nature.

00:14:27.205 --> 00:14:28.210
Right?
 

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.678
That in the state of nature,
when there is no private

00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:36.803
property of land,
and there is no accumulation of

00:14:36.803 --> 00:14:40.928
capital, then all value is
created by labor.

00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:48.880
But this is just in this
imagined--right?--natural

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.100
conditions of existence.
 

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:58.943
In all complex societies
private ownership exists and

00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:03.889
private--and capital is being
accumulated.

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:08.144
And then, you know,
in order to get production

00:15:08.144 --> 00:15:12.590
going, the capitalist has to
rent--give capital,

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.899
advance capital,
to the worker.

00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:19.668
Without the advancement of
capital, the laborer would not

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:20.139
work.
 

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:25.380
And therefore the owner of
capital has due claim for part

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:31.090
of the value which is created in
the process of production.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:36.448
Because it took
risks--right?--by offering its

00:15:36.448 --> 00:15:39.932
capital,
and it had to supervise the

00:15:39.932 --> 00:15:43.946
labor process,
and wants to have compensated

00:15:43.946 --> 00:15:47.798
for its risk taking and its
supervision.

00:15:47.798 --> 00:15:51.254
And you could not operate
without land,

00:15:51.254 --> 00:15:52.798
without a site.
 

00:15:52.798 --> 00:15:57.840
All activities need a site,
and if somebody owns that site,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.879
they'll have to be compensated
that you are on the site;

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.120
and that is rent.
 

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.200
Well this is a little more
problematic in Adam Smith.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.500
You know, for capital he makes
a pretty strong case,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.971
you know, why it is fair for
the capitalist to collect

00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:17.899
profit.
 

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:22.158
For the owner of the land,
he--they are collecting rent.

00:16:22.158 --> 00:16:26.402
That's a little more
problematic, whether rent is

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:29.230
also something,
a just income.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.788
And we all have a little
unease--right?--when we are

00:16:33.788 --> 00:16:38.077
talking about rent,
or when we are talking about,

00:16:38.077 --> 00:16:41.206
for instance,
rent-seeking behavior.

00:16:41.206 --> 00:16:42.279
Right?
 

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:47.923
That sounds a bad behavior,
if somebody's seeking rent.

00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:48.759
Right?
 

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:54.731
The reason is simple;
because we associate in our

00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:59.032
mind rent-seeking behavior with
monopoly.

00:16:59.032 --> 00:17:00.000
Right?
 

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.590
Rent-seeking behavior comes
from monopolistic ownership,

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.015
and we don't particularly like
monopolies.

00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:08.848
Right?
 

00:17:08.848 --> 00:17:13.740
We want competition,
free competition--right?

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.730
Free markets,
and not monopolies.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.480
Right?
 

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.019
Monopoly's a bad word.
 

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:21.858
Anyway, this is a little of a
problem.

00:17:21.858 --> 00:17:26.058
But nevertheless I think his
fundamental point,

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:29.644
in Adam Smith,
that there is some fair

00:17:29.644 --> 00:17:36.038
distribution of income between
the three factors of production,

00:17:36.038 --> 00:17:43.057
because they are all necessary
for the production for the

00:17:43.057 --> 00:17:45.690
production process.
 

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:51.946
I just suggested that,
in fact, there are still

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:58.476
people, scholars,
who are seriously interested in

00:17:58.476 --> 00:18:03.509
the theory of exploitation
today.

00:18:03.509 --> 00:18:06.930
They usually abandon the labor
theory of value.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.239
I have not met yet an economist
or political economist,

00:18:11.239 --> 00:18:14.750
or even a sociologist or
political scientist,

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.501
who still believes in the labor
theory of value.

00:18:18.501 --> 00:18:19.460
Right?
 

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:24.029
So now therefore when they try
to construct a theory of

00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:27.755
exploitation,
it is more around the theory of

00:18:27.755 --> 00:18:31.480
rent, rather than labor theory
of value.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.699
Okay, then let's move further
and let's try to figure out

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:39.919
how--what Marx does to Adam
Smith, and how he radicalizes

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.048
Adam Smith.
 

00:18:41.048 --> 00:18:46.038
Marx does not want to go the
Adam Smithsian way,

00:18:46.038 --> 00:18:51.557
to say there is a fair
distribution of wealth between

00:18:51.557 --> 00:18:55.380
the three factors of production.
 

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.478
First of all he asks the
question, okay,

00:18:59.478 --> 00:19:01.160
what is value?
 

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:07.240
And he defines value with this
very simple equation.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:12.269
C is constant capital. Right?
 

00:19:12.269 --> 00:19:16.940
Constant capital means the
capital which is advanced by the

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:21.528
capitalist in order to make the
labor process possible.

00:19:21.528 --> 00:19:27.367
Constant capital can of course
involve the improvement on the

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:32.721
land, on the site what you are
using for your production

00:19:32.721 --> 00:19:33.499
process.
 

00:19:33.499 --> 00:19:34.568
Right?
 

00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:37.700
If there is a building put up
on a site,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.961
the cost of the building will
have to be returned in the

00:19:41.961 --> 00:19:46.384
process of production--
right?--and therefore it will

00:19:46.384 --> 00:19:50.240
also contribute to the value of
the product.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.190
V is variable capital.
 

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.390
Variable capital means wages.
 

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:02.410
And S is what he calls surplus
product.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:07.490
This is--you produce a product,
you sell it.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:12.679
It is not enough for you,
in order to be and stay in

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:16.304
business,
if all what you collect a

00:20:16.304 --> 00:20:21.690
return of the capital you
advanced for the production,

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:27.324
and the wages what you paid to
your laborers to complete the

00:20:27.324 --> 00:20:28.278
process.
 

00:20:28.278 --> 00:20:32.270
If you would do that,
you would be done.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.088
Right?
 

00:20:33.088 --> 00:20:39.390
All smart entrepreneurs want to
generate some surplus.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.720
They want to get a little more
than they started with.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.421
Otherwise why on earth would
they waste their time on this?

00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:49.068
Right?
 

00:20:49.068 --> 00:20:51.568
Why on earth would they take
risks?

00:20:51.568 --> 00:20:55.950
Why would they spend their time
supervising the process?

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:01.232
Why would they start worrying
whether this will work out or

00:21:01.232 --> 00:21:01.779
not?
 

00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:03.548
They need a surplus.
 

00:21:03.548 --> 00:21:07.289
So therefore that is the value
of the product.

00:21:07.289 --> 00:21:12.230
Now, and here it is. Right?
 

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.130
Constant capital is investment.
 

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.991
And here there is an
agreement--right?--with Adam

00:21:17.991 --> 00:21:18.474
Smith.
 

00:21:18.474 --> 00:21:19.200
Right?
 

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.680
You have--right?--factors of
production.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.929
But Marx wants to be
consistent--consistent in saying

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:32.269
that all value is being created
by labor.

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:34.621
And he said,
"But what is constant

00:21:34.621 --> 00:21:35.240
capital?
 

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.700
Where does constant capital
come from?"

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.279
He said it is coming from labor.
 

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:44.220
It is accumulated labor.
 

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:49.535
It is labor which was actually
performed before capital

00:21:49.535 --> 00:21:53.141
accumulation,
was appropriated by the

00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:56.779
capitalist,
and it is being now used as

00:21:56.779 --> 00:21:58.440
constant capital.
 

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.317
So there is,
one argument is,

00:22:01.317 --> 00:22:06.147
all capital was at one point a
product of labor,

00:22:06.147 --> 00:22:10.259
and that is what is your
investment.

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:13.880
As I said, variable capital are
wages.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.298
And then there is surplus
product.

00:22:16.298 --> 00:22:20.490
And that surplus product,
Marx argued,

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:27.060
is also the outcome of the
labor process and the product of

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.778
the laborer as such.
 

00:22:29.778 --> 00:22:37.338
So Marx starts to shy away from
the idea that there is a kind of

00:22:37.338 --> 00:22:43.578
fair distribution between
capital, land and labor.

00:22:43.578 --> 00:22:46.837
He said, "No,
I mean, all value is being

00:22:46.837 --> 00:22:48.690
created by labor."
 

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:53.797
So this is his kind of
reconstruction of the labor

00:22:53.797 --> 00:22:58.488
theory of value,
and leads us into the idea of

00:22:58.488 --> 00:22:59.843
exploitation.
 

00:22:59.843 --> 00:23:00.990
Right?
 

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:05.827
I will labor on this in a
minute, to try to put more meat

00:23:05.827 --> 00:23:06.519
on it.
 

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:11.960
But the essence of exploitation
is that what the capitalist will

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.796
advance is actually labor which
was appropriated from the

00:23:16.796 --> 00:23:21.200
workers in an earlier cycle of
the production,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.359
and then the capitalist will
pocket the surplus,

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:29.874
will not give any to the worker;
a worker will be satisfied with

00:23:29.874 --> 00:23:30.660
the wages.
 

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.375
And this is where exploitation
comes from.

00:23:34.375 --> 00:23:35.098
Right?
 

00:23:35.098 --> 00:23:39.877
Exploitation somehow has to do
with what the capitalist had to

00:23:39.877 --> 00:23:42.384
put into the production process.
 

00:23:42.384 --> 00:23:43.088
Right?
 

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:47.684
Constant capital and variable
capital, and how much he

00:23:47.684 --> 00:23:50.980
pocketed after the process was
over.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:56.848
So there is no--nothing fair
about this, in Marx's view.

00:23:56.848 --> 00:24:00.919
This is--right?--the big
difference between social

00:24:00.919 --> 00:24:05.488
democratic trade unions who
wants to keep the capitalist

00:24:05.488 --> 00:24:08.509
system going;
they just want to have

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:11.440
collective bargaining and
negotiation--

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.036
right?--with the employers,
so to have a reasonable level

00:24:16.036 --> 00:24:21.208
of profit to the capitalist and
a reasonably high level of wages

00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:22.848
for the workers.
 

00:24:22.848 --> 00:24:26.410
Marx said, "Well there is
nothing reasonable.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.150
This is a system,
an exploitative system."

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:36.028
Well, and this is what I said:
"The rate of profit will

00:24:36.028 --> 00:24:41.108
be the surplus divided by the
expenditures."

00:24:41.108 --> 00:24:45.640
Okay, let's move a little
further and makes--

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.630
and let's have this important
contribution what Marx makes

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.338
between petty commodity
production and capitalist mode

00:24:53.338 --> 00:24:55.088
of production,
right?

00:24:55.088 --> 00:25:02.285
It's trying to sort of break up
Adam Smith's idea of commercial

00:25:02.285 --> 00:25:07.160
society or market economy or
capitalism.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.528
Marx seemed to have a more
complex notion.

00:25:10.528 --> 00:25:13.795
Well he said this is petty
commodity production,

00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:17.130
and he again offers us a little
equation here.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:22.204
He said petty commodity
production begins with a

00:25:22.204 --> 00:25:27.563
commodity,
and then you go to the

00:25:27.563 --> 00:25:32.769
marketplace,
sell this commodity for money,

00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:35.818
in order to purchase a
commodity.

00:25:35.818 --> 00:25:40.529
This itself is commercial
society.

00:25:40.529 --> 00:25:43.549
This is commodity production.
 

00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:47.269
But it is not capitalism. Right?
 

00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:49.871
This is why Marx,
for instance,

00:25:49.871 --> 00:25:54.205
was a bit uncertain,
and he's rambling about this a

00:25:54.205 --> 00:25:55.160
little.
 

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.387
Is the United States,
in the early nineteenth

00:25:58.387 --> 00:26:01.250
century, really a capitalist
economy?

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.951
And he was puzzled by this
because the overwhelming

00:26:05.951 --> 00:26:10.278
majority of Americans were
actually involved in

00:26:10.278 --> 00:26:12.160
self-employment.
 

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.151
It was a highly commercialized
society, a highly developed

00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:21.180
market economy,
but there was relatively little

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.068
private capital accumulation.
 

00:26:24.068 --> 00:26:29.814
Most people were farmers or
self-employed artisans or

00:26:29.814 --> 00:26:31.140
merchants.
 

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.519
And what did they do?
 

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:36.150
They did produce commodities.
 

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.720
You were a shoemaker,
you produced a shoe.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.896
But you were specializing in
shoemaking, and you did not

00:26:44.896 --> 00:26:51.299
bother you try to also raise
chickens and to have eggs.

00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:52.910
So you needed eggs.
 

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.068
So you brought shoes on the
market,

00:26:56.068 --> 00:27:01.291
you sold the shoe for money,
and then you went to the farmer

00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:05.174
and you bought egg,
so you could have your

00:27:05.174 --> 00:27:06.496
scrambled eggs.
 

00:27:06.496 --> 00:27:07.200
Right?
 

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.941
Okay, that is petty commodity
production.

00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:12.890
Right?
 

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.994
And the purpose of
production--this is a very

00:27:16.994 --> 00:27:22.125
important proposition by
Marx--is satisfaction of needs.

00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:23.058
Right?
 

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:26.704
You are operating,
you are producing stuff because

00:27:26.704 --> 00:27:30.500
you have certain needs what you
want to satisfy,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:36.844
and the production of some
good, well in excess of what you

00:27:36.844 --> 00:27:39.641
need,
has the purpose to satisfy

00:27:39.641 --> 00:27:43.949
other needs what you have,
and money is simply a mediator

00:27:43.949 --> 00:27:47.756
to make sure that different
types of needs are being

00:27:47.756 --> 00:27:50.518
properly exchanged on the
marketplace.

00:27:50.518 --> 00:27:51.338
Right?
 

00:27:51.338 --> 00:27:54.792
Now Marx here is way beyond
Marx of the Paris

00:27:54.792 --> 00:27:58.971
Manuscripts--
right?--who tried to identify

00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:04.730
markets and commodity exchange
as the source of alienation.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.945
There is nothing alienating
about this process.

00:28:08.945 --> 00:28:09.680
Right?
 

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.597
Now but then he said well
capitalism is a different

00:28:14.597 --> 00:28:15.680
ballgame.
 

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.801
We are talking about a
capitalist economy when the

00:28:20.801 --> 00:28:23.519
cycle starts with money.
 

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:27.619
And though, I mean,
the chapters you have read,

00:28:27.619 --> 00:28:30.740
Marx tries to discipline
himself.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.323
He tries to really behave and
to be a scholar.

00:28:34.323 --> 00:28:34.960
Right?
 

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.900
But he can't resist. Right?
 

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:43.170
His emotions--right?--and his
values are too strong.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.858
So he said, "Your
moneybag,"

00:28:46.858 --> 00:28:50.048
talking about the capitalists.
 

00:28:50.048 --> 00:28:52.280
He should not have said so.
 

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:52.858
Right?
 

00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:56.019
He could have done this coolly,
objectively,

00:28:56.019 --> 00:29:00.907
simply to say, "Well,
we have an economic system in

00:29:00.907 --> 00:29:04.730
which we have--
right?--people who accumulated

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.292
capital,
and they are entering the

00:29:07.292 --> 00:29:08.190
marketplace.
 

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.089
And what do they do?
 

00:29:10.089 --> 00:29:12.980
They produce commodities.
 

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.078
And why do they do so?
 

00:29:16.078 --> 00:29:18.869
Because they want to have more
money;

00:29:18.869 --> 00:29:20.970
that's it."
 

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.336
And I would say this is bingo.
 

00:29:23.336 --> 00:29:23.890
Right?
 

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:29.970
I mean, the comparison between
the two is really capturing,

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:34.176
in a very powerful
way--right?--the emergence what

00:29:34.176 --> 00:29:37.440
we understand a capitalist
economy--

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.029
right?--as distinct simply from
a commercial society.

00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:45.946
I think this is a very,
very important and very

00:29:45.946 --> 00:29:49.098
insightful, very simple,
very precise,

00:29:49.098 --> 00:29:51.910
and very persuasive argument.
 

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:59.250
Now let me just say a few more
words about this.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.230
Why is this so?
 

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:07.193
Why does a capitalist need more
money than it started the

00:30:07.193 --> 00:30:08.259
process?
 

00:30:08.259 --> 00:30:14.298
And I will get into it a bit
later in more details.

00:30:14.298 --> 00:30:19.480
Well there are very good
reasons for it.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.930
One reason we already mentioned.
 

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:26.599
Why should the capitalist
bother--right?--advancing

00:30:26.599 --> 00:30:31.458
capital and taking risks,
unless it is compensated by

00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:32.858
more money?
 

00:30:32.858 --> 00:30:35.960
And that's in itself a good
enough reason.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.598
But there is an even more
important reason.

00:30:38.598 --> 00:30:42.490
We are on a competitive
marketplace;

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.890
in a competitive marketplace,
in a capitalist economy--

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:50.952
which in Marx's own words is
the most dynamic economy in

00:30:50.952 --> 00:30:53.863
human history--
there is improvement in

00:30:53.863 --> 00:30:54.868
technologies.
 

00:30:54.868 --> 00:31:00.269
The capitalist will create more
money because it will have to

00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:04.588
reinvest this money in the
production process.

00:31:04.588 --> 00:31:06.990
It has to improve its
technology;

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.704
it if would stop to do so,
the competition would wipe it

00:31:11.704 --> 00:31:12.220
out.
 

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:17.557
So the capitalist has to
collect--right?--more money than

00:31:17.557 --> 00:31:20.990
it started the production
process.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:25.248
Even the most altruistic
capitalist has to collect more

00:31:25.248 --> 00:31:27.930
money at the end of the process.
 

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:31.410
Even the capitalist who said,
"I'm such a good man.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.945
All what I'm doing is to
creating jobs for those poor,

00:31:34.945 --> 00:31:37.548
poor people,
that they can have a decent

00:31:37.548 --> 00:31:39.950
living and a nice suburban home.
 

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.819
And I don't want anything in
exchange for it.

00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:44.920
I do it out of altruism."
 

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.522
Okay, let's imagine our
altruistic moneybag.

00:31:49.522 --> 00:31:50.380
Right?
 

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.930
Still the poor guy does not
have a chance.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:58.537
It has to collect more money
because otherwise next year he

00:31:58.537 --> 00:32:01.078
will not be around any longer.
 

00:32:01.078 --> 00:32:05.653
He cannot be altruistic any
longer because the competition

00:32:05.653 --> 00:32:07.096
will wipe him out.
 

00:32:07.096 --> 00:32:07.819
Right?
 

00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:09.529
That's the argument.
 

00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:10.509
Okay.
 

00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:14.150
So now here comes Marx.
 

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:15.778
He said, "This is a big
change,

00:32:15.778 --> 00:32:19.031
because now the purpose of
production is not satisfaction

00:32:19.031 --> 00:32:23.109
of needs,
but it is really a generation

00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:26.567
of profit,
which is inevitable because

00:32:26.567 --> 00:32:29.390
competition among
capitalists."

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.828
Now comes a big puzzle.
 

00:32:31.828 --> 00:32:36.308
Where on earth do more money
comes from?

00:32:36.308 --> 00:32:42.625
How is it possible that the
capitalist goes out with money,

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:48.180
buys commodities,
and gets more money at the end?

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.670
Is the capitalist cheating us?
 

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:54.700
Buys cheap and sells dear?
 

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.900
He said, "Well this is
impossible.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.179
If there would be a capitalist
who would buy cheap and sell

00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:04.627
dear,
and would pocket a profit this

00:33:04.627 --> 00:33:07.328
way,
there will be others who will

00:33:07.328 --> 00:33:12.470
say, 'Well I will compete and I
will sell it less expensively,

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.730
and I will sell more,
and I will create more profit,

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:19.348
and we'll push these
artificially high prices down.

00:33:19.348 --> 00:33:22.519
There is supply and demand
which sets the prices'."

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:26.991
So that more money cannot come
out of cheating.

00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:27.769
Right?
 

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:32.400
It simply cannot come out
simply for circulation.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.000
It somehow has to come out from
the production.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.910
Now how can it happen that more
money is created?

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:44.845
And this is where the idea of
labor power as a commodity comes

00:33:44.845 --> 00:33:45.250
in.
 

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:49.525
What the capitalist does is
buys from the marketplace a

00:33:49.525 --> 00:33:53.404
specific commodity,
and this specific commodity is

00:33:53.404 --> 00:33:54.750
labor market.
 

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.423
And labor market,
so Marx argues,

00:33:57.423 --> 00:34:01.546
is that commodity--
the only commodity--which

00:34:01.546 --> 00:34:07.130
actually can produce a higher
value when it is consumed than

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.739
its own value.
 

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:14.530
In every other
input--right?--raw material,

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.929
the amount of labor which was
put into that raw material,

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.880
where in a production process
you consume it,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.280
that is being transferred into
value of the new product.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.940
So you are producing a
refrigerator,

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.440
you need steel or aluminum to
produce it;

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.333
the value which was put into
the production of steel or

00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:44.226
aluminum will be carried over,
exactly the same amount,

00:34:44.226 --> 00:34:47.670
into the refrigerator you
produce.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.793
So it cannot create more value.
 

00:34:50.793 --> 00:34:51.500
Right?
 

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.867
What can create--the only
commodity which produces

00:34:55.867 --> 00:34:58.630
more--is labor power as such.
 

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:03.447
Well, and this is also
important, that Marx suggests

00:35:03.447 --> 00:35:08.548
therefore what the laborer has
to sell cannot be labor,

00:35:08.548 --> 00:35:11.099
it must be labor power.
 

00:35:11.099 --> 00:35:17.050
Well you may be--Talmudistic
stuff--right?--this twisting

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:17.900
words.
 

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.039
But it isn't.
 

00:35:19.039 --> 00:35:20.809
I think there's an important
idea he said.

00:35:20.809 --> 00:35:24.380
He said if you would sell
labor, then--

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.635
and if John Locke was right and
all value is created by the

00:35:29.635 --> 00:35:33.079
laborer and belongs to the
laborer--

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:36.806
then the capitalist would have
to cheat you.

00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:37.500
Right?
 

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.590
Would not be able to sell--give
you the price of your labor;

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:44.929
could not have a surplus value
or a profit otherwise.

00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:49.630
Therefore the capitalist will
have to buy labor power,

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:51.670
the capacity of work.
 

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:56.489
And Marx insists we have to
think about a system in which

00:35:56.489 --> 00:36:00.449
the capitalist price pays the
proper price--

00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:02.608
the exact price,
the market price,

00:36:02.608 --> 00:36:06.510
the right market price--
for labor power.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:12.461
The worker is not cheated;
the worker is exploited,

00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:15.320
but that's not cheating,
right?

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.159
So why?
 

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:19.972
What is so unique about the
labor power?

00:36:19.972 --> 00:36:20.550
Right?
 

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.619
And let me just emphasize,
it's very, very important for

00:36:23.619 --> 00:36:25.630
these chapters what you have
read.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:30.367
That those are always
equivalents which have to

00:36:30.367 --> 00:36:34.590
exchange each other at the
marketplace.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.159
No cheating.
 

00:36:36.159 --> 00:36:38.329
The worker is not being cheated.
 

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:41.309
It gets the proper price for
this labor power.

00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:46.219
So but what is the price of the
labor power?

00:36:46.219 --> 00:36:51.210
It's exactly like the price of
any other commodity;

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.096
the price of its reproduction.
 

00:36:54.096 --> 00:36:54.768
Right?
 

00:36:54.768 --> 00:37:04.610
How much labor is necessary to
reproduce that commodity.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:08.681
If labor power is a commodity,
the price of the labor power is

00:37:08.681 --> 00:37:12.820
exactly how much is necessary to
reproduce that labor power.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.050
It involves--right?--the cost
of your housing,

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.855
the cost of your living,
and the extended reproduction

00:37:19.855 --> 00:37:21.219
of labor power.
 

00:37:21.219 --> 00:37:24.159
It involves that you have to
raise children.

00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:27.826
It involves education;
you know, human capital

00:37:27.826 --> 00:37:28.659
investment.
 

00:37:28.659 --> 00:37:31.780
This all will have to be
compensated for the laborer.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:36.458
But if it is compensated,
then the laborer is compensated

00:37:36.458 --> 00:37:39.943
for its laboring capacities,
labor power,

00:37:39.943 --> 00:37:43.820
will work under the supervision
of the capitalist,

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.289
and the capitalist will make
sure that the laborer,

00:37:47.289 --> 00:37:52.233
after the costs of the
reproduction of labor power are

00:37:52.233 --> 00:37:55.719
covered,
will work another three or four

00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:58.771
or five hours,
under the supervision of the

00:37:58.771 --> 00:38:01.514
capitalist,
and start producing surplus

00:38:01.514 --> 00:38:05.579
value for the capitalist,
or profit for the capitalist.

00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:06.099
Right?
 

00:38:06.099 --> 00:38:09.351
That is--right?--a stroke of
the genius.

00:38:09.351 --> 00:38:10.018
Right?
 

00:38:10.018 --> 00:38:12.909
That's the big solution what
he's offering.

00:38:12.909 --> 00:38:18.240
And this is why I said though
there is a heavy--of course he

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.402
hates capitalism,
of course he hates

00:38:21.402 --> 00:38:22.940
exploitation.
 

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.664
But if you look at the logic of
the analysis,

00:38:26.664 --> 00:38:31.152
this is pretty cool-headed
analysis and does not imply

00:38:31.152 --> 00:38:32.507
value judgments.
 

00:38:32.507 --> 00:38:33.440
Right?
 

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.630
Does not imply moral judgment.
 

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.489
You can go through of this to
say, "Yes.

00:38:38.489 --> 00:38:38.750
Why?
 

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:39.268
Sure.
 

00:38:39.268 --> 00:38:42.099
That's it, that's how the
system works."

00:38:42.099 --> 00:38:46.992
He does hate it,
and as I said he cannot stop,

00:38:46.992 --> 00:38:49.059
and expresses it.
 

00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:51.969
Okay, let me talk about classes
very briefly.

00:38:51.969 --> 00:38:58.989
And now we are back to The
Communist Manifesto.

00:38:58.989 --> 00:39:05.219
And there are really a couple
of issues here.

00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:09.275
He's talking about classes as a
trans-historical category,

00:39:09.275 --> 00:39:13.260
which in a way is contradictory
to the argument of Das

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.400
Kapital.
 

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.032
He's talking about the
bourgeoisie as a new class and

00:39:18.032 --> 00:39:19.780
as a progressive class.
 

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:24.340
Now let's look at this,
classes as a trans-historical

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.130
category.
 

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.920
Right?
 

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.298
This is written almost twenty
years before Das Kapital,

00:39:29.298 --> 00:39:31.349
without the theory of
exploitation.

00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:36.262
And he said the history of all
previously existing societies is

00:39:36.262 --> 00:39:38.800
the history of class struggle.
 

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.862
And you remember I said this
idea is becoming already in

00:39:42.862 --> 00:39:48.581
The German Ideology,
where he tries to develop these

00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:52.275
causal mechanisms--
right?--which explains

00:39:52.275 --> 00:39:53.710
evolution in history.
 

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.860
And this is class struggle all
along.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.340
Right?
 

00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.349
The struggle of the slaves
against the slave owners,

00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:03.789
the serfs against the landlord,
and finally it will be the

00:40:03.789 --> 00:40:07.050
struggle of the proletariat
against the bourgeoisie.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.099
That's the idea. Right?
 

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:12.570
And this is being used in a
trans-historical way.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:16.400
The trouble is that this is
obviously wrong.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.541
It's wrong in terms of Marx's
own theory of exploitation,

00:40:20.541 --> 00:40:24.460
and actually it is also
empirically a wrong statement.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.199
Right?
 

00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:27.550
Why it is wrong in terms of
Marx?

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.670
Because it doesn't fit the
theory of exploitation.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:31.179
Right?
 

00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:35.190
If exploitation is unique for a
capitalist mode of production,

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:39.581
reasonably you can talk only
about classes in a capitalist

00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:44.126
mode of production where the
labor power is free in the dual

00:40:44.126 --> 00:40:47.947
sense of the term--
legally free and freed from the

00:40:47.947 --> 00:40:51.512
means of production and
therefore has to sell its labor

00:40:51.512 --> 00:40:51.909
power.
 

00:40:51.909 --> 00:40:52.570
Right?
 

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.018
If this does not exist,
you should not use the term of

00:40:56.018 --> 00:40:56.670
classes.
 

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.110
So this is a contradiction in
Marx's own analysis.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:02.579
And, of course,
it is empirically wrong,

00:41:02.579 --> 00:41:06.780
because it's true there were
class struggles in history,

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:12.494
but was antiquity overthrown by
the revolt of slave owners

00:41:12.494 --> 00:41:14.599
against the slaves?
 

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:16.860
No, it wasn't.
 

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:21.630
As we have learned from Marx,
it fell because it was invaded

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.329
by Germanic tribes.
 

00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:27.608
Did, in the South,
slavery end up because the

00:41:27.608 --> 00:41:31.789
slaves revolted against the
slave owners?

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:34.010
No.
 

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:39.349
Because capitalists from the
North initiated a war against

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:40.286
the South.
 

00:41:40.286 --> 00:41:41.130
Right?
 

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:46.250
Did the proletariat ever revolt
to overthrow the bourgeoisie?

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:50.230
Not really.
 

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.695
In countries where we are
talking about proletarian

00:41:52.695 --> 00:41:55.159
revolutions, there were hardly
any proletarians.

00:41:55.159 --> 00:42:00.409
How many proletarians were
there in China in 1949?

00:42:00.409 --> 00:42:05.322
It was obviously an
overwhelmingly peasant economy.

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.110
Right?
 

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:09.177
Those were peasant masses who
demanded land,

00:42:09.177 --> 00:42:13.244
who carried out the revolution
under the leadership of Mao

00:42:13.244 --> 00:42:14.030
Zedong.
 

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.030
Russia, not much different in
1917.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.869
So it's simply not true.
 

00:42:20.869 --> 00:42:24.532
It's also not true that the
classes which were subordinated

00:42:24.532 --> 00:42:27.500
earlier will become the new
dominant classes.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.139
I mean, the slaves did not
became the landlords,

00:42:31.139 --> 00:42:34.389
the serfs did not become the
grand bourgeoisie,

00:42:34.389 --> 00:42:38.963
and the proletariat certainly
did not become a dominant class

00:42:38.963 --> 00:42:41.402
in China or in the Soviet Union.
 

00:42:41.402 --> 00:42:42.090
Right?
 

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.760
This is all wrong. Right?
 

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:52.449
But the argument is still
interesting.

00:42:52.449 --> 00:42:54.940
Then most
importantly--right?--the

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.659
bourgeoisie, he said,
is a new class,

00:42:57.659 --> 00:43:01.360
and probably,
arguably, the first real class.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.402
The landlords were not a class
because they were not

00:43:05.402 --> 00:43:07.940
constituted in economic terms.
 

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.827
They were constituted
legally--right?--and by customs,

00:43:11.827 --> 00:43:16.449
rather than simply on market
exchange and market competition.

00:43:16.449 --> 00:43:20.007
And he also said,
"Well, this bourgeoisie

00:43:20.007 --> 00:43:24.119
was an extremely revolutionary
force." Right?

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:27.103
"And it actually
transformed the whole

00:43:27.103 --> 00:43:28.239
society."
 

00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:32.594
And here I think there is--even
in The Communist Manifesto

00:43:32.594 --> 00:43:34.699
he contradicts himself.
 

00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:37.547
He said, "Well, you know,
what it did,

00:43:37.547 --> 00:43:41.599
it transformed occupations,
which were based on honor

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:44.358
before, into class
positions."

00:43:44.358 --> 00:43:45.090
Right?
 

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:49.554
It converted the position of a
doctor or a lawyer or a priest

00:43:49.554 --> 00:43:52.309
into a kind of class-like
position.

00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:55.456
Though their power
traditionally was based on

00:43:55.456 --> 00:43:59.175
honor--they were honorable
positions--now they become

00:43:59.175 --> 00:44:02.610
positions for which an income is
being paid.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.559
All right.
 

00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:08.431
And then he writes--it's very
important to appreciate that

00:44:08.431 --> 00:44:12.576
Marx sees that the bourgeoisie
did play an extremely important

00:44:12.576 --> 00:44:14.750
progressive role in history.
 

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:19.442
But it's not only--he hates the
guts of the bourgeoisie for

00:44:19.442 --> 00:44:21.655
sure,
but he appreciates the

00:44:21.655 --> 00:44:25.927
contribution of the bourgeoisie
for the development of modern

00:44:25.927 --> 00:44:26.498
society.
 

00:44:26.498 --> 00:44:27.210
Right?
 

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:32.300
He said, "The bourgeoisie
cannot exist without constantly

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.224
revolutionalizing the
instruments of production.

00:44:36.224 --> 00:44:37.059
Right?
 

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:42.186
"In a scarce one-hundred
years has created more massive

00:44:42.186 --> 00:44:46.617
and more colossal productive
forces than we have all

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:50.179
preceding generations
together."

00:44:50.179 --> 00:44:54.367
Well, sounds like somebody who
loves capitalism.

00:44:54.367 --> 00:44:55.079
Right?
 

00:44:55.079 --> 00:44:57.657
Though of course he doesn't,
because he thinks it will

00:44:57.657 --> 00:44:59.018
eventually destroy itself.
 

00:44:59.018 --> 00:45:02.280
Now the last issue is about how
many classes.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:09.260
And well what follows from the
logic of Das Kapital,

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:14.121
and I think it is also the
point of Marx in The

00:45:14.121 --> 00:45:18.425
Communist Manifesto,
there are two classes:

00:45:18.425 --> 00:45:21.014
the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat.

00:45:21.014 --> 00:45:21.679
Right?
 

00:45:21.679 --> 00:45:25.268
The moneybags and the workers.
 

00:45:25.268 --> 00:45:28.242
And the workers are exploited
by the moneybags,

00:45:28.242 --> 00:45:31.860
and that's the reason for class
struggle, and that's what

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.380
eventually will lead to
revolution.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.719
But my goodness,
where are the middle classes?

00:45:37.719 --> 00:45:45.309
There were not all that many
proletarians in 1867.

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:49.286
There was no society,
except industrialized Soviet

00:45:49.286 --> 00:45:53.911
Union, where the majority of the
population was industrial

00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:56.510
worker, but no ruling class.
 

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.750
They were exploited and
screwed, don't worry about it.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.820
But they were in majority.
 

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.820
But it never happened in
Western societies.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.126
We never reached a point--and
then, of course,

00:46:06.126 --> 00:46:08.690
the industrial working class
has been declining.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.000
Now, properly speaking,
the industrial working class in

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.250
the United States is probably
not more than 15% of the

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.170
population.
 

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.010
So where is the middle class?
 

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:23.739
So well I don't have much time.
 

00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:24.969
Let's rush through of this.
 

00:46:24.969 --> 00:46:27.976
Well he said there is,
you know, these elemental

00:46:27.976 --> 00:46:31.880
confrontations between the
bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.590
Well he does not have the
theory of exploitation;

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:37.380
he cannot explain it quite well.
 

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.317
And you can do it by now,
armed with Das Kapital.

00:46:41.317 --> 00:46:41.889
Right?
 

00:46:41.889 --> 00:46:44.699
This is a contradiction
because, you know,

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:48.809
the proletariat has no choice
but sell its labor power and be

00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:49.768
exploited.
 

00:46:49.768 --> 00:46:52.634
And this is,
of course, an irreconcilable

00:46:52.634 --> 00:46:53.780
contradiction.
 

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.409
And what about the middle class?
 

00:46:56.409 --> 00:46:59.829
Well Marx said
"Yeah..."

00:46:59.829 --> 00:47:04.050
Well he is--of course even in a
political pamphlet--

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.210
he is a good enough scientist,
social scientist,

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:11.789
that he will say, "No,
there is no middle class."

00:47:11.789 --> 00:47:15.329
He knows there is a middle
class-- that most people do not

00:47:15.329 --> 00:47:18.869
belong to the bourgeoisie,
and the proletariat in 1848.

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:22.230
And, as I said, they never did.
 

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.903
But he said,
"Well, but look at it

00:47:24.903 --> 00:47:25.960
historically.
 

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.940
What we call middle class is
disappearing.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.889
Look at all those peasants and
small artisans and small

00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:33.148
merchants,
they will all disappear,

00:47:33.148 --> 00:47:35.409
and they will all have to
either--

00:47:35.409 --> 00:47:38.119
very few of them will become
big capitalists,

00:47:38.119 --> 00:47:41.744
and the overwhelming majority
of them will become working

00:47:41.744 --> 00:47:42.780
workers."
 

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.409
Well this is not without
insights.

00:47:46.409 --> 00:47:47.289
Right?
 

00:47:47.289 --> 00:47:53.047
For about a hundred years after
The Communist Manifesto

00:47:53.047 --> 00:47:57.188
the trend was going in this
direction.

00:47:57.188 --> 00:47:58.199
Right?
 

00:47:58.199 --> 00:48:02.344
Self-employment was shrinking,
and the wage labor was

00:48:02.344 --> 00:48:03.222
increasing.
 

00:48:03.222 --> 00:48:03.940
Right?
 

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.030
In big ways. Right?
 

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:10.480
In the mid-nineteenth century
70 to 90% of the population was

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.338
working in agriculture and was
self-employed in other

00:48:14.338 --> 00:48:15.153
businesses.
 

00:48:15.153 --> 00:48:15.969
Right?
 

00:48:15.969 --> 00:48:19.570
Today in the United States the
agricultural population,

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:23.570
I don't know the exactly the
most current figure is somewhere

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:24.635
between 1 to 2%.
 

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:25.369
Right?
 

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:30.536
And self-employment has been
substantially reduced for a very

00:48:30.536 --> 00:48:31.570
long time.
 

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:35.976
But things happened what Marx
did not foresee.

00:48:35.976 --> 00:48:36.760
Right?
 

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.715
And what he did not foresee
were--and I probably will leave

00:48:41.715 --> 00:48:44.583
it here;
there are two things what he

00:48:44.583 --> 00:48:46.309
did not really foresee.
 

00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:51.420
One, that actually this trend
turned around.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:55.690
There is no more reduction of
self-employment;

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.960
in fact, there is some increase
of self-employment.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.769
It varies from countries to
countries.

00:49:01.769 --> 00:49:03.599
In Japan, big way. Right?
 

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:07.300
In the United States some
improvement in self-employment.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.141
But self-employment is
stubbornly resistant.

00:49:10.141 --> 00:49:10.670
Right?
 

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:14.403
You have supermarkets,
but you always do have your

00:49:14.403 --> 00:49:17.681
corner deli shops,
and they don't seem to be

00:49:17.681 --> 00:49:18.670
disappearing.
 

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:19.510
Right?
 

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.193
I even take my shoes to a
shoemaker to fix them.

00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:22.650
Right?
 

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:27.088
So I mean, I do not throw my
shoes out, I go to a shoemaker

00:49:27.088 --> 00:49:31.681
and they fix it for $25.00 for
me, and I don't buy a shoe for

00:49:31.681 --> 00:49:32.447
150 bucks.
 

00:49:32.447 --> 00:49:33.289
Right?
 

00:49:33.289 --> 00:49:36.443
So, I mean, there is--mass
production has its limits.

00:49:36.443 --> 00:49:36.929
Right?
 

00:49:36.929 --> 00:49:39.657
There is a quality
production--right?--by artisans,

00:49:39.657 --> 00:49:41.730
and we want that quality
production.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:45.023
And the more important
argument: in fact,

00:49:45.023 --> 00:49:49.719
Marx conceptualized wage
laborers as physical laborers.

00:49:49.719 --> 00:49:52.231
Physical laborers,
as I pointed out,

00:49:52.231 --> 00:49:55.605
manual laborers,
at least in advanced countries,

00:49:55.605 --> 00:49:58.190
is this minority of the
society.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:59.362
In the globe,
that's

00:49:59.362 --> 00:50:02.693
different--right?--because
manufacturing and industrial

00:50:02.693 --> 00:50:05.594
activity was kind of
decentralized in the world,

00:50:05.594 --> 00:50:07.260
into the Third World.
 

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.561
But in the United States and in
Continental Europe it's a

00:50:10.561 --> 00:50:11.739
thriving minority.
 

00:50:11.739 --> 00:50:15.815
But there is a big new middle
class, and this new middle class

00:50:15.815 --> 00:50:19.759
are those white collar workers,
like most of you will become

00:50:19.759 --> 00:50:20.693
and what I am.
 

00:50:20.693 --> 00:50:21.429
Right?
 

00:50:21.429 --> 00:50:23.940
I mean, I'm--it's not
white--right?--the collar.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.650
&gt; Right?
 

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.152
But so that means,
in Marx's sense,

00:50:28.152 --> 00:50:29.697
I hardly do any work.
 

00:50:29.697 --> 00:50:30.360
Right?
 

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.538
What kind of value do I create?
 

00:50:32.538 --> 00:50:33.030
Right?
 

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.449
What does it mean?
 

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:37.710
I am exploited?
 

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:40.889
Well I don't think Rick Levin
really exploits me.

00:50:40.889 --> 00:50:43.489
&gt;
 

00:50:43.489 --> 00:50:45.929
Am I an exploiter?
 

00:50:45.929 --> 00:50:47.869
No I don't think I exploit you
guys.

00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:52.445
Or do you exploit me because I
have to stay up until midnight

00:50:52.445 --> 00:50:54.579
to grade your assignments?
 

00:50:54.579 --> 00:50:56.110
No, it's not really.
 

00:50:56.110 --> 00:51:00.353
I actually occasionally have
fun reading your assignments.

00:51:00.353 --> 00:51:00.949
Right?
 

00:51:00.949 --> 00:51:04.639
So we have a new middle
class--right?--which simply does

00:51:04.639 --> 00:51:07.590
not fit the analysis,
and where the notion of

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.940
exploitation loses its insight.
 

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.230
Okay, I'll leave it here.
 

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:12.340
Thank you.
 

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:17.000

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.513
Prof: Okay,
so now we have a number of

00:00:04.513 --> 00:00:07.568
different perspectives we can
take on understanding what holds

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:10.330
molecules together;
that is, on bonding.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.860
We can look at the real
molecule, for example,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.880
with X-ray.
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.330
Or we can do a computer
calculation,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.900
and if we do a careful enough
computer calculation,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.433
we can get something that we
believe is pretty close to

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.125
reality,
like the total electron density

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.038
I showed you.
 

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:29.600
Right?
 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.138
And the goal of the computer is
to approximate the

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:35.160
Schrödinger equation.
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.660
You can't do it absolutely,
but you can,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.508
depending on how much computer
power you want to throw at it,

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.650
you can do it close enough for
most purposes.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.270
Okay.
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.550
But you're neither the molecule
-- well you are a molecule --

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.403
but you're neither the kind of
molecule we're studying,

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:55.330
nor are you a computer.
 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.982
You're a chemist,
and your goal is to understand

00:00:57.982 --> 00:01:00.338
things;
let the computer do the heavy

00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:03.270
lifting mathematically and you
understand it.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.435
Okay, so let's see if we can
understand some of the things

00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:09.822
that we didn't understand when
we were looking at the molecule

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:12.828
really,
with X-ray diffraction. Right?

00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:16.271
When we were looking,
we looked at this molecule and

00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:19.712
said that the bonding,
from the Lewis point of view,

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.129
was pathological.
 

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:22.720
And you remember how we saw
that.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.522
We looked at a cross-section
through those three atoms,

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:28.688
and it looked like that in the
electron difference density.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:33.050
And you remember what's funny
about it?

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.000
What's pathological?
 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.620
Dana?
 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.170
Student:  The bonds
appear to be bent.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.280
Prof: Some of the bonds
are bent, and what else?

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.680
Student:  And there's
another bond that's missing.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.019
Prof: And one bond is
missing.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.569
So that bond isn't there in the
electron density,

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.420
the difference density.
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.610
And those are bent.
 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.430
They don't lie on the line
between the nuclei.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.910
Now, can we understand that,
from the point of view of

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.390
molecular orbitals,
of Schrödinger's equation;

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.670
why it should look like that in
this particular case?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.040
So would a computer's molecular
orbitals provide understanding?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.304
So I was just showing you,
as the class assembled,

00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:09.984
how you get these molecular
orbitals, and I was showing you

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:10.770
some of them.
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.299
There's the framework of the
molecule superimposed on this

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.334
map, and that triangle on top
there, on the right,

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:19.128
is what we're looking at.
 

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:22.522
And so we could look at the
thirty-second of the

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:26.420
thirty-three occupied orbitals,
the next to the highest

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.669
occupied orbital,
and it looks like that.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.022
That's the one we were just
looking at, before we went on to

00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:33.990
the PowerPoint.
 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.485
And you see there is electron
density in those -- the

00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:41.585
wavefunction has big value in
the region where those bonds are

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:42.190
bent.
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.620
But there are thirty-three of
these occupied orbitals,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.128
and they put electron density
every which way,

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:51.559
and it's very difficult to
understand why this is

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.770
the way it is,
why it's bent.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.240
Even if you grant -- which is
not easy to grant --

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.080
that this is the proper orbital
to look at,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.710
and that indeed the electron
density of the red and blue,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.180
big red and blue lobes,
are not on the line between;

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.473
we don't know why they are.
 

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:10.068
Right?
 

00:03:10.068 --> 00:03:13.229
And there's so much other
electron density in the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:17.247
molecule, with all complicated
nodes, that it's very difficult

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:18.694
to know where to look.
 

00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:19.419
Right?
 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.417
So the answer is no,
it doesn't provide

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:23.680
understanding.
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.860
It gives far too complicated an
answer.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.538
It doesn't tell you why.
 

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:31.248
Even if you believe that it
gives you the right numbers,

00:03:31.248 --> 00:03:32.530
it doesn't tell you why.
 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.560
Okay?
 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.220
But analysis in terms of
pairwise --

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.378
that is, don't go over the
whole molecule,

00:03:40.378 --> 00:03:43.550
just look at two atoms adjacent
to one another,

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.568
making a bond,
so just a very local view --

00:03:46.568 --> 00:03:51.491
pairwise bonding overlap of
hybrid atomic orbitals explains

00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.530
these two pathologies.
 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.060
So let's look.
 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.872
First, I will assert that the
best overlap you can get between

00:04:00.872 --> 00:04:04.400
hybrid orbitals on these carbons
--

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.919
if the nuclei are arranged in
an equilateral triangle,

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.693
so 60º angles -- the best
hybrids you can get point at the

00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:16.620
angles shown by the red arrows
here.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.610
They do it in order to get the
best overlap.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.613
Now this seems funny,
because the angle between the

00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:29.259
red arrows on the right carbon
is greater than 90º.

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.980
Why do I say it's funny that
it's greater than --

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.720
you're not going to be able to
make it 60º

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.516
because two orbitals that made
a 60º angle would not be

00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:42.550
independent orbitals.
 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.815
Obviously if they were right on
top of one another,

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:47.709
they'd be the same orbital.
 

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:50.564
But you can't say they're not
the same orbital if they're just

00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:52.716
a little bit away,
because still they're mostly

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:53.699
the same orbital.
 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.329
It's only once they get to
90º that they can be

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:56.949
different.
 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.567
What would the orbitals be that
would be independent of one

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:01.939
another at 90º?
 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.319
Students:
 p orbitals.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.750
Prof: p orbitals,
right?

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.839
So 90º is the smallest
angle you could get.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:09.850
Why don't you use 90º?
 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.660
Why do you use greater than
90º?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.649
Okay, that's the question.
 

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:16.531
Why not use p orbitals
and make the smallest angle you

00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:16.819
can?
 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:23.379
Does anybody see why that is?
 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.649
Okay here, there's a p
orbital that points at 90º.

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:29.959
You see its axis,
the yellow axis,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.920
is a little bit inside the red
arrow,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.050
and the blue axis,
which would be another p

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.096
orbital,
perpendicular to that one,

00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:39.509
is a little inside the other
red arrow;

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.060
they make an angle of 90º.
 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.110
Got it?
 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.490
Now why don't the atoms use
p orbitals to make the

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.060
smallest possible angle?
 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.629
Can anybody see why that won't
give the best overlap?

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.081
How could you change the
orbital so as to get better

00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:56.759
overlap?
 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.629
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.449
Prof: Claire?
 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.017
Student:  The best
overlap is between an s

00:06:04.017 --> 00:06:04.910
and a p orbital.
 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.341
So if it's two p
orbitals, you don't have the

00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:11.939
best overlap.
 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:15.129
Prof: Remember,
that depends on the distance.

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.360
And they're very close to one
another.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.040
And it turns out it might be
that at this angle --

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.490
if you used the s on one
of the carbons,

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.653
and the p on another --
it might be that you would get

00:06:28.653 --> 00:06:29.550
better overlap.
 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.829
I don't know that it's true,
but it's not implausible.

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:37.209
But what would be wrong about
using this p orbital from

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:39.641
that carbon,
and on the top one of the

00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:43.519
triangle using an s,
which might give better overlap?

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.230
Can you see what's bad about
that?

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.947
If you use all the s of
that top carbon there,

00:06:49.947 --> 00:06:54.452
you can't use any of it to make
any of the other bonds from that

00:06:54.452 --> 00:06:54.952
carbon.
 

00:06:54.952 --> 00:06:55.740
Right?
 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.334
All you have left over on that
one is p's,

00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.850
which give crummy overlap.
 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.112
So even though you might be
able make this single overlap

00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:06.548
better, you couldn't make all
the bonds strong from that top

00:07:06.548 --> 00:07:07.189
carbon.
 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:09.550
So you wouldn't get the best
overall overlap.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.170
So that's a good suggestion.
 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.435
But there's another way to do
it, which is to use a hybrid

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:17.360
orbital.
 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.699
Now here we've put in a little
bit less than 20% of s,

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:25.459
to give the ratio
sp^4.1.

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:26.350
Right?
 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.209
But notice that it really
distorted;

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:33.091
it made it much larger in the
region where we're interested in

00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:34.047
it overlapping.
 

00:07:34.047 --> 00:07:34.620
Right?
 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.355
In the process,
the axis moved out,

00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:42.091
to close to where the red arrow
is.

00:07:42.091 --> 00:07:43.190
Right?
 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.827
But even though the bonds
didn't point -- let's see,

00:07:46.827 --> 00:07:50.610
like this -- even though the
bonds didn't point at one

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.750
another, by extending they
overlap more.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.610
Got the idea?
 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.029
So the hybridization,
by shifting it to one side,

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:00.651
gives better overlap,
even though the angle might not

00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:01.709
be quite as good.
 

00:08:01.709 --> 00:08:08.526
So you have bent bonds,
paradoxically enough,

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:13.949
in order to get the best
overlap.

00:08:13.949 --> 00:08:15.778
Isn't that funny?
 

00:08:15.778 --> 00:08:18.132
You'd think the best overlap
would be when they'd point at

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:18.709
one another.
 

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:21.857
But you get it better when they
make an angle because they

00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:22.629
stretch out.
 

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:24.829
Okay, so that explains the bent
bonds.

00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:27.930
Now how about the missing bond?
 

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.970
Well again we can see that in
hybridization.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.633
Because what's left over,
after you make those

00:08:33.633 --> 00:08:36.470
sp^4.1's,
three of them,

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.879
pointing up from the bottom
carbon,

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:42.610
after you make three
sp^4.1's,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.539
what you have left over is an
sp^1.4.

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:50.379
And it points down, not up.
 

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:53.375
If it pointed up,
if the big blue lobe were up

00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:56.504
and the red down,
then it would be part of those

00:08:56.504 --> 00:08:58.168
other three orbitals.
 

00:08:58.168 --> 00:09:02.743
The only way you can make it
point up is to make the others

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:03.610
point down.
 

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.320
Right?
 

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.658
And then they would have crummy
overlap.

00:09:06.658 --> 00:09:10.172
So there's very poor overlap
between the tiny lobes of these

00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:10.528
two.
 

00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:12.940
So there's not enough overlap
to get a bond.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.857
You don't stabilize the
electrons because you don't have

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:17.427
overlap.
 

00:09:17.427 --> 00:09:18.070
Right?
 

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.269
And rehybridizing this one,
to strengthen this particular

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:24.405
bond,
by making it point up,

00:09:24.405 --> 00:09:27.340
would drastically weaken all
the others,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.620
making them point down. Right?
 

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.113
So the best overall overlap,
for all the pairs that are

00:09:35.113 --> 00:09:39.808
involved in these bonds,
is to have one bond not there,

00:09:39.808 --> 00:09:42.921
or to have very,
very poor overlap so that the

00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:44.450
other three are very good.
 

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.538
Sam?
 

00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:49.866
Student:  So when you
hybridized the other two and you

00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:53.615
get the sp^4.1,
shouldn't -- and I understand

00:09:53.615 --> 00:09:57.038
that shifts the electrons
towards the other atom,

00:09:57.038 --> 00:10:02.870
but how does that shifting
distort the angle?

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.494
Prof: Remember the angle
between hybrids depends on

00:10:05.494 --> 00:10:08.902
m and n;
sp^m^( )and sp^n,

00:10:08.902 --> 00:10:10.610
we did that last time.
 

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.408
If it's pure p,
it's 90º.

00:10:12.408 --> 00:10:16.577
If it's sp^3_,
-sp^3,

00:10:16.577 --> 00:10:17.808
it's 109.5.
 

00:10:17.808 --> 00:10:18.725
If it's
sp^2_,-

00:10:18.725 --> 00:10:20.740
sp^2_ it's 120;
and so on.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.899
If it's sp^4.1,
it makes that certain angle

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:26.610
that's shown there bigger than
90º.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.720
Okay?
 

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.259
And the only reason for that is
so that these hybrids will be

00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:34.879
different from one another;
they won't be the same. Right?

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:37.538
They won't overlap each other
on the same atom,

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:40.254
because to the extent they do,
they're the same,

00:10:40.254 --> 00:10:41.928
and so they can't at all.
 

00:10:41.928 --> 00:10:47.029
They have to be orthogonal,
if they're on the same atom.

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:52.440
Okay, now three views of BH_3.
 

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.960
First nature;
the total electron density.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.557
I'm going over the same thing
again and again here,

00:10:58.557 --> 00:10:59.908
with different examples.
 

00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:03.288
First look at total electron
density; nature.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.529
Then we'll look at molecular
orbitals;

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:07.230
that's what a computer does.
 

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.370
And then we'll look at bonds
from hybrid atomic orbitals;

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.360
and that's what we do,
as chemists.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.900
Okay, first we'll look at the
electron cloud of BH_3,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.918
calculated here,
using that same program I just

00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:25.230
showed you.
 

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.144
So we can look at the
successive layers of the onion,

00:11:29.144 --> 00:11:32.080
the high electron density,
lower, lower,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.490
lower, the various contours.
 

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.542
So this lowest one is mostly
1s of boron,

00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:41.048
but a little bit of the
1s's of hydrogen too.

00:11:41.048 --> 00:11:45.048
And one of them doesn't even
show up, because it's so small.

00:11:45.048 --> 00:11:47.029
All the hydrogens should be the
same,

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:51.259
but the graphing capability of
the computer,

00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:54.080
for something that has as few
points as this,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.027
the way it draws surfaces,
doesn't draw them smooth.

00:11:57.027 --> 00:11:57.490
Right?
 

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.153
It connects points,
so it doesn't even show one of

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:00.590
those.
 

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.269
Nobody would ever make such a
plot.

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.908
Okay?
 

00:12:03.908 --> 00:12:07.460
That's 0.3 electrons per cubic
angstrom.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.937
So suppose we go to 0.15
electrons per cubic angstrom,

00:12:10.937 --> 00:12:12.250
half that density.
 

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.580
Now we're beginning to get
smoother surfaces.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.158
And it's on the boron,
it's 1s of the boron,

00:12:18.158 --> 00:12:21.094
and a little bit of the
hydrogens as well.

00:12:21.094 --> 00:12:21.808
Right?
 

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:24.932
And now we're going to lower
the electron density,

00:12:24.932 --> 00:12:25.379
0.05.
 

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:28.389
And now there's an interesting
feature you can see here.

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:31.360
You see that dimple?
 

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.590
Why is that?
 

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.941
Why is there not as much
electron density,

00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:39.720
at this level,
around the boron?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.480
We're out in the valence-shell
now;

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.144
not 1s anymore,
because the 1s is really

00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:48.519
down close, high density.
 

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:53.053
It's because the hydrogen atoms
are pulling the electron density

00:12:53.053 --> 00:12:55.860
away from the valence atoms of
Boron.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.308
Often you talk about this in
terms of electronegativity.

00:12:59.308 --> 00:13:01.840
But why is something
electronegative?

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.168
It's because of what the
effective nuclear charge is.

00:13:05.168 --> 00:13:09.643
The effective nuclear charge of
hydrogen, for the valence level,

00:13:09.643 --> 00:13:10.139
is one.
 

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:10.778
Right?
 

00:13:10.778 --> 00:13:13.710
But for boron it should be
higher.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.750
Boron is the fifth element.
 

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:22.788
But it's got the 1s
electrons shielding the nucleus.

00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:25.941
So it's not as high an
effective nuclear charge as

00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:26.970
hydrogen does.
 

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.677
So when you put the orbitals
together, hydrogen is lower than

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:34.817
boron, and the electrons,
in those bonds,

00:13:34.817 --> 00:13:37.250
are mostly on the hydrogen.
 

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.109
So you see that dimple in the
middle, because there's not much

00:13:41.109 --> 00:13:43.639
valence electron density on the
boron.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:47.690
Now we go to 0.02 electrons per
cubic angstrom;

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.769
and finally to 0.002 electrons
per cubic angstrom,

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:56.264
which is defined as (for
purposes of drawing what the van

00:13:56.264 --> 00:14:00.001
der Waals surface is,
that is) how close molecules

00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:03.821
tend to get to one another at
normal pressure in a liquid or

00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:04.662
in a crystal.
 

00:14:04.662 --> 00:14:05.308
Right?
 

00:14:05.308 --> 00:14:07.500
And that's, it's just found
empirically,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.509
just by testing and measuring
things,

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:13.788
that if you draw a surface at
0.002 electrons per cubic

00:14:13.788 --> 00:14:16.375
Angstrom,
you have about how close things

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:19.649
would come to one another when
you bump these surfaces into one

00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:20.230
another.
 

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.919
Okay, so that's the van der
Waals surface;

00:14:21.919 --> 00:14:24.298
that's a definition, right?
 

00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:27.639
And we showed once before
electrostatic potential,

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:29.850
where you show that same
surface but color it,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.429
to show how the electrons are
distributed,

00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:34.460
and the protons in the molecule.
 

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.899
So where would a positive
charge on the surface be happy?

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:40.279
Where it's negative.
 

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:42.379
That's red.
 

00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:45.549
And where would it be unhappy,
the positive charge,

00:14:45.549 --> 00:14:48.149
because the molecule is
positive there?

00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:49.409
That's the blue.
 

00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:50.428
So you can see what it is.
 

00:14:50.428 --> 00:14:53.707
It's red where the hydrogens
are, because they're pulling the

00:14:53.707 --> 00:14:56.057
electrons, and it's blue where
the boron is,

00:14:56.057 --> 00:14:58.080
because it's giving up
electrons.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:05.788
Okay, so there's what the real
molecule looks like.

00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:09.196
Of course I didn't do it by an
experimental measurement from

00:15:09.196 --> 00:15:11.678
BH_3, because you can't
crystallize BH_3.

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:13.460
I did it by a computer
calculation.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.008
But I believe that what it
gives is what you would see in

00:15:17.008 --> 00:15:20.048
an experiment,
if you could do the experiment.

00:15:20.048 --> 00:15:21.860
Okay, so that's the total
electron density.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.076
Now let's look at how the
computer breaks that up into

00:15:25.076 --> 00:15:27.990
molecular orbitals in a
calculation like this.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.854
So it looks at -- it makes
symmetrical molecular orbitals,

00:15:31.854 --> 00:15:34.159
like Chladni things,
with nodes;

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:35.629
we've seen lots of those.
 

00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:38.379
So here's the framework,
BH_3, and we're going to look

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:41.080
at the molecular orbitals the
computer calculates.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.474
And we're going to make those
molecular orbitals by adding up

00:15:45.474 --> 00:15:48.697
atomic orbitals,
linear combination of atomic

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:49.649
orbitals.
 

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:53.120
And which atomic orbitals will
we use?

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.408
The best would be if we used
every atomic orbital.

00:15:56.408 --> 00:15:59.296
Then we could get perfect
flexibility, but the calculation

00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:00.408
would take too long.
 

00:16:00.408 --> 00:16:03.210
So we use just a minimal number
of atomic orbitals;

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.820
namely the 1s orbital on
boron,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.350
and also the valence orbitals,
2s,

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.610
2p_x,
2p_y,

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.759
2p_z,
and also the 1s orbitals

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:14.750
of hydrogen.
 

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.970
So there are one,
two, three, four,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.974
five, six, seven,
eight, there are eight atomic

00:16:19.974 --> 00:16:23.370
orbitals we're going to use,
to make up our molecular

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.350
orbitals.
 

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.729
How many independent molecular
orbitals can we make,

00:16:28.729 --> 00:16:32.250
if we start with eight atomic
orbitals?

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.197
We can make eight molecular
orbitals, the same number you

00:16:34.197 --> 00:16:34.720
started with.
 

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.379
If you tried to make more,
they wouldn't be independent of

00:16:38.379 --> 00:16:39.279
one another.
 

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:41.538
But you can make -- from eight,
you make eight.

00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:44.596
Okay, so these are going to be
the energies that'll turn out of

00:16:44.596 --> 00:16:47.360
the eight molecular orbitals
that we're going to get,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.529
that the computer is going to
get, starting from that.

00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:53.381
If you added more atomic
orbitals, if you let it use

00:16:53.381 --> 00:16:55.283
3s,
3p, 3d,

00:16:55.283 --> 00:16:58.190
and so on, then you'd get more
molecular orbitals,

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.860
but they'd be higher in energy,
and less relevant.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.769
Okay?
 

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:06.880
In fact, how many of these are
relevant?

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.430
How do we know how many we care
about, the energy of?

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.759
Russell?
 

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:15.589
Student:  The total
number of electrons.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.240
Prof: How many electrons.
 

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.920
We can put two electrons into
each.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.932
Once we've got it filled up,
we don't really care what other

00:17:20.932 --> 00:17:23.650
energies there could be;
at least not for this purpose.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:28.538
Okay, well, it turns out that
boron has five electrons,

00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:32.000
hydrogen has three;
eight altogether.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.111
So there'll be eight electrons,
four pairs, and that means four

00:17:37.111 --> 00:17:38.759
occupied orbitals.
 

00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:41.538
We don't care so much about the
others, right?

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:44.328
So those are the Occupied
Molecular Orbitals,

00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:44.710
OMO.
 

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.088
Okay?
 

00:17:46.088 --> 00:17:49.557
And then there'll be,
also from this set of atomic

00:17:49.557 --> 00:17:53.521
orbitals, there'll be four
Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals,

00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:54.160
UMOs.
 

00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.407
Okay, now those two are called
-- nobody talks about OMO and

00:18:00.407 --> 00:18:02.355
UMO,
but they talk about HOMO --

00:18:02.355 --> 00:18:04.900
that's very important and we'll
be talking about that --

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.578
that's the Highest Occupied
Molecular Orbital.

00:18:08.578 --> 00:18:11.705
And also they're very
interested in the Lowest

00:18:11.705 --> 00:18:15.818
Unoccupied Molecular Orbital;
and you'll see why very shortly.

00:18:15.818 --> 00:18:18.210
So the LUMO and the HOMO are
very important.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.753
In this particular case it
turns out there are two HOMOs

00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:22.048
that have the same energy.
 

00:18:22.048 --> 00:18:24.515
Not surprisingly,
because it's such a symmetrical

00:18:24.515 --> 00:18:25.078
molecule.
 

00:18:25.078 --> 00:18:31.450
Okay now, what do you think the
very lowest orbital looks like?

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.730
Katelyn, you're our expert.
 

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.549
What?
 

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:36.108
Student:  1s.
 

00:18:36.108 --> 00:18:38.890
Prof: It's the 1s
orbital of boron.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.009
So there it is.
 

00:18:40.009 --> 00:18:43.279
No surprise there.
 

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:45.684
Not to diminish your
contribution,

00:18:45.684 --> 00:18:47.579
but it's not surprising.
 

00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:48.589
Okay, so there's 1s.
 

00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:49.529
That's the boron core.
 

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:52.288
Now what's going to come next
do you think?

00:18:52.288 --> 00:18:54.212
After we've got the 1s
molecular orbital,

00:18:54.212 --> 00:18:54.950
what'll be next?
 

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.789
Students:  2s.
 

00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:57.390
Prof: 2s.
 

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.119
But it's a molecular orbital,
it'll be made up of everything.

00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:01.950
So here it is, right?
 

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.471
And it's all the hydrogens and
also the boron 2s are

00:19:05.471 --> 00:19:06.868
contributing to that.
 

00:19:06.868 --> 00:19:10.498
Again there's a dimple in the
middle, more of the hydrogens

00:19:10.498 --> 00:19:11.750
than of the boron.
 

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.710
Why?
 

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:17.250
Because the hydrogen 1s
is lower than the boron

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.279
2s.
 

00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:21.240
The boron 1s was lower;
that was the first one, right?

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.808
Okay.
 

00:19:22.808 --> 00:19:25.878
And then, so there's that
radial node, the spherical sort

00:19:25.878 --> 00:19:28.730
of node down the middle,
showing it's a 2s.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.548
Right?
 

00:19:29.548 --> 00:19:32.875
And then there's a 2p_x
molecular orbital,

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:35.509
and a 2p_y molecular
orbital.

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:38.150
And that's four,
and that's all eight electrons.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.769
So that's what we care about.
 

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:42.980
They're the occupied molecular
orbitals of BH_3.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.608
Now how about the vacant
orbitals?

00:19:44.608 --> 00:19:47.733
The lowest unoccupied orbital
is the last 2p,

00:19:47.733 --> 00:19:50.490
the 2p_z,
that's pointing in and out of

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.328
the plane of the molecule.
 

00:19:52.328 --> 00:19:55.531
And then we're going to have
3s, which you see has

00:19:55.531 --> 00:20:01.420
that node in the middle;
so two spherical sort of nodes.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:07.634
And then a d_x^2-y^2,
and finally d_xy.

00:20:07.634 --> 00:20:08.588
Right?
 

00:20:08.588 --> 00:20:11.453
So that's the molecular
orbitals that the computer

00:20:11.453 --> 00:20:14.142
generates for this thing,
using what's called a

00:20:14.142 --> 00:20:18.534
"minimal basis set";
that is, the lowest number of

00:20:18.534 --> 00:20:23.343
orbitals you can use to get --
that is, through the valence

00:20:23.343 --> 00:20:26.700
level;
you don't put the higher ones

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.058
in.
 

00:20:27.058 --> 00:20:30.114
Okay, now that's how the
computer does it.

00:20:30.114 --> 00:20:30.710
Right?
 

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.190
And you can get good numbers
out of the computer,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.355
like the energy of the
molecule, or the shape of the

00:20:35.355 --> 00:20:37.721
molecule,
where the nuclei would like to

00:20:37.721 --> 00:20:39.180
be to minimize the energy.
 

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.459
That's fine,
but for understanding it's not

00:20:42.459 --> 00:20:43.240
so good.
 

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.990
What we want to do,
as chemists to understand it,

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.818
is to partition the total
electron density,

00:20:48.818 --> 00:20:54.190
not into these molecular
orbitals, but into atom-pair

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.228
bonds,
and anti-bonds,

00:20:56.228 --> 00:20:58.519
as you'll see,
and lone pairs;

00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:03.589
the same stuff Lewis talked
about.

00:21:03.589 --> 00:21:04.160
Okay.
 

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.970
That is, we usually do this,
but sometimes it doesn't work.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.430
And when doesn't it work?
 

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.692
When it doesn't work,
we must use more sophisticated

00:21:14.692 --> 00:21:18.788
orbitals, where we say there is
a certain phenomenon going on.

00:21:18.788 --> 00:21:21.088
You know what that phenomenon
is?

00:21:21.088 --> 00:21:24.680
When we can't use localized
bonds?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.160
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.759
Prof: That's what
resonance is,

00:21:29.759 --> 00:21:32.150
when this approach doesn't
work.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:36.674
Okay, remember that's where
Lewis Theory had to get sort of

00:21:36.674 --> 00:21:38.470
complicated, Baroque.
 

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.227
Okay, so there's that
2p_z orbital,

00:21:42.227 --> 00:21:43.785
a vacant orbital.
 

00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:44.609
Right?
 

00:21:44.609 --> 00:21:46.369
Here's the boron core.
 

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:47.808
But now we're doing it.
 

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:49.809
We're happy to use a vacant
orbital.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.509
That's part of Lewis's idea.
 

00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:54.769
So 2p_z we'll share with
the computer;

00:21:54.769 --> 00:21:56.690
both of us see that as a lowest
vacant orbital.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.059
The boron core we understand
quite well.

00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:00.778
Okay?
 

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:03.739
But how are we going to treat
those other three pairs of

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.160
electrons, in the picture Lewis
would draw?

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.970
Where would Lewis put those
three pairs of dots?

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.579
Angela?
 

00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:13.230
Can't hear.
 

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.630
Student:  He'd make them
the bonds between --

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.190
Prof: Those would be the
bonds, between B and H.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.088
Okay?
 

00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:22.442
So what will those look like in
our crummy picture?

00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:22.980
Right?
 

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.358
We're not as good,
at least I'm not as good as the

00:22:25.358 --> 00:22:27.058
computer at drawing these
things.

00:22:27.058 --> 00:22:30.180
But what I'd say,
it's going to be an orbital

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.230
that's big on hydrogen,
smaller on boron;

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:37.641
some hybrid sp^2 hybrid
of boron is going to overlap

00:22:37.641 --> 00:22:40.759
with the 1s orbital of
hydrogen.

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:42.710
It's going to be bigger on
hydrogen than on boron.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.858
Why?
 

00:22:43.858 --> 00:22:46.935
Why should the lowest,
the bonding orbital,

00:22:46.935 --> 00:22:49.720
be bigger on hydrogen than on
boron?

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.160
Lucas?
 

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.789
Student:  The 1s
is more shielding.

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:55.269
Prof: Yes.
 

00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:59.867
That's another -- that that
orbital, the hydrogen orbital,

00:22:59.867 --> 00:23:03.903
is lower in energy than the
boron it's mixing with.

00:23:03.903 --> 00:23:04.710
Right?
 

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.210
So it's uneven mixing. Right?
 

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.108
Poor energy match.
 

00:23:08.108 --> 00:23:11.252
So the one that went down looks
mostly like the hydrogen,

00:23:11.252 --> 00:23:14.338
and the one that went up looks
mostly like the boron.

00:23:14.338 --> 00:23:17.019
So we see one -- in fact,
we see three of these,

00:23:17.019 --> 00:23:18.900
one pointing toward each
hydrogen.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.470
Right?
 

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.142
From our point of view they all
have the same energy,

00:23:23.142 --> 00:23:26.673
they're all B-H bonds,
shown as their energy in red

00:23:26.673 --> 00:23:27.380
there.
 

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.269
Okay?
 

00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:31.990
But notice, you get the same
total energy,

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.170
as the computer would.
 

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.025
The computer divides the pie
completely differently.

00:23:38.025 --> 00:23:38.630
Right?
 

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:42.818
But you get the same answer --
right?

00:23:42.818 --> 00:23:45.413
-- and the same geometry that
the computer does,

00:23:45.413 --> 00:23:48.727
from the point of view of what
direction do the hybrids point

00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:49.500
and so on.
 

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.990
So we're getting the same
structure, we're getting the

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.650
same energy.
 

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:57.377
You get the same total electron
density too, if you add all the

00:23:57.377 --> 00:23:58.980
electrons together.
 

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.855
Three bonds add together to
give the -- the same way,

00:24:01.855 --> 00:24:04.621
remember, three p
orbitals added up together

00:24:04.621 --> 00:24:05.560
to give a sphere.
 

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.170
Right?
 

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:11.710
Our three bonds add up to give
the same energy as the computer.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.118
So who needs a computer? Right?
 

00:24:14.118 --> 00:24:17.980
Our bonds work just as well,
if we view them right.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.980
Okay?
 

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.269
And then there would be the
anti-bond, the one that's --

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:26.156
what's left over,
that's big on boron,

00:24:26.156 --> 00:24:30.368
small on H, and a node between
hydrogen and boron;

00:24:30.368 --> 00:24:33.123
it's antibonding,
the one that went up in energy

00:24:33.123 --> 00:24:34.940
when the atoms came together.
 

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.913
And again there'd be three of
these Ïƒ*'s,

00:24:38.913 --> 00:24:40.940
big on boron,
small on H.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.269
They would all have the same
energy.

00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:45.550
But again their average energy
is the same as the average

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.358
energy of unoccupied molecular
orbitals that the computer gets.

00:24:49.358 --> 00:24:53.311
So we're not doing so bad,
following Lewis in this

00:24:53.311 --> 00:24:56.690
respect,
looking at the electron density

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.670
in terms of bonds rather than in
terms of molecular orbitals.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.368
Okay?
 

00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:05.621
So for many purposes,
localized bond orbitals are not

00:25:05.621 --> 00:25:09.183
bad, and they're certainly a
heck of a lot easier to think

00:25:09.183 --> 00:25:09.809
about.
 

00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:13.920
But, beware of resonance. Right?
 

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.920
Because sometimes this isn't
going to work.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.588
So we'll have to understand how
that works.

00:25:17.588 --> 00:25:21.609
So the localized bond orbital
picture, pairwise molecular

00:25:21.609 --> 00:25:23.589
orbitals;
that is, two atoms coming

00:25:23.589 --> 00:25:24.588
together to overlap.
 

00:25:24.588 --> 00:25:27.480
And also there'll be isolated
atomic orbitals,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.140
like unshared pairs,
or isolated vacant orbitals,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.078
like the p_z orbital of
boron that we just saw,

00:25:34.078 --> 00:25:38.175
that will be -- this picture
will be our intermediate between

00:25:38.175 --> 00:25:41.746
hydrogen-like atomic orbitals,
which we really understand --

00:25:41.746 --> 00:25:43.971
you just look up in the table
and you've got them,

00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:44.380
right?
 

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.516
-- and computer molecular
orbitals, which are too

00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:51.240
complicated really to understand
in any kind of detail.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.775
It's handy to sometimes -- for
some purposes it's very handy to

00:25:54.775 --> 00:25:57.169
be able to calculate them and
look at them,

00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.740
right?
 

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.578
But you don't do it very often
in your head.

00:26:00.578 --> 00:26:02.980
So when must we think more
deeply?

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:08.573
When you have these localized
orbitals, but they mix,

00:26:08.573 --> 00:26:12.641
to cause reactivity;
that is, a molecular orbital

00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:16.163
from this molecule mixes with a
molecular orbital from this

00:26:16.163 --> 00:26:19.019
molecule, and one goes down and
one goes up.

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:21.298
That's what a reaction is.
 

00:26:21.298 --> 00:26:29.048
Or when you have two pairwise
orbitals in the same molecule,

00:26:29.048 --> 00:26:31.958
that we thought of as bonds or
vacant orbitals or something

00:26:31.958 --> 00:26:34.266
like that,
and those interact with one

00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:37.078
another,
within the same molecule.

00:26:37.078 --> 00:26:41.069
We were too simplistic in
thinking of them as independent.

00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:42.730
They interact with one another.
 

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.659
That's what resonance -- that's
when resonance occurs is when

00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:50.130
you have important interactions
within a molecule,

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.342
between orbitals,
or between what you thought

00:26:53.342 --> 00:26:56.569
were orbitals;
but were thinking too simply.

00:26:56.569 --> 00:26:57.970
So where are we?
 

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.011
We've gone through atoms,
we've gone through molecules,

00:27:01.011 --> 00:27:04.112
and looked at how we can
understand the electron density

00:27:04.112 --> 00:27:05.068
in molecules.
 

00:27:05.068 --> 00:27:09.368
And now we're to the final
payoff, which is reactivity.

00:27:09.368 --> 00:27:13.633
How can we understand
reactivity in terms of SOMOs,

00:27:13.633 --> 00:27:17.555
Singly Occupied Molecular
Orbitals, high HOMOs,

00:27:17.555 --> 00:27:19.088
and low LUMOs?
 

00:27:19.088 --> 00:27:22.598
And then how can we recognize
functional groups?

00:27:22.598 --> 00:27:26.574
So even if we never saw them
before, we know how reactive

00:27:26.574 --> 00:27:29.200
they're going to be,
and what with;

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.500
that's the payoff.
 

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.512
Okay, so now we know that if
you have two molecules and

00:27:33.512 --> 00:27:35.690
you're interested in their
reacting,

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.762
there'll be molecular orbitals
of the two that come together,

00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:40.509
interact.
 

00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:44.073
And if the molecule gets -- if
the energy goes down because of

00:27:44.073 --> 00:27:46.410
that, that'll be a favorable
reaction.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.569
If the energy goes up,
they'll bounce off one another.

00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:51.220
Okay?
 

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.968
So, but how many molecular
orbitals are there on a

00:27:54.968 --> 00:27:55.808
molecule?
 

00:27:55.808 --> 00:28:00.380
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.968
Prof: Suppose methane,
how many molecular orbitals

00:28:03.968 --> 00:28:04.930
does it have?
 

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:06.930
It has an infinite number,
right?

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.500
The 13z orbital and so
on.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.338
Okay?
 

00:28:11.338 --> 00:28:14.721
So we have to pick out which
orbitals are going to be

00:28:14.721 --> 00:28:17.650
important in interacting with
one another,

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.809
or else we're just going to be
at a loss,

00:28:19.809 --> 00:28:21.220
because there'll be so many.
 

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.551
So you have these orbitals on
molecule B, say,

00:28:25.551 --> 00:28:30.654
and those are occupied,
and the ones above are vacant,

00:28:30.654 --> 00:28:32.098
unoccupied.
 

00:28:32.098 --> 00:28:35.568
And on molecule A you have a
bunch of occupied and a bunch of

00:28:35.568 --> 00:28:37.420
unoccupied molecular orbitals.
 

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.032
And now we're going to look at
orbitals of B mixing with

00:28:42.032 --> 00:28:44.130
orbitals of A. Right?
 

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.058
And which ones?
 

00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:48.234
We might look at those two
interacting, for example,

00:28:48.234 --> 00:28:50.288
mix those two,
between A and B.

00:28:50.288 --> 00:28:52.607
Or we could mix those two,
or those two,

00:28:52.607 --> 00:28:54.153
or those two,
or those two,

00:28:54.153 --> 00:28:55.699
or those two,
or those two,

00:28:55.699 --> 00:28:57.779
or those two,
or those two --

00:28:57.779 --> 00:28:59.420
and it goes up infinitely.
 

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.970
So this is a problem.
 

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.064
Even if we understand how
orbitals interact with one

00:29:05.064 --> 00:29:07.977
another, we're going to have to
narrow our focus,

00:29:07.977 --> 00:29:09.980
if we want to deal with this.
 

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.720
Okay?
 

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.788
So there are myriad possible
pairwise mixings.

00:29:14.788 --> 00:29:19.410
Now there's one that's going to
be obviously important.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.299
Suppose that molecule B has an
odd number of electrons,

00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:26.829
and therefore a singly occupied
molecular orbital,

00:29:26.829 --> 00:29:29.640
and the same is true of
molecule A;

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.262
just suppose that happens.
 

00:29:31.262 --> 00:29:31.700
Right?
 

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:38.471
Then when they come together
and mix, those two electrons

00:29:38.471 --> 00:29:42.098
will both go down in energy.
 

00:29:42.098 --> 00:29:46.138
So that's bound to be
favorable, substantially

00:29:46.138 --> 00:29:49.640
favorable, and you'll get a new
bond.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.529
That's like two hydrogen atoms
coming together.

00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:57.615
So if there are SOMOs,
on the two molecules -- and

00:29:57.615 --> 00:30:03.078
notice, suppose B had a SOMO but
A didn't.

00:30:03.078 --> 00:30:05.637
But you're not just talking
about two molecules,

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.490
you're talking about two
flasks.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:12.569
If you mix -- you had to have
two B's that both had SOMOs.

00:30:12.569 --> 00:30:14.890
So A could be another B.
 

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.970
So if you have any SOMOs,
you can pair them;

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.132
B with B, if A doesn't have
any.

00:30:21.132 --> 00:30:21.690
Right?
 

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.170
So if they exist,
if there's a SOMO,

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.180
then -- and that's true of many
atoms,

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.910
or things called free radicals,
like the hydrogen atom,

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:33.470
the chlorine atom,
the methyl radical --

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.960
then they're going to be very
reactive.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.548
Okay?
 

00:30:37.548 --> 00:30:40.920
And for that very reason
they're not very common.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.732
You can't buy a bottle of
methyl radicals because they

00:30:43.732 --> 00:30:45.910
will all have reacted with one
another.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.838
The same for hydrogen atoms,
the same for chlorine atoms.

00:30:49.838 --> 00:30:53.598
So that's an easy case to
understand, when you have SOMOs.

00:30:53.598 --> 00:30:57.637
But it's very rare to encounter
it, unless you're talking about

00:30:57.637 --> 00:31:01.286
flames, where lots of things are
atoms and free radicals,

00:31:01.286 --> 00:31:02.720
as they're called.
 

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.259
We'll talk about that a lot
more at the end of the semester.

00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:08.608
Okay, now how about -- there
are two that could mix.

00:31:08.608 --> 00:31:10.910
It's not bad energy match,
right?

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.509
And suppose they have good
overlap.

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:16.049
Do you care about that one?
 

00:31:16.049 --> 00:31:16.559
Why not?
 

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:17.190
Lucas?
 

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.450
Student:  It doesn't
exist.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.318
Prof: Oh it exists,
it's an orbital.

00:31:20.318 --> 00:31:20.818
Student:  Oh,
there are no electrons.

00:31:20.818 --> 00:31:22.759
Prof: There are no
electrons to have that energy.

00:31:22.759 --> 00:31:26.853
It's an available energy,
but nobody availed themselves

00:31:26.853 --> 00:31:27.460
of it.
 

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.391
So it doesn't contribute
anything.

00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:29.859
Right?
 

00:31:29.859 --> 00:31:32.160
So there's nothing there.
 

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.430
So forget that one.
 

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.909
And you can forget most of them
for this reason,

00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:39.759
of the infinite number.
 

00:31:39.759 --> 00:31:42.048
Okay, now how about this pair?
 

00:31:42.048 --> 00:31:46.210
Now they have -- let's suppose
they have good overlap.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.489
They're not bad energy match.
 

00:31:48.489 --> 00:31:49.038
Right?
 

00:31:49.038 --> 00:31:51.779
So two electrons will go down
and two will go up.

00:31:51.779 --> 00:31:54.240
Do you care?
 

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.288
Steven?
 

00:31:56.288 --> 00:31:58.998
Student:  No,
because since there's two that

00:31:58.998 --> 00:32:01.220
are higher energy,
they're antibonding.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.359
Prof: Yes.
 

00:32:02.359 --> 00:32:03.859
So they'd more or less cancel.
 

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:05.549
Do they exactly cancel?
 

00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:06.828
Students:  No.
 

00:32:06.828 --> 00:32:08.549
Prof: In which direction
do they not cancel?

00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:09.078
Corey?
 

00:32:09.078 --> 00:32:14.240
Student:  The lower one
is bigger, so it would be even

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:14.930
worse.
 

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.318
Prof: The lower one is
bonding,

00:32:16.318 --> 00:32:18.553
but bigger -- by bigger,
you mean greater than

00:32:18.553 --> 00:32:20.288
1/âˆš2 kinds of
thing;

00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:23.068
or no, pardon me,
less than 1/âˆš2,

00:32:23.068 --> 00:32:25.849
it's smaller,
is what you should have said.

00:32:25.849 --> 00:32:27.259
Okay, it's smaller.
 

00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:29.990
So it doesn't go down as much
as the upper one goes up.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.490
So pretty much they cancel.
 

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.237
But to the extent they don't
cancel, it's repulsive,

00:32:36.237 --> 00:32:39.253
it's bad to come together,
which means the molecules will

00:32:39.253 --> 00:32:39.846
bounce off.
 

00:32:39.846 --> 00:32:40.440
Right?
 

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.547
So when you have filled
orbitals hitting one another,

00:32:43.547 --> 00:32:45.579
the molecules repel one
another.

00:32:45.579 --> 00:32:46.640
Okay?
 

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.970
So that's weak net repulsion.
 

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.220
That's not going to explain a
reaction.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.390
Now how about here?
 

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.490
Now we're mixing a filled
orbital with a vacant orbital.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.680
So two electrons go down.
 

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.038
So you don't have this
canceling.

00:33:02.038 --> 00:33:04.190
Is this going to be important,
this one?

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.618
Josh?
 

00:33:05.618 --> 00:33:06.838
Student:  No,
bad energy match.

00:33:06.838 --> 00:33:09.586
Prof: Ah,
the energy match is so bad that

00:33:09.586 --> 00:33:11.750
you don't get very much going
down;

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.268
not enough to make up for the
fact that if they'll come

00:33:15.268 --> 00:33:17.326
together,
there are going to be a lot of

00:33:17.326 --> 00:33:18.906
other orbitals,
molecular orbitals,

00:33:18.906 --> 00:33:20.487
overlapping,
and they're going to be

00:33:20.487 --> 00:33:22.288
repulsive,
the kind we just looked at.

00:33:22.288 --> 00:33:25.750
So this weak attraction is not
going to be worth much.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:30.990
So it's negligible mixing
because of bad energy match.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.339
Now how about here?
 

00:33:34.339 --> 00:33:38.234
Now that's not bad energy match;
I mean, it's not great energy

00:33:38.234 --> 00:33:42.308
match, but it's certainly better
than any other pair of occupied

00:33:42.308 --> 00:33:43.279
with vacant.
 

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:43.880
Okay?
 

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.348
So that means that pair will go
down -- right?

00:33:48.348 --> 00:33:52.537
-- and you'll get bonding,
if the energy match is good

00:33:52.537 --> 00:33:57.119
enough that the amount that they
go down is significant.

00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.220
Okay?
 

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.864
So remember,
when we tried the same thing

00:33:59.864 --> 00:34:02.430
the other direction,
from the highest one on the

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.710
right to the lowest one on the
left,

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.839
the energy match was not good.
 

00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:08.409
So that didn't help.
 

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:11.059
But this one,
where it's high on the left and

00:34:11.059 --> 00:34:13.409
low on the right,
that one will help.

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:19.170
Okay, so what it requires,
to have a reaction,

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:25.380
is that you have a high HOMO,
an unusually high HOMO,

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.983
on one molecule,
and an unusually low LUMO on

00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:31.916
the other,
so that you have good energy

00:34:31.916 --> 00:34:34.335
match,
or at least as good as you can

00:34:34.335 --> 00:34:34.586
get.
 

00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:35.090
Right?
 

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.909
Then you could get a reaction.
 

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:41.523
And it turns out that there are
simple names for things that

00:34:41.523 --> 00:34:46.137
have unusually high HOMOs and
things that have unusually low

00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:46.920
LUMOs.
 

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.809
And you know what those names
are?

00:34:48.809 --> 00:34:52.239
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:57.762
Prof: Something that has
an unusually high HOMO is called

00:34:57.762 --> 00:35:00.302
a base,
and something that has an

00:35:00.302 --> 00:35:03.469
unusually low LUMO is called --
Students:  Acid.

00:35:03.469 --> 00:35:07.730
Prof: An acid. Right?
 

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:12.130
So that's a generalization of
the idea of acid and base.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:16.532
Most mixing of MOs affects
neither the overall energy,

00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:19.606
nor the overall electron
distribution,

00:35:19.606 --> 00:35:22.679
for one or more of these
reasons.

00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:23.539
Okay?
 

00:35:23.539 --> 00:35:26.559
First the electron occupancy
can be four;

00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:28.784
that is, both were occupied,
which means two go up and two

00:35:28.784 --> 00:35:30.969
go down, and the ones that go
up, go up a little more.

00:35:30.969 --> 00:35:32.119
So that's not a bond.
 

00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:35.219
Or zero, and you don't care
about the energy.

00:35:35.219 --> 00:35:39.724
Or the energy match is poor,
so there's not much mixing all

00:35:39.724 --> 00:35:40.579
together.
 

00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:43.610
Or there's poor overlap.
 

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.791
So even if the energy match
were good, you wouldn't get

00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:48.030
anything out of it.
 

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.904
But, if you have high HOMO and
low LUMO mixing,

00:35:52.904 --> 00:35:57.746
then you get reactivity;
unusually high HOMO and

00:35:57.746 --> 00:35:59.559
unusually low LUMO.
 

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:04.210
And that's the secret we've
been going for all semester.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:09.440
So here's increasing generality
in the concept of acid and base.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.164
The names were introduced by
Lavoisier, in 1789,

00:36:14.164 --> 00:36:16.980
and we'll talk about that.
 

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.373
And from his point of view,
a base was an element,

00:36:20.373 --> 00:36:23.836
a substance that could be
oxidized, and an acid was

00:36:23.836 --> 00:36:26.400
something that had been
oxidized.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.375
Like sulfur was a base;
oxidized sulfur,

00:36:30.375 --> 00:36:32.590
sulfuric acid,
was an acid.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.657
Phosphorus was a base;
oxidized phosphorus was

00:36:35.657 --> 00:36:36.829
phosphoric acid.
 

00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:40.550
Carbon was a base;
oxidized carbon was carbonic

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.039
acid.
 

00:36:41.039 --> 00:36:42.099
Okay?
 

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:45.030
Then 100 years later,
Arrhenius, in Sweden,

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.949
said that an acid was something
that was --

00:36:47.949 --> 00:36:50.260
had the idea that there were
ions,

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.063
things that were charged,
and that a thing that would

00:36:54.063 --> 00:36:57.353
give H^+ was an acid,
and a thing that would give

00:36:57.353 --> 00:36:58.320
OH^- was a base.
 

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.949
That's Arrhenius's Theory.
 

00:37:00.949 --> 00:37:03.829
And that was further
generalized, in 1923,

00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:07.641
by Brønsted and Lowry --
Brønsted was a Dane and

00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:12.492
Lowry an Englishman --
who said that an acid was an

00:37:12.492 --> 00:37:15.788
H^+ donor --
that's the same as Arrhenius --

00:37:15.788 --> 00:37:18.760
but that a base was something
that could accept H^+;

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.661
not only OH^-,
but ammonia,

00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:25.570
for example,
could accept a base.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.594
And Lewis then,
in the same year,

00:37:27.594 --> 00:37:31.327
had the idea that an acid was
something that could accept an

00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:34.938
electron pair,
like BH_3, and a base was

00:37:34.938 --> 00:37:39.469
something that could donate an
electron pair,

00:37:39.469 --> 00:37:41.860
like ammonia. Right?
 

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.742
And other names for those
acceptors and donors are

00:37:44.742 --> 00:37:47.744
electrophile,
something that loves electrons,

00:37:47.744 --> 00:37:50.413
will accept them;
and a nucleophile,

00:37:50.413 --> 00:37:53.739
something that loves a nucleus,
is something that will give

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:54.829
electrons to it.
 

00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:59.849
But in the 1960s this was
generalized finally to where it

00:37:59.849 --> 00:38:05.318
is now, that an unusually low
vacant orbital is something that

00:38:05.318 --> 00:38:10.143
can accept electrons;
electrons like to be in a low

00:38:10.143 --> 00:38:11.570
energy orbital.
 

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.380
So that is the ultimate
definition of what an acid is.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.902
And by the same token,
an unusually high HOMO has

00:38:18.902 --> 00:38:23.159
electrons that are eager to
avail themselves of some vacant

00:38:23.159 --> 00:38:27.389
orbital, to lower their energy;
and that is a base.

00:38:27.389 --> 00:38:28.099
Okay?
 

00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:31.851
So as so often in science,
as the science matures,

00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:35.449
you get more and more
generality to the idea.

00:38:35.449 --> 00:38:38.878
And HOMO and LUMO,
unusually high HOMO,

00:38:38.878 --> 00:38:42.757
unusually low LUMO,
are the ultimate form of

00:38:42.757 --> 00:38:44.831
acid-base;
and that's what we'll be

00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:45.340
talking about.
 

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.039
But they have to be unusual.
 

00:38:47.039 --> 00:38:50.610
Why do they have to be
unusually high and unusually

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.039
low?
 

00:38:51.039 --> 00:38:54.505
Prof: Because otherwise
you don't have good energy

00:38:54.505 --> 00:38:57.724
match, to change the electron
energies when they come

00:38:57.724 --> 00:38:58.530
together.
 

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:02.710
Okay, now here's what you
should have asked.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:06.730
Unusual: compared to what?
 

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.599
Okay?
 

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:11.199
So here is what -- we're
organic chemists.

00:39:11.199 --> 00:39:14.561
If we were some other kind of
chemists in some other universe,

00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:17.371
dealing with different
elements, we'd have different

00:39:17.371 --> 00:39:18.750
points of comparison.
 

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.657
But what we deal with is things
that have a lot of carbon and

00:39:21.657 --> 00:39:22.579
hydrogen in them.
 

00:39:22.579 --> 00:39:26.318
And by far our most common
bonds are among -- between

00:39:26.318 --> 00:39:29.340
carbons, or between carbon and
hydrogen.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.289
So it turns out that the
valence orbitals of carbon,

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:35.710
the sp hybrid orbitals
of carbon,

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.219
and the 1s orbital of
hydrogen,

00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:41.489
are roughly the same in energy.
 

00:39:41.489 --> 00:39:44.349
For our purposes we'll consider
them to be the same.

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.880
Okay?
 

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.699
So you bring two of these
together, they overlap,

00:39:47.699 --> 00:39:50.579
and you get Ïƒ and
Ïƒ*.

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:53.289
And we've talked about that,
the bonding and the antibonding

00:39:53.289 --> 00:39:53.750
orbital.
 

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:58.141
So most of the occupied
orbitals we're dealing with are

00:39:58.141 --> 00:40:01.639
Ïƒ_CC or
Ïƒ _CH,

00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:05.847
and most of the anti-bonding
orbitals are Ïƒ*_CH

00:40:05.847 --> 00:40:07.559
or Ïƒ*_CC.
 

00:40:07.559 --> 00:40:10.349
So those are our point of
comparison.

00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:15.539
Those are the plain vanilla
electrons and holes.

00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:16.480
Okay?
 

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.132
Now let's look at other things
and see whether they're unusual

00:40:20.132 --> 00:40:21.510
with respect to this.
 

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:26.583
Now there will be several
classes that they fall into.

00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:27.349
Right?
 

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:32.757
So those are the usual LUMO and
the usual HOMO,

00:40:32.757 --> 00:40:35.110
or the CC analogs.
 

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:36.809
Now what could make things
weird?

00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:40.311
One thing could make things
weird is that if you had

00:40:40.311 --> 00:40:44.157
valence-shell atomic orbitals,
that didn't get mixed with

00:40:44.157 --> 00:40:45.050
anything.
 

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.601
So they're not Ïƒ
or Ïƒ*,

00:40:47.601 --> 00:40:50.860
bonding or antibonding;
they're the original orbital,

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.059
in between these.
 

00:40:52.059 --> 00:40:54.210
So that would make things
unusual.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.739
A second one would be a little
bit in between these two.

00:40:57.739 --> 00:41:01.940
If there's no overlap,
then you have unmixed orbitals.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.690
If there's a lot of overlap,
you get bonds.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.786
But there could be poor
overlap, in which case you don't

00:41:07.786 --> 00:41:11.335
go down as far with your bonding
orbital, or up as far with your

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:12.800
anti-bonding orbitals.
 

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.030
So a second case would be poor
overlap.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.400
A third case would be that the
actual atomic energy,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.510
the atomic orbital energy that
you're using,

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.206
the atom you're using,
is not like carbon and

00:41:25.206 --> 00:41:25.880
hydrogen.
 

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.186
So it starts at a completely
different place from where the

00:41:30.186 --> 00:41:34.273
standard orbitals start,
before they make the molecular,

00:41:34.273 --> 00:41:36.130
the bonding orbitals.
 

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.889
And fourth can be if there's
charge around.

00:41:38.889 --> 00:41:41.077
Because obviously if you have a
negative charge,

00:41:41.077 --> 00:41:43.219
it's not such a good place to
put electrons;

00:41:43.219 --> 00:41:45.730
that means the orbitals are
high in energy.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.340
If you have a net positive
charge, it's a good place to put

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.780
electrons;
it's low in energy.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.699
So charge can make it.
 

00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:55.297
So we're going to show examples
of these four contributors that

00:41:55.297 --> 00:41:59.451
will allow you to identify when
a molecule has an unusual

00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:00.563
orbital energy.
 

00:42:00.563 --> 00:42:01.380
Right?
 

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.739
Unusually high HOMO,
unusually low LUMO.

00:42:04.739 --> 00:42:07.831
And then you know that it'll be
a functional group,

00:42:07.831 --> 00:42:10.429
and you also know what it'll
react with.

00:42:10.429 --> 00:42:12.681
Because if you have an
unusually high HOMO,

00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:14.880
it'll react with an unusually
low LUMO;

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.460
and vice versa.
 

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.199
Okay, so first let's look at
the first one,

00:42:20.199 --> 00:42:22.809
unmixed valence-shell atomic
orbitals.

00:42:22.809 --> 00:42:26.750
So H^+, Arrhenius's acid. Right?
 

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:31.289
That's a vacant orbital. Right?
 

00:42:31.289 --> 00:42:32.780
No electron in it.
 

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.639
So that's obviously unusually
low.

00:42:34.639 --> 00:42:37.523
It's where this started,
the 1s of hydrogen,

00:42:37.523 --> 00:42:39.139
before it went up or down.
 

00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:42.074
So if you had H^+,
it would be an unusually low

00:42:42.074 --> 00:42:43.159
vacant orbital.
 

00:42:43.159 --> 00:42:47.179
How about NH_3? Right?
 

00:42:47.179 --> 00:42:50.780
It has an unshared pair,
only on the nitrogen.

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:54.679
Now, it likes being on
nitrogen, compared to carbon or

00:42:54.679 --> 00:42:55.489
hydrogen.
 

00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:56.409
Why?
 

00:42:56.409 --> 00:42:58.679
What makes it better to be on
nitrogen,

00:42:58.679 --> 00:43:01.699
in a valence-shell orbital than
on --

00:43:01.699 --> 00:43:06.641
the unshared pair -- than to be
on an unshared pair on carbon or

00:43:06.641 --> 00:43:07.739
on hydrogen?
 

00:43:07.739 --> 00:43:08.518
Angela?
 

00:43:08.518 --> 00:43:10.409
Student:  There's more
protons in nitrogen.

00:43:10.409 --> 00:43:11.789
Prof: There are more
protons in the nucleus.

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:14.099
It's a lower energy orbital,
to start with.

00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:14.539
Right?
 

00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:17.829
But it didn't mix with anything.
 

00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:20.206
There are N-H bonds,
in ammonia.

00:43:20.206 --> 00:43:20.820
Right?
 

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.425
And they mixed and went way
down in energy,

00:43:23.425 --> 00:43:25.969
and a vacant orbital went up in
energy.

00:43:25.969 --> 00:43:28.789
But the unshared pair didn't
mix with anything.

00:43:28.789 --> 00:43:31.630
So it still has that original
energy.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.489
So it's unusually high.
 

00:43:33.489 --> 00:43:36.179
Compared to what?
 

00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:37.369
Compared to what?
 

00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:38.679
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:40.780
Prof: Ïƒ_CH
or Ïƒ_CC.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.389
That's our point of comparison.
 

00:43:42.389 --> 00:43:49.092
Okay, or the flip side of that
is BH_3, which has a vacant

00:43:49.092 --> 00:43:50.268
orbital.
 

00:43:50.268 --> 00:43:53.871
It's high, to start with,
compared with a hydrogen or a

00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:57.873
carbon, because boron doesn't
have a very big nuclear charge.

00:43:57.873 --> 00:43:58.539
Right?
 

00:43:58.539 --> 00:44:01.324
And its nucleus is screened.
 

00:44:01.324 --> 00:44:02.018
Right?
 

00:44:02.018 --> 00:44:06.809
So it's unusually high for an
atom.

00:44:06.809 --> 00:44:10.079
But it's still atomic,
it didn't mix with anything and

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:10.943
go up further.
 

00:44:10.943 --> 00:44:11.500
Right?
 

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.750
So it's unusually low for a
vacant orbital.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.369
So BH_3 is an unusually low
LUMO.

00:44:18.369 --> 00:44:20.840
So is it an acid or a base?
 

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.929
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:27.519
Student:  An acid.
 

00:44:27.519 --> 00:44:28.329
Prof: Which?
 

00:44:28.329 --> 00:44:29.389
Student:  Both.
 

00:44:29.389 --> 00:44:30.030
Prof: I can't hear you.
 

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.719
Student:  Both.
 

00:44:30.719 --> 00:44:32.510
Prof: You've read
through the lecture.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.750
You don't get to vote
&gt;

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:37.309
It's like H^+, right?
 

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:39.550
An unusually low LUMO.
 

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:40.980
So it's an acid.
 

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.610
How about NH_3?
 

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.170
It's a base,
unusually high HOMO.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.829
Okay, how about water? Right?
 

00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:53.099
It has unshared pairs of
electrons.

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:54.768
Yes Lucas?
 

00:44:54.768 --> 00:44:56.059
Student:  Sort of a side
question.

00:44:56.059 --> 00:45:00.282
Didn't we just say that they
both had these properties

00:45:00.282 --> 00:45:03.309
because they had low nuclear
charge?

00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:06.498
Prof: No,
nitrogen has high -- which has

00:45:06.498 --> 00:45:07.469
low nuclear?
 

00:45:07.469 --> 00:45:10.115
Student:  Nitrogen is,
low nuclear charge compared to

00:45:10.115 --> 00:45:10.519
carbon.
 

00:45:10.519 --> 00:45:11.250
Prof: Yes.
 

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.719
Student:  And BH_3 is
even lower, compared to carbon.

00:45:13.719 --> 00:45:14.869
Prof: Yes.
 

00:45:14.869 --> 00:45:16.893
Student:  But the
energies are completely

00:45:16.893 --> 00:45:19.431
different because it's -- is it
just because of the unshared

00:45:19.431 --> 00:45:19.820
pair?
 

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.461
Prof: But remember,
you have to bear in mind which

00:45:23.461 --> 00:45:25.739
row of the periodic table you're
in.

00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:26.389
Right?
 

00:45:26.389 --> 00:45:29.867
H, true, it only has one
proton, but you're talking a

00:45:29.867 --> 00:45:32.210
1s orbital,
low in energy.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:34.847
For carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, boron,

00:45:34.847 --> 00:45:36.731
you're talking 2s.
 

00:45:36.731 --> 00:45:37.409
Right?
 

00:45:37.409 --> 00:45:42.039
So you're changing the game.
 

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:43.460
Student:  Between
BH_3_ and NH_3?

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.788
Prof: No,
no, not between BH_3_

00:45:44.788 --> 00:45:45.340
and NH_3.
 

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:51.360
NH_3 is unusually high energy
for an occupied orbital.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.567
BH_3 is unusually low;
although it's high,

00:45:54.567 --> 00:45:57.989
compared to nitrogen,
it's low for a vacant orbital.

00:45:57.989 --> 00:46:00.630
It's an unusually low LUMO.
 

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.570
Nitrogen's an unusually high
HOMO.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:05.889
Now oxygen is lower than
nitrogen.

00:46:05.889 --> 00:46:08.090
So water is a base.
 

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:11.813
But it's not as good a base as
ammonia, because its electrons

00:46:11.813 --> 00:46:14.668
aren't as high,
because it has a bigger nuclear

00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:19.293
charge, and the same n;
it's in the first complete row

00:46:19.293 --> 00:46:21.219
in the periodic table.
 

00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:24.320
Okay, OH^- is even higher.
 

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.130
It's a stronger base than water.
 

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:29.630
Why?
 

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:36.150
Why are its electrons higher in
energy than water?

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:37.550
Student:  Less protons.
 

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:38.789
Prof: Got less protons.
 

00:46:38.789 --> 00:46:39.079
Right?
 

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:43.498
It's got a net negative charge,
which makes all the electrons

00:46:43.498 --> 00:46:46.108
high in energy;
and specifically the pair we

00:46:46.108 --> 00:46:48.195
care about, the highest one,
unusually high,

00:46:48.195 --> 00:46:50.039
because it's got a negative
charge.

00:46:50.039 --> 00:46:52.489
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:46:52.489 --> 00:46:57.456
Okay, CH_3^- is even more of a
base, because carbon doesn't

00:46:57.456 --> 00:47:01.909
have as many -- as big a nuclear
charge as oxygen.

00:47:01.909 --> 00:47:06.570
So when it has a negative
charge it's a really high HOMO.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.340
Okay, I got to quit there.
 

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.159
We'll go on to two,
three and four next time.

00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:03.025
(intriguing music)

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:14.370
- All right, everyone. Greetings.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.333
This is the last lecture of this class.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.800
You have an exam in a couple days.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.140
You have a thematic assignment
due a week after that.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.150
The thematic assignment's meant
to be very straightforward.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.530
I don't want you to do extra research.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.840
I want you to pull out some little theme

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.180
that is in the reading
that maybe I've referred to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.310
or haven't referred to at all

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.860
and write something simple
and straightforward about it.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.973
Don't overthink it. Don't overdo it.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.823
Don't make us work too hard.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.990
It's 1500 words.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.943
Pick a theme, it's not gonna be hard.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.740
Can anybody sing?

00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.083
Do you think, can you sing?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.540
Do you know how... what's it called?

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.716
Do you know how the
"Carol of the Bells" goes?

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:06.895
- [Student] No.
- Okay.

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:08.970
(students vocalizes)

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.020
That's it.
(students laughing)

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.120
That's the one. That's the one.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.740
That's the one. Very good.
(students chuckling)

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.810
And you didn't raise
your hand when I asked.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.643
- [Male Student] I know.

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.713
The second question usually
is not great after the first.

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.830
(Timothy and students laughing)

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.663
- All right.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.860
- So we had eight tones
of Christmas music there

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.730
to start us out with,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.580
which I'm gonna get back to, if I manage.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.480
What we're talking about
today is empire in Europe.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.490
And like the last lecture, this lecture

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.060
is meant to bring some threads together

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.710
to help you think about the essays

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.134
and help you think about
the class as a whole.

00:01:48.134 --> 00:01:50.910
We're obviously talking
about this in the context

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.240
of an imperial war that
is going on right now,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.220
the Russian War against
Ukraine, which began in 2014,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.710
and which was accelerated this February

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.350
with a full scale invasion.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.110
I think this is a fairly
straightforward imperial war

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.390
in its rhetoric and in its goals.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.793
I'll talk more about that as we go.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.900
What I want to talk about,
though, in this lecture,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.290
is what this imperial war tells us

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.290
about Europe and the
European imperial past

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.990
and what we can say about the European

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.450
and American reaction to this war

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.230
on the basis of the history of empire.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.930
So a larger theme of this class,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.560
as you've all gathered, is
what is history good for?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.440
What is it and what is it good for?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.570
One of the things that history is good for

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.480
is reflection upon the other stories

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.990
about the past that you are being told.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.380
So there's an obvious criticism,
of course, in this class

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.430
of the imperialist narrative

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.410
that Ukraine doesn't exist,
but perhaps more subtly,

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.040
there's also a criticism
of a European narrative,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.800
which says that European integration

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.650
was born out of the higher European wisdom

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.180
that war is bad and that peace is good.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.270
So if any of you are from
European Union member states,

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.620
you'll be familiar with this,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.250
because you've been bombarded
with it since childhood.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.650
The notion that the
Europeans are different

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.850
and better than the Americans,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.550
because they experienced
a Second World war

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.220
and they saw that it
was bad, and therefore,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.930
they have now had economic cooperation

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.423
and since then, things have been good.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.280
There are a couple of problems with this.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.280
One of them is that what
happened is not that Europeans

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.050
learned from the Second
World War that war is bad.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.400
That never happened.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.024
They kept fighting wars
after the Second World War.

00:03:56.024 --> 00:04:00.240
They kept fighting wars
until they lost them.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.590
That's a critical part of the
story, which goes missing.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.000
The Dutch and Indonesia,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.240
the French in Algeria and Southeast Asia.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.030
The Portuguese and the Spanish
can't hold out in Africa.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.160
It's basically the same story everywhere.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.010
They keep fighting until they lose

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.120
and the wars they lose are imperial wars.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.330
The story of European
integration, as it's told,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.480
allows that imperial
history to be pushed aside,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.000
to be occluded, to be not seen at all

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.760
and because that history
is not seen at all,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.390
this leads to misanalysis
and misunderstandings

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.390
of contemporary political situations.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.890
The other tricky thing about that story

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.070
is that it suggests
that once you've learned

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.663
this lesson that war is bad,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.560
all you have to do is trade with people

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.300
and everything will be good.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.190
To emphasize, the problem with that

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.380
is that the European integration story

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.540
with all the trade,
which certainly happens,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.133
Treaty of Rome and all of that,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.990
it all happens after the
defeat in the imperial war.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.140
And so trade may be very
well, be a good thing.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.390
But in the actual European history,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.340
this trade project follows
upon defeat in imperial war.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.450
And when you take the defeat

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.670
in imperial war out of the story,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.070
you're removing something
which is going to disable

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.070
your analysis of the rest
of contemporary events.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.650
So just very briefly now,
I'm gonna remind you of some

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.410
of the high points of the
history of European Empire.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.470
We've already had a couple
of lectures on this already.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.910
It's in the background of the reading

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.000
in Road to Unfreedom,
Black Earth to some extent,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.110
but I wanna try to make
sense of where we are now

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.930
on the basis of this trajectory of empire.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.410
So from the point of
view of European Empire,

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.790
1776, the great proud
American independent story,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.880
that's when the Northern
Hemisphere basically falls out.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.710
I mean, there will be six... the Spanish

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.270
will be around for a
while, the Portuguese, too,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.120
but 1776 is, basically, you
can call a turning point

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.990
where the Western hemisphere,
where the Americas fall out,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.270
begin to fall out of the calculation,

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.270
empire is going to mean,
essentially, Asia and Africa.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.430
The 19th century is then a competition

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.320
for the territory that's still left.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.050
Most famously or notoriously,
the race for Africa

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.390
at the end of the 19th century.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.223
At the end of the 19th century

00:06:25.223 --> 00:06:26.670
or at the beginning of the 20th,

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.360
we have a First World
War, which is a world war,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.870
even before the Americans
arrive, because of empire.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.310
It's a world war because it's fought

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.640
with colonial soldiers
from all over the world.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.610
It's not a war of Europeans
against Europeans.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.320
It's Europeans and their colonial subjects

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.780
against other Europeans and
their colonial subjects,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.910
which is fought in Europe.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.830
In the end of the First World War,

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.050
what we have is a curious situation

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.660
where the land empires all managed to lose

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.420
and the sea empires, the
maritime empires managed to win.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.550
The British and the French managed to win,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.100
the Ottomans, the Germans, the Russians,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.590
in a complicated way,
by way of revolution,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.780
the Hapsburgs, all manage to lose.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.550
And as we've seen, in this
war, Ukraine is a major prize.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.890
Ukraine is the territory
that the Germans think

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.960
they can use to win the
war on the Western front.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.203
They turn out to be wrong,
but that is what they think.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.580
At the end of this war, we have the rise

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.430
of the doctrine of self-determination,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.410
which means, in effect,
that the maritime empires,

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.720
I'm now counting the US among them,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.580
have the idea that some
of the former territories

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.280
in the land empires in Europe

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.590
should become independent states.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.090
So national self-determination

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.830
does not apply to all the world.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.853
That's a truism.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.250
It was not about American colonies

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.980
or British colonies or
French colonies, far from it.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.320
It was about the former terrains

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.770
of defeated land empires,
but not all of them.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.070
Not not Ukraine. Not Ukraine.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.810
Ukraine instead passes through

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.080
this incredibly complicated
period that we have studied of,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.260
in which you have white Russians,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.360
that is, Russian restorationists of empire

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.950
who are fighting for Ukraine.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.890
We have Poles who, in some
way, are fighting for Ukraine.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.410
We have the Leninist idea
of self-determination,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.570
which basically means we say

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.220
that you can have self-determination,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.440
but so long as it doesn't contradict

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.170
the interests of the
center of the revolution.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.420
So a kind of declarative
self-determination.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.311
And while this is all going on,

00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:38.130
this is why I asked if anybody could sing.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.300
While this is all going
on, musicians from Ukraine

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.510
are on tour across
Europe and North America,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.943
playing, for example, in Carnegie Hall.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.670
The song which drew the most attention

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.600
is the melody which was just sung,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.490
which was composed by a Ukrainian composer

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.460
called Mykola Leontovych,
which really caught

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.050
the attention of the Americans,

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.050
so much so that it was
adapted with new English words

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.340
to become what's now
the Carol of the Bells,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.310
which is the most striking, I think,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.420
American Christmas carol

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.820
and I'm gonna return at
the end to why that is.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.560
Leontovych, himself, is murdered in 1921

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.833
by the Bolshevik secret police.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.760
So then what is the Second World War?

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.040
Again, from the perspective of Ukraine

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.660
or from our perspective,

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.390
the Second World War is
another imperial war.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.820
But this time the German aspiration

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.220
for Ukraine is the absolute center.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.440
It's at the absolute
center of Hitler's plans.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.070
It's at the absolute
center of the war itself.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:49.070
And the theory behind this war,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.550
and you've read all of
this in Black Earth,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.870
but the theory behind this war

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.560
is that the stronger
nation should be colonizing

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.050
and starving the weaker nation,
that's what always happens.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.509
Or the stronger people, the stronger race

00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:03.870
should be dominating, colonizing,
starving out the weaker.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.150
Why does this not always happen?

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.710
According to Hitler, it
doesn't always happen,

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.030
because of the Jews.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.280
That is Hitler's version of antisemitism.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.520
The Jews have ideas like
Christianity, capitalism,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.490
communism, rule of law,
contracts, you name it.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.890
And these ideas get into people's minds

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.720
and prevent them from
becoming the ruthless

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.813
racial warriors that
nature meant them to be.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.270
So in Hitler's view, the
Jews are both softening

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.660
the minds of Germans,
and this is important,

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.120
they're ruling Ukrainians,
because the Soviet Union,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.950
according to Hitler, is a Jewish state.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.670
So the Ukrainians, in his
analysis, are colonial people.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.580
They're being ruled by
one colonist, the Jews

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.050
and if you kill the Jews or get them

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.570
out of the way somehow, the
Ukrainians will be happy

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.690
to be ruled by another colonial master.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.460
That's the theory.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.920
In the planning for the war,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.590
the Germans intends to starve

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.530
tens of millions of Soviet citizens,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.690
tens of millions of Soviet citizens,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.060
in order to colonize
the Western Soviet Union

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.923
and especially, Ukraine.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.913
Tens of millions of Soviet citizens.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.790
The reasons why they
think this is possible

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.520
is because, at the time, everyone knew

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.650
that there was this thing,
which only recently,

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.327
people have started to call Holodomor,

00:11:24.327 --> 00:11:26.880
which is the famine in 1932-1933.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.090
The German analysis is
that the collective farms

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.590
in the Soviet Union can be used

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.320
to divert food in any direction.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.390
So if they can be used to divert
food to feed the Russians,

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.910
they can also be used to divert
food to feed the Ukrainians.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.310
We can use them as
instruments of starvation.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.810
In fact, they're never able to starve

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.100
tens of millions of people.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.590
Most of the starvation takes
place in prisoner of war camps,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.510
where about 3 million Soviet
prisoners of war are starved.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.130
Ukraine, as you know from the reading,

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.620
is also a major site, oh, and by the way,

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.200
Ukrainian soldiers who are starving

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.530
in the German prisoner
of war camps in 1941

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.380
refer to their experience of hunger

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.123
in the Soviet Union in 1933.

00:12:07.163 --> 00:12:10.980
There're even songs which
refer to both of these events.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.150
Ukrainian, as you know from the reading,

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.340
is also a major site of the Holocaust.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.520
Two of the major shooting
sites, Kamianets-Podilskyi

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.450
and Babi Yar just outside Kyiv
are, of course, in Ukraine.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.900
And the war is largely
fought in and for Ukraine.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.100
And so it's very important
for present politics

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.380
and for present conversations
about imperialism

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.070
that we know that this
war was an imperial war.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.970
This is not just some point

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.830
that I'm trying to make on the margin.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.600
It's very important to keep in mind

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.890
that there was an imperial motive,

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.830
an imperial geography to this war

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.480
and that they were
peoples who were subject

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.763
to an imperial policy.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.570
At the end of the Second
World War, once again,

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.270
the maritime empires managed to win.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.120
The British and the French managed to win,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.220
again, with the help of the Americans.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.580
Germany, which is aspiring to
be a much larger land empire,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.470
loses and loses very decisively.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.490
And in losing decisively their
imperial war for Ukraine,

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.380
the Germans begin the trend

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.380
of other European empires
losing imperial wars.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.180
That thing which I've just said

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.730
is the thing which is silenced.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.220
It's silenced that Germany's
war was an imperial war

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.840
and it's silenced that Europeans

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.970
then began to lose a
series of imperial wars.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.070
And how is that silence achieved?

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.260
It's achieved by the otherwise

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.440
very attractive story
of European integration.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.570
The story about how
Europeans are very wise,

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.950
and they understand that war is bad,

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.300
because they're smarter than the Americans

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.550
who keep fighting wars,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:50.310
And so in this story, it's
the empire that goes missing

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.470
and it's most crucially, the story

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.800
of the German empire which goes missing.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.140
So Ukraine goes missing just as Indonesia

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.630
and Algeria and Morocco and Mozambique

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.110
and all the rest go
missing from this story.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.230
But as I say, this is most
important for the Germans.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.640
This lecture is about empire

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.590
and you think I'm only gonna
be talking about Russia,

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.490
but I'm gonna be spending a lot

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.470
of time talking about Germany.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.530
Russian imperialism is,
right now, very open.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.770
It's not very complicated,
we'll talk more about it,

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.800
but crucial to where we
are in the 21st century

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.640
is the misanalysis, the
misapprehension and forgetfulness

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.630
about German colonialism
and German empire.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.820
And as I say, one of the
things history is good for,

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.610
maybe the major thing,
is to create reflection

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.800
about the things that one got wrong

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.210
or the things that one missed.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:44.210
So in Germany, from 1945 and 1989,

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.860
the main story is the
division of the country.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.560
Germany loses its Eastern territories.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.460
What remains of Germany is divided

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.440
into a West Germany
and to an East Germany.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.410
One Democratic, one communist.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.810
From the point of view of West Germany,

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:05.730
the major story is of
one's own victimhood,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.200
one's own victimhood.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.050
We were bombed at the end of the war.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.270
So many of our men died.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.950
We lost all of this territory.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.410
Our country was divided.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.010
So the major story in the 50s, 60s,

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.360
into the 70s is one's own victimhood.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.460
So this business of Germany
taking responsibility

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.500
for the Second World War is a relatively

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.993
recent development and quite partial.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.860
The discussion of German
responsibility for the war

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.930
begins as a discussion of the Holocaust,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.580
which is very important.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.860
It allows other discussions

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.770
and it's tremendously
important in and of itself.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.660
The problem with the
discussion of the Holocaust,

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.170
which takes place in
Germany in the 70s and 80s,

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.290
is that it's missing a
lot of important things.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.520
It's missing any discussion
of East European territories.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.901
It's missing any discussion
of territory at all.

00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:03.240
And it's missing, perhaps most critically,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.150
the German imperialism,
which got Germany out

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.770
into Eastern Europe in the first place,

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.600
which is a crucial part of
the history of the Holocaust,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.640
because that is where the Jews lived.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.820
So without the German imperial
ambition to get to Ukraine,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.140
there couldn't have been a Holocaust,

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.060
because those territories
are where the Jews

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.240
or most of the Jews actually lived.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.310
So in this discussion of the Holocaust,

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.440
one of the things which is missing

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.300
is the German imperial ambition.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.210
So you get self-criticism
about the Holocaust,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.450
but it's limited, it
doesn't have territory.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.040
And the Jews who are most important

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.200
in this discussion are the German Jews.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.780
And of course, that is a
very important history.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.910
But German Jews are only about 3%

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.150
of the victims of the
Holocaust, only about 3%.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.270
And so that story can't
be a representative one

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.670
and it can't be one which
is going to get Germans

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.840
to think about the broader
geographical scope of the war.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.120
And then, indeed, it tends to be one...

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.280
Whereas, the history of the
Holocaust tends to move you

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.590
to a place where you can
talk about other crimes.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.140
So for example, Jews in Eastern Europe

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.690
are some of our witnesses
to the starvation

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.520
of Soviet prisoners of war.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.930
In Jewish testimonial material,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.720
there is evidence of the starvation

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.160
of Soviet prisoners of war.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.870
If you focus on Germany,

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.460
all you have are the Germans and the Jews,

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.797
which is a very different sort of story

00:17:19.797 --> 00:17:22.920
and you're not being forced to
think about the other crimes,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.953
let alone the other peoples further east.

00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:33.450
In the 1970s, West German
social democratic governments

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.370
begin a process of reconciliation
with the Soviet Union.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.980
And this is a Soviet Union, which you know

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.483
from the reading from the class,

00:17:42.483 --> 00:17:45.810
this is the Soviet Union of Brezhnev.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.770
And so what we have
underneath this reconciliation

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.680
is the meeting of two stories
about what actually happened

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.730
in the Second World War.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.300
And by this time, by the
1970s, there's a Soviet story

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.450
and the Soviet story is a cult of the war

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.550
in which we were the victims
as well as the victors,

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.460
the Molotov-Ribbentrop
Pact and Soviet Alliance

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.440
with Nazi Germany, completely taboo.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.003
The documents are hidden away.
No one's remembering that.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.707
It's a Russified cult of the war.

00:18:20.707 --> 00:18:22.833
It's a Russified cult of the war.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.900
This meets a German story in
which Germans are increasingly

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.200
willing to take responsibility
for the Second World War

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.290
and the way that Germans
move in this direction

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.480
is to direct the apologetic energy

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.880
towards the Moscow Center.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.120
And so in Germany as in the Soviet Union,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.950
the idea that the Second World War

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.720
was about tens of millions of
dead Russians becomes normal.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.340
Now, the Second World War did involve

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.050
millions of dead Russians,

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.730
but the scale of suffering was
actually greater in Ukraine

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.340
and in Belarus than it was in Russia.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.550
And the story in which Russia monopolizes

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.530
both the victory and the victimhood

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.710
also starts to become natural in Germany.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.900
And so then, in this weird way,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.900
what is actually meeting is
a Russian quiet imperialism,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.750
the administrative
Russification of the 1970s

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.770
with a German or with the
remnants of a German imperialism,

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.190
or German implicit imperialism,
or at the very least,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.150
the total absence of a reckoning
with German imperialism,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.860
which means that it's totally natural

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.460
that in this situation, no one
talks about Ukraine, at all.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.530
No one talks about Ukraine, at all.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.540
The Germans have no reason
to talk about Ukraine,

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.420
because there's been no
historical reckoning.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.820
And so Russia's silences about Ukraine

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.453
or control about Ukraine
seems completely natural.

00:19:52.031 --> 00:19:56.160
After 1989, we reach a
moment where we have,

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.440
as you've seen already in this class,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.310
After 1989, we're in a
moment of tremendous change

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.000
of rapid geopolitical realignment,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.730
where, from the German point of view,

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.930
and we're now under Christian

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.330
democratic governments
headed by Helmut Kohl,

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.070
from the German point of view,

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.960
what we have is historical justice.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.190
We have a unification.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.850
East Germany and West
Germany are brought together.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.340
The most interesting anti-imperial move

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.560
that's made at this time was made,

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.930
as we've seen again in the
lectures and the reading,

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.180
was made by the Poles, actually.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.940
When the Poles recognize
the Ukrainian border

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.770
before Ukraine is even independent,

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.970
they're making an anti-imperial
move vis-a-vis themselves,

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.490
which makes it much easier for the Germans

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.100
to make the same move vis-a-vis Poland.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.890
Because all the way up until 1990,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.740
Germany had not recognized
its border with Poland.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.200
The fact that the Poles
put any national quarrels

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.940
with Ukrainians out of the question

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.130
made it somewhat more
likely that the same outcome

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.893
would prevail on the German-Polish border.

00:21:00.275 --> 00:21:02.640
And the lack of national
conflict or border conflict

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.040
is one of the reasons
why the European Union

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.860
can enlarge as it will to embrace many

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.860
of the former communist
states in 2004, 2007, 2013.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.500
During this time, Germany is
the most important democracy

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.220
in Europe, unified Germany.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.630
It's the biggest economy.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.910
It's a very functional democracy.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.610
It may already be the most
important democracy in the world,

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.410
but you can't tell the Germans that.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.540
And as we enter the 21st century,

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.870
the Germans have a reputation

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.360
for having dealt with the past,

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.873
which is only partially justified.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.940
One has to be very careful here,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.160
because the Germans are, of course,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.220
pioneers in identifying a
particular historical evil,

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.300
which is the Holocaust,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.160
and beginning a story of addressing it.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.620
And that has been good
for their democracy.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.240
And I suggest, in
general, that those kinds

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.970
of things are good for democracy.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.250
The problem with this reflection

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.430
is that it was thought
to have been completed.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.560
The idea was that by the time we got

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.850
to the end of the Cold War,

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.970
we, the Germans, have already
gone through this process

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.930
and now, we're in a position
to be a model for other people.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.720
Whereas in fact, the end
of the Cold War created,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.790
I would've said, an opportunity to think

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.620
about eastern Europe more broadly

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.020
and about the German war
in the East more broadly,

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.483
which is the thing that doesn't happen.

00:22:31.095 --> 00:22:33.840
So the form the criticism very often takes

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.360
is that other people in Eastern Europe,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.660
in Poland, for example, or in Ukraine,

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.500
don't understand how important peace is.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.220
So peace is the crucial category.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.720
What the Germans will say again and again,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.520
and here I say the Germans
with some confidence,

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.320
because this is a consensus which goes,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.240
which spans most of
the political spectrum,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.180
is that peace is the important thing.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.270
But peace is not what happened to Germany.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.870
Defeat is what happened to Germany.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.790
But you won't find Germans arguing

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.430
that imperial powers have to be defeated.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:12.063
What you find them arguing is
that peace is a good thing.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.500
So there's no reflection on empire.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.500
There's no imperial
analysis in this framework.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.270
There is room for criticism

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.780
of decline of democracy in a minor key,

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.530
but here, the Germans, and
again, this is a broad consensus,

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.110
generally miss the most
important and obvious case,

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:38.070
the decline of democracy, which
is Russia in 1999 to 2000,

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.380
or maybe Russia, 1993 to 2000.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.590
But in any event, the rise
of Putin in 1999 to 2000

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.560
is a hugely important turning point,

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.870
because it's here that Russia fails

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.440
to have competitive elections
where one Russian president,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.490
Yeltsin, anoints the next one, Putin,

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.470
Putin stages a war.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.170
And so you avoid that
thing, which is so crucial

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.550
for the success of a democratic system,

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.760
in which somebody coming from
somewhere else unexpectedly

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.790
is a candidate and wins, and wins.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.220
Here you have instead the person
at the center of the system

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.770
picking the next person who's
the center of the system.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.310
This is the moment where
Russian democracy fails.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.000
Likewise, there was very
little recognition in Germany,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.190
I think it's fair to
say, of the significance

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.730
of the reverse happening
in 2004, 2005 in Ukraine.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.920
In 2004, there was
similarly attempt in Ukraine

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.530
for a president to anoint his successor

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.090
and then elections were faked

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.980
to see that that successor would win

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.550
and this was held off by
civil society protest.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.220
And in this way, Ukrainians
were able to arrange

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.230
for an actual democratic succession

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.070
where the person that the incumbent wanted

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.540
to come into power to succeed him

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.903
did not actually come to
power and someone else did.

00:24:55.378 --> 00:24:58.050
So 2004, at this time....

00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.760
There's something I have
to go on the record now.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.400
It's at this time when Gerhard Schroeder,

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.400
who's the social democratic,
now, prime minister of Germany,

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.150
it's at this time, November 2004,

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.600
that Schroeder says Putin
is a flawless Democrat.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.920
And that kind of rhetoric from Schroeder

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.620
is going to continue, essentially,

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.893
almost to the present day.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.970
In the 21st century, under Schroeder

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:30.330
and then under his
successor, Angela Merkel,

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.520
the key that the Germans tend to apply

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.520
in their foreign policy
towards Russia is economics.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.980
And I wanna stress this point again,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.240
although I'm sure it's clear,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.910
this arises from a certain misanalysis

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:45.867
of how the European Union

00:25:45.867 --> 00:25:48.540
and how European integration arose.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.100
The theory of European integration

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.983
was war is bad, trade is good.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.280
I mean, one doesn't wanna
dispute those two premises,

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.070
but the missing part in the story is,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.080
we, the Germans, decisively lost a war

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.570
and admit that we lost it. (chuckles)

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.060
We gave up on imperial solutions,

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.370
because we had to 'cause we were defeated

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.830
and then we moved on to something else

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.180
and that that was true of most

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.940
of the other Europeans as well.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.270
And so the economics becomes a magic

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.550
where the notion is, then, if we cooperate

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.830
economically with Russia, for example,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.380
if we buy Russian natural gas,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.870
that must have a positive
effect on Russia,

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.520
because that's the theory.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.290
So Gerhard Schroeder,
who's the leading figure

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:36.290
in all of this, negotiates a
gas pipeline with the Russians

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.960
a few weeks after he
leaves office in 2005.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.490
In what not only the Germans

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.440
might find to be unseemly haste,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.590
he then joins the board of
the gas company in question

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.270
and is employed, in one way or another,

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.400
by the Russian hydrocarbon industry

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.861
with accumulating titles and salaries

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.083
for the next many years.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.240
This policy, though, in
fairness, one has to say,

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.060
is a consensus policy,
which is then continued

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.890
by the Christian Democrats.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.810
And when I say the Germans
over and over again,

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.588
I'm basically meaning the two Volkspartei

00:27:09.588 --> 00:27:11.853
and the two big parties.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.520
Now, the irony of all of this,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.540
especially given that Schroeder

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.680
is from the Social Democrats,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.200
which, historically, is
an antifascist party,

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.490
the irony of all of this is that

00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:27.270
this is a time when an
astute observer, at least,

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.820
might have noticed that
certain important parts

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.767
of the Russian elite,
including the president

00:27:30.767 --> 00:27:32.340
of the Russian Federation,

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.340
are beginning to talk
in openly fascist terms.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.770
And that the president
of the Russian Federation

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.330
is quoting Russian fascists

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.930
in his most important political addresses.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.930
There is no notice of this in Germany.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.043
No notice at all.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.140
I think the logic of insulating Germany

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.280
from all of this is something like

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.180
we are the antifascists and therefore,

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.910
if we're negotiating with
them, they can't be fascists.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.530
And this logic prevails
deep into the 2020s

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.623
and probably until the
beginning of the war.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.620
So the Maidan of 2013-2014

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.020
can be seen in this light as well.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.440
Actually, the Maidan of 2013-2014,
which you've read about,

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.540
which you've heard about
in a separate lecture,

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.560
confirms this post-imperial
analysis of the EU,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.210
because that's how everybody sees it.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.660
Everybody who matters anyway.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.190
The Ukrainians wanna
join the European Union,

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.110
because they understand
that the European Union

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.890
is there to rescue slightly problematic

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.680
post-imperial states, such as their own.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.540
The Russians wanna stop Ukraine

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.740
from joining the European Union,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.810
because they recognize the same thing.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.690
They understand that should
Ukraine join the European Union,

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.220
it is much more likely that Ukraine

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.230
will become a successful rule-of-law state

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.380
and prosper and become
a model for Russians,

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.910
which, from the point of
view of the Putin regime,

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.280
would be a very bad thing.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.750
Everyone outside the European Union

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.610
sees the logic that I'm trying to share.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.390
It's only inside the European
Union that it becomes unclear.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:13.050
When Russia invades Ukraine in 2014,

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.600
we see the implicit imperialism

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.260
of Russian-German
cooperation become explicit

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.180
in the language which the Russians use

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.520
and which the Germans, then, pick up.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.550
The Russian invasion of Ukrainian in 2014

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.070
is muddled and made unclear

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.410
and a great success for
Russian foreign policy.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.420
And the muddling and the un-clarity

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.370
is a result of certain kinds of tropes

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.770
about Ukrainians, which
are imperial tropes.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.260
That Ukraine was never
really a real state,

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.480
that Ukrainians aren't really a people,

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.390
and if they are a people, they are corrupt

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.640
and their state is gonna
fail because they're corrupt.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.100
And by the way, they're all Nazis.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.283
Oh, and they're gay,
that fit in there, too.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.467
And they were you know...

00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:01.647
(students laughing)

00:30:01.647 --> 00:30:02.760
No, you know how this works.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.820
It's social media targeted
audiences, that's how it works.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.080
If you don't like gay people,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.420
they tell you the Ukrainians are all gay.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.820
If you don't like Nazis, they
tell you they're all Nazis.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.980
If you do like Nazis, they
tell you that they're all Jews.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.480
That also happened.
(students chuckling)

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.933
Social media, it's your
life, you understand this.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:24.060
But this imperial rhetoric,
and here's the point,

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.050
is largely accepted,
at least in 2013-2014,

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.310
in the German media.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.870
At least as the central points

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.520
of discussion, are they all Nazis?

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.190
Which is just a way of asking
are they all barbarians?

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.730
Are they all Nazis? Is it a failed state?

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.670
Did the Ukrainians somehow
bring this upon themselves?

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.933
All of this language,

00:30:43.989 --> 00:30:48.989
which speaks to the German
imperial tradition about Ukraine.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.327
And of course, the Russians

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.903
are consciously manipulating this.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.480
They're consciously playing on

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.300
what they understand to
be German sensibilities.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.460
Now, I said this was
a consensus and it is,

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.670
when after Russia invades Ukraine,

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.070
the Christian Democratic
government under Angela Merkel

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:14.430
then brings into existence Nord Stream 2,

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.850
which is interpreted at
the time by a broad swath

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.400
of Europeans, not just
Ukrainians and Poles,

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.230
but many of Germany's
West European allies,

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.620
as nothing more than a reward
for Russia invading Ukraine.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.320
Because what Nord Stream 2
does is it allows the Russians

00:31:29.616 --> 00:31:33.570
to very easily bring their gas to Europe

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.333
without having it to pass
through Ukrainian territory.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:41.550
So there is a consensus of
implicit imperialism here,

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.219
which has to do with, on the Russian side,

00:31:44.219 --> 00:31:46.470
an aggressive retelling of history,

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:47.760
which I'm gonna say more about now.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.140
But on the German side, a
lack of historical reflection

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.600
combined with a certainty
that the historical reflection

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.720
has already taken place, which
is not only a German problem,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.583
you can find that elsewhere, too.

00:32:03.573 --> 00:32:05.760
So when we get to the war of 2022,

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.710
this is an imperial war,
I think, fairly obviously.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.990
It's an imperial war in
that it's based on a story

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.050
of history in which some people
exist and some people don't.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.360
Putin's account of the
history of Russian Ukraine,

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.950
which he gives in July of 2021,

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.110
tells you that what happens
today is predetermined

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.230
by things that happened
a thousand years ago.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.520
That things that happened
a thousand years ago

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.410
give him the right to say
who's actually a people

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:30.810
and who's actually not a people.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.820
It's imperial in the
classic sense of denying

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.770
that the people you
encounter are a people,

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.150
instead they're a tribe or a clan

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.370
or they're corrupt or whatever.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.140
And it's imperial in the
classic sense of denying

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.730
that the state you encounter is a state,

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:42.960
they're not subject to law,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.960
law doesn't really apply,
what is law anyway?

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.880
The more interesting
thing which is happening,

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.530
continuing the Russia-German theme here,

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.440
is that the Russian invasion of Ukraine

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.170
very, very closely follows the model

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.360
of the German invasion
of the Soviet Union,

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.993
which the Russians themselves
tip off at the very beginning.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.480
They tip this off at the very beginning

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.200
by saying that this is all
a war about de-Nazification

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.150
and all you have to do is remove the de.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:11.790
Just takes a little bit
of Freudian analysis here.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.530
Just a tiny, tiny bit of Freud

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.810
to get what they're really after.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.120
What they're really after
is they're fighting a war

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.090
on the German model, on the German model.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.440
And with the de-Nazification,

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.240
they're doing their
typical thing of rolling

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.740
something in front of the western media,

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.217
especially the German media and saying,

00:33:27.217 --> 00:33:30.030
"Hey, why don't you talk about this.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.920
Let's change the subject to how many Nazis

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.810
there might be in Ukraine, as opposed

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.390
to we're invading the country right now."

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.370
But the de-Nazification thing, I think,

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.980
is actually deeply a
clue to what's happening.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.073
'Cause the similarities are
actually really striking.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.443
The notion that Ukraine only
exists because of conspiracies.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.340
The idea that Russia is not the aggressor,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.290
but it is the victim of conspiracies

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:01.140
and therefore, it must attack Ukraine.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.090
The ideological assumption that the state

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.060
you're attacking doesn't really exist.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.190
It's just propped up by said conspiracies.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.990
So the moment you hit
it, it will fall apart,

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:13.080
which is literally what Hitler
said about the Soviet Union.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.660
Putin says the same thing about Ukraine.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.060
There is also, it's obviously
not nearly as important,

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.550
but there's also an antisemitic element

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.430
in which the thing which is artificial

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:26.250
is the presidency of
Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself,

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:27.363
because he's Jewish.

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:31.410
And that element has
grown larger with time

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:34.320
as the Russian media now
presents Zelenskyy routinely

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.370
as the devil or as the anti-Christ.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.620
Also, the idea which is
practically plagiarized

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.750
that the Ukrainians are a colonial people,

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.250
they have one master now,

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.740
but they would be happier
with a different master.

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.960
Now they have the Americans, the Jews,

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.850
the gay international
conspiracy, whatever,

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.760
they have some master, but
we would be a better master.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.200
But the Ukrainians are colonial people

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.740
and they'll be happy when we
replace the previous master.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.190
All of these ideas are not
just uncomfortably close,

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.430
they're practically copies
of the German motivations

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.943
or the German's stated ideologies
in the invasion in 1941.

00:35:11.249 --> 00:35:13.200
There's even the haunting fact

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.620
that the Russians were
planning one kind of genocide,

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.690
which was the extermination
of the Ukrainian elite,

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.060
and they have since moved on
to other forms of genocide

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.440
when that one didn't work out.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.810
Which again, in a minor key,

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.370
is very similar to what
happened to the Germans

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.320
who were planning a mass
starvation campaign,

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.240
which they were not able to carry out,

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.100
but then moved on to
other forms of genocide

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.950
when the war actually continued.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.110
So the actual policies of Russian Ukraine

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.850
include things like the deportation

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:42.180
of a 10th of the Ukrainian
population, including children,

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.570
the execution of elites, rape as politics,

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.940
the bombing of evacuation
routes and so on.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.390
And currently, the deprivation
of water and energy.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.280
And this moment we're in now,

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.410
as we move into the winter of 2022,

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.150
is, if you're a German, at least,

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.030
should be uncomfortably
close to the winter of 1941,

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.330
where the idea is you're killing people

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.490
by depriving them of access to things.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.440
The Soviet prisoners of
war died in the millions,

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.170
not because they were shot,
although many of them were shot,

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.460
especially the Jewish ones,

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.110
but they died in the preponderance,

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.500
because they were denied
access to other things,

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.480
which is of course what Russia
is now trying to carry out

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.820
on the scale of Ukraine itself.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.160
This is not a reference which
Germans themselves make.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.560
And I would say that's
because the Germans generally

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.880
don't think of the Second World War

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.360
in terms of the things
which happened in the east.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.530
So of course, the war in 2022, to be fair,

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.183
does change people's views.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.770
The general consensus, which
is not just a German idea,

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.580
it's also an American idea,
that Ukraine is a weak state,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.250
is challenged by the events
of February, March, April,

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.810
and the rest of 2022.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.310
The idea that Ukraine was gonna fall apart

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.290
within three days was not
just, and this is important,

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.570
it wasn't just a Russian
idea, that was also

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.890
basically believed in
Washington and in Berlin

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.520
and I would suggest that the
reasons why we all believe that

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.620
have to do with our own imperial past.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.330
It's not just Russian propaganda,

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.940
it's our vulnerability to
certain kinds of arguments

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.890
about how other people are corrupt

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.230
and they haven't ever really had a state

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.600
and maybe they're all radicals

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.600
and can they really have
elected a president?

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.880
Things have changed, things are changing.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.100
The German parliament
just voted a few days ago

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.310
to recognize the Holodomor as a genocide,

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.810
which is interesting and of itself,

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.960
but it's a short step from
there, I would like to think,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.870
for Germans to think about
how their own hunger plan

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:41.280
in 1941-1942 was related to the Holodomor,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.480
not just in the experience of people,

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.090
but also in its planning.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.720
The Ukrainians who survived
both certainly linked both.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.070
So it's an interesting moment to see

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.790
what's going to happen
in the winter of 2022.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.463
But when we speak about empire,

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.190
it's important to recall that empire

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.880
is about the denial of the
subjectivity of others.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.580
It's about monopolizing agency.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.620
We exist and they don't really exist.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.870
And so the story of Russian
imperialism in Ukraine

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.430
is also the story, or more importantly,

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.730
the story of the Ukrainian reaction.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.280
So Ukrainian subjectivity
and all this matters

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.365
and not just as an answer or
as the answer to a negation of,

00:38:24.365 --> 00:38:26.940
it matters on its own.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.520
And here we can also see a
way that history can help us.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.770
The historical references that Ukrainians

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.720
make on the battlefield
at this point in the class

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.370
should be clear to all of you.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.770
When they refer not just
to Cossacks but to Vikings,

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.540
that will no longer seem like a curiosity,

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.360
that will seem like something
which is not very surprising.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.920
When they claim the Second World War

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.960
as their own war against the Russians,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.200
this is also, probably,
now understandable.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.450
But the most interesting
things in the history, frankly,

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.150
may have to do with the
history of the last 30 years.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:55.860
A lot of what the Ukrainians are doing

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.870
in their communications has to do

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.360
with a particular
understanding of both Russia

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.550
and the West and the United
States, which I think

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:06.660
is specific to a certain
generation or two of Ukrainians.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.140
And the generational part
itself is very important.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.210
The elites who govern Russia

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.060
are the same elites as 20 years ago.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.640
Which, in Ukraine, is not the case.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.260
The people who are running Ukraine now

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.480
tend to be younger than me.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.290
I'm not as old as you think, I mean.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.630
They're closer to my age than your age,

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.064
let's put it that way,
but they're young still.

00:39:29.064 --> 00:39:29.897
(students laughing)

00:39:29.897 --> 00:39:31.680
They're still young, they're still young.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.470
They're still learning,
they're still growing.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.303
The people who are running Ukraine now

00:39:35.303 --> 00:39:38.250
are in their late 30's and
early 40's, just to be clear.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.100
And so there's been a
generational turnover,

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.083
which is, itself, very important.

00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:48.120
And this is also the generation
which experienced Maidan,

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.217
participated in it or saw
the consequences of it

00:39:50.217 --> 00:39:54.150
and that has a lot to do
with the sheer subjectivity

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.860
of the Ukrainian battlefield response,

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.110
which is based, not just on a state,

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.670
which turns out to be far more functional

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.860
than people thought,
but largely on the basis

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.450
of what we call civil society,

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.600
of people in horizontal
organizations filling in the gaps

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.880
and doing the things
that the state can't do

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.130
or in a way that the state can't do them.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:14.550
It's also reflected in the
pluralism of the army itself

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.350
and the army's ability
to take local decisions,

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.420
but also the various kinds of formations,

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.300
which appear in the
Ukrainian armed forces.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.580
Which include, by the way,
as probably everybody knows,

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.220
but it's roughly one in six female

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.490
and includes gay soldiers who actually

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.863
mark themselves very often as such.

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:37.440
Prominent cases, but not the
only cases of the variety,

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.230
which is possible in a pluralist army.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:45.150
But the war itself is largely
about this subjectivity.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.820
The word that Ukrainians
use, as I have found,

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.410
others might correct me, most often

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:52.350
to say what it's about is freedom.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:53.520
Freedom in the positive sense,

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.140
not just of being free of Russians,

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.163
but freedom in the sense of
what is going to come next.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.640
And the resistance, and this is the point

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.530
that I meant to get to last
time and didn't get to,

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.530
the resistance is also
carried out by the people

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.413
who would ordinarily be
creating the culture.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.200
It was two lectures ago that a historian,

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.230
a colleague of mine, a
guy called Vadym Stetsiuk,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:24.230
was killed in combat
and this death in combat

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.410
was reported in turn by a
journalist, a very courageous,

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.720
intelligent journalist
called Vakhtang Kipiani,

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.303
who's a Ukrainian of Georgian origin.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.080
That name, which I very much
hope I have on the sheet,

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:42.080
that name, Kipiani, he wrote
the book about Vasyl Stus,

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:46.230
who was the poet I cited
at length last time,

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.120
the most important of
the Ukrainian-Soviet era

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.530
dissident poets and in that
book, just follow me here,

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.320
in that book, he devotes a chapter

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.780
to a man called Viktor Medvedchuk,

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.990
because this guy,
Medvedchuk, was Stus' lawyer

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.600
in 1980 when Stus was on trial.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.490
And at that time, your
lawyer was not somebody

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.290
who represented you, he
was someone who stood up

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.180
and said, "Yeah, he's
guilty, he actually did it

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.500
and he probably should go to a camp."

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.210
And Stus, then, did go to a camp

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:16.140
and went on a hunger strike
and died five years later.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.400
This fellow, Medvedchuk,

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.570
you're gonna see why I'm mentioning this,

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.870
this fellow, Medvedchuk,
is Putin's personal friend

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.710
and he was one of the
candidates in February

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:26.850
to be the person that the Russians

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.700
were gonna drop in to run Ukraine.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.220
So there are continuities in
this, not just a personal,

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.220
literal example, that go back to the 70s.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.040
And one way to think about
the moment we're in now,

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.100
not just in Russian-Ukraine,
but for the whole world,

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.013
is whether we can ever
actually get out of the 1970s.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:49.940
Whether we get out of the
1970s into something else.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:53.880
Because the 1970s, and
this is a bit of a pivot,

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.620
but just work with me here.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.440
The 1970s are also the origin

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.360
of all of the literary theory,

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.110
which is behind Russian propaganda.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.390
And one way to understand
this conflict in Ukraine

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:09.930
is one version of the 70s against
another version of the 70s

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.400
where the other version of the 70s

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.480
is the dissidents, the human rights idea.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.780
The notion that you're
bearing responsibility.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.480
So there are many ways to criticize

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.010
the Russian media about Ukraine.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:24.480
You can talk about how it's genocidal

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.880
and say genocide and all of that's true,

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.380
whole long list of critiques.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.450
But maybe the most
interesting thing about it

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:35.220
is the total shunning of responsibility.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.850
The idea that the war itself
is just a performance.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:42.060
That we ourselves are not involved.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.340
We're not really involved personally.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.470
It's a performance, it's a spectacle

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:49.290
in which Ukrainians
should die because that...

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:52.050
it's like when our soccer team
scores a goal or something.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.720
They should die because that's
the way that the world works.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.671
That's the way we are entertained.

00:43:56.671 --> 00:43:59.520
And in this, of course, the people

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.010
who are urging all of this,

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.840
I mean, to make the obvious
point, but it's important,

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.280
they're not themselves ever
going to go to the front.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.070
They're not themselves ever
going to go to the front.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.913
It's a spectacle. It's a spectacle.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.470
Signifier is separated from signified.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.840
What is actually true?

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.330
Everything that really
matters is the medium itself.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.720
That version of the 1970s versus
the other version of 1970s,

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.770
which is the dissident version,

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.080
which says you're always bearing

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.850
some responsibility all the time,

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.070
even when the situation is unfair.

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:39.150
Even when you're in a show trial
or even when you're at war,

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.040
you take some responsibility anyway,

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.110
even when the conditions are against you.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.490
And this is, by the way,
one of the things that,

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.141
when I did talk to
Zelenskyy back in September,

00:44:47.141 --> 00:44:50.070
we spent a lot of time talking about.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:54.060
So on the other side,
of course, it's the case

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.800
and I put some of the names on the list,

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.970
because I can't mention all of them

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.980
and even that list would
be very incomplete.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.090
But on the other side,
Ukrainian cultural figure

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.130
after Ukrainian cultural
figure is killed in this war,

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:08.157
some in bombing and shelling
but many of them in combat.

00:45:08.157 --> 00:45:11.297
Many of them in combat,
from famous movie actors

00:45:11.297 --> 00:45:15.420
to multiple ballet dancers, to athletes,

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:19.293
and of course, journalists,
humanists, scientists.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:24.700
Most recently, the conductor
of the Kherson Orchestra

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.872
was executed for refusing
to conduct a concert

00:45:29.872 --> 00:45:34.140
for the Russians, which of
course, recalls Leontovych,

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.700
the Ukrainian composer
I mentioned earlier,

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.700
who was executed because he
represented Ukrainian music.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.580
I could mention a Russian cultural figure

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.880
who was killed in Ukraine.

00:45:54.447 --> 00:45:56.640
There is one person I can think of

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.690
and no doubt there are more,

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.450
but the one who I can think of,

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.250
and people will no doubt help me

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.840
in the sea of emails I'll get about this,

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.873
but the one who I can
think of is Oksana Baulina.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.130
She was a Russian reporter who was killed

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.330
by Russian shelling in
the Podil district of Kyiv

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.060
and the way she was killed is
by what's called a double tap.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.980
A double tap is when you
fire an artillery shell

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.690
and then you wait for the
rescue workers to come

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.640
and then you fire on
them, that's a double tap.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.540
It's a way that journalists
often die, that's how she died.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.620
And so she died in Podil.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.300
She was a Russian, she
did die in this war.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.430
She is a known cultural figure, she died.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:35.700
Of course, someone who opposed the war.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.200
There are no Russian cultural figures

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.040
who are in favor of the war,

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.540
who are fighting this war in Ukraine.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.823
None. There are no such people.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.903
She dies in Podil and what is Podil?

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:47.460
What is Kyiv, what is Podil?

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.310
Podil was a port area of the city.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.280
I'm asking you a way back
now to the 8th century,

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.930
9th century, beginning of the class.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.360
It was the port area of the Khazars

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.920
before the Vikings even showed up.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.710
The Vikings controlled in 900,

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.267
which is a sign that
they and not the Khazars

00:47:03.267 --> 00:47:06.090
are the ones who are in charge of Kyiv.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.730
If you walk down to Podil
from the center of Kyiv,

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.850
there's a beautiful route downwards,

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.670
there's a 14th century
Lithuanian castle on the way,

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:16.950
which marks the period
of Lithuanian control

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:18.660
of Kyiv and much of Ukraine.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.230
In the 19th century, Podil
was the site of markets,

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.683
which were dominated by Jews and Poles.

00:47:26.962 --> 00:47:31.683
Was it made Russian by shelling it?

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:37.320
Was it made Russian by the
death of a Russian journalist?

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.163
So Podil was there before any of this.

00:47:42.089 --> 00:47:43.590
Podil was there a long time ago

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.340
and it's been a theme of this class

00:47:47.565 --> 00:47:51.180
that nations are real political entities

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.450
in the 20th century, the 21st
century, the 19th century.

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:58.080
They're formed by all kinds
of contact along the way.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.970
But there are some things
which are actually,

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.283
authentically old.

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:06.000
I ended the class last time

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.620
by reading Julia Moskovski's poem

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:14.600
about the problematic
politically incorrect verses.

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.610
But, of course, the thing
about that poem is that

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.103
it's not actually the
poem that's problematic.

00:48:20.974 --> 00:48:22.800
It's we who are problematic.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.630
And the poem is perfectly elegant.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:26.673
It's the we, we who are problematic.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.248
This thought that this is leading me to

00:48:32.248 --> 00:48:35.610
is the way the poem answers itself.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.080
Because the premise of the poem

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.180
is that this is all we have to offer,

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.940
these awkward words, but
that's not true at all.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.950
The example of Ukrainians resisting

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.690
this war offers much more than that

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:49.383
and it offers much more
than that even in poetry.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:55.140
When Julia answered me
on, I can't even tell you

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.340
what platform, 'cause I don't know,

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.870
but maybe it was Instagram,

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.730
maybe it was Telegram, I don't know.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.220
But what she said was, "I
thank all of the Ukrainians

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.560
who are continuing to
create in times of war,"

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.151
which is an acknowledgement
of an important point.

00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:10.230
That it's not just that
the war is going on,

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:15.230
the culture is going on the entire time,

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.680
which leads me to where I began

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.823
and where I'm gonna end,
I promise, very soon.

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:24.810
On Sunday, I was at a
concert in Carnegie Hall,

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.180
which is not something I do all the time.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.813
You have to make me, but I have kids.

00:49:32.339 --> 00:49:34.230
You can imagine, it was three hours long.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:36.840
But I really wanted to be
there, it was very interesting.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.760
Among other things, the performers

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.920
were the Ukrainian's Children's Choir,

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.060
which is called Shchedryk.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.927
And Shchedryk is named after
a song called, "Shchedryk,"

00:49:44.927 --> 00:49:47.070
but Shchedryk is an interesting word,

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.580
because Shchedryk involves an adjective

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:55.580
which can mean both
generous and bountiful.

00:49:56.774 --> 00:49:59.790
A person is generous, but
a situation is bountiful.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:02.340
And that it's generous
that gives me a cue,

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.520
which I need to use to thank
all of the Ukrainian historians

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.560
and also the Ukrainian listeners.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.060
This class has turned
out to have been listened

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.260
to a lot of people in Ukraine.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.780
So I'm very glad that you've done so

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.540
and that you've indulged
my interpretations.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.930
But the blurriness between generosity

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:20.040
and bountiful is interesting,

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.620
because it points us back
to a pre-Christian era

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.470
where in a pagan world where the deities

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.750
are present in the world,

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.480
there isn't really a line
between generous and bountiful.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.740
The world is gonna be bountiful,

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.780
because the deities are generous.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.600
And that's why you perform certain rituals

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.370
and that's why you celebrate the season.

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.640
So that song, the (vocalizes
"Carol of the Bells")

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.440
that song, which we have as
an American Christmas Carol,

00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:48.210
is, of course, you know
where I'm going with this.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:50.910
It's a Ukrainian song and the
reason why it's so different

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:52.590
from all the American Christmas carols

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:57.590
is because it arises from
Ukrainian polyphonic singing.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:01.050
From multi-part harmony,
Ukrainian singing.

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:04.740
And the song itself, the
song that Mykola Leontovych

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.740
took almost 20 years to adapt is ancient.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.880
It's ancient.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.650
And it's not about winter actually,

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.060
it's actually about spring.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.140
Because if you're a pagan,

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.340
I mean, if you're a sensible person

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.210
actually living in the world,

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.790
when does the year actually begin?

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.010
It begins when things start
growing out of the ground.

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.620
And it begins when the
swallows come and sing.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.900
It begins when the first lambs are born,

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.550
which is February or March,

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.500
which is what the song is actually about.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.850
It's about those things.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:32.070
So this song, which was adapted and played

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:33.450
in Carnegie Hall a century ago

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:36.540
and then played again
on Sunday, is ancient.

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:40.323
It's pre-Christian, it
goes back before 988.

00:51:41.494 --> 00:51:44.853
It's actually about spring.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.030
It's about fertility,
it's about prosperity,

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.290
it's about love, it's about how things

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:51.120
are going to get better.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.040
That part in the American version

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.967
where they say at the end,

00:51:54.967 --> 00:51:57.060
"Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas,"

00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.610
in that part of the song,
in the Ukrainian version,

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.333
it's actually about how
your wife is beautiful.

00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:02.166
(Timothy and students chuckling)

00:52:02.166 --> 00:52:03.840
Things are going really well for you.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.610
You're gonna make lots of money this year.

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.920
The farm's going really
well and by the way,

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.990
your wife is beautiful.
(students chuckling)

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:11.690
And what it literally says is that

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:17.070
she's dark-browed, which is beautiful.

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:19.440
That's a beautiful woman in Ukraine.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:22.020
It's a woman who has dark eyebrows.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.860
It's a song about spring.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.390
It's a song which we
think of as about winter,

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:31.260
which is about spring, which I close on,

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.440
because I just wanna suggest
that sometimes that things

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.040
that seem like an end can
actually be a beginning.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.559
Thanks.

00:52:39.559 --> 00:52:42.726
(students applauding)

00:52:59.192 --> 00:53:01.775
(gentle music)

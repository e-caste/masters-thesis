00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.559
Professor David Blight:
On a morning in the second

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:08.390
week of March,
1857,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.826
Americans grew up living--they
didn't all quite understand it

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:18.992
yet--but they grew up living in
the land of the Dred Scott

00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:21.415
decision.
And if you were

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:25.320
African-American,
that really meant something.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.123
Now 1857 is,
of course, the final year of

00:00:33.123 --> 00:00:36.622
the playing out of Bleeding
Kansas and we'll return to that

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:37.890
in just a second.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.525
And we're going to discuss
mostly today the story of one

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:53.196
abolitionist;
you could say the most famous

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:56.909
abolitionist,
certainly the most notorious

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.259
American abolitionist,
John Brown.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:05.469
John Brown never made it easy
for people to love him.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:11.639
In some ways he wasn't very
lovable, until he died on the

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:17.920
gallows, and the gallows made
him heroic--at least to some

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.090
people--and it made him all but
the devil to others.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.396
There are catalytic events in
history, that is,

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:34.472
events around which ideas,
forces, movements,

00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:38.259
problems coalesce.
Unfortunately,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.919
they often have a lot to do
with violence,

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:46.739
and we'll come back to this
point at the end today.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.267
But John Brown was far,
far, far, far more important

00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:52.550
dead than he'd ever been alive.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.756
Poets, songwriters,
lyricists, biographers,

00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:04.420
those who would come to love
him,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.588
those who would come to hate
him, and those who cannot quite

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:10.671
figure out what to do with him,
would never stop writing about

00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:11.930
him.
And we still haven't.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.949
And we're in the midst right
now of a John Brown biography

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.297
revival.
That's in part because next

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:25.780
year is the 150^(th) anniversary
of the Harpers Ferry raid.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.020
Almost all major
African-American poets in the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.919
twentieth century attempted
their John Brown poem.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:39.983
So did Stephen Vincent
Benét in a famous and

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:43.832
classic lyric,
epic poem called John

00:02:43.832 --> 00:02:48.389
Brown's Body,
published in the 1920s.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.398
And embedded in that poem is
this verse where Benét,

00:02:53.398 --> 00:02:57.370
I think, captured the dilemma
of John Brown.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.856
John Brown--it's not easy to
decide--was he a heroic

00:03:02.856 --> 00:03:07.159
revolutionary or a midnight
terrorist?

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:13.213
This is Benét's verse,
embedded in a 250-page epic

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:16.949
poem.
"The law is our yardstick and

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.675
it measures well,
oh well enough when there are

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:26.875
yards to measure.
Measure a wave with it,

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:31.935
measure fire,
cut sorrow up in inches,

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:37.002
weigh content.
You can weigh John Brown's body

00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:42.840
well enough, but how and in what
balance do you weigh John Brown?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.092
He had no gift for life,
no gift to bring life,

00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:54.830
but his body and a cutting
edge, and he knew how to die."

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.910
More on old John Brown coming
up.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:11.145
The year before John Brown's
raid the most important,

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:14.385
the most exhilarating,
and by far the most

00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:18.210
substantively interesting
political debates in American

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.367
history would occur in Illinois,
when Abraham Lincoln runs for

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:24.102
the U.S.
Senate against Stephen

00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:26.994
Douglas--Stephen Douglas,
the same Stephen Douglas,

00:04:26.994 --> 00:04:29.250
author of the Kansas-Nebraska
Act;

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.029
parliamentarian genius of the
Compromise of 1850;

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.416
the man most associated with
the Democratic Party's theory of

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:41.746
popular sovereignty for Kansas
and Nebraska and the whole of

00:04:41.746 --> 00:04:43.621
the West.
And this guy,

00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:46.868
Abe Lincoln,
with one term in the U.S.

00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:51.433
House of Representatives and
then a failed attempt at

00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:56.436
re-election, a guy with very
little experience when he ran

00:04:56.436 --> 00:05:01.055
for President.
In the opening of his campaign

00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:06.142
he decided to open it in the
Legislative Hall of the old

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:10.539
State House in Illinois.
It was on the outside steps of

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.337
that State House where Barack
Obama began his campaign almost

00:05:14.337 --> 00:05:18.424
exactly a year ago.
But inside, Lincoln gave his

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:22.851
now famous House Divided speech.
Now in your reader,

00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:25.685
your Lincoln Reader,
edited by Mike Johnson,

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:29.441
you have the House Divided
speech, but read past the first

00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:32.075
page.
Don't just read that first

00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:36.406
lyrical, biblical paragraph,
read what Lincoln goes on the

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:40.017
argue.
The speech is about the Dred

00:05:40.017 --> 00:05:43.485
Scott decision.
The speech is his opposition to

00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:46.959
the Dred--to the Supreme Court
case that had just been passed

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.991
the year before.
The speech is his opposition to

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:55.079
the Kansas-Nebraska Act.
His speech is a warning.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:58.432
It's the warning of a moderate
Republican, but nevertheless a

00:05:58.432 --> 00:06:02.519
moderate, anti-slavery,
free soil Republican who throws

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:06.509
down the gauntlet,
in the wake of Dred Scott.

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.576
This is a sentence on the fifth
page of the House Divided

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:14.279
Speech, page 68 in your reader
if you look it up.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.610
"We shall lie down soon," said
Abraham Lincoln,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.810
"pleasantly dreaming that the
people of Missouri are on the

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.490
verge of making their State
free,

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.209
and we shall awake the next
morning to the reality instead

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:36.030
that the Supreme Court has made
Illinois a Slave State."

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.256
Get his drift.
The Dred Scott decision,

00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:44.501
in his view,
and the view now of most in

00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:47.579
this new, extraordinary
coalition,

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:50.798
the Republican Party,
believes the Dred Scott

00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:53.870
decision now threatens
everybody--north,

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.430
south, and west--with the
presence of slavery,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.990
and slave labor,
and all that goes with it.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.392
It's the opening of that speech
though, of course,

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:07.060
that the world always
remembers,

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.146
and we love to return to this
in our political culture,

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:13.045
in our political history,
whenever we feel great

00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:17.031
polarization and great division.
Are we a house divided again,

00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:18.310
against ourselves?

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.715
"If we could first know where
we are and whither we are

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:26.670
tendingâ€¦"--this is so
Lincoln;

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.915
he kind of meanders in a bit of
a homespun way into a very

00:07:32.915 --> 00:07:39.490
serious argument--"â€¦we
could then better judge what to

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.206
do and how to do it.
We are now far into the fifth

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:47.013
year since a policy was
initiated"--Kans

00:07:47.013 --> 00:07:51.331
as-Nebraska--"with the avowed
object and confident promise of

00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:54.569
putting an end to the slavery
agitation.

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:58.756
Under the operation of that
policy that agitation has not

00:07:58.756 --> 00:08:02.269
only not ceased but has
constantly augmented.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:08.012
In my opinion it will not cease
until a crisis shall have been

00:08:08.012 --> 00:08:13.521
reached and passed.
A house divided against itself

00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:17.082
cannot stand.
I believe this government

00:08:17.082 --> 00:08:21.060
cannot endure permanently
half-slave and half-free.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.394
I do not expect the Union to be
dissolved, I do not expect the

00:08:25.394 --> 00:08:28.450
House to fall,
but I do expect it will cease

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:33.509
to be divided.
It will become all one thing or

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:40.375
all the other."
Southerners never forgot that

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:43.651
sentence.
"Either the opponents of

00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:47.738
slavery will arrest the further
spread of it and place it where

00:08:47.738 --> 00:08:51.363
the public mind shall rest in
the belief that it is in a

00:08:51.363 --> 00:08:54.263
course of ultimate
extinction"--and those two

00:08:54.263 --> 00:08:57.495
words,
more than anything else Lincoln

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:01.863
had uttered before the Civil
War, Southern Democrats would

00:09:01.863 --> 00:09:06.384
never forget--"or its advocates
will push it forward till it

00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:10.139
shall become alike lawful in all
the states,

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:14.759
old as well as new,
north as well as south.

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:19.580
Have we no tendency to the
latter condition?

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.613
Let anyone who doubts carefully
contemplate that now almost

00:09:23.613 --> 00:09:27.181
complete legal combination,
piece of machinery so to

00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:30.929
speak"--and here he's arguing
the slave-power conspiracy,

00:09:30.929 --> 00:09:35.484
without naming it--"compounded
of the Nebraska doctrine and the

00:09:35.484 --> 00:09:39.234
Dred Scott decision,
let him consider not only what

00:09:39.234 --> 00:09:43.787
work the machinery is adapted to
do and how"--the machinery--"and

00:09:43.787 --> 00:09:46.947
how well adapted.
But also let him study the

00:09:46.947 --> 00:09:50.289
history of its construction and
trace, if he can,

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:55.131
or rather fail if he can,
to trace the evidences of

00:09:55.131 --> 00:10:00.360
design and concert of action
among its chief bosses,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.420
from the beginning."

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.716
It's all there;
the Republican Party coalition

00:10:09.716 --> 00:10:14.566
of ideas and fears is all there.
Well, what was everybody so

00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:16.350
angry about over the Dred Scott
decision?

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.600
It's just a Supreme Court
decision.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:31.909
Well, I left you the other day
hanging in abeyance.

00:10:31.909 --> 00:10:34.419
Dred Scott was,
as I said, an old,

00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:38.981
old man by the time this thing
finally got before the- got on

00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:43.566
the docket in 1854,
finally was argued in late 1856

00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:47.367
and early 1957.
And when the court brought down

00:10:47.367 --> 00:10:49.780
its decision,
literally two days,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.079
forty-eight hours after the
inauguration of James Buchanan

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:58.080
as President in 1857,
his case was now,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.679
his name would now become
almost a household word across

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:08.703
the country.
Now a measure of how important

00:11:08.703 --> 00:11:12.408
this case was as it was
developing largely in legal

00:11:12.408 --> 00:11:16.039
secrecy was the kind of lawyers
who argued it.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:19.210
Montgomery Blair and George
Ticknor Curtis for Scott.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.467
Montgomery Blair was from the
famous Blair family from

00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:28.127
Missouri, moderate anti-slavery
leaning Republicans by this

00:11:28.127 --> 00:11:31.179
point in time,
Member of Congress;

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:35.270
George Ticknor Curtis,
a former attorney-general,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.679
a very important,
famous trial lawyer.

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:42.407
And for the Government,
another former U.S.

00:11:42.407 --> 00:11:45.336
Attorney General,
Reverdy Johnson,

00:11:45.336 --> 00:11:48.087
and a U.S.
Senator, Henry Geyer,

00:11:48.087 --> 00:11:51.427
were the layers.
Reverdy Johnson made the

00:11:51.427 --> 00:11:54.607
startling statements in the
arguments before the Supreme

00:11:54.607 --> 00:11:57.960
Court and called for a--he made
startling statements and he

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.139
called for a broader
pronouncement from the court.

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:03.781
He urged Justice Taney,
the Chief Justice,

00:12:03.781 --> 00:12:07.259
and the court to render a big
decision here and try,

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:10.087
once and for all,
to put this--as Lincoln called

00:12:10.087 --> 00:12:12.914
it--slavery agitation,
this whole slavery in the

00:12:12.914 --> 00:12:15.320
Western Territories problem to
rest.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.400
The Supreme Court after all is
supreme.

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:26.730
Reverdy Johnson said--I quote
him--"This is a case that shall

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.410
determine whether slavery shall
live forever."

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:35.519
Forever;
whether preservation of slavery

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:38.410
was the only way to preserve the
Union.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.938
The decision came on the 6^(th)
of March 1857,

00:12:46.938 --> 00:12:51.001
and here was the decision.
Taney and the majority in the

00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:53.580
court did not have to go as far
as they did.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.490
This is now legendary and
famous, Taney developing his

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.305
majority.
And it was ultimately a six to

00:13:03.305 --> 00:13:07.341
three decision.
And lest you think the Supreme

00:13:07.341 --> 00:13:10.827
Court doesn't really matter in
our political history,

00:13:10.827 --> 00:13:13.710
please remember the Dred Scott
decision.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.913
Number one part of the--there
were three parts of the

00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:17.590
decision.
The first was jurisdiction.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.689
Did Dred Scott as a black
person have the right to

00:13:24.689 --> 00:13:29.170
sue--this is the first question
they were asked to settle--the

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.769
right to sue for anything in a
Federal Court?

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:38.953
Could a non-citizen,
because he was a Negro--which

00:13:38.953 --> 00:13:45.389
was the language used then--sue
in Federal Court?

00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:49.721
Two, did Scott's residence on
free soil--remember his four

00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:52.761
years with Dr.
Emerson, his former owner,

00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:55.573
from 1834 to 1838,
living in Minnesota

00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:59.754
Territory--did his residence on
free soil entitle him to

00:13:59.754 --> 00:14:03.515
freedom?
Or, if a slave was taken by his

00:14:03.515 --> 00:14:08.277
owner to Free states or Free
territories, was it the law of

00:14:08.277 --> 00:14:13.450
the State the master came from
that always had jurisdiction?

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.635
In other words,
was it the law of Missouri that

00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:19.890
took precedent here,
or the law of Minnesota?

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.414
And the third question before
the court--they didn't have to

00:14:27.414 --> 00:14:30.919
take this one up but they sure
did--was Congress's right to

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:33.879
determine slavery in the Western
Territories.

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:37.581
The pressures on the court were
tremendous, as I said,

00:14:37.581 --> 00:14:41.491
to move for a broad decision,
to try to put this thing to

00:14:41.491 --> 00:14:43.991
rest.
Well the decision,

00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:48.852
of course, six to three.
And at that point there were

00:14:48.852 --> 00:14:53.295
five southern born justices,
five either slaveholders or

00:14:53.295 --> 00:14:56.850
former slaveholders on the
Supreme Court.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:02.407
The sixth judge who voted with
them was Greer of Pennsylvania,

00:15:02.407 --> 00:15:08.056
forming a majority against the
three northern born justices who

00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:11.835
voted against it.
The decision was,

00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:17.429
one, Scott had no right to sue
in a Federal Court.

00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:22.444
Two, his residence on free soil
did not give him his freedom,

00:15:22.444 --> 00:15:25.370
the law of Missouri was in
place.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.257
And third, and by far most
important, the court

00:15:28.257 --> 00:15:31.898
ruled--trying to put to rest now
nearly forty years of this

00:15:31.898 --> 00:15:34.723
problem that had been
compromised this way and

00:15:34.723 --> 00:15:38.427
compromised that way and argued
with that principle and that

00:15:38.427 --> 00:15:43.133
principle and that principle,
as we've seen--it ruled that

00:15:43.133 --> 00:15:47.984
Congress had no authority to
exclude slavery from any U.S.

00:15:47.984 --> 00:15:52.920
territory because it would be,
just as Southerners had been

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.969
arguing now for two generations,
a violation of the Fifth

00:15:57.969 --> 00:16:02.480
Amendment to the Constitution,
a person's right to life,

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:08.581
liberty, and property.
If someone ever wants to doubt

00:16:08.581 --> 00:16:13.371
that American history is about
its ironies, just note that

00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:14.380
language.

00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:19.553
Therefore, the Missouri
Compromise Line,

00:16:19.553 --> 00:16:21.850
that so-called sacred pledge
that had now been violated,

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.790
said Northerners,
in the Kansas-Nebraska Act,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.909
had never been constitutional
to begin with;

00:16:29.909 --> 00:16:36.563
that any attempt to prevent
slavery's expansion anywhere

00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:42.079
would be unconstitutional.
Now, Taney not only went that

00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:45.970
far, but in his opinion,
in his own written opinion,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:51.326
he famously went a step further
and he argued--or he said,

00:16:51.326 --> 00:16:55.577
quote, that blacks,
or negroes is the word he used,

00:16:55.577 --> 00:17:00.132
had--I'm quoting--"had for more
than a century been regarded as

00:17:00.132 --> 00:17:05.823
beings of an inferior order,
so far inferior that they had

00:17:05.823 --> 00:17:12.180
no rights, which the white man
was bound to respect."

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:18.954
Some of the most infamous words
ever in an American Supreme

00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:23.001
Court decision.
Now, the decision,

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.980
six to three,
was issued.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.755
For this new Republican Party
coalition in the North,

00:17:29.755 --> 00:17:33.967
in some ways this was horrible
news and in some ways it was

00:17:33.967 --> 00:17:37.974
good political news,
because nothing crystallized

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:42.180
this Republican coalition now
quite like this case.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.209
They will crystallize in
resistance to it,

00:17:45.209 --> 00:17:49.495
as I just tried to demonstrate,
from quoting from Lincoln's

00:17:49.495 --> 00:17:53.384
famous House Divided speech.
But most importantly here,

00:17:53.384 --> 00:17:56.668
I'd argue--the hook to hang
your hat on here--is that the

00:17:56.668 --> 00:17:59.599
Dred Scott decision,
it's not once and for all.

00:17:59.599 --> 00:18:03.119
The war is not necessarily now
inevitable.

00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:06.919
Contingencies are always there,
they're always laying there to

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.792
happen.
But what the Dred Scott

00:18:09.792 --> 00:18:15.522
decision did almost once and for
all, is that it destroyed

00:18:15.522 --> 00:18:19.397
compromise.
It destroyed almost any

00:18:19.397 --> 00:18:24.009
conception now of consensus or
compromise.

00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:29.410
Or put another way,
it ruined moderation.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.424
Moderate politicians,
former Democrats like David

00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:35.188
Wilmot from Pennsylvania,
racist to the core,

00:18:35.188 --> 00:18:38.579
but free soiler who's joined
the Republican Party.

00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:43.815
Abraham Lincoln of Illinois,
got his own racial problems,

00:18:43.815 --> 00:18:49.049
but a much more advanced sort
of anti-slavery thinker,

00:18:49.049 --> 00:18:52.100
but still a moderate--he didn't
like abolitionists,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.760
he'd never been a member of an
Abolitionist Society and never

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.237
would be--believed there were
Constitutional restraints on

00:18:59.237 --> 00:19:02.410
what Congress could actually do
about slavery.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:08.540
But it will bring together now
some strange bedfellows in this

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:14.670
Republican coalition who cannot
find anymore any middle ground

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.872
with their foes.
And that's when you see

00:19:18.872 --> 00:19:24.021
danger--you more than see
danger--in American political

00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:29.913
history.
It's when the side that loses a

00:19:29.913 --> 00:19:37.658
debate cannot accept the result.
Now, there are many ways to try

00:19:37.658 --> 00:19:42.919
to demonstrate the importance of
that Dred Scott case as it sunk

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:45.512
in.
Now it's sinking in now in the

00:19:45.512 --> 00:19:48.930
summer of 1857 as a depression
hits the country.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.732
Wages in America,
North, in northern cities like

00:19:52.732 --> 00:19:55.967
New York, Boston,
Philadelphia and so on,

00:19:55.967 --> 00:19:59.769
drop forty and fifty percent in
six months.

00:19:59.769 --> 00:20:04.435
The estimate is that 100,000
workers in New York City were

00:20:04.435 --> 00:20:07.710
thrown out of work by the end of
1857;

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:13.112
about 50,000 in Philadelphia.
The prices of wheat go

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:16.220
plummeting, practically
overnight.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.719
The United States had one of
its first significant stock

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:24.759
market crashes.
There's a lot to be feared here.

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:26.978
And on both sides of this,
North and South,

00:20:26.978 --> 00:20:28.880
they're going to blame each
other.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.404
Southerners are going to blame
Northerners for

00:20:31.404 --> 00:20:34.040
over-speculation,
for the over-issuing of credit

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.260
by banks.
And, of course,

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.844
they're right about that.
There were no controls on banks

00:20:37.844 --> 00:20:40.134
in these years.
There was no Federal Deposit

00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:44.019
Insurance Corporation;
you only got that from the New

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:48.824
Deal in the twentieth century.
And Northerners are going to

00:20:48.824 --> 00:20:52.985
blame Southerners because of
their belief in King Cotton and

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:56.230
this kind of dependence on a
single export.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.720
They're going to throw blame
all over the place.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.319
If you were African-American
you now lived in the land of the

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:05.900
Dred Scott decision,
which had said what?

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.759
It said you will never be a
citizen of the United States.

00:21:10.759 --> 00:21:13.780
You have no rights which the
white man has to respect,

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.060
which means the white man's
Constitution,

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.339
which means the white man's
society.

00:21:18.339 --> 00:21:23.050
It means you live in the land
of the Dred Scott decision that

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.740
said you have no future in the
United States.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.483
In the wake of the Dred Scott
case, about a month after it,

00:21:30.483 --> 00:21:33.581
Frederick Douglass gave a
speech, which was a bit

00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:37.157
uncustomary for him.
In the 1850s Frederick Douglass

00:21:37.157 --> 00:21:40.492
was learning his politics,
he was really was--he was

00:21:40.492 --> 00:21:43.893
getting his feet as a political
thinker and even as a

00:21:43.893 --> 00:21:46.399
politician.
He was trying to sidle up to

00:21:46.399 --> 00:21:49.005
this Republican Party,
even though it was kind of a

00:21:49.005 --> 00:21:55.259
half-baked loaf of bread to him;
it wasn't real abolitionism.

00:21:55.259 --> 00:21:57.500
This case drove him further
into their laps.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.279
But he gave a speech,
largely to a black audience,

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:05.886
in the wake of Dred Scott.
And so typical of Douglass's

00:22:05.886 --> 00:22:10.430
brilliance as an orator,
he started to discuss how he

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:15.136
saw fear on the horizon,
and trouble and dread on the

00:22:15.136 --> 00:22:19.744
horizon, and he said he saw what
he called "the manifold

00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:23.850
discouragements of my people
everywhere I go."

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.340
I quote him.
"They fling their broad and

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.116
gloomy shadows across the
pathway of every thoughtful

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:35.877
colored man in this country."
And then he ended with this

00:22:35.877 --> 00:22:37.762
lament.
"I see them"--these are

00:22:37.762 --> 00:22:40.794
discouragements--"I see them
clearly and feel them sadly with

00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:43.831
an earnest, aching heart.
I have long looked for the

00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:47.509
realization of the hope of my
people, standing as it were,

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:50.719
barefoot, and treading upon the
sharp and flinty rocks of the

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:54.089
present and looking out upon the
boundless sea of the future.

00:22:54.089 --> 00:22:59.057
I have sought in my humble way
to penetrate the intervening

00:22:59.057 --> 00:23:03.940
mists and clouds and per chance
to see in the distance,

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.160
a time at which the cruel
bondage of my people should

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.381
somehow end, and the long
entombed millions rise from

00:23:12.381 --> 00:23:15.789
their foul grave of slavery and
death.

00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:21.346
But of that time I can now know
nothing, and you can know

00:23:21.346 --> 00:23:25.910
nothing, and all is uncertain at
this point.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:32.539
I walk by faith and not by
sight."

00:23:32.539 --> 00:23:37.920
That's Douglass's beautiful and
terrible way of expressing that

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.131
he's now told,
as an African-American,

00:23:41.131 --> 00:23:44.950
you have no future in the
United States.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.910
All right, so who was John
Brown?

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:04.218
That picture--I'm going to show
you just a couple of images

00:24:04.218 --> 00:24:06.742
here.
John Brown, of course,

00:24:06.742 --> 00:24:11.460
has been a fascination for
artists, to say the least.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.109
I don't want to take too much
time with this.

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:17.594
But this is a black and white
version now--I don't know if you

00:24:17.594 --> 00:24:21.492
can see the rope up here.
This is one of the 22 panels in

00:24:21.492 --> 00:24:24.640
Jacob Lawrence's magnificent
series on John Brown.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.717
Jacob Lawrence,
a great African-American

00:24:26.717 --> 00:24:30.910
painter.
He painted this in the 1930s.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:38.621
And at least 20 of the 22
images in Lawrence's incredible

00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:45.507
series on John Brown,
you will find some image of a

00:24:45.507 --> 00:24:50.740
crucifix, of execution,
a hanging.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.586
When I was teaching at Amherst
College, I don't know,

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:57.103
eight or nine years ago,
we had Jacob Lawrence for an

00:24:57.103 --> 00:25:00.318
Honorary Degree,
and I got to spend like two

00:25:00.318 --> 00:25:02.991
days with him.
It was one of the greatest

00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:06.356
thrills of my life.
And the museum at Amherst

00:25:06.356 --> 00:25:11.478
managed to get the series on
John Brown, they had it in a

00:25:11.478 --> 00:25:14.956
room.
And I was asked to do a gallery

00:25:14.956 --> 00:25:18.259
talk on it.
And so I went into the room the

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:21.799
day before I was to give this
talk, all by myself,

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:25.122
nobody in there,
and I just communed with these

00:25:25.122 --> 00:25:27.876
terrible images.
Sometimes the images,

00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:30.645
just sort of crisscrossed
bayonets and sometimes

00:25:30.645 --> 00:25:33.626
crisscrossed rifles,
and sometimes it's literally

00:25:33.626 --> 00:25:37.170
crosses on the wall in rooms,
and sometimes it's this image,

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.339
of Brown hanging.
And I was overwhelmed by it.

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:43.919
And the next day I gave this
talk and I talked about these

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:46.617
images of crucifixes.
What they hadn't told me is

00:25:46.617 --> 00:25:50.424
that they were also inviting a
busload of Fifth Graders to come

00:25:50.424 --> 00:25:53.106
to the lecture,
and they also hadn't told me

00:25:53.106 --> 00:25:55.809
that that morning in the New
York Times,

00:25:55.809 --> 00:25:58.951
in the headline--today this
wouldn't even get

00:25:58.951 --> 00:26:02.950
headlines--there'd been a bus
bombing in Jerusalem and 38

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:07.019
people were slaughtered on a bus
by a terrorist bomb.

00:26:07.019 --> 00:26:09.132
And I was going to talk about
John Brown, whether he was a

00:26:09.132 --> 00:26:10.799
terrorist, and in walked the
Fifth Graders.

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:13.490
Toughest--one of the toughest
audiences I ever had.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.436
How do you smooth over John
Brown and all those crucifixes

00:26:18.436 --> 00:26:21.560
with Fifth Graders on a
fieldtrip?

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.959
Don't even try is the answer.
[Laughter]

00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:29.630
Another favorite image of mine
of John Brown is David Levine's.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.765
David Levine is the artist for
the New York Review of

00:26:32.765 --> 00:26:36.420
Books.
This actually comes from 1969.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.940
A series of books had come out
on John Brown.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.676
This is an image that kind of
fits John Brown to many

00:26:44.676 --> 00:26:49.640
people--the gun slinging,
kind of wild man.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.731
He's got a red face,
probably, big nose,

00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:58.767
gun belt, bullets all around
him, kind of saying,

00:26:58.767 --> 00:27:03.171
"Don't mess with me."
But then, of course,

00:27:03.171 --> 00:27:07.803
there's Thomas Hovenden's
incredible painting of John

00:27:07.803 --> 00:27:12.613
Brown, which hangs in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in

00:27:12.613 --> 00:27:17.251
New York.
I don't have the full version

00:27:17.251 --> 00:27:19.375
of it.
This is the painting that

00:27:19.375 --> 00:27:22.246
depicts the scene of John Brown
leaving his jail cell in

00:27:22.246 --> 00:27:25.134
Charlestown,
Virginia, on the day of his

00:27:25.134 --> 00:27:29.655
execution, according to the
artist with the hangman's noose

00:27:29.655 --> 00:27:34.684
already around his neck,
before he even rode to the

00:27:34.684 --> 00:27:38.651
gallows--details.
And a black woman comes up with

00:27:38.651 --> 00:27:42.346
her baby and raises her baby to
John Brown and he kisses the

00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:44.865
child.
It's the "legend of the kiss,"

00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:47.799
as John Greenleaf Whittier put
it in a poem.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:54.119
It didn't happen,
but in art anything can happen.

00:27:54.119 --> 00:27:58.549
This is the gentle savior John
Brown, this is the liberator

00:27:58.549 --> 00:28:01.910
John Brown, this is the martyr
John Brown.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.369
There are many,
many, many John Browns.

00:28:05.369 --> 00:28:09.226
And you're going to start
hearing about and seeing a lot

00:28:09.226 --> 00:28:10.980
more of them next year.

00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:36.312
Well, John Brown was born in
Connecticut, Torrington to be

00:28:36.312 --> 00:28:43.150
exact, and just a ways up the
road.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:48.157
He was born in 1800.
He grew up mostly out in the

00:28:48.157 --> 00:28:51.324
Western Reserve,
as it was called,

00:28:51.324 --> 00:28:53.709
of Ohio.
He witnessed at the age of

00:28:53.709 --> 00:28:55.500
twelve the beating of a slave
boy.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.941
There were remnants of slaves
still traversing the north in

00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:03.603
the eighteen-teens.
He tried Divinity School for a

00:29:03.603 --> 00:29:07.095
little while at the age of
sixteen, but said he quit

00:29:07.095 --> 00:29:10.929
because of insufficient funds
and because all the reading

00:29:10.929 --> 00:29:14.829
caused him sore eyes.
He experienced a confession of

00:29:14.829 --> 00:29:18.220
faith in his father's church,
a congregational,

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.511
old-fashioned Calvinist
congregational church,

00:29:21.511 --> 00:29:27.480
when he was about sixteen.
He married first in 1820.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:34.206
His first wife would die on him.
He had no less than twenty

00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:38.269
children by two wives over some
thirty years.

00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:43.940
Nine of those children would
die in infancy.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:48.638
From 1820 to 1855 he engaged in
approximately twenty different

00:29:48.638 --> 00:29:53.029
business ventures of one kind
and another in six different

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:57.563
northern states,
virtually all of which ended in

00:29:57.563 --> 00:30:01.039
failure and poverty for his
family;

00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:05.794
several of which ended in law
suits and bankruptcies and one

00:30:05.794 --> 00:30:10.841
litigation after another;
one of which led to debtor's

00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:15.765
prison for awhile.
He and his family had lived a

00:30:15.765 --> 00:30:19.971
poverty stricken,
rolling stone existence,

00:30:19.971 --> 00:30:25.042
across the northern states.
Probably what sustained

00:30:25.042 --> 00:30:29.981
him--and we know a good deal
about this--was his religion,

00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:33.359
his faith, his theology if you
want.

00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:36.799
He was a kind of orthodox
nineteenth century Calvinist.

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:39.653
He believed in such things as
innate depravity,

00:30:39.653 --> 00:30:42.009
providential design,
predestination,

00:30:42.009 --> 00:30:44.911
on some level,
and the total human dependence

00:30:44.911 --> 00:30:47.220
on a sovereign and arbitrary
God,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.671
and an arbitrary God that
sometimes chose certain

00:30:50.671 --> 00:30:54.410
individual human beings in
history to act for Him.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.579
He believed in an Old Testament
kind of justice,

00:30:56.579 --> 00:30:58.609
an eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth.

00:30:58.609 --> 00:31:05.711
He punished his children and
his employees with Mosaic

00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:09.442
vengeance.
He had a puritanical obsession

00:31:09.442 --> 00:31:12.059
with the wickedness of other
people.

00:31:12.059 --> 00:31:15.859
He could be domineering,
vane, obstinate,

00:31:15.859 --> 00:31:20.610
as one friend once put it,
impervious to a joke.

00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:27.619
Probably not a lot of fun to
just have lunch with.

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:30.364
He gave orders,
remembered Brown's younger

00:31:30.364 --> 00:31:33.444
brother, quote,
"like a king against whom there

00:31:33.444 --> 00:31:36.530
is no rising up."
He was a thorough going

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.135
non-conformist.
He probably never joined any

00:31:40.135 --> 00:31:42.918
formal anti-slavery
organization,

00:31:42.918 --> 00:31:46.920
although he went to lots of
their meetings.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.619
He never joined a political
party.

00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:54.170
We're not even sure if he ever
voted.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.987
He was a practitioner of what
would become known in these

00:31:57.987 --> 00:32:01.599
years--certainly by the
1850s--of a kind of higher law

00:32:01.599 --> 00:32:06.801
doctrine about slavery,
an allegiance to God's will and

00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:11.093
God's law above man's law.
To John Brown,

00:32:11.093 --> 00:32:17.034
put simply, slavery represented
an unjustifiable state of war,

00:32:17.034 --> 00:32:21.710
by one portion of the people
against another;

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:28.125
and in a state of war you do
what's necessary to defend

00:32:28.125 --> 00:32:32.258
yourselves.
He believed slavery was an evil

00:32:32.258 --> 00:32:36.601
so entrenched--and he was dead
serious about this--so

00:32:36.601 --> 00:32:41.612
entrenched in America that it
required revolutionary ideology

00:32:41.612 --> 00:32:45.369
and revolutionary means to
eradicate it.

00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:51.367
It had led him--as it has often
in history led most proponents

00:32:51.367 --> 00:32:55.792
of revolutionary violence--that
the means can,

00:32:55.792 --> 00:33:01.961
therefore, justify the end.
As God had willed so often in

00:33:01.961 --> 00:33:06.482
his Old Testament that the
wicked must die,

00:33:06.482 --> 00:33:12.617
so too had he willed that
slaveholders and their defenders

00:33:12.617 --> 00:33:20.059
at least deserved the same fate.
John Brown came to believe that

00:33:20.059 --> 00:33:27.090
violence in a righteous cause
was like a rite of purification.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:35.576
Now, what did he do?
In brief, John Brown's interest

00:33:35.576 --> 00:33:42.920
in Kansas was intense,
after the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.965
He was living then,
by then, in upstate New York,

00:33:47.965 --> 00:33:53.010
up near what is today Lake
Placid, in North Elba,

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:57.109
which is indeed where he is
buried.

00:33:57.109 --> 00:34:02.459
Five of Brown's sons went west
to Kansas, in late 1854 and

00:34:02.459 --> 00:34:05.126
early 1855.
There was an extraordinary

00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:08.019
exchange of letters between a
couple of those sons,

00:34:08.019 --> 00:34:10.757
especially Owen Brown and his
father back in New York,

00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:12.719
letters that are saying things
like,

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:15.340
"Father, you must come out here
with us.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.676
There are slaveholders living
over on such and such creek,

00:34:18.676 --> 00:34:22.731
within two miles of us Father.
Violence is beginning to break

00:34:22.731 --> 00:34:28.130
out, Father."
And so the father came.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:34.115
And John Brown developed,
in Kansas, by late 1855 and

00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:38.949
into 1856, his own little
guerilla band.

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:43.230
They had gone to Kansas to
fight in Kansas's Border War.

00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:50.905
Now, I mentioned the other day
that it was in the spring of

00:34:50.905 --> 00:34:54.839
1856, Brown and his men are
traveling along a roadway and

00:34:54.839 --> 00:34:59.125
they get word of the beating of
Charles Sumner on the floor of

00:34:59.125 --> 00:35:02.791
the Senate.
I think it was first told to

00:35:02.791 --> 00:35:06.941
them that Sumner was all but
dead, this, to him,

00:35:06.941 --> 00:35:11.552
great abolitionist senator.
And Brown, it appears,

00:35:11.552 --> 00:35:16.636
went into a frenzy and vowed
revenge, and a couple of days

00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:21.113
later he and four of his sons,
or three of his sons,

00:35:21.113 --> 00:35:25.348
went and did visitations at
three houses along Pottawatomie

00:35:25.348 --> 00:35:29.420
Creek in eastern Kansas,
known to be an area settled by

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.550
slaveholders or pro-slavery
people, and they dragged several

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.247
men from their houses,
in front of their wives,

00:35:37.247 --> 00:35:42.196
and hacked them to death--five
men to be exact--hacked them to

00:35:42.196 --> 00:35:45.280
death with these huge broad
swords,

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.440
and deposited their bodies on
the front steps of their cabins.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.639
This was the Pottawatomie Creek
Massacre.

00:35:54.639 --> 00:35:59.937
It touched off even greater
violence in Bleeding Kansas,

00:35:59.937 --> 00:36:04.559
throughout that summer,
into the fall of 1856.

00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:07.358
To John Brown,
he had kind of tried to even

00:36:07.358 --> 00:36:11.224
the score because just a few--a
couple of weeks before that

00:36:11.224 --> 00:36:15.808
pro-slavery forces had sacked,
attacked and burned the

00:36:15.808 --> 00:36:19.841
anti-slavery capital of
Kansas--Lawrence,

00:36:19.841 --> 00:36:24.679
Kansas--burned a hotel and
killed six people.

00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:29.194
Brown, by killing five,
said he hadn't quite evened it

00:36:29.194 --> 00:36:33.989
up.
He spent the summer of 1856 in

00:36:33.989 --> 00:36:38.431
hiding, into the fall.
In October 1856,

00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:42.389
he left Kansas and went back
east to launch what became the

00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:46.859
Harpers Ferry conspiracy;
and in legal terms that's

00:36:46.859 --> 00:36:51.497
exactly what it was.
He launched a fundraising

00:36:51.497 --> 00:36:57.567
campaign to finance a new and
more daring attempt to take this

00:36:57.567 --> 00:37:00.950
war, as he put it,
into Africa;

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:05.115
by that he meant the South.
It was his hope of attacking,

00:37:05.115 --> 00:37:08.353
ultimately, the largest federal
arsenal in the United

00:37:08.353 --> 00:37:10.719
States--which was in Harpers
Ferry,

00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:15.092
Virginia, at the confluence of
the Shenandoah and Potomac

00:37:15.092 --> 00:37:19.462
Rivers, just some thirty,
forty miles from Washington,

00:37:19.462 --> 00:37:23.340
DC--capture that largest
federal arsenal with its

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.460
thousands of rifles and
side-arms and barrels of gun

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.443
powder,
and apparently,

00:37:30.443 --> 00:37:36.884
launch a growing,
developing, slave insurrection,

00:37:36.884 --> 00:37:42.369
down through Virginia.
And it was his hope,

00:37:42.369 --> 00:37:48.013
at least, the best we can
understand, to engage in and

00:37:48.013 --> 00:37:53.550
effect a violent coup
d'état and take over the

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:58.620
State of Virginia.
Now, to make a long and

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:04.886
dramatic story short enough,
his fundraising campaign by

00:38:04.886 --> 00:38:10.810
1857 fell by the way,
in part because of the Panic of

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.244
1857.
But he visited all over the

00:38:13.244 --> 00:38:15.281
North.
He visited the parlors of many

00:38:15.281 --> 00:38:17.380
famous abolitionists in New
England.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.400
He sat in Ralph Waldo Emerson's
study.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.262
People hosted dinners for him.
He was this fascinating,

00:38:25.262 --> 00:38:29.797
romantic, somewhat bizarre old
man with hair that was

00:38:29.797 --> 00:38:35.030
whitening, and had been out
there in Kansas raising hell.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:38.100
They didn't all know the
details of the Pottawatomie

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.629
Creek Massacre,
and even when they began to

00:38:40.629 --> 00:38:43.519
hear them they didn't want to
know too much.

00:38:43.519 --> 00:38:47.325
But Brown was leading a crusade
in Kansas to keep Kansas free

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.793
soil.
Brown was doing in Kansas what

00:38:49.793 --> 00:38:53.704
a lot of these abolitionists
back east could not themselves

00:38:53.704 --> 00:38:56.469
do but they were glad he was
doing it;

00:38:56.469 --> 00:38:59.010
began to raise some money for
him.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:04.397
He came down here to
Connecticut and he ordered some

00:39:04.397 --> 00:39:09.889
1000 spears--he called them
pikes--from a forgery,

00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:16.001
which were ultimately delivered
in boxes to a farm near Harpers

00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:20.239
Ferry, labeled famously
Beecher's Bibles;

00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:23.660
huge, heavy boxes labeled
Bibles.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.688
And then he went back west.
He established a headquarters

00:39:32.688 --> 00:39:35.235
in Tabor, Iowa,
a town known to be settled by

00:39:35.235 --> 00:39:40.497
abolitionists from the east,
a place where he could begin to

00:39:40.497 --> 00:39:46.179
recruit men and train them.
Then in early 1858 he spent one

00:39:46.179 --> 00:39:50.455
full month living in the attic
apartment of Frederick

00:39:50.455 --> 00:39:53.909
Douglass's home in Rochester,
New York.

00:39:53.909 --> 00:39:59.099
We have only one little letter
they exchanged during that time.

00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:04.820
It says, "John,
come down to dinner."

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.902
Thanks a lot guys.
But what we do know,

00:40:08.902 --> 00:40:12.052
that in that attic of Frederick
Douglass's house,

00:40:12.052 --> 00:40:16.120
John Brown wrote his so-called
Provisional Constitution for the

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.448
State of Virginia.
When he took over Virginia he

00:40:20.448 --> 00:40:24.530
was going to announce a new
Constitution.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:28.617
He, in fact,
was going to be the governor,

00:40:28.617 --> 00:40:33.293
lest you had any doubt.
And then he called a convention

00:40:33.293 --> 00:40:36.111
in May 1858, in Canada,
Chatham, Ontario,

00:40:36.111 --> 00:40:39.000
to which he invited
abolitionists now,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.727
black and white,
and it was to be a recruiting

00:40:42.727 --> 00:40:47.447
convention to recruit the men
who would become part of his

00:40:47.447 --> 00:40:50.987
abolitionist army.
Now the problem here with John

00:40:50.987 --> 00:40:54.079
Brown, for everybody who met
him--including Douglass,

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:58.018
who may have known more about
the Harpers Ferry plans than

00:40:58.018 --> 00:41:01.679
anybody alive--the problem was
he was so secretive.

00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:07.647
He would never tell people the
details of what he was doing,

00:41:07.647 --> 00:41:12.764
who he was actually hiring.
Forty-six so-called delegates

00:41:12.764 --> 00:41:16.855
went to this Chatham Convention;
thirteen of them white,

00:41:16.855 --> 00:41:20.307
the rest of them black.
Most of the people attending it

00:41:20.307 --> 00:41:23.804
were fugitive slaves living in
Canada, who had escaped slavery

00:41:23.804 --> 00:41:27.705
in the United States,
many of whom still had family

00:41:27.705 --> 00:41:30.592
back in the South.
Here was a man,

00:41:30.592 --> 00:41:34.866
in the midst of this political
crisis going on in the

00:41:34.866 --> 00:41:38.730
country--this is in 1858
now--who is saying,

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.807
"I'm going to lead you back
into the South and we're going

00:41:42.807 --> 00:41:49.070
to get your families out."
He lacked money.

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:53.236
He had hired an unreliable
drillmaster, a guy named Hugh

00:41:53.236 --> 00:41:57.782
Forbes, an English soldier of
fortune who'd been off in Italy

00:41:57.782 --> 00:42:03.307
in the late-40s and early 1850s,
kind of soldiering as a soldier

00:42:03.307 --> 00:42:08.090
of fortune with Garibaldi in the
Italian Revolution,

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:13.159
but it turns out wasn't very
reliable.

00:42:13.159 --> 00:42:16.159
He got involved with the
so-called Secret Six,

00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:20.293
New England abolitionists--time
doesn't really allow me to tell

00:42:20.293 --> 00:42:24.360
you everything about them but
they were Franklin Sanborn,

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.612
Thomas Wentworth Higginson,
Theodore Parker,

00:42:26.612 --> 00:42:28.970
Samuel Gridley Howe,
George Luther Stearns,

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.172
Gerrit Smith and others;
prominent, powerful,

00:42:32.172 --> 00:42:36.522
and in one case rich,
white, New England and Northern

00:42:36.522 --> 00:42:39.450
abolitionists who supported him.

00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:49.315
Then Brown went back out to
Kansas that winter,

00:42:49.315 --> 00:42:54.839
of '58, and in December of '58,
with a band of about thirteen

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:58.530
men, he went across the Kansas
border into Missouri,

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.593
dead of winter.
He attacked three farms,

00:43:02.593 --> 00:43:06.760
or I suppose you could call
them small plantations,

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.310
in Missouri,
where he seized eleven slaves,

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:17.161
killed one of the owners,
and then went back across the

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:23.121
border into Kansas and hid out
for awhile in the dead of

00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:27.969
January 1859,
along Pottawattamie Creek.

00:43:27.969 --> 00:43:32.971
And then he engaged in an
eighty-two day wintertime trek

00:43:32.971 --> 00:43:37.699
of over 1000 miles with these
eleven freed slaves,

00:43:37.699 --> 00:43:41.200
from Kansas north into
Nebraska, then into Iowa,

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.402
into Grinnell,
Iowa, by the way also settled

00:43:44.402 --> 00:43:48.063
by New England abolitionists.
In Grinnell,

00:43:48.063 --> 00:43:53.079
Iowa he was given the key to
the city by a Mayor.

00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:55.663
And in Grinnell,
where the railroad had reached

00:43:55.663 --> 00:43:58.302
as far as Grinnell,
Iowa, they put them all in a

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.786
boxcar,
a special boxcar,

00:44:00.786 --> 00:44:05.837
and they rode by train,
all the way to Chicago,

00:44:05.837 --> 00:44:09.679
and then all the way to
Detroit.

00:44:09.679 --> 00:44:14.471
And on the 12th of March,
1859, there was a remarkable

00:44:14.471 --> 00:44:19.895
scene on the Detroit River as
John Brown ushered these eleven

00:44:19.895 --> 00:44:25.320
freed slaves from Missouri
across the river into Canada.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.030
But at this point there was a
twelfth.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:34.479
A baby had been born in the
boxcar and its mother had named

00:44:34.479 --> 00:44:40.983
him John Brown Daniels.
So, lest we think this guy was

00:44:40.983 --> 00:44:47.808
only a lunatic--this was the
real thing, he'd freed some

00:44:47.808 --> 00:44:50.731
slaves,
and he had carted them all

00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:54.030
across the northern states,
in the dead of winter,

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.663
to their freedom.
To the extent he had a

00:44:57.663 --> 00:45:00.816
messianic image,
and a sense of himself as a

00:45:00.816 --> 00:45:04.043
Moses--actually,
his greatest hero was Oliver

00:45:04.043 --> 00:45:07.330
Cromwell.
If you know anything about the

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.343
English Civil War and the
Puritan armies,

00:45:10.343 --> 00:45:14.240
it makes sense;
it was based on something.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:20.455
Now, I only have a few minutes.
The raid on Harpers Ferry

00:45:20.455 --> 00:45:24.157
would've actually happened a bit
earlier, it would've happened in

00:45:24.157 --> 00:45:27.642
the summer of 1859,
had he been able to pull

00:45:27.642 --> 00:45:32.159
everything together and get
everybody to gather.

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:36.210
And in the end,
it is one of those sad and

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:42.138
tragic stories that then takes
on a much, much larger meaning

00:45:42.138 --> 00:45:46.090
than anyone could've ever
predicted.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.247
His so-called Provisional
Army--that's what he called

00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:52.587
it--for his Provisional
Constitution for his provisional

00:45:52.587 --> 00:45:55.827
new Virginia,
would ultimately be about

00:45:55.827 --> 00:45:59.548
twenty-two men.
He rented a farm five miles

00:45:59.548 --> 00:46:02.541
north of Harpers Ferry,
in Maryland,

00:46:02.541 --> 00:46:06.389
where they were all to gather
that summer.

00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:08.409
He wanted Frederick Douglass to
join him.

00:46:08.409 --> 00:46:11.369
He actually had met Harriet
Tubman in Canada.

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:14.290
He tried to convince Harriet
Tubman to join him.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:19.502
He'd heard of her legend.
But she was a little too smart

00:46:19.502 --> 00:46:22.409
for this.
She'd done this stuff.

00:46:22.409 --> 00:46:26.887
She had more experience in
freeing slaves and getting them

00:46:26.887 --> 00:46:30.108
out than anybody,
and she apparently said,

00:46:30.108 --> 00:46:34.394
in effect--"no thanks."
He desperately wanted Douglass

00:46:34.394 --> 00:46:38.866
to join him, and had he joined
them Douglass would've been dead

00:46:38.866 --> 00:46:42.326
in 1859.
But Douglass did have a final

00:46:42.326 --> 00:46:47.475
meeting with John Brown at an
old stone quarry outside of

00:46:47.475 --> 00:46:49.865
Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania,

00:46:49.865 --> 00:46:55.692
in late August of 1859.
He went down from New York with

00:46:55.692 --> 00:47:01.566
a fugitive slave Douglass had
helped to his freedom named

00:47:01.566 --> 00:47:05.433
Shields Green.
Here's Shields--where is

00:47:05.433 --> 00:47:09.429
he--there he is.
Douglass took him along.

00:47:09.429 --> 00:47:11.864
They met at this old stone
quarry and in Douglass's

00:47:11.864 --> 00:47:13.860
testimony they had a long
conversation.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:18.152
Brown tried one last time to
talk Douglass into coming with

00:47:18.152 --> 00:47:20.963
him, and Douglass,
in his recollection,

00:47:20.963 --> 00:47:23.480
famously said,
"I can't do it.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.264
You're going to be trapped in
a"--how does he put it--"you're

00:47:27.264 --> 00:47:30.040
going to be surrounded in a trap
of steel.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.340
You will never get out.
But if you must go, go."

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.512
And then he said to Shields
Green, "Your call,

00:47:36.512 --> 00:47:39.462
your choice."
Well it turns out Shields Green

00:47:39.462 --> 00:47:41.660
was a fugitive slave from
Virginia.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.729
His wife was still in Virginia.
He said--according to

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:49.210
Douglass--"I think I'll go with
the old man."

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:54.780
And Shields did,
and he'll die at Harpers Ferry.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:59.166
There were five black men,
finally, who joined John

00:47:59.166 --> 00:48:03.904
Brown's raid--Osborn Perry
Anderson, Dangerfield Newby,

00:48:03.904 --> 00:48:06.360
Shields Green,
John Copeland,

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.966
Lewis Leary.
Two of them were Oberlin

00:48:09.966 --> 00:48:13.784
College graduates;
three of them were former

00:48:13.784 --> 00:48:18.651
fugitive slaves.
Dangerfield Newby had a letter

00:48:18.651 --> 00:48:23.132
in his pocket from his wife,
in Virginia,

00:48:23.132 --> 00:48:29.502
when he died at Harpers Ferry.
The plan, simply put--so far as

00:48:29.502 --> 00:48:35.019
we know--was to attack Harpers
Ferry, take the federal arsenal,

00:48:35.019 --> 00:48:39.372
and begin, if he could,
to escape into the mountains,

00:48:39.372 --> 00:48:44.309
the Blue Ridge Mountains on
either side of Harpers Ferry,

00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:49.675
to establish mountain
hideaways, to try from those

00:48:49.675 --> 00:48:55.260
hideaways to get slaves to
escape into his lines,

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.830
to arm them,
and then to begin,

00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:02.285
as a guerilla warrior,
to selectively attack sites in

00:49:02.285 --> 00:49:05.849
northern Virginia,
moving on Richmond.

00:49:05.849 --> 00:49:08.665
Now, I say to the extent we
understand it,

00:49:08.665 --> 00:49:12.786
because he didn't leave us much
to go on in terms of what his

00:49:12.786 --> 00:49:16.259
actual plan was.
What we do know is the raid

00:49:16.259 --> 00:49:20.941
only lasted forty-eight hours.
They never got out of Harpers

00:49:20.941 --> 00:49:23.038
Ferry.
He did free about a dozen

00:49:23.038 --> 00:49:26.445
slaves in the surrounding
countryside, brought them into

00:49:26.445 --> 00:49:30.038
the old Fire Engine House of the
federal arsenal at Harpers

00:49:30.038 --> 00:49:32.599
Ferry,
hid out.

00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:36.419
And the news sprung across the
country like news had never

00:49:36.419 --> 00:49:40.125
spread in the United States,
partly because John Brown's

00:49:40.125 --> 00:49:43.389
first major strategic mistake,
or tactical mistake,

00:49:43.389 --> 00:49:47.576
was that the Manakosie Railroad
came through Harpers Ferry right

00:49:47.576 --> 00:49:50.730
as he was entering the town.
They stopped the train.

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:54.273
The first casualty was a free
black watchman on that train who

00:49:54.273 --> 00:49:59.128
was shot by one of Brown's men.
Then Brown, within two hours,

00:49:59.128 --> 00:50:03.259
let the train go--dumb.
The conductor of the train at

00:50:03.259 --> 00:50:06.774
the next town wired Washington
and said, "One man and 200 men

00:50:06.774 --> 00:50:10.126
are attacking Harpers Ferry."
By the time it reached

00:50:10.126 --> 00:50:14.019
Buchanan's desk in the White
House it was 500 men attacking

00:50:14.019 --> 00:50:17.477
Harpers Ferry.
And within twenty-four hours

00:50:17.477 --> 00:50:20.457
Buchanan ordered a contingent of
U.S.

00:50:20.457 --> 00:50:23.520
Marines under the command of
Robert E.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.169
Lee and a lieutenant named
J.E.B.

00:50:26.169 --> 00:50:31.053
Stuart to get to Harpers Ferry
as fast as possible and crush

00:50:31.053 --> 00:50:35.110
this slave insurrection,
which they did.

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:41.290
Now, I'm going to leave you
there, in this situation.

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:45.943
Brown was captured.
All but two or three of his men

00:50:45.943 --> 00:50:49.903
were killed or captured,
and all those captured will be

00:50:49.903 --> 00:50:51.856
hung.
One of his sons,

00:50:51.856 --> 00:50:54.760
Owen Brown, did manage to
escape.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.779
What ensued at Harpers Ferry
for 24 hours was an absolute

00:50:57.779 --> 00:50:59.989
pitched battle between the
townspeople,

00:50:59.989 --> 00:51:02.845
local militias,
and Brown's men,

00:51:02.845 --> 00:51:06.070
and many townspeople were
killed.

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:10.454
Owen Brown would escape and
eventually move as far,

00:51:10.454 --> 00:51:15.382
far away as he possibly could,
and live on a little desert

00:51:15.382 --> 00:51:19.549
farm up above Pasadena,
California, halfway up the San

00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:24.461
Gabriel Mountains,
most of the rest of his life,

00:51:24.461 --> 00:51:30.309
trying to escape the infamy of
his father's legacy.

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:33.659
Brown was captured in the
Engine House.

00:51:33.659 --> 00:51:35.829
They tried to run him through
with a sword.

00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:39.192
They beat him over the head,
they bloodied him up but,

00:51:39.192 --> 00:51:42.110
as the story goes,
he was saved by a huge brass

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:45.792
belt buckle he had,
and they kept stabbing at him

00:51:45.792 --> 00:51:49.239
and they kept hitting the brass
belt buckle.

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:52.770
He was captured,
put in jail in Charles Town,

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:55.980
Virginia, just four miles up
the road.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:01.638
And in November 1859 he would
get the most famous,

00:52:01.638 --> 00:52:08.219
sensational trial that the
United States had ever seen.

00:52:08.219 --> 00:52:12.838
I'm going to leave you there
because it's the John Brown

00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:17.457
hanging and execution and the
aftermath that is the most

00:52:17.457 --> 00:52:22.076
important template of that
election year of 1860 soon to

00:52:22.076 --> 00:52:23.076
come.

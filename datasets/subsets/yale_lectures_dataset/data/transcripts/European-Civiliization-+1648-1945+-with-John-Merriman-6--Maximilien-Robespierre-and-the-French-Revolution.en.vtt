00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.850
Prof: I'm going to talk
about the French Revolution.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.120
It's hard to do.
 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.818
I'll leave myself about
forty-five minutes after I screw

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:11.040
around at the beginning.
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
I want to do two things.
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.101
I want to see the Revolution
through the eyes of Maximilien

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:21.217
de Robespierre,
a member of the Committee of

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:24.880
Public Safety--arguably,
with Saint-Just,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.210
its most important member.
 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.127
In a way, Jacobin--he
incarnated the French

00:00:33.127 --> 00:00:34.650
Revolution.
 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.445
In doing so I want to talk
about the terror and,

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:43.048
above all, why it was that
people supported or opposed the

00:00:43.048 --> 00:00:44.260
Revolution.
 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.090
It comes down a great deal to
religion, as we'll see.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.820
But first, because I promised
that we had the only live,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.360
bootlegged album of the trial
of the king,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.094
and of his execution,
I thought I'd play those and

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:02.810
also the death of Citizen Marat
in his bathtub.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.280
To do that, I decided to bring
a prop.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.870
I'm not making light of instant
death.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.805
I just finished a book about a
guy who ends up putting his head

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:17.799
in a little window.
 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.099
You knew people were smaller
back in those days,

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:22.938
but you really didn't imagine
that they were this small.

00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:26.662
Do you know what this is,
what this comes from,

00:01:26.662 --> 00:01:28.120
this guillotine?
 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.659
Do you know what this is for?
 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.360
What?
 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.550
No.
 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.129
This is real.
 

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.890
That hurt, actually,
when I did that.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.961
Don't write your parents,
especially you freshman,

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:45.244
and say, "he was running
here waving a guillotine,

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:46.470
running around the place.
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.470
There he goes again."
 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.620
No, it's for cigars.
 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.900
Student::
That was my idea.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.950
Prof: That was your idea?
 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.209
Student::
Cigars, awesome!

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:57.180
Prof: No, don't smoke.
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.780
Anyway, can you put on the
first one?

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.150
This is the trial of the king.
 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.280
This is the king.
 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.688
I'll just translate part of it.
 

00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:08.628
I'm not going to translate the
whole thing.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:09.659
It doesn't matter if you don't
know French.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.449
This is just for ambience.
 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:20.409
This is ambience.
 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:28.919
They're putting him on trial.
 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.720
He did bad things.
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.158
I'll translate part in a minute.
 

00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:35.940
This takes probably too much
time, but it's cool.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.490
This is from a rock opera about
the French Revolution.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.629
Keith Richards live here.
 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:54.580
Keith Richards?
 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.590
This is too long to get to it.
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.930
I apologize.
 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.120
Louis XVI, this was his finest
moment.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:18.680
This is not Louis XVI.
 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.632
They're going to ask him to
respond to the charges,

00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:27.370
and the old boy will.
 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.735
"Answer the accusation,
the indictment,

00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:40.250
what you've done against the
nation."

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.530
It's nice.
 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:04:06.530
Listen.
 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.586
"Among you,
I'm looking for judges and all

00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:12.879
I see is accusers."
 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:24.339
(I won't do the whole thing.)
 

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:30.360
"I never did this horrible
thing.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.706
I never betrayed my
country"

00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:46.009
(which is patently false).
 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:53.500
"Life has given me some
misfortunes and death doesn't

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.259
frighten me at all.
 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:05.437
Maybe you can do France better
than me, take care of France

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:08.920
better than I could.
 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:19.439
Keep it from its own excesses.
 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.910
Take care of my family."
 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.740
(They didn't come out very well
either.)

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.949
"Take care of my children.
 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:59.560
It's only favor I'll ask you to
carry out.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.040
Je n'ai plus rien à
vous dire.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.069
I have nothing more to say to
you."

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.839
(They're going to vote now.
 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:17.540
Got live, got dead.)
 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.629
La mort, death.
 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.600
Saint-Just, "death."
 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:39.209
Marat--he'll get his in a few
minutes.

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:50.889
He will get his, too.
 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:07:00.209
Now, they execute the old guy.
 

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:02.990
This is the death of Citizen
Marat.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.180
He meets Charlotte Corday,
who is from Normandy and a

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.279
royalist.
 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.680
He's in his bathtub.
 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:30.170
I won't translate everything.
 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.500
"Citizen,
you're coming without knocking.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.550
You're seeing Citizen Marat
nude in his bath.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.259
What's your name?
 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:38.850
Charlotte.
 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.779
You have very nice eyes.
 

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:42.110
Come here a little closer.
 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.079
What can I do for you?"
 

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:47.209
(I won't translate that.)
 

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:55.589
"Do you like them, Citizen?
 

00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:58.740
Why are you looking so mean all
of a sudden?

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.879
To make you afraid, you bastard.
 

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:03.370
What's the knife for?
 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:09.399
Argh!"
 

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.129
You heard it live.
 

00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:13.370
That's it.
 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:24.970
Okay.
 

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:42.710
Can we get the lights, please?
 

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.712
Maximilien Robespierre was born
on May 6,1758 in Arras,

00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:50.864
a beautiful town destroyed in
World War I in the north of

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:51.679
France.
 

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:53.279
His father was a lawyer.
 

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.918
He was the son and grandson of
lawyers.

00:08:55.918 --> 00:09:00.249
His father married the daughter
of a well-to-do brewer and they

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:04.370
were married a few months before
the birth of Maximilien.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.240
Two daughters,
one who died,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.667
this is fairly normal,
and Augustin,

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:10.470
his brother,
followed.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.139
His mother died giving birth to
a fifth child who barely

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:15.139
survived her.
 

00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:18.823
The father was unstable,
always leaving home at the time

00:09:18.823 --> 00:09:21.370
of the birth of all of his
children.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.620
He finally died in Germany.
 

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.370
So, Robespierre never had a
family.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.870
Psychohistorians have done a
lot with this.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.359
The family of four was left in
the care of a maternal

00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:33.970
grandmother and aunts.
 

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.303
Essentially,
he was an orphan at the age of

00:09:37.303 --> 00:09:37.940
eight.
 

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.081
He felt his father's guilt
about causing the death of his

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:42.600
wife.
 

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.629
His sister remembered after his
father left,

00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:49.142
disappeared,
"A total change came about

00:09:49.142 --> 00:09:51.041
in him,
forming like all other children

00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:52.461
of his age,
he was thoughtless and

00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:53.308
turbulent and flighty.
 

00:09:53.308 --> 00:09:57.332
But since he became the family
head, so to speak,

00:09:57.332 --> 00:10:01.524
by virtue of being the eldest,
he's become settled,

00:10:01.524 --> 00:10:04.038
responsible and laborious.
 

00:10:04.038 --> 00:10:09.740
He spoke to us with the kind of
gravity which impressed us.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.000
If he was to take part in our
games, it was in order to direct

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.490
them.
 

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.149
He loved us tenderly and there
were no attentions and caresses

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:20.490
that he did not lavish upon
us."

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.702
Henceforth, if you buy a
psychohistorian's

00:10:23.702 --> 00:10:27.306
interpretation,
"He could only be a man of

00:10:27.306 --> 00:10:28.090
order.
 

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.227
He desperately tried to
assimilate himself to the social

00:10:32.227 --> 00:10:32.830
order.
 

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:38.732
He both loved and hated his
father as he adored his dead

00:10:38.732 --> 00:10:39.700
mother.
 

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.422
His whole life was marked by
feeling of his father's guilt,

00:10:43.422 --> 00:10:47.015
which also represented the
death in a real way of his own

00:10:47.015 --> 00:10:48.298
childhood."
 

00:10:48.298 --> 00:10:51.642
In his last hours,
his death wish,

00:10:51.642 --> 00:10:57.619
his inability to act when he
might have saved himself can be

00:10:57.619 --> 00:11:01.570
seen, if you will,
in that context.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.240
He was forced into a
seriousness and responsibility.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.590
He always had a passion for
solitude, isolation.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.200
He knew what it was to be poor.
 

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.600
He was an example of sort of
downward mobility.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.517
He went to school and he was
really smart,

00:11:16.517 --> 00:11:20.359
supported by charitable
foundations, first in Arras and

00:11:20.359 --> 00:11:21.639
then in Paris.
 

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:24.626
At age eleven to the
college or middle school

00:11:24.626 --> 00:11:27.496
of Louis le Grand,
where he became a star classics

00:11:27.496 --> 00:11:28.200
scholar.
 

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.705
He was selected among all the
other pupils to read a poem that

00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:36.989
he had composed to none less
than the king and the queen as

00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:40.710
they passed by Reims,
also in the north of France,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.259
in champagne country.
 

00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:46.232
As it was raining,
the king and the queen ordered

00:11:46.232 --> 00:11:49.880
the driver to go on,
not stopping to listen to

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.658
Robespierre's little poem and,
indeed,

00:11:53.658 --> 00:11:59.221
splashing his only good suit of
clothes with mud as they drove

00:11:59.221 --> 00:11:59.769
off.
 

00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:03.450
He became a lawyer,
getting his degree in 1780 in

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.360
Paris, a lawyer at the
Parlement of Paris.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.707
His scholarship passed,
as things did in the old

00:12:10.707 --> 00:12:13.058
regime, to his younger brother.
 

00:12:13.058 --> 00:12:17.605
He entered literary contests
that were run by the

00:12:17.605 --> 00:12:19.308
Académie.
 

00:12:19.308 --> 00:12:23.116
It was once said that he even
caught sight of the great

00:12:23.116 --> 00:12:26.288
Rousseau, but that seems a
little unlikely.

00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:29.048
But in Metz,
the Académie awarded him

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:31.548
400 pounds, which was a lot of
money.

00:12:31.548 --> 00:12:35.038
He was elected to the
Académie of Arras.

00:12:35.038 --> 00:12:39.220
In law cases he championed the
poor, the humble.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.583
He took the side of a man in an
abbey who had been accused by

00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:47.220
the monks of a theft,
when in fact one of the monks

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.330
had done the ripping off.
 

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.970
He once said when somebody was
condemned to death,

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.860
"I know very well that he
is guilty,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.418
but I can't imagine to send
someone to his own death."

00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:03.933
At the beginning,
but only in the beginning,

00:13:03.933 --> 00:13:06.450
he did not believe in capital
punishment;

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:11.446
although, arguably those who
agree with him would say that he

00:13:11.446 --> 00:13:16.110
saved the Revolution by meting
out capital punishment.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:22.460
Because of his reputation--this
was a classic case of a young

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:28.705
lawyer on the make--he's elected
to the Estates General from

00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:29.870
Artois.
 

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.860
He's unknown.
 

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.764
When he goes to Paris he's
called in the minutes sometimes

00:13:34.764 --> 00:13:38.190
"Robes-Pierre,"
sometimes Robespierre.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.754
Sometimes Robert,
like the name Robert,

00:13:40.754 --> 00:13:44.600
or sometimes simply Robert,
as if that was his first name,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.759
and Pierre, his second name.
 

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:51.970
But he began to make a mark,
speaking always very softly.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.820
Sixty-eight times he spoke in
1789 and he gradually gets his

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.058
reputation there.
 

00:13:57.058 --> 00:14:00.418
He opposes all restrictions on
the freedom of the press,

00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:03.350
and of course that would change
later as well.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.105
He invokes Rousseau's concept
of the general will to support

00:14:07.105 --> 00:14:10.986
the view that the king should
have no right to oppose or delay

00:14:10.986 --> 00:14:14.169
legislative measures proposed by
the assembly.

00:14:14.169 --> 00:14:17.480
You know this from your reading.
 

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.447
He sided on the left of the
assembly with those who went to

00:14:22.447 --> 00:14:27.585
Varennes to bring back Louis XVI
when he and Marie Antoinette

00:14:27.585 --> 00:14:31.952
tried to hightail it to the
southern Netherlands or,

00:14:31.952 --> 00:14:34.179
that is, to Belgium.
 

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:36.799
That was the king, by the way.
 

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:38.580
He should have been there first.
 

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:45.590
That's the king.
 

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:50.639
There's Marat fully clothed.
 

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:54.870
There is Maximilien Robespierre.
 

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.879
Although he spoke often,
he lacked presence and color.

00:14:57.879 --> 00:15:00.679
This would be the case until
the very end.

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:03.892
The English writer, Carlyle,
saw him as "anxious,

00:15:03.892 --> 00:15:05.400
slight,
an ineffectual looking man in

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.720
spectacles,
his eyes troubled, careful,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.460
with an upturned face.
 

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.000
Dimly trying to understand the
uncertain future times,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.048
but he spoke with an intense
passion and conviction,

00:15:18.048 --> 00:15:20.559
a belief in all that he
said."

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:25.476
Mirabeau, who died of syphilis,
one of the king's main

00:15:25.476 --> 00:15:28.779
advisors,
said of him,

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:31.423
"That man will go far,
because he believes every

00:15:31.423 --> 00:15:33.158
single thing that he says."
 

00:15:33.158 --> 00:15:35.624
He seemed rigid in his
principles, plain,

00:15:35.624 --> 00:15:37.350
unaffected in his manners.
 

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.311
"Nothing,"
said an Englishman,

00:15:39.311 --> 00:15:41.524
"of the volatility of a
Frenchman in his

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:42.529
character."
 

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:47.541
He supported the idea that all
male citizens should have the

00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:51.328
right to vote and thus,
he opposed the idea of having

00:15:51.328 --> 00:15:53.559
active citizens,
who pay taxes,

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:57.049
and passive citizens,
who did not have enough money

00:15:57.049 --> 00:15:59.918
to pay taxes and thus could not
vote.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:01.513
He calls for,
among others,

00:16:01.513 --> 00:16:04.148
the deposition of--the king's
being deposed,

00:16:04.148 --> 00:16:08.070
both in the legal sense and
being deposed from the monarchy.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.940
He was already known as
"the incorruptible."

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.240
He received letters of
admiration.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.092
Once leaving the assembly a
crowd put oak leaves around him

00:16:19.092 --> 00:16:22.860
and carried him around the city
in triumph.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.019
He always wore impeccably white
clothes.

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:28.769
He wore a powdered wig,
which is very much an old

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:31.350
regime thing and not a
revolutionary thing.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.508
He was not somebody who was
going to go out and tutoie

00:16:33.508 --> 00:16:34.009
easily.
 

00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:37.462
The revolutionaries
tutoient--tutoie

00:16:37.462 --> 00:16:41.530
is in the familiar form,
like du in German,

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.220
as opposed to Sie.
 

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.808
Du is the familiar form.
 

00:16:44.808 --> 00:16:46.607
All were equal,
therefore, he didn't say

00:16:46.607 --> 00:16:49.558
vous to people who were
above you in the social ladder.

00:16:49.558 --> 00:16:51.080
He didn't like people touching
him.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.210
Indeed, probably he was chaste.
 

00:16:54.210 --> 00:17:00.452
He had only a few flimsy and
only by mail flirtations with

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:01.330
women.
 

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.391
When they picked him up,
you have to imagine a sort of

00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:07.598
crassly American analogy,
where a football coach who's

00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:10.548
sort of swept off his feet after
a big upset or something.

00:17:10.548 --> 00:17:12.460
He doesn't like people touching
him.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.318
He doesn't like being carried
away by them.

00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:24.180
He was ascetic,
always preferred being alone.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.410
He ate very modestly.
 

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.278
One letter to him said,
"As incorruptible as you

00:17:28.278 --> 00:17:30.500
are courageous,"
and he was that,

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.410
"you have always openly
displayed your feelings.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.748
It has never been self interest
that has made you act or speak,

00:17:36.748 --> 00:17:38.578
only the general
interest."

00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:45.269
He identified with ordinary
people and he ends up living in

00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:48.289
western Paris,
a more prosperous part of

00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:50.541
Paris,
but in the home of a carpenter

00:17:50.541 --> 00:17:53.920
on a street called the Faubourg
Saint-Honoré.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.910
Those were really his happiest
moments.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.880
It provided him with a family.
 

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.125
It had young children in it
that he really hadn't had--a

00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:04.210
very normal circumstance.
 

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.835
People who came to see him saw
him sort of stretched out on the

00:18:07.835 --> 00:18:11.285
couch with his family trying to
guess from the way he looked

00:18:11.285 --> 00:18:12.630
what he might want.
 

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.660
Would he want more grapes?
 

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.220
Would he want more milk,
et cetera?

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.690
He read a lot.
 

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.558
He wrote his speeches,
which were written out by hand.

00:18:23.558 --> 00:18:28.781
He was always well combed and
powdered, the cleanest of

00:18:28.781 --> 00:18:31.490
dressing gowns,
et cetera.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:35.190
He began to be a frequenter of
the Jacobin Club.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.809
These clubs,
like the Feuillants,

00:18:36.809 --> 00:18:39.160
and the Cordeliers,
and the Jacobins,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.203
were called that not because
they had anything to do with the

00:18:42.203 --> 00:18:44.705
religious orders,
like the Jacobins were a

00:18:44.705 --> 00:18:45.759
religious order.
 

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:49.368
The biggest places you could
meet were churches and abbeys.

00:18:49.368 --> 00:18:51.150
Those were always the biggest
buildings.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.868
The Jacobins,
who were on the left of these

00:18:54.868 --> 00:19:00.446
clubs, begin meeting right even
before the Bastille falls on the

00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:02.750
14^(th) of July,
1789.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.670
He begins to go to the Jacobin
Club.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.905
The Jacobin become the great
leftwing centralizers of the

00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:10.890
revolution.
 

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.660
They trumpet the authority of
the Parisian Sans-Culottes.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.616
That's another French term so
important it worked its way into

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.108
English dictionaries.
 

00:19:20.108 --> 00:19:23.068
The Sans-Culottes were those
who supported the Revolution.

00:19:23.068 --> 00:19:24.296
Technically,
if you said sans

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:26.630
culottes it meant somebody
who was not wearing pants.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:27.808
That's not what it meant.
 

00:19:27.808 --> 00:19:31.498
What it meant was not wearing
fancy kind of aristocratic

00:19:31.498 --> 00:19:34.717
breeches, and it became
identified with a form of

00:19:34.717 --> 00:19:36.259
political behavior.
 

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.846
You could be an aristocrat,
and there were liberal

00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:40.992
aristocrats,
in a meeting in a club called

00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:44.078
the Club of the Thirty,
who helped push the Revolution

00:19:44.078 --> 00:19:46.640
really toward constitutional
monarchy,

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.940
at least in the beginning.
 

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.284
If you were against the
Revolution, you were an

00:19:50.284 --> 00:19:51.099
aristo.
 

00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:52.108
You were an aristocrat.
 

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:56.558
If you were for the Revolution,
you were part of the people.

00:19:56.558 --> 00:20:01.075
You chose the color red,
because red becomes the color

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:05.420
of the leftwing interpretation
of the Revolution.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.509
You gave people kisses on both
sides of the cheeks or three

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:11.374
times,
depending on where you were in

00:20:11.374 --> 00:20:14.314
France,
as recognizing the solidarity

00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:16.845
you had as being a
citoyen,

00:20:16.845 --> 00:20:20.305
that is, a male citizen,
or a citoyenne,

00:20:20.305 --> 00:20:20.868
female citizen.
 

00:20:20.868 --> 00:20:23.346
The whole idea of kissing,
by the way, is terribly

00:20:23.346 --> 00:20:25.318
important in France,
but that's mostly a

00:20:25.318 --> 00:20:28.048
late-nineteenth and
early-twentieth-century thing.

00:20:28.048 --> 00:20:31.153
People really kept their
distance, whereas now if you

00:20:31.153 --> 00:20:34.019
live in Paris you kiss twice,
or in the Sixteenth

00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:37.210
Arrondissement not at all;
you merely shake hands.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.846
If you live in the Parisian
suburbs, often you kiss four

00:20:39.846 --> 00:20:40.230
times.
 

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.118
If you live in the south of
France, you kiss three times.

00:20:44.118 --> 00:20:45.702
In the Department of the
Hérault,

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:47.855
which is Bas-Languedoc,
if you live in Béziers,

00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:48.869
you kiss three times.
 

00:20:48.869 --> 00:20:52.461
If you live in Montpellier,
which is a more aristocratic

00:20:52.461 --> 00:20:55.143
city traditionally,
a more formal city--it was a

00:20:55.143 --> 00:20:59.415
big university town,
it really rocks--you kiss only

00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:00.160
twice.
 

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.673
But this idea of kissing people
on the cheeks was a sign of

00:21:03.673 --> 00:21:05.309
revolutionary solidarity.
 

00:21:05.309 --> 00:21:07.240
Symbols were very important.
 

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.608
If you carried pikes around,
pikes at the Battle of Valmy,

00:21:10.608 --> 00:21:15.381
which you can read about--is
the pikes of the Sans-Culottes

00:21:15.381 --> 00:21:19.083
that stopped the
highly-professional armies of

00:21:19.083 --> 00:21:21.880
the enemies of the Revolution.
 

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:29.858
So, he believes in the
necessity of a single will.

00:21:29.858 --> 00:21:34.474
Again, this comes out of
Rousseau's idea of the general

00:21:34.474 --> 00:21:38.750
will to save the revolution
against its enemies.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:46.452
He is one of the people that
helps push the French Revolution

00:21:46.452 --> 00:21:48.250
to the left.
 

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.960
His principles were totally
unshakable.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.108
He doesn't budge on them at all.
 

00:21:56.108 --> 00:22:00.055
Of course, it's just insane to
look back and see in Robespierre

00:22:00.055 --> 00:22:04.000
the origins of totalitarianism,
despite the Committee of Public

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.700
Safety.
 

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.680
Robespierre also was a man of
his times.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.318
He was not against all property.
 

00:22:09.318 --> 00:22:13.209
He was against les gros,
people having too much unearned

00:22:13.209 --> 00:22:13.900
property.
 

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.078
He thought everybody should
have enough to get along,

00:22:18.078 --> 00:22:21.063
but that even people who didn't
have any property and thus

00:22:21.063 --> 00:22:23.549
didn't pay any taxes,
as I said before,

00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:27.009
ought to have the right to vote.
 

00:22:27.009 --> 00:22:30.644
He also, like the Jacobins,
believed that they ought to

00:22:30.644 --> 00:22:32.058
have enough to eat.
 

00:22:32.058 --> 00:22:36.386
One of the tensions that one
found in French Revolutionary

00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:39.680
political clubs,
and political societies,

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.997
and in the neighborhood
sections that began planning how

00:22:42.997 --> 00:22:45.952
you would defend your
neighborhood against foreign

00:22:45.952 --> 00:22:49.208
invaders or insurgents from
within--the price of bread,

00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:51.380
of course, counted enormously.
 

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.423
In a couple of weeks I'm going
to talk about what difference

00:22:54.423 --> 00:22:56.538
bread made in terms of popular
protest.

00:22:56.538 --> 00:23:01.510
People who believed in the kind
of free trade that Turgot had in

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.930
the 1870s believed that the
market ought to determine the

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.430
price of bread.
 

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.346
But there was always a
tradition that the price of

00:23:10.346 --> 00:23:13.023
bread ought to be kept at a
reasonable amount,

00:23:13.023 --> 00:23:16.000
so that everybody ought to have
enough to eat.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.989
So, the Jacobins,
most of them believed in the

00:23:18.989 --> 00:23:21.114
maximum, "the
maximum,"

00:23:21.114 --> 00:23:24.170
which was a maximum on the
price of bread.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:29.176
Now, their enemies on the
revolutionary left,

00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:32.640
or left central,
were called the Girondins,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.170
which I wrote on the board and
a name I sent around on the

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.099
class server.
 

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:40.653
The Girondins,
G-I-R-O-N-D-I-N-S--which is

00:23:40.653 --> 00:23:44.904
also the name of the Bordeaux
soccer team--were from Bordeaux

00:23:44.904 --> 00:23:47.670
and the department of the
Girondin,

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:48.940
many of them were.
 

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.910
They are merchants.
 

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:57.936
They are free trade people and
they also were extremely

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:04.834
interested in launching foreign
wars to carry liberty,

00:24:04.834 --> 00:24:09.519
fraternity, and equality
abroad.

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:12.078
I'm scrambling for this great
quote.

00:24:12.078 --> 00:24:16.558
The Girondins were in love with
war.

00:24:16.558 --> 00:24:22.551
There was this great rhetoric
about conquest and carrying

00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:26.940
"freedom"
to other countries.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.983
Although one had to be,
and many people were,

00:24:29.983 --> 00:24:32.674
cynical about this,
when the French troops poured

00:24:32.674 --> 00:24:35.935
into the Rhineland,
the prostitutes of the

00:24:35.935 --> 00:24:39.509
Rhineland cities dressed up in
red, white,

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:46.529
and blue flags to welcome their
new clients.

00:24:46.529 --> 00:24:51.338
Robespierre made a series of
speeches against this Brissot,

00:24:51.338 --> 00:24:55.078
who was the former Grub Street
writer that I mentioned before,

00:24:55.078 --> 00:24:57.180
arguing that France should not
go to war.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.979
He said that--and more about
this in a minute--that the

00:24:59.979 --> 00:25:02.778
danger to the Revolution did not
come from a handful of

00:25:02.778 --> 00:25:04.750
émigrés in
Germany,

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.559
but from within France,
from the counter-revolution.

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.450
That's important.
 

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.808
That's worth underlining.
 

00:25:10.808 --> 00:25:13.737
Secondly, he argued that
launching wars all over the

00:25:13.737 --> 00:25:16.778
place will merely play into the
hands of the king,

00:25:16.778 --> 00:25:18.490
who at this point was still the
king,

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.519
and the counter
revolutionaries,

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:24.750
perhaps paving the way for some
sort of military dictatorship.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.700
How forward-looking was that?
 

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.175
Because that's exactly what
they ended up with,

00:25:30.175 --> 00:25:31.630
of course, with Napoleon.
 

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.262
Moreover, he argued that war
would separate soldiers from the

00:25:35.262 --> 00:25:36.413
rest of the people.
 

00:25:36.413 --> 00:25:38.740
Indeed,
the levée en

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.119
masse--my guillotine almost
fell down--would compromise

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:45.516
that,
because all citizens become

00:25:45.516 --> 00:25:47.549
soldiers, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:49.279
But he said something.
 

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:51.690
This is an amazing little
speech that he gave.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.460
I'm going to read just a few
lines of it.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:59.385
If you think about current
politics in this country in the

00:25:59.385 --> 00:26:03.650
last five years,
it may also ring true.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.762
Robespierre said,
"The most extravagant idea

00:26:07.762 --> 00:26:11.174
that can arise in a politician's
head is to believe that it is

00:26:11.174 --> 00:26:14.698
enough for a people to invade a
foreign country to make it adopt

00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:16.880
their laws and their
constitution.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.920
No one loves armed missionaries.
 

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.026
The declaration of the rights
of man is not a beam of sunlight

00:26:24.026 --> 00:26:27.396
that shines on all men,
and it is not a lightening bolt

00:26:27.396 --> 00:26:30.368
which strikes every throne at
the same time.

00:26:30.368 --> 00:26:34.173
I am far from claiming that a
revolution will not eventually

00:26:34.173 --> 00:26:38.107
influence the fate of the world,
but I say that it will not be

00:26:38.107 --> 00:26:39.140
today."
 

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.430
Amazing!
 

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:46.740
He lost this debate in 1792
and, in fact,

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.746
his denunciation of plots
against the Revolution may have

00:26:50.746 --> 00:26:53.680
contributed to revolutionary
paranoia,

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.630
which would be acted out in the
terror.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.836
On the 20^(th) of April,
1792 the Girondins and the king

00:27:00.836 --> 00:27:05.109
got their wish and war was
declared on Austria and French

00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:08.240
troops crossed into Belgium,
that is,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.808
the Austria-Netherlands,
and the wars went on and on.

00:27:14.808 --> 00:27:17.608
I want to make a couple points
that are pretty important.

00:27:17.608 --> 00:27:20.400
I'm not going to use these
papers to do this.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:26.438
The threat to the Revolution
did not come just from Austria,

00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:29.712
from Great Britain,
from Prussia,

00:27:29.712 --> 00:27:33.500
from Russia,
from the big allies.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.818
Robespierre got this right.
 

00:27:35.818 --> 00:27:41.085
There are two--and the timing
of this you can read about in

00:27:41.085 --> 00:27:46.805
the chapter and please do--main
counter-revolutionary threats to

00:27:46.805 --> 00:27:48.529
the Revolution.
 

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:52.875
The first, which was not the
most important but still is

00:27:52.875 --> 00:27:57.220
worth mentioning was what has
been called the federalist

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.088
revolt.
 

00:27:58.088 --> 00:28:01.933
This was based in cities in
which merchants,

00:28:01.933 --> 00:28:05.690
free traders,
played a big role in that.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.460
Here is a map of la belle
France.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.519
Bordeaux we've already talked
about.

00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:15.019
You've got all these wine
merchants and all this fancy

00:28:15.019 --> 00:28:17.990
land and who merchant other
things as well.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.660
You've got Marseilles.
 

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.932
Toulon is not yet the huge port
it had become in the nineteenth

00:28:22.932 --> 00:28:23.299
century.
 

00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:24.558
We've got Marseilles.
 

00:28:24.558 --> 00:28:27.869
You've got Lyon,
then France's second city,

00:28:27.869 --> 00:28:31.890
first in gastronomy,
one could still argue today.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.450
Varennes was merely where the
king is caught.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.380
That's up there.
 

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.321
By the way, in 1790,
in order to undercut local

00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:42.920
elites,
that is clergy and nobles,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.691
and also to impart a more
rational organization of the

00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:48.410
country--it comes right out of
the Enlightenment,

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.085
out of the
philosophes--they create

00:28:50.085 --> 00:28:51.269
départements.
 

00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:55.251
They name most of them after
rivers, though some are named

00:28:55.251 --> 00:28:56.509
after mountains.
 

00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:59.558
They create a capital in each
of them.

00:28:59.558 --> 00:29:01.701
None of this matters,
but it's just to tell you

00:29:01.701 --> 00:29:02.538
what's going on.
 

00:29:02.538 --> 00:29:04.769
That's Haute-Vienne,
the capital is Limoges.

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:07.058
That's the Corrèze,
the capital is Tulle.

00:29:07.058 --> 00:29:09.960
Up there is the Creuse,
the capital is Guéret.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.838
This is Rouen in the
Seine-Maritime,.

00:29:13.838 --> 00:29:18.644
This is the Atlantic Pyrenees,
the capital is Pau,

00:29:18.644 --> 00:29:20.900
et cetera, et cetera.
 

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.510
The federalist revolt also in
Cannes, that's where the

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:28.598
aforementioned Charlotte Corday
came from, from that part.

00:29:28.598 --> 00:29:32.192
That's the department of the
Calvados, which is also the name

00:29:32.192 --> 00:29:33.990
of a wonderful apple brandy.
 

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:39.856
The federalist revolt comes in,
above all, in Lyon,

00:29:39.856 --> 00:29:43.730
Cannes, Marseilles,
and Toulon.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:48.647
Of course, the revolutionary
armies, the armies of ordinary

00:29:48.647 --> 00:29:53.227
citizens in the republic,
what has become the republic,

00:29:53.227 --> 00:29:54.500
crush them.
 

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.180
They crush them like grapes.
 

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.538
In Lyon, one of the members of
the Committee of Public Safety,

00:29:59.538 --> 00:30:02.140
who was confined to a
wheelchair,

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.470
a man named Couthon,
who you can read about,

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.454
C-O-U-T-H-O-N,
says he's going to plow Lyon

00:30:09.454 --> 00:30:14.201
under like Carthage;
and they do execute people on

00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:16.288
the Place Bellecour.
 

00:30:16.288 --> 00:30:21.030
So, this federalist revolt is
against the Jacobins,

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:25.772
a Parisian-centered,
far-left interpretation of the

00:30:25.772 --> 00:30:27.858
French Revolution.
 

00:30:27.858 --> 00:30:30.348
By the way, there are groups
even further to the left.

00:30:30.348 --> 00:30:32.473
The Jacobins really weren't
that far to the left,

00:30:32.473 --> 00:30:34.422
but there are groups like The
Enraged, les

00:30:34.422 --> 00:30:35.440
Enragés.
 

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.869
There's even a guy called
Gracchus Babeuf,

00:30:38.869 --> 00:30:42.970
who believed that property
should be abolished.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.798
These are just very small
groups.

00:30:45.798 --> 00:30:48.915
Babeuf is guillotined in
Vendôme,

00:30:48.915 --> 00:30:52.279
which is south of Paris near
the Loire.

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:56.067
His trial is a wonderful
source, the trial of Gracchus

00:30:56.067 --> 00:30:58.140
Babeuf, an original source.
 

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.710
Anyway, that's the federalist
revolt.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.875
But the most important threat
to the revolution comes from

00:31:04.875 --> 00:31:05.680
peasants.
 

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.061
It comes from peasants in the
west of France,

00:31:09.061 --> 00:31:12.674
also down where we live,
in this part of France,

00:31:12.674 --> 00:31:13.289
too.
 

00:31:13.289 --> 00:31:14.450
That comes later.
 

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:19.204
Basically, what I'm going to
talk about for a few minutes is

00:31:19.204 --> 00:31:21.220
the revolt in the west.
 

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.367
It was often said that peasants
would never march more than a

00:31:24.367 --> 00:31:27.217
day away from their fields;
but certainly,

00:31:27.217 --> 00:31:32.150
as Mao, or Ho Chi Minh,
and lots of other people have

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.660
shown, that's not the case at
all.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.336
The war was fought with a
savagery, with a brutality that

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:42.338
was simply staggering.
 

00:31:42.338 --> 00:31:45.038
There were massacres on both
sides.

00:31:45.038 --> 00:31:49.040
The Vendée,
which is in dark there,

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:54.019
became a department,
good old number eighty-five.

00:31:54.019 --> 00:31:58.739
But it became such a major
blood bath, that the entire

00:31:58.739 --> 00:32:03.727
counter-revolution in the west
is often simply called the

00:32:03.727 --> 00:32:05.328
Vendée.
 

00:32:05.328 --> 00:32:09.798
I am in history literally
because I read a long time ago a

00:32:09.798 --> 00:32:13.720
book written by my late and
much-missed friend,

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.625
Charles Tilley,
called The Vendée

00:32:16.625 --> 00:32:18.490
,
which sought to explain,

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.182
and did explain,
and really hasn't been nuanced

00:32:21.182 --> 00:32:24.358
very much over the decades,
why some people opposed the

00:32:24.358 --> 00:32:27.470
revolution,
taking big-time chances.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:31.974
Other people who didn't live
that far away supported the

00:32:31.974 --> 00:32:33.038
revolution.
 

00:32:33.038 --> 00:32:35.730
What he found--he studied an
area,

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.887
it doesn't matter where,
but sort of the north of that

00:32:39.887 --> 00:32:42.269
dark area,
actually in the Maine-et-Loire,

00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:45.665
a different department--but
here's another French word

00:32:45.665 --> 00:32:48.839
that's also English,
in the bocage country,

00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:50.690
B-O-C-A-G-E.
 

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.720
It's the hedgerow country.
 

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.759
He found that the people who
rose up against the revolution

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:59.220
and took big-time chances--the
republicans didn't screw around,

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.130
and there was a lot of horrible
brutality.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.592
They drowned thousands of
clergy in the swirling waters of

00:33:05.592 --> 00:33:08.058
the Loire River,
which is a really dangerous

00:33:08.058 --> 00:33:09.579
river,
by putting them out into the

00:33:09.579 --> 00:33:11.910
river with holes drilled in the
bottom of the boat,

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.170
which didn't give them a big
hope.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.314
They killed lots of people on
the Il de Ré,

00:33:16.314 --> 00:33:18.558
which is up here off La
Rochelle.

00:33:18.558 --> 00:33:22.292
Of course, the forces
representing the monarchy,

00:33:22.292 --> 00:33:25.628
representing the nobles,
were, if anything,

00:33:25.628 --> 00:33:26.900
more brutal.
 

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.950
They crucified people,
literally.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:33.519
They made them kiss the cross
before they beat them to death.

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:38.710
It was really a nasty time.
 

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.759
Looking at people who rebelled
and ones who didn't,

00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:45.281
one of the things we can say at
least about that particular

00:33:45.281 --> 00:33:46.858
area,
but it really rings true,

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:49.319
is that areas in which that
traditional elite,

00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:53.334
noble and priest,
had not been broken down by the

00:33:53.334 --> 00:33:56.730
economic and social changes of
the eighteenth century.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.700
They were physically isolated.
 

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:06.903
These hedges,
you see them also in the in the

00:34:06.903 --> 00:34:10.820
Manche in Normandy.
 

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.306
These are huge hedgerows that
you literally can't fight your

00:34:14.306 --> 00:34:16.789
way through and can't really
climb over.

00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:20.492
People tended to marry within
their village or within a nearby

00:34:20.492 --> 00:34:21.099
village.
 

00:34:21.099 --> 00:34:24.510
The priests still walked tall.
 

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.572
The noble was somebody who they
still respected,

00:34:27.572 --> 00:34:30.309
even though many of the nobles
had left.

00:34:30.309 --> 00:34:34.989
Many of them they still had to
pay dues to the nobles.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:38.230
Their only contact with this
kind of bourgeois world of

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.469
economic change was with people
who were farming taxes,

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.530
for example,
whom they hated,

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.728
people who were putting out
work into the countryside who

00:34:45.728 --> 00:34:47.960
cheated them and said,
"I told you I'd give you

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.371
five sous last time,
but there are a lot of women

00:34:50.371 --> 00:34:51.518
doing that same work.
 

00:34:51.518 --> 00:34:53.577
I'm going to give you three and
if you don't like that,

00:34:53.577 --> 00:34:53.960
too bad.
 

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.744
I'll walk away and I won't take
the cloth work that you've done

00:34:56.744 --> 00:34:57.150
for me.
 

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.889
Too bad for you."
 

00:34:58.889 --> 00:35:01.570
Or people that collected the
taxes for the nobles.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:05.099
If you look up further along
the Loire River where you had

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:08.443
this sort of economic change in
the eighteenth century,

00:35:08.443 --> 00:35:10.550
people accepted this new lead.
 

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:15.059
They were willing to ditch the
idea of the monarch.

00:35:15.059 --> 00:35:18.485
It wasn't that they all read
Rousseau instead of the Bible

00:35:18.485 --> 00:35:23.239
before they went to bed,
but these were big-time changes

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:27.579
that reflected the way things
had evolved.

00:35:27.579 --> 00:35:31.360
Let me give you some more
examples.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.706
One of the most important
moments of the French

00:35:33.706 --> 00:35:36.260
Revolution--and this is also
worth remembering,

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.971
and you can read about it--is
the civil constitution of the

00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:39.719
French clergy.
 

00:35:39.719 --> 00:35:43.733
The revolutionaries get the
very good idea that you're

00:35:43.733 --> 00:35:44.340
broke.
 

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.489
We already know that.
 

00:35:45.489 --> 00:35:47.409
The monarchy is just flat
broke, so where are you going to

00:35:47.409 --> 00:35:47.949
get the money?
 

00:35:47.949 --> 00:35:51.570
Who has money?
 

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.768
Well, nobles who leave France
have money,

00:35:53.768 --> 00:35:55.199
because they have a lot of
property,

00:35:55.199 --> 00:36:01.574
particularly in areas like
Brittany and in Burgundy and in

00:36:01.574 --> 00:36:04.929
Ile-de-France,
around Paris.

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:07.878
But the church has enormous
amounts of money,

00:36:07.878 --> 00:36:09.690
enormous amounts of land.
 

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.898
What they do is they
essentially nationalize the

00:36:11.898 --> 00:36:13.920
church,
the details you can get,

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.759
and they force people to take
an oath to the French

00:36:19.759 --> 00:36:23.030
Revolution, to the nation.
 

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:27.284
In certain parts of France,
particularly those that rose up

00:36:27.284 --> 00:36:30.878
against the Revolution,
the priests don't take the

00:36:30.878 --> 00:36:31.539
oath.
 

00:36:31.539 --> 00:36:32.969
They refuse to.
 

00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:37.760
They are called non-juring,
that is, non-swearing,

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.010
priests, J-U-R-I-N-G.
 

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:43.590
In other parts of France,
the priests were more willing

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:47.170
to take the oath and they were
called juring clergy.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.030
This is important.
 

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.708
If you just look at this map,
you see this is by

00:36:51.708 --> 00:36:55.230
cantons,
cantons within departments.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.452
You can see all that white up
in Brittany and those

00:36:57.452 --> 00:36:58.429
revolutionary areas.
 

00:36:58.429 --> 00:37:01.594
It corresponds exactly to the
area of people who fought

00:37:01.594 --> 00:37:03.469
against the French Revolution.
 

00:37:03.469 --> 00:37:06.719
Because the clergy still has
enormous influence,

00:37:06.719 --> 00:37:09.003
and so do the nobles,
even if they're living in

00:37:09.003 --> 00:37:10.800
England at the moment,
or living in Britain,

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.679
or living in the Austrian
Southern Netherlands,

00:37:13.679 --> 00:37:17.297
or in the Rhineland or
somewhere else in the German

00:37:17.297 --> 00:37:17.949
states.
 

00:37:17.949 --> 00:37:20.039
But this isn't enough.
 

00:37:20.039 --> 00:37:21.289
That's not enough.
 

00:37:21.289 --> 00:37:24.179
We have to see really
what--here we go.

00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:25.320
This is by district.
 

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.900
This is an even better map of
it.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.998
You see that in the central
part of France here,

00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:33.557
priests refused to swear
allegiance, as in our village,

00:37:33.557 --> 00:37:35.469
to the French Revolution.
 

00:37:35.469 --> 00:37:38.110
But in Brittany and in Normandy
they did, massively.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.159
And in Alsace and Lorraine they
did, massively.

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:44.309
And in the north of France they
did, massively.

00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:45.750
So, okay, that's fine.
 

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:46.639
That's interesting.
 

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:48.739
So, what's going on here?
 

00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:50.289
What's going on?
 

00:37:50.289 --> 00:37:52.329
Why does it go like that?
 

00:37:52.329 --> 00:37:55.030
It's not just that people all
start getting together and say,

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.920
"Let's not swear to the
Revolution.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.260
Let's go have a drink of
Calvados instead."

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.559
More important changes are
going on.

00:38:02.559 --> 00:38:05.233
The word
"dechristianization,"

00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:08.320
which I also sent around,
has two meanings.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.858
One is the campaign against the
church by the revolutionaries to

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:17.989
melt down church bells,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:20.835
Dechristianization,
to change the calendar so that

00:38:20.835 --> 00:38:22.829
it's no longer January,
February, March,

00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:26.070
but it's Germinal,
Thermidor, Ventôse,

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:30.123
names that have to do with
winds and plants and the

00:38:30.123 --> 00:38:32.070
agricultural calendar.
 

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.543
That's part of
dechristianization,

00:38:33.543 --> 00:38:34.929
but that's not the big issue.
 

00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:39.675
The issue is that in these
areas in which the Revolution

00:38:39.675 --> 00:38:43.297
was accepted,
that old time religion was on

00:38:43.297 --> 00:38:44.420
the rope.
 

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.594
A friend of mine,
who was a great historian,

00:38:46.594 --> 00:38:49.175
called Michel Vovelle,
a long time ago did a book on

00:38:49.175 --> 00:38:50.340
dechristianization.
 

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.039
He looked at part of Provence.
 

00:38:52.039 --> 00:38:55.880
He looked at what people did
with their money and wills.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.858
He looked at the number of
people that became priests or

00:38:57.858 --> 00:38:58.110
nuns.
 

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:01.965
He looked at all sorts of
things--how many people baptized

00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:06.226
their children within the three
days you were supposed to in the

00:39:06.226 --> 00:39:07.579
Catholic Church.
 

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:10.903
What he found is that the
church, it wasn't the Revolution

00:39:10.903 --> 00:39:14.461
that destroyed the role of the
church or that reduced the role

00:39:14.461 --> 00:39:16.269
in ordinary people's lives.
 

00:39:16.269 --> 00:39:17.820
That had already happened.
 

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.335
It began after the
counter-reformation,

00:39:20.335 --> 00:39:22.719
that is, the Catholic
reformation.

00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:27.150
It was already well underway by
the 1730s and the 1740s.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:31.103
So, you can see political
behavior here reflecting these

00:39:31.103 --> 00:39:33.190
big-time, important trends.
 

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.429
Another way,
you could look at bishops'

00:39:35.429 --> 00:39:36.018
sermons.
 

00:39:36.018 --> 00:39:38.159
You look at how people named
their children.

00:39:38.159 --> 00:39:42.224
In the nineteenth century when
they stop naming their children

00:39:42.224 --> 00:39:44.489
after local saints,
for example.

00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:45.840
That's another good indication.
 

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.266
Or, you don't have many people
named Mary Magdeleine anymore in

00:39:49.266 --> 00:39:51.099
France,
or that kind of thing,

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:53.559
or in the Limousin named Marcel
or Léonard.

00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:55.699
These are names of local saints.
 

00:39:55.699 --> 00:39:59.940
Here again, the areas that were
counter-revolutionary,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:05.389
particularly up in Brittany and
Poitou and those regions there,

00:40:05.389 --> 00:40:09.800
the big story was these major
kinds of change.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:15.840
Ultimately, what I'm saying is
that religion was very likely to

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:21.784
be--arguably the most important
cause for people supporting or

00:40:21.784 --> 00:40:26.364
opposing the Revolution,
particularly the radical

00:40:26.364 --> 00:40:30.677
revolution as the Committee of
Public Safety sat around this

00:40:30.677 --> 00:40:33.309
big table and made big
decisions.

00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:35.820
What about the terror itself?
 

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.677
The interpretations of the
terror basically have gone like

00:40:38.677 --> 00:40:39.030
this.
 

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.686
One, it was sort of a
bloodletting by the very poor of

00:40:41.686 --> 00:40:42.840
their social betters.
 

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.059
Well, that's pretty much
nonsense.

00:40:45.059 --> 00:40:49.320
Secondly, that it's a reflex
action to save the republic.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.405
That makes more sense,
basically, and somebody in the

00:40:52.405 --> 00:40:55.431
1930s, before there was really
quantitative history,

00:40:55.431 --> 00:40:56.440
went to look.
 

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.728
A guy called Donald Greer said,
"Let's look at the victims

00:40:58.728 --> 00:40:59.539
of the terror."
 

00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:03.081
What he finds fits into where
we started, which is Maximilien

00:41:03.081 --> 00:41:06.210
Robespierre and his attempt to
save the Revolution.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:11.407
Most people in the terror,
there was a higher percentage

00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:15.092
of clergy and nobles executed,
because there were small

00:41:15.092 --> 00:41:17.838
percentages of clergy and
particularly nobles in the

00:41:17.838 --> 00:41:18.969
French population.
 

00:41:18.969 --> 00:41:22.840
But the vast majority of people
that either were given a prison

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.585
sentence,
or put their heads through the

00:41:25.585 --> 00:41:28.530
little window,
or were shot down,

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:35.690
executed as in Lyon,
were peasants and were artisans.

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:36.329
Why?
 

00:41:36.329 --> 00:41:38.137
Because there were more
peasants and artisans,

00:41:38.137 --> 00:41:40.148
above all peasants,
in France than any other social

00:41:40.148 --> 00:41:40.550
group.
 

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:43.958
That's good to know that,
but even more important,

00:41:43.958 --> 00:41:47.856
that the incidents of the
terror in the French Revolution

00:41:47.856 --> 00:41:50.639
come in areas that are battle
zones.

00:41:50.639 --> 00:41:53.969
They reflect the war,
the professional soldiers of

00:41:53.969 --> 00:41:58.047
monarchies fighting in the north
of France or fighting in the

00:41:58.047 --> 00:41:59.340
east of France.
 

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.500
They reflect the civil war.
 

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.869
A lot of people were put to
death or executed because they

00:42:07.869 --> 00:42:12.393
were fighting or participating
in supplying troops in battle

00:42:12.393 --> 00:42:13.159
zones.
 

00:42:13.159 --> 00:42:15.289
It's possible,
as my friend David Bell has

00:42:15.289 --> 00:42:18.304
argued, to say that parts of
this represent the first total

00:42:18.304 --> 00:42:18.719
war.
 

00:42:18.719 --> 00:42:21.019
I'll talk more about that when
we get to Napoleon.

00:42:21.019 --> 00:42:23.639
That's an interesting subject.
 

00:42:23.639 --> 00:42:29.943
Anyway, the terror was no sort
of organized bloodletting or

00:42:29.943 --> 00:42:33.530
spontaneous--it was that,
too,

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.380
despite the horrible
incidences,

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.315
despite Nantes,
and despite the massacres in

00:42:37.315 --> 00:42:41.594
the prisons,
and the September massacres in

00:42:41.594 --> 00:42:42.440
Paris.
 

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:49.501
There was a logic to this and
it had to do with trying to save

00:42:49.501 --> 00:42:51.469
the Revolution.
 

00:42:51.469 --> 00:42:59.760
Back to Robespierre--fumbling
through his papers here to get

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:07.630
to the appropriate point--they
tried to kill Robespierre,

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:11.309
of course,
as the terror gets more

00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:12.059
organized.
 

00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:14.492
He had a tendency,
as does Saint-Just and the

00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:16.226
other ones that say,
"If we just have one more

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:18.010
terror,
one more round of terror,

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.597
we'll finally save the
Revolution and all will be

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:21.300
well."
 

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.539
Lots of people in the assembly
looked around,

00:43:25.539 --> 00:43:30.262
reasonably enough,
and said, "We might be the

00:43:30.262 --> 00:43:32.480
next victims."
 

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.590
He became increasingly tired,
fatigued.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:42.806
He was never a dramatic
speaker, but it was as if he no

00:43:42.806 --> 00:43:46.030
longer wanted to be heard.
 

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.550
Two attempts on his life.
 

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:52.260
It finally got him to come to
the Jacobin Club and to go the

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.300
convention.
 

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:58.179
It's possible to argue that
death and revolutionary

00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:03.742
immortality was something that
he chose because of his own

00:44:03.742 --> 00:44:07.159
childhood guilt,
primal guilt,

00:44:07.159 --> 00:44:13.630
about his own father and the
death of his mother.

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:18.775
For someone who is ascetic and
withdrawn and preferred to be

00:44:18.775 --> 00:44:23.659
alone, he became increasingly
that way, unable to act.

00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:28.242
In 1794 in the month of
Thermidor, he became

00:44:28.242 --> 00:44:34.320
increasingly obsessed with his
own end, his own demise.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.418
He says, "If providence is
seen fit to snatch me from the

00:44:37.418 --> 00:44:40.760
hands of the assassins,
it was to ensure that I would

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:45.010
profitably employ the moments
that still remain to me."

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:49.981
Yet he could only,
as people howled at him from

00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:55.925
every conceivable angle in the
convention, murmur almost

00:44:55.925 --> 00:44:57.980
inarticulately.
 

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.498
When he mounts the rostrum on
the 8^(th) of Thermidor,

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:05.150
he gives an incredibly clumsy
speech for Robespierre.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.170
"I need to unburden my
heart.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.884
Everyone is in a league against
me and against those who hold

00:45:10.884 --> 00:45:12.989
the same principles that I hold.
 

00:45:12.989 --> 00:45:16.646
What friend of the nation would
wish to serve the nation when he

00:45:16.646 --> 00:45:18.679
no longer is allowed to serve
it?

00:45:18.679 --> 00:45:22.170
Why remain in an order of
things in which intrigue

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.449
eternally triumphs over truth?
 

00:45:24.449 --> 00:45:29.576
How may one bear the torture of
seeing this horrible succession

00:45:29.576 --> 00:45:31.230
of traitors?"
 

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.889
Perhaps he thought that his own
death would rouse the patriots,

00:45:34.889 --> 00:45:38.800
that is the Sans-Culottes in
the sections,

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:45.119
in the neighborhoods of
particularly central and eastern

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:46.039
Paris.
 

00:45:46.039 --> 00:45:50.279
Eleven times he is shouted
down, people shouting,

00:45:50.279 --> 00:45:53.369
"Down with the
tyrant."

00:45:53.369 --> 00:45:56.809
He says only,
"I ask for death."

00:45:56.809 --> 00:46:00.931
He leaves with his brother and
with Couthon and they go to the

00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:05.121
town hall, the same building is
not there, but it's in the same

00:46:05.121 --> 00:46:05.730
spot.
 

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.380
They wait upstairs.
 

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.695
Occasionally somebody would say
to him, "Why don't we go

00:46:10.695 --> 00:46:11.929
out and rouse up the sections?
 

00:46:11.929 --> 00:46:14.820
We are at great risk here."
 

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.199
And they just sit there.
 

00:46:16.199 --> 00:46:18.460
They sit in this room.
 

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.070
They sit there all night.
 

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:24.025
Finally, inevitably the troops
of the conspiracy run up the

00:46:24.025 --> 00:46:24.639
stairs.
 

00:46:24.639 --> 00:46:27.784
Couthon tries to escape in his
wheelchair and the wheelchair

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:29.969
bounces along with him down the
stairs.

00:46:29.969 --> 00:46:34.481
Robespierre either takes a
pistol and shoots himself in the

00:46:34.481 --> 00:46:36.659
jaw or is shot in the jaw.
 

00:46:36.659 --> 00:46:40.813
He spends time trying to rub
the blood, because he had this

00:46:40.813 --> 00:46:43.320
thing about clean,
white clothes.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.070
Until they know what to do with
him,

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.250
at one point he's laying on a
table and he points,

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:51.025
with Saint-Just,
they point to the declaration

00:46:51.025 --> 00:46:53.239
of the rights of man and of
citizen.

00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:54.949
They said, "We did
that."

00:46:54.949 --> 00:46:57.369
And indeed, they did.
 

00:46:57.369 --> 00:46:59.978
They find themselves taken to
the Conciergerie,

00:46:59.978 --> 00:47:02.132
that is the prison of the
Conciergerie,

00:47:02.132 --> 00:47:03.550
which is still there.
 

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:04.610
It's no longer a prison.
 

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.791
It's one of the three great
gothic halls in France,

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:10.530
along with Avignon and Mont
Saint-Michel.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.659
Of course, the trial is,
as he would have had it for the

00:47:14.659 --> 00:47:18.938
enemies of the Revolution,
is quick with no defense really

00:47:18.938 --> 00:47:19.989
permitted.
 

00:47:19.989 --> 00:47:24.766
The next morning they clip his
hair back, as one did,

00:47:24.766 --> 00:47:30.552
so that the long hair would not
in any way slow the blade of the

00:47:30.552 --> 00:47:31.929
guillotine.
 

00:47:31.929 --> 00:47:34.282
They take him,
put him in a wagon,

00:47:34.282 --> 00:47:37.206
and it takes,
because there were not major

00:47:37.206 --> 00:47:39.489
thoroughfares through Paris.
 

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:41.518
They take him to the Place de
la Revolution,

00:47:41.518 --> 00:47:45.838
which is now called the Place
la Concorde and they pass him by

00:47:45.838 --> 00:47:48.338
his house,
the house of the carpenters

00:47:48.338 --> 00:47:50.728
where he stayed,
where he had his happiest

00:47:50.728 --> 00:47:51.210
moments.
 

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:54.840
As he gets closer to the Place
de la Revolution,

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.856
where he's going to meet
Sanson--the executioners are

00:47:58.856 --> 00:48:01.869
all--it's a blood trade,
after all.

00:48:01.869 --> 00:48:04.219
Rather like butchers,
they all intermarry.

00:48:04.219 --> 00:48:06.610
They lived outside the walls of
cities.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.340
He's going to meet Sanson.
 

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.690
As he gets there,
he surely noticed that the

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.532
women were more and more
well-dressed and so were the

00:48:13.532 --> 00:48:13.969
men.
 

00:48:13.969 --> 00:48:16.965
As he gets there,
they're shrieking at him

00:48:16.965 --> 00:48:19.376
obscene terms,
"Down with the

00:48:19.376 --> 00:48:22.373
maximum,"
the maximum on the price of

00:48:22.373 --> 00:48:23.250
bread.
 

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:24.829
It's a very different crowd.
 

00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:28.570
Thousands of people came to
hear,

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.780
to lean forward to catch the
last words,

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.576
to see the head held above,
as they did with Louis XVI and

00:48:34.576 --> 00:48:36.130
with Marie Antoinette.
 

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.760
"Hold my head up.
 

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.967
It's a good one,"
said Danton--or something like

00:48:40.967 --> 00:48:44.728
that, when they'd executed him
on Saint-Just and Robespierre's

00:48:44.728 --> 00:48:45.840
orders before.
 

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.264
He meets Sanson with blood
pouring out of the bandage

00:48:50.264 --> 00:48:53.670
holding his jaw and having come
loose.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.746
Even at the end,
even as they shove his head

00:48:56.746 --> 00:49:00.469
into the little window,
blood is pouring from him.

00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:03.262
One doesn't know--we can't
imagine as he looked up as his

00:49:03.262 --> 00:49:04.010
head is down.
 

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:06.903
He looks up and he sees the
throngs who have paid a fine

00:49:06.903 --> 00:49:10.070
price to sit on the roofs,
like living across from Wrigley

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.679
Field or something like that,
to see the death of the

00:49:13.679 --> 00:49:17.215
tyrant-tyrant,
or the person who saved the

00:49:17.215 --> 00:49:19.280
Revolution,
or one of them.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.050
It's very hard to say.
 

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:23.599
It depends on your view.
 

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:27.650
But certainly,
one can imagine that

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:33.250
Robespierre breathed a breath of
relaxation,

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:38.909
of leaving an existence that
had tortured him and of gaining

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:42.938
for the Revolution--he
hoped--revolutionary

00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:45.800
immortality,
but also perhaps,

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.889
one can argue,
paying a debt,

00:49:47.889 --> 00:49:48.668
a debt to his family that
stemmed from the death of his

00:49:48.668 --> 00:49:49.159
own mother long before in Arras.
 

00:49:49.159 --> 00:49:55.710
See you on Wednesday.

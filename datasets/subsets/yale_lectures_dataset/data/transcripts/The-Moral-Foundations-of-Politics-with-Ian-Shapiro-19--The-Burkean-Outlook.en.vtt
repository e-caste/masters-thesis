00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.899
Prof: So this morning
we're going to start talking

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.830
about Edmund Burke and the
anti-Enlightenment.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.346
And one prefatory note is that
when thinking about political

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:18.955
theory as opposed to everyday
political argument I think it's

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:25.220
very important not to get hung
up on labels such as left wing,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.480
or right wing,
or liberal, or conservative.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.556
And I think the occasion of
beginning to speak about Burke

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:36.940
is a good moment to make this
point.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.000
After all, I think it'd be fair
to say that before you walked

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.723
into this course if you had
looked down the syllabus and

00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:48.248
somebody had said,
"Who is the most radical

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.420
thinker on this syllabus?"
 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.770
most of you would have picked
out Marx.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.786
But as we've seen,
Marx is actually a footnote to

00:00:57.786 --> 00:00:59.460
the Enlightenment.
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.703
Marx is not,
he's not somebody who engages

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:07.370
in a radical departure from the
ideas that were developed by

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.881
Locke and the other thinkers
that shaped the main ideas of

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:13.780
the Enlightenment.
 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.644
Burke, on the other hand,
is generally thought of as a

00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:19.575
conservative politically,
and indeed he was a

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:23.703
conservative politically,
but philosophically he's a much

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:26.159
more radical thinker than Marx
was.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.602
He is somebody who really goes
to the root of accepted

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:39.500
assumptions in his critical
questioning.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.897
Burke completely rejects the
Enlightenment project as I have

00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:47.459
described it to you today.
 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.989
Let me say a little bit about
who he was.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:56.044
He was born in 1829,
so that makes him,

00:01:56.044 --> 00:01:59.390
I mean 1729,
sorry.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.950
I gave him a hundred years
there.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.650
He was born in 1729,
a quarter of a century after

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.030
Locke died,
and the main work for which he

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.986
is most known,
his Reflections on the

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:16.406
Revolution in France,
was published in 1790 almost

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:22.233
exactly a century after,
actually more like 110 years

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:26.199
after Locke's Second
Treatise.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.580
Well, I should say it was
published a hundred years after,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.008
but it was written a 110 years
after because we now know that

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:39.440
Locke wrote The Second
Treatise in the early 1680s.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.010
But what motivated Burke to
write his reflections on the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.772
French Revolution was the
appalling carnage that

00:02:49.772 --> 00:02:54.940
eventually resulted from the
French Revolution.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.938
The French Revolution was not
planned as a revolution.

00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:06.400
It was really street riots that
escalated in Paris,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.859
but escalated to the point of
the complete destruction of the

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.251
whole society,
the inauguration of a massive

00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:18.710
terror,
which appalled Burke.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.462
And so he wrote this,
what started out as a pamphlet,

00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:28.583
but became this very famous
book on the Reflections on

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:34.319
the Revolution in France
, and that becomes a

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.940
basis of Burke's outlook.
 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.590
He wasn't a professional
scholar or academic.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.720
He was actually a public person.
 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.836
He would eventually become a
Member of Parliament and has

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:50.954
some things to say about
democratic representation that I

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:55.440
will come back to when we get to
the theory of democracy.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.867
But at the time he wrote the
Reflections on the Revolution

00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:02.102
in France,
which is what I had you read

00:04:02.102 --> 00:04:06.430
excerpts from today,
he was mainly preoccupied with

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.277
what had happened,
what had transpired across the

00:04:12.277 --> 00:04:14.628
Channel in 1789.
 

00:04:14.628 --> 00:04:20.295
And he was, in particular,
concerned to establish against

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:24.716
people like Richard Price,
who's one of the people who he

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:28.797
engages there,
that 1789 was in any sense a

00:04:28.797 --> 00:04:33.259
logical follow-on of 1688 in
England;

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.928
1688, of course,
when we had the revolution in

00:04:37.928 --> 00:04:41.694
England,
the glorious revolution of 1688

00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:44.829
when William was put on the
throne,

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:49.920
which Locke defended,
but from Burke's point of view

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.711
that was a minor palace affair
not a fundamental or radical

00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:57.209
revolution.
 

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:01.980
And in this sense Locke's
view--I'm sorry,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.040
Burke's view of the English
Revolution,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.675
for those of you who are
historians here you might be

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:11.173
interested to know,
is very much at odds with the

00:05:11.173 --> 00:05:15.855
big new book called 1688
just recently published by

00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:20.129
Professor Pincus in the history
department here,

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:25.879
a very interesting book which
argues that 1688 was a much more

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:31.819
radical break with the past than
people thought at the time,

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:36.257
and certainly than Burke
thought because Burke thought

00:05:36.257 --> 00:05:41.199
that 1688 was not a radical
break with the past whereas 1789

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.220
in France was a radical break
with the past.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.976
And I think that another thing
to say before we get into the

00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:53.120
particulars of Burke's view is
that,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.790
unlike everybody else you've
read in this course,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.009
Burke really does not have a
theory of politics.

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.300
He does not have a set of
premises that you can lay out,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.045
conclusions to which he wants
to get and then change of

00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:16.069
reasoning that get him from A to
B from the premises to the

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:17.110
conclusion.
 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.629
There is no theory of politics
in Burke.

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:26.250
With Kant we talk about
universalizability.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.204
Locke we talk about this
commitment to principles of

00:06:31.204 --> 00:06:33.440
scientific certainty.
 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.704
Burke has, rather than a
theory, he has an attitude or a

00:06:38.704 --> 00:06:43.982
disposition,
an outlook, and that outlook is

00:06:43.982 --> 00:06:51.172
informed first and foremost by
extreme distrust not only of

00:06:51.172 --> 00:06:55.392
science,
but of anybody who claims to

00:06:55.392 --> 00:06:58.029
have scientific knowledge.
 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:06.132
He thinks that human society is
way too complicated for us ever

00:07:06.132 --> 00:07:11.360
to get completely to the bottom
of it.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.910
That we are kind of carried
along on a wave of very

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.348
complicated history that we
understand only dimly,

00:07:22.348 --> 00:07:28.009
if at all, and that that's not
going to change.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:33.819
The human condition is a
condition first and foremost,

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:36.670
of fumbling in the dark.
 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.759
He says, just to give you a
flavor of this),

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.259
"The science of
constituting a commonwealth,

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:44.375
or renovating it,
or reforming it,

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:47.831
is,
like every other experimental

00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:52.629
science,
not to be taught a priori."

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:57.050
So here you can see a complete
resistance to the logical

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.713
reasoning that drove Hobbes and
Locke in thinking about the

00:08:01.713 --> 00:08:06.375
structure of mathematics and a
system of axioms of the sort

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:09.269
Bentham tried to come up with.
 

00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:12.862
"No,"
says Burke, "Nor is it a

00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:17.269
short experience that can
instruct us in that practical

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:20.062
science;
because the real effects of

00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:22.750
moral causes are not always
immediate,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.793
but that which in the first
instance is prejudicial may be

00:08:26.793 --> 00:08:29.420
excellent in its remoter
operation;

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.010
(so when we think we see
something bad it might be having

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.346
a good effect) and its
excellence may arise even from

00:08:36.346 --> 00:08:39.490
the ill effects it produces in
the beginning.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:44.062
The reverse also happens;
and very plausible schemes,

00:08:44.062 --> 00:08:46.945
with very pleasing
commencements,

00:08:46.945 --> 00:08:51.450
have often shameful and
lamentable conclusions.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.926
In states there are often some
obscure and almost latent

00:08:55.926 --> 00:08:58.533
causes,
things which appear at first

00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:02.421
view of little moment,
on which a very great part of

00:09:02.421 --> 00:09:07.528
its prosperity or adversity may
most essentially depend."

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:18.990
So the world is fundamentally
mysterious and murky.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.210
And things that look good might
have bad consequences.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.668
Things that look bad might have
good consequences.

00:09:26.668 --> 00:09:32.505
The effects of our actions are
going to be realized in the

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:38.240
distant future in ways that we
can't possibly imagine.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:48.585
And so that being the case the
most important characteristic of

00:09:48.585 --> 00:09:54.759
thinking about politics is
caution.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:56.350
We should be cautioned.
 

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.879
"The science of government
being,

00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:01.793
therefore, so practical in
itself, and intended for such

00:10:01.793 --> 00:10:04.797
practical purposes,
a matter which requires

00:10:04.797 --> 00:10:08.466
experience,
and even more experience than

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:12.408
any person can gain in his whole
life,

00:10:12.408 --> 00:10:15.889
however sagacious and observing
he may be,

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:20.539
it is with infinite caution
that any man ought to venture

00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:24.941
upon pulling down an edifice
which has answered in any

00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:30.090
tolerable degree for ages the
common purposes of society,

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.538
or on building it up again
without having models and

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:41.200
patterns of approved utility
before his eyes."

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.779
So what they did in the French
Revolution was the antithesis of

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:51.395
what Burke recommends,
because they swept everything

00:10:51.395 --> 00:10:55.639
away and decided to build again
tabula rasa.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:11:00.341
Burke is deeply suspicious of
all attempts to do that and he

00:11:00.341 --> 00:11:05.283
thinks they'll end in disaster
because the people who undertake

00:11:05.283 --> 00:11:08.710
them will not know what they're
doing,

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.735
and even more dangerous,
they're not smart enough to

00:11:11.735 --> 00:11:13.220
know how dumb they are.
 

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.065
They're not smart enough to
realize that they really do not

00:11:17.065 --> 00:11:18.788
know what they're doing.
 

00:11:18.788 --> 00:11:22.674
They're not smart enough to
understand that they will

00:11:22.674 --> 00:11:26.860
unleash forces which they will
not be able to control.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.489
So Burke is,
in that sense,

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:35.861
a conservative who thinks about
social change in a very cautious

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:38.288
and incremental way.
 

00:11:38.288 --> 00:11:42.139
He's not a reactionary in the
sense of being someone who's

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:43.759
opposed to all change.
 

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:47.629
He's a conservative.
 

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:51.464
I think one of the nice
definitions of conservatism in

00:11:51.464 --> 00:11:55.732
Burke's sense was actually put
forward by Sir Robert Peel in

00:11:55.732 --> 00:11:58.700
the nineteenth century when he
said--

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.799
he defined conservatism as,
"Changing what you have to

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:05.769
in order to conserve what you
can."

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:10.421
Changing what you have to in
order to conserve what you can,

00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:15.072
as distinct from a reactionary
view which would be just flat

00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:17.360
resistance to all change.
 

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.456
Now, of course,
this idea of conservatism as

00:12:21.456 --> 00:12:26.697
valuing tradition is very
different from the libertarian

00:12:26.697 --> 00:12:32.510
conservatism of Robert Nozick
that we looked at earlier in the

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.750
course.
 

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:39.220
The libertarian conservatism of
Robert Nozick is anti-statist,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.967
anti-government,
and resistance to authority

00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:47.788
being imposed on you,
hence the notion of libertarian

00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:49.019
conservatism.
 

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:52.740
Burke is a traditionalist
conservative.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:13:00.460
He thinks that tradition is the
core of human experience,

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.754
and he thinks whatever wisdom
we have about politics is

00:13:04.754 --> 00:13:08.889
embedded in the traditions that
we have inherited.

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:11.243
"They have served us over
centuries,"

00:13:11.243 --> 00:13:14.570
this is his view writing at the
end of the eighteenth century,

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.509
"they have served us for
centuries.

00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:19.240
They have evolved in a glacial
way."

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.100
As I said, people make
accommodations to change,

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.788
but only in order to conserve
the inherited system of norms,

00:13:28.788 --> 00:13:33.094
practices and beliefs in
institutions that we reproduce

00:13:33.094 --> 00:13:34.370
going forward.
 

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.610
So that's the sense in which
it's a conservative tradition;

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.429
to conserve,
the basic meaning of the word

00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:43.759
conserve, conservative.
 

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:49.332
And so science is a really bad
idea when applied to political

00:13:49.332 --> 00:13:54.255
and social arrangements because
there isn't scientific

00:13:54.255 --> 00:13:58.936
knowledge,
and anybody who claims to have

00:13:58.936 --> 00:14:02.990
it is either a charlatan or a
fool,

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.720
perhaps both.
 

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.946
And so, as I said,
he doesn't have a theory

00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:13.325
because he's skeptical of the
very possibility of having a

00:14:13.325 --> 00:14:14.168
theory.
 

00:14:14.168 --> 00:14:20.288
He thinks we should,
as Clint Eastwood says--

00:14:20.288 --> 00:14:21.908
I've forgotten in which movie
it is,

00:14:21.908 --> 00:14:23.600
I think A Fistful of
Dollars,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.519
maybe--"A man's got to
know his limitations.

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:30.548
Are you feeling lucky?"
 

00:14:30.548 --> 00:14:36.062
A man's got to know his
limitations, Burke thinks that

00:14:36.062 --> 00:14:37.308
in spades.
 

00:14:37.308 --> 00:14:43.513
He thinks we have to understand
that our grasp of the human

00:14:43.513 --> 00:14:49.928
condition is very limited and
it's going to stay that way.

00:14:49.928 --> 00:14:54.979
So, on the first of our two
prongs of the Enlightenment

00:14:54.979 --> 00:14:59.000
endeavor he's completely out of
sympathy.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.428
Now what about the second?
 

00:15:00.428 --> 00:15:05.114
What about the commitment to
this idea of the importance of

00:15:05.114 --> 00:15:06.730
individual rights?
 

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.751
We saw how this developed
initially in Locke's formulation

00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:17.216
in a theological way when Locke
argued that God created us with

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:22.678
the capacity to behave in a God
like fashion in the world.

00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:27.833
Each individual is the bearer
of the capacity to create

00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:32.798
things, and therefore have
rights over his or her own

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.039
creation.
 

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:36.370
In Locke's view we're all equal.
 

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.360
We're equal in God's sight.
 

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.965
He creates us all equally,
and we're all also equal in the

00:15:43.965 --> 00:15:46.636
sense,
very important for Locke,

00:15:46.636 --> 00:15:50.783
that no earthly power has the
authority to tell us what the

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.070
scripture says.
 

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.658
Each person must do it for
himself,

00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:59.494
and when they disagree they
have to either find a mechanism

00:15:59.494 --> 00:16:03.607
to manage their disagreement,
or if they can't,

00:16:03.607 --> 00:16:08.308
look for their reward in the
next life.

00:16:08.308 --> 00:16:13.028
But basically each individual
is sovereign over themselves.

00:16:13.028 --> 00:16:16.567
And that's where modern
doctrines of individual rights

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:17.370
come from.
 

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:22.793
We saw how that played out with
the workmanship ideal,

00:16:22.793 --> 00:16:28.525
Mill's harm principle all the
way down through Nozick and

00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:29.549
Rawls.
 

00:16:29.549 --> 00:16:33.307
Bentham has, I'm sorry;
Burke has a very,

00:16:33.307 --> 00:16:38.538
very different view of the idea
of rights.

00:16:38.538 --> 00:16:41.340
They're first of all,
they are inherited.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.014
They're not the product of
reason or any contrived

00:16:46.014 --> 00:16:48.590
theoretical formulations.
 

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.408
They're inherited.
 

00:16:50.408 --> 00:16:55.441
"You will observe that
from Revolution Society to the

00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:59.677
Magna Carta it has been the
uniform policy of our

00:16:59.677 --> 00:17:04.972
constitution to claim and assert
our liberties as an entailed

00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:09.740
inheritance derived to us from
our forefathers,

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.680
and to be transmitted to
posterity--

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.199
as an estate specially
belonging to the people of this

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:19.762
kingdom,
without any reference whatever

00:17:19.762 --> 00:17:23.730
to any other more general or
prior right.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.092
By this means our constitution
preserves a unity in so great a

00:17:28.092 --> 00:17:29.880
diversity of its parts.
 

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.150
We have an inheritable crown,
an inheritable peerage,

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.788
and a House of Commons and a
people inheriting privileges,

00:17:36.788 --> 00:17:43.048
franchises, and liberties from
a long line of ancestors."

00:17:43.048 --> 00:17:48.029
So what we think of when we
talk about rights for Burke,

00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:51.338
first of all,
they're not human rights or

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:56.932
natural rights for him,
they are the rights of

00:17:56.932 --> 00:17:58.808
Englishmen.
 

00:17:58.808 --> 00:18:00.160
They are the rights of
Englishmen;

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.740
they are particular rights.
 

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.368
They're the result of a
particular tradition.

00:18:05.368 --> 00:18:09.103
The idea that there could be
universal rights doesn't make

00:18:09.103 --> 00:18:09.890
any sense.
 

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:15.226
It's not an intelligible
question, as far as Burke is

00:18:15.226 --> 00:18:19.778
concerned,
to assay what Rawls would say,

00:18:19.778 --> 00:18:26.000
what rights would we create for
all people in some abstract

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.180
setting?
 

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.670
It doesn't make any sense to
him.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.058
So it's the rights of
Englishmen.

00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:34.800
And indeed, when Burke was
sympathetic to the American

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.845
Revolution,
not the French Revolution,

00:18:37.845 --> 00:18:42.272
it was because he thought that
the rights of the American

00:18:42.272 --> 00:18:46.779
colonists as Englishmen were
being violated by the English

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:47.650
Crown.
 

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.740
And he was also sympathetic to
claims for home rule for

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.890
Ireland, again,
on the same sort of basis.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:02.602
But it's this entailed
inheritance, what we have been

00:19:02.602 --> 00:19:08.534
born into as a system of rights
and obligations that we

00:19:08.534 --> 00:19:11.828
reproduce into the future.
 

00:19:11.828 --> 00:19:17.118
And those rights,
above all, are limited.

00:19:17.118 --> 00:19:21.636
Again, just as our knowledge of
the world is limited so our

00:19:21.636 --> 00:19:25.220
rights, in the normative sense,
are limited.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.015
"Government is a
contrivance of human wisdom to

00:19:29.015 --> 00:19:30.950
provide for human wants.
 

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.960
Men have a right that these
wants should be provided for by

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.170
this wisdom.
 

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:42.534
Among these wants is to be
reckoned the want out of civil

00:19:42.534 --> 00:19:46.749
society, of a sufficient
restraint upon their

00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:48.568
passions."
 

00:19:48.568 --> 00:19:52.777
We have a right to be
restrained, a very different

00:19:52.777 --> 00:19:57.414
notion than a right to create
things over which we have

00:19:57.414 --> 00:20:00.848
authority, a right to be
restrained.

00:20:00.848 --> 00:20:04.292
"Society requires not only
that the passions of individuals

00:20:04.292 --> 00:20:08.006
should be subjected,
but that even in the mass and

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:10.385
body,
as well as in the individuals,

00:20:10.385 --> 00:20:13.720
the inclinations of men should
frequently be thwarted,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:19.084
their will controlled,
and their passions brought into

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:20.400
subjection.
 

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.140
This can only be done by a
power out of themselves,

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.200
and not, in the exercise of its
function,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:33.272
subject to that will and to
those passions which it is its

00:20:33.272 --> 00:20:36.470
office to bridle and subdue.
 

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:43.596
In this sense the restraints on
men, as well as their liberties,

00:20:43.596 --> 00:20:48.798
are to be reckoned among their
rights."

00:20:48.798 --> 00:20:53.006
The restraints on men,
as well as their liberties,

00:20:53.006 --> 00:20:56.440
are to be reckoned among their
rights.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.248
"But as the liberties and
the restrictions vary with times

00:21:00.248 --> 00:21:03.750
and circumstances and admit to
infinite modifications,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:08.730
they cannot be settled upon an
abstract rule (take that John

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.663
Rawls);
and nothing is so foolish as to

00:21:12.663 --> 00:21:16.759
discuss them upon that
principle."

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:20.680
So we have a right to be
restrained.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.278
We have a right,
most importantly,

00:21:23.278 --> 00:21:26.700
that others are going to be
restrained,

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.478
and that our passion should be
controlled is something that he

00:21:32.478 --> 00:21:38.162
insists is an important part of
what we should think of under

00:21:38.162 --> 00:21:44.318
the general heading of what it
is that people have rights to.

00:21:44.318 --> 00:21:46.818
"One of the first motives
to civil society,

00:21:46.818 --> 00:21:49.868
and which becomes one of its
fundamental rules,

00:21:49.868 --> 00:21:53.818
is that no man should be the
judge in his own cause.

00:21:53.818 --> 00:21:59.035
By this each person has at once
divested himself of the first

00:21:59.035 --> 00:22:02.598
fundamental right of
uncovenanted man,

00:22:02.598 --> 00:22:06.138
that is, to judge for himself
and to assert his own

00:22:06.138 --> 00:22:07.130
cause."
 

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.769
That's not that different from
Locke, that first part.

00:22:10.769 --> 00:22:14.134
After all, Locke talks about
the state of nature as being

00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:17.798
exactly a state in which we get
to judge in our own cause,

00:22:17.798 --> 00:22:21.440
but for Locke we give it up in
a conditional way.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.546
We never lose the right to
revolution if society doesn't

00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:30.250
protect us, and that's what he
thought was triggered in 1688.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.558
Burke says no.
 

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:35.108
"He advocates all right to
be his own governor.

00:22:35.108 --> 00:22:37.163
He inclusively,
in a great measure,

00:22:37.163 --> 00:22:39.218
abandons the right of
self-defense,

00:22:39.218 --> 00:22:40.910
the first law of nature.
 

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:47.077
Men cannot enjoy the rights of
an uncivil and of a civil state

00:22:47.077 --> 00:22:48.190
together.
 

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.760
That he may obtain justice,
he gives up his right of

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.230
determining what it is in points
the most essential to him.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:04.750
That he may secure some liberty;
he makes a surrender in trust

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.930
of the whole of it."
 

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:14.834
This, to some extent,
has a Hobbesian flavor that

00:23:14.834 --> 00:23:18.181
Hobbes says,
"If we don't have law

00:23:18.181 --> 00:23:21.632
we'll have civil war,
and so we have to give up

00:23:21.632 --> 00:23:24.009
freedom to authority."
 

00:23:24.009 --> 00:23:28.259
The difference is even in
Hobbes's formulation there's

00:23:28.259 --> 00:23:33.231
ultimately the recognition that
if society does not provide you

00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:37.804
with protection you have a
reasonable basis for resistance

00:23:37.804 --> 00:23:40.210
and for overthrowing it.
 

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:44.926
But in Locke's case,
I mean, in Burke's case he

00:23:44.926 --> 00:23:48.618
doesn't want to concede even
that.

00:23:48.618 --> 00:23:52.890
Because we cannot,
once we've made the transition

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.450
into civil society,
we cannot go back.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.588
There is no turning back.
 

00:23:58.588 --> 00:24:04.256
We are part and parcel of this
system of entailed inheritances

00:24:04.256 --> 00:24:09.828
and that is the human condition
all the way to the bottom.

00:24:09.828 --> 00:24:15.122
He doesn't reject completely
the metaphor of the social

00:24:15.122 --> 00:24:19.140
contract, but he makes it
indissoluble.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:26.058
He says, "Society is
indeed a contract.

00:24:26.058 --> 00:24:29.939
Subordinate contracts for
objects of mere occasional

00:24:29.939 --> 00:24:34.503
interest may be dissolved at
pleasure (if I make an agreement

00:24:34.503 --> 00:24:38.460
with you to do something we can
agree to dissolve our

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.616
agreement)--
but the state ought not to be

00:24:41.616 --> 00:24:45.255
considered as nothing better
than a partnership agreement in

00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:48.671
a trade of pepper and coffee,
calico or tobacco,

00:24:48.671 --> 00:24:53.045
or some other such low concern
to be taken up for a little

00:24:53.045 --> 00:24:57.176
temporary interest,
and to be dissolved by the

00:24:57.176 --> 00:24:59.180
fancy of the parties.
 

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.053
It is to be looked on with
other reverence (the

00:25:03.053 --> 00:25:06.843
"it"
here is the state) - because it

00:25:06.843 --> 00:25:11.810
is not a partnership in things
subservient only to the gross

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:17.031
animal existence of a temporary
and perishable nature - it is a

00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:22.118
partnership in all science;
a partnership in all art;

00:25:22.118 --> 00:25:27.970
a partnership in every virtue,
and in all perfection."

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.645
"As the ends of such a
partnership cannot be obtained

00:25:31.645 --> 00:25:35.401
in many generations,
it becomes a partnership (now

00:25:35.401 --> 00:25:39.943
this is the most famous sentence
Burke ever wrote) not only

00:25:39.943 --> 00:25:44.482
between those who are living,
but between those who are

00:25:44.482 --> 00:25:49.338
living, those who are dead,
and those who are yet to be

00:25:49.338 --> 00:25:50.490
born."
 

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.192
A very different idea of the
social contract,

00:25:53.192 --> 00:25:56.817
partnership between those who
are living, those who are dead

00:25:56.817 --> 00:25:59.088
and those who are yet to be
born.

00:25:59.088 --> 00:26:03.491
"Each contract of each
particular state is but a clause

00:26:03.491 --> 00:26:07.970
in the general primeval contract
of eternal society."

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.868
So, the "law is not
subject to the will of those

00:26:12.868 --> 00:26:17.108
(this is a flat rejection of
workmanship),

00:26:17.108 --> 00:26:21.298
who by an obligation above
them, and infinitely superior,

00:26:21.298 --> 00:26:24.759
are bound to submit their will
to that law.

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:29.568
The municipal corporations of
that universal kingdom are not

00:26:29.568 --> 00:26:32.828
morally at liberty at their
pleasure,

00:26:32.828 --> 00:26:36.328
and on the speculations of a
contingent improvement,

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:40.219
wholly to separate and set
asunder the bonds of their

00:26:40.219 --> 00:26:44.191
subordinate community,
and to dissolve it into an

00:26:44.191 --> 00:26:48.625
unsocial,
uncivil, unconnected chaos of

00:26:48.625 --> 00:26:52.170
elementary principles."
 

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:58.084
So one way of just driving home
the radical break here between

00:26:58.084 --> 00:27:03.707
his thought and the social
contract theorists is to mention

00:27:03.707 --> 00:27:09.038
that one of the standard
criticisms that often gets made

00:27:09.038 --> 00:27:14.815
of social contract theory is,
well, even if there was a

00:27:14.815 --> 00:27:18.233
social contact,
you know, some people think of

00:27:18.233 --> 00:27:21.963
the adoption of the American
Constitution as a kind of social

00:27:21.963 --> 00:27:22.710
contract.
 

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.028
After all it was ratified by
the states.

00:27:26.028 --> 00:27:30.039
Actually, the Articles of
Confederation had said it had to

00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:34.021
be unanimously ratified,
and they couldn't get that,

00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:37.261
so they changed it to
three-quarters of the

00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:38.960
confederacy states.
 

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.968
Still, there was an agreement
of some sort,

00:27:41.968 --> 00:27:46.049
and it was ratified and so on,
but people have often said,

00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:47.769
"Well, so what?
 

00:27:47.769 --> 00:27:51.162
So those people in the
eighteenth century made an

00:27:51.162 --> 00:27:52.009
agreement.
 

00:27:52.009 --> 00:27:53.410
I didn't.
 

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.910
What has it got to do with me?
 

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.788
Why should it be binding on
subsequent generations?"

00:27:58.788 --> 00:28:02.502
And that's often been a
critique of the idea of the

00:28:02.502 --> 00:28:03.838
social contract.
 

00:28:03.838 --> 00:28:07.880
Burke turns that reasoning on
its head.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.454
He says, "Once we see that
this social contract is

00:28:12.454 --> 00:28:15.759
multi-generational between the
dead,

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:19.328
the living, and those who are
yet to be born,

00:28:19.328 --> 00:28:23.180
who are you (any given
individual),

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.950
who are you to think that you
can upend it?

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:35.176
What gives you the right to
pull the rug out from under this

00:28:35.176 --> 00:28:40.200
centuries-old evolving social
contract?

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.998
What gives you the right to
take it away from those who

00:28:44.998 --> 00:28:50.329
haven't even been born who are
part of this (he even uses the

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:53.972
word eternal) eternally
reproducing social

00:28:53.972 --> 00:28:55.838
contract."
 

00:28:55.838 --> 00:28:59.118
So it's a sort of mirror image
of the critique which says,

00:28:59.118 --> 00:29:02.340
"Well, we never made it so
why should we be bound by

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.088
it?"
 

00:29:03.088 --> 00:29:07.009
He says, "It preexisted
you,

00:29:07.009 --> 00:29:10.567
and you're going to predecease
it, and you don't have the

00:29:10.567 --> 00:29:13.769
right,
you don't have the authority to

00:29:13.769 --> 00:29:18.605
undermine it because any rights
you think you have are the

00:29:18.605 --> 00:29:21.828
product of this evolving
contract,

00:29:21.828 --> 00:29:23.980
they're contained within
it."

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.045
So society is not subordinate
to the individual,

00:29:28.045 --> 00:29:33.060
which is the most rock-bottom
commitment of the workmanship

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.838
idea.
 

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:39.325
On the contrary,
the individual is subordinate

00:29:39.325 --> 00:29:40.910
to society.
 

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.180
Obligations come before rights.
 

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:50.060
We only get rights as a
consequence of the social

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:55.818
arrangements that give us our
duties as well.

00:29:55.818 --> 00:30:01.227
So whereas the Enlightenment
tradition makes the individual

00:30:01.227 --> 00:30:05.890
agent the sort of moral center
of the universe,

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:13.679
this god-like individual
creating things over which she

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:19.450
or he has absolute sovereign
control,

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.903
is replaced by the exact mirror
image of the idea of an

00:30:23.903 --> 00:30:28.358
individual as subordinate to
inherited communities,

00:30:28.358 --> 00:30:31.990
traditions, social
arrangements,

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:38.786
and political institutions to
which he or she is ultimately

00:30:38.786 --> 00:30:40.308
beholden.
 

00:30:40.308 --> 00:30:44.623
If there was a pre-collective
condition it's of no relevance

00:30:44.623 --> 00:30:47.838
to us now because we can't go
back to it,

00:30:47.838 --> 00:30:52.105
and any attempt to try,
look across the English Channel

00:30:52.105 --> 00:30:54.868
and see what you're going to
get.

00:30:54.868 --> 00:31:00.009
That is the Burkean outlook in
a nutshell, and it is,

00:31:00.009 --> 00:31:05.940
as I said, the most fundamental
critique of the Enlightenment

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.509
it's possible to make.
 

00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:13.778
And even though the
Enlightenment tradition,

00:31:13.778 --> 00:31:21.353
as we have studied it here,
was unfolding in the

00:31:21.353 --> 00:31:25.106
seventeenth,
eighteenth, nineteenth and

00:31:25.106 --> 00:31:29.189
twentieth centuries,
this anti-Enlightenment

00:31:29.189 --> 00:31:34.318
undertow has always been there
as well.

00:31:34.318 --> 00:31:37.068
Not to make the metaphor do too
much work,

00:31:37.068 --> 00:31:41.711
but you can really think of
every wave of advancement in

00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:46.861
Enlightenment thinking washing
down the beach and producing an

00:31:46.861 --> 00:31:51.420
undertow of resistance and
resentment against it,

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.442
both philosophically,
and I'm going to start talking

00:31:55.442 --> 00:31:58.753
in a minute about
twentieth-century Burkean

00:31:58.753 --> 00:32:02.880
figures,
but also politically.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.430
One story about the rise of
fundamentalism,

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.785
and jihadism,
and ethnic separatism is this

00:32:11.785 --> 00:32:17.593
is all part of the political
undertow against the current

00:32:17.593 --> 00:32:23.920
form that the Enlightenment
political project is taking,

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.000
which is globalization,
homogenization,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.200
this sort of McDonald's effect
on the world,

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.898
produces this backlash against
globalization where people

00:32:34.898 --> 00:32:38.338
affirm primordial-looking
attachments,

00:32:38.338 --> 00:32:42.788
even though there's probably no
such thing as a genuinely

00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:45.367
primordial one,
separatists,

00:32:45.367 --> 00:32:49.098
partial affiliations and
allegiances,

00:32:49.098 --> 00:32:54.205
connections to doctrines which
deny the scientific and rational

00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:56.759
project of the Enlightenment.
 

00:32:56.759 --> 00:33:00.426
And so, just as globalization
has been advancing we've seen a

00:33:00.426 --> 00:33:05.058
resurgence of separatists,
religious fundamentalists,

00:33:05.058 --> 00:33:08.608
nationalists,
and other kinds of identities.

00:33:08.608 --> 00:33:10.790
Quite the opposite,
for example,

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.548
of what Marx predicted.
 

00:33:12.548 --> 00:33:20.262
Marx predicted that things like
nationalism, sectarian

00:33:20.262 --> 00:33:24.630
identifications,
would go away,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.250
and Lenin too.
 

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:31.880
They thought that as the
principles of capitalism defused

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.179
themselves throughout the world,
things like national

00:33:36.179 --> 00:33:38.660
attachments would go away.
 

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.722
And indeed on the eve of the
First World War there was the

00:33:42.722 --> 00:33:46.929
Second Communist International
where they basically came out

00:33:46.929 --> 00:33:49.710
and said to the workers of
Europe,

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.269
"Don't get involved in
this national war.

00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:54.308
It's not in your interest.
 

00:33:54.308 --> 00:33:58.345
You have a common class
interest across nations against

00:33:58.345 --> 00:34:01.782
the interest of employers across
nations,"

00:34:01.782 --> 00:34:05.670
and of course this fell on
completely deaf ears.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:09.503
In 1916 the Second
International pretty much

00:34:09.503 --> 00:34:10.929
disintegrated.
 

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:15.233
And, in fact,
one of the big paradoxes of the

00:34:15.233 --> 00:34:20.710
twentieth century has been the
persistence of things like

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:26.481
nationalism through the first
two world wars and then in the

00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:30.590
last part of the twentieth
century,

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:34.150
this resurgence of religious
and other forms of

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:38.795
traditionalist attachment that
are fundamentally antithetical

00:34:38.795 --> 00:34:41.349
to the Enlightenment project.
 

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:44.780
So the Enlightenment has always
produced reaction,

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:49.260
undertow, rejection,
often from the people who don't

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.909
benefit from it,
and it's one of the ways in

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:57.306
which I think the proponents of
the Enlightenment have always

00:34:57.306 --> 00:34:59.360
been politically na�ve.
 

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.824
They've always thought that as
modernization and Enlightenment

00:35:03.824 --> 00:35:08.215
diffuses itself throughout the
world these kinds of primitive

00:35:08.215 --> 00:35:10.119
thinking will go away.
 

00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:12.530
Well, it turns out that they
don't,

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:17.958
and so one of the big tasks of
political science at the present

00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:21.199
time is to try and understand
why,

00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:26.045
to try and understand what the
dynamics of political

00:35:26.045 --> 00:35:30.699
affiliation and identity
attachment really are.

00:35:30.699 --> 00:35:36.619
And so that's a Burkean agenda.
 

00:35:36.619 --> 00:35:40.529
Now if you fast-forward from
Burke to the middle of the

00:35:40.529 --> 00:35:44.333
twentieth century,
I had you read a short piece,

00:35:44.333 --> 00:35:47.010
very famous and important
piece,

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.579
by Lord Devlin who was an
English judge.

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:56.570
Like Burke, someone with Irish
origins,

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.719
though some certain amount of
ethnic ambiguity in both cases

00:36:00.719 --> 00:36:05.010
there about just how much Irish
and just how much English,

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.929
but we needn't detain ourselves
with that in this course.

00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:14.284
And he was commenting upon
something called the Wolfenden

00:36:14.284 --> 00:36:20.237
Report,
which was published in 1959 by

00:36:20.237 --> 00:36:30.195
a commission that had been asked
to tell the British Parliament

00:36:30.195 --> 00:36:39.510
what it should do about
homosexuality and prostitution.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:44.065
And the Wolfenden Report had
said, "The laws against

00:36:44.065 --> 00:36:46.179
them should be repealed.
 

00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:51.965
They should both be legalized
on the grounds (they didn't use

00:36:51.965 --> 00:36:57.269
these terms but this is the
basic thought or the term we

00:36:57.269 --> 00:37:02.670
would use today) that both
homosexuality and prostitution

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.949
are victimless crimes."
 

00:37:05.949 --> 00:37:12.170
They are, to use the jargon of
our course, Pareto-superior

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.480
exchanges.
 

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.331
They're voluntary transactions
among consenting adults that

00:37:17.331 --> 00:37:19.059
don't harm anybody else.
 

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:23.211
And of course this was put in a
different idiom because it was

00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:26.480
the 1950s, but that was
essentially the point.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.672
They don't harm anybody,
so it's just traditional

00:37:30.672 --> 00:37:36.001
prejudice, bigotry that leads us
to outlaw these things and we

00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:37.750
shouldn't do it.
 

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:41.980
That was what the Wolfenden
Report had said.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:54.159
And Burkean-to-the-core Lord
Devlin says, "No!"

00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:56.679
I don't know how caught up you
are in the reading.

00:37:56.679 --> 00:38:04.972
Anyone who has read Burke--I'm
sorry, Devlin,

00:38:04.972 --> 00:38:10.440
tell us why he thinks this.
 

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.679
Yeah?
 

00:38:11.679 --> 00:38:13.679
We need to get you the mic.
 

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:17.822
Why he thinks,
why is it that Lord Devlin

00:38:17.822 --> 00:38:24.242
thinks that the mere fact that
there's no harm is not enough of

00:38:24.242 --> 00:38:30.250
a basis for legalizing
homosexuality and prostitution.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:30.949
Yeah?
 

00:38:30.949 --> 00:38:34.181
Student:  He claims that
it's not an attack against the

00:38:34.181 --> 00:38:36.300
individual but a harm against
society.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.715
Prof: So what does that
mean, though,

00:38:38.715 --> 00:38:41.130
when you say it's a harm
against society?

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:44.539
How do you unpack that in your
own mind?

00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:50.221
Student:  I guess it's
maybe an attack against the

00:38:50.221 --> 00:38:54.280
morals that society tends to
agree to.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.590
Prof: Yeah, well, agreed.
 

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.079
Let's put brackets around
agreed.

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:02.242
It's not what we mean by it,
but certainly the morals that

00:39:02.242 --> 00:39:03.119
are there.
 

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:06.039
And where do they come from?
 

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:10.460
Where do those morals,
I mean, so we have a moral code

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.630
that says homosexuality and
prostitution are wrong,

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.050
but where does that come?
 

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.769
Anyone?
 

00:39:18.769 --> 00:39:20.489
Yeah?
 

00:39:20.489 --> 00:39:23.300
Student:  Well,
he put a lot of weight on the

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.780
basis of religion for driving
one's morals.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.253
Prof: Correct,
religion, an interesting--look

00:39:28.253 --> 00:39:29.710
what he says about religion.
 

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.965
He says, "Morals and
religions are inextricably

00:39:33.965 --> 00:39:36.969
joined--
the moral standards generally

00:39:36.969 --> 00:39:41.161
accepted in Western civilization
being those belonging to

00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:42.360
Christianity.
 

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:47.643
Outside Christendom (there's a
1950s word, we don't say

00:39:47.643 --> 00:39:50.579
Christendom anymore,
do we?)

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:54.320
other standards derive from
other religions."

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.871
Outside Christendom other
standards derived from other

00:39:57.871 --> 00:39:58.610
religion.
 

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.360
"In England we believe in
the Christian idea of marriage

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.610
and therefore adopt monogamy as
a moral principle.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.371
Consequently the Christian
institution of marriage has

00:40:09.371 --> 00:40:13.844
become the basis of family life,
and so part of the structure of

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:14.980
our society.
 

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:20.422
It is there not because it is
Christian (this comes to the

00:40:20.422 --> 00:40:23.860
point about whether we've
agreed).

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.639
It has got there because it is
Christian,

00:40:27.639 --> 00:40:33.646
but it remains there because it
is built into the house in which

00:40:33.646 --> 00:40:39.940
we live and could not be removed
without bringing it down."

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.804
It's there not because it's
Christian, it got there because

00:40:42.804 --> 00:40:44.929
it's Christian,
it's a matter of history.

00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:47.340
It was a Christian civilization.
 

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:53.329
So we have a Christian
conception of morality,

00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:57.590
but he's not saying it's true.
 

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:02.797
He's not saying that the
Christian set of beliefs about

00:41:02.797 --> 00:41:04.630
religion is true.
 

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.487
He has no interest in the
question of whether or not it's

00:41:08.487 --> 00:41:08.969
true.
 

00:41:08.969 --> 00:41:13.313
He's saying here,
"A different society might

00:41:13.313 --> 00:41:18.922
be glued together by a different
religion which wouldn't create

00:41:18.922 --> 00:41:20.099
monogamy.
 

00:41:20.099 --> 00:41:25.076
It might create polygamy,
and that would have its own

00:41:25.076 --> 00:41:30.436
history and its own system of
rights and institutions and

00:41:30.436 --> 00:41:34.360
everything that goes with
that."

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:39.704
So it's conservative in the
sense of affirming tradition,

00:41:39.704 --> 00:41:44.668
but not conservative in the
sense of saying there are

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:47.150
absolute moral values.
 

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.661
Neither Burke nor Devlin
ventures any opinion on that

00:41:51.661 --> 00:41:52.530
subject.
 

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:58.989
They say it's not even really
important.

00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:04.422
What's important is that the
people in the society believe in

00:42:04.422 --> 00:42:05.780
these values.
 

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:11.556
And if the people in this
society don't believe in some

00:42:11.556 --> 00:42:15.085
system of values as
authoritative,

00:42:15.085 --> 00:42:18.510
the society will fall apart.
 

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:26.400
You can't put together a
society just on the basis of

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.070
interest.
 

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:29.110
It needs more.
 

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.268
It needs moral glue.
 

00:42:31.268 --> 00:42:34.623
So these folks,
you could say when I say they

00:42:34.623 --> 00:42:39.119
don't really have a theory in
the sense that we've looked at

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:42.320
theories up until now in this
course,

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.869
it's because you could say,
"Well,

00:42:43.869 --> 00:42:45.070
they're not political theorists.
 

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.780
They're really sort of
sociologists.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:54.583
They're really sociologists of
stability because they're saying

00:42:54.583 --> 00:42:59.733
that it's necessary for a
society to be stable that it's

00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:04.976
held together by this kind of
moral glue of authoritative

00:43:04.976 --> 00:43:06.849
opinion."
 

00:43:06.849 --> 00:43:14.168
So when you say to Lord Devlin,
when he's defending the

00:43:14.168 --> 00:43:20.539
outlawing of homosexuality and
prostitution,

00:43:20.539 --> 00:43:24.974
"Well, that's just your
bigotry,"

00:43:24.974 --> 00:43:31.523
his answer wouldn't be to deny
that it's in some absolute sense

00:43:31.523 --> 00:43:35.530
an irrational position,
but he would say,

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.940
"Every society needs its
bigotry.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:44.840
Every society needs its
prejudices."

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:50.413
And so he doesn't appeal to
rationality, but he does appeal

00:43:50.413 --> 00:43:53.679
to what he calls reasonableness.
 

00:43:53.679 --> 00:43:55.829
And what is reasonableness?
 

00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:59.199
It's basically the system of
beliefs, as he puts it,

00:43:59.199 --> 00:44:02.369
"of the man on the Clapham
omnibus."

00:44:02.369 --> 00:44:11.684
We might today say the woman on
the A train reading the New York

00:44:11.684 --> 00:44:12.719
Post.
 

00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:20.967
The prejudices of the average
person that is the basic

00:44:20.967 --> 00:44:27.414
yardstick,
and if the average person is

00:44:27.414 --> 00:44:34.199
appalled by some practices,
then they should be illegal.

00:44:34.199 --> 00:44:44.989
And that's the beginning and
end of it.

00:44:44.989 --> 00:44:51.090
So what about that?
 

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:55.387
You could fast-forward it since
he talks about homosexuality and

00:44:55.387 --> 00:44:57.570
what we call gay rights today.
 

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.940
If you look at the American
trajectory,

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:05.472
in 1986 this came up before the
Supreme Court in a case called

00:45:05.472 --> 00:45:11.014
Bowers versus Hardwick,
and they essentially took the

00:45:11.014 --> 00:45:13.539
Burke-Devlin position.
 

00:45:13.539 --> 00:45:21.143
That is that states should be
allowed to outlaw homosexuality

00:45:21.143 --> 00:45:26.340
because most people find it
deplorable.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.530
A couple of years ago it came
back to the court and they said,

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:34.251
"Well, mores have evolved
enough since 1986 that we're

00:45:34.251 --> 00:45:37.996
going to overturn Bowers versus
Hardwick,"

00:45:37.996 --> 00:45:39.380
very Burkean.
 

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:44.809
They're following the man on
the Clapham omnibus.

00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:53.139
They're following the woman on
the A train's prejudices,

00:45:53.139 --> 00:46:00.559
beliefs and values,
and that's as it should be.

00:46:00.559 --> 00:46:03.369
What about that?
 

00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:08.400
How many people find this
appealing?

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.349
Only two?
 

00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:13.630
How many people find it
unappealing?

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:19.119
So we still have at least half
undecided.

00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:21.460
What's unappealing about it?
 

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.268
Yeah?
 

00:46:22.268 --> 00:46:23.059
Student: 
&gt;

00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:31.170
Prof: Take the
microphone.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:33.766
Student:  According to
his perspective we might still

00:46:33.766 --> 00:46:35.659
have a system of slavery in this
country.

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:38.344
Prof: According to this
perspective we would still have

00:46:38.344 --> 00:46:39.489
slavery in this country.
 

00:46:39.489 --> 00:46:43.789
Well, I think he wouldn't
concede the point that quickly.

00:46:43.789 --> 00:46:49.327
He would say what I just said
about Bowers versus Hardwick

00:46:49.327 --> 00:46:54.864
that if the views of the man on
the Clapham omnibus evolve

00:46:54.864 --> 00:46:59.420
enough,
then we can recognize change.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:07.608
Now you might want to not
accept that because what if they

00:47:07.608 --> 00:47:10.768
happen before--Yeah?
 

00:47:10.768 --> 00:47:13.978
Student:  Yeah,
to refute that I would just say

00:47:13.978 --> 00:47:17.550
that our morals and our ideas of
what is right and wrong are

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.181
shaped by the systems that we
were born into and consequently

00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:24.875
I feel like Burke and Devlin's
system ascribes a great deal of

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:28.568
value to the moral conceptions
at the beginning of society and

00:47:28.568 --> 00:47:32.018
that almost leads us to a system
of stasis in terms of our

00:47:32.018 --> 00:47:33.289
morality.
 

00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:36.798
There seems to be too much
stasis and no ability to

00:47:36.798 --> 00:47:40.449
reevaluate given how our moral
systems are shaped.

00:47:40.449 --> 00:47:41.420
Prof: I think that's
right,

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.360
and we will pick up with this
on Monday,

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:53.784
but if you think that the basic
society structure is okay you're

00:47:53.784 --> 00:47:59.400
likely to find this doctrine
appealing,

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.947
but if you think the basic
structure of the society is

00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:09.353
deeply unjust then you're likely
to be affronted by this outlook

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:14.416
because one person's reasonable
morality is another person's

00:48:14.416 --> 00:48:17.918
hegemony,
and we'll start with that idea

00:48:17.918 --> 00:48:18.699
next time.
 

00:48:18.699 --> 00:48:24.000

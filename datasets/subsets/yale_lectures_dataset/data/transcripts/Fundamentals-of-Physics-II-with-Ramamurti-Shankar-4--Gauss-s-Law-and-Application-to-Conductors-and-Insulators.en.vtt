00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.210
Prof: Let's start with a
brief recall of Gauss's Law.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.256
It is so important I wanted to
make sure you guys understand

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:14.480
not only how it is used but how
it's derived.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.165
I derived it for you last time,
but I thought the presentation

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:22.214
could be improved a little bit,
so I'm going to do it one more

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:27.517
time,
just this time only hitting the

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:29.390
highlights.
 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.450
The content of Gauss's Law is
very easy to visualize,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.938
so I'm going to draw you a
picture that'll tell you the

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:37.776
whole story,
then there are all the

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:38.350
equations.
 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.420
The picture is the following.
 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.904
You take one charge q
and you draw the lines of force

00:00:45.904 --> 00:00:48.600
coming from the one charge.
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330
It's a point charge.
 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:01:01.426
Therefore, you have no freedom
but to draw lines that look like

00:01:01.426 --> 00:01:02.679
this.
 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.310
Now, how many lines you draw is
a matter of convention.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.427
You can draw eight or twelve,
whatever it is,

00:01:10.427 --> 00:01:14.680
but you've got to agree that
the number per coulomb should be

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.390
fixed.
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.040
So we'll fix some number.
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.036
So I'm going to pick for
whatever charge is here these

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:21.640
lines.
 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.104
You cannot have a distribution
of lines in which it's suddenly

00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:29.688
more dense in just this
direction, for example.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:33.810
That's not allowed,
because if I take this point

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.274
charge and I rotate it,
it looks the same,

00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:40.565
but if I took the line
distribution with more dense

00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:43.330
here than other places if I
rotate it,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.040
it looks different.
 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.209
So if the cause of the field
lines looks the same after

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.760
rotation, the effect,
which is the field lines,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.459
should not change.
 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.394
You can only have a
distribution of lines with

00:01:58.394 --> 00:02:02.177
respect to symmetry of the
source of the cause of the field

00:02:02.177 --> 00:02:02.829
lines.
 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.319
You understand that?
 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.730
It cannot be biased one way or
the other, whereas this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.982
distribution,
if you turn it around,

00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:11.718
looks exactly the same.
 

00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:17.375
So we draw those lines,
and the content of Gauss's Law

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:20.150
is really the following.
 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.527
We are going to count the lines
crossing a sphere,

00:02:27.527 --> 00:02:36.260
S, and we're going to count the
lines crossing some generic

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.520
surface S'.
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.113
You can see at a glance without
doing any calculations that the

00:02:45.113 --> 00:02:47.240
following is true.
 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:59.400
Lines crossing S = lines
crossing S', right?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.408
That's clear to everybody?
 

00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:02.590
You don't need to do any
equation for that.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.139
That's because the lines have
nowhere to go but out,

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.038
and you can count them on this
circle,

00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:09.990
that circle as long as you
enclose the whole thing,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.098
the solid surface.
 

00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:14.830
Enclosing this charge you're
going to get the same lines.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.603
That's the heart of Gauss's
Law, but that's not the final

00:03:18.603 --> 00:03:22.038
form, but that's the part that
starts everything.

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.323
Now I'm going to calculate the
left hand side,

00:03:24.323 --> 00:03:26.810
and I'm going to calculate the
right hand side.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.449
I'm going to equate them.
 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.318
From that I will get almost
everything I want.

00:03:32.318 --> 00:03:35.628
Now, how many lines are coming
out of S?

00:03:35.628 --> 00:03:39.340
We know--first the notion of
line density.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.410
I've got to remind you what a
line density is.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.961
Line density is the lines per
area, but it's not enough to say

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:48.598
area.
 

00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:52.258
I'm going to put a
perpendicular symbol there.

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:56.836
That means the lines are going,
say, from left to right like

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:57.378
this.
 

00:03:57.378 --> 00:04:03.158
You want to put an area that
intercepts it perpendicularly,

00:04:03.158 --> 00:04:05.710
or if you like,
the area vector which is always

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.650
normal to the area should be
parallel to the lines.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.909
So it's the number of lines
crossing unit area perpendicular

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:12.740
to the lines.
 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.229
That's called the line density.
 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.932
If you tilted this area;
the same area,

00:04:17.932 --> 00:04:21.759
but at a bad angle,
it'll intersect fewer lines.

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.449
That you know.
 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.850
Okay, so this is the meaning of
line density.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.189
What's the line density going
to look like in this problem?

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:33.786
Line density is going to be
proportional to the charge you

00:04:33.786 --> 00:04:38.300
have because we agreed we'll put
some number of lines per

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.074
coulomb,
and it's inversely proportional

00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:47.350
to the radius because the area
of a sphere of radius r

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.459
is 4Πr^(2).
 

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:52.507
So if you cut it with a bigger
sphere of bigger radius the

00:04:52.507 --> 00:04:55.449
density, lines per area,
will go like 1/r^(2).

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.209
So it's proportional to
q.

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:00.160
It's proportional to
1/r^(2),

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.750
okay?
 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.790
So let me write not equal to
but proportional to.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.884
You have to stop me if you
don't follow anything I'm

00:05:08.884 --> 00:05:09.430
saying.
 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.910
There's no reason why you
shouldn't follow this argument.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:20.519
Then I say how about the
electric field?

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:21.629
The strength of the electric
field,

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.810
not the direction,
the electric field E at

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.254
radius r is also
proportional to q and

00:05:30.254 --> 00:05:33.740
also proportional to
1/r^(2).

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.781
Because from Coulomb's Law the
field is the force on a unit

00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:38.617
test charge, it is
q_1q

00:05:38.617 --> 00:05:39.720
_2.
 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.190
q_2 is 1
because the test charge is 1 and

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.622
there's
q/4Πε

00:05:43.622 --> 00:05:44.750
_0r^(2).
 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.940
Forget the 4Π.
 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.629
It's proportional to
q/r^(2).

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.187
From this we may conclude that
the line density is proportional

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:56.516
to the electric field because
they are both proportional to

00:05:56.516 --> 00:05:58.009
q/r^(2).
 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:05.406
Therefore, we can say line
density is equal to some

00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:12.949
constant c times the electric
field in magnitude;

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.350
direction of the lines is along
E, but the magnitude.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.420
Do you understand that?
 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.589
This guy is proportional to
this.

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.307
This may have some
proportionality constant,

00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:24.463
this may have another one,
but nothing changes the fact

00:06:24.463 --> 00:06:26.540
that this expression's
proportional to that one.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.449
The constant will depend on
details.

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.879
Let me just call it some number
c.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.949
c is up to you.
 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.834
It really depends on how many
lines you want to draw per

00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:36.360
coulomb.
 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.976
I made a particular choice last
time,

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:40.129
1/ε_0
lines per coulomb,

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.509
but you don't have to make that
to prove the law.

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:46.262
So this time I'm just assuming
the lines is proportional to

00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:49.949
charge, but you pick your own
proportionality constant.

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.682
So I've got this line density
that's proportional to electric

00:06:53.682 --> 00:06:54.180
field.
 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.708
Now I'm going to go back and
I'm going to calculate the left

00:06:58.708 --> 00:06:59.629
hand side.
 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:03.639
Now, let's give this equation a
number, equation number 1.

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:11.550
I'm going to calculate the left
hand side of 1.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:17.476
Left hand side of 1 is the
number of lines crossing this

00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:18.769
sphere, S.
 

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:25.000
So that's going to be equal
to--let me call it

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.509
Φ_S is equal to
number crossing S,

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.250
crossing this sphere S.
 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.560
Φ is the standard symbol
for flux.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.290
So what is it?
 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:08:04.810
Well, Φ_S = line
density times area of sphere,

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.949
because on a sphere the lines
are uniform in density so the

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:11.305
total number crossing the sphere
is the line density times area

00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:12.278
of the sphere.
 

00:08:12.278 --> 00:08:17.637
But the line density is a
constant times the electric

00:08:17.637 --> 00:08:24.024
field at radius r (if you
like) times area of the sphere

00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:27.220
which is 4Πr^(2).
 

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.086
That's the lines crossing the
inner surface which is this

00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:34.519
sphere of radius r.
 

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:46.350
Now, Φ_S' is
lines crossing S'.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.128
Now you've got to be a little
careful when you find the lines

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:51.009
crossing S'.
 

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:54.158
You understand why that's more
difficult?

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:59.767
What are the two complications
in finding the lines crossing S'

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:04.200
compared to this one which I did
in one second?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.899
Any idea?
 

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:05.950
Yes?
 

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.808
Student:  The normals
are all parallel to the field

00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:08.070
lines?
 

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.139
Prof: Which is not
parallel?

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:10.591
Student:  The normal to
the surface isn't parallel to

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:10.960
the ________.
 

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.600
Prof: Okay,
the surface is not--surface

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.178
vector at each point is not
parallel to the electric field.

00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:19.480
For example,
if you've got a crazy surface

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.066
like this--
I'll try to replicate that

00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:24.417
surface,
but I don't remember what I

00:09:24.417 --> 00:09:26.538
drew, some weird object like
this.

00:09:26.538 --> 00:09:31.745
Then the electric field point
this way, but the normal to the

00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:34.350
surface will point that way.
 

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.158
See, E points that way.
 

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:38.342
Tiny area there,
which I'm calling vector

00:09:38.342 --> 00:09:40.798
dA, points in a different
direction.

00:09:40.798 --> 00:09:43.798
So each region has a different
direction.

00:09:43.798 --> 00:09:48.272
Secondly, the strength of the
field itself is varying on the

00:09:48.272 --> 00:09:49.029
surface.
 

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:51.470
Unlike on a sphere where
everything is at the same

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.158
distance r some are
further, some are closer.

00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:57.788
But it is still true that if
you want the number of lines

00:09:57.788 --> 00:10:00.970
cross a patch,
if you pick a little area here,

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.796
if you want to know how many
lines cross that you take the

00:10:04.796 --> 00:10:08.677
normal to the area,
call it a vector dA,

00:10:08.677 --> 00:10:11.620
and you multiply by line
density.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:17.038
Therefore, this is equal to the
integral of the electric field

00:10:17.038 --> 00:10:22.014
at some point r dot
product with a tiny area which

00:10:22.014 --> 00:10:23.168
is there.
 

00:10:23.168 --> 00:10:28.528
At each region you've got to
draw a different dA.

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:32.029
So you take the surface,
you chop it up into tiny little

00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:32.538
tiles.
 

00:10:32.538 --> 00:10:35.389
Each tile is small enough to be
considered a plane.

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:38.543
Then the area vector is
perpendicular to the plane,

00:10:38.543 --> 00:10:41.951
outward from the surface,
and of magnitude equal to the

00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:43.970
numerical area of the plane.
 

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.172
So the lines crossing every
tiny little square on the big

00:10:47.172 --> 00:10:50.490
surface is the number of lines
per unit area times the area

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.350
times the cosine of the angle
which you need,

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:58.000
because the area vector may not
be parallel to the flow.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.710
I have explained many times why
the flow there,

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.067
the flow vector and the area
vector are not parallel you've

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:05.528
got to put in a
cosθ.

00:11:05.528 --> 00:11:10.139
That's what comes into this dot
product.

00:11:10.139 --> 00:11:12.653
And we write the symbol like
this to tell you not only is it

00:11:12.653 --> 00:11:14.676
a double integral,
meaning integral over a

00:11:14.676 --> 00:11:17.405
two-dimensional region,
but it's over a closed

00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:19.049
two-dimensional region.
 

00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:22.759
That symbol is to remind you.
 

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:26.188
So now, Φ_S equal
to Φ_S' is what

00:11:26.188 --> 00:11:27.389
I'm going to write.
 

00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:29.418
So I'm going to write--oh,
I made one mistake.

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:36.820
Can anybody see one thing
missing in this equation here?

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.389
This equation's not correct.
 

00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:44.330
To find the lines crossing S' I
took E times dA.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.038
It's a constant c
because the line density is not

00:11:48.038 --> 00:11:51.139
simply the electric field it's
the constant.

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:56.351
So I forgot the constant,
but I knew that I would need it

00:11:56.351 --> 00:12:00.538
because when I now equate
Φ_S to

00:12:00.538 --> 00:12:05.284
Φ_S' I get
constant times the electric

00:12:05.284 --> 00:12:10.124
field at r times
4Πr^(2) is equal to

00:12:10.124 --> 00:12:13.567
constant times the surface
integral of

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:18.500
E⋅dA on some
surface S'.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.476
But E(r) times
4Πr^(2) is c

00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:23.306
times
q/ε_0

00:12:23.306 --> 00:12:25.500
because E is
q/4Πε

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.120
_0r^(2).
 

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.139
You see that?
 

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:29.090
This much you should know.
 

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.730
I'm not going to write the
details.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:38.155
So that is equal to c
times surface integral of

00:12:38.155 --> 00:12:41.798
E⋅dA.
 

00:12:41.798 --> 00:12:45.330
Now you see the constant does
not matter,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.562
so whatever the constant is I
can make the following statement

00:12:49.562 --> 00:12:53.308
and that's going to be the
beginning of Gauss's Law.

00:12:53.308 --> 00:12:57.529
So Gauss's Law tells me that if
you took a charge and you sat

00:12:57.529 --> 00:13:01.539
under it with any surface
whatsoever--I'm not going to put

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:03.509
a prime on this anymore.
 

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:05.778
S is going to be the surface.
 

00:13:05.778 --> 00:13:11.682
Then the surface integral of
the electric field due to that

00:13:11.682 --> 00:13:17.688
charge over a surface is equal
to the charge that is sitting

00:13:17.688 --> 00:13:22.269
inside divided by
ε_0,

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:25.379
and it does not depend on the
details of the surface.

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:35.259
 
 

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:39.808
Okay, everybody should know in
principle how to do the surface

00:13:39.808 --> 00:13:40.629
integral.
 

00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:42.995
If I give you a surface,
and at the surface at every

00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:44.759
point I give you a vector
E,

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:47.393
which is electric field,
you should know how to

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:48.940
numerically calculate it.
 

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.072
You may not know how to do the
integral analytically,

00:13:52.072 --> 00:13:55.267
but operationally you should
know the meaning of this,

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:55.808
okay?
 

00:13:55.808 --> 00:13:58.672
If E were actually the
velocity of some stuff running

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:01.389
out of the volume you're
counting in each region how many

00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:04.350
guys are escaping per second and
you're adding it all up.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.820
And to find how many guys are
leaving a tiny area,

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.653
you multiply the area by the
velocity of flow times the

00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:12.539
cosine of the angle between the
velocity in the area.

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:14.610
That's it.
 

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.038
Okay, now we do the next thing.
 

00:14:18.038 --> 00:14:24.572
Let's call this charge
q_1 because I'm

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:31.590
now going to put a second guy
q_2 here.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.283
If you now think in terms of
lines of force you're going to

00:14:34.283 --> 00:14:36.418
get into a big mess because
lines of force,

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:38.529
due to two charges is a
complicated thing,

00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:40.409
you remember drawing some
pictures.

00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:42.009
But now here's the beauty.
 

00:14:42.009 --> 00:14:45.288
Forget the lines of force
completely, not interested.

00:14:45.288 --> 00:14:48.629
I'm interested in the electric
field.

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:52.269
Focus on the electric field for
which there's a very simple

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.710
rule.
 

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:58.245
The electric field due to two
charges 1 and 2 is the electric

00:14:58.245 --> 00:15:02.860
field due to 1 plus the electric
field due to 2.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:10.149
That's the great principle of
superposition.

00:15:10.149 --> 00:15:14.370
Therefore, on the left hand
side you might say if both

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.636
charges are inside the surface
integral of

00:15:17.636 --> 00:15:21.937
E_1,2_
meaning when both are

00:15:21.937 --> 00:15:26.318
present is equal to surface
integral of E_1

00:15:26.318 --> 00:15:30.700
⋅dA surface
integral of E_2

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:35.371
⋅dA,
because E_1,2

00:15:35.371 --> 00:15:38.750
is E_1
E_2.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.851
But the first guy is
q_1

00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:43.070
/ε
_0,

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:47.833
second is q_2
/ε

00:15:47.833 --> 00:15:49.940
_0.
 

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.038
Once you can do two charges you
can do any number of charges.

00:15:54.038 --> 00:15:57.950
And now we write Gauss's Law
almost in its final form.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.278
The final form is that if you
took the total electric field,

00:16:02.278 --> 00:16:05.811
I'm not going to put total,
E will stand for the

00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:09.490
total,
on a surface S that is

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.538
equal to the sum of all the
charges,

00:16:13.538 --> 00:16:16.580
i from 1 to whatever
many charges you have,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.389
divided by
ε_0.

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:22.523
The condition is these are
charges inside the volume

00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:24.548
bounded by the surface.
 

00:16:24.548 --> 00:16:27.538
You do not count the charge
here.

00:16:27.538 --> 00:16:31.740
You only count charges which
are inside not charges which are

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.440
outside.
 

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.794
So let's make a notation that
tells you that i is

00:16:37.794 --> 00:16:40.620
inside the volume V.
 

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.470
And this surface is the
boundary of the volume V.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.336
This partial derivative symbol
is the universal convention for

00:16:49.336 --> 00:16:51.649
the boundary of any region.
 

00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:56.149
Okay, if you draw a real
circle, this is the circle.

00:16:56.149 --> 00:17:00.580
The boundary of the circle is
this.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.836
If you a have a cube,
or if you have an orange the

00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:05.509
boundary of the volume orange is
the skin of the orange.

00:17:05.509 --> 00:17:07.048
That's the definition of
boundary.

00:17:07.048 --> 00:17:09.740
You can see this is like the
skin of the solid region,

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:14.650
and the surface integral on the
skin of the electric field is a

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.768
charge inside the volume
whatever be the shape of the

00:17:18.768 --> 00:17:19.640
volume.
 

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.440
And it works for all kinds of
surfaces.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.690
I mean, here's one example.
 

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.509
Suppose you have a charge here.
 

00:17:25.509 --> 00:17:29.009
You take a surface that kind of
intersects itself and so on.

00:17:29.009 --> 00:17:33.650
Then what can happen is if I
put a charge here the lines may

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:34.828
go like this.
 

00:17:34.828 --> 00:17:38.769
It doesn't matter because over
this when it switches back on

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:41.509
itself some lines leave,
some lines enter,

00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:43.578
and some lines leave again.
 

00:17:43.578 --> 00:17:48.846
So it might as well be that
surface because double entering

00:17:48.846 --> 00:17:51.480
and leaving doesn't matter.
 

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.757
So the rule is if q is
inside it contributes to the

00:17:55.757 --> 00:17:58.909
surface integral,
if q is outside it

00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:59.808
doesn't.
 

00:17:59.808 --> 00:18:03.608
The last variation is what if
q is not made up of a

00:18:03.608 --> 00:18:07.037
discrete set of charges,
which you can say one is here

00:18:07.037 --> 00:18:09.866
one is there,
but there's some continuous

00:18:09.866 --> 00:18:13.769
blob, some lump of charge where
the charge density--

00:18:13.769 --> 00:18:20.598
so then we say suppose q
is continuous.

00:18:20.598 --> 00:18:22.868
You've got to realize in real
life it's never continuous.

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:25.618
Real charges are made up of
electrons and protons.

00:18:25.618 --> 00:18:28.654
They are discrete,
but if your eye is not looking

00:18:28.654 --> 00:18:32.640
at it in great detail the charge
can appear to be continuous.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.763
For example,
if you take a glass of water

00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:37.420
the water is really made up of
point molecules,

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.134
water molecules,
but to your eye it looks like a

00:18:40.134 --> 00:18:41.288
continuous medium.
 

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:45.492
So for certain purposes we can
replace a discrete distribution

00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:47.009
by a continuous one.
 

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:50.550
For a continuous distribution
what you have to tell me is the

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.259
following.
 

00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:53.559
This is space x,
y, and z.

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:55.480
Here's the point.
 

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:01.670
I take a tiny cube whose sides
are dx,

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:07.519
dy and dz,
and ρ of x,

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:16.380
y, and z times
dxdydz is equal to charge

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.630
in that little cube.
 

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.909
In other words,
like the usual density with

00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:27.361
this mass per unit volume the
ρ is the charge per unit

00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:28.220
volume.
 

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.858
So you multiply by volume you
get the charge,

00:19:30.858 --> 00:19:32.598
but it need not be uniform.
 

00:19:32.598 --> 00:19:41.453
So if you have a solid region
then the charge density could be

00:19:41.453 --> 00:19:46.390
varying from point to point,
so.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.548
Oh, let's keep it here.
 

00:19:48.548 --> 00:19:54.186
In that case you will write the
surface integral of

00:19:54.186 --> 00:20:00.614
E⋅dA over a
surface that binds a volume

00:20:00.614 --> 00:20:05.799
V would be
1/ε_0 times

00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:10.309
the volume integral of ρ
of (x, y,

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:13.578
z) dxdydz.
 

00:20:13.578 --> 00:20:24.670
This is the final form of
Gauss's Law.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:31.980
Now, how many people have ever
done integrals in more than one

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.420
dimension?
 

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.185
Great, very good,
made my day because I didn't

00:20:38.185 --> 00:20:39.670
have Plan B.
 

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:44.093
But I did--no actually I had a
Plan Tiny B which is to give you

00:20:44.093 --> 00:20:45.519
a quick refresher.
 

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:49.290
If there is time at the end of
the class I will remind you of

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.680
how the multiple integrals are
done.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.758
But right now I'm going to show
you the efficacy of this law and

00:20:54.758 --> 00:20:57.250
that doesn't require doing
complicated integrals.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.771
All the integrals will be so
trivial you can just read them

00:21:01.771 --> 00:21:02.240
off.
 

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.038
So when we have time we'll do
questions of how to do these

00:21:06.038 --> 00:21:10.368
integrals, but I'm assuming this
symbol means something to you.

00:21:10.368 --> 00:21:12.558
In words it means all the
charge inside.

00:21:12.558 --> 00:21:15.461
So, again, by taking the
volume, dividing into tiny

00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:17.425
regions,
multiplying each volume,

00:21:17.425 --> 00:21:19.393
tiny volume,
by the density to get the

00:21:19.393 --> 00:21:21.602
charge there,
and summing over all the

00:21:21.602 --> 00:21:24.089
volumes inside the big volume
V.

00:21:24.089 --> 00:21:25.068
That's a charge.
 

00:21:25.068 --> 00:21:28.670
So Gauss's Law still says the
surface integral of E is

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.769
the charge inside over epsilon
0.

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:33.990
All right, so this is the great
law.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.776
Now we're going to get some
mileage out of it to solve

00:21:37.776 --> 00:21:41.920
certain problems which normally
would be very difficult.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.479
The first problem,
I think I probably did that

00:21:45.479 --> 00:21:50.145
last time but it's worth going
over, is what is the electric

00:21:50.145 --> 00:21:53.390
field of a uniform density of
charge.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:59.602
Suppose there's a charge
Q and this is sphere of

00:21:59.602 --> 00:22:04.433
radius r,
and it is a ball of radius

00:22:04.433 --> 00:22:05.930
r.
 

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.888
You take all these charges and
you pile them on top of each

00:22:07.888 --> 00:22:08.160
other.
 

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.042
They don't like it,
but you glue them or do

00:22:10.042 --> 00:22:11.210
whatever you have to do.
 

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.720
You've got a ball of charge
Q.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.160
You want the field due to that.
 

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.660
It's the same problem Newton
had with gravity.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.528
The earth is a solid ball.
 

00:22:20.528 --> 00:22:24.242
It's got mass everywhere and
you would like to find the force

00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:25.108
on an apple.
 

00:22:25.108 --> 00:22:29.189
And it's not so evident that
the force of the earth on the

00:22:29.189 --> 00:22:33.769
apple is as if the entire mass
of the earth but at the center.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:35.210
You have to prove that.
 

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.180
You have to prove that by
dividing the earth into little

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.881
pieces and finding the
gravitational force of every

00:22:40.881 --> 00:22:44.230
little piece on the apple and
adding all those vectors up.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.940
And when you do all the hard
work you will find,

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.798
in fact, that it's true,
but it took Newton several

00:22:48.798 --> 00:22:52.285
years to prove that even though
he was pretty certain that was

00:22:52.285 --> 00:22:52.798
true.
 

00:22:52.798 --> 00:22:55.555
That's very important because
when you do the force law for

00:22:55.555 --> 00:22:57.740
apple versus the earth the
distance you use for

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.068
m_1m
_2/r^(2) is

00:23:00.068 --> 00:23:02.967
a center-to-center distance as
if the entire earth were at the

00:23:02.967 --> 00:23:03.680
center.
 

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.490
A similar law is true for
electric forces.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.806
In other words,
if you've got a spherical

00:23:08.806 --> 00:23:12.511
distribution of charge the field
due to that outside that ball is

00:23:12.511 --> 00:23:15.058
as if all the charge were at the
center.

00:23:15.058 --> 00:23:18.497
That's what we want to prove,
but we want to prove that

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:22.188
without doing any difficult
integrals, and the trick is the

00:23:22.188 --> 00:23:23.078
following.
 

00:23:23.078 --> 00:23:26.972
You are going to use Gauss's
Law, and you can use Gauss's Law

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:28.660
on any surface you like.
 

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.029
For example,
you can take that surface and

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:36.715
you can say surface integral of
E on the surface is

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:40.695
Q/ε_0,
but that's not very helpful

00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:44.066
because what you're trying to
find out is not the electric

00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:46.490
field integrated over a whole
region,

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.500
but the electric field at each
point.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.690
You want to know what's going
on right there.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.823
So even though it's a true
statement that whatever E

00:23:55.823 --> 00:23:57.875
is doing its integral on any
surface is

00:23:57.875 --> 00:24:00.684
Q/ε_0 that
doesn't tell you what is

00:24:00.684 --> 00:24:04.451
E at every point,
and we're going to find that by

00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:05.869
the following trick.
 

00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:08.980
The trick is to first decide.
 

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.041
This surface S,
by the way, it's called a

00:24:12.041 --> 00:24:13.279
Gaussian surface.
 

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:16.420
It's not a real surface.
 

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.670
In real life there are no
Gaussian surfaces.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:21.453
You draw them for a
calculation, and you can move it

00:24:21.453 --> 00:24:24.674
around in your mind anyway you
like, for each surface you'll

00:24:24.674 --> 00:24:26.150
get a different answer.
 

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:34.173
We'll pick a Gaussian surface
equal to a sphere of radius

00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:35.750
r.
 

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:49.420
So I'm going to pick a Gaussian
surface of radius r.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.395
I'm going to argue two things
and you have to follow the

00:24:52.395 --> 00:24:55.210
reasoning because all the work
is in the argument.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.526
You don't do any integrals,
but you do some serious

00:24:58.526 --> 00:24:59.190
arguing.
 

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.140
The arguing says it's a ball,
positive charge.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.630
It's going to repel a test
charge.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.950
Which way is the repulsion
going to be at this point?

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.700
It has to be radially away from
the center.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.328
That's your argument.
 

00:25:11.328 --> 00:25:15.578
At each point the repulsion has
to be away from the center.

00:25:15.578 --> 00:25:18.144
In other words the electric
field has to have this

00:25:18.144 --> 00:25:18.930
distribution.
 

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.694
We're not saying how it varies
with distance,

00:25:21.694 --> 00:25:23.328
but it has to be radial.
 

00:25:23.328 --> 00:25:27.057
Again, the argument is the
radially outgoing thing like a

00:25:27.057 --> 00:25:27.788
hedgehog.
 

00:25:27.788 --> 00:25:31.001
It's the only distribution of
lines which will look the same

00:25:31.001 --> 00:25:34.160
if you rotate them because then
one line will go to another

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.650
line.
 

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.568
The hedgehog will look exactly
the same.

00:25:37.568 --> 00:25:40.757
And that is a necessary
requirement because if you took

00:25:40.757 --> 00:25:44.063
this ball of charge you all
understand that if you rotate

00:25:44.063 --> 00:25:47.663
the ball the field lines have to
rotate due to any calculation

00:25:47.663 --> 00:25:50.269
you did,
but if you rotate the ball it

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:51.220
looks the same.
 

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.660
So the field lines have to look
the same.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.969
So the distribution you draw
must be invariant under that

00:25:55.969 --> 00:25:56.618
rotation.
 

00:25:56.618 --> 00:25:59.586
This is a very powerful
principle of symmetry and

00:25:59.586 --> 00:26:00.390
invariance.
 

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.960
The principle says if something
is the cause of something,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.390
and if I do something to the
cause that leaves it alone,

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.755
namely it looks the same,
the effect has to look the

00:26:09.755 --> 00:26:10.079
same.
 

00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:12.009
It's a very reasonable argument.
 

00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:15.217
And the cause here is a ball of
charge which is completely

00:26:15.217 --> 00:26:16.680
isotropic and spherical.
 

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.163
You turn it,
it looks the same,

00:26:18.163 --> 00:26:20.288
so the field distribution looks
the same.

00:26:20.288 --> 00:26:23.624
That's all you need to proceed
because that distribution then

00:26:23.624 --> 00:26:26.568
is going to have radial lines of
unknown strength,

00:26:26.568 --> 00:26:29.059
but the strength can vary only
with r,

00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:30.368
but not at a given r.
 

00:26:30.368 --> 00:26:32.612
At a given r the
direction varies,

00:26:32.612 --> 00:26:35.135
but the strength is some E
of r,

00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:37.940
and we're asking what is
E of r?

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.711
So we know that E looks
like r,

00:26:41.711 --> 00:26:46.685
which is the vector of length
in the radial direction times

00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:48.828
E of r.
 

00:26:48.828 --> 00:26:52.438
And sometimes I also write this
as e_r times

00:26:52.438 --> 00:26:55.565
E of r,
and we just want to know what E

00:26:55.565 --> 00:26:57.369
is a function of r.
 

00:26:57.369 --> 00:27:00.980
But now we can use Gauss's Law.
 

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.778
So the left hand side is a
surface integral of this radial

00:27:04.778 --> 00:27:07.578
E on a sphere of radius
r.

00:27:07.578 --> 00:27:12.230
That's going to be E
times 4Πr^(2),

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:16.608
because E is a constant
on the surface.

00:27:16.608 --> 00:27:18.881
The integral of a constant on
the surface is the constant

00:27:18.881 --> 00:27:20.180
times the area of the surface.
 

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.794
It's like saying if you want to
integrate a function which is

00:27:23.794 --> 00:27:27.468
constant from here to here it's
the constant height multiplied

00:27:27.468 --> 00:27:30.480
by the interval over which
you're integrating.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.750
There's no integral to do.
 

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.119
It's very trivial.
 

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:34.390
It's a rectangle.
 

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.396
Similarly a constant function
integrated on a sphere is the

00:27:37.396 --> 00:27:39.678
area times this,
but E is the function

00:27:39.678 --> 00:27:41.130
of, of course,
r.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.019
That's going to be charge
enclosed.

00:27:43.019 --> 00:27:45.432
The charge enclosed is Q
and you've got to put the

00:27:45.432 --> 00:27:48.229
ε_0,
and then you find

00:27:48.229 --> 00:27:52.980
E(r) is
Q/4Πε

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.509
_0r^(2).
 

00:27:55.509 --> 00:28:02.199
And if you want to put all the
vectors back you can write here

00:28:02.199 --> 00:28:05.380
times e_r.
 

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:10.837
So by this trick one can show
that the field of a sphere is as

00:28:10.837 --> 00:28:14.150
if the charges were at the
center,

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:21.650
provided you are talking about
a point outside the sphere.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.020
As long as this field is
outside the real ball no matter

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.962
what its radius is,
the charge enclosed is always

00:28:27.962 --> 00:28:28.759
Q.
 

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:30.868
The right hand side doesn't
vary with Q.

00:28:30.868 --> 00:28:33.829
The left hand side looks like r
squared times electric field so

00:28:33.829 --> 00:28:35.548
E goes like
1/r^(2).

00:28:35.548 --> 00:28:39.180
But now I'm going to do some
variations on this.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:46.712
The first variation is what if
I want the electric field at

00:28:46.712 --> 00:28:50.220
some point here,
in here?

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.210
You're allowed to ask that.
 

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.953
You can take an instrument and
put it there and ask what field

00:28:53.953 --> 00:28:54.450
you have.
 

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.566
You have to calculate that too,
so let's calculate it for a

00:28:57.566 --> 00:28:58.048
sphere.
 

00:28:58.048 --> 00:29:02.538
The formula is the same,
same formula.

00:29:02.538 --> 00:29:06.994
Everything is the same,
but Q is now the charge

00:29:06.994 --> 00:29:07.920
enclosed.
 

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.961
So I'm going to write,
again, 4Πε

00:29:11.961 --> 00:29:16.073
_0,
I'm sorry, 4Πr^(2)

00:29:16.073 --> 00:29:20.358
times E(r) is the
charge enclosed over

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:22.460
ε_0.
 

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.321
What is the charge enclosed in
this sphere, now,

00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:31.335
which is a mathematical sphere
with radius as little r,

00:29:31.335 --> 00:29:34.539
but it's smaller than big
R?

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:41.818
Can you make a guess?
 

00:29:41.818 --> 00:29:45.940
How much charge do you think
that is in a smaller sphere?

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.950
Yeah?
 

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.369
Student:  The charge
density times volume.

00:29:49.369 --> 00:29:50.400
Prof: Right.
 

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.358
So he said it's the charge
density times the volume.

00:29:54.358 --> 00:29:57.294
I'm going to write down the
answer without going through the

00:29:57.294 --> 00:29:59.731
intermediate step,
but it'll coincide with what he

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:00.180
said.
 

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.855
The answer I'm going to write
down is the total charge is

00:30:03.855 --> 00:30:05.759
Q on the whole ball.
 

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:08.038
The charge is proportional to
the volume.

00:30:08.038 --> 00:30:11.169
Then the volume of this little
guy is r^(3) and the

00:30:11.169 --> 00:30:13.420
volume of the big guy big
R^(3).

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.140
That's how much charge will be
enclosed.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.470
Can you see that?
 

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.950
If you take a square,
and you take a part of the

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.220
square that's inside that's half
as big,

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.710
the area of it will be
¼,

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.220
because areas go like 1 over
the distance squared.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.318
Volumes go like 1 over distance
cubed.

00:30:28.318 --> 00:30:30.838
But we can also do what he just
said.

00:30:30.838 --> 00:30:34.829
You can take the Q
divide it by the volume

00:30:34.829 --> 00:30:36.660
4/3Πr^(3).
 

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.529
That's the density.
 

00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:41.989
Then you can multiply the
density by the volume of the

00:30:41.989 --> 00:30:44.170
little sphere 4/3Π
little r cubed,

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.068
and all I'm saying is forget
these 4 thirds pis.

00:30:47.068 --> 00:30:53.029
It's just little r^(3)
over big R^(3).

00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:56.950
Therefore, the electric field
now, E(r),

00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:03.330
looks like Q over
4Πε

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:10.180
_0r divided by
r^(3).

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.680
This is for r &lt;
R,

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.665
is equal to Q/4Π
ε_0

00:31:18.665 --> 00:31:22.561
(1/r^(2)) for
r &gt;

00:31:22.561 --> 00:31:23.740
R.
 

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.990
Student:  Isn't it
supposed to be r cubed ________?

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.430
Prof: Sorry, here?
 

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.829
Student:  Yeah,
down on the second one.

00:31:32.829 --> 00:31:33.410
Prof: Here you mean?
 

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.788
This line?
 

00:31:34.788 --> 00:31:38.259
Student:  No,
I mean like on the line above.

00:31:38.259 --> 00:31:40.328
You have like r over
r cubed.

00:31:40.328 --> 00:31:42.307
Prof: I have little r
cubed over big R

00:31:42.307 --> 00:31:42.578
cubed.
 

00:31:42.578 --> 00:31:43.558
Student:  Right,
but no.

00:31:43.558 --> 00:31:44.309
I mean the next line.
 

00:31:44.309 --> 00:31:44.880
Prof: Here?
 

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.140
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.136
Prof: This is r
less than R,

00:31:48.136 --> 00:31:49.470
r bigger than R.
 

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.960
Student:
&gt;

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.420
Oh, gotcha.
 

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.244
Prof: Oh,
you mean this 4Πr

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:54.349
squared came downstairs?
 

00:31:54.349 --> 00:31:55.740
Yeah, that's right.
 

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.690
Student:  Gotcha.
 

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.474
Prof: Okay,
eternally vigilant,

00:32:00.474 --> 00:32:01.529
that's good.
 

00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:02.588
Yes?
 

00:32:02.588 --> 00:32:05.420
Student:  What if little
r equals big R?

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.308
Prof: Let's ask.
 

00:32:06.308 --> 00:32:09.598
What if little r grows
up and become big R,

00:32:09.598 --> 00:32:10.069
right?
 

00:32:10.069 --> 00:32:11.289
We'll find out.
 

00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:13.769
What do you expect?
 

00:32:13.769 --> 00:32:16.501
You've got to get the same
answer at the field at a certain

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:18.198
point no matter how we
approached it,

00:32:18.198 --> 00:32:18.670
right?
 

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.890
You'll find that's true in this
formula,

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:25.373
because if you put little
r equals big R and

00:32:25.373 --> 00:32:29.384
big R over big
R^(3) you'll get 1 over

00:32:29.384 --> 00:32:33.632
big R^(2) and this will
also give you 1 over big

00:32:33.632 --> 00:32:38.036
R^(2). These formulas
will match on the surface of

00:32:38.036 --> 00:32:39.609
this sphere.
 

00:32:39.609 --> 00:32:42.038
Yes?
 

00:32:42.038 --> 00:32:46.071
Student:  So can you say
again why we can assume that we

00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:49.779
don't have to do the integral
________________________?

00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:51.868
Prof: Why did I not do
the integral?

00:32:51.868 --> 00:32:56.959
Student:  Why we
________ 4 pi squared times E of

00:32:56.959 --> 00:32:57.328
r.
 

00:32:57.328 --> 00:32:58.420
Prof: Why do I do that
you mean?

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.000
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.846
Prof: Right.
 

00:33:00.846 --> 00:33:05.220
So the correct way to do it is
to really do

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.160
E⋅dA, right?
 

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.348
If I did that it'll be fine
with you, correct?

00:33:11.348 --> 00:33:17.490
This is what you're saying I
should do, right?

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.663
You asked me why I didn't do
this integral,

00:33:19.663 --> 00:33:21.423
why I just wrote
4Πr^(2),

00:33:21.423 --> 00:33:22.769
is that your question?
 

00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:24.430
Right.
 

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:29.096
The assumed form for E
is the function that depends on

00:33:29.096 --> 00:33:33.220
r times unit vector in
the radial direction.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:38.154
And since I surrounded it with
this sphere the tiny area vector

00:33:38.154 --> 00:33:42.532
is also e_r
times the value of the tiny

00:33:42.532 --> 00:33:43.250
area.
 

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:48.061
In other words,
dA and E are both

00:33:48.061 --> 00:33:52.769
parallel if the surface is a
sphere, right?

00:33:52.769 --> 00:33:55.740
So when you take the dot
product this will just become

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.601
E(r) times
dA times cosine of 0

00:33:58.601 --> 00:34:00.339
which you don't care about.
 

00:34:00.339 --> 00:34:01.880
That's the first thing.
 

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.328
You still have to integrate
over this sphere,

00:34:04.328 --> 00:34:07.667
but E of r is a
constant on this sphere because

00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:09.449
it depends only on r.
 

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:12.018
So throughout the whole sphere
if it's a constant,

00:34:12.018 --> 00:34:16.440
it's like the number 19,
you just pull it and then you

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.443
get E of r times
integral dA and that is

00:34:21.443 --> 00:34:23.530
my 4Πr^(2).
 

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.865
So in general you have to do an
integral, but if you're lucky

00:34:26.865 --> 00:34:30.369
and the integrand is a constant
then the integral is trivial.

00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:34.244
So for a charge at the center
of the spherical ball,

00:34:34.244 --> 00:34:38.041
and if you went to a sphere
then the integrant is a

00:34:38.041 --> 00:34:39.030
constant.
 

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.010
Okay, so this is what you get.
 

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.000
If you draw a picture of this
it looks like this.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.467
Electric field as the function
of r it will grow with

00:34:49.467 --> 00:34:54.949
r then it will decline as
1/r^(2).

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:59.030
And here is little r
equals big R.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.155
Yep?
 

00:34:59.155 --> 00:35:00.994
Student:  What if it
were hollow and all the charges

00:35:00.994 --> 00:35:02.010
were on the outside ________?
 

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.230
Prof: We'll come to that.
 

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.610
Yes?
 

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.657
Student:  Why can we
ignore the charge that's outside

00:35:08.657 --> 00:35:09.639
the small sphere?
 

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:11.099
Prof: Why don't we count
it?

00:35:11.099 --> 00:35:12.219
Student:  Uh-huh,
did you explain that already?

00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:14.105
Prof: Yeah,
well it's a very interesting

00:35:14.105 --> 00:35:14.719
point, right?
 

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:17.735
Suppose you make a hole in the
earth, of if you go deep into

00:35:17.735 --> 00:35:18.349
the earth.
 

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:21.777
We said if you're outside the
earth the entire ball is pulling

00:35:21.777 --> 00:35:23.710
you in,
but the claim I'm making is if

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.726
you're inside the earth,
if you're here,

00:35:25.726 --> 00:35:28.590
only the ball underneath your
feet is pulling you,

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.110
but not these guys, right?
 

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.083
That's the question,
why don't they exert a force,

00:35:33.083 --> 00:35:33.570
right?
 

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:40.902
Well, Gauss's Law says,
no, but we can try to verify

00:35:40.902 --> 00:35:43.489
that explicitly.
 

00:35:43.489 --> 00:35:46.545
So we are going to do the
hollow sphere,

00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:49.679
but you followed the solid
sphere now?

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:52.349
So why is the field getting
stronger as you leave the

00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:55.378
center, why is it falling like
1/r^(2) once you leave

00:35:55.378 --> 00:35:56.150
the sphere?
 

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.849
You've got to think about that.
 

00:35:59.849 --> 00:36:05.239
Why is it growing when you
leave the origin?

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:06.369
Yep?
 

00:36:06.369 --> 00:36:08.550
Student:  Because there
is more charge _________.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.483
Prof: Right.
 

00:36:09.483 --> 00:36:11.793
The charge you are enclosing
grows like r cubed,

00:36:11.793 --> 00:36:14.300
and the distance from the
center of that charge is r

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.070
squared which comes downstairs.
 

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.239
So as you go further out inside
the ball you are gaining,

00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:22.061
but once you reach the surface
of the ball and you go further

00:36:22.061 --> 00:36:24.320
out you're getting more area for
Gauss's Law,

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.610
but not more charge which is
stuck at capital Q.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:31.490
That's why once you leave the
sphere it starts declining,

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:34.750
but if you're inside the sphere
it increases.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.510
This is also true for the
gravitational force.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:40.143
The gravitational force if you
go to the center of the earth

00:36:40.143 --> 00:36:43.594
and you move away by 1 inch
you'll be pulled back with an

00:36:43.594 --> 00:36:46.983
extremely weak force that's
proportional to the distance

00:36:46.983 --> 00:36:49.139
from the center of the earth.
 

00:36:49.139 --> 00:36:54.340
Okay, then we come to another
question which came up,

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:58.139
which is let's take a hollow
sphere.

00:36:58.139 --> 00:37:10.989
I take a sphere and I scoop a
hole in it and I want the field

00:37:10.989 --> 00:37:12.489
here.
 

00:37:12.489 --> 00:37:16.436
Okay, so if you want the field
here you take a Gauss's Law for

00:37:16.436 --> 00:37:19.619
a circle like that,
or a sphere like that and

00:37:19.619 --> 00:37:23.561
you'll get E times
4Πr^(2) is equal to 1

00:37:23.561 --> 00:37:26.659
over ε_0 at
times what?

00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:28.130
Student:  Nothing.
 

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.489
Prof: Nothing.
 

00:37:29.489 --> 00:37:34.239
So the electric field inside a
hollow sphere is 0.

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:36.619
In other words,
if you took the earth and you

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:39.269
scooped a big hole in the middle
you can float.

00:37:39.269 --> 00:37:42.789
It won't pull you at all.
 

00:37:42.789 --> 00:37:45.349
So inside a hollow sphere there
is no electric field.

00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:47.940
Even though there's charge
everywhere there's no electric

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.309
field.
 

00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:51.764
We can understand that in some
cases, and other cases require a

00:37:51.764 --> 00:37:52.989
little more thought.
 

00:37:52.989 --> 00:37:57.166
Let me first show you that for
a very, very thin shell why that

00:37:57.166 --> 00:37:57.840
happens.
 

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.387
Once it's true for a very,
very thin shell and it doesn't

00:38:00.387 --> 00:38:03.072
do anything you can put one
shell inside another and make it

00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:05.849
as thick as you like because 0
is going to be the contribution

00:38:05.849 --> 00:38:06.760
from each guy.
 

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.889
So let me take a very thin
shell.

00:38:08.889 --> 00:38:11.539
Here's a very thin shell.
 

00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:14.030
So remember, this is not a ball.
 

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:18.230
This is a shell whose thickness
is the thickness of the chalk

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.719
here.
 

00:38:18.719 --> 00:38:22.311
I think you will agree that at
the center of this sphere the

00:38:22.311 --> 00:38:23.530
force has to be 0.
 

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.949
You agree with that?
 

00:38:25.949 --> 00:38:27.760
Because which way should it go?
 

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.974
For every guy pushing,
say from here in that

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:32.858
direction, there's another one
from there pushing in this

00:38:32.858 --> 00:38:33.579
direction.
 

00:38:33.579 --> 00:38:35.750
They all cancel.
 

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.099
It's very clear that at the
center you don't feel a force.

00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:43.873
But what is truly amazing is
that even when you're off center

00:38:43.873 --> 00:38:46.280
you don't feel a force.
 

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.253
So I'm going to give you the
argument for that one,

00:38:50.253 --> 00:38:54.704
argument for that namely I'm
once again going to pair off

00:38:54.704 --> 00:38:56.929
canceling charges,
okay?

00:38:56.929 --> 00:39:00.480
I'm going to cancel one thing
against another thing.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.061
When you were at the center you
canceled a little charge here

00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:06.150
with a little charge here,
right?

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.579
When you are here here's what
you do.

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:16.469
Take a cone like that.
 

00:39:16.469 --> 00:39:17.518
It is not two lengths.
 

00:39:17.518 --> 00:39:20.923
It is a three dimensional cone,
but I'm able to show you only a

00:39:20.923 --> 00:39:23.449
slice right down the middle,
you understand?

00:39:23.449 --> 00:39:26.389
This is really a cone that'll
cut the sphere there;

00:39:26.389 --> 00:39:28.889
it'll cut the sphere there.
 

00:39:28.889 --> 00:39:30.900
Take all these guys.
 

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.364
They have a certain charge,
which is some charge density

00:39:33.364 --> 00:39:37.507
which is uniform,
times the area of this thing

00:39:37.507 --> 00:39:44.469
divided by the square of the
distance r_1.

00:39:44.469 --> 00:39:47.733
Here, these charges here will
push you to the right with a

00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:49.909
force which is the area of
density,

00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:54.635
the charge density per unit
area times the area of the

00:39:54.635 --> 00:39:59.719
smaller circle divided by
r_2 squared.

00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:15.018
But now I claim that I can
equate these two.

00:40:15.018 --> 00:40:19.018
I can equate these two if this
area of vector and this area of

00:40:19.018 --> 00:40:22.822
vector were radiating outwards,
and this is actually a true

00:40:22.822 --> 00:40:23.739
statement.
 

00:40:23.739 --> 00:40:25.518
This area is proportional to
r_1 squared.

00:40:25.518 --> 00:40:32.764
This area is proportional to
r_1 squared,

00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:36.449
therefore they will cancel.
 

00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:38.449
But this is a very subtle
argument.

00:40:38.449 --> 00:40:41.170
Sometimes even textbooks get it
wrong.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:46.409
And generally if you take two
cones like this you can see that

00:40:46.409 --> 00:40:51.650
the area vector points that way,
but the electric field vector

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.369
points this way.
 

00:40:53.369 --> 00:40:54.440
They are not the same.
 

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.742
The area vector,
area on the sphere,

00:40:56.742 --> 00:40:59.769
right, will point in one
direction, but the

00:40:59.769 --> 00:41:02.349
r vector is different.
 

00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:06.789
So you have to take the cosine
θ on both sides,

00:41:06.789 --> 00:41:10.083
but it turns out cosine
θ is also the same

00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:13.744
because if you took a line and
you cut it this way that angle

00:41:13.744 --> 00:41:15.329
will equal that angle.
 

00:41:15.329 --> 00:41:18.476
So that's a subtly we don't
need, but that's how you really

00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:19.780
prove for every shell.
 

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.909
There's a cancellation.
 

00:41:20.909 --> 00:41:23.190
If you know what a solid angle
is it's very easy to say.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.050
This is called,
with the cosine thetas in it,

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.510
it's called a solid angle
enclosed by this point,

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.476
and the two things have the
same solid angle and they

00:41:32.476 --> 00:41:32.989
cancel.
 

00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:37.704
But if you don't want the most
complicated proof you can take

00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:42.262
points like this where it's
clear that this area vector and

00:41:42.262 --> 00:41:45.800
this area vector are both
perpendicular,

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.378
and to the radial direction,
and therefore the electric

00:41:49.378 --> 00:41:51.829
field and this vector are
parallel.

00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:53.809
Then you don't need the cosine
thetas.

00:41:53.809 --> 00:41:56.440
They are clearly equal at
possibly even 1.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.570
Then A/r^(2) being the
same is the reason it works.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:03.659
In other words,
if the force of gravity or the

00:42:03.659 --> 00:42:07.641
electric force did not fall
exactly like 1/r^(2) the

00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:10.869
field inside a hollow sphere
will not be 0.

00:42:10.869 --> 00:42:13.987
So this is how people tested
the 1/r^(2) force law in

00:42:13.987 --> 00:42:14.780
the old days.
 

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.356
They went inside a hollow
sphere and tried to see if there

00:42:17.356 --> 00:42:20.025
is any field inside by putting
test charges and finding they

00:42:20.025 --> 00:42:20.840
don't respond.
 

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.880
That's the most reliable way to
prove 0 field.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.739
Yes?
 

00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:27.936
Student:  Can you
explain again why the A over r

00:42:27.936 --> 00:42:29.179
squareds are equal?
 

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:32.487
Prof: Well,
you can see that if you took a

00:42:32.487 --> 00:42:37.878
cone and if you just did similar
triangles you can see that this

00:42:37.878 --> 00:42:41.559
area is growing like that radius
square.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:44.949
It's a matter of how areas grow
when you scale anything.

00:42:44.949 --> 00:42:48.818
Take a cone,
okay, and you slice it at some

00:42:48.818 --> 00:42:51.949
point, and slice it even higher.
 

00:42:51.949 --> 00:42:54.210
Here's a cone.
 

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.918
You slice it there and you
slice it there,

00:42:56.918 --> 00:43:01.014
and my claim is this area is to
that area that distance squared

00:43:01.014 --> 00:43:03.130
is to that distance squared.
 

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:03.900
Why is that, right?
 

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.960
That's your question.
 

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:10.380
The area of this cone is
something, something radius

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.887
times something,
something height,

00:43:13.887 --> 00:43:14.949
right?
 

00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:18.268
So you can calculate,
if you like.

00:43:18.268 --> 00:43:22.864
The radius of this circle and
the radius of that circle are

00:43:22.864 --> 00:43:25.480
growing linearly as you go out.
 

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.510
If you go distance r
here, and you get a radius here,

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.539
if you go distance r
there you get another radius.

00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:35.085
Is it clear to you that the
radii are proportional to the

00:43:35.085 --> 00:43:37.619
distance from the center in this
cone?

00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:38.570
Let me draw it again.
 

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:39.309
This is a bad picture.
 

00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:46.730
Here's my cone.
 

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:47.949
Take two circles.
 

00:43:47.949 --> 00:43:48.980
Well again, I screwed up.
 

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.320
This is supposed to be circles.
 

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.909
This is the center.
 

00:43:51.909 --> 00:43:57.027
That radius is to that height
what this radius is to this

00:43:57.027 --> 00:43:57.849
height.
 

00:43:57.849 --> 00:44:00.090
They're just similar triangles.
 

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:03.692
Therefore, this height is what
I'm calling r_1

00:44:03.692 --> 00:44:07.119
and this height is what I'm
calling r_2.

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:09.474
Therefore, if this radius is
proportional to r_2

00:44:09.474 --> 00:44:11.909
the area of that circle is
Πr_2^(2).

00:44:11.909 --> 00:44:14.440
This is
Πr_1^(2).

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.402
So that'll go like that
distance squared is to that

00:44:19.402 --> 00:44:21.289
distance squared.
 

00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:24.980
Okay, whenever you scale things
for an area by factor of 2 it'll

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.090
go like the square of that
factor.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:30.139
You can already see that if you
draw these cones this'll

00:44:30.139 --> 00:44:33.190
intersect the circle,
the sphere on the small circle.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.840
This will intercept it on a
bigger circle.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.711
That much is clear,
but the extra is not linearly

00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:38.610
proportional.
 

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.626
it is quadratic because the
circle has two dimensions both

00:44:41.626 --> 00:44:44.802
of which are growing linearly
with the distance from the apex

00:44:44.802 --> 00:44:45.650
of the cone.
 

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:51.940
That's why it's r
squared.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:45:06.760
All right, another thing one
can calculate is

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:15.380
the electric field due to an
infinitely long wire.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:23.000
Here's an infinitely long wire
with lambda coulombs per meter.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.949
So you want to find the
electric field.

00:45:25.949 --> 00:45:31.074
By the way, I should tell you
that Gauss's Law--let me do this

00:45:31.074 --> 00:45:32.250
one example.
 

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.360
I'll tell you what the
restriction of Gauss's Law is.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.782
So we come to this problem and
we can again argue by symmetry

00:45:38.782 --> 00:45:42.909
the field lines have to be
radially away from the axis of

00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:46.311
their line,
and if you look at it from the

00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:51.934
edge,
from one edge it'll look like

00:45:51.934 --> 00:45:52.989
this.
 

00:45:52.989 --> 00:45:55.244
If you look at the wire from
the edge the lines should be

00:45:55.244 --> 00:45:56.130
going out like that.
 

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:57.980
It's like a hedgehog but it's
cylindrical.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.619
It's not in all three
dimensions.

00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:03.369
It's radial in this direction.
 

00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:06.713
And the question is and the
field has to be constant along

00:46:06.713 --> 00:46:09.998
the length of the infinite wire
at each point at the same

00:46:09.998 --> 00:46:13.635
distance because if you move the
wire horizontally it looks the

00:46:13.635 --> 00:46:16.510
same so the field distribution
cannot vary.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.750
If it is a finite wire you
cannot make the argument.

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:23.614
In a finite wire as you come
near the edges lines will start

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:24.268
tilting.
 

00:46:24.268 --> 00:46:27.320
But a finite wire doesn't look
the same when you move it;

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.099
an infinite wire does.
 

00:46:29.099 --> 00:46:32.485
Therefore, for an infinite wire
if you don't stop here the lines

00:46:32.485 --> 00:46:35.496
will always look the same,
so that if you shift them over

00:46:35.496 --> 00:46:37.110
they should look the same.
 

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:41.858
So the only unknown question is
- I know the field is in this

00:46:41.858 --> 00:46:46.608
direction radially away from the
wire in all directions whose

00:46:46.608 --> 00:46:50.329
magnitude is fixed at a distance
r,

00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:53.590
but I want to know what the
magnitude is.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:57.597
Again, I'm going to take
Gauss's Law and I'm going to

00:46:57.597 --> 00:47:00.139
apply to the following surface.
 

00:47:00.139 --> 00:47:08.561
Surface is a cylinder and the
cylinder has some length

00:47:08.561 --> 00:47:11.726
l,
and it's got some radius

00:47:11.726 --> 00:47:14.820
r and the flat faces of
the cylinder are parallel,

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:29.927
so if you really want to give
the nice picture here they look

00:47:29.927 --> 00:47:32.949
like this.
 

00:47:32.949 --> 00:47:35.619
So Gauss's Law can be applied
only to a closed surface.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:36.768
You understand that?
 

00:47:36.768 --> 00:47:40.248
You cannot do it for an open
surface because only if you trap

00:47:40.248 --> 00:47:43.668
the charge completely in all
directions will you count every

00:47:43.668 --> 00:47:44.190
line.
 

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:46.902
If you've got holes in your
surface then stuff can escape

00:47:46.902 --> 00:47:48.550
and you cannot promise anything.
 

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.661
So I need a closed surface and
my closed surface is the

00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:53.500
cylinder.
 

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.115
So I'm going to write,
once again, the surface

00:47:56.115 --> 00:47:59.603
integral of the electric field
on that cylinder is the charge

00:47:59.603 --> 00:48:00.360
enclosed.
 

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.150
The charge enclosed is the
easiest part.

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:06.260
I'm going to give you 10
seconds to think in your head.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:11.480
What is a charge enclosed by
the cylinder?

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.789
Okay?
 

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:16.063
It's charge per unit length
times the length of wire trapped

00:48:16.063 --> 00:48:20.548
inside the cylinder and then,
of course, I have this

00:48:20.548 --> 00:48:24.489
1/ε_0.
 

00:48:24.489 --> 00:48:27.530
It still is a statement about
the integral of E on the

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.519
surface, and it could be any
surface, but the beauty of this

00:48:30.519 --> 00:48:31.989
surface is the following.
 

00:48:31.989 --> 00:48:34.806
There are contributions to
E⋅dA from

00:48:34.806 --> 00:48:38.280
the curvy side of the cylinder
and from the flat side.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.373
In the flat side the surface
vector, area vector dA

00:48:42.373 --> 00:48:46.179
for any small portion,
or in fact for the entire face,

00:48:46.179 --> 00:48:47.400
is like that.
 

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.780
The electric field runs along
that face so the dot product is

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.139
0.
 

00:48:53.139 --> 00:48:58.333
So I got 0 from the left side,
0 from the right side,

00:48:58.333 --> 00:49:02.929
then I got non-zero from the
curvy cylinder.

00:49:02.929 --> 00:49:07.570
On the curved cylinder you can,
I hope, see that every area

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:11.489
vector is actually parallel to
the field lines.

00:49:11.489 --> 00:49:16.628
So just like on a sphere this
integral will be E(r) times the

00:49:16.628 --> 00:49:21.679
surface of the curvy part of the
cylinder which is 2Πr

00:49:21.679 --> 00:49:23.650
times L.
 

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:27.489
That's the area of the curved
part of the cylinder.

00:49:27.489 --> 00:49:30.300
So you see L cancels
out, and it better cancel out

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.760
because L is an
artificial construction.

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.768
We made up L.
 

00:49:34.768 --> 00:49:37.380
The answer should not depend on
the Gaussian surface you picked.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.050
I told you it's a figment of
our imagination,

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:44.753
so it doesn't depend on it,
and we find E(r)

00:49:44.753 --> 00:49:48.880
= λ/2Πε
_0r,

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.885
which is the result we got
earlier on by doing all the

00:49:52.885 --> 00:49:54.849
brute force integration.
 

00:49:54.849 --> 00:49:57.550
Remember we took a point here.
 

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:58.530
We took some segment.
 

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.637
We drew the arrows,
did the integrals,

00:50:01.637 --> 00:50:05.922
sine thetas and whatnot,
but you can get that in one

00:50:05.922 --> 00:50:06.679
shot.
 

00:50:06.679 --> 00:50:10.313
So it looks like Gauss's Law is
the easy way to do stuff,

00:50:10.313 --> 00:50:13.621
and you may wonder why we
bother to do any difficult

00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:14.530
integrals.
 

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:19.152
The reason is that if I change
the symmetry of the problem in

00:50:19.152 --> 00:50:22.929
the slightest way I cannot
calculate the field.

00:50:22.929 --> 00:50:26.476
For example,
if on the spherical charge

00:50:26.476 --> 00:50:31.891
distribution instead of a sphere
I made a little blip here,

00:50:31.891 --> 00:50:36.840
maybe did a little surgery and
put that guy here.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.260
We're dead.
 

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.724
I mean, there's a formula for
the field, but no one can

00:50:41.724 --> 00:50:43.230
calculate it in any simple way.
 

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:46.233
You can, again,
take a Gaussian surface and

00:50:46.233 --> 00:50:50.382
it'll still be true that the
integral of the electric field

00:50:50.382 --> 00:50:54.172
on that surface will be the same
Q/ε

00:50:54.172 --> 00:50:58.108
_0,
but the problem is the E

00:50:58.108 --> 00:51:00.829
on the surface is no longer
constant.

00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:01.610
You understand?
 

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:04.260
Not every point is symmetric
any more.

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.420
E may be stronger where
there's a bulge.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.666
E may be weaker where
there is hole,

00:51:08.666 --> 00:51:11.610
so and also its direction is
changing in a crazy way.

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.971
So you can make one true
statement about the integral of

00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:15.860
that crazy function over the
whole region.

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:20.376
That cannot be used to deduce
the value of E at every

00:51:20.376 --> 00:51:20.989
point.
 

00:51:20.989 --> 00:51:22.610
So you still need the integral.
 

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:25.059
You may have to do the integral
maybe on a computer,

00:51:25.059 --> 00:51:26.780
but that's the answer to all
problems,

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:32.331
but for simple problems with a
great deal of symmetry we can

00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:37.130
use Gauss's Law to get these
things very easily,

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.670
okay?
 

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:42.570
That's the Gauss.
 

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:46.221
Now, I'm going to introduce you
to a second notion which is

00:51:46.221 --> 00:51:49.494
pretty important to study
electricity, and that's the

00:51:49.494 --> 00:51:51.070
notion of conductors.
 

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:54.960
So we're going to divide the
world into two things,

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.139
conductors and insulators.
 

00:51:57.139 --> 00:51:59.648
As you know,
matter is made up of positive

00:51:59.648 --> 00:52:03.012
and negative charges and the
negative charges circle the

00:52:03.012 --> 00:52:05.983
positive charges,
and they pretty much stay near

00:52:05.983 --> 00:52:09.557
their parent atoms,
near the parent nuclei,

00:52:09.557 --> 00:52:12.739
and you cannot separate them.
 

00:52:12.739 --> 00:52:17.443
But in a metal at least some of
the electrons from each atom

00:52:17.443 --> 00:52:18.880
become communal.
 

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.967
In other words,
they can run around the whole

00:52:21.967 --> 00:52:22.530
solid.
 

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:25.769
They don't belong to any one
nucleus.

00:52:25.769 --> 00:52:26.719
So that's a conductor.
 

00:52:26.719 --> 00:52:30.853
In a conductor the negative
charges, if you like,

00:52:30.853 --> 00:52:32.489
are free to move.
 

00:52:32.489 --> 00:52:41.150
So here's the first result.
 

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:46.480
E is equal to 0 inside a
conductor.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.130
That really follows from the
meaning of the word conductor.

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:54.110
If you took a chunk of perfect
conductor, maybe copper is good

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:57.141
enough;
they'll be no electric field

00:52:57.141 --> 00:52:58.530
inside copper.
 

00:52:58.530 --> 00:52:59.670
Why?
 

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.780
Because if this is the chunk of
material,

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.652
this electric field,
then the charges that I said

00:53:05.652 --> 00:53:09.362
are free to move will respond to
the electric field and they'll

00:53:09.362 --> 00:53:10.199
be moving.
 

00:53:10.199 --> 00:53:15.367
So I should say E equal
to 0 inside a conductor in a

00:53:15.367 --> 00:53:17.059
static situation.
 

00:53:17.059 --> 00:53:20.702
In other words,
once the charges have stopped

00:53:20.702 --> 00:53:25.090
moving the electric field will
be 0 in a conductor.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:28.824
Let me explain to you a little
more what's going on so it's not

00:53:28.824 --> 00:53:29.789
a big mystery.
 

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:36.717
Suppose there is a uniform
electric field going from left

00:53:36.717 --> 00:53:38.079
to right?
 

00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:42.740
In that uniform field I take a
chunk of copper like a nice

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.340
rectangular chunk and I stick it
in there.

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:49.179
What will happen?
 

00:53:49.179 --> 00:53:52.784
In the beginning the electric
field will penetrate the copper

00:53:52.784 --> 00:53:55.849
and the field lines say to the
positive charges,

00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:57.692
"You go to the
right," and to the negative

00:53:57.692 --> 00:53:59.969
charges,
"You go to the left."

00:53:59.969 --> 00:54:03.425
Negative charges will race to
the left until they cannot go

00:54:03.425 --> 00:54:05.630
anymore without leaving the
solid,

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:07.480
and that they're not allowed to
do,

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:13.519
leaving behind some deficit on
the other side.

00:54:13.519 --> 00:54:15.250
But look what's happening now.
 

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:20.875
These guys produce their own
electric field which goes from

00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:22.329
here to here.
 

00:54:22.329 --> 00:54:25.219
Therefore, inside the
conductor, the electric field by

00:54:25.219 --> 00:54:28.217
the superposition principle is
the field due to whatever

00:54:28.217 --> 00:54:30.400
outside agency produced this
field,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.952
plus the field due to these
guys, and they will not stop

00:54:34.952 --> 00:54:39.672
until the field they produced
exactly cancels the external

00:54:39.672 --> 00:54:40.500
field.
 

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:44.610
Then the migration will stop.
 

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:46.289
So how do they know when to
stop?

00:54:46.289 --> 00:54:47.599
They are not that smart, right?
 

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:51.239
But the point is once they've
produced the potential,

00:54:51.239 --> 00:54:55.088
I mean, once they produce the
field that cancels the external

00:54:55.088 --> 00:54:58.552
field there'll be no field
inside the bulk to encourage

00:54:58.552 --> 00:55:02.530
charges to move any more and
that's when they stop moving.

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:05.030
Okay, so a conductor,
at least in this case,

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:07.880
not so hard to understand what
they have to do.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.170
Negative charges go to one side.
 

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:13.168
Positive go to the other side
until the field they produce is

00:55:13.168 --> 00:55:17.099
an arrow going to the left of
the same magnitude as this one

00:55:17.099 --> 00:55:19.099
then E is 0 inside.
 

00:55:19.099 --> 00:55:25.007
But what's amazing about these
metals is that if you take a

00:55:25.007 --> 00:55:30.509
potato shaped metal it's not so
easy to see what charge

00:55:30.509 --> 00:55:36.110
arrangement will exactly
neutralize the field everywhere

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:37.639
in sight.
 

00:55:37.639 --> 00:55:38.679
Here it's easy to see.
 

00:55:38.679 --> 00:55:41.829
I want a right moving one
canceled with a left moving one.

00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:44.030
I draw a line,
a plane of charges here and

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:46.230
here, and you can see they will
cancel.

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:49.690
But even this oddball object,
I claim,

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:52.059
will eventually acquire some
density of charges,

00:55:52.059 --> 00:55:55.987
they're not uniform or
anything, in some complicated

00:55:55.987 --> 00:56:00.070
fashion until the field inside
the solid becomes 0.

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:05.407
So these particles will always
figure out a way to make the

00:56:05.407 --> 00:56:09.639
field 0 inside,
because it's the definition.

00:56:09.639 --> 00:56:12.489
If it's not 0 they've got more
work to do,

00:56:12.489 --> 00:56:15.503
and the charges have to
separate even more until there

00:56:15.503 --> 00:56:19.030
is no hunger for the separation
because they managed to produce

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:20.679
a field inside that is 0.
 

00:56:20.679 --> 00:56:23.579
Then nobody else will join this
flow and it'll stop.

00:56:23.579 --> 00:56:26.947
So that's a very short period,
10 to the minus something,

00:56:26.947 --> 00:56:30.556
when charges rearrange when you
put a conductor in the field,

00:56:30.556 --> 00:56:32.239
then quickly it'll stop.
 

00:56:32.239 --> 00:56:35.130
If you put an alternating field
going back and forth then,

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:37.530
of course, it depends on how
rapidly it's oscillating,

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:39.880
and charges may not be able to
keep up with that.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.650
That's called a plasma
frequency, and beyond that a

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:45.920
field would start penetrating
because charges cannot keep in

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.420
step.
 

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.268
But a DC field,
where you've got all the time

00:56:48.268 --> 00:56:50.706
in the world to settle down,
they will very quickly come to

00:56:50.706 --> 00:56:51.590
this arrangement.
 

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:53.309
They will stop.
 

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:59.389
So remember field in a
conductor is 0 by definition.

00:56:59.389 --> 00:57:14.369
Okay, now the next thing I will
show you is that charge inside a

00:57:14.369 --> 00:57:19.840
conductor equal to 0.
 

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.268
By that I mean the following.
 

00:57:22.268 --> 00:57:28.474
If you took a conductor and you
threw some charge on it where

00:57:28.474 --> 00:57:29.820
will it go?
 

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.340
Okay, here's a chunk of copper.
 

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.780
Throw 10 million electrons.
 

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.820
Well, the 10 million electrons
don't like each other.

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.960
They will try to run away from
each other.

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.954
In the end they will all sit
somewhere here,

00:57:41.954 --> 00:57:47.344
but they will sit in such a way
that the field inside is 0,

00:57:47.344 --> 00:57:51.619
because you cannot have an
electric field.

00:57:51.619 --> 00:57:54.333
If the electric field is 0
everywhere then the charge is

00:57:54.333 --> 00:57:56.327
also 0 everywhere,
because you can take any

00:57:56.327 --> 00:57:58.242
surface, any volume you like
with the integral of

00:57:58.242 --> 00:58:02.159
E⋅dA,
you're going to get 0.

00:58:02.159 --> 00:58:04.909
If you can get
E⋅dA is 0 for

00:58:04.909 --> 00:58:08.195
every possible surface then the
charge enclosed by every

00:58:08.195 --> 00:58:11.449
possible surface is 0,
therefore there is no charge in

00:58:11.449 --> 00:58:11.820
sight.
 

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.329
So where does the charge go?
 

00:58:13.329 --> 00:58:15.900
It goes to the boundary of the
metal.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.849
Once they're at the boundary of
the metal the metal starts

00:58:19.849 --> 00:58:23.728
calling you back because there
is something called a work

00:58:23.728 --> 00:58:24.630
function.
 

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:27.289
It's like all the electrons in
a swimming pool.

00:58:27.289 --> 00:58:29.155
If they don't like each other
they can go to the edge of the

00:58:29.155 --> 00:58:30.512
pool,
but to leave the pool they've

00:58:30.512 --> 00:58:32.110
got to climb up over the
vertical walls,

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:34.619
and they cannot scale the walls.
 

00:58:34.619 --> 00:58:36.340
If you rip them hard enough
they will.

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.273
If you put enough charges,
charges will start flying from

00:58:39.273 --> 00:58:43.018
here and maybe land there;
that we call lightening.

00:58:43.018 --> 00:58:47.351
For that they'll have to break
the air and produce a conducting

00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:51.612
path, but if you don't put such
strong fields the charges will

00:58:51.612 --> 00:58:53.429
remain on the surface.
 

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:57.487
Now, it turns out we can
actually relate the electric

00:58:57.487 --> 00:59:02.092
field at the surface to the
charge density of the surface by

00:59:02.092 --> 00:59:03.809
a following trick.
 

00:59:03.809 --> 00:59:05.686
Let's go to the surface here
and ask, "What's the

00:59:05.686 --> 00:59:06.289
electric field?
 

00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:07.909
Which way can it point?"
 

00:59:07.909 --> 00:59:14.085
I claim the electric field can
only point perpendicular to the

00:59:14.085 --> 00:59:16.494
surface,
because if you had parallel

00:59:16.494 --> 00:59:19.179
components then the charges can
move along the surface.

00:59:19.179 --> 00:59:21.746
No one says you cannot run it
on the edge of the swimming

00:59:21.746 --> 00:59:23.260
pool, you just cannot leave it.
 

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:26.771
So the electric field lines
must point radial,

00:59:26.771 --> 00:59:29.268
I mean, normal to the surface.
 

00:59:29.268 --> 00:59:32.739
And I claim that we can
actually calculate the electric

00:59:32.739 --> 00:59:35.889
field here if you knew the
charge density here.

00:59:35.889 --> 00:59:37.570
So let's do that.
 

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:43.851
So here's some surface,
and I have--take a tiny region

00:59:43.851 --> 00:59:50.963
here and I'm going to take a
Gaussian surface that looks like

00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:52.030
this.
 

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:54.983
It's a cylinder,
very tiny cylinder,

00:59:54.983 --> 00:59:58.530
and the field lines are like
that there.

00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:02.050
There is no field lines here
because there's no field inside.

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:05.501
And the field here all of these
things are 0,

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:10.132
and the field here is parallel
to the cylinder so it doesn't

01:00:10.132 --> 01:00:11.309
contribute.
 

01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:11.880
You see that?
 

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.699
I got a cylinder.
 

01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:14.150
I rammed it into this solid.
 

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:17.110
It's a mathematical Gaussian
surface.

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:19.820
It's got following faces,
flat face,

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.409
no E because there's
nothing inside the metal,

01:00:22.409 --> 01:00:24.400
this part of the curvy-face,
no E,

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.949
nothing inside the metal.
 

01:00:25.949 --> 01:00:28.447
Here E is parallel to
the sides of the cylinder,

01:00:28.447 --> 01:00:29.420
so there's no flux.
 

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.512
The top end,
if the area's A or

01:00:32.512 --> 01:00:35.534
dA,
the top end will have a flux

01:00:35.534 --> 01:00:39.681
which will be the E that
I'm trying to calculate times

01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:40.579
dA.
 

01:00:40.579 --> 01:00:44.271
That's going to be equal to the
charge enclosed is

01:00:44.271 --> 01:00:48.039
σdA/
ε_0,

01:00:48.039 --> 01:00:52.474
because σ
is the charge density which I

01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:54.389
assume I'm given.
 

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:57.239
Then you can see the dA
cancels.

01:00:57.239 --> 01:01:11.018
The electric field is
σ/ε_0.

01:01:11.018 --> 01:01:15.932
Do you remember ever seeing a
formula like this sigma or

01:01:15.932 --> 01:01:17.809
anything like this?
 

01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:24.860
Yes?
 

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.480
Okay.
 

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:33.679
Let me remind you where you saw
it.

01:01:33.679 --> 01:01:38.867
I showed you that if you took
an infinite plane of charge

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:42.295
density σ
the electric field was

01:01:42.295 --> 01:01:47.215
σ/2ε_0,
and I did that with a long

01:01:47.215 --> 01:01:48.010
calculation.
 

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:48.920
I took a point there.
 

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.050
I took rings and so on.
 

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.268
Now, you don't have to do that.
 

01:01:53.268 --> 01:01:56.570
Let's use Gauss's Law again to
calculate it.

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:59.902
Once again, you argue that if
you're in front of an infinite

01:01:59.902 --> 01:02:03.349
plane the only distribution of
field lines that makes sense is

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:06.739
if the field line's always
perpendicular to the surface.

01:02:06.739 --> 01:02:08.929
They can get weaker as you go
away,

01:02:08.929 --> 01:02:11.240
but at a given distance from
the plane they should have the

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.684
same value,
because if you slide the plane

01:02:13.684 --> 01:02:15.760
up and down it shouldn't matter.
 

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.809
So let's take the side view of
the plane.

01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:19.869
There are your charges.
 

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:23.090
And I'm going to take a
Gaussian cylinder that looks

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:23.849
like this.
 

01:02:23.849 --> 01:02:26.409
The field lines are going like
that.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.518
They're going like that.
 

01:02:27.518 --> 01:02:30.409
There is some charge trapped
here.

01:02:30.409 --> 01:02:37.670
And the area of that guy is
some dA.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:40.268
So again, I apply Gauss's Law
here.

01:02:40.268 --> 01:02:43.610
Of the cylinder I got the curvy
sides with no contribution,

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:46.489
because the field is parallel
to the curvy side.

01:02:46.489 --> 01:02:48.429
I got the flat faces.
 

01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:50.961
So I get E times
dA for one of them,

01:02:50.961 --> 01:02:53.338
and E times dA
for the other one,

01:02:53.338 --> 01:02:54.889
because both are outgoing.
 

01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:57.579
That is equal to charge
enclosed with the σ

01:02:57.579 --> 01:03:00.440
times dA divided by
ε_0.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.039
If you cancel the dA you
find E is

01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:08.268
σ/2ε_0.
 

01:03:08.268 --> 01:03:10.856
So the electric field on either
side of the plane is

01:03:10.856 --> 01:03:12.530
σ/2ε_0.
 

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:14.369
You just get it from Gauss's
Law.

01:03:14.369 --> 01:03:18.380
Again, there's no reason to do
the complicated integral.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.900
That's because we've reduced
everything to one unknown,

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.469
namely what was the magnitude
of the electric field at a

01:03:23.469 --> 01:03:25.150
certain distance from the plane?
 

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:28.485
Direction is known to be
perpendicular and to be constant

01:03:28.485 --> 01:03:29.380
on this line.
 

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:33.369
Then the one number came out to
be, in fact, independent of how

01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:34.268
far you are.
 

01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:36.929
But now go back to the
conductor.

01:03:36.929 --> 01:03:41.541
If you go back to the conductor
you find the field at the

01:03:41.541 --> 01:03:45.989
surface of a conductor is
σ/ε_0

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.860
where σ
is the charge density there,

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.534
whereas for an infinite plane
it's

01:03:51.534 --> 01:03:53.969
σ/2ε_0
on either side.

01:03:53.969 --> 01:03:56.018
And you can ask,
what's going on?

01:03:56.018 --> 01:04:00.050
Why is it
σ/ε_0?

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:04.980
Can anybody guess what may be
happening?

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.135
In other words,
if you take a tiny area on a

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:10.523
conductor and you go very,
very, very close it should be

01:04:10.523 --> 01:04:13.260
as if you're next to an infinite
plane,

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.594
because if you're very,
very close to the surface you

01:04:15.594 --> 01:04:17.389
don't know if it's finite or
infinite.

01:04:17.389 --> 01:04:19.989
So you should get the same
answer as for the infinite

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:20.389
plane.
 

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:24.815
Therefore, if you took only the
charge sitting there it should

01:04:24.815 --> 01:04:27.572
give you
σ/2ε_0

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:30.690
going out and
σ/2ε_0

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:31.780
going in.
 

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.010
In other words,
let me draw a picture here.

01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:34.380
That's my tiny area.
 

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:38.887
I expect the field due to just
the charge there to be like

01:04:38.887 --> 01:04:41.940
this,
σ/2ε_0,

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:46.710
and
σ/2ε_0.

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:51.157
But that is not the whole story
because I've got the rest of the

01:04:51.157 --> 01:04:53.840
conductor that's got its own
charge.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.789
It is going to produce a field.
 

01:04:56.789 --> 01:05:00.831
That field will have some
value, and I claim I know the

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.480
value of that field.
 

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.219
It'll be precisely enough to
cancel it on the inside,

01:05:07.219 --> 01:05:10.818
but if you cancel it on the
inside you'll double it on the

01:05:10.818 --> 01:05:14.228
outside because it's got
σ/2ε_0

01:05:14.228 --> 01:05:16.880
pointing outwards to cancel this
guy,

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.849
but then it'll aid the one due
to the little area by doubling

01:05:20.849 --> 01:05:21.179
it.
 

01:05:21.179 --> 01:05:23.471
That's why it's
σ/ε_0

01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:24.670
outside and 0 inside.
 

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.539
In other words,
here is the full story.

01:05:26.539 --> 01:05:29.981
If you go to a conductor,
if you pick a region here,

01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:33.760
the field at this point is due
to what's here and what is

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.110
everywhere else.
 

01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:39.030
What is here does that as if it
was an infinite plane.

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:45.849
The rest of the guys do that
and that cancels this here,

01:05:45.849 --> 01:05:50.063
but adds there,
so you can see more

01:05:50.063 --> 01:05:54.280
ε_0 outside.
 

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.050
Okay, then there are other
variations to this theme.

01:05:57.050 --> 01:06:01.045
So here's a conductor,
and I make a hole in it,

01:06:01.045 --> 01:06:03.130
and I put some charge.
 

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:07.940
You can ask if I throw some
charge on it where will it sit.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:12.971
Well, some charges will sit
here if you put some coulombs,

01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:16.590
but what will happen on the
inner wall?

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:21.190
This is a hole.
 

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:23.929
The claim is that there'll be
no charges here.

01:06:23.929 --> 01:06:26.889
They'll all be outside even
though you've got a hole in the

01:06:26.889 --> 01:06:27.349
middle.
 

01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:29.719
Again, Gauss's Law tells you
why.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:33.175
If I take a surface like this
and do Gauss's Law,

01:06:33.175 --> 01:06:36.485
since the electric field is 0
inside the metal,

01:06:36.485 --> 01:06:38.429
Q enclosed is 0.
 

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:40.960
So the Q that's
enclosed, which is 0,

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.119
means that maybe some positive
guys and some negative guys,

01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:48.619
but there's nothing from
stopping the positive guys from

01:06:48.619 --> 01:06:51.800
rushing to meet the negative
guys and canceling.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.670
They will, for there is no
reason they just stay on

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:54.829
opposite sides of the island.
 

01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:58.280
They'll just come together.
 

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.657
Therefore, there is no stable
equilibrium in which the charges

01:07:01.657 --> 01:07:03.539
will be ever inside a conductor.
 

01:07:03.539 --> 01:07:07.510
So if you have a conductor and
you put charge on it,

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:11.869
it goes to the surface even if
there are holes inside the

01:07:11.869 --> 01:07:12.960
conductor.
 

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.539
Now, that's a very interesting
paradox.

01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:19.023
I showed you that the field
inside a conductor even if

01:07:19.023 --> 01:07:22.114
there's a hole is 0,
but let's ask the following

01:07:22.114 --> 01:07:22.969
question.
 

01:07:22.969 --> 01:07:26.672
I take a conductor with the
hole in it and I put a charge

01:07:26.672 --> 01:07:27.730
q here.
 

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:32.239
Will you know about it from the
outside?

01:07:32.239 --> 01:07:33.510
You're not allowed to enter it.
 

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:38.969
Will you know from the outside
there's a charge inside or will

01:07:38.969 --> 01:07:41.030
it get also shielded?
 

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:47.460
Will there be any flux lines
coming out here?

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:47.780
Yep?
 

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.949
Student:  Yes.
 

01:07:48.949 --> 01:07:49.880
Prof: Because?
 

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.230
Student:  Because
there's a charge.

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.730
Prof: Right.
 

01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:57.255
If there are no field lines
here, and I do Gauss's Law on

01:07:57.255 --> 01:07:59.769
this surface,
if the surface integral of

01:07:59.769 --> 01:08:01.788
E is 0
q_enclosed is

01:08:01.788 --> 01:08:05.112
0,
but I know there is some

01:08:05.112 --> 01:08:07.269
q inside.
 

01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:09.210
So what's going to happen?
 

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:13.820
I want the field lines to be
present here and absent here.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.993
So what'll happen is if you put
a q here the material

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:22.024
conductor will separate into
-q's where these lines

01:08:22.024 --> 01:08:27.305
can terminate,
and then out here will be some

01:08:27.305 --> 01:08:33.863
compensating plus charges
that'll produce the field

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:38.979
that'll produce the lines going
out.

01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:43.123
In other words,
this is really like a chunk of

01:08:43.123 --> 01:08:48.557
copper I showed you where it
screens the field by polarizing

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:53.899
into a negative part in this
wall and positive contribution

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:59.149
in the outer wall so that inside
there is no field.

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:03.680
Okay, so these are different
variations of this theme and you

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.210
should be able to do a whole
bunch of problems connected with

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:08.890
that.
 

01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:13.850
Okay, I've used up my board,
so I think I'll give you guys a

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:18.895
five minute tour on how to do
these integrals in case it ever

01:09:18.895 --> 01:09:19.988
comes up.
 

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:22.659
I'm just going to do two very
trivial integrals and stop,

01:09:22.659 --> 01:09:25.474
and I'm going to do them in two
dimensions and you can worry

01:09:25.474 --> 01:09:26.810
about higher dimensions.
 

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:28.640
It's just generalization.
 

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.778
Suppose you're in the xy
plane and there's a function in

01:09:34.778 --> 01:09:39.827
the xy plane,
f (x, y), and someone says find

01:09:39.827 --> 01:09:41.609
f (x,y) dx dy.
 

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:45.283
What's the procedure and what
are you supposed to do is the

01:09:45.283 --> 01:09:45.979
question.
 

01:09:45.979 --> 01:09:49.225
What you do in Cartesian
coordinates is you take a line

01:09:49.225 --> 01:09:52.481
y equal to something,
y equal to something

01:09:52.481 --> 01:09:54.621
delta y,
x equal to something,

01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:56.649
x equal to something
delta x,

01:09:56.649 --> 01:09:59.063
and that region (bounded) by
these contours of constant

01:09:59.063 --> 01:10:01.832
x at different values and
constant y at different

01:10:01.832 --> 01:10:05.380
values,
has an area dxdy.

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:08.390
You multiply that area by this
function.

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:10.655
This could be the number of
people living per square mile

01:10:10.655 --> 01:10:12.600
and this could be the number of
square miles,

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.649
and you add up all the little
squares over the area that was

01:10:16.649 --> 01:10:17.680
given to you.
 

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.567
So whoever tells you to do
integrals better tell you over

01:10:21.567 --> 01:10:24.760
what range you're going to do
that integral.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.600
Okay?
 

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:33.979
So let's find out the area for
triangle by this process.

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:35.788
Here's a triangle.
 

01:10:35.788 --> 01:10:40.289
Let's say there's one here and
one here, 0,1;

01:10:40.289 --> 01:10:41.279
1,0.
 

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:42.380
This is y.
 

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:42.939
This is x.
 

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:44.760
I want to find the area of the
triangle.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.520
Yep?
 

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.689
Student:  Isn't that
point 1,1?

01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:50.159
Prof: Yes, thank you.
 

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:52.560
That point is 1,1.
 

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.640
You're supposed to take
dxdy you write it like

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.189
this.
 

01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:58.279
There's no function or integral.
 

01:10:58.279 --> 01:11:01.282
I just want 1 times
dxdy, so the 1 is

01:11:01.282 --> 01:11:02.050
implicit.
 

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:08.078
dy, you pick a certain
x and y should go

01:11:08.078 --> 01:11:10.090
from here to here.
 

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:13.300
The range of y is
clearly 1 - x because

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.770
this is a curve x
y = 1.

01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:20.967
So y goes from 0 to 1 -
x, and for every choice

01:11:20.967 --> 01:11:24.520
of x, x goes from
0 to 1.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.229
Yep?
 

01:11:25.229 --> 01:11:28.789
Student:  Isn't the line
defined as y = x ________.

01:11:28.789 --> 01:11:29.590
Prof: Pardon me?
 

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:30.020
Student:  Is the line
________?

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:30.810
Prof: Oh, let me see.
 

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:31.210
No, no.
 

01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:33.698
This is not the equation of the
line.

01:11:33.698 --> 01:11:41.020
This height here is equal to 1
- x.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.720
Oh, you think that's wrong?
 

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.960
Student: 
&gt;

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.296
Prof: The height of
y, isn't there 1 -

01:11:49.296 --> 01:11:49.800
x?
 

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.590
Student: 
&gt;

01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:51.649
Prof: Or it's just
x.

01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:52.670
I'm sorry.
 

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:54.930
Okay, caught on tape.
 

01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:58.029
Very good.
 

01:11:58.029 --> 01:12:04.899
All right, so here is x,
goes up to x and the

01:12:04.899 --> 01:12:10.350
y integral you do it as
lower limit,

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:13.108
upper limit gives you an
x and x goes from

01:12:13.108 --> 01:12:13.560
0 to 1.
 

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.649
That gives you x^(2)/2
from 0 to 1.

01:12:16.649 --> 01:12:22.819
That gives you 1 over 2.
 

01:12:22.819 --> 01:12:26.125
If you had a function of
x and y you wanted

01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:27.925
to integrate,
in other words instead of just

01:12:27.925 --> 01:12:29.484
the number one,
if you had a function of

01:12:29.484 --> 01:12:31.680
x and y the rule
is the following.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.365
You put the function here,
and put x equal to a

01:12:35.365 --> 01:12:38.055
fixed value,
don't take it as a variable,

01:12:38.055 --> 01:12:41.172
and treat y as a
variable and do dy from

01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:42.819
this limit to this limit.
 

01:12:42.819 --> 01:12:47.255
When you are done you will get
some mass that depends only on

01:12:47.255 --> 01:12:50.359
x that you integrate from
0 to 1.

01:12:50.359 --> 01:12:55.373
But the final thing I'm going
to do is to do the same integral

01:12:55.373 --> 01:12:59.319
in polar coordinates,
area of a triangle in polar

01:12:59.319 --> 01:13:01.948
coordinates looks like this.
 

01:13:01.948 --> 01:13:04.670
In polar coordinates,
as you know,

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:08.738
you draw circles of r
and r dr,

01:13:08.738 --> 01:13:12.920
and lines at θ and
θ dθ,

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.307
and this shaded region here has
got one side equal to

01:13:17.307 --> 01:13:22.118
rdθ and the other
side equal to dr.

01:13:22.118 --> 01:13:26.787
So area integral will look like
rdrdθ times some

01:13:26.787 --> 01:13:31.065
function of r and
θ over the allowed

01:13:31.065 --> 01:13:35.177
region,
but I want to do now a triangle

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:37.640
of height 1 and base 1.
 

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.729
Here's what I do.
 

01:13:39.729 --> 01:13:43.091
I'm going to pick theta first
and hold it fixed,

01:13:43.091 --> 01:13:45.739
and theta will go from 0 to
Π/4.

01:13:45.739 --> 01:13:46.819
Can you see that?
 

01:13:46.819 --> 01:13:48.970
This is supposed to be a square.
 

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:52.282
Theta goes from 0 to
Π/4,

01:13:52.282 --> 01:13:54.619
and I have rdr.
 

01:13:54.619 --> 01:13:58.689
What is the range of r?
 

01:13:58.689 --> 01:14:00.500
How far is this thing?
 

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.935
You can see that if this angle
is theta then

01:14:03.935 --> 01:14:07.931
rcosθ is 1,
and for r is

01:14:07.931 --> 01:14:09.850
1/cosθ.
 

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:14.640
So r dr is really
d of r squared.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:21.226
d of r squared is
equal to d of

01:14:21.226 --> 01:14:25.489
1/cos^(2)θ,
right?

01:14:25.489 --> 01:14:26.439
I mean, let me do it this way.
 

01:14:26.439 --> 01:14:34.742
d of r squared is
r^(2)/2 from 1/cosθ

01:14:34.742 --> 01:14:36.288
to 0.
 

01:14:36.288 --> 01:14:43.890
So that gives me 1/2 integral
dθ 0 to Π/4 of

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:47.238
1/cos^(2)θ.
 

01:14:47.238 --> 01:14:50.229
Well, you may not know this,
but sec^(2)θ is

01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:52.260
the derivative of
tanθ.

01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:56.661
So derivative of integral of
tanθ will turn out

01:14:56.661 --> 01:15:00.764
to be simply tanθ
calculated between Π/4

01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:01.510
and 0.
 

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:04.939
That'll be just 1.
 

01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:08.000
So you're not supposed to
follow at lightening speed this

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:08.930
integral, okay?
 

01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:11.740
Either you've seen it before or
if you need some help you can

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.710
look at my math book I mentioned
to you.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:17.181
All I'm trying to tell you here
is if when you have multiple

01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:20.420
integrals you pick one
coordinate and you freeze it,

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:23.083
for example,
x when you integrate to

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:26.953
the other coordinate over the
allowed region that keeps you in

01:15:26.953 --> 01:15:30.569
the boundary then integrate over
the second variable.

01:15:30.569 --> 01:15:32.496
You may need that,
but for most of the problems

01:15:32.496 --> 01:15:34.130
I've given you won't have to do
that.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.130
They're pretty simple.
 

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:40.000

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.038
Prof: So we are going to
talk today about two of the most

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:10.000
significant episodes of Part II
of the Quixote,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.600
episodes that mark a transition
to--

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.473
that begin the sort of the down
slope of the novel as it moves

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:22.880
towards its conclusion.
 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.427
It is a protracted culmination
and finale consistent

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:33.210
with the slower more deliberate
pace of Part II.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.720
We will be meeting one
character from Part I,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.230
who reappears,
Ginés de Pasamonte,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
under the guise of master
puppeteer Master Peter,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.783
and there will not only be
repetitions of episodes from

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.580
Part I,
but even repetitions of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.720
episodes from Part II within
Part II.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.222
After the episodes that I will
discuss today,

00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:05.849
three major new developments
occur.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:11.232
First, that Don Quixote will
sometimes leave the center of

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:14.819
the action to be replaced by
Sancho.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.834
Second, that both Don Quixote
and Sancho become the objects of

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:24.685
amusement for frivolous upper
class characters who have read

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:25.590
Part I.
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.086
And three, that the protagonist
will be surrounded by many more

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:31.900
characters than before.
 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.653
The overarching theme of the
novel continues to be

00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:42.182
desengaño as most
of the action is staged by

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:44.220
internal authors.
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.640
It is an action that is highly
theatrical and the props or

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.680
backstage of the skits are
revealed to the reader,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.680
either during the performance
or right after.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.153
The first of the two important
episodes is the one about Don

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:06.340
Quixote's descent into
Montesinos cave,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.925
a truly remarkable tour de
force and one of the most

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:17.729
brilliant scenes in the Western
literary tradition.

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:22.616
So Montesinos cave,
this is one of the principle

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:28.956
episodes of Part II and arguably
of the entire work because it

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:34.571
seems to engage the main
literary topics and sources of

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:40.393
the novel and also provides a
rare glimpse into the inner

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:45.280
workings of Don Quixote's
subconscious.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.741
It is as if we were looking
behind the scenes of the

00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:55.800
Quixote or allowed to see
its reverse side,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.655
as we see the reverse side of
that painting within Las

00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:04.990
Meninas that
Velázquez is working on.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.965
It is also as if were allowed
to dissect the protagonist while

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:15.449
he's still alive.
 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:22.664
Let us first notice that this
is an adventure that Don Quixote

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:25.334
seeks,
that he looks for it,

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:28.620
not one that is imposed on him
by chance,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.800
like the encounters on the road
or by other characters who are

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.240
scripting his life.
 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.937
As we have seen,
Sansón Carrasco from the

00:03:36.937 --> 00:03:40.210
very beginning is trying to
script Don Quixote's life,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.997
and there will be several
author internal authors doing

00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:46.878
that,
but this is not the case at all.

00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:51.001
This is an episode,
an adventure that Don Quixote

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:55.008
wants to undertake,
and he tells the scholar or the

00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:58.492
cousin that he wants to do so
and asks how to get to

00:03:58.492 --> 00:03:59.860
Montesinos' cave.
 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.830
It is also an episode that is
strictly Spanish,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.919
and that seems to take Don
Quixote into the depths of the

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.736
Spanish soil:
it is as if saying that these

00:04:14.736 --> 00:04:19.735
kinds of fabulous events also
happen in Spain and in the

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:22.987
present,
although, as you will see,

00:04:22.987 --> 00:04:27.125
and I will speak about the
sources of the episode descents

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:33.362
into caves and so forth,
but this is one that is based

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:38.509
on a Spanish tradition;
that is, people knew about

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.559
Montesinos cave and talked about
it--they exist--and Don Quixote

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:46.452
wanted to go into them;
he decided that he had to have

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.639
this adventure.
 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.571
One way to see the episode as
flowing from Camacho's

00:04:51.571 --> 00:04:55.964
wedding--which is the big
episode preceding it--is through

00:04:55.964 --> 00:04:58.199
its connection with Ovid.
 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.449
The cousin or scholar,
who is their guide,

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.312
is writing a Spanish Ovid,
and the explanation given about

00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:12.245
the rivers of Spain and their
names is in the spirit of the

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.939
Metamorphoses.
 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:20.343
This scholar is another satire
of students and intellectuals,

00:05:20.343 --> 00:05:26.002
like the one that we seen in
the case of Sansón

00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:29.413
Carrasco;
this is even more extreme,

00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:33.774
this is a really ridiculous
scholar who is trying to find

00:05:33.774 --> 00:05:38.290
out who had the first cold in
history, if you remember.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:46.315
And so, I also said that in
Part II of the Quixote

00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:54.339
Cervantes seems to be signaling
as his sources Homer,

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:58.716
Virgil, Ovid and,
as we shall see,

00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:02.654
Dante,
as if claiming that his work is

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:07.259
their worthy successor:
that he's in their league,

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.310
as it were, in common parlance.
 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.084
I will speak about Virgil when
we get to meet Altisidora,

00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:18.687
the character that you will
meet and find very amusing,

00:06:18.687 --> 00:06:21.160
who is a version of Dido.
 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.860
Now, this descent into the cave
has antecedents in the

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.165
Odyssey,
the Aeneid,

00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:30.240
and the Divine Comedy,
of course.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.240
Although there are also sources
in chivalric romances,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.190
this is an adventure on a
higher literary level,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.240
this is not just going back to
episodes in the chivalric

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.050
romances but Homer,
Virgil, Dante.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.827
There are, of course,
also traditional stories about

00:06:55.827 --> 00:07:01.259
going into caves in all cultures
and in all literatures.

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.596
If you have read your American
literature you see that in Tom

00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:07.264
Sawyer,
and Huckleberry Finn,

00:07:07.264 --> 00:07:08.997
and so forth,
there are episodes where the

00:07:08.997 --> 00:07:11.863
characters go into caves,
but here, I think,

00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:15.959
the sources are those that I
mentioned.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:20.629
Going down into the cave has,
of course,

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:25.574
deep psychological resonances,
having to do with Don Quixote's

00:07:25.574 --> 00:07:31.817
sexuality,
and concomitantly his fear of

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.069
death.
 

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:37.990
As he enters the cave he has to
walk away at the brambles

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.615
covering the entrance in actions
that are symbolic or reminiscent

00:07:43.615 --> 00:07:48.526
of a deflowering,
and the blackbirds that fly

00:07:48.526 --> 00:07:53.709
away in fright are clear
intimations of death;

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:57.497
they are bad omens;
they have kind of a

00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:01.480
Hitchcock-like air to me,
I mean, to modern readers.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.624
They, I'm sure,
remind you of that very

00:08:04.624 --> 00:08:08.430
frightening Hitchcock film
The Birds.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:14.432
What Don Quixote experiences in
the cave is a dream and,

00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:19.889
of course, this aligns it with
dream literature.

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:23.992
This is clear by his being
asleep when he is pulled back

00:08:23.992 --> 00:08:26.355
up,
and from the story he tells

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:30.540
about falling asleep when he
sits down on the coiled up rope

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.889
within the cave.
 

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:36.460
Don Quixote says that he wakes
up from that sleep,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.399
but it is obvious that he
awakens within the dream,

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.110
that this is a dream within a
dream,

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.129
another mirror effect.
 

00:08:45.129 --> 00:08:52.332
What the dream allows is for
the untrammeled emergence of Don

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:59.537
Quixote's deepest fears in the
form of stories related to his

00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:04.580
fantasies or drawn from his
fantasies.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.475
It is as if he had been
administered a drug,

00:09:08.475 --> 00:09:12.461
a truth serum,
or as if he had relaxed on the

00:09:12.461 --> 00:09:16.720
psychoanalyst couch,
and allowed himself to free

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.168
associate.
 

00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:25.903
The story of Durandarte and
Belerma is drawn from the

00:09:25.903 --> 00:09:28.879
Carolingian cycle.
 

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:32.268
Remember that I mentioned the
various cycles of the chivalric

00:09:32.268 --> 00:09:35.769
romances and the epics and the
Carolingian is from Charlemagne,

00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:36.730
and so forth.
 

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.864
They're drawn from the
Carolingian cycle and seems to

00:09:40.864 --> 00:09:45.317
have embedded not only the fear
of death, but the fear of

00:09:45.317 --> 00:09:46.509
castration.
 

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:49.522
All of the characters,
except for Merlin,

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:53.965
are from the ballads of the
Carolingian and Arthurian cycle:

00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:56.149
King Arthur,
Charlemagne.

00:09:56.149 --> 00:10:01.173
The characters are supposed to
be dead and everyone is in

00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:06.556
mourning, and the procession is
kind of a mournful procession

00:10:06.556 --> 00:10:08.528
as--like a burial.
 

00:10:08.528 --> 00:10:13.158
Durandarte's body in the story
has his heart removed and sent

00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:16.629
to Belerma as a symbol of his
undying love;

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:18.120
this is the original story.
 

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.847
He asked when he died to have
this heart removed and sent to

00:10:22.847 --> 00:10:23.970
his beloved.
 

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:29.504
Here his castrated cadaver,
as it were, appears as the

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:34.308
statue grazing his own tomb
unable to speak.

00:10:34.308 --> 00:10:39.759
But the veracity of the story
is compromised,

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:44.898
or grotesquely guaranteed,
by Montesinos' explanation that

00:10:44.898 --> 00:10:50.398
he has had to salt the heart so
that it will not rot and begin

00:10:50.398 --> 00:10:51.570
to smell.
 

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.980
This destroys the fantasy.
 

00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.620
I mean, if this great hero has
his heart sent to his beloved,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.565
one never thinks that this
heart will be subject to the

00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:07.629
laws of nature,
this is fantasy world;

00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:12.129
but here, that fantasy is
destroyed and the story--

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:14.158
the veracity of the story,
in other words,

00:11:14.158 --> 00:11:18.467
can be guaranteed by the fact
that they have to salt it so

00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:19.980
that it won't rot.
 

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.960
Natural laws threaten the
story's verisimilitude.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.948
A jerk-beef heart is not the
same as the heart that

00:11:28.948 --> 00:11:32.379
symbolizes love,
courage and masculinity.

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:36.200
The heart, of course,
has all of these connotations.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:43.591
So if you think of it as being
made of jerk-beef all of those

00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:49.629
connotations are destroyed or
become grotesque.

00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:55.003
Although time is flexible
within the episode its effects

00:11:55.003 --> 00:11:59.183
on flesh are present;
that is, impinging other

00:11:59.183 --> 00:11:59.908
aspects.
 

00:11:59.908 --> 00:12:03.753
I say that the time is flexible
as was in the episode because,

00:12:03.753 --> 00:12:05.769
how long was Don Quixote down?
 

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:09.840
The scholar and Sancho say an
hour, at most;

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.970
he says three days!
 

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:16.427
And then there is the issue of
how long ago these stories

00:12:16.427 --> 00:12:22.860
occurred, hundreds of years ago,
yet these characters are there.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:29.544
So time within the story is
flexible, as time tends to be,

00:12:29.544 --> 00:12:32.360
as we know, in dreams.
 

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.533
We know now from modern studies
in dreams that stories that seem

00:12:36.533 --> 00:12:40.639
to take a long time actually
take a few seconds in a dream,

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:45.173
and that there is this
compression that Freud talks

00:12:45.173 --> 00:12:47.471
about,
how a dream compresses stories

00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:48.558
in a very short time.
 

00:12:48.558 --> 00:12:51.984
This is intimated here,
in that Don Quixote says that

00:12:51.984 --> 00:12:55.870
he's been there for three days
and they say only an hour.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:02.090
But the effect of time on flesh
is evident.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:08.280
Now, this detail of the effect
of time on flesh reveals Don

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:15.220
Quixote's own doubts about the
legitimacy of chivalric legends.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.173
I mean, remember,
this is a story he himself is

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:21.495
telling,
so if the story comes up in

00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:26.630
this subconscious it's because
he has doubts about the

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.408
legitimacy of the chivalric
legends.

00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:33.058
The stories,
those of the chivalric legends,

00:13:33.058 --> 00:13:36.470
violate natural law,
hence they are fantastic,

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.250
as other characters have been
telling him all along,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.879
and all of this seems to have
had an effect on him.

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:49.658
Now, Don Quixote is recognized
as a great knight,

00:13:49.658 --> 00:13:52.972
a constant that began with
Sansón Carrasco's

00:13:52.972 --> 00:13:55.690
revelation of the existence of
Part I,

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.908
and this is something that will
happen over and again in Part

00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:01.400
II,
that he is recognized as a

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.037
great knight,
but in this case by character's

00:14:04.037 --> 00:14:07.220
whose own existence is very,
very doubtful,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:12.318
and that he himself will doubt
from now on by asking others

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:15.488
anxiously,
like Maese Pedro's--;like

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:19.195
Master Peter's monkey,
if what happened in the cave

00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:21.719
was real,
and by insisting that Sancho

00:14:21.719 --> 00:14:25.062
believe that it was real and
striking deals with him:

00:14:25.062 --> 00:14:28.211
"I'll believe that if you
believe the cave of

00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:31.039
Montesinos,"
it shows that he's not that

00:14:31.039 --> 00:14:32.389
sure about it.
 

00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:38.942
So their recognition;
that is, the recognition of his

00:14:38.942 --> 00:14:41.947
being a great knight by these
characters is hardly an

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:42.700
assurance.
 

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:51.913
I am underlining these doubts
that the stories reveal about

00:14:51.913 --> 00:14:57.605
his own fantasies,
but the most disturbing part of

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:02.010
the story is the appearance of
Dulcinea in the guise of the

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.950
ugly wench that Sancho tried to
make him believe was his lady.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:15.570
This is--we know from Freud,
Freud's great book,

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.178
The Interpretation of Dreams
that was published in 1900,

00:15:18.178 --> 00:15:23.168
when he talks about the remains
of the day,

00:15:23.168 --> 00:15:26.697
how a dream picks up elements
from the previous day and

00:15:26.697 --> 00:15:31.052
incorporates them into stories,
and this is sort of the remains

00:15:31.052 --> 00:15:31.879
of the day.
 

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:36.855
Now, the appearance of this
wench convinces Sancho that Don

00:15:36.855 --> 00:15:42.259
Quixote is insane because he was
the author of that charade,

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:48.202
but it also shows to what
extent that episode of the three

00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:54.460
peasant women has shaken Don
Quixote's own beliefs and probed

00:15:54.460 --> 00:16:01.029
deep into the sources of his own
desires for Dulcinea and of his

00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:03.950
invention of Dulcinea.
 

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:08.928
This peasant Dulcinea who
smells of raw garlic,

00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:12.822
as you remember,
as she smelled of sweat in

00:16:12.822 --> 00:16:16.158
Sancho's earlier story about
her,

00:16:16.158 --> 00:16:18.611
when he said:
'I got next to her and she

00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:22.573
smelled a little bit because she
was pitching hay or whatever it

00:16:22.573 --> 00:16:23.139
was.'
 

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:26.941
This peasant Dulcinea is,
I think, is close to Don

00:16:26.941 --> 00:16:30.432
Quixote's own real desire for
Aldonza Lorenzo,

00:16:30.432 --> 00:16:32.450
the original Dulcinea.
 

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:37.263
It seems to be the repressed
desire for a vulgar physically

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:41.827
strong sexually aggressive
younger woman who is the very

00:16:41.827 --> 00:16:45.381
opposite,
in fact, is the co-relative

00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:48.658
opposite of his idealization of
her.

00:16:48.658 --> 00:16:52.244
The more vulgar this woman of
his desires is,

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:56.480
the more idealized she will
become in his fantasy.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:07.250
Also, when asked for a loan by
her in this hilarious,

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.656
hilarious part of the
story--the last thing you

00:17:10.656 --> 00:17:15.250
imagine is for Dulcinea asking
for a loan from Don Quixote--

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:22.997
which is going to be backed up,
by the way, the guarantee is an

00:17:22.997 --> 00:17:28.368
intimate--an inner garment of
Dulcinea's;

00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:31.501
this is a very elaborate
underskirt of sorts,

00:17:31.501 --> 00:17:34.492
and it's going to be the
guarantee--I mean,

00:17:34.492 --> 00:17:37.269
these things are highly
sexualized.

00:17:37.269 --> 00:17:41.875
But Don Quixote is short two
reales: she wants six,

00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:45.558
but he has only four left to
give her.

00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:50.554
This is a clear sign of his
deep and repressed fear of

00:17:50.554 --> 00:17:54.700
sexual inadequacy--it couldn't
be clearer;

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.416
you don't have to be
Freud--which may be the source

00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:01.868
of his heroic fantasies.
 

00:18:01.868 --> 00:18:05.798
He's old, he feels sexually
inadequate, so he wants to

00:18:05.798 --> 00:18:10.471
imagine himself a young vigorous
knight who can go and fight and

00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:11.880
seduce maidens.
 

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.847
So Sancho's invention in the
episode of the enchanted

00:18:16.847 --> 00:18:22.483
Dulcinea has dug deep into Don
Quixote's dreads and into the

00:18:22.483 --> 00:18:25.160
source of his fantasies.
 

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:32.541
In this topsy-turvy world of
the cave there are eerie images

00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:34.670
of death, also.
 

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.470
I already mentioned the
blackbirds at the mouth of the

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.838
cave.
 

00:18:37.838 --> 00:18:43.252
Durandarte's cadaver posing as
a statue on its own sarcophagus

00:18:43.252 --> 00:18:47.247
is the eeriest of them all and
the uncanniest,

00:18:47.247 --> 00:18:49.200
it's an inversion.
 

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.067
The statue on a sarcophagus
presumably represents the body

00:18:53.067 --> 00:18:56.542
of the dead person within it--
I'm sure you have been to

00:18:56.542 --> 00:19:00.349
European cathedrals,
where you go and you find all

00:19:00.349 --> 00:19:05.945
of these sarcophagi and you see
on top the recumbent statue of

00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:09.494
the person within it,
kings and all of that who are

00:19:09.494 --> 00:19:11.528
usually like this with their
hands like this,

00:19:11.528 --> 00:19:14.680
and they have their swords near
them and all of that--

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.650
I find that eerie enough to
begin with,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:24.084
but in any case--here,
however, the cadaver is the

00:19:24.084 --> 00:19:28.257
statue;
nature has replaced art,

00:19:28.257 --> 00:19:30.480
or has become art.
 

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.732
Do you understand?
 

00:19:31.732 --> 00:19:34.657
Instead of having a
representation you have

00:19:34.657 --> 00:19:38.210
literally the cadaver on top of
the sarcophagus.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:43.275
But let us not forget that we
are dealing here with death and

00:19:43.275 --> 00:19:46.230
also in the realm of
temporality;

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.970
if you remember that
Durandarte's heart was salted so

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.838
that it would not smell.
 

00:19:51.838 --> 00:19:56.769
How can the cadaver replace the
statue and not rot like its

00:19:56.769 --> 00:19:57.450
heart?
 

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:02.299
Art has been taken over by
death, too;

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:03.828
this is what the intimation is.
 

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:06.987
Nothing, not even art,
is immune from death in this

00:20:06.987 --> 00:20:08.250
world of the cave.
 

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.887
There may be a pun,
a ghoulish pun embedded here:

00:20:12.887 --> 00:20:17.334
sarcophagus comes from the
Greek sarcos,

00:20:17.334 --> 00:20:20.910
flesh and phagein,
to eat.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:25.269
The sarcophagus literally eats
flesh, the flesh of the dead

00:20:25.269 --> 00:20:28.877
body that it contains,
but here the dead body has

00:20:28.877 --> 00:20:31.660
escaped to become its own
statue.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.358
This is a very baroque image.
 

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:38.630
We will meet--we will find
another sarcophagus that we will

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.680
be discussing in the course of
the next few chapters.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.952
Now, the stories and images
within Montesinos cave highlight

00:20:47.952 --> 00:20:52.868
the central topic of Part II
desengaño.

00:20:52.868 --> 00:20:55.432
Desengaño,
as we have seen can mean the

00:20:55.432 --> 00:20:56.960
destruction of all illusions.
 

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.318
When Don Quixote comes to,
after emerging from the cave,

00:21:02.318 --> 00:21:05.311
he declares,
in what is a classic expression

00:21:05.311 --> 00:21:09.460
of desengaño,
and this is a quote:

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.411
"Forgive ye, friends,
[he tells the scholar and

00:21:13.411 --> 00:21:16.376
Sancho]
for having brought me away from

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:20.279
the most pleasing and charming
life and sight,

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:23.440
that ever mortal saw or lived.
 

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.866
In short, I am now thoroughly
satisfied that all of the

00:21:27.866 --> 00:21:32.950
enjoyments of this life pass
away like a shadow or a dream,

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.490
and fade away like the flower
of the field.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.410
O unhappy Montesino!
 

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.559
O desperately wounded
Durandarte!

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:43.049
O unfortunate Belerma!
 

00:21:43.049 --> 00:21:44.890
O weeping Guadiana!
 

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.210
And ye unlucky daughters of
Ruydera, whose waters show what

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:53.009
floods of tears stream from your
fair eyes!"

00:21:53.009 --> 00:21:59.240
He says a bit later,
quote: "I awaked,

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.098
and found myself,
I knew not by what means,

00:22:02.098 --> 00:22:04.190
in the midst of the finest,
pleasantest,

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.288
and most delightful meadow,
that nature could create,

00:22:07.288 --> 00:22:10.401
or the most pregnant fancy
imagined."

00:22:10.401 --> 00:22:11.160
Unquote.
 

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.358
This is the locus
amoenus of Renaissance,

00:22:13.358 --> 00:22:17.390
pastoral literature that I have
mentioned before--

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.633
you remember the locus
amoenus into which Rocinante

00:22:20.633 --> 00:22:23.990
wanders and falls in love with
the mares and all of that.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:29.867
It is a topic of Renaissance
literature as the most pleasant

00:22:29.867 --> 00:22:35.846
of place, and this is where he
lands, and presumably where he

00:22:35.846 --> 00:22:37.640
has his dream.
 

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.012
Desengaño,
as I have been saying,

00:22:40.012 --> 00:22:42.490
means to peel away the
illusion, the delusion.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.505
It is a form of self-analysis,
of recognition comparable to

00:22:46.505 --> 00:22:50.588
the one in today's terms
achieved through psychoanalysis.

00:22:50.588 --> 00:22:55.759
Don Quixote seems to have dived
into this own subconscious.

00:22:55.759 --> 00:23:00.558
Is this a regressus ad
uterum, an atavistic return

00:23:00.558 --> 00:23:01.759
to the womb?
 

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:05.068
That's the Latin way of saying
it, return to the womb,

00:23:05.068 --> 00:23:06.880
regressus ad uterum.
 

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.848
It's an atavistic return to the
womb;

00:23:08.848 --> 00:23:14.117
I mean, it's trying to get back
into the mother's womb,

00:23:14.117 --> 00:23:16.848
seeking solace and refuge.
 

00:23:16.848 --> 00:23:20.233
Don Quixote's descent,
as we have seen,

00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:23.618
makes him look harshly upon
himself.

00:23:23.618 --> 00:23:28.355
It does not completely shake
his beliefs or dispel his

00:23:28.355 --> 00:23:33.449
madness, but it is a serious
blow, and from now on he will

00:23:33.449 --> 00:23:34.700
act saner.
 

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.170
How can it have been
pleasurable, however?

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:43.090
Only if one thinks that once in
the cave he was at least in the

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.868
living presence of his
fictions--

00:23:45.868 --> 00:23:49.798
this was pleasurable--and that
the disillusionment became

00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:52.128
repressed,
as he experienced it.

00:23:52.128 --> 00:23:55.643
When he met all of these
elements that threatened his

00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:58.818
disillusions he repressed them
immediately,

00:23:58.818 --> 00:24:04.778
and that--as we tend to repress
unpleasant experiences--

00:24:04.778 --> 00:24:06.528
that he was not aware,
as we readers are,

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:10.630
that what he experienced
threatened his beliefs.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:19.058
So he comes back with doubts,
but are not conscious doubts.

00:24:19.058 --> 00:24:22.868
Now, everything seems to
converge in the scene of the

00:24:22.868 --> 00:24:26.019
Montesinos cave:
Don Quixote's belief in the

00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:30.634
authenticity of the romances of
chivalry and the reality of what

00:24:30.634 --> 00:24:36.460
he sees when he sees windmills,
for instance, are questioned.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.358
The topics of the courtly love
tradition,

00:24:40.358 --> 00:24:44.135
which had filtered into the
romances of chivalry tumble

00:24:44.135 --> 00:24:47.771
through literalization by their
being put through the

00:24:47.771 --> 00:24:50.009
requirements of natural law.
 

00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:54.740
I already alluded several times
to Durandarte's salted heart;

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.336
Belerma, for her part,
may have looked under the

00:24:59.336 --> 00:25:04.028
weather because she had her
menstrual period,

00:25:04.028 --> 00:25:07.374
thought not really it is
explained, because the problem

00:25:07.374 --> 00:25:09.170
was that she is menopausal.
 

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:14.686
Real time, and with it,
periodic bodily functions,

00:25:14.686 --> 00:25:21.332
age and aging and decay have
crept into the world of fiction

00:25:21.332 --> 00:25:24.259
contained in the cave.
 

00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:29.345
No harsher way to dispel the
idealization of a Renaissance

00:25:29.345 --> 00:25:34.250
beauty than to imagine her
menstruating or going through

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.598
menopause,
meaning that she's already aged;

00:25:37.598 --> 00:25:44.017
imagine Botticelli's Venus's
with those problems,

00:25:44.017 --> 00:25:46.289
it's grotesque!
 

00:25:46.289 --> 00:25:52.534
It's brilliant;
however, to subject these

00:25:52.534 --> 00:25:58.304
idealizations to temporality,
and temporality here means that

00:25:58.304 --> 00:26:02.920
the age, that they suffer a
menstrual period.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.759
Why would Dulcinea need a loan?
 

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:11.756
It is said that need or
necessity is everywhere in

00:26:11.756 --> 00:26:15.888
passing;
the world of magic is invaded

00:26:15.888 --> 00:26:21.405
by needs and physical laws and
what ensues are grotesque

00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:22.410
images.
 

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:29.407
Now, there are many literary
antecedents to the cave of

00:26:29.407 --> 00:26:34.107
Montesinos episode,
and I have already mentioned:

00:26:34.107 --> 00:26:37.294
Homer, Virgil and Dante,
but the originality of the

00:26:37.294 --> 00:26:40.990
episode is not so much the
descent into the cave as that it

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.538
reveals Don Quixote's
subconscious.

00:26:43.538 --> 00:26:47.611
This is Cervantes' way of
showing us the knight's mind

00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:50.529
from within, unencumbered by
reason.

00:26:50.529 --> 00:26:55.500
As such, it seems to be a
better device than the soliloquy

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.990
in Shakespeare or in
Calderón,

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:05.266
which are parallel devices to
show what a character's thoughts

00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:09.278
are: "to be or not to
be",

00:27:09.278 --> 00:27:10.694
and so forth,
and in Calderón

00:27:10.694 --> 00:27:11.990
"¡Ay,
mísero de

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.183
mí!"--
this is from the Life is a

00:27:14.183 --> 00:27:14.680
Dream.
 

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.588
It is also more modern and
acceptable,

00:27:19.588 --> 00:27:22.970
this device in Cervantes,
to contemporary readers,

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.989
it seems to me,
because no one goes around

00:27:24.989 --> 00:27:27.501
delivering soliloquies that are
perfectly structured

00:27:27.501 --> 00:27:28.338
rhetorically.
 

00:27:28.338 --> 00:27:32.229
I'm sure you haven't heard any
of your friends going around

00:27:32.229 --> 00:27:36.318
delivering soliloquies that are
so poetically well wrought.

00:27:36.318 --> 00:27:44.163
But telling a dream is a common
activity, not only to

00:27:44.163 --> 00:27:50.648
psychoanalysts,
you tell your dreams to your

00:27:50.648 --> 00:27:52.460
friends.
 

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.000
In the episode there is a
grotesque combination of

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.324
fantasy, and not just reality
but the possible,

00:27:59.324 --> 00:28:03.009
all having to do with the decay
of human flesh.

00:28:03.009 --> 00:28:07.857
But as I have suggested,
isn't this also a tale of

00:28:07.857 --> 00:28:09.640
castration fear?
 

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:14.308
These are the repressed figures
in Don Quixote's mind.

00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:19.980
Peter Dunn, who was a very good
hispanist,

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.480
a British hispanist who taught
for many years,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.230
at the end of his career at
Wesley University nearby,

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:29.750
wrote the following in a very
good article on this episode.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:34.963
Actually, Peter Dunn wrote this
article in Spanish and I'm

00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:39.461
translating him into English;
these are the baroque

00:28:39.461 --> 00:28:43.338
inversions that you can get in
this course, too.

00:28:43.338 --> 00:28:47.680
This is what Peter Dunn said in
my own translation into English:

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.384
"What is observed,
in the cave of Montesinos

00:28:50.384 --> 00:28:52.750
episode, is quixoticism from the
inside.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:58.307
He looks at himself in the
mirror of his madness where

00:28:58.307 --> 00:29:04.705
comedy and spectator merge and
the enchanter and the enchanted

00:29:04.705 --> 00:29:06.068
coalesce.
 

00:29:06.068 --> 00:29:10.298
Far from offering us an image
of eternity, Montesinos' cave

00:29:10.298 --> 00:29:12.848
constitutes a frozen
temporality.

00:29:12.848 --> 00:29:16.269
Don Quixote will have to return
to his own bed,

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:22.598
and dream the dream of death so
Alonso Quixano can awaken,

00:29:22.598 --> 00:29:26.911
purged of his dreams and ready
to contemplate himself without

00:29:26.911 --> 00:29:29.930
theater in the mirror of
eternity."

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.826
This is anticipating the death
of Alonso Quijano at the end of

00:29:34.826 --> 00:29:35.710
the book.
 

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:40.940
Anthony Cascardi,
an American hispanist,

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.739
links the episode to the dream
argument in Descartes and makes

00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:47.853
quite a few valuable
observations about Don Quixote

00:29:47.853 --> 00:29:51.145
as a whole,
particularly about the entire

00:29:51.145 --> 00:29:55.819
debate about the relationship
between reality and fantasy.

00:29:55.819 --> 00:29:59.457
He says:
"I see his engagement as

00:29:59.457 --> 00:30:02.160
with problems of skepticism and
epistemology,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.238
and more specifically,
with the use of fiction as a

00:30:06.238 --> 00:30:08.930
mode of knowledge of the world.
 

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.088
His response to skepticism and
to its complement epistemology

00:30:13.088 --> 00:30:17.180
is to reject epistemology while
remaining anti-skeptical.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.931
But this is only another way of
saying that its purpose is to

00:30:20.931 --> 00:30:24.868
affirm the role of fiction in
our relationship to the world,

00:30:24.868 --> 00:30:28.156
which, it might further be
said, is an affirmation of the

00:30:28.156 --> 00:30:30.740
role of fiction in the task of
philosophy.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.880
Cervantes shows that we relate
to the world,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.880
including the world of our own
experiences,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.470
in ways other than what the
epistemologists call knowledge,

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.318
and that all we know of the
world cannot be characterized in

00:30:44.318 --> 00:30:45.690
terms of certainty.
 

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.784
Cervantes will,
to include the imagination and

00:30:48.784 --> 00:30:52.430
dreams within the range of valid
human experience,

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.950
within what we call the world
in the broadest sense,

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.920
free of the caveats of reasons
points this up."

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.769
In short--Cascardi tends to be
a little too philosophical--

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:07.422
in short, that stories,
that literature are a form of

00:31:07.422 --> 00:31:11.144
knowledge and a method of
approaching knowledge of the

00:31:11.144 --> 00:31:15.641
world and of ourselves and a way
to understand both the world and

00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:18.170
the workings of our own minds.
 

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:22.938
Now, psychoanalysis knows this,
and this is the reason why

00:31:22.938 --> 00:31:27.788
Freud availed himself of figures
like the Oedipus myth,

00:31:27.788 --> 00:31:32.380
to name mental processes,
and, of course,

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.719
Freud acknowledged that his
sources in the development and

00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:40.732
invention of psychoanalysis,
as he was really the inventor

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:41.952
of it,
were literary,

00:31:41.952 --> 00:31:44.842
and that he learned more from
literature than from the

00:31:44.842 --> 00:31:47.460
nineteenth century science that
preceded him.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:52.356
So the point is that these
stories in Montesinos cave show

00:31:52.356 --> 00:31:57.170
that stories are valid ways of
approaching knowledge,

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:00.368
knowledge of the world and
knowledge of our own minds.

00:32:00.368 --> 00:32:06.328
And this is what this episode,
I think, suggests brilliantly,

00:32:06.328 --> 00:32:09.704
independently,
and also, of course,

00:32:09.704 --> 00:32:13.480
within the structure of the
novel.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.750
So much, for the time being,
for the episode of Montesinos'

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:24.476
cave, to which we will probably
have to allude a number of times

00:32:24.476 --> 00:32:26.930
in succeeding lectures.
 

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:33.107
And we move now to the second
important episode that I want to

00:32:33.107 --> 00:32:37.159
discuss today,
and that is Master Peter's

00:32:37.159 --> 00:32:38.779
puppet show.
 

00:32:38.779 --> 00:32:47.807
Now, I have made a crude
drawing on the blackboard that

00:32:47.807 --> 00:32:53.660
will help me explain the
episode;

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.493
it is sketchy, I understand;
it is more Picasso than

00:32:58.493 --> 00:33:01.590
Velázquez,
let's put it that way,

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.730
but you can recognize some of
the figures: that,

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.210
of course is Ginés de
Pasamonte,

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.380
that is the speaker,
the boy who speaks;

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.951
that is Don Quixote;
that is Sancho,

00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:15.618
and then the rest of the
audience, and,

00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:19.759
of course, the puppet show as
best as I could render it.

00:33:19.759 --> 00:33:25.164
Now, the reappearance of
Ginés de Pasamonte

00:33:25.164 --> 00:33:30.460
establishes a concrete
continuity with Part I.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:35.058
Other than Sancho,
the women of Don Quixote's

00:33:35.058 --> 00:33:37.851
house,
the priest and the barber,

00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:41.767
Ginés is the only
character from Part I who comes

00:33:41.767 --> 00:33:43.118
back in Part II.
 

00:33:43.118 --> 00:33:51.250
If before Ginés was a
rogue picaresque author,

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:57.509
a Mateo Alemán--remember
Mateo Alemán,

00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:59.240
the author of Guzmán
de Alfarache;

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.220
remember that I said in that
episode of the galley slaves

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.579
when he says he has written his
life, he's a Mateo

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:10.179
Alemán.
 

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:15.170
If before Ginés was a
rogue picaresque author,

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.860
a Mateo Alemán,
he is now as Master Peter,

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:25.469
a miniature playwright,
a Lope de Vega in miniature--

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:30.679
remember, Lope de Vega,
Cervantes' enemy and the great

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.119
Spanish playwright of the
period.

00:34:34.119 --> 00:34:45.119
As both, Alemán and
Lope,

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:48.518
Ginés stands for the
modern author,

00:34:48.518 --> 00:34:54.186
whose not an aristocrat or a
cleric and has to earn a living

00:34:54.186 --> 00:34:55.820
from his craft.
 

00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:01.050
Lope liked to put the "de
Vega" in his last name to

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:04.190
pretend that he was
aristocratic,

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:07.039
and he made up fables about his
family and all of that,

00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:09.699
but he was not.
 

00:35:09.699 --> 00:35:16.900
Ginés also stands for
Cervantes himself,

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:22.498
and the whole episode is like a
laboratory for fiction to carry

00:35:22.498 --> 00:35:27.427
out experiments about fiction,
as Cervantes tends to do,

00:35:27.427 --> 00:35:28.829
and we have seen.
 

00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:33.177
Ginés is wily;
he does not respect literary

00:35:33.177 --> 00:35:36.947
tradition or rules,
and shows the limitations

00:35:36.947 --> 00:35:40.289
imposed by the medium of
literature.

00:35:40.289 --> 00:35:44.268
Like the imagined friend of the
1605 prologue--

00:35:44.268 --> 00:35:47.623
remember the imagined friend
whom Cervantes says comes to

00:35:47.623 --> 00:35:50.440
visit him and helps him write
that prologue--

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.706
this modern author does not
have a conventional or a deep

00:35:55.706 --> 00:36:01.349
classical education and has to
rely on compendia and books of

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:05.300
familiar quotations for his
erudition.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:11.208
Lope was known for this,
to get his information here and

00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:15.400
there pretend that he had read a
lot.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.920
He read a lot,
but not in the way that

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:24.666
humanists had read a great deal,
and he made it up the way that

00:36:24.666 --> 00:36:28.289
the friend tells Cervantes in
the prologue,

00:36:28.289 --> 00:36:30.971
to just go and get this book
and that and then just make a

00:36:30.971 --> 00:36:32.900
list of sources in alphabetical
order,

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.480
and that's the way these modern
authors operate.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:42.030
Now, Ginés has now one
eye covered.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.527
This is why I have--well,
actually I have the wrong eye

00:36:46.527 --> 00:36:49.777
covered;
it's supposed to be the left

00:36:49.777 --> 00:36:53.404
eye that is covered,
so, to be true to him,

00:36:53.404 --> 00:36:56.945
we'll uncover this eye and
cover this eye,

00:36:56.945 --> 00:36:58.500
the left eye.
 

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:04.876
He has one covered,
presumably the one that pulled

00:37:04.876 --> 00:37:11.782
in and made him cross-eyed,
because he knows that this is a

00:37:11.782 --> 00:37:17.210
distinctive trait that is
dangerous for him to display.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.032
He can be spotted,
described and nabbed by the

00:37:20.032 --> 00:37:23.170
Holy Brotherhood,
so he has to disguise himself;

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.623
this is why he has to
cover--it's sort of his

00:37:25.623 --> 00:37:28.914
signature, his body signature
which is that he's cross-eyed,

00:37:28.914 --> 00:37:31.480
like having a prominent scar or
something.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.393
Remember the description of Don
Quixote that the trooper reads

00:37:36.393 --> 00:37:40.905
when he's about to arrest him,
towards the end of Part I,

00:37:40.905 --> 00:37:44.625
he has a description;
so a description of

00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:50.010
Ginés will probably begin
by saying: he is cross-eyed,

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.780
so he has to cover that eye to
be safe.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.960
Ginés is a fugitive from
justice.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.789
Remember, he is one of the
galley slaves that Don Quixote

00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:04.266
set free,
so whatever other crimes he

00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:08.400
committed to make him be a
galley slave,

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.050
he has also escaped.
 

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:14.472
Hence, I quote:
"I had forgot to tell you

00:38:14.472 --> 00:38:18.581
[this is from the book]
that this same Master Peter had

00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:23.222
his left eye and almost half his
cheek covered with a patch of

00:38:23.222 --> 00:38:26.483
green taffeta,
a sign that something ailed all

00:38:26.483 --> 00:38:28.039
that side of his face."
 

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:30.829
That's from the text of the
Quixote.

00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:34.427
But being one-eyed,
as it were, even if it is

00:38:34.427 --> 00:38:38.516
faked, suggests fresh
restrictions that impinge his

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:42.849
art because of his limited
perception of reality.

00:38:42.849 --> 00:38:47.375
I am sort of glossing over my
article in the Casebook

00:38:47.375 --> 00:38:50.518
that you have read,
presumably, by now.

00:38:50.518 --> 00:38:56.929
This deformity also makes him
look furtive,

00:38:56.929 --> 00:38:59.579
dangerous, sneaky,
and, of course,

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:03.476
aesthetically interesting,
like the characters in Part I

00:39:03.476 --> 00:39:05.800
and those in Velázquez's
paintings.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.577
He is no Renaissance idealized
model of a man,

00:39:09.577 --> 00:39:14.362
although it is said several
times that he is a gallant and

00:39:14.362 --> 00:39:17.889
good looking man,
but he's cross-eyed.

00:39:17.889 --> 00:39:25.581
Before, Ginés converging
side access distorted

00:39:25.581 --> 00:39:30.610
reality--we have gone over this.
 

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.344
Now, he lacks depth perception,
which is very suggestive to the

00:39:35.344 --> 00:39:38.170
show that he will stage at the
inn.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:42.315
Ironically, by eliminating one
eye, Ginés is overcoming

00:39:42.315 --> 00:39:45.170
the problem of non-converging
sidelines;

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:50.099
it is a radical way of doing so
but now he lacks perspective.

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:55.798
Remember, that bi-ocular sight
you see with two eyes,

00:39:55.798 --> 00:40:01.170
therefore you have potentially
a double vision;

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.465
and there are,
because of this,

00:40:03.465 --> 00:40:05.945
there are,
in some cultures,

00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:10.489
deities that overcome this by
having a pineal eye,

00:40:10.489 --> 00:40:15.896
which is an eye in the middle
of the forehead that sort of

00:40:15.896 --> 00:40:19.500
serves to mediate between these
two.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.159
So, in the case of
Ginés,

00:40:22.159 --> 00:40:27.630
he is eliminating this eye to
have only one eye,

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:33.070
and therefore only one vision,
where before,

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:37.409
as a cross-eyed,
his access did not meet:

00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:44.030
they were supposed to meet here
but they don't quite meet,

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.789
and therefore he saw it in a
distorted way,

00:40:46.789 --> 00:40:48.579
but now with only one eye,
as we know,

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.570
he loses depth.
 

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:56.728
Now, the whole episode of the
puppet theater is besides yet

00:40:56.728 --> 00:40:59.929
another critique of Lope de
Vega,

00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:05.541
a protracted experiment on
mimesis like that of Princess

00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:09.324
Micomicona,
and not just in literary terms

00:41:09.324 --> 00:41:11.599
but also in pictorial terms.
 

00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:14.661
But as a critique of Lope
Cervantes, again,

00:41:14.661 --> 00:41:18.891
harps upon the carelessness
with which Lope used history to

00:41:18.891 --> 00:41:20.349
write his plays.
 

00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:24.222
Remember the episode with the
Canon of Toledo where there was

00:41:24.222 --> 00:41:27.577
a protracted discussion and
critique of Lope for just

00:41:27.577 --> 00:41:31.192
grabbing historical elements
pell-mell without being very

00:41:31.192 --> 00:41:32.869
faithful to history.
 

00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:38.085
When Don Quixote protests in
the middle of the show that it

00:41:38.085 --> 00:41:43.840
is wrong to have Moors ringing
bells instead of kettle drums,

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:49.773
Master Peter answers with what
contemporaries were surely not

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:53.829
to miss as an allusion to Lope
de Vega.

00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:58.000
It says:
"Señor Don Quixote,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.094
[says Ginés de Pasamonte
from within the puppet theater]

00:42:04.094 --> 00:42:09.487
do not criticize upon trifles,
nor expect that perfection,

00:42:09.487 --> 00:42:12.909
which is not to be found in
these matters.

00:42:12.909 --> 00:42:15.807
Are there not a thousand
comedies acted almost

00:42:15.807 --> 00:42:19.048
everywhere,
full of as many improprieties

00:42:19.048 --> 00:42:21.820
and blunders,
and yet they run their career

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.302
with great success,
and are listened to,

00:42:24.302 --> 00:42:27.280
not only with applause but with
admiration?

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.731
Go on, boy, and let folks talk;
[he's now addressing the boy],

00:42:32.731 --> 00:42:37.599
go on, boy, and let folks talk;
for, so I fill my bag.

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:40.876
I care not if I represent more
improprieties than there are

00:42:40.876 --> 00:42:42.289
motes in the sun."
 

00:42:42.289 --> 00:42:46.025
Now, this is as clear an
allusion to Lope de Vega as

00:42:46.025 --> 00:42:49.103
could be made,
and remember that Avellaneda,

00:42:49.103 --> 00:42:52.182
as I mentioned before,
may have been a follower and a

00:42:52.182 --> 00:42:56.146
defender of Lope de Vega,
and this is why he wrote in his

00:42:56.146 --> 00:43:00.268
prologue such insulting comments
about Cervantes.

00:43:00.268 --> 00:43:04.289
Now, as a laboratory of mimesis
the show that Maese Pedro and

00:43:04.289 --> 00:43:08.244
his assistant put on is of a
conceptual complexity worthy of

00:43:08.244 --> 00:43:11.728
the Velázquez of Las
Meninas and The

00:43:11.728 --> 00:43:14.739
Spinners,
which you have seen here.

00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:17.954
To begin with,
we have that the performance of

00:43:17.954 --> 00:43:20.739
the puppets is not enough in
itself,

00:43:20.739 --> 00:43:25.646
and that Master Peter's figures
and props require a supplemental

00:43:25.646 --> 00:43:29.853
oral commentary or narrative
executed by his assistant:

00:43:29.853 --> 00:43:31.880
this is the assistant.
 

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.224
I put a little balloon here,
as in comic books,

00:43:34.224 --> 00:43:36.010
because this is what he's
saying.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:39.318
Of course, if I may be allowed
to use his convention from

00:43:39.318 --> 00:43:39.849
comics.
 

00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:43.927
So he needs the supplemental
narrative by the

00:43:43.927 --> 00:43:48.840
trujamán,
was the word of the period.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.945
But the visual and verbal
representations do not harmonize

00:43:53.945 --> 00:43:56.579
properly,
and both Don Quijote and

00:43:56.579 --> 00:43:59.179
Ginés have to admonish
the boy,

00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:03.989
who is the author's
supplementary voiceover.

00:44:03.989 --> 00:44:07.731
It's like a voiceover in a
film, but it is as if the

00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:11.400
voiceover and the film images
didn't quite mesh.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.239
It is a dual performance of the
author's invention.

00:44:16.239 --> 00:44:19.349
That is, the author's
invention, which is

00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:22.382
Ginés,
here, is manifested in two

00:44:22.382 --> 00:44:26.735
ways--which is manifested
visually and orally at the same

00:44:26.735 --> 00:44:28.867
time,
hoping that they will

00:44:28.867 --> 00:44:30.179
complement each other.
 

00:44:30.179 --> 00:44:32.905
But they do not mesh
satisfactorily,

00:44:32.905 --> 00:44:36.956
as if there were an inherent
flaw in the recital that

00:44:36.956 --> 00:44:41.239
reflects the awkwardness of the
theatrical routine.

00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:46.235
It's very awkward to represent
the stories with these material

00:44:46.235 --> 00:44:49.429
objects that represent human
beings,

00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:54.704
so what we have here is a very
flawed combination of the oral

00:44:54.704 --> 00:44:57.869
and the visual trying to
combine,

00:44:57.869 --> 00:45:01.570
to produce a performance,
a satisfactory performance.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.532
To produce mimesis,
representation,

00:45:04.532 --> 00:45:09.150
and it is a critique of mimesis
and representation;

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.570
this is what I'm trying to say.
 

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:16.088
Don Quixote's correction to the
boy is significantly made in the

00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:20.119
language of geometry as applied
to painting.

00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:23.552
Don Quixote says:
"Here Don Quixote said in

00:45:23.552 --> 00:45:25.159
a loud voice:
'Boy,

00:45:25.159 --> 00:45:29.050
boy, on with your story in a
straight line,

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:30.467
and leave your curves and
transversals:

00:45:30.467 --> 00:45:32.945
for,
to come at the truth of a fact,

00:45:32.945 --> 00:45:36.233
there is often need of proof
upon proof'."

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.018
Unquote.
 

00:45:37.018 --> 00:45:42.320
What could seem like a mere
rhetorical display on the part

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.860
of the knight is,
on the contrary,

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.239
of surprising propriety in the
context of the episode,

00:45:47.239 --> 00:45:51.240
because the whole effect of the
puppet show depends on a visual

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.811
trompe-l'oeil--
it's a French expression for a

00:45:54.811 --> 00:45:56.427
trick,
trompe-l'oeil,

00:45:56.427 --> 00:45:58.599
you use it in English;
trampantojo,

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:00.657
is an old work in Spanish,
it's the same,

00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:02.916
"trampa"
and "ojos,"

00:46:02.916 --> 00:46:03.599
trampantojos.
 

00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:05.440
We don't use it any more in
Spanish,

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.329
we use trompe-l'oeil,
the French word,

00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:09.646
most of the time,
but it's based on a visual

00:46:09.646 --> 00:46:13.039
trompe-l'oeil or a visual
trick based on perspective,

00:46:13.039 --> 00:46:17.760
exactly the way that a painting
is organized according to

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:23.070
geometrical rules that produce
the effect of mass and depth--

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:28.670
I hope you follow this:
Geometrical rules of the

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:32.882
painting,
we've talked about the book by

00:46:32.882 --> 00:46:37.476
Alberti,
produce the effect of mass and

00:46:37.476 --> 00:46:39.800
depth by distance.
 

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:43.664
Master Peter himself,
by the way, agrees with Don

00:46:43.664 --> 00:46:46.615
Quixote,
and his admonition to the boy

00:46:46.615 --> 00:46:50.391
also appeals to the language of
geometry and painting:

00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:53.297
"Boy,
none of your flourishes,

00:46:53.297 --> 00:46:56.159
but do what the gentlemen bids
you;

00:46:56.159 --> 00:46:57.420
for that is the surest
way."

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.724
"Flourishes"
is "dibujos,"

00:46:59.724 --> 00:47:01.099
or drawings,
in the original.

00:47:01.099 --> 00:47:05.701
Don Quixote and Ginés'
words say more than they know a

00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:10.380
common occurrence in Cervantes,
as we have seen many times.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:15.530
The puppet show's effect,
its verisimilitude,

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:18.889
is based on a question of
proportions and perspective,

00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:22.793
and has a great deal to do with
a straight a line that Don

00:47:22.793 --> 00:47:26.628
Quixote demands that the boy
narrator follow without much

00:47:26.628 --> 00:47:27.449
success.
 

00:47:27.449 --> 00:47:31.715
It is a metaphor,
of course, to apply straight

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:36.550
line to how a story unfolds,
a narrative unfolds.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:42.356
The narrative straight line and
the straight line that can be

00:47:42.356 --> 00:47:47.389
drawn from the spectators to the
show are related.

00:47:47.389 --> 00:47:54.099
That is, this is the straight
line from the spectators to the

00:47:54.099 --> 00:47:59.001
show as they look at it,
and I'm relating that to the

00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:03.032
straight line in the story that
Don Quixote refers to when he

00:48:03.032 --> 00:48:04.510
admonishes the boy.
 

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:09.112
If the spectators look directly
at the theater to engage in its

00:48:09.112 --> 00:48:12.360
fantasy,
they have to disregard that at

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.440
such a short distance human
figures,

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.139
horses and buildings,
should appear so small,

00:48:18.139 --> 00:48:21.250
as if they were much further
away.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:27.282
Perspective has to be assumed
as if different geometric

00:48:27.282 --> 00:48:34.099
relations between the public and
the tiny actors obtained,

00:48:34.099 --> 00:48:39.047
as if the geometric physical
relations between the spectators

00:48:39.047 --> 00:48:43.914
and the show were different than
they are because they're so

00:48:43.914 --> 00:48:44.739
close.
 

00:48:44.739 --> 00:48:48.038
The narrator goes through
"curves and

00:48:48.038 --> 00:48:51.980
transversals,"
as Don Quixote calls them,

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:55.525
to achieve the illusion of
simultaneous action taking

00:48:55.525 --> 00:48:58.130
place,
and to hold the spectators

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:02.798
attention and approval in the
same way that the theater has to

00:49:02.798 --> 00:49:06.780
abuse the rules of geometry to
stage the action--

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:12.005
abuses the rules of geometry to
stage the action in what is

00:49:12.005 --> 00:49:16.931
presumably a greater territory,
but it is compressed on the

00:49:16.931 --> 00:49:20.860
stage, and the proportion
between the various elements,

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:24.289
the various--the actors and the
horses and all of that,

00:49:24.289 --> 00:49:25.590
are not followed.
 

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:29.871
Ginés cannot vary the
figures dimensions as they come

00:49:29.871 --> 00:49:32.920
closer or further away from the
public,

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.760
the dimensions are a given that
cannot be changed.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.429
This whole ensemble of virtual
lines,

00:49:39.429 --> 00:49:41.518
like those in
Velázquez's painting,

00:49:41.518 --> 00:49:45.335
hold up the fiction and its
props at the same time in front

00:49:45.335 --> 00:49:46.518
of the audience.
 

00:49:46.518 --> 00:49:49.829
The audience here is aware both
of the fiction and of the props

00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:52.018
that are there to make up the
fiction,

00:49:52.018 --> 00:49:53.704
is what I'm trying to say,
as in Velázquez's

00:49:53.704 --> 00:49:54.110
paintings.
 

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:58.947
To sustain the illusion the
narrator not only avails himself

00:49:58.947 --> 00:50:02.309
figuratively of the geometric
figures,

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:07.782
but also of the rhetoric of
visions repeating the anaphora

00:50:07.782 --> 00:50:11.806
like--
anaphora is a rhetorical figure

00:50:11.806 --> 00:50:18.007
when you repeat a word or a turn
of phrase: "let us not

00:50:18.007 --> 00:50:20.871
forget...,
let us not forget...,

00:50:20.871 --> 00:50:24.250
" the orator will repeat
something like that;

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.913
that is an anaphora,
and here the language of

00:50:26.913 --> 00:50:30.423
visions in medieval literature
used this figure and the boy

00:50:30.423 --> 00:50:32.420
says: "Pray
observe...,"

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.266
"See him now...,"
"Turn your eyes

00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:37.809
toward...,"
"Now behold...,"

00:50:37.809 --> 00:50:41.199
"Do you not see...,"
"Behold now...,"

00:50:41.199 --> 00:50:43.559
"Observe that..."
 

00:50:43.559 --> 00:50:48.233
What he's really telling them,
with all of these repetitions

00:50:48.233 --> 00:50:52.590
is: but don't actually see what
is really happening,

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:56.840
overlook it to be able to
accept the fiction.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.889
Within the very illusion of a
show we have a kind of mirror

00:51:00.889 --> 00:51:05.360
duplication of the problem of
perspective and vanishing point.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.927
Remember that I talked about
vanishing point in Las

00:51:07.927 --> 00:51:10.690
Meninas about the gentleman
who's at the very end,

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.579
who is literally leaving and
vanishing,

00:51:13.579 --> 00:51:15.179
so there would seem to be a pun
there.

00:51:15.179 --> 00:51:22.550
This becomes literal when
Melisandra and Don Gaiferos,

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.943
who are on the same horse,
gallop desperately running away

00:51:25.943 --> 00:51:28.860
from the Moors towards
"la línea de

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.420
Francia,"
towards the line dividing

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.250
France from Spain,
the border.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:37.657
So if they are on the horse,
here, they're moving towards

00:51:37.657 --> 00:51:40.760
the back of the stage towards a
vanishing point,

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.670
so this is literalized here the
vanishing point in the fiction,

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:47.480
that is being depicted in the
story.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:53.110
Now, all of these tricks manage
to confuse Don Quixote,

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:58.085
of course, who predictably
lunges towards the action to

00:51:58.085 --> 00:52:02.021
participate in it,
caught in a net of rhetorical

00:52:02.021 --> 00:52:06.166
and geometrical figures that
have blinded him not letting him

00:52:06.166 --> 00:52:10.034
see the difference in size
between his own body and those

00:52:10.034 --> 00:52:12.726
of his enemies:
he has lost the sense of

00:52:12.726 --> 00:52:17.577
proportion,
and this is what encourages him

00:52:17.577 --> 00:52:22.012
other than his madness,
of course, to participate in

00:52:22.012 --> 00:52:22.690
the action.
 

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:26.090
This is, by the way,
this scene of Don Quixote

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:31.094
lunging on to the stage,
is the one that Orson Welles

00:52:31.094 --> 00:52:36.389
used in his attempted film on
the Quixote.

00:52:36.389 --> 00:52:39.239
Orson Welles never finished his
Quixote,

00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:42.119
but there are parts that he
filmed,

00:52:42.119 --> 00:52:46.550
and I spoke about them in a
symposium on Orson Welles here,

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.639
a couple of years ago,
and got to see some of them,

00:52:48.639 --> 00:52:50.719
and this is one of them,
and what he has,

00:52:50.719 --> 00:52:54.739
the scene takes place in a
movie, a movie that is being

00:52:54.739 --> 00:52:57.829
shown outdoors,
actually, and Don Quixote

00:52:57.829 --> 00:53:01.960
climbs on the stage and slashes
at the screen in this modern

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.409
adaptation of this famous scene.
 

00:53:04.409 --> 00:53:09.170
I think that Cervantes projects
himself in Ginés Master

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:12.059
Peter as author of modern
fictions.

00:53:12.059 --> 00:53:16.480
As he had already done in the
galley slaves episode in Part I,

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:22.860
to not overlook that Cervantes
was also maimed,

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:29.590
like Ginés is cross-eyed
and Cervantes,

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:33.208
as you remember,
had a lesion on his left arm

00:53:33.208 --> 00:53:35.099
that he couldn't use.
 

00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:38.715
Ginés Master Peter is
struggling with the hardships of

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:41.351
authorship,
as it were, by adjusting his

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:44.929
ability to perceive reality,
hence to represent it.

00:53:44.929 --> 00:53:48.443
Making himself one-eyed,
Master Peter manages to prevent

00:53:48.443 --> 00:53:51.320
the problems created by his
cross-eyedness.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.159
Remember that with two eyes,
let alone their being crossed,

00:53:55.159 --> 00:53:58.000
there are two visions,
which may or may not coincide,

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.989
but certainly will not if he is
cross-eyed;

00:54:00.989 --> 00:54:02.260
we have gone over this.
 

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:05.559
This is the cause of his not
being able to foresee and ending

00:54:05.559 --> 00:54:07.650
to his
autobiographyâ€“remember?

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:10.331
He says, 'how can my
autobiography be finished if my

00:54:10.331 --> 00:54:11.119
life is not?'
 

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:14.260
You could project that as a
problem of vision,

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:19.139
too, if autobiography goes this
way and life that way,

00:54:19.139 --> 00:54:23.947
and you have a vision that
doesn't allow for a coincidence

00:54:23.947 --> 00:54:28.994
of the two,
that infinitely receding end of

00:54:28.994 --> 00:54:32.893
the fiction,
or infinitely to the end of his

00:54:32.893 --> 00:54:36.782
life,
could be seen as part of his

00:54:36.782 --> 00:54:39.699
problems with his eyes.
 

00:54:39.699 --> 00:54:44.166
With only one eye,
however, Master Peter would be

00:54:44.166 --> 00:54:49.005
able to look straight through
only one visual access,

00:54:49.005 --> 00:54:53.099
but this is not a happy
solution either.

00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:57.885
To compensate for his loss of
one-half of the visual field he

00:54:57.885 --> 00:55:01.635
must look sideways:
if he has his eye covered he

00:55:01.635 --> 00:55:05.070
has to look sideways,
askew in his head.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:09.692
He cannot achieve a harmonious
vision, and he makes himself

00:55:09.692 --> 00:55:13.996
more awkward and interesting,
hence he cannot represent

00:55:13.996 --> 00:55:15.670
reality properly.
 

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:19.981
With only one eye Master Peter
cannot create a perspective that

00:55:19.981 --> 00:55:24.987
will correspond to reason,
to follow Alberti's treatises

00:55:24.987 --> 00:55:28.079
on painting that I mentioned.
 

00:55:28.079 --> 00:55:32.070
His reading of literary
tradition is also askew,

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:34.449
like the tilt of his head.
 

00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:38.010
We also know that with only one
eye he would also lose his depth

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.119
perception, which would
disastrously affect his capacity

00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:42.590
to create perspective.
 

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:46.565
His rewriting of the Melisendra
and Gaiferos story is fraught

00:55:46.565 --> 00:55:50.806
with errors, like Lope de Vega's
plays which Don Quixote tries to

00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:52.329
correct, as we saw.
 

00:55:52.329 --> 00:55:56.650
Only that ideal reader,
Alonso Quijano,

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:59.637
who, instead of writing
romances of chivalry tried to

00:55:59.637 --> 00:56:02.623
act one out,
can see straight in the lucid

00:56:02.623 --> 00:56:06.360
nights of his library and
perceive fictions that are

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.097
harmonious and very similar
within themselves and to

00:56:10.097 --> 00:56:11.050
himself.
 

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:13.059
Don Quixote,
in the darkness of Juan

00:56:13.059 --> 00:56:15.672
Palomeque's inn,
by slashing the wineskins,

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:19.072
makes the various fictional
levels converge and resolve the

00:56:19.072 --> 00:56:20.420
conflictive stories.
 

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:24.436
It is the ability to fuse all
of those non-converging levels

00:56:24.436 --> 00:56:28.659
of fiction that makes Cervantes
such a great modern author,

00:56:28.659 --> 00:56:32.260
whose fictions will not destroy
themselves from within,

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.610
as Ginés' does here.
 

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:37.567
Cervantes' is a happy
cross-eyedness,

00:56:37.567 --> 00:56:42.085
because the various lines do
not fuse in his imaginative

00:56:42.085 --> 00:56:44.880
world, yet cohere in some way.
 

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:50.000
To him, the origin of vision is
always already a double vision,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.378
with irony being congenital to
it, with representation

00:56:54.378 --> 00:56:56.030
depending on it.
 

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:59.768
I like to see this whole
episode of Master Peter's puppet

00:56:59.768 --> 00:57:03.639
show as an allegory of the whole
of the Quixote,

00:57:03.639 --> 00:57:09.340
with Cervantes the author
hidden inside there,

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:13.760
but outside his fiction,
which he controls through

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.909
strings with a voice projected
by an agent,

00:57:17.909 --> 00:57:21.460
Cide Hamete Benengeli or his
translators,

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:23.739
whom he cannot quite control
either.

00:57:23.739 --> 00:57:26.356
The story itself,
like that of Melisandra and

00:57:26.356 --> 00:57:28.371
Gaiferos,
is drawn from literary

00:57:28.371 --> 00:57:31.389
tradition but distorted and
rearranged as needed,

00:57:31.389 --> 00:57:33.405
and the public,
we, the readers,

00:57:33.405 --> 00:57:37.681
are drawn into this fiction,
but not completely aware as we

00:57:37.681 --> 00:57:41.000
are of the artifice of the whole
construct.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.005
I am moved, romantic that I am,
with Cervantes' identification

00:57:46.005 --> 00:57:49.385
with Ginés,
the fugitive from justice,

00:57:49.385 --> 00:57:52.760
roaming through Spain
struggling to make a living with

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.989
this fiction making contraption.
 

00:57:54.989 --> 00:57:59.411
Now, Cervantes wraps up this
take on modern literature and

00:57:59.411 --> 00:58:03.987
its labors in the brilliant
scene that closes the episode of

00:58:03.987 --> 00:58:08.041
Master Peter's puppet show,
the one in which aided by

00:58:08.041 --> 00:58:11.251
Sancho and the innkeeper Don
Quixote compensates the

00:58:11.251 --> 00:58:14.460
puppeteer for the figurines that
he has smashed.

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:18.969
The value of each broken piece
depends on his or her relative

00:58:18.969 --> 00:58:23.409
importance in the fiction,
not on its material value based

00:58:23.409 --> 00:58:25.960
on the stuff of which it is
made,

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.369
plus the workmanship.
 

00:58:27.369 --> 00:58:30.947
Charlemagne is worth a great
deal because of who he is in the

00:58:30.947 --> 00:58:32.260
story, for instance.
 

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:36.179
The real and the fictional
worlds cut through each other

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:36.679
here.
 

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:40.184
Real money is being paid in
restitution for damages,

00:58:40.184 --> 00:58:43.414
but the amount of the
compensation is figured on

00:58:43.414 --> 00:58:46.989
fictional values--Do you
understand what I mean?

00:58:46.989 --> 00:58:48.894
I mean, a slave,
or a peasant,

00:58:48.894 --> 00:58:52.639
or a servant would not--a
figurine, even if it's beautiful

00:58:52.639 --> 00:58:56.320
and big, would not cost as much
as that of the king.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.331
What Cervantes seems to be
underlining here is the value of

00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:03.929
fictional characters as
creations by their author.

00:59:03.929 --> 00:59:07.570
How much would a Don Quixote or
a Sancho be worth to Cervantes?

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:10.219
How much a Hamlet to
Shakespeare?

00:59:10.219 --> 00:59:12.932
How much would it take to
compensate García

00:59:12.932 --> 00:59:15.980
Márquez for Coronel
Aureliano Buendía,

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.929
or Borges for Pierre Menard?
 

00:59:17.929 --> 00:59:21.820
These are fictional entities,
but now they have a real

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:26.077
monetary value in a world in
which literature is becoming a

00:59:26.077 --> 00:59:29.106
commodity,
without ceasing to be,

00:59:29.106 --> 00:59:32.148
at the same time,
one of the great expressions of

00:59:32.148 --> 00:59:32.949
the human spirit.
 

00:59:32.949 --> 00:59:37.811
This scene is reminiscent of
the one in Part I towards the

00:59:37.811 --> 00:59:42.844
end when restitutions are made
to the barber whose basin has

00:59:42.844 --> 00:59:46.266
been taken,
to the innkeeper for expenses

00:59:46.266 --> 00:59:50.311
and damages and marriage vows
are exchanged to make up for

00:59:50.311 --> 00:59:53.789
Fernando's dishonest behavior
towards Dorotea.

00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:57.672
It is a miniaturized scene of
restitutions,

00:59:57.672 --> 01:00:02.389
a small-scale repetition of
that scene in Part I.

01:00:14.938 --> 01:00:17.219
puppeteer himself.
 

01:00:17.219 --> 01:00:22.000

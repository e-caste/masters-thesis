00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.397
Professor Christine
Hayes: One thing that kept

00:00:02.397 --> 00:00:04.090
cropping up ,
and it is something that crops

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.334
up every time I teach this
course, and I should always say

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:09.090
something about it preemptively,
is just a terminological issue.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.340
Israelites are not Israelis.
 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.743
The word "Israeli," term
"Israeli," refers to a citizen

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:17.760
of the modern state of Israel.
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.350
So there are no Israelis before
the year 1948.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.261
Okay.
And we use Israelite to refer

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:27.050
to the ancient inhabitants of
the ancient kingdom of Israel.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.040
So that is an important
distinction.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.617
I know you hear "Israelis" and
so that is just a term that

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:34.195
people thought would apply to
anyone who inhabited a place

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:36.341
called Israel.
But Israeli and Israelite are

00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:39.049
used precisely in order to make
that distinction between the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:40.426
ancient and the modern period.
 

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:41.838
Okay.
So we are talking about

00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:43.169
Israelites.
And while we are on the

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:44.648
subject, we are not talking
about Jews yet,

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:46.111
either.
We cannot really use the term

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.912
"Jew."
It is not historically accurate

00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:50.880
for the period that we have been
dealing with in the Bible.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.207
When we get towards the very
end of the biblical period,

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.655
we'll see that when Persia
conquers and reconstitutes this

00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:00.581
area,
or designates as a province,

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:05.172
this area as Yehud (so the
Persians are going to be the

00:01:05.172 --> 00:01:09.849
ones to create a province called
Yehud in this area,

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:12.617
including Jerusalem) they will
allow the Israelites who are in

00:01:12.617 --> 00:01:16.549
exile to go back and live there,
and they will become Yehudites.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.379
And this is going to be where
the word Jew comes from.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:22.125
But that is not going to be
historically accurate before the

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:23.840
end of the sixth century.
 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.561
And even then it is still a
technical term having to do with

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:28.130
living in the Province of Yehud.
 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.620
It is not an ethnic term.
 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.857
The word "Yehud" or "Jew" does
not become an ethnic term for

00:01:32.857 --> 00:01:35.040
quite some time.
So "Israelites" is the correct

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.540
term for the group that we are
dealing with here.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.466
Hebrew is not bad,
either, it basically is a

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.019
linguistic term that refers to
people who speak Hebrew.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.359
And so the Hebrews--it is
something of a social-ethnic

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.076
term, but based mainly on the
linguistic feature of speaking

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.317
Hebrew.
Okay.

00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:53.930
So no Israelis,
only Israelites.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.887
All right.
We were reaching the end of

00:01:55.887 --> 00:01:59.010
Joshua, and we are going to be
moving on to Judges today.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.389
And the Bible describes the
early Israelite socio-political

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.900
unit as the tribe.
 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.443
And this is what is going to be
featured in the last part of the

00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:09.777
Book of Joshua.
We are going to see that tribes

00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:11.000
are territorial units.
 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.969
A tribe is attached to a
territory.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.190
Within the tribe you have clan
elders, and the clan elders are

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.879
the ones who dispense justice.
 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.389
They make decisions regarding
the general welfare of the

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.849
tribe.
So the second half of the Book

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.229
of Joshua--so the first half
recounts the conquest,

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.205
and then the second half
recounts the division of the

00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:33.266
land among the 12 tribes,
who, it is claimed,

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:36.620
were descended from the 12 sons
of Jacob.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.822
We have a couple of different
lists of the tribes in the

00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:42.210
Bible, so if you take a look
some time,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.085
you might want to compare the
list that is in Genesis 29 or

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:48.526
30.
It is pretty much the same list

00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:50.090
that is in Genesis 49.
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.530
These are in blessings.
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.613
Patriarchs will very often give
blessings of all their children,

00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:58.550
so you look at the names of the
children and you will see the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.870
list of twelve.
You have the six sons of Leah.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.249
You have the four sons of the
two concubines,

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:06.682
Bilhah and Zilpah,
and the two sons of Rachel,

00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:07.979
Joseph and Benjamin.
 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.419
And that is probably the oldest
list that we have.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.357
But if you compare it to
Numbers 26 and the list that is

00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:17.650
in Joshua with the distribution
of the land,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.899
you will see that Levi or Levi
is not included,

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:24.508
presumably because the Levites,
who were to function as a

00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:27.319
priestly class in Israel,
they have no land allotment.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.565
They are supported through the
cultic practices and the

00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:33.210
perquisites that come from the
sacrifices.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.363
And so instead of the Levites,
we find that there are tribes

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:41.419
named for the two sons of
Joseph.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.710
So there is no Joseph tribe per
se.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.330
Joseph's two sons are Ephraim
and Manasseh,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.199
and this is how we then reach
the Number 12.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.252
So there is no Levi in the
later lists, but the Joseph

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:55.190
tribes have been split into
Ephraim and Manasseh,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.840
if you will,
who are said to be the two sons

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.777
of Joseph.
So the consensus is,

00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:03.249
the scholarly consensus is,
that what you have in Canaan is

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:06.301
an alliance of tribes,
perhaps not precisely twelve,

00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:08.266
you know.
At different times there might

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:10.445
have been a different number and
different groups that came

00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:11.610
together at different times.
 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.927
But you have these tribes who
are worshiping Yahweh,

00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:17.660
perhaps not exclusively as we
have seen.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.693
And they have some loose
obligations of mutual defense in

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.209
these different alliances.
 

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:26.357
The Book of Joshua presents
this very idealized portrait of

00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:29.360
these twelve tribes who are
preexistent.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.089
They come into the Land of
Canaan already formed basically

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:33.000
as twelve tribes.
 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.223
They are united with one
another by their covenant with

00:04:36.223 --> 00:04:39.029
Yahweh, and they conquer the
land in concert.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.553
But there are other elements of
the biblical narrative,

00:04:41.553 --> 00:04:43.470
as we have already begun to
talk about,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.555
and will continue to talk about
today as we move into Judges,

00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:49.640
which really suggest there was
much more sporadic cooperation

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.720
among the tribes.
 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.542
You never have more than one or
two really acting in concert

00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:55.600
until the very end of the Book
of Judges.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.348
And so this suggests that there
really was no super-tribal

00:04:59.348 --> 00:05:02.569
government or coordination at
this early stage.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.416
The Ark is said to have
circulated among the different

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:09.972
tribal territories,
it did not rest permanently in

00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:14.543
the territory of one tribe until
somewhat late in the period--it

00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:17.301
comes to rest at a place called
Shiloh.

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:20.066
Shiloh.
And it seems that only in

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:24.158
extraordinary cases would you
have the tribes acting together,

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:27.110
perhaps by decision of the
tribal elders.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.060
But superimposed upon the
authority of the elders is the

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.220
authority of certain inspired
individuals.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.983
And these are known as judges,
and it is the exploits of these

00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:43.199
individuals that are recorded in
the Book of Judges.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.500
And we will turn to the Book of
Judges now.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.071
The Book of Judges is set in
that transitional period between

00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:55.261
the death of Joshua and the
establishment of a monarchic

00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:58.440
system.
It is about a 200-year period,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.860
from about 1200 to 1000 or so.
 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.543
It is an imaginative and
embellished reconstruction of

00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:06.490
that period of transition.
 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.615
We'll also see it is a very
ideologically laden

00:06:09.615 --> 00:06:13.119
reconstruction.
So the stories depict local

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.947
tribal skirmishes,
rather than confrontations

00:06:16.947 --> 00:06:20.509
between nations.
You have pretty much skirmishes

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:22.480
with groups around the country.
 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.251
And that makes a lot of sense
for this 200-year period,

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.149
when Canaan is making a
transition.

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:30.966
A transition from city-states
in the Bronze Age to the

00:06:30.966 --> 00:06:35.286
emerging nation of what will be
Israel, next to it Philistia,

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:37.230
on the east side,
Aram.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.796
So we have--nations are going
to be coming into being by the

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:42.227
end of this period,
but there is this 200-year

00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:45.495
transitional period before you
get the formation of these

00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:46.779
independent states.
 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:50.125
Like Joshua,
the Book of Judges consists of

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:54.904
various sources that were fused
together in a Deuteronomistic

00:06:54.904 --> 00:06:57.680
framework.
I will come back to that.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.331
In fact, it is really a
collection of individual stories

00:07:01.331 --> 00:07:04.518
that center on local heroes,
several of whom are,

00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:07.439
interestingly enough,
socially marginal.

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:08.899
These are pretty scrappy
characters.

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.180
You've got the illegitimate son
of a prostitute.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.610
You've got a bandit.
 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.833
You've got very interesting,
colorful, and as I say,

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:17.540
socially marginal people.
 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.769
And these stories have a real
folkloristic flavor to them.

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:23.923
They're full of drama and a lot
of local color,

00:07:23.923 --> 00:07:27.420
local references to places and
customs and so on.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.950
So if you were to list the
stories of the various judges,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.670
the major judges--we have six
major and six minor judges;

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.081
the minor judge is just simply
a reference to the fact that

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:38.870
they judged for a certain period
of time.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.424
So there are 12 listed in all,
I believe) and there are six

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:45.242
major judges for whom there is a
lengthy story,

00:07:45.242 --> 00:07:47.510
beginning with Ehud in chapter
3.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.220
It is a very funny story.
 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.740
Ehud leads the Israelites
against the Moabites;

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.990
a lot of sort of bathroom humor
in that one.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.438
In chapters 4 and 5,
you have Deborah,

00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:03.342
who helps the Israelites in
battle against certain Canaanite

00:08:03.342 --> 00:08:06.006
groups.
You have three chapters,

00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:08.184
four chapters,
chapters 6-9,

00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:11.250
recording the adventures of
Gideon.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.610
Gideon fights against the
Midianites.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.550
Gideon is interesting.
 

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.720
There are signs in his story
that he is divinely chosen.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.822
There is some evidence of the
annunciation of his birth,

00:08:21.822 --> 00:08:24.360
and some signal that he is
divinely chosen.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.461
Then in 11 and into a little
bit of chapter 12,

00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:30.360
you have the story of Yiftah or
Jephthah,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.842
who fights against the
Ammonites--very interesting and

00:08:33.842 --> 00:08:39.053
tragic story of his daughter,
which echoes similar sorts of

00:08:39.053 --> 00:08:41.789
stories in Greek legend.
 

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.424
You also have in chapters
13-16, Samson who,

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:47.120
of course, fights against the
Philistines.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.840
Samson is somewhat atypical.
 

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.530
He also has a tremendous and
fatal weakness for foreign

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.221
women, and that is a strong
theme throughout the Samson

00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:58.211
stories.
We will come back to some of

00:08:58.211 --> 00:08:59.729
that.
Then towards the end:

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:02.460
you have some interesting
chapters at the end.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.844
17 and 18 tell the story of
Micah or Micah,

00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:08.100
and his idolatrous shrine.
 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.669
And then finally,
the quite horrifying and

00:09:10.669 --> 00:09:13.240
gruesome tale,
beginning in chapter 19,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.294
going on through 20 and 21--
the story of the Levite's

00:09:17.294 --> 00:09:19.590
concubine and the civil war.
 

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.484
We will come back and talk
about some of these in a little

00:09:21.484 --> 00:09:23.421
more detail.
But that is just to give you a

00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:25.873
sense of the different units
that are in the story,

00:09:25.873 --> 00:09:27.049
that are in the book.
 

00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:29.854
And these stories have then
been embedded in a

00:09:29.854 --> 00:09:31.600
Deuteronomistic framework.
 

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.434
This framework provides the
editor's view and pronouncement

00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:37.549
on and judgment of the period.
 

00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:41.296
Some of the stories seem to
have been left pretty much

00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:42.710
intact themselves.
 

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.416
There isn't in many cases,
a lot of interference inside

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:49.985
the story, only a few
interpolations that express the

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:52.250
editor's theology of history.
 

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.842
But the editor's theology of
history is best seen in the

00:09:54.842 --> 00:09:57.765
preface to the book,
which is why I sort of stuck

00:09:57.765 --> 00:10:01.201
these over to the side,
this preface that frames the

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.892
book.
And chapter 1 gives a detailed

00:10:03.892 --> 00:10:08.414
summary of the situation at the
end of Joshua's conquest--taking

00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:11.059
stock,
listing the extensive areas

00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:14.909
that Joshua had failed to take
from the Canaanites,

00:10:14.909 --> 00:10:17.556
despite the impression that is
given by the Book of Joshua

00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:20.388
(certainly the first part of it)
that they did everything they

00:10:20.388 --> 00:10:23.128
were supposed to have done and
fulfilled the commandments to

00:10:23.128 --> 00:10:25.440
Moses and so on.
But here, we get a list of all

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.592
the places they failed to take
from the Canaanites,

00:10:27.592 --> 00:10:29.399
starting in Judah and moving
northward.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.841
They tend to always start in
the southern area,

00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:34.919
in Judah, and then list things
in a northward direction.

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:38.321
Then in Judges 2:1-5,
an angel appears before

00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:41.645
Joshua's death,
and the angel recounts God's

00:10:41.645 --> 00:10:46.129
redemption of the Israelites
from Egypt and then quotes God

00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:50.690
as follows: "I will never break
my covenant with you.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.485
And you, for your part,
must make no covenant with the

00:10:53.485 --> 00:10:56.117
inhabitants of this land;
you must tear down their

00:10:56.117 --> 00:10:58.292
altars."
That is a phrase that is found

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:00.877
in Deuteronomy 12:
again, one of those phrases

00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:04.208
that makes us link Deuteronomy
with all of these subsequent

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:06.040
books,
and we refer to it all as a

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.530
school, the Deuteronomistic
School, because we have these

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.198
phrases from Deuteronomy that
will be peppered throughout the

00:11:11.198 --> 00:11:12.309
rest of these books.
 

00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:15.070
God will be faithful to his
covenant, in other words.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.269
But it is a two-way street.
 

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:18.889
And if Israel does not do her
part, she will be punished.

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:21.915
The editor is setting us up
with that expectation before we

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:24.419
even begin to read an account of
what happens.

00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:27.574
The angel then relates that
Israel has already not been

00:11:27.574 --> 00:11:30.319
obedient, so God has
resolved--this is a fait

00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:33.765
accompli at this point--God
has resolved that He will no

00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:37.269
longer drive the Canaanites out
before the Israelites.

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:41.818
He will leave them as a snare
and a trap to test their resolve

00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:43.309
and their loyalty.
 

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:46.260
So it is a very far cry from
the idealized portrait that we

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.600
had in the first half of the
Book of Joshua.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.669
So that opening announcement
listing all of the ways in which

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.460
they had failed to take the
land,

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.065
and the visit by the angel who
tells them: you have already

00:11:57.065 --> 00:12:00.629
failed in so many ways,
and so God is not even going to

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:04.454
help you to rout the Canaanites
any longer--that is followed

00:12:04.454 --> 00:12:08.279
then in a section from chapter
2:11 through chapter 3:6.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:11.084
And this is a kind of
prospective summary,

00:12:11.084 --> 00:12:14.710
a summary before the fact of
the nation's troubles.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.289
And this is a passage that
expresses the editor's judgment

00:12:19.289 --> 00:12:21.779
on the nation of this period.
 

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:26.114
"Another generation arose after
them, which had not experienced

00:12:26.114 --> 00:12:30.029
the Lord, or the deeds that He
had wrought for Israel.

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:32.890
And the Israelites did what was
offensive to the Lord,"

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.539
literally what was evil in the
eyes of the lord.

00:12:35.539 --> 00:12:37.720
An important phrase:
what was evil in the eyes of

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.464
the Lord.
…They followed other

00:12:39.464 --> 00:12:41.774
gods, from among the gods of the
peoples around them,

00:12:41.774 --> 00:12:44.440
and bowed down to them;
they provoked the Lord….Then

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.611
the Lord was incensed at Israel,
and He handed them over to foes

00:12:47.611 --> 00:12:50.833
who plundered them…as the Lord
had declared and as the Lord had

00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:53.720
sworn to them;
and they were in great distress.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.499
Then the Lord raised up leaders
[see note 1]

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:57.610
who delivered them from those
who plundered them.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.690
But they did not heed their
leaders either;

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.997
they went astray after other
gods and bowed down to

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:04.290
them…
I am sort of skipping, right?

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.210
I am condensing all of this.
 

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.512
…When the Lord raised
up leaders for them,

00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:11.191
the Lord would be with the
leader and would save them from

00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:13.399
their enemies during the
leader's lifetime;

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:16.441
for the Lord would be moved to
pity by their moanings because

00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:18.570
of those who oppressed and
crushed them.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.827
But when the leader died,
they would again act basely,

00:13:21.827 --> 00:13:25.206
even more than the preceding
generation--following other

00:13:25.206 --> 00:13:26.595
gods,
worshiping them,

00:13:26.595 --> 00:13:29.472
and bowing down to them;
they omitted none of their

00:13:29.472 --> 00:13:31.590
practices and stubborn
ways.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.911
So in short,
it is the view of the

00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:37.639
Deuteronomistic historian
expressed here in Judges,

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:41.793
that Israel's crises are caused
by her infidelity to Yahweh,

00:13:41.793 --> 00:13:44.610
through the worship of
Canaanite gods,

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.825
and for this sin,
God sells the Israelites to

00:13:47.825 --> 00:13:51.772
their enemies and then,
moved to pity when they cry out

00:13:51.772 --> 00:13:56.065
under the oppression,
He raises leaders to deliver

00:13:56.065 --> 00:13:58.089
Israel.
This pattern of sin,

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:01.782
punishment, repentance and
deliverance through leaders is

00:14:01.782 --> 00:14:04.750
the recurring pattern throughout
the book.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.924
It punctuates the transition
from each of these leaders that

00:14:08.924 --> 00:14:10.340
God will raise up.
 

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.139
So it is this recurring pattern.
 

00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:15.441
This Deuteronomistic
perspective, as well as

00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:18.360
Deuteronomistic ideology,
generally,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.795
isn't always apparent within
the individual stories

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:23.720
themselves, as I stressed.
 

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.571
Some of them seem to be
pre-Deuteronomistic folktales

00:14:26.571 --> 00:14:28.930
about the exploits of these
local heroes.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.750
They were popular stories.
 

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.059
So Gideon, we'll see,
builds an altar despite the

00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:38.196
fact that we know Deuteronomy
insisted on centralized worship

00:14:38.196 --> 00:14:41.919
and prohibited outlying altars
or multiple altars.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:45.653
He is also known,
his other name,

00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:48.919
if you will,
is Jerubbaal.

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:54.250
It is a name that is made with
Baal, meaning Baal will strive,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.259
or Baal will contend.
 

00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:58.610
So this is an alternate name
for Gideon.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.889
He erects an idol.
 

00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:04.100
The people of Shechem,
where he is--after his death

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.539
they continue to worship Baal
Berit,

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:10.297
the Baal of the covenant,
which is an interesting sort of

00:15:10.297 --> 00:15:13.250
merger of Baalism and covenantal
religion.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.818
So you have a lot of these
elements that presumably the

00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:19.000
Deuteronomist would disapprove.
 

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.008
The story of Samson also
appears to be largely

00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:23.480
pre-Deuteronomistic.
 

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.148
It was again probably a very
popular, entertaining folktale

00:15:27.148 --> 00:15:29.110
about a legendary strong man.
 

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.480
You know, he can lift up the
gates of the city.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.389
He can tie the tails of 300
foxes with torches and so on.

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:39.562
But this great strong man is
undone by his one weakness,

00:15:39.562 --> 00:15:41.870
which is a weakness for foreign
women,

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.957
particularly Philistine women
(at least we think Delilah was

00:15:44.957 --> 00:15:47.225
Philistine).
And that proves to be his

00:15:47.225 --> 00:15:49.850
downfall.
So you can see in a way how

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.169
these stories were fodder for
the Deuteronomistic editor.

00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:57.869
The Deuteronomistic editor
insists that foreign gods often

00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:00.594
accessed through marriage to
foreign women,

00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:03.450
exercised a fatal attraction
for Israel.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.666
And it was the inability to
resist the snare of idolatry

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.830
that would ultimately lead to
ruin.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.166
You have to remember that the
final editing of this narrative

00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:15.480
history is happening in exile.
 

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.848
Right?
It is happening for people for

00:16:17.848 --> 00:16:21.170
whom all of this is ultimately
leading towards a tragedy.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:25.098
All right.
So the leaders who are raised

00:16:25.098 --> 00:16:27.320
by God are called judges.
 

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.458
That is the term that is used
in other Semitic texts to refer

00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:35.251
to leaders in the second
millennium, sometimes human and

00:16:35.251 --> 00:16:36.700
sometimes divine.
 

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.059
So the term is used here in the
biblical text.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:42.257
It refers always to a human
leader, and one who exercises

00:16:42.257 --> 00:16:45.570
many different powers or
functions, not merely judicial.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.297
We think of the word "judge"
really in a judicial context,

00:16:48.297 --> 00:16:51.120
but that was not the extent of
the function of the judge.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.814
The Israelite judge was
actually primarily a military

00:16:54.814 --> 00:16:57.727
leader, commissioned with a
specific task,

00:16:57.727 --> 00:17:00.639
and only in times of national
crisis.

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:04.590
The judge had a charismatic
quality, which in several cases

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.336
is expressed by the phrase,
"the spirit of the Lord came

00:17:08.336 --> 00:17:11.983
upon him."
God would raise up the judge to

00:17:11.983 --> 00:17:15.720
deliver the people from a
specific crisis.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.024
The judge might muster troops
from two tribes,

00:17:19.024 --> 00:17:22.549
or three tribes,
sometimes only a clan or two,

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:25.803
which suggests that there was
no real national entity at this

00:17:25.803 --> 00:17:28.364
particular time.
We never see more than one or

00:17:28.364 --> 00:17:31.259
two tribes acting together or
some clans of a tribe.

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:37.253
But the institution of judges
never created fixed political

00:17:37.253 --> 00:17:39.650
forms.
And each judge differed from

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.509
the last in background,
in class, and even gender.

00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:45.893
We do have one female judge,
Deborah, who did exercise

00:17:45.893 --> 00:17:49.339
judicial functions evidently,
according to the text.

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:53.000
The judges are not chosen
necessarily for their virtue.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.358
Many of them seem to fall into
the literary type of the

00:17:57.358 --> 00:17:59.779
trickster, a bit like Jacob.
 

00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:01.770
Some of them.
They are crafty,

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.077
tricky types.
Gideon is explicitly chosen for

00:18:05.077 --> 00:18:07.648
his weakness,
and not because of his

00:18:07.648 --> 00:18:10.383
strength.
It turns out that he is quite a

00:18:10.383 --> 00:18:13.192
ruthless fighter,
and he is clearly not a devout

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:16.490
Yahwist.
Jepthah is an outlaw.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.940
Samson is hardly a moral
exemplar.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.812
So these are not meant to be
idealized heroes,

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.619
but popular heroes.
 

00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:29.443
There is a very interesting
tension in the Book of Judges

00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:32.789
that will continue beyond into
the Book of Samuel,

00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:35.930
as well, but a tension
regarding kingship.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:41.416
The individual stories seem to
suggest a very deep-seated

00:18:41.416 --> 00:18:43.670
distrust of kingship.
 

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.553
So in Judges 8,
the people ask one of the

00:18:46.553 --> 00:18:49.869
judges, Gideon at that time,
to become king.

00:18:49.869 --> 00:18:52.572
And he responds this way:
"I shall not rule over you,

00:18:52.572 --> 00:18:54.340
nor shall my sons rule over
you.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.970
Yahweh shall rule over you".
 

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:00.173
That is 8:23.
And indeed, the short reign of

00:19:00.173 --> 00:19:04.843
Gideon's ruthless son Abimelekh,
which means "my father is king"

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:07.660
ironically, is a complete
disaster.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.160
The position of judge is
temporary.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.079
God was viewed as the permanent
king in Israel.

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:16.827
The temporary authority of the
judge derived from the kingship

00:19:16.827 --> 00:19:18.908
of God.
So the judge's position could

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.700
not become absolute or
permanent.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.549
That would be a rejection of
God's leadership.

00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:27.905
The Book of Judges seems to be
squarely against the notion of

00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:29.430
kingship in Israel.
 

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.654
But the book as a whole seems
to suggest a certain progression

00:19:33.654 --> 00:19:37.153
towards kingship,
and this emerges from some of

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:40.390
the editorial elements and
interpolations.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:44.831
The final chapters of Judges
document Israel's slow slide

00:19:44.831 --> 00:19:48.480
into disorder and ultimately
into civil war.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.618
Chapter 18 opens with an
ominous statement or phrase that

00:19:52.618 --> 00:19:55.500
recurs throughout the final
chapters.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.849
"In those days,
there was no king in Israel."

00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:04.190
That happens again in chapter
19:1, chapter 21:25.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.481
"And in addition it is said
that everyone did as he pleased,

00:20:07.481 --> 00:20:10.270
or everyone did what was right
in his own eyes."

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.990
It is in chapter 21:25.
 

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.733
By the end of the book,
the Israelites find themselves

00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:20.900
spiraling out of control in an
orgy of violence and rape,

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.400
and in the final chapter,
all out civil war.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.052
A Levite's concubine is raped
by a gang, murdered by the tribe

00:20:30.052 --> 00:20:33.294
of Benjamin.
And this is an atrocity that is

00:20:33.294 --> 00:20:35.740
to be avenged by all the other
tribes.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.149
The Levite takes her body,
cuts it into 12 parts,

00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:40.859
sends a part to each of the
tribes as a call to war,

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:46.269
to join together in a war of
extermination against Benjamin.

00:20:46.269 --> 00:20:49.658
And many scholars have observed
that it is ironic and tragic

00:20:49.658 --> 00:20:53.104
that the one time the tribes do
all act in concert is against

00:20:53.104 --> 00:20:54.309
one of their own.
 

00:20:54.309 --> 00:20:58.062
This is the only time all 12
tribes, or the other 11 tribes,

00:20:58.062 --> 00:21:02.259
come out against a common enemy
and it is the tribe of Benjamin.

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:04.874
At a certain point,
however, they realize with some

00:21:04.874 --> 00:21:07.750
regret that the tribe of
Benjamin is near extinction.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.531
This is not a good thing,
so the other tribes then

00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:15.466
arrange to kidnap women from
Shiloh as mates for the

00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:17.549
remaining Benjaminites.
 

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:22.157
So as a final comment on this
horrible symphony of barbarity,

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:24.812
of rape, murder,
civil war, kidnapping,

00:21:24.812 --> 00:21:27.414
forced marriage,
the Deuteronomistic historian

00:21:27.414 --> 00:21:30.074
concludes the Book of Judges
with this refrain:

00:21:30.074 --> 00:21:32.849
"In those days there was no
king in Israel,

00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:34.980
and every man did as he
pleased."

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.366
It is a wonderfully polysemic
phrase, no king in Israel,

00:21:39.366 --> 00:21:42.396
no human king,
perhaps also given their

00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:44.630
behavior no divine king.
 

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.400
So again I see that as sort of
an ominous refrain throughout.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.549
There was no king in Israel.
 

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:50.980
Every man is doing as he
pleases, and look at the

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.069
situation we have reached by the
end of the Book of Judges.

00:21:54.069 --> 00:21:58.380
The Deuteronomist's explanation
for the moral and social

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.161
bankruptcy of Israel at the end
of the period of the judges at

00:22:03.161 --> 00:22:05.394
the dawn,
or on the eve,

00:22:05.394 --> 00:22:08.605
of the monarchy,
is Israel's continued

00:22:08.605 --> 00:22:12.090
infidelity.
And the prescription for this

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.769
situation at some level in the
text is a king.

00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:20.212
This sits uneasily with an
anti-monarchic trend in some of

00:22:20.212 --> 00:22:22.487
these stories.
But according to the

00:22:22.487 --> 00:22:25.363
Deuteronomistic historian,
the institutional structure of

00:22:25.363 --> 00:22:28.450
a kingdom of God--right,
a sort of "theocracy" is how a

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.794
later Jewish historian would
describe this period--a kingdom

00:22:31.794 --> 00:22:35.195
in which God is the king and the
community is led by inspired

00:22:35.195 --> 00:22:37.859
judges in times of crisis--that
structure,

00:22:37.859 --> 00:22:42.410
that institutional structure
failed to establish stability,

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.000
a stable continuous government.
 

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.099
It failed to provide leadership
against Israel's enemies within

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:50.491
and without.
You have Ammon and Moab to the

00:22:50.491 --> 00:22:52.668
east.
You have the Philistines to the

00:22:52.668 --> 00:22:56.049
west, and they soon manage to
subjugate the entire land.

00:22:56.049 --> 00:22:59.179
So the tribes seem to be
conscious of the need for a

00:22:59.179 --> 00:23:02.369
centralized authority,
a strong central authority;

00:23:02.369 --> 00:23:05.650
and the demand for a king
arises.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.757
In their search for a new
political order,

00:23:08.757 --> 00:23:11.789
the people turn to the prophet
Samuel.

00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:18.017
Samuel is the last in a line of
prophet judges,

00:23:18.017 --> 00:23:24.109
and they ask him to anoint a
king for them.

00:23:24.109 --> 00:23:26.400
So we are moving now into the
Book of Samuel.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.474
And the Book of Samuel deals
with the transition from the

00:23:30.474 --> 00:23:34.329
period of the judges to the
period of the monarchy.

00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:37.471
In the first Book of Samuel,
you have the opening chapters

00:23:37.471 --> 00:23:40.503
that record the birth and career
of Israel's last judge,

00:23:40.503 --> 00:23:43.349
Samuel.
So that is chapters 1-4.

00:23:43.349 --> 00:23:46.599
The next few chapters through
chapter 7 deal with the

00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:49.661
Philistine crisis,
and at this time the Ark of the

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:53.910
Covenant itself is captured and
taken into Philistine territory.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:58.510
Chapters 8-15 give us a story
of Samuel and Saul,

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:01.769
who will be Israel's first
king.

00:24:01.769 --> 00:24:06.071
And then the last half of the
book, 16 on to 31,

00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:10.740
are going to give us the story
of Saul and David.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.952
So 1 Samuel opens with the
story of Samuel's birth to

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:17.720
Hannah, and her dedication of
her son to the service of God at

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.589
Shiloh,
at the sanctuary at Shiloh.

00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:24.282
So Shiloh appears to have been
the most important shrine in the

00:24:24.282 --> 00:24:26.009
period before the monarchy.
 

00:24:26.009 --> 00:24:28.003
The prophet,
Jeremiah, is going to refer to

00:24:28.003 --> 00:24:30.900
Shiloh as the place where God
first made his name to dwell.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.137
You remember the Deuteronomist
is always speaking about

00:24:33.137 --> 00:24:35.665
centralization around a place
where God will cause his name to

00:24:35.665 --> 00:24:37.880
dwell.
At first that was Shiloh.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.120
It has been noted that after
the birth of Samuel,

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.920
the text conveys a sense of
three crises,

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.748
and I have listed them on the
far side of the board over

00:24:48.748 --> 00:24:51.743
there.
The first crisis is a religious

00:24:51.743 --> 00:24:53.940
crisis.
The priest of the time,

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.999
Eli--he is also described as a
judge, but perhaps that is just

00:24:57.999 --> 00:25:01.725
to fit him literarily into the
pattern of leadership that

00:25:01.725 --> 00:25:05.584
predominates in this section of
the Bible--he is said to be

00:25:05.584 --> 00:25:08.619
aging,
and his sons are quite corrupt.

00:25:08.619 --> 00:25:10.319
As a result,
the text says,

00:25:10.319 --> 00:25:13.259
"The word of Yahweh is rare in
those days."

00:25:13.259 --> 00:25:16.690
So there is a crisis in
religious leadership.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.222
There is also a crisis in
political leadership,

00:25:19.222 --> 00:25:21.480
or political succession to some
degree.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.170
Judges 2 tells us that Eli's
two sons are clearly not worthy.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.673
They dishonor the sacrifices,
and according to one reading

00:25:29.673 --> 00:25:32.869
they lie with the women at the
door of the shrine.

00:25:32.869 --> 00:25:36.880
God says he will cut off the
power of Eli's house.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.140
His two sons will die in one
day.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.440
And God will find and raise up
a faithful priest.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.720
But in the meantime,
no leader is apparent.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.430
So we have a crisis in
succession, if you will.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.769
The third crisis is a military
crisis.

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:52.498
In Judges 4-7,
the Israelites suffer a defeat

00:25:52.498 --> 00:25:55.380
at the hands of the Philistines.
 

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.940
I'm sorry, in 1 Samuel!
 

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.130
They suffer defeat at the hands
of the Philistines.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.170
The Ark is captured.
 

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:04.039
Eli's two sons are killed and
the news of all of this kills

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:07.319
Eli, as well.
So when we first meet Samuel we

00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:11.656
wonder: is he going to be the
answer to all of these crises,

00:26:11.656 --> 00:26:15.298
these problems?
Chapter 3 says that the word of

00:26:15.298 --> 00:26:17.990
God comes to Israel through
Samuel.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.204
In contrast to the statement
that the word of God was rare in

00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:22.270
those days, we hear that the
word of God is now coming to

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.230
Israel through Samuel.
 

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.849
It raises some hope.
 

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:27.695
In chapter 7,
Samuel exhorts the people to

00:26:27.695 --> 00:26:31.443
stop serving alien gods and
Ashteroth and to serve God,

00:26:31.443 --> 00:26:34.220
and only then will God deliver
them.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.670
So the people do this,
and Samuel leads them.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.350
He employs--his military
tactics mostly include prayer

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.448
and confession and sacrifice,
but he manages to lead them to

00:26:45.448 --> 00:26:47.740
victory over the Philistines.
 

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.500
God thunders and the
Philistines flee in fear.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.390
So Samuel seems to be combining
in one person several functions.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.260
He is a priest.
He is in the shrine.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.370
He offers sacrifices.
 

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.850
He builds altars.
 

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.940
He is also a seer and a prophet.
 

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.047
He receives the word of the
Lord and, like a prophet,

00:27:06.047 --> 00:27:07.779
he will be anointing kings.
 

00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:11.493
And he is also a judge in the
sense that he leads Israel to

00:27:11.493 --> 00:27:12.710
military victory.
 

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:17.017
But he also travels a circuit
acting as a judge in a judicial

00:27:17.017 --> 00:27:19.529
sense--it says throughout
Israel,

00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:21.973
but really most of the places
we hear about are within the

00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:22.960
confines of Benjamin.
 

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.358
So this story seems to mostly
be focused in the southern

00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:28.460
region in the tribe of Benjamin.
 

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.715
But even he is unable to
provide Israel with the kind of

00:27:32.715 --> 00:27:36.430
leadership that the text
suggests is required.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:40.111
The Philistine threat is going
to reemerge, and the crisis of

00:27:40.111 --> 00:27:42.319
succession will remain,
obviously.

00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:45.626
And so the representatives of
the twelve tribes come together

00:27:45.626 --> 00:27:47.279
to Samuel to ask for a king.
 

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:51.731
Samuel is therefore a kind of a
transition figure between

00:27:51.731 --> 00:27:54.990
Israel, the semi-democratic
confederation,

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.170
and Israel, the nation and
monarchy.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.938
It is going to be a huge
transformation,

00:27:59.938 --> 00:28:02.391
as we will see.
But he is going to be the one

00:28:02.391 --> 00:28:05.289
to bridge the gap to this new
kind of leadership.

00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:08.713
Now as in Judges,
the historical account that we

00:28:08.713 --> 00:28:12.210
have in 1 Samuel contains many
contradictions,

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.515
many duplicates,
so scholars take these as

00:28:14.515 --> 00:28:17.834
evidence of the existence of
various conflicting sources and

00:28:17.834 --> 00:28:21.490
traditions that have been put
together in a larger framework.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.308
So for example,
we have three different

00:28:24.308 --> 00:28:27.349
accounts of the choice of Saul
as king.

00:28:27.349 --> 00:28:30.902
We have two accounts of his
being rejected ultimately by

00:28:30.902 --> 00:28:32.975
God.
We have different accounts of

00:28:32.975 --> 00:28:36.170
how David came to know Saul and
how David entered Saul's

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.507
service.
We have more than one account

00:28:38.507 --> 00:28:41.024
of David's escape into
Philistine territory,

00:28:41.024 --> 00:28:42.780
of his sparing Saul's life.
 

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.650
That happens twice.
 

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.309
Twice he has the opportunity to
kill him.

00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:47.810
Twice he spares his life,
and so on.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.799
Goliath is killed twice.
 

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:52.250
Only one of those occasions is
by David.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.230
On the other occasion he is
killed by some other hero.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:59.269
So most important for us,
however, is the existence of

00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:04.299
sources that hold opposing views
of the institution of kingship.

00:29:04.299 --> 00:29:06.928
This makes for an interesting
and complicated structure in the

00:29:06.928 --> 00:29:08.542
book.
Some of the passages are

00:29:08.542 --> 00:29:11.769
clearly anti-monarchic and some
are clearly pro-monarchic.

00:29:11.769 --> 00:29:15.779
And I have put them up here,
the anti-monarchic passages:

00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:17.950
1 Samuel 8.
There is a passage in 10.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.609
There is a passage in 12.
 

00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:23.295
The pro-monarchic passages are
sandwiched in between these,

00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:24.630
right, in 9 and 11.
 

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.250
So you have this alternating
sequence of anti,

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.589
pro, anti, pro,
anti.

00:29:28.589 --> 00:29:33.585
1 Samuel 8 is a classic example
of the anti-monarchic

00:29:33.585 --> 00:29:36.984
perspective.
Samuel is initially opposed to

00:29:36.984 --> 00:29:39.533
the whole idea.
He apparently resents the

00:29:39.533 --> 00:29:41.220
usurpation of his own power.
 

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.258
Until God says,
Heed the demand of the

00:29:44.258 --> 00:29:45.750
people in everything they say to
you.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.759
For it is not you they have
rejected;

00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:51.059
it is Me they have rejected as
their king… .Heed their

00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:52.796
demand;
but warn them solemnly,

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:55.553
and tell them about the
practices of any king who will

00:29:55.553 --> 00:29:57.530
rule over them.
[1 Sam 8:7-9]

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:58.580
And so Samuel does that.
 

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.599
He does that in verses 11-18.
 

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:03.810
He warns of the tyranny of
kings, the rapaciousness of

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.202
kings, the service and the
sacrifice they will require of

00:30:07.202 --> 00:30:10.836
the people in order to support
their luxurious court life and

00:30:10.836 --> 00:30:14.081
their large harem,
their bureaucracy and their

00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:15.674
army.
"The day will come",

00:30:15.674 --> 00:30:18.122
Samuel warns,
"when you cry out because of

00:30:18.122 --> 00:30:20.750
the king whom you yourselves
have chosen;

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.505
and the Lord will not answer
you on that day"--a very

00:30:23.505 --> 00:30:24.829
anti-monarchic passage.
 

00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:27.231
The people won't listen to him,
and they say quite

00:30:27.231 --> 00:30:29.436
significantly,
"No… We must have a king over

00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:31.462
us,
that we may be like all the

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:34.142
other nations:
Let our king rule over us and

00:30:34.142 --> 00:30:37.009
go out at our head and fight our
battles" .

00:30:37.009 --> 00:30:39.288
So this is an explicit and
ominous rejection,

00:30:39.288 --> 00:30:41.878
not only of Yahweh,
but of Israel's distinctiveness

00:30:41.878 --> 00:30:43.069
from other nations.
 

00:30:43.069 --> 00:30:45.866
And what, after all,
does it mean to be a holy

00:30:45.866 --> 00:30:48.662
nation, but to be a nation
separated out from,

00:30:48.662 --> 00:30:51.769
observing different rules from,
other nations.

00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:53.945
In Samuel 12,
Samuel retires,

00:30:53.945 --> 00:30:58.297
and he says as he does so,
"See, it is the king who leads

00:30:58.297 --> 00:31:00.740
you now.
I am old and gray" .

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.945
And he, again,
outlines what is required of a

00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:07.880
good king, and then again
chastises the people for even

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.825
having asked for a king,
warning that really God must be

00:31:11.825 --> 00:31:13.240
served wholeheartedly.
 

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.490
A king should not interpose
himself.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:19.892
Some have argued that the
editors who compiled the text

00:31:19.892 --> 00:31:23.609
preserved the pro-monarchic
perspective of their sources,

00:31:23.609 --> 00:31:27.162
but they chose to frame the
pro-monarchic passages with

00:31:27.162 --> 00:31:29.529
their own anti-monarchic
passages,

00:31:29.529 --> 00:31:32.839
with the result that the
anti-monarchic passages really

00:31:32.839 --> 00:31:35.903
provide a stronger
interpretative framework and are

00:31:35.903 --> 00:31:38.563
dominant.
The implication is that despite

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:41.750
positive contemporary
evaluations of Israel's kings,

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.771
from the perspective of the
later period,

00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:46.398
from the perspective of the
editors and perhaps those

00:31:46.398 --> 00:31:49.917
sitting in exile,
the institution of kingship was

00:31:49.917 --> 00:31:51.740
a disaster for Israel.
 

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.467
And that negative assessment is
introduced by the

00:31:54.467 --> 00:31:57.932
Deuteronomistic redactor into
his account of the origin of the

00:31:57.932 --> 00:32:00.693
institution: that God,
himself, warned at the time

00:32:00.693 --> 00:32:03.592
that this transition was being
made and this request was being

00:32:03.592 --> 00:32:06.485
made--God himself,
warned that this had the

00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:09.170
potential to be quite
disastrous.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.162
Others feel that the
pro-monarchic and anti-monarchic

00:32:12.162 --> 00:32:14.809
views were contemporaneous and
both ancient,

00:32:14.809 --> 00:32:17.450
and we see that simply
reflected in these dueling

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.106
sources.
So whether one view is older

00:32:20.106 --> 00:32:23.866
and one more recent,
whether both are ancient views

00:32:23.866 --> 00:32:26.650
or both are recent or later
views,

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.920
the end result is a very
complex narrative.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.759
As you read it you feel thrown
back and forth between these

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:34.109
positive and negative
assessments of kingship.

00:32:34.109 --> 00:32:36.793
And we feel these,
and see these very different

00:32:36.793 --> 00:32:39.009
views of monarchy in ancient
Israel.

00:32:39.009 --> 00:32:42.220
So these views really defy
categorization in the end.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.605
They are one of the things that
give the book such complexity

00:32:45.605 --> 00:32:46.789
and sophistication.
 

00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:50.341
Not only is there ambivalence,
however, about the institution

00:32:50.341 --> 00:32:53.333
of kingship or monarchy,
there is also a great deal of

00:32:53.333 --> 00:32:56.039
ambivalence about the first
inhabitant of the office,

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:59.140
the first king,
King Saul, himself.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.849
Judges has three different
accounts of Saul's appointment

00:33:03.849 --> 00:33:06.930
as king.
In chapter 9,1 Samuel 9,

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.170
it is a private affair.
 

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.000
It is just between Saul and the
prophet Samuel.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.689
Samuel anoints Saul as king
with oil in a kind of a private

00:33:16.689 --> 00:33:19.734
encounter.
The anointing of kings is also

00:33:19.734 --> 00:33:22.845
found among other ancient Near
Eastern groups,

00:33:22.845 --> 00:33:24.849
the Hittites,
for example.

00:33:24.849 --> 00:33:27.911
In Israel, it seems to be a
rite of dedication or

00:33:27.911 --> 00:33:30.080
consecration,
making sacred to God,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.440
("con-secration," making
sacred).

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.079
And it is done not just for
kings.

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.769
It is also done for high
priests.

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:38.829
They are also anointed with
sacred oil.

00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:42.498
Then in 1 Samuel 10,
you have Saul's appointment

00:33:42.498 --> 00:33:46.009
represented as being effected by
a lottery.

00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:48.591
It is a lottery that is
presided over by Samuel,

00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:51.831
but there is a lottery system
and the lot falls to Samuel to

00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:53.039
be appointed king.
 

00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:55.371
In the next chapter,
in 1 Samuel 11,

00:33:55.371 --> 00:33:59.368
we have Saul victorious in a
battle over the Ammonites and so

00:33:59.368 --> 00:34:02.700
he is elected by popular
acclaim, if you will.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:06.436
These could all be
complementary ways of his slowly

00:34:06.436 --> 00:34:08.230
securing the position.
 

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.519
They could be seen as competing
accounts.

00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:15.309
But he is an important and a
striking figure.

00:34:15.309 --> 00:34:18.664
Nevertheless there seems to
have been some controversy about

00:34:18.664 --> 00:34:21.280
Saul and it is preserved within
our sources.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.264
On the one hand,
he is described in very

00:34:23.264 --> 00:34:24.660
positive terms.
He is tall.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.480
He is handsome.
He is winning.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.440
He is charismatic.
 

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.519
In fact, he is associated with
ecstatic prophecy:

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:34.305
the spirit of the Lord comes
upon him and he prophesies in a

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:37.450
sort of raving and dancing and
ecstatic mode.

00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:38.949
He defends his own tribe.
 

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:41.929
He is from the tribe of
Benjamin, and he defends them

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:43.190
from Ammonite raids.
 

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:47.489
And he is hailed by the tribes
as a leader in time of war.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:51.110
As king he did enjoy some
initial military victories.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.789
He drove the Philistines from
their garrisons,

00:34:53.789 --> 00:34:57.599
and he was such a popular and
natural leader that even Samuel,

00:34:57.599 --> 00:35:01.480
who at first resented Saul and
resented the idea of a king,

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.428
came to appreciate him and was
said to really grieve for him

00:35:05.428 --> 00:35:08.233
upon his death.
But once David enters the

00:35:08.233 --> 00:35:11.730
story, which is about halfway
through the Book of 1 Samuel

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.949
(it's 1 Samuel 16),
then we begin to see clearly

00:35:14.949 --> 00:35:18.689
negative assessments of Saul,
perhaps because the sources

00:35:18.689 --> 00:35:22.695
about David stem from circles
that were loyal to the House of

00:35:22.695 --> 00:35:25.154
David,
and David is going to succeed

00:35:25.154 --> 00:35:27.949
Saul, obviously,
as the second king of Israel.

00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:31.659
Perhaps the negative assessment
is because of Saul's ultimate

00:35:31.659 --> 00:35:33.019
failure and suicide.
 

00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:37.326
That had to be accounted for by
identifying some fatal flaw in

00:35:37.326 --> 00:35:40.090
him.
So now his ecstatic prophecies

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.989
are presented as irrational fits
of mad behavior.

00:35:43.989 --> 00:35:47.968
So where once the spirit of the
Lord was said to come upon him,

00:35:47.968 --> 00:35:51.690
now he is said to be seized by
an evil spirit from the Lord

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:55.219
that rushes upon him suddenly
causing him to rave in his

00:35:55.219 --> 00:35:58.860
house.
Elsewhere he commits errors.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.570
He doesn't obey Samuel's
instructions to the letter,

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.440
and that is going to cost him
the support of Samuel and

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.241
ultimately God.
We have two stories of

00:36:07.241 --> 00:36:10.010
disobedience related in 1
Samuel.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.110
One is in chapter 13.
 

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.138
He sees that the morale of his
men is sagging and so to rally

00:36:16.138 --> 00:36:19.159
them together he officiates at a
sacrifice.

00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:22.464
He was supposed to wait for
Samuel to arrive and do it,

00:36:22.464 --> 00:36:26.135
but he sees that it needs to
happen now, and so he officiates

00:36:26.135 --> 00:36:27.909
at the sacrifice himself.
 

00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:31.087
And this appropriation of a
priestly function enrages

00:36:31.087 --> 00:36:34.142
Samuel, and this is Samuel's
first pronouncement or

00:36:34.142 --> 00:36:37.625
prediction that God will not
establish Saul's dynasty over

00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:39.253
Israel,
despite the fact,

00:36:39.253 --> 00:36:42.291
by the way, that other kings at
other times will sacrifice with

00:36:42.291 --> 00:36:44.274
impunity.
So it is interesting because

00:36:44.274 --> 00:36:47.162
David and others will sacrifice
and it doesn't seem to be a

00:36:47.162 --> 00:36:49.098
problem.
But here it is given as the

00:36:49.098 --> 00:36:52.288
occasion for Samuel's fury and
his first pronouncement that the

00:36:52.288 --> 00:36:54.500
dynasty of Saul will not be
established.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.175
In chapter 15,
we have a second instance of

00:36:57.175 --> 00:37:00.170
disobedience that earns Samuel's
disapproval.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:04.146
Again, against Samuel's order,
he spares the life of an enemy

00:37:04.146 --> 00:37:06.469
king.
This is King Agag.

00:37:06.469 --> 00:37:10.116
He spares his life and
otherwise violates the terms of

00:37:10.116 --> 00:37:12.387
herem:
this notion of total

00:37:12.387 --> 00:37:16.791
destruction or devotion of booty
and enemies to God through total

00:37:16.791 --> 00:37:19.861
destruction.
And, again, when he violates

00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:23.591
the order of herem,
Samuel again announces that God

00:37:23.591 --> 00:37:25.750
regrets having made Saul king.
 

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.920
"The Lord has this day torn the
kingship over Israel away from

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.040
you and has given it to another
who is worthier than you."

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.679
That is chapter 15:28.
 

00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:37.871
In any event,
with his support eroding,

00:37:37.871 --> 00:37:42.659
Saul seems to sink into a deep
depression and paranoia.

00:37:42.659 --> 00:37:45.840
And toward the end of his life,
he is depicted as being

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.432
completely obsessed with David
and the threat that David poses

00:37:49.432 --> 00:37:52.599
to Saul himself,
but also his dynasty.

00:37:52.599 --> 00:37:56.058
Saul is angry that his own son,
Jonathan, who presumably should

00:37:56.058 --> 00:37:59.306
succeed him to the throne,
has a deep friendship with

00:37:59.306 --> 00:38:02.224
David and, in fact,
throws his support over to

00:38:02.224 --> 00:38:04.039
David instead of himself.
 

00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:08.866
In several jealous rages Saul
attempts to kill David or to

00:38:08.866 --> 00:38:12.000
have him and his supporters
killed.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.304
In one particularly violent
incident he kills 85 priests

00:38:16.304 --> 00:38:20.296
whom he believes have given
shelter to David and his

00:38:20.296 --> 00:38:23.911
supporters.
So in these encounters between

00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:27.329
Saul and David,
the sources portray Saul as

00:38:27.329 --> 00:38:30.500
this raving,
obsessed paranoid person,

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.090
and David is seen as a sort of
innocent victim,

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:38.460
and he protests his loyalty and
his support for Saul.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.843
He does not seem to understand
why Saul should view him as a

00:38:41.843 --> 00:38:44.145
threat.
And twice he passes up the

00:38:44.145 --> 00:38:47.030
opportunity to do away with Saul
himself.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.493
He says, I will not raise my
hand against the Lord's

00:38:50.493 --> 00:38:53.158
anointed.
So the portrayal of Saul as a

00:38:53.158 --> 00:38:56.995
raving and paranoid man who is
obsessed with David probably

00:38:56.995 --> 00:39:00.832
reflects the views of later
writers who were apologists for

00:39:00.832 --> 00:39:02.420
the House of David.
 

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.465
Positive views of Saul's
character weren't entirely

00:39:05.465 --> 00:39:07.780
extinguished by the biblical
writer.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.045
David's own lament,
when he hears of Saul's death

00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:17.109
by suicide, and Jonathan's
death, also, may reflect Saul's

00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:19.420
tremendous popularity.
 

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.899
David orders the Judahites to
sing what is called the Song of

00:39:23.899 --> 00:39:25.990
the Bow in praise of Saul.
 

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.080
Your glory, O Israel,
Lies slain on your heights;

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.280
How have the mighty fallen!
 

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.360
...
Saul and Jonathan,

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.240
Beloved and cherished,
Never parted

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.840
In life or in death!
 

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.580
They were swifter than eagles,
They were stronger than lions!

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.760
Daughters of Israel,
Weep over Saul,

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.869
Who clothed you in crimson and
finery,

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:46.420
Who decked your robes with
jewels of gold.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.230
How have the mighty fallen
In the thick of battle--

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.220
Jonathan, slain on your heights!
 

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.080
I grieve for you,
My brother Jonathan,

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.540
You were most dear to me.
 

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.910
Your love was wonderful to me
More than the love of women.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.807
How have the mighty fallen,
The weapons of war perished!

00:40:00.807 --> 00:40:03.795
[2 Sam 1:19,23-27]
Of course, representing David

00:40:03.795 --> 00:40:06.566
as bewailing Saul and Jonathan
in these terms,

00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:09.829
would have served an apologetic
function, as well.

00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:14.397
And David is cleared of any
part in or even desire for the

00:40:14.397 --> 00:40:17.602
death of Saul.
So half way through the Book of

00:40:17.602 --> 00:40:21.261
Samuel then, is the first part
of the story of David and his

00:40:21.261 --> 00:40:24.745
encounters with Saul,
running through to the end of 1

00:40:24.745 --> 00:40:28.027
Samuel and the first few
chapters of 2 Samuel--about

00:40:28.027 --> 00:40:30.896
Second Samuel 5.
And this whole section,

00:40:30.896 --> 00:40:34.835
this first part of the story of
David, has the feel of a

00:40:34.835 --> 00:40:37.269
historical novel,
or narrative.

00:40:37.269 --> 00:40:40.079
There is a lot of direct speech
and lots of dialogue.

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:42.769
So it has the feel of fiction,
of a novel.

00:40:42.769 --> 00:40:47.760
Given that the ruling family in
Judah was referred to as the

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.059
House of David for several
centuries,

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:54.512
and given a wonderful
archaeological find dating from

00:40:54.512 --> 00:40:58.629
the ninth century--it's a Syrian
inscription that refers to the

00:40:58.629 --> 00:41:02.414
House of David dating to the
ninth century--so given those

00:41:02.414 --> 00:41:06.532
two pieces of evidence,
I think most scholars would see

00:41:06.532 --> 00:41:08.230
David as a real person.
 

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:11.715
None of the details of the
biblical account can really be

00:41:11.715 --> 00:41:14.765
confirmed, of course,
but I think the consensus is

00:41:14.765 --> 00:41:16.820
that David was a real person.
 

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.156
There are obviously some who do
not hold that and believe this

00:41:21.156 --> 00:41:23.360
is a much later retrojection.
 

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.251
But David is,
surprisingly enough,

00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:28.530
presented as very human.
 

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:32.287
He is not a divine character,
and he is certainly not even a

00:41:32.287 --> 00:41:34.070
highly virtuous character.
 

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.564
The first installment of his
story through about 2 Samuel 5,

00:41:37.564 --> 00:41:40.940
is clearly sympathetic to David
and favorable to David.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.855
But it is not entirely
obsequious or flattering,

00:41:43.855 --> 00:41:47.764
which is the sort of genre that
we very often have coming out of

00:41:47.764 --> 00:41:50.989
ancient Near Eastern texts
dealing with royalty.

00:41:50.989 --> 00:41:54.034
This part of the story may be
an apology for David,

00:41:54.034 --> 00:41:56.469
but it is also subtly critical
of him.

00:41:56.469 --> 00:41:59.132
Certainly David is a hero,
but if you read between the

00:41:59.132 --> 00:42:00.890
lines, he is also an
opportunist.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.701
He is an outlaw.
He serves as a mercenary for

00:42:03.701 --> 00:42:07.226
the Philistines for some of the
time, and he can act pretty

00:42:07.226 --> 00:42:10.389
unscrupulously.
So this isn't royal propaganda

00:42:10.389 --> 00:42:13.771
in the simple sense,
even though to some degree it

00:42:13.771 --> 00:42:15.909
may be an apology for David.
 

00:42:15.909 --> 00:42:19.202
As we are going to see in a
minute, David will fare much,

00:42:19.202 --> 00:42:22.260
much worse in the second
installment of his story,

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.619
and this is the story that
takes up the bulk of 2 Samuel.

00:42:25.619 --> 00:42:32.837
So moving now into the Book of
2 Samuel and the latter part of

00:42:32.837 --> 00:42:35.849
David's story.
Actually, no, I lied!

00:42:35.849 --> 00:42:38.859
We are going to back up for one
minute just to talk about the

00:42:38.859 --> 00:42:41.818
different accounts of David's
emergence--the three different

00:42:41.818 --> 00:42:43.199
stories,
if you will,

00:42:43.199 --> 00:42:45.927
of David's discovery,
because in the first,

00:42:45.927 --> 00:42:48.655
Samuel, again,
secretly anoints him king of

00:42:48.655 --> 00:42:51.610
Judah.
So it is a private affair.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:55.208
He anoints him as the king of
Judah, which is just the

00:42:55.208 --> 00:42:59.239
southern region.
He does this in Saul's lifetime.

00:42:59.239 --> 00:43:01.907
David is the youngest of his
father's sons,

00:43:01.907 --> 00:43:05.590
so this anointment is another
reversal of primogeniture,

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:09.552
the exaltation of the lowly
that we see so often in the

00:43:09.552 --> 00:43:11.931
Bible.
In the second account we first

00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:15.453
meet David when he is summoned
to play music for a disturbed

00:43:15.453 --> 00:43:17.822
Saul who,
of course, is suffering from

00:43:17.822 --> 00:43:19.179
these irrational fits.
 

00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:23.498
And then in the third account,
David is introduced as the

00:43:23.498 --> 00:43:27.739
98-pound weakling who takes on
the legendary Goliath.

00:43:27.739 --> 00:43:31.889
Later, after the death of Saul,
David will be anointed king in

00:43:31.889 --> 00:43:34.269
Hebron over his own tribe,
Judah.

00:43:34.269 --> 00:43:37.659
He then manages to either win
over or kill off the rest of

00:43:37.659 --> 00:43:40.713
Saul's household,
anyone else who could make a

00:43:40.713 --> 00:43:44.630
dynastic claim to the throne
based on descent from Saul,

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.378
anyone who might be a threat to
his claim to kingship in the

00:43:48.378 --> 00:43:49.840
more northern region.
 

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.309
And eventually the northern
tribes will also elect him king.

00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:58.409
And so the united kingship of
the northern parts of Israel and

00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:01.670
the Tribe of Judah is finally
formed.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:05.378
Once his reign seems secure,
and the nation is consolidated

00:44:05.378 --> 00:44:09.278
behind him, David then captures
Jerusalem and launches attacks

00:44:09.278 --> 00:44:11.260
against Israel's neighbors.
 

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.400
And the text says that the Lord
gives him victory.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.050
This is in 2 Samuel 8 now,
verses 6 and 14.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.909
God gives him victory.
 

00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:23.789
The biblical narrative depicts
him as the master of a huge

00:44:23.789 --> 00:44:27.260
empire that stretches from the
desert to the sea.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:31.175
There is very little evidence
that Israel actually established

00:44:31.175 --> 00:44:34.769
lasting control over all of the
states in this region.

00:44:34.769 --> 00:44:37.980
It's likely that David was able
to take advantage of a power

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.802
vacuum.
Egypt's hold on Canaan was

00:44:40.802 --> 00:44:43.650
crumbling.
Again, the migration of these

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:47.565
"peoples of the seas" throughout
this region and other peoples

00:44:47.565 --> 00:44:51.223
pressing in from the desert had
really upset the two major

00:44:51.223 --> 00:44:53.789
powers in Mesopotamia and in
Egypt,

00:44:53.789 --> 00:44:55.780
and they really had lost
control of the central region.

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.341
And so David was--and the
Israelites were able to take

00:44:58.341 --> 00:45:01.000
advantage of this and establish
an independent state.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.695
And David's independent state
was probably able to dominate

00:45:03.695 --> 00:45:06.484
the area for a little while,
ending the Philistine threat,

00:45:06.484 --> 00:45:08.408
for example,
and possibly even collecting

00:45:08.408 --> 00:45:10.812
tribute from some of the
surrounding or neighboring

00:45:10.812 --> 00:45:14.409
states,
Ammon and Moab and Edom.

00:45:14.409 --> 00:45:19.686
But it is the prophet Nathan,
who transmits God's promise to

00:45:19.686 --> 00:45:24.694
David, a promise that will
become the basis for the faith

00:45:24.694 --> 00:45:28.539
in the eternity of the Davidic
kingdom.

00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:32.159
And that happens in 2 Samuel,
chapter 7:8-17,

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:36.190
a very important passage and
very important in the

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:40.880
construction of what we will see
is a royal ideology;

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.314
a royal ideology that comes to
contest some of the basic

00:45:45.314 --> 00:45:47.330
ideology of the nation.
 

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:48.809
"Thus says the Lord of hosts."
 

00:45:48.809 --> 00:45:52.030
This is Nathan speaking now,
quoting God:

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.813
"Thus says the Lord of
hosts, I took you from the

00:45:54.813 --> 00:45:56.670
pasture, from following the
sheep,

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.188
that you should be prince over
my people Israel,

00:45:59.188 --> 00:46:02.082
and I have been with you
wherever you went and have cut

00:46:02.082 --> 00:46:04.280
off all your enemies from before
you,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.584
and I will make for you a great
name like the name of the great

00:46:07.584 --> 00:46:08.650
ones of the earth.
 

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:11.087
And I will appoint a place for
my people Israel,

00:46:11.087 --> 00:46:13.575
and will plant them,
that they may dwell in their

00:46:13.575 --> 00:46:15.650
own place, and be disturbed no
more;

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:17.889
and violent men shall afflict
them no more,

00:46:17.889 --> 00:46:20.130
as formerly,
from the time that I appointed

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:23.660
judges over my people Israel;
and I will give you rest from

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.760
all your enemies.
 

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.261
Moreover the Lord declares to
you that the Lord will make you

00:46:27.261 --> 00:46:29.539
a house."
[meaning here dynasty]

00:46:29.539 --> 00:46:31.750
"When your days are fulfilled
and you lie down with your

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.840
fathers, I will raise up your
offspring after you,

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.131
who shall come forth from your
body, and I will establish his

00:46:37.131 --> 00:46:39.635
kingdom.
He shall build a house [meaning

00:46:39.635 --> 00:46:41.211
now a temple]
for my name,

00:46:41.211 --> 00:46:44.869
and I will establish the throne
of his kingdom forever.

00:46:44.869 --> 00:46:47.670
I will be his father,
and he shall be my son.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.969
When he commits iniquity,
I will chasten him with the rod

00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:53.679
of men, with the stripes of the
sons of men;

00:46:53.679 --> 00:46:56.024
but I will not take my
steadfast love from him,

00:46:56.024 --> 00:46:58.572
as I took it from Saul,
whom I put away from before

00:46:58.572 --> 00:47:01.244
you.
And your house and your kingdom

00:47:01.244 --> 00:47:04.019
shall be made sure forever
before me;

00:47:04.019 --> 00:47:06.960
your throne shall be
established forever.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.198
In accordance with all these
words, and in accordance with

00:47:09.198 --> 00:47:10.965
all this vision,
Nathan spoke to David." [RSV;

00:47:10.965 --> 00:47:13.232
see note 3]
It's a very important passage,

00:47:13.232 --> 00:47:16.214
and it's with this passage that
you have the idea of an eternal

00:47:16.214 --> 00:47:18.811
and unconditional covenant
between God and the House of

00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:21.349
David,
or the dynasty of David.

00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:23.722
And this is now the fourth
covenant that we have met:

00:47:23.722 --> 00:47:26.050
the Noahide covenant,
the patriarchical Covenant,

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:30.239
the Sinaitic Covenant,
and now the Davidic covenant.

00:47:30.239 --> 00:47:33.101
Note that God says that David
and his descendants may be

00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:34.090
punished for sin.
 

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:37.524
They certainly will be punished
for sin, but he will not take

00:47:37.524 --> 00:47:40.329
the kingdom away from them as he
did from Saul.

00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:43.625
So God's oath to preserve the
Davidic dynasty and,

00:47:43.625 --> 00:47:45.980
by implication we will see
later,

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.869
next time, Jerusalem as well,
would lead eventually to a

00:47:49.869 --> 00:47:53.760
popular belief in the
invincibility of the Holy City.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.466
In addition,
the belief in Israel's ultimate

00:47:57.466 --> 00:48:02.465
deliverance from enemies became
bound up with David and his

00:48:02.465 --> 00:48:05.356
dynasty.
David was idealized by later

00:48:05.356 --> 00:48:08.737
biblical and post-biblical
tradition, and became the

00:48:08.737 --> 00:48:10.130
paradigmatic king.
 

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:13.792
So even when the kingdom fell
finally to the Babylonians in

00:48:13.792 --> 00:48:17.012
586, the promise to David's
House was believed to be

00:48:17.012 --> 00:48:19.410
eternal.
The community looked to the

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:23.057
future for a restoration of the
Davidic line or Davidic king,

00:48:23.057 --> 00:48:25.588
or a messiah.
Now the Hebrew word

00:48:25.588 --> 00:48:29.445
messiah simply means
anointed, one who is

00:48:29.445 --> 00:48:33.630
"meshiach" is anointed
with the holy oil.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:37.393
That is a reference to the fact
that the king was initiated into

00:48:37.393 --> 00:48:40.679
office by means of holy oil
being poured on his head.

00:48:40.679 --> 00:48:46.001
So King David was the messiah
of God, the king anointed by or

00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:47.818
to God.
And in the exile,

00:48:47.818 --> 00:48:50.275
Israelites would pray for
another messiah,

00:48:50.275 --> 00:48:53.690
meaning another king from the
House of David appointed and

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:57.165
anointed by God to rescue them
from enemies and reestablish

00:48:57.165 --> 00:49:01.059
them as a nation at peace in
their land as David had done.

00:49:01.059 --> 00:49:03.675
So the Jewish hope for a
messiah, speaking now in the

00:49:03.675 --> 00:49:06.190
post-biblical where it is
correct to say Jewish,

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:09.392
the Jewish hope for a messiah
was thus always political and

00:49:09.392 --> 00:49:12.239
national.
It involved the restoration of

00:49:12.239 --> 00:49:15.599
the nation in its land under a
Davidic king.

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:18.938
We are going to talk next time
about the royal ideology that

00:49:18.938 --> 00:49:21.881
begins to emerge and challenge
the older Sinaitic and

00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:23.239
covenantal ideology.
 

00:49:23.239 --> 00:49:24.920
But that is too much to get
into now.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.076
So we will deal with that on
Wednesday and then move on

00:49:28.076 --> 00:49:31.000
through the rest of the
Deuteronomistic history.

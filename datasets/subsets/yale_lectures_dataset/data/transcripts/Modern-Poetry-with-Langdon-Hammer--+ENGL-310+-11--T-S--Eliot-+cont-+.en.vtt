00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:07.029
Professor Langdon
Hammer: On Monday I left off

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.954
talking about this--what shall
we call it--exciting and

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:21.393
dramatic ambivalence that one
finds in the early Eliot that

00:00:21.393 --> 00:00:27.421
expresses itself in his
relationship to literary

00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:33.393
tradition;
where on the one hand,

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:42.551
he presents himself as a truly
subversive and aggressive

00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:49.869
entrant into literary tradition,
someone who's really going to

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.422
shake it up and transform it;
and on the other hand,

00:00:53.422 --> 00:00:56.532
as someone who is a
traditionalist,

00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:01.745
who is going to speak with
deference and seek – the word

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:05.769
he uses is "conformity"--with
the past.

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:12.637
Somehow, both these things are
going on at the same time and in

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:15.849
relationship to each other.
 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:19.888
And "Prufrock" itself is a
poem, I think,

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:26.349
preoccupied with this kind of
ambivalence that I'm describing.

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:32.542
On the one hand,
it is a poem that introduces us

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:40.843
to a speaker who lacks will and
who seems timorous and timid and

00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:45.060
who hesitates before action.
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.621
On the other hand,
he is a speaker who says to us,

00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.819
"There will be time to murder
and create,"

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.952
as if creating and murdering
were, in fact,

00:01:55.952 --> 00:02:01.069
in some relation and might go
on at the same time.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.196
And in fact,
if one does have some sense of

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:07.470
creativity as involving a kind
of aggression,

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.266
or even murderousness,
one might hesitate before it,

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:16.020
right?
These psychological dimensions

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.583
that I'm describing have,
well, Freudian and Oedipal

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:28.759
dimensions that I think are
readily apparent.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:35.969
How is it possible for Eliot to
claim the authority of past

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:42.048
literature without,
at the same time,

00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:53.879
either destroying it or utterly
submitting himself to it?

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.522
This problem expresses,
I think, Eliot's double

00:02:57.522 --> 00:03:00.689
relation to the past and is
expressed,

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.213
as I was suggesting last time,
in the ambiguous use of

00:03:05.213 --> 00:03:10.420
quotation that seems to hover
between some kind of deferential

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.627
honoring of the literature of
the past and something much more

00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:18.699
provocative and often parodic.
 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:23.710
And you can think of the many
different texts that "Prufrock"

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.052
alludes to and borrows,
only some of which are traced

00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:29.889
in your footnotes.
 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:36.884
In fact, there's a great many
more than you find in your

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:40.598
footnotes.
There are quotations from

00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:45.062
Marvell, from the Bible,
from Dante, from Twelfth

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:48.946
Night.
Well, there's that opening

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:52.960
quotation from Dante,
from the Gospels,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.825
too.
Prufrock's world-weariness,

00:03:56.825 --> 00:04:01.920
you know, "For I have known
them all already,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.611
known them all,"
as understood in the poetic

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:11.133
context, this seems to,
well, express his sense of

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:15.563
belatedness and of
the--everything having in some

00:04:15.563 --> 00:04:18.240
sense been done already.
 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.610
 
 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.980
In, again, Freudian or Oedipal
terms, terms that Harold Bloom

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.278
would develop as a reader of
Eliot in his own criticism very

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:35.920
influentially,
you can put the problem this

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:43.175
way: how can Eliot come to write
in the father's place without

00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:48.290
killing him or being overwhelmed
by him?

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.649
In his confrontation with the
past, neither he,

00:04:53.649 --> 00:05:00.639
Eliot, nor the past must be
destroyed, or the game's over.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.058
Eliot thereby swerves,
you could say,

00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:09.850
alternatively from each of
these unacceptable alternatives.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.344
And that kind of
back-and-forth-ness you feel in

00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:18.170
Prufrock's divagations and
wanderings.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.215
You see it throughout Eliot's
early career in his funny

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:28.821
mixture of avant-gardism and
traditionalism because he's both

00:05:28.821 --> 00:05:33.112
those things.
I've been describing this in

00:05:33.112 --> 00:05:35.139
psychological terms.
 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.661
We could also think about it in
social terms,

00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:39.839
and I think it's important to
do so.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:45.604
This Oedipal drama that I'm
describing is also a social

00:05:45.604 --> 00:05:48.379
drama in important ways.
 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.944
Here is a question:
how does a young American –

00:05:53.944 --> 00:06:00.785
because that's what he was –
go and win a place in English

00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:05.694
literary culture,
insert himself in a tradition

00:06:05.694 --> 00:06:09.363
that includes Shakespeare,
Milton, Tennyson,

00:06:09.363 --> 00:06:13.610
and Wordsworth;
insert himself not only as a

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.418
member of that tradition but as
a central explainer of it and

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:24.839
tastemaker, which is in fact
what Eliot would become?

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:31.322
Last time I pointed out that
Eliot's expatriation,

00:06:31.322 --> 00:06:34.629
his going from the U.S.
 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:40.520
to London, was a rejection not
only of America and

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.689
American-ness,
but in particular a rejection

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:51.459
of his father,
who died while he was abroad;

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:56.214
and there was a certain amount
of question about whether Eliot

00:06:56.214 --> 00:07:00.579
would return in time to see his
father before he died.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:06.004
In a very short time in London,
Eliot becomes more English than

00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:10.645
the English.
It's a strange and marvelous,

00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:13.589
fascinating development.
 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:19.598
He learns or creates a certain
style of English-ness that he

00:07:19.598 --> 00:07:24.689
then goes on to teach to the
English themselves.

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:28.725
This is what Williams –
William Carlos Williams – and,

00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:32.620
in fact, other American writers
despised about Eliot,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.678
that he was the--not just the
Anglophile that he was,

00:07:38.678 --> 00:07:44.269
but the true English authority
that he became.

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:48.153
He made himself,
without any previous standing,

00:07:48.153 --> 00:07:52.966
any connections really in
London or in English culture--he

00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:56.850
made himself a central cultural
authority,

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.818
which became in a very short
time almost synonymous with

00:08:00.818 --> 00:08:02.189
tradition itself.
 

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:07.577
This is an amazing and
remarkable achievement and an

00:08:07.577 --> 00:08:10.430
important cultural event.
 

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:17.092
The thing is that the tradition
that Eliot expounded was

00:08:17.092 --> 00:08:22.180
something to a large degree he
invented.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.796
Eliot is not,
as he is often seen,

00:08:26.796 --> 00:08:34.490
I think, the defender of a
social order that was passing

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.912
away.
And sometimes Yeats represents

00:08:37.912 --> 00:08:39.210
himself that way.
 

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:46.141
Rather, Eliot is the
representative of a new class,

00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:54.735
a new class opposing itself to
the traditional social authority

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:59.815
of money and of blood,
aristocracy,

00:08:59.815 --> 00:09:06.701
that makes its claim for social
authority on the basis of

00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:10.003
knowledge,
technical knowledge and

00:09:10.003 --> 00:09:13.557
expertise above all:
a kind of professional class

00:09:13.557 --> 00:09:18.139
into which you,
too, are being educated largely

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:21.389
through the modern university.
 

00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:26.311
Eliot's tradition,
that I'm saying he invented or

00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:31.336
created, described,
defined--he made it out of the

00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:35.539
education he had received at
Harvard.

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.711
And he also,
importantly,

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:42.599
made it outside of the
classroom, in part in the school

00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:46.347
of Ezra Pound who,
you might remember from last

00:09:46.347 --> 00:09:50.175
week, specifically also when he
expatriates, leaves behind the

00:09:50.175 --> 00:09:53.785
vulgo,
the people, and sees himself as

00:09:53.785 --> 00:09:58.155
entering into some kind of
timeless tradition that he

00:09:58.155 --> 00:10:03.113
identifies – Pound does –
with the "spirits of irony and

00:10:03.113 --> 00:10:06.590
destiny."
That's his phrase to describe

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.049
the great writers of the past.
 

00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:15.741
Eliot also enters this kind of
semi-imaginary community of

00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:19.622
tradition.
Eliot's sense of tradition is

00:10:19.622 --> 00:10:24.907
established in part through his
quotations and allusions in his

00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:27.665
poetry,
in part and importantly,

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:32.269
and I'll talk more about it
today, through his criticism.

00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:36.197
This kind of tradition with
which Eliot allies himself,

00:10:36.197 --> 00:10:39.470
you could say bankrolls
everything he does,

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:45.916
legitimizes and authorizes,
gives sanction and precedent to

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:50.139
what was Eliot's strange new
poetry.

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:54.770
Frost, you remember,
as he says, "goes to market" so

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.129
he could stand on his own two
feet.

00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:05.870
Well, Eliot went to tradition
to establish his autonomy.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:13.967
And tradition allows him to,
well, to stand apart both from

00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:20.110
the genteel audiences that Pound
resisted,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.619
that Frost in certain ways
courted, and also allows Eliot

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:27.679
to stand apart from the
avant-garde,

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:34.360
which he has a kind of
ambiguous relationship to;

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.505
allows him to stand apart,
you could say,

00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:39.080
from the audiences of both a
magazine like The

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.870
Atlantic or Harper's
on the one hand,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.197
and on the other hand a
magazine like the Little

00:11:45.197 --> 00:11:48.845
Review or Blast even,
where he did appear,

00:11:48.845 --> 00:11:53.000
or Broom --some of those
magazines I showed you in the

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.503
first week.
Eliot's own magazine,

00:11:55.503 --> 00:11:59.446
which becomes an important
vehicle for his work and his

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:03.170
ideas and his authority and his
presence in literary

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:07.771
culture--and you can go back and
look at its cover in the images

00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:09.669
for the first week.
 

00:12:09.669 --> 00:12:12.849
His magazine was The
Criterion,

00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:17.232
a magazine that had a kind of
semi-official look and

00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:21.553
represents the fantasy of,
I think, a kind of

00:12:21.553 --> 00:12:25.330
institutional and universal
authority.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.500
Well, how do you go about
inventing tradition?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:36.522
In order to do so,
Eliot had to demonstrate that

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:42.929
the received existing tradition
was a false one.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:48.132
"The Metaphysical Poets" is the
great and peculiar,

00:12:48.132 --> 00:12:51.669
in many ways,
essay, in which Eliot

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:57.080
undertakes this work in a very
influential form.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.970
And I'd like to look at it with
you for a few minutes.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:05.812
It starts on page 950 at the
back of your book and goes to

00:13:05.812 --> 00:13:09.639
page 953.
This was a book review.

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:13.739
This was one of the great book
reviews in the history of

00:13:13.739 --> 00:13:15.230
English criticism.
 

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:21.030
Eliot was reviewing an
anthology of the metaphysical

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.634
poets.
That is, poets of wit,

00:13:24.634 --> 00:13:31.740
in particular of the--largely
of the seventeenth century,

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:40.347
including poets like Donne,
whose reputation Eliot did a

00:13:40.347 --> 00:13:46.919
great deal to establish in this
century.

00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:50.742
In the process of reviewing
this anthology,

00:13:50.742 --> 00:13:55.111
Eliot comes up with a whole
alternative theory or

00:13:55.111 --> 00:14:00.208
alternative history of English
literature and certain key

00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:03.940
poetic propositions and
statements.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.190
Let me just emphasize a few of
them for you.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:13.296
You'll see how the account of
literary history and Eliot's own

00:14:13.296 --> 00:14:16.980
ideas of poetics are all kind of
mixed up.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.190
And so you have to consider
them together.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:25.949
On page 951,
he has just quoted Donne,

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:30.929
and then he's quoted Tennyson.
 

00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:35.460
And the idea is that Donne is
good, Tennyson is bad.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.454
Now, he will continue and say:
The difference is not a

00:14:39.454 --> 00:14:41.299
simple difference of degree
between poets.

00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:45.964
It is something which had
happened to the mind of England

00:14:45.964 --> 00:14:51.294
between the time of Dunn or Lord
Herbert of Cherbury and the time

00:14:51.294 --> 00:14:55.797
of Tennyson and Browning;
it is the difference between

00:14:55.797 --> 00:14:59.450
the intellectual poet [that's a
good kind of poet]

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.909
and the reflective poet [bad].
 

00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:06.360
Tennyson and Browning are
poets, and they think;

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.746
but they do not feel their
thought as immediately as the

00:15:11.746 --> 00:15:16.009
odour of a rose.
A thought to Donne was an

00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:21.159
experience;
it modified his sensibility.

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:25.079
[Evidently, he felt his thought
as immediately,

00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:28.147
as sensually,
as the odor of a rose.]

00:15:28.147 --> 00:15:33.090
When a poet's mind is perfectly
equipped for its work,

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:38.570
it is constantly amalgamating
disparate experience;

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.901
the ordinary man's experience
is chaotic, irregular,

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:46.267
fragmentary.
[Maybe quite a bit like

00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:51.570
Prufrock's, you would think.]
The latter falls in love,

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.716
or reads Spinoza,
and these two experiences have

00:15:55.716 --> 00:15:59.720
nothing to do with each other,
or with the noise of the

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.490
typewriter or the smell of
cooking;

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.281
in the mind of the poet,
however, these experiences are

00:16:05.281 --> 00:16:07.950
constantly forming new
wholes.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.828
Well, you can see there a
little recipe for an Auden poem,

00:16:12.828 --> 00:16:17.107
excuse me – well,
maybe for an Auden poem too –

00:16:17.107 --> 00:16:18.990
for an Eliot poem.
 

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.230
It's a poem about falling in
love, reading Spinoza and

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.960
listening to the typewriter
while somebody cooks something.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.194
We may express the
differences by the following

00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:31.620
theory [And note that "we":
you know,

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.706
Eliot has this "we" that you
just have to bow before when he

00:16:36.706 --> 00:16:40.356
uses it, or join him,
I guess]: The poets of the

00:16:40.356 --> 00:16:42.983
seventeenth century,
the successors of the

00:16:42.983 --> 00:16:46.514
dramatists of the sixteenth,
possessed a mechanism of

00:16:46.514 --> 00:16:50.567
sensibility, which could devour
[and that's an interesting word]

00:16:50.567 --> 00:16:52.240
any kind of experience.
 

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.421
They are simple,
artificial, difficult,

00:16:54.421 --> 00:16:56.890
or fantastic,
as their predecessors were;

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.360
no less nor more than Dante….
 

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.703
In the seventeenth century
[however]

00:17:02.703 --> 00:17:08.531
a dissociation of sensibility
set in, from which we have never

00:17:08.531 --> 00:17:12.640
recovered [And this--what does
he mean?

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.190
He means thought and feeling
have somehow come apart];

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.018
and this dissociation,
as is natural,

00:17:19.018 --> 00:17:22.115
was aggravated by the influence
of the two most powerful poets

00:17:22.115 --> 00:17:24.349
of the century,
Milton and Dryden.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:30.645
And then he goes on to complain
about Milton and Dryden and then

00:17:30.645 --> 00:17:36.941
follow the Romantic inheritance
of Milton and Dryden in the next

00:17:36.941 --> 00:17:39.769
paragraph.
He says:

00:17:39.769 --> 00:17:43.884
The sentimental age began
early in the eighteenth century,

00:17:43.884 --> 00:17:46.347
and continued.
[Wouldn't you like,

00:17:46.347 --> 00:17:50.078
in your own essays,
to be able to give this kind of

00:17:50.078 --> 00:17:52.988
rapid-fire summary of literary
history?]

00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:56.720
The poets revolted against the
ratiocinative,

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.798
the descriptive;
they thought and felt by fits,

00:18:01.798 --> 00:18:04.950
unbalanced;
they reflected.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.257
In one or two passages of
Shelley's Triumph of

00:18:08.257 --> 00:18:11.634
Life, in the second
Hyperion [of Keats]

00:18:11.634 --> 00:18:15.149
there are traces of a struggle
toward unification of

00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:19.240
sensibility.
But Keats and Shelley died,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.780
and Tennyson and Browning
ruminated.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:28.369
It's amazing literary criticism.
 

00:18:28.369 --> 00:18:36.188
Well, here is quite an
extraordinary account of English

00:18:36.188 --> 00:18:38.940
literary history.
 

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.579
Eliot is proposing this.
 

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:43.626
It's quite a strange and
interesting claim,

00:18:43.626 --> 00:18:46.309
which for a long time,
I might add,

00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:52.834
really was persuasive and
became a kind of orthodoxy among

00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:56.039
readers of English poetry.
 

00:18:56.039 --> 00:19:00.779
And that is:
that the metaphysical poets,

00:19:00.779 --> 00:19:06.821
for centuries viewed as an
anomaly in the history of

00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:13.930
English poetry because of their
extreme intellectuality,

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:20.296
their poetry of wit,
that this anomaly in English

00:19:20.296 --> 00:19:27.591
literary tradition actually
represents central values in

00:19:27.591 --> 00:19:34.887
literature that were lost
through what Eliot views as an

00:19:34.887 --> 00:19:40.059
eccentric and aberrant
tradition,

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:44.788
which is, in fact,
that which descends from Milton

00:19:44.788 --> 00:19:49.420
and runs through the Romantics
and Victorians.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:54.596
Samuel Johnson in the
eighteenth century influentially

00:19:54.596 --> 00:20:00.554
complained of the metaphysical
poets that they "yoked the most

00:20:00.554 --> 00:20:06.610
heterogeneous ideas together by
violence" – this is Johnson's

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.148
phrase.
In other words,

00:20:09.148 --> 00:20:14.137
they were forced and willful
and they put things together in

00:20:14.137 --> 00:20:17.520
a kind of violent and artificial
way.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.369
Eliot is flipping that around.
 

00:20:20.369 --> 00:20:23.725
And he says,
only the metaphysical poets

00:20:23.725 --> 00:20:26.220
united thought and feeling.
 

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:35.798
And it's these other poets that
have been deficient and marginal

00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:41.880
to the main mission of English
poetry,

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.669
and that they are symptomatic
of some derangement in the mind

00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:51.380
of England that he calls a
"dissociation of sensibility,"

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.400
which somehow set in in the
seventeenth century or so.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.076
All of this,
this whole sort of account of

00:20:59.076 --> 00:21:02.210
how English history,
English literary history,

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.990
developed – all of this in
this essay suddenly,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:10.243
without any preparation,
turns into a defense of modern

00:21:10.243 --> 00:21:14.183
poetry,
or you might say a defense of

00:21:14.183 --> 00:21:17.388
Eliot's poetry.
He says, without,

00:21:17.388 --> 00:21:21.646
as I say, really any
preparation on the bottom of

00:21:21.646 --> 00:21:24.841
page 952:
It is not a permanent

00:21:24.841 --> 00:21:29.377
necessity that poets should be
interested in philosophy [as I

00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:32.779
was, or as I am],
or in any other subject.

00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:34.829
We [and there's that "we"
again]

00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:38.266
can only say that it appears
likely that poets in our

00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:41.674
civilization,
as it exists at present,

00:21:41.674 --> 00:21:44.150
must be difficult.
 

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:49.465
Our civilization [he continues]
comprehends great variety and

00:21:49.465 --> 00:21:53.539
complexity, and this variety and
complexity,

00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:59.643
playing upon a refined
sensibility [such as mine],

00:21:59.643 --> 00:22:05.000
must produce various and
complex results.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.901
The poet [and now he's telling
us what poets must do]

00:22:09.901 --> 00:22:13.859
must become more and more
comprehensive,

00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:16.966
more allusive,
more indirect,

00:22:16.966 --> 00:22:22.180
in order to force,
to dislocate if necessary,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:29.648
language into his meaning.
And then he will go on to quote

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:34.648
French poetry,
modern French poetry,

00:22:34.648 --> 00:22:38.638
to demonstrate,
as he feels it,

00:22:38.638 --> 00:22:44.220
the continuity between modern
verse and the metaphysicals.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:50.670
Well, here, Eliot is saying,
first of all,

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:58.380
that the character of modern
poetry--and again,

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.189
for which we must read,
his poetry--is simply a

00:23:02.189 --> 00:23:05.750
reflection of the forces playing
upon it,

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.940
the variety and complexity of
our civilization.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.543
In that formulation,
the poet seems almost passive,

00:23:12.543 --> 00:23:16.443
doesn't he?
Passive and like a kind of

00:23:16.443 --> 00:23:23.284
receptor that is naturally and
necessarily producing the kind

00:23:23.284 --> 00:23:27.730
of strange poetry that Eliot
writes.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.876
Then, before that idea has
really sunk in,

00:23:31.876 --> 00:23:37.539
Eliot gives us another view of
what the poet is doing.

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:41.964
The poet is not in fact
passive, but rather,

00:23:41.964 --> 00:23:46.593
he is forcing,
he is dislocating language into

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:49.998
his meaning.
And it's such an odd phrase,

00:23:49.998 --> 00:23:52.700
to "dislocate language" into
your meaning.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:24:00.373
It suggests that the poet is
not merely producing language,

00:24:00.373 --> 00:24:05.930
but moving it from one place to
another.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.245
The question that we might ask,
though, standing back,

00:24:10.245 --> 00:24:14.642
of the metaphysicals is a
question that we could ask of

00:24:14.642 --> 00:24:19.672
Eliot's poetry.
That is, does this poetry that

00:24:19.672 --> 00:24:26.869
Eliot's talking about put things
together or take them apart?

00:24:26.869 --> 00:24:31.792
Does it represent some kind of
synthesis, or rather,

00:24:31.792 --> 00:24:35.170
some kind of violent
derangement?

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:40.539
Is it a mirror of a various and
complex civilization?

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:43.890
Is it in that sense mimetic,
realist?

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.452
Or is it rather
expressionistic,

00:24:48.452 --> 00:24:57.136
willful, a kind of subjective
and highly personal expression

00:24:57.136 --> 00:25:02.730
in which the poet is
purposefully,

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:09.170
actively dislocating and
deforming language?

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:14.831
Is it in this sense a poetry
that is a kind of necessary and

00:25:14.831 --> 00:25:18.190
inevitable expression of the
age?

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:23.808
Or is it perverse and
eccentric: an arbitrary

00:25:23.808 --> 00:25:27.640
assertion of authorial will?
 

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.582
These are questions that
Eliot's own work,

00:25:32.582 --> 00:25:39.212
as I say, raises and that are
part of the history of his

00:25:39.212 --> 00:25:44.022
reception.
Eliot, in his account of the

00:25:44.022 --> 00:25:50.154
metaphysicals and then in his
defense of his own kind of

00:25:50.154 --> 00:25:53.146
poetry,
seems, I think,

00:25:53.146 --> 00:25:59.900
to equivocate to a degree
between these alternatives.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:06.286
Equivocation is,
again, the key rhetoric of

00:26:06.286 --> 00:26:12.519
"Prufrock" and of Eliot's early
poetry,

00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:18.112
of Prufrock's temporizing and
his delays and his going back

00:26:18.112 --> 00:26:22.261
and forth.
Let me say just a couple more

00:26:22.261 --> 00:26:28.245
things about "Prufrock" in the
light of what I've just been

00:26:28.245 --> 00:26:33.299
quoting for you from "The
Metaphysical Poets."

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:39.925
"Prufrock" has a kind of
ambiguous relation to the past,

00:26:39.925 --> 00:26:46.430
and specifically to the past of
English Romanticism.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:54.473
The poem is simultaneously a
deconstruction and critique of

00:26:54.473 --> 00:27:01.130
the Romantic ideals and values
of originality,

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:07.363
of expressiveness,
and it is also a highly

00:27:07.363 --> 00:27:15.269
original and expressive
reworking of those ideals.

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:21.094
It's a kind of anti-Romantic
poem that is an extension of

00:27:21.094 --> 00:27:25.910
Romanticism.
Unlike the conventional love

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:33.230
song, this one comes from the
head rather than the heart or,

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.808
you could say,
really from that opening

00:27:35.808 --> 00:27:38.590
quotation from Dante on,
it comes from,

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:43.180
comes out of many other texts.
 

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:48.432
I think that there's a kind of
suggestion or implication in the

00:27:48.432 --> 00:27:53.515
poem that what people claim is
original and primary is always

00:27:53.515 --> 00:27:56.480
in some sense already scripted.
 

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:01.469
That consciousness,
the way our minds work,

00:28:01.469 --> 00:28:06.695
is linguistic:
that we think and feel through

00:28:06.695 --> 00:28:09.830
language,
with language,

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:16.532
and through a kind of collage
network of verbal associations

00:28:16.532 --> 00:28:22.326
made out of texts and phrases
from not only literary

00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:26.820
tradition,
of course, but the whole

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.960
spectrum of everyday life.
 

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.666
Original speech,
heroic action,

00:28:33.666 --> 00:28:40.710
the will, unmediated desire:
these ideals are all rejected

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:44.170
in "Prufrock";
parodied;

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.789
subjected to irony,
discontinuity.

00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:52.710
They're seen as Romantic
illusions, clichés.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:57.789
The poem is not merely a parody
of them;

00:28:57.789 --> 00:29:02.740
or, maybe through parody it
does something else.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.142
It is, of course,
in its own way,

00:29:06.142 --> 00:29:11.990
quite as daring and disturbing
a poem, disturbing to the

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:17.519
universe of poetry at least,
as any modern poem.

00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:25.335
And I think you can see it as,
in effect, a new kind of love

00:29:25.335 --> 00:29:32.091
song, one in which the
withdrawing of desire from an

00:29:32.091 --> 00:29:39.907
object – our consciousness of
our own desires – subjects

00:29:39.907 --> 00:29:47.326
them to reflection but at the
same time sustains them and

00:29:47.326 --> 00:29:52.890
re-voices them through
reflection.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:57.999
You could say that what the
poem does is to intellectualize

00:29:57.999 --> 00:30:00.856
longing.
And, behind that,

00:30:00.856 --> 00:30:07.833
it makes of the modern skeptic
and intellectual a new kind of

00:30:07.833 --> 00:30:12.356
Romantic hero.
What does Prufrock want,

00:30:12.356 --> 00:30:15.835
ultimately?
What does he mean when he says,

00:30:15.835 --> 00:30:18.540
"No, that's not what I meant at
all?"

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.789
Well, it's hard to say exactly.
 

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:25.217
But the poem does conclude,
and as it does it gives us a

00:30:25.217 --> 00:30:27.309
kind of answer,
I think.

00:30:27.309 --> 00:30:29.000
Why don't we look at the end of
it?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.690
That's on page 466.
 

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.720
 
 

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.950
I grow old. . .
 

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:41.257
I grow old. . .
I shall wear the bottoms of my

00:30:41.257 --> 00:30:45.980
trousers rolled.
Shall I part my hair behind?

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.859
Do I dare to eat a peach?
 

00:30:49.859 --> 00:30:54.065
I shall wear white flannel
trousers, and walk upon the

00:30:54.065 --> 00:30:57.426
beach.
I have heard the mermaids

00:30:57.426 --> 00:31:02.327
singing, each to each.
You see, here,

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:08.160
Prufrock has moved into these
rhyming tercets.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.359
He says quite simply and
definitively:

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:16.519
I do not think that they
will sing to me.

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:20.259
I have seen them riding seaward
on the waves

00:31:20.259 --> 00:31:23.230
Combing the white hair of the
waves blown back

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.500
When the wind blows the water
white and black.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.116
And as he describes this,
there is kind of heightening of

00:31:32.116 --> 00:31:38.536
conventional lyric language with
that alliteration and with those

00:31:38.536 --> 00:31:41.598
images:
We have lingered in the

00:31:41.598 --> 00:31:45.279
chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:50.266
seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us,

00:31:50.266 --> 00:31:52.540
and we drown.
 

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.740
 
 

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.452
It's hard to interpret,
I think, the end of this poem

00:32:00.452 --> 00:32:04.392
precisely.
I think that Prufrock has

00:32:04.392 --> 00:32:08.957
really no clarified,
no specified desire,

00:32:08.957 --> 00:32:13.180
except maybe to hear the
mermaids.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:18.180
"I do not think that they will
sing to me": "I want them to,"

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.180
he seems to be saying.
 

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.703
In a sense, I think,
you could say he wants Romantic

00:32:24.703 --> 00:32:27.009
singing.
He wants to hear it.

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:31.316
Perhaps he wants to be able to
join in it himself,

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:35.710
which is a wish for lyric
inspiration, isn't it?

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:39.180
He doesn't want to make love to
these mermaids.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.349
He wants to hear them.
 

00:32:41.349 --> 00:32:45.540
He wants to linger with them,
to have access to their

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:50.134
element, and to that extent to
be among them and even like

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:53.141
them.
It is a wish for,

00:32:53.141 --> 00:32:58.376
specifically,
freedom from human voices,

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:06.139
which I take to be the endless,
overheard inner voices in which

00:33:06.139 --> 00:33:12.331
the quoted, repetitive speech
that makes up his consciousness

00:33:12.331 --> 00:33:15.064
consists.
In this sense,

00:33:15.064 --> 00:33:20.294
it's a wish for a renewal of
Romantic enchantment,

00:33:20.294 --> 00:33:26.685
which he knows is impossible,
and which he also knows,

00:33:26.685 --> 00:33:34.250
I think, is a wish as old as
Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale."

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.916
And this is a poem,
ultimately, very much in that

00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:39.520
Keatsian tradition.
 

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.650
 
 

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:49.140
The Waste Land:
let's begin at the end.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:54.650
Let's begin at the end,
on page 486.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:34:06.150
 
 

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:12.039
The Waste Land is a poem
that comes in five parts.

00:34:12.039 --> 00:34:18.882
The fifth section,
I think, it's the longest,

00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:24.480
is called "What the Thunder
Said."

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:32.352
It reaches a kind of climax
when the poem renders the voice

00:34:32.352 --> 00:34:37.252
of the thunder.
In the landscape of The

00:34:37.252 --> 00:34:41.440
Waste Land,
we are waiting for water.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:46.750
We're waiting for everything
that water would represent.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:53.570
And thunder promises that
water, and it also,

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:59.769
importantly,
represents a kind of speech:

00:34:59.769 --> 00:35:05.659
a speech that comes out of
nature,

00:35:05.659 --> 00:35:11.656
something that the thunder
says, has all kinds of

00:35:11.656 --> 00:35:14.780
mythological resonance.
 

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:24.594
You might even view it as the
voice of myth itself,

00:35:24.594 --> 00:35:35.980
here able to be given a voice
and a hearing in the poem.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.850
What the thunder says, is "Da."
 

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:47.849
Da: a primary syllable.
 

00:35:47.849 --> 00:35:57.113
There is a note explaining
this, coming to us from your

00:35:57.113 --> 00:36:01.230
editor and from Eliot.
 

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:07.633
It is the first phoneme that
becomes part of the instruction,

00:36:07.633 --> 00:36:12.329
the series of instructions
"Datta,"

00:36:12.329 --> 00:36:17.490
"Dayadhvam,"
"Damyata," translated as

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:21.000
"Give," "Sympathize," "Control."
 

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.870
When the thunder speaks,
this is what it has to say.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:28.020
It gives us these instructions.
 

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.699
 
 

00:36:31.699 --> 00:36:39.536
On page 486,
I'll just focus on one of these

00:36:39.536 --> 00:36:43.769
imperatives:
Da

00:36:43.769 --> 00:36:48.590
Dayadhvam:
I have heard the key

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.769
Turn in the door once and turn
once only

00:36:52.769 --> 00:36:56.969
We think of the key,
each in his prison

00:36:56.969 --> 00:37:01.750
Thinking of the key,
each confirms a prison

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:04.320
Only at nightfall,
aethereal rumours

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.000
Revive for a moment a broken
Coriolanus

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.424
Da
Damyata:

00:37:12.424 --> 00:37:16.130
The boat responded
Gaily, to the hand expert with

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.940
sail and oar
The sea was calm,

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.210
your heart [and there's this
interesting switch of

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:25.578
tense] would have responded
Gaily, when invited,

00:37:25.578 --> 00:37:28.119
beating obedient
To controlling hands

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:37.539
Well, "Dayadhvam" is
translated here as "sympathize."

00:37:37.539 --> 00:37:40.564
The poem is,
in many ways,

00:37:40.564 --> 00:37:45.645
concerned with sympathy as a
central value,

00:37:45.645 --> 00:37:52.846
a central action in human life,
and the lines that they

00:37:52.846 --> 00:38:00.842
introduce describe the condition
that sympathy would redress or

00:38:00.842 --> 00:38:06.260
enter into in some kind of
healing way.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.880
"I have heard the key / turn in
the door once and turn once

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.528
only."
Well, Eliot,

00:38:11.528 --> 00:38:17.176
when he produced this poem –
not the first version of this

00:38:17.176 --> 00:38:23.152
poem in The Criterion,
his own magazine where it first

00:38:23.152 --> 00:38:27.287
was published,
but rather when it appeared in

00:38:27.287 --> 00:38:31.140
the United States – added
footnotes,

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.860
or rather endnotes, to the poem.
 

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:41.269
And the endnotes we have here
are worth contemplating.

00:38:41.269 --> 00:38:45.562
In a sense, Eliot's notes are a
kind of extension of the poem,

00:38:45.562 --> 00:38:46.900
part of the poem.
 

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.519
These lines bear the note
"four":

00:38:51.519 --> 00:38:55.082
"And below I heard them
nailing shut the door / of the

00:38:55.082 --> 00:38:58.731
horrible tower."
[The speaker of those lines

00:38:58.731 --> 00:39:02.431
that Eliot is alluding to,
half-quoting,

00:39:02.431 --> 00:39:08.028
is Dante's Count Ugolino in the
thirty-third canto of The

00:39:08.028 --> 00:39:12.202
Inferno.]
The traitor Ugolino tells Dante

00:39:12.202 --> 00:39:17.989
that his enemies imprisoned him
and his children in a tower to

00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:22.343
die of starvation.
And of course,

00:39:22.343 --> 00:39:25.140
Ugolino would eat his children.
 

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.890
 
 

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:34.333
Eliot continues.
He gives us that little

00:39:34.333 --> 00:39:37.210
fragment from Dante,
and then he says:

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.773
"Also,
F.H.

00:39:38.773 --> 00:39:42.778
Bradley, Appearance and
Reality, p.

00:39:42.778 --> 00:39:45.947
346.
[When he writes like that,

00:39:45.947 --> 00:39:49.070
it's like wearing that
waistcoat.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:54.823
It's a kind of pose,
in this case the pose of a

00:39:54.823 --> 00:39:57.914
scholar-pedant.
Bradley says:]

00:39:57.914 --> 00:40:02.114
'My external sensations are no
less private to myself than are

00:40:02.114 --> 00:40:04.179
my thoughts or my feelings.
 

00:40:04.179 --> 00:40:08.892
In either case my experience
falls within my own circle,

00:40:08.892 --> 00:40:13.887
a circle closed on the outside;
and, with all its elements

00:40:13.887 --> 00:40:19.389
alike, every sphere is opaque to
the others which surround it....

00:40:19.389 --> 00:40:24.570
In brief, regarded as an
existence which appears in a

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:30.646
soul, the whole world for each
is peculiar and private to that

00:40:30.646 --> 00:40:39.001
soul.'"
Eliot worked on Bradley for his

00:40:39.001 --> 00:40:42.500
thesis.
"The whole world for each is

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.789
peculiar and private to that
soul."

00:40:44.789 --> 00:40:48.046
Well, I don't know that there
is any key to The Waste

00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:51.539
Land, but if there is a key
to The Waste Land,

00:40:51.539 --> 00:40:55.299
it's this key in these lines,
which lead us to Bradley and

00:40:55.299 --> 00:40:58.400
Bradley's view of what
consciousness is like.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:06.085
Consciousness is a condition in
which we are locked into our

00:41:06.085 --> 00:41:11.556
own, I think,
linguistic representations of

00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:18.329
reality without a common
language to share them.

00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:25.845
How can a common world be
created out of radically private

00:41:25.845 --> 00:41:29.297
experience?
Well, this is,

00:41:29.297 --> 00:41:36.497
I think, the central question
that The Waste Land is

00:41:36.497 --> 00:41:40.469
meditating on,
responding to.

00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:44.519
It's one of the central
questions in modern poetry.

00:41:44.519 --> 00:41:49.139
We won't get too far in the
poem today.

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:54.024
We'll have to conclude our
discussion on Monday,

00:41:54.024 --> 00:42:00.259
but let's look at the beginning
together simply to recall how

00:42:00.259 --> 00:42:06.909
this poetry operates and make
some preliminary observations.

00:42:06.909 --> 00:42:10.043
This section,
the first section,

00:42:10.043 --> 00:42:15.906
is called "The Burial of the
Dead" and refers to the ritual

00:42:15.906 --> 00:42:21.162
in the Anglican Church as
described in the Book of

00:42:21.162 --> 00:42:23.690
Common Prayer.
 

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.539
 
 

00:42:27.539 --> 00:42:32.460
April is the cruelest
month, breeding

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.580
Lilacs out of the dead land,
mixing

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:41.330
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:48.200
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.590
A little life with dried tubers.
 

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:56.070
Summer surprised us,
coming over the Starnbergersee

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.710
With a shower of rain;
we stopped in the colonnade,

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:03.159
And went on in sunlight,
into the Hofgarten,

00:43:03.159 --> 00:43:07.210
And drank coffee,
and talked for an hour.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:10.380
Bin gar keine Russin,
stamm' aus Litauen,

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.052
echt deutsch.
And when we were children,

00:43:13.052 --> 00:43:15.610
staying at the arch-duke's,
My cousin's,

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:20.430
he took me out on a sled,
And I was frightened.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:24.470
He said, Marie,
Marie, hold on tight.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:27.050
And down we went.
 

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:30.579
In the mountains,
there you feel free.

00:43:30.579 --> 00:43:34.704
I read, much of the night,
and go south in the

00:43:34.704 --> 00:43:38.780
winter.
It's extraordinary poetry.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:46.072
And one of the ways in which it
is extraordinary is the

00:43:46.072 --> 00:43:53.499
modulations, and where do we
pinpoint the turning points

00:43:53.499 --> 00:44:01.469
between the initial,
vatic, general voice of the

00:44:01.469 --> 00:44:11.280
poem and then that extremely
personalized first person,

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:17.079
who will be Marie,
named that way through that

00:44:17.079 --> 00:44:20.080
memory.
How do we get from "April is

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.302
the cruelest month" to "I read,
much of the night,

00:44:23.302 --> 00:44:25.340
and go south in the winter"?
 

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:34.182
Somehow there is a variety,
I think, a range of voices

00:44:34.182 --> 00:44:38.114
here.
And how Eliot moves from the

00:44:38.114 --> 00:44:43.050
one to the other is a question
for us as readers.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:46.401
I think it also raises,
again, this central problem

00:44:46.401 --> 00:44:48.679
that the poem is concerned with.
 

00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:51.321
And that is,
what is the relationship,

00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:55.318
how do we articulate the
relationship between the general

00:44:55.318 --> 00:44:59.841
and the particular,
between experience that is

00:44:59.841 --> 00:45:06.489
generalizable and that which is
almost irreducibly private?

00:45:06.489 --> 00:45:12.959
"April is the cruelest month":
those wonderful lines we all

00:45:12.959 --> 00:45:16.671
know.
Well, the poem begins with

00:45:16.671 --> 00:45:23.212
allusion, which it hardly even
needs to press to "Whan that

00:45:23.212 --> 00:45:25.881
Aprill,
with his shoures soote," the

00:45:25.881 --> 00:45:28.250
first line of The Canterbury
Tales.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:32.626
It evokes too,
probably, Whitman's "When

00:45:32.626 --> 00:45:39.360
Lilacs Last in the Dooryard
Bloomed," another April elegy.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:46.197
The poem begins by talking
about the pain of awakened

00:45:46.197 --> 00:45:54.351
desire, begins talking about the
risk that comes with beginning

00:45:54.351 --> 00:46:00.400
and desiring –
Prufrock's themes.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.230
Here they are, writ large.
 

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:08.056
Desire, it seems,
is painful because it breaks

00:46:08.056 --> 00:46:12.239
things open that are closed and
shut.

00:46:12.239 --> 00:46:18.059
It's also, it seems,
unsatisfiable.

00:46:18.059 --> 00:46:20.983
All of these are,
to a degree,

00:46:20.983 --> 00:46:24.411
conventional Romantic
topoi,

00:46:24.411 --> 00:46:27.489
motifs.
Where exactly does the poem

00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:29.750
modulate into personal memory?
 

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:36.701
Well, maybe somewhere in that
eighth line, "Summer surprised

00:46:36.701 --> 00:46:37.173
us.
.

00:46:37.173 --> 00:46:40.329
."
It started out looking and

00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:45.888
feeling a lot like "Winter kept
us warm," but now the memory

00:46:45.888 --> 00:46:49.656
will become highly
particularized through

00:46:49.656 --> 00:46:56.631
quotation,
incidentally as your note will

00:46:56.631 --> 00:47:00.994
explain.
The poem really moves into a

00:47:00.994 --> 00:47:05.131
kind of opaque set of personal
associations:

00:47:05.131 --> 00:47:10.326
"…when we were children,
staying at the arch-duke's,"

00:47:10.326 --> 00:47:14.070
and so on;
"…he took me out on a sled."

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:18.276
These associations are
meaningful and resonant and

00:47:18.276 --> 00:47:21.882
representative,
I think, to the extent that

00:47:21.882 --> 00:47:24.630
they have a generic quality.
 

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:29.797
That is, it's not so much that
they are our memories,

00:47:29.797 --> 00:47:32.579
but they're like memories.
 

00:47:32.579 --> 00:47:39.103
They're like personal memories,
and they're like personal

00:47:39.103 --> 00:47:46.210
memories in the difficulty of
translating and sharing them.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:54.203
Marie has a kind of exemplary
privacy about her and her

00:47:54.203 --> 00:48:02.789
memories and her sense of
frustrated desire and longing.

00:48:02.789 --> 00:48:08.975
There is more that's important
about this first of The Waste

00:48:08.975 --> 00:48:11.170
Land's speakers.
 

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:16.593
Well, "Bin gar keine Russin" is
translated for us down below as,

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:19.519
"I'm not a Russian woman at
all;

00:48:19.519 --> 00:48:23.230
I come from Lithuania,
a true German."

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:31.207
Whoever is saying that exactly,
whether it's Marie or someone

00:48:31.207 --> 00:48:38.920
else, seems to be speaking of a
kind of hybrid identity,

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:44.250
a kind of mongrel or
deracinated identity.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:54.103
The condition of locked-in
sensibility and difficult

00:48:54.103 --> 00:49:03.571
private emotion is,
from the very beginning of the

00:49:03.571 --> 00:49:07.989
poem,
associated with metropolitan

00:49:07.989 --> 00:49:12.870
culture, a culture where there
are many languages,

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:15.849
speakers from many places.
 

00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:21.166
And, well, a culture where
there are, as it were,

00:49:21.166 --> 00:49:26.149
a kind of cacophony of
languages untranslated,

00:49:26.149 --> 00:49:30.579
existing and competing
side-by-side.

00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:36.318
This is a kind of linguistic
environment that The Waste

00:49:36.318 --> 00:49:42.358
Land is made out of and is
also in many ways about and is

00:49:42.358 --> 00:49:46.990
the real medium of experience in
the poem.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.360
Well, let me stop here.
 

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:57.415
And we'll go on trying to make
sense of this great modern poem

00:49:57.415 --> 00:49:59.000
on Monday.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.540
Prof: Now before I get
going on today's lecture,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.160
which is about the evolution of
sex,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.870
I thought that I would just
share this picture with you,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.210
which I took at ten o'clock on
Saturday morning.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.954
These are the Hamden Golf
Course turkeys,

00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:16.590
and they sometimes show up in
my backyard, and they're

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.060
absolutely remarkable creatures.
 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.979
If you look at them,
probably the first thing that

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:23.290
strikes you is how do they make
those iridescent colors,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.827
and is there a different way
perhaps that they make the color

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:29.360
in their neck,
or perhaps on their face?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.630
Their neck is red and their
face is blue.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.150
Is that biomechanically
different?

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.440
In fact, these colors are a
diffraction gradient.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.152
There's no dye in them at all,
and the colors in the head,

00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:46.789
the blue color,
is actually made by kind of a

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.270
fractal matrix of bubbles.
 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.560
The red color I think is a dye.
 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.922
So there's some weird stuff
going on in the way that turkeys

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:55.720
make colors.
 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.560
Why the heck do these turkeys
look like this?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.170
Well the standard explanation
for that,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.683
which may or may not be
true--it hasn't been tested too

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:10.519
explicitly in turkeys,
although it has in pheasants

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.718
and in peacocks,
which are both related to

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:15.570
turkeys;
they're all in the family

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.141
gallinaceae--
is this is the product of

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.232
sexual selection,
and that what you're looking at

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:24.269
is what the female brain of the
turkey finds attractive.

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:27.120
Well there's a deep mystery in
that.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.647
Why should something that a
female turkey thinks is

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:34.879
beautiful also elicit the
sensation of beauty in my brain?

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:39.322
I last shared a common ancestor
with a female turkey about 150

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:40.780
million years ago.
 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.786
Has the perception of beauty
persisted unaltered in both

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:47.190
lineages for 150 million years?
 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.301
So you see the contemplation of
turkeys in the snow can take you

00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:52.150
a long way.
 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.876
Now today I want to talk about
the evolution of sex,

00:01:55.876 --> 00:02:00.481
which will eventually get us to
sexual selection in a bit over a

00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:01.140
week.
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.168
And in so doing the messages
that I want to get across are

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:11.110
that this is first a fundamental
question in biology,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.653
because it shapes almost
everything that we study in

00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:15.348
biology.
 

00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:19.098
Sex, in the sense that I'm
going to use it today,

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:22.649
in terms of organized diploid
sex, has been around probably

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.220
for about one and a half billion
years,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.568
and it's had many,
many consequences.

00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:34.824
There is a puzzle about sex,
and we will see that it is

00:02:34.824 --> 00:02:40.385
complicated and costly,
and therefore it needs an

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.240
explanation.
 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.068
I think it was the Marquis of
Chesterfield,

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.539
or someone like that,
who on advising his son on the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.604
con--
on the issue of sex said,

00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:56.988
"It doesn't last very long
and it's extremely

00:02:56.988 --> 00:02:58.300
expensive."
 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.330
&gt;
 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.623
And we will look at some of the
consequences of sexual

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:09.485
reproduction for large-scale
patterns in the plant and animal

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:10.538
kingdoms.
 

00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:14.995
Now I need to set this up by
distinguishing between

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:18.717
recombination,
reproduction and gender,

00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:23.870
because the word sex
often elicits in the minds of

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.470
non-biologists a composite of
all three things.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.390
Recombination is the process
that causes offspring to differ

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.710
genetically from their parents
and from each other.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.650
Now there are some exceptions
to this.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.043
For example,
armadillos always have

00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:49.772
identical quadruplets,
which makes them convenient for

00:03:49.772 --> 00:03:50.900
some things.
 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.669
Identical twins in humans,
of course,

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.705
are an exception,
where the recombination has

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.650
made them different from their
parents,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.949
but they're still identical to
each other,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.000
and that is because they derive
from an early mitotic event in

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.043
development;
so they were originally the

00:04:06.043 --> 00:04:06.688
same zygote.
 

00:04:06.688 --> 00:04:10.403
And then we have the
extravagance of polyembryonic

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:14.347
wasps where a parasitic wasp
lays a single egg into a

00:04:14.347 --> 00:04:18.581
caterpillar;
the egg starts to develop into

00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:21.555
a blastula;
the blastula fragments into

00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:25.411
hundreds or even thousands of
pieces, each one of which then

00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:27.699
develops into an embryonic wasp.
 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.230
Some of those sister wasps
differentiate into warrior

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.560
castes and go cruising around
the caterpillar,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.105
wiping out other wasps that may
have laid their eggs into the

00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:37.699
caterpillar.
 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.302
They don't make it,
they die, but they clear the

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:42.461
way for the others,
that then eat up the

00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:45.730
caterpillar and hatch as wasps,
out of the caterpillar.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.882
So there are always fascinating
biological exceptions to the

00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:53.896
idea that recombination makes
siblings different from each

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:54.600
other.
 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.370
In some cases they are not,
but normally they are.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.920
Reproduction is not the same as
recombination,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.468
and we can see comparatively,
through these contrasting

00:05:06.468 --> 00:05:09.463
examples,
why it is that recombination

00:05:09.463 --> 00:05:13.220
and reproduction are not always
necessarily coupled.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.973
In us they are,
but if we look at bacteria and

00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:20.142
clonal plants,
we can see that they can

00:05:20.142 --> 00:05:22.980
reproduce without recombining.
 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.142
And bacteria can actually
arrange to have sex and not

00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:31.040
divide at all.
 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.173
They can undergo a
recombination event and simply

00:05:34.173 --> 00:05:37.959
change themselves genetically,
and then wait for awhile and

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:39.069
divide later.
 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.624
And, of course,
in plants, clonal plants have

00:05:42.624 --> 00:05:47.389
the option, many of them have
the option of either producing

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.490
asexually or sexually.
 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.214
Often they produce sexually in
the parts of them that will then

00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:56.517
disperse to another place,
and asexually in the parts of

00:05:56.517 --> 00:06:00.550
them that will stay here;
here being more predictable

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.569
than there.
 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.718
Gender is something that is
really not at all the same as

00:06:06.718 --> 00:06:09.660
recombination or reproduction.
 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.759
Gender is maleness and
femaleness.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.139
So it's all of the secondary
sexual characteristics of the

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:16.970
two genders.
 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.646
And that is something that
originated with the production

00:06:22.646 --> 00:06:25.889
of gametes of different sizes.
 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.552
That didn't happen until after
meiosis originated in evolution,

00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:35.216
and it then created a situation
in which sexual selection could

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:37.509
occur;
where there was one kind of

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.589
selection on things that made
lots of small gametes--

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:43.916
sperm--and another kind of
selection that operated on

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:46.860
things that made a few large
gametes-- eggs.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.149
So those are three different
things.

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:55.035
I also need a few words,
and I'll refresh your memory or

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:59.637
introduce them to,
depending on where you're

00:06:59.637 --> 00:07:01.350
coming from.
 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.860
Isogamy means that we're
dealing with a species in which

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.350
all of the gametes are the same
size.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.002
That happens often in the
protists, in unicellular algae

00:07:11.002 --> 00:07:13.723
and protozoa,
that they produce gametes of

00:07:13.723 --> 00:07:14.920
the same size.
 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.161
Anisogamy comes where there are
gametes in two different sizes,

00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:23.060
the big ones being eggs and the
small ones being sperm.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.851
So anisogamy is the condition
with which most of you are

00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:26.410
familiar.
 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.949
Syngamy means fusion of gametes
to form a zygote;

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:35.449
that is one step in the process
of sexual reproduction.

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:39.720
Karyogamy is fusion of the two
gametic haploid nuclei.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.572
So the gametes come together,
and then after that happens

00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:44.949
their nuclei fuse.
 

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:49.180
And these things take time.
 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.928
We will see that those actually
are some of the--the time they

00:07:52.928 --> 00:07:55.019
take is some of the cost of sex.
 

00:07:55.019 --> 00:08:03.317
Now mating types occur at this
stage, with isogamous organisms,

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:07.199
and they reduce inbreeding.
 

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:12.490
Mating types are common in many
unicellular algae and in many

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.959
ciliates, like Paramecium.
 

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:19.776
They are basically a situation
where the organisms of one type

00:08:19.776 --> 00:08:23.490
can only mate with organisms of
another type.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.262
So if you are mating Type 1,
you can mate with mating Type 2

00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:30.610
but not with mating Type 1.
 

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.816
This, in some sense,
is genetically analogous to

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:39.470
having a large number of sexes
in the population,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.970
but with a rather interesting
pairing rule,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.820
that you can only not mate with
people like yourself.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.345
The population then
differentiates and evolution

00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:52.418
produces a huge number of mating
types.

00:08:52.418 --> 00:09:00.214
Now the traditional view on why
sex exists was formulated by

00:09:00.214 --> 00:09:06.820
August Weismann and then
elaborated by Mueller,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.865
and clarified by Crow and
Kimura, and it goes like this:

00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:16.634
recombination is there in
nature basically because it

00:09:16.634 --> 00:09:21.500
increases the rate of evolution,
and it does so in two ways.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.157
It increases the rate at which
two advantageous mutations can

00:09:25.157 --> 00:09:28.332
be brought together,
and it increases the rate at

00:09:28.332 --> 00:09:31.500
which disadvantageous mutations
can be discarded;

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.529
and I'll illustrate that with a
few diagrams in a minute.

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:40.394
A consequence of this is that
it decreases the probability of

00:09:40.394 --> 00:09:41.450
extinction.
 

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:49.850
All of that is true,
but it may not be why sex

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.529
exists.
 

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:57.288
So here is the traditional view.
 

00:09:57.288 --> 00:10:01.309
In a large population,
if we contrast a large asexual

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:04.788
population with a large sexual
population,

00:10:04.788 --> 00:10:07.832
you should think of the
vertical axis as being the

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:11.499
frequency of a mutation in the
population and the horizontal

00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:15.168
axis as being time,
and A, B and C are beneficial

00:10:15.168 --> 00:10:19.830
mutations that are arising at
different places in the genome.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.450
They're not alleles with a
single locus.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.442
They are three different genes
whose combination it would be

00:10:24.442 --> 00:10:27.277
really cool to have,
because it's going to improve

00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:31.434
reproductive success,
defend you against diseases and

00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:32.350
so forth.
 

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.626
In the asexual population,
first A pops up and it takes

00:10:36.626 --> 00:10:40.428
over the population because it's
advantageous.

00:10:40.428 --> 00:10:45.274
Then C, which had occurred once
before but not in combination

00:10:45.274 --> 00:10:50.360
with A, happens sequentially in
the same organism that's already

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.408
gotten A.
 

00:10:51.408 --> 00:10:55.139
So in the asexual population
the advantageous mutations have

00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:58.509
to happen one after another,
in a descendant lineage,

00:10:58.509 --> 00:11:01.269
because there's no sex to bring
them together.

00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:07.918
AC dies out because shortly
after it arose,

00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:12.590
AB came along and AB was
preferential to AC,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:16.990
and then eventually C arises in
an organism that already has A

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.980
and B,
and ABC takes over.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.340
That's a process of clonal
interference.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:26.769
In the sexual population these
mutations can be conceived of as

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:32.288
occurring at just about the same
time as they did in the asexual

00:11:32.288 --> 00:11:35.282
population,
but they are rapidly brought

00:11:35.282 --> 00:11:37.330
together by sex and
recombination,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.642
and the combination ABC spreads
through the population much

00:11:42.642 --> 00:11:46.649
earlier,
achieving fixation here rather

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:47.750
than here.
 

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.807
Now if we look in small
populations, the advantage of

00:11:52.807 --> 00:11:55.629
sex is not nearly as great.
 

00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:57.120
Can anybody tell me why?
 

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.841
You can see a picture there,
but can you interpret it in an

00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:03.389
English sentence?
 

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:09.190
Why is it that in the small
population the advantage of sex

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.990
is not so great?
 

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.813
It still can be advantageous,
but it's not as great as it is

00:12:15.813 --> 00:12:17.940
in the large population.
 

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:25.668
Student: You have less
animals.

00:12:25.668 --> 00:12:28.399
Prof: Population's
smaller, yes.

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:36.873
Student: You have less
animals

00:12:36.873 --> 00:12:44.639
for--&gt;.
 

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.269
Prof: Somebody want to
help Brett out?

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:49.450
He's looking for a word.
 

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.740
Yes?
 

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.515
Student: Small
population, less genetic

00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:52.990
variation.
 

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.123
Prof: There is less
genetic variation in the small

00:12:56.123 --> 00:12:56.738
population.
 

00:12:56.738 --> 00:12:56.961
Yes.
 

00:12:56.961 --> 00:12:57.408
Why?
 

00:12:57.408 --> 00:13:01.898
Student:  It's a lower
population count,

00:13:01.898 --> 00:13:04.629
&gt;.
 

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:07.409
Prof: Where does
variation come from?

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.190
Student:  Mutations.
 

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.048
Prof: Mutations. Yes.
 

00:13:14.048 --> 00:13:16.462
You can think of the population
size, all those genomes out

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.418
there, as being a net that
catches mutations.

00:13:18.418 --> 00:13:20.538
The smaller population is
catching fewer of them,

00:13:20.538 --> 00:13:22.575
and therefore there are fewer
things that it could bring

00:13:22.575 --> 00:13:24.916
together,
and therefore it takes a longer

00:13:24.916 --> 00:13:28.710
time in the small population for
sex to become advantageous,

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.639
because it has to wait for that
mutation to come along.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:34.547
In the large population,
it's there very quickly,

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:35.820
relatively quickly.
 

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:42.298
Okay, now about the costs of
sex.

00:13:42.298 --> 00:13:49.808
In an isogamous organism the
costs are genome dilution,

00:13:49.808 --> 00:13:52.190
the amount of time it takes to
have sex,

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.985
and the risk of predation,
of sexually transmitted

00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:59.860
diseases and of the difficulty
of finding mates.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.100
So let's step through those.
 

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:06.214
The cost of genome dilution
basically is that by engaging in

00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:11.416
sex you've made a decision that
your offspring will only have

00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:14.748
50% of your genes,
and it's going to have 50% of

00:14:14.748 --> 00:14:18.833
somebody else's genes;
whereas if you were asexual it

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:21.354
would be 100% your genes.
 

00:14:21.354 --> 00:14:22.058
Okay?
 

00:14:22.058 --> 00:14:25.259
So that's what we mean by the
cost of genome dilution.

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:28.778
And I think that you can see,
if you work through it,

00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:32.570
that this is indirectly also
the cost of having males.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.760
You don't really need to have
males at all,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.889
if you're asexual,
do you?

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:41.038
As a matter of fact,
we usually think of asexual

00:14:41.038 --> 00:14:45.128
species as consisting only of
females, and the reason for that

00:14:45.128 --> 00:14:46.668
is that they make eggs.
 

00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:47.340
Okay?
 

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.769
Now you can look at yeast,
which can reproduce either

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:55.735
sexually or asexually,
and experimentally measure this

00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:59.346
difference between one hour for
asexual reproduction and eight

00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:01.298
hours for sexual reproduction.
 

00:15:01.298 --> 00:15:05.710
So let's do a little mental
experiment here.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:11.196
We start off a vat of beer,
and we seed it with one asexual

00:15:11.196 --> 00:15:16.587
and one sexual yeast organism,
and they happily go to work

00:15:16.587 --> 00:15:19.710
starting to make beer for us.
 

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.153
After one hour,
we have two of the asexual,

00:15:23.153 --> 00:15:27.500
and we still just have one of
the sexual, don't we?

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.950
After two hours,
we have four of the asexual;

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.889
we still only have one sexual.
 

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:40.970
After three hours,
we have eight of the asexual;

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.620
we still only have one of the
sexual.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.678
You get the idea.
 

00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:50.293
That timing difference has an
enormous impact on the relative

00:15:50.293 --> 00:15:52.820
fitness of the two types.
 

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.565
Just because it can reproduce
faster, the asexual type is

00:15:57.565 --> 00:16:02.226
going to sweep through that
population and competitively

00:16:02.226 --> 00:16:07.340
exclude the sexual type;
all other things being equal.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.553
So we essentially end up with a
glass of beer that's produced

00:16:12.553 --> 00:16:15.509
almost 99.999% by asexual yeast.
 

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:19.828
The other cost,
of course, is that if you have

00:16:19.828 --> 00:16:25.779
to go find a mate and take time
to mate, you expose yourself to

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:28.658
being eaten by a predator.
 

00:16:28.658 --> 00:16:32.826
In the process of mating,
any kind of disease that mate

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:37.070
has could jump into your body or
into your offspring.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.029
It could be a selfish genetic
element that got into your

00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:42.990
offspring, coming in through the
genome of your mate.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:47.029
And it's pretty hard to find
mates at low population density,

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:49.460
which is why we find that
asexuality,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.748
for example,
increases in frequency as we go

00:16:51.748 --> 00:16:52.918
into the deep ocean.
 

00:16:52.918 --> 00:16:55.735
And if you look at the
organisms that are specialized

00:16:55.735 --> 00:16:58.009
on eating the carcasses of dead
whales,

00:16:58.009 --> 00:17:00.869
which drop onto the ocean floor
infrequently and at great

00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:04.201
distances from each other,
you discover that they have a

00:17:04.201 --> 00:17:07.268
higher rate of being asexual,
or being simultaneous

00:17:07.268 --> 00:17:09.664
hermaphrodites,
than do things that say live on

00:17:09.664 --> 00:17:12.598
tropical reefs near the surface
at high population density.

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:18.750
Then if you have anisogamy,
in its simplest form,

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.618
the cost of males is a twofold
cost.

00:17:23.618 --> 00:17:28.131
So if you're a female and you
have the option of being

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:33.578
asexual, and you're wondering,
"Should I be sexual?"

00:17:33.578 --> 00:17:35.194
and you ask yourself,
"What's it's going to cost

00:17:35.194 --> 00:17:37.229
me?",
basically if you count through

00:17:37.229 --> 00:17:39.509
to the number of grandchildren
you have,

00:17:39.509 --> 00:17:42.160
you'll have twice as many
grandchildren,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.065
if you don't make any males--if
you only make daughters you'll

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:51.528
get twice as many--
through your female line,

00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:56.104
bringing--
and this is because also the

00:17:56.104 --> 00:17:59.559
genome dilution effect is coming
in.

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:00.348
Okay?
 

00:18:00.348 --> 00:18:02.548
So anisogamy,
plus genome dilution,

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.750
gives you a twofold cost of
sex.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:10.220
This word Acarophenax is
going to come up several times,

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.640
because it's a spectacularly
perverse mite,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.740
and we all are interested in
spectacular perversion.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:24.349
So Acarophenax is a mite that
has an extreme example of local

00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:26.759
mate competition.
 

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:31.839
And has anybody already run
into this example?

00:18:31.839 --> 00:18:33.269
Can you tell me what it is?
 

00:18:33.269 --> 00:18:41.210
Mites, many mites,
not just Acarophenax,

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.330
lay their eggs into their
abdomen, where the eggs hatch

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.143
out inside the mother,
and the brothers then

00:18:49.143 --> 00:18:52.618
impregnate their sisters,
inside the mother,

00:18:52.618 --> 00:18:55.650
and the brothers die and the
sisters eat the mother.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.578
That's pretty spectacularly
perverse.

00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:03.990
The question is,
if you are the mother,

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.375
how many sons should you make
and how many daughters should

00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:09.304
you make,
in order to get the maximum

00:19:09.304 --> 00:19:11.468
number of grandchildren?
 

00:19:11.468 --> 00:19:12.098
Okay?
 

00:19:12.098 --> 00:19:15.948
And we will run through this
when we have the Sex Allocation

00:19:15.948 --> 00:19:19.144
lecture next week,
but I just wonder if any of you

00:19:19.144 --> 00:19:20.710
can anticipate that.
 

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.170
Here you are,
you're the mother mite.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.470
You want to maximize the number
of your grandchildren.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.893
You're not worried about
getting eaten,

00:19:26.893 --> 00:19:30.654
because your kind have always
had that, that's just a normal

00:19:30.654 --> 00:19:31.740
part of life.
 

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.250
The only issue that occupies
you is how many sons should you

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.210
make and how many daughters
should you make?

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.026
You're a little bit worried
about the lady next door and

00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:41.829
what she might be doing.
 

00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:43.029
Any idea?
 

00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:44.568
Student:  Only one son.
 

00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:49.409
Prof: You only make one
son, and that's because that one

00:19:49.409 --> 00:19:54.170
son can make enough sperm to
inseminate all of his sisters.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.891
And if you made two sons,
you would have some sperm that

00:19:57.891 --> 00:20:00.872
was going to waste,
and you could've used that egg

00:20:00.872 --> 00:20:03.210
to make another daughter that
got inseminated.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.192
That is, in fact,
the solution chosen by

00:20:06.192 --> 00:20:09.329
Acarophenax and all such similar
mites;

00:20:09.329 --> 00:20:11.490
one son, many daughters.
 

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:18.740
Now to go back to this slide,
just to remind you.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.776
I've been telling you lots of
interesting natural history,

00:20:21.776 --> 00:20:23.960
but the point of it that sex is
costly.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.578
It takes time,
it dilutes your genome,

00:20:26.578 --> 00:20:30.439
and if you are anisogamous it
costs you everything that's

00:20:30.439 --> 00:20:33.990
involved in making sons,
who otherwise might be

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:38.375
irrelevant if it weren't for
whatever advantage they might

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:39.990
bring in with sex.
 

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.223
So the paradox of sex is
basically that's it regular,

00:20:44.223 --> 00:20:46.259
complicated and costly.
 

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:51.324
And, as I indicated with the
example of the yeast in the

00:20:51.324 --> 00:20:55.192
brewer's vat,
asex should rapidly take over

00:20:55.192 --> 00:20:57.308
sexual populations.
 

00:20:57.308 --> 00:21:00.576
Nevertheless,
when we look at the Tree of

00:21:00.576 --> 00:21:03.114
Life,
we see that the majority of

00:21:03.114 --> 00:21:07.305
organisms are sexual,
and even the ones that we think

00:21:07.305 --> 00:21:10.490
of as being asexual,
like bacteria and viruses,

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.619
in fact have evolved something
like sex.

00:21:12.619 --> 00:21:14.940
So it seems to be a good thing.
 

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.028
We've got this traditional
explanation that sex speeds up

00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:24.299
evolution and reduces extinction
probability.

00:21:24.299 --> 00:21:26.298
But it has a problem.
 

00:21:26.298 --> 00:21:30.176
It is couched at the level of
the species or the group.

00:21:30.176 --> 00:21:30.680
Okay?
 

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.057
And it's not strong enough to
maintain sex against the

00:21:34.057 --> 00:21:35.970
invasion of asexual mutants.
 

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.351
The reason is that if you think
of it in terms of being good for

00:21:40.351 --> 00:21:44.315
the species because it causes
the species to last a longer

00:21:44.315 --> 00:21:48.307
time before it goes extinct,
well the generation times of

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:52.127
species are orders of magnitude
longer than the generation times

00:21:52.127 --> 00:21:53.220
of individuals.
 

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.588
Vertebrate species last usually
one to ten million years.

00:21:56.588 --> 00:21:59.970
Individuals last months to
years.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:04.022
So about 10^(6 )difference in
how fast things happen at the

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:06.470
individual and the species
level.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.660
So any individual
advantage--for example,

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.273
asex--could be multiplied
thousands or millions of times

00:22:13.273 --> 00:22:17.282
before the group or the species
advantage of not going extinct

00:22:17.282 --> 00:22:19.650
so frequently could take effect.
 

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.904
The individual advantage of
asex seems to be roughly twofold

00:22:23.904 --> 00:22:26.862
each generation,
and that adds up to a big

00:22:26.862 --> 00:22:29.818
difference over a lot of
generations.

00:22:29.818 --> 00:22:33.250
So asexual mutants should
always be taking over.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.598
But they don't.
 

00:22:34.598 --> 00:22:39.702
Now before I go into the
solution to that problem,

00:22:39.702 --> 00:22:45.327
I want to give you a little bit
of what we think is the

00:22:45.327 --> 00:22:49.910
evolutionary sequence in matters
sexual.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:54.111
In prokaryotes,
bacteria and archaea,

00:22:54.111 --> 00:23:00.061
probably the repair of
ultraviolet damage to DNA was

00:23:00.061 --> 00:23:02.278
very important.
 

00:23:02.278 --> 00:23:10.410
Then mitosis originated and
eukaryotic cell division.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:15.904
So once the eukaryote ancestor
formed, with the proper

00:23:15.904 --> 00:23:20.156
cytoplasm and nucleus,
and we had multiple

00:23:20.156 --> 00:23:23.890
chromosomes, mitosis originated.
 

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.558
We're back about probably 1.5
to 2 billion years here.

00:23:27.558 --> 00:23:30.541
Then meiosis,
which is really a very,

00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:35.015
very complicated symphonic
arrangement, originated by a

00:23:35.015 --> 00:23:38.660
duplication and modification of
mitosis.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:44.270
Then only after we had mitosis
did we get isogamous mating

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:49.390
types, and then we had the
evolution of anisogamy.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.630
Now the evolution of anisogamy
is actually a big deal because

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:57.941
it is what eventually led to the
differences between males and

00:23:57.941 --> 00:23:58.788
females.
 

00:23:58.788 --> 00:24:04.103
So sexual selection only starts
to happen after we have things

00:24:04.103 --> 00:24:07.500
that make gametes of different
sizes.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.710
So the ideas about why that
happened are kind of

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.125
interesting, because they're
right at the origin of

00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:15.970
male/female difference.
 

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.771
One of the ideas is that a
bigger egg would improve

00:24:20.771 --> 00:24:22.788
offspring survival.
 

00:24:22.788 --> 00:24:25.269
So some of the individuals in
the population,

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:28.153
in the isogamous population,
might be under selection to

00:24:28.153 --> 00:24:30.775
produce bigger eggs,
because they could then have

00:24:30.775 --> 00:24:32.190
babies that survive better.
 

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.990
They could also produce more
pheromones.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.914
So they could advertise,
so those eggs could advertise

00:24:37.914 --> 00:24:39.240
their presence better.
 

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.490
A bigger egg is a better
perfume factory.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.317
So you should think of eggs as
being big, fat perfume

00:24:47.317 --> 00:24:48.247
factories.
 

00:24:48.247 --> 00:24:48.990
Okay?
 

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:54.828
Once this--and this is now
frequency dependent selection--

00:24:54.828 --> 00:24:58.150
once some of the organisms
started to make bigger eggs,

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:02.269
the others, some of the others,
could decide,

00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:05.002
"Oh, I don't need to make
a big egg and invest a lot of

00:25:05.002 --> 00:25:07.690
energy in it because somebody
else is doing that for me;

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.930
instead I'll try to inseminate
lots of eggs."

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.337
And they got selected to make
sperm.

00:25:13.337 --> 00:25:13.818
Okay?
 

00:25:13.818 --> 00:25:18.026
So they made many small gametes
that could swim fast and were

00:25:18.026 --> 00:25:19.990
good at detecting perfume.
 

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.009
That's one idea.
 

00:25:22.009 --> 00:25:27.555
Another idea on anisogamy is
that those big eggs have got

00:25:27.555 --> 00:25:31.306
cytoplasmic organelles,
and those cytoplasmic

00:25:31.306 --> 00:25:34.608
organelles have got their own
independent genome in them,

00:25:34.608 --> 00:25:38.243
that they had when they came in
as mitochondria or as

00:25:38.243 --> 00:25:40.970
chloroplasts or as spindle
apparatus.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:45.233
And you don't want to generate
a situation in which you have

00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:49.371
competing cytoplasmic genomes,
because if you do,

00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:53.068
you get an uncontrollable
evolution,

00:25:53.068 --> 00:25:57.582
microevolutionary process going
on in the cytoplasm that can

00:25:57.582 --> 00:26:01.941
cause the takeover of the
cytoplasm by a basically selfish

00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:05.230
mitochondrion or a selfish
chloroplast.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.759
There are, in fact,
mitochondrial cancers.

00:26:08.759 --> 00:26:10.973
There are cases in which
mitochondria get out of hand and

00:26:10.973 --> 00:26:13.307
you end up with cells that are
just packed wall to wall with

00:26:13.307 --> 00:26:13.980
mitochondria.
 

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.778
You don't want that.
 

00:26:15.778 --> 00:26:19.355
You want to have the cell to be
a relatively well regulated,

00:26:19.355 --> 00:26:21.900
well biochemically balanced
environment.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:26.118
So one of the consequences of
biparental inheritance,

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:29.455
where you are only getting your
organelles from one of the

00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:32.278
parents,
normally the female,

00:26:32.278 --> 00:26:35.327
is that you avoid conflicts.
 

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:36.088
Okay?
 

00:26:36.088 --> 00:26:39.948
This may or may not have been
important at the origin of

00:26:39.948 --> 00:26:43.876
anisogamy, but it is certainly
one of the reasons for its

00:26:43.876 --> 00:26:45.000
maintenance.
 

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.519
And before I go into mutations
and parasites,

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:56.359
let's recall something that
August Weismann said back in

00:26:56.359 --> 00:27:00.410
1892: "Sex has a huge
number of consequences."

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.337
It's been around for a long
time, and so when we try to

00:27:04.337 --> 00:27:07.028
detect why sex originally
evolved,

00:27:07.028 --> 00:27:10.326
we're dealing with a situation
in which the original reasons

00:27:10.326 --> 00:27:13.733
are concealed by lots of layers
of adaptations that have built

00:27:13.733 --> 00:27:14.740
up since then.
 

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.421
So we have to clearly
distinguish between causes and

00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:20.009
consequences of sex.
 

00:27:20.009 --> 00:27:23.800
But this is now very hard to do
because the original causes are

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.470
now covered up with so many of
the secondary consequences.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:33.583
People have been repeatedly
fooled by confusing consequences

00:27:33.583 --> 00:27:34.930
for causes.
 

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.361
In a sense I suppose the bottom
line on that slide is we

00:27:38.361 --> 00:27:42.290
actually are in a position were
we can talk intelligently and we

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:46.160
can do science on the reasons
for the maintenance of sex,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.798
but we have difficulty--and may
always have difficulty--

00:27:50.798 --> 00:27:54.180
in identifying the real reasons
why sex originated,

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.338
because that happened a long
time ago,

00:27:56.338 --> 00:27:59.538
in a different situation,
and it's had all kinds of

00:27:59.538 --> 00:28:00.500
consequences.
 

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.920
Okay, so what kinds of forces
maintain recombination?

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.230
When Alex Kondrashov wrote a
paper about this about,

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.568
oh gosh, it's fifteen years ago
now,

00:28:12.568 --> 00:28:18.241
he came up with forty-three,
and I'm only going to list a

00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:18.848
few.
 

00:28:18.848 --> 00:28:22.952
I'm only going to list the ones
that I think remain plausible

00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:26.920
and can be demonstrated
experimentally or comparatively.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.777
However, I want you to be aware
that if you decide to write a

00:28:30.777 --> 00:28:33.344
paper on this,
and you want to know what are

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:36.190
all the reasons that people have
given for the origin and

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.932
maintenance of sex,
that the list is on the order

00:28:38.932 --> 00:28:40.558
of forty or fifty hypotheses.
 

00:28:40.558 --> 00:28:45.769
There are two important genetic
hypotheses.

00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:49.915
One is repair and the other is
mutations, and in a sense

00:28:49.915 --> 00:28:54.288
mutations really are an issue of
repair at the level of the

00:28:54.288 --> 00:28:55.420
population.
 

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.338
And there are ecological
hypotheses.

00:28:59.338 --> 00:29:03.452
Parasites and pathogens,
and the co-evolutionary problem

00:29:03.452 --> 00:29:06.652
that they pose,
are accepted by many now as a

00:29:06.652 --> 00:29:09.910
major reason why sex is
maintained in populations.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:13.430
And it is also true that
recombination spreads risks and

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.207
hedges bets in ways that go
beyond the issue of whether your

00:29:17.207 --> 00:29:20.278
children are going to be
infected by a particular

00:29:20.278 --> 00:29:21.240
pathogen.
 

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.608
You can deal with all sorts of
ecological situations.

00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:29.121
So you can think of the reasons
as falling into two general

00:29:29.121 --> 00:29:32.000
categories: genetic and
ecological.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.414
So back in prokaryotes,
a lot of repair mechanisms were

00:29:38.414 --> 00:29:42.930
evolved, and they are
sophisticated.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.808
They're still in operation;
they're readily studied in

00:29:46.808 --> 00:29:48.990
microbiology laboratories.
 

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.420
DNA polymerase itself does
proofreading.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.726
If a nucleotide has been
excised and is missing from the

00:29:55.726 --> 00:30:00.580
sequence, then you can use the
complementary strand to patch it

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.130
in.
 

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.530
So that happens,
and that needs a

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:07.210
double-stranded DNA,
not a single-stranded RNA.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.470
So if you're just dealing with
a single-stranded RNA virus,

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.461
it may very well have
difficulty doing this kind of

00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:16.326
repair,
and has a very,

00:30:16.326 --> 00:30:18.440
very high mutation rate.
 

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.402
I want you to remember whenever
I say mutation,

00:30:22.402 --> 00:30:26.710
that it is often a problem of
inadequate repair.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:32.209
So the repair mechanisms
actually control the mutation

00:30:32.209 --> 00:30:33.038
rates.
 

00:30:33.038 --> 00:30:37.396
In eukaryotes we have this kind
of proofreading,

00:30:37.396 --> 00:30:39.900
and we've got a lot more.
 

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.308
There are some repair
mechanisms that actually need

00:30:44.308 --> 00:30:45.279
diploidy.
 

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.460
So you have a whole extra
chromosome.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.500
You have two double-stranded
DNA molecules,

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.828
and you can go to the alternate
as a backup.

00:30:53.828 --> 00:30:58.298
So you can use that to repair
any mutational damage.

00:30:58.298 --> 00:31:02.220
But the most interesting kind
is recombinational repair;

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.753
well let's put it this way,
to somebody who thinks at the

00:31:04.753 --> 00:31:07.355
population level,
the most interesting kind is

00:31:07.355 --> 00:31:10.807
recombinational repair,
and that is because it isolates

00:31:10.807 --> 00:31:13.058
the defects on a subset of
gametes.

00:31:13.058 --> 00:31:15.410
You can have mutations in five
or six genes.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:18.430
Recombination could put them
all into one set of gametes,

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.288
and if those gametes die,
those mutations are gone.

00:31:21.288 --> 00:31:24.923
So recombinational repair
isolates and throws away,

00:31:24.923 --> 00:31:28.920
through natural selection,
the defects in the genome.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:38.663
There is a concept here that I
want you all to absorb and

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:42.809
understand,
and it has to do with the way

00:31:42.809 --> 00:31:46.290
that mutations will accumulate
in small populations that are

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:46.940
asexual.
 

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:52.301
And it's important because it
can be shown that this idea is

00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:57.114
at least theoretically true--
it can be demonstrated

00:31:57.114 --> 00:32:00.558
experimentally in small
populations--

00:32:00.558 --> 00:32:05.365
and it is a serious,
long-term problem for anything

00:32:05.365 --> 00:32:07.000
that's asexual.
 

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.548
Works like this.
 

00:32:09.548 --> 00:32:14.151
In a small population,
the class of organisms that has

00:32:14.151 --> 00:32:18.317
the fewest mutations is
eventually lost by drift.

00:32:18.317 --> 00:32:19.098
Okay?
 

00:32:19.098 --> 00:32:23.157
So you should think of this
starting off with a perfectly

00:32:23.157 --> 00:32:26.130
clean population of let's say
bacteria.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.712
It's a small one,
there are only ten or twenty of

00:32:28.712 --> 00:32:29.089
them.
 

00:32:29.089 --> 00:32:30.328
None of them have any mutations.
 

00:32:30.328 --> 00:32:34.861
Then the first mutation arises,
and eventually it drifts

00:32:34.861 --> 00:32:38.240
through the population and it is
fixed.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.460
That will eventually happen.
 

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.915
At that point all the organisms
in the small population have one

00:32:43.915 --> 00:32:44.519
mutation.
 

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:49.490
Because they all have one,
they can't get rid of it.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.808
The process happens again.
 

00:32:52.808 --> 00:32:58.029
Then they have two,
and so forth.

00:32:58.029 --> 00:33:01.903
So that leads to an inexorable
increase in the number of

00:33:01.903 --> 00:33:05.990
mutations in the class of
organisms that has the fewest.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.828
It goes--the fewest goes from
zero to one to two to three,

00:33:09.828 --> 00:33:10.838
and so forth.
 

00:33:10.838 --> 00:33:14.626
And the kinds of organisms that
are afflicted by this would be

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:17.670
mitochondria and chloroplast in
the germ line,

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:21.348
and ancient asexuals like
bdelloid rotifers.

00:33:21.348 --> 00:33:27.041
What's going on basically is
that this correlation between

00:33:27.041 --> 00:33:33.134
reproductive success and trait
or genetic state gets wiped out

00:33:33.134 --> 00:33:36.328
by the Law of Small Numbers.
 

00:33:36.328 --> 00:33:40.357
As you decrease the size of the
population, it becomes less-

00:33:40.357 --> 00:33:43.838
natural selection becomes less
and less powerful.

00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:47.460
You just get more noise,
simply due to sampling issues;

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.441
you just have a smaller number
of organisms,

00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:53.560
so the tightness of the
correlation goes away,

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.808
it gets noisy.
 

00:33:54.808 --> 00:33:57.453
So the smaller the population,
the more important random

00:33:57.453 --> 00:33:58.078
events are.
 

00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.358
When it's very small,
natural selection has very

00:34:00.358 --> 00:34:03.728
little opportunity to operate,
and the reason it loses its

00:34:03.728 --> 00:34:07.134
force is that the correlation of
trait variation with

00:34:07.134 --> 00:34:11.128
reproductive success is lost in
the noise of a small number of

00:34:11.128 --> 00:34:12.570
arbitrary events.
 

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:18.436
So that's what's going to go on
when say you start off an oocyte

00:34:18.436 --> 00:34:23.250
with two or three mitochondria;
that's a very small number of

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.409
mitochondria to go into an
oocyte,

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:29.585
and that's a genetic bottleneck
through which mitochondria will

00:34:29.585 --> 00:34:31.268
go in every generation.
 

00:34:31.268 --> 00:34:33.682
There might be 10,000 of them
in your liver cells,

00:34:33.682 --> 00:34:36.637
but if they're a small number
in oocytes, then they are going

00:34:36.637 --> 00:34:37.820
to experience drift.
 

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:45.947
So you can think of this as
stochasticity driving a wheel

00:34:45.947 --> 00:34:49.800
around,
and there is a lever here that

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:54.199
allows it to go forward but
won't allow it to go back.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:59.130
The capital letters are
beneficial genes,

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.460
and the small letters are
mutations,

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:07.420
and Muller's ratchet will take
this population and at first one

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.300
of these genes will get
replaced,

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.869
through drift,
by a deleterious mutation;

00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:15.159
then two;
then three;

00:35:15.159 --> 00:35:18.179
then four;
then five;

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:19.230
and so forth.
 

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:23.208
And if you plot here,
from few at the top to many on

00:35:23.208 --> 00:35:25.911
the bottom,
the number of deleterious

00:35:25.911 --> 00:35:29.650
mutations that are carried by
the least loaded genotype--

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.172
that is, the type in the
population that has the fewest

00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:34.806
deleterious mutations--
it's increasing,

00:35:34.806 --> 00:35:37.280
and fitness is going down.
 

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.967
This won't happen in a sexual
population, and it won't happen

00:35:41.967 --> 00:35:44.780
in an infinite asexual
population.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.188
The infinite asexual population
is big enough always to have

00:35:48.188 --> 00:35:51.137
some individuals in it that
don't have any mutation,

00:35:51.137 --> 00:35:53.159
and they will keep taking over.
 

00:35:53.159 --> 00:35:57.708
But in a finite asexual
population, Muller's ratchet

00:35:57.708 --> 00:35:58.690
operates.
 

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:02.938
So it's important in organelle
DNA, and this problem of

00:36:02.938 --> 00:36:06.793
Muller's ratchet in organelle
DNA could be solved,

00:36:06.793 --> 00:36:10.018
for example,
if mitochondria had sex.

00:36:10.018 --> 00:36:13.722
There has been a controversy
over whether mitochondria have

00:36:13.722 --> 00:36:16.681
sex,
and if you would like to read a

00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:21.139
paper that was written for this
course on that issue,

00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:23.760
it's up on the website--it's
called Example Paper--

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.929
and it reviews the status of
that issue about two years ago.

00:36:27.929 --> 00:36:33.704
In mammals, mutations in
organelle DNA may be solved with

00:36:33.704 --> 00:36:38.139
gamete selection through oocytic
atresia.

00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:42.222
One of the reasons why female
mammals may make 7,000,000

00:36:42.222 --> 00:36:43.978
oocytes,
when they're embryos,

00:36:43.978 --> 00:36:46.659
and then kill most of them
before they start menstruating,

00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:50.684
is that they are getting rid of
mutations that may have built up

00:36:50.684 --> 00:36:52.090
in the mitochondria.
 

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:57.246
What about the ancient
asexuals, those bdelloid

00:36:57.246 --> 00:36:58.480
rotifers?
 

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.530
Well they have really two
possibilities.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:08.920
One is that they could try and
arrange their physiology so that

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:14.050
they could make the effects of
any mutation more serious.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:16.532
And that has been suggested as
a hypothesis,

00:37:16.532 --> 00:37:20.081
and I find it implausible;
but it's a hypothesis which is

00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:20.789
out there.
 

00:37:20.789 --> 00:37:22.978
If you can make any mutation
really serious,

00:37:22.978 --> 00:37:25.168
so that it kills anything that
it occurs in,

00:37:25.168 --> 00:37:26.949
it has no chance to accumulate.
 

00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:31.126
It's only the deleterious but
not fatal mutations that can

00:37:31.126 --> 00:37:32.079
accumulate.
 

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:35.253
So that's a logical
possibility, but biologically I

00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:36.650
find it implausible.
 

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.663
Or they could always maintain a
very large population,

00:37:39.663 --> 00:37:41.539
so that drift is not a problem.
 

00:37:41.539 --> 00:37:46.152
And most of the things that are
ancient asexuals do have at

00:37:46.152 --> 00:37:49.574
least large populations;
not infinite but certainly

00:37:49.574 --> 00:37:49.940
large.
 

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.300
So here's a bdelloid rotifer,
and it's managed to escape

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.650
these problems.
 

00:37:55.650 --> 00:38:00.500
Nobody has ever seen a male
bdelloid rotifer.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:04.153
You could go outside OML and
take some moss off the side of

00:38:04.153 --> 00:38:06.989
the building and put it into a
cover slip,

00:38:06.989 --> 00:38:09.010
and some bdelloid rotifers
would swim out of it.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.190
They're all over the planet.
 

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:15.353
Even though it's avoided the
problems with mutations,

00:38:15.353 --> 00:38:21.016
we don't know how it's dealt
with pathogens and parasites.

00:38:21.016 --> 00:38:21.909
Okay?
 

00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:24.449
And that's this next issue.
 

00:38:24.449 --> 00:38:30.393
Parasites are the principle way
that the idea of co-evolution is

00:38:30.393 --> 00:38:35.110
realized in the context of the
evolution of sex.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:40.998
What happened to the Red Queen,
or what happened to Alice when

00:38:40.998 --> 00:38:46.695
she met the Red Queen in Lewis
Carroll's book Through the

00:38:46.695 --> 00:38:48.820
Looking Glass?
 

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.579
Did any of you run into that?
 

00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:54.559
Alice sits on a chess board and
she is--

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:57.902
this is kind of in a dream--and
she's trying to march down the

00:38:57.902 --> 00:39:01.411
eight squares of the chess board
so that she can be promoted to a

00:39:01.411 --> 00:39:01.960
queen.
 

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.445
She's a pawn in the chess game,
and she's trying and trying to

00:39:05.445 --> 00:39:07.820
get there,
and the Red Queen comes up to

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.347
here and says,
"Alice,

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:12.429
in this game you have to run as
fast as you possibly can,

00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:14.110
only to stay in place."
 

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.159
So it's called the Red Queen
Hypothesis,

00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:20.987
and the idea is that in
evolution organisms are evolving

00:39:20.987 --> 00:39:24.094
as fast as they can,
but they're in fact not

00:39:24.094 --> 00:39:27.436
increasing their fitness,
and they are not decreasing

00:39:27.436 --> 00:39:30.297
their long-term extinction
probability because the

00:39:30.297 --> 00:39:33.976
parasites and pathogens in their
environment are coevolving with

00:39:33.976 --> 00:39:36.018
them and keeping up with them.
 

00:39:36.018 --> 00:39:41.423
So it's called the Red Queen,
basically to communicate the

00:39:41.423 --> 00:39:46.639
idea that if you are in a
co-evolutionary arms race,

00:39:46.639 --> 00:39:51.820
then you may have to run as
fast as you possibly can,

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.570
just to stay in the same place.
 

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:59.248
So what it requires is genetic
variation for resistance in the

00:39:59.248 --> 00:40:01.811
host;
genetic variation for virulence

00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:02.860
in the pathogen.
 

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.487
We can see that in Daphnia and
its parasites,

00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:09.869
and in crop plants and their
pathogens.

00:40:09.869 --> 00:40:13.702
So the assumptions appear to be
fulfilled in some well studied

00:40:13.702 --> 00:40:16.594
systems, and you can see some of
the data here.

00:40:16.594 --> 00:40:17.159
Okay?
 

00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:20.889
So this is a case--this is a
complex table.

00:40:20.889 --> 00:40:24.590
I'd like you to be able to
interpret things like this.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:31.639
Basically what's gone on here
is that ten clones of Daphnia--

00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:37.164
or is it nine?--nine clones of
Daphnia have been isolated from

00:40:37.164 --> 00:40:39.692
a lake,
and out of each of those clones

00:40:39.692 --> 00:40:41.889
a strain of a parasite has been
isolated.

00:40:41.889 --> 00:40:46.820
This parasite is Pasteuria
ramosa, and it infects the body

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.760
cavity of Daphnia and castrates
it.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.539
Okay?
 

00:40:50.539 --> 00:40:52.449
Often parasites castrate their
hosts.

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:59.994
The numbers are the percentage
infected.

00:40:59.994 --> 00:41:01.349
Okay?
 

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:05.730
If you look at that you can
see, for example,

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:11.204
that this strain of Pasteuria
is really good at infecting the

00:41:11.204 --> 00:41:15.610
host that it came out of,
and really lousy at infecting

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:17.780
this other clone of Daphnia
here;

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.639
does pretty well in E and G;
and very, very poorly in B,

00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:23.710
C, F and H.
 

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.748
So one way to look at it is to
ask, "Where do the

00:41:26.748 --> 00:41:28.239
parasites do well?"
 

00:41:28.239 --> 00:41:30.679
And the answer is,
only in some of the clones.

00:41:30.679 --> 00:41:33.291
Now if you ask,
"How about the Daphnia,

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.268
how are they doing against the
parasites?"

00:41:36.268 --> 00:41:39.699
Well you can just go down a
column and you can see that this

00:41:39.699 --> 00:41:43.186
Type D here is actually pretty
resistant to almost everything

00:41:43.186 --> 00:41:46.804
out there,
and at the worst it gets hit by

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:51.320
this parasite that came out of
clone G, over here.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.951
So from these data you can
conclude that there is genetic

00:41:55.951 --> 00:42:00.748
variation for resistance and
there is genetic variation for

00:42:00.748 --> 00:42:03.929
virulence,
in a natural population.

00:42:03.929 --> 00:42:08.570
The parasites are selecting for
host resistance.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:11.804
The hosts are selecting for
parasite virulence,

00:42:11.804 --> 00:42:14.971
but the parasites have to keep
hopping around,

00:42:14.971 --> 00:42:16.730
onto different hosts.
 

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:20.188
The parasite selection is
happening on a time scale of

00:42:20.188 --> 00:42:23.250
days,
and prevalence of a particular

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:27.739
parasite decreases as resistant
host types increase in

00:42:27.739 --> 00:42:28.840
frequency.
 

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.936
So that's just what you need to
maintain sex.

00:42:31.936 --> 00:42:32.429
Okay?
 

00:42:32.429 --> 00:42:35.070
So that one looks pretty
plausible.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:39.641
There's another example from
nature that's pretty well

00:42:39.641 --> 00:42:42.422
studied,
and that's worms living in

00:42:42.422 --> 00:42:46.793
snails and ducks in a beautiful
lake on the South Island of New

00:42:46.793 --> 00:42:48.784
Zealand,
and the people who get to go

00:42:48.784 --> 00:42:51.239
study this stuff go to one of
the most beautiful parts of the

00:42:51.239 --> 00:42:53.023
world,
where they then put on wet

00:42:53.023 --> 00:42:55.190
suits and dive into freezing
cold water.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.518
&gt; Okay?
 

00:42:56.518 --> 00:42:59.719
The behavior of scientists is
difficult to explain.

00:42:59.719 --> 00:43:04.030
So this is the lifecycle of the
worm.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.400
The adult worms are in the duck.
 

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.360
They make eggs.
 

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.179
The snails pick up the eggs.
 

00:43:09.179 --> 00:43:11.489
The worms reproduce in the
snail's body.

00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:14.090
Then they are excreted as cysts.
 

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.931
The ducks eat the cysts,
and the life cycle goes around

00:43:16.931 --> 00:43:17.458
like this.
 

00:43:17.458 --> 00:43:17.880
Okay?
 

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.728
So anytime this loop can be
completed, the worms can stay

00:43:22.728 --> 00:43:26.280
adapted to the snails and to the
ducks.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.902
If this is broken at any point,
then the worms are no longer

00:43:31.902 --> 00:43:35.809
adapted to the snails,
or to the ducks.

00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:41.690
This is the kind of situation
in this lake in New Zealand.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:48.519
The ducks are in shallow water,
and the worms come out of the

00:43:48.519 --> 00:43:51.480
ducks and infect snails.
 

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.010
They only manage to close the
loop in shallow water,

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.940
because the ducks don't dive
very deep to eat the snails.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.467
The worms that are coming out
of the snails and going into

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:04.090
deep water are from a source,
and they're going into a sink,

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.389
and they become maladapted to
the snails;

00:44:06.389 --> 00:44:10.320
they can't keep up with the
evolution that's going on,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.635
in the snails down here,
because just about everybody

00:44:13.635 --> 00:44:16.440
that's getting into the snails
down here,

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.550
in fact, is adapted to the ones
in shallow water.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:24.490
So up here there's more snail
sex, and down here there's less

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:25.480
snail sex.
 

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.420
And that's a very short
distance.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.134
We're only talking about maybe
twenty or thirty meters apart,

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:31.219
for these populations.
 

00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:33.514
The only difference is the
depth of the water,

00:44:33.514 --> 00:44:35.760
and whether that loop is
connected or not.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.246
And where the loop is broken,
where the parasite cannot

00:44:39.246 --> 00:44:43.248
complete its sexual life cycle,
it loses the arms race with the

00:44:43.248 --> 00:44:43.960
snails.
 

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.469
The snails don't need sex.
 

00:44:45.469 --> 00:44:48.780
Asex takes over and spreads
through the population.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:58.570
So asex hardly ever has an
exactly twofold advantage.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:02.471
It's a bit more difficult
usually in animals,

00:45:02.471 --> 00:45:06.639
and sometimes it's easier in
plants than 2:1.

00:45:06.639 --> 00:45:12.949
There are cyclical
parthenogens--Daphnia,

00:45:12.949 --> 00:45:14.795
some aphids,
some beetles,

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:17.750
have a series of asexual
generations,

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.132
followed by one sexual
generation, and the analysis of

00:45:21.132 --> 00:45:24.835
these guys has led us to the
conclusion that you don't need

00:45:24.835 --> 00:45:26.940
very much sex,
but you do need a little.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.255
You can have sex about once
every ten to a hundred

00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:34.315
generations, and it is almost as
effective as having it every

00:45:34.315 --> 00:45:35.329
generation.
 

00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:41.780
And in mammals and birds,
there are no costs of sex,

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.518
because the asexual alternative
is impossible,

00:45:45.518 --> 00:45:49.387
and that is because early
development requires genes from

00:45:49.387 --> 00:45:52.909
each parent to activate in
complementary fashion.

00:45:52.909 --> 00:45:56.170
So when you were a very,
very small embryo,

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.824
consisting of a few cells,
you had to have some genes from

00:45:59.824 --> 00:46:02.733
your father turn on,
and then some genes from your

00:46:02.733 --> 00:46:03.981
mother,
and then some genes from your

00:46:03.981 --> 00:46:05.282
father,
and then some genes from your

00:46:05.282 --> 00:46:06.981
mother,
in sequential fashion,

00:46:06.981 --> 00:46:08.980
or development would not occur.
 

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:15.480
That pretty much means that
asexuality becomes impossible.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.164
Asexuality would only work if
that whole developmental

00:46:18.164 --> 00:46:20.952
sequence could be carried
through only by genes from the

00:46:20.952 --> 00:46:21.510
mother.
 

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.719
And apparently there has been a
process,

00:46:24.719 --> 00:46:27.306
an evolutionary arms race,
probably involving conflict

00:46:27.306 --> 00:46:29.485
resolution,
that has led to the kind of

00:46:29.485 --> 00:46:31.760
development that birds and
mammals have.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.460
There's an irony in this.
 

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.525
We now have so many advantages
of sex that we have a hard time

00:46:38.525 --> 00:46:39.429
explaining asex.
 

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:43.260
How did those bdelloid rotifers
survive?

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:48.492
We can easily understand why
asexuality would repeatedly

00:46:48.492 --> 00:46:50.679
originate and spread.
 

00:46:50.679 --> 00:46:53.250
It can spread like gangbusters.
 

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:57.400
It has low cost short-term;
big cost long-term.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.885
The long-term cost basically is
pathogens and parasites,

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:06.288
even if it can arrange a
solution to the mutations that

00:47:06.288 --> 00:47:08.164
drive Muller's ratchet.
 

00:47:08.164 --> 00:47:08.980
Okay?
 

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.039
So if you look at the Tree of
Life, what we see is that the

00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:16.750
asexual types are up on the
twigs and they have sexual

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.730
ancestors.
 

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:21.539
And most of the asexual types
are not too old;

00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:25.494
they're usually on the order of
somewhere between 50,000 years

00:47:25.494 --> 00:47:28.800
and 10,000,000 years,
and there are very few of them

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.679
that are older than that.
 

00:47:30.679 --> 00:47:33.418
It appears that these forces
catch up with them in the

00:47:33.418 --> 00:47:35.981
long-term,
and drive them to extinction

00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:39.492
more rapidly and more
pervasively than they can drive

00:47:39.492 --> 00:47:41.518
sexual types to extinction.
 

00:47:41.518 --> 00:47:47.782
So we have good individual
selection explanations for

00:47:47.782 --> 00:47:49.710
recombination.
 

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:52.880
You don't have to invoke group
selection or species selection.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.860
It has a lot of explanations.
 

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.804
The ones that seem to be pretty
general are repair -- mutations

00:47:58.804 --> 00:47:59.949
- and parasites.
 

00:47:59.949 --> 00:48:03.349
Those are certainly
experimentally substantiated.

00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:07.639
We do not understand how
ancient asexuals have survived;

00:48:07.639 --> 00:48:09.050
that's an open issue.
 

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:13.449
And sex has had some very
important macroevolutionary

00:48:13.449 --> 00:48:14.719
consequences.
 

00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:18.710
Probably the most striking is
the very existence of species.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:23.157
We would not have things in
nature that we called species if

00:48:23.157 --> 00:48:24.739
there were not sex.
 

00:48:24.739 --> 00:48:28.503
Instead we would have clones
that just kept fragmenting and

00:48:28.503 --> 00:48:31.750
kept filling in morphospace
fairly continuously.

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:36.161
What sex does is it integrates
populations and causes the

00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:41.065
co-adaptation of their genomes,
so that we get breaks

00:48:41.065 --> 00:48:45.730
separating the things that we
call species.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.639
They are things that hang
together.

00:48:47.639 --> 00:48:51.559
The other is this phylogenetic
distribution of asex.

00:48:51.559 --> 00:48:54.327
It's up on the twigs,
it's not down on the main stems

00:48:54.327 --> 00:48:55.500
of the Tree of Life.
 

00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:00.030
Next time we're going to
discuss genetic conflict.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:03.967
It's something that happens,
and it happens much more easily

00:49:03.967 --> 00:49:06.369
in sexual than in asexual
species.

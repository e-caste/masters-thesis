00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.331
Professor Ben Polak:
Last time we looked at how

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:07.664
to apply our new idea of
sub-game perfect equilibrium to

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:11.207
a whole bunch of games,
and our general idea for how to

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:14.530
solve the sub-game perfect
equilibrium is as follows.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.705
We looked at each sub-game.
We solved for the Nash

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:20.858
equilibrium in the sub-game,
that is something we learned to

00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:23.550
do long ago.
And then we rolled back the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.490
payoffs: we rolled them back up
the tree.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.230
And towards the end we learned
something interesting.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.039
I'm not going to go back to it
today--I just want to emphasize

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.556
it.
We learned that strategic

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:37.527
effects matter.
So in that investment game we

00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:40.178
looked at last time,
when you're considering whether

00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:42.050
to rent a new piece of
machinery,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.260
it made a very big difference
whether you considered how this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.910
action would affect the actions
of the other side;

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.530
in this case,
how it affects your

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.110
competition.
This is a very general idea,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.147
a very general point.
So just to give you a couple of

00:00:57.147 --> 00:00:59.118
more examples,
when you're designing tax

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:02.101
systems--I mentioned this last
time--when you're designing a

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.306
tax system,
to make some changes in the

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:05.806
U.S.
tax system, it's not good

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:09.014
enough to look at how people are
behaving in the old tax system

00:01:09.014 --> 00:01:11.859
and just calculate in an
accounting manner how much more

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.114
money you're going to raise,
or how much money it's going to

00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:17.041
cost you.
You have to take into account

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:19.510
how that's going to lead to
changes in behavior.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.596
Once again, that's a strategic
effect, and in the homework that

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:27.178
you're handing in today,
all of you will have had a nice

00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:29.769
example of that in the toll
booth problem.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:32.660
So in the toll booth problem,
when you're putting tolls on

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.748
roads--or more generally,
when you're building new roads,

00:01:35.748 --> 00:01:37.135
new bridges,
new flyovers,

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:39.463
new bypasses,
you need to take into account

00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:42.656
how those new tolls,
how those new roads will affect

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:46.052
all of traffic flow.
Traffic flow down the tree will

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:49.836
form a new equilibrium and you
need to consider that in

00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:53.690
designing your tolls and
designing your road system.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.080
So that's another example of
SPE.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.690
So today I want to do something
quite different,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.129
a little bit like what we did
with duel,

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:04.247
I want to play a game today,
and probably spend the whole of

00:02:04.247 --> 00:02:07.587
today analyzing this one game.
So it's quite a complicated

00:02:07.587 --> 00:02:13.382
game, but it's quite a fun game.
So what's the game we're going

00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:19.775
to look at?
The game is going to involve

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:29.501
two players, and each player in
each period, they choose--or

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:36.590
each chooses I should say--each
chooses,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.657
whether to fight or to quit.
So F means fight and Q means

00:02:42.657 --> 00:02:45.979
quit, and they make this choice
simultaneously.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:03:00.349
The game ends as soon as
someone quits.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.280
So there's good news and bad
news for this game.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:14.933
Let's do the good news first.
The good news is that if the

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:27.330
other player quits first you win
a prize.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.829
Generally we'll call this prize
V, but we'll play for some cash

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.471
in a minute.
The bad news is,

00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:48.709
each period in which both
fight--so each period in which

00:03:48.709 --> 00:04:01.466
both players choose to
fight--each player pays a cost,

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:09.896
so they pay -C.
Just to keep things interesting

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:16.663
let's fill in the other thing
here which is if both quit at

00:04:16.663 --> 00:04:23.779
once--so if both quit at once
then they get 0 that period.

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.569
So this is a game we've seen a
little bit before.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.360
We saw a little bit under the
auspices of Hawk Dove.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.620
Those people in the MBA class
saw a game a lot like this.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.676
But we're going to analyze this
in much more detail then we did

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.492
before.
As I said, we're going to spend

00:04:37.492 --> 00:04:39.129
the whole of today talking about
it.

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.590
So, to start this out,
let's actually play this game.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.411
So I want two volunteers.
Let me just,

00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:49.810
since this is college football
season, let me see if I can play

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.933
off the rivalries.
So do I have anybody here from

00:04:52.933 --> 00:04:56.384
the great state of Texas?
A whole bunch of Texans,

00:04:56.384 --> 00:05:00.020
keep your hands up.
I want to use you a second and

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.253
I guess the rivalry here is
Oklahoma.: Anybody from

00:05:03.253 --> 00:05:06.050
Oklahoma?
No Oklahomans?

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.379
What we'll do is we'll pick two
Texans then.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.350
We'll assume this is Texas and
Texas A&amp;M.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.740
So Texans raise their hands
again.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.847
All right, we're going to pick
out two Texans and I'm going to

00:05:18.847 --> 00:05:22.670
give you a mike each.
So your name is?

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.129
Student: Nick.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.392
Why don't you keep hold of
the mike and just point it

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:27.815
towards you when you speak,
but still shout because

00:05:27.815 --> 00:05:31.480
everyone here wants to hear you.
So this is Nick,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.089
where was my other Texan back
here?

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.180
Why don't I go for the closer
one.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.400
We'll start here.
And your name is?

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.764
Student: Alec.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:05:41.764 --> 00:05:43.089
Alec, so shout it out.
Student: Alec.

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:44.200
Professor Ben Polak:
That's better,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.860
okay.
So the game is this.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.030
They're going to have to write
down for the first period

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.760
whether they choose fight or
quit.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.813
Each player will have a referee.
So the person behind Alec is

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:59.141
going to be Alec's referee to
make sure that Alec is actually

00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:01.360
saying what he says he's going
to do.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.480
And what happened to my other
Texan.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.560
I've lost my other Texan.
There he is.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.279
Your name again was?
Student: Nick.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.347
Professor Ben Polak:
Nick is going to write down

00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:09.375
fight or quit.
And to make this real,

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:15.272
let's play for some real cash.
So we'll make the prize--why

00:06:15.272 --> 00:06:24.470
don't we make the prize equal to
a $1 and the cost equal to $.75.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.340
So I've got some dollars here.
Here we go.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.406
What do we call this?
In Texas we call this a fist

00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:30.820
full of dollars,
is that right?

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.403
So where are my players?
Why don't you stand up,

00:06:36.403 --> 00:06:39.550
you guys.
So everyone can see you.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.238
I made this difficult,
because now you are going to

00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:44.120
have to write down your
strategy.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.590
So you are going to have to
grab a pen.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.913
I didn't make that easy for you.
Let me come down to make it

00:06:48.913 --> 00:06:53.032
easier for the camera person.
So why don't you write down

00:06:53.032 --> 00:06:58.210
what your strategy is going to
be, and tell your neighbor what

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.370
it's going to be,
and we'll see what happened.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.430
Show your referee.
Have you shown your referee?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.790
Nick, speaking into the
microphone what did you do?

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.322
Student: I quit.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:07:12.322 --> 00:07:13.889
He quit.
Student: I quit as well.

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.075
Professor Ben Polak:
What happened to remember

00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:18.853
the Alamo?
All right, so Texas didn't work

00:07:18.853 --> 00:07:22.350
very well.
Let's try a different state.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.709
I have to say my wife's from
Texas and my wife's family is

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:29.069
from Texas, and I thought they
had more fight in them than

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:31.217
that.
Maybe that's why they are

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:34.892
sliding in the polls.
Let's try somebody from Ohio,

00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:38.699
anyone from Ohio?
Nobody from Ohio in the whole

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:42.364
class, that's no good.
I was going to pick Ohio

00:07:42.364 --> 00:07:45.274
against Michigan.
How about some people from some

00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:47.440
of our own teams?
Are there any players on the

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.920
football team other than the two
I've picked on before?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.410
There we go.
I need a different team,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:58.820
anybody from the hockey team?
Anybody from the baseball team?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.291
Okay good.
So our friend from the baseball

00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:05.379
team, your name is?
Student: Chris.

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:08.181
Professor Ben Polak:
Chris and our new football

00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.310
team player is?
Student: Ryland.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:11.980
Professor Ben Polak:
Ryland.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.980
Okay so Ryland and Chris are
going to play this.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.354
And neither of you is from
Texas, I take it,

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:21.170
so we have some hope of
something happening here.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:27.290
So write down what it is you're
going to choose.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.949
Have you both written something
down?

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:34.690
Yeah, all right Ryland what did
you choose?

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.119
Student: Fight.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:37.305
Chris?
Student: I'm going to

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:38.196
quit.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:08:38.196 --> 00:08:40.813
Well that was easy too.
So the football team is looking

00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:43.891
pretty good here.
So we're not getting much in

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:50.070
the way of action going here.
Anyone else want to try here?

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.993
Another little state rivalry
here, I don't suppose I've got

00:08:52.993 --> 00:08:55.110
anyone from Oregon,
that's asking too much,

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.019
anyone from Oregon?
You guys must be from somewhere.

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:01.379
There's got to be a state where
at least one of you is from.

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:05.470
Well let's try something like
New Jersey, how about that?

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.530
There's some players from New
Jersey that's good.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.660
Here we go.
And we'll try New Jersey and

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.575
New York.
That seems like there's a bit

00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:15.950
of a rivalry there.
Are you from New York?

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.940
Excellent, here we go,
and your name is?

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.870
Student: Geersen.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.730
Your name is?
Student: Andy.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.825
Professor Ben Polak:
Andy.

00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:25.050
Okay so Geersen and Andy.
So stand up so everyone can see

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.433
where you are.
Let's see if there's any fight

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:31.040
in New York and New Jersey.
So write down your strategies.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:43.057
Andy what did you choose?
Student: I'm going to

00:09:43.057 --> 00:09:44.179
fight.
Student: Fight.

00:09:44.179 --> 00:09:45.326
Professor Ben Polak:
Here we go,

00:09:45.326 --> 00:09:46.776
this is better now.
I was getting worried there for

00:09:46.776 --> 00:09:47.997
a second.
I know it's near the

00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:50.294
Thanksgiving break,
but there has to be some sort

00:09:50.294 --> 00:09:53.812
of spark left in the class.
So we have both people fighting

00:09:53.812 --> 00:09:57.909
which means right now they're
down $.75 but the prize is $1.

00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:00.629
So the game goes on,
so write down again.

00:10:00.629 --> 00:10:02.279
What you're going to do second
period.

00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:08.024
The $.75 is gone so now we're
just looking at this game for

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.908
$1.
Let's go to New York,

00:10:09.908 --> 00:10:11.693
what does New York?
Student: I'm going to

00:10:11.693 --> 00:10:13.179
fight.
Student: Fight.

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:14.691
Professor Ben Polak:
Fight okay.

00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:16.759
So you have to stay on the east
coast to get life.

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:17.600
There's no point going west is
there.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.104
That makes sense.
So write down again what you're

00:10:22.104 --> 00:10:26.606
going to do, and let's go the
other way around,

00:10:26.606 --> 00:10:29.057
to New Jersey?
Student: Fight.

00:10:29.057 --> 00:10:30.686
Student: Fight.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:10:30.686 --> 00:10:32.613
Fight again all right,
so right now we're down three

00:10:32.613 --> 00:10:35.718
$.75 whatever that is,
and there's still this prize of

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:38.450
$1, plus perhaps a bit of pride
here.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:44.521
So write down again.
Let's try again,

00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:46.190
so let's go with New York this
time.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.823
Student: I'm going to
fight.

00:10:46.823 --> 00:10:48.109
Student: Fight.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:49.787
Fight okay,
I'm guessing we could keep this

00:10:49.787 --> 00:10:51.320
going for quite a while,
is that right?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.932
Now it might make a difference,
by the way, if they're allowed

00:10:54.932 --> 00:10:58.129
to talk to each other here,
so let's see if it does.

00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:01.629
So let's allow New Jersey and
New York to talk to each other.

00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:03.989
You can't insult each other
about bridges and tunnels,

00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:06.811
just regular talk.
So anything you want to say to

00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:09.000
your friend from New Jersey
here?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.176
Student: I can't let New
Jersey win, that's just New York

00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:14.110
pride.
You guys are just worse in

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.809
every realm so I'm sorry.
It's just pride.

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:17.316
Professor Ben Polak:
Anything you want to say in

00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:18.732
reply?
Student: Well I'm going

00:11:18.732 --> 00:11:20.601
to keep fighting,
so your best choice is to give

00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:21.441
up.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:23.567
Let's see if that works.
Did they get anything out of

00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:28.740
that?
So choose the strategies again.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.852
New York?
Student: I just can't

00:11:31.852 --> 00:11:32.659
let Jersey win:
fight.

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:34.379
Student: Bring it on:
fight.

00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:35.995
Professor Ben Polak:
All right,

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.265
so it's clear that if we kept
this going for a while,

00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:40.230
it would pay for my lunch,
is that right?

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.635
We'll hold it here for a second.
We'll talk about it a bit,

00:11:45.635 --> 00:11:51.907
but thank you.
A round of applause for our two

00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:56.450
feistier players.
So what's going on here?

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.549
So clearly we can see what can
happen in this game.

00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:03.823
You can get people quitting
early, and it could be that one

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:07.139
side quits and the other side
doesn't quit.

00:12:07.139 --> 00:12:08.030
That is also something that can
happen.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.778
That can happen pretty quickly.
But it's possible--we just saw

00:12:11.778 --> 00:12:16.589
it happen--it's possible that a
fight could go on quite a while

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:19.150
here.
Now why?

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:24.200
What's going on here?
I mean the prize here was what?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.143
Was $1, and the cost was $.75.
I could have raised the stakes

00:12:29.143 --> 00:12:32.700
maybe on these guys and see if
that made a difference,

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.049
but I think $1 and $.75 will
do.

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:38.567
And by the time they had fought
the second time,

00:12:38.567 --> 00:12:41.860
they'd exhausted the possible
prize of $1.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.793
So it's true that if you won
this in the first period then

00:12:45.793 --> 00:12:50.002
that's fine because you just get
a $1 and it wouldn't cost you

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.195
anything.
And even if you won in the

00:12:52.195 --> 00:12:55.036
second period you'd be okay,
you'd only cost yourself $.75

00:12:55.036 --> 00:12:56.830
for fighting in the first
period,

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.679
but you're getting $1 so that's
good.

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:01.856
But there on--and "there on"
went on for plenty of time in

00:13:01.856 --> 00:13:04.698
this case--there on you're just
accumulating losses,

00:13:04.698 --> 00:13:07.258
so what's going on?
There are various conclusions

00:13:07.258 --> 00:13:09.768
possible here.
One is that people from New

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:14.070
York and New Jersey are crazy.
That's a possible thing.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.346
But what else is going on.
Why did we get involved in this

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:18.419
fight.
What happened here?

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:20.590
Why do we tend to see fights
like this emerging?

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.600
I'm claiming this isn't such an
implausible situation.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.313
Why do we see it emerging?
Let's talk to our friend from

00:13:26.313 --> 00:13:29.388
New York, shout out.
Student: By the time she

00:13:29.388 --> 00:13:33.154
fought with me on the second
round, I knew I was going to be

00:13:33.154 --> 00:13:36.919
losing money anyway so why not
just keep going and then,

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:38.832
there was no reason,
I wasn't going to win anyway,

00:13:38.832 --> 00:13:40.980
so I might as well just keep
fighting until she quit.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.876
Professor Ben Polak:
All right,

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:43.822
I think there's two things.
There's two parts to that

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.854
answer.
Part of the answer is:

00:13:46.854 --> 00:13:53.919
I have lost the money anyway,
let's hold that piece of it.

00:13:53.919 --> 00:13:55.889
And the other part of it is
what?

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:58.016
The other part of it is I'm
really determined to win this

00:13:58.016 --> 00:14:00.429
thing.
So there's two things going on

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:02.960
there, and they're quite
different.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.966
Let's take the second one first.
It's possible that the reason

00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:11.439
these fights emerge and can go
on for quite a while is that

00:14:11.439 --> 00:14:14.909
even though the prize is only $1
in money,

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:18.180
it could be that the actual
thing that the players care

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.214
about is what?
What do the players actually

00:14:20.214 --> 00:14:22.863
care about here?
Somebody just raise your hand,

00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:25.389
I'll put you on the mike.
What do people tend to care

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:27.949
about in these situations?
Winning, they care about

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:30.530
winning, or they care about
pride.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.478
Is that right?
That's why I started with

00:14:32.478 --> 00:14:34.528
Texas, but I couldn't find any
pride in Texas,

00:14:34.528 --> 00:14:38.732
so we had to go to New York.
So people care about winning

00:14:38.732 --> 00:14:40.549
per se.
It's a pride thing.

00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:44.907
So it could be that $1 simply
isn't a good description of the

00:14:44.907 --> 00:14:48.120
true payoffs here.
It could be that the payoffs

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.813
are actually about winning.
It could also be that both of

00:14:51.813 --> 00:14:55.813
these guys know that they're
going to be interacting with you

00:14:55.813 --> 00:14:59.480
at other times in the class,
or other times at Yale.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.665
And they want to establish a
reputation, both of them,

00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:04.950
as being the kind of guys who
fight.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.052
In particular,
when they got to talk about it,

00:15:08.052 --> 00:15:10.740
both of them said:
"look I'm a fighter":

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.531
something which we've seen
before with Ale and his pizza

00:15:14.531 --> 00:15:16.279
shop.
Both of them said:

00:15:16.279 --> 00:15:18.399
"I'm a fighter.
You better back out."

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.711
So both of them tried to signal
the fact that they were going to

00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:24.129
fight to try and get the other
side to quit.

00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:26.783
So that's about reputation,
and that reputation could

00:15:26.783 --> 00:15:29.729
extend beyond this game.
It could be that they're going

00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:32.860
to be involved in this kind of
conflict later on in life.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.029
So both of those things are
around.

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:38.084
There's another element to
this, and it's the other part of

00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:41.350
what our friend from New York
said which is about the costs.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:47.742
What's true about the costs in
this game as we move from period

00:15:47.742 --> 00:15:50.280
to period?
Somebody said it.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.660
Say it again.
Say it loudly.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.510
Student: Sunk cost.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.476
It's a sunk cost.
So all of those costs that you

00:15:57.476 --> 00:16:01.840
accumulate as the game goes on,
they're irrelevant looking

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.487
forward because they're sunk.
The fact I've played this game

00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:11.030
for ten periods and hence lost
ten times $.75--which even I can

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.294
do,
that's $7.50--the fact that

00:16:13.294 --> 00:16:17.280
I've lost $7.50 is irrelevant
because I've lost it anyway.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.470
I can't get that back.
That's a sunk cost.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:24.599
So the game ten periods through
looks exactly the same as the

00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:29.129
game did at the beginning,
when fighting seemed a good

00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:31.364
option.
So ten periods through the

00:16:31.364 --> 00:16:34.352
game, you have the same view
about fighting as you did at the

00:16:34.352 --> 00:16:36.513
beginning.
Now that's not quite true

00:16:36.513 --> 00:16:39.782
because at some point you're
going to run out of money,

00:16:39.782 --> 00:16:42.991
but if we ignore that,
basically, those sunk costs are

00:16:42.991 --> 00:16:45.844
irrelevant.
So what we're seeing here is

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:49.882
reasons why people fight and
some of these reasons seem to be

00:16:49.882 --> 00:16:53.179
for standard economic reasons
like sunk costs,

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:57.793
and some of them seem to be
about things that are outside

00:16:57.793 --> 00:17:01.500
the game like pride or possibly
reputation.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.859
It's certainly the case within
the real world,

00:17:03.859 --> 00:17:06.840
we do see fights like this.
Let's just spell out what the

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.594
key feature of this is.
The key feature of this is,

00:17:09.594 --> 00:17:12.854
in these fights over a period
of time, even though you may

00:17:12.854 --> 00:17:15.599
only be losing a little piece in
each period,

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.720
over a period of time you could
lose a lot.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.777
In fact, you could lose far
more than the prize that was

00:17:21.777 --> 00:17:24.716
originally at stake.
So the losses you could

00:17:24.716 --> 00:17:28.970
accumulate--and our friend from
New Jersey and New York,

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.068
the losses that they
accumulated vastly outweighed

00:17:32.068 --> 00:17:34.850
the prize that was at stake
after a while.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:40.533
That's a worry.
So this can occur in real life

00:17:40.533 --> 00:17:45.241
not just in the classroom.
What do we call these kinds of

00:17:45.241 --> 00:17:47.573
fights;
these fights where they're

00:17:47.573 --> 00:17:51.440
holding out for this possibly
small prize and incurring,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.117
possibly small--but they
accumulated to being

00:17:54.117 --> 00:18:00.940
large--costs each period.
What do we call those fights?

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.718
Let's think about some examples.
Let's see if the word comes out

00:18:03.718 --> 00:18:09.199
of examples.
So one example--let's do some

00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:16.219
examples here.
One example is what happened in

00:18:16.219 --> 00:18:20.462
World War I.
So in World War I,

00:18:20.462 --> 00:18:27.843
as I'm assuming most of you
know, on the western front at

00:18:27.843 --> 00:18:30.650
least,
the German and allies to

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.362
Germany armies faced off with
the British and French and

00:18:34.362 --> 00:18:37.390
allied armies,
for an extraordinarily long

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.942
time, fighting over
extraordinarily small patches of

00:18:40.942 --> 00:18:43.377
land,
little pieces of northern

00:18:43.377 --> 00:18:46.149
France and Belgium.
You could argue that these

00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:49.080
pieces of northern France and
Belgium--I don't wish to offend

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.718
anyone French or Belgian
here--but you could argue that

00:18:51.718 --> 00:18:54.600
those few acres of northern
France and Germany weren't worth

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.180
a whole lot anyway.
Nevertheless,

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.019
the two sides kept on fighting
from 1914 to 1918,

00:19:02.019 --> 00:19:08.369
and enormous losses of life
were accumulated in that period.

00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:12.000
So that was a really costly,
long term battle.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.052
Neither side would quit.
Each year huge numbers of lives

00:19:15.052 --> 00:19:17.304
were lost.
If you doubt that go and look

00:19:17.304 --> 00:19:20.582
at the war memorial in Yale that
shows how many Yale American

00:19:20.582 --> 00:19:23.008
lives were lost,
and America was only in that

00:19:23.008 --> 00:19:28.089
war for about a year.
Okay, so that's an example.

00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:30.773
Another example--a more
business example,

00:19:30.773 --> 00:19:34.665
an example we talked about in
our MBA class but not in this

00:19:34.665 --> 00:19:38.624
class so far--is examples in
business where there's a market

00:19:38.624 --> 00:19:42.650
and that market is really only
going to hold one firm.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.769
That market is only going to
hold one firm.

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:49.752
You can end up in an extremely
long fight about who's going to

00:19:49.752 --> 00:19:52.559
end up being the one firm in
that market.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:56.547
So a famous example--actually
it's a famous business school

00:19:56.547 --> 00:20:00.053
case--is the fight that ocurred
to control satellite

00:20:00.053 --> 00:20:03.643
broadcasting in Europe.
So there was a fight between

00:20:03.643 --> 00:20:07.357
Sky Television and the British
Satellite Broadcasting Company

00:20:07.357 --> 00:20:09.710
that went on for a number of
years.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.529
And these companies were doing
things like charging zero

00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:14.579
prices, and giving away
satellite dishes,

00:20:14.579 --> 00:20:17.782
and this that and the other.
And over the course of the

00:20:17.782 --> 00:20:21.208
fight they accumulated so many
losses that, if you did the

00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:23.668
accounting,
the entire future projected

00:20:23.668 --> 00:20:27.084
profit flow of winning this
fight was vastly outweighed by

00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:30.500
the amount of money that they'd
lost during the fight.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.695
That was a fight that involved
on one side Rupert Murdock and

00:20:33.695 --> 00:20:36.625
you can argue maybe Rupert
Murdock is a little crazy and

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:40.073
had a reputation to keep up,
but still it looks like another

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:44.121
example of this.
So that example was British

00:20:44.121 --> 00:20:48.130
Satellite Broadcasting versus
Sky.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.495
So with those two examples
there, anyone think of a general

00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:54.565
term we call these fights?
How do people refer to the

00:20:54.565 --> 00:20:58.067
method of fighting in World War
I--or for that matter during the

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:00.201
American Civil War?
Somebody in the back,

00:21:00.201 --> 00:21:01.336
shout it out.
Student: War of

00:21:01.336 --> 00:21:02.281
attrition.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:21:02.281 --> 00:21:12.240
It's a war of attrition.
So these are wars of attrition.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.259
These are wars of attrition.
And what we know about wars of

00:21:15.259 --> 00:21:18.513
attrition is that they can go on
a long time, and a lot can be

00:21:18.513 --> 00:21:20.076
lost.
A lot of life can be lost in

00:21:20.076 --> 00:21:22.812
the case of real wars.
A lot of money can be lost in

00:21:22.812 --> 00:21:25.785
the case of business wars.
Actually it turns out,

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:29.200
a lot of games have this
structure of a war of attrition.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.900
Let me give you one more
example.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:35.464
Suppose that two companies are
competing for a market not in

00:21:35.464 --> 00:21:40.029
the manner of BSB and Sky by the
advertising or whatever,

00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:42.650
but in the form of paying
bribes.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.672
So suppose there's a company
let's say in France and a

00:21:45.672 --> 00:21:49.761
company let's say in Britain,
and these two companies are

00:21:49.761 --> 00:21:55.262
trying to win a contract in some
country where paying bribes is a

00:21:55.262 --> 00:21:58.107
successful strategy.
And here I'm going to be

00:21:58.107 --> 00:22:00.240
careful about the film and not
mention any real companies,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.422
so let's call this imaginary
country Freedonia,

00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:04.319
which comes from a Marx
Brothers film.

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:06.821
So here's this French company
and this British company,

00:22:06.821 --> 00:22:09.231
and they both want this
contract to build a bridge in

00:22:09.231 --> 00:22:11.467
Freedonia.
And they start paying bribes to

00:22:11.467 --> 00:22:13.310
the general who controls
Freedonia.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.210
And what happens?
Well you're not going to get

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.086
the bribe back.
So both sides pay a few

00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:21.052
thousand dollars to this
general, and then the general

00:22:21.052 --> 00:22:23.849
comes back and says,
well you both paid $1,000.

00:22:23.849 --> 00:22:24.940
Which of you wants to pay the
bridge?

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.308
So they go on,
and they put more money in and

00:22:27.308 --> 00:22:29.323
more money in.
And you can see once again this

00:22:29.323 --> 00:22:31.925
is a war of attrition.
Those bribes that they've paid,

00:22:31.925 --> 00:22:34.854
they're never getting back,
but once you've paid them

00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:37.793
they're a sunk cost.
Once you've paid that bribe,

00:22:37.793 --> 00:22:40.200
good luck saying:
I paid you this bribe.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.750
You didn't let me build the
bridge.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.541
Give me my money back.
There isn't a court in the

00:22:44.541 --> 00:22:46.259
world that's going to enforce
that.

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:49.550
So these bribery contests look
a lot like this.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.583
There's a technical name for
these bribe contests,

00:22:57.583 --> 00:23:00.200
they're sometimes called all
pay auctions.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.130
So what do we want to establish
today?

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.531
We want to establish-- we want
to talk about why fighting

00:23:09.531 --> 00:23:12.690
occurs here and we wanted to do
so in some detail.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.277
So there may be informal
reasons why fighting occurs and

00:23:15.277 --> 00:23:18.195
we've talked about that.
It could be that one side is

00:23:18.195 --> 00:23:20.235
crazy.
It could be that both sides are

00:23:20.235 --> 00:23:22.319
crazy.
It could be that national or

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:25.601
regional pride is at stack.
All of these things could

00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:29.308
affect why we get fighting.
But what I want to try and

00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:33.676
establish today is that you can
get long fights emerging in

00:23:33.676 --> 00:23:38.269
potential wars of attrition even
if everybody is rational,

00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:42.275
even if the payoff is just that
one dollar, and even if there's

00:23:42.275 --> 00:23:45.785
no reputation at stake.
So again, my goal today is to

00:23:45.785 --> 00:23:49.511
try and convince you that you
can get huge loss of life in

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:53.367
World War I or huge loss of
money in these business contexts

00:23:53.367 --> 00:23:56.962
without having to argue
something outside the model like

00:23:56.962 --> 00:24:01.351
irrationality or reputation.
Even rational players can get

00:24:01.351 --> 00:24:04.539
themselves in trouble in wars of
attrition.

00:24:04.539 --> 00:24:08.470
So for the rest of today,
I want to try and analyze this.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:13.783
To get us started I want to
look at a version of this game,

00:24:13.783 --> 00:24:18.180
at a simplified version,
which only lasts for two

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.072
periods.
So we'll do a two period

00:24:21.072 --> 00:24:24.059
version of the game we played
just now.

00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:27.512
Eventually, by the end of
today, I want to look at the

00:24:27.512 --> 00:24:30.859
infinite version.
So we'll start small.

00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:32.780
We'll start with a two period
version.

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:41.269
The trick in analyzing these
things is to be able to come up

00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:43.740
with a tree and to be able to
come up with payoffs,

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.281
and be able to apply the
analysis that we know about to

00:24:47.281 --> 00:24:53.089
get us to where we want to be.
So here's the game I claim.

00:24:53.089 --> 00:24:55.720
I claim that it has the
following tree.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.932
So first of all Player A
chooses and Player A can either

00:25:01.932 --> 00:25:04.845
Fight or Quit.
And let me put a [1],

00:25:04.845 --> 00:25:07.109
and we'll see what the [1]
is in a second.

00:25:07.109 --> 00:25:09.670
Then we're going to model
Player 2.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.220
But of course this is a
simultaneous move game.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.850
This is a simultaneous move,
so this is an information set.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.869
Let's not call him Player 2.
Let's call him Player B.

00:25:16.869 --> 00:25:20.718
So Player B doesn't know what A
has done that first period when

00:25:20.718 --> 00:25:23.619
B is making her choice.
This is a simultaneous move.

00:25:23.619 --> 00:25:31.599
And B is choosing between
fighting or quitting.

00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:38.693
Just to distinguish them,
let me use small letters for B,

00:25:38.693 --> 00:25:44.900
so once again fight or quit,
and fight or quit.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:50.349
Now, if both sides fight then
the game continues.

00:25:50.349 --> 00:25:52.779
And everyone knows that both
sides fought at that stage.

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:55.794
So at this point on,
we're actually at a singleton

00:25:55.794 --> 00:25:58.870
information node and it's Player
A's turn again.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.638
So here we go again.
So in the second period,

00:26:09.638 --> 00:26:14.013
once again, we've got A
choosing whether to Fight or

00:26:14.013 --> 00:26:16.297
Quit.
And this time we'll put a [2]

00:26:16.297 --> 00:26:18.500
to indicate we're in the second
period.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.954
And after Player 2 has moved
once again--after Player A has

00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:25.950
moved--once again Player B is
moving.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:31.883
That's a simultaneous move.
And once again they're choosing

00:26:31.883 --> 00:26:35.310
fight or quit.
I'll put [2]

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.640
to indicate that we're in the
second stage.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.170
So that's the structure of this
two period game.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.797
And let's write down what the
payoffs are, starting with the

00:26:47.797 --> 00:26:50.711
easy payoffs.
So if both people quit in the

00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:55.095
first stage, they get nothing.
If A quits and B fights,

00:26:55.095 --> 00:26:58.289
then A gets nothing and B gets
V.

00:26:58.289 --> 00:27:04.414
If A fights and B quits,
then A gets V and B gets

00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:07.737
nothing.
And if they both fight we go

00:27:07.737 --> 00:27:11.017
into the second stage.
So let's write down the payoffs

00:27:11.017 --> 00:27:13.278
in the second stage.
So in the second stage,

00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:16.301
if they both quit in the second
stage then their payoffs are

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.731
going to be,
for A, -C, the costs they

00:27:19.731 --> 00:27:23.990
accumulated in the first stage,
plus 0.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:32.733
And, for B, -C + 0.
If A quits and B fights in the

00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:40.160
second stage then the payoffs
are -C + 0 and -C + V.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:48.420
If A fights and B quits then
the payoffs are -C + V and -C +

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.477
0.
And if they both fight for two

00:27:50.477 --> 00:27:53.423
periods, we have a decision to
make about how we're going to

00:27:53.423 --> 00:27:55.420
end the game in this two period
game,

00:27:55.420 --> 00:28:03.904
but let's just assume that what
we'll get here is -C -C and -C

00:28:03.904 --> 00:28:06.390
-C.
We'll assume if they both fight

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.682
the game ends and no one gets
the prize, just to make life

00:28:09.682 --> 00:28:11.769
simple.
So this is a two period version

00:28:11.769 --> 00:28:14.787
of the game and the only change
I've made, other than making it

00:28:14.787 --> 00:28:16.930
two periods, is I had to put in
a payoff.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.910
I had to see what happened if
the game didn't resolve.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.560
And I've assumed that if the
game didn't resolve,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.866
no one got the prize.
Now there's another assumption

00:28:25.866 --> 00:28:29.124
I'm going to have to make before
we analyze this,

00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:32.450
there are two possible cases to
consider here.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.942
There's the case when V &gt;
C which is the case we just

00:28:36.942 --> 00:28:41.557
played in the class;
and there's also the converse

00:28:41.557 --> 00:28:43.500
case when C &gt;
V.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:49.072
So today we'll focus on the
case V &gt; C which is the case

00:28:49.072 --> 00:28:52.858
we just played in class.
I'm going to leave you to

00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:55.331
analyze the other case,
the case when the cost is

00:28:55.331 --> 00:28:57.960
bigger than the prize,
as a homework assignment.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:05.940
So V &gt; C is our assumption.
So everyone okay with the tree?

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:10.651
This tree I hope describes the
game, at least a two period

00:29:10.651 --> 00:29:14.187
version of the game.
Now the first thing I want to

00:29:14.187 --> 00:29:17.030
point out here is,
if we look at the payoffs that

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.170
are incurred at the end of the
second period game,

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.690
we notice that they all contain
a –C.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:30.230
There's a -C everywhere.
What is that -C?

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.627
It's the cost that you
accumulated from having fought

00:29:33.627 --> 00:29:37.454
in the first stage.
But the observation I want to

00:29:37.454 --> 00:29:41.940
make straight away is that this
cost--so here it is,

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:46.828
here it is, here it is,
here it is, here it is,

00:29:46.828 --> 00:29:52.355
here it is, and here it is,
and here it is--this cost is

00:29:52.355 --> 00:29:56.969
sunk.
These objects here are sunk

00:29:56.969 --> 00:30:00.684
costs.
There's nothing you can do once

00:30:00.684 --> 00:30:05.994
you're in the second period of
the game to get these sunk costs

00:30:05.994 --> 00:30:07.700
back.
They're just gone.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.347
They're there,
but the fact that they enter

00:30:10.347 --> 00:30:14.130
everywhere is going to make them
strategically irrelevant.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:18.890
Okay, so what we want to do
here is we want to find all of

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:23.400
the sub-game perfect equilibria
of this little game.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.710
Let me get rid of the rules.
We all know the rules by now.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:51.098
So our goal here is to use our
solution concept,

00:30:51.098 --> 00:30:56.923
which is sub-game perfect
equilibrium, to try and analyze

00:30:56.923 --> 00:30:59.961
this game.
So how are we going to analyze

00:30:59.961 --> 00:31:02.650
this game in terms of sub-game
perfect equilibria?

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.049
How are we going to start that
discussion?

00:31:05.049 --> 00:31:07.920
We've got a lot of work to do
here, where are we going to

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.329
start in finding sub-game
perfect equilibria?

00:31:10.329 --> 00:31:12.410
What's the first thing we
should do?

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.254
Well, I claim the first thing
we should do is just figure out

00:31:15.254 --> 00:31:17.539
what the sub-games are.
Let's start with that.

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:21.040
So having just pushed it far
away I'm going to need to use

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.081
the pointer.
I claim that the obvious

00:31:24.081 --> 00:31:28.079
sub-game to analyze first is
this sub-game.

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:34.960
It's the sub-game if you should
end up in period [2].

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.216
And notice that it is a
sub-game: it starts from a

00:31:37.216 --> 00:31:39.512
singleton node;
it doesn't break up any

00:31:39.512 --> 00:31:42.738
information set;
and it contains all of the

00:31:42.738 --> 00:31:46.470
descendants of the node from
which it starts.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:51.098
So that is genuinely a sub-game.
So we're going to start our

00:31:51.098 --> 00:31:54.530
analysis by considering the
second sub-game.

00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:06.963
So let's write down the matrix
that corresponds to that second

00:32:06.963 --> 00:32:09.803
sub-game.
And I'm going to write it down

00:32:09.803 --> 00:32:16.001
in the following way.
So I claim, in this second

00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:27.710
sub-game, each player has two
choices, they can fight or quit.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.890
And I'm going to write the
payoffs in a particular way.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:37.210
I'm going to write the payoffs
as -C plus this thing.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.625
So rather than keep that -C in
all the boxes,

00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:42.041
which it's going to get boring
after a while,

00:32:42.041 --> 00:32:45.280
I'm going to pull that -C out
and just put it in front.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.352
Is that okay?
So we had this sunk cost box

00:32:48.352 --> 00:32:52.609
everywhere and I'm going to pull
out this sunk cost box and put

00:32:52.609 --> 00:32:54.740
it in front.
So here it is.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.442
If you get into the second
period of the game you've

00:32:59.442 --> 00:33:04.926
incurred this sunk cost.
And your payoffs in this game,

00:33:04.926 --> 00:33:10.789
if you both fight then you
incur -C for the second time.

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:16.570
If A fights and B quits,
then A is going to win the

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:22.930
prize so they'll get V and
Player B will get nothing.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.762
If B fights and A quits,
then conversely,

00:33:25.762 --> 00:33:28.950
A gets nothing and Player B
gets the prize.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:33.220
And if they both quit they just
get nothing.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:38.035
So just notice what I did here,
I could have written out the

00:33:38.035 --> 00:33:41.560
box with -C-C here;
-C-C here;

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.740
-C+V here;
-C+0 here;

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.112
-C+0 here, etc..
But I just pulled out that -C

00:33:48.112 --> 00:33:50.420
because it's just distracting
everything.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.430
So I pulled out that -C and put
it in the front.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:57.440
Okay, so now we can analyze
this little game,

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.910
and let's start off by talking
about pure strategy equilibria

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.950
in this game.
So again, our goal is to find

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.776
sub-game perfect equilibria,
so the way in which we find

00:34:08.776 --> 00:34:10.780
sub-game perfect equilibria is
what?

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:15.036
We start at the last sub-games,
we look for Nash equilibria in

00:34:15.036 --> 00:34:18.665
those last sub-games,
and then eventually we're going

00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:22.950
to roll those back.
So there's our last sub-game.

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:25.690
There's the matrix for it.
Let's just find the Nash

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:30.048
equilibria.
So if Player B is fighting then

00:34:30.048 --> 00:34:36.986
Player A's best response is to
quit and if Player A is fighting

00:34:36.986 --> 00:34:41.909
then Player B's best response is
to quit.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:46.065
Conversely, if Player B is
quitting, Player A's best

00:34:46.065 --> 00:34:50.057
response is to fight,
and if B is fighting--sorry:

00:34:50.057 --> 00:34:55.190
if A is quitting then Player
B's best response is to fight.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.650
I didn't say that right.
Let me try again.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:59.921
So if A is fighting,
if the other side is fighting

00:34:59.921 --> 00:35:02.688
you want to quit.
If the other side is quitting

00:35:02.688 --> 00:35:05.199
you want to fight.
Is that clear?

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:12.693
So there are actually
two--let's be careful here--pure

00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:19.338
strategy equilibria,
there are two pure strategy

00:35:19.338 --> 00:35:24.570
Nash equilibria in this
sub-game.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:34.295
What are they?
They are (Fight,quit) and

00:35:34.295 --> 00:35:40.027
(Quit, fight).
So if we get into the second

00:35:40.027 --> 00:35:42.549
sub-game and if we know we're
going to play a pure strategy in

00:35:42.549 --> 00:35:45.410
the second sub-game,
this is what's going to happen,

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.347
that's our claim.
Now notice that it didn't

00:35:48.347 --> 00:35:51.489
matter, the sunk cost didn't
matter there.

00:35:51.489 --> 00:35:54.117
I could have included the sunk
cost in the payoffs,

00:35:54.117 --> 00:35:57.271
but I would have found exactly
the same thing with or without

00:35:57.271 --> 00:35:59.619
the sunk costs.
So, as we'd expect,

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:03.904
the sunk cost is irrelevant.
So we've got both the

00:36:03.904 --> 00:36:09.848
equilibria in the sub-game.
Let's roll these back into the

00:36:09.848 --> 00:36:12.330
first stage of the game.

00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:24.628
The payoffs associated with
this one are V and 0,

00:36:24.628 --> 00:36:31.240
and the payoff associated with
this one is 0 and V.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.230
Everyone okay with that?

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:44.500
Okay, let's revisit the first
stage of this game.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.510
Now, things get a little bit
more complicated,

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:51.592
so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to redraw the first stage

00:36:51.592 --> 00:36:57.350
of this game.
So here it is.

00:37:02.369 --> 00:37:06.710
A can fight or quit just as
before.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:13.600
And, following this,
B can fight or quit just as

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.918
before.
So this is a picture of the

00:37:17.918 --> 00:37:23.803
first stage of the game,
but I'm going to chop off the

00:37:23.803 --> 00:37:27.739
second stage.
Let's put the payoffs in.

00:37:27.739 --> 00:37:33.176
So the payoffs down here are
the same as they were before:

00:37:33.176 --> 00:37:37.139
(0,0);
working up, (0, V);

00:37:37.139 --> 00:37:40.380
if A fights and B quits then
its V,0.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.510
But what about the payoff if
they both fight?

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.743
So what I want to do now is I
want to look at the payoff when

00:37:45.743 --> 00:37:48.599
they both fight by considering
what they would get,

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:51.516
if they both fight,
in the second period of the

00:37:51.516 --> 00:37:54.258
game.
So our idea is find the Nash

00:37:54.258 --> 00:37:59.428
equilibrium in the second period
of the game and roll back these

00:37:59.428 --> 00:38:08.884
possible payoffs.
So here the payoffs are going

00:38:08.884 --> 00:38:22.626
to be -C plus stage [2]
Nash equilibrium payoffs for

00:38:22.626 --> 00:38:30.627
Player A;
and -C plus the same thing,

00:38:30.627 --> 00:38:37.161
stage [2]
Nash equilibrium payoffs for

00:38:37.161 --> 00:38:41.153
Player B.
So just to understand what I've

00:38:41.153 --> 00:38:43.752
written here then,
I put the same payoffs as

00:38:43.752 --> 00:38:47.136
before but I've replaced that
enormous thing that was the

00:38:47.136 --> 00:38:50.530
second stage of the game,
just with the payoffs that we

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.909
know that we're going to get in
the second stage of the game,

00:38:53.909 --> 00:38:57.860
if we play Nash equilibrium in
the second stage.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:10.127
So these objects have a name,
and the name is continuation

00:39:10.127 --> 00:39:13.903
payoffs.
These objects are the

00:39:13.903 --> 00:39:16.204
continuation payoffs.
They are the payoffs I'm going

00:39:16.204 --> 00:39:18.802
to get tomorrow--and possibly
forward in a more complicated

00:39:18.802 --> 00:39:20.484
case--if,
in this case,

00:39:20.484 --> 00:39:23.829
if we both fight in the first
period.

00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:27.814
Now what we want to do is we
want to draw up the matrix that

00:39:27.814 --> 00:39:32.069
corresponds to this first stage
game, and we're going to have to

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:35.058
do so twice.
We're going to have to do so

00:39:35.058 --> 00:39:38.807
once for the case where the
continuation payoffs are (V,

00:39:38.807 --> 00:39:42.760
0), where the equilibrium we're
playing tomorrow is (Fight,

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.814
quit).
And we're going to have to do

00:39:45.814 --> 00:39:50.343
again for the case where the
continuation payoffs tomorrow

00:39:50.343 --> 00:39:54.236
are (0, V), namely the
continuation play is (Quit,

00:39:54.236 --> 00:39:57.000
fight).
So we have to do it twice.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.167
[So, you've got the
continuation payoffs down so

00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:07.664
let's delete this to give
ourselves a little room.]

00:40:07.664 --> 00:40:14.260
So the matrix is going to look
as follows: a nice big matrix,

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:18.600
2x2.
Player A is choosing Fight or

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.740
Quit, and Player B is choosing
fight or quit.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.589
That much is easy.
It's what we put in here that

00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:28.392
matters.
So let's do all the easy cases

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:32.204
first.
So (Quit, quit) is (0,0)'

00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:39.159
(Quit, fight) is (0,V);
(Fight, quit) is (V, 0);

00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:43.010
and in here it's going to
depend which of these two

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.938
games--which of these two
equilibria is being played

00:40:46.938 --> 00:40:52.403
tomorrow.
So what we're going to do here

00:40:52.403 --> 00:41:00.736
is we're going to do the case
for the equilibrium (Fight,

00:41:00.736 --> 00:41:06.630
quit) in stage two.
We're going to write out the

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:11.495
matrix for the case where we're
going to play (Fight,

00:41:11.495 --> 00:41:14.507
quit) tomorrow.
[-Thank you,

00:41:14.507 --> 00:41:20.701
try and keep me consistent
today, because it is very easy

00:41:20.701 --> 00:41:24.472
to slip up.
So once again I'm going to use

00:41:24.472 --> 00:41:28.844
capital letters for Player A and
small letters for Player B.

00:41:28.844 --> 00:41:30.844
]
So what happens if we both

00:41:30.844 --> 00:41:34.923
fight?
We both incur costs of C from

00:41:34.923 --> 00:41:41.336
fighting, and tomorrow we're
going to get the payoffs from

00:41:41.336 --> 00:41:45.050
the equilibrium (Fight,
quit).

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.867
That's this equilibrium,
so we're going to get V and 0

00:41:48.867 --> 00:41:51.309
tomorrow.
So let's add those in.

00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:59.510
So this will be +V and this
will be +0.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:04.176
And let's just put some chalk
around here to indicate that

00:42:04.176 --> 00:42:07.860
these are going to be
continuation payoffs.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.510
So this is the matrix we're
going to use to analyze the

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.701
first stage of the game in the
case where the equilibrium we're

00:42:15.701 --> 00:42:18.269
playing tomorrow is (Fight,
quit).

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:20.579
And as I promised,
we have to do this twice.

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:23.035
So the other case,
of course, is if we're in the

00:42:23.035 --> 00:42:26.550
other equilibrium tomorrow.
So let's just do that.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:32.480
So once again we have Fight
[1], Quit [1];

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:38.377
fight [1], quit [1];and the
payoffs are--same as we

00:42:38.377 --> 00:42:41.679
had--(0,V); (0,0);
(V, 0);

00:42:41.679 --> 00:42:46.733
and then here,
this time, we're going to have

00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:50.873
-C + 0 and -C + V.
And the reason for the change

00:42:50.873 --> 00:42:54.179
is that we're now looking at the
continuation game,

00:42:54.179 --> 00:43:01.352
the continuation play where
it's Player A who quits in the

00:43:01.352 --> 00:43:09.405
second stage.
So this is for the case (Quit

00:43:09.405 --> 00:43:16.429
[2], fight [2]) in period 2.
So let's just pause,

00:43:16.429 --> 00:43:18.880
let's make sure everyone's got
that down, everyone okay?

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.341
So what we've done here is we
started off by analyzing what's

00:43:22.341 --> 00:43:25.515
going to happen in period 2,
and that really wasn't very

00:43:25.515 --> 00:43:28.383
hard, is that right?
That was a pretty simple game

00:43:28.383 --> 00:43:30.840
to analyze, pretty easy to find
the equilibria.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:36.161
Then what we did was we rolled
back the equilibrium payoffs

00:43:36.161 --> 00:43:41.207
from period 2 and we plunked
them on top of the relevant

00:43:41.207 --> 00:43:44.727
payoffs in period 1.
So in particular,

00:43:44.727 --> 00:43:49.532
if you both fight and you know
you're going to play the (Fight,

00:43:49.532 --> 00:43:53.949
quit) equilibrium tomorrow,
then you're payoffs will be -C

00:43:53.949 --> 00:43:57.869
+ V and -C + 0.
If you both fight and you know

00:43:57.869 --> 00:44:02.450
you're going to play the (Quit,
fight) equilibrium tomorrow

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.320
then you're payoffs will be -C +
0 and -C + V.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.883
And just to emphasize once
again, these four boxes we

00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:18.409
created correspond to the stage
2 Nash equilibrium payoffs,

00:44:18.409 --> 00:44:20.909
so the continuation payoffs of
the game.

00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:26.539
Okay, so now we're ready to
analyze each of these games.

00:44:26.539 --> 00:44:29.460
So this isn't going to be too
hard.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.730
Let's try and find out the Nash
equilibrium of this game.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.610
So let's start with the left
hand one.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:38.335
This is the case where Player A
is going to fight and win in

00:44:38.335 --> 00:44:43.148
period 2.
So if Player B is going to quit

00:44:43.148 --> 00:44:47.930
in period 1 then,
if Player A fights,

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.096
she gets V;
if she quits,

00:44:51.096 --> 00:44:55.620
she gets 0: so she's going to
want to fight.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:00.180
Everyone okay with that?
If Player B fights in period 2

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.296
[error; 1]
then, if Player A fights,

00:45:03.296 --> 00:45:07.125
she gets -C + V and if she
quits she gets 0,

00:45:07.125 --> 00:45:12.199
and here's where our assumption
is going to help us.

00:45:12.199 --> 00:45:14.110
We've assumed,
what did we assume?

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.409
We assumed V is bigger than C,
just like we played in class.

00:45:17.409 --> 00:45:20.562
So because V is bigger than C
this is going to be the best

00:45:20.562 --> 00:45:23.880
response: again fighting is
going to be the best response.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.038
So we know that,
in fact, Player A here has a

00:45:28.038 --> 00:45:32.290
dominant strategy,
the dominant strategy is to

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:37.110
fight in period 1 in this
analysis of the game.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.154
And since A is fighting,
not surprisingly,

00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:43.570
we're going to find that B is
going to quit.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:51.703
So B's best response is to quit.
So here is our Nash equilibrium

00:45:51.703 --> 00:45:56.036
in this sub-game.
This game has a Nash

00:45:56.036 --> 00:46:03.190
equilibrium, it only has one,
and the equilibrium is (Fight

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.576
[1], quit [1]).
Now let's just talk about it

00:46:06.576 --> 00:46:08.898
intuitively for a second.
Intuitively,

00:46:08.898 --> 00:46:15.090
if I know, if I'm playing Jake,
and I know that Jake is going

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:19.672
to fight tomorrow--sorry,
other way round--I know that

00:46:19.672 --> 00:46:22.756
Jake's going to quit tomorrow
and I'm going to fight

00:46:22.756 --> 00:46:25.840
tomorrow--I know that tomorrow
I'm going to win.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.011
So that prize is there for me
tomorrow, so why would I want to

00:46:30.011 --> 00:46:33.860
quit today?
I'm going to get $1 tomorrow if

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.974
I just fight in this period.
So why would I want to quit

00:46:37.974 --> 00:46:40.812
today when, at worst case
scenario, I'm only going to lose

00:46:40.812 --> 00:46:43.297
$.75 today.
So if I know Jake is quitting

00:46:43.297 --> 00:46:46.070
tomorrow I'm going to stay on
and fight now.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.219
And conversely,
if Jake knows he's quitting

00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:50.420
tomorrow, hence,
he knows I'm going to fight

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.425
now, he may as well just quit.
So what we're learning here is

00:46:54.425 --> 00:46:58.578
in this particular example,
if we know that tomorrow I'm

00:46:58.578 --> 00:47:02.279
going to win the war,
I'm actually going to win it

00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:03.828
today.
Say it again,

00:47:03.828 --> 00:47:06.538
if we know that tomorrow I'm
going to win the war,

00:47:06.538 --> 00:47:08.639
I'm actually going to win it
today.

00:47:08.639 --> 00:47:13.187
The converse is true for the
case where I'm the quitter and

00:47:13.187 --> 00:47:17.516
Jake's the fighter tomorrow.
So once again it's pretty quick

00:47:17.516 --> 00:47:21.532
to see that from Jake's point of
view if I'm going to fight he's

00:47:21.532 --> 00:47:24.197
going to want to fight.
If I'm going to quit,

00:47:24.197 --> 00:47:26.634
he's going to want to fight.
So in either case he's going to

00:47:26.634 --> 00:47:29.090
want to fight.
So I'm going to want to quit.

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:37.996
So the Nash equilibrium in this
game is (Quit [1],

00:47:37.996 --> 00:47:40.360
fight [1]).

00:47:53.639 --> 00:47:57.615
So at this stage,
we found all of the pure

00:47:57.615 --> 00:48:02.559
strategy sub-game perfect
equilibria in the game.

00:48:02.559 --> 00:48:04.679
Let's describe them before I
write them up.

00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:09.706
One pure strategy Nash
equilibrium has me fighting in

00:48:09.706 --> 00:48:13.670
period 1 and Jake quitting in
period 1;

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:17.085
and if we got to period
2--which in fact we won't--then

00:48:17.085 --> 00:48:19.300
I fight again and he quits
again.

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:27.159
So let's write that equilibrium
up and we'll do it here.

00:48:27.159 --> 00:48:29.830
We'll do it on the top board
actually.

00:48:38.429 --> 00:48:41.762
So let me get it right,
when I write it up as a whole

00:48:41.762 --> 00:48:45.733
equilibrium.
So I claim that I've now found

00:48:45.733 --> 00:48:50.140
all of the pure strategy SPE in
this game.

00:48:56.269 --> 00:49:01.163
One of them involves my
fighting in the first period and

00:49:01.163 --> 00:49:08.326
fighting in the second period,
and Jake quitting in the first

00:49:08.326 --> 00:49:14.369
period and quitting in the
second period.

00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:19.690
The other one just flips it
around, I quit in the first

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:25.504
period, and if I got there I
would quit in the second period

00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:29.840
and Jake fights in the first
period and,

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.555
if he got there,
he would also fight in the

00:49:32.555 --> 00:49:36.526
second period.
So these are perfectly natural

00:49:36.526 --> 00:49:40.635
equilibria to think about.
If you want to get it

00:49:40.635 --> 00:49:44.473
intuitively, each of these
equilibria involves a fighter

00:49:44.473 --> 00:49:47.949
and a quitter.
The fighter always fights,

00:49:47.949 --> 00:49:52.092
the quitter always quits.
If I know that I'm playing a

00:49:52.092 --> 00:49:55.466
quitter, I'm always going to
fight, so that's a best

00:49:55.466 --> 00:49:58.129
response.
If I know I'm facing a fighter,

00:49:58.129 --> 00:50:01.447
I'm going to want to quit,
so that's a best response and

00:50:01.447 --> 00:50:03.860
those are two very simple
equilibria.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:07.460
That's the good news.
What's the bad news here?

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.710
The bad news is we haven't
achieved our goal.

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:15.089
Our goal was to argue that
rational players might get

00:50:15.089 --> 00:50:18.963
involved in a fight,
and notice that in each of

00:50:18.963 --> 00:50:23.679
these two pure strategy sub-game
perfect equilibria,

00:50:23.679 --> 00:50:26.920
in each of them,
no real fight occurs.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.929
Is that right?
In each of them one person

00:50:29.929 --> 00:50:32.715
fights for the first period,
but the other person just runs

00:50:32.715 --> 00:50:34.510
away.
That isn't much of a fight.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:38.604
Let me say it again.
In each of these equilibria,

00:50:38.604 --> 00:50:41.159
one side is willing to fight,
but the other side isn't,

00:50:41.159 --> 00:50:43.171
so no fight occurs.
In particular,

00:50:43.171 --> 00:50:46.849
no costs are incurred in either
of these equilibria.

00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:51.662
But I claimed at the beginning,
I wanted to explain how we

00:50:51.662 --> 00:50:55.039
could have costs occur in
equilibrium.

00:50:55.039 --> 00:50:57.430
Rational players are going to
incur costs.

00:50:57.430 --> 00:51:00.002
So what am I missing here?
What should I do to try and

00:51:00.002 --> 00:51:03.463
find a more costly equilibrium?
I claim I'm still missing some

00:51:03.463 --> 00:51:05.546
equilibria here.
What kind of equilibria am I

00:51:05.546 --> 00:51:08.224
missing?
I'm missing the mixed strategy

00:51:08.224 --> 00:51:12.159
equilibria.
So far, all we've done is solve

00:51:12.159 --> 00:51:17.752
out the pure-strategy equilibria
but we need to go back and

00:51:17.752 --> 00:51:23.056
re-analyze the whole game
looking now for mixed strategy

00:51:23.056 --> 00:51:24.600
equilibria.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.897
So we're going to do the
entire--take a deep breath,

00:51:32.897 --> 00:51:35.980
because we're going to take the
whole analysis we just did,

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:39.002
we're going to repeat the
entire analysis we just did,

00:51:39.002 --> 00:51:41.854
but this time we're going to
look at mixed strategy

00:51:41.854 --> 00:51:44.947
equilibria.
Everyone happy with what we're

00:51:44.947 --> 00:51:46.777
doing?
So first of all,

00:51:46.777 --> 00:51:50.619
we're going to go back to the
second sub-game.

00:51:50.619 --> 00:51:54.310
Here's the second sub-game,
and we already found the pure

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:58.756
strategy equilibria,
so let me get rid of them,

00:51:58.756 --> 00:52:05.670
and in your notes you probably
want to rewrite this matrix.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:08.261
But I'm not going to rewrite it
here because we're a little bit

00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:10.986
short of time.
This is exactly the same payoff

00:52:10.986 --> 00:52:14.237
matrix we saw before,
but now I want to look for a

00:52:14.237 --> 00:52:17.090
mixed strategy equilibrium in
this game.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.973
How do I go about finding--it's
good review this--how do I go

00:52:20.973 --> 00:52:25.179
about finding a mixed strategy
equilibrium in a game like this?

00:52:25.179 --> 00:52:30.820
What's the trick for finding
mixed strategy equilibria?

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:35.679
Should we try our guys from New
Jersey and New York?

00:52:35.679 --> 00:52:37.780
Let's try our guys from New
Jersey and New York.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.079
Where's my New Yorker?
We'll have the true battle here

00:52:41.079 --> 00:52:43.680
between New York and New Jersey,
how do we find a mixed strategy

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.625
equilibrium?
Student: You use the P's

00:52:46.625 --> 00:52:49.850
and Q's and set them equal to
one another.

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.679
That's a very crude explanation.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:52:51.679 --> 00:52:54.289
That's a crude thing okay.
So the answer was we find the

00:52:54.289 --> 00:52:57.380
P's and Q's and "set them equal
to one another."

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:01.530
What is it we're actually
setting equal to what?

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:03.050
Let's try and get some response
on this.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:06.070
Did our New Jersey guy flee?
Where's my New Jersey person?

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.242
They fled.
We could give our Texans

00:53:08.242 --> 00:53:09.809
another chance.
Where's our Texan?

00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:12.553
Tthere was a Texan down here
somewhere, what is it they set

00:53:12.553 --> 00:53:15.799
equal to what?
Student: I guess the

00:53:15.799 --> 00:53:20.869
chances that one would quit and
the other would fight.

00:53:20.869 --> 00:53:23.469
Professor Ben Polak:
 Not quite.

00:53:23.469 --> 00:53:26.570
The remark about using P's and
Q's was right.

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.190
This is good review for the
final.

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:30.450
What is it I'm going to do with
those P's and Q's?

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.056
Shout it out.
Student: You use the

00:53:33.056 --> 00:53:34.756
other player's payoffs.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:34.756 --> 00:53:36.280
Use the other player's
payoffs and?

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.478
Student: Make them
indifferent between their

00:53:38.478 --> 00:53:39.739
strategies.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:42.570
Good.
I'm going to choose Player B's

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:47.292
mix in such a way as to make
Player A indifferent between

00:53:47.292 --> 00:53:52.260
choosing fight and quit.
So as to make it plausible that

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.993
A is actually mixing.
So again the intuition is for A

00:53:55.993 --> 00:53:59.169
to be mixing they must be
indifferent between fight and

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:02.583
quit.
So I'm going to choose the mix

00:54:02.583 --> 00:54:06.370
of B to make A indifferent.
So that's good review.

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:09.281
Let's do that.
So here I've usually used the

00:54:09.281 --> 00:54:13.630
letter Q but to avoid confusion
here, let me use the letter P.

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:19.539
We're going to choose P to make
Player A indifferent.

00:54:19.539 --> 00:54:30.460
So if A fights then their
payoff is what?

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:36.197
Let's have a look.
It's -C with probability P,

00:54:36.197 --> 00:54:42.820
and V with probability of 1 -
P.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.298
This should be coming back now.
This is before the mid-term,

00:54:51.298 --> 00:54:54.214
but you guys were alive before
the mid-term so you should

00:54:54.214 --> 00:54:57.428
remember this.
So if they fight,

00:54:57.428 --> 00:55:06.136
they get -C P + V [1--P].
If they quit then they get 0

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:15.143
with probability P,
and 0 again with probability 1

00:55:15.143 --> 00:55:19.308
- P.
So we know that if A is mixing,

00:55:19.308 --> 00:55:24.694
B must be mixing in such a way
as to make these two numbers

00:55:24.694 --> 00:55:28.329
equal.
So we know these two must be

00:55:28.329 --> 00:55:32.353
equal to one another.
Since they're equal we can now

00:55:32.353 --> 00:55:35.150
solve for P, so what's that
going to give us?

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:43.862
It's going to give us V [1--P]
= P .

00:55:43.862 --> 00:55:53.820
C and that I think is P = V /
[V + C].

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.780
Is that right?
Someone just check my algebra.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.029
If you remember the game of
Hawk Dove that we saw just

00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:03.768
before the mid-term--it was a
game we looked at when we looked

00:56:03.768 --> 00:56:06.894
at evolution--this is
essentially the same game more

00:56:06.894 --> 00:56:09.571
or less as that game,
and that you'll notice it's the

00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:10.789
same kind of mixture we've got
here.

00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:19.647
So P = V / [V + C]
which means 1 - P = C / [V +

00:56:19.647 --> 00:56:21.713
C].
I'm leaving it up there for a

00:56:21.713 --> 00:56:23.805
bit hoping that one of the
T.A.'s is just going to do my

00:56:23.805 --> 00:56:25.639
algebra for me.
I think that's right though.

00:56:25.639 --> 00:56:30.338
So this game is symmetric so we
could do the same for B but

00:56:30.338 --> 00:56:34.469
we'll find the same thing:
it's a symmetric game.

00:56:34.469 --> 00:56:42.981
So the mixed strategy
equilibrium, the mixed Nash

00:56:42.981 --> 00:56:52.379
equilibrium in this game has
both mix, both fight with

00:56:52.379 --> 00:56:58.940
probability equal to V / [V +
C].

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.258
Now this is good news,
because at least we are getting

00:57:01.258 --> 00:57:03.619
some fighting going on,
but we need to do something.

00:57:03.619 --> 00:57:06.496
We need to take this Nash
equilibrium we've just found,

00:57:06.496 --> 00:57:09.320
which is a Nash equilibrium in
the second sub-game.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:16.550
It's a Nash equilibrium in the
sub-game way up here.

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:20.154
And we need to roll back the
payoffs from this sub-game,

00:57:20.154 --> 00:57:23.824
the equilibrium payoffs from
this sub-game into the first

00:57:23.824 --> 00:57:25.850
stage.
That's our method.

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:28.697
How are we going to do that?
Well we better first of all

00:57:28.697 --> 00:57:30.510
figure out what those payoffs
are.

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:36.360
So what are the payoffs in this
equilibrium?

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:45.239
The payoffs in this mixed Nash
equilibrium are what?

00:57:45.239 --> 00:57:48.983
Anyone see what the payoffs are
going to be if they're both

00:57:48.983 --> 00:57:52.255
playing this mix?
Well presumably the payoff from

00:57:52.255 --> 00:57:55.358
fight and the payoff from quit
must be the same,

00:57:55.358 --> 00:57:57.824
is that right?
So we may as well choose the

00:57:57.824 --> 00:58:01.661
easier one.
So I claim that the payoff from

00:58:01.661 --> 00:58:05.448
quit is 0 x P + 0 x 1 - P which
is 0.

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:07.131
V / [V + C]
+ 0 .

00:58:07.131 --> 00:58:11.550
C / [V + C]
but that's equal to what?

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:15.693
0, okay good.
So it's got to be the case

00:58:15.693 --> 00:58:19.566
(kind of conveniently) that if
they do play this mixed strategy

00:58:19.566 --> 00:58:23.515
equilibrium in stage 2,
the payoff they'll get from

00:58:23.515 --> 00:58:26.438
playing it is 0.
That's going to make life a

00:58:26.438 --> 00:58:31.064
little bit easier later on.
That's our new equilibrium in

00:58:31.064 --> 00:58:39.217
the second sub-game.
Now let's roll that back to the

00:58:39.217 --> 00:58:45.538
first game.
Here's our first game again,

00:58:45.538 --> 00:58:54.480
and everything about this is
correct except what's down here.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.650
So let's get rid of what's down
here.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:04.510
Our analysis from before is
more or less still intact.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:07.389
It's still the case,
that if they both quit they'll

00:59:07.389 --> 00:59:08.450
get 0.
If they (Quit,

00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:09.610
fight) they'll get (0,
V);

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:15.122
or (V, 0) and it's still the
case if they both fight they'll

00:59:15.122 --> 00:59:20.167
both incur costs of C and
they'll both then get stage 2

00:59:20.167 --> 00:59:24.210
continuation Nash payoffs.
Is that right?

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:27.522
But now instead of those
continuation Nash payoffs being

00:59:27.522 --> 00:59:29.932
(V, 0) or (0,
V), those continuation Nash

00:59:29.932 --> 00:59:35.159
payoffs are going to be what?
They're going to be 0.

00:59:35.159 --> 00:59:37.733
So what we're going to do here
is we're going to backward

00:59:37.733 --> 00:59:41.338
induct, or roll back,
those zero payoffs and come up

00:59:41.338 --> 00:59:46.690
with the corresponding matrix to
describe the first stage of the

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:48.579
game.
Here it is.

00:59:48.579 --> 00:59:54.578
Fight, Quit--I'll try to get it
right without Jake having to

00:59:54.578 --> 00:59:58.950
correct me this time--little f,
little q.

00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:01.550
This is A.
This is B.

01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:07.250
And the payoffs here are (0,0)
here;

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.940
(0, V);
(V, 0) just as before;

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:19.429
and, in this box now,
we've got -C + 0 and -C + 0.

01:00:19.429 --> 01:00:26.634
So it's exactly the same box we
saw before, but now the

01:00:26.634 --> 01:00:34.389
continuation payoffs are just 0.
Again, what is this?

01:00:34.389 --> 01:00:45.160
This is for the Nash
equilibrium--let's just say for

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:53.820
the mixed Nash equilibrium in
period 2.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.153
Now what I want to do is I want
to find the mixed equilibrium in

01:00:58.153 --> 01:01:00.793
period 1.
We found the mixed equilibrium

01:01:00.793 --> 01:01:02.899
in period 2.
Now I want to find the mixed

01:01:02.899 --> 01:01:05.679
equilibrium in period 1.
So what I could do here is I

01:01:05.679 --> 01:01:09.448
could spend a lot of time.
I could put in a P and a 1 - P

01:01:09.448 --> 01:01:13.260
and I could work out what mix of
Player B will make A

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.462
indifferent.
I could work out what mix of

01:01:15.462 --> 01:01:16.840
Player A would make B
indifferent.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.559
But has anybody noticed
something about this matrix?

01:01:19.559 --> 01:01:23.640
What do you notice about this
matrix?

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:28.610
Somebody help me out?
Somebody's got to help me out

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:31.013
here.
Tell me something about this

01:01:31.013 --> 01:01:33.570
matrix.
What's true about this matrix?

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.219
Student: It's the same
as the one above.

01:01:35.219 --> 01:01:36.516
Professor Ben Polak:
It's the same as the one

01:01:36.516 --> 01:01:39.426
above.
The matrix I just drew,

01:01:39.426 --> 01:01:46.602
when I rolled back the payoffs
is exactly the same matrix that

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:51.380
I had here.
It's exactly the same matrix.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.813
So we already know what the
mixed strategy equilibrium is in

01:01:55.813 --> 01:02:02.213
this.
The mixed Nash equilibrium in

01:02:02.213 --> 01:02:13.759
this matrix is both fight with
probability P = V / [V + C]

01:02:13.759 --> 01:02:23.886
So now we're ready to show our
new sub-game perfect

01:02:23.886 --> 01:02:30.510
equilibrium,
let's drag it down.

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:40.041
Here's our whole game,
we found the pure SPEs but now

01:02:40.041 --> 01:02:46.639
we're ready to find the mixed
SPE.

01:02:46.639 --> 01:02:51.004
The mixed sub-game perfect
equilibrium has Player A--before

01:02:51.004 --> 01:02:54.240
I do that let me just give this
P a name.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.424
Let me call this P, P*.
So V / [V + C],

01:02:57.424 --> 01:03:01.196
let's call it P*.
So the mixed sub-game perfect

01:03:01.196 --> 01:03:06.379
equilibrium has Player I mixing,
fighting with probability of P*

01:03:06.379 --> 01:03:09.738
in the first stage;
and in the second stage,

01:03:09.738 --> 01:03:12.382
again mixing,
fighting with probability of

01:03:12.382 --> 01:03:18.076
P*.
So this is Player 1 and Player

01:03:18.076 --> 01:03:25.405
2 does exactly the same thing.
While we're here,

01:03:25.405 --> 01:03:31.920
what's the expected payoff for
each player if they're playing

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.590
this mixed sub-game perfect
equilibrium?

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:47.119
It's 0--the payoff from
this--the expected payoff is 0.

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:51.533
So now we're actually getting
somewhere, now we're really

01:03:51.533 --> 01:03:55.485
getting somewhere.
So let's just take a deep

01:03:55.485 --> 01:03:59.538
breath and see where we are.
We broke this game down,

01:03:59.538 --> 01:04:02.894
this complicated game we played
in class, that conceivably--for

01:04:02.894 --> 01:04:04.799
example,
when New York is playing New

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.949
Jersey--conceivably it could go
on all night.

01:04:06.949 --> 01:04:08.759
Apparently not when the Texans
are playing each other or the

01:04:08.759 --> 01:04:10.139
football team is playing the
baseball team,

01:04:10.139 --> 01:04:12.468
but when we have New York and
New Jersey it could go on all

01:04:12.468 --> 01:04:14.361
night.
We curtailed it to a two period

01:04:14.361 --> 01:04:16.947
game, but in a minute,
we're going to go back to the

01:04:16.947 --> 01:04:19.563
infinite game.
In this two period game,

01:04:19.563 --> 01:04:24.164
I tried to argue--I'm trying to
convince you--that you could get

01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:28.036
fighting occurring just in
equilibrium with absolutely

01:04:28.036 --> 01:04:32.199
standard rational players:
nothing to do with pride,

01:04:32.199 --> 01:04:34.579
nothing to do with reputation,
nothing to do with the fact

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:37.126
that these guys are crazy guys
who drunk the water in New York

01:04:37.126 --> 01:04:39.530
and New Jersey,
God help them.

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:45.039
You can get fighting with
ordinary people in equilibrium.

01:04:45.039 --> 01:04:49.066
What we've shown is the way in
which you can get fighting is in

01:04:49.066 --> 01:04:53.442
a mixed strategy equilibrium.
In each period of the game,

01:04:53.442 --> 01:04:56.329
people fight with probability
P.

01:04:56.329 --> 01:05:00.177
That's just enough fight to
give the other side an incentive

01:05:00.177 --> 01:05:03.567
to quit and just enough
probability of the other side

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:07.350
quitting to give the other side
an incentive to fight;

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.922
just exactly enough.
If they play that equilibrium

01:05:10.922 --> 01:05:14.686
in every period,
there's some chance of the game

01:05:14.686 --> 01:05:19.016
ending but with probability P,
the game goes forward to the

01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:21.665
next period.
So you could potentially have

01:05:21.665 --> 01:05:24.789
fights for two periods.
By the way, with what

01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:28.699
probability would there be a
fight in both periods?

01:05:28.699 --> 01:05:31.144
That's a good homework
question, I won't answer it

01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:32.940
here, you can work it out at
home.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:38.010
Should we do it here?
Anybody want to tell me?

01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:42.010
So okay, with what probability
do we get a fight in the first

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:43.592
period;
a real fight,

01:05:43.592 --> 01:05:48.078
a fight involving both players?
We need both players to fight,

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:50.767
each are fighting with
probability of P,

01:05:50.767 --> 01:05:54.560
so the probability of both of
them fighting is what?

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.245
P².
So to get a fight in the first

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:59.099
period, the probability is
P².

01:05:59.099 --> 01:06:03.470
To get a fight in both periods
is what then?

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:06.045
P^(4).
But we get a fight with

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.840
probability of P^(4) going
through.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.945
We get fighting in equilibrium.
Moreover, we get some very

01:06:11.945 --> 01:06:15.329
intuitive things that we already
learned in the Hawk-Dove game.

01:06:15.329 --> 01:06:23.965
The probability of fight--so in
this equilibrium--the

01:06:23.965 --> 01:06:33.099
probability of fights occurring
goes up as V goes up.

01:06:33.099 --> 01:06:36.226
So the prize gets bigger,
you're more likely to see

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:38.290
fights occur:
that seems right.

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:46.404
It goes down in C.
So the probability of fights

01:06:46.404 --> 01:06:49.763
occurring goes up in the size of
the prize--that seems

01:06:49.763 --> 01:06:53.250
intuitively right--and down in
the cost of fighting.

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:57.922
Now, okay, that's reasonable,
but I claimed I could show you

01:06:57.922 --> 01:07:02.989
this not in a two period game,
but in an infinite period game.

01:07:02.989 --> 01:07:06.732
So let me spend the last five
minutes taking us to infinite

01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:10.469
period games.
So everybody take a deep breath.

01:07:10.469 --> 01:07:12.184
We're now going to consider
something, we've never done

01:07:12.184 --> 01:07:14.355
before.
We're going to consider a game

01:07:14.355 --> 01:07:21.139
that could go on forever.
It could go on forever.

01:07:21.139 --> 01:07:28.127
The way we're going to do that
is to use the following idea,

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.970
the following picture.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.018
So I can't really draw a true
tree for the infinite period

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.595
game.
The reason I can't draw a true

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:50.521
tree for the infinite period
game is: (1) I would run out of

01:07:50.521 --> 01:07:54.159
chalk;
and (2) I'd run into lunch time.

01:07:54.159 --> 01:07:56.260
But you can imagine what it
looks like.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.870
It looks like this,
roughly speaking.

01:08:06.099 --> 01:08:11.050
The infinite period game looks
something like this.

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:16.144
And then it goes again,
and then it goes again,

01:08:16.144 --> 01:08:22.456
and so on, and it would go
right the way through the board

01:08:22.456 --> 01:08:28.880
and work right the way across
whatever street that is,

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.475
right across campus.
That's what the infinite tree

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:33.137
would look like,
so I clearly can't really

01:08:33.137 --> 01:08:35.541
analyze that object.
But what I want to show you is

01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:38.092
that we can still solve this
game even though it's an

01:08:38.092 --> 01:08:40.810
infinite period game.
How are we going to do that?

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:43.409
Let's look at a particular
stage.

01:08:43.409 --> 01:08:49.221
Let's call the stage Stage
4,503 whatever that number was:

01:08:49.221 --> 01:08:54.454
4,503, whatever it was.
So here is the stage,

01:08:54.454 --> 01:09:01.103
this arbitrary stage,
and the tree for this arbitrary

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:07.345
stage looks like this.
What I'm going to do is:

01:09:07.345 --> 01:09:13.436
this is Stage 4,503,
and what I'm going to add to

01:09:13.436 --> 01:09:19.399
this is that before you get into
this stage,

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:24.100
you're going to incur sunk
costs.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:34.337
If you go on playing after this
stage then you're going to get

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:39.783
continuation values.
So going into the beginning of

01:09:39.783 --> 01:09:43.290
the game, you've incurred some
sunk costs and if you come out

01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:45.569
on the other side and go on
playing,

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:48.091
you're going to play some
equilibrium and get continuation

01:09:48.091 --> 01:09:49.953
values.
But otherwise everything else

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:53.662
is the same.
We still have (0,0) here,

01:09:53.662 --> 01:09:58.912
we still have (0,
V) here, we still have (V,

01:09:58.912 --> 01:10:06.360
0) here and here we still have
-C plus continuation values and

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:13.384
-C plus continuation values.
This is something we've seen

01:10:13.384 --> 01:10:15.908
before.
This little box is something

01:10:15.908 --> 01:10:18.659
we've seen before.
Essentially we've got sunk

01:10:18.659 --> 01:10:21.149
costs in front,
but they're irrelevant.

01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:23.947
We've got continuation values
at the end but we know how to

01:10:23.947 --> 01:10:26.310
handle them, we just put them
into the payoffs.

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:31.686
So suppose now that in the
continuation game,

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:38.039
people play the mixed strategy
that we just found.

01:10:38.039 --> 01:10:42.313
Suppose that in the
continuation game people mixed

01:10:42.313 --> 01:10:46.587
with probability P:
so they fight with P* and quit

01:10:46.587 --> 01:10:50.703
with probability 1 - P*.
Suppose in the continuation

01:10:50.703 --> 01:10:53.119
game they're playing a mixed
strategy.

01:10:53.119 --> 01:10:58.159
In that case,
what is the continuation value

01:10:58.159 --> 01:11:02.020
of the game?
What is it?

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:04.972
It's 0 right.
If they're mixing in the

01:11:04.972 --> 01:11:10.065
future, they always have the
option to quit so it must be

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:13.340
that the continuation value is
0.

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:22.338
So if they mix in the future
then the continuation value is

01:11:22.338 --> 01:11:28.524
(0,0).
So now let's go back to this

01:11:28.524 --> 01:11:31.793
board.
To make this board equivalent

01:11:31.793 --> 01:11:35.369
to the board above,
all I need to do is one thing.

01:11:35.369 --> 01:11:42.090
I need to add on some sunk
costs at the front.

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:43.880
I've got sunk costs at the
front.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.720
I'm going to play the game.
And then I'm going to get,

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.960
instead of stage 2 values,
I'm going to get stage--what

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.619
was it?--4,503 and all stages in
the future values in here and

01:11:54.619 --> 01:11:57.319
here, but otherwise it's the
same thing.

01:11:57.319 --> 01:12:00.380
And what's convenient is:
all of those are 0 anyway.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:04.657
Since they're all 0 anyway,
this matrix is still correct,

01:12:04.657 --> 01:12:08.706
the continuation values are 0
and 0, these are now the

01:12:08.706 --> 01:12:10.540
continuation values.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.649
And so if I look for a
mixed-strategy equilibrium in

01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:25.310
this game, it's something I've
solved already.

01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:27.690
What's the mixed strategy
equiliibrium in this game?

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:33.627
Anybody?
It's exactly what we found

01:12:33.627 --> 01:12:36.935
before.
Just as before,

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:44.920
I'm going to mix with
probability of V / [V + C].

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.725
Let's summarize,
we did something today--just

01:12:47.725 --> 01:12:50.020
now--that we've never done
before.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:53.966
We've looked at an infinite or
at least potentially infinite

01:12:53.966 --> 01:12:57.109
period game: a game that could
go on forever.

01:12:57.109 --> 01:13:01.588
The way in which we handled the
game that could go on forever

01:13:01.588 --> 01:13:04.260
was what?
We noticed two things.

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:07.797
We noticed that part of the
game that comes before,

01:13:07.797 --> 01:13:10.840
that part of the game that's
passed already,

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:14.590
anything that happened there is
just a sunk cost.

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:17.840
It's irrelevant.
It hurts if it's a cost.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.503
It's nice if it's a gain.
But it's sunk,

01:13:20.503 --> 01:13:24.484
you can't affect it now.
Anything in the future can be

01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:28.960
summarized by the value,
the payoff I'm going to get in

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.520
the future by playing the
equilibrium in the future.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.680
In this case,
the future meant mixing.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.604
Mixing gave me the value of 0.
So here I am getting 0 from the

01:13:42.604 --> 01:13:45.784
future.
Then I can just analyze the

01:13:45.784 --> 01:13:50.434
game in the stage in which I'm
in, just as if it was an

01:13:50.434 --> 01:13:54.739
ordinary, bog-standard,
simultaneous move game.

01:13:54.739 --> 01:13:56.240
When we did so,
in this particular

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.969
example--we're going to see more
examples like this after the

01:13:58.969 --> 01:14:00.880
break--but in this particular
example,

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.619
we found out something quite
surprising.

01:14:03.619 --> 01:14:07.083
This thing we found out was,
in these war of attrition

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:10.090
settings, there is an
equilibrium with rational

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:12.751
players--more than that,
common knowledge of

01:14:12.751 --> 01:14:14.853
rationality: everybody's
rational, everyone knows

01:14:14.853 --> 01:14:17.479
everyone else is rational--there
are equilibria in which,

01:14:17.479 --> 01:14:21.310
not only people fight but they
could fight forever.

01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:25.002
In every period they fight with
some probability and we got an

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:28.332
extra prediction out of it,
a prediction that we weren't

01:14:28.332 --> 01:14:30.094
expecting.
Let me just give you that

01:14:30.094 --> 01:14:32.069
prediction, and then we'll leave
the class with that.

01:14:32.069 --> 01:14:36.198
The extra prediction is this,
if we look at these wars of

01:14:36.198 --> 01:14:40.696
attrition, and we keep track of
the time in which the--hang on

01:14:40.696 --> 01:14:44.529
guys don't rush to the back
yet--one more thing.

01:14:44.529 --> 01:14:49.678
If we look at the time in which
the games have gone on and keep

01:14:49.678 --> 01:14:54.660
track of the probability that a
war will end at that time.

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.839
So imagine this is World War I.
You could imagine World War I

01:14:57.839 --> 01:14:59.384
going for one year,
or two years,

01:14:59.384 --> 01:15:01.460
or three years,
or 20 years or whatever.

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.782
The probability distribution in
this war of attrition is going

01:15:05.782 --> 01:15:08.632
to look like this.
In every period,

01:15:08.632 --> 01:15:12.930
the probability of continuing
is just P*².

01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:15.271
So, in every period,
the chance that--as you get

01:15:15.271 --> 01:15:18.261
further into the future there's
a greater chance the war will

01:15:18.261 --> 01:15:20.634
end.
You can get very long,

01:15:20.634 --> 01:15:24.020
very costly wars;
that's the bad news.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.770
The good news is it doesn't
happen very often.

01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:29.553
I guess we're all involved in a
rather large and costly war

01:15:29.553 --> 01:15:32.384
right now, so I'll leave you
with that pleasant thought over

01:15:32.384 --> 01:15:35.046
Thanksgiving.
Have a good break and we'll see

01:15:35.046 --> 01:15:36.112
you afterwards.

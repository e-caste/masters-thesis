00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.683
Prof: What I'm planning
to do today is to spend a half

00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:10.683
an hour or less just telling you
a little bit about what a new

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:13.832
theory might be,
what I call the Leverage Cycle,

00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:17.262
and then spend the rest of the
time maybe answering questions

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:19.550
about the course that you might
have.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.104
I could, if you wanted to,
devote the whole time to what

00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:24.773
the new theory is,
but why don't I at least pause

00:00:24.773 --> 00:00:27.710
after a half an hour and see if
you have questions?

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.572
So what is the thing that's
been missing from the entire

00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:37.170
course and has been missing from
economic theory,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.290
I think, almost entirely for
all these years,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.791
and certainly missing from all
the textbooks that you might

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:47.930
have looked at during the course
of the semester,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.259
and you remember there was a
list of 20 books or something

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.328
you could have read,
and that's the idea of

00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:54.490
collateral.
 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.479
It's the idea that in order to
guarantee that you're going to

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.868
keep your promise you have to
put up collateral,

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:05.072
and people just don't trust in
everyone else keeping their

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:07.349
promise,
they want collateral.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:11.790
So if you put that into the
model what sorts of things might

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.920
be different?
 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.552
So I want to just work out an
example so you can see how they

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:16.209
might change.
 

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:20.242
I want to talk about an example
that's going to illustrate what

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:21.870
happened in our crisis.
 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.513
And I guess that it's a little
interesting that I wrote this

00:01:25.513 --> 00:01:28.849
and I presented this in 2000 at
the World Congress,

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.605
and it got published in 2003,
so this was long before the

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:33.209
crisis.
 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.769
Now, as I said,
there had been other smaller

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:40.985
crises before in 1998,
maybe '94, maybe '87,

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:43.920
certainly '98,
and of course I was thinking

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.430
about these previous crises when
I built this model,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.010
but not many other people
thought much of those other

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.629
crises.
 

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:53.354
And as it happens,
this last one that we're still

00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:55.927
at the bottom of,
or a little past the bottom of,

00:01:55.927 --> 00:01:58.340
I think is very similar to the
ones we had before,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.590
but just much bigger.
 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.010
So here's my simple version of
it.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.560
I'm going to give two models,
a very simple one with two

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.016
periods and a slightly more
complicated one with three

00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:09.552
periods,
and of course all the

00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:11.908
interesting things happen in the
three-period case,

00:02:11.908 --> 00:02:14.716
but just to make it simple to
understand I'm starting with the

00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:15.360
simpler one.
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.808
So suppose that there's a
security which I'm going to call

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.199
Y that everybody holds.
 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.750
Why is there no chalk?
 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.030
Gosh, I taught the class in
here, I just finished lecturing

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.235
in here with a whole box,
oh here it is,

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.650
a whole box of chalk.
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.015
So suppose that there's a
security Y that I'm going to

00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:44.205
think of as a mortgage security,
or you could think of it as a

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.497
house,
or you could think of it as an

00:02:46.497 --> 00:02:49.870
oil well that has uncertain
output in the next period.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.979
And then there's going to be
something like gold that I'll

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:53.470
call X.
 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.952
So this might be like gold,
and this might be like a

00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:02.841
mortgage security,
or like an oil well,

00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:05.938
or you might think of it as a
house,

00:03:05.938 --> 00:03:07.289
but I'll think of a mortgage
security,

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:08.158
an oil well.
 

00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:11.810
It's something that pays an
uncertain outcome in the future,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.882
and this is something that's
very stable and you know exactly

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:18.195
you've got gold this period,
if you just save it you'll have

00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:19.699
the same gold next period.
 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.115
So now people are going to
differ according to how

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:23.938
optimistic or pessimistic they
are.

00:03:23.938 --> 00:03:26.930
That's my idea of,
not everybody's the same.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.120
So I imagine that there are two
possibilities next period.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.774
Either the Y,
the oil well,

00:03:33.774 --> 00:03:37.960
could produce--it's a gold-well
really.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.116
It could produce 2 pieces of
gold, I mean,

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:44.272
1 piece of gold,
or it could produce .2,20

00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:46.660
percent of a piece of gold.
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.960
So everybody begins with 1 oil
well,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.770
1 mortgage security and 1 piece
of gold,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.461
so they can consume the gold or
they can make it a filling for

00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:58.651
their teeth,
or they can wait next period

00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:01.304
and then they'd have it in
either state next period because

00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:05.306
it's perfectly durable,
or they could use the gold to

00:04:05.306 --> 00:04:10.669
buy more oil wells,
each of which might pay off 1

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:11.479
or .2.
 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.810
So that's it.
 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.680
Now people care about the
consumption of gold.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.220
The only reason to get the oil
well,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.069
as Fisher, as we've assumed all
through the class,

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.774
the only reason to get the oil
well is that it might produce

00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:26.079
gold for you next period,
gushing oil, money, gold.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:28.660
It might gush some gold for you
next period.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.767
So people care about
consumption, how much gold they

00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:33.855
eat here,
times the probability that

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:36.654
they're going to be up here,
times how much they eat here,

00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:39.209
plus the probability that
they're going to come down here,

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:40.350
times how much they eat here.
 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.742
In other words they are risk
neutral with no discounting and

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.619
they just multiply consumption
here and here by the

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.149
probabilities and add the
consumptions,

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:50.930
and then add it to the
consumption here.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.264
Everybody's got the same
utility, but with one

00:04:53.264 --> 00:04:53.940
difference.
 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.959
H is the probability agent H
attaches to going up.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.290
So I think of these people as a
continuum of buyers now.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.459
Instead of 2 buyers like we've
always had,

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:07.309
or 3 buyers,
or even 1 buyer ,

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:10.752
I've got a continuum and
they're different because some

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:13.050
are more optimistic than others.
 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.369
Now, this is stuff that we
haven't really paid much

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:16.389
attention to before.
 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.303
So these optimists are the
people who have H very close to

00:05:19.303 --> 00:05:21.317
1,
and lots of other people have

00:05:21.317 --> 00:05:23.689
Hs in the middle,
and there are some people who

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:24.279
think H is 0.
 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.250
That's the way they differ.
 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.298
So of course the very most
optimistic person thinks the oil

00:05:29.298 --> 00:05:30.980
well is worth 1 piece of gold.
 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.879
He doesn't discount,
and he thinks he's going to get

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.949
1 for sure, so he'd be willing
to pay 1 for it here.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.031
The most pessimistic person
thinks the oil well is only

00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:40.660
worth .2.
 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.420
And let's say she'd only be
willing to pay .2 for it here.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.300
So what's the price of oil
wells going to be?

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.180
Well, if we just had our usual
model,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.283
a one period model,
we would see that the people

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:02.115
with the high H would sell their
gold to buy more oil wells

00:06:02.115 --> 00:06:05.220
because they thought it would be
valuable,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.148
and the people with the low Hs,
thinking the oil wells weren't

00:06:08.148 --> 00:06:10.850
worth much,
would sell them to the high H

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.649
people to get more gold in the
present.

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:16.610
That's basically what would
happen.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.499
And you'd get some dividing
line where the people above A

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:24.250
would be buying oil wells,
spending all their money.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.269
And the people below A would be
selling oil wells and getting

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:29.139
more money.
 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.083
So, for example,
if A was .69,

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:33.898
which is what it's going to
turn out to be,

00:06:33.898 --> 00:06:37.920
Mr. A, what does he think the
value of an oil well is?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.997
He thinks it's .69 times 1 .31
times .2 which is .06,

00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:50.490
so .69 .06 is .75.
 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.370
So Mr.
 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.389
69 thinks the oil well's worth
about 75.

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.180
Everyone above him thinks it's
worth more than 75,

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.190
so if the price were .75
everyone above would want to buy

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.415
and everyone below would say
it's not worth .75 so I'll sell

00:07:08.415 --> 00:07:10.836
it,
and since they're risk neutral

00:07:10.836 --> 00:07:14.528
their valuation is independent
of how much of it they have.

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:16.889
So these people below would
want to sell everything,

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.389
and these people above would
want to buy everything.

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.011
So that's nothing different
from what we've done from the

00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.819
very beginning except that maybe
the one difference is people

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.129
would go to the extreme.
 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.331
These guys would spend all
their money buying oil wells

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.829
because every time they bought
an oil well at a price of .75

00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:34.314
this guy,
for example,

00:07:34.314 --> 00:07:35.569
was sure it's worth 1.
 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:37.199
The more he buys the better he
is.

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.968
So he'd spend all his money in
oil wells and these guys would

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:42.459
sell all their oil wells,
but other than that it's very

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:43.889
similar to what we've done.
 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.279
So what's the difference going
to be?

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:51.000
The difference is just one
thing.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.079
Where do I divide this dividing
line A?

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.990
Well, can these guys up here
afford to buy all these oil

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.560
wells?
 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.795
Well, the answer is,
so far, it doesn't look like

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:03.617
that's possible,
because if the dividing line is

00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:07.370
way up here these guys up here
don't have enough money to buy

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.310
all the oil wells down here.
 

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.874
After all, they only have 1
piece of gold apiece and if the

00:08:12.874 --> 00:08:16.069
oil well costs 75 they can each
buy 1 and 1 third.

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:19.716
If you multiply that by 1 and 1
third you're never going to buy

00:08:19.716 --> 00:08:21.600
all these oil wells down here.
 

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.110
So this seems like it's too
high for A to be.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.601
So the new twist is,
maybe the guys up here who want

00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:33.355
the oil wells,
who are so sure they're going

00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:35.922
to do well,
maybe they can borrow money to

00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:37.190
buy the oil wells.
 

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.808
So they can make a promise to
pay money in the future,

00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:45.168
maybe .5 and .5 in the future,
say,

00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:49.668
and then sell those promises,
borrow money in other words,

00:08:49.668 --> 00:08:53.357
promising in the future,
and then use that money to buy

00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:54.519
more oil wells.
 

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:56.058
So that's what people do in the
market.

00:08:56.058 --> 00:08:59.004
Any hedge fund,
the three definitions of a

00:08:59.004 --> 00:09:00.716
hedge fund,
the three defining

00:09:00.716 --> 00:09:04.312
characteristics of a hedge fund,
I think I might have said once,

00:09:04.312 --> 00:09:05.933
are,
a) that they hedge,

00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:09.860
so unlike other money managers
they're always trying to hedge.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.149
And we talked about what
hedging is.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:14.190
And many, many more managers
are doing that than ever before.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.519
It's different from 50 percent
of the people,

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:21.304
but not from,
you know, the hedge funds are 5

00:09:21.304 --> 00:09:24.659
percent and the other 45 percent
are also hedging,

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:25.629
so that's not so different.
 

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:29.092
The second thing they do is
they borrow money to make their

00:09:29.092 --> 00:09:29.928
investments.
 

00:09:29.928 --> 00:09:32.070
A lot of these other managers
aren't allowed to borrow.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.190
They may not be allowed to
hedge either.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.289
Those are called long only
managers.

00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:38.159
They can't hedge.
 

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:40.230
Some of them can't borrow.
 

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.437
Hedge funds hedge and borrow,
and then hedge funds charge

00:09:44.437 --> 00:09:45.340
high fees.
 

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.429
That's the third defining
characteristic.

00:09:47.429 --> 00:09:48.798
But anyway, so they borrow.
 

00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:51.615
And in the economy,
I told you last time,

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:55.700
a huge number of people
borrowed a huge amount of money.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.580
So borrowing is obviously very
important.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.080
So how much are they going to
be able to borrow?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.712
I mean, this guy,
number one, he'd like to borrow

00:10:02.712 --> 00:10:03.918
as much as he could.
 

00:10:03.918 --> 00:10:07.374
Every time he borrows money
he's sure that he's going to be

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.197
up here,
so every time he borrows 1

00:10:09.197 --> 00:10:11.577
dollar he gets to make an
investment that he's sure is

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:14.629
going to be a great investment,
and he's planning on paying

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:17.808
everything back because he's
sure he's going to go here,

00:10:17.808 --> 00:10:19.528
so he's going to be incredibly
rich.

00:10:19.528 --> 00:10:22.272
So he's going to pay back what
he borrows, but he's going to

00:10:22.272 --> 00:10:24.548
get such a profit he's going to
make a fortune.

00:10:24.548 --> 00:10:27.080
So if people could borrow
however much they wanted to,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.794
and promise to payback,
this guy would borrow

00:10:29.794 --> 00:10:30.812
everything,
Mr.

00:10:30.812 --> 00:10:33.465
1, I mean, would borrow
everything and imagine he was

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:36.332
going to get up here for sure,
and imagine he was going to

00:10:36.332 --> 00:10:42.643
keep his promise for sure,
and he bid the price up almost

00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:43.668
to 1.
 

00:10:43.668 --> 00:10:46.619
But now, who's going to lend to
him and how much will they

00:10:46.619 --> 00:10:47.808
actually lend to him?
 

00:10:47.808 --> 00:10:51.986
Well, in our old world we
didn't worry about who was going

00:10:51.986 --> 00:10:52.720
to lend.
 

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.147
Everybody assumed they were
going to get paid back,

00:10:55.147 --> 00:10:58.011
but in reality people don't
assume they're going to get paid

00:10:58.011 --> 00:10:58.450
back.
 

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.830
The lenders are going to say to
themselves,

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.865
"Wait a minute,
if this guy promises us to pay

00:11:02.865 --> 00:11:05.341
us,
say, .5 and .5 maybe he'll be

00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:09.350
very rich over here and he'll be
able to pay us back,

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.269
but I'm not sure he's going to
be so rich here.

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:14.519
I don't even know what he has.
 

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:17.359
How do I know what the borrower
is going to actually have in

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:18.370
these states?"
 

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.971
I don't want to look into his
personal bank account and find

00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:23.620
out everything about him.
 

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.201
That's the way,
banks who lend sometimes do

00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:29.767
that and they go to a lot of
effort to check how reliable a

00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:32.820
borrower you are,
but people in general,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.139
most of the lenders,
you don't want to do that.

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:37.899
That was the idea of
securitization.

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:41.837
We don't have to have so much
careful looking into the

00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:44.288
personal finances of everybody.
 

00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:49.918
Much simpler is to use the
asset Y as collateral.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.210
So if Y is collateral,
what does that mean?

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.505
When you lend 1 dollar to a
borrower the borrower just

00:11:55.505 --> 00:11:58.990
doesn't borrow the dollar
promising to pay something back

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.110
in the future.
 

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.171
The borrower says,
"if I don't pay you back

00:12:03.171 --> 00:12:05.190
you can take the asset."
 

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.642
So the question is,
for each unit of the asset Y,

00:12:09.642 --> 00:12:14.187
how much can you borrow when
you have the asset as

00:12:14.187 --> 00:12:15.580
collateral?
 

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.090
That's the question of leverage.
 

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:27.267
So if you take the value of Y
divided by the cash down--so

00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:30.970
let's do two numbers.
 

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:37.597
So the borrowed,
dollars borrowed using Y as

00:12:37.597 --> 00:12:47.154
collateral, that divided by the
value of Y, that's what we call

00:12:47.154 --> 00:12:53.629
the loan to value,
LTV, loan to value.

00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:58.299
Another way of saying that is
the borrowed,

00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:02.303
if you take Y,
dollar Y minus dollars

00:13:02.303 --> 00:13:08.308
borrowed, that--let's write it
in the denominator.

00:13:08.308 --> 00:13:16.836
Dollar Y minus dollars
borrowed, and here you put value

00:13:16.836 --> 00:13:23.308
of Y, so just dollar Y,
in other words.

00:13:23.308 --> 00:13:25.816
The dollar of Y minus the
dollar borrowed,

00:13:25.816 --> 00:13:28.139
that's the cash you had to put
down.

00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:34.070
So that's the dollar of Y
divided by the cash down.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:45.700
That's what's called leverage.
 

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.061
So, and it's obviously the same
thing as loan to value because

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:52.091
you just sort of invert the
number and do a subtraction,

00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:53.250
you get leverage.
 

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.763
So if you knew the loan to
value you'd know the leverage

00:13:55.763 --> 00:13:56.539
and vice versa.
 

00:13:56.539 --> 00:13:57.720
They're the same thing.
 

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.308
So what should the loan to
value be?

00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:03.671
And so as I said,
historically what's happened

00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:07.779
over the last ten years for
housing is you had to put 14

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:09.048
percent down.
 

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:11.710
The leverage was 7 for buying
houses,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.950
non-agency houses,
non-prime houses,

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.283
starting in 2000,
and then it went to 33 or 35 to

00:14:20.283 --> 00:14:25.070
1 because you put down less than
3 percent in 2006.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.269
So this leverage shot up and
then it suddenly collapsed.

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:31.940
You had to put 25 percent down,
so leverage fell to 4.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.815
So that, I'm going to explain,
has a big effect on the price

00:14:35.815 --> 00:14:39.100
of housing and the price of
mortgage securities.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.450
So what should leverage be?
 

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.009
How can supply and demand
determine what leverage is?

00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:46.220
So it seems like you've got to
clear all these markets.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.211
You've got to figure out how
does the Y market clear,

00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:52.548
how does the gold market clear,
and then on top of that you

00:14:52.548 --> 00:14:54.389
have to figure out leverage.
 

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:56.995
It seems like it's a lot of
complicated things to figure

00:14:56.995 --> 00:14:57.279
out.
 

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:58.840
And I think economists just
thought,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.970
"Oh, there's so much going
on,

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.070
and people are really generally
keeping their promises anyway,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.342
let's ignore the fact that you
have to have all this

00:15:06.342 --> 00:15:07.190
collateral."
 

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.010
Well, I think that collateral
is the heart of the problem in

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:10.490
finance.
 

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.980
So how would it work in this
model?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.808
So are you with me about where
we're going?

00:15:17.808 --> 00:15:25.442
So you have to conceptually
figure out how to think about

00:15:25.442 --> 00:15:27.350
the problem.
 

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.440
In other words,
conceptually,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.533
the question is,
how can supply equals demand,

00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:40.379
which sounds like one equation,
how can that determine the

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:48.721
interest rate,
supply equals demand for loan,

00:15:48.721 --> 00:16:00.250
how can that determine the
interest rate and the leverage?

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.700
It seems like you have one
equation and how can you

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.710
determine two things with one
equation?

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.606
Well, the answer is that you
can do it, but first we need a

00:16:09.606 --> 00:16:13.070
conceptual framework to think
about it.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.398
So it seems like a
contradiction almost,

00:16:15.398 --> 00:16:18.921
a mathematical contradiction,
so it must be that the problem

00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:21.250
is ill posed,
and so I claim it is.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.182
So what you really should be
thinking is that there's not

00:16:25.182 --> 00:16:28.793
just one interest rate,
and one leverage,

00:16:28.793 --> 00:16:34.565
you should be thinking that
there's the promise and then

00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:41.279
there's the collateral and those
things taken together define the

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:42.750
contract.
 

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:50.725
So let's say the promise is .2,
.2, and the collateral is 1

00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:54.850
unit of Y, .2 of X,
.2 of X.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.662
So you're promising 2 units
[correction: 0.2 units]

00:16:57.662 --> 00:17:00.755
of gold in the future and
you've got 1 unit of Y as your

00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:01.600
collateral.
 

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:09.420
So that implies a delivery of
.2 and .2.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.288
Why is that?
 

00:17:10.288 --> 00:17:14.243
Because in the good state at
the top the collateral is worth

00:17:14.243 --> 00:17:16.273
1,
so if you've made the promise

00:17:16.273 --> 00:17:19.778
and the lender can seize your
collateral if you don't pay,

00:17:19.778 --> 00:17:22.306
you're going to either pay .2
or he's going to seize the

00:17:22.306 --> 00:17:24.440
collateral,
and so you're going to pay .2.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.868
Maybe you'll sell some of the
collateral to pay .2.

00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:29.640
And if the promise is .2 down
here,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.446
the same thing,
either he's going to seize the

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:32.888
collateral,
the lender will seize the

00:17:32.888 --> 00:17:34.720
collateral or you'll sell it and
keep your promise.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.060
In either case it'll deliver .2
and .2, and it's going to sell

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.548
for some price.
 

00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:47.404
And the price is actually going
to be 1, so the interest rate

00:17:47.404 --> 00:17:49.259
effectively is 0.
 

00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:50.210
Now, why is that?
 

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.654
Well, because at time 0 over
here no one discounts the

00:17:55.654 --> 00:17:56.578
future.
 

00:17:56.578 --> 00:17:59.078
Gold at the beginning is worth
exact--

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:02.195
to everybody--a unit of gold at
the beginning is the same as a

00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:05.057
unit of gold at the end in both
states because everyone's

00:18:05.057 --> 00:18:06.589
probabilities add up to 1.
 

00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:08.818
H (1 - H) is 1.
 

00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:11.595
So you might as well consume at
the beginning or for sure at the

00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:11.858
end.
 

00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:14.759
So since there's a lot of gold
sloshing around here there are

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:17.516
always lenders willing to lend
at a 0 percent interest and

00:18:17.516 --> 00:18:19.740
they're getting their money back
for sure.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.829
So it'll turn out that the
interest rate on this kind of

00:18:22.829 --> 00:18:24.222
loan,
which is riskless,

00:18:24.222 --> 00:18:26.708
is going to be 0,
because no one's discounting

00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:28.940
and they're getting their money
for sure.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:36.134
But what if you promised .3 and
.3 with 1 unit of Y as

00:18:36.134 --> 00:18:37.900
collateral?
 

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.210
Then what would the delivery be
in that case?

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.553
Well, the delivery wouldn't be
(.3, .3) because the only thing

00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:46.910
protecting the promise is the
collateral.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.880
The delivery would be .3 and
.2, right?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.220
Because in the up state your
collateral is worth 1,

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.910
and so you would be forced to
pay the .3,

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.684
in the down state you would do
what a lot of homeowners are

00:19:00.684 --> 00:19:03.195
doing now and say,
"Okay, I owe you so much

00:19:03.195 --> 00:19:03.559
money.
 

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:06.180
My loan to value is 150 percent.
 

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.890
The value of my house has gone
down to 2 thirds.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.690
The loan is 150 percent of the
value of my house.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.108
I'd be crazy to pay you 150
percent.

00:19:15.108 --> 00:19:18.160
Effectively I don't own my
house.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.930
I owe so much more on my house
than the house is worth.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.348
I can't give it to my children.
 

00:19:22.348 --> 00:19:24.028
I can't do anything with the
house anyway.

00:19:24.028 --> 00:19:27.480
Why should I just pay such a
huge amount of money?

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.420
I might as well just give up
the house."

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.368
They walk away from the house
and the lender gets .2.

00:19:32.368 --> 00:19:37.863
So (.3, .2) would be the
delivery, and of course if it

00:19:37.863 --> 00:19:42.318
was .4 and .4 it would also be
.4 and .2.

00:19:42.318 --> 00:19:47.827
Now, if you made this promise
of .3 and .3 you'd be delivering

00:19:47.827 --> 00:19:51.078
something more than .2 at the
top.

00:19:51.078 --> 00:19:53.414
So the price,
of course, would be more than

00:19:53.414 --> 00:19:55.250
.3 [correction:
more than 0.2].

00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:03.316
So the price might be--price of
the .3 promise will turn out to

00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:07.220
be something like .261,
say.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.599
It might be .261.
 

00:20:10.599 --> 00:20:13.308
Let's just say .261.
 

00:20:13.308 --> 00:20:19.170
So effectively you're borrowing
.261, you're delivering .3.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.838
This is the .3.
 

00:20:20.838 --> 00:20:26.577
This is up here,
pi_.3 = .261,

00:20:26.577 --> 00:20:28.490
the sub .3.
 

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:32.858
So effectively your interest
rate is, in the state when you

00:20:32.858 --> 00:20:36.852
can pay back at the top,
your interest rate is .3 over

00:20:36.852 --> 00:20:37.529
.261.
 

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:42.538
It's like 14 percent or 15
percent actually.

00:20:42.538 --> 00:20:49.990
It's 15 percent,
so .3 over .261 is 1.15,

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:58.558
so this over here means 15
percent interest.

00:20:58.558 --> 00:21:00.962
So you've effectively,
because they know you're going

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:03.781
to default in one of the states
you have to pay much more than

00:21:03.781 --> 00:21:05.400
you borrowed in the good state.
 

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.009
So effectively you're promising
a 15 percent interest.

00:21:08.009 --> 00:21:09.528
You're promising it in all the
states.

00:21:09.528 --> 00:21:13.749
You're only delivering a
portion of what you promise in

00:21:13.749 --> 00:21:15.000
the bad state.
 

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.430
All right, so what's my point?
 

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.500
My point is that the apparent
contradiction,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.488
supply equals demand
determining both interest and

00:21:23.488 --> 00:21:25.828
leverage,
is no contradiction at all

00:21:25.828 --> 00:21:29.788
because actually we've got many
supply equals demand equations.

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:33.804
There are many different loans
depending on the ratio of the

00:21:33.804 --> 00:21:35.710
collateral to the promise.
 

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.892
There are many different loans
and each of them sells for a

00:21:38.892 --> 00:21:39.880
different price.
 

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.144
So we've got many different
things we're determining,

00:21:43.144 --> 00:21:46.156
many interest rates,
but one supply equals demand

00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:47.788
equation for each one.
 

00:21:47.788 --> 00:21:50.789
So every supply equals demand
equation produces one price.

00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:52.420
There's no contradiction.
 

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.843
However, that still leaves us
with the question,

00:21:55.843 --> 00:21:59.848
which of these many contracts
are going to be traded?

00:21:59.848 --> 00:22:05.118
Can we say that the economy as
a whole has a single leverage?

00:22:05.118 --> 00:22:08.734
And there the surprise is,
and this is the end of the

00:22:08.734 --> 00:22:11.517
first part of the model,
the surprise is,

00:22:11.517 --> 00:22:12.558
yes we can.
 

00:22:12.558 --> 00:22:26.900
Only this one is going to get
traded.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.409
So everybody in the economy,
no matter how optimistic you

00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:33.951
are or how pessimistic you are,
even though you have the

00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:36.538
available chance to make a
bigger promise,

00:22:36.538 --> 00:22:40.108
and of course having to promise
a bigger interest rate,

00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:41.240
sorry, there's the interest
rate.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.383
Even though everyone has
available that opportunity,

00:22:43.383 --> 00:22:44.980
they won't avail themselves of
that.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.650
Everybody will trade on this
promise.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.578
So how could that be?
 

00:22:49.578 --> 00:22:52.473
And by the way,
before we answer that question

00:22:52.473 --> 00:22:56.398
let's just see that if everyone
used this promise that in fact

00:22:56.398 --> 00:22:59.680
the price we talked about before
would prevail.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.445
So why is this .69--that A
should be a little lower,

00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:05.440
it doesn't look like .69.
 

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.936
It looks a little too high,
but anyway it's supposed to be

00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:09.119
69 percent of the way up.
 

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:10.720
Why is that the right price?
 

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.650
Well, how much could these guys
buy?

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:20.359
Well, the top 31 percent,
what can they do?

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:27.069
They've got .31 cigarettes.
 

00:23:27.069 --> 00:23:28.588
So I'll write it over here.
 

00:23:28.588 --> 00:23:31.170
They've got .31 cigarettes
between them.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.920
The top 31 percent are the
buyers, right?

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:40.353
So we've got 31 percent here
and 69 percent of the people

00:23:40.353 --> 00:23:44.029
down here, and here's A = .69.
 

00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:47.660
So these guys have .31
cigarettes between them.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.184
Now, if they promise,
every time they buy an oil well

00:23:51.184 --> 00:23:54.294
they promise .2 units,
every one of them,

00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:59.088
they're going to buy all the
oil wells in the whole economy.

00:23:59.088 --> 00:24:04.570
So however many people there
are here, let's call it mass of

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:09.959
1, maybe it's a million people,
mass of 1, they're going to

00:24:09.959 --> 00:24:11.259
borrow .2.
 

00:24:11.259 --> 00:24:20.450
So this is their own gold and
this is borrowed gold.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.371
Student: When you say
cigarettes you're talking about

00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:22.598
gold?
 

00:24:22.598 --> 00:24:23.539
Prof: Did I say
cigarettes?

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:24.670
Yes, I meant, yeah.
 

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.289
It's another example of gold.
 

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:26.950
I meant gold.
 

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:30.258
So you could think of gold,
consume it now or consume it

00:24:30.258 --> 00:24:30.740
later.
 

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.088
Cigarettes you can consume now
or consume later.

00:24:33.088 --> 00:24:35.682
I have all these things in my
head of what I could have

00:24:35.682 --> 00:24:37.410
interpreted, so yeah,
I mean gold.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.961
So you can consume the gold,
thank you, the gold now or the

00:24:40.961 --> 00:24:44.390
gold later, so each of these
guys owns 1 unit of gold.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.160
So 31 percent of the population
has 1 unit of gold.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.529
So you've got .31 total units
of gold.

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:54.355
They end up buying all the oil
wells, and so how much can they

00:24:54.355 --> 00:24:58.308
borrow on all the oil wells
using as collateral?

00:24:58.308 --> 00:25:01.355
So the oil wells they started
with, they borrow using those as

00:25:01.355 --> 00:25:04.300
collateral, and the oil wells
that they buy they also use as

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.048
collateral.
 

00:25:05.048 --> 00:25:06.509
So they've got all the oil
wells.

00:25:06.509 --> 00:25:10.891
They're making the (.2,
.2) promise but it has a price

00:25:10.891 --> 00:25:11.470
of 1.
 

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.400
There's no interest.
 

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.170
The interest rate is 0,
so they're borrowing .2.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:19.961
So the total amount of gold
that they have at their disposal

00:25:19.961 --> 00:25:24.265
is .31 .2, and how many oil
wells do they have to buy,

00:25:24.265 --> 00:25:27.269
69 percent of the oil wells,
.69.

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:32.160
And if you take 31 and 20
that's 51 over 69,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.045
which is about .75,
which is exactly what I said

00:25:35.045 --> 00:25:37.868
the price is that's going to
make this guy,

00:25:37.868 --> 00:25:38.071
Mr.
 

00:25:38.071 --> 00:25:41.170
69, exactly indifferent to
buying or selling.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.170
So all the people up here are
going to say,

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.490
"At the price of .75 it
really is a good deal,

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.940
I want to buy and borrow as
much as I can."

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.808
People down here are all going
to want to sell.

00:25:51.808 --> 00:25:55.251
The people up here with the
money they started with plus

00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:58.881
what they can borrow are going
to be able to indeed buy all

00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:01.259
these oil wells at a price of
.75.

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:04.228
That's what we just found and
that's why that's the

00:26:04.228 --> 00:26:05.058
equilibrium.
 

00:26:05.058 --> 00:26:09.329
Did that go too fast,
or almost too fast?

00:26:09.329 --> 00:26:10.328
Yeah, question?
 

00:26:10.328 --> 00:26:14.821
Student: I was just
wondering, for the price of the

00:26:14.821 --> 00:26:16.950
.2 pounds, why is that 1?
 

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.759
Prof: Because you're
going to get the money for sure.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:25.548
So how much money is being
lent, basically .2.

00:26:25.548 --> 00:26:28.240
So there are a huge number of
guys down here.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.808
Their total amount of gold is
.69, right?

00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:36.068
There's one unit of gold in the
whole economy.

00:26:36.068 --> 00:26:40.061
They own 69 percent of the gold
and they're only lending in

00:26:40.061 --> 00:26:40.818
total .2.
 

00:26:40.818 --> 00:26:44.753
So there's lots of extra gold
that they have that they're not

00:26:44.753 --> 00:26:45.410
lending.
 

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.279
They don't care whether they
get gold now or gold later

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:51.413
because there's no discounting
and they're getting the money

00:26:51.413 --> 00:26:52.368
back for sure.
 

00:26:52.368 --> 00:26:55.472
So competition between these
lenders is going to drive the

00:26:55.472 --> 00:26:57.269
interest rate all the way to 0.
 

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:59.965
If the interest rate were
positive they'd all want to rush

00:26:59.965 --> 00:27:02.851
in and lend because then they're
going to get more gold out at

00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:05.357
the end than they had at the
beginning and there's not

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:06.210
discounting.
 

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.867
So the competition among
lenders will drive the interest

00:27:09.867 --> 00:27:12.794
rate down to 0,
and they're guaranteed to get

00:27:12.794 --> 00:27:16.119
paid back because the
collateral's big enough.

00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:17.288
You had a question?
 

00:27:17.288 --> 00:27:18.210
Student: I'm still
confused.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.892
For the first state if you only
promise to pay .2 in the future,

00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:27.588
so shouldn't the price be .2
right now?

00:27:27.588 --> 00:27:29.009
Prof: Oh,
and I said the price is 1.

00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:29.450
Yes.
 

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.220
The price per unit is .2.
 

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.329
Yeah, that's horrible.
 

00:27:32.329 --> 00:27:32.809
Thank you.
 

00:27:32.809 --> 00:27:34.868
The price is .2, exactly.
 

00:27:34.868 --> 00:27:37.710
The price is .2 for the promise
of (.2, .2).

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.880
It's price of 1 per unit
promise.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.630
The price is .2, exactly.
 

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.019
Gosh, what a terrible mistake.
 

00:27:43.019 --> 00:27:43.858
Thank you very much.
 

00:27:43.858 --> 00:27:49.828
It's .2, exactly,
and that's why these guys

00:27:49.828 --> 00:27:54.902
they're able to--
they're promising .2 and the

00:27:54.902 --> 00:27:59.328
price per unit promise,
so this price was,

00:27:59.328 --> 00:28:02.278
yeah, its price is .2.
 

00:28:02.278 --> 00:28:05.910
So per unit promise their price
is 1, in other words.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.160
So they're promising .2 and per
unit promise the price is 1,

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.528
so the price of the whole
promise is .2,

00:28:11.528 --> 00:28:14.490
exactly, so it's just that,
so that was--

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.078
so the price is .2.
 

00:28:17.078 --> 00:28:20.092
Using the whole of the
economy's worth of oil wells as

00:28:20.092 --> 00:28:23.558
collateral you can promise 20
percent of all the gold and then

00:28:23.558 --> 00:28:26.529
you're going to get--
you'll be able to borrow doing

00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:30.317
that the same amount,
20 percent of all the gold,

00:28:30.317 --> 00:28:33.299
because the interest rate's 0.
 

00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:34.410
Yes?
 

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.498
So that's why this total amount
of gold that they can get their

00:28:38.498 --> 00:28:40.603
hands on,
some people call it liquidity,

00:28:40.603 --> 00:28:42.529
all the stuff they can get
their hands on,

00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:46.166
capital, they take all that and
they buy all the oil wells they

00:28:46.166 --> 00:28:46.519
can.
 

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:49.544
This is how many are being
sold, and that's therefore what

00:28:49.544 --> 00:28:50.338
the price is.
 

00:28:50.338 --> 00:28:55.039
The ratio of 51 to 69 is almost
exactly .75, so I'm rounding off

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:56.160
a little bit.
 

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.806
And that's why Mr. A of .69
is indifferent at this price to

00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:01.190
buying or selling.
 

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.970
The guys above him all want to
buy.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.740
This is how much money they can
get their hands on and therefore

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.710
what they can spend.
 

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.380
All these guys want to sell.
 

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.558
That's what they're selling.
 

00:29:09.558 --> 00:29:12.420
That's why this justifies the
price, and these guys are the

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.848
ones lending to these guys.
 

00:29:13.848 --> 00:29:17.934
The pessimists have nothing to
do but lend because they don't

00:29:17.934 --> 00:29:19.569
want to buy the asset.
 

00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:20.950
Does this make sense?
 

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.471
I'm just going to repeat the
same thing with a three period

00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:25.864
model where it gets more
exciting, but the logic of this

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:26.559
is critical.
 

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:29.068
So is everyone with me?
 

00:29:29.068 --> 00:29:32.578
Now, there's one thing I left
out in this one period model,

00:29:32.578 --> 00:29:35.300
two period model,
which is what about the (.3,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.269
.3) promise?
 

00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:39.539
The optimist, H equals 1.
 

00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:40.650
Take that guy.
 

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:44.220
He says to himself,
"I can't lose.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:55.498
Why should I be satisfied with
only promising (.2,

00:29:55.498 --> 00:29:56.880
.2)?
 

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.942
Why don't I make a bigger
promise like (.3,

00:29:59.942 --> 00:30:00.380
.3).
 

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.890
With my bigger promise I get
more money today,

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:11.834
and with that extra money today
I can use it and buy an oil

00:30:11.834 --> 00:30:15.256
well,
and I'm going to make a profit

00:30:15.256 --> 00:30:16.420
of 33 percent.
 

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:22.808
My .75 is going to turn into 1
for sure, so why isn't that just

00:30:22.808 --> 00:30:26.210
a brilliant thing for me to do?
 

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.740
Why should I be satisfied?
 

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.688
The more oil wells I get my
hands on the better I seem to

00:30:33.688 --> 00:30:34.660
do."
 

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.920
So why is he not making the
(.3, .3) promise?

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.153
So it sounds like he ought to,
but if you think about it one

00:30:41.153 --> 00:30:43.730
more minute you'll realize that
he shouldn't.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.790
And why is that,
because he could promise (.2,

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:47.200
.2).
 

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.098
So if he makes the (.3,
.3) promise of course he has to

00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:52.905
give up the (.2,
.2) promise because the oil

00:30:52.905 --> 00:30:55.618
well he used as collateral for
the (.3,

00:30:55.618 --> 00:30:58.768
.3) promise he no longer has
available for the (.2,

00:30:58.768 --> 00:30:59.650
.2) promise.
 

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.989
So the question isn't,
should he do a (.3,

00:31:02.989 --> 00:31:04.130
.3) promise.
 

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.132
Well, if that was the only
thing he could do of course he

00:31:06.132 --> 00:31:07.609
would do that,
so of course it looks

00:31:07.609 --> 00:31:10.140
profitable, but he's already got
a great profit opportunity.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.369
The question is,
is it a better profit

00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:14.480
opportunity and the answer is
no.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.578
Why is that?
 

00:31:15.578 --> 00:31:19.492
Because he is still delivering
.2 down here when he makes the

00:31:19.492 --> 00:31:20.521
(.3,
.3) promise,

00:31:20.521 --> 00:31:23.809
but when he makes the (.3,
.3) promise he delivers more at

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:26.625
the top,
namely .3, but that's the state

00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:28.740
he's sure is going to happen.
 

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.622
So compared to the (.2,
.2) promise he's giving away

00:31:31.622 --> 00:31:34.673
more money just in the state
that he thinks is going to

00:31:34.673 --> 00:31:35.240
occur.
 

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.509
That's very expensive for him.
 

00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:38.329
That's a horrible thing for him
to have to do.

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:39.779
And who's lending him the money?
 

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:42.763
It's the guy down here,
and the guy down here,

00:31:42.763 --> 00:31:44.288
that's the pessimist.
 

00:31:44.288 --> 00:31:48.154
He doesn't think that top
state's going to occur so he's

00:31:48.154 --> 00:31:51.808
only willing to pay extra money
at the beginning--

00:31:51.808 --> 00:31:53.921
he's not willing to pay very
much extra money at the

00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:56.489
beginning because he's going to
get stuff in a state he doesn't

00:31:56.489 --> 00:31:57.690
think is going to happen.
 

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.798
So anyway, I don't have time
work it all out,

00:31:59.798 --> 00:32:04.250
but if you think it through
you'll realize that nobody wants

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.800
to do this trade,
because the guys at the top who

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.490
seem to have the greatest
advantage in borrowing more,

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:13.970
when they borrow more in this
way where they're defaulting,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.270
they're actually paying more
only in the state that they

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.740
think is going to occur and the
people doing the lending are

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.210
getting money only in the state
they think won't occur.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.470
So both of them think it's a
worse arrangement than the

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.200
original (.2,
.2) arrangement,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.044
and so even though there's a
price and it's available to be

00:32:29.044 --> 00:32:31.630
traded nobody will want to trade
it.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.262
So the market does indeed pick
out a single leverage,

00:32:35.262 --> 00:32:37.150
and what is the leverage?
 

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.529
The leverage as we calculated
from this number is the price of

00:32:40.529 --> 00:32:44.759
the asset,
which is .75 divided by the

00:32:44.759 --> 00:32:50.868
cash down which is .55,
because you can borrow .2,

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:54.058
and that's 1.4 or something.
 

00:32:54.058 --> 00:32:59.490
I don't know exactly,
but let's say 1.38 leverage,

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.038
1.35 is the leverage.
 

00:33:02.038 --> 00:33:06.250
So it's not that high,
the leverage.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.821
And the principle is,
that we just discovered when

00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:10.868
you have this kind of
heterogeneity,

00:33:10.868 --> 00:33:12.892
different kinds of
heterogeneity produce different

00:33:12.892 --> 00:33:14.673
amount of leverage,
and I'm not going to be able to

00:33:14.673 --> 00:33:17.770
talk about that,
but with this kind of leverage

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:22.868
the promise will always be the
maximum for which there is no

00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:23.818
default.
 

00:33:23.818 --> 00:33:25.663
That's how much borrowing is
going to happen,

00:33:25.663 --> 00:33:27.088
and the market's going to
allow.

00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:29.380
So in what market do we always
see that happening?

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.578
In the Repo market,
it's a one day market

00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:33.538
overnight.
 

00:33:33.538 --> 00:33:36.323
You put up a security as
collateral, and you can borrow

00:33:36.323 --> 00:33:39.260
money on it, and there's almost
never any default on those

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:39.880
markets.
 

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.451
Even in the tremendous crisis
we just had almost zero defaults

00:33:43.451 --> 00:33:44.740
in the Repo markets.
 

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.529
Mortgage markets there were
defaults,

00:33:46.529 --> 00:33:49.186
but there the heterogeneity
isn't just how optimistic you

00:33:49.186 --> 00:33:50.452
are,
it's whether you like to live

00:33:50.452 --> 00:33:52.670
in the house or not,
so it's a different case which

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.079
I won't have time to cover.
 

00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:55.150
So this is part one.
 

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.420
We're just going to say the
same thing in part two.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.390
I'm going slower than I
thought, but anyway,

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:02.269
the last model is going to be
part two.

00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:03.769
So are there any questions
about that?

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:05.920
Did this first part...
 

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.640
Yeah?
 

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.800
Student: Maybe this is
sort of a silly question,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.119
but...
 

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:10.018
Prof: I'm sure it's not.
 

00:34:10.018 --> 00:34:14.081
Student: Are there some
lenders sort of in the middle

00:34:14.081 --> 00:34:18.213
like more optimistic pessimists
who think the upstate is more

00:34:18.213 --> 00:34:22.619
likely to occur so maybe they're
willing to lend more money?

00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:24.219
Prof: There are.
 

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.617
There are a whole continuum of
people between 0 and 1,

00:34:26.617 --> 00:34:29.242
so the guys in the middle they
really don't have any choice

00:34:29.242 --> 00:34:29.650
here.
 

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.204
You see in the next model
there's going to be a

00:34:32.204 --> 00:34:35.260
difference, but now you really
don't have any choice.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.829
If you're above A you should
buy to the maximum.

00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:41.065
If you're below A you should
sell everything,

00:34:41.065 --> 00:34:44.217
and you don't care if you lend
or not because you're definitely

00:34:44.217 --> 00:34:45.590
going to get paid back.
 

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:50.750
So they're all willing to lend.
 

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.409
So let's now go to the next
model.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:55.929
So that was a great question.
 

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.242
So far we only get two
categories of people,

00:34:59.242 --> 00:35:01.784
buyers-borrowers,
sellers-lenders,

00:35:01.784 --> 00:35:06.329
so we're going to move beyond
that in the next example.

00:35:06.329 --> 00:35:08.639
Any questions about this one?
 

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:11.480
So we get equilibrium leverage
and leverage has a tremendous

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.539
effect on the price.
 

00:35:12.539 --> 00:35:15.952
Why does it affect the price,
because the fact that these

00:35:15.952 --> 00:35:19.791
guys were able to borrow so much
money is what made the price so

00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:20.340
high.
 

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.619
If they couldn't borrow that
would wipe out this .2.

00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:27.331
They couldn't have borrowed
that, so they would have only

00:35:27.331 --> 00:35:29.898
had this much to spend,
so the price would have had to

00:35:29.898 --> 00:35:30.768
be much lower.
 

00:35:30.768 --> 00:35:32.909
And of course these guys
wouldn't have been able to

00:35:32.909 --> 00:35:33.809
afford all of this.
 

00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:36.735
So as the price gets much lower
more people would want to buy

00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:39.027
and you would have the marginal
buyer down here,

00:35:39.027 --> 00:35:40.880
and there'd be a much lower
price.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.440
So this borrowing is what
jacked up the price.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.409
Leverage means high prices.
 

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:48.889
It seems like the most obvious
thing in the world and

00:35:48.889 --> 00:35:52.840
commonsensical thing in the
world, but remember it never got

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.250
mentioned in this course,
right?

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.000
It never gets mentioned in any
textbook.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.590
The price is supposed to be the
fundamental value,

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.510
the present value of all the
dividends,

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.139
or the expected present value
of all the dividends,

00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:07.510
meaning minus the covariance or
something.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.789
Where was leverage in that
formula?

00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:13.150
It didn't happen because we
didn't have the idea.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:16.362
We assumed that everyone could
borrow as much as they wanted

00:36:16.362 --> 00:36:19.465
to, but here we see that they
can't borrow as much as they

00:36:19.465 --> 00:36:20.119
want to.
 

00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:21.789
They're limited in how much
they can borrow,

00:36:21.789 --> 00:36:24.550
and because they're limited
it's going to turn out,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.378
if you make the limit less
severe they're going to borrow

00:36:27.378 --> 00:36:29.550
more and the price is going to
be higher.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.838
So you ignore leverage by
saying people can always borrow

00:36:31.838 --> 00:36:34.947
whatever they want to,
then it never gets mentioned,

00:36:34.947 --> 00:36:37.469
but it's the heart of the
matter,

00:36:37.469 --> 00:36:40.679
I think, at least in a crisis.
 

00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:45.969
So let's just do one more
version of the model,

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:52.409
which is this same thing,
but now with 1 extra period.

00:36:52.409 --> 00:36:56.130
So what's the extra period
going to do?

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.139
The extra period is,
we've got instead of two

00:36:59.139 --> 00:37:01.329
periods we have three periods.
 

00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:06.559
So what's going to happen is
the .2 only happens with two

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:08.518
pieces of bad news.
 

00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:10.849
You have to go down twice to
get .2.

00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:13.349
Otherwise Y pays off 1.
 

00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:16.443
And everyone's going to begin
at the beginning there with 1

00:37:16.443 --> 00:37:18.949
unit of Y and 1 unit of gold
just as before,

00:37:18.949 --> 00:37:23.429
and they could consume in the
middle,

00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:25.202
or they could consume in the
end, but they have no more

00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:25.630
endowments.
 

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.603
All their endowments are right
at the beginning,

00:37:27.603 --> 00:37:28.989
1 unit of Y and 1 unit of gold.
 

00:37:28.989 --> 00:37:29.980
There's no discounting.
 

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.550
They just care about the
expected consumption.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:36.909
The difference is now it takes
two periods to see the

00:37:36.909 --> 00:37:39.559
realization, so two pieces of
bad news.

00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:43.039
Now, why is that interesting,
two pieces of bad news?

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:46.400
Well, when I was in the crisis
both in '98 when I thought about

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.373
this model,
created this model,

00:37:48.373 --> 00:37:51.682
but also recently,
is people start to realize

00:37:51.682 --> 00:37:53.559
things are going wrong.
 

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:55.987
So if something goes wrong and
now everyone says,

00:37:55.987 --> 00:37:58.869
"Well, things are still
okay now, but I realize we're

00:37:58.869 --> 00:37:59.730
closer."
 

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.092
It takes a lot of things to go
wrong for things to collapse,

00:38:03.092 --> 00:38:06.570
but each time one of them goes
wrong you're a little closer to

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:07.539
the collapse.
 

00:38:07.539 --> 00:38:14.958
So I make the assumption that
agents are all identical except

00:38:14.958 --> 00:38:17.605
agent H--
high H means you think you're

00:38:17.605 --> 00:38:19.802
going to get up moves,
but there are two moves,

00:38:19.802 --> 00:38:22.070
at the beginning and also in
the second period.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.713
So if you're an optimist about
the first up move you're also

00:38:24.713 --> 00:38:27.000
going to be an optimist about
the second up move.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.670
Now, let's suppose your H
equals .87, say,

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.121
just to pick a number,
which it's going to turn out to

00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:34.489
be a pivotal guy.
 

00:38:34.489 --> 00:38:34.731
Mr.
 

00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:38.684
87 at the beginning,
the chances of going down are

00:38:38.684 --> 00:38:41.891
13 percent for him,
then 13 percent more,

00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:44.340
so the chance of getting a
disaster,

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.860
he thinks, is 13 percent
squared, 1.69 percent,

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.179
under 2 percent.
 

00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:54.090
So he thinks the value of the
asset is over 98,

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:58.291
under 2 percent here the rest
of the 98 must be over there

00:38:58.291 --> 00:39:02.554
somewhere,
so obviously his valuation is

00:39:02.554 --> 00:39:03.579
over 98.
 

00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:07.556
Now, once he gets down to here
he realizes the chances have

00:39:07.556 --> 00:39:10.230
gone from 1.69 percent to 13
percent.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:14.280
So his valuation is going to be
a little bit more than 87,

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.710
because it's going to be 87
percent of that and 13 percent

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.250
of that,
so it's 87 plus a little bit.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.972
So he's going to go down from
98 something,

00:39:21.972 --> 00:39:23.139
to 87 something.
 

00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:26.989
So of course when the first
down state happens everybody

00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:29.369
gets more pessimistic including
Mr.

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:29.860
87.
 

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.981
He now thinks that the asset
value maybe went from 98 to 87,

00:39:34.981 --> 00:39:39.927
which is an 11 point drop,
and everybody's going to have a

00:39:39.927 --> 00:39:40.710
drop.
 

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:47.440
He went from 98 plus to 87 plus
a little bit.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.820
So it's an 11 point drop is
what he thinks happened.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.789
So you can see this is bad news.
 

00:39:53.789 --> 00:39:57.170
When it takes two things to go
wrong the first piece of bad

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.969
news people are going to take it
as bad news,

00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:03.545
but the interesting thing that
happens is that actually they

00:40:03.545 --> 00:40:04.820
get more uncertain.
 

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.440
Things go up you get 1 for sure.
 

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.280
Now you've learned something.
 

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.090
There's no uncertainty.
 

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.313
Here the move down created more
uncertainty than you had before,

00:40:14.313 --> 00:40:16.929
and not only that,
more disagreement.

00:40:16.929 --> 00:40:17.789
I mean, Mr.
 

00:40:17.789 --> 00:40:18.572
.9 and Mr.
 

00:40:18.572 --> 00:40:23.188
.8, neither of them thought
there was much chance of getting

00:40:23.188 --> 00:40:24.518
down to here.
 

00:40:24.518 --> 00:40:27.719
.9 thought 1 percent squared,
that's negligible.

00:40:27.719 --> 00:40:31.389
.8 thought 2 percent squared;
that's .004.

00:40:31.389 --> 00:40:34.025
The difference between
negligible an .004 is still

00:40:34.025 --> 00:40:35.652
negligible,
practically,

00:40:35.652 --> 00:40:39.186
so they hardly disagree here,
but once you get down to here

00:40:39.186 --> 00:40:41.474
they're both starting to get
more worried and they're

00:40:41.474 --> 00:40:44.159
actually differing a little bit
more than they did before.

00:40:44.159 --> 00:40:46.280
So that's what I think happens
in these crises.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.882
You go from everyone knowing if
25 things in a row go wrong

00:40:50.882 --> 00:40:54.173
we're in trouble,
but nobody's really thinking,

00:40:54.173 --> 00:40:56.349
except the guys at the very
bottom,

00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:58.920
that all of this stuff can go
wrong.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.096
But once each thing goes wrong
now everyone gets more and more

00:41:02.096 --> 00:41:04.909
worried and there's more
separation between what people

00:41:04.909 --> 00:41:05.429
think.
 

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.980
So that's just description of
the model.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.400
So what's going to happen is
the question.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.893
So we're almost at the end here
because we don't have to do much

00:41:16.893 --> 00:41:18.320
more calculations.
 

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.527
So what will the prices be at
the beginning and down here,

00:41:22.527 --> 00:41:27.179
and what will the leverage be
at the beginning and down here?

00:41:27.179 --> 00:41:32.324
Well, remember our principle
that the leverage will always be

00:41:32.324 --> 00:41:37.041
worked out in this case of
heterogeneous beliefs so that

00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:40.210
people can promise--
so there will be no default.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:44.244
The maximum promise is the most
you can make without any chance

00:41:44.244 --> 00:41:45.090
of default.
 

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:49.920
So you can see that--I'll tell
you what the prices are.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.639
They're going to be that.
 

00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:55.760
So if you made a two period
loan, a long loan,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.239
a lot can go wrong over a long
loan.

00:41:59.239 --> 00:42:01.860
You can get all the way down to
.2, so you're not going to be

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.349
able to borrow very much if you
make a two period loan.

00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:08.110
If you make a one period loan,
in a day not much can go wrong.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.460
That's why these Repo markets
are so short.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.728
In one day practically nothing
can go wrong,

00:42:12.728 --> 00:42:15.949
well here something does go
wrong, but you can fall to .69.

00:42:15.949 --> 00:42:17.469
It's a lot better than .2.
 

00:42:17.469 --> 00:42:20.929
So you could borrow at the
beginning .69.

00:42:20.929 --> 00:42:23.523
That'll be the equilibrium
promise at the beginning,

00:42:23.523 --> 00:42:25.099
will be .69 with no interest.
 

00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:27.980
The equilibrium promise here
will be .2 with no interest.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:32.789
The equilibrium promise there
will be 1 with no interest.

00:42:32.789 --> 00:42:37.280
So this turns out to be the
equilibrium.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.840
Why?
 

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.980
Notice how shocking it is.
 

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.940
Nobody thinks the price drop
from 95 to 69 is justified.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.170
That's a huge 26 percent drop.
 

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.389
Mr.
 

00:42:48.389 --> 00:42:52.070
87, he thought the price should
go from 98 to 87.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.039
That's an 11 point drop.
 

00:42:54.039 --> 00:42:54.195
Mr.
 

00:42:54.195 --> 00:42:56.420
1 thought it was worth 1 at the
beginning.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.750
He still thinks it's worth 1.
 

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:58.789
That's no drop.
 

00:42:58.789 --> 00:43:02.086
Mr. H equals 0 thought it was
worth .2 at the beginning and

00:43:02.086 --> 00:43:03.849
still thinks it's worth .2.
 

00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:05.210
That's no drop.
 

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.869
No matter who you pick,
I think the worst one is .5,

00:43:09.869 --> 00:43:15.059
.5 thought it was worth--we
have to figure it out,

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:17.579
25 percent chance of going down
here,

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:18.829
75 up there.
 

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:26.030
So .75 .5 is .8, right?
 

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:31.949
25 percent of .2 is .05.
 

00:43:31.949 --> 00:43:35.722
So Mr. H equals .5,
thinks the expected payoff is

00:43:35.722 --> 00:43:40.125
.8,75 percent of one of those
1s, and 25 percent of .2 is

00:43:40.125 --> 00:43:41.539
another .05.
 

00:43:41.539 --> 00:43:43.768
So .75 and .05 is .8.
 

00:43:43.768 --> 00:43:47.800
So he thinks down here where
he's a .5 it's now worth .5 and

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.690
.5 of this.
 

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:49.659
It's .6.
 

00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:52.152
So he thought the drop would be
from 80 to 60,

00:43:52.152 --> 00:43:53.150
a 20 point drop.
 

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.936
That's the biggest drop anybody
could imagine,

00:43:55.936 --> 00:43:56.679
20 points.
 

00:43:56.679 --> 00:43:59.929
Most people are at 11 points or
0 points or something like that.

00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:02.559
Nobody's at a 26 point drop.
 

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:06.539
That's way bigger than anybody
could imagine is justified by

00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:10.172
the bad news in the economy,
yet that's what the equilibrium

00:44:10.172 --> 00:44:14.050
becomes,
from 95 percent to 69 percent.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.429
So why is that?
 

00:44:15.429 --> 00:44:16.579
And that's the end of the story.
 

00:44:16.579 --> 00:44:18.030
What happened in the drop?
 

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:22.460
Well, three things went wrong.
 

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.826
The first thing is that 87 is
the marginal buyer,

00:44:25.826 --> 00:44:28.000
so everyone above him bought.
 

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.909
All these optimists were buying.
 

00:44:29.909 --> 00:44:32.820
Everyone else sold and lent
money.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.639
Student: You just assume
that, right.

00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:35.280
Prof: What?
 

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.088
Student: You just said
let's assume 87 is the marginal

00:44:37.088 --> 00:44:37.329
buyer?
 

00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:39.592
Prof: I'm assuming that
and it's going to turn out to be

00:44:39.592 --> 00:44:40.360
the correct answer.
 

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.010
Now, how did I know 87?
 

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.929
Well, you'll see at the end.
 

00:44:43.929 --> 00:44:45.300
Yeah, question?
 

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:45.768
No.
 

00:44:45.768 --> 00:44:50.920
Just fixing your hair,
that's okay.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.619
So Mr. 87 is the marginal buyer.
 

00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:56.309
So those guys at the top bought.
 

00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:58.530
Now, how could they afford to
buy so much?

00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.880
Well, they're borrowing so much.
 

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.181
They're borrowing .69 plus they
already had their .31

00:45:04.181 --> 00:45:08.648
[correction: their .13],
so together they can spend .69

00:45:08.648 --> 00:45:09.309
.13.
 

00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:16.943
That's .82 that they're
spending and they're only buying

00:45:16.943 --> 00:45:21.940
87, and so 82 over 87 is about
95.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.219
So there's a little rounding
going on.

00:45:23.219 --> 00:45:25.190
So that's why the price is .95.
 

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:28.050
Now, why did it crash to .69?
 

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.489
It crashed because look what
happened.

00:45:30.489 --> 00:45:34.864
These total optimists at the
beginning, the top 13 percent,

00:45:34.864 --> 00:45:39.465
they spent all the money that
they had, their 13 percent gold,

00:45:39.465 --> 00:45:41.730
they spent the 13 percent.
 

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.070
They borrowed everything they
could to the hilt so they owed

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:46.260
.69 in both states.
 

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.860
So what happens to them here?
 

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.554
They spent all their gold and
they owe the total value of

00:45:50.554 --> 00:45:51.469
their collateral.
 

00:45:51.469 --> 00:45:52.590
They're wiped out here.
 

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.018
They've got nothing left.
 

00:45:54.018 --> 00:45:56.817
So the most optimistic people
in the economy,

00:45:56.817 --> 00:45:58.980
they're just out of the
economy.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:00.369
They've all gone bankrupt.
 

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:04.925
So now we've got a smaller
population with less optimistic

00:46:04.925 --> 00:46:09.161
people, and so these new
optimists are going to do the

00:46:09.161 --> 00:46:10.360
buying now.
 

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.070
Well, first of all they don't
think the asset's worth as much

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.199
for a bunch of reasons.
 

00:46:14.199 --> 00:46:16.740
One is they got bad news,
so the people who are left

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.929
don't think it's worth as much
as they did from the beginning.

00:46:19.929 --> 00:46:23.255
Plus the most optimistic people
at the beginning aren't there

00:46:23.255 --> 00:46:25.411
either,
and then lastly and most

00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:29.213
importantly the people who are
left can't borrow very much

00:46:29.213 --> 00:46:33.550
money because the leverage at
the beginning was .95 over .26,

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.820
you could borrow 69,
so you had to pay down .26.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.650
That's 3.6 leverage.
 

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.719
Here the price is .69.
 

00:46:40.719 --> 00:46:44.059
You can only borrow .2,
so you have to put .49 down.

00:46:44.059 --> 00:46:45.880
The leverage is 1.4.
 

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.967
So you went from 3 and 1 half
leverage to 1 and 1 half

00:46:48.967 --> 00:46:49.610
leverage.
 

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:53.568
The leverage collapsed,
and so these guys who are left

00:46:53.568 --> 00:46:57.753
they are not as optimistic
themselves because they've got

00:46:57.753 --> 00:47:00.891
bad news,
the most optimistic people are

00:47:00.891 --> 00:47:02.847
gone,
and the people who want to do

00:47:02.847 --> 00:47:04.518
the buying can't borrow as much.
 

00:47:04.518 --> 00:47:07.289
So there are three reasons that
drives the price down.

00:47:07.289 --> 00:47:10.320
The marginal buyer becomes a
much lower guy than before,

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.469
and so that's why the price is
lower.

00:47:12.469 --> 00:47:15.311
It's not just the bad news
because Mr.

00:47:15.311 --> 00:47:18.539
87 would never have justified
that drop.

00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:22.563
It's because the thing has
fallen into more pessimistic

00:47:22.563 --> 00:47:23.159
hands.
 

00:47:23.159 --> 00:47:26.447
So all those bankers and hedge
funds who bought all those

00:47:26.447 --> 00:47:29.679
mortgage securities at the
beginning, they've been wiped

00:47:29.679 --> 00:47:30.559
out by now.
 

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:31.239
They're way up here.
 

00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:32.210
They can't buy.
 

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.510
They're much more sober people
who are left who also know we've

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:36.309
had bad news.
 

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:38.996
They're willing to pay less to
begin with, and they are more

00:47:38.996 --> 00:47:41.000
pessimistic, and they can't
borrow very much,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.050
so the price drops for all
those reasons.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.480
I think that's the essence of
the crash.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.188
Three reasons,
the people going bankrupt who

00:47:48.188 --> 00:47:51.969
are the most optimistic buyers,
the second reason because the

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:53.039
news was bad.
 

00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:53.940
That's the first reason.
 

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:57.793
The news was bad,
optimistic buyers going out and

00:47:57.793 --> 00:48:02.369
the leverage collapsing,
so the price drops a long way.

00:48:02.369 --> 00:48:04.760
So I'll end with one more slide
and then sum up.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.050
The last slide is his question
about the classes of people.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:12.789
It's a little different now
than it was before.

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:14.710
There are different classes of
people.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.360
So let's just think about this.
 

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.461
Why was the marginal buyer Mr.
 

00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:21.010
87?
 

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.882
I mean, after all we just
computed, Mr.

00:48:23.882 --> 00:48:27.510
87 thinks the value of the
asset's 98, not 95.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.840
Mr.
 

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:33.235
86 also thinks the value of the
asset is 98 about,

00:48:33.235 --> 00:48:35.880
so why didn't 86 buy?
 

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.710
He was getting a good deal at
the beginning.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:41.650
Why wasn't 86 buying when he
thinks it's worth 98 here?

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:41.885
Mr.
 

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:44.949
.86, remember,
is not supposed to buy.

00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:48.889
He's going to buy the next time.
 

00:48:48.889 --> 00:48:49.556
See Mr.
 

00:48:49.556 --> 00:48:53.179
86 there, he's the cautious
optimist.

00:48:53.179 --> 00:48:53.384
Mr.
 

00:48:53.384 --> 00:48:56.860
86 there, just below 87,
he's going to buy after the

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.179
crash, but he's not buying now.
 

00:48:59.179 --> 00:49:07.750
So why is it that he's not
buying at the beginning?

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.521
Well, so this is the only
subtlety, but it's the answer to

00:49:11.521 --> 00:49:12.579
your question.
 

00:49:12.579 --> 00:49:12.809
Mr.
 

00:49:12.809 --> 00:49:16.409
86 says to himself,
"I can make a profit.

00:49:16.409 --> 00:49:20.349
I think it's worth 98 and I
only have to pay 95.

00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:22.820
That's like a 3 percent
expected return and I'm risk

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.079
neutral so that's great.
 

00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:26.550
If I'm right it goes from 95 to
100.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:27.949
I can get 5 percent.
 

00:49:27.949 --> 00:49:30.318
On the other hand,
maybe I should wait for the

00:49:30.318 --> 00:49:30.739
crash.
 

00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:34.039
If the crash comes I only have
to pay 69.

00:49:34.039 --> 00:49:38.420
I can get 40 percent return,
31 over 69, whatever that is.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:42.670
I can get a 40 percent return
if there's a crash.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:48.449
That's much better than my 5
percent if I'm right."

00:49:48.449 --> 00:49:53.699
So that guy is waiting to make
money in the cash.

00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:56.992
So of course by waiting and
buying in the crash he's helping

00:49:56.992 --> 00:50:00.119
to reduce the terrible calamity,
because he's a buyer.

00:50:00.119 --> 00:50:03.748
If we just had more people like
that--I think of that as Warren

00:50:03.748 --> 00:50:06.266
Buffett, I called him the
cautious optimist,

00:50:06.266 --> 00:50:07.612
all the way down to Mr.
 

00:50:07.612 --> 00:50:08.139
.74.
 

00:50:08.139 --> 00:50:08.336
Mr.
 

00:50:08.336 --> 00:50:11.427
.75, for example,
also thinks the asset is worth

00:50:11.427 --> 00:50:15.240
more than .95 at the beginning,
but he doesn't buy either,

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.753
so all these people,
the cautious optimists,

00:50:17.753 --> 00:50:20.706
they're holding out for the
crash and the crash would be

00:50:20.706 --> 00:50:23.481
much worse without them,
but they don't eliminate the

00:50:23.481 --> 00:50:25.480
crash because there are not
enough of them.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.675
So here are the three classes
of people you were thinking

00:50:27.675 --> 00:50:27.989
about.
 

00:50:27.989 --> 00:50:29.420
They're not quite as optimistic.
 

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:33.449
They still think it's a good
buy, but they decide not to buy

00:50:33.449 --> 00:50:35.090
waiting for the crash.
 

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.199
Now, how did I know that it
would stop at 87 and 74?

00:50:38.199 --> 00:50:39.268
How did I get all those numbers?
 

00:50:39.268 --> 00:50:41.985
Well, I don't have time to
derive them, those are the

00:50:41.985 --> 00:50:44.389
equations, but I can explain it
very simply.

00:50:44.389 --> 00:50:47.436
You see, thinking you're going
to take advantage of the crash

00:50:47.436 --> 00:50:49.010
means you must have a high H.
 

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:51.293
You think if things go here
they're still going to end up

00:50:51.293 --> 00:50:51.579
okay.
 

00:50:51.579 --> 00:50:53.849
That's why you think there's a
big profit opportunity.

00:50:53.849 --> 00:50:56.914
But if your H is too high you
don't think you're ever going to

00:50:56.914 --> 00:50:57.869
get to the crash.
 

00:50:57.869 --> 00:51:00.900
So you've only got this small
intermediate group of people,

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.106
the Warren Buffett like people,
who are optimistic enough to

00:51:04.106 --> 00:51:07.150
think that we're going to pull
out of our depression,

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:10.969
pull out of the crash and still
there's a profit opportunity,

00:51:10.969 --> 00:51:14.909
and yet think that the crash is
likely enough so that they'll

00:51:14.909 --> 00:51:15.829
wait for it.
 

00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:17.927
People who think they'll make a
bigger profit,

00:51:17.927 --> 00:51:20.818
higher H once the crash starts,
well, they don't even think the

00:51:20.818 --> 00:51:22.170
crash is going to happen.
 

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:26.175
So I've made a big assumption
that the people with high Hs

00:51:26.175 --> 00:51:29.480
always have high Hs,
but I think that's life.

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.650
I think that's not a bad
assumption.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:34.771
Every hedge fund guy I've ever
talked to who thought that this

00:51:34.771 --> 00:51:37.894
was a low probability event also
thought we were going to come

00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:40.250
out of it and things wouldn't be
that bad.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.179
So I'm not saying that these
people don't learn.

00:51:43.179 --> 00:51:44.130
Everybody learns.
 

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:46.210
When they see the first piece
of bad news they're more

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:46.760
pessimistic.
 

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:51.119
You go from 1.69 percent to 13
percent.

00:51:51.119 --> 00:51:52.570
So it's not like people aren't
learning.

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:55.168
They are learning,
but relative to the rest of the

00:51:55.168 --> 00:51:58.349
population if you started
optimistic you stay optimistic,

00:51:58.349 --> 00:52:01.278
and that's why there's only a
small group of Warren Buffetts

00:52:01.278 --> 00:52:02.719
who can save the situation.
 

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:06.608
So that's my model of the
leverage cycle,

00:52:06.608 --> 00:52:08.360
of what happens.
 

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.795
Three bad things happen,
bad news, can't do anything

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:16.039
about that, the leveraged buyers
get crushed, go out of business

00:52:16.039 --> 00:52:17.860
and leverage collapses.
 

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:20.637
And when the prices are really
low the whole economy is

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:23.570
suffering tremendously and
innocent people who had nothing

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:26.456
to do with all these markets,
the price of everything,

00:52:26.456 --> 00:52:28.400
every asset is low so they
can't borrow.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.309
They can't get loans.
 

00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:30.989
Margins are so tough.
 

00:52:30.989 --> 00:52:31.730
They're small businesses.
 

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:32.449
They can't borrow.
 

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:36.467
They're totally crushed down
here, so how would we save the

00:52:36.467 --> 00:52:37.159
economy?
 

00:52:37.159 --> 00:52:40.510
We'd undo the three things that
happened.

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:43.913
We can't undo the bad news,
but the three things that

00:52:43.913 --> 00:52:46.268
happened were uncertainty went
up.

00:52:46.268 --> 00:52:48.869
It wasn't just bad news,
it was scary bad news.

00:52:48.869 --> 00:52:53.179
So this gap between 1 and .2 is
much bigger than that gap.

00:52:53.179 --> 00:52:54.869
That's why the leverage went
down.

00:52:54.869 --> 00:52:56.320
Volatility went up.
 

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.150
So you have to contain the bad
news.

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:00.670
That would help.
 

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:03.090
You have to contain the bad
news, that's A.

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:06.226
So you can't eliminate the bad
news, but you can contain the

00:53:06.226 --> 00:53:07.768
volatility of the bad news.
 

00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:09.905
Secondly you have to increase
the leverage,

00:53:09.905 --> 00:53:12.907
and thirdly you have to make up
for the people who've gotten

00:53:12.907 --> 00:53:13.619
destroyed.
 

00:53:13.619 --> 00:53:15.719
The buying power is gone.
 

00:53:15.719 --> 00:53:18.550
Somehow the government has to
replace that temporarily.

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:21.141
So those are the three things
we should be doing now,

00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:24.081
and in the long run we should
never have let leverage get so

00:53:24.081 --> 00:53:24.929
high up here.
 

00:53:24.929 --> 00:53:26.626
That's what made the price so
high up here,

00:53:26.626 --> 00:53:29.009
and that's why everyone got
wiped out down here because they

00:53:29.009 --> 00:53:30.099
were borrowing so much.
 

00:53:30.099 --> 00:53:31.630
We should never have let that
happen.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:35.275
So if we regulate the economy
not to let leverage get so high

00:53:35.275 --> 00:53:38.389
we won't have such a crash,
but if we do have a crash the

00:53:38.389 --> 00:53:40.878
way to deal with it is to undo
the three things that went

00:53:40.878 --> 00:53:41.280
wrong.
 

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.380
That's the sort of story that
I've been telling.

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:45.059
Yes?
 

00:53:45.059 --> 00:53:47.240
Student: Do you have a
theory for what the right amount

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:47.849
of leverage is?
 

00:53:47.849 --> 00:53:51.880
Prof: That's a wonderful
question, and of course I've

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.590
been asked that before.
 

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:56.530
So let me put it in several
different ways.

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.050
Let's take the most
hypercritical way.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:03.103
I presented this theory,
remember, starting in 2000,

00:54:03.103 --> 00:54:05.170
so way before the crash.
 

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:07.500
And so people would say then,
"Oh,

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.958
very nice, very cute,
but first all there's not going

00:54:09.958 --> 00:54:12.655
to be a crash and secondly how
could we ever know what the

00:54:12.655 --> 00:54:14.170
right amount of leverage is.
 

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:18.289
It's an impossible pie in the
sky goal to regulate leverage.

00:54:18.289 --> 00:54:21.135
Well, you see,
that's why--I say it's

00:54:21.135 --> 00:54:24.851
difficult, I agree,
but we've already faced this

00:54:24.851 --> 00:54:25.800
problem.
 

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.099
We regulate the interest rate.
 

00:54:27.099 --> 00:54:30.108
How does the Fed know that the
interest rate's too low or too

00:54:30.108 --> 00:54:30.460
high?
 

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.246
What the Fed does is it
monitors a bunch of stuff and

00:54:33.246 --> 00:54:35.230
realizes the economy is
overheated.

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:36.480
Things are changing.
 

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.115
Suddenly output is going way up
and inflation is starting to go

00:54:41.115 --> 00:54:41.489
up.
 

00:54:41.489 --> 00:54:43.132
Then the Fed raises the
interest rate,

00:54:43.132 --> 00:54:45.621
or maybe people are being
thrown out of work then the Fed

00:54:45.621 --> 00:54:46.909
lowers the interest rate.
 

00:54:46.909 --> 00:54:48.960
So something changes in the
economy.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.070
They don't know so precisely
what to do,

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:54.755
but something's changed that
gives them a clue about which

00:54:54.755 --> 00:54:57.704
way to move interest rates,
and over the course of 80

00:54:57.704 --> 00:55:00.039
years, I guess since the
Depression,

00:55:00.039 --> 00:55:03.163
since it was created,
over 70 or 80 years since then

00:55:03.163 --> 00:55:06.960
they've gotten better and better
at regulating the interest.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:13.429
So I put this picture up for a
reason last class.

00:55:13.429 --> 00:55:17.757
You remember the picture,
which I'm going to get to now,

00:55:17.757 --> 00:55:20.039
of the history of leverage.
 

00:55:20.039 --> 00:55:22.713
So here's the history of
leverage, the purple,

00:55:22.713 --> 00:55:24.139
in the housing market.
 

00:55:24.139 --> 00:55:27.681
And then the blue is the
history of leverage,

00:55:27.681 --> 00:55:30.579
it's the loan to value,
basically.

00:55:30.579 --> 00:55:34.920
I put money down starting from
the top and going down.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.159
So from the bottom it's loan to
value.

00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:41.253
So I've got the history of loan
to value in the securities

00:55:41.253 --> 00:55:43.840
market and in the mortgage
market.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.351
Now, I think that the Fed
should be monitoring this,

00:55:46.351 --> 00:55:48.123
and not only should be
monitoring it,

00:55:48.123 --> 00:55:51.079
should be making it as public
as the interest rates are.

00:55:51.079 --> 00:55:55.222
So how come I had to present
Ellington's data on observations

00:55:55.222 --> 00:55:59.130
it made in the market,
because Ellington seems to have

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:03.139
been the only company in the
county that kept this data.

00:56:03.139 --> 00:56:05.536
Nobody else seemed to recognize
how important it was,

00:56:05.536 --> 00:56:06.320
and we kept it.
 

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.559
So the Fed doesn't have these
numbers going back.

00:56:09.559 --> 00:56:12.768
If it did it would have seen
that leverage had suddenly

00:56:12.768 --> 00:56:16.275
jumped up here and that leverage
was much higher than it was

00:56:16.275 --> 00:56:18.077
before,
and it would see if it

00:56:18.077 --> 00:56:20.898
monitored leverage in the
housing market that leverage was

00:56:20.898 --> 00:56:21.690
skyrocketing.
 

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:23.670
Of course everybody knew this,
they just didn't think it was

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.079
an important thing to pay
attention to,

00:56:25.079 --> 00:56:27.206
but if they were paying
attention to it and keeping

00:56:27.206 --> 00:56:29.242
these numbers,
we had to do this at Ellington

00:56:29.242 --> 00:56:31.958
by going house by house through
every house looking at what the

00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:33.710
leverage was and taking the
average,

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:35.753
if they had done that,
I mean they could have done

00:56:35.753 --> 00:56:38.054
that easily,
and if they did do that,

00:56:38.054 --> 00:56:41.951
and if they were publishing it,
and every economist was aware

00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:44.860
of it I think things would have
been very different.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:49.130
They would have said we ought
to tighten leverage.

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:51.230
Exactly how much should we
tighten it?

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:53.987
Well, they would have said,
"I don't know exactly,

00:56:53.987 --> 00:56:56.795
but we would have forced banks
not to allow loans with 3

00:56:56.795 --> 00:56:57.969
percent down."
 

00:56:57.969 --> 00:57:00.436
Should it be 10 percent,
or 15 percent,

00:57:00.436 --> 00:57:01.409
or 8 percent?
 

00:57:01.409 --> 00:57:03.820
It's a little hard to say what
exactly the right number is,

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.974
but we would have picked a
number higher than 3 percent and

00:57:06.974 --> 00:57:09.150
we would have avoided a huge
problem,

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:12.405
and in later years we'll get
better and better at picking

00:57:12.405 --> 00:57:13.219
that number.
 

00:57:13.219 --> 00:57:17.059
So I'm trying to answer your
question.

00:57:17.059 --> 00:57:19.840
So in the securities market
another thing you could do,

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.829
another trick you could do is
you could say we'll pass a rule

00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:26.576
that says you can't--
here leverage is going down,

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:26.880
right?
 

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.820
They're asking for more and
more margins.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:34.045
You could pass a rule that says
you can't double your margins

00:57:34.045 --> 00:57:37.880
from 10 percent to 20 percent or
20 to 40.

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:42.092
You can't double them in under
four months, say,

00:57:42.092 --> 00:57:45.679
on average across some security
class.

00:57:45.679 --> 00:57:49.731
You can't double them in less
than four months or less than

00:57:49.731 --> 00:57:50.639
six months.
 

00:57:50.639 --> 00:57:54.768
So that would have kept
leverage from collapsing so

00:57:54.768 --> 00:57:57.159
fast,
and then lenders knowing that

00:57:57.159 --> 00:58:00.237
when the crisis was starting,
you know, they're making one

00:58:00.237 --> 00:58:00.719
day loans.
 

00:58:00.719 --> 00:58:01.619
See, they always think.
 

00:58:01.619 --> 00:58:04.577
"Well, it's a one day loan
and things start to look dicey

00:58:04.577 --> 00:58:07.389
I'll just demand a huge amount
of leverage the next day.

00:58:07.389 --> 00:58:09.695
I'll get my money back tomorrow
and then the day after tomorrow

00:58:09.695 --> 00:58:11.110
I'm not going to make the same
loan.

00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:12.820
I'll ask for a lot more
margin."

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.623
So I'm saying,
suppose you tell them in

00:58:14.623 --> 00:58:17.375
advance you have to keep making
the same loan and you can't

00:58:17.375 --> 00:58:18.420
double the margin?
 

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.748
You can increase it but you
have to take at least six months

00:58:20.748 --> 00:58:21.340
to double it.
 

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:24.206
Well, they'll know in advance
that they're not going to be

00:58:24.206 --> 00:58:26.320
able to react very quickly to
problems,

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.407
and so in advance they'll ask
for more margin down so they

00:58:29.407 --> 00:58:32.873
won't have to double to get to a
safe level when something starts

00:58:32.873 --> 00:58:35.420
happening because they'll
already be safer.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.760
So that's a way of not having
to actually know what the right

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.047
number is by just slowing down
their response and relying on

00:58:42.047 --> 00:58:44.998
them to anticipate how bad
things might be and they're

00:58:44.998 --> 00:58:47.840
already starting to respond at
the beginning.

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.429
So I'm not saying I've got
exactly the right formula,

00:58:50.429 --> 00:58:52.775
but you see I think if you
think about it and start to work

00:58:52.775 --> 00:58:54.434
on this,
and most importantly you make

00:58:54.434 --> 00:58:56.813
these numbers public,
you're going to change the way

00:58:56.813 --> 00:59:00.179
everybody,
you know, rules will develop.

00:59:00.179 --> 00:59:02.018
Yeah?
 

00:59:02.018 --> 00:59:04.072
Student: To sort of
connect to that,

00:59:04.072 --> 00:59:07.052
so are they going to set like
one leverage rate or is it going

00:59:07.052 --> 00:59:08.518
to be like for each class?
 

00:59:08.518 --> 00:59:10.335
Prof: Yes,
each class of security will

00:59:10.335 --> 00:59:11.489
have a different leverage.
 

00:59:11.489 --> 00:59:14.663
Student: When you say
class of security like do you

00:59:14.663 --> 00:59:16.000
mean like different...
 

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.150
Prof: Well,
the government already makes a

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:22.820
lot of loans through Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac,

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.670
but Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
will have to ask for at least 20

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:26.360
percent down.
 

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.800
Prime securities,
prime mortgages will have to

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.349
have at least this much amount
of money down.

00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:33.614
So, on the housing market
you'll have to have a certain

00:59:33.614 --> 00:59:34.579
amount of money down.
 

00:59:34.579 --> 00:59:38.280
On Treasuries you can have a
very high leverage.

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.119
On mortgages,
plain simple mortgages,

00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:45.773
you can have not quite as high
a leverage, but a pretty high

00:59:45.773 --> 00:59:46.800
leverage.
 

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.949
On mortgage derivatives,
which are much more

00:59:48.949 --> 00:59:51.349
complicated, the leverage has to
be much less.

00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:54.590
So you might say there'll be
some rule that says--

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:59.780
so anyway those are the kinds
of classes that I have in mind,

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.510
and we have to work out exactly
how they're going to be

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:04.340
regulated.
 

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.630
So it's a little bit
complicated.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.090
So let me answer your question
in two parts.

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.820
Yes, it has to depend on the
kind of security,

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.034
and b) even trying to answer
your question I'm revealing that

01:00:13.034 --> 01:00:16.679
it's not so obvious exactly what
the formula is and how to do it,

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:18.429
but this has to be worked out.
 

01:00:18.429 --> 01:00:19.230
Yep?
 

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:22.106
Student: Is this some
kind of like Phillips curve

01:00:22.106 --> 01:00:25.141
relationship here that you could
make between the amount of

01:00:25.141 --> 01:00:28.280
leverage and unemployment that
kind of it's all the same like

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.000
Phillips curve like other
occasions that end up being

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.570
awful also or is it...
 

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:33.289
Prof: Yes, yes.
 

01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:36.773
I think that's the whole point
of the crisis that the things

01:00:36.773 --> 01:00:38.250
feedback on each other.
 

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.090
The feedback is the most
important thing.

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:43.469
So in the crisis let's take any
one of these.

01:00:43.469 --> 01:00:48.001
When leverage starts to go down
that makes the prices start to

01:00:48.001 --> 01:00:50.007
go down,
but when the prices start to go

01:00:50.007 --> 01:00:52.309
down people get more worried
that things are going to go down

01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:53.646
further,
I mean, they have good reason

01:00:53.646 --> 01:00:55.264
to worry,
and so the leverage goes down

01:00:55.264 --> 01:00:57.170
more which makes the prices go
down more,

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:59.018
and so they feed back on each
other.

01:00:59.018 --> 01:01:04.679
So definitely it's a spiral of
one thing affecting the other.

01:01:04.679 --> 01:01:06.739
And of course,
the more the prices are going

01:01:06.739 --> 01:01:09.471
down the more the optimists are
losing money and your best

01:01:09.471 --> 01:01:12.018
buyers are getting wiped out,
and that's a third thing.

01:01:12.018 --> 01:01:15.159
Those three things are always
feeding back on each other.

01:01:15.159 --> 01:01:16.780
Student: Is there a
Lucas like critique,

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.523
though, of saying that people
should be able to expect this

01:01:19.523 --> 01:01:21.889
coming forward and they should
account for that?

01:01:21.889 --> 01:01:23.472
Prof: No,
because the model was totally

01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:23.860
rational.
 

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.869
Every person did expect all
this.

01:01:25.869 --> 01:01:28.650
Everyone anticipated perfectly
what would happen.

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:35.594
So Lucas critique is people
should realize the environment

01:01:35.594 --> 01:01:39.159
they're in,
but here in this environment

01:01:39.159 --> 01:01:43.148
everybody up here understood
from the very beginning that the

01:01:43.148 --> 01:01:45.739
prices were going to go down to
.69.

01:01:45.739 --> 01:01:49.623
They realized that there was
going to be this acceleration of

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.728
problems,
and so they all anticipated it,

01:01:51.728 --> 01:01:54.217
but still they wanted to buy
because they didn't think they

01:01:54.217 --> 01:01:55.590
were going to get down there.
 

01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:57.360
They thought they were going to
go up here.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.264
So remember,
I don't know if I have it in

01:02:02.264 --> 01:02:09.865
this slide, but one of my most
amazing pictures was this one of

01:02:09.865 --> 01:02:13.789
what happened to the market.
 

01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:14.820
Open.
 

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.797
So what happened to the market
here, which I think I showed you

01:02:17.797 --> 01:02:19.286
last time, I mean,
I know I did,

01:02:19.286 --> 01:02:21.159
but I'll just show it to you
again.

01:02:21.159 --> 01:02:24.170
Now with this new perspective
you can look at it.

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:36.268
Presents, so this is Jerusalem,
I gave this talk in Jerusalem.

01:02:36.268 --> 01:02:48.960
Second talk,
so you remember this picture?

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.530
I hope it was in this slide.
 

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.059
Yes, it was here.
 

01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:52.639
Here.
 

01:02:52.639 --> 01:02:54.489
Remember what happened in the
world?

01:02:54.489 --> 01:02:58.070
It was shocking how bad and how
fast it was.

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:04.760
So in 2007, beginning of 2007,
right, we're not far from the

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.030
beginning of 2007.
 

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:11.452
That's three years ago people
were expecting 40 percent losses

01:03:11.452 --> 01:03:13.409
for these lower tranches.
 

01:03:13.409 --> 01:03:16.530
So how could you get such an
astronomical loss?

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:17.840
What was happening?
 

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.018
They were already anticipating
this spiral.

01:03:21.018 --> 01:03:24.039
If you looked at just what
housing prices were there,

01:03:24.039 --> 01:03:27.090
and you say 30 percent guys
being thrown out,

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:29.639
and housing prices are down 4
percent,

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:32.507
that's hardly any loss at all,
because if you get 96 percent

01:03:32.507 --> 01:03:35.617
back on the house and you have a
few expenses and only 30 percent

01:03:35.617 --> 01:03:38.510
are defaulting,
there was hardly anybody

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:39.469
defaulting.
 

01:03:39.469 --> 01:03:42.041
Remember that curve we showed
where there weren't almost any

01:03:42.041 --> 01:03:43.829
losses and no one going
delinquent yet?

01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:46.266
They already anticipated that
there were going to be lots of

01:03:46.266 --> 01:03:48.621
people thrown out of their
houses and when they got thrown

01:03:48.621 --> 01:03:51.349
out of their houses the housing
prices were going to collapse.

01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:54.331
So this market was collapsing
already because people were

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:57.204
anticipating a lot of the
feedbacks and stuff that were

01:03:57.204 --> 01:03:58.590
going to happen later.
 

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:01.143
They didn't just extrapolate
the number of defaults,

01:04:01.143 --> 01:04:03.947
they also had to extrapolate
the housing prices and stuff

01:04:03.947 --> 01:04:04.699
going down.
 

01:04:04.699 --> 01:04:11.675
And so in this model everybody
is doing that complicated

01:04:11.675 --> 01:04:17.889
extrapolation and they're
figuring it all out,

01:04:17.889 --> 01:04:20.382
but even so they still want to
put themselves in the cycle

01:04:20.382 --> 01:04:22.920
because they still think they
have a profit opportunity.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.929
They can't stop themselves from
investing.

01:04:24.929 --> 01:04:26.530
That's why you need regulation.
 

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:27.710
It's like a prisoner's dilemma.
 

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:29.219
Everybody knows what the danger
is,

01:04:29.219 --> 01:04:32.036
they still want to do it and
the only way to stop them from

01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:33.943
doing it,
you can't lecture them about

01:04:33.943 --> 01:04:36.184
irrational exuberance,
they know what's going to

01:04:36.184 --> 01:04:37.820
happen and they still want to do
it.

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.690
They don't think that's going
to happen.

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.730
They know what could happen and
they still want to do it.

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:45.989
Now, I think in reality Shiller
is partly right.

01:04:45.989 --> 01:04:48.782
I think that people didn't
really realize how bad it could

01:04:48.782 --> 01:04:49.469
have gotten.
 

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:51.170
My own hedge fund lost money.
 

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:54.313
We didn't anticipate how bad it
was because so many things went

01:04:54.313 --> 01:04:54.719
wrong.
 

01:04:54.719 --> 01:04:57.090
We just underestimated all the
feedbacks.

01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:59.813
So there is the spiral and
there were just more things

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.559
going wrong than we anticipated.
 

01:05:01.559 --> 01:05:04.050
So I wouldn't stick 100 percent
to my story.

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:06.913
I think there's something to
what Shiller says,

01:05:06.913 --> 01:05:10.710
but I wouldn't definitely stick
to 100 percent of his story of

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:13.139
it being all irrational
exuberance.

01:05:13.139 --> 01:05:15.250
Any other questions?
 

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:19.492
Now that we have five minutes
left for--so I'm willing to keep

01:05:19.492 --> 01:05:20.050
going.
 

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:21.929
So let's just pause.
 

01:05:21.929 --> 01:05:25.617
Any more questions on this
story of the crisis or anything

01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:28.659
else about the crisis you want
to ask, or...?

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:29.340
Yeah?
 

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:33.030
Student: How receptive
are the regulators to this idea?

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.340
Prof: Well,
that's a good question.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:42.219
I talk to them now all the time
whereas I never did before.

01:05:42.219 --> 01:05:45.110
So I'm meeting Dudley tomorrow.
 

01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:46.869
He's the head of the New York
Fed.

01:05:46.869 --> 01:05:52.059
So I go there quite frequently
like once a month now.

01:05:52.059 --> 01:05:53.829
I'm on some panels.
 

01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:55.510
There are other academics going
too.

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:59.085
So I didn't do that before,
so clearly they are paying

01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:00.300
attention to it.
 

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:04.583
I think there are other people
saying that leverage is

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:07.980
important, Soros,
being a famous hedge fund

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.840
person who says it.
 

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.405
There are other people saying
that you should reduce

01:06:12.405 --> 01:06:13.010
principal.
 

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:15.358
Remember, I said that the way
to solve the housing foreclosure

01:06:15.358 --> 01:06:16.590
problem is reducing principal.
 

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:19.219
They're now holding hearings in
Congress.

01:06:19.219 --> 01:06:23.038
I could have gone Tuesday to
testify, but I have already

01:06:23.038 --> 01:06:26.579
testified, but they're having
other hearings now.

01:06:26.579 --> 01:06:30.110
I didn't go because I was
teaching, but there were a lot

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:33.061
of people who went,
and a lot of people said we

01:06:33.061 --> 01:06:34.860
should reduce principal.
 

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.405
And a year ago when I was
saying that hardly anyone else

01:06:37.405 --> 01:06:39.302
was saying it,
although there were others,

01:06:39.302 --> 01:06:40.090
but very few.
 

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:42.735
The people at my hedge fund,
we all pretty much see eye to

01:06:42.735 --> 01:06:45.429
eye on this and some other hedge
funds were saying that.

01:06:45.429 --> 01:06:48.036
But now, I think,
there's a growing consensus

01:06:48.036 --> 01:06:50.110
that we have to reduce
principal.

01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:51.070
What does that do?
 

01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:54.614
It makes the loan smaller
relative to the value of the

01:06:54.614 --> 01:06:55.150
house.
 

01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:57.693
In other words,
it reduces the leverage of

01:06:57.693 --> 01:06:58.500
homeowners.
 

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:04.730
So we have to get back to a
credible level of leverage.

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:08.347
So the bad news is that
although they're very receptive

01:07:08.347 --> 01:07:12.501
and although they're listening
carefully and they keep inviting

01:07:12.501 --> 01:07:15.985
me to speak I don't see much
signs that they're doing

01:07:15.985 --> 01:07:16.989
anything.
 

01:07:16.989 --> 01:07:19.552
And the one thing that they
should have done by now is

01:07:19.552 --> 01:07:20.809
collected all this data.
 

01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:23.699
So they should have gone to all
the big lenders and said,

01:07:23.699 --> 01:07:25.978
the Fed should have,
and said, "This is the

01:07:25.978 --> 01:07:28.789
margins we're charging on all
our different securities,

01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:31.643
here they are,"
and then the Fed would be able

01:07:31.643 --> 01:07:34.500
to monitor how much they were
going up and down.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.324
Now, a bunch of these lenders
themselves have also become

01:07:37.324 --> 01:07:40.349
excited about what I'm doing,
and they're starting to publish

01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:41.409
reports about it.
 

01:07:41.409 --> 01:07:44.429
So one, Credit Suisse,
for example,

01:07:44.429 --> 01:07:48.405
their research department now
thinks that a better measure of

01:07:48.405 --> 01:07:51.719
money is not just M1 and M2 and
all that stuff,

01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:55.760
but how many leveraged loans
are made in the Repo market,

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.260
and they add that to the money
supply,

01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.733
and they think that gives them
a much better picture of the

01:07:59.733 --> 01:08:00.159
economy.
 

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.518
So it's all sort of based on
these ideas and I think I got

01:08:02.518 --> 01:08:04.628
them interested in it,
or was one of the people that

01:08:04.628 --> 01:08:05.869
got them interested in it.
 

01:08:05.869 --> 01:08:08.648
But they aren't going to
publish their leverage numbers

01:08:08.648 --> 01:08:11.427
unless everybody else does
because why should they give

01:08:11.427 --> 01:08:12.920
away private information?
 

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.393
Why should they say,
"We're lending to

01:08:15.393 --> 01:08:18.751
Ellington on slightly less
generous or more generous terms

01:08:18.751 --> 01:08:21.520
than we're lending to some other
guy."

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.780
One of the two of us is going
to feel bad about it,

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:25.500
and so they're not going to do
that.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.155
And so the government is the
only one that can get the

01:08:28.155 --> 01:08:29.460
information out of them.
 

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.828
And the government shouldn't
say who are they lending to

01:08:31.828 --> 01:08:33.765
person by person,
they should give the average

01:08:33.765 --> 01:08:34.238
number.
 

01:08:34.238 --> 01:08:36.328
This is the average margin
they're charging people,

01:08:36.328 --> 01:08:39.930
the average number the banks in
general are charging people then

01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:42.789
you won't be revealing any
private information,

01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:44.300
giving away any secrets.
 

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:47.905
So that's the worst news that
they're not collecting the data

01:08:47.905 --> 01:08:49.770
yet, and it's shocking to me.
 

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:52.391
So I'm going to yell at Dudley
about that again Friday,

01:08:52.391 --> 01:08:54.966
but I've done it before,
so hopefully they're going to

01:08:54.966 --> 01:08:55.550
do that.
 

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.527
They say they're going to do
that, so I believe they'll do

01:08:57.527 --> 01:08:57.770
that.
 

01:08:57.770 --> 01:09:00.155
And I believe that once they
have all these numbers they're

01:09:00.155 --> 01:09:01.720
going to start to think
differently.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.868
So there are all these
initiatives in Congress,

01:09:06.868 --> 01:09:09.252
and in the Fed,
and in the Treasury to try and

01:09:09.252 --> 01:09:11.529
monitor leverage and try to
regulate it,

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:15.302
but every time they get down to
actually doing something they

01:09:15.302 --> 01:09:18.597
ask questions like you did,
what exactly should the rule

01:09:18.597 --> 01:09:21.715
be, and they seem paralyzed by
not being able to figure out the

01:09:21.715 --> 01:09:22.420
exact rule.
 

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:25.247
But I think that's an
unnecessary paralysis because we

01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:28.449
don't have to have to the final
rule to start doing stuff.

01:09:28.449 --> 01:09:28.939
Yes?
 

01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:29.698
Student: I've got one
more question.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.380
How and who do you think should
be doing this?

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.039
Prof: The Fed.
 

01:09:33.039 --> 01:09:34.408
The Fed has the power to do it.
 

01:09:34.408 --> 01:09:37.706
The Fed already regulates
margins on stocks,

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.319
right?
 

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:40.320
They set the margin at 50
percent or something,

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.844
and so they could change that
and they have changed that in

01:09:42.844 --> 01:09:43.408
the past.
 

01:09:43.408 --> 01:09:47.060
So the Fed has the authority to
do that.

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.510
The Fed did that after 9/11.
 

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:52.210
They called everybody up and
said, right after 9/11,

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:54.976
and said, "You cannot
change your margins,"

01:09:54.976 --> 01:09:56.840
and nobody changed their
margins.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.510
I mean if ever there was a day
when people were nervous and

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.720
wanted to have a higher margin
it was on 9/12.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.939
Nobody changed their margins.
 

01:10:03.939 --> 01:10:10.461
So they've done it before,
but that's a pretty extreme

01:10:10.461 --> 01:10:11.199
day.
 

01:10:11.199 --> 01:10:16.000

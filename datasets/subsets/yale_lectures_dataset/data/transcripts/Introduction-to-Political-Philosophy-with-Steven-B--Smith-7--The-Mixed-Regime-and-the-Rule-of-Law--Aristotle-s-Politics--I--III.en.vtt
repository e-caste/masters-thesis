00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.294
Professor Steven Smith:
I've always been told that any

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:10.123
serious introduction to
political philosophy has to

00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:16.635
start with a big piece of Plato.
We've made some effort to do

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:21.770
that.
Now, we have to move on.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.246
So we move to Plato's son,
his adopted son,

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:28.310
in a manner of speaking,
Aristotle.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.310
There's a story about the life
of Aristotle.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.720
It goes something like this.
Aristotle was born.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.080
He spent his life thinking and
then he died.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.980
There is, obviously,
more to his life than that.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.269
But, to some degree,
this captures some of the way

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.229
in which Aristotle has been
perceived over the centuries.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.659
That is to say,
the ultimate philosopher.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:12.920
Aristotle was born in the year
384,15 years after the trial of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.106
Socrates.
He was born in the northern

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:18.620
part of Greece,
in a city called Stagira,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.700
which is part of what is now
called Macedonia.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.030
It was called that then.
When he was about your age,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.286
when he was 17 or thereabouts,
maybe slightly younger than

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:37.736
many of you,
he was sent by his father to do

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:42.183
what you are doing.
He was sent by his father to go

00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:45.776
to college.
He was sent to Athens to study

00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:49.240
at The Academy,
the first university,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.090
spoke about and established by
Plato.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.105
Unlike most of you,
Aristotle did not spend four

00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:03.553
years at the Platonic Academy.
He remained attached to it for

00:02:03.553 --> 00:02:08.379
the next 20, until the death of
Plato.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.877
After the death of Plato,
perhaps because of the choice

00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:17.610
of successors to The Academy,
Aristotle left Athens,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.792
first for Asia Minor and then
to return to his home in

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:28.071
Macedonia where he had been
summoned by King Phillip to

00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:33.154
establish a school for the
children of the Macedonian

00:02:33.154 --> 00:02:38.201
ruling class.
It was here that Aristotle met

00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:43.597
and taught Phillip's son.
Who was Phillip of Macedonia's

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:44.440
son?
Student: Alexander.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.539
Professor Steven Smith:
Alexander.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.886
You all remember the recent
movie of a year or two ago about

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:52.979
Troy with Colin Farrell about
Alexander.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.400
Who played Aristotle in that
film, do you remember?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.522
Student: Anthony Hopkins.
Professor Steven Smith:

00:02:58.522 --> 00:03:00.140
Anthony Hopkins,
excellent.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.115
Was it Anthony Hopkins?
I have in my notes here it was

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:09.909
Christopher Plummer.
I'll have to check.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.810
I'll have to Google that when I
go home.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.775
Maybe you're right.
I have a feeling it was Anthony

00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:16.740
Hopkins.
Whoever, he was an excellent

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.720
Aristotle, didn't have a large
enough part in the film.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.391
In any case,
Aristotle returned to Athens

00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:27.429
later on and established a
school of his own,

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:33.120
a rival to the Platonic Academy
that he called the Lyceum.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.611
There is a story that near the
end of his life,

00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:40.710
Aristotle was himself brought
up on capital charges,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.325
as was Socrates,
due to another wave of

00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:49.055
hostility to philosophy.
But rather unlike Socrates,

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:54.067
rather in staying to drink the
hemlock, Aristotle left Athens

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:58.662
and was reported to have said he
did not wish to see the

00:03:58.662 --> 00:04:03.340
Athenians sin against philosophy
for a second time.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.803
I'll go back to that story in a
minute, because I think it's

00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:11.210
very revealing about Aristotle.
In any way, this story helps to

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.513
underscore some important
differences between Plato and

00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:17.342
Aristotle.
At one level,

00:04:17.342 --> 00:04:20.632
you might say there is an
important difference in style

00:04:20.632 --> 00:04:23.069
that you will see almost
immediately.

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.954
Unlike his intellectual
godfather, Socrates,

00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:30.930
who wrote nothing but conversed
endlessly,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.747
and unlike his own teacher,
Plato, who wrote imitations of

00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:37.360
those endless Socratic
conversations,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.915
Aristotle wrote disciplined and
thematic treatises on virtually

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:46.851
every topic,
from biology to ethics to

00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:52.000
metaphysics to literary
criticism and politics.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.356
One can assume safely that
Aristotle would have received

00:04:56.356 --> 00:05:00.000
tenure in any number of
departments at Yale,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.320
whereas Socrates could not have
applied to have been a teaching

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.751
assistant.
These differences conceal

00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:12.727
others.
For Plato, it would seem,

00:05:12.727 --> 00:05:16.653
the study of politics was
always bound up with deeply

00:05:16.653 --> 00:05:19.899
philosophical and speculative
questions,

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.437
questions of metaphysics,
questions of the structure of

00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:26.940
the cosmos.
What is the soul?

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.978
What is the soul about?
Aristotle appears from the

00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:36.010
beginning to look more like what
we would think of as a political

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.421
scientist.
He collected constitutions,

00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:43.836
158 of them in all,
from throughout the ancient

00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:46.981
world.
He was the first to give some

00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:51.860
kind of conceptual rigor to the
vocabulary of political life.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.030
Above all, Aristotle's works,
like the Politics and

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.108
the Nicomachean Ethics,
were explicitly intended as

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:03.620
works of political instruction,
political education.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.680
They seem to be designed less
to recruit philosophers and

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.102
potential philosophers than to
shape and educate citizens and

00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:18.754
future statesmen.
His works seem less theoretical

00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:23.730
in the sense of constructing
abstract models of political

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.904
life than advice-giving,
in the sense of serving as a

00:06:28.904 --> 00:06:33.759
sort of civic-minded arbiter of
public disputes.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.642
Unlike Socrates,
who famously in his image in

00:06:36.642 --> 00:06:40.773
Book VII of the Republic,
compared political life to a

00:06:40.773 --> 00:06:44.103
cave, and unlike the
Apology where Socrates

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:47.230
tells his fellow citizens that
their lives,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.437
because unexamined,
are not worth living,

00:06:50.437 --> 00:06:55.167
Aristotle takes seriously the
dignity of the city and showed

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:59.497
the way that philosophy might be
useful to citizens and

00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:00.780
statesmen.

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:07.745
Yet, for all of this,
one might say there is still a

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:12.050
profound enigma surrounding
Aristotle's political works.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.063
To put it simply,
one could simply ask,

00:07:21.063 --> 00:07:26.610
what were the politics of
Aristotle's Politics?

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.089
What were Aristotle's own
political beliefs?

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:35.820
Aristotle lived at the virtual
cusp of the world of the

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.199
autonomous city-state of the
Greek polis.

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:45.207
Within his own lifetime,
Aristotle would see Athens,

00:07:45.207 --> 00:07:51.001
Sparta, and the other great
cities of Greece swallowed up by

00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:55.420
the great Macedonian Empire to
the north.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.084
What we think of as the golden
age of Greece was virtually at

00:08:00.084 --> 00:08:03.350
an end during the lifetime of
Aristotle.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.225
Other Greek thinkers of his
time, notably a man named

00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:10.580
Demosthenes, wrote a series of
speeches called

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.465
Philippics,
anti-Phillip,

00:08:13.465 --> 00:08:18.832
to the north to warn his
contemporaries about the dangers

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:24.389
posed to Athens from the
imperial ambitions of Macedon.

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:28.019
But Phillip's warnings came too
late.

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:32.457
Again, the autonomous Greek
polis that Plato and

00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:37.799
Glaucon, Adeimantus and others
would have known came to an end.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.380
What did Aristotle think of
these changes?

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.490
What did he think was going on?
He is silent.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:55.970
Aristotle's extreme reluctance,
his hesitance to speak to the

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.867
issues of his time,
are perhaps the result of his

00:09:00.867 --> 00:09:06.370
foreignness to Athens.
He was not an Athenian.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.947
Therefore, he lacked the
protection of Athenian

00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:13.676
citizenship.
At the same time,

00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:18.391
you might think his reticence,
his reluctance to speak in his

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:23.264
own voice may have also been a
response to the fate of Socrates

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:27.980
and the politically endangered
situation of philosophy.

00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:37.177
Yet, for a man as notoriously
secretive and reluctant as

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:43.214
Aristotle, his works acquired
over the centuries virtual

00:09:43.214 --> 00:09:47.811
canonical status.
He became an authority,

00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:52.395
really one could say the
authority on virtually

00:09:52.395 --> 00:09:55.527
everything.
For Thomas Aquinas,

00:09:55.527 --> 00:10:00.831
who wrote in the thirteenth
century, Aristotle was referred

00:10:00.831 --> 00:10:05.129
to, by Aquinas,
simply as "the philosopher."

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:08.120
There was no reason even to say
his name.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:14.370
He was simply The Philosopher.
For the great Jewish medieval

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:21.347
philosopher, Moses Maimonides,
Aristotle was called by him

00:10:21.347 --> 00:10:26.773
"the Master of those who know."
Think of that,

00:10:26.773 --> 00:10:30.618
"the master of those who know."
For centuries,

00:10:30.618 --> 00:10:34.660
Aristotle's authority seemed to
go virtually unchallenged.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:45.925
Are you with me?
Yet, the authority of Aristotle

00:10:45.925 --> 00:10:51.659
obviously no longer has quite
the power that it once did.

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:58.019
The attack began not all that
long ago, really only as late as

00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:03.131
the seventeenth century.
A man, who we will read later

00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:05.946
this semester,
named Thomas Hobbes,

00:11:05.946 --> 00:11:09.590
was one who led the pack,
led the charge.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.600
In the forty-sixth chapter of
Leviathan,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.570
a chapter we will read later,
Hobbes wrote,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.548
"I believe that scarce anything
can be more repugnant to

00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:23.381
government than much of what
Aristotle has said in his

00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:27.092
Politics,
nor more ignorantly than a

00:11:27.092 --> 00:11:29.960
great part of his
Ethics."

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.882
Think of that – "nothing more
repugnant to government than

00:11:35.882 --> 00:11:40.600
what Aristotle wrote in his
Politics."

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.320
Naturally, all thinkers,
to some degree,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.600
have read Aristotle through
their own lenses.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.360
Aquinas read Aristotle as a
defender of monarchy.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.697
Dante, in his book,
De Monarchia on

00:11:53.697 --> 00:11:58.418
monarchy, saw Aristotle as
giving credence to the idea of a

00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:02.731
universal monarchy under the
leadership of a Christian

00:12:02.731 --> 00:12:06.008
prince.
But Hobbes saw Aristotle quite

00:12:06.008 --> 00:12:08.837
differently.
For Hobbes, Aristotle taught

00:12:08.837 --> 00:12:12.506
the dangerous doctrine of
republican government that was

00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:15.375
seen to be practiced
particularly during the

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:19.370
Cromwellian Period in England,
during the civil war.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.709
Aristotle's doctrine that man
is a political animal,

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:25.394
Hobbes believed,
could only result and did

00:12:25.394 --> 00:12:27.227
result, in fact,
in regicide,

00:12:27.227 --> 00:12:31.521
the murder of kings.
There are certainly echoes of

00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:36.346
this reading of Aristotle as a
teacher of participatory

00:12:36.346 --> 00:12:41.350
republican government in the
later writings of democratic

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.639
thinkers from Tocqueville to
Hannah Arendt.

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:49.809
Anyway, this returns us to the
enigma of Aristotle.

00:12:49.809 --> 00:12:54.446
Who was this strange and
elusive man whose writings seem

00:12:54.446 --> 00:12:59.589
to have been enlisted both for
the support of monarchy and for

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:03.617
republics,
even for a universal monarchy

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:09.409
and a smaller participatory
democratic kind of government?

00:13:09.409 --> 00:13:13.559
Who was this man and how to
understand his writings?

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:17.108
The best place to start is,
of course, with his views

00:13:17.108 --> 00:13:20.929
stated in the opening pages of
the Politics on the

00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:22.840
naturalness of the city.

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:34.958
His claim that man is,
by nature, the political

00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.120
animal.
That's his famous claim.

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:45.150
What does that mean--we are the
political animal.

00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:54.909
Aristotle states his reasons
succinctly, maybe too

00:13:54.909 --> 00:13:58.475
succinctly.
On the third page of the

00:13:58.475 --> 00:14:03.247
Politics where he remarks
that every city or every

00:14:03.247 --> 00:14:08.109
polis exists by nature,
and he goes on to infer from

00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:12.500
this that man is what he calls
the zoon politikon,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.250
the political animal,
the polis animal.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.501
His reasoning here,
brief as it is,

00:14:19.501 --> 00:14:24.179
is worth following.
Let me just quote him.

00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:28.893
"That man" he says "is much
more a political animal than any

00:14:28.893 --> 00:14:32.010
kind of bee or herd animal is
clear."

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.820
Why is it clear?
"For we assert," he says,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.588
"nature does nothing in vain
and man alone among the animals

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:41.720
has speech.

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:50.158
While other species," he notes,
"may have voice,

00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:56.549
may have sounds and be able to
distinguish pleasure and pain,

00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:59.330
speech"--logos is his
word for it.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.629
Man has logos--reason or
speech.

00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:05.532
The word can mean either.-- "is
more than the ability simply to

00:15:05.532 --> 00:15:08.590
distinguish pleasure and pain."
He goes on.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.444
"But logos," he writes,
"serves to reveal the

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:15.027
advantageous and the harmful.
And hence," he writes,

00:15:15.027 --> 00:15:19.266
"the just and the unjust.
For it is peculiar to man as

00:15:19.266 --> 00:15:23.525
compared to other animals that
he alone has a perception of

00:15:23.525 --> 00:15:26.315
good and bad,
just and unjust and other

00:15:26.315 --> 00:15:28.175
things."
In other words,

00:15:28.175 --> 00:15:31.134
he seems to be saying that it
is speech or reason,

00:15:31.134 --> 00:15:33.718
logos,
that is able to both

00:15:33.718 --> 00:15:37.522
distinguish and create certain
moral categories,

00:15:37.522 --> 00:15:41.893
certain important moral
categories that we live by--the

00:15:41.893 --> 00:15:44.248
advantageous,
the harmful,

00:15:44.248 --> 00:15:47.843
the just and unjust,
and things of this sort that

00:15:47.843 --> 00:15:51.980
constitute, as he says,
a family and a polis.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.350
But that's Aristotle.
In what sense,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.093
we could ask ourselves and I
think you probably will be

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:03.698
asking in your sections,
in what sense is the city by

00:16:03.698 --> 00:16:07.021
nature?
In what sense are we political

00:16:07.021 --> 00:16:10.790
animals by nature?
Aristotle appears to give two

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.944
different accounts in the
opening pages of the book that

00:16:14.944 --> 00:16:19.493
you might pay attention to.
In the literal opening,

00:16:19.493 --> 00:16:25.051
he gives what looks like a kind
of natural history of the

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:29.248
polis.
He seems there to be a kind of

00:16:29.248 --> 00:16:32.899
anthropologist writing a natural
history.

00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:37.393
The polis is natural in
the sense that it has grown out

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:41.149
of smaller and lesser forms of
human association.

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:45.934
First comes the family,
then an association of families

00:16:45.934 --> 00:16:50.720
in a tribe, then a further
association in a village,

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.423
and then you might say an
association of villages that

00:16:54.423 --> 00:16:59.048
create a polis or a city.
The polis is natural in

00:16:59.048 --> 00:17:02.946
the sense that it is an
outgrowth, the most developed

00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:08.663
form of human association,
in the way that one used to see

00:17:08.663 --> 00:17:15.293
in natural history museums,
these kind of biological charts

00:17:15.293 --> 00:17:22.494
of human development from these
lesser forms of life all the way

00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:29.426
up to civilization in some way.
That is part of Aristotle's

00:17:29.426 --> 00:17:32.605
argument.
But there is a second sense for

00:17:32.605 --> 00:17:36.255
him and, in some ways,
a more important sense in which

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:39.080
he says the polis is by
nature.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.762
It is natural.
The city is natural in that it

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:47.181
allows human beings to achieve
and perfect what he calls their

00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:50.302
telos.
That is to say their end,

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:53.226
their purpose.
We are political animals,

00:17:53.226 --> 00:17:57.137
he says, because participation
in the life of the city is

00:17:57.137 --> 00:18:00.839
necessary for the achievement of
human excellence,

00:18:00.839 --> 00:18:04.119
for the achievement of our
well-being.

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:07.319
A person who is without a city,
he says, who is

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:11.144
apolis--without a
city--must either be a beast or

00:18:11.144 --> 00:18:13.148
a god.
That is to say,

00:18:13.148 --> 00:18:17.525
below humanity or above it.
Our political nature is our

00:18:17.525 --> 00:18:21.435
essential characteristic.
Because only by participating

00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:25.810
in political life do we achieve,
can we acquire the excellences

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.514
or the virtues,
as he says, that make us what

00:18:29.514 --> 00:18:33.794
we are, that fulfill our
telos or fulfill our

00:18:33.794 --> 00:18:34.970
perfection.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:43.585
When Aristotle says that man is
a political animal by nature,

00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:48.891
he is doing more than simply
asserting just a truism or just

00:18:48.891 --> 00:18:53.903
some platitude.
In many ways he is advancing a

00:18:53.903 --> 00:18:59.190
philosophic postulate of great
scope and power,

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.800
although the full development
of the thesis is only left

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.326
deeply embedded.
He doesn't fully develop it in

00:19:07.326 --> 00:19:10.576
this work or in saying.
He isn't saying that man is

00:19:10.576 --> 00:19:14.269
political by nature.
Note that he is not saying,

00:19:14.269 --> 00:19:18.750
although he is sometimes taken
to be saying this,

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.940
that he is not saying that
there is some kind of

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:28.378
biologically implanted desire or
impulse that we have or share

00:19:28.378 --> 00:19:32.480
that leads us to engage in
political life.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.791
That is to say we do not,
he wants to say,

00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:41.094
engage in politics.
To say it's natural for us to

00:19:41.094 --> 00:19:45.717
do so is not to say we engage in
political life spontaneously and

00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:49.214
avidly,
as you might say spiders spin

00:19:49.214 --> 00:19:53.305
webs or ants build anthills.
He is not a kind of

00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:57.252
socio-biologist of politics,
although he sometimes appears

00:19:57.252 --> 00:20:01.130
this way when he says that man
is a political animal.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.563
In some ways, to the contrary.
He says man is political not

00:20:05.563 --> 00:20:09.666
because we have some biological
impulse or instinct that drives

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:12.588
us to participate in politics,
but, he says,

00:20:12.588 --> 00:20:15.369
because we are possessed of the
power of speech.

00:20:15.369 --> 00:20:18.349
It is speech that makes us
political.

00:20:18.349 --> 00:20:23.701
Speech or reason in many was
far from determining our

00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:29.670
behavior in some kind of
deterministic biological sense,

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.852
speech or reason gives us a
kind of freedom,

00:20:33.852 --> 00:20:39.979
latitude, an area of discretion
in our behavior not available to

00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:43.355
other species.
It is a reason or speech,

00:20:43.355 --> 00:20:45.890
not instinct,
that makes us political.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.388
But then the question is,
for Aristotle,

00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:51.848
the question he poses for us
is: What is the connection

00:20:51.848 --> 00:20:56.211
between logos,
the capacity for speech of

00:20:56.211 --> 00:21:03.700
rationality, and politics?
How are these two combined?

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.730
Why does one lead to or entail
the other?

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.186
In many ways,
he's not making a causal claim

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:13.786
so much.
He's not saying that it is

00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:17.585
because we are rational
creatures possessed of the power

00:21:17.585 --> 00:21:21.039
of speech that causes us to
engage in politics.

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:27.583
He has more of an argument of
the kind that this attribute of

00:21:27.583 --> 00:21:32.710
logos actually entails
political life.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:38.266
He makes his argument,
I think, because logos

00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:43.170
entails two fundamentally human
attributes.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.630
First, the power to know,
you could say.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.891
The power to know is our
ability to recognize,

00:21:51.891 --> 00:21:56.910
by sight, members of the same
polis or city.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.600
It is, above all,
speech that in a way,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.566
ties us to others of our kind.
That we share not just the

00:22:07.566 --> 00:22:11.909
capacity for language in the way
a linguist might assert,

00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:16.019
but that we share a certain
common moral language.

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:21.449
It is this sharing of certain
common conceptions of the just

00:22:21.449 --> 00:22:26.581
and unjust that make a city.
It is the capacity to know and

00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:31.165
to recognize others who share
this language with us that is

00:22:31.165 --> 00:22:35.750
the first sense in which
logos entails politics.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:40.960
But reason or logos
entails more than this capacity.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.160
It also entails for Aristotle,
interestingly,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.794
the power of love.
We love those with whom we are

00:22:49.794 --> 00:22:55.516
most intimately related and who
are most immediately present and

00:22:55.516 --> 00:22:58.115
visible to us.
In many ways,

00:22:58.115 --> 00:23:02.989
Aristotle believes our social
and political nature is not the

00:23:02.989 --> 00:23:06.932
result of calculation,
as we will see in Hobbes,

00:23:06.932 --> 00:23:10.144
Locke, and other social
contract theorists,

00:23:10.144 --> 00:23:14.315
but such things as love,
affection, friendship,

00:23:14.315 --> 00:23:20.345
and sympathy are the grounds of
political life and are rooted in

00:23:20.345 --> 00:23:26.133
our logos.
It is speech that allows a

00:23:26.133 --> 00:23:34.029
sharing in these qualities that
make us fully human.

00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:37.384
But to say, of course,
that man is political by nature

00:23:37.384 --> 00:23:40.358
is not just to say that we
become fully human by

00:23:40.358 --> 00:23:42.890
participating with others in a
city.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.180
It means more than this.

00:23:47.289 --> 00:23:52.891
The form of association that
leads to our perfection is

00:23:52.891 --> 00:23:57.039
necessarily something
particularistic.

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:59.730
The city is always a particular
city.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:05.200
It is always this or that
particular city.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.214
The polis,
as Aristotle as well as Plato

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:12.530
clearly understand,
is a small society,

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.720
what could be called today a
closed society.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.817
A society that leads to our
perfection that leads us to

00:24:21.817 --> 00:24:26.443
complete and perfect our
telos must be held

00:24:26.443 --> 00:24:34.619
together by bonds of trust,
of friendship, of camaraderie.

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:39.393
A society based simply on the
mutual calculation of interests

00:24:39.393 --> 00:24:43.690
could not be a real political
society for Aristotle.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.589
We cannot trust all people,
Aristotle seems to say.

00:24:47.589 --> 00:24:53.138
Trust can only be extended to a
fairly small circle of friends

00:24:53.138 --> 00:24:56.529
and fellow citizens.
Only a small city,

00:24:56.529 --> 00:25:00.311
small enough to be governed by
relations of trust,

00:25:00.311 --> 00:25:03.708
can be political,
in Aristotle's sense of the

00:25:03.708 --> 00:25:07.023
term.
The alternative to the city,

00:25:07.023 --> 00:25:11.019
the empire, can only be ruled
despotically.

00:25:11.019 --> 00:25:15.581
There can be no relations of
trust in a large,

00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:19.460
imperial despotism.
It follows, in one sense,

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.450
that when Aristotle says that
man is by nature a political

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.970
animal and the city is by
nature,

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.809
the city can never be a
universal state.

00:25:30.809 --> 00:25:35.920
It can never be something that
incorporates all of humankind.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.422
It can never be a kind of
cosmopolis,

00:25:39.422 --> 00:25:43.819
a world state or even a league
of states or nations.

00:25:43.819 --> 00:25:49.463
The universal state will never
allow for or does not allow for

00:25:49.463 --> 00:25:54.552
the kind of self-perfection that
a small, self-governing

00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:58.707
polis will have.
The city, as Aristotle

00:25:58.707 --> 00:26:03.304
understands, will always exist
in a world with other cities or

00:26:03.304 --> 00:26:06.401
other states,
based on different principles

00:26:06.401 --> 00:26:08.750
that might be hostile to one's
own.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:14.168
That is to say not even the
best city on Aristotle's account

00:26:14.168 --> 00:26:18.210
can afford to be without a
foreign policy.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.995
A good citizen of a democracy
will not be the good citizen of

00:26:22.995 --> 00:26:27.733
another kind of regime.
Partisanship and loyalty to

00:26:27.733 --> 00:26:33.220
one's own way of life are
required by a healthy city.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.707
To put the argument in terms
that Polemarchus,

00:26:35.707 --> 00:26:38.359
from Plato's Republic
would have known,

00:26:38.359 --> 00:26:43.139
friend and enemy are natural
and ineradicable categories of

00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:46.633
political life.
Just as we cannot be friends

00:26:46.633 --> 00:26:50.073
with all persons,
so the city cannot be friends

00:26:50.073 --> 00:26:54.559
with all other cities or the
state with all other states.

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:59.756
War and the virtues necessary
for war are as natural to the

00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:03.698
city as are the virtues of
friendship, trust,

00:27:03.698 --> 00:27:07.640
and camaraderie that are also
necessary.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.768
Note that in the opening pages
of the book, Aristotle doesn't

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:22.430
say anything yet about what kind
of city or regime is best.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.156
All he tells us is that we are
the polis animal by

00:27:26.156 --> 00:27:30.083
nature and that to achieve our
ends, it will be necessary to

00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:33.920
live in a polis.
But what kind of polis?

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.259
How should it be governed?
By the one, the few,

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:43.099
the many, or some combination
of these three categories?

00:27:43.099 --> 00:27:46.536
At this point we know only the
most general features of what a

00:27:46.536 --> 00:27:49.571
polis is.
It must be small enough to be

00:27:49.571 --> 00:27:52.500
governed by a common language of
justice.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.561
It is not enough merely to
speak the same words,

00:27:55.561 --> 00:27:58.231
but in a sense,
citizens must have certain

00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:02.130
common experiences,
certain common memory and

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.450
experience that shape a city and
the people.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:11.136
The large polyglot,
multiethnic communities of

00:28:11.136 --> 00:28:15.509
today would not,
on Aristotle's account,

00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:20.794
allow for sufficient mutual
trust and friendship to count as

00:28:20.794 --> 00:28:26.007
a healthy political community.
So Aristotle seems to be

00:28:26.007 --> 00:28:31.679
offering, in some respects,
a kind of criticism of the kind

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:36.079
of states with which we are most
familiar.

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:39.886
Think about that when you have
your sections or when you talk

00:28:39.886 --> 00:28:42.170
about this text with your
friends.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.270
What is Aristotle saying about
us?

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.018
The citizens of such a city can
only reach their telos or

00:28:52.018 --> 00:28:55.269
perfection through participating
in the offices,

00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:57.759
in the ruling offices of a
city.

00:28:57.759 --> 00:29:02.347
Again, a large cosmopolitan
state may allow each individual

00:29:02.347 --> 00:29:05.589
the freedom to live as he or she
likes,

00:29:05.589 --> 00:29:09.849
but this is not freedom as
Aristotle understands it.

00:29:09.849 --> 00:29:15.007
Freedom only comes through the
exercise of political

00:29:15.007 --> 00:29:19.558
responsibility,
which means responsibility for

00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:25.930
and oversight of one's fellow
citizens and the common good.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.835
It follows, for him,
that freedom does not mean

00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:33.741
living as we like,
but freedom is informed by a

00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:38.751
certain sense of restraint and
awareness that not all things

00:29:38.751 --> 00:29:42.743
are permitted,
that the good society will be

00:29:42.743 --> 00:29:46.934
one that promotes a sense of
moderation, restraint and

00:29:46.934 --> 00:29:49.523
self-control,
self-governance,

00:29:49.523 --> 00:29:53.492
as Adeimantus says,
that are inseparable from the

00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:55.560
experience of freedom.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.992
In many ways Aristotle there
offers, as does Plato,

00:30:02.992 --> 00:30:07.704
a certain kind of critique of
the modern or even the ancient

00:30:07.704 --> 00:30:15.950
democratic theory of freedom,
which is living as one likes.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:22.167
You can see these opening pages
of the book, dense argument

00:30:22.167 --> 00:30:28.063
being condensed in very deep
ways, carry a great deal of

00:30:28.063 --> 00:30:31.625
freight.
There's a lot in there that

00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:36.465
needs to be unpacked.
I've only tried to do a little

00:30:36.465 --> 00:30:42.038
of that here with you today,
to go over what Aristotle is

00:30:42.038 --> 00:30:47.910
suggesting in this idea of man,
the polis animal.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.583
Whatever we may think about
this view, whether we like it or

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:54.509
don't like it or whatever your
view might be,

00:30:54.509 --> 00:31:02.015
you must also confront another
famous, more like infamous,

00:31:02.015 --> 00:31:08.730
doctrine that is also very much
a part of Book I.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:14.769
I refer to his arguments for
the naturalness of slavery.

00:31:14.769 --> 00:31:19.279
Aristotle tells us that slavery
is natural.

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:25.760
The naturalness of slavery is
said to follow from the belief

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.593
that inequality,
inequality is the basic rule

00:31:30.593 --> 00:31:35.394
between human beings.
Aristotle and Thomas Jefferson

00:31:35.394 --> 00:31:39.229
seem to disagree over the basic
fact of human experience,

00:31:39.229 --> 00:31:41.900
whether it's equality or
inequality.

00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:49.362
If this is true,
Aristotle's Politics seems to

00:31:49.362 --> 00:31:53.683
stand condemned as the most
antidemocratic book ever

00:31:53.683 --> 00:31:57.690
written.
Is that true?

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.963
Aristotle's claim about
naturalness seems to require,

00:32:02.963 --> 00:32:06.816
as he told us,
slavery, the categorical

00:32:06.816 --> 00:32:12.090
distinction of humanity into
masters and slaves.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:16.773
How to understand that?
Again, Aristotle's argument is

00:32:16.773 --> 00:32:21.536
deeply compact and will be
easily misunderstood if you only

00:32:21.536 --> 00:32:25.043
read it once.
It will just as likely be

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:29.079
misunderstood if you read it
three, four, five,

00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:32.589
or ten times,
if you are not attentive to

00:32:32.589 --> 00:32:35.270
what he's saying.
You must learn to read closely.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:45.061
What was Aristotle saying?
In the first place,

00:32:45.061 --> 00:32:51.742
it's important that we avoid,
I think, two equally unhelpful

00:32:51.742 --> 00:32:57.051
ways of responding to this.
The first, which one finds

00:32:57.051 --> 00:32:59.550
among many modern-day
commentators,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:03.591
many kind of neo-Aristotelians,
we might call them,

00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:06.998
is to simply avert our eyes
from the harsh,

00:33:06.998 --> 00:33:11.298
unappealing aspects of
Aristotle's thought and proceed

00:33:11.298 --> 00:33:15.759
as if he never actually said or
meant such things.

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:19.940
We need to avoid the
temptation, in many ways

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:25.145
understandable as it might be,
to airbrush or sanitize

00:33:25.145 --> 00:33:30.984
Aristotle, to make him seem more
politically correct for modern

00:33:30.984 --> 00:33:34.208
readers.
Yet, we should also avoid the

00:33:34.208 --> 00:33:38.283
second, equally powerful
temptation, which is to reject

00:33:38.283 --> 00:33:42.756
Aristotle out of hand,
because his views do not

00:33:42.756 --> 00:33:47.421
correspond with our own.
The question is what did

00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:52.480
Aristotle mean by slavery?
Who or what did he think was

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.558
the slave by nature?
Until we understand what he

00:33:56.558 --> 00:34:00.454
meant, we have no reason to
either accept or reject his

00:34:00.454 --> 00:34:01.320
argument.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.554
The first point worth noting
about this, is that Aristotle

00:34:08.554 --> 00:34:11.730
did not simply assume slavery
was natural,

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:16.373
because it was practiced
virtually everywhere in the

00:34:16.373 --> 00:34:20.406
ancient world.
You will notice that he frames

00:34:20.406 --> 00:34:23.670
his analysis in the form of a
debate.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.619
He says at the outset of his
argument, "There are some," he

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:31.570
says, indicating this is an
opinion held by many people.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.506
"There are some who believe
that slavery is natural,

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:40.214
because ruling and being ruled
is a pervasive distinction that

00:34:40.214 --> 00:34:43.070
one sees all societies
practice."

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.061
But he says,
"Others believe that the

00:34:46.061 --> 00:34:50.299
distinction between master and
slave is not natural,

00:34:50.299 --> 00:34:53.539
but is based on force or
coercion."

00:34:53.539 --> 00:34:57.663
Even in Aristotle's time,
it appears slavery was a

00:34:57.663 --> 00:35:02.797
controversial institution and
elicited very different kinds of

00:35:02.797 --> 00:35:07.485
opinions and responses.
Here is one of those moments

00:35:07.485 --> 00:35:10.762
when Aristotle,
as I indicated earlier,

00:35:10.762 --> 00:35:14.039
seems most maddeningly
open-minded.

00:35:14.039 --> 00:35:20.126
He's willing to entertain
arguments, both for and against

00:35:20.126 --> 00:35:24.137
the debate.
Aristotle agrees with those who

00:35:24.137 --> 00:35:28.409
deny that slavery is justified
by war or conquest.

00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:31.590
Wars, he remarks,
are not always just.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:36.422
So, those who are captured in
war, cannot be assumed to be

00:35:36.422 --> 00:35:42.496
justly or naturally enslaved.
Similarly, he denies that

00:35:42.496 --> 00:35:49.940
slavery is always or only
appropriate for non-Greeks.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.779
There are no,
he is saying,

00:35:51.779 --> 00:35:55.175
racial or ethnic
characteristics that distinguish

00:35:55.175 --> 00:35:58.429
the natural slave from the
natural master.

00:35:58.429 --> 00:36:02.768
In a stunning admission,
he says--listen to this--that

00:36:02.768 --> 00:36:07.352
"while nature may intend to
distinguish the free man from

00:36:07.352 --> 00:36:12.008
the slave,"
he says, "the opposite often

00:36:12.008 --> 00:36:16.479
results.
Nature often misses the mark,"

00:36:16.479 --> 00:36:20.238
he says.
Now we seem to be completely

00:36:20.238 --> 00:36:22.964
confused.
If slavery is natural,

00:36:22.964 --> 00:36:27.245
and if nature intends to
distinguish the slave from the

00:36:27.245 --> 00:36:32.320
free, the free from the unfree,
how can nature miss the mark?

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.809
How can the opposite often
result?

00:36:35.809 --> 00:36:40.601
I mention this because such
complications should alert the

00:36:40.601 --> 00:36:46.469
careful reader.
We're trying to read carefully.

00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:50.320
What is Aristotle doing in
making this seem so complicated?

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:56.526
At the same time,
Aristotle agrees with those who

00:36:56.526 --> 00:37:01.570
defend the thesis of natural
slavery.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:05.789
His defense seems to run
something like this.

00:37:05.789 --> 00:37:11.422
Slavery is natural because we
cannot rule ourselves without

00:37:11.422 --> 00:37:18.460
the restraint of the passions.
Self-rule means self-restraint.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.236
Restraint or self-control is
necessary for freedom or

00:37:23.236 --> 00:37:26.055
self-government.
What is true,

00:37:26.055 --> 00:37:30.536
he seems to suggest,
about the restraint over one's

00:37:30.536 --> 00:37:35.644
passions and desires is true of
restraint and control over

00:37:35.644 --> 00:37:38.684
others,
just as he appears to be saying

00:37:38.684 --> 00:37:41.600
there is a kind of hierarchy
within the soul,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.141
restraint of the passion.
So does that psychological

00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:51.428
hierarchy translate itself into
a kind of social hierarchy

00:37:51.428 --> 00:37:54.860
between different kinds of
people?

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.048
The natural hierarchy,
then, seems to be a sort of

00:37:59.048 --> 00:38:03.748
hierarchy of intelligence or at
least a hierarchy of the

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:06.940
rational.
"How did this come to be?"

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.581
Aristotle asks.
How is it that some people came

00:38:10.581 --> 00:38:14.978
to acquire this capacity for
rational self-control that is

00:38:14.978 --> 00:38:18.990
necessary for freedom and others
seem to lack it?

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.367
How did that come to be?
Is this hierarchy,

00:38:21.367 --> 00:38:24.480
again, a genetic quality?
Is it something we're born with?

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.879
Is it something that is
implanted in us by nature in

00:38:28.879 --> 00:38:33.278
that sense, or is that
distinction something that is

00:38:33.278 --> 00:38:36.469
created by nurture and
education,

00:38:36.469 --> 00:38:40.010
what we would call today maybe
socialization?

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:43.149
If the latter,
if this hierarchy of

00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:48.874
intelligence or this hierarchy
of the rational is the result of

00:38:48.874 --> 00:38:52.262
upbringing,
then how can slavery be

00:38:52.262 --> 00:38:56.403
defended as natural?
Doesn't Aristotle call man the

00:38:56.403 --> 00:38:59.949
rational animal,
the being with logos,

00:38:59.949 --> 00:39:03.811
suggesting that all human
beings have a desire for

00:39:03.811 --> 00:39:08.303
knowledge and the desire to
cultivate their minds and live

00:39:08.303 --> 00:39:11.483
as free persons.
Isn't there a kind of

00:39:11.483 --> 00:39:13.545
egalitarianism,
so to speak,

00:39:13.545 --> 00:39:17.973
built in to the conception of
rational animal and political

00:39:17.973 --> 00:39:19.707
animal?
He begins his

00:39:19.707 --> 00:39:22.032
Metaphysics,
his great book the

00:39:22.032 --> 00:39:24.672
Metaphysics,
with the famous opening

00:39:24.672 --> 00:39:27.690
statement, "All men have a
desire to know."

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:32.317
If we all have a desire to
know, doesn't this connote

00:39:32.317 --> 00:39:36.500
something universal,
that all should be free,

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:41.254
that all should participate in
ruling and being ruled as

00:39:41.254 --> 00:39:45.280
citizens of a city?
Yet, at the same time,

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.006
Aristotle seems to regard
education as the preserve of the

00:39:51.006 --> 00:39:54.329
few.
The kind of discipline and

00:39:54.329 --> 00:39:59.668
self-restraint necessary for an
educated mind appears,

00:39:59.668 --> 00:40:05.210
for him, to be unequally
divided among human beings.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.492
It follows, I think,
that the regime according to

00:40:09.492 --> 00:40:13.150
nature, that is to say the best
regime,

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:17.789
would be what we might think of
as an aristocracy of the

00:40:17.789 --> 00:40:22.260
educated, an aristocracy of
education and training,

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.893
an aristocratic republic of
some sort where an educated

00:40:27.893 --> 00:40:31.650
elite governs for the good of
all.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:37.150
Aristotle's republic,
and I use that term to remind

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:42.429
you of Plato as well,
is devoted to cultivating a

00:40:42.429 --> 00:40:49.030
high level of citizen virtue
where this means those qualities

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:54.969
of mind and heart necessary for
self-government.

00:40:54.969 --> 00:40:56.933
These qualities,
he believes,

00:40:56.933 --> 00:41:00.580
are the preserve of the few,
of a minority capable of

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.998
sharing in the administration of
justice and in the offices of a

00:41:04.998 --> 00:41:05.770
city.

00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:16.000
It seems to be a very elite
teaching.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.805
Would you agree?
Unappealing to us,

00:41:19.805 --> 00:41:25.172
perhaps, for that reason,
very contrary to our intuitions

00:41:25.172 --> 00:41:28.910
and the way we have been brought
up.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:33.280
Yes?
You'll agree with me.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:38.583
But before we dismiss
Aristotle's account as

00:41:38.583 --> 00:41:43.639
insufferably inegalitarian and
elitist,

00:41:43.639 --> 00:41:48.415
we have to ask a difficult
question, not just of Aristotle,

00:41:48.415 --> 00:41:51.380
but more importantly of
ourselves.

00:41:55.019 --> 00:42:00.107
What else is Yale,
but an elite institution

00:42:00.107 --> 00:42:05.800
intended to educate,
morally and intellectually,

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:11.130
potential members of a
leadership class?

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:19.550
Think about that.
Can anyone get into Yale?

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:24.358
Do we have an open admissions
policy for all who want to come

00:42:24.358 --> 00:42:27.099
here?
Hardly.

00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:33.820
Does it not require those
qualities of self-control,

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:40.804
discipline, and restraint
necessary to achieve success

00:42:40.804 --> 00:42:42.877
here?
I will leave aside,

00:42:42.877 --> 00:42:44.792
for the moment,
what happens on Friday and

00:42:44.792 --> 00:42:45.680
Saturday nights.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:53.931
Is it any coincidence that
graduates from this university

00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:58.549
and a handful of others not
unlike it find themselves in

00:42:58.549 --> 00:43:03.518
high positions of government,
of business,

00:43:03.518 --> 00:43:11.532
of law, and the academy?
Is it unfair or unreasonable to

00:43:11.532 --> 00:43:15.849
describe this class,
as Aristotle might,

00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:21.806
as a natural aristocracy?
I leave you with this question

00:43:21.806 --> 00:43:26.816
to think about.
Before we reject Aristotle as

00:43:26.816 --> 00:43:33.309
an antidemocratic elitist,
take a look at yourselves.

00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:39.869
So are you, or you wouldn't be
sitting here today.

00:43:39.869 --> 00:43:46.000
Think about that and I'll see
you next week.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.621
A couple updates that I thought
you might be interested in:

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:03.840
U.S.
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.135
District Court in San Juan just
dismissed the case of 7,000

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:15.070
Viequense who had filed a suit
against the federal government,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.547
the Department of the Navy,
seeking compensation for

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:21.480
damages to their island and
their health.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.967
So that this suit has been in
the making for about seven

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.660
years, and it will be appealed.
 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.755
Also the Ebling case that you
may have read about in Green

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:37.370
Intelligence,
the two young children that

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.630
claimed exposure to pesticides
at a very young age.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.420
That is going to trial in
August now, it was just

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.710
announced, after ten years.
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.636
So this should give you pause
to think about the effect and

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:56.420
cost of litigation.
 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.039
In terms of TSCA Reform,
TSCA Reform was just introduced

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.539
into both the House and the
Senate,

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.459
in the Senate by Senator
Lautenberg,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.400
in the House by Henry Waxman.
 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.769
And for the first time in
nearly twenty-five years,

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:13.712
there's some anticipation that
there will be serious reform of

00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:16.269
the way that commercial
chemicals are regulated in the

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:16.849
country.
 

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:19.870
The chemical companies,
curiously,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.280
are motivated to seek changes
in this law,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.006
because if products that they
make in this country are not

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:30.995
tested to the same standard as
product testing requirements in

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:32.920
Europe,
then U.S.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.940
chemicals will not be allowed
to be sold in Europe.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.040
So that chemical companies are
extremely concerned about the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.959
idea of harmonizing law between
the U.S.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.670
and the European Union.
 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.468
Cape Wind has not been decided,
but there really appears to be

00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:51.330
no clear direction on the part
of Ken Salazar at this point.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.357
You should keep your eyes open
for that over the next week or

00:01:54.357 --> 00:01:54.610
so.
 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.330
And a diesel update.
 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.483
We talked about diesel exhaust
and we talked about the health

00:01:59.483 --> 00:02:01.430
consequences of particulate
matter.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.671
But there is new evidence that
was released quite recently by

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:10.110
Nadine Unger,
who is going to be a new

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.955
assistant professor here next
year who has worked with the

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:19.970
Columbia University and NASA on
the effect of particles.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.437
And it's kind of a curious
effect that particles of one

00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:27.192
form,
especially those that are

00:02:27.192 --> 00:02:31.560
attached to organic matter,
tend to have a reflective

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.190
effect to radiation.
 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.700
So it basically may have a
cooling effect,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.192
whereas black carbon itself
tends to absorb the radiation,

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.520
which would have a warming
effect.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.628
So it's interesting.
 

00:02:43.628 --> 00:02:47.729
Diesel exhaust has been
fingered, identified as one of

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:52.449
the key sources of black carbon
in the atmosphere that we need

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.626
to pay much more attention to
for its warming effect on

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:57.710
climate.
 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.538
Happy Earth Day.
 

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:04.750
Forty years ago today,
Earth Day occurred.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.598
And your parents and I probably
remember it pretty well.

00:03:08.598 --> 00:03:10.729
I was in Philadelphia at the
time.

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:15.151
And it was really an
interesting and highly confused

00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:17.840
time to be a college student.
 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.079
And what was interesting about
it is that it was a period of

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.318
collision between different
social movements that really had

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:28.688
a core based in universities.
 

00:03:28.688 --> 00:03:32.288
And the collision was among the
anti-war movement,

00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:36.254
the civil rights movement,
as well as the environmental

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:37.210
movement.
 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.110
Nobody really knew what that
meant at the time,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.590
but sitting in Philadelphia,
living in Philadelphia,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.574
watching the yellow sunsets
that occurred every evening

00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:48.639
because of the filthy air.
 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.759
And rowing on the Schuylkill
River with the crew team having

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:58.881
to scrape the globules of slime
and material chemical wastes

00:03:58.881 --> 00:04:04.348
that were deposited legally into
the Schuylkill River really was

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:06.780
an unhappy experience.
 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.728
So really, it was also the dawn
of the modern era of

00:04:10.728 --> 00:04:13.360
environmental law in the nation.
 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.745
And the Clean Air Act
revisions, the Clean Water Act

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:19.985
revisions,
the 1970s were really a time

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:25.420
when great energy was put into
the design of environmental law.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.324
And there was great expectation
on the part of people that had

00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:35.228
worked in these movements too
that environmental quality would

00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:37.399
change quite radically.
 

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:41.961
So I wanted to reflect with you
today about imagining an ideal

00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:42.709
society.
 

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:46.410
We think that we're facing many
very severe problems.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.144
And one of the themes of this
course has been to try to help

00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:54.007
you judge the effectiveness and
potential of environmental law

00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:57.807
to shape behavior so that people
will behave more responsibly

00:04:57.807 --> 00:05:01.480
toward the environment and
protect human health and protect

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.569
scarce natural resources.
 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.197
So for a moment,
I'd like you to kind of step

00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:09.601
back away from your perception
of all the problems that we

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:10.139
face.
 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.507
And instead,
to have you imagine an ideal

00:05:13.507 --> 00:05:14.350
society.
 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.420
So what would it look like?
 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.040
Well, environmental law really
targets itself toward damages.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.040
So knowledge is really a
critical element of it.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.553
And the knowledge that's
necessary in order for it to be

00:05:27.553 --> 00:05:28.879
effective is quite complex.
 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.211
So in the ideal world,
you would want to have perfect

00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:35.930
knowledge of externalities,
perfect predictive capacity.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.560
What's the effect of my
behavior going to be?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.625
You'd want to have an efficient
system for compensation for

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:44.480
damages, because all damages
could never be avoided.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.769
You'd also want to have a
literate public,

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:50.795
a public that was capable of
understanding the technical

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:54.317
information at a level of detail
that would make them potentially

00:05:54.317 --> 00:05:56.850
effective participants in
decision making.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.485
So literacy,
the capacity to learn,

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:02.740
is a really important component
of this.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.379
You would want to have
governmental authority and the

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.060
resources to regulate.
 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.709
So not only the right to
regulate that would be

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:15.755
authorized by Congress or a
Parliament, but also the

00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:17.819
resources to regulate.
 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.350
And those don't normally go
hand in hand.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.949
So that you often get the
passage of a law,

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.920
but you don't get the
allocation of resources.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.069
So there's the authorization of
money that's necessary,

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.509
then there's the appropriation
of money that's necessary.

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.814
And then EPA or whoever the
agency is have to actually

00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:39.430
expend the money in order to
have an effective response.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.987
In an ideal society,
I'd say also that we need to

00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:46.247
pay, we would be paying
attention to the most

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:47.360
vulnerable.
 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.920
They would be identified and
they would be protected by

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.579
statute.
 

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:54.480
There would be equal protection
for all.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.084
And I'll talk more about
inequality in environmental law

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.329
in a few moments.
 

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:04.411
And we would have figured out
how to manage natural resources,

00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:08.076
such as our forests,
our soils, our wildlife,

00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:10.160
in a sustainable way.
 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.389
And it's quite interesting.
 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:14.605
When we use the word
sustainability,

00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:15.810
I tend to cringe.
 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.769
It's not my favorite word.
 

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:21.610
I think it's ambiguous and I
think it is used way too

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.350
loosely.
 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.415
But where it seems to be
clearest and have provided a

00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:30.795
model for effective law has been
with respect to managing

00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:35.206
resources such as forests,
fisheries, where you can

00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:38.985
monitor a population,
you can monitor its rate of

00:07:38.985 --> 00:07:41.089
growth,
its reproductive success.

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:44.696
So that thinking about
sustainable management of

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:49.529
natural resources has been in
some instances a success story.

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:53.050
I think I would imagine a
stable climate as well.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.122
So I wanted to have you think
with me also about what's been

00:07:57.122 --> 00:07:58.019
successful?
 

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.519
What can we point to as success
stories?

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:02.319
And I think that a number of
the cases,

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.990
I chose the cases quite
deliberately for this course,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.519
and a number of them
demonstrate the potential of law

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:11.500
to control behavior,
to achieve some of these

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.209
objectives.
 

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:14.189
And I think clearly,
the wilderness protection

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:16.564
system and the national park
system that we have in the

00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:19.470
United States really is the envy
of many nations in the world.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.887
So that we have effectively set
aside lands and we've restricted

00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:29.615
human access and certain
behaviors and extraction rights

00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:31.250
in these areas.
 

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.240
And that really has been quite
a successful policy.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.440
Our national seashores I think
represent a really far-sighted

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.730
approach that were meant to
provide recreational

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.389
opportunities in the coastal
zone.

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:48.820
But as I mentioned in the
lecture on looking at Cape Cod

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.009
and Fire Island and Padre Island
and Point Reyes,

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:56.654
the fact that the government
went into those areas and bought

00:08:56.654 --> 00:08:58.993
them,
or consolidated federal

00:08:58.993 --> 00:09:04.068
ownership, is going to restrict
future development in a way that

00:09:04.068 --> 00:09:08.660
will reduce long-term costs
associated with sea level rise

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.240
and increased storm damage.
 

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.254
The Adirondack Park strikes me
as also being a real success

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:16.710
story in many ways.
 

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.135
For me, it really represents a
model for regulating private

00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:25.639
land use in the vicinity of
highly valuable public lands.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:30.269
And remember this park was set
aside back in the 1870s.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:33.990
So that the Adirondack Park
Agency concept was really

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.710
designed initially to protect
what they thought of as

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.893
biological diversity,
ecological diversity as well as

00:09:42.893 --> 00:09:46.470
integrity,
whatever that meant at the

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.384
time, back in 1972,
when the Park Agency statute

00:09:50.384 --> 00:09:51.269
was passed.
 

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:55.077
But almost inadvertently,
they had designed an energy

00:09:55.077 --> 00:09:58.960
conservation plan that really
was quite remarkable.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.263
Remember this idea that you
regulate and demand very large

00:10:03.263 --> 00:10:05.678
lot sizes in the remote areas.
 

00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:08.988
And then you basically take
away the density requirements in

00:10:08.988 --> 00:10:10.389
the towns and villages.
 

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:12.548
There are really no urban
centers in the Adirondacks.

00:10:12.548 --> 00:10:16.046
But this open space
preservation and incentive to

00:10:16.046 --> 00:10:20.706
increase density in the existing
areas that already are developed

00:10:20.706 --> 00:10:24.222
and have infrastructure,
have roads, have electric

00:10:24.222 --> 00:10:26.720
lines, et cetera,
it really is remarkable.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.815
So in terms of an energy
conservation strategy that one

00:10:30.815 --> 00:10:34.682
might embed into a land use
plan, it really was very

00:10:34.682 --> 00:10:35.820
innovative.
 

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.808
They also used the idea of
transferable development rights

00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:43.590
in the Adirondacks that I think
is a very cool idea.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:48.543
There's a parallel here to the
idea of setting up these

00:10:48.543 --> 00:10:50.928
ecosystem service banks.
 

00:10:50.928 --> 00:10:54.154
So I wanted to give you the
example of a windmill,

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.048
we talked about wind energy the
other day.

00:10:57.048 --> 00:11:01.235
I want to give you the idea
that supposing you had property

00:11:01.235 --> 00:11:05.062
next to a windmill and you
thought that you were being

00:11:05.062 --> 00:11:07.298
adversely affected by that.
 

00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:11.080
Is there a way that you might
be compensated that would

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.720
prevent you from litigating,
that might make you more

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.820
accepting of the windmill?
 

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:24.442
So imagine that you set up a
square around a windmill or a

00:11:24.442 --> 00:11:26.450
wind turbine.
 

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.236
And you basically use the
1,000-foot or the 300-meter

00:11:31.236 --> 00:11:36.577
distance from any property
boundary that's been recommended

00:11:36.577 --> 00:11:39.340
to reduce adverse effects.
 

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.308
So that that would constitute
roughly about a hundred acres.

00:11:42.308 --> 00:11:45.626
Well supposing you had a patch
of people that lived adjacent to

00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:46.269
that land.
 

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:49.753
What could you do for them that
might make them more accepting

00:11:49.753 --> 00:11:50.210
of it?
 

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.812
Well one thing you could do
would be to provide them with

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:53.788
development rights.
 

00:11:53.788 --> 00:11:56.918
But maybe they didn't want to--
they may not want to develop on

00:11:56.918 --> 00:11:57.980
their own property.
 

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.735
So that you could set up a bank
whereby they could deposit these

00:12:02.735 --> 00:12:07.490
development rights in that bank
and then somebody who lived in a

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:12.168
receiving zone or purchased
property in a receiving zone,

00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:15.460
the receiving zone designed to
increase density,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.308
say in one of these urban
centers that I just mentioned,

00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:22.355
then the developer that wanted
to increase the density of land

00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:26.335
that he owned or would buy in
that urban zone would go to the

00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:30.380
bank and purchase the credit so
that the adjacent landowner to

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.095
the turbine would be compensated
and development would be

00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:37.808
encouraged to grow near existing
infrastructure.

00:12:37.808 --> 00:12:42.870
So the ecosystem service banks
that have grown up associated

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.547
with wetlands,
degradation also with stream

00:12:46.547 --> 00:12:50.345
mitigation banking,
they present I think a real

00:12:50.345 --> 00:12:53.350
model for us to follow in the
future.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.515
The SO_2 cap and
trade program was clearly a

00:12:56.515 --> 00:13:00.158
success in reducing sulfur
dioxides and acid precipitation.

00:13:00.158 --> 00:13:05.481
And a variety of other cases
that we went through in the

00:13:05.481 --> 00:13:11.384
course I think also demonstrate
the potential effectiveness of

00:13:11.384 --> 00:13:12.158
law.
 

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:15.970
The nuclear weapons testing ban
back in 1963.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.080
Population control.
 

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.717
If this were Earth Day back in
1970, I remember the lectures on

00:13:23.717 --> 00:13:28.538
Earth Day back in 1970,
and they were about population

00:13:28.538 --> 00:13:29.629
control.
 

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:34.059
Population was thought to be
the source of environmental

00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:38.250
degradation, particularly in the
developing world.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.880
And population control efforts
have been really quite

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.538
successful.
 

00:13:41.538 --> 00:13:43.918
We haven't discussed population
control.

00:13:43.918 --> 00:13:47.926
And I'm actually a little
embarrassed to be running an

00:13:47.926 --> 00:13:52.309
environmental studies major
without a demography element to

00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:52.840
it.
 

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.168
But it really is a very
important aspect of

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.389
environmental degradation.
 

00:13:58.389 --> 00:14:04.061
In terms of--and as the father
of children, I could think of

00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:10.308
myself as having created with my
wife beautiful young children.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:14.221
I could also think of it as
creating future consumers that

00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:18.067
are going to be spending
millions of dollars buying goods

00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:22.254
and services and developing land
and doing whatever that would

00:14:22.254 --> 00:14:25.548
have an adverse effect on the
environment.

00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:30.336
So that the mantra back in 1970
was population control is the

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:34.404
primary approach that we should
be taking to control

00:14:34.404 --> 00:14:36.399
environmental damage.
 

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:39.836
The success in pesticides
associated with the chlorinated

00:14:39.836 --> 00:14:41.371
hydrocarbons,
DDT, aldrin,

00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:44.379
dieldrin, chemicals that would
bioaccumulate.

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:47.645
We really learned the
bioaccumulation story

00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:52.779
predominantly from strontium-90
back in the weapons testing era.

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:56.009
But then it was repeated in the
1960s and 1970s.

00:14:56.009 --> 00:14:58.460
And these compounds were
successfully phased out.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.524
It was one of the first
objectives of William

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:03.150
Ruckelshaus when he became the
first administrator to the

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.840
Environmental Protection Agency.
 

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.006
And you can see in the graphs
the steady decline in

00:15:09.006 --> 00:15:12.674
concentrations,
not just in birds but in fish

00:15:12.674 --> 00:15:17.009
and other wildlife,
as well as in human tissues.

00:15:17.009 --> 00:15:18.259
A great success story.
 

00:15:18.259 --> 00:15:21.428
And that also was modeled in
the history of lead.

00:15:21.428 --> 00:15:24.927
And as lead was taken out of
gasoline, as lead was taken out

00:15:24.927 --> 00:15:25.580
of paint.
 

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.820
You can see the concentrations
declining and the nations

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.058
children and in other nations
where lead was removed.

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.850
It's really a very striking
success story.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.913
Chlorinated fluorocarbons,
known to adversely affect the

00:15:40.913 --> 00:15:44.980
stratospheric ozone layer were
removed from aerosols.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.479
PCBs were removed from
transmission tower coolers and

00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:54.546
other electronics,
they also had built up and

00:15:54.546 --> 00:15:58.308
bioaccumulated in wildlife as
well as human tissues.

00:15:58.308 --> 00:16:02.509
The prevention of use of
asbestos as a building material.

00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:04.668
Our tobacco regulations.
 

00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:08.847
We have one of the lowest
adoption rates now than has

00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:12.945
existed at any other point
previous in the twentieth

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:13.909
century.
 

00:16:13.909 --> 00:16:15.350
And food safety.
 

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.642
You may think of food safety as
kind of an odd topic,

00:16:18.642 --> 00:16:22.376
but in low-income parts of the
world, food safety is a major

00:16:22.376 --> 00:16:23.769
source of illness.
 

00:16:23.769 --> 00:16:27.470
And even in this country,
the estimate by the Centers for

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.567
Disease Control of the number of
illnesses per year experienced

00:16:31.567 --> 00:16:34.740
by contaminated food is
seventy-six million.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.450
That's an enormous issue.
 

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.059
It has to do with the
availability of water and the

00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:44.537
control of microbes and the way
that food is handled and washed

00:16:44.537 --> 00:16:47.570
and stored as well as how it's
cooked.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.168
The organic food movement has
been successful.

00:16:51.168 --> 00:16:55.434
It's, as I mentioned earlier,
the most rapidly growing sector

00:16:55.434 --> 00:16:57.070
in the food industry.
 

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.139
And drinking water quality.
 

00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:03.024
Poor drinking water quality in
low-income parts of the world is

00:17:03.024 --> 00:17:04.088
a major killer.
 

00:17:04.088 --> 00:17:08.386
The World Health Organization
estimates that well more than a

00:17:08.386 --> 00:17:12.470
million children die from
contaminated water each year.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.230
We also suffer much less from
respiratory infections.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:23.193
So forgive me as the computer
for some reason is running

00:17:23.193 --> 00:17:27.119
through each one very slowly.
 

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:33.950
Come on.
 

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:41.051
So in contrast to where law has
worked well, where has it not

00:17:41.051 --> 00:17:42.710
worked well?
 

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.588
Well I think fossil fuel policy
has been disastrous,

00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:50.773
especially the kinds of
subsidies that we've allowed the

00:17:50.773 --> 00:17:52.598
industry to receive.
 

00:17:52.598 --> 00:17:57.144
And I mentioned that simply the
absence of investment in public

00:17:57.144 --> 00:18:01.468
transit and the enormity of the
public investment in highway

00:18:01.468 --> 00:18:04.400
development and highway
maintenance.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.390
Our renewable energy policy has
also been a disaster.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.536
And despite the improvements
and the increase in funding

00:18:10.536 --> 00:18:12.710
that's going into renewable
energy,

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.721
it's nowhere near sufficient in
order to increase the proportion

00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:21.936
of renewable energy that is
necessary to deal with the

00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:25.118
CO_2 problem that we
face.

00:18:25.118 --> 00:18:28.189
Personal consumption,
individual consumption,

00:18:28.189 --> 00:18:32.443
individual purchasing is going
up, as are the number of people

00:18:32.443 --> 00:18:33.769
in the country.
 

00:18:33.769 --> 00:18:35.868
We're at about 310 million
people,

00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:40.674
we're projected to go to about
350 in about the next forty

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:45.650
years and perhaps reach 400
million people in the nation.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.561
So you multiply consumption of
each individual times that

00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:55.913
scale, we're sitting in a nation
now where we have roughly 250

00:18:55.913 --> 00:18:58.019
million automobiles.
 

00:18:58.019 --> 00:19:02.900
And we're likely to see that
rise quite substantially.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.368
So that people have fled to the
suburbs.

00:19:06.368 --> 00:19:08.931
Now they can't sell the
property in the suburbs,

00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:11.328
even if they wanted to live in
an urban area,

00:19:11.328 --> 00:19:13.509
because of the declining land
value.

00:19:13.509 --> 00:19:17.288
Parks and protected areas are
not being created any longer,

00:19:17.288 --> 00:19:21.950
so that the rate of adoption of
parks and protected areas,

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.825
even though I just claimed that
they were a great success where

00:19:24.825 --> 00:19:27.509
they were created,
the rate of establishing parks

00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:30.983
and protect areas has fallen off
quite dramatically since that

00:19:30.983 --> 00:19:31.440
time.
 

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.012
The Park Service's land
acquisition efforts have

00:19:35.012 --> 00:19:35.848
declined.
 

00:19:35.848 --> 00:19:40.696
Biological diversity loss is
also increasing as a function of

00:19:40.696 --> 00:19:43.767
habitat loss,
as a function of chemical

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:47.078
applications,
pesticide applications.

00:19:47.078 --> 00:19:50.048
Marine species exploitation is
increasing.

00:19:50.048 --> 00:19:53.715
The rate of extinction is
increasing in the world's

00:19:53.715 --> 00:19:56.365
oceans,
driven in part by changing

00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:59.019
water quality in the coastal
zone,

00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:01.548
but driven also by unregulated
fishing,

00:20:01.548 --> 00:20:04.650
particularly beyond the
200-mile limit.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.156
The outdoor as opposed to
indoor focus of the

00:20:08.156 --> 00:20:13.019
Environmental Protection Agency
has been a serious problem.

00:20:13.019 --> 00:20:15.558
If you gave me a sample of your
blood,

00:20:15.558 --> 00:20:17.086
of your urine,
of your hair,

00:20:17.086 --> 00:20:19.630
and we went down to CDC and had
it tested,

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.810
we would find a variety of
chemicals that come from the

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.358
built environment.
 

00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:29.306
So that the absence of
attention to where we spend our

00:20:29.306 --> 00:20:32.210
time, which is indoors,
is important.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:36.387
There was a new study that was
just released that announced

00:20:36.387 --> 00:20:40.782
that the average amount of time
spent by the nation's children

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:44.170
outdoors is now forty-two
minutes per week.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:48.270
The average amount of time that
children now spent in front of

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.700
electronic media is now
fifty-two hours per week.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.804
So there's something to that
statistic that is worth paying a

00:20:55.804 --> 00:20:57.308
lot of attention to.
 

00:20:57.308 --> 00:21:01.519
I'm here because my dad took me
hiking when I was a kid.

00:21:01.519 --> 00:21:03.359
He took me to parks.
 

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:05.000
We'd hang out by streams.
 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.140
He'd take me down to the beach.
 

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.306
But this is an increasingly
rare experience,

00:21:11.306 --> 00:21:15.209
as people are spending more
time indoors and more time

00:21:15.209 --> 00:21:17.859
staring at electronic equipment.
 

00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:21.659
Hazardous sites;
we are adding the number of

00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:25.438
hazardous sites to the lists
maintained by the government,

00:21:25.438 --> 00:21:29.348
the federal government and
state governments every year.

00:21:29.348 --> 00:21:32.568
So that we're not restoring
more than we're adding.

00:21:32.568 --> 00:21:34.578
And this is a very serious
problem.

00:21:34.578 --> 00:21:38.269
And the lessons of Vieques,
the long amount of time,

00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:41.598
the enormous resources
necessary to clean these

00:21:41.598 --> 00:21:44.492
facilities up,
now you should think about

00:21:44.492 --> 00:21:45.288
that.
 

00:21:45.288 --> 00:21:47.827
In five years,
in six years as you think about

00:21:47.827 --> 00:21:50.702
where you want to live,
where you're going to rent a

00:21:50.702 --> 00:21:52.170
house or an apartment.
 

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.410
You think about where you want
to buy a house or buy land,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.482
you should pay a lot of
attention to the land use

00:21:59.482 --> 00:22:03.132
history in these areas so that
you can be sure that you're

00:22:03.132 --> 00:22:06.588
buying land that was not
formerly a disposal site.

00:22:06.588 --> 00:22:10.521
Chemicals in commerce,
plastics in our bodies,

00:22:10.521 --> 00:22:15.590
and product labeling is really
one of the weakest among the

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.000
higher income nations in the
world.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.443
Another key issue that I'll
talk about a little bit more in

00:22:23.443 --> 00:22:26.970
a minute is what I call
narrative advantage.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:32.664
And if you think of the variety
of different sources of our

00:22:32.664 --> 00:22:36.632
confusion about what to buy,
how to behave,

00:22:36.632 --> 00:22:40.385
what energy consumption is
associated with the purchase of

00:22:40.385 --> 00:22:42.890
an apple as opposed to a
hamburger.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.348
As you think about how much we
don't know,

00:22:45.348 --> 00:22:49.599
think also about how much what
we do know and how our

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:54.176
impressions are created by the
narrative advantage of the

00:22:54.176 --> 00:22:55.240
powerful.
 

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.169
The narrative advantage of the
corporations as well as

00:22:58.169 --> 00:23:01.209
government, so that they are
basically framing the issue

00:23:01.209 --> 00:23:03.308
about what's worth worrying
about.

00:23:03.308 --> 00:23:08.652
I wanted to also say that we
did not have a chance to talk

00:23:08.652 --> 00:23:12.868
much about CO_2
trading programs.

00:23:12.868 --> 00:23:17.537
But we have a very active and
important one ongoing right here

00:23:17.537 --> 00:23:21.898
in Connecticut as we're part of
a ten-state plan to reduce

00:23:21.898 --> 00:23:26.950
CO_2 emissions from
the power plants in this region.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.923
And this was adopted as law in
nine of these states,

00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:34.068
but not in New York.
 

00:23:34.068 --> 00:23:35.710
And it's interesting that one
energy company,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.059
the Indeck Energy Company,
sued the State of New York for

00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:42.112
creating cap and trade
regulations with no statutory

00:23:42.112 --> 00:23:42.950
authority.
 

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.933
So could New York establish cap
and trade regulations and impose

00:23:46.933 --> 00:23:50.920
it on the utilities in its state
without statutory authority?

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.038
So this case is still pending.
 

00:23:53.038 --> 00:23:55.038
The other states have adopted
this approach.

00:23:55.038 --> 00:23:58.894
So that for all the utilities
or for the largest utilities

00:23:58.894 --> 00:24:02.210
that contribute CO_2
in this region,

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.608
there has been a ceiling that
has been established.

00:24:05.608 --> 00:24:11.010
And between now and 2012,
the ceiling will be stable and

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:17.002
then it will decline as total
amount of CO_2 emitted

00:24:17.002 --> 00:24:23.778
that's allowable will be reduced
and they will have to retrofit,

00:24:23.778 --> 00:24:26.159
they will have to fuel switch
in order to figure out how

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:27.759
they're going to meet that
ceiling.

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:29.608
It's a very important approach.
 

00:24:29.608 --> 00:24:34.303
So if you think back on what
are the key problems with our

00:24:34.303 --> 00:24:38.830
broad body of environmental law,
well, it's fractured by

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:39.818
problem.
 

00:24:39.818 --> 00:24:43.417
It's fractured by media,
by air, water,

00:24:43.417 --> 00:24:45.880
food, consumer products.
 

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.250
And often these problems
evolved case by case and

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.394
motivated political action in
individual states or motivated

00:24:53.394 --> 00:24:57.117
the legislators in those
individual states to approach

00:24:57.117 --> 00:25:01.402
Congress and suggest that this
is an example of a problem that

00:25:01.402 --> 00:25:04.907
exists in every state,
we should pass national law to

00:25:04.907 --> 00:25:05.440
address it.
 

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.288
But each law is set up very
differently.

00:25:08.288 --> 00:25:11.928
It was not set up based upon a
certain set of overriding

00:25:11.928 --> 00:25:15.700
guiding principles such as exist
in the European Union.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.420
And I'm going to make a few
comparisons in a few moments to

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.048
European environmental law by
contrast.

00:25:22.048 --> 00:25:23.990
It's fractured by level of
government,

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.536
so we have law that is
established by local

00:25:28.536 --> 00:25:31.234
governments,
state governments and the

00:25:31.234 --> 00:25:33.298
federal government that is often
incompatible,

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:37.480
and it's extremely confusing
for those that want to develop,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.450
such as the wind turbine farm,
Cape Wind up in Massachusetts.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.832
It's a classic example of
regulatory confusion and the

00:25:45.832 --> 00:25:49.470
litigation and delay and cost
that ensues.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:55.579
We have little surveillance at
the scale that's relevant to the

00:25:55.579 --> 00:25:58.508
individual,
and something that we have not

00:25:58.508 --> 00:26:01.451
spoken about that's really
important is that environmental

00:26:01.451 --> 00:26:04.548
monitoring responsibilities and
surveillance responsibilities

00:26:04.548 --> 00:26:07.594
have largely been delegated to
those that are regulated over

00:26:07.594 --> 00:26:11.259
the past several decades by the
Environmental Protection Agency.

00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:12.519
So that's an interesting idea.
 

00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:18.990
I mean, if you are say the
maker of benzene,

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.019
you are responsible to report
your benzene emissions from your

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:26.519
smokestacks to the Environmental
Protection Agency.

00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:29.460
There's no one else that is
independent that monitors it.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.467
Or is there no monitoring
equipment that reports directly

00:26:32.467 --> 00:26:34.670
to the Environmental Protection
Agency.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.767
So thinking about the way that
the surveillance system is set

00:26:37.767 --> 00:26:40.554
up is really critical to the
long-term effectiveness of

00:26:40.554 --> 00:26:41.690
environmental law.
 

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:46.740
The next point is the pace of
regulation.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.029
And I just mentioned the pace
of litigation a few moments ago.

00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:57.440
The pace of regulation is often
slower than litigation.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.638
So that you would want a system
ideally to be responsive to

00:27:02.638 --> 00:27:05.150
newfound evidence of risk.
 

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.833
So supposing I found that
chemical X in the food supply is

00:27:08.833 --> 00:27:12.452
exceptionally dangerous and
people are highly exposed and

00:27:12.452 --> 00:27:14.778
they've got it in their tissues.
 

00:27:14.778 --> 00:27:18.249
Well, following that discovery
and following a consensus among

00:27:18.249 --> 00:27:20.980
scientists that that is a
significant threat,

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.569
it normally takes ten to
fifteen, and I've seen twenty

00:27:24.569 --> 00:27:27.009
years with respect to
pesticides,

00:27:27.009 --> 00:27:30.751
before the government responds
and then changes the regulation

00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:34.494
to lower the allowable use of
the chemical or sets a different

00:27:34.494 --> 00:27:35.598
ceiling on it.
 

00:27:35.598 --> 00:27:40.279
And this basically-- law has
the effect then of providing a

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:43.670
false sense of security when you
think,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.769
my gosh, we have three dozen
statutes in place,

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:48.430
we must be reasonably well
protected as a society.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.636
Well, I think after this
course, you will be more

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:52.440
skeptical.
 

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.259
It's difficult and costly to
measure effectiveness.

00:27:56.259 --> 00:28:00.123
And when ineffectiveness is
found, agencies are not happy

00:28:00.123 --> 00:28:01.019
about that.
 

00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:05.837
So that that's why we have a
Government Accountability Office

00:28:05.837 --> 00:28:10.817
that commonly will look at the
behavior of agencies and whether

00:28:10.817 --> 00:28:15.555
or not the statute is achieving
the Congressionally mandated

00:28:15.555 --> 00:28:16.598
intent.
 

00:28:16.598 --> 00:28:20.259
Our law system is highly
specialized in the sciences,

00:28:20.259 --> 00:28:24.402
and it often takes scientific
training at a graduate level in

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:28.682
order to be able to debate about
the appropriateness of certain

00:28:28.682 --> 00:28:29.650
standards.
 

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:34.040
Similarly, if you're arguing
about the effect of human

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.769
development on endangered
species habitat,

00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:41.230
it takes expertise and biology,
often at the graduate level,

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.269
to get a seat at the table.
 

00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:44.750
So think about that.
 

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.336
If you're considering a future
in environmental management of

00:28:48.336 --> 00:28:51.385
one sort or another,
think about how you might shore

00:28:51.385 --> 00:28:53.240
up your technical capacity.
 

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.730
It's highly centralized in
decision-making.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.390
It's really difficult in order
to participate in decision

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.480
making at the federal level of
government.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.586
There are action channels and
there are groups of people that

00:29:05.586 --> 00:29:09.694
are well known to the regulators
that play a disproportionate

00:29:09.694 --> 00:29:13.940
role in making choices that have
a much more highly distributed

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.828
effect.
 

00:29:14.828 --> 00:29:18.932
So I'm not going to go through
all these different kinds of

00:29:18.932 --> 00:29:22.116
decision standards,
but we've touched on a variety

00:29:22.116 --> 00:29:25.154
of different approaches to
setting standards in different

00:29:25.154 --> 00:29:25.588
laws.
 

00:29:25.588 --> 00:29:28.492
Remember the federal
Insecticide, Fungicide,

00:29:28.492 --> 00:29:31.058
and Rodenticide Act at the top
here.

00:29:31.058 --> 00:29:33.009
It was a risk-benefit balancing
law.

00:29:33.009 --> 00:29:36.248
Think about the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act as it

00:29:36.248 --> 00:29:37.529
applies to drugs.
 

00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:39.460
That's a risk-risk tradeoff law.
 

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.588
So that a doctor prescribes the
drug to you because the doctor

00:29:43.588 --> 00:29:47.720
thinks that although there may
be a risk of a side effect,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.310
that the benefit to you is
higher, it's more significant

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.140
than the side effect risk.
 

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.880
Cost-benefit analysis is
another form of decision-making

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.618
analysis that is often demanded
in environmental law.

00:30:02.618 --> 00:30:05.960
Risk ceilings,
acceptable risk levels.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:10.809
I've seen acceptable risk
levels for cancer-causing agents

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:15.576
in the environment that vary
between one excess cancer is

00:30:15.576 --> 00:30:20.767
allowable per thousand people
exposed as opposed to a standard

00:30:20.767 --> 00:30:24.023
that would allow,
a California standard,

00:30:24.023 --> 00:30:26.509
one excess risk in a million
people exposed.

00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:30.960
And I've seen other proposals
for one in ten million.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.509
So that the idea of acceptable
risk is quite variable,

00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:37.339
and it can have an enormous
effect on the allowable

00:30:37.339 --> 00:30:40.680
concentration of a compound out
there in the environment.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.267
The sustainable yield
definition, there's the

00:30:43.267 --> 00:30:46.618
Multiple-Use and Sustainable
Yield Act that applies to the

00:30:46.618 --> 00:30:47.089
U.S.
 

00:30:47.089 --> 00:30:48.288
Forest Service.
 

00:30:48.288 --> 00:30:49.680
And this is a really
interesting idea as well.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.230
But it's technical.
 

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.785
So that one would have to look
at a national forest and figure

00:30:54.785 --> 00:30:57.348
out how much timber it normally
produces,

00:30:57.348 --> 00:31:01.866
how much could be harvested
without adversely affecting the

00:31:01.866 --> 00:31:04.358
sustained yield at that level.
 

00:31:04.358 --> 00:31:08.210
So being able to identify the
sustained yield and to develop

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:11.994
an understanding of how you go
into an area and you get the

00:31:11.994 --> 00:31:15.976
timber out without depleting the
soil resources say of organic

00:31:15.976 --> 00:31:18.513
matter,
water holding capacity,

00:31:18.513 --> 00:31:20.348
that's a technical issue.
 

00:31:20.348 --> 00:31:23.134
Density restrictions,
land use segregation,

00:31:23.134 --> 00:31:25.788
disclosure and transparency
requirements,

00:31:25.788 --> 00:31:29.900
certification requirements
inside the Food Production Act.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.963
The reasonable certainty of no
harm standard in the Food

00:31:32.963 --> 00:31:36.140
Quality Protection Act is the
most rigid health protective

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.868
standard that we've got in the
United States.

00:31:38.868 --> 00:31:42.416
It's as health protective as
any statute also in the European

00:31:42.416 --> 00:31:42.890
Union.
 

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.470
And also technological
feasibility.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.348
So what's feasible now as
opposed to technology forcing

00:31:50.348 --> 00:31:53.868
standards that would demand that
industry say,

00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:57.223
lower their auto emissions down
to a level that's not possible

00:31:57.223 --> 00:31:59.556
now,
but you give them a ceiling and

00:31:59.556 --> 00:32:03.450
say that you've got five years
to reach that reduced ceiling.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:07.984
Restricting false claims of
benefit or demanding expression

00:32:07.984 --> 00:32:10.410
of risk, so product labeling.
 

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.115
And then restoration standards
that exist inside the Resource

00:32:14.115 --> 00:32:17.450
Conservation and Recovery Act
and the Superfund law.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.189
So that there are different
forms of standards,

00:32:20.189 --> 00:32:23.346
different decision making
criteria and analyses across

00:32:23.346 --> 00:32:24.240
these laws.
 

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.532
I wanted to compare for just a
couple of minutes some key

00:32:27.532 --> 00:32:28.710
principles of law.
 

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.328
So I just said that U.S.
 

00:32:30.328 --> 00:32:33.753
law has evolved incrementally
in a patchwork quilt fashion

00:32:33.753 --> 00:32:37.057
with a variety of these
different standards that were in

00:32:37.057 --> 00:32:38.200
the last slide.
 

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.410
How about European law?
 

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.520
Well, European law evolved
based upon a collection of

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.740
principles, principles that are
not embedded in all of our laws.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.530
So we have no law in our
country that basically forces

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:58.684
the statute to comply with
principles such as exist in the

00:32:58.684 --> 00:32:59.680
EU law.
 

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.426
One is a high level of
protection is demanded,

00:33:03.426 --> 00:33:05.259
but not the highest.
 

00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:09.000
And this would force the
definition of what high means,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.910
and it has and it's produced
litigation.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:16.141
The precautionary principle
that despite uncertainty in the

00:33:16.141 --> 00:33:20.664
effect of timber harvesting on
endangered species habitat or of

00:33:20.664 --> 00:33:24.809
a chemical on human health,
despite the uncertainty,

00:33:24.809 --> 00:33:27.980
it is a better idea to be
precautionary,

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.960
to set a standard that would be
protective.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.057
And this is quite similar to
another principal that they call

00:33:34.057 --> 00:33:36.897
the prevention principle,
that prevention is better than

00:33:36.897 --> 00:33:37.568
the cure.
 

00:33:37.568 --> 00:33:41.138
And they also have the source
principle, that a problem should

00:33:41.138 --> 00:33:44.298
be managed at its source,
rather than down the road.

00:33:44.298 --> 00:33:47.640
So you know,
if you have a nasty pesticide,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.955
are you going to manage that
pesticide by allowing farmers to

00:33:51.955 --> 00:33:56.200
use it and then going out and
monitoring its presence in the

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.509
water supply or in the foods
that you eat?

00:33:59.509 --> 00:34:02.425
That's managing at the
downstream level,

00:34:02.425 --> 00:34:04.670
as opposed to at the source.
 

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.190
So nip it in the bud.
 

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.804
If it's a really dangerous
chemical, prohibit it or don't

00:34:09.804 --> 00:34:12.139
allow it to be used under
certain circumstances.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:16.527
The polluter pays principle
that dictates that polluters are

00:34:16.527 --> 00:34:20.989
financially responsible for the
pollution that they emit from

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:24.532
their smokestacks,
from their pipe,

00:34:24.532 --> 00:34:28.539
their waterline discharge
points,

00:34:28.539 --> 00:34:31.530
and that they are also
responsible for damages.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.260
And they're responsible for
coming up to solutions to the

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.820
problem that they're creating.
 

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.469
And also, that they are open to
liability claims.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:43.282
And finally,
the safeguard principle that

00:34:43.282 --> 00:34:47.221
member states in the European
Union have the authority to

00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:51.230
adopt tougher laws given their
particular conditions.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:54.210
Now, when I say that,
I know that these seem like

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.260
they're kind of dry principles.
 

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.532
But when I say that,
the bell that should be going

00:34:59.532 --> 00:35:03.740
off in your head is a bell about
preemption and how important it

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.280
is to think carefully about
when,

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.240
under what circumstance do you
want to preempt a lower level of

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.641
government,
say France, from adopting a

00:35:11.641 --> 00:35:15.039
tougher level of regulation than
the European Union?

00:35:15.039 --> 00:35:18.108
Or when do you want to have
California be given the

00:35:18.108 --> 00:35:21.914
authority to adopt tougher air
quality regs as opposed to those

00:35:21.914 --> 00:35:23.880
that are established by EPA?
 

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.605
So that the safeguard principle
cuts across all European law

00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:31.329
that gives the member nations
the authority to set standards

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.730
that are tougher than the
Union's.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:37.637
I want to talk just a couple of
minutes about poverty and the

00:35:37.637 --> 00:35:38.550
environment.
 

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.969
And we haven't spent much time
on that during the course.

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:45.125
But the impoverished in the
world generally face degraded

00:35:45.125 --> 00:35:49.280
environmental conditions
compared to the more wealthy.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.030
And these are often ignored by
governments.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.150
Exposures to hazards are
normally higher.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.530
The poorest are left to the
most marginal lands.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.289
It's kind of interesting to
watch what happens in a town,

00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:04.434
even in Connecticut,
when developers have built on

00:36:04.434 --> 00:36:09.132
all of the really nice lands,
and then you have the old down

00:36:09.132 --> 00:36:10.592
dump,
the landfill,

00:36:10.592 --> 00:36:14.349
that nobody wanted to live near
and remained undeveloped.

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:17.427
But as the towns reach build
out, meaning that all the other

00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:20.400
lands have been developed to the
zoning density limit,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.025
then increasingly,
you see lower income people

00:36:25.025 --> 00:36:27.699
moving into those areas.
 

00:36:27.699 --> 00:36:31.445
There was the Bhopal,
India chemical release back in

00:36:31.445 --> 00:36:35.485
1984 that killed tens of
thousands of people and injured

00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:38.130
hundreds of thousands of others.
 

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:43.057
Those people had basically
migrated next to the chemical

00:36:43.057 --> 00:36:48.344
company and set up camps that
made them immediately adjacent

00:36:48.344 --> 00:36:51.929
to the edge of the chemical
company.

00:36:51.929 --> 00:36:55.518
And that history,
I encourage you to take a look

00:36:55.518 --> 00:36:56.130
at it.
 

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:01.001
The chemical release of methyl
isocyanate killed or injured

00:37:01.001 --> 00:37:06.126
people in a matter of several
hours because they were so close

00:37:06.126 --> 00:37:09.230
to the plant,
there was no buffer zone to it.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:14.170
So the poor tend not to have
access to capital.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.969
They tend not to have insurance.
 

00:37:15.969 --> 00:37:18.900
They tend not to have the
capacity to understand and to

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.179
manage risk the way that the
wealthy do.

00:37:21.179 --> 00:37:23.737
Healthcare surveillance is
something that they cannot

00:37:23.737 --> 00:37:24.179
afford.
 

00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:28.840
And litigation is rarely an
opportunity.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.954
So as you think about the
relationship between

00:37:33.954 --> 00:37:40.775
environmental problems and the
fascination and the drive that

00:37:40.775 --> 00:37:45.666
our nation has to grow,
to produce more,

00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:49.829
to consume more,
to become wealthier,

00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:53.480
I want you to think more
carefully about this.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.690
I want you to think about
whether or not this fascination

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.530
with growth,
of bigger is better,

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:05.659
really is something that we
need to confront more directly.

00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:11.353
The ethical effects of pursuing
more, more wealth,

00:38:11.353 --> 00:38:15.768
really have a variety of
dimensions.

00:38:15.768 --> 00:38:19.219
So that as you think about your
own behavior,

00:38:19.219 --> 00:38:21.572
your own pattern of
consumption, if you think about

00:38:21.572 --> 00:38:23.880
whether or not you really need
that next iPod,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.849
the next iPhone,
or the next iPhone app.

00:38:27.849 --> 00:38:31.182
If you think about the kinds of
foods you want to buy in the

00:38:31.182 --> 00:38:34.347
marketplace and you start
thinking about these as ethical

00:38:34.347 --> 00:38:37.737
choices and about how they may
cause a distributional pattern

00:38:37.737 --> 00:38:40.846
of costs and benefits out in
ways that may not be easily

00:38:40.846 --> 00:38:41.920
identified.
 

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.987
So as wealth increases,
the opposite argument might go,

00:38:47.987 --> 00:38:50.460
so do the following.
 

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.349
Control over modes of
production, control over labor

00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:56.918
and providing labor with certain
rights that they might not have

00:38:56.918 --> 00:39:00.543
had so wealthier nations tend to
have higher protective standards

00:39:00.543 --> 00:39:01.449
for labor.
 

00:39:01.449 --> 00:39:05.000
They have higher standards for
the control of materials.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.085
There's another mode of
production, component of the

00:39:08.085 --> 00:39:10.989
mode of production,
as well as regulations on the

00:39:10.989 --> 00:39:12.139
use of capital.
 

00:39:12.139 --> 00:39:16.074
And the wealthier nations in
the world also have more control

00:39:16.074 --> 00:39:19.420
and accountability that's
demanded of government.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:24.731
They have higher education,
higher capacity to identify

00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:25.420
risk.
 

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.989
And as wealth increases,
environmental controls,

00:39:28.989 --> 00:39:30.980
regulations become more
sophisticated,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.190
as does the capacity to buy
insurance,

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:37.461
access to health care,
and the capacity to select

00:39:37.461 --> 00:39:39.030
risks and avoid them.
 

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.570
So one idea,
thinking about whether or not

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.420
there is a trickle-down effect.
 

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.532
So as the world becomes
wealthier, as the high income

00:39:48.532 --> 00:39:51.724
nations become wealthier,
is there going to be a

00:39:51.724 --> 00:39:55.322
trickle-down effect,
or should we systematically

00:39:55.322 --> 00:39:58.949
think about how we might
redistribute wealth,

00:39:58.949 --> 00:40:01.800
knowledge, authority and a
sense of a collective ethic?

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.721
And will this be a stairway to
improved environmental quality

00:40:06.721 --> 00:40:08.280
and human health?
 

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:14.528
I wanted to just mention too,
and emphasize this idea once

00:40:14.528 --> 00:40:20.449
more of narrative advantage and
how critical it is,

00:40:20.449 --> 00:40:23.599
given the scale of money that's
being put into advertising.

00:40:23.599 --> 00:40:27.509
So half a trillion dollars per
year in the world going into

00:40:27.509 --> 00:40:30.405
advertising,
promoting products,

00:40:30.405 --> 00:40:35.960
promoting economic growth and
making claims about product

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:42.210
benefits and normally not fully
disclosing what product risks or

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:46.179
product long-term damages might
be.

00:40:46.179 --> 00:40:50.554
We talked on many occasions in
the course about the idea of

00:40:50.554 --> 00:40:54.779
ignorance as being an underlying
source for environmental

00:40:54.779 --> 00:40:55.760
problems.
 

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.059
So I don't mean ignorance in a
demeaning way at all.

00:41:00.059 --> 00:41:04.420
I don't mean it to infer the
absence of capacity.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:09.423
I mean it to infer the absence
of knowledge or the incapacity

00:41:09.423 --> 00:41:13.927
to develop that knowledge but
for no reason of personal

00:41:13.927 --> 00:41:16.679
problem, personal incapacity.
 

00:41:16.679 --> 00:41:18.280
So what are the underlying
sources?

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.300
Well, illiteracy is clearly one
of them.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.824
Secrecy is another,
deception is another,

00:41:22.824 --> 00:41:25.349
privacy is another,
language barriers.

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:29.813
But I'm increasingly fascinated
by the idea that legal control

00:41:29.813 --> 00:41:33.836
of knowledge in the form of
trade secrecy and classified

00:41:33.836 --> 00:41:38.300
information are really critical
targets that we need to manage

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.543
more effectively in order to
create a literate society that

00:41:42.543 --> 00:41:47.152
might be able to participate in
markets as well as in government

00:41:47.152 --> 00:41:51.324
decision-making in ways that
will lead us to a more health

00:41:51.324 --> 00:41:54.436
protective,
environmentally responsible

00:41:54.436 --> 00:41:54.840
future.
 

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.360
So secrecy has a very insidious
and negative effect.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.630
And we've seen it in a variety
of cases.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:04.070
It concentrates knowledge among
those with authority and power.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:07.139
It actually is a form of social
control.

00:42:07.139 --> 00:42:11.025
So if I have knowledge and I
withhold for you because it

00:42:11.025 --> 00:42:15.619
basically will prevent you from
being able to compete with me,

00:42:15.619 --> 00:42:20.079
then that basically is a form
of-- its authority,

00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:22.530
it's power for me to be able to
control you.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.563
Secrecy inhibits public
intelligence,

00:42:24.563 --> 00:42:27.159
and it enhances the persuasive
power of elites,

00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:29.420
again providing narrative
advantage.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:33.099
Throughout the course,
across all of these cases,

00:42:33.099 --> 00:42:36.791
I have mentioned the importance
of looking at distributional

00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:40.610
effects and avoiding what I call
here the veil of averages.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:45.079
If you allow yourself to be
convinced of arguments based

00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:50.119
upon statistical claims of the
effect on average is going to be

00:42:50.119 --> 00:42:52.931
X,
or even the benefits on average

00:42:52.931 --> 00:42:57.750
are going to be Y,
then you should not do that.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.150
You should think much more
carefully and deeply about

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.860
distributional patterns in
society.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.420
How is risk distributed?
 

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.090
How are benefits distributed?
 

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.170
Is there an overlap among the
risks and the benefits?

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:12.025
Do we want to structure law in
a way that encourages that to be

00:43:12.025 --> 00:43:13.829
transparent and overlapped?
 

00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:18.146
So I'm going to close here,
and I'm going to just take a

00:43:18.146 --> 00:43:21.195
little bit of license,
and I apologize for this,

00:43:21.195 --> 00:43:23.239
because you may think of me as
being paternal.

00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:29.786
But this class represents,
I believe, a class where I've

00:43:29.786 --> 00:43:34.429
now taught about 2,500 Yale
students.

00:43:34.429 --> 00:43:40.210
And this has given me a
perspective on the success of my

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:44.518
students as I watch them down
the road.

00:43:44.518 --> 00:43:49.152
What careers they take,
how they come back and want

00:43:49.152 --> 00:43:50.820
recommendations.
 

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:56.099
But also want to let me know
that they're taking some ideas

00:43:56.099 --> 00:43:57.920
into their future.
 

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.820
So what advice could I give you?
 

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:04.775
Well, I would encourage you to
think really carefully about

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:06.550
what drives you morally.
 

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:10.159
What are your dominant moral
values?

00:44:10.159 --> 00:44:12.449
And I've got kids your age.
 

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:14.795
I say that to them,
"Give me your top five

00:44:14.795 --> 00:44:16.018
dominant moral values.
 

00:44:16.018 --> 00:44:21.052
And learn to understand how
those values might guide your

00:44:21.052 --> 00:44:22.670
behaviors."
 

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:28.820
And in my life,
I've often concluded that boy,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.344
if I'd just listened to that
inner voice that would have told

00:44:32.344 --> 00:44:35.693
me what the right thing to do
was and it would have been a

00:44:35.693 --> 00:44:36.869
better decision.
 

00:44:36.869 --> 00:44:41.869
So learn to trust your
instincts about what's really

00:44:41.869 --> 00:44:44.320
important in your life.
 

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.159
It's not just about getting
richer.

00:44:46.159 --> 00:44:49.920
Learn yourself and then teach
others.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.981
You're at one of the most
prestigious and one of the best

00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:56.152
educational institutions in the
world and it's just such an

00:44:56.152 --> 00:44:58.559
incredible privilege for you to
be here.

00:44:58.559 --> 00:45:01.873
But I think now about it,
the educational experience that

00:45:01.873 --> 00:45:04.606
you're getting,
not in my course,

00:45:04.606 --> 00:45:08.260
but in better courses,
as a privilege,

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:13.639
as something that really you
have an obligation to carry on,

00:45:13.639 --> 00:45:16.840
to expand the knowledge of
other people.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.739
Lead by example.
 

00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:20.469
Don't just tell people what to
do.

00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:23.398
People see you being focused
and disciplined and taking on

00:45:23.398 --> 00:45:26.429
the toughest and meanest and
nastiest and dirtiest jobs,

00:45:26.429 --> 00:45:28.500
they're going to respect that
and they're going to follow you.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.050
So focus and discipline is
really a key to success.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:36.454
I would encourage you to reduce
your access, your reliance on

00:45:36.454 --> 00:45:37.849
electronic media.
 

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:44.304
I see students walking down the
road holding their cell phones

00:45:44.304 --> 00:45:48.960
in front of them,
no conversations at all.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.615
I mean, the value of
conversation is enormous

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:54.755
compared to the value of
communication via electronic

00:45:54.755 --> 00:45:55.360
media.
 

00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:00.588
Body language,
understanding how emotion and

00:46:00.588 --> 00:46:05.329
rationality are mixed up in
language.

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:08.983
You don't get that from
Twitter, you don't get that from

00:46:08.983 --> 00:46:10.179
emailing people.
 

00:46:10.179 --> 00:46:13.391
So I'd encourage you to think
carefully about the amount of

00:46:13.391 --> 00:46:15.829
time that you spend your life in
that way.

00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:18.650
I worry a lot about what's
going to happen in future

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.967
generations because of the way
that your generation and those

00:46:21.967 --> 00:46:23.960
younger are spending their time.
 

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.500
Not going out,
not experiencing the wild,

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.469
not experiencing the natural.
 

00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:31.545
I mean, I can't imagine that
people would have the passion to

00:46:31.545 --> 00:46:34.159
care about the wild and the
natural or the pure,

00:46:34.159 --> 00:46:37.487
the chemical free,
if they had not experienced it

00:46:37.487 --> 00:46:38.389
themselves.
 

00:46:38.389 --> 00:46:42.074
And that's the reason that I
take my classes out to the

00:46:42.074 --> 00:46:43.030
Adirondacks.
 

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:47.311
Or I've taken them to Wyoming
or to other places,

00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:52.130
because many people just don't
have that experience.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:55.355
They were not lucky enough to
have the experience I had when I

00:46:55.355 --> 00:46:55.989
was a kid.
 

00:46:55.989 --> 00:46:58.599
Consume what you need.
 

00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:00.820
Think really carefully about
what you need.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:04.469
And how much space do you need?
 

00:47:04.469 --> 00:47:07.965
My argument with Kroon Hall,
how much cubic feet of space do

00:47:07.965 --> 00:47:11.519
you really need per person in
Kroon Hall as I look up at that

00:47:11.519 --> 00:47:13.179
forty-foot high ceiling.
 

00:47:13.179 --> 00:47:14.130
Yes, it's grand.
 

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:16.164
Architecturally,
it's a wonderful esthetic

00:47:16.164 --> 00:47:16.809
experience.
 

00:47:16.809 --> 00:47:20.295
But in the new age of being
concerned about energy

00:47:20.295 --> 00:47:24.208
consumption and renewables,
is that a luxury that we can

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:25.489
really afford?
 

00:47:25.489 --> 00:47:27.400
Know what you're consuming.
 

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.300
If anything,
you should walk away from this

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.199
course being skeptical about
this issue.

00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:34.610
It's hard to do.
 

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:35.929
What's in your environment?
 

00:47:35.929 --> 00:47:38.679
What do you need to protect
yourself against?

00:47:38.679 --> 00:47:40.070
Drive less.
 

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:42.130
Self-propel yourself more.
 

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.875
It's not only good for the
climate, it's great for your

00:47:45.875 --> 00:47:46.500
health.
 

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.632
You'll remember the design of
that Centers for Disease Control

00:47:49.632 --> 00:47:52.610
building, specifically designed
with that staircase that is

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:53.329
beautiful.
 

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:56.393
A beautiful staircase with
light glass panes going up the

00:47:56.393 --> 00:47:59.458
side of the stairwell that
encourages everybody to get to

00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:02.688
their office up on the seventh
or eighth floor by walking up

00:48:02.688 --> 00:48:06.025
the steps as opposed to taking
the elevator that's in the back

00:48:06.025 --> 00:48:07.340
of the building.
 

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.340
Become politically active
regardless of your party.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.768
Show up.
 

00:48:11.768 --> 00:48:15.557
It's really pretty remarkable,
and I hesitate to say this in a

00:48:15.557 --> 00:48:19.161
class where I know a bunch of
you have not shown up all the

00:48:19.161 --> 00:48:19.719
time.
 

00:48:19.719 --> 00:48:22.304
But a lot of success is
involved in the social

00:48:22.304 --> 00:48:25.695
relationships that you develop
just by showing up and paying

00:48:25.695 --> 00:48:26.500
attention.
 

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.356
You know, I have thought long
and hard whether or not I wanted

00:48:30.356 --> 00:48:33.771
to adopt Harvard Law School's
prohibition of the use of

00:48:33.771 --> 00:48:37.320
laptops in the classroom,
and I've decided not to do that.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:42.204
So I mean, I figure that if I
can't engage you in a lecture,

00:48:42.204 --> 00:48:46.594
and if I regulate your use of
laptop, then I shouldn't

00:48:46.594 --> 00:48:47.920
regulate it.
 

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.286
But I also feel that those of
you that are not paying

00:48:52.286 --> 00:48:56.483
attention, you know,
there are probably some pretty

00:48:56.483 --> 00:48:58.500
good reasons for it.
 

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.657
And the most important lesson I
think I have for you is to be

00:49:01.657 --> 00:49:03.079
confident about yourself.
 

00:49:03.079 --> 00:49:08.456
And I want you to think about
this one really carefully

00:49:08.456 --> 00:49:14.731
because my belief is really that
you wouldn't be here at Yale if

00:49:14.731 --> 00:49:20.110
you did not have the capacity to
change the world.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:23.440
Now, you know how many Yale
leaders have had enormous

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.003
influence in corporations,
in government,

00:49:26.003 --> 00:49:27.989
in the nonprofit community.
 

00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:32.340
So that capacity,
it's an enormous gift.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:36.327
And I'll leave you with one
final reflection is that you may

00:49:36.327 --> 00:49:39.840
think it's really hard to induce
change in the world,

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:40.989
but it's not.
 

00:49:40.989 --> 00:49:42.380
It's really not.
 

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.192
If you demonstrate your
passion, you develop the

00:49:45.192 --> 00:49:48.423
knowledge, you develop a
coalition, you can make change

00:49:48.423 --> 00:49:50.280
at any level of government.
 

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.750
So be confident about yourself
and go in peace.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.630
So thank you very much for a
great term.

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:07.000

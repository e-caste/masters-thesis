00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.447
Prof: Okay,
I'm going to talk about

00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:06.890
Napoleon today.
 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.678
It was about maybe ten years
ago, before the French Open,

00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:20.830
the tennis tournament that BNP
puts on every late spring.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.491
They took one of the American
players, a female player,

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:29.980
on a quick limousine tour of
Paris for a full day.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.688
At the end a French host asked
her, "What did you like

00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:39.330
best about the tour of
Paris?"

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.613
She said, "The best thing
was the tomb of the little dead

00:00:44.613 --> 00:00:45.740
dude."
 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.460
I couldn't make that out.
 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.894
Napoleon continues to
fascinate, though not

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:54.690
necessarily me.
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.624
The coverage in what you're
reading is straightforward,

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:02.340
so today I'm going to talk
about a couple themes.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.456
First of all,
what remained Corsican about

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:08.828
Napoleon?
 

00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:14.769
Then maybe discuss a question
raised by David Bell of late.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:18.549
Was the Revolutionary period,
and particularly Napoleon,

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.052
the first total war,
in the sense that

00:01:22.052 --> 00:01:26.185
twentieth-century folks--and at
least you were born in the

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:29.519
twentieth century--have come to
understand?

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:36.229
In the end--not ramble a bit,
but just talk about what the

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.879
most important contributions of
Napoleon were.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:47.575
Somebody counted up,
not me, that by 1980 there had

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:54.522
been at least 220,000 books and
articles published on Napoleon

00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:57.940
in a variety of languages.
 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.004
Three recent books,
if you're Napoleon buffs or

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:05.507
simply want to read about him,
that are quite good in English

00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:08.500
are my old friend Steven
Englund's book,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.628
Napoleon:
a Political History,

00:02:11.628 --> 00:02:15.169
which came out three or four
years ago and was recently

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.810
translated into French.
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.494
Phillip Dwyer's book on
Napoleon up to 1799--Phillip

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:28.067
Dwyer hates Napoleon,
but it's a pretty interesting

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:31.300
look at the early career.
 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.411
Finally, I suppose most
controversially,

00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:38.001
David Bell's book,
The First Total War,

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.229
which I'll discuss some of the
themes in a while.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:49.001
It was only about six or seven
years ago, I remember this,

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:56.008
they discovered in Lithuania a
whole bunch of dead bones.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.800
Well, bones are dead,
I guess, if they've been there

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.819
for 200 years,
or whatever.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.181
But not of a gravesite,
because they were never

00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:06.617
properly buried,
but a place where expired in

00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:12.691
the snows of 1812 a good number
of soldiers of Napoleon's Grande

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:18.409
Armée,
the grand army;

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.479
and, so, 1812 still goes on.
 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.399
There is a book,
also an interesting book if

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:31.337
you're looking for paper topics,
that I sometimes assign in the

00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:35.580
French course called Diary of
a Napoleonic Foot Soldier.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.782
By the time of 1812,
the majority of the Grande

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:43.424
Armée were really people
who had been conscripted or

00:03:43.424 --> 00:03:47.470
impounded, if you will,
in various allied states.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.640
But it's a quite interesting
account of what it was like in

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.258
Napoleon's armies as he invaded
further and further into Eastern

00:03:58.258 --> 00:03:59.240
Europe.
 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.590
By the way, I just did a
subject search on Napoleon once.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.360
I don't know why.
 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.046
But, of the 220,000 books,
you probably will want to not

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:18.427
read the tantalizing 1894
classic Napoleon and the Fair

00:04:18.427 --> 00:04:21.086
Sex,
or Napoleon and His Women

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.093
Friends,
which was from 1927,

00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:25.019
Napoleon in Love,
1959.

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:32.540
There are lots of those,
and Napoleon Seen by a

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.759
Canadian,
published in 1937.

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.879
I talk a lot about Napoleon's
life in the textbook,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.329
but let's look at the theme of
Napoleon and Corsica.

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:52.812
I once took a whole flock of
Yale alumni to see Napoleon's

00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:57.476
house in Ajaccio,
where he was born on the

00:04:57.476 --> 00:04:59.980
15^(th) of August.
 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.966
He wrote in a letter to the
Corsican patriot with whom he

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:07.550
subsequently broke,
Paoli,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.509
he wrote on the 12^(th) of June
1789,

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.678
"I was born when the
French were vomited upon our

00:05:13.678 --> 00:05:16.430
coasts,"
that is the coast of Corsica,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.819
"drowning in the throne of
liberty and torrents of blood.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.410
Such was the odious spectacle
that first met my eyes.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.865
The cries of the dying,
the groans of the oppressed,

00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:35.069
tears of despair surrounded my
cradle at my birth."

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.093
Corsica, as I'm sure you know,
is an island,

00:05:38.093 --> 00:05:39.149
a big island.
 

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:44.180
It's north of Sardinia,
which belongs to Italy.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.598
He, at first gloried in his
Corsican origins,

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:53.519
hating the French who had
conquered his island.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.134
Of course, the French
Revolution would change all

00:05:55.134 --> 00:05:55.370
that.
 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.845
That's why it's a good idea to
look at him, as you look at

00:05:58.845 --> 00:06:01.892
Robespierre and others,
and see what difference the

00:06:01.892 --> 00:06:03.540
French Revolution made.
 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.028
Between 1785--and here I'm
drawing on Dwyer--and 1795,

00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:11.870
that is between the age of 16
and 26,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.629
he wrote a number of notes,
and sketches,

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.617
and short stories that reveal
much about his attachment to

00:06:19.617 --> 00:06:22.987
Corsica,
but also that suggest the

00:06:22.987 --> 00:06:28.956
dramatic nature of the change as
he embraces the Revolution and

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:29.920
France.
 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.420
He spoke Corsican and not
French.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.740
French was his second language.
 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.069
Corsican is a language.
 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:43.598
It's a patois that is more
closely tied to a patois or

00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:46.519
dialect of northern Italy.
 

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:50.788
In fact, when you drive around
Corsica, most of the radio

00:06:50.788 --> 00:06:54.980
stations that you can get are
Italian and not French.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.319
He learned French and he made
errors.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:00.725
Even at the end of his life he
made errors in French,

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:03.019
though he wrote French very
well.

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:07.759
He was bilingual,
but he never lost his accent.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.901
One of the things about
northern French people,

00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:13.908
in particular,
is that they're less likely to

00:07:13.908 --> 00:07:15.889
forgive southern accents.
 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:18.788
Of course, one of the
stereotypes of Corsicans is they

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:20.540
all become policemen in Paris.
 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.129
Many of them have an
"i"

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:25.720
at the end of their last names.
 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.269
They have a very strong
southern French accent.

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:34.665
It's not really a Toulouse
accent or our part of France,

00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:38.000
an Ardèche accent,
where you can always tell.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.180
Those of you who know
French--and again,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.821
if you don't know French it
doesn't make the slightest bit

00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:42.521
of difference--but somebody who
says "quatre-

00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:43.471
vaigne"
instead of

00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:46.339
quatre-vingt,
or "Cassaigne"

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:50.952
instead of the great human
rights advocate René

00:07:50.952 --> 00:07:53.107
Cassin,
or "vigne,"

00:07:53.107 --> 00:07:54.999
a glass of wine,
moi, je prends un verre de

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:59.149
vigne,
instead of vin.

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:02.726
It's a famous story about
Napoleon when he goes off to

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:06.776
military school as a very young
boy that they made fun of his

00:08:06.776 --> 00:08:07.519
accent.
 

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:09.490
More about that in a while.
 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.435
But anyway, at the beginning he
hated the French and espoused

00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:17.240
the fact that he was a Corsican.
 

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.232
He felt culturally marginal and
this was compounded by his

00:08:22.232 --> 00:08:24.160
personal loneliness.
 

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.509
When he was assigned to
Valence,

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:30.149
which could make anyone sort of
mildly depressed,

00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:34.759
Valence on the Rhone River,
he contemplated suicide quite

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:35.908
seriously.
 

00:08:35.908 --> 00:08:42.261
He spent a lot of time reading
and sort of hanging out by

00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:49.408
himself and through much of his
early days he lacked friends.

00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:53.918
In 1768, Corsica,
which had been part of the

00:08:53.918 --> 00:08:57.779
Republic of Genoa,
that is the port city of Genoa,

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:00.740
en face,
just across the sea,

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.250
gave up Corsica to France or,
really, sold it.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.119
The French state actively
worked to try to create a loyal

00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:10.951
Corsican nobility,
and thus, the family of

00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:12.909
Napoleon,
the Bonapartes,

00:09:12.909 --> 00:09:19.495
B-O-N-A-P-A-R-T-E-S,
who had a "u"

00:09:19.495 --> 00:09:23.491
that he subsequently took out
of his name in the first four

00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:28.207
letters,
were ennobled in 1771 by the

00:09:28.207 --> 00:09:29.320
French.
 

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.320
But all nobles aren't rich,
as you know.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.827
He was sort of what you'd call
in French un hobereau,

00:09:35.827 --> 00:09:36.720
a poor noble.
 

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.313
Four of Carlo--that is his
dad--Bonaparte's eight children

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:43.090
received scholarships to study
in France,

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.095
including Napoleon,
who was sent to a place called

00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:50.000
Brienne,
in the north of France.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.455
Fifty of the 110 students in
this school were called

00:09:53.455 --> 00:09:55.418
"royal scholars."
 

00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:59.803
Here again, here's kind of a
comparison to that case of

00:09:59.803 --> 00:10:05.000
downward mobility--Robespierre,
who is also a scholarship guy.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.062
There was nothing wrong with
that at all, except that there

00:10:10.062 --> 00:10:13.642
were a lot of fancy noble
offspring there,

00:10:13.642 --> 00:10:17.918
too, who had another reason to
mock Napoleon.

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:21.759
He wrote in Valance,
when he was posted to Valance,

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:26.138
again on the Rhone River about
an hour now by car south of

00:10:26.138 --> 00:10:26.830
Lyon.
 

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.524
He wrote that life was a
burden, "because there's no

00:10:30.524 --> 00:10:31.250
pleasure.
 

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.149
It is nothing but pain.
 

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:37.106
It is a burden because the men
and women with whom I live and

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:40.865
probably will always have to
live have customs that are as

00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:44.756
far from mine as the light of
the moon is different from the

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:46.668
light of the sun."
 

00:10:46.668 --> 00:10:50.879
But yet there was French
influence in his life.

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:52.980
He read the philosophes.
 

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.918
He read Rousseau,
Voltaire, Montesquieu,

00:10:56.918 --> 00:10:59.058
and in 1791,
again, I don't want to push

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:02.187
this comparison because he was
different in many ways than

00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:04.861
Robespierre,
but like Robespierre he enters

00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:08.230
an essay contest sponsored by an
académie,

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:13.200
in this case the
Académie of Lyon.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.210
His writings mostly reflect an
obsession with his origins.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.313
I haven't read a lot of his
early writings,

00:11:22.313 --> 00:11:24.658
but Phillip Dwyer has.
 

00:11:24.658 --> 00:11:29.821
One of his colleagues in school
drew a cartoon of Napoleon

00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:34.620
rushing to Corsica to aid the
Corsican rebel Paoli.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.970
He must have discussed this
with his friend.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.879
And he also battled with those
he saw as his rivals.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:43.250
A long time ago,
in the 1920s I guess it was,

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.480
the producer Abel Gance
produced this three-and-a-half

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.682
hour film,
which actually is extremely

00:11:49.682 --> 00:11:52.037
boring,
called Napoleon,

00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:53.320
without sound.
 

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.399
But the most famous scene in it
arguably is a snowball fight,

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.759
where Napoleon takes a snowball
fight to a more serious

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:02.847
dimension,
and tries out tactics,

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.610
and all of this.
 

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:09.899
In a way, he's fighting for his
independence and the status as a

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:14.288
non-French Corsican,
but who has been washed up on

00:12:14.288 --> 00:12:17.340
the shores of France by a
fortune,

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.740
good or bad.
 

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.830
At that point he wasn't really
too sure what it was.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.490
He began to write a history of
Corsica less than 100 pages,

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.590
which he took seriously enough
to begin to revise in the early

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.009
1790s after the French
Revolution.

00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:37.686
In it, according to Phillip
Dwyer, he portrays Corsicans as

00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:41.235
courageous, even heroic in
throwing off the rule of Genoa

00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:43.009
and battling the French.
 

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:44.976
"For over twenty-four
centuries,"

00:12:44.976 --> 00:12:47.139
he wrote,
"the same scenes have been

00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:50.149
repeated without interruption,
the same vicissitudes,

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:52.809
the same misfortunes,
but also the same courage,

00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:58.259
the same resolution,
the same audacity."

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:01.511
But his letters and his
writings reveal the folks that

00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:03.168
he was reading,
that is,

00:13:03.168 --> 00:13:08.511
the influence of the
philosophes portraying

00:13:08.511 --> 00:13:14.509
Corsica seeking liberty in the
shadow of oppression,

00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:17.120
in opposition to royal
authority.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:24.431
So, he links the themes of the
philosophes in defense of

00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:27.970
Corsica's fight for freedom.
 

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.923
Even in the 1790s,
if this interpretation is

00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:37.072
correct, he did not see his
identity as both Corsican and

00:13:37.072 --> 00:13:40.289
French, but rather as Corsican.
 

00:13:40.289 --> 00:13:45.738
But by 1799,
when he with the help of the

00:13:45.738 --> 00:13:50.301
wily Abbé
Sieyès comes to power on

00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:54.629
the 18^(th) of Brumaire,
the French identity had

00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:57.080
overwhelmed his Corsican
identity.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.322
The question is,
did he merely catch the nearest

00:13:59.322 --> 00:13:59.610
way?
 

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.399
Is it opportunism?
 

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:07.907
Or was it his belief that the
French Revolution and la

00:14:07.907 --> 00:14:13.948
belle France offered
liberating possibilities for

00:14:13.948 --> 00:14:15.460
humanity?
 

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.870
In a short story that he wrote
in the summer of 1789,

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.080
a rather important summer,
the French were portrayed as

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.065
tyrants,
still--in his story called the

00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:31.330
Nouvelle Corse or the New
Corsica.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.162
He used violence,
and his life would be one

00:14:35.162 --> 00:14:40.364
characterized by violence,
as a way of increasing sympathy

00:14:40.364 --> 00:14:42.918
for the Corsican people.
 

00:14:42.918 --> 00:14:45.960
Also it was a cultural
expression of Corsican

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.788
vengeance.
 

00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:50.048
Corsica, because of--this isn't
just a stereotype,

00:14:50.048 --> 00:14:53.933
but because of the sort of
flashing knives of clan and

00:14:53.933 --> 00:14:56.836
family rivalries,
there were so many crimes in

00:14:56.836 --> 00:14:59.453
Corsica in the nineteenth
century that the island of

00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:01.902
Corsica,
which became a department,

00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:04.302
now it's two,
but one of the departments of

00:15:04.302 --> 00:15:06.923
France,
had to be excluded when

00:15:06.923 --> 00:15:10.470
somebody was doing a study of
crime.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.590
There are so many more crimes
in Corsica.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.686
In fact, still their tradition
of flashing knives--and the

00:15:16.686 --> 00:15:20.927
Corsican independence movement
still places bombs--there are

00:15:20.927 --> 00:15:24.160
various independence
movements--and blows up a

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.028
lotissement,
a housing development being

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:31.210
built for Parisian or Marseilles
lawyers,

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.490
or something like that.
 

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:37.100
There are still these kinds of
resentments.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.402
In the beginning he's still
identified with Paoli,

00:15:40.402 --> 00:15:42.558
but he would break with Paoli.
 

00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:47.785
Paoli, the Corsican patriot,
was sort of seen as the George

00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:50.220
Washington of his island.
 

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.110
Napoleon was constructing a
vision of what he thought he

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:59.647
could become--that is,
to help liberate Corsica from

00:15:59.647 --> 00:16:01.070
French rule.
 

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.080
How ironic!
 

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.554
His father, Carlo,
had in his own view,

00:16:06.554 --> 00:16:12.913
that is Napoleon's view,
betrayed the Corsican cause by

00:16:12.913 --> 00:16:16.330
going over to the French.
 

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.726
In a way, you could argue that
he's rebelling against his

00:16:20.726 --> 00:16:23.788
father, at least in the early
stages.

00:16:23.788 --> 00:16:26.918
But the Revolution did bring a
change, obviously.

00:16:26.918 --> 00:16:30.278
It transformed the relations
between France and Corsica.

00:16:30.278 --> 00:16:35.239
In 1789 there were four
deputies elected to the Estates

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:37.745
General,
and in 1790 Corsica is

00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:40.740
recognized as a
département,

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.320
a department.
 

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.900
Corsicans demanded a royal
decree that would recognize the

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.544
island as an integral part of
France subject to the laws of

00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:52.755
France,
and declared that those who had

00:16:52.755 --> 00:16:57.589
fought against France ought to
be permitted to return to their

00:16:57.589 --> 00:16:58.538
homeland.
 

00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:01.530
On the 27^(th) of December
there were celebrations in all

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.600
Corsican churches.
 

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.334
Napoleon had a banner hung in
his not inconsiderable house in

00:17:07.334 --> 00:17:09.778
Ajaccio, in the family house.
 

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:12.596
"Viva la nation,
viva Paoli, viva

00:17:12.596 --> 00:17:16.190
Mirabeau,"
who had supported the decree.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:16.849
"Long live the nation.
 

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:17.700
Long live Paoli.
 

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.308
Long live Mirabeau."
 

00:17:19.308 --> 00:17:22.390
He's trying to play it both
ways.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.164
He wrote, "From now on
we," that is Corsica and

00:17:25.164 --> 00:17:28.088
France, "have the same
interests, the same concerns.

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:31.279
The sea no longer separates
us."

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:32.829
Indeed, that's hardly the case.
 

00:17:32.829 --> 00:17:36.803
Even today, in Corsica,
there have to be subventions to

00:17:36.803 --> 00:17:41.344
help keep the cost of food down
in Corsica because of the

00:17:41.344 --> 00:17:45.964
enormous cost of transporting
things that are not produced

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.019
locally.
 

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:50.685
You can't just live on goat
cheese and things like that,

00:17:50.685 --> 00:17:53.019
and red wine produced in
Corsica.

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:58.950
The sea does matter.
 

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.548
But the Revolution helped
Napoleon reconcile some of the

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:06.278
contradictions that had bothered
him all the way along.

00:18:06.278 --> 00:18:09.828
At this point,
he'd become a French Corsican.

00:18:09.828 --> 00:18:15.679
He renounced publishing some of
his letters and began to enter

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:20.089
these political struggles in the
Revolution.

00:18:20.089 --> 00:18:21.868
Indeed, he was lucky.
 

00:18:21.868 --> 00:18:24.358
One of the amazing things about
Napoleon was his luck.

00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:30.259
When he might have well been
guillotined as being a Jacobin,

00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:34.858
he was in Corsica or in the
South of France.

00:18:34.858 --> 00:18:36.858
He always seemed to be in the
right place.

00:18:36.858 --> 00:18:39.950
This was true in his battles,
as well.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.680
He was a tremendously
courageous guy.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.288
His bodyguards are always
trying to get him to move back

00:18:47.288 --> 00:18:51.730
in the traditional way as an
officer, a commander,

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.460
which he was--the
commander from the battles.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.266
He, in fact,
is only wounded very lightly

00:18:57.266 --> 00:18:58.740
two or three times.
 

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.068
So he's pretty lucky.
 

00:19:00.068 --> 00:19:04.641
When bodies are falling and
horses are falling all around

00:19:04.641 --> 00:19:08.068
him, he remained an extremely
lucky guy.

00:19:08.068 --> 00:19:13.130
This also accounts for his
success,

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.818
although even though on the
18^(th) of Brumaire in 1799,

00:19:16.818 --> 00:19:21.042
clearly it would be a military
person who was going to put an

00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:24.561
end to what has been
indelicately called the War of

00:19:24.561 --> 00:19:27.730
the Chamber Pots that was the
Directory,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:32.290
that is the period of the
post-Thermidor,

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.990
the Directory,
the battles between left and

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.430
right.
 

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:42.799
The Revolution made military
men extraordinarily important.

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:46.250
There wasn't a king anymore,
and the War of the Chamber Pots

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.828
and the sort of sleaziness of
the period,

00:19:48.828 --> 00:19:52.230
though it was important in
giving France some sort of

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.368
parliamentary experience in a
meaningful way,

00:19:55.368 --> 00:20:01.154
meant that some military person
was going to be imposing

00:20:01.154 --> 00:20:03.259
"order."
 

00:20:03.259 --> 00:20:07.076
When Abbe Sieyès,
who would survive what is the

00:20:07.076 --> 00:20:09.499
Third Estate,
who had also survived all of

00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:11.308
the vicissitudes of the
Revolution,

00:20:11.308 --> 00:20:12.769
when he thinks about one
general,

00:20:12.769 --> 00:20:16.000
another military man says,
"There's your man.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.253
There's Napoleon,"
who is again in the right

00:20:18.253 --> 00:20:18.630
place.
 

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.348
"He's going to do a better
coup d'etat than the other guy

00:20:21.348 --> 00:20:22.420
could have done."
 

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:28.868
So, Napoleon there happened to
be a lucky fellow as well.

00:20:28.868 --> 00:20:33.328
In 1793 the followers of Paoli
broke with the convention during

00:20:33.328 --> 00:20:36.710
the federalist revolts,
which you know about.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:41.529
During the expulsion of the
Girondins from the convention,

00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:45.588
the uprisings come in Leon,
Marseilles, Bordeaux,

00:20:45.588 --> 00:20:48.380
Toulon, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:56.258
Those on the outs with Paoli,
including Napoleon,

00:20:56.258 --> 00:21:01.509
now embrace the Jacobin cause.
 

00:21:01.509 --> 00:21:06.269
The Corsican assembly in
Ajaccio--;by the way,

00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:15.690
it's A-J-A-C-C-I-O--condemn the
Bonapartes,

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.604
who had dropped the
"u"

00:21:16.604 --> 00:21:18.420
in their name,
that's in the book,

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.630
as having been born in the mud
of despotism.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.140
So, Napoleon turned his back on
the independence movement to

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.530
which he had pledged in the
privacy of his room in Valence

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.088
and other places,
in Brienne, fidelity.

00:21:32.088 --> 00:21:37.483
He now hated Paoli,
who he blamed for having turned

00:21:37.483 --> 00:21:41.259
so many Corsicans against
France.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.660
Again, is this opportunism?
 

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.700
Had he merely caught the
nearest way?

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:50.002
He had embraced the national
identity of being French and he

00:21:50.002 --> 00:21:52.430
did take ideas seriously.
 

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.650
It's possible to argue,
I would believe this,

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.496
that the philosophes
eventually won out and he saw

00:22:00.496 --> 00:22:04.548
the Revolution as a liberating
experience for France and the

00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:08.190
construction of a new way of
imagining the state.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:17.676
Of course, he turns that into
out and out political repression

00:22:17.676 --> 00:22:26.541
in his own country and the
megalomaniac conquest of all of

00:22:26.541 --> 00:22:30.119
these other places.
 

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:34.992
When he married Josephine,
who once somebody said would

00:22:34.992 --> 00:22:38.960
have drunk gold out of the skull
of any of her lovers,

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.265
he made sure that the French
spelling on the marriage

00:22:44.265 --> 00:22:49.979
certificate was there and that
the Corsican "u"

00:22:49.979 --> 00:22:53.548
had been taken out of his name.
 

00:22:53.548 --> 00:22:57.190
On the island of Saint Helena
in the middle of nowhere,

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.200
where he had a lot of time to
think, he wrote,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.403
"I am more
champagnois,"

00:23:03.403 --> 00:23:05.608
that's where the town of
Brienne was,

00:23:05.608 --> 00:23:08.267
his military school,
Reims, Épernay

00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:10.558
Champagne,
and all these good things.

00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:13.673
"I am more champagnois
than Corsican,

00:23:13.673 --> 00:23:17.240
because from the age of nine I
was raised in Brienne.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.367
It would have displeased the
French if I'd surrounded myself

00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:21.269
with Corsicans.
 

00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:24.336
On the contrary,
I wanted absolutely to be

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:25.009
French.
 

00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:28.309
Of the all the insults I have
had heaped upon me in so many

00:23:28.309 --> 00:23:31.087
pamphlets,
the one to which I was most

00:23:31.087 --> 00:23:34.410
sensitive was that of being
Corsican."

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.630
Napoleon was an inveterate
liar, particularly when he was

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.719
trying to craft,
it was quite clear he was

00:23:41.719 --> 00:23:43.828
already ill, his legacy.
 

00:23:43.828 --> 00:23:47.282
Much of what he wrote on the
island talking about his eternal

00:23:47.282 --> 00:23:50.103
devotion to the principles of
liberty, fraternity,

00:23:50.103 --> 00:23:53.021
and equality,
was trying to plan these

00:23:53.021 --> 00:23:57.961
220,000 articles and books that
would be written about him until

00:23:57.961 --> 00:23:58.588
1980.
 

00:23:58.588 --> 00:24:01.778
This was a sheer invention of
the past, because the record is

00:24:01.778 --> 00:24:05.073
quite clear in his writings and
what he said that he considered

00:24:05.073 --> 00:24:06.190
himself Corsican.
 

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:10.732
Yet, the Frenchness of the
Revolution overwhelmed that in

00:24:10.732 --> 00:24:11.220
him.
 

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:17.307
In the end, he remained a
Frenchman, like very many people

00:24:17.307 --> 00:24:20.833
with a strong accent,
in his case,

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:22.970
that of Corsica.
 

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.018
There are some other obvious
things that are Corsican about

00:24:26.018 --> 00:24:27.068
him that remained.
 

00:24:27.068 --> 00:24:28.618
Again, this is part of the
stereotype.

00:24:28.618 --> 00:24:31.785
In France, like other
countries, one has stereotypes

00:24:31.785 --> 00:24:33.400
about different regions.
 

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.881
In France people think,
for example,

00:24:35.881 --> 00:24:39.496
that those from the center of
France, from Auvergne,

00:24:39.496 --> 00:24:42.190
are cheap, radin in
French.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.730
Or that people in Marseilles
exaggerate.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.088
You say to somebody in French,
"You're from Marseilles,

00:24:48.088 --> 00:24:48.848
aren't you?"
 

00:24:48.848 --> 00:24:52.702
after they just said that they
caught a 1,000 pound perch,

00:24:52.702 --> 00:24:56.083
or something like that,
or that Marseilles had just

00:24:56.083 --> 00:24:58.450
scored the goal of the century.
 

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:01.130
There's a tendency of people
from Marseilles to exaggerate.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:06.229
These sort of regional
stereotypes are part of any

00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:07.269
country.
 

00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:10.910
One of the stereotypes,
though there's some truth with

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.519
this, is the idea of family
loyalty.

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:17.758
Most people are loyal to their
families, but Napoleon took the

00:25:17.758 --> 00:25:20.328
kind of clan identity a bit
strong.

00:25:20.328 --> 00:25:24.204
Of course, what he does is he
perches his various brothers on

00:25:24.204 --> 00:25:27.564
the thrones of almost
everywhere, this kind of family

00:25:27.564 --> 00:25:28.338
loyalty.
 

00:25:28.338 --> 00:25:30.549
It's not just people from
Corsica who might,

00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:32.710
given that situation,
do the same thing.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.940
Also there's the settling of
scores.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.137
Napoleon, and we'll talk about
this in a while,

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:42.683
if you do believe that the
period is--we can see the

00:25:42.683 --> 00:25:44.838
origins of total war there.
 

00:25:44.838 --> 00:25:47.480
I'm a little skeptical about
this.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.255
Nonetheless,
when people turned against

00:25:50.255 --> 00:25:53.250
Napoleon or against the French
armies,

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:57.135
his reaction was "We're
going to pay them back and we're

00:25:57.135 --> 00:25:58.819
going to get them."
 

00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:02.788
Not with flashing knives,
but with execution,

00:26:02.788 --> 00:26:05.220
burning of villages in
Palestine,

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.309
more about this later,
in the south of Italy,

00:26:08.309 --> 00:26:12.269
and in the Tyrol,
in the mountains of Austria.

00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:15.642
Whether vengeance is more of a
Corsican thing than a

00:26:15.642 --> 00:26:19.145
champagnois thing or a
lyonnais thing or

00:26:19.145 --> 00:26:23.113
Briton thing or a North
German thing or a Polish thing

00:26:23.113 --> 00:26:25.480
or whatever,
one can't say.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:33.817
Yet lots of the thinking about
Napoleon looks for things that

00:26:33.817 --> 00:26:37.710
remain Corsican about him.
 

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.769
Having said all of that,
what shall we do?

00:26:41.769 --> 00:26:46.160
Let's now turn to this question
of whether we think--and it's

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.232
just a rhetorical
question--whether my dear

00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:54.798
friend, David Bell,
is right that you can see the

00:26:54.798 --> 00:26:59.660
origins of total war in this
period.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.076
One thing that I'm a little
skeptical about is that if you

00:27:03.076 --> 00:27:06.375
compare this to the Thirty
Years' War--and you saw those

00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:10.152
ghoulish illustrations before of
different ways you could perish

00:27:10.152 --> 00:27:13.210
at the hands of enemies
determined for no particular

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.930
reason,
in many cases,

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:22.666
to simply destroy you--it's not
clear that the Revolutionary

00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:29.750
period and the Napoleonic wars
really was the first.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.288
Yet, if we think aloud,
and that's what I'm doing,

00:27:32.288 --> 00:27:36.640
if we see the origins of total
war in World War I,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.839
where the mobilization of state
resources,

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:45.811
as much as possible to the war,
and again in World War II--and

00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:50.739
particularly in World War II the
breaking down of the

00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:55.950
differentiation between
civilians and non-civilians.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.980
That happens a little bit in
1914, but not that much.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.554
It happens in the Turkish
massacres of the Armenians in

00:28:03.554 --> 00:28:04.910
1895 and 1915.
 

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.480
That happens, too.
 

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.952
But it is possible to argue
that the Revolutionary and

00:28:10.952 --> 00:28:16.269
particularly the Napoleonic
period--from that point of view,

00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:21.577
the mobilization of--melting
church bells and transforming

00:28:21.577 --> 00:28:25.859
almost every available
industrial site into war

00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:28.298
production,
and turning out all these

00:28:28.298 --> 00:28:32.319
cannonballs,
and all these rifles,

00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:36.019
and all these swords,
and all these bayonets,

00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:42.049
with the total resources of the
state directed toward war.

00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:44.519
There is a point there.
 

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:47.200
There's really two sides of
that argument.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.759
That's one, the mobilization of
resources.

00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:54.248
The levée en
masse, a mass military

00:28:54.248 --> 00:28:59.577
conscription that all male
citizens are going to be in the

00:28:59.577 --> 00:29:00.420
army.
 

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.528
This starts with the French
Revolution.

00:29:02.528 --> 00:29:07.009
After all, Valmy was the battle
near the windmill in Chalon,

00:29:07.009 --> 00:29:09.410
near Champagne in the east of
France,

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:14.607
the Sans-Culottes going to
war--was the levée en

00:29:14.607 --> 00:29:19.714
masse where ordinary people
are full of enthusiasm in

00:29:19.714 --> 00:29:25.368
singing patriotic songs or
heading off to fight the enemy.

00:29:25.368 --> 00:29:29.681
But the other side of this
total war story is,

00:29:29.681 --> 00:29:34.759
of course, what happens to the
civilian population?

00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:40.672
Napoleon once said in one of
his rare moments of real

00:29:40.672 --> 00:29:47.381
introspection that he didn't
give a damn if a million people

00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:50.108
died because of him.
 

00:29:50.108 --> 00:29:57.940
He believed--part of his great
failing is--a great weakness,

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.855
and the suffering of humanity
because of it was his sense that

00:30:01.855 --> 00:30:04.368
no matter what he did,
it was the right thing to do.

00:30:04.368 --> 00:30:07.539
He has this sort of
hallucination moment in about

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:11.078
1796 after one of his battles,
I think it's Arcole,

00:30:11.078 --> 00:30:15.019
where he sees after himself--he
sees himself transported in the

00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:18.768
air and that the whole world
seemed to be like you're taking

00:30:18.768 --> 00:30:20.230
off in an airplane.
 

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.048
The whole world is beneath him.
 

00:30:22.048 --> 00:30:25.221
At that point,
he has this sort of sense that

00:30:25.221 --> 00:30:29.401
what he would will as a human
being would inevitably become

00:30:29.401 --> 00:30:31.778
reality because he willed it.
 

00:30:31.778 --> 00:30:36.721
The other half of this sort of
total war aspect is that,

00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:39.907
to be sure,
not only did something like one

00:30:39.907 --> 00:30:42.978
of every French male born,
who would have been eligible

00:30:42.978 --> 00:30:46.494
for military service,
died during the Revolution and

00:30:46.494 --> 00:30:47.868
Napoleonic wars.
 

00:30:47.868 --> 00:30:53.720
But this sort of meting out of
a brutal vengeance,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.708
more than just in a Corsican
sense to people who crossed his

00:30:57.708 --> 00:31:00.210
will does anticipate in some
ways,

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.410
and I'm not even sure how much
I believe this,

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.058
but the twentieth century.
 

00:31:07.058 --> 00:31:10.557
On one hand is the difference
between soldiers and

00:31:10.557 --> 00:31:14.913
civilians--is being eliminated
with the end of the really just

00:31:14.913 --> 00:31:18.338
professional army of the
eighteenth century.

00:31:18.338 --> 00:31:22.116
It's possible there were a lot
of people killed in the

00:31:22.116 --> 00:31:25.680
eighteenth century,
too, in those professional army

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.890
wars and all that business.
 

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:31.414
But victims,
too, are not just military

00:31:31.414 --> 00:31:32.250
people.
 

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:38.365
Of course, the worst atrocities
committed by French troops were

00:31:38.365 --> 00:31:43.949
in this sort of madcap Egyptian,
Middle-Eastern adventure when

00:31:43.949 --> 00:31:48.059
he goes off with a boat packed
with scientists as well as

00:31:48.059 --> 00:31:50.190
munitions and lots to eat.
 

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.319
He goes off to Egypt.
 

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:53.720
Imagine conquering India.
 

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.680
He had an idea how far India
was away.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.798
Of course, when people don't
put up with this,

00:31:58.798 --> 00:32:00.588
then he massacres them in
Palestine.

00:32:00.588 --> 00:32:03.660
They raze villages and that's
the end of that.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.914
As I said before,
the examples before would be in

00:32:07.914 --> 00:32:12.790
Calabria in the south of Italy
when there are persistent

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:16.571
rebellions,
resistance to French rule--and

00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:20.509
why not?--then they just start
massacring people.

00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:25.285
Of course, the famous case of
Spain where you have forever on

00:32:25.285 --> 00:32:29.820
these magnificent canvases of
Goya where French troops are

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.117
shooting down Spanish peasants
who are resisting in the

00:32:34.117 --> 00:32:35.788
Peninsular War.
 

00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:38.794
These too, I guess by more
modern definitions,

00:32:38.794 --> 00:32:42.132
not contemporary ones
necessarily from that period,

00:32:42.132 --> 00:32:44.868
but would be classified as
massacres.

00:32:44.868 --> 00:32:48.866
It's possible and this isn't
too far fetched to imagine the

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:52.519
sort of total war as being part
of that experience.

00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:58.289
From 1792 to 1815,
the experience of ordinary

00:32:58.289 --> 00:33:02.880
people in much of Europe was
war.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.380
There is that, too.
 

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.824
Napoleon's reaction to all of
that was, "je m'en

00:33:10.824 --> 00:33:11.579
fous."
 

00:33:11.579 --> 00:33:13.880
He didn't really care.
 

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.009
After every big defeat the next
step was to plan the next war.

00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:20.220
The most famous example,
of course,

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:24.773
is when you've got hundreds of
thousands of people that are

00:33:24.773 --> 00:33:28.622
picked off by Russians
partisans--and why not?--or

00:33:28.622 --> 00:33:31.920
freeze to death in the Russian
winter.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.279
When Napoleon,
with his ragtag band of

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:38.700
survivors,
when they get back to France

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.980
one can see why that French
expression,

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.311
"to lie like a military
bulletin,"

00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:45.558
comes into existence.
 

00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:49.813
The military bulletin that
church people had to read,

00:33:49.813 --> 00:33:54.803
the priest had to read at mass,
said that the emperor's health

00:33:54.803 --> 00:33:56.930
had never been better.
 

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.390
Of course, that was true enough.
 

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:03.660
He immediately begins to start
planning another war.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:08.992
When Cossacks are camped on
Montmartre and start the first

00:34:08.992 --> 00:34:14.697
Russian restaurant in Paris in
1814 and he's packed off to the

00:34:14.697 --> 00:34:18.380
island of Elba,
not too far from the Italian

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.422
coast--he makes his 100 days
escape and lands at

00:34:21.422 --> 00:34:24.010
Fréjus in the south of
France.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.510
Marshal Ney famously throws
himself into his arms after

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.650
having been sent to arrest him.
 

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:33.059
Napoleon is immediately
planning the next war and that

00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:36.340
ends happily for the rest of
Europe at Waterloo,

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:42.679
when Napoleon typically does
not delegate enough authority,

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:46.010
and Marshal Grouchy does not
come to rescue him,

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.710
and he's rounded up and sent so
far away.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:53.346
It's a little difficult to plan
the next European war if the

00:34:53.346 --> 00:34:58.219
closest port is some 600 miles
away and is in Peru or someplace

00:34:58.219 --> 00:34:59.320
like that.
 

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.771
I made this part of what I'm
saying today in kind of a

00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:05.199
rhetorical way.
 

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:07.630
I'm posing a question,
because I don't really have a

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:08.679
good answer to that.
 

00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:11.969
I don't believe that history
runs on railroad tracks and all

00:35:11.969 --> 00:35:15.369
you need is the timetable to see
when modern times show up.

00:35:15.369 --> 00:35:20.206
But if you look at the horrors
of the twentieth century and the

00:35:20.206 --> 00:35:24.373
butchery of the civilians,
in 1895 the Armenian massacre

00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:28.510
or the butchery of civilians
after the Paris Commune of 1871,

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.139
it's not too hard to see all of
this.

00:35:31.139 --> 00:35:33.750
We're not yet talking about the
Holocaust.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.429
We're not yet talking about
World War II.

00:35:36.429 --> 00:35:42.320
But yet, some of that was out
there.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:46.056
One more point is that,
and I'm obviously not defending

00:35:46.056 --> 00:35:47.579
the French soldiers.
 

00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:51.320
It's very unusual for me not to
be defending la France

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.710
and all things French,
but nonetheless,

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:58.204
one of the cases that you might
say total war comes before

00:35:58.204 --> 00:35:59.762
Napoleon,
and this is of course the

00:35:59.762 --> 00:36:01.690
Vendée,
which I alluded to the other

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.670
day,
the civil war in the West.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.530
There you had cases of them
simply razing villages,

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.880
and lining people up against
the wall,

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.880
and gunning down priests,
and drowning nuns,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.849
and this extremely asocial,
antisocial behavior.

00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:20.199
One of the things about these
civil wars,

00:36:20.199 --> 00:36:25.034
and the case was true in Spain,
was that from the point of view

00:36:25.034 --> 00:36:31.045
of soldiers in a guerilla war,
anyone was a potential

00:36:31.045 --> 00:36:32.909
assailant.
 

00:36:32.909 --> 00:36:37.538
Again, and this is not excusing
what French troops did in the

00:36:37.538 --> 00:36:39.755
Vendée,
but to have made it a big

00:36:39.755 --> 00:36:42.940
political issue,
which people did in 1989,

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.681
the 200^(th) anniversary of the
French Revolution and say it's

00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:48.141
the first genocide,
which is what the far right was

00:36:48.141 --> 00:36:49.849
saying--the traditional far
right,

00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:54.014
not Le Pen and those folks who
would be happy to massacre

00:36:54.014 --> 00:36:58.552
almost anybody who they didn't
view as French--it's just sheer

00:36:58.552 --> 00:36:59.519
nonsense.
 

00:36:59.519 --> 00:37:01.360
It's simply not the case.
 

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.856
There are some contexts that
should be provided in thinking

00:37:06.856 --> 00:37:08.090
about that.
 

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.150
But it's an interesting theme
and it's worth discussing.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:15.996
When you're doing this reading,
which I hope you'll do,

00:37:15.996 --> 00:37:20.219
that's not a bad idea to think
about.

00:37:20.219 --> 00:37:22.170
Let me just make a few points.
 

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.440
We have about ten minutes left.
 

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.380
This is just to amplify what
you're reading about.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.663
Anyone who's ever had to wait
in line at a prefecture in

00:37:31.663 --> 00:37:35.480
France for a driver's license
or, in our case,

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.994
our French identity cards or
almost anything else will be

00:37:39.994 --> 00:37:44.023
cursing Napoleon for having
maintained this sort of

00:37:44.023 --> 00:37:48.942
centralization that emerged out
of absolutism and was honed in

00:37:48.942 --> 00:37:53.777
defense of the republic by folks
like the Committee of Public

00:37:53.777 --> 00:37:57.889
Safety--where Napoleon founded a
rational,

00:37:57.889 --> 00:38:05.380
"enlightened way"
of organizing a state.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:10.237
Certainly Napoleon--whether he
snatched the crown out of the

00:38:10.237 --> 00:38:15.427
pope's hand and crowned himself
or let the pope crown him is not

00:38:15.427 --> 00:38:16.579
the issue.
 

00:38:16.579 --> 00:38:21.746
Napoleon could have pretty much
done whatever he wanted,

00:38:21.746 --> 00:38:27.289
but in fact what he does is he
maintains the departments.

00:38:27.289 --> 00:38:28.920
They were created in 1790.
 

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.068
They send a prefect,
who is like the

00:38:33.068 --> 00:38:40.297
intendant but even more
centralized, to each department

00:38:40.297 --> 00:38:41.719
in 1800.
 

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:47.550
They keep the same kind of top
down centralized organization.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:52.130
Somebody once said that Gaul
was divided up into three parts.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.003
When thinking about France at
the time of Napoleon or anytime

00:38:55.003 --> 00:38:57.110
afterward one could think the
same thing,

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.940
that France was divided up into
the Ministry of the Interior,

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.619
the Ministry of Justice,
and the Ministry of War.

00:39:03.619 --> 00:39:08.869
Napoleon, who ruthlessly
censored newspapers,

00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:10.429
and forced them out of
business,

00:39:10.429 --> 00:39:13.038
and made the costs of their
continuation so extremely

00:39:13.038 --> 00:39:15.260
difficult,
while organizing or

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:18.320
orchestrating the cult of
Napoleon,

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.425
whether it be through paid art,
some of them extremely great

00:39:22.425 --> 00:39:25.597
artists,
or lesser versions--he

00:39:25.597 --> 00:39:30.956
maintains the kind of
centralization that became

00:39:30.956 --> 00:39:37.568
important in France and in
places where the waves of French

00:39:37.568 --> 00:39:40.077
troops,
"liberty,

00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:44.119
fraternity, equality,"
and all of that ended up,

00:39:44.119 --> 00:39:48.119
that is maintained.
 

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:53.967
He liked to think that the
Napoleonic code was his greatest

00:39:53.967 --> 00:39:55.480
contribution.
 

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.030
He wanted to be the modern
Justinian.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:03.043
In fact, he does oversee lots
of the beatings of lawyers,

00:40:03.043 --> 00:40:05.820
and jurists,
and specialists.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.860
It's classic looking back from
our view.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.371
It's patently ridiculous that
there were many,

00:40:10.371 --> 00:40:13.440
many more times articles
dealing with the sale of cattle

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.840
than there were of the rights of
women.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.612
This isn't too surprising,
because Napoleon--as many

00:40:19.612 --> 00:40:22.456
dictators,
including much more egregious

00:40:22.456 --> 00:40:25.806
ones like Mussolini and Hitler
in the twentieth century--viewed

00:40:25.806 --> 00:40:29.050
women as nothing more than
machines for producing babies.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.094
He said this.
 

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.670
He said this exactly like that.
 

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:37.782
Yet, and that's a big yet,
the Napoleonic code survives

00:40:37.782 --> 00:40:42.987
and remains in many cases the
basis for the French legal

00:40:42.987 --> 00:40:44.030
system.
 

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:48.943
Again, this is an Enlightenment
enterprise in many ways gone

00:40:48.943 --> 00:40:49.610
right.
 

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.519
It is there.
 

00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:56.135
Among the other contributions,
we don't really have time to

00:40:56.135 --> 00:40:59.750
talk about it and it's obvious
about this sort of nationalism

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:03.483
and that one's value comes from
service to the state as opposed

00:41:03.483 --> 00:41:06.815
from royal blood,
though he creates this new

00:41:06.815 --> 00:41:09.960
nobility based upon service to
the state.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.820
Service to the state was above
all through the army.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:19.480
A lot of these people who
become marshals and all of this,

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:24.057
if they were lucky enough to
survive all these ridiculous

00:41:24.057 --> 00:41:26.429
wars, are military types.
 

00:41:26.429 --> 00:41:30.197
The Napoleonic code and this
new sort of service nobility are

00:41:30.197 --> 00:41:31.389
important things.
 

00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:35.010
The concordat--he does a very
important thing.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:39.690
He makes peace with the
Catholic Church.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:44.427
He realized that as long as you
had this potential contrast

00:41:44.427 --> 00:41:48.349
between juring priests and
nonjuring priests,

00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:53.815
that you would still have lots
of militant Catholics who wanted

00:41:53.815 --> 00:41:56.989
some sort of royalist
restoration.

00:41:56.989 --> 00:42:01.297
Indeed, remember the king was
dead and his son had died also

00:42:01.297 --> 00:42:02.829
in prison in Paris.
 

00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:07.449
But you've still got the king's
brother out there.

00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:09.650
It's a very shrewd move.
 

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.570
Of course, he uses the church
for his own propaganda devices,

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:17.456
and the church continues the
tradition of really the civil

00:42:17.456 --> 00:42:20.630
constitution of the French
clergy,

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:25.887
the relationship between the
church and the Napoleonic

00:42:25.887 --> 00:42:26.780
regime.
 

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:33.818
This is a very important,
clever step that basically ends

00:42:33.818 --> 00:42:40.480
the turmoil within France,
at least to that extent.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.934
The old revolutionary calendar
of Germinal, and Ventose,

00:42:44.934 --> 00:42:48.255
and Thermidor,
that all disappears and was

00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:51.090
replaced by the basic calendar.
 

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:56.619
People still in 1795 and 1796
in rural France are not thinking

00:42:56.619 --> 00:42:59.974
of ten day units called
decadi,

00:42:59.974 --> 00:43:02.150
something like that.
 

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:06.307
They're thinking of weeks and
they still are having mass said

00:43:06.307 --> 00:43:08.518
secretly,
which was the case in our

00:43:08.518 --> 00:43:10.820
village,
even in 1794,

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:15.420
until finally the priest has to
go away.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:20.454
The concordat,
this peace with the churches is

00:43:20.454 --> 00:43:24.369
obviously a very important
thing.

00:43:24.369 --> 00:43:27.130
So is, really,
the establishment of the basis

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.141
of the French educational system
that's remained,

00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:33.280
for better or for worse,
the same until today.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.559
I'm a big believer in the
French educational system.

00:43:36.559 --> 00:43:40.449
My kids were in French schools
for three or four years.

00:43:40.449 --> 00:43:45.090
There's no higher good result
of humanity's collective good

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:49.889
deeds than a French kindergarten
or first or second grade.

00:43:49.889 --> 00:43:51.628
It begins to fall apart by the
time you get to

00:43:51.628 --> 00:43:52.480
lycée.
 

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.570
He created the
lycée,

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.480
the high schools--and the
university system is now in

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.271
total chaos,
and Sarkozy will probably make

00:43:59.271 --> 00:44:03.367
it even worse if he gets his way
about creating an American-like

00:44:03.367 --> 00:44:07.849
hierarchy of institutions,
which would be at the expense

00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:11.722
of not the lower level,
but the more modest

00:44:11.722 --> 00:44:14.840
universities in the French
system.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.085
But be that as it may,
Napoleon--it may or may not be

00:44:17.085 --> 00:44:19.965
true that he once said he could
look at his watch and see what

00:44:19.965 --> 00:44:22.090
everybody is studying at any
given moment.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:24.820
And there are lots of problems
with the French system,

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.239
but the division of France into
académies,

00:44:27.239 --> 00:44:29.858
again this has nothing to do
with the academies I've been

00:44:29.858 --> 00:44:33.067
talking about before,
but into a geographic way of

00:44:33.067 --> 00:44:36.838
organizing all education,
from the universities down to

00:44:36.838 --> 00:44:39.750
kindergarten or even to
crèches,

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:45.000
nursery schools,
organized by region.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.079
It has lasted through all this
time.

00:44:47.079 --> 00:44:48.760
It really is an extraordinary
accomplishment.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.090
An académie,
for example,

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.342
now would be the
académie of

00:44:51.342 --> 00:44:52.967
Limoges,
or the académie

00:44:52.967 --> 00:44:55.594
of Grenoble,
or the académie

00:44:55.594 --> 00:44:58.623
of Marseilles,
or the académie

00:44:58.623 --> 00:44:59.619
of Strasbourg.
 

00:44:59.619 --> 00:45:01.405
It covers two,
three, or four,

00:45:01.405 --> 00:45:03.809
depending on the region,
departments.

00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:06.463
It's almost impossible to get a
schoolteacher fired,

00:45:06.463 --> 00:45:07.139
by the way.
 

00:45:07.139 --> 00:45:08.119
That's another thing.
 

00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:10.927
I shouldn't go into--it would
be very indiscreet to go into

00:45:10.927 --> 00:45:13.422
this too much,
but if you try to get a school

00:45:13.422 --> 00:45:16.650
teacher in a village fired,
it has to go through the head

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.760
of the whole
académie,

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.356
who is called the
recteur or

00:45:20.356 --> 00:45:22.771
rectrice,
madame la lectrice or

00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:24.239
monsieur le lector.
 

00:45:24.239 --> 00:45:25.789
It's very impossible.
 

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:27.710
There are problems with that,
but nonetheless,

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:29.949
the reason that--and here this
sounds like a very pro-French

00:45:29.949 --> 00:45:31.771
thing to say--but the reason the
French children,

00:45:31.771 --> 00:45:34.550
as Finnish children,
and children in most European

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:38.275
countries test at a very much
higher level than those in the

00:45:38.275 --> 00:45:42.190
United States at any level you
can imagine is because they have

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:46.043
a centralized education system
which does not believe that you

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:49.873
should have wealthy communes,
wealthy parts of France having

00:45:49.873 --> 00:45:53.898
all of the advantages,
and then schools that have very

00:45:53.898 --> 00:45:59.556
limited financial resources have
not the same possibilities for

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:02.018
exceptional advancement.
 

00:46:02.018 --> 00:46:06.815
France has the grands
écoles,

00:46:06.815 --> 00:46:11.382
the big-time,
high-powered elite schools,

00:46:11.382 --> 00:46:14.010
elite universities.
 

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:17.182
They've got their equivalents
of the fancy places of which

00:46:17.182 --> 00:46:18.519
you're all in one now.
 

00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:24.012
But nonetheless,
Napoleon does create a system

00:46:24.012 --> 00:46:28.590
which is long lasting and which
allowed, over time,

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:32.452
the educational structure of
France to advance in very,

00:46:32.452 --> 00:46:36.530
very meaningful ways in the
whole course of the period.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.342
So, no matter what you think
about the fact that in the end

00:46:39.342 --> 00:46:42.300
he was a megalomaniac and lots
of people get killed because of

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:42.690
him.
 

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.139
There's no doubt about that.
 

00:46:44.139 --> 00:46:47.876
But the wave of the French
Revolution and the Napoleonic

00:46:47.876 --> 00:46:51.409
period has long lasting results
almost everywhere.

00:46:51.409 --> 00:46:53.429
Take, for example,
the unification of Italy.

00:46:53.429 --> 00:46:57.913
Italy will become unified in
the 1860s and early 1870s,

00:46:57.913 --> 00:46:59.739
"unified."
 

00:46:59.739 --> 00:47:03.094
Metternich said it was a
geographic expression only,

00:47:03.094 --> 00:47:05.989
and to an extent he may have
been correct.

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.860
The unification comes through
Piedmont Sardinia,

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.670
which was the most prosperous
part of Italy.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.949
It's in the north.
 

00:47:15.949 --> 00:47:18.809
They had the benefits of this
French bureaucracy,

00:47:18.809 --> 00:47:23.266
of this administration that was
centralized that allow them to

00:47:23.266 --> 00:47:26.699
be more prosperous than other
parts of Italy.

00:47:26.699 --> 00:47:27.760
It contributes to that.
 

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.739
They had other advantages, too.
 

00:47:31.739 --> 00:47:35.619
So, the Napoleonic wave did
make a difference.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.940
Though it's hard when you to go
Paris--and if you go to the

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.257
Louvre,
it's hard to not think of the

00:47:41.257 --> 00:47:46.994
fact that many of the treasures
that are there were simply

00:47:46.994 --> 00:47:51.530
looted from Italy,
loaded not in trains as

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.829
Goering,
and Goebbels,

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:57.079
and those folks looted art
treasures during World War II,

00:47:57.079 --> 00:48:01.440
but put very carefully-packed
on military wagons and returned

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.239
to Paris.
 

00:48:02.239 --> 00:48:05.309
So, we can debate about
Napoleon and all of that.

00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:07.460
My view is already probably
fairly clear,

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.641
but one has to admit that
besides just the romance of his

00:48:11.641 --> 00:48:13.559
life,
and a career open to talent,

00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:17.650
and all of that,
that he made a huge difference

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:21.010
and thus was worth spending some
time on.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:21.800
Have a good weekend.
 

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.409
I'm going to St. Louis.

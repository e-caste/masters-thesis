00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.951
Professor Paul Bloom:
I'm delighted to introduce the

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:21.344
first guest lecturer for this
Introduction to Psychology

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:25.401
course, Dean Peter Salovey.
Peter is an old friend and

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:27.843
colleague.
Many of you--I think everybody

00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:31.390
here knows of him through his
role as Dean of Yale College.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.030
I'll just, in this context of
this introduction,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.110
mention two other things about
him.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.976
One is prior to being dean and
in fact, still as a dean,

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:43.140
he's an active scientist and in
particular,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.482
a social psychologist actively
involved in studying health

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:51.976
psychology, the proper use of
psychological methods to frame

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:54.960
health messages,
and also is the founder and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.610
developer of the idea of
emotional intelligence,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.310
an idea he's done a huge amount
of research on.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.918
Secondly, Peter is or was an
active and extremely well-known

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:08.529
teacher at Yale College.
He taught at one point,

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:12.238
the largest course ever in Yale
College – a course on

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:16.360
Psychology in Law which broke
every record ever had here.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.370
And before that,
during that,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.673
and after that,
he was a legendary Introduction

00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:25.061
to Psychology teacher.
And I think--and he had some

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:28.105
reason for why he was so
legendary with his lecture today

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:29.410
on the topic of love.

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:43.916
[applause]
Dean Peter Salovey:

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:44.860
Thanks very much.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.123
Okay.
Thank you very much,

00:02:05.123 --> 00:02:08.274
Professor Bloom.
It really is a pleasure to come

00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:12.717
and lecture to you today on
Valentine's Day on the topic of

00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:15.843
love.
My main area of research is

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:19.270
human emotion.
And love is an emotion.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.592
It's not one that I study
personally, at least not in the

00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:26.680
lab, and--but it is fun to talk
about.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.384
And it is a topic that lends
itself to many social

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:33.727
psychological phenomena.
It's also great to be able to

00:02:33.727 --> 00:02:37.237
come in and guest lecture.
One of the things I very much

00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:41.307
miss since serving as dean is
the opportunity to teach

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:44.966
Psychology 110.
And although I love being dean,

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:49.153
I do miss teaching Introductory
Psychology, the feeling of

00:02:49.153 --> 00:02:53.780
exposing people to ideas that
maybe you hadn't heard before.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.015
Well, I suspect some of the
ideas in this talk you'll have

00:02:57.015 --> 00:02:59.740
not heard before and for a
variety of reasons.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.689
A couple of the things you'll
notice is that some of the

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.531
experiments I'll talk about
today are not the kinds of

00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:07.729
experiments that can be done
anymore.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.825
They're not considered
ethically acceptable but they

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:16.241
were done in the ‘50s and
‘60s and early ‘70s when

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:21.220
ethical standards were different
and so we can teach them.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.523
We just can't give you the same
experiences that some of the

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:27.882
college students that we'll talk
about today in these studies

00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:31.001
had.
The other thing I will mention

00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.899
is that there is a certain
androcentric and heterosexual

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:40.708
quality to much of the social
psychological research on

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.858
romantic love.
You'll see that in the

00:03:43.858 --> 00:03:47.046
experiments.
Usually, the participants are

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:51.860
men and usually the targets are
women in these experiments.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.190
I'm not endorsing this as the
only way to study love.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.837
It just happens to be the way
these experiments were done and

00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:02.060
so I mention this caution right
from the beginning.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.263
We'll have to think about--One
of the things you should think

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:10.397
about is do you think these
experiments generalized to other

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:15.225
kinds of dyadic relationships.
And that's a question that I

00:04:15.225 --> 00:04:18.980
think you can ask throughout
this lecture.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.259
Okay.
So let's get started.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:28.256
And to start things off I think
what we need to do is consider a

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:32.016
definition.
I'm going to define what love

00:04:32.016 --> 00:04:36.169
is but then most of the
experiments I'm going to talk

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.201
about are really focused more on
attraction than love--who finds

00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:46.073
each other of romantic interest
that might then develop into a

00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:49.154
love relationship.
But let's start with a

00:04:49.154 --> 00:04:51.965
definition of love.
And I'm going to pick a

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:56.250
definition from a former
colleague, Robert Sternberg,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.376
who is now the dean at Tufts
University but was here on our

00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:05.620
faculty at Yale for nearly
thirty years or so.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.937
And he has a theory of love
that argues that it's made up of

00:05:09.937 --> 00:05:12.060
three components:
intimacy,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.349
passion, and commitment,
or what is sometimes called

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.090
decision commitment.
And these are relatively

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.449
straightforward.
He argued that you don't have

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.069
love if you don't have all three
of these elements.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:32.543
Intimacy is the feeling of
closeness, of connectedness with

00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:35.561
someone, of bonding.
Operationally,

00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:38.790
you could think of intimacy as
you share secrets,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.029
you share information with this
person that you don't share with

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:45.230
anybody else.
Okay.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.291
That's really what intimacy is,
the bond that comes from

00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:53.574
sharing information that isn't
shared with other--with many

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:58.680
other people.
Second element is passion.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.315
Passion is what you think it is.
Passion is the--we would say

00:06:04.315 --> 00:06:09.820
the drive that leads to romance.
You can think of it as physical

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.235
attraction or sex.
And Sternberg argues that this

00:06:15.235 --> 00:06:21.339
is a required component of a
love relationship.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.559
It is not, however,
a required component of taking

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.755
a shower in Calhoun College.
[laughter]

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:34.739
The third element of love in
Sternberg's theory is what he

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:41.239
calls decision or commitment,
the decision that one is in a

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:45.508
love relationship,
the willingness to label it as

00:06:45.508 --> 00:06:48.242
such,
and a commitment to maintain

00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:52.000
that relationship at least for
some period of time.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.734
Sternberg would argue it's not
love if you don't call it love

00:06:55.734 --> 00:06:58.721
and if you don't have some
desire to maintain the

00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:02.287
relationship.
So if you have all three of

00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:05.908
these, intimacy,
passion and commitment,

00:07:05.908 --> 00:07:09.529
in Sternberg's theory you have
love.

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:14.582
Now what's interesting about
the theory is what do you have

00:07:14.582 --> 00:07:19.459
if you only have one out of
three or two out of three?

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:23.363
What do you have and how is it
different if you have a

00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:27.550
different two out of three?
These are--What's interesting

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.935
about this kind of theorizing is
it give--it gives rise to many

00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:36.461
different permutations that when
you break them down and start to

00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:40.209
look at them carefully can be
quite interesting.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:44.667
So what I've done is I've taken
Sternberg's three elements of

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:47.741
love, intimacy,
passion and commitment,

00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:52.072
and I've listed out the
different kinds of relationships

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:57.371
one would have if you had zero,
one, two or three out of the

00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:01.034
three elements.
And I'm using names or types

00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:03.740
that Sternberg uses in his
theory.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.067
These are really from him.
Some of these are pretty

00:08:07.067 --> 00:08:09.332
obvious.
If you don't have intimacy,

00:08:09.332 --> 00:08:12.659
if you don't have passion,
if you don't have commitment,

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:16.690
you don't have love.
Sternberg calls this non-love.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.027
That's the technical term.
And [laughs]

00:08:19.027 --> 00:08:22.900
essentially what he's saying is
the relationship you now have to

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.664
the person sitting next to you,
presuming that you're sitting

00:08:26.664 --> 00:08:30.360
next to a random person that you
didn't know from your college,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.607
is probably non-love.
If it's something else,

00:08:34.607 --> 00:08:38.533
we could talk about it at the
end of the lecture or perhaps

00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:43.600
when I get to it in a moment.
Now let's start to add elements.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.283
Let's add intimacy.
This is sharing secrets,

00:08:48.283 --> 00:08:52.173
a feeling of closeness,
connectedness,

00:08:52.173 --> 00:08:55.043
bonding.
Let's say we have that with

00:08:55.043 --> 00:08:57.710
someone but we don't have
passion, that is,

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.693
no sexual arousal,
and no commitment to maintain

00:09:00.693 --> 00:09:02.990
the relationship.
This is liking.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.987
Sternberg calls it liking.
And liking is really what is

00:09:07.987 --> 00:09:13.383
happening in most typical
friendships, not your closest

00:09:13.383 --> 00:09:18.080
friendship but friendships of a
casual kind.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.418
You feel close,
you share certain information

00:09:20.418 --> 00:09:23.555
with that person that you don't
share with other--many other

00:09:23.555 --> 00:09:25.803
people,
but you're not physically

00:09:25.803 --> 00:09:28.998
attracted and there's no
particular commitment to

00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:32.059
maintaining this for a long
period of time.

00:09:32.059 --> 00:09:35.756
Now, what if you're not
intimate, you're not committed,

00:09:35.756 --> 00:09:39.629
but you're passionate;
you feel that sexual arousal.

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:44.210
This is what Sternberg would
call infatuation.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.519
And that term probably works
for you too, infatuated love,

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:51.090
and this is love at first
sight.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.949
"I don't know you,
we've never shared any secrets

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:59.291
because I don't know you,
I'm not committed to defining

00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:02.309
this as anything,
I'm not committed to the future.

00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:03.899
In fact, I'm not thinking about
the future.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:06.900
I'm thinking about right now
but boy, am I attracted."

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.174
Right.
That's infatuation and that's

00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:13.629
what Sternberg means by
infatuated love.

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:18.217
The third kind of one-element
relationship is there's no

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:20.720
intimacy, right,
no bonding,

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.320
no closeness,
no secrets, no physical

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.820
attraction, no sexual arousal,
but by gosh,

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.001
we are going to maintain this
relationship,

00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:34.879
we are committed to it for all
time.

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:37.750
Sternberg calls that "empty
love."

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.720
Empty love is kind of
interesting.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.771
It's often the final stage of
long-term relationships that

00:10:44.771 --> 00:10:47.885
have gone bad.
"We don't share information

00:10:47.885 --> 00:10:50.899
with each other anymore so
there's no intimacy.

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:55.865
We don't feel physically
attracted to each other anymore,

00:10:55.865 --> 00:11:00.121
there's no passion,
but we'd better stay together

00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:02.250
for the kids,
right?

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.422
Or we've got to stay together
for appearance's sake or we'd

00:11:05.422 --> 00:11:08.321
better stay together because
financially it would be a

00:11:08.321 --> 00:11:11.712
disaster if we don't" or all of
the reasons other than intimacy

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:14.830
and passion that people might
commit to each other.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.470
That's what Sternberg calls
empty love.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:22.637
Now what's interesting is in
societies where marriages are

00:11:22.637 --> 00:11:28.440
arranged this is often the first
stage of a love relationship.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.076
These two people who have maybe
never seen each other before,

00:11:32.076 --> 00:11:35.409
who have never shared secrets
so there's no intimacy,

00:11:35.409 --> 00:11:39.692
who have never--don't know if
they're physically attracted to

00:11:39.692 --> 00:11:43.974
each other or on their wedding
day revealed to each other and

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:48.400
committed legally and sometimes
religiously to each other.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.816
Right?
The commitment is there but at

00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:53.299
that moment nothing else might
be there.

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:58.235
What's interesting of course is
that such relationships don't

00:11:58.235 --> 00:12:03.418
seem to have any greater chance
of ending in divorce than people

00:12:03.418 --> 00:12:07.050
who marry for love.
But there's a big confound,

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.144
there's a big problem in
studies of those kind of

00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:13.410
relationships.
What might it be?

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.237
Anybody.
What might be the problem in

00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:19.411
the statement I just made that
these kind of relationships are

00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:22.430
just as likely to survive as
people who marry for love?

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.187
Yes.
Student:

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:25.513
[inaudible]
Dean Peter Salovey:

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:28.500
Yeah.
So they may occur;

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.230
they're more likely to occur in
societies that frown on divorce.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.017
They make it very costly,
socially costly,

00:12:36.017 --> 00:12:39.688
to divorce, so then they stay
together for all kinds of

00:12:39.688 --> 00:12:42.340
reasons, not always such good
ones.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.465
All right.
Now who was it who sang the

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:48.830
song "Two Out of Three Ain't
Bad"?

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:53.520
Was that Meat Loaf?
Who was it?

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.820
It was Meat Loaf.
All right.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.890
Professor Bloom says it was
Meat Loaf.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.769
It was Meat Loaf.
You're all saying,

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:05.429
"there was a singer called Meat
Loaf?"

00:13:05.429 --> 00:13:07.570
Meat Loaf sang the song "Two
Out of Three Ain't Bad."

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.940
Let's see if two out of three
ain't bad.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.513
What if you have intimacy,
"we share secrets,

00:13:13.513 --> 00:13:17.898
passion, we feel physically
attracted to each other but

00:13:17.898 --> 00:13:21.389
we're not making any commitments
here."

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:23.769
Sternberg calls that "romantic
love."

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:28.066
This is physical attraction
with close bonding but no

00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:32.279
commitment, Romeo and Juliet
when they first met.

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.931
This is often the way
relationships start:

00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:37.970
"We like each other,
I'm physically attracted to

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.584
each other,
I--to you, I enjoy spending

00:13:40.584 --> 00:13:44.240
time with you but I'm not making
any long-term commitments.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.205
So I'm not even willing to use
the ‘L' word in describing

00:13:48.205 --> 00:13:50.509
what it is we have."
Right?

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:53.950
Many of you might have been in
relationships of this sort.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.879
That's romance.
That's romantic love.

00:13:55.879 --> 00:14:00.363
Now, what if you have intimacy,
"we share secrets with each

00:14:00.363 --> 00:14:05.156
other, but there's no particular
physical attraction but we are

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:08.480
really committed to this
relationship."

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.590
This is what Sternberg calls
"companionate love."

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:15.584
This is your best friend.
"We are committed to sharing

00:14:15.584 --> 00:14:19.002
intimacy, to being friends
forever," but physical

00:14:19.002 --> 00:14:22.350
attraction is not part of the
equation here.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:28.216
This is sort of the--maybe the
Greek ideal in relationships of

00:14:28.216 --> 00:14:30.100
some kind.
All right.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.316
What if we have passion,
"I'm sexually attracted to

00:14:33.316 --> 00:14:36.061
you," but no intimacy.
"I don't want to really know

00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:38.121
that much about you,
I don't want to really share

00:14:38.121 --> 00:14:40.899
anything of me with you,
but I am committed to

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:45.063
maintaining this physical
attraction to you" [laughter]

00:14:45.063 --> 00:14:47.745
Well,
that's what Sternberg calls

00:14:47.745 --> 00:14:50.440
"fatuous love."
It's a whirlwind courtship.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.744
It's a Hollywood romance.
It might lead to a shotgun

00:14:53.744 --> 00:14:56.516
wedding.
Maybe you find yourself in Las

00:14:56.516 --> 00:15:00.889
Vegas and you get married for a
day and a half and then realize

00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:03.500
that this wasn't such a good
idea.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.730
And maybe your name is Britney
and you're a singer.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.065
[laughter]
Well, anyway,

00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:12.830
you've got the idea.
That's fatuous love.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.552
"We are basically committed to
each other for sex" but it's

00:15:16.552 --> 00:15:19.954
very hard to make those
relationships last a long time

00:15:19.954 --> 00:15:23.100
because we might not have
anything in common,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.175
we might not share anything
with each other,

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.773
we might not trust each other,
we are not particularly bonded

00:15:28.773 --> 00:15:30.761
to each other.
On the other hand,

00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:32.898
if you have all three,
intimacy, passion,

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:36.264
commitment, this is "consummate
love" according to Sternberg –

00:15:36.264 --> 00:15:40.800
complete love.
This is how he defines love.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.934
Okay.
So now you have a definition of

00:15:43.934 --> 00:15:46.169
love and you can now,
as a homework assignment,

00:15:46.169 --> 00:15:51.881
sit down tonight and make a
list of every person you know by

00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:57.496
the three elements of love and
just start putting the check

00:15:57.496 --> 00:16:04.080
marks in the boxes and tallying
up your personal love box score.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.990
And we don't want to collect
those.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.889
We don't even want to see those
but you can have fun with that.

00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:12.183
Then you can ask the other
people to do it too and you can

00:16:12.183 --> 00:16:13.896
compare with each other.
[laughter]

00:16:13.896 --> 00:16:17.629
And if you all survive this
exercise you'll be better for

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:18.572
it.
[laughter]

00:16:18.572 --> 00:16:20.850
What doesn't kill you makes you
stronger.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.810
That's the idea behind that
exercise.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.083
All right.
Now the social psychology of

00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:31.250
love really has been a social
psychology of attraction.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.210
What makes people find each
other attractive?

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.509
What makes them want to be
intimate?

00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:40.879
What makes them physically
desirable to each other?

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:45.713
What might lead to a
commitment, a decision to make a

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:49.710
commitment to make the
relationship last?

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.246
This is just so nice.
I'm giving this lecture on love

00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:55.240
and the two of you are holding
hands here in the front row.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.780
It's really-- [laughter]
And-- [applause]

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.888
All three elements present,
intimacy, passion,

00:17:04.888 --> 00:17:07.840
and-- [laughter]
Yeah.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.480
Okay.
[laughter] Good.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.180
Just checking.
[laughter] Okay.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.631
So what's interesting about the
social psychology of attraction

00:17:18.631 --> 00:17:22.059
is it has focused on seven
variables.

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:26.324
And I've divided these into two
groups, the big three and the

00:17:26.324 --> 00:17:29.854
more interesting four.
And I call them the big--The

00:17:29.854 --> 00:17:33.829
big three are three variables
that the effects are so powerful

00:17:33.829 --> 00:17:37.869
that they almost don't need to
be discussed in much detail.

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:41.294
The more interesting four are
the ones I'm going to focus on

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:44.834
in this lecture because they're
a bit more subtle and they may

00:17:44.834 --> 00:17:47.619
be things that you've never
heard of before.

00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:50.549
But let's quickly talk about
the big three.

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:54.677
The way to understand the big
three is with the phrase "all

00:17:54.677 --> 00:17:59.383
other things being equal."
All other things being equal,

00:17:59.383 --> 00:18:04.997
people who find themselves in
close spatial proximity to each

00:18:04.997 --> 00:18:08.764
other,
like sharing an armrest in a

00:18:08.764 --> 00:18:15.137
lecture, will be more likely to
be attracted to each other and

00:18:15.137 --> 00:18:20.336
form a romantic relationship.
Okay, all other things being

00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:22.460
equal.
Now this has been tested in

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.734
lots of interesting ways.
Studies have been done in the

00:18:25.734 --> 00:18:28.911
city of New York where you
can--if you live in Manhattan

00:18:28.911 --> 00:18:32.492
you can actually get a very nice
metric of how far apart people

00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:34.860
live from each other in city
blocks.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.938
Right?
You have a nice grid pattern

00:18:36.938 --> 00:18:40.209
and you can use a city block
metric to add up the number of

00:18:40.209 --> 00:18:43.826
blocks between people's doors.
And people who live more

00:18:43.826 --> 00:18:47.704
closely together are more likely
to end up in romantic

00:18:47.704 --> 00:18:51.410
relationships with each other.
It seems kind of obvious.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.924
Right?
This even works on college

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:56.378
campuses.
We can measure in feet the

00:18:56.378 --> 00:19:00.300
distance between the door to
your room and the door to every

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.756
other room of a student on
campus and there will be a

00:19:03.756 --> 00:19:07.279
correlation between the
likelihood of--it's a negative

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:10.802
correlation--the likelihood of
getting into a romantic

00:19:10.802 --> 00:19:14.857
relationship with a person and
the number of feet between your

00:19:14.857 --> 00:19:18.718
door and that person's door.
The fewer feet,

00:19:18.718 --> 00:19:22.014
the more likely a romantic
relationship,

00:19:22.014 --> 00:19:26.227
all other things being equal.
Now, all other things being

00:19:26.227 --> 00:19:29.140
equal is a big qualifier.
Right?

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.414
But if we could statistically
control for every other

00:19:32.414 --> 00:19:36.255
variable, all I'd need to do is
measure the distance from your

00:19:36.255 --> 00:19:40.033
door to everybody else's door on
campus and I could chart out

00:19:40.033 --> 00:19:44.000
who's going to fall in love with
whom on the Yale campus.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:53.140
Now, this idea in a way is--I
don't know.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.180
Maybe it's a little
counterintuitive.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.829
There is a kind of cultural
myth around the stranger,

00:19:59.829 --> 00:20:04.748
the person you don't know,
who you will--who you fall in

00:20:04.748 --> 00:20:07.794
love with.
And that is not likely to be

00:20:07.794 --> 00:20:10.550
the case if it's the person who
is nearby.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.063
Right?
And you'll see as we go through

00:20:14.063 --> 00:20:19.026
the other big--the other two
"big three" that there is a kind

00:20:19.026 --> 00:20:23.478
of repetition of this theme.
It isn't the stranger you fall

00:20:23.478 --> 00:20:24.930
in love with.
All right.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.210
Let's continue down.
Similarity.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.168
You've probably heard the
phrase "Birds of a feather flock

00:20:31.168 --> 00:20:34.849
together" and that's true when
it comes to romance.

00:20:34.849 --> 00:20:39.023
On any dimension that
psychologists have measured in

00:20:39.023 --> 00:20:43.229
these kinds of studies,
when people are more similar

00:20:43.229 --> 00:20:47.240
they are more likely to find
each other attractive.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.433
This could be obvious things
like height or age but it also

00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:55.700
could be things like attitudes
toward capital punishment,

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.670
preference for the Red Sox over
the Yankees.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.098
Right?
All of these are dimensions of

00:21:02.098 --> 00:21:04.368
similarity.
All things being equal,

00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:07.887
the more similar the more
likely you'll find each other

00:21:07.887 --> 00:21:11.786
attractive.
So, opposites don't really

00:21:11.786 --> 00:21:14.813
attract.
Birds of a feather may flock

00:21:14.813 --> 00:21:18.799
together but opposites don't
really attract each other.

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:22.423
Now, usually at this point
somebody in the lecture hall

00:21:22.423 --> 00:21:26.548
raises their hand and says,
"Well, my boyfriend or my

00:21:26.548 --> 00:21:31.864
girlfriend and I are complete
opposites and how do you account

00:21:31.864 --> 00:21:34.420
for that,
Professor Salovey?"

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:40.240
And I usually look at them and
I say, "Good luck."

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.978
[laughter]
And of course all things might

00:21:41.978 --> 00:21:44.790
not be equal.
There may be other variables at

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.833
play but, all things being
equal, similarity does not breed

00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:52.530
contempt.
Similarity breeds attraction.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.369
Okay?
Isn't it interesting?

00:21:55.369 --> 00:21:57.524
We have all of these common
sayings that contradict each

00:21:57.524 --> 00:22:00.395
other and then empirically,
some of them turn out to have

00:22:00.395 --> 00:22:02.970
more evidence supporting them
than others.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.720
So "opposites attract?"
Not much evidence.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.039
"Similarity breeds contempt?"
Not much evidence.

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:11.180
"Birds of a feather flock
together?"

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.560
Yeah, there's some evidence for
that anyway.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.465
Finally, familiarity.
Familiarity--We tend to fall in

00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:20.995
love with people in our
environment with whom we are

00:22:20.995 --> 00:22:24.910
already familiar.
The idea that some enchanted

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.701
evening we will see a
stranger--Where are The New Blue

00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:32.277
when you need them?
[laughter]

00:22:32.277 --> 00:22:35.510
"Some enchanted evening you
will see a stranger across a

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.160
crowded room."
Right?

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.340
What musical is that from?
"South Pacific."

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.012
Very good.
You will see a stranger across

00:22:44.012 --> 00:22:48.329
a crowded room.
That's kind of a cultural myth.

00:22:48.329 --> 00:22:52.176
Of course it happens,
but much more common is

00:22:52.176 --> 00:22:56.373
somebody you already know,
somebody you have seen

00:22:56.373 --> 00:23:01.444
repetitively you suddenly find
attraction--attractive and a

00:23:01.444 --> 00:23:05.000
relationship forms.
Okay?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.540
So the big three:
People who are similar to you,

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.286
people who are already familiar
to you, people who are nearby in

00:23:13.286 --> 00:23:15.645
space.
These are the people,

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:19.850
all things being equal,
that you will find attractive.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.150
Okay?
So those are the big three.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.187
Those are big main effects.
Those are big,

00:23:26.187 --> 00:23:30.799
easy to observe in various ways
in the lab.

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:33.697
By the way, the familiarity
idea doesn't just work for

00:23:33.697 --> 00:23:36.279
people.
I can show you words in a

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:41.209
language that you don't speak
and I can flash those words to

00:23:41.209 --> 00:23:46.390
you very quickly and I can later
repeat some of those words and

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:52.240
mix in some new ones that you've
never seen before and I can say,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.771
"I don't know--I know you don't
know what any of these words

00:23:55.771 --> 00:23:57.774
mean.
I know you can't read these

00:23:57.774 --> 00:24:00.238
characters but just,
if you had to tell me,

00:24:00.238 --> 00:24:03.642
which ones do you like and
which ones don't you like or how

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:07.023
much do you like each one?"
The ones you will like are the

00:24:07.023 --> 00:24:09.578
ones you saw earlier,
the ones that you already have

00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:12.153
familiarity.
Even if you don't remember

00:24:12.153 --> 00:24:15.308
having seen them,
even if that familiarity was

00:24:15.308 --> 00:24:18.744
generated with such quick
exposures that you don't

00:24:18.744 --> 00:24:21.549
remember even having seen
anything,

00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:25.980
you will get that familiarity
effect.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.650
Okay?
Good.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.773
The more interesting four.
These are more interesting

00:24:32.773 --> 00:24:35.614
because they're a little bit
complicated, a little bit

00:24:35.614 --> 00:24:38.024
subtle.
Let's start with actually the

00:24:38.024 --> 00:24:41.140
one that is my favorite.
This is "competence."

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.059
Think about other people in
your environment.

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:48.079
Think about people who are
competent.

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:51.000
Generally--And think about
people who are incompetent.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.705
Generally, we are more
attracted to people who seem

00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:58.288
competent to us.
Now, that isn't very

00:24:58.288 --> 00:25:01.933
interesting.
And it turns out that's not

00:25:01.933 --> 00:25:05.100
really the effect.
Yes, we're more attracted to

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.128
people who are competent than
people who we think are

00:25:08.128 --> 00:25:11.039
incompetent but people who are
super competent,

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:13.505
people who seem competent on
all dimensions,

00:25:13.505 --> 00:25:15.569
they're kind of threatening to
us.

00:25:15.569 --> 00:25:18.280
They don't make us feel so good
about ourselves.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.979
Right?
They make us feel a bit

00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:26.610
diminished by comparison.
So, what we really like--The

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.990
kind of person we're really
attracted to is the competent

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.119
individual who occasionally
blunders.

00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:39.185
And this is called the Pratfall
Effect, that our liking for the

00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:43.269
competent person grows when they
make a mistake,

00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:45.969
when they do something
embarrassing,

00:25:45.969 --> 00:25:48.900
when they have a failure
experience.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.043
Okay?
You can see this with public

00:25:52.043 --> 00:25:54.771
figures.
Public figures who are viewed

00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:58.256
as competent but who pratfall,
who make a mistake,

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:02.380
sometimes they are even more
popular after the mistake.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.673
Okay?
I think of Bill Clinton when he

00:26:07.673 --> 00:26:10.887
was President.
His popularity at the end of

00:26:10.887 --> 00:26:13.947
his term, despite what everyone
would agree, whether you like

00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:17.300
Bill Clinton or not,
was a big mistake with Monica

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.059
Lewinsky, his popularity didn't
suffer very much.

00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:23.677
A lot of people in the media
would describe him,

00:26:23.677 --> 00:26:26.240
"Well, he's just--It just shows
he's human."

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.988
He makes mistakes like the rest
of us, even though that was a

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.880
pretty big mistake.
Right?

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.960
And you could see this even
with smaller pratfalls.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.943
Sometimes public figures are
liked even more after their

00:26:37.943 --> 00:26:40.740
pratfall.
Now, the classic experiment,

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.382
the classic pratfall
experiment, is just a beautiful

00:26:44.382 --> 00:26:46.650
one to describe.
It's a work of art.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.170
So, let me tell you a little
bit about it.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.009
You're in this experiment.
You're brought to the lab and

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:57.012
you're listening to a tape
recording of interviews with

00:26:57.012 --> 00:27:01.162
people who are described as
possible representatives from

00:27:01.162 --> 00:27:04.349
your college to appear on a quiz
show.

00:27:04.349 --> 00:27:07.309
The quiz show is called
"College Bowl," which I don't

00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:10.440
think is on anymore but was on
when I was in college.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.311
And you're listening to
interviews with possible

00:27:13.311 --> 00:27:17.099
contestants from Yale who are
going to be on "College Bowl."

00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:20.241
You have to decide how
much--What you're told is you

00:27:20.241 --> 00:27:24.059
have to decide who should be
chosen to be on "College Bowl."

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.329
And you listen to these
interviews.

00:27:26.329 --> 00:27:30.186
Now what's interesting is
there's two types of people,

00:27:30.186 --> 00:27:33.970
the nearly perfect person and
the mediocre person.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:38.982
The nearly perfect person
answered 92% of the questions

00:27:38.982 --> 00:27:44.459
correctly, admitted modestly to
being a member of the campus

00:27:44.459 --> 00:27:49.075
honor society,
was the editor of the yearbook,

00:27:49.075 --> 00:27:53.631
and ran varsity track.
That's the nearly perfect

00:27:53.631 --> 00:27:57.043
person.
The mediocre person answers

00:27:57.043 --> 00:28:02.349
only 30% of the questions
correctly, admits that he has

00:28:02.349 --> 00:28:06.737
only average grades,
he worked on the yearbook as a

00:28:06.737 --> 00:28:10.849
proofreader, and he tried out
for the track team but didn't

00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:12.240
make it.
So, you see,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.191
they're keeping a lot of the
elements consistent but in one

00:28:15.191 --> 00:28:18.192
case he's kind of an average
performer and in the other case

00:28:18.192 --> 00:28:21.227
nearly perfect.
Now, which of these two people

00:28:21.227 --> 00:28:24.859
do you find more attractive in
listening to the tape?

00:28:24.859 --> 00:28:28.179
So, when they ask you questions
about which person should be on

00:28:28.179 --> 00:28:30.481
the quiz show,
people say the more competent

00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:32.726
person.
But they also ask questions

00:28:32.726 --> 00:28:35.670
like, "How attractive do you
find this person?"

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.000
Now, you're only listening to
an audiotape.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.789
How attractive do you find this
person?

00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:43.190
And the results are pretty
obvious.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:46.991
The competent person is rated
as much more attractive,

00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:51.080
considerably more attractive,
than the mediocre person.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.078
Okay?
If this were the end of the

00:28:54.078 --> 00:28:56.202
story though,
it would be a kind of boring

00:28:56.202 --> 00:28:58.430
story and it's not the end of
the story.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.674
Now, what happens is half of
the participants in the

00:29:01.674 --> 00:29:05.491
experiment who have listened to
each of these tapes--You only

00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:09.563
get to listen to one tape.
Half of them are assigned to

00:29:09.563 --> 00:29:13.267
the blunder condition.
And what happens in the blunder

00:29:13.267 --> 00:29:16.687
condition is the tape continues
and what you hear is the

00:29:16.687 --> 00:29:20.569
clattering of dishes,
a person saying--the person

00:29:20.569 --> 00:29:25.630
saying, "Oh, my goodness.
I've spilled coffee all over my

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.900
new suit."
Okay?

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.039
That's the blunder.
That's the pratfall.

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:33.488
Now you're asked,
"Who do you find more

00:29:33.488 --> 00:29:36.140
attractive?"
And look what happens.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.413
Your rating of the
attractiveness of the competent

00:29:41.413 --> 00:29:46.545
person grows even higher.
The competent person who

00:29:46.545 --> 00:29:50.440
blunders, this is the person
that I love.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.186
Unfortunately,
the mediocre person who

00:29:53.186 --> 00:29:56.750
blunders, you now think is even
more mediocre.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.427
[laughter] Right?
This is the sad irony in these

00:30:00.427 --> 00:30:03.981
experiments.
The effect works both ways so

00:30:03.981 --> 00:30:08.645
the mediocre become even more
lowered in your esteem,

00:30:08.645 --> 00:30:11.585
in your regard.
Now, I'll tell you a little

00:30:11.585 --> 00:30:14.432
personal story about my coming
to Yale that relates to this

00:30:14.432 --> 00:30:16.680
experiment.
This is one of the most famous

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.230
experiments in the history of
social psychology.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.710
I wouldn't quite put it up
there.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.978
You'll hear maybe later about,
or maybe you've already about

00:30:24.978 --> 00:30:28.668
Milgram and maybe Asch
conformity and maybe Robber's

00:30:28.668 --> 00:30:30.444
Cave.
Those are even better known

00:30:30.444 --> 00:30:32.070
than this, but this is right up
there.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.708
This is a top five experiment.
What--So--And it was done by

00:30:35.708 --> 00:30:39.777
Elliot Aronson who has retired
now, but for many years taught

00:30:39.777 --> 00:30:43.099
at the University of California
at Santa Cruz.

00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:45.970
The name is not one that you
need to know.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.788
In any case,
I came to Yale in 1981 as a

00:30:48.788 --> 00:30:52.979
graduate student and I was
looking for an adviser and I was

00:30:52.979 --> 00:30:57.026
kind of interviewing with a
faculty member at Yale at the

00:30:57.026 --> 00:31:00.608
time named Judy Rodin.
Some of you may know that name

00:31:00.608 --> 00:31:03.464
because she went on later to
become the President of the

00:31:03.464 --> 00:31:06.425
University of Pennsylvania and
now is the President of the

00:31:06.425 --> 00:31:10.436
Rockefeller Foundation.
But I was interviewing with her

00:31:10.436 --> 00:31:13.680
and set up a meeting.
And what I was trying to

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.195
persuade her in this meeting was
to take me on as one of her

00:31:17.195 --> 00:31:19.460
students, to let--to be my
adviser.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.022
And it's about my third or
fourth week of graduate school

00:31:22.022 --> 00:31:23.670
and I'm pretty nervous about
this.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.228
And she could be intimidating
to a first-year graduate

00:31:27.228 --> 00:31:30.033
student.
And I remember I was holding

00:31:30.033 --> 00:31:33.690
this mug of coffee and I was
pleading with her,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.710
trying to convince her to take
me on as her student,

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:36.740
and I was saying,
"Judy,

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:40.540
I'll get a lot done.
I'll work really hard.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.500
I can analyze data.
I can write."

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.651
And I'm talking about myself
and I'm swinging--I'm using my

00:31:46.651 --> 00:31:49.490
hands as I talk.
I'm swinging this cup of coffee

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.478
around.
And fairly soon into the

00:31:51.478 --> 00:31:55.376
conversation I demonstrated some
principle that you've probably

00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:59.086
learned in your physics class
having to do with an object at

00:31:59.086 --> 00:32:02.670
rest remaining at rest unless
acted upon by a force.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:07.596
Well, the object at rest was
the coffee in the cup and when I

00:32:07.596 --> 00:32:12.686
pulled the coffee cup out from
under the coffee it landed right

00:32:12.686 --> 00:32:17.776
on her desk and began--I watched
in slow motion as this wave of

00:32:17.776 --> 00:32:22.702
coffee just moved from my side
of the desk to her side of the

00:32:22.702 --> 00:32:25.425
desk.
She jumped up and jumped back

00:32:25.425 --> 00:32:28.906
and started moving papers around
and really was giving me this

00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:31.190
look like "Why don't you just
leave?"

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:35.212
So, I was trying to save the
moment as best as I could,

00:32:35.212 --> 00:32:40.412
and I looked at her and I said,
"Judy, do you remember that old

00:32:40.412 --> 00:32:44.304
experiment that Elliot Aronson
did [laughter]

00:32:44.304 --> 00:32:46.955
on attractiveness?"
[laughter]

00:32:46.955 --> 00:32:51.049
She looked at me kind of out of
the corner of her eye and I

00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:53.589
said, "Well, that was my
blunder.

00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:56.313
[laughter]
Now you're going to like me

00:32:56.313 --> 00:32:58.117
even more."
[laughter]

00:32:58.117 --> 00:33:02.184
And she just shook her head and
she said, "Peter,

00:33:02.184 --> 00:33:06.408
Peter, Peter.
You know that effect only works

00:33:06.408 --> 00:33:09.740
if I think you're competent
first."

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.967
[laughter]
Anyway, that was my

00:33:10.967 --> 00:33:13.000
introduction to Yale,
graduate school at Yale.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.619
[laughter] All right.
So blundering.

00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:19.257
Only blunder if you're
competent first and it will make

00:33:19.257 --> 00:33:23.859
you more attractive.
That is the Pratfall Effect.

00:33:23.859 --> 00:33:27.525
Let's move on and I'm going to
move a little bit quickly

00:33:27.525 --> 00:33:31.124
through all this because I want
to leave time for a few

00:33:31.124 --> 00:33:33.789
questions at the end of the
lecture.

00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:38.730
Let's talk about physical
attractiveness as number two of

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:44.086
the more interesting four.
Now physical attractiveness is

00:33:44.086 --> 00:33:48.828
one that really bothers us.
We don't like to believe that

00:33:48.828 --> 00:33:52.430
physical attractiveness accounts
for much in life.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.301
It seems unfair.
Except at the margins,

00:33:55.301 --> 00:33:58.759
there isn't much we can do
about physical attractiveness.

00:33:58.759 --> 00:34:02.724
And when we're not pictured in
The Rumpus it can really

00:34:02.724 --> 00:34:03.960
hurt.
[laughter]

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:09.030
So, we all like to believe that
physical attractiveness matters.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.686
And the interesting thing is if
you do surveys of college

00:34:12.686 --> 00:34:17.388
students and you say to them,
"Rate how important different

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:22.282
characteristics are in
relationships that you might be

00:34:22.282 --> 00:34:25.963
involved in,"
they will say that warmth is

00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:29.976
important, sensitivity is
important, intelligence is

00:34:29.976 --> 00:34:33.025
important,
compassion is important,

00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:37.751
a sense of humor is important,
and they'll say that looks

00:34:37.751 --> 00:34:42.017
aren't important.
But if you measure all of those

00:34:42.017 --> 00:34:45.510
things--Let's do it in a
different order.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:51.600
If you send everybody out on a
blind date and then you look at,

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.536
after the blind date,
how many of those people who

00:34:55.536 --> 00:34:58.710
are matched up blindly actually
go on a second date,

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:04.803
actually get together again,
what predicts who gets together

00:35:04.803 --> 00:35:08.080
again?
Was it the rating of warmth?

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.910
No.
Sensitivity?

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.700
No.
Intelligence?

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.720
No.
Compassion?

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.560
No.
Sense of humor?

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.440
No.
What was it?

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.782
Looks.
So we believe that looks don't

00:35:24.782 --> 00:35:28.820
matter and unfortunately they
do.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.704
Now, the good news in all of
this is the studies that looked

00:35:32.704 --> 00:35:36.522
at physical attractiveness in
this way were just looking at

00:35:36.522 --> 00:35:39.880
what predicts a second date
after a first date.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.315
Obviously, what predicts a
long-term relationship are

00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:47.345
probably things less superficial
than looks, or at least other

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:51.766
things in addition to looks.
But it is a great predictor of

00:35:51.766 --> 00:35:55.080
a second date.
And college students year after

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.590
year say, "But it's not
important."

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:01.127
And it's one of those classic
disassociations between what we

00:36:01.127 --> 00:36:04.724
think is unimportant and what
empirically turns out to be more

00:36:04.724 --> 00:36:06.138
important.
Alright well,

00:36:06.138 --> 00:36:08.766
there are very interesting
studies that have been done with

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:12.957
physical attractiveness.
At the University of Minnesota,

00:36:12.957 --> 00:36:16.690
a computer algorithm paired
people up.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:20.139
It couldn't have been a very
complicated algorithm because it

00:36:20.139 --> 00:36:23.130
basically paired people up
randomly on the campus.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:28.066
But the computer--but a lot of
data about all the students on

00:36:28.066 --> 00:36:33.167
campus were--was collected--were
collected and people were then

00:36:33.167 --> 00:36:36.869
randomly paired up and sent to
the dance.

00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:39.300
And then they were tracked over
time.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.280
And just as in the thought
experiment I just gave you,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.710
the University of Minnesota
students acted in the same way.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:50.121
If the computer--If they rated
their partner as attractive,

00:36:50.121 --> 00:36:54.228
the randomly assigned partner,
they were more likely to

00:36:54.228 --> 00:36:59.222
continue the relationship.
Now it's interesting to ask,

00:36:59.222 --> 00:37:02.046
"why?"
And we have to start to look at

00:37:02.046 --> 00:37:06.131
other experiments to try to get
at what is it about physical

00:37:06.131 --> 00:37:10.840
attractiveness that makes people
want to pursue the relationship?

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:15.297
And once again Elliot Aronson,
the person who did the blunder

00:37:15.297 --> 00:37:19.309
experiment, the "Pratfall"
experiment, he did some nice

00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:23.385
work on attractiveness as well.
And in one experiment,

00:37:23.385 --> 00:37:26.940
which many people know as the
"Frizzy Wig" experiment,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.257
he did the following.
He invited a confederate,

00:37:30.257 --> 00:37:33.604
a graduate student who was
working with him in his

00:37:33.604 --> 00:37:37.565
lab--Psychologists--Social
psychologists always call people

00:37:37.565 --> 00:37:41.800
who are in the employ of the
experimenter "confederates."

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.063
It doesn't mean that they grew
up south of the Mason-Dixon Line

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:50.120
or wave a certain kind of flag
or--but the older term for it

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.271
was "stooge."
They would say,

00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:55.738
"We hired a stooge to act in
the following role in the

00:37:55.738 --> 00:37:57.857
experiment."
But I think a certain

00:37:57.857 --> 00:38:01.160
generation of college students
thought stooges were only named

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.431
Moe,
Larry, and Curly and so they

00:38:03.431 --> 00:38:06.199
started to use the phrase
"confederate."

00:38:06.199 --> 00:38:08.300
Now, they'll usually just say,
"We hired an actor."

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.767
But anyway, the confederate
that they hired was a woman who

00:38:12.767 --> 00:38:17.621
was naturally attractive in most
people's view but they made her

00:38:17.621 --> 00:38:22.166
look either more attractive or
less attractive by giving her

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:27.829
kind of frumpy clothes,
bad make-up, and a frizzy wig.

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:30.976
And it was the frizzy wig that
everybody remembers from this

00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:33.110
experiment.
And what she does in the

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.469
experiment is she poses as a
graduate student in clinical

00:38:36.469 --> 00:38:40.070
psychology who is interviewing
male participants – only men

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.598
in this experiment.
And at the end of the interview

00:38:44.598 --> 00:38:50.475
she gives them her own personal
clinical evaluation of their

00:38:50.475 --> 00:38:52.880
personality.
Okay?

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.584
So, that's all it is.
They have this interview with

00:38:54.584 --> 00:38:57.105
this woman.
She's either made to look very

00:38:57.105 --> 00:39:01.526
good or she's made to look kind
of ugly with this frizzy wig and

00:39:01.526 --> 00:39:05.000
they talk to her.
She gives them an evaluation of

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.515
their personality.
Half of the subjects receive a

00:39:08.515 --> 00:39:11.059
favorable personality
assessment.

00:39:11.059 --> 00:39:15.900
Half of them receive a kind of
unfavorable evaluation.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.428
How do they respond?
Well, when she was made to look

00:39:20.428 --> 00:39:25.188
attractive they were delighted
when she gave them positive

00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:30.070
feedback about themselves.
When she was made to--When she

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.581
gave--When she was made to look
attractive but gave them

00:39:34.581 --> 00:39:38.190
unfavorable information about
themselves,

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:42.860
they were really upset about it.
When she was made to look

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:48.118
unattractive they didn't really
care what kind of information

00:39:48.118 --> 00:39:51.751
she gave.
It didn't really matter whether

00:39:51.751 --> 00:39:55.243
it was positive or not.
It didn't really make any

00:39:55.243 --> 00:39:58.010
difference.
It was interesting.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.762
In the condition where she was
made to look attractive but gave

00:40:01.762 --> 00:40:05.581
you bad feedback about yourself,
often the subjects in that

00:40:05.581 --> 00:40:09.578
condition would look for an
opportunity to interact with her

00:40:09.578 --> 00:40:12.337
in the future,
obviously to try to prove that

00:40:12.337 --> 00:40:15.760
her evaluation was wrong.
It mattered that much to them.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.635
So there's kind of this idea
that attractive people,

00:40:19.635 --> 00:40:22.599
their feedback to us has more
impact.

00:40:22.599 --> 00:40:26.212
I'm not saying this is fair,
I'm not saying it's rational,

00:40:26.212 --> 00:40:30.218
I'm not endorsing it,
but empirically-- excuse

00:40:30.218 --> 00:40:35.102
me--empirically we can see it,
that somehow the

00:40:35.102 --> 00:40:41.261
attractive--the feedback from
the attractive person matters

00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:43.719
more to us.
Okay.

00:40:43.719 --> 00:40:47.390
Number three of the more
interesting four.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:52.214
Gain, loss.
This is really a general idea

00:40:52.214 --> 00:40:57.576
in psychology that we are in a
way wired up to be more

00:40:57.576 --> 00:41:02.130
sensitive to change than to
steady states.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.809
And you could imagine why that
might be true.

00:41:04.809 --> 00:41:10.351
Change often signals danger or
opportunity and if we are

00:41:10.351 --> 00:41:15.994
especially tuned-in to change,
it helps us survive and it

00:41:15.994 --> 00:41:21.429
helps us pass along our genes.
Okay?

00:41:21.429 --> 00:41:23.310
So we're more sensitive to
change.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:28.665
How does that play out in love?
Well, in love we are--what is

00:41:28.665 --> 00:41:35.092
very powerful to us is not just
that someone always is positive

00:41:35.092 --> 00:41:37.229
toward us,
"I love you,

00:41:37.229 --> 00:41:40.780
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love --" Right?

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.050
It wears out its welcome.
What's more powerful is the

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:51.332
person who was not that positive
to us but over time becomes more

00:41:51.332 --> 00:41:55.249
positive.
The first derivative of their

00:41:55.249 --> 00:41:59.150
regard for us is positive.
Okay?

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.460
Aronson calls this the "Gain
Effect."

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:06.351
We are really attracted to
people whose regard for us is

00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:10.429
gaining momentum over time.
Okay?

00:42:10.429 --> 00:42:14.667
And even if over a period of
time the average amount of their

00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:18.482
regard is lower because they
started lower and then got

00:42:18.482 --> 00:42:21.590
higher than someone who was
always high,

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:26.010
it's the ones who were first
lower who then went up that

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.772
capture our attention.
The first derivative is more

00:42:29.772 --> 00:42:33.372
important than just the position
of their regard for us,

00:42:33.372 --> 00:42:37.246
getting better and better.
Now, what's interesting is

00:42:37.246 --> 00:42:42.411
there is also a loss effect.
People who really hurt us are

00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:47.110
not the people who have always
been negative.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:51.039
The person who every time they
sees you hates you,

00:42:51.039 --> 00:42:55.209
says they hate you and
accompanies it with an obscene

00:42:55.209 --> 00:42:59.540
gesture--after a while this
person can't hurt you.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.940
Right?
There's a country song that

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:07.956
Ricky Skaggs sings that has the
phrase in it "Nothing can hurt

00:43:07.956 --> 00:43:12.078
you like the person you love."
That's what hurts,

00:43:12.078 --> 00:43:16.381
the person who always was
positive who now--whose regard

00:43:16.381 --> 00:43:18.889
starts to fade.
Oh.

00:43:18.889 --> 00:43:20.590
You can only hurt the one you
love.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.769
Right?
You can only hurt the one you

00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:26.119
love because you are expecting
positive feedback from the one

00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:29.855
you love.
And when that turns negative,

00:43:29.855 --> 00:43:33.090
it's a blow.
It's a blow to the solar plexus.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.298
Right?
So you can only hurt the one

00:43:36.298 --> 00:43:39.442
you can love but the one who
always loves you sometimes has

00:43:39.442 --> 00:43:41.719
trouble showing you that they
love you.

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:46.089
The one who didn't really love
you that much but then starts to

00:43:46.089 --> 00:43:49.825
show you that they love you,
that person is a powerful

00:43:49.825 --> 00:43:54.820
influence on your behavior.
Okay.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.320
The last--Oops.
Come back.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:02.248
The last set of studies--Have
you talked about Schacter,

00:44:02.248 --> 00:44:04.760
Singer's "Emotions"?
Okay.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.039
So let me describe to you this
phenomenon.

00:44:08.039 --> 00:44:16.504
This is a phenomenon about the
misattribution for the causes of

00:44:16.504 --> 00:44:20.238
arousal.
You feel physiologically

00:44:20.238 --> 00:44:24.383
aroused but you're not
completely sure why,

00:44:24.383 --> 00:44:29.219
and you have to make up an
explanation for it.

00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:33.472
I think what I want to do--And
sometimes that explanation is

00:44:33.472 --> 00:44:37.797
accurate, but the ones that are
interesting here are the ones

00:44:37.797 --> 00:44:41.978
where you misattribute the cause
of the arousal--you make a

00:44:41.978 --> 00:44:46.302
mistake and think it's love when
it might be due to something

00:44:46.302 --> 00:44:49.265
else.
So, let's do a thought

00:44:49.265 --> 00:44:52.485
experiment.
I'm a Yale college student,

00:44:52.485 --> 00:44:56.872
for the purposes of this
thought experiment and I live in

00:44:56.872 --> 00:45:02.199
Pierson because I need to walk a
great distance to Chapel Street,

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:04.800
to the Starbuck's on Chapel
Street.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.632
And I have a friend who I don't
know that well,

00:45:07.632 --> 00:45:11.327
somebody who was sitting next
to me in class a few weeks in a

00:45:11.327 --> 00:45:14.628
row.
And I said, "Would you like to

00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:20.058
go see The New Blue in concert
and then get coffee after it

00:45:20.058 --> 00:45:24.240
Friday night?"
And she says to me, "Sure.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.771
I would do that."
And so The New Blue concert

00:45:27.771 --> 00:45:30.904
takes place in the
Pierson-Davenport Theater in the

00:45:30.904 --> 00:45:34.475
basement there – what used to
be a squash court is now a

00:45:34.475 --> 00:45:38.172
little theater – and we enjoy
ourselves at the concert and

00:45:38.172 --> 00:45:41.410
then I say,
"Let's go to Starbuck's and get

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:44.871
a coffee."
And so, we walk that distance

00:45:44.871 --> 00:45:49.639
from Pierson College down to the
York Street Gate,

00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:53.033
over to Chapel Street,
make the left on Chapel Street,

00:45:53.033 --> 00:45:57.380
another block down to High,
walk into the Starbuck's.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:01.551
And she says to me,
"You know, I'd better have a

00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:07.410
decaf because it's kind of late
and I want to be able to sleep."

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.690
And I say, "That's fine.
Whatever you want."

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.850
She says, "Yeah.
So I'll have a decaf double

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.200
espresso mocha skinny with a--"
What?

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.969
What other dimensions are there?
[laughter] Right?

00:46:18.969 --> 00:46:24.240
"A double espresso mocha skinny
frothed."

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.660
[laughter] And I say, "Okay.
Fine.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.676
I'll have a coffee."
[laughter]

00:46:27.676 --> 00:46:30.349
And I go up there and I order
the drinks.

00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:35.299
"I'll have a small coffee
please and a double espresso

00:46:35.299 --> 00:46:40.809
mocha skinny frothed" except the
barista makes a mistake.

00:46:40.809 --> 00:46:43.720
Did the word "barista" exist
before Starbuck's?

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:48.449
[laughter] I don't think so.
The barista makes a mistake.

00:46:48.449 --> 00:46:53.327
The barista uses caffeinated
coffee in the drink instead of

00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:57.280
decaf, doesn't tell anybody,
doesn't tell me.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.506
I don't see it.
I just come back with my black

00:47:01.506 --> 00:47:07.342
coffee and my double espresso
mocha latte skinny frothed,

00:47:07.342 --> 00:47:12.140
except it isn't espresso.
It's got two shots of

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.540
caffeinated espresso.
I'm sorry.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.369
It isn't decaffeinated.
It's got two shots of

00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:21.624
caffeinated espresso in it.
And I put it down on the table

00:47:21.624 --> 00:47:25.681
and we're having this nice
conversation and we're drinking

00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:29.950
our beverages and it's about
12:30/1:00 now and Starbuck's is

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:33.579
closing and it's time to walk
back to Pierson.

00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:37.649
And we're walking back to
Pierson and we leave the

00:47:37.649 --> 00:47:41.469
Starbuck's, we make a left on
Chapel Street,

00:47:41.469 --> 00:47:45.550
we're walking up to York,
I'm getting a little sleepy,

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.400
but my friend looks at me and
says,

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.900
"Huh.
I feel a little funny."

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:55.611
What's actually happening?
Her heart is beating a little

00:47:55.611 --> 00:48:00.524
faster, her palms are beginning
to sweat, her breath is coming a

00:48:00.524 --> 00:48:03.800
little shorter than it otherwise
would.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.639
"I don't know.
Is it warm in here?"

00:48:08.639 --> 00:48:12.617
And she said,
"I don't think I've felt this

00:48:12.617 --> 00:48:16.870
way in a very long time.
[laughter] "Gee.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:21.010
It couldn't be the coffee.
I ordered decaf.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.489
What could this be?
What.."

00:48:23.489 --> 00:48:29.100
And she turns and she looks at
me [laughter]

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:34.580
and she says,
"What a day this has been.

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:39.962
What a rare mood I'm in.
Why, it's almost like being in

00:48:39.962 --> 00:48:41.082
love."
[laughter]

00:48:41.082 --> 00:48:44.077
And it is almost like being in
love except what it really is is

00:48:44.077 --> 00:48:46.154
two shots of caffeinated
espresso [laughter]

00:48:46.154 --> 00:48:50.191
causing a rapid heart rate,
an increase in respiration,

00:48:50.191 --> 00:48:53.605
sweaty palms,
but I don't realize--she

00:48:53.605 --> 00:48:57.019
doesn't realize that's what it
is.

00:48:57.019 --> 00:49:00.174
She turns to the most
salient--and this is the way

00:49:00.174 --> 00:49:03.972
social psychologists would say
it--turns to the most salient

00:49:03.972 --> 00:49:07.577
object in her immediate social
environment--that would be

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:10.409
me--and [laughter]
says she's in love.

00:49:10.409 --> 00:49:13.404
That's the idea of
misattribution--aroused due to

00:49:13.404 --> 00:49:16.150
something else,
"don't know what that is."

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.700
It's best if you don't know
what that is or even if you do

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.729
mistakenly attribute it,
misattribute it,

00:49:22.729 --> 00:49:26.340
to physical attraction,
romance, intimacy,

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.940
passion and commitment,
it's love.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.209
All right.
Now, I don't necessarily

00:49:33.209 --> 00:49:39.857
recommend that you do this
thought experiment in vivo this

00:49:39.857 --> 00:49:42.961
weekend,
although if you're lonely you

00:49:42.961 --> 00:49:45.097
might want to try it but
[laughter]

00:49:45.097 --> 00:49:48.678
we can go--we can take this
idea right--We can actually do

00:49:48.678 --> 00:49:51.559
research on this.
We could take it into the lab.

00:49:51.559 --> 00:49:54.744
But before I tell you about lab
experiments let me tell you

00:49:54.744 --> 00:49:57.710
about the most famous field
experiment on this idea.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:00.489
We call this the "Rickety
Bridge" experiment.

00:50:00.489 --> 00:50:05.053
And there is a bridge at the
University of British Columbia

00:50:05.053 --> 00:50:09.145
that crosses a river that runs
through campus and the

00:50:09.145 --> 00:50:12.449
rickety--There's actually two
bridges.

00:50:12.449 --> 00:50:16.570
The rickety bridge is one
that's kind of a rope bridge.

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:19.150
It's hundreds of feet above the
river.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:23.179
It sways in the breeze.
It's only about three feet wide.

00:50:23.179 --> 00:50:26.152
You kind of hold on to it
carefully and you cross the

00:50:26.152 --> 00:50:27.939
river.
It's a pretty scary way to

00:50:27.939 --> 00:50:30.472
cross that river.
Has anybody been--seen this

00:50:30.472 --> 00:50:31.490
bridge?
It's still there.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:32.910
Yes.
You know this bridge.

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:35.199
Okay.
There's another way to cross

00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:38.162
the river.
It's on a low bridge near the

00:50:38.162 --> 00:50:41.258
water, solid wood planks,
nice and wide,

00:50:41.258 --> 00:50:45.862
hand railings made out of solid
wood, and you can cross the

00:50:45.862 --> 00:50:49.440
bridge that way.
So, what two investigators at

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.867
the University of British
Columbia did is they simply

00:50:52.867 --> 00:50:57.883
positioned,
once again, an attractive actor

00:50:57.883 --> 00:51:03.429
or confederate on one side of
the bridge.

00:51:03.429 --> 00:51:10.079
She was a woman and she met men
crossing the bridge.

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:13.823
And she would intercept them as
they came across the rickety

00:51:13.823 --> 00:51:17.393
bridge, or the low bridge,
and she would ask them a few

00:51:17.393 --> 00:51:20.980
questions and conclude with,
"Can you write me a story?

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.569
You would help me out with my
experiment if you'd just write a

00:51:24.569 --> 00:51:27.803
little story right now."
Then she would collect their

00:51:27.803 --> 00:51:30.846
story and she would say,
"If you have any questions

00:51:30.846 --> 00:51:33.949
about this experiment,
here is my phone number."

00:51:33.949 --> 00:51:35.889
Actually, this happens when
you're in experiments.

00:51:35.889 --> 00:51:37.850
You get the phone number of the
experimenter.

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.901
What happens?
Well, the men,

00:51:40.901 --> 00:51:44.839
male students,
who cross the rickety bridge,

00:51:44.839 --> 00:51:50.150
they wrote these sexy stories
with interesting content,

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:56.139
with kind of little bit ribald
themes.

00:51:56.139 --> 00:52:00.923
And the people on the solid
bridge, they just wrote pretty

00:52:00.923 --> 00:52:03.855
boring stories.
The people who crossed the

00:52:03.855 --> 00:52:07.328
rickety bridge were more likely
to call her up later and say,

00:52:07.328 --> 00:52:08.963
"Yeah.
I'd like to talk about that

00:52:08.963 --> 00:52:11.750
experiment I was in.
Could we meet at the Starbuck's?

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.576
[laughter]
You drink decaf,

00:52:13.576 --> 00:52:15.449
don't you?"
Right?

00:52:15.449 --> 00:52:19.969
And the people on the low
bridge were much less likely to

00:52:19.969 --> 00:52:22.090
call her up.
Okay?

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:25.144
What was going on?
Well, this was interpreted as

00:52:25.144 --> 00:52:28.488
misattributed arousal.
On the rickety bridge you're

00:52:28.488 --> 00:52:31.996
swaying in the breeze hundreds
of feet above the water,

00:52:31.996 --> 00:52:34.720
the bridge seems unstable.
Maybe you'll make it.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.643
Maybe you won't.
Your heart is beating,

00:52:36.643 --> 00:52:39.309
your palms are sweating,
you're breathing harder.

00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:42.755
You meet this person and she
seems more attractive because

00:52:42.755 --> 00:52:47.004
you're feeling all these things.
And you attribute it to the

00:52:47.004 --> 00:52:50.778
attraction.
Now, there's a reason why this

00:52:50.778 --> 00:52:56.094
study is bad science.
There's a major flaw in this

00:52:56.094 --> 00:52:59.274
study.
The clue to the flaw is that

00:52:59.274 --> 00:53:03.160
you can't even call this study
an experiment.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.730
What's the flaw?
Anybody.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:11.438
Yes.
Student: The people who

00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:14.054
would take the rickety bridge
might be more likely to be more

00:53:14.054 --> 00:53:15.667
[inaudible]
Dean Peter Salovey:

00:53:15.667 --> 00:53:18.022
People who take the rickety
bridge might be the kind of

00:53:18.022 --> 00:53:20.638
people who are more looking for
adventure than the people who

00:53:20.638 --> 00:53:22.550
take the solid bridge.
Right.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:26.723
Another way of saying it is
there isn't random assignment of

00:53:26.723 --> 00:53:30.260
the subjects to the two
conditions in the study.

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.190
That's no random assignment;
it's not an experiment.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:37.636
You--By not randomly assigning
people to these two conditions,

00:53:37.636 --> 00:53:41.573
you may be capturing just
individual differences in the

00:53:41.573 --> 00:53:45.022
kind of person who,
when there's a perfectly

00:53:45.022 --> 00:53:47.237
stable, safe,
low bridge, says,

00:53:47.237 --> 00:53:49.028
"Huh uh.
I won't want to go on that

00:53:49.028 --> 00:53:51.584
bridge.
I want to go on the bridge

00:53:51.584 --> 00:53:55.659
where I have to risk my life to
get to class."

00:53:55.659 --> 00:53:57.624
[laughter]
And then should it surprise us

00:53:57.624 --> 00:54:00.275
that that's the kind of person
who would call a perfect

00:54:00.275 --> 00:54:03.172
stranger on the telephone and
write a sexy story and give it

00:54:03.172 --> 00:54:04.390
to them?
[laughter] Right?

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:07.119
We're not so surprised.
So what we have to do,

00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:11.420
of course, is take it in to the
lab and do this in a more

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.570
systematic way with random
assignment.

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:17.870
And this is how I'll want to
finish up today.

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:21.130
We have until 2:45,3:45?
Okay.

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.241
Great.
I'll take about five more

00:54:23.241 --> 00:54:27.019
minutes to finish up and that'll
give us some time for questions.

00:54:27.019 --> 00:54:30.500
So how do you do this in the
lab?

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:36.798
Well, you can bring people in
to the lab and I can present you

00:54:36.798 --> 00:54:42.683
with a confederate who--Let's
say you are all in condition

00:54:42.683 --> 00:54:45.414
one,
everybody on this side of the

00:54:45.414 --> 00:54:48.960
room, and I can say to all of
you, "Please wait here.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:53.730
We'll begin the experiment in a
moment.

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:56.449
While you're waiting please
fill out this form."

00:54:56.449 --> 00:55:01.260
And the form includes how
attractive--how attracted you

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:04.199
are to the experimenter,
to me.

00:55:04.199 --> 00:55:06.469
I can do the same thing over
here.

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:10.935
I can give you the form and ask
you to rate how attractive you

00:55:10.935 --> 00:55:15.035
think I am and I can give you
the same instruction with a

00:55:15.035 --> 00:55:18.110
crucial difference:
"Please wait here.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:24.750
We will begin the painful shock
experiment in a moment.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.710
Please fill out these forms
while you wait."

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:31.436
What happens?
The people who got the painful

00:55:31.436 --> 00:55:35.871
shock instruction are more
likely to find the confederate

00:55:35.871 --> 00:55:38.519
attractive.
[laughter] Why?

00:55:38.519 --> 00:55:41.382
While they're sitting there
thinking about painful shock

00:55:41.382 --> 00:55:43.360
it's making their heart beat
faster,

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:47.727
it's making their palms sweat,
it's making them breathe harder

00:55:47.727 --> 00:55:50.365
maybe.
And even though it's fairly

00:55:50.365 --> 00:55:54.496
obvious what's doing that,
they still misattribute that

00:55:54.496 --> 00:55:57.710
arousal to "I must be falling in
love,"

00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:02.366
even with that obvious a--even
with that obvious an

00:56:02.366 --> 00:56:05.230
instruction.
You can do this in other ways.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:08.850
You can bring--Here is one of
my favorite ones.

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:12.376
You bring people in the lab.
We'll make them the control

00:56:12.376 --> 00:56:14.972
group this time.
We bring you in the--to the lab

00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:17.849
and we say to this group of
people, "Please wait here.

00:56:17.849 --> 00:56:20.079
We'll begin the experiment in a
moment.

00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:22.130
You can fill out these forms in
the meantime."

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:25.510
The forms ask how attracted you
are to the experimenter.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.075
You're now in the experimental
group and I say,

00:56:30.075 --> 00:56:33.586
"Please wait here.
We'll begin the experiment in a

00:56:33.586 --> 00:56:35.583
moment.
I'm going to ask you to fill

00:56:35.583 --> 00:56:38.218
out some forms but first,
to get ready for this

00:56:38.218 --> 00:56:40.631
experiment,
I'd like you to get on this

00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:42.780
treadmill and run for ten
minutes."

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:46.730
So you've run on the treadmill.
You've just sat around.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:49.667
The people who've run on the
treadmill, even when that

00:56:49.667 --> 00:56:53.508
arousal is fairly obvious,
you've got--you--doing a little

00:56:53.508 --> 00:56:57.567
bit of aerobic exercise,
you still find the experimenter

00:56:57.567 --> 00:56:59.900
more attractive.
Okay?

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:05.525
This is why the fourth floor of
Payne Whitney Gym is such a

00:57:05.525 --> 00:57:10.958
dangerous place [laughter]
and I urge you as your dean to

00:57:10.958 --> 00:57:14.230
be very careful there.
[laughter] Okay?

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:18.150
It's that combination of
aerobic exercise and spandex

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:20.790
[laughter]
that leads to trouble.

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:22.292
All right.
Now, here's the final

00:57:22.292 --> 00:57:24.340
experiment and I apologize for
this.

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:31.400
It is a bit sexist in 2007
context, but let me explain.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.799
And we could never do this--and
one could never do this

00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:38.576
experiment today but let me go
through it with you and you'll

00:57:38.576 --> 00:57:41.409
apologize for its--some of its
qualities.

00:57:41.409 --> 00:57:45.664
In this experiment male
subjects were brought in to the

00:57:45.664 --> 00:57:49.603
lab and they were asked to look
at centerfolds from

00:57:49.603 --> 00:57:53.409
Playboy magazine.
So, these are essentially

00:57:53.409 --> 00:57:58.356
photographs of naked women.
And they are wearing headphones

00:57:58.356 --> 00:58:04.262
that amplify their heartbeat and
they are asked among other

00:58:04.262 --> 00:58:10.576
things how attracted are they to
the centerfold photograph that

00:58:10.576 --> 00:58:14.123
they're looking at.
So, maybe--I don't remember how

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:16.610
many they look at.
Maybe it's about 10.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:20.989
So, these slides are coming up.
They've got the headphones on.

00:58:20.989 --> 00:58:26.583
The headphones are amplifying
their heartbeat and the slides

00:58:26.583 --> 00:58:32.272
are moving one after another for
a few seconds each slide and

00:58:32.272 --> 00:58:36.160
they're listening to their
heartbeat.

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:42.780
Slide one.
Slide two.

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:48.180
Slide three.
Slide four.

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:55.300
Slide five.
Slide six.

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:58.947
And then they're asked which
one did you find most

00:58:58.947 --> 00:59:02.670
attractive, which one are you
most attracted to?

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:07.027
"Oh, slide five, absolutely.
She's the woman I want to

00:59:07.027 --> 00:59:09.139
marry."
[laughter] Right?

00:59:09.139 --> 00:59:13.982
And what has happened is
they're using this bodily cue of

00:59:13.982 --> 00:59:18.652
their heartbeat to infer that
that's who they find more

00:59:18.652 --> 00:59:22.250
attractive.
Now, here is the twist.

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.739
They're not actually listening
to their heartbeat.

00:59:25.739 --> 00:59:31.010
They're listening to a tape
recording of a heartbeat.

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:35.186
And the experimenter is back
there with the speed knob

00:59:35.186 --> 00:59:38.416
[laughter]
and at random intervals he just

00:59:38.416 --> 00:59:41.804
speeds up the tape of their
heart [laughter]

00:59:41.804 --> 00:59:46.608
and then slows it down.
And it doesn't matter which

00:59:46.608 --> 00:59:51.179
slide he speeds up the tape of
the heartbeat on,

00:59:51.179 --> 00:59:56.171
that's the one the subject is
more likely to think is the

00:59:56.171 --> 01:00:00.610
person of their dreams,
the person they're attracted to.

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:04.780
So even you can misattribute
real arousal.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:09.762
You can even misattribute phony
arousal, arousal that isn't even

01:00:09.762 --> 01:00:13.782
coming from your body.
It's just coming--It's just

01:00:13.782 --> 01:00:18.310
being played to you randomly.
You can even misattribute that.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.736
Okay.
I think these experiments are

01:00:20.736 --> 01:00:24.690
cute and I think there's an
interesting phenomenon there.

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:28.184
And it says something,
in a way, about how easily we

01:00:28.184 --> 01:00:31.609
can be misled as to what things
in our environment,

01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:34.829
even things coming from our own
body, mean.

01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:38.547
But there's also some very
serious implications of this

01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:41.550
kind of work.
One of them has to do with

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.804
domestic violence.
So think about domestic

01:00:44.804 --> 01:00:48.670
violence situations and why
people stay in them.

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:51.130
Why do people stay in
relationships that are violent?

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:55.338
Now the number one reason,
and we have to acknowledge it

01:00:55.338 --> 01:00:58.628
up front, is usually
economically there's no

01:00:58.628 --> 01:01:02.989
alternative or people believe
there's no alternative.

01:01:02.989 --> 01:01:06.280
"I can't leave because if I
leave I'd be homeless.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.494
If I leave I will starve,
if my--if I leave my kids will

01:01:10.494 --> 01:01:13.789
starve or there'll be danger to
my kids."

01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:17.739
And that keeps people trapped
in abusive relationships

01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:21.838
but--And that's number one,
but what else might be going

01:01:21.838 --> 01:01:24.892
on?
Sometimes people don't realize

01:01:24.892 --> 01:01:30.295
that the relationship they're in
is abusive--it's psychologically

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:34.380
or emotionally abusive.
They get into these fights and

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.530
screaming matches and
name-calling and such even if

01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:42.590
it's not physical violence.
And they feel a certain arousal

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:47.090
when that happens and they
misattribute it.

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:50.902
"Well, he wouldn't be yelling
and screaming at me if he didn't

01:01:50.902 --> 01:01:52.730
love me."
Right?

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:55.789
They misattribute that,
what might be anger,

01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:58.776
what might even be aggression
and violence,

01:01:58.776 --> 01:02:03.664
to an expression of love.
I have a friend who's a social

01:02:03.664 --> 01:02:09.407
psychologist who told me a story
once that really made me very

01:02:09.407 --> 01:02:14.436
nervous, although she's fine.
She said, "When I was dating my

01:02:14.436 --> 01:02:18.209
husband"--this is thirty years
ago--"we were having a tough

01:02:18.209 --> 01:02:19.815
time.
We were in many,

01:02:19.815 --> 01:02:23.547
many arguments--We got into
many, many arguments and one

01:02:23.547 --> 01:02:27.753
time something happened where he
came up to my car in a parking

01:02:27.753 --> 01:02:31.349
lot and he was yelling at me
through the window.

01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:35.016
And I rolled up the window and
before you know it he had

01:02:35.016 --> 01:02:39.273
punched out the window."
And yelling at her and punched

01:02:39.273 --> 01:02:41.789
out the window.
He didn't touch her.

01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:46.039
And he--she said to me,
"That's when I knew he really

01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:49.571
loved me."
And I thought that's scary and

01:02:49.571 --> 01:02:53.653
I--and, all joking aside,
that's scary but that's

01:02:53.653 --> 01:02:57.450
misattributed arousal.
"I'm feeling--when he did that

01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:59.900
I felt something and I assumed
it was love.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.545
What she was misattributing as
love--Well, she was

01:03:03.545 --> 01:03:07.190
misattributing his aggressive
response as love.

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:12.351
She was misattributing her own
fear as mutual attraction,

01:03:12.351 --> 01:03:17.182
as "And I must love him."
So, although we joke about

01:03:17.182 --> 01:03:22.316
these kinds of experiments,
and they are fun to talk about

01:03:22.316 --> 01:03:25.650
because they are unusual and
cute,

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.135
there is also some serious
implications of this kind of

01:03:28.135 --> 01:03:31.599
work that one might think about.
And you might think about other

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:34.460
possible implications as well.
Okay.

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.407
Let me stop there and see what
kinds of questions we might

01:03:37.407 --> 01:03:38.230
have.
[applause]

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:39.980
Dean Peter Salovey:
Thank you.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.599
Thanks very much.
That's very kind of you.

01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:52.312
Because we are on tape I'll
repeat any questions that come

01:03:52.312 --> 01:03:53.849
in.
Yeah.

01:03:53.849 --> 01:04:06.804
Student: [inaudible]
Dean Peter Salovey:

01:04:06.804 --> 01:04:10.194
Right.
So the question is in

01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:14.293
experiments like the painful
shock experiment if you are told

01:04:14.293 --> 01:04:16.369
in advance,
like you all are,

01:04:16.369 --> 01:04:19.332
through a consent form or by
the experimenter,

01:04:19.332 --> 01:04:22.690
"This is an experiment
involving painful shock,"

01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:26.719
will you still rate the
experimenter as more attractive

01:04:26.719 --> 01:04:30.750
or will you not be able to
misattribute the arousal?

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.737
It is true.
The more salient we make the

01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:37.272
source of the arousal,
the less likely you can get the

01:04:37.272 --> 01:04:40.366
effect.
If in my thought experiment I

01:04:40.366 --> 01:04:43.796
say to my friend,
"Well, I know why you're

01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:47.309
feeling that way.
The reason why you're feeling

01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:51.050
that way is ‘cause the barista
made a mistake and gave you

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:54.665
caffeinated espresso when you
asked for decaf or maybe you

01:04:54.665 --> 01:04:56.840
just love me."
Right.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.440
The person is not likely to
say, "Oh, I bet it's love."

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.353
They're more likely to think
oh, caffeine,

01:05:01.353 --> 01:05:03.333
yeah.
That's the parsimonious

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.619
explanation here."
So it is true.

01:05:05.619 --> 01:05:08.331
The more salient you make the
cause of the arousal,

01:05:08.331 --> 01:05:11.586
the less likely you'll get the
effect but you can see even in

01:05:11.586 --> 01:05:15.219
experiments where the cause of
the arousal is somewhat obvious,

01:05:15.219 --> 01:05:18.473
at least to us,
you can still get a

01:05:18.473 --> 01:05:21.600
misattribution effect.
Other questions.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.386
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

01:05:26.386 --> 01:05:31.210
Dean Peter Salovey:
Yeah.

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:34.525
So the question is are any of
these factors,

01:05:34.525 --> 01:05:37.610
particularly the big three,
proximity,

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:40.336
familiarity,
and similarity--Do they affect

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:44.620
the maintenance of relationships
or just the initial attraction?

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.188
It's interesting.
My guess is they affect both

01:05:48.188 --> 01:05:52.555
initial and maintenance over
time but the literature mostly

01:05:52.555 --> 01:05:56.595
focuses on initial attraction,
much richer data on that

01:05:56.595 --> 01:05:59.770
initial attraction and those
initial stages of the

01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:03.399
relationship in part because
it's a little hard to follow

01:06:03.399 --> 01:06:06.801
couples over time.
Imagine the sort of

01:06:06.801 --> 01:06:12.534
Heisenberg-esque problems we
would get carefully following

01:06:12.534 --> 01:06:18.368
romantic couples over time and
interfering with them to ask

01:06:18.368 --> 01:06:23.882
questions and make observations.
It would be hard to let this

01:06:23.882 --> 01:06:27.340
couple naturally--this
relationship naturally unfold.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.107
So, we really get--So,
really the focus of many of

01:06:30.107 --> 01:06:32.650
these experiments is on initial
attraction.

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:36.006
That's why I always say my
lecture is on love,

01:06:36.006 --> 01:06:38.989
the definition of terms is
about love,

01:06:38.989 --> 01:06:43.029
but the experiments really are
much more about attraction than

01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:45.630
about love.
Another question.

01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:47.368
Yes.
Student: Can someone

01:06:47.368 --> 01:06:48.950
feel consummate love for more
than one person?

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:51.314
Dean Peter Salovey: Oh.
Can someone feel consummate

01:06:51.314 --> 01:06:55.670
love for more than one person?
That's a very good question.

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:58.409
It's actually a question that's
debated in the literature.

01:06:58.409 --> 01:07:01.987
I didn't get into it at all in
this experiment--in this

01:07:01.987 --> 01:07:05.300
lecture--but there's an
interesting debate going on

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:09.077
about love and many other
emotions between people who take

01:07:09.077 --> 01:07:12.324
a kind of evolutionary
perspective on these states

01:07:12.324 --> 01:07:16.167
versus people who take what
might be called a more socially

01:07:16.167 --> 01:07:20.636
constructed perspective.
And these aren't necessarily so

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:24.355
incompatible but the
evolutionary perspective I think

01:07:24.355 --> 01:07:28.645
would argue that you can feel
that kind of love for more than

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:32.864
one person or at least it would
facilitate the passing on of

01:07:32.864 --> 01:07:36.439
your genetic material to a
larger array of the next

01:07:36.439 --> 01:07:40.292
generation.
So I think the evolutionary

01:07:40.292 --> 01:07:45.587
explanation is not a problem but
we have constructed a world

01:07:45.587 --> 01:07:50.510
where in most societies,
except for very unusual

01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:55.838
polygamist societies,
the belief is that you can't

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:59.269
love more than one.
Right.

01:07:59.269 --> 01:08:03.371
And so you've got this tension
between what might be

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:07.472
evolutionarily wired impulses
and the kind of social

01:08:07.472 --> 01:08:10.769
constraints that say this isn't
good,

01:08:10.769 --> 01:08:12.900
this isn't appropriate,
this is taboo.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.132
And my guess is the result is
yes, you could but you're not

01:08:17.132 --> 01:08:21.365
going to feel un-conflicted
about it and it's because these

01:08:21.365 --> 01:08:25.159
two are conflicting each other
at the same time.

01:08:25.159 --> 01:08:28.100
How about one more question and
then we'll let you go?

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.500
I'm sorry.
I saw him first.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.604
Student: Wouldn't
natural selection favor the

01:08:33.604 --> 01:08:37.074
people who learn all these
things and then practically try

01:08:37.074 --> 01:08:38.967
to apply them?
Dean Peter Salovey: So

01:08:38.967 --> 01:08:40.039
he's making the evolutionary
argument.

01:08:40.039 --> 01:08:43.848
Wouldn't natural selection
favor the people who take

01:08:43.848 --> 01:08:47.204
introductory psychology,
come to my Valentine's Day

01:08:47.204 --> 01:08:50.141
lecture, listen carefully to the
big three and the more

01:08:50.141 --> 01:08:52.875
interesting four,
and then go out there and put

01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:55.776
them into practice?
It feels a little bit like

01:08:55.776 --> 01:08:59.989
the--like we're trying to pass
on an acquired characteristic,

01:08:59.989 --> 01:09:04.901
which is a little bit counter
to Darwinian theory but if

01:09:04.901 --> 01:09:09.724
somehow you could design a
proclivity for learning this

01:09:09.724 --> 01:09:14.490
kind of material,
evolution might indeed favor it.

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:17.963
I can tell you this much.
It would make the several

01:09:17.963 --> 01:09:22.355
thousands social psychologists
in this world very happy and

01:09:22.355 --> 01:09:26.520
proud of their field,
if that turned out to be true.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.340
Anyway, thank you all very much.
Happy Valentine's Day!

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.340
Thanks!

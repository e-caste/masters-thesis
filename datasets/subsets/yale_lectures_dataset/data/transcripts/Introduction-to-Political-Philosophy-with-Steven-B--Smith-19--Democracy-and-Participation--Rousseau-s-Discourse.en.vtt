00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.740
Professor Steven Smith:
Good morning.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.500
My name is Borat.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.000
Anyone see the movie yet?
Yeah, I saw it over the weekend.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.608
Had to cheer myself up a little
bit after Saturday afternoon but

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:26.280
there's still another week to
go.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:34.110
Still time.
Good morning.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.686
I want to talk today about my
favorite part of the Second

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:43.655
Discourse,
a book that never grows old,

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:49.628
that never fails to produce.
Last time, in talking about

00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:54.980
Rousseau's account of the
origins of inequality,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.076
I focused on a famous passage
in which Rousseau claims it was

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:04.663
the establishment of private
property that was the true

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:09.929
formation of civil society and
the beginnings of inequality and

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:15.111
all of the subsequent miseries
of the human race that he wants

00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:17.769
to describe.
But in fact,

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:23.114
that's not really true.
Rousseau himself knows it's not

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:26.570
quite true.
If Rousseau were only

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.150
interested in issues of class
and economic inequality,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.812
there would be very little
difference between him and

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:42.550
materialist theorists of society
like Karl Marx although Marx was

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.750
in fact a very appreciative
reader of Rousseau and got most

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.129
of his best lines against
capitalist society from him.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.576
Nevertheless,
Rousseau understands that even

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:03.988
for institutions like property
and civil society to be possible

00:02:03.988 --> 00:02:10.504
there must be huge and important
developments that go on or take

00:02:10.504 --> 00:02:16.063
place even prior to this,
moral and psychological

00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:22.110
transformations of human beings.
And it is for Rousseau far more

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.107
what we might call "the moral
and psychological injuries of

00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:32.190
inequality" than the material
aspects of the phenomenon that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.927
is of concern to him.
Rousseau very much takes the

00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:41.299
side of the poor and the
dispossessed but it isn't

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.066
property,
or it isn't poverty rather,

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:51.157
that really rouses Rousseau's
anger as it is the attitudes and

00:02:51.157 --> 00:02:56.949
beliefs shaped by inequalities
and of wealth and power.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:02.469
It is Rousseau the moral
psychologist where his voice

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.846
truly comes out.
In many ways,

00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:11.940
Rousseau like Plato finds his
voice when discussing the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.680
various complexities of the
human soul.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.089
So what is the chief villain in
Rousseau's Second

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:26.623
Discourse and his account of
the beginnings in development of

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:30.253
inequality?
Real inequality begins in a

00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:35.698
faculty or a disposition that is
in fact in most editions of the

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:40.797
book rendered simply by the
French term because it is really

00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:45.815
untranslatable into English.
It is amour-propre,

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:50.479
the first term I put on the
board, which is the first and

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.560
most durable cause of inequality
for Rousseau.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.652
Amour-propre,
again, is an untranslatable

00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:03.789
word but in many ways is related
to a range of psychological

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:11.129
characteristics such as pride,
vanity, conceit.

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.679
In the translation that you
have, I believe,

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:20.439
the translator refers to it as
egocentrism,

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:26.641
a kind of ugly modern
psychologistic term I think but

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:32.870
better and more accurately,
evocatively translated by terms

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.910
like vanity and conceit or
pride.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.524
Amour-propre for
Rousseau only arises in society

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:43.429
and is the true cause,
he believes,

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:47.849
for our discontents.
And in a lengthy footnote that

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.429
I hope you checked--in a lengthy
footnote, he distinguishes

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.930
amour-propre from another
disposition that he calls

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.270
amour de soi-meme,
a sort of self-love.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.457
How are these distinguished?
He says in that note:

00:05:04.457 --> 00:05:08.957
"We must not confuse
amour-propre with love of

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:12.375
oneself.
These are two passions very

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:17.490
different by virtue of their
nature and their effects."

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.891
Love of oneself,
amour de soi-meme, "Love

00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:23.569
of oneself is a natural
sentiment,"

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.081
he writes, "which moves every
animal to be vigilant in its own

00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:32.593
preservation and which directed
in many by reason and modified

00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:35.699
by pity produces humanity and
virtue."

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.433
So there is a kind of
self-love, he says,

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:42.259
that is at the root of our
desire to preserve ourself,

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.099
to be strong in our
self-preservation,

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.319
and to resist the invasion or
encroachment by others.

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.036
But then, he goes on to say
amour-propre is an

00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:56.610
entirely different kind of
passion or sentiment.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.640
"Amour-propre is merely
a sentiment that is relative,"

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.402
he says, "artificial and born in
society which moves each

00:06:04.402 --> 00:06:08.029
individual to value himself more
than anyone else,

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:12.586
which inspired in men all the
evils they cause one another and

00:06:12.586 --> 00:06:15.350
which is the true source of
honor."

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.929
Listen to that last expression.
"Amour-propre," he says,

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:26.172
"is what moves every individual
to value" him--or herself--"more

00:06:26.172 --> 00:06:30.559
than any other,
which inspires all of the evils

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:35.779
in society and," he says,
"is the true source of honor,

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:41.215
both evil and honor,
the desire to be recognized and

00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:45.458
esteemed by others."
How can this passion of

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:49.750
amour-propre be
responsible for these two very

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.970
different sort of competing
effects?

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.470
How did this sentiment arise
first of all?

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.644
How did it come about and I
suppose fundamentally and more

00:06:59.644 --> 00:07:03.380
importantly, what can or should
be done about it?

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.765
For Hobbes, recall,
and this idea of pride,

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:14.540
vanity, what Hobbes called
vainglory,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.695
you remember,
a very important part of

00:07:16.695 --> 00:07:20.250
Hobbes' political and moral
psychology in Leviathan,

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.503
pride is seen as something
natural to us,

00:07:23.503 --> 00:07:25.699
Hobbes writes,
you remember,

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.440
it is part of our
natural--pride is part of our

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.100
natural desire to dominate over
others,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.644
but for Rousseau by contrast
amour-propre is something

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:41.810
that could only come about after
the state of nature,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.897
a state that Hobbes,
you remember,

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:45.921
had called solitary,
poor, nasty,

00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:49.029
brutish,
and short, after the state of

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:53.000
nature had already begun to give
way to society.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.910
Hobbes' account for Rousseau is
incoherent.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.818
If the natural state is truly
solitary, poor,

00:08:01.818 --> 00:08:05.727
nasty, brutish,
and short, what would it mean

00:08:05.727 --> 00:08:10.880
in such a state to feel pride or
vanity that requires human

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.210
sociability and requires the
esteem of others and somehow the

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.636
gaze or the look of others?
How could pride have arisen in

00:08:21.636 --> 00:08:26.269
a state of nature which on
Hobbes' own account is solitary?

00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:29.784
Rousseau uses Hobbes in a way
to prove his own point,

00:08:29.784 --> 00:08:33.362
that amour-propre,
vanity, is not a natural

00:08:33.362 --> 00:08:36.430
sentiment but,
as he says in that passage I

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.679
just read,
a sentiment that is relative

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.458
and artificial,
could only have come into being

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:46.580
once we enter society in some
ways.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.895
But how did that happen?
Rousseau speculates about this

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:53.656
and, again, this is part of his
hypothetical or conjectural

00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:55.755
history.
He speculates that

00:08:55.755 --> 00:09:00.067
amour-propre began to
arise and develop as soon as

00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:04.918
people began to gather around a
hut or a tree and to look at one

00:09:04.918 --> 00:09:08.361
another,
as soon as we became conscious

00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:12.429
of the gaze of another,
and it is from that gaze,

00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:16.842
from the look or gaze of
another, that the passion of

00:09:16.842 --> 00:09:20.601
vanity was born.
Listen to the way in which he

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:24.142
speculates how this arose.
"Each one," he says,

00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:28.162
"began to look at the others
and to want to be looked at

00:09:28.162 --> 00:09:31.159
himself and public esteem had a
value.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:34.855
The one who sang or danced the
best, the handsomest,

00:09:34.855 --> 00:09:37.825
the strongest,
the most adroit or the most

00:09:37.825 --> 00:09:42.317
eloquent became the most highly
regarded and this was the first

00:09:42.317 --> 00:09:46.809
step toward inequality and at
the same time toward vice.

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:51.248
From these first preferences
were born vanity and contempt on

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:55.020
the one hand and shame and envy
on the other and the

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.311
fermentation caused by this new
leavens eventually produced

00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:03.009
compounds fatal to happiness and
innocence."

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:08.885
So the rise of this passion to
be seen, to be seen to be best

00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:12.705
at something,
produced in many--for many

00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:15.717
people again,
as he puts it,

00:10:15.717 --> 00:10:21.012
pride and vanity from some
shame and envy on the part of

00:10:21.012 --> 00:10:26.307
others and from this fatal
compound grew tendencies that

00:10:26.307 --> 00:10:29.041
were,
as he says, fatal to our

00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:31.772
happiness and innocence,
and Rousseau,

00:10:31.772 --> 00:10:35.019
I think is very much onto
something here.

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:38.680
Amour-propre is
presented in the passage I just

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.617
read and throughout much of the
Second Discourse in

00:10:42.617 --> 00:10:46.554
largely negative terms but it is
also related to something

00:10:46.554 --> 00:10:48.658
positive,
in many ways,

00:10:48.658 --> 00:10:53.671
for the development of humanity
in society, the desire felt by

00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:56.629
all people once we enter
society,

00:10:56.629 --> 00:11:01.990
to be accorded some kind of
recognition or respect by those

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.552
around us.
That too is a part of

00:11:04.552 --> 00:11:07.663
amour-propre,
the desire to be seen and

00:11:07.663 --> 00:11:11.979
recognized and respected.
The desire for recognition,

00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:17.355
he says, is at the root of our
sense of justice and underlying

00:11:17.355 --> 00:11:19.881
this,
I think, is the intuition

00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:23.159
powerful and in many ways I
think deeply true,

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:27.169
that our feelings,
beliefs, opinions and attitudes

00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:31.250
be acknowledged and respected by
others around us,

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.867
that we matter in some way.
When we feel that our opinions

00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:39.898
are slighted,
when others do not recognize

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:42.938
our worth,
we feel angry about this and

00:11:42.938 --> 00:11:47.020
this need for recognition,
which is part of this passion

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.028
of amour-propre,
is for Rousseau also a

00:11:51.028 --> 00:11:55.656
cornerstone of justice but it is
also, as he says,

00:11:55.656 --> 00:12:01.323
at the same time the demand for
recognition can easily become

00:12:01.323 --> 00:12:06.330
cruel and violent as we demand
this from others.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.279
Consider again just the
following.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:11.211
I want to read one other
passage from the same part of

00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:13.995
the text.
He writes: "As soon as men had

00:12:13.995 --> 00:12:18.127
begun mutually to value one
another and the idea of esteem

00:12:18.127 --> 00:12:21.904
was formed in their minds,
each one claimed to have a

00:12:21.904 --> 00:12:25.574
right to it, each one claimed to
have a right to esteem or

00:12:25.574 --> 00:12:28.435
recognition,
and it no longer possible," he

00:12:28.435 --> 00:12:31.720
writes, "for anyone to be
lacking it with impunity.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.719
From this came the first duties
of civility even among savages

00:12:36.719 --> 00:12:41.309
and from this every voluntary
wrong became an outrage.

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:45.095
Every time someone was harmed
or injured, it became an outrage

00:12:45.095 --> 00:12:48.879
because along with the harm that
resulted from the injury,"

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:52.997
he says, "the offended party
saw in it contempt for his

00:12:52.997 --> 00:12:57.115
person, which often was more
insufferable than the harm

00:12:57.115 --> 00:13:00.000
itself."
Think about the psychology,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.160
the moral psychology that
Rousseau is invoking here in his

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.381
talk about harm and injury.
It's not the physical aspect of

00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:12.613
the harm that bothers him.
It is the sort of contempt that

00:13:12.613 --> 00:13:16.190
is implied or entailed in the
act of injury.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.962
Hence, he goes on to say,
"each man punished the contempt

00:13:19.962 --> 00:13:23.398
shown him in a matter
proportionate to the esteem in

00:13:23.398 --> 00:13:28.158
which he held himself.
Acts of revenge became terrible

00:13:28.158 --> 00:13:32.039
and men became bloodthirsty and
cruel."

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:34.858
That is to say,
amour-propre and society

00:13:34.858 --> 00:13:38.610
gave rise to the state of war.
Does this sound familiar?

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.058
I think it should.
I was trying to think of some

00:13:43.058 --> 00:13:47.814
example that might fit this and
one I came up with when I was

00:13:47.814 --> 00:13:51.699
thinking about this
earlier--consider a story that

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:56.165
was much in the news.
I forget if it was last spring

00:13:56.165 --> 00:14:00.620
or last summer sometime.
The Danish cartoon controversy.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.177
Do you remember that,
about the cartoons of the

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:07.967
prophet Muhammad and the outrage
and the protests,

00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:11.370
often violent,
that occurred about that?

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.039
To some degree,
Rousseau might argue,

00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:20.340
the protests were about
disrespectful cartoons of the

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.478
prophet but he would argue,
I suspect, that the deeper

00:14:25.478 --> 00:14:29.282
cause seemed to be that the
protesters believed was

00:14:29.282 --> 00:14:33.426
disrespect being shown to them,
to their beliefs,

00:14:33.426 --> 00:14:37.639
to what it is they held sacred
in some sense.

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:42.682
It is their beliefs that were
being disrespected and were the

00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:46.216
cause of the protests.
Amour-propre,

00:14:46.216 --> 00:14:50.083
as Rousseau I think himself
recognizes, is this very

00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:53.644
volatile passion.
It contains the desire to be

00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:58.172
respected again and acknowledged
that is at the root of justice

00:14:58.172 --> 00:15:01.970
and virtue and yet at the same
time this passion,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:07.566
as we know, is easily
manipulable by those who wish to

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:14.008
convince others that their basic
entitlements or views are not

00:15:14.008 --> 00:15:17.331
being respected.
To some degree,

00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:21.852
I think, Rousseau would believe
the protesters over those

00:15:21.852 --> 00:15:26.068
cartoons had a point.
Their views were not being

00:15:26.068 --> 00:15:31.150
respected and to which you might
say a Lockean or a liberal

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.620
formulation of the problem or
response would be,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.296
"Well, so what?"
The task of government,

00:15:40.296 --> 00:15:43.380
according to Locke or the
liberal view,

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.600
is to ensure the security of
person and property,

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.980
to protect you from harm and of
course to provide you the

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.500
freedom to practice what
religion you like,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.429
consistent with the freedom of
others to do so too.

00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:03.849
It is not the business of
government to ensure that your

00:16:03.849 --> 00:16:08.211
beliefs are being respected.
This was clearly the view,

00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:11.439
for example,
of the Danish newspaper editors

00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:15.417
that published the cartoon as
well as the Danish prime

00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:19.545
minister who refused to
apologize for this on the ground

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:24.199
again that the government's job
is not to impose a gag order on

00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:28.552
what can and cannot be said on
the grounds that some people

00:16:28.552 --> 00:16:32.873
might find it offensive.
This is a respectable,

00:16:32.873 --> 00:16:37.644
sort of liberal line of thought
going from Locke to John Stuart

00:16:37.644 --> 00:16:41.128
Mill,
and yet, while I am inclined to

00:16:41.128 --> 00:16:46.495
agree very much with that point
of view, there is something

00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:52.140
powerful and true about what
Rousseau has to say about it,

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.973
about this kind of issue.
Lockean liberal thought was

00:16:56.973 --> 00:17:01.674
addressed in many ways to people
who had experienced the crucible

00:17:01.674 --> 00:17:05.251
of civil war,
a century of religious conflict

00:17:05.251 --> 00:17:09.513
and were looking for a way to
settle their religious and

00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:13.535
political differences.
Toleration in many ways is a

00:17:13.535 --> 00:17:17.334
liberal virtue because it
requires us to distinguish

00:17:17.334 --> 00:17:21.953
between beliefs that we may take
with the utmost seriousness in

00:17:21.953 --> 00:17:25.528
private life and yet
nevertheless bracket them in

00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:29.029
some way once we enter the
public world.

00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:33.369
This, in many ways,
is the peculiar liberal virtue

00:17:33.369 --> 00:17:36.470
of self-restraint or
self-denial,

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.062
that we refuse to allow our own
moral point of view to,

00:17:41.062 --> 00:17:44.890
in many ways,
dominate in the public space.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.956
But it is one thing,
you might say,

00:17:47.956 --> 00:17:52.915
to tolerate other views and
another thing to accord them

00:17:52.915 --> 00:17:57.400
respect and esteem.
That seems to be something very

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.509
different from what Locke talked
about.

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:06.285
To tolerate simply means not to
persecute, to leave alone,

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:12.059
while respect for something
requires that we esteem it.

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:16.420
You might ask yourself,
"Must we esteem and respect

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.779
values and points of view that
we do not share?"

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:24.689
This seems very different,
again, from the sort of liberal

00:18:24.689 --> 00:18:29.009
understanding of toleration that
means only extending acceptance

00:18:29.009 --> 00:18:32.849
to views again that are very
different from our own.

00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:36.662
It doesn't require us to,
as it were, censor,

00:18:36.662 --> 00:18:40.041
self-censor,
our own views on the ground

00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:45.500
that they may be--our views may
be in some ways disrespectful or

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.930
hurtful to others.
This is a vast topic.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.166
I've sort of used the
opportunity to sort of move away

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:55.524
from Rousseau a little bit but
his point is I think that

00:18:55.524 --> 00:18:59.419
amour-propre,
the desire to be esteemed,

00:18:59.419 --> 00:19:04.373
recognized, and to have your
values and points of view

00:19:04.373 --> 00:19:09.233
esteemed by those around you is
in fact a violent and

00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:13.602
uncontrollable passion.
It is the passion very much

00:19:13.602 --> 00:19:16.198
like Plato's thumos,
spiritedness,

00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:20.858
back in the Republic.
It is a passion that makes us

00:19:20.858 --> 00:19:26.339
burn with anger over perceived
slights and makes us also risk

00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:31.820
our lives and endanger the lives
of others to rectify what we

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:36.915
believe to be acts of injustice.
Like Plato, in many ways,

00:19:36.915 --> 00:19:41.102
Rousseau wants to know whether
amour-propre is purely a

00:19:41.102 --> 00:19:44.259
negative passion or disposition
or whether,

00:19:44.259 --> 00:19:47.718
like thumos,
whether it can be redirected,

00:19:47.718 --> 00:19:50.528
in some way,
to achieve social goods and

00:19:50.528 --> 00:19:55.033
social benefits.
All of this is entailed in that

00:19:55.033 --> 00:19:59.481
short discussion of
amour-propre in the

00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:04.180
Second Discourse.
So much of Rousseau's

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.305
subsequent account of
civilization and its discontents

00:20:09.305 --> 00:20:14.623
grows out of this peculiar
psychological disposition and

00:20:14.623 --> 00:20:17.884
passion.
So let's talk a little bit more

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.470
about civilization and its
discontents.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.576
In Woody Allen's movie,
Annie Hall,

00:20:31.576 --> 00:20:35.023
you might recall a scene in
which he says there are two

00:20:35.023 --> 00:20:38.877
kinds of people.
They're the horrible and the

00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:41.980
miserable.
The horrible are those who have

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:46.160
suffered some kind of personal
tragedy, a disfigurement of some

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.060
kind, who are facing a terminal
illness.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.930
The miserable is everybody else.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.430
Rousseau wants us to be
miserable.

00:20:59.579 --> 00:21:03.933
He wants us to feel just how
bad things are,

00:21:03.933 --> 00:21:07.680
how bad we are,
how bad off we are.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.317
The only exception to this
general human misery is,

00:21:12.317 --> 00:21:17.047
as he tells us at one point,
kind of early primitive

00:21:17.047 --> 00:21:20.011
society.
These societies described by

00:21:20.011 --> 00:21:22.988
him, not quite the state of
nature to be sure,

00:21:22.988 --> 00:21:26.956
maintained a kind of middling
position between the pure state

00:21:26.956 --> 00:21:30.660
of nature and the development of
modern conditions.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.151
He says these were the happiest
and most durable societies and

00:21:35.151 --> 00:21:38.030
the best for man.
It was primitive man,

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.991
not the pure savage of the
state of nature,

00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:45.080
where Rousseau finds a happy
equilibrium between our powers

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.309
and our needs that he says is
the recipe for happiness,

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:53.484
bringing our powers and our
needs into equilibrium,

00:21:53.484 --> 00:21:58.410
but the end of that happy state
came with two inventions,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:05.930
two discoveries:
agriculture and metallurgy.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.739
With agriculture came,
here we see the division of

00:22:09.739 --> 00:22:14.559
land, the division of property,
and the subsequent inequalities

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:19.281
that came with it.
With metallurgy came the art of

00:22:19.281 --> 00:22:23.031
war and conquest.
With these two developments,

00:22:23.031 --> 00:22:25.963
he tells us,
humanity entered a new stage,

00:22:25.963 --> 00:22:30.253
one where laws and political
institutions became necessary to

00:22:30.253 --> 00:22:32.970
adjudicate conflicts over
rights,

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.654
and the establishment of
governments that this entailed

00:22:37.654 --> 00:22:41.816
rather than bringing peace,
as it would for Hobbes or

00:22:41.816 --> 00:22:45.307
Locke, the establishment of
governments had the effect

00:22:45.307 --> 00:22:48.930
simply of sanctioning the
existing inequalities that had

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.468
begun to develop.
For Rousseau,

00:22:51.468 --> 00:22:55.990
there is something deeply
shocking and deeply troubling

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:01.265
about the assertion that men who
were once free and equal are so

00:23:01.265 --> 00:23:04.740
easily,
as it were, led to consent to

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.680
the inequalities of property and
to rule by the stronger,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.430
which government brings into
being.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.145
The social contract,
as he presents it in the

00:23:14.145 --> 00:23:17.539
Second Discourse,
is really a kind of swindle.

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:21.735
The establishment of government
is a kind of swindle that the

00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:25.371
rich and the powerful use to
control the poor and the

00:23:25.371 --> 00:23:28.835
dispossessed.
Again, rather than instituting

00:23:28.835 --> 00:23:33.309
justice, this compact merely
legitimizes past usurpations.

00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:39.519
Government is a con game that
the rich play upon the poor.

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:43.804
Political power simply helps to
legitimize economic

00:23:43.804 --> 00:23:45.950
inequalities.
Governments,

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.960
he tells us,
may operate by consent but the

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.259
consent they are granted is
based on falsehoods and lies.

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:57.765
How else can one explain why
the rich live lives that are so

00:23:57.765 --> 00:24:02.195
much freer, so much easier,
so much more open to enjoyment,

00:24:02.195 --> 00:24:06.009
than the poor?
That is Rousseau's real

00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:11.480
critique and real question.
And it is the establishment of

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.313
government that is the last link
in the chain of Rousseau's

00:24:16.313 --> 00:24:21.044
conjectural history,
the last and most painful,

00:24:21.044 --> 00:24:24.509
in many ways,
legitimation of the

00:24:24.509 --> 00:24:30.896
inequalities that have been
created after our emergence from

00:24:30.896 --> 00:24:35.039
the natural condition.
But what, again,

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:39.612
is most painful to Rousseau is
the emergence of a new kind of

00:24:39.612 --> 00:24:44.109
human being that this stage of
civilization has been brought

00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:48.149
into--that this state of
civilization has brought into

00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:51.364
being.
And Rousseau is the first,

00:24:51.364 --> 00:24:56.240
I think, to use that term so
powerfully, which became used

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.576
very much in the next two
centuries, the

00:24:59.576 --> 00:25:03.693
bourgeoisie.
The bourgeoisie is

00:25:03.693 --> 00:25:08.562
Rousseau's invention and most
striking about this human type

00:25:08.562 --> 00:25:13.101
for him is the necessity to
appear to be one thing where

00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:18.019
actually being something else.
Go back again to think of the

00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:22.150
way in which Plato or Socrates
uses that distinction between

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.559
seeming and being when he talks
about the just man in Book II of

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:30.121
the Republic,
someone who seems to be and

00:25:30.121 --> 00:25:33.578
someone who is just.
It is this tension between the

00:25:33.578 --> 00:25:37.265
two that is so central to
Rousseau's account of what he

00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:41.518
calls the bourgeoisie.
"Being something and appearing

00:25:41.518 --> 00:25:45.241
to be something," he says,
"become two different things

00:25:45.241 --> 00:25:49.309
and from this distinction there
arose grand ostentation,

00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:52.857
deceptive cunning,
and all the vices that follow

00:25:52.857 --> 00:25:55.498
in their wake."
And in the penultimate

00:25:55.498 --> 00:25:59.080
paragraph of the Second
Discourse Rousseau describes

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.736
the dilemma of the
bourgeoisie in the

00:26:01.736 --> 00:26:04.990
following way.
He says, "The savage lives

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.593
within himself.
The man accustomed to the ways

00:26:08.593 --> 00:26:12.929
of society, the bourgeoisie,
is always outside of himself

00:26:12.929 --> 00:26:17.420
and knows only how to live in
the opinions of others and it

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.970
is,
as it were, from their judgment

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.520
alone that he draws the
sentiment of his own existence."

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.566
Think of that sentence.
It comes from the next to the

00:26:26.566 --> 00:26:30.276
last paragraph of the book,
that in society we only live

00:26:30.276 --> 00:26:34.252
through the opinions of others,
through the gaze of others,

00:26:34.252 --> 00:26:36.309
through what others think of
us.

00:26:36.309 --> 00:26:39.578
We are constantly our own
sentiment of existence,

00:26:39.578 --> 00:26:42.972
he says.
Our own sentiment of self and

00:26:42.972 --> 00:26:48.211
existent comes entirely from the
judgment, as he puts it,

00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:51.587
of those around us.
The bourgeoisie,

00:26:51.587 --> 00:26:53.994
in other words,
is someone who lives in and

00:26:53.994 --> 00:26:56.900
through the opinions,
the good opinions,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.832
of others, who thinks only of
himself when he is with other

00:27:01.832 --> 00:27:06.680
people and only of other people
when he is by himself.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.467
Such a person is duplicitous,
hypocritical,

00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:14.115
and false.
This is why this is the true,

00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:17.920
you might say,
discontent of civilization.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.761
This is what our perpetual
restlessness and reflectiveness

00:27:22.761 --> 00:27:26.321
have made of us.
Goaded on perpetually by

00:27:26.321 --> 00:27:30.468
amour-propre,
this is the particular misery

00:27:30.468 --> 00:27:33.769
that civilization has bequeathed
us.

00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:38.178
So the question at the end of
the book is what to do about

00:27:38.178 --> 00:27:40.266
this and here,
in many ways,

00:27:40.266 --> 00:27:44.829
one has to say the Second
Discourse falls short.

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:53.559
The book ends on a note of
utmost despair.

00:27:53.559 --> 00:28:00.456
It offers no positive answer to
cure the problem of civilization

00:28:00.456 --> 00:28:06.039
but only hints at best at two
possible solutions.

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:09.138
One is suggested,
you will recall,

00:28:09.138 --> 00:28:12.987
by the letter to the City of
Geneva which,

00:28:12.987 --> 00:28:17.728
in a sense, prefaces the book.
Perhaps the closest

00:28:17.728 --> 00:28:22.781
approximation to the early state
of primitive society lauded by

00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:27.164
Rousseau are the small,
isolated rural republics like

00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:31.694
Geneva in its own way where a
kind of simple patriotism and

00:28:31.694 --> 00:28:36.224
love of country have not been
completely overwhelmed by the

00:28:36.224 --> 00:28:39.269
agitations of
amour-propre.

00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:42.747
Only, he says,
in a well-tempered democracy

00:28:42.747 --> 00:28:47.798
like Geneva is it possible for
citizens still to enjoy some of

00:28:47.798 --> 00:28:52.102
the equality of the natural man.
Democracy for him,

00:28:52.102 --> 00:28:56.143
this kind of simple rural
democracy like that of Geneva,

00:28:56.143 --> 00:29:00.330
is the social condition that
most closely approximates the

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:04.738
equality of the state of nature
and that of course is a theme

00:29:04.738 --> 00:29:08.559
that Rousseau will take up
powerfully in his book the

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:13.759
Social Contract.
But Rousseau offers another

00:29:13.759 --> 00:29:19.142
hint to the solution of the
problem of civilization,

00:29:19.142 --> 00:29:26.260
what to do about it.
How can we restore happiness in

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:31.960
the midst of society?
The Second Discourse

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.052
leaves us to believe that all
society is a state of bondage

00:29:37.052 --> 00:29:41.529
and alienation from nature,
from our true being.

00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:46.196
We have lost our true humanity
that he describes in the state

00:29:46.196 --> 00:29:50.162
of nature, our state of--our
capacities for pity and

00:29:50.162 --> 00:29:54.380
compassion and the like,
and the answer to the problem

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.281
of society is,
in many ways,

00:29:56.281 --> 00:30:00.222
to return to the root of
society and this root of society

00:30:00.222 --> 00:30:04.093
is not just the need for
self-preservation but a kind of

00:30:04.093 --> 00:30:07.327
primordial,
as he calls it in that passage

00:30:07.327 --> 00:30:10.279
I read a minute ago,
sentiment of existence,

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:12.589
the sentiment of our own
existence.

00:30:12.589 --> 00:30:17.206
By giving oneself over to this
feeling of existence without a

00:30:17.206 --> 00:30:20.882
thought for the future,
without care or fear,

00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:25.221
the individual somehow
psychologically returns to the

00:30:25.221 --> 00:30:29.034
natural state.
Only a very few people,

00:30:29.034 --> 00:30:33.094
Rousseau writes,
he being one of them of

00:30:33.094 --> 00:30:39.548
course--only a very few people
are capable of finding their way

00:30:39.548 --> 00:30:43.700
back to nature.
The type of human being who can

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.775
find their way back to the sort
of pure sentiment of existence

00:30:47.775 --> 00:30:50.180
is not going to be a
philosopher,

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:55.480
is not going to be a person of
high order reflection like

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.779
Socrates, but will more likely
be an artist or a poet.

00:31:00.779 --> 00:31:05.235
He is one of those rare
aristocrats of nature,

00:31:05.235 --> 00:31:09.956
you might say.
His claim to superiority is not

00:31:09.956 --> 00:31:15.825
based on a higher understanding
but a superior sensitivity,

00:31:15.825 --> 00:31:19.569
less on wisdom than on
compassion.

00:31:19.569 --> 00:31:23.120
Rousseau believed himself to be
one of these people.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.869
Maybe you also are one of them.
Yes?

00:31:28.869 --> 00:31:31.624
But it requires you,
in some way,

00:31:31.624 --> 00:31:36.789
to distance yourself severely
and psychologically from all of

00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:40.562
the possibilities of society,
to return inward,

00:31:40.562 --> 00:31:43.854
and it was that inward journey
that Rousseau took and that he

00:31:43.854 --> 00:31:47.092
writes about so powerfully in
his Confessions and his

00:31:47.092 --> 00:31:49.446
final book,
The Reveries,

00:31:49.446 --> 00:31:53.213
where you find the Rousseau,
founder of the romantic

00:31:53.213 --> 00:31:57.348
disposition that you get again
in writers in America like

00:31:57.348 --> 00:32:01.558
Thoreau and others who look
inward and return to nature in

00:32:01.558 --> 00:32:04.946
some way,
their natural self as opposed

00:32:04.946 --> 00:32:08.034
to society.
But the Second Discourse

00:32:08.034 --> 00:32:10.769
leaves us, to be sure,
with a paradox.

00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:15.388
The progress of civilization is
responsible for all of our

00:32:15.388 --> 00:32:18.550
miseries.
Yes, it is society's fault.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.298
It's not your fault.
It's society's,

00:32:21.298 --> 00:32:26.459
he wants to tell us,
and yet he also leaves us with

00:32:26.459 --> 00:32:31.680
no real apparent way out.
He denies that we can,

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.131
as a practical solution,
return to simpler,

00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:42.594
more natural forms of political
association but how then do we

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:47.680
resolve the problem that he
leaves us with?

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.581
And his answer to it,
his political answer to it,

00:32:50.581 --> 00:32:54.026
his most famous political
answer to it is contained in his

00:32:54.026 --> 00:32:57.025
book,
yes, called the Social

00:32:57.025 --> 00:33:00.757
Contract,
Du Contrat Social,

00:33:00.757 --> 00:33:05.131
published in 1762,
seven years after the Second

00:33:05.131 --> 00:33:08.348
Discourse.
Here he attempts to give one

00:33:08.348 --> 00:33:12.921
such answer, and I mentioned one
such answer because it is not

00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:18.158
his only or final answer,
but one such answer to the

00:33:18.158 --> 00:33:24.073
problems of inequality and,
again, the injuries of

00:33:24.073 --> 00:33:28.632
amour-propre.
The Social Contract

00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:32.540
begins with one of the most
famous sentences in all of the

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.768
history of political philosophy,
"man is born free and is

00:33:37.768 --> 00:33:42.432
everywhere in chains."
Always begin your essays with a

00:33:42.432 --> 00:33:46.789
good, strong sentence like that.
Rousseau knew this.

00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:49.490
He knew something about how to
write.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.033
The phrase seems to be
perfectly in keeping with the

00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:56.015
Second Discourse.
In the state of nature,

00:33:56.015 --> 00:33:58.109
we are born free,
equal and independent.

00:33:58.109 --> 00:34:02.263
Only in society do we become
weak, dependent,

00:34:02.263 --> 00:34:06.127
and enslaved.
It is what follows after that

00:34:06.127 --> 00:34:09.420
sentence in a way that is the
shocker.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.030
How did this take--how did this
change take place,

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.020
Rousseau asks.
I do not know.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.817
What can render it legitimate?
I believe I can answer this

00:34:20.817 --> 00:34:23.505
question.
What can render it legitimate

00:34:23.505 --> 00:34:26.953
and by the "it" I take it he
means the chains as in--that

00:34:26.953 --> 00:34:30.340
states man is born free and is
everywhere in chains.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.119
In the Second Discourse,
he had attempted to completely

00:34:34.119 --> 00:34:36.349
delegitimize the bonds of
society,

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:39.406
saying how the Social
Contract and the creation of

00:34:39.406 --> 00:34:42.088
government was nothing but,
in many ways,

00:34:42.088 --> 00:34:45.680
a sophisticated swindle.
Now in the Social

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.196
Contract,
he asks the question,

00:34:48.196 --> 00:34:52.489
"What can give these chains or
bonds moral legitimacy?"

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:55.219
He says I believe I can answer
that.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:35:00.272
Has Rousseau simply undergone a
massive change of heart in the

00:35:00.272 --> 00:35:03.420
seven years between these two
books?

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.552
I don't think so but I think
these are--this is part of

00:35:08.552 --> 00:35:13.780
his--one of his answers to this
fundamental question.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.902
But before going into the
details of this,

00:35:16.902 --> 00:35:21.092
let's consider some of the
differences between these two

00:35:21.092 --> 00:35:23.659
very powerful books.
Right?

00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:27.150
The Second Discourse,
the discourse on inequality,

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.080
presents itself as a
hypothetical or conjectural

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.758
history of human development
from the state of nature to the

00:35:33.758 --> 00:35:36.635
civil condition.
It is written in a vivid

00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:40.274
language, which is why it is
always- it is often considered

00:35:40.274 --> 00:35:43.599
one of Rousseau's most powerful
pieces of writing,

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:47.719
a vivid language drawing on in
many ways the biological

00:35:47.719 --> 00:35:52.221
sciences of his day and newly
discovered knowledge of animal

00:35:52.221 --> 00:35:56.569
species like orangutans and
other kinds of anthropological

00:35:56.569 --> 00:36:01.300
investigations of the Caribs and
North American peoples,

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.277
a very vivid work.
The Social Contract,

00:36:05.277 --> 00:36:07.573
by contrast,
is written in a dry,

00:36:07.573 --> 00:36:11.090
even a kind of bloodless
language of a lawyer.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:15.949
It is very much written in the
genre of a legal document.

00:36:15.949 --> 00:36:19.542
Its subtitle is The
Principles of Political

00:36:19.542 --> 00:36:22.490
Right.
It is a work of considerable

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.117
philosophical abstraction whose
leading concepts are

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:29.530
abstractions like the social
contract,

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:33.460
the general will,
and so on.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.195
The book, he tells us in short
preface, was originally part of

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:40.195
a longer investigation of
politics which has since

00:36:40.195 --> 00:36:42.890
been--which he says has since
been lost.

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:54.022
Also, the Social
Contract presents itself in

00:36:54.022 --> 00:36:57.050
many ways as a utopia,
an ideal city,

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:01.052
in some respects an answer to
the Calipolis of Plato's

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:05.810
Republic and yet this is
also--this seems to be not quite

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.508
true.
The work begins,

00:37:07.508 --> 00:37:11.135
even before the famous sentence
about man being born free,

00:37:11.135 --> 00:37:14.762
the work is prefaced with a
statement that could have come

00:37:14.762 --> 00:37:17.880
directly out of Machiavelli's
Prince.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.114
"Taking men as they are and
laws as they might be," Rousseau

00:37:22.114 --> 00:37:26.062
says, "I will try in this
inquiry to bring together what

00:37:26.062 --> 00:37:29.579
right permits with what interest
prescribes."

00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:33.242
Taking men as they are… You
remember the fifteenth chapter

00:37:33.242 --> 00:37:36.635
of The Prince.
Let us look at the effectual

00:37:36.635 --> 00:37:39.864
truth of things,
not what is imagined to be but

00:37:39.864 --> 00:37:43.919
the way people actually are.
Let us take men as they are,

00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:46.469
Rousseau says,
following Machiavelli.

00:37:46.469 --> 00:37:48.773
He will not begin,
he tells us,

00:37:48.773 --> 00:37:52.920
by making any heroic
assumptions about human nature,

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.682
no metaphysical flights of
fancy, but rather stay on the

00:37:57.682 --> 00:38:01.320
low but solid ground of
recognized fact.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.924
What does he mean by this and
what are these facts of human

00:38:04.924 --> 00:38:08.727
nature, men as they are,
he says, that Rousseau claims

00:38:08.727 --> 00:38:11.970
to describe in the Social
Contract?

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:18.269
And here we get to the basic
premise of the book.

00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:22.081
The basic premise,
I think, from which the entire

00:38:22.081 --> 00:38:26.765
Social Contract unfolds
is the claim that man is born

00:38:26.765 --> 00:38:30.125
free.
All subsequent relations of

00:38:30.125 --> 00:38:35.612
hierarchy, obligation and
authority are the result not of

00:38:35.612 --> 00:38:39.630
nature but of agreement or
convention.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:44.708
Society and the moral ties that
constitute it are conventional,

00:38:44.708 --> 00:38:46.919
you might say,
by agreement,

00:38:46.919 --> 00:38:52.467
all the way down.
There is nothing natural about

00:38:52.467 --> 00:38:58.602
any of the social contract.
And from this basis of man as a

00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:03.478
free agent, that we are born
free, Rousseau attempts to work

00:39:03.478 --> 00:39:07.717
out a system of justice.
The Principles of Political

00:39:07.717 --> 00:39:11.062
Right, again is the
subtitle, suggests that are

00:39:11.062 --> 00:39:14.474
appropriate to human beings
conceived as free agents

00:39:14.474 --> 00:39:18.700
responsible to themselves alone.
But how do you do that?

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.322
How can you do that?
Rousseau's political philosophy

00:39:22.322 --> 00:39:27.452
begins, at least he believes I
think, with the realistic or

00:39:27.452 --> 00:39:32.406
even empirical assumption that
each individual has a deep

00:39:32.406 --> 00:39:38.510
rooted interest in securing the
conditions of their own liberty.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:43.193
The state of nature and the
social contract presuppose

00:39:43.193 --> 00:39:47.964
individuals who are in
competition with others and each

00:39:47.964 --> 00:39:51.421
attempting,
as it were, to secure the

00:39:51.421 --> 00:39:54.320
conditions for their own
liberty.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.477
He does not presuppose altruism
on the part of any human being

00:39:59.477 --> 00:40:04.550
or any other kind of self-other
regarding characteristics,

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:07.280
what I called a moment ago
heroic assumptions.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.436
He doesn't make the assumption
that we act for the interests of

00:40:11.436 --> 00:40:14.377
others.
We are selfishly concerned with

00:40:14.377 --> 00:40:18.448
our own freedom and the best
means of preserving it and

00:40:18.448 --> 00:40:21.822
protecting it.
Each of us has a desire to

00:40:21.822 --> 00:40:26.650
preserve his or her own freedom
and that social order will be

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.513
rational or just,
that allows us to preserve that

00:40:30.513 --> 00:40:32.498
freedom.
The problem,

00:40:32.498 --> 00:40:37.428
of course, is that in the state
of nature the desire to preserve

00:40:37.428 --> 00:40:41.810
my freedom comes into conflict
with the selfish desire of

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:45.409
everybody else to preserve their
freedom.

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:50.485
The state of nature quickly
becomes a state of war based on

00:40:50.485 --> 00:40:54.772
conflicting desires and
conflicting again means of

00:40:54.772 --> 00:40:58.912
liberty preservation.
So how do we preserve our

00:40:58.912 --> 00:41:03.363
liberty without lapsing into
anarchy, that is the state of

00:41:03.363 --> 00:41:05.713
war?
This is the question that the

00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:09.257
Social Contract sets out
to answer and to which his

00:41:09.257 --> 00:41:12.342
formulation,
his famous formulation of what

00:41:12.342 --> 00:41:15.500
he calls the general will,
is the solution.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.933
I'm going to end on that note
today and Wednesday I want to

00:41:19.933 --> 00:41:24.597
talk about the general will and
how Rousseau sees it as a sort

00:41:24.597 --> 00:41:28.648
of collective answer to the
problem of the securing of

00:41:28.648 --> 00:41:34.001
individual liberty.
So meditate on that if you like

00:41:34.001 --> 00:41:35.201
for the next day.

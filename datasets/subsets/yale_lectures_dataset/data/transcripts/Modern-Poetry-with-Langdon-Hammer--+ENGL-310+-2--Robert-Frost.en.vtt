00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.345
Professor Langdon
Hammer: I imagine that you

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:18.962
all have images of Robert Frost
and actual images in your mind

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:20.860
when you think of this poet.
 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.149
He's a familiar face in
American literature,

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.740
and I've gathered some of them
that seemed representative.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.115
This is Frost in old age,
as an American bard from a

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:38.498
magazine.
This is the Frost that you

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:41.821
probably know,
as if he were born with white

00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:44.825
hair, right?
And a kind of,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:52.074
well, kindly and monumental,
and yet approachable figure

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:58.270
that is familiar from American
school rooms.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.323
Here's another image of that
same guy, Robert Frost,

00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:09.530
painted by Gardner Cox,
reminding us of Frost as a kind

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.030
of link to nineteenth-century
life, to rural Vermont.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.455
Another image of Frost,
this one from The Times,

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:26.077
just a little story:
"President Hails Bond With

00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:30.197
Frost" – that president would
be John F.

00:01:30.197 --> 00:01:36.225
Kennedy – "On TV He Extols
Poet Who Calls New Frontier 'Age

00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:41.471
of Poetry and Power.'"
And perhaps you have seen

00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:46.469
images of Frost reading his
poem, "The Gift Outright," at

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.790
Kennedy's inauguration.
 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.365
It was a kind of powerful
moment in American culture where

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:57.780
the president allied himself
with poetry in this way.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.530
Oh, more pictures.
 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.303
This is Frost with
grandchildren,

00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:05.730
Frost with his pet calves.
 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:13.220
He was kind to animals,
and a farmer.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.372
This one I like.
This is Frost with a stick,

00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:20.129
or Frost with a branch.
 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.000
You can think about that when
you read "Birches."

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.381
This is Frost boyish,
even in age,

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:33.528
Frost who also likes to play
and even who looks just a little

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:37.319
bit, don't you think,
malevolent?

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.751
All of these images would seem
to make Frost not a modern poet

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:47.915
at all, not a modern poet in the
sense that Eliot and Pound

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:51.460
established;
that is, a difficult poet in

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.701
ways that I suggested last
Wednesday, a poet resistant to

00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:59.639
ordinary language and common
frames of reference,

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.218
formally innovative,
disorienting,

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:07.409
urbane, metropolitan.
 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.839
I think of nineteenth-century
art as being horizontal and

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:20.039
stretched out like agricultural
life in New England.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:25.209
And modernism is all about
verticality, from a certain

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.893
angle.
This was the Stieglitz picture,

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:33.949
City of Ambition,
I showed you last Wednesday.

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:38.739
Another pairing,
this wonderful landscape by

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.308
Martin Johnson Heade,
and we could contrast it with

00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:50.100
these images of Brooklyn Bridge
by Walker Evans,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.750
or even underneath the bridge.
 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.169
The bridge seems to – a
figure of crossing – it seems

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:04.129
here to rise up and out of the
city and the river.

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:12.635
This is Frost before he had
white hair, Frost at 18,

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:19.639
which is, I believe,
1892 or so: boyish.

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.019
And his first book is entitled
A Boy's Will;

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:28.470
A Boy's Will,
Robert Frost.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.894
This is a cover of the first
edition that you can go over to

00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:34.319
Beinecke and see.
 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.641
When you open it up and look at
the table of contents,

00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:45.164
you see titles of poems,
and underneath those titles are

00:04:45.164 --> 00:04:48.880
little legends and
moralizations.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.350
"Into My Own" (title).
 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.895
"Legend": "the youth is
persuaded that he will be rather

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:59.569
more than less himself for
having foresworn the world."

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.339
Or "Storm Fear":
"he is afraid of his own

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.147
isolation."
These are poems,

00:05:07.147 --> 00:05:10.761
in other words,
that come with little labels to

00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:14.690
tell you what they mean and what
they're about.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.269
 
 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:23.897
Modernism in Eliot and Pound
is, in some ways,

00:05:23.897 --> 00:05:29.759
founded on expatriation,
on a kind of internationalism.

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:36.357
Frost's poetry seems resolutely
American, or at any rate it

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:39.399
seems to be.
There is, in fact,

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:41.975
another Frost,
a modernist Frost,

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:44.230
a Frost that is,
in fact,

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:51.340
as international as Pound and
Eliot, who began his career,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.529
in fact, beside them,
as a London expatriate.

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.150
This is more of the table of
contents.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.699
You can see how it's laid out.
 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.540
This is the Frost who published
that book.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.918
This is Frost at thirty-nine,
Frost in a suit made by a

00:06:14.918 --> 00:06:17.990
London tailor in London.
 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.090
And when we go to the title
page of A Boy's Will we

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.279
see that this New England poet
publishes his first book,

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:34.700
in fact, in London in 1913,
there on New Oxford Street.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.594
Interesting.
North of Boston,

00:06:39.594 --> 00:06:44.943
a great book that follows A
Boy's Will,

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:51.719
is a title that locates these
poems in a specific place in

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.810
northern New England.
 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.705
It, too, is published in
London, this time on Bloomsbury

00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:03.949
Street.
You don't really think of Frost

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.230
as part of Bloomsbury,
do you?

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.276
But there he is,
publishing his book in that

00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:13.569
place, just like
Prufrock,

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:20.054
also published on Bloomsbury
Street – this in 1917,

00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:24.170
North of Boston in 1915.
 

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.257
You remember that table of
contents page I showed you a

00:07:28.257 --> 00:07:32.950
moment ago with the titles and
the moralizations that Frost has

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.069
for A Boy's Will?
 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:39.303
Well, here's the modernist
table of contents of

00:07:39.303 --> 00:07:42.065
Prufrock,
and of course,

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:46.206
what would the legend for "The
Love Song of J.

00:07:46.206 --> 00:07:48.600
Alfred Prufrock" be?
 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.116
"He wanders around in a
melancholy way,

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:53.170
quoting Hamlet for..."
 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.740
Well no, it--Eliot didn't do
that.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.697
When we look at the table of
contents of this book,

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:04.626
which is North of
Boston, well,

00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:07.160
it looks a lot like Eliot's.
 

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.404
Those little tags that seemed
to explain the poetry have

00:08:11.404 --> 00:08:15.804
disappeared and instead we
simply have the titles of these

00:08:15.804 --> 00:08:18.660
very great poems:
"Mending Wall,"

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.910
"The Death of the Hired Man,"
"The Mountain," "Home Burial."

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.589
There's something in
Eliot's--the presentation of

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:34.535
Eliot's work and indeed in the
work itself that is affronting,

00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:37.070
resistant, impersonal.
 

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.154
And the typography,
the presentation of the book is

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:45.542
part of that.
It's part of Eliot's whole

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.609
aesthetic.
But North of Boston,

00:08:48.609 --> 00:08:51.491
well, you know,
when we start looking at these

00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:54.996
two books together,
it seems to share some of the

00:08:54.996 --> 00:09:00.261
properties of Eliot's book;
and indeed the poems that we

00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:06.976
find when we open that book also
have things in common with

00:09:06.976 --> 00:09:09.388
Eliot's.
The other Frost,

00:09:09.388 --> 00:09:12.592
not the simple,
familiar, monumental Frost but

00:09:12.592 --> 00:09:16.435
the Frost who is a modernist
poet who begins writing in

00:09:16.435 --> 00:09:19.156
London,
is really quite as

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:23.511
cosmopolitan,
quite as learned as Pound and

00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:26.000
Eliot at this moment.
 

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.590
And yet he uses his learning
differently.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.619
He uses it very often by
concealing it,

00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:48.258
in fact.
Well, let me turn from pictures

00:09:48.258 --> 00:09:53.484
to text.
On your handout today,

00:09:53.484 --> 00:09:56.619
the handout number two,
we have--well,

00:09:56.619 --> 00:10:01.110
there are several quotations
from Frost's letters,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.039
and let's look at the first one
first.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:09.388
Frost says at the time that
he's publishing A Boy's

00:10:09.388 --> 00:10:13.174
Will, to a friend:
You mustn't take me too

00:10:13.174 --> 00:10:16.762
seriously if I now proceed to
brag a bit about my exploits as

00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:19.684
a poet.
There is one qualifying fact

00:10:19.684 --> 00:10:23.752
always to bear in mind:
there is a kind of success

00:10:23.752 --> 00:10:27.820
called "of esteem" and it
butters no parsnips.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.353
It means a success with a
critical few who are supposed to

00:10:32.353 --> 00:10:34.842
know.
But really to arrive where I

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:38.777
can stand on my legs as a poet
and nothing else I must get

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:42.780
outside that circle to the
general reader who buys books in

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.220
their thousands.
I may not be able to do that.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.649
I believe in doing it – don't
you doubt me there.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.779
I want to be a poet for all
sorts and kinds.

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:57.237
I could never make a merit of
being caviare to the crowd the

00:10:57.237 --> 00:10:59.730
way my quasi-friend Pound does.
 

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.377
I want to reach out,
and would if it were a thing I

00:11:03.377 --> 00:11:07.755
could do – if it were a thing
I could do by taking thought.

00:11:07.755 --> 00:11:11.330
[Frost to John Bartlett,
November 1913]

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:21.519
Frost wishes to be so subtle as
to seem altogether obvious.

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:24.970
It's not just that he seems
obvious but is really subtle.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.978
Rather, his subtlety shows
itself in his deliberate

00:11:28.978 --> 00:11:32.745
concealment of it,
in the ways in which he masks

00:11:32.745 --> 00:11:34.909
himself in obviousness.
 

00:11:34.909 --> 00:11:38.943
The problems that Frost's
poetry poses for us as readers

00:11:38.943 --> 00:11:41.289
are not problems of reference.
 

00:11:41.289 --> 00:11:43.659
They can't be solved by
footnotes.

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:49.203
Compare the footnotes in the
Frost poems to the footnotes in

00:11:49.203 --> 00:11:55.309
The Norton that you find
next to Eliot or Pound's poems.

00:11:55.309 --> 00:12:00.414
The problems that Frost poses
are problems of interpretation,

00:12:00.414 --> 00:12:05.093
problems that provoke you to
ask not, "what does he mean

00:12:05.093 --> 00:12:08.940
exactly?"
but "how does he mean that?"

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.269
Is he joking or is he serious?
 

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:15.159
Is there something on his mind
that he's not saying?

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:20.380
The wonder of Frost is really
in his tone, his way of saying

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.450
things without saying them in so
many words.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.944
Now, this guile of his,
because that's what it entails,

00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:33.709
this guile is something
temperamental,

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:37.220
I think.
It came naturally to him.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:42.360
But it also reflects a specific
literary situation.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.301
The popular,
old-fashioned Frost and the

00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:52.164
elite, modern Frost--these roles
point to a division in the

00:12:52.164 --> 00:12:58.330
audiences for poetry that
emerges clearly in this period.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.843
The Frost who writes a
familiar, crafted lyric that

00:13:02.843 --> 00:13:06.905
would have been easily
recognizable as poetry,

00:13:06.905 --> 00:13:11.870
that we could give a little tag
to after its title;

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:18.137
well, contrast this with the
poet of The Waste Land,

00:13:18.137 --> 00:13:24.079
say, whose work would not have
been recognizable to many

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:28.509
readers as poetry and indeed was
not.

00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:34.394
On one level Frost was--spoke
for and to an audience trained

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:40.279
by the genteel poetry of late
nineteenth-century America,

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:44.209
readers who loved Longfellow,
the Fireside Poets,

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:48.549
poets who published in
Victorian popular magazines and

00:13:48.549 --> 00:13:53.297
wrote those gilt-embossed books
that cultured families kept

00:13:53.297 --> 00:13:58.373
behind glass bookcases and that
you can still find at tag sales

00:13:58.373 --> 00:14:00.830
on New England greens.
 

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:05.463
That's the obvious Frost,
the one that the subtle Frost

00:14:05.463 --> 00:14:09.547
in many ways constructed,
aiming all the time not at a

00:14:09.547 --> 00:14:12.957
general reader at all but at an
elite reader of the new

00:14:12.957 --> 00:14:16.715
tiny-circulation,
Little Magazines where the work

00:14:16.715 --> 00:14:20.660
of Eliot, Williams,
Stevens, Moore and others were

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.384
first published;
those magazines I showed you

00:14:24.384 --> 00:14:28.774
last week, magazines like
Broom or Blast or

00:14:28.774 --> 00:14:31.909
Rogue or The
Criterion.

00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:37.733
There's duplicity in Frost's
poetry, and there's a certain

00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:43.250
doubleness in the figure that he
projects as a poet.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:48.708
I like to think of his
obsession with double meanings,

00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:52.828
which he has,
as a way of responding to a

00:14:52.828 --> 00:14:58.153
division in culture,
between popular and elite

00:14:58.153 --> 00:15:05.114
readers, a division that he saw
as expressive of a division in

00:15:05.114 --> 00:15:10.250
American culture between money
and esteem,

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.919
business and art.
 

00:15:12.919 --> 00:15:17.352
In that quotation I read for
you a few moments ago,

00:15:17.352 --> 00:15:22.139
Frost opposes two kinds of
success: one of "esteem,"

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:27.049
that success with a critical
few that "butters no parsnips"

00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:31.960
– You can see he brings in the
kind of folksy term to,

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.668
well, to what?
To disdain that kind of success

00:15:36.668 --> 00:15:38.889
or put it in its place.
 

00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:41.687
– and on the other hand,
a success with the general

00:15:41.687 --> 00:15:44.000
reader who buys books in their
thousands.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.870
Frost wanted both.
 

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.628
The opposition is between
poetry that makes money and

00:15:51.628 --> 00:15:55.747
poetry that, precisely because
it is good poetry as modern

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.059
poetry defines it,
does not.

00:15:58.059 --> 00:16:02.849
Notice that the latter kind of
poetry, the good kind that

00:16:02.849 --> 00:16:07.381
"butters no parsnips," is
associated here with Frost's

00:16:07.381 --> 00:16:09.519
"quasi-friend Pound."
 

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:14.813
Instead of butter,
Pound writes "caviare" – kind

00:16:14.813 --> 00:16:17.621
of a European thing,
right?

00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:19.802
Caviar.
By contrast,

00:16:19.802 --> 00:16:24.267
Frost is declaring his ambition
to reach out to a large

00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:28.152
audience.
It is for Frost a frankly

00:16:28.152 --> 00:16:30.350
economic ambition.
 

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.924
By becoming a poet for all
sorts and kinds,

00:16:33.924 --> 00:16:37.669
Frost intends,
as he says, to arrive "where I

00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:42.350
can stand on my legs as a poet
and nothing else..."

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:48.266
This is ambition for a career,
but it's also a desire for

00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:50.379
personal autonomy.
 

00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:55.913
For Frost, poetry is invested
with a longing for autonomy in,

00:16:55.913 --> 00:16:59.509
well, both simple and complex
senses.

00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:04.529
He wants to use poetry to stand
on his own two legs.

00:17:04.529 --> 00:17:09.779
He sees it specifically – and
this is important – as a form

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:14.182
of work that will allow him to
be self-sufficient and

00:17:14.182 --> 00:17:15.960
self-determining.
 

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:21.880
Frost was born in 1874 into a
working family.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.450
His father's death,
when Frost was a boy,

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.217
represented,
among other things,

00:17:28.217 --> 00:17:31.610
an economic crisis for his
family.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.009
Frost's schooling was erratic.
 

00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:37.679
This is impressive:
he dropped out of both

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:42.334
Dartmouth and Harvard,
and he did so to take laboring

00:17:42.334 --> 00:17:45.563
jobs,
each time enacting a conflict

00:17:45.563 --> 00:17:50.326
between intellectual life and
manual labor that would be a

00:17:50.326 --> 00:17:54.170
persistent and central theme of
his poetry.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.099
He worked at all sorts of jobs:
in factories,

00:17:58.099 --> 00:18:00.599
at a mill, on a newspaper.
 

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:05.168
He was a schoolteacher,
and of course he was a farmer,

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:09.650
too, when his grandfather gave
him a farm to work,

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.758
which he did,
for ten years in Derry,

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:16.489
New Hampshire.
It's in fact at the end of this

00:18:16.489 --> 00:18:20.960
period that Frost moved himself
and his family to England,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.354
in a last-ditch bid to make
literary contacts and advance

00:18:26.354 --> 00:18:28.569
his career as a poet.
 

00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:32.834
It was first in England that
Frost published the books that

00:18:32.834 --> 00:18:37.539
established his reputation as
the pasture poet of New England,

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:42.481
a poet whose authority seemed
to rest on his being rooted in

00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:46.779
his region.
Once he returned to New England

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:52.681
in 1916, after North of
Boston, success followed on

00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:56.725
success.
Poetry was a way for Frost out

00:18:56.725 --> 00:19:02.537
of manual labor but it was also
a form of work for Frost that

00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:05.539
was opposed to manual labor.
 

00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:09.288
It was an escape from it,
a way of transcending it,

00:19:09.288 --> 00:19:14.011
but also in many ways allied to
it – valuable because it could

00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:19.059
be a form of productive labor,
something he could use to

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:21.359
"butter his parsnips."
 

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:27.009
These concerns that I'm laying
out all inform his poetry.

00:19:27.009 --> 00:19:33.438
They structure Frost's work as
a poet and his ongoing inquiry

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:37.977
into that work.
Frost poems perform a kind of

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:41.069
phenomenology of work,
of labor.

00:19:41.069 --> 00:19:44.930
They say what it is like to
work at something.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.401
In so doing,
they are always also brooding

00:19:49.401 --> 00:19:54.309
on what it is like to read and
write poems.

00:19:54.309 --> 00:20:00.425
This is the case with "Mowing,"
which is in your packet from

00:20:00.425 --> 00:20:07.370
RIS, and is an example of one of
these Frostian poems about work.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.750
 
 

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.820
Let me read it for you.
 

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.009
 
 

00:20:15.009 --> 00:20:20.339
There was never a sound
beside the wood but one,

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:25.510
And that was my long scythe
whispering to the ground.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.700
What was it it whispered?
 

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:35.471
I knew not well myself;
Perhaps it was something about

00:20:35.471 --> 00:20:39.655
the heat of the sun,
Something, perhaps,

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:45.387
about the lack of sound--
And that was why it whispered

00:20:45.387 --> 00:20:47.029
and did not speak.
 

00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:51.170
It was no dream of the gift of
idle hours,

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:56.390
Or easy gold at the hand of fay
or elf:

00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:00.240
Anything more than the truth
would have seemed too weak

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.349
To the earnest love that laid
the swale in rows,

00:21:05.349 --> 00:21:08.970
Not without feeble-pointed
spikes of flowers

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:14.233
(Pale orchises),
and scared a bright green

00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:18.234
snake.
The fact is the sweetest dream

00:21:18.234 --> 00:21:20.019
that labor knows.
 

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:26.690
My long scythe whispered and
left the hay to make.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:33.590
This is a monologue by a
worker, a mower.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:38.880
It is a sonnet, too.
 

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.520
It's a sort of song of a worker.
 

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.690
 
 

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:55.284
Notice that Frost is interested
at once in the presence of a

00:21:55.284 --> 00:22:01.789
sound, the sound of a solitary
worker,

00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:06.380
or, to be more precise,
the sound of the tool of the

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.788
worker.
The sound is the sign of his

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:14.038
work.
And it raises a specifically

00:22:14.038 --> 00:22:18.730
interpretive question:
what is the message of the work

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.590
that the man does?
 

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.490
What is it saying?
 

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.330
What is its meaning?
 

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.150
"What was it it whispered?"
 

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:35.176
Beside this one of many tools
in Frost, I asked you to pay

00:22:35.176 --> 00:22:42.259
attention to tools in his poetry
as you read it over the weekend.

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:46.250
To work in Frost is to use a
tool.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:51.740
Tools mediate the worker's
relation to the world.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:58.769
It's what the worker uses to do
things and to make things.

00:22:58.769 --> 00:23:03.889
Things are not "made up" in
Frost, "not made up" in the

00:23:03.889 --> 00:23:08.060
sense of imagined,
called up out of thin air,

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.619
like fairies and elves.
 

00:23:10.619 --> 00:23:15.279
Instead, things in Frost are
"made" in the sense of

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:18.781
"constructed."
They're the products of

00:23:18.781 --> 00:23:22.279
specific acts,
of the acts of a worker.

00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:25.819
Think of other tools in those
poems.

00:23:25.819 --> 00:23:30.452
There's the spade in "Home
Burial," the spade that's used

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:33.430
to bury the couple's little
child.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.109
I'll talk more about that poem
next time.

00:23:37.109 --> 00:23:42.059
There's the ladder to heaven in
"After Apple-Picking."

00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:47.487
It's a ladder used to ascend a
tree, it's a kind of tool of

00:23:47.487 --> 00:23:52.259
ascent that's a kind of a tool
for getting fruit.

00:23:52.259 --> 00:23:57.526
And then there's the terrible
chainsaw in "Out,

00:23:57.526 --> 00:24:02.200
Out --."
In "Mowing," the scythe makes a

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.424
sound as it cuts,
and that sound is delicate,

00:24:07.424 --> 00:24:10.630
it's quiet, it whispers.
 

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:14.000
But cutting is something
fearful and forceful;

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.450
it's a kind of controlled
violence.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:23.413
Frost takes it for granted that
we will remember that the scythe

00:24:23.413 --> 00:24:28.809
is a conventional image for
time, which harvests all of us

00:24:28.809 --> 00:24:33.071
in death.
Time and death – these are

00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:39.892
the forces that the worker works
against and tries to marshal in

00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:45.089
the process of working his will
in the world,

00:24:45.089 --> 00:24:48.404
to make his way in it,
to earn his living,

00:24:48.404 --> 00:24:50.910
to stand on his own two feet.
 

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:57.785
But these forces are not
something that the man controls

00:24:57.785 --> 00:25:02.160
as a simple extension of
himself.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.059
Tools in Frost are tricky.
 

00:25:05.059 --> 00:25:07.660
You have to learn how to use
them.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.853
They have in Frost a kind of
independent, objective

00:25:11.853 --> 00:25:14.910
existence.
Remember "Out, Out--."

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.810
If you look on page 213 in your
Norton,

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.820
well, I'll read from the middle
of the poem.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:30.086
A boy is out sawing:
His sister stood beside

00:25:30.086 --> 00:25:31.360
them [-- the group.
 

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.090
He's not alone, he's with
others.] in her apron

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.450
To tell them "Supper."
 

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:42.024
At the word, the saw,
As if to prove saws knew what

00:25:42.024 --> 00:25:45.271
supper meant,
Leaped out at the boy's hand,

00:25:45.271 --> 00:25:49.390
or seemed to leap--
He must have given the hand.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.260
However it was,
Neither refused the meeting.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.226
But the hand!
The boy's first outcry was a

00:25:57.226 --> 00:25:59.947
rueful laugh,
As he swung toward them holding

00:25:59.947 --> 00:26:01.731
up the hand,
Half in appeal,

00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:05.820
but half as if to keep
The life from spilling.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.205
Then the boy saw all--
Since he was old enough to

00:26:10.205 --> 00:26:13.181
know, big boy
Doing a man's work,

00:26:13.181 --> 00:26:18.500
though a child at heart--
He saw all spoiled.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.060
"Don't let him cut my hand off--
The doctor, when he comes.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.810
Don't let him, sister!"
 

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.164
So.
But the hand was gone

00:26:27.164 --> 00:26:31.539
already.
And the boy dies.

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:36.819
It's an extraordinarily
powerful poem.

00:26:36.819 --> 00:26:41.150
This saw, rather than
whispering, snarls and rattles.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.670
Ultimately, it takes the life
of the worker.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:50.956
It reminds the worker that it
has the power of death,

00:26:50.956 --> 00:26:58.089
the force that the worker only
accesses through the tool.

00:26:58.089 --> 00:27:03.194
Although Frost's tools give the
worker a way to impose his will

00:27:03.194 --> 00:27:07.415
on the world,
the tool is part of the object

00:27:07.415 --> 00:27:12.889
world and it declares here
brutally and cruelly that the

00:27:12.889 --> 00:27:18.960
worker's will is limited and
subject to the tools he uses.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:28.076
In "Mowing," the poem's lines
are like sweeps of the scythe as

00:27:28.076 --> 00:27:32.410
it lays down rows of swale.
 

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.259
Frost wants us to think about
that.

00:27:34.259 --> 00:27:38.686
He wants us to see the row,
the harvested rows as being

00:27:38.686 --> 00:27:40.490
like lines of verse.
 

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:47.130
It's an ancient association
from classical poetry.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.000
The word "swale" is interesting.
 

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.583
You hear in it the s and
the w,

00:27:53.583 --> 00:27:58.062
the two key sounds of this
poem, which are the sounds of

00:27:58.062 --> 00:28:00.180
the whispering scythe.
 

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:05.160
Frost loves verbal sounds and
he loves to play with their

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.650
metaphorical associations.
 

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.944
He invites us to hear the sweep
of the scythe in those s

00:28:11.944 --> 00:28:16.245
sounds themselves,
I think, and maybe even to hear

00:28:16.245 --> 00:28:21.513
the workers huff and puff,
his rhythmic exhalation in the

00:28:21.513 --> 00:28:25.053
w's,
which alternate and interact

00:28:25.053 --> 00:28:26.880
with those s's.
 

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.809
The whisper of the scythe then.
 

00:28:29.809 --> 00:28:33.099
This is what the poem is all
about.

00:28:33.099 --> 00:28:36.273
The whisper is not,
Frost specifies,

00:28:36.273 --> 00:28:39.720
a "dream of the gift of idle
hours."

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.625
Poetry is not,
that is to say,

00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:45.329
a leisure class activity.
 

00:28:45.329 --> 00:28:50.163
Frost is writing against the
Romantic idea that poetry is

00:28:50.163 --> 00:28:53.529
written in repose,
received passively as

00:28:53.529 --> 00:28:56.573
inspiration.
Poetry, in Frost,

00:28:56.573 --> 00:29:01.268
is action, not a matter,
as Wordsworth would say,

00:29:01.268 --> 00:29:05.279
of emotion recollected in
tranquility.

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:09.426
Frost is also here specifically
writing against the early poetry

00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:12.059
of Yeats, which you'll read next
week,

00:29:12.059 --> 00:29:17.858
poetry that finds reality
exactly in "dream," and that has

00:29:17.858 --> 00:29:21.519
plenty of fairies and elves in
it.

00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:29.059
Frost is not after "easy gold"
but rather hard-earned wages.

00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:35.046
"Dream": here Frost implies
that it is something,

00:29:35.046 --> 00:29:40.410
"dream" is something more than
the truth.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:44.771
He has that phrase,
"Anything more than the truth

00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:50.313
would have seemed too weak / to
the earnest love that laid the

00:29:50.313 --> 00:29:53.852
swale in rows."
That's an interesting phrase,

00:29:53.852 --> 00:29:55.290
"more than the truth."
 

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:59.862
Why not "less"?
Why isn't "dream" less than the

00:29:59.862 --> 00:30:03.202
truth?
Frost has made a suggestive

00:30:03.202 --> 00:30:07.660
choice of words.
Truth is something less than

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.990
dream, in Frost.
Truth is life-sized.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:16.047
To get down to it,
you have to cut away what is

00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:19.927
not true, what is inflated,
beside the point,

00:30:19.927 --> 00:30:21.779
excess, ornament.
 

00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:24.140
The truth is something that you
get down to.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.890
The truth is a reduction,
a simplification.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:34.212
It is what is fit for the
earnest love that is working for

00:30:34.212 --> 00:30:38.829
truth.
"Love": this is a crucial word

00:30:38.829 --> 00:30:42.512
in Frost.
You don't think of Frost as a

00:30:42.512 --> 00:30:47.140
love poet.
There are love poems in Frost.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:54.165
And yet even apart from those
there are many poems that use

00:30:54.165 --> 00:31:01.069
that word "love," often in
crucial places in the poems.

00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:08.835
In fact, love and desire are
really at the center of Frost's

00:31:08.835 --> 00:31:12.699
poetry.
So far, I've been stressing a

00:31:12.699 --> 00:31:17.687
kind of anti-Romantic side of
Frost, how he seems to be

00:31:17.687 --> 00:31:21.660
saying, "Nothing but the facts,
please."

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:26.131
"But the fact," he says in that
next to last line,

00:31:26.131 --> 00:31:31.150
"is the sweetest dream" of
labor, and it is earnest love

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.980
that is doing this cutting.
 

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:39.460
Labor loves;
labor dreams.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.617
When we look carefully at this
poem, in fact,

00:31:43.617 --> 00:31:48.909
the distinction that Frost
seems to make between fact and

00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:51.650
dream starts to give way.
 

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:56.500
Let me go back to the sound of
this work.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.109
"What was it it whispered?"
 

00:32:00.109 --> 00:32:06.549
Note Frost's use of words like
"something" and "perhaps."

00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:10.719
These are words you're not
supposed to use in poems or in

00:32:10.719 --> 00:32:12.730
even writing about poems.
 

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:17.482
In Frost, there is here this
explicit, deliberate,

00:32:17.482 --> 00:32:22.527
calculated vagueness,
a withholding of certainty that

00:32:22.527 --> 00:32:27.667
allows a range of possible
meanings to be entertained,

00:32:27.667 --> 00:32:31.182
held open.
It's a rhetorical and

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:36.881
conceptual move that I think is
analogous to the whispering of

00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:41.277
the scythe.
What I mean is that this tool

00:32:41.277 --> 00:32:44.652
doesn't speak loudly;
it whispers,

00:32:44.652 --> 00:32:48.180
and you have to lean forward to
hear it.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:54.812
The same is true with the poem,
with any Frost poem – except

00:32:54.812 --> 00:33:01.227
that line 13 seems to violate
that, it seems to violate that

00:33:01.227 --> 00:33:04.665
principle.
"The fact is the sweetest dream

00:33:04.665 --> 00:33:05.839
that labor knows."
 

00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:09.463
Well, here Frost seems to be
spelling things out,

00:33:09.463 --> 00:33:12.710
making a declaration,
making a statement,

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.688
saying what the fact is,
and seeming to celebrate the

00:33:16.688 --> 00:33:21.048
literal: "the fact is the
sweetest dream that labor

00:33:21.048 --> 00:33:23.084
knows."
Importantly,

00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:27.960
though, that's not the last
thing the poem says.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:34.272
What difference would it make
had Frost, as he could have,

00:33:34.272 --> 00:33:39.920
I suppose, reversed the order
of lines 13 and 14?

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.591
Line 13 stands out,
as if almost--as if out of the

00:33:44.591 --> 00:33:49.740
poem, as if out of time,
as a kind of fact or truth,

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.073
a fixed principle that is
stated in a kind of eternal

00:33:54.073 --> 00:33:58.990
present – "the fact is" –
like no other sentence in this

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.673
poem.
Had Frost decided to end the

00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:05.401
poem there, he would have said,
or seemed to be saying,

00:34:05.401 --> 00:34:07.680
"This is what it's all about."
 

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:13.108
It would be like one of those
morals following the titles of

00:34:13.108 --> 00:34:15.164
his poem.
But in fact,

00:34:15.164 --> 00:34:17.079
he doesn't end there.
 

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:19.989
He doesn't make so clear a
declaration.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:24.300
Line 14 returns us to the work
of mowing.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:29.832
"My long scythe whispered and
left the hay to make" returns us

00:34:29.832 --> 00:34:34.185
to the work of mowing and the
work of reading and

00:34:34.185 --> 00:34:37.360
interpretation and deciphering.
 

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:44.176
The poem ends with an image of
process, and not of product,

00:34:44.176 --> 00:34:48.289
an image of the process of
labor.

00:34:48.289 --> 00:34:54.064
The implication is that it is
the same way for the poet who

00:34:54.064 --> 00:34:59.440
lays his words in rows,
in those rows of swale that are

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.730
his lines of verse.
 

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.219
The hay, that is, well, what?
 

00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:09.701
The payoff, what the poem is
all about, what mowing is all

00:35:09.701 --> 00:35:12.408
about.
The hay isn't handed over to

00:35:12.408 --> 00:35:16.090
you.
It's rather "left… to make."

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.369
That's a rich phrase.
 

00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:23.103
What Frost gives you here and
elsewhere is a poetry that

00:35:23.103 --> 00:35:26.090
leaves its meanings to make,
all the time.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:32.226
Frost's poetry is engaged in
construing, constructing,

00:35:32.226 --> 00:35:37.900
constituting facts,
which means it doesn't give us

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:42.300
the truth as if it were a
product,

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:47.356
a fashioned object;
rather, it gives us a process,

00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:52.217
an act of fashioning,
an act that is involved with

00:35:52.217 --> 00:35:55.690
dreams and desire and with love.
 

00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:02.739
Facts are made and not found in
Frost's poetry of work.

00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:09.252
And this is to say that the
process by which facts are made

00:36:09.252 --> 00:36:14.529
is, well, it's like work and is
therefore, well,

00:36:14.529 --> 00:36:19.469
it's something daily,
ordinary, ongoing;

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:24.440
and for these reasons incapable
of completion.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.828
It's something that we have to
do over and over again,

00:36:29.828 --> 00:36:32.980
that is, making up the world.
 

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:37.389
"Poetry is a response to the
daily necessity of getting the

00:36:37.389 --> 00:36:40.211
world right."
Stevens said that,

00:36:40.211 --> 00:36:43.480
but Frost could have said it,
too.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.692
Meaning in Frost poems,
as in the world that they

00:36:47.692 --> 00:36:51.289
evoke, has to be interpreted
every day.

00:36:51.289 --> 00:36:56.449
It has to be in that sense
worked for again and again.

00:36:56.449 --> 00:37:05.458
Well, let me use this poem as a
way into now talking about sound

00:37:05.458 --> 00:37:10.942
in more actual,
more literal ways in Frost's

00:37:10.942 --> 00:37:17.920
poetry and to begin with you to
think a little bit about meter,

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.670
in fact, and what Frost does
with it.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:30.047
Let me go back to the handout
where we've got more passages

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:36.446
from Frost's letters,
and in particular what Frost

00:37:36.446 --> 00:37:42.820
has to say about something he
calls "the sound of sense";

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.260
 
 

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.690
although he says in that first
quotation that,

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.130
well, he doesn't like to brag.
 

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:55.294
I alone of English
writers have consciously set

00:37:55.294 --> 00:37:59.250
myself to make music out of what
I may call the sound of sense.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:03.269
[This is an ambitious guy.]
Now, it is possible to have

00:38:03.269 --> 00:38:07.512
sense without the sound of sense
(as in much prose that is

00:38:07.512 --> 00:38:11.903
supposed to pass muster but
makes very dull reading) and the

00:38:11.903 --> 00:38:17.039
sound of sense without sense (as
in Alice in Wonderland,

00:38:17.039 --> 00:38:19.860
which makes anything but dull
reading).

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.844
[This is a wonderful metaphor.]
The best place to get the

00:38:23.844 --> 00:38:28.185
abstract sound of sense is from
voices behind a door that cuts

00:38:28.185 --> 00:38:29.680
off the words....
 

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.260
[Understand what Frost means?
 

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.782
He wants us to think about how
we could understand what people

00:38:35.782 --> 00:38:40.230
are saying without taking in the
words that they're using,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:47.273
simply by catching the tones
and rhythms of their exchanges.

00:38:47.273 --> 00:38:49.410
...
The sound of sense, then.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:54.007
You get that.
It is the abstract vitality of

00:38:54.007 --> 00:38:58.019
our speech.
It is pure sound – pure form.

00:38:58.019 --> 00:39:03.026
One who concerns himself with
it more than the subject is an

00:39:03.026 --> 00:39:06.015
artist.
But remember we are still

00:39:06.015 --> 00:39:10.110
talking merely of the raw
material of poetry.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:14.759
An ear and an appetite for
these sounds of sense is the

00:39:14.759 --> 00:39:19.840
first qualification of a writer,
be it of prose or verse.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:26.710
But if one is to be a poet he
must learn to get cadences by

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:32.988
skillfully breaking the sounds
of sense with all their

00:39:32.988 --> 00:39:40.570
irregularity of accent across
the regular beat of the metre.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.565
Verse in which there is nothing
but the beat of the metre

00:39:43.565 --> 00:39:46.614
furnished by the accents of the
polysyllabic words we call

00:39:46.614 --> 00:39:50.159
doggerel.
Verse is not that.

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:54.940
Neither is it the sound of
sense alone.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.440
It is the resultant from those
two.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.050
There are only two or three
metres that are worth anything.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.878
We depend for variety on the
infinite play of accents,

00:40:05.878 --> 00:40:07.052
in the sound of sense.
 

00:40:07.052 --> 00:40:09.400
[Frost to John Bartlett,
July 1913]

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:17.099
Frost's "sound of sense," the
abstract vitality of our speech.

00:40:17.099 --> 00:40:23.190
It has to do exactly with how
people say what they say.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:26.906
These are dimensions of
communication that I've been

00:40:26.906 --> 00:40:31.059
identifying in "Mowing" with the
whisper of the scythe,

00:40:31.059 --> 00:40:35.600
that is, a tone of meaning or a
way of meaning.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.110
"The sound of sense."
 

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:42.159
It represents common and
vernacular elements of speech.

00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:46.722
The sounds of sense are all
part of language in use,

00:40:46.722 --> 00:40:50.570
which people are using to do
things with.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:54.920
But, Frost stresses,
poetry is not only that;

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.909
it's something more.
 

00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:59.323
It's the sound of sense,
as he says, broken – and

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:03.010
that's another interesting
metaphor – it's broken,

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:08.610
he says, skillfully across the
beat of the meter.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.519
Meter is something regular;
it's a fixed scheme;

00:41:12.519 --> 00:41:16.860
it's inflexible,
as Frost conceives of it here.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:20.053
The speaking voice,
by contrast,

00:41:20.053 --> 00:41:25.409
is something idiosyncratic,
irregular, particular.

00:41:25.409 --> 00:41:30.539
In the second quotation,
or rather the last on the page

00:41:30.539 --> 00:41:35.480
but the second one about the
subject, Frost says:

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:41.154
My versification seems to
bother people more than I should

00:41:41.154 --> 00:41:45.658
have expected [because he seemed
to ears tutored in

00:41:45.658 --> 00:41:51.152
nineteenth-century norms to have
a kind of rough and irregular

00:41:51.152 --> 00:41:56.466
metric]--I suppose because I
have been so long accustomed to

00:41:56.466 --> 00:42:00.519
thinking of it in my own private
way.

00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:04.276
It is as simple as this:
there are the very regular

00:42:04.276 --> 00:42:08.408
pre-established accent and
measure of blank verse [blank

00:42:08.408 --> 00:42:11.530
verse,
that is--and I'll explain

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:16.560
it--unrhymed iambic pentameter];
and there are the very

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:21.139
irregular accent and measure of
speaking intonation.

00:42:21.139 --> 00:42:26.207
I am never more pleased than
when I can get these into

00:42:26.207 --> 00:42:28.119
strained relation.
 

00:42:28.119 --> 00:42:33.096
[Frost wants to create a sound
effect of strained relation in

00:42:33.096 --> 00:42:37.823
his poetry, a strained relation
between speech and meter.]

00:42:37.823 --> 00:42:40.643
I like to [and again the same
word]

00:42:40.643 --> 00:42:45.619
drag and break the intonation
across the meter as waves first

00:42:45.619 --> 00:42:50.927
comb and then break stumbling on
the shingle [and now I'm writing

00:42:50.927 --> 00:42:53.250
a poem, it seems].
 

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.903
That's all [he says,]
but it's no mere figure of

00:42:55.903 --> 00:42:59.121
speech though one can make
figures enough about it [and in

00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:01.506
fact,
you can see Frost doing that in

00:43:01.506 --> 00:43:02.898
his poetry very often].
 

00:43:02.898 --> 00:43:05.380
Frost to John Cournos,
July 1914]

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.702
"Strained relation," this
tension between speech and

00:43:09.702 --> 00:43:14.787
pattern, suggests the tension
between all sorts of contending

00:43:14.787 --> 00:43:18.008
forces in Frost:
the vernacular and the

00:43:18.008 --> 00:43:22.430
literary,
the concrete and the abstract;

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:29.564
flux, fixity;
the individual will and

00:43:29.564 --> 00:43:34.439
material fact.
The special sound of Frost's

00:43:34.439 --> 00:43:39.709
poems result from the tensions
between these pairs of opposing

00:43:39.709 --> 00:43:43.769
forces as they are embodied in
his language.

00:43:43.769 --> 00:43:49.584
To approach this,
you'll need to know a little

00:43:49.584 --> 00:43:53.999
bit about meter.
In fact, a rough grasp on

00:43:53.999 --> 00:43:59.015
traditional English meter is
essential to Frost and it's also

00:43:59.015 --> 00:44:03.530
important to other poets we'll
read – to Stevens,

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.650
say, or to Crane,
or to Auden or Bishop.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:15.549
Obviously, these are poets who
work usually in quite

00:44:15.549 --> 00:44:18.389
traditional meters.
 

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:22.752
And yet, it's also important
for reading Pound and for

00:44:22.752 --> 00:44:25.880
reading Eliot and for reading
Moore,

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:30.279
who sound the way they do
partly because they make a point

00:44:30.279 --> 00:44:34.875
of not writing pentameter,
the meter that Frost often,

00:44:34.875 --> 00:44:37.130
but not always,
chooses.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:44.663
How many of you know what
iambic pentameter is?

00:44:44.663 --> 00:44:49.199
Don't be shy.
Okay.

00:44:49.199 --> 00:44:54.651
I'm going to spend a little bit
of time at the beginning of

00:44:54.651 --> 00:45:00.384
class next time talking about it
and working with you a little

00:45:00.384 --> 00:45:05.742
bit as we read Frost and in
particular we can use the poem

00:45:05.742 --> 00:45:08.280
"Birches" to do that.
 

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.210
Don't be distressed if you're
unfamiliar with it.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:17.459
Knowing what iambic pentameter
is, is not a gift of birth,

00:45:17.459 --> 00:45:22.432
but rather something that comes
through a little bit of

00:45:22.432 --> 00:45:25.481
practice,
which means we have to work at

00:45:25.481 --> 00:45:29.075
it a little bit.
And I will, in order to enable

00:45:29.075 --> 00:45:32.977
you to do that,
give you a--or actually ask the

00:45:32.977 --> 00:45:37.898
TFs in section to hand out a
meter exercise that you can do

00:45:37.898 --> 00:45:41.319
for next week.
When you leave today,

00:45:41.319 --> 00:45:46.491
I would like to collect cards,
just to figure out how many of

00:45:46.491 --> 00:45:49.834
us there are,
and as I say,

00:45:49.834 --> 00:45:56.484
on Wednesday,
between the online registration

00:45:56.484 --> 00:46:02.533
and our work on it in class,
we should be able to get our

00:46:02.533 --> 00:46:03.410
sections ordered.
 

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.000
So, see you on Wednesday.

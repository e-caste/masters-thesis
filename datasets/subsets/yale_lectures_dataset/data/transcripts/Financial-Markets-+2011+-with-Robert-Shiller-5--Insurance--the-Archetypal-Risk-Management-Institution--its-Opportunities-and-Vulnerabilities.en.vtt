00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.490
OK, good morning.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.080
I've been running to
get over here.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.640
I just got back from The
World Economic Forum.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.190
We talked to a lot of the
world's financial leaders.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.150
And I was thinking what I would
tell you about it, but

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.480
then I realized, it's all off
the record, so I'm not

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.750
supposed to say anything
to you.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.580
I was going to talk instead
today about insurance, which

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:40.170
is one of the major risk
management institutions that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.290
is not always considered part
of finance, because people

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.220
think of finance and insurance
as separate.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:01:05.180
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.320
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: We
talked about basic principles

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.160
of risk management in the
preceding lecture.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.670
It's all the same for finance
and insurance.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.360
Yet, we tend to consider them
as separate businesses.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.170
That's partly, I think, an
accident of history, and it's

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.180
partly a product of regulation
because of certain ideas --

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.660
that we'll come to in
a few minutes --

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.420
that has kept the insurance
industry separate from other

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.320
financial industries.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.150
Last period, we talked about
the mean-variance risk

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.440
management problem, and
about the Capital

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.100
Asset Pricing Model.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.620
That's fundamental to
insurance as well.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.789
The basic idea is pooling of
risks and preventing people

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.520
from being subjected to extreme
risks through the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.840
concept of risk pooling.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.280
So, what I wanted to start
today is talking about

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.180
insurance, starting with the
concept of insurance.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.810
And then, I wanted to reiterate
a theme of this

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.880
course, that financial
institutions are inventions,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.710
they're structures that someone
had to design and make

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.980
work right.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.470
Sometimes they don't
work right.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.570
Then, I wanted to move to
a particular example of

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.370
insurance, which was until
recently the biggest insurance

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.680
company in the world, called
the American International

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.680
Group, or AIG.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.190
And it's particularly important
that we talk about

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.040
this example, because on March
2 we have the former CEO of

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.300
AIG, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg,
coming to our class.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.200
So, I thought it's appropriate
that we use AIG --

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.070
well not only because it was the
biggest insurance company

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.530
in the world, but also because
he's coming here.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.020
And then, I want to talk about
regulation of insurance, that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.880
the insurance industry has
always been subject to

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.480
government regulation.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.390
I'll talk about types
of insurance.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.710
Your chapter in Fabozzi et al.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.470
is mostly about types of
insurance, so I think you can

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.010
mostly get that from the
textbook, but I wanted to say

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.070
some things about it.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.160
And then, I was going to
conclude with thoughts about

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.710
insurance, and how important it
is to our lives, and what

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.500
progress it still has to make.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.480
So, insurance, it doesn't sound
like a very exciting

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.530
topic, does it?

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.750
I'm going to try to make
it more exciting.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.820
I guess you think of the
insurance salesman coming,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.380
knocking on your door.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.290
They don't do that so much
anymore, they used to go

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.740
around door-to-door.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.990
And that was a depressing
moment, when the life

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.720
insurance salesman came.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.240
And if you invited this person
into your house, he would tell

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.000
you about the probability of
dying, how tough it will be on

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.640
your family, that
sort of thing.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:36.930
But, to me, I think insurance is
an exciting issue, because

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.910
it's about making
our lives work.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.510
And it's really about
preventing horrible

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.950
catastrophes from --

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.330
and it involves mathematical
theory that

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.560
underlies the concept.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.040
To me, it's exciting,
but I don't know if

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.030
I can convey that.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.615
The fundamental concept,
again, is risk pooling.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.120
The idea of insurance goes back
to ancient Rome, but only

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.360
in very limited forms. But the
idea of risk pooling is kind

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.750
of an obvious one.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.230
People form organizations
partly to risk-pool.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.340
So, in ancient Rome, a common
form of insurance was death

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.310
insurance that would
pay funeral bills.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.710
People in the ancient world
believed that you had to get a

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.840
proper burial, or your soul
would wander forever.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.670
So, insurance salespeople
associated with guilds or

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.890
business organizations would
sell funeral insurance.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.240
But they didn't have a very
clear idea of the

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.350
risk pooling concept.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.890
It must have underlain
their thinking.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.100
But it wasn't until much later
that people began to

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.950
understand the concept.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.710
There are examples of insurance
throughout ancient

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.050
and medieval times, but they're

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.320
very blurred and sparse.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.890
I remember reading an insurance,
supposedly, an

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.310
insurance contract written in
Renaissance Italy, translated

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.230
into English, but it was hardly
recognizable to me as

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.200
an insurance contract.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.650
They didn't have the
concepts down.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.040
It seemed to have a lot of
religious language in it,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.290
which normally we don't think of
as something that's part of

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.150
an insurance contract.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.670
But it seems like insurance came
in in the 1600s, at the

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.720
same time that certain concepts
of mathematics began

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.970
to be developed.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.310
Notably, the concept of
probability became more widely

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.610
known in the 1600s.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.070
According to one historian, the
oldest known description

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:16.350
of the insurance concept goes
back to a Count Oldenburg.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.740
Actually, it's an anonymous
letter to Count Oldenburg,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.860
written in 1609.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.720
And the letter says, why
don't we start --

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.190
I'm paraphrasing at the moment
-- why don't we start a fund,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.720
in which people pay 1% of the
value of their home every year

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.310
into the fund, and then we will
use the fund to replace

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.130
the house if there's a fire?

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.920
And now, quoting this anonymous
writer, this writer

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.740
said he had "no doubt that it
would be fully proved, if a

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.210
calculation were made of the
number of houses consumed by

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.550
fire within a certain space in
the course of 30 years, that

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.150
the loss would not amount, by
a good deal, to the sum that

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.545
would be collected in
that time." OK?

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:00.790
It's just intuitive.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.870
He said, there can't
be that many fires.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.280
And if we collect that amount
of money every year, we can

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.110
pay for all the houses
that are burned down.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:15.040
So, he didn't express any
mathematical law, but it's the

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.500
concept of insurance.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.120
You don't find that before
that, before 1609.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.880
So, I guess we don't have any
clear statement of insurance

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.220
before then.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.990
Actually, you can find an
approximate statement of the

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.820
law of large numbers --

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.010
and I'm thinking of Aristotle,
the philosopher.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.730
This is in ancient times,
and I'm quoting from

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.630
De Caelo, his book.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.950
Aristotle: "To succeed
in many things or

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.610
many times is difficult.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.840
For instance, to repeat the same
throw 10,000 times with

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.360
the dice would be impossible,
whereas to make it once or

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.880
twice is comparatively easy."
He doesn't have the language

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.830
of probability, but he knows you
can't throw the dice 1,000

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.940
times and come up with the
same number every time.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.710
Now, we have a probability
theory about it.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:21.960
So, we know that if you have n
events, each occurring with

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:28.160
the probability of p, then the
average proportion out of the

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.860
n events that occur --

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.570
I'm sorry, we have n trials,
an event occuring with

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.550
probability p -- then the
standard deviation of this

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:50.120
proportion of events that occur
is p times 1 minus p,

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.070
all over n, to the 1/2 power.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.140
And that's a theorem from
probability theory.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.000
The standard deviation of the
proportion of trials for which

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.040
the event occurred, assuming

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.900
independence, is given by this.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.660
And so, you note that
it goes down with n.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.620
As n increases, it
goes down with --

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.810
I should say, the square
root of n.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.720
So, that means that if n gets
very large, if you write a lot

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.300
of policies, then the
probability of deviating from

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:34.950
the mean by more than one or
two standard deviations

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.730
becomes very small, which
is what Aristotle said.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:50.420
But making insurance work as
an institution, to actually

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.520
protect people against
risk, is rather

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.370
difficult to achieve.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.550
And that's because things
have to be done right.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.680
So, let me just remind
you, what are the

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.090
basic types of insurance?

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.730
This is what Fabozzi
et al. talks about.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.670
There's life insurance
that insures people

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.080
against early death.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.600
Of course, you still die.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.770
What it really insures, is your
family against the loss

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.520
of a bread winner, the
father or the mother.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.190
So, life insurance is suitably
given to families, especially

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.665
with young children, to
protect the children.

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:31.960
It used to be very important
when there was a lot more

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.980
early deaths.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.690
Now, very few young people
lose their parents.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.480
So, life insurance has receded
in importance.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.540
Another example is
health insurance.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.680
This is insurance, of course,
that you get sick and you need

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.980
medical care.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.740
Then, there's property and
casualty insurance, insuring

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.560
your house or your car.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.730
And then, there's other kinds
of what you might call

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:03.690
investment-oriented products,
like annuities.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.240
This is a table in your textbook
by Fabozzi et al.,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.910
which lists these categories
of insurance.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.530
But any of these insurance types
are inventions, and I

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.870
want to specify that.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.320
We have the idea that an
insurance company could be set

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.990
up that would, say, insure
houses against fires.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.530
And we just heard it,
intuitively, in this letter to

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.180
Oldenburg long ago.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.080
But to make it work, and to
make it work reliably,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.420
involves a lot of detail.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.730
You can think of the idea of
making an airplane, but to

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.160
make it really work, and to
make it work safely, is

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.350
another matter.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.570
So first of all, insurance needs
a contract design that

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:01.610
specifies risks, and excludes
risks that are inappropriate.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.220
An issue that insurance
companies

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.870
reach is moral hazard.

00:13:11.134 --> 00:13:25.070
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.610
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: Moral
hazard is an expression

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.870
that appeared in the 19th
century to refer to the

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.100
effects of insurance on people's
behavior that are

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.970
undesirable.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.360
So, the classic example is, you
take out fire insurance on

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.960
your house, and then you burn it
down deliberately in order

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.640
to collect on the house.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.640
Or another example is, you take
out life insurance, and

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.620
then you kill yourself to
support your family.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.660
These are undesirable outcomes,
and they could be

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.150
fatal to the whole concept of
insurance, because if you

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.720
don't control moral hazard,
obviously the whole thing is

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.790
not going to work.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.130
So, what they do in an insurance
contract is they

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.850
exclude risks that are
particularly vulnerable to

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.100
moral hazard.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:23.150
And so, that means you would
exclude certain causes of

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.225
death that might look
like suicide.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.990
You can do other things to
control moral hazard than

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.330
excluding certain causes.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.610
You can also make sure that you
don't insure the house for

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.340
more than it's worth.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:38.640
Right?

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.190
If someone insures a house,
and the insurance does not

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.460
cover the full value of the
house, then there's no

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.770
incentive to burn it down.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.880
You might as well just sell
the house, right?

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.670
No point in burning it down
if you'll still lose a

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.760
little bit of money.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.660
So, that's one of the problems
that insurance companies face.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.350
And part of the design of the
insurance contract has to

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.470
prevent moral hazard from
becoming excessive.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.620
An analagous thing is
selection bias.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.440
That occurs when --

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.800
chalk keeps breaking --

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.740
selection bias occurs when the
people who sign up for your

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.995
contract know that they
are higher risk.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.010
For example, health.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.300
People who know they have a
terminal disease and are about

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.940
to die, they'll all come signing
up for your life

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.070
insurance contract.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.170
That will put immense costs on
the insurance company, and if

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.990
they don't control the selection
bias, they will have

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.120
to charge very high premiums.
And that will force other

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.410
people, who don't know
they're going to die,

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.890
out of buying insurance.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.050
And so, that's the fundamental
problem.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:05.690
Again, something has to be done
to define the policy.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.780
So, one thing you can do is,
exclude, in life insurance,

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.140
certain causes of death that
are likely to be known.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:18.590
And you only put on causes of
death that people wouldn't be

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.925
able to predict about
themselves.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:30.590
Another aspect of insurance is
that you have to have very

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.930
specific, precise definitions
of the loss, and what

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.340
constitutes proof of
the insured loss.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.980
If you're not clear about that,
there's going to be

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.840
ambiguities later, which will
involve legal wrangling and

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.270
dissatisfaction.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.520
We'll see, in a minute, that
these problems are not minor

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.180
and they keep coming up.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.550
It's a constant challenge for
the insurance industry.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.859
Third, we need a mathematical
model of risk pooling.

00:17:00.859 --> 00:17:03.000
Well, I just wrote one down
here, but it might be more

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.460
complicated in some
circumstances.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.459
This is assuming independence.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:15.480
If you don't assume
independence, you can make

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.690
more complicated models.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.980
Then, fourth, you need a
collection of statistics on

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:28.150
risks, and you need to evaluate
the quality of those

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.300
statistics.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.060
So for example, in the 1600s,
people started collecting

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.340
mortality tables for
the first time.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.550
There was no data on
ages at death.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.210
It began in the 1600s, because
people were building an

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.400
insurance industry and they
needed to know those things.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.540
Then, you need a form
for the company.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.310
What is the insurance company?

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.840
Who owns it?

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.030
It could be a corporate form.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.650
There are shareholders who are
investing in the company.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.110
And they're taking the risk
that some of our policy

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.600
modeling, or handling of moral
hazard, or selection bias

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.850
wasn't right.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:12.010
Some insurance companies are
mutual, rather than share.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:16.510
The insurance is run for the
benefit of the policyholders,

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.180
and they're like a nonprofit in
the sense that the founders

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.860
of the company pay themselves
salaries, but the benefits go

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.970
entirely to the policy
holders.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:31.810
Then, you need a government
design so that the government

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.690
verifies all of these things
about the insurance company.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.090
The problem with insurance is
that people will pay in for

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.520
many, many years before they
ever collect, right?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.950
Especially if you're buying life
insurance, you hope never

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.200
to collect.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.420
And so, you don't know whether
it's going to work right.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.540
That's why you need government
regulation, you need

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.220
government insurance
regulators.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.080
And that's part of the
design of insurance.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.190
It doesn't work if you don't
have the regulators, because

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.810
you wouldn't trust the
insurance company.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:11.450
So, these are problems that
have inhibited making

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.930
insurance work.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.780
I wanted to give
you an example.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.400
I think it makes it more
concrete if we start off with

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.420
talking about a particular
example.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.100
And I said I was going to talk
about AIG, which is a very

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.820
important example, not only
because it was the biggest

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.720
insurance company.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.380
It was also the biggest
bailout in the entire

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.200
financial crisis
we've seen now.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.085
And it has an interesting
story.

00:19:45.524 --> 00:20:04.200
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.510
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
So AIG, it's

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.560
an interesting story.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.910
It was founded in 1919
in Shanghai.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.030
And you wonder, why is it called
American International

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.810
Group if it's founded
in Shanghai?

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.370
It was founded in Shanghai,
called American Asiatic

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.300
Underwriters.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:39.210
And it was founded by Cornelius
Vander Starr, who

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.270
was an American who just decided
to go to Asia and

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.080
start an insurance business.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.910
Shanghai, in 1919,
was a world city.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.030
It was not really under the
Chinese government, it was

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.970
something like Hong Kong.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.400
It had constituencies
representing

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.640
many different countries.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.050
And so, it was a very lively
business center.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.450
It's kind of interesting that
the biggest insurance company

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.320
in the world emerged from
Shanghai, and also one of the

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.620
biggest banks in the
world, HSBC.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.390
You know what HSBC means?

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.550
They don't emphasize
it anymore.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.500
It's Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:27.970
So, AIG was founded by Mr. Starr
in 1919, and started

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.710
doing an insurance business
in China.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:35.400
And moved their headquarters
to New York just before

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.270
Chairman Mao took
over at China.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.360
And then, it became kind of a
Chinese investment company in

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.610
the United States.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.210
Cornelius Vander Starr ran the
company from 1919 until he

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.410
died in 1968.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:57.070
So, he was CEO for 49 years,
a half-century.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:03.560
And then, just before he died,
he appointed Hank Greenberg,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:14.730
who will visit us, as
the CEO in 1962.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.380
So, that was 49 years under
Starr, and then Greenberg took

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.450
on, and then ran the
company until 2005.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.020
So, it was 37 under Greenberg.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.870
So, two men ran the company
for almost a century.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:40.510
Since 2005, Greenberg has been
succeeded by three CEOs, the

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.140
usual thing.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.990
The usual company
turns over CEOs.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.590
There's another interesting
story that we might ask about

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.840
Hank Greenberg.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:23:00.180
He joined the U.S. Army and
fought in World War II.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:05.350
And among his jobs, then, was to
liberate Dachau, which was

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.120
a concentration camp.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.910
This is not one of the
extermination camps, it was a

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:21.900
concentration camp for Jews and
others under the Nazis.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.090
And people were starving and
dying, it was awful.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.710
At a Council on Foreign
Relations meeting, Greenberg

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.960
met with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
who is the president of Iran.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.780
And Ahmadinejad said something
about the Holocaust, doubting

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.390
that it ever happened.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.190
Greenberg stood up indignantly
and said, it happened.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.050
I saw it.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.300
I was there.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.690
It's kind of interesting to
me to think about this.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.290
This is an aside, momentarily.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.420
The other person
I've met who --

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.980
do you know Geoffrey Hartman,
who's a professor here at Yale

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.860
in literature?

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.210
He and his wife, both Jewish,
were teenagers

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.500
during World War II.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.850
And Hartman escaped by what they
called Kindertransport.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:26.460
But his wife, Renee, was in
another concentration camp.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:34.350
Not Dachau, it was
in Bratislava.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.820
And she was starving to death.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.560
And it really happened,
by the way.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.410
It's awful.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.070
And I asked her, why do
you think they were

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.150
starving you to death?

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.150
And she said, we didn't know.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.180
We thought maybe they
were keeping us as

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.490
hostages, or something.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:59.950
So anyway, we could ask
him about that.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.570
What did these people do?

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:13.960
Both Starr and Greenberg created
a wide variety of risk

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.335
management products.

00:25:16.335 --> 00:25:19.950
It became the largest
underwriter of commercial and

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.300
industrial insurance
in the world.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.090
It became a very large
automobile insurer, and also a

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:31.010
travel insurance company.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:36.920
But Greenberg was forced out of
the company after 37 years,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.930
when Eliot Spitzer, who was the
Attorney General for the

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.450
state of New York, claimed
that there were some

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.750
irregularities.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.520
And Greenberg was forced
to resign.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.680
It turns out, though, that
nothing that Spitzer said has

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.730
held up, so apparently Greenberg
was innocent of any

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.320
of the allegations.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:09.830
The real problem occurred with
AIG after Greenberg left.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:15.810
So Greenberg left in 2005, and
then the company absolutely

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:21.010
blew up, and it absolutely
had to be bailed out.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:26.460
The reason they had to be bailed
out was, it was almost

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.690
entirely due to a failure
of the independence

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.520
assumption, I would say.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.970
That under their risk
modeling, namely --

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:41.660
The company became exposed
to real estate risk.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.990
And the idea that their risk
modelers had was that it

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.350
doesn't matter that we take on
risk that home prices might

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.400
fall, because they can never
fall everywhere.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.540
They can fall in one city, but
it won't matter to us.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.610
That's just one city, and
it all averages out.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:06.350
But what actually happened after
Greenberg left was the

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:11.260
company took huge exposures
toward real estate risk and it

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.370
fell everywhere.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:15.850
Home prices fell everywhere,
just exactly what they thought

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.100
couldn't happen.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:25.820
So, the company was writing
credit default swaps --

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.530
I told you about those before --
they were taking the risk.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:33.650
They were insuring, basically,
against defaults of companies

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.600
whose credit depended on
the real estate market.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.870
They were also investing
directly in real estate

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.720
securities, in mortgage-backed
securities that depended on

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.510
the real estate market
for their success.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:54.310
And when all this failed at
once, AIG was about to fail.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:28:00.170
That meant that the federal
government decided, in 2008,

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.720
to bail out AIG.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.320
And the total bailout bill,
well, the total amount

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:14.520
committed by the U.S. federal
government was $182 billion.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.510
It didn't all actually
get spent.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:22.140
It was $182 billion committed
to bail out AIG.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.140
That's a lot of money, I think
that's the biggest bailout

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.613
anywhere, at any time.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.940
A lot of people are
angry about this.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:44.130
Part of this bailout came from
what we called TARP.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:47.460
This is the Troubled Asset
Relief Program, which was

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.300
created under the Bush
administration.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.060
And it was a proposal
of Treasury

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.420
Secretary Henry Paulson.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.650
It was initially
run by Paulson.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:02.480
But it was not just TARP.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.170
There was also loans from
the Federal Reserve.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.570
It was a complicated string
of things that were

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.040
done to bail out AIG.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.120
So, why did they do that?

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.500
Why did the government bail out
this insurance company?

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.620
The main reason why they did
so was their concern about

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.870
systemic risk.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.520
I'll come back to other
kinds of bailouts

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.900
of insurance companies.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.440
The problem was that AIG --

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.040
if it went under, all kinds
of things would go wrong.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.790
All kinds of things
would go wrong.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.750
All these insurance policies
that it wrote on people's

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:59.760
casualties, their travel
insurance, any of these

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.710
policies, would all now
be subject to failure.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.290
Because people who had these
insurances would find that the

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:10.032
company that they bought it
through was disappearing.

00:30:10.032 --> 00:30:12.590
But it would go on
even beyond that.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:16.560
Lots of other companies,
investment companies, banks,

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.330
would fail too, or may fail too,
because they're involved

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:27.170
in some kind of business
dealings with AIG, which would

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:31.230
now become part of the
AIG bankruptcy.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:36.340
If AIG failed, anybody who had
any business with AIG would be

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.530
starting to wonder, what's
this going to mean to me?

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:45.480
AIG owes me money, what's
going to happen?

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.370
And so, there was a worry that
it would destroy the whole

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.070
financial system.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:54.080
This was big enough to cause
everybody to pull back, and if

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.160
everybody pulls back, then
the business world stops.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.660
It would be like a stampede
for the exits.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.110
Everyone hears, AIG goes under,
and so many people do

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:07.320
business with AIG, they decided
it was intolerable.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.390
And so, the government came
up with the money,

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.980
massively and quickly.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.590
If you remember the story,
Henry Paulson, who was

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.080
Treasury Secretary, first
went to Congress

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.120
asking for a blank check.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.240
He didn't say to bail out AIG,
but that's what he did.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:28.110
He got sort of a blank check
from Congress, because Paulson

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.950
told the story that if we don't
do this, if we let the

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.560
company -- he didn't say AIG, he
actually asked for the TARP

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.810
money before the
AIG bailout --

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:40.560
but he said if we don't do
something to prevent a

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.380
collapse, we could have the
Great Depression again.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.730
Nobody liked to hear that, but
they believed him, and they

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.320
didn't know what else to do.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:56.780
And so, they allowed the TARP
money, and they allowed the

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.865
Federal Reserve to bail
out this company.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.100
Some people misunderstand what
this in fact means, though,

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.850
for the shareholders in AIG.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.190
The AIG shareholders lost almost
everything, because the

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:25.290
government arranged the bailout
in such a way that AIG

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.380
got practically wiped out.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:35.890
The government took preferred
shares in the company at a

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:41.540
very low price in exchange for
helping the company survive.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.450
And that diluted down the other
shareholders in the

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:49.030
company into a very
low status.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:54.500
The company lost over 90% of its
shareholder value, despite

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.920
this bailout.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:10.340
In July of 2009, AIG did
a 1-to-20 split.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.380
Remember, I told you about
splits before?

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.070
That's a reverse split.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:19.310
Usually, the stock goes up in
a company and the shares,

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.750
which originally sold for $30
a share, are now selling for

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.410
$100 a share.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.120
And they think, well that's too
high a price per share, so

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.000
let's do a three-for-one split,
and let's make every

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.060
share into three shares.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.070
That's the usual split story.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.710
This is going the other
way massively.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:40.820
They made every 20 shares
into one share.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.620
So, if you look at the price
recently, it's been something

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.960
like $30 to $40 dollars
a share.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.030
That's what we do on the stock
exchange, we always like to

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.640
keep it, it's an American
tradition.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.020
Not so much true in other
countries, they have different

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:58.710
traditions about what is the
preferred price about a stock.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.350
So, AIG lost --

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:04.690
the shareholders lost just
about everything.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:13.560
So, the public anger about a
bailout of AIG is really a

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.620
little bit inappropriate,
because they lost almost

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.219
everything.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.310
They could've lost everything.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.820
This company did not
fail, it was

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.790
bailed out and it survived.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.550
But it lost almost everything.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.570
I think the real anger is not
anger about the shareholders

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.510
of AIG, who lost almost
everything.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.969
The real anger is that the
business partners of AIG

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.540
didn't lose anything, notably
Goldman Sachs, which was a

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:47.160
major partner taking the other
side of contracts with AIG.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.090
It didn't lose a penny,
all right?

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.880
But, of course, Goldman Sachs
was not being bailed out.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.370
It was not in danger.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:03.140
The government didn't know what
to do with AIG, because

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.030
it felt that it was such a big
company doing so many things

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.930
that if we let them
fail, who knows,

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.860
Goldman Sachs might fail.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.790
The government didn't know,
they didn't know whether

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:17.870
Goldman Sachs might fail.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.640
Because it didn't have the
information, because the

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.170
regulators had not collected
such information.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.030
So, they decided the only
thing they could do

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:32.250
responsibly was to keep AIG
alive, somehow alive, as an

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.620
insurance company.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:38.890
Maybe, they lose almost all
of their value to the

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.260
shareholders, but
they keep going.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.110
So, that's what happened.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:48.820
And AIG continues to this day.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.390
It survived after the bailout.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:56.050
Now, I wanted to talk about
something else that many of

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:01.580
you may not know about
insurance companies.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:08.030
Mainly, that we do have
something like deposit

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.800
insurance for insurance
companies.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.880
You know, when you go into a
bank, there will be a little

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.130
sign saying FDIC Insured?

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.220
Do you notice that when
you go into a bank?

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.090
They're required to post that.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.000
Bank accounts are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:39.820
Corporation to a limit,
$250,000 now.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:44.080
It's only for relatively small
savers, because $250,000 is

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.770
not big time, a lot of money.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.260
We don't want innocent people
who walk into a bank and put

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.430
their money there to
lose their money.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.030
So, you wonder about
insurance.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:59.750
Do we have something like
that for insurance?

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.150
Yes we do.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:08.480
We have state insurance
guarantee funds that protect

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.730
insurance companies.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.590
They're not as old, though.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:22.930
The oldest insurance guarantee
fund is from 1941, and that's

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.740
in New York.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:31.880
And this fund was the first, but
now virtually every state

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.290
in the United States
has these funds.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.320
Connecticut got its
first insurance

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:45.390
guarantee fund in 1972.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:51.290
So, these are supposed to
protect you, as an individual,

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:57.120
if you take out an insurance
policy, and then your

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:02.390
insurance company, like
AIG, blows up.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.870
So, then you wonder, well, why
didn't the insurance guarantee

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.330
fund handle AIG?

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.360
Any idea where the answer is?

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.300
Why did we need the
special bailout?

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.700
Well, maybe the answer
is obvious.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.640
The insurance guarantee fund,
like the FDIC, is to protect

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.820
the little guy, right?

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.360
AIG was way too big for these
state insurance funds.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.570
There's a limit to how much you
can collect from a state

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:35.480
insurance fund if your insurance
company goes under,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:41.190
and in New York it's
$500,000, and in

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.670
Connecticut it's the same.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:45.110
These are two of the most
generous states.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:49.140
Typically, in a state in the
United States, you only

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.240
collect $300,000 maximum.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.420
That may sound like a lot of
money to you, but think of it

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.760
this way: Suppose you bought
a life insurance

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.370
policy for your family.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:02.480
What would you typically buy?

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.680
Ever thought about it?

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.430
Well, you have two children.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.882
You're thinking of sending them
both to Yale, or some

00:39:09.882 --> 00:39:12.430
place like that.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.520
It's going to cost you like
$500,000 right there, just

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.080
sending them to college.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:25.040
So, if that's all you get in
your insurance, it's not big.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.700
So, these are small, they don't
guarantee you enough.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.080
There's another thing about,
at least I know about the

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.090
Connecticut insurance guarantee
fund, and that is

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:38.750
that you can't play the trick
that you do with the Federal

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.540
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.630
The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation insures bank

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.590
accounts for $250,000,
all right?

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.050
But all you do is, you
put your money over

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.990
many different banks.

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.530
So, if you've got $2.5 million,
you put it in 10

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.990
different banks.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:57.190
The FDIC will insure every one
of those, so you can insure

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.820
$2.5 million.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:05.200
But the Connecticut insurance
guarantee fund won't do that,

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.480
they'll limit you to $500,000,
no matter how many different

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.980
policies you got.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.400
There's another important
difference between deposit

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.630
insurance and banks and state
insurance guarantee funds, at

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.240
least in Connecticut.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.860
I know Connecticut does not
allow an insurance company to

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.530
advertise that they're
insured.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.010
It's quite the opposite with
deposit insurance, where the

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:37.680
FDIC requires that they post
that they're insured.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.790
So, that's, why you don't
hear about this.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.790
But there's a fundamental lesson
that I'm trying to get

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:50.950
to with all of this, and that
is that you have to look at

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.350
the insurance company that
you buy insurance from.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:58.670
It's still a wild world out
there in the sense that if you

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.710
buy insurance from an insurance
company that goes

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:04.610
under, well, you're protected
up to $500,000, but

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.030
beyond that, not.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.160
And you're supposed
to watch out.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.380
Now, we also have state
insurance regulators who are

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.430
supposed to watch out that
insurance companies are good,

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.710
but they won't make
good on you.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.900
So, we have a Connecticut
Insurance Department, for

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.630
example, which regulates
insurance companies.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.360
Now, another interesting thing
about insurance that separates

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:34.430
it from finance is that
insurance is done by the state

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.010
government.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.990
It's regulated and the guarantee
funds are state.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.960
The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation is a federal --

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.860
it's a national insurance
program.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:51.570
But insurance is done entirely
by the state.

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.100
This makes it difficult to do
business as an insurance

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.850
company, because you have 50
different regulators in the

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:58.580
United States.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.010
The United States is
a particularly

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:04.975
difficult place to handle.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:27.270
That's because we have the
McCarren-Ferguson Act in 1945,

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:32.960
which specifies that insurance
regulation is entirely for the

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.210
state governments.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.660
So, in the United States
regulation of insurance is

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.840
divided up across 50 different
states, which

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.160
makes it very difficult.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.290
It's very difficult, because
that's a lot of different

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.280
regulators to deal with.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:01.510
One thing that we have is
something called the National

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.890
Association of Insurance
Commissioners.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.690
It's not a government
organization, it's an

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:20.380
association without any
constitutional or any

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.090
government definition.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:24.600
The NAIC.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.870
But what it does, is it brings
representatives from the

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.980
different state governments and
they meet together, and

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.170
they decide on model legislation
that each state

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:42.310
government could adopt to
allow insurance to be

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:45.590
standardized across different
state governments.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:52.530
Otherwise, we'd have total
chaos in our insurance

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:53.780
regulation.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:03.350
You might be aware that under
the Dodd-Frank Act, which is

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:13.060
the major legislation that
was passed in 2010 --

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:19.340
The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new
federal insurance office.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.870
So, it sounds like the federal
government in the United

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:34.000
States is getting
into insurance.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.530
But, in fact, no it's not.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:39.320
The federal government doesn't
have any real involvement in

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.620
the insurance industry,
it's all regulated

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.870
at the state level.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.530
Well, it does have an
involvement in a sense,

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.060
because here's how it's going
to work apparently.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:59.130
The Federal Insurance Office
was created to look at

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:05.410
systemic risk of insurance,
because the AIG problem turned

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:09.700
out to be a federal problem,
because it was so massive.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.010
The federal government
doesn't want AIG

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.210
bailouts to happen again.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:20.770
So, the proposal was made by a
number of people, well, why

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:23.950
don't we regulate insurance
at the national level?

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:27.520
Other countries do that,
why don't we do that?

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.720
But the American tradition is
too strong to make such a

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.030
major change.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:41.170
So, what the Dodd-Frank
Act did, is it

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.130
created this new office.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:47.160
And the Federal Insurance Office
is going to collect

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:52.570
information about insurance
companies in order to discover

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:58.410
which of them are proposing the
kind of risk that AIG did,

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.110
a risk that could bring
down the whole system.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.460
So again, they're just looking
at the problem that I

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.470
highlighted at the beginning,
that the whole insurance model

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.940
assumes independence of risk,
some kind of independence of

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.360
risk, so that pooling occurs.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.090
But if it's not really
independent, then pooling

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.970
isn't going to be successful.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.850
So, here's what the Federal
Insurance Office does -- what

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:24.650
it will do, it hasn't done
anything yet, I suppose.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:29.810
It will monitor insurance
companies for

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.410
posing systemic risks.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.330
And if it decides that there
is a systemic risk, another

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:41.360
AIG brewing, then this office
can recommend to another

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:49.790
agency called the Financial
Stability Oversight

00:46:49.790 --> 00:47:01.660
Commission, created
by Dodd-Frank --

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:08.590
people call it F-SOC.

00:47:12.092 --> 00:47:16.810
It can recommend that the
insurance company be

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:25.510
designated as a threat to the
system of the United States.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:30.400
In that extreme case, it would
be put under the regulation of

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.180
the Federal Reserve Board, and
it would be handled in

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:41.120
bankruptcy by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:47.690
So, what Dodd-Frank has done,
it left the state-regulated

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:53.710
insurance companies unchanged,
except as

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.810
regards to systemic risks.

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.620
And they have set up a procedure
that would get the

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.550
federal government involved if
the Federal Insurance Office

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:08.210
concludes that a systemic
risk is happening.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:13.390
And the Dodd-Frank Act says very
clearly, we will not bail

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.930
out another insurance company
the way we did AIG.

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:23.640
We can get back into the details
of what might happen

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.720
in another AIG circumstance,
but it's not supposed to be

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.530
the same thing.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:34.980
Well, I wanted to mention that
there are other countries that

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:40.420
have insurance guarantee funds
like the insurance guarantee

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.980
funds that I mentioned
in regards to

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.280
Connecticut and New York.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:56.750
In many cases, they're newer and
they're not as effective.

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.080
So, I wanted to mention --

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:09.910
in the country of China, they
have just created the China

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:11.505
Insurance Protection Fund.

00:49:15.264 --> 00:49:27.840
It's like one of our state
guarantee funds,

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.170
but it has a limit.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:39.130
The amount that it will insure
is limited to CNY 50,000, or

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:46.250
about $6,000.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:50.700
It's $500,000 in the
United States.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.890
At least, they've got it now.

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:57.890
Until 2008, there wasn't
even any such

00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.260
insurance guarantee fund.

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:13.480
So anyway, the Fabozzi et al.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.575
book talks about various kinds
of insurance, and I was going

00:50:16.575 --> 00:50:20.690
to say something about the
types of insurance.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:26.540
The biggest category of
insurance privately offered is

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:31.350
life insurance, which in 2009
was almost $5 trillion.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:38.340
Privately offered health
insurance is actually smaller

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.460
than that, and property and
casualty insurance is only

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.600
about $1.3 trillion.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.240
Nonetheless, these are
big industries.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.120
You go through Fabozzi et al.,
and it will describe the

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.750
different types of
life insurance.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:56.570
There's term insurance, which
insures you for a

00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:00.270
certain term of time.

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:02.970
It's terminates after one
year, but is typically

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.950
automatically renewable.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:11.190
Then there's whole life, which
gives you insurance over a

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:16.000
long time interval and builds
cash value over the years.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.110
There's other types -- there's
variable life, which has no

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.900
guaranteed cash value, but
invests in an account for you.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:31.800
And the insurance, then, has
an uncertain payout.

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.350
Life insurance goes back to the
1600s, as I was saying,

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:47.230
because that was the most
important kind of insurance.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:49.030
The most important risk
that people faced was

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:50.280
the death of a parent.

00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:00.740
I mentioned that the first
multinational corporation and

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.430
the first stock exchange
appeared in the 1600s, the

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.690
same time as the first insurance
policies appeared.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:13.550
The first health insurance
policy was proposed in 1694 by

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:15.530
Elder Chamberlain.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.450
And the first U.S. health
insurance plan was the

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:22.900
Franklin Health Insurance
Company of Massachusetts,

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.670
which started in 1850.

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:28.860
I want to talk a little bit
about health insurance,

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:34.180
because it's something that has
been an important problem.

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.100
Many countries have
adopted national

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.950
health insurance plans.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.990
The government has come in,
fundamentally, and has

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.442
actually required insurance
for everyone.

00:52:48.442 --> 00:52:52.070
The government has not allowed
insurance to precede along

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:53.325
private lines.

00:52:53.325 --> 00:52:57.050
The United States, however, has
had a tradition of more

00:52:57.050 --> 00:53:00.040
private, or free enterprise,
and has tried merely to

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.950
regulate insurance and
not to impose it as

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:05.690
a government plan.

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.270
But there have been problems in
the United States, in that

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:11.790
many people do not
get insurance.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:20.050
Because if you don't have a
government plan on insurance,

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.860
you start to deal with problems
of moral hazard or

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.560
selection bias that
encourage many

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.620
people not to buy insurance.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.420
If you think that the people who
buy health insurance are

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.890
the sick ones, and you're
not sick, you're not

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.140
going to buy insurance.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.060
Moreover, there were
other problems of

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.610
moral hazard with insurance.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:43.920
One problem was, if you have a
private health insurance plan,

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.040
the doctors have, maybe, an
incentive to milk the

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.110
insurance company, right?

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:50.740
They can order too
many procedures.

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.400
Doctors don't care about
you, the patient,

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.800
living a long time.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.210
They just have an incentive to
do a lot of procedures, so

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:00.990
they won't do preventative
medicine to protect your life

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.770
-- they will, if they have moral
character -- but the

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:06.770
financial incentives
are wrong.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:10.260
So, the government in the
United States has tried

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:15.060
repeatedly to do things that
would improve this problem.

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.700
But see, this is what
I'm getting back

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.700
in the initial point.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:25.040
Designing insurance is a
matter of invention.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.840
We have to figure out some
system that incentivizes

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:30.940
doctors right, and incentivizes

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.770
people to sign up --

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:38.150
both sick people and healthy
people all sign up --

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:39.260
and things are done right.

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.930
So, how do we get that?

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:46.170
I was going to give some
milestones in this.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.330
One was the HMO Act.

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:49.990
The government is always
getting involved

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:51.280
and trying to --

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:55.060
this is 1973.

00:54:55.060 --> 00:55:00.840
HMO stands for health
maintenance organization.

00:55:03.505 --> 00:55:08.470
A health maintenance
organization is an insurance

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:15.680
plan that tries to deal with
the moral hazard problem.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.650
Doctors are paid salaries,
they're not paid for

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:22.190
procedures.

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:27.540
So, doctors are employees of
the HMO and they have no

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:30.780
incentive to give you an
operation that you don't need,

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.480
because their pay won't go up.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:39.210
The HMO Act of 1973 required
employers with 25 or more

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:43.370
employees to offer their
employees a federally

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:46.430
certified HMO Plan.

00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:55.310
One of the first HMOs --

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:58.640
I'll say this, because you know
about them -- was the

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.430
Yale Health Plan.

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:06.580
Actually, the Yale Health
Plan dates to --

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.650
I'll say YHP for Yale
Health Plan --

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:10.840
1971.

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:16.460
It actually got started
before the HMO Act.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.780
That's because people here at
Yale were thinking along the

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.750
same -- there was talk already
about the importance of

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.960
preventive medicine.

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.780
And Charles Taylor,
who was the Yale

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:30.530
provost, liked the idea.

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:33.110
It was being talked about in
Congress, but Yale didn't even

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:35.050
wait for the government
to require it,

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:37.830
we did it in advance.

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:43.280
So, quoting Taylor: "Social
responsibility of the

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.280
university extends to the
pioneering and the

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.130
demonstration of improved
methods for the provision of

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:55.350
health services to population
groups." The concept is that

00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:57.020
it was a Yale community.

00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.540
Everyone at Yale belongs -- or
has the option of belonging --

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:13.130
and you have a primary care
person there, whose

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:17.210
instruction is to preserve
your long-term health.

00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:23.370
Another milestone was the
Emergency Medical Treatment

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:36.620
and Active Labor Act
in 1986, or EMTALA.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:39.120
See, so many people in the
United States have no health

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.490
insurance, and it's because of
this problem I'm telling you

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:44.800
about, the moral hazard
problem, the

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.400
selection bias problem.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.000
People say, I'm not going to
buy it, it's too expensive

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.480
because I'm not sick.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.230
That defeats the
whole concept.

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:56.060
You're supposed to buy whether
you're sick or not.

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.050
So, we had so many people that
didn't have insurance, so what

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:06.220
would happen when they got
hit by a bus, they're

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.620
lying on the street?

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.710
Well, people would bring them
into the hospital and,

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:14.040
typically, hospitals would sew
them up and take care of them.

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:18.590
But they often gave really bad
service, because they weren't

00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:22.310
getting paid for this person.

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:28.880
So, what the EMTALA did in 1986,
is it requires hospitals

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.770
to take you in and
take care of you.

00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:35.170
Anyone needing emergency
treatment, according to

00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:39.160
EMTALA, can go to any hospital
with an emergency room and be

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.760
taken care of.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:42.760
So, that's the law.

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:46.450
So, we do have national health
insurance in that sense.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:50.010
This is an example of what's
called an unfunded mandate.

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:52.790
The government just says the
hospitals have to do it.

00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:54.240
How do they pay for it?

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.180
Well, that's their problem.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.380
The government isn't offering
them any money to do it.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.500
So, what the hospitals
do, is they say, OK.

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.780
Suppose you get hit by a bus.

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.560
If you can't talk, they
just treat you.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.020
If you can talk, they're in
there asking you to sign

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:15.260
papers promising to pay
for it eventually.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.810
So, you go deeply into debt.

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:19.730
That's one thing that happens.

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:22.860
So, EMTALA didn't really solve
the health problem.

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:27.660
We still have the selection bias
problem preventing people

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:28.910
from signing up.

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:40.910
The HMO Act was supposed to
put us all -- did I spell

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.195
maintenance right?

00:59:41.195 --> 00:59:42.570
I spelled this wrong.

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:53.410
The HMO Act was supposed to
get us all into HMOs.

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:55.770
Well, you are all in an HMO,
because you're part of a

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.240
community that gives
it to you.

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:03.320
But there's over 40 million
uninsured Americans, not even

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.260
on any insurance plan.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.310
And people who don't have any
health insurance miss

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:12.930
diagnostic procedures, they get
diabetes, they get high

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.380
blood pressure.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.200
And so, they're not treated
until they're flat out and

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.630
they're in the emergency room.

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:21.360
And that's not the way to
handle these conditions.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.690
So, it's really not good
what has happened.

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:31.660
But that brings us to the 2010
health care acts that were

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.080
created by President Obama.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.310
There's actually two of them,
I won't write their names.

01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:50.940
So, in 2010, the U.S. government
passed a landmark

01:00:50.940 --> 01:01:00.080
pair of bills that were
addressed to solving the

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.670
selection bias and moral hazard
problems and reducing

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:08.730
the number of people who are
uninsured dramatically.

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.786
So, this is what the
government did.

01:01:14.695 --> 01:01:16.870
It hasn't happened yet,
but the procedures are

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:18.410
there to set it up.

01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:26.990
They're creating new insurance
exchanges that will offer

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:34.995
insurance to be purchased
by the general public.

01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:36.800
And they're not going to
require you to buy the

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.670
insurance, they're going
to put a tax penalty

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.200
on you if you don't.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.000
You don't have to buy insurance,
because you're a

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.030
student here, and you've
got insurance.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.110
But suppose you're just out
there in the world, not

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:54.540
affiliated with any insurance
plan, then you'll actually

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.710
have to pay a penalty
of something like

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:59.820
$700 year if you don't.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:02.860
So the idea is, you pretty
much are going to do it,

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.850
because you don't want
to pay the penalty.

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:10.440
That solves the selection bias
problem, because by forcing

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:13.990
everyone to sign up, insurance
companies no longer have the

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:16.020
problem that only sick
people sign up.

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:20.410
Everyone signs up, so they can
lower their premiums, because

01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:23.440
it doesn't cost them as much
per person when they've got

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.190
healthy people now.

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:28.410
So, there's a penalty for
individuals that are not

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:32.720
buying insurance, and there's a
penalty for companies who do

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.950
not buy insurance for
their employees.

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.890
That's another part of the
selection bias problem.

01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:41.570
So, we get almost everyone
covered by insurance, and that

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:44.710
will bring the cost down.

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:48.620
Moreover, insurance companies
that are on the new insurance

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:54.860
exchanges cannot say no for
pre-existing conditions.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:57.320
This happens all the time now.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.500
If you already are sick, an
insurance company is going to

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.600
offer you a really high --

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.340
they'll say, we'll insure you,
but we'll demand a really high

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.560
monthly premium.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:14.980
So you say, I can't afford that,
because it doesn't work.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.230
Now, that won't happen.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:23.830
I wanted to conclude with some
thoughts about the insurance

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.303
industry and where it's going.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.930
It seems painfully slow to me.

01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:35.080
I talked about insurance being
invented 1600s, that's 400

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:39.220
years ago, and still we have
over 40 million Americans with

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.890
no health insurance.

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:44.240
Pretty obvious that we should
have it, but we have problems

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.110
making it work.

01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:54.000
And we still have problems,
especially in

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.250
less developed countries.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:04.640
Let me mention another insurable
risk, which was

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.960
being taken care
of very badly.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.350
You know that last year,
there was a terrible

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.930
earthquake in Haiti.

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:18.470
The loss of life in Haiti, and
the loss of damages, was

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:19.745
generally not insured.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.610
There were efforts to
get more insurance

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:34.170
to Caribbean countries.

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:40.060
In 2007, the Caribbean
Catastrophe Risk Insurance

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:46.870
Facility was trying to promote
insurance for the Caribbean

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:50.000
region, but it had reached only
$8 million dollars in

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.980
insurance as of the
Haiti earthquake.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:57.080
What that meant is that
most buildings were

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.370
not insured in Haiti.

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.510
And that meant not only that
people couldn't collect when

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:04.240
the building collapsed, but it
also meant that the building

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:08.920
really collapsed, because
there were no insurance

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.780
companies imposing building
codes and standards.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.310
If an insurance company is
bearing the risk, they will

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:18.260
then go in and make sure that
the building is constructed

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:22.320
right, and so the risk is
dealt with properly.

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:30.590
In contrast, a similar
catastrophe in the United

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:37.260
States was the Hurricane
Katrina, which destroyed much

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.300
of the city of New Orleans.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:44.940
But in contrast, many, or most
people in New Orleans had

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.870
insurance on their house.

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.360
And studies show that the
insurance -- while there were

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.450
complaints --

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:52.070
the insurance actually worked.

01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:54.960
And most people --

01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:00.460
I think about 200,000 homes
were severely damaged, and

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:05.370
payment was about $40,000
per home.

01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:08.090
Still, there were problems
in New Orleans.

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:11.080
When New Orleans came, there
were two kinds of risk.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.400
One was wind damage and the
other one was flood damage.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.820
I was saying earlier that an
insurance policy tries to

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:24.210
define the loss very carefully
and precisely, because it's

01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:26.640
going to end up costing the
insurance company billions of

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.840
dollars, they got to get
it exactly right.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.390
But they had different coverage
for wind loss and

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.455
flood loss.

01:06:34.455 --> 01:06:38.460
Now the problem is, when you
have a hurricane, which is it?

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.990
What was the problem that
hit your house?

01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:42.700
Because it was both
wind and flood.

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:48.460
So, there was wrangling
over the definition.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.160
Another problem --

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.220
I'm almost done here --

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.790
I just wanted to talk about
another kind of risk, that

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:59.530
worries us a great deal, that
tends not to be covered well

01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:02.410
by a traditional insurance
company.

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:05.630
And that's terrorism risk.

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:09.290
Most insurance policies
traditionally have excluded

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:12.480
acts of war or terrorism
from coverage.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.990
And they feel that they have to
exclude it, because those

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.505
are correlated risks, right?

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.380
If there's a war, it's
going to cause --

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:27.940
there are not independent
probabilities of damage.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.760
And so, insurance companies
have excluded it.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.500
But it turns out, these are
some of the risks that we

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.025
worry most about.

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:46.250
So, what we had in the United
States was TRIA, which was the

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:50.610
Terrorism Risk Insurance
Act in 2002.

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:54.380
It started out in 2002,
but it's been renewed.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:05.510
The act requires insurance to
offer terrorism insurance, but

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:09.390
it also agrees that the
government will pay some of

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:12.979
the amount of losses if there
is a major national

01:08:12.979 --> 01:08:13.759
catastrophe.

01:08:13.759 --> 01:08:24.840
So, it becomes a
government-funded --

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.439
in the case of a huge, let's
say, systemic problem caused

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:32.500
by a massive increase in
terrorism, the government will

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.810
take up the major losses.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.649
So, that is another important
step, that we now have

01:08:38.649 --> 01:08:40.819
insurance against terrorism.

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:42.930
It was something that had been
excluded because of the

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:44.700
systemic problem.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:48.050
The last thing I'll mention
is catastrophe bonds.

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:53.830
This is an insurance-like
institution that has been

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:55.080
developing slowly.

01:08:58.027 --> 01:09:04.470
A catastrophe bond is a bond
that is used to finance the

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:06.670
management of large risks.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:07.689
I'll give you an example.

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:14.109
The Mexican government, in May
of 2006, issued bonds totaling

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:20.729
$160 billion, which need to be
repaid only if Mexico does not

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:24.479
have a major earthquake.

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:28.399
So, if you invest in Mexican
catastrophe bonds, or cat

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:34.220
bonds, they're called, then you
are helping Mexico against

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.670
a systemic, big risk.

01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:40.109
If Mexico City is hit by another
earthquake like the

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:43.420
one that they had -- it was
about 20 years ago --

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.580
it would be a huge
cost to Mexico.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:56.070
The Mexican government is not
big enough to manage such a

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.400
risk effectively.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.890
It's better if the risk
is spread out

01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:01.280
over the whole world.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.070
So, this is an example of a
kind of risk management

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:10.610
contract that extends the scope
of insurance, actually

01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:12.830
making it more financial.

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:15.920
These bonds are actually sold
and put into portfolios, and

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.410
it doesn't look like
insurance.

01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:25.320
It looks like a bond that deals
with the insurance risk

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.910
in a financial way.

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:35.070
I'm about done, let me just
say that the insurance

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:39.060
industry manages important risks
that matter to our life.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:45.450
Risks to our health, to our
children, to our businesses,

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.870
to things that we do.

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:50.190
And it still suffers
from various

01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:52.850
imperfections that we can see.

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:55.270
It seems like we're just dealing
with some of the

01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:58.530
problems. I mention these
new innovations.

01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:04.020
But there are still problems in
the insurance industries.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.650
I could just mention
a few of them.

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:10.350
One of them is that we don't
well-insure against changes in

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.830
probabilities.

01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:16.830
So for example, recently in
the American South, for

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:20.350
unknown reasons, there's been
a growing mold problem.

01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:26.680
The funguses are growing in
houses, and it can damage the

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.770
house and it has to
be torn down.

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:31.600
So, the probability of this
risk is going up.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.350
So, insurance companies are
raising their rates reflecting

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:36.430
the probability, but there
was no insurance

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:38.540
against raising the rates.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:41.880
Also, hurricane risk seems
to be going up, right?

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.980
Because of global warming,
hurricane risk is going up.

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:49.330
So, insurance companies have
been raising their insurance

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:51.210
premiums for that reason.

01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:58.220
But that is not a risk that's
insured against. So, if you

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.650
buy a house down in Florida and
then hurricanes get much

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.710
worse, you might not
be able to afford

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:04.710
your insurance policy.

01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:07.070
We also have problems that
insurance policies are not

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.920
indexed to inflation.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.620
We have life annuities --

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.640
I haven't really discussed
those, but they're policies

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.280
that would benefit from
inflation indexation.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.410
So, these are still
some examples.

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:23.010
I think that the insurance
industry is a -- let me just

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:26.810
conclude with this thought --
it's like any other industry.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:30.040
It deals with very important,
real problems that require

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.195
technological solutions.

01:12:31.195 --> 01:12:37.210
The solutions are difficult and
we are slowly moving ahead

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:42.160
and improving our ability to
deal with these problems. But

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.330
it's a science, it's a
technology, it's got a long

01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:46.230
ways to go.

01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:49.600
And I'm predicting that over
your careers, in the next half

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.690
century or more, we'll see a
lot of advances, a lot of

01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:57.410
changes, in the insurance
industry, like the changes I

01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:59.080
talked about here.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.110
And these changes will
lead to much better

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.170
lives for all of us.

01:13:05.170 --> 01:13:07.524
So, I'm talking about efficient
markets next time

01:13:07.524 --> 01:13:07.640
[correction: after the guest
lecture by David Swensen],

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.670
which is a favorite
topic of mine.

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.040
It's about why you can't
beat the market.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.050
Or maybe you can.

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:16.930
That's what I like about it.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.688
Professor John Rogers:
For a vast number of

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:07.404
complicated reasons,
Milton has invited for 350

00:00:07.404 --> 00:00:11.122
years now a uniquely violent --
and I do think it's a violent --

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:14.960
response to the particular
question of his value as a poet.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.816
And the violence,
I think, of this reaction is

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:21.308
due in large part to our
tendency to think of Milton and

00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:24.800
of Milton's work in terms of the
category of power.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.062
So I've given this first
lecture a title,

00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:29.721
the title being "Milton,
Power, and the Power of

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.329
Milton,"
because any introduction to

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.117
Milton has to confront the
long-standing conviction in

00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:40.620
English letters of Milton's
power or his strength as a poet.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.351
It's practically impossible to
begin a reading of Milton

00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:47.540
without the burden of
innumerable prejudices and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.130
preconceptions.
Milton's reputation always

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.487
precedes him.
And in fact that's always been

00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:55.802
the case even in his lifetime.
Even if we've heard of nothing

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:58.420
of Milton the poet or nothing of
Milton the man,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.167
we're certainly,
of course, likely to have heard

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:04.500
of Adam and Eve and of the story
of the Garden of Eden,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.051
and so it's especially
difficult to read Paradise

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:12.298
Lost without bringing to it
some sense of the power of the

00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:15.826
religious problems,
the theological and ethical

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:19.966
problems, that that story seems
so powerfully to set out to

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.891
address.Now readers of
English literature talk about

00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:27.959
Milton very differently from the
way they talk about other

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.201
writers.
Historically,

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:35.065
it has not been pleasure or wit
or beauty that has been

00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:39.750
associated with the experience
of reading Milton.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.401
Those are the categories of
value that we tend to associate

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:46.550
or to affiliate with our other
favorite writers,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.073
writers as diverse as
Shakespeare and Virginia Woolf,

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:55.678
for example.
But in our collective cultural

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:58.433
consciousness,
if there is a such thing,

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:02.671
whether we like him or not we
tend to think of John Milton as

00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.496
powerful.
And the reasons for this

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:10.241
coupling of the name Milton and
of this idea or the metaphor of

00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:13.664
power,
I think, are worth looking in

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:19.229
to.Power is a conceptual
category that Milton brooded on

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:23.189
and cultivated his entire
writing life.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.142
From a very early age,
Milton nursed the image of

00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:31.242
himself as a powerful poet.
In Milton we have a man who was

00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:34.389
able to state -- now just think
about this for a moment,

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.805
I take this to be an absolutely
remarkable fact -- we have in

00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:41.221
Milton a man who was able to
state categorically in his early

00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:44.522
twenties--so just a few years
older than you are now-- that

00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:47.995
the epic poem that he would not
even begin writing for another

00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:51.524
twenty-five years would become
an unforgettable work of English

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:55.851
literature.
Milton anticipated and lovingly

00:02:55.851 --> 00:03:01.711
invested all of his energy in
his future literary power and

00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:06.616
his future literary fame.
He anticipated this power much

00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:09.870
as his father,
a reasonably well-to-do banker,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.818
might have anticipated
long-term earnings from a

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.009
particularly risky business
venture.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.259
In Milton's case this
investment in power paid off.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.512
Milton would eventually come to
feel so comfortable with the

00:03:24.512 --> 00:03:27.764
mantle of power that he was able
to do much more than simply

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:31.182
rewrite the first books of the
Bible (which is of course one of

00:03:31.182 --> 00:03:34.599
the things that he accomplished
in Paradise Lost,

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.819
 and that is itself no
mean undertaking).

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.635
By the end of his life,
though, Milton would in effect

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:46.913
try to rewrite everything.
After he'd published all of his

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:50.437
major poems, he began publishing
a spate of works that attempted

00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:53.289
to re-create British culture
from the ground up.

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.550
He invented his own system of
philosophical logic.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.637
He published a treatise that he
had written earlier on grammar,

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:05.132
inventing his own system for
the understanding and the

00:04:05.132 --> 00:04:09.642
learning of the Latin language.
He wrote a long and detailed

00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:13.025
history of Britain,
attempting to create the

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:17.825
meaning of that little island
that he always assumed was God's

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:20.232
chosen nation.
And finally,

00:04:20.232 --> 00:04:24.259
and probably for Milton most
important, Milton wrote a

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.060
theology, inventing in effect
his own religion;

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.039
and Milton's Protestantism
looks like no one else's,

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.530
before or since.
There's a real sense,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.344
I think, in which Milton wanted
to re-create all of Western

00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:45.026
culture or to re-create all of
Western culture in his own

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:47.465
image.
Regardless of what we think of

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:50.953
the success of that example or
of the appeal of the attempt to

00:04:50.953 --> 00:04:53.227
do such a thing,
the amazing thing,

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:57.382
I think, is that Milton felt so
empowered even to embark on such

00:04:57.382 --> 00:05:00.893
an enormous project.
And readers of Milton ever

00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:05.494
since have had to confront not
just Milton's writing but this

00:05:05.494 --> 00:05:09.866
unspeakable sense of empowerment
that underlies just about

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:14.479
everything that Milton writes.
And so it seems to me that a

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.475
useful introduction to the
poetry of Milton would be a look

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:22.609
at some of the various types of
power that Milton imagines in

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:26.742
his work and some of the types
of power that literary history

00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:30.050
has tended to confer upon Milton
the man,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.391
the image of Milton the man,
and of Milton's

00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:37.043
writing.Now,
probably the form of power that

00:05:37.043 --> 00:05:41.316
we most readily associated with
John Milton involves his

00:05:41.316 --> 00:05:46.290
position at the dead center of
the English literary canon.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.357
This goes beyond questioning.
He's an object of worship by

00:05:51.357 --> 00:05:54.352
British and American
institutions of higher

00:05:54.352 --> 00:05:57.767
education,
and my guess is that few of you

00:05:57.767 --> 00:06:02.341
have failed to observe that it's
practically impossible to

00:06:02.341 --> 00:06:06.513
graduate from Yale with a
Bachelor of Arts in English

00:06:06.513 --> 00:06:11.970
without having read Paradise
Lost either in English 125,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:21.226
or DS Litm or,
in fact, in a course just like

00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:25.384
this one.
Those of you who are taking

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:29.689
this course because you have
to take one of the pre-1800s

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.843
and Milton is one of those,
you are more than entitled to

00:06:33.843 --> 00:06:36.310
ask why the poet,
this poet,

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.372
Milton, is exercising this
institutional sway over you as

00:06:40.372 --> 00:06:44.071
you go about choosing your
courses or perhaps as you

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:48.424
experience your courses in some
way as having been chosen for

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:52.704
you.It would be utterly
inadequate for us to account for

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:57.129
this institutional and surreal
institutional power that Milton

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.408
holds over us by stating blandly
that Milton is the greatest

00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:05.065
English poet.
That's the easy answer

00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:08.170
obviously, and of course it's
not untrue.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.564
But we can do better than that.
We can anatomize some of the

00:07:13.564 --> 00:07:17.625
forms of power that have been
most commonly attributed to this

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:21.355
greatest English poet.
There is first the

00:07:21.355 --> 00:07:27.894
understandable aesthetic power,
the power of the beauty of

00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:32.258
Milton's verse,
an aesthetic power that's often

00:07:32.258 --> 00:07:36.560
thought or felt to inhere
somewhere in the poetry itself.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.610
In fact for readers of
Paradise Lost,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.554
and this has been an
experience now for a few hundred

00:07:41.554 --> 00:07:44.247
years,
it does often seem as if there

00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:48.582
were some mysterious life force,
a pulsating through Milton's

00:07:48.582 --> 00:07:51.400
dense and driving lines of
unrhymed,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:57.014
iambic pentameter.
And now there's also the

00:07:57.014 --> 00:08:00.889
power that Milton himself
claimed was behind the poetry of

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:04.484
Paradise Lost.
Milton insisted--and it's

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:08.028
completely possible that he
might actually have

00:08:08.028 --> 00:08:12.574
believed--that God Himself was
responsible for composing the

00:08:12.574 --> 00:08:17.371
poetry of Paradise Lost,
that John Milton was merely

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:21.959
the conduit for God's first
serious attempt at an epic poem.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:26.116
And so in this perspective we
have an image of the awesome

00:08:26.116 --> 00:08:30.345
power of the Deity Himself
thundering away behind every jot

00:08:30.345 --> 00:08:34.210
and tittle of Milton's great
epic.But for Milton's

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.710
contemporaries in the
seventeenth century,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.669
Milton's power really wasn't at
all aesthetic or even religious

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:47.475
in nature.
Milton's power was primarily

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:53.379
seen as social and political and
cultural.

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:56.640
This is a wildly anachronistic
use of terms,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.976
but there's nonetheless a lot
of sense of it:

00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:04.147
Milton was essentially a
left-wing political radical and

00:09:04.147 --> 00:09:08.772
it was widely feared by his more
timid contemporaries that his

00:09:08.772 --> 00:09:13.549
writings would seduce his
readers in to rejecting good,

00:09:13.549 --> 00:09:16.251
old-fashioned,
traditional religious and

00:09:16.251 --> 00:09:19.569
social values.
There was a lot of validity to

00:09:19.569 --> 00:09:25.330
that contemporary cultural fear.
Milton was a revolutionary.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.817
He was responsible for writing
the first justification for an

00:09:28.817 --> 00:09:31.549
armed rebellion against a
legitimate monarch,

00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:37.325
the first to publish such a
work in, essentially,

00:09:37.325 --> 00:09:41.184
all of Europe.
Milton actually wrote that it

00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:43.786
was the duty,
not just the right but the

00:09:43.786 --> 00:09:47.477
duty,
of a nation to rise up and

00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:54.158
dethrone through execution an
unjust, though legitimate,

00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:56.811
king.
Milton in fact was largely

00:09:56.811 --> 00:10:00.562
responsible in a cultural sense
for the fact that the armed

00:10:00.562 --> 00:10:02.889
rebellion of England's civil
war,

00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:07.659
what we think of as the Puritan
Revolution, actually led to the

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:12.045
execution by decapitation of
England's monarch Charles the

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:15.373
First in 1649.
And on top of all of this

00:10:15.373 --> 00:10:18.948
political revolution,
the political radicalism,

00:10:18.948 --> 00:10:23.535
Milton was one of the first
intellectuals in Europe to speak

00:10:23.535 --> 00:10:28.354
out in favor not only of divorce
-- Milton argued for the right

00:10:28.354 --> 00:10:32.551
to divorce on grounds of
incompatibility -- but also he

00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:36.205
argued in favor of the right to
plural marriage,

00:10:36.205 --> 00:10:40.515
polygamy.
He was branded as a radical and

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:44.870
dangerous debunker of
traditional Christian family

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.685
values.Now,
many of you know that Milton in

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:52.615
his later years was blind,
and the fact of his blindness

00:10:52.615 --> 00:10:57.259
was in his own day frequently
cited by contemporary preachers,

00:10:57.259 --> 00:11:00.148
men at the pulpit,
as an example of exactly how

00:11:00.148 --> 00:11:03.978
God punishes those who dare to
write against the king or those

00:11:03.978 --> 00:11:07.683
who dare to write against the
institution of marriage or the

00:11:07.683 --> 00:11:10.796
family.
And Milton's power for so many

00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:15.312
of these contemporaries was seen
as palpably destructive and

00:11:15.312 --> 00:11:18.927
truly frightening.
Obviously, it goes without

00:11:18.927 --> 00:11:23.328
saying that today the assessment
of Milton as some kind of

00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:28.116
imminent social threat or some
sort of social force in terms of

00:11:28.116 --> 00:11:32.903
the radical nature of political
power -- that has taken a sharp

00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:35.872
turn.
Milton is much more likely

00:11:35.872 --> 00:11:40.350
imagined to wield -- and if you
have any sense of what the

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:45.376
mythology surrounding Milton is,
you would have to agree with

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:50.255
this -- a socially conservative
power over his readers.In

00:11:50.255 --> 00:11:55.053
the debates ranging for the last
thirty years or so over the

00:11:55.053 --> 00:11:59.932
value of traditional pedagogy
and over the value of canonical

00:11:59.932 --> 00:12:03.323
reading lists,
Milton is always cited,

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:06.617
invariably cited,
as the canon's most stalwart

00:12:06.617 --> 00:12:11.009
representative of oppressive
religious and social values.

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:15.135
There's no question:
Milton is the dead white male

00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:19.429
poet par excellence in English
letters certainly,

00:12:19.429 --> 00:12:22.829
and his poetry works,
at least from this point of

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:26.299
view, to solidify those dead
white male values,

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:29.712
whatever those are,
in the unsuspecting minds of

00:12:29.712 --> 00:12:33.706
his readers, none of whom
obviously are dead and many of

00:12:33.706 --> 00:12:38.539
whom are neither white nor male.
Milton's power from this

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:43.812
perspective of the radical
cultural critique is really not

00:12:43.812 --> 00:12:48.899
so different from the power of
the late Jerry Falwell or

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:54.112
someone like Rush Limbaugh.
There is something insidious

00:12:54.112 --> 00:12:58.375
and culturally malicious and
powerful about the social

00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:03.363
conservatism of what is thought
to be his voice.Now this is

00:13:03.363 --> 00:13:08.190
the contemporary picture of John
Milton and this more or less

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.373
contemporary picture of Milton
as a powerful force of

00:13:12.373 --> 00:13:16.958
conservatism derives in large
part from the English writer

00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:23.893
Virginia Woolf,
who wrote about Milton during

00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:27.086
the 1920s.
It's Woolf's image that's

00:13:27.086 --> 00:13:30.179
probably the one that's most
firmly rooted in the minds of

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:33.166
Milton's readers today.
For Virginia Woolf,

00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:37.811
especially in A Room of
One's Own, the dead writer

00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:42.705
Milton exercises an active power
at the present moment as he

00:13:42.705 --> 00:13:47.516
forces his female readers to
accept their subordinate place

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:50.468
in society;
and the text of Milton,

00:13:50.468 --> 00:13:54.147
and especially of Paradise
Lost, therefore has to be

00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:59.007
seen as an active,
persistently malignant conveyor

00:13:59.007 --> 00:14:03.956
of patriarchal oppression.
Now, like all judgments of

00:14:03.956 --> 00:14:07.060
literary value and literary
power and force,

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.029
the twentieth-century feminist
evaluation of Milton,

00:14:11.029 --> 00:14:13.711
Virginia Woolf's,
has a complicated and long

00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:17.578
prehistory, and it's worth our
while to look briefly at some of

00:14:17.578 --> 00:14:21.133
the complicated steps by which
an evaluation like Virginia

00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:23.690
Woolf's actually comes in to
being.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.058
So let me take you back.
You can now look at your

00:14:28.058 --> 00:14:30.389
handouts.
Let me take you back to the

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:33.450
seventeenth century,
up to the very beginning of the

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.330
literary reception of John
Milton.Milton,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.924
who had died in 1674,
had established himself as a

00:14:40.924 --> 00:14:46.549
great English poet within twenty
or so years of his death.

00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:49.190
As early as the late
seventeenth century,

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:53.216
Milton had already entered what
we can think of as the English

00:14:53.216 --> 00:14:56.534
literary canon.
For many of his younger

00:14:56.534 --> 00:15:00.393
contemporaries,
he was a canonical authority

00:15:00.393 --> 00:15:03.629
whose wisdom,
whose mere opinions,

00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:08.309
could be cited as proof,
as some sort of indisputable

00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:12.080
evidence,
for one position or another And

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.768
an extraordinarily ambitious
poet like Milton naturally

00:15:16.768 --> 00:15:20.240
derived a great deal of
satisfaction,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.495
I'm convinced,
in his own lifetime,

00:15:22.495 --> 00:15:26.143
in anticipating just this kind
of posthumous respect and

00:15:26.143 --> 00:15:28.891
worship,
the fantasy of his fellow

00:15:28.891 --> 00:15:33.810
Englishmen quoting him as
an authority much as he himself

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.870
had for so many decades quoted
scripture.Now,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.463
one of the earliest -- and I
think this is a remarkable fact

00:15:41.463 --> 00:15:45.117
-- one of the earliest citations
of Paradise Lost that

00:15:45.117 --> 00:15:48.893
actually appears in print in the
seventeenth century comes from

00:15:48.893 --> 00:15:52.059
the proto-feminist writer Lady
Mary Chudleigh.

00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:56.580
Chudleigh dared to argue -- and
it's an amazing argument,

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.940
given the time -- in 1699
Chudleigh argued that a woman

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.622
could be considered and should
be considered as excellent a

00:16:05.622 --> 00:16:10.014
creature as a man,
that women might actually be as

00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:14.383
ontologically valuable as men.
And in making such a point,

00:16:14.383 --> 00:16:18.423
Chudleigh naturally had to
confront -- as writers have for

00:16:18.423 --> 00:16:22.393
millennia -- Chudleigh had to
confront the problem of the

00:16:22.393 --> 00:16:26.149
scriptural account of the
priority of the sexes,

00:16:26.149 --> 00:16:29.968
the suggestion that many
readers extract from the Book of

00:16:29.968 --> 00:16:34.059
Genesis in the Bible that the
initial creation of the male of

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:37.801
the species,
Adam, seems to establish the

00:16:37.801 --> 00:16:41.590
privileged rank of the entire
male sex.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.271
And so Chudleigh attempts to
demonstrate -- and this is the

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:48.888
passage at the top of the
handout -- Chudleigh attempts to

00:16:48.888 --> 00:16:51.998
demonstrate that the Genesis
story of Adam and Eve

00:16:51.998 --> 00:16:55.230
establishes no such thing.
She writes, 

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.233
Woman's being created
last will not be a very great

00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:02.879
argument to debase the dignity
of the female sex.

00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:06.380
If some of the men own this
[she continues]

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.942
'tis more likely to be true.
The great Milton,

00:17:09.942 --> 00:17:12.816
a grave author,
brings in Adam thus speaking to

00:17:12.816 --> 00:17:16.815
Eve in Paradise Lost [and
then she quotes Adam speaking to

00:17:16.815 --> 00:17:19.799
Eve],
"Oh, fairest of creation,

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:23.670
last and best of all God's
works."

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.856
The great Milton can be invoked
here because he has already been

00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:31.773
established as an authority.
He's already been established

00:17:31.773 --> 00:17:35.354
as a figure whose very word
possesses something like an

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:39.434
indisputable cultural power.
So as a very "grave author" --

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:43.414
and this is what Chudleigh is
implying -- Milton can tell us

00:17:43.414 --> 00:17:47.732
something potentially true about
the priority of the sexes.Of

00:17:47.732 --> 00:17:51.848
course--and you know this to be
the case from your own writing

00:17:51.848 --> 00:17:55.491
of papers in the English
department-- like any literary

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:59.809
critic who ever tried to write
an analysis of anything,

00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:03.411
Chudleigh has no choice but to
nudge the lines that she's

00:18:03.411 --> 00:18:06.898
quoting out of context.
It's been said that to quote

00:18:06.898 --> 00:18:09.716
anybody is necessarily to
misrepresent him,

00:18:09.716 --> 00:18:13.540
and this fact is obviously a
very good thing for Lady Mary

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.163
Chudleigh since Milton would
certainly not himself have

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:20.920
wanted to suggest that women are
superior to men.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.693
Milton, in fact,
soon goes on in Paradise

00:18:23.693 --> 00:18:27.500
Lost -- right after this
very passage that she cites,

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.058
Milton the narrator berates
Adam for his overvaluation of

00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:36.779
his wife through the character
of the Archangel Raphael.

00:18:36.779 --> 00:18:40.025
I think this is one of the
great ironies of English

00:18:40.025 --> 00:18:43.011
literary history,
certainly in the reception of

00:18:43.011 --> 00:18:46.328
the poet Milton,
that one of the very first

00:18:46.328 --> 00:18:50.675
published discussions of
Milton's epic attempts to enlist

00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:55.256
John Milton as a proponent of
feminism.Now we don't have

00:18:55.256 --> 00:18:59.991
to be overly concerned here with
what I take to be Chudleigh's

00:18:59.991 --> 00:19:04.650
generous oversight of Milton's
generally sexist bias.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.727
What's important for our
immediate purposes is her

00:19:07.727 --> 00:19:10.930
identification of Milton as a
cultural authority.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.265
He's a literary power,
a figure who could be called

00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:19.599
upon to supply the voice of
tradition in itself.

00:19:19.599 --> 00:19:24.231
He can be called upon in fact
exactly as he is by Lady Mary

00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:26.926
here.
He can be called upon to

00:19:26.926 --> 00:19:30.755
contradict scripture:
and it's this power to

00:19:30.755 --> 00:19:36.275
contradict the Word of God that
makes Milton a force than which

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:41.706
it's hard to imagine anything
more powerful.Now as you can

00:19:41.706 --> 00:19:46.449
see from the handout,
Milton is discussed in a very

00:19:46.449 --> 00:19:51.337
different manner a year later in
a work published by Mary Astell

00:19:51.337 --> 00:19:55.837
in 1700 and in an even more
remarkably feminist cry for the

00:19:55.837 --> 00:20:00.492
liberation of women from what
she describes and characterizes

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:05.849
as domestic oppression.
Astell writes the following: 

00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:09.907
Patience and submission
are the only comforts that are

00:20:09.907 --> 00:20:14.034
left to a poor people who groan
under tyranny unless they are

00:20:14.034 --> 00:20:18.936
strong enough to break the yoke.
Not Milton himself would cry up

00:20:18.936 --> 00:20:23.554
liberty to poor female slaves or
plead for the lawfulness or

00:20:23.554 --> 00:20:26.450
resisting a private
tyranny.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.163
So Milton for Astell is hardly
the embodiment of orthodoxy that

00:20:30.163 --> 00:20:34.078
he is for Lady Mary Chudleigh.
For Astell, Milton remains the

00:20:34.078 --> 00:20:38.208
subversive revolutionary whose
treatises against the tyranny of

00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:41.504
the Stuart monarchy,
whose treatises against the

00:20:41.504 --> 00:20:45.360
tyranny of Charles the First
established his reputation as a

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.775
liberator,
a liberator of all of the

00:20:47.775 --> 00:20:51.658
oppressed and enslaved citizens
of England, and that's Milton's

00:20:51.658 --> 00:20:55.331
rhetoric;
that rhetoric belongs to Milton

00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:57.490
himself.
But Astell resents,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.937
of course, Milton here,
and what she resents is the

00:21:00.937 --> 00:21:03.420
limitation of his
subversiveness.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.295
He refused to extend his
critique of tyranny in the

00:21:07.295 --> 00:21:11.867
political realm to a critique of
man's domestic tyranny over

00:21:11.867 --> 00:21:15.859
woman in the private realm,
in the domestic sphere.

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:18.016
It's as if Mary Astell were
saying, "Well,

00:21:18.016 --> 00:21:20.930
Milton was on the right track.
He simply didn't go far enough.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.104
He didn't extend the logic of
his position."Now it has to

00:21:25.104 --> 00:21:29.069
be said that Mary Astell's image
of Milton is probably the

00:21:29.069 --> 00:21:33.243
product of a much closer reading
of Paradise Lost than

00:21:33.243 --> 00:21:37.767
Lady Mary Chudleigh's was.
Astell certainly seems to have

00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:42.361
noticed Milton's notorious and,
of course, deplorable line in

00:21:42.361 --> 00:21:46.725
Paradise Lost about God's
creation of Adam and Eve:

00:21:46.725 --> 00:21:50.952
"He for God only,
she for God in him," Milton's

00:21:50.952 --> 00:21:55.599
narrator tells us of God's
creation of Adam and Eve.

00:21:55.599 --> 00:21:58.160
Mary Astell is clearly
responding to this.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.363
Her statement points to a
persistent worry,

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:05.405
and it's a worry that exists
even now in the twentieth

00:22:05.405 --> 00:22:08.990
century about the nature of
Milton's power.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:14.259
Is this guy a revolutionary or
is he a reactionary?

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:19.140
Astell distinguishes Milton's
cry against political tyranny

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.938
from her own critique,
her own cry against the

00:22:22.938 --> 00:22:26.803
patriarchal tyranny,
and in making this distinction

00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:30.745
she's exposing something that I
take to be extremely

00:22:30.745 --> 00:22:33.470
interesting.
She's exposing the

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.916
uncomfortable affinity between
two competing,

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:40.049
equally progressive social
movements.

00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:45.626
You'll see this phenomenon
manifest itself throughout your

00:22:45.626 --> 00:22:49.049
reading of Milton,
I'm convinced;

00:22:49.049 --> 00:22:51.595
and what we see here is the
strange proximity,

00:22:51.595 --> 00:22:54.309
and it's often a very
uncomfortable proximity,

00:22:54.309 --> 00:22:57.208
of Milton's rhetoric of
political liberation to the

00:22:57.208 --> 00:23:00.570
proto-feminist rhetoric of
domestic liberation that is just

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.527
beginning to emerge at the end
of the^( )seventeenth

00:23:03.527 --> 00:23:07.063
century.Now in the middle
years of the seventeenth century

00:23:07.063 --> 00:23:10.426
during the English revolution
that saw the execution of the

00:23:10.426 --> 00:23:13.846
king and saw the establishment
of a non-monarchic republican

00:23:13.846 --> 00:23:17.916
government,
Milton had practically invented

00:23:17.916 --> 00:23:21.800
the formal language,
the literary language,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.520
of insubordination.
He developed an entire

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.189
vocabulary, a rhetoric of
righteous disobedience,

00:23:30.189 --> 00:23:34.470
of resistance,
of protest and revolution.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.861
And I think it's a measure of
the power of Milton's

00:23:37.861 --> 00:23:41.796
anti-tyrannical language that it
can be used against Milton

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:44.527
himself.
A writer like Mary Astell can

00:23:44.527 --> 00:23:48.428
employ Milton's revolutionary
rhetoric to advance a cause to

00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:52.395
which John Milton himself would
of course have had difficulty

00:23:52.395 --> 00:23:55.777
subscribing;
a dead Milton could exercise a

00:23:55.777 --> 00:24:00.368
social power that had nothing
whatsoever to do with the living

00:24:00.368 --> 00:24:04.206
Milton's own social
views.Now we'll fast forward

00:24:04.206 --> 00:24:08.269
a couple of centuries and look
at Virginia Woolf.

00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:12.504
By the time we get to Woolf in
the early part of the twentieth

00:24:12.504 --> 00:24:16.460
century, Milton has come to be
associated with essentially

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.140
all of these ways of
thinking about power,

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.834
however contradictory they are.
He's the very voice of

00:24:25.834 --> 00:24:29.345
traditional wisdom for some,
as he was for Lady Mary

00:24:29.345 --> 00:24:32.625
Chudleigh.
And he's the voice of political

00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:36.779
subversiveness for others,
as he was for Mary Astell.

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:39.729
He's the friend of women
everywhere, at least for a few

00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:42.460
of his female readers in the
eighteenth century,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.305
and for many he's the very
embodiment of oppressive

00:24:46.305 --> 00:24:50.766
patriarchy.I mentioned
earlier that it's Virginia Woolf

00:24:50.766 --> 00:24:55.304
who's largely responsible for
our sense of Milton's identity

00:24:55.304 --> 00:24:59.150
as an oppressive patriarchal
literary voice,

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.782
but Virginia Woolf,
too, had inherited these

00:25:02.782 --> 00:25:07.935
contradictory ways of thinking
about Milton and about Milton's

00:25:07.935 --> 00:25:10.690
power.
And you can see from the

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.830
handout that in 1924,
Woolf is beginning to formulate

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:19.607
her dazzling feminist critique
of the masculine traditions --

00:25:19.607 --> 00:25:24.145
what she thinks of as the
masculine traditions of literary

00:25:24.145 --> 00:25:28.444
writing -- and she's not just
one of the first literary

00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:32.822
critics to reveal that most
famous writers have been men

00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:37.141
(everyone had already,
had always known that),

00:25:37.141 --> 00:25:41.334
but she's one of the first
literary critics to reveal that

00:25:41.334 --> 00:25:45.380
most famous writers have been
writing as men,

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.232
exerting the influence of their
sex (that's to use her language)

00:25:49.232 --> 00:25:52.780
in a manner that implicitly
glorifies their masculinity,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:26:00.069
implicitly glorifies all men.
But this is not so [she

00:26:00.069 --> 00:26:03.500
writes in 1924]
with Milton.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.025
There's [and this is Woolf's
amazing argument here]

00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:13.093
a small group of writers whose
work [and I'm quoting her]

00:26:13.093 --> 00:26:15.374
is pure,
uncontaminated,

00:26:15.374 --> 00:26:20.154
sexless as the angels are said
to be sexless and Milton is

00:26:20.154 --> 00:26:23.420
their leader [she tells
us].

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.848
Like Lady Mary Chudleigh,
Woolf holds up Milton as a

00:26:26.848 --> 00:26:30.179
powerful authority.
He's almost a mythological

00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:33.575
figure who can sanction,
who can authorize this

00:26:33.575 --> 00:26:38.079
revolution in women's writing
that Virginia Woolf is beginning

00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:42.434
to prophesy here early in the
twentieth century.But this

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:45.763
of course,
as we know, is only one of the

00:26:45.763 --> 00:26:49.842
ways in which Milton's power,
or what Woolf thinks of as his

00:26:49.842 --> 00:26:52.940
leadership,
can be thought of.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.603
In 1928, and this is the next
quotation on the handout,

00:26:56.603 --> 00:27:00.199
Milton has come to represent
for Virginia Woolf a very

00:27:00.199 --> 00:27:02.710
different type of cultural
force.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:07.002
Near the conclusion of the
perfectly extraordinary book

00:27:07.002 --> 00:27:10.683
A Room of One's Own,
Woolf elaborates on her

00:27:10.683 --> 00:27:14.382
prophecy of a feminist future,
a world in which women can be

00:27:14.382 --> 00:27:17.329
viewed -- a literary feminist
future –

00:27:17.329 --> 00:27:21.725
a world in which women can be
viewed as writers of no less

00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:24.810
stature and of no less power
than men.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.734
So this is Woolf I am quoting: 
For my belief is [and

00:27:29.734 --> 00:27:32.741
I'll have to skip around a
little bit]

00:27:32.741 --> 00:27:37.699
that if we live another century
or so and have 500 a year each

00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:42.371
of us and rooms of our own,
if we have the habit of freedom

00:27:42.371 --> 00:27:45.579
and the courage to write exactly
what we think,

00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:51.334
if we look past Milton's bogey,
for no human being should shut

00:27:51.334 --> 00:27:54.965
out the view,
then the opportunity will come

00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:59.174
and the dead poet who was
Shakespeare's sister will put on

00:27:59.174 --> 00:28:02.940
the body which she has so often
laid down.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.852
Now the language is
intentionally and really

00:28:05.852 --> 00:28:09.848
sublimely opaque and apocalyptic
here as Woolf imagines what

00:28:09.848 --> 00:28:13.845
might have happened to Judith
Shakespeare had she been given

00:28:13.845 --> 00:28:18.180
the cultural opportunities of
her more privileged brother,

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:22.272
William, but the anticipated
triumph of women writers can

00:28:22.272 --> 00:28:25.779
never occur, according to
Virginia Woolf here,

00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:30.439
until we look past "Milton's
bogey" -- until we look past

00:28:30.439 --> 00:28:33.837
"Milton's bogey."
She's ingeniously vague about

00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:37.654
what Milton's bogey is.
I have puzzled over this,

00:28:37.654 --> 00:28:41.852
I've puzzled over this phrase
for years, and I'm not even

00:28:41.852 --> 00:28:45.751
remotely satisfied that I have a
clue what she means:

00:28:45.751 --> 00:28:49.349
but Milton's bogey would
seem to be,

00:28:49.349 --> 00:28:53.766
I think, that frightening
shadow that Milton casts over

00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:58.919
wives who might find themselves
identifying with the subordinate

00:28:58.919 --> 00:29:02.186
Milton's Eve.
Milton's bogey seems to

00:29:02.186 --> 00:29:05.940
be the specter hovering over
women poets or women writers who

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.756
may find in Milton an
identification of poetic

00:29:08.756 --> 00:29:12.322
strength with masculinity
itself.Now Woolf doesn't try

00:29:12.322 --> 00:29:16.014
to explain exactly how it is
that Milton is shutting out the

00:29:16.014 --> 00:29:18.390
view,
and she doesn't try to explain

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.089
what the view would look like if
it weren't shut out.

00:29:21.089 --> 00:29:26.562
But in citing the power of what
she claims to be this Puritan

00:29:26.562 --> 00:29:30.940
bogey, Virginia Woolf really
suddenly reveals,

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.925
I think, how difficult it is
even for her to shut out

00:29:34.925 --> 00:29:39.676
entirely the real--or it might
just be the bogus--power of John

00:29:39.676 --> 00:29:42.086
Milton.
At the very moment that Woolf

00:29:42.086 --> 00:29:44.839
advises women readers to look
past Milton's bogey,

00:29:44.839 --> 00:29:49.067
she finds herself in the
peculiar position of echoing the

00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:51.821
poetry of John Milton.
This is, I think,

00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:55.089
an unbelievable thing to have
happen at one of the formative

00:29:55.089 --> 00:29:57.359
moments of twentieth-century
feminism.

00:29:57.359 --> 00:30:01.319
She's alluding here,
I think, to one of the most

00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:06.122
famous passages in Paradise
Lost in which Milton is

00:30:06.122 --> 00:30:11.430
asserting nothing other than his
poetic power.This is on the

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.900
handout.
The blind poet calls on the

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.819
Holy Spirit to assist him in the
composition of the epic.

00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:24.258
He asks the Heavenly Muse at
the end of the passage to help

00:30:24.258 --> 00:30:28.619
him "see and tell of things
invisible to mortal sight,"

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:32.570
and Milton's going to need this
additional help from God

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.880
because, as he says -- this is
near the middle of the passage

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.472
-- because "wisdom at one
entrance is quite shut

00:30:40.472 --> 00:30:42.629
out."
Milton's blindness,

00:30:42.629 --> 00:30:45.867
the fact of his blindness,
has shut out his view of

00:30:45.867 --> 00:30:48.636
the visible world,
which would ordinarily present

00:30:48.636 --> 00:30:51.160
itself to him through the
entrance of his eyes;

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.954
and this shut-out will
enable him, will help him,

00:30:54.954 --> 00:30:58.750
explore the invisible world of
divine truth.Now when

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.682
Virginia Woolf writes that
Milton's bogey has shut out the

00:31:02.682 --> 00:31:06.710
view of his female readers,
she seems to be suggesting that

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.930
the specter of Milton blinds
women to the things that they

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.871
should be seeing,
the most important truths out

00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:17.643
there in the world.
How troubling though -- this

00:31:17.643 --> 00:31:21.507
seems undeniable -- and how
strange that Woolf really at her

00:31:21.507 --> 00:31:25.503
most radical is echoing the very
words of the power that she's

00:31:25.503 --> 00:31:28.156
opposing!
It's almost as if she were

00:31:28.156 --> 00:31:31.095
saying in some way,
in a post-Miltonic world,

00:31:31.095 --> 00:31:33.900
which is the world that we all
live in,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.849
it's impossible fully to look
past Milton's bogey;

00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:42.103
that the rhetoric of power,
the literary strategies of

00:31:42.103 --> 00:31:47.160
power, and in some cases the
very experience of power,

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.470
have become inextricably tied
and indebted to Milton.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.779
And in this great prophecy of
twentieth-century feminism,

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:59.029
Woolf is essentially proposing
a cultural revolution.

00:31:59.029 --> 00:32:03.796
And it's as if the text here
were telling us that whether we

00:32:03.796 --> 00:32:07.182
like it or not,
whether we like Milton or not,

00:32:07.182 --> 00:32:11.139
the language of revolution is
one that is forever and always

00:32:11.139 --> 00:32:13.890
indebted to that bogeyman John
Milton,

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:19.152
as Virginia Woolf had written,
"Milton is our leader."Now

00:32:19.152 --> 00:32:24.240
some of you I'm assuming will
already have read Paradise

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:29.327
Lost and so it will come to
you as no surprise that the

00:32:29.327 --> 00:32:34.415
representation of power for
which Milton is most celebrated

00:32:34.415 --> 00:32:40.380
is the power exhibited in the
failed revolution against God,

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.549
the revolution against God by
Satan and his fellow rebels.

00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:48.069
My guess is that our sense of
Milton's power,

00:32:48.069 --> 00:32:52.515
however that power is imagined,
is intimately related to the

00:32:52.515 --> 00:32:55.739
way in which Milton himself
represents power in the

00:32:55.739 --> 00:32:59.480
characters of Satan and of God
in Paradise Lost.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:05.579
Look at the next passage.
This is from Paradise Lost.

00:33:05.579 --> 00:33:09.990
 Satan and the rebel angels
have been roundly defeated.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:15.002
They've been humiliated by the
Son of God and the other

00:33:15.002 --> 00:33:21.130
priggish loyalist angels so they
are pained, utterly humiliated.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:24.404
They're prostrate on the
burning lake of this miserable

00:33:24.404 --> 00:33:27.942
new realm called hell,
yet nonetheless Satan pulls

00:33:27.942 --> 00:33:32.030
himself together and begins to
analyze, to theorize,

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.681
his situation.
He describes for us his own

00:33:34.681 --> 00:33:38.680
power that somehow manages to
survive even a terrifying and

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.610
humiliating defeat like the one
he's just experienced.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:47.170
So this is Satan: 
What though the field be

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.810
lost?
All is not lost;

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:53.368
the unconquerable Will,
And study of revenge,

00:33:53.368 --> 00:33:57.424
immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or

00:33:57.424 --> 00:33:59.770
yield:
And what is else not to

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.830
overcome?
That glory never shall his

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:06.000
wrath or might
Extort from me.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.695
To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee,

00:34:10.695 --> 00:34:14.865
and deify his power
Who from the terror of this Arm

00:34:14.865 --> 00:34:17.010
so late
Doubted his Empire,

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:21.874
that were low indeed,
That were an ignominy and shame

00:34:21.874 --> 00:34:25.280
beneath
This downfall. (I.105-116)

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.014
Now we might at first think
that Satan's vaunting here is

00:34:29.014 --> 00:34:32.882
the product of nothing more
elevated than hate and a desire

00:34:32.882 --> 00:34:37.161
for revenge,
but Milton's doing something

00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:41.711
truly extraordinary.
I think that the imaginative

00:34:41.711 --> 00:34:45.690
achievement here in Satan's
speech is easy to miss.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:50.802
Satan finds it ignominious and
shameful to lower himself to

00:34:50.802 --> 00:34:55.915
God, to bow and sue for grace
with suppliant knee and deify

00:34:55.915 --> 00:34:59.321
His power,
but this kind of submission is

00:34:59.321 --> 00:35:03.663
shameful not because it's simply
always shameful so to debase

00:35:03.663 --> 00:35:06.388
oneself.
It's an ignominy and a shame

00:35:06.388 --> 00:35:10.659
because it may very well be -- I
think this is without question

00:35:10.659 --> 00:35:14.862
what Satan is implying here --
it may very well be that God is

00:35:14.862 --> 00:35:18.093
not actually omnipotent.
Would an omnipotent,

00:35:18.093 --> 00:35:21.916
would a truly all-powerful God
actually doubt the extent of His

00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:24.825
own empire?
In Virginia Woolf's terms,

00:35:24.825 --> 00:35:28.679
Satan is trying to look past
God's bogey.

00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:33.234
He tries to get behind the
highly theatrical,

00:35:33.234 --> 00:35:38.719
the culturally constructed
illusion of God's power,

00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:45.699
and you can hear Satan saying,
"Well, so what if we lost?

00:35:45.699 --> 00:35:49.921
We may have lost this battle,
but the important thing is that

00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:53.650
God revealed a terror of this
arm, of our strength.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.566
A fear of the military strength
of the rebel angels is what was

00:35:57.566 --> 00:36:00.753
manifest in this war.
God was so afraid of us that He

00:36:00.753 --> 00:36:03.269
actually doubted His hold on His
own empire,

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:06.155
an empire that He was only
actually able to maintain

00:36:06.155 --> 00:36:09.267
because of good luck or
something like superior military

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:12.588
firepower,
but certainly nothing as grand

00:36:12.588 --> 00:36:16.380
and as absolute as
omnipotence."This is an

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.510
amazing thing for Satan to say
after his fall.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:25.545
Even the expulsion of Satan
from heaven was not sufficient

00:36:25.545 --> 00:36:30.758
to prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt the legitimate authority

00:36:30.758 --> 00:36:33.366
of God.
That Satan is still able to

00:36:33.366 --> 00:36:36.761
doubt the legitimacy of God's
power is a testimony to the

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:40.250
complexity,
I think, of the analysis of

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:44.165
power in Paradise Lost.
No power,

00:36:44.165 --> 00:36:48.483
not even God's power,
can be irresistibly and

00:36:48.483 --> 00:36:53.169
indisputably proven.
Satan refuses in this speech to

00:36:53.169 --> 00:36:56.224
deify the power of the
conquering enemy,

00:36:56.224 --> 00:37:00.691
and in this refusal Satan
resembles no one so much as John

00:37:00.691 --> 00:37:04.424
Milton: John Milton,
the political leftist who

00:37:04.424 --> 00:37:08.471
refused to deify the power of
the English king Charles the

00:37:08.471 --> 00:37:10.274
First,
who so many of his

00:37:10.274 --> 00:37:13.380
contemporaries considered to be
God's anointed;

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.702
John Milton who wrote hundreds
of pages of anti-monarchic

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:22.565
propaganda until King Charles's
head was safely severed from his

00:37:22.565 --> 00:37:24.164
body.
Like Milton,

00:37:24.164 --> 00:37:27.632
Satan is in the business of
demystifying power,

00:37:27.632 --> 00:37:31.853
of exposing political or
cultural power as something that

00:37:31.853 --> 00:37:36.000
is not simply inherently there
or naturally there.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.895
Power is something -- and this
is what we learn from a reading

00:37:39.895 --> 00:37:43.472
of John Milton -- power is
something that is created by a

00:37:43.472 --> 00:37:48.001
human process of deification,
a process of king-worship or a

00:37:48.001 --> 00:37:52.280
process of God-worship or
book-worship or a process,

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.887
for that matter,
of poet-worship.Now later

00:37:55.887 --> 00:38:00.055
on in Paradise Lost,
Satan comes to the

00:38:00.055 --> 00:38:04.624
conclusion that that old man in
heaven who had assumed the

00:38:04.624 --> 00:38:09.193
authority to issue all of those
arbitrary decrees -- Satan

00:38:09.193 --> 00:38:13.201
finally relents and concedes
that He is actually an

00:38:13.201 --> 00:38:17.610
omnipotent God and that that God
actually is,

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.719
or was, the omnipotent creator
of all things.

00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:24.051
But despite this enormous
concession and this realization,

00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:27.297
Satan is still justified,
I think, in his cynical

00:38:27.297 --> 00:38:31.139
demystification of God's
behavior before the defeat of

00:38:31.139 --> 00:38:34.821
the rebel angels.
And Satan complains now that

00:38:34.821 --> 00:38:38.886
God never bothered to
demonstrate to the angels just

00:38:38.886 --> 00:38:42.428
how powerful He was.
And so this is the last

00:38:42.428 --> 00:38:45.940
quotation on the handout.
Satan again: 

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.347
But He who reigns
Monarch in Heav'n,

00:38:48.347 --> 00:38:51.981
till then as one secure
Sat on his Throne,

00:38:51.981 --> 00:38:55.530
upheld by old repute,
Consent or custom,

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.957
and his Regal State
Put forth at full,

00:38:58.957 --> 00:39:02.219
but still his strength
conceal'd,

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:05.079
Which tempted our attempt and
wrought our fall.

00:39:05.079 --> 00:39:08.136
(I.637-642)
Satan's saying that before the

00:39:08.136 --> 00:39:10.763
war in heaven,
God's power just seemed like

00:39:10.763 --> 00:39:14.638
any other king's power,
as if God sat on the throne of

00:39:14.638 --> 00:39:19.135
heaven merely because of those
humanly constructed reasons of

00:39:19.135 --> 00:39:22.707
tradition,
or of old repute or consent or

00:39:22.707 --> 00:39:24.650
custom.
Now alas for Satan,

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.203
it turned out that God's
monarchy was actually based on

00:39:28.203 --> 00:39:31.627
genuine strength.
It wasn't simply that God just

00:39:31.627 --> 00:39:36.054
happened to be wearing the crown
and just happened to be sitting

00:39:36.054 --> 00:39:39.516
in the best chair;
but in Satan's articulation of

00:39:39.516 --> 00:39:42.629
what we can think of as a
dialectic of power and

00:39:42.629 --> 00:39:46.031
authority,
he provides us with a useful

00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:50.933
analysis of the problems
besetting any understanding of

00:39:50.933 --> 00:39:53.303
power.
The kinds of authority

00:39:53.303 --> 00:39:56.975
established by the bogeys of
tradition and custom and

00:39:56.975 --> 00:40:01.283
conservative tradition are not
always distinguishable from the

00:40:01.283 --> 00:40:05.449
kinds of authority that are
based on genuine strength.

00:40:05.449 --> 00:40:09.544
Even if we locate a source of
some kind of genuine strength,

00:40:09.544 --> 00:40:13.014
authoritative strength,
it's still usually possible,

00:40:13.014 --> 00:40:15.863
as it is for Satan,
to argue that that power is

00:40:15.863 --> 00:40:19.146
really at base just the
concealed product of custom or

00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:22.429
what we would think of as
cultural construction.

00:40:22.429 --> 00:40:26.134
To be a king,
one need merely put forth one's

00:40:26.134 --> 00:40:31.353
regal state, one simply needs to
act kingly.Now I raise the

00:40:31.353 --> 00:40:35.731
matter of Satan's critique of
God's power because the

00:40:35.731 --> 00:40:39.519
evaluation and the criticism of
Milton,

00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:43.448
and especially of Milton's
poetry, has hinged for a couple

00:40:43.448 --> 00:40:47.308
of centuries now on a related
set of questions about this

00:40:47.308 --> 00:40:50.829
poet's power.
Is Milton powerful for the very

00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:55.678
straightforward reason that he's
in possession of this tremendous

00:40:55.678 --> 00:40:59.239
literary strength,
this unimaginable talent?

00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:02.417
Or has Milton only seemed
powerful because of the

00:41:02.417 --> 00:41:06.257
traditional religious values
with which he is so intimately

00:41:06.257 --> 00:41:09.498
associated?
Does Milton only seem powerful

00:41:09.498 --> 00:41:14.220
because he has the force or the
strength of the age-old literary

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.943
canon behind him?
Does Milton only seem powerful

00:41:17.943 --> 00:41:22.240
because he's the very literary
embodiment of patriarchy and

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.316
masculine bias?It goes
without saying that these are

00:41:26.316 --> 00:41:30.243
questions that it's impossible
for us to try to answer

00:41:30.243 --> 00:41:34.316
certainly now,
but Milton lets us know later

00:41:34.316 --> 00:41:39.522
in Paradise Lost that
Satan was wrong to embark on his

00:41:39.522 --> 00:41:43.340
dangerous deconstruction of
divine power.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.949
Milton ultimately is a pious
man and wants us to frown on

00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:52.229
Satan's critique of the
Judeo-Christian conception of

00:41:52.229 --> 00:41:55.858
divinity.
But regardless of Milton's

00:41:55.858 --> 00:42:01.564
ultimate dismissal of Satan's
position, Satan's analysis of

00:42:01.564 --> 00:42:04.717
power,
and of God's power especially,

00:42:04.717 --> 00:42:09.027
isn't that easily dismissible.
And that's not simply because

00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:12.216
Satan bears such a strong
resemblance to Milton,

00:42:12.216 --> 00:42:13.980
as, of course,
he does.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:18.860
I'm convinced Satan looks ahead
to us as well.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:23.476
Satan resembles us as
readers as we attempt to dissect

00:42:23.476 --> 00:42:27.170
and to anatomize the power of
Milton's poetry.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:31.092
I would go so far to say that
something like a satanic

00:42:31.092 --> 00:42:35.385
sensibility may be one of our
best guides in our reading of

00:42:35.385 --> 00:42:38.136
Milton.
It's Milton's Satan who best

00:42:38.136 --> 00:42:42.077
prepares us -- I'll throw this
out here at the end of this

00:42:42.077 --> 00:42:46.364
lecture -- who best prepares us
to explore what we can think of

00:42:46.364 --> 00:42:49.130
as the labyrinth of Miltonic
power.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:54.455
He puts us in a position to
explore that truly weird but

00:42:54.455 --> 00:42:59.489
undeniable process whereby the
very word "Milton,"

00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:04.525
the name "Milton," stops
referring to a particular

00:43:04.525 --> 00:43:10.178
middle-class Londoner who was
born in 1608 and begins to

00:43:10.178 --> 00:43:15.830
embody the very essence of that
strange and inexplicable

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:21.893
phenomenon that we call literary
power.So the lecture is

00:43:21.893 --> 00:43:23.230
over.

00:43:51.699 --> 00:43:56.469
For next time,
make sure that you will have

00:43:56.469 --> 00:44:01.579
read at the very least Milton's
great poem,

00:44:01.579 --> 00:44:05.770
and he wrote it when he was
only twenty-one years old,

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.182
"The Ode on Christ's Nativity."
And read, of course,

00:44:09.182 --> 00:44:11.349
the other two poems that were
assigned for the class.

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:14.730
But we'll be focusing on what
we call "The Nativity Ode."

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:15.863
Okay, that's it.
